1952 Garwin shared with me his opinion
that all it takes is one nistic madman

nuclear launch somewhere around the
 

255
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,270
nuclear launch somewhere around the

281
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:09,950

warning the president
 

287
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,909
warning the president
can launch and that was one of the most

288
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:17,919
can launch and that was one of the most
 

289
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,110
can launch and that was one of the most
remarkable details to really nail down

290
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
remarkable details to really nail down
 

291
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,710
remarkable details to really nail down
for this book when I was reporting this

292
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:22,720
for this book when I was reporting this
 

293
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,749
for this book when I was reporting this
book and talking to Secretary of

294
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:24,759
book and talking to Secretary of
 

295
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:26,510
book and talking to Secretary of
defenses for example who are the people

296
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:26,520
defenses for example who are the people
 

297
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,830
defenses for example who are the people
who advise the president on this matter

298
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:28,840
who advise the president on this matter
 

299
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,230
who advise the president on this matter
right you say to yourself wait a minute

300
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:31,240
right you say to yourself wait a minute
 

301
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,230
right you say to yourself wait a minute
how could that possibly be and so let's

302
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:33,240
how could that possibly be and so let's
 

303
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,270
how could that possibly be and so let's
unpack that right so in addition to the

304
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:36,280
unpack that right so in addition to the
 

305
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,070
unpack that right so in addition to the
launch on warning concept there's this

306
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,080
launch on warning concept there's this
 

307
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,830
launch on warning concept there's this
other insane concept called sole

308
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:41,840
other insane concept called sole
 

309
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,309
other insane concept called sole
presidential Authority and you might

310
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:44,319
presidential Authority and you might
 

311
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,070
presidential Authority and you might
think in a democracy that's impossible

312
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:47,080
think in a democracy that's impossible
 

313
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,629
think in a democracy that's impossible
right you can't just start a war well

314
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:49,639
right you can't just start a war well
 

315
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,430
right you can't just start a war well
you can just start a nuclear war if

316
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:51,440
you can just start a nuclear war if
 

317
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,510
you can just start a nuclear war if
you're the commander-in-chief the

318
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:53,520
you're the commander-in-chief the
 

319
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,909
you're the commander-in-chief the
president of the United States in fact

320
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:55,919
president of the United States in fact
 

321
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,510
president of the United States in fact
you're the only one who can do that and

322
00:07:59,510 --> 00:07:59,520
you're the only one who can do that and
 

323
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,309
you're the only one who can do that and

but what if someone did and in my

646
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:29,440
but what if someone did and in my
 

647
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,269
but what if someone did and in my
interviews with scores of top tier

648

National Security advisers people who

650
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:34,759
National Security advisers people who
 

651
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:36,590
National Security advisers people who
advise the president people who are

652
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:36,600
advise the president people who are
 

653
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,430
advise the president people who are
responsible for these decisions if they

654
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:38,440
responsible for these decisions if they
 

655
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,150
responsible for these decisions if they
had to be made every single one of them

656
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,160
had to be made every single one of them
 

657
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,350
had to be made every single one of them
said it could happen they didn't say

658
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:45,360
said it could happen they didn't say
 

659
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,590
said it could happen they didn't say
this would never

660
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:47,600
this would never
 

661
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,389
this would never
happen and so the

662
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:50,399
happen and so the
 

663
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,470
happen and so the
idea is worth thinking about

664
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:53,480
idea is worth thinking about
 

665
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,110
idea is worth thinking about
because I believe that it pulls back the

666
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:58,120
because I believe that it pulls back the
 

667
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,590
because I believe that it pulls back the

someone were to use a tactical nuclear

672
00:16:04,749 --> 00:16:04,759
someone were to use a tactical nuclear
 

673
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:07,189
someone were to use a tactical nuclear
weapon oh well it's just an

674
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:07,199
weapon oh well it's just an
 

675
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,870
weapon oh well it's just an
escalation it's far more than

676
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:09,880
escalation it's far more than
 

677
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,389
escalation it's far more than
that so to you the use of a tactical

678
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:12,399
that so to you the use of a tactical
 

679
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,230
that so to you the use of a tactical
nuclear weapon maybe you can draw the

680
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:14,240
nuclear weapon maybe you can draw the
 

681
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,389
nuclear weapon maybe you can draw the
line between a tactical and a strategic

682
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:16,399
line between a tactical and a strategic
 

683
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,710
line between a tactical and a strategic
nuclear weapon that could be a catalyst

684
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:20,720
nuclear weapon that could be a catalyst
 

685
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,069
nuclear weapon that could be a catalyst
like that's a very difficult thing to

686
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:22,079
like that's a very difficult thing to
 

687
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,710
like that's a very difficult thing to
walk back from oh my God almost

that all treaties are based on this idea
of no nuclear use right you cannot cross

of no nuclear use right you cannot cross
 

799
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,669
of no nuclear use right you cannot cross
that line and so the what would happen

800
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:05,679
that line and so the what would happen
 

801
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,310
that line and so the what would happen
if the line is crossed is so devastating

802
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:09,320
if the line is crossed is so devastating

they're called the Jason scientists many

898
00:21:16,029 --> 00:21:16,039
they're called the Jason scientists many
 

899
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:18,230
they're called the Jason scientists many
conspiracies about them abound I

900
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:18,240
conspiracies about them abound I

interviewed their founder and have
 

903
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:22,350
interviewed their founder and have
interviewed many of them but they

whittled the number down to seconds

906
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:26,200
whittled the number down to seconds
 

907
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,590
whittled the number down to seconds
okay specifically for her York and it

908
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:28,600
okay specifically for her York and it
 

909
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,350
okay specifically for her York and it
goes like this cuz this is where my jaw

910
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:30,360
goes like this cuz this is where my jaw
 

911
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,990
goes like this cuz this is where my jaw
dropped and I went wow okay so 26

912
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:35,000
dropped and I went wow okay so 26
 

913
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,190
dropped and I went wow okay so 26
minutes and 40 seconds from a Launchpad

914
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:38,200
minutes and 40 seconds from a Launchpad
 

915
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,390
minutes and 40 seconds from a Launchpad
in the Soviet Union to the east coast

916
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:42,400
in the Soviet Union to the east coast
 

917
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,549
in the Soviet Union to the east coast
and it happens in three phases very

918
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:44,559
and it happens in three phases very
 

919
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,149
and it happens in three phases very
simple and interesting to remember

920
00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:46,159
simple and interesting to remember
 

921
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,630
simple and interesting to remember
because then suddenly all of this makes

922
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:48,640
because then suddenly all of this makes
 

923
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,750
because then suddenly all of this makes
more sense boost phase midcourse phase

924
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:52,760
more sense boost phase midcourse phase
 

925
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,909
more sense boost phase midcourse phase
and then terminal phase okay boost Phase

926
00:21:56,909 --> 00:21:56,919
and then terminal phase okay boost Phase
 

927
00:21:56,919 --> 00:21:59,470
and then terminal phase okay boost Phase
5 minutes that's when the rocket

928
00:21:59,470 --> 00:21:59,480
5 minutes that's when the rocket
 

929
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,590
5 minutes that's when the rocket
launches so you just imagine a rocket

930
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:01,600
launches so you just imagine a rocket
 

931
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,669
launches so you just imagine a rocket
going off the Launchpad and the fire

932
00:22:04,669 --> 00:22:04,679
going off the Launchpad and the fire
 

933
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:05,950
going off the Launchpad and the fire
beneath it again that's why the

934
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:05,960
beneath it again that's why the
 

935
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,190
beneath it again that's why the
satellites can see it okay now it's

936
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:08,200
satellites can see it okay now it's
 

937
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,230
satellites can see it okay now it's
becoming visual now it makes sense to me

938
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:11,240
becoming visual now it makes sense to me
 

939
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,110
becoming visual now it makes sense to me
right five minutes and that's where the

940
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:14,120
right five minutes and that's where the
 

941
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,990
right five minutes and that's where the
rocket can be tracked and then Imagine

942
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,000
rocket can be tracked and then Imagine
 

943
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,950
rocket can be tracked and then Imagine
Learning wait a minute after 5 minutes

944
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:19,960
Learning wait a minute after 5 minutes
 

945
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,750
Learning wait a minute after 5 minutes
the rocket can no longer be seen from

946
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:21,760
the rocket can no longer be seen from

rocket exhaust then the missile enters

950
00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:26,799
rocket exhaust then the missile enters
 

951
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,149
rocket exhaust then the missile enters
its midc phase 20 20 minutes and that's

952
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:30,159
its midc phase 20 20 minutes and that's
 

953
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,789
its midc phase 20 20 minutes and that's
the ballistic part of it where it's kind

954
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:31,799
the ballistic part of it where it's kind

1075
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,750
we're closer to this as a reality than
ever before and so on the bright the

1076
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:28,760
ever before and so on the bright the
 

1077
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,630
ever before and so on the bright the
only bright side of any of this is that

1078
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:30,640
only bright side of any of this is that
 

1079
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,430
only bright side of any of this is that
like the answer lies most definitely in

1080
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:34,440
like the answer lies most definitely in
 

1081
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,549
like the answer lies most definitely in
communication so there's a million other

1082
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:36,559
communication so there's a million other
 

1083
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,909
communication so there's a million other
questions here uh I think the details

1084
00:25:39,909 --> 00:25:39,919
questions here uh I think the details
 

1085
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,110
questions here uh I think the details
are fascinating and important to

1086
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,120
are fascinating and important to
 

1087
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,070
are fascinating and important to
understand so one you also say uh

1088
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,080
understand so one you also say uh
 

1089
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,430
understand so one you also say uh
nuclear submarines you mentioned about

1090
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:48,440
nuclear submarines you mentioned about
 

1091
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,750
nuclear submarines you mentioned about
30 minutes 20 26 33 minutes but with uh

1092
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:52,760
30 minutes 20 26 33 minutes but with uh
 

1093
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,070
30 minutes 20 26 33 minutes but with uh
nuclear submarines that number can be

1094
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:55,080
nuclear submarines that number can be
 

1095
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,510
nuclear submarines that number can be
much much lower so how long does it take

1096
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:58,520
much much lower so how long does it take
 

1097
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,909
much much lower so how long does it take
for a warhead to missile to reach the

1098
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:01,919
for a warhead to missile to reach the
 

1099
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,230
for a warhead to missile to reach the
east coast of the United States from a

1100
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:03,240
east coast of the United States from a
 

1101
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,190
east coast of the United States from a
submarine just when you thought it was

1102
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:05,200
submarine just when you thought it was
 

1103
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,990
submarine just when you thought it was
really bad yeah and then you kind of

1104
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:07,000
really bad yeah and then you kind of
 

1105
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,070
really bad yeah and then you kind of
realize about the submarines I mean the

1106
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:09,080
realize about the submarines I mean the
 

1107
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,750
realize about the submarines I mean the
submarines are what are called second

1108
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:10,760
submarines are what are called second
 

1109
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,630
submarines are what are called second
strike capacity right and you know it

1110
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:13,640
strike capacity right and you know it
 

1111
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,350
strike capacity right and you know it
was descri submarines were described to

1112
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:15,360
was descri submarines were described to
 

1113
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,710
was descri submarines were described to
me this way they are as dangerous to

1114
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:17,720
me this way they are as dangerous to
 

1115
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,230
me this way they are as dangerous to
civilization and let me say a nuclear

1116
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:20,240
civilization and let me say a nuclear
 

1117
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,389
civilization and let me say a nuclear
armed nuclear powered submarine is as

1118
00:26:23,389 --> 00:26:23,399
armed nuclear powered submarine is as
 

1119
00:26:23,399 --> 00:26:26,909
armed nuclear powered submarine is as
dangerous to civilization as an asteroid

1120

we now know they're sneaking up to the
 

1143
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:04,789
we now know they're sneaking up to the
east and west coast of the United States

00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:06,840
within a couple hundred miles how do we
 

1147
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,510
within a couple hundred miles how do we
know that why do we know that well I

found a document inside of a budget um

1150
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:12,559
found a document inside of a budget um
 

1151
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,190
found a document inside of a budget um
that the defense department was going to

submarines how close they were getting

1158
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:21,720
submarines how close they were getting
 

1159
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,630

200 miles couple hundred miles yes they

1164
00:27:28,669 --> 00:27:28,679
200 miles couple hundred miles yes they
 

1165
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:30,029
200 miles couple hundred miles yes they
weren't precise on the number but when

1166
00:27:30,029 --> 00:27:30,039
weren't precise on the number but when
 

1167
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:32,750
weren't precise on the number but when
you look at the map yep and that's when

1168
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:32,760
you look at the map yep and that's when
 

1169
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,350
you look at the map yep and that's when
you're talking about under 10 minutes

00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:35,360
you're talking about under 10 minutes
 

1171
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,510
you're talking about under 10 minutes
from launch to to strike undetectable

from launch to to strike undetectable
 

1173
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,149
from launch to to strike undetectable
and they're undetectable the the map

1174
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:40,159
and they're undetectable the the map
 

1175

a lot of underwater surveillance systems
 

1179
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,710
a lot of underwater surveillance systems
that we have you know but in real time

1180
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:47,720
that we have you know but in real time
 

1181
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,909
that we have you know but in real time
you cannot find a a nuclear submarine

1182
00:27:51,909 --> 00:27:51,919
you cannot find a a nuclear submarine
 

1183
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,630
you cannot find a a nuclear submarine
and you know just the way a submarine

1184
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:53,640
and you know just the way a submarine
 

1185
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,110
and you know just the way a submarine
launches goes 150 ft below the surface

1186
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,120

to launch its ballistic missile I mean

1188
00:27:59,909 --> 00:27:59,919
to launch its ballistic missile I mean
 

1189
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,830
to launch its ballistic missile I mean
it comes out of the missile tube and

1190
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:02,840
it comes out of the missile tube and
 

1191
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,230
it comes out of the missile tube and
with enough thrust that the the

1192
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:06,240
with enough thrust that the the
 

1193
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,149
with enough thrust that the the
thrusters the boo they ignite outside

1194
00:28:09,149 --> 00:28:09,159
thrusters the boo they ignite outside
 

1195
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:12,149
thrusters the boo they ignite outside
the water and then they move into boost

1196
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:12,159
the water and then they move into boost
 

1197
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,750
the water and then they move into boost
and so the technology involved is just

1198
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:14,760
and so the technology involved is just
 

1199
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,549
and so the technology involved is just
stunning and shocking and again

1200
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:16,559
stunning and shocking and again
 

1201
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,470
stunning and shocking and again
trillions of dollars spent so that we

1202
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:19,480
trillions of dollars spent so that we
 

1203
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,070
trillions of dollars spent so that we
never have a nuclear war but my God what

never have a nuclear war but my God what
 

1205
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,549
never have a nuclear war but my God what
if we

write about so for the land launched

1218
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:40,720
write about so for the land launched
 

1219
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,509
write about so for the land launched
ones they're presumably

1220
00:28:43,509 --> 00:28:43,519
ones they're presumably
 

1221
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:46,190

underground so the silos how long does

1222
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:46,200
underground so the silos how long does
 

1223
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,149
underground so the silos how long does
it take to go from like pressing the

1224
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:48,159
it take to go from like pressing the
 

1225
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,669
it take to go from like pressing the
button to them emerging from underground

1226
00:28:50,669 --> 00:28:50,679
button to them emerging from underground
 

1227
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:52,830
button to them emerging from underground
for launch and is is that part

1228
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:52,840
for launch and is is that part
 

1229
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,710
for launch and is is that part
detectable or it's only the the heat so

1230
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:55,720
detectable or it's only the the heat so
 

1231
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,149
detectable or it's only the the heat so
what's interesting about the silos

1232
00:28:57,149 --> 00:28:57,159
what's interesting about the silos
 

1233
00:28:57,159 --> 00:28:59,950
what's interesting about the silos
America has 4 00 silos right we've had

1234
00:28:59,950 --> 00:28:59,960
America has 4 00 silos right we've had
 

1235
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:04,029
America has 4 00 silos right we've had
more um but we have 400 and they're

1236
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:04,039
more um but we have 400 and they're
 

1237
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:06,630
more um but we have 400 and they're
underground and they're called Minutemen

1238
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:06,640
underground and they're called Minutemen
 

1239
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,909
underground and they're called Minutemen
right after the Revolutionary War Heroes

1240
00:29:08,909 --> 00:29:08,919
right after the Revolutionary War Heroes
 

1241
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:12,190
right after the Revolutionary War Heroes
but the sort of joke in Washington is

1242
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:12,200
but the sort of joke in Washington is
 

1243
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,269
but the sort of joke in Washington is
they're not called Minutemen for nothing

1244
00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:14,279
they're not called Minutemen for nothing
 

1245
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:16,310
they're not called Minutemen for nothing
because they can launch in one minute

1246
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:16,320
because they can launch in one minute
 

1247
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,830
because they can launch in one minute
yeah right so the president orders the

1248
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:18,840
yeah right so the president orders the
 

1249
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,590
yeah right so the president orders the
launch of the icbms ICBM stands for

launch of the icbms ICBM stands for
 

1251
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,269

intercontinental ballistic missile he
 

1253
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,269
intercontinental ballistic missile he
orders the launch and they launch 60

1254
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:27,279
orders the launch and they launch 60
 

1255
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,870
orders the launch and they launch 60
seconds later and then they take 30 some

1256
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:29,880
seconds later and then they take 30 some
 

1257
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,750
seconds later and then they take 30 some
odd minutes to get to where they're

1258
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:31,760
odd minutes to get to where they're
 

1259
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,909
odd minutes to get to where they're
going the submarines take about 14 or 15

1260
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:36,919
going the submarines take about 14 or 15
 

1261
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:39,590
going the submarines take about 14 or 15
minutes from the presidential from the

1262
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:39,600
minutes from the presidential from the
 

1263
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,190
minutes from the presidential from the
launch command to actually launching and

1264

launch command to actually launching and
 

1265
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,110
launch command to actually launching and
that has to do I surmise with the

1266
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:45,120
that has to do I surmise with the
 

1267
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,590
that has to do I surmise with the
location of the submarine its depth some

1268
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:48,600
location of the submarine its depth some
 

1269
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,590
location of the submarine its depth some
of these things are so highly classified

of these things are so highly classified
 

1271
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,149

before they were there on on you know
 

1295
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,669
before they were there on on you know
Google they were there in maps because

what are called Road Mobile launchers
 

1305
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:35,509
what are called Road Mobile launchers
right so Russia has a lot of underground

1306
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:35,519
right so Russia has a lot of underground
 

1307
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:38,190
right so Russia has a lot of underground

you through these different facilities

00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:39,919
you through these different facilities
 

1311
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,830
you through these different facilities
that really do exist and they're all

1312
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:41,840
that really do exist and they're all
 

1313
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,789
that really do exist and they're all
sourced with how many weapons they have

and their launch procedures and whatnot
 

1317
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,269
and their launch procedures and whatnot
but in addition to having um underground

1318
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:49,279
but in addition to having um underground
 

1319
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,750

silos they have Road Mobile launchers
and that means you just have one of

1322
00:30:54,389 --> 00:30:54,399
and that means you just have one of
 

1323
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:58,549
and that means you just have one of
these giant icbms on a 22

kind of moving into an era whereby the
the threat of actually having new weapon

1434
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:27,320
the threat of actually having new weapon
 

1435
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,669
the threat of actually having new weapon
systems that are nuclear capable is very

1436
00:33:30,669 --> 00:33:30,679
systems that are nuclear capable is very
 

1437
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:34,269
systems that are nuclear capable is very
real because of the escalating tensions

1438
00:33:34,269 --> 00:33:34,279
real because of the escalating tensions
 

1439
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:35,750
real because of the escalating tensions
around the world and that's where the

1440
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:35,760
around the world and that's where the
 

1441
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,750
around the world and that's where the
CIA would guess is doing most of its

1442
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:37,760
CIA would guess is doing most of its
 

1443
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,710
CIA would guess is doing most of its
work right now so most of your research

1444
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:39,720
work right now so most of your research
 

1445
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,110
work right now so most of your research
is kind of looking at the the older

1446
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:43,120
is kind of looking at the the older
 

1447
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,310
is kind of looking at the the older
versions of the system and presumably

1448
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:45,320
versions of the system and presumably
 

1449
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,789
versions of the system and presumably
there's potentially secret development

1450
00:33:47,789 --> 00:33:47,799
there's potentially secret development
 

1451
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:50,750
there's potentially secret development
of new ones hopefully which violates

1452
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:50,760
of new ones hopefully which violates
 

1453
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,029
of new ones hopefully which violates
treaties so yes that is where the

1454
00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:53,039
treaties so yes that is where the
 

1455
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,830
treaties so yes that is where the
intelligence agencies but you know at a

point it's Overkill literally and
 

1459
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,830

know the Doomsday plane launches the
stratcom commander jumps in he's in that

1902
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:12,400
stratcom commander jumps in he's in that
 

1903
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,109
stratcom commander jumps in he's in that
plane he's flying around the United

1904
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:14,119
plane he's flying around the United
 

1905
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:17,470
plane he's flying around the United
States and uh he's making decisions

1906
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:17,480
States and uh he's making decisions
 

1907
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,910
States and uh he's making decisions
because the pentagon's been taken

1908
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:20,920
because the pentagon's been taken
 

1909
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,829
because the pentagon's been taken
out at 911 by the way Bush was in the

1910
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:23,839
out at 911 by the way Bush was in the
 

1911
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:27,630
out at 911 by the way Bush was in the
Doomsday plane and uh bush had to make

1912
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:27,640
Doomsday plane and uh bush had to make
 

1913
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:30,470
Doomsday plane and uh bush had to make
decisions quickly but not so quickly not

1914
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:30,480
decisions quickly but not so quickly not
 

1915
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,710
decisions quickly but not so quickly not
as quickly as he would have need to have

1916
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:32,720
as quickly as he would have need to have
 

1917
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,710
as quickly as he would have need to have
done if there's a nuclear launch I mean

1918
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:35,720
done if there's a nuclear launch I mean
 

1919
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,589
done if there's a nuclear launch I mean
six

1920
00:44:36,589 --> 00:44:36,599
six
 

1921
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:38,870
six
minutes it's basically happens in three

1922
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:38,880
minutes it's basically happens in three
 

1923
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,829
minutes it's basically happens in three
acts there's the first 24 minutes the

1924
00:44:42,829 --> 00:44:42,839
acts there's the first 24 minutes the
 

1925
00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:47,430
acts there's the first 24 minutes the
next 24 minutes and the last 24 minutes

1926
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:47,440
next 24 minutes and the last 24 minutes
 

1927
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:53,270
next 24 minutes and the last 24 minutes
and that is the reality of nuclear

1928
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:53,280

 

1929
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,270

weapons what is the Interceptor

1930
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:56,280
weapons what is the Interceptor
 

1931
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,030
weapons what is the Interceptor
capabilities of the United States how

1932
00:44:59,030 --> 00:44:59,040
capabilities of the United States how
 

1933
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,430
capabilities of the United States how
many nuclear missiles can be

1934
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:01,440
many nuclear missiles can be
 

1935
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,349
many nuclear missiles can be
stopped I was at a dinner party with a

1936
00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:05,359
stopped I was at a dinner party with a
 

1937
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,510
stopped I was at a dinner party with a
very informed person right like somebody

1938
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:07,520
very informed person right like somebody
 

1939
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,390
very informed person right like somebody
who really you know should have known

1940
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:10,400
who really you know should have known
 

1941
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,109
who really you know should have known
this and I this is when I was

1942
00:45:13,109 --> 00:45:13,119
this and I this is when I was
 

1943
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:14,910
this and I this is when I was
considering writing and Reporting this

1944
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:14,920
considering writing and Reporting this
 

1945
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:19,069
considering writing and Reporting this
book and he said to me oh Annie that

1946
00:45:19,069 --> 00:45:19,079
book and he said to me oh Annie that
 

1947
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:22,150
book and he said to me oh Annie that
would never happen because of our

1948
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:22,160
would never happen because of our
 

1949
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,390
would never happen because of our
powerful Interceptor system okay well

1950
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:25,400
powerful Interceptor system okay well
 

1951
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,150
powerful Interceptor system okay well
he's wrong let me tell you about our

1952
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:27,160
he's wrong let me tell you about our
 

1953
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,549
he's wrong let me tell you about our
powerful Interceptor system first of all

1954
00:45:29,549 --> 00:45:29,559
powerful Interceptor system first of all
 

1955
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:33,589
powerful Interceptor system first of all
we have 44 Interceptor missiles total

1956
00:45:33,589 --> 00:45:33,599
we have 44 Interceptor missiles total
 

1957
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,190
we have 44 Interceptor missiles total
period full stop let me repeat

1958
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:36,200
period full stop let me repeat
 

1959
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,630
period full stop let me repeat
44 okay earlier we were talking about

1960
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:39,640
44 okay earlier we were talking about
 

1961
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:42,710
44 okay earlier we were talking about
Russia's

1962
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:42,720

 

1963
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,750

1,670 deployed nuclear weapons how are

1964
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:45,760
1,670 deployed nuclear weapons how are
 

1965
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,190
1,670 deployed nuclear weapons how are
they how are those 44 Interceptor

1966
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:48,200
they how are those 44 Interceptor
 

1967
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:52,710
they how are those 44 Interceptor
missiles going to work right um and they

1968
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:52,720
missiles going to work right um and they
 

1969
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,750
missiles going to work right um and they
also have a success rate of around 50%

1970
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:55,760
also have a success rate of around 50%
 

1971
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,230
also have a success rate of around 50%
so they work 50% of the time there are

1972
00:45:58,230 --> 00:45:58,240
so they work 50% of the time there are
 

1973
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,670
so they work 50% of the time there are
40 of them in Alaska and there four of

1974
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:01,680
40 of them in Alaska and there four of
 

1975
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,069
40 of them in Alaska and there four of
them at Vandenberg Air Force Base in

1976
00:46:04,069 --> 00:46:04,079
them at Vandenberg Air Force Base in
 

1977
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:07,109
them at Vandenberg Air Force Base in
Santa Barbara okay and they are

1978
00:46:07,109 --> 00:46:07,119
Santa Barbara okay and they are
 

1979
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:10,150
Santa Barbara okay and they are
responsible at about 9 minutes into the

1980
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:10,160
responsible at about 9 minutes into the
 

1981
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,710
responsible at about 9 minutes into the
scenario right after the ICBM has

1982
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:13,720
scenario right after the ICBM has
 

1983
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,910
scenario right after the ICBM has
finished that five- minute boost phase

1984
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:15,920
finished that five- minute boost phase
 

1985
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,349
finished that five- minute boost phase
we talked about now it's in midcourse

1986
00:46:18,349 --> 00:46:18,359
we talked about now it's in midcourse
 

1987
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:23,270
we talked about now it's in midcourse
phase and the ground radar systems have

1988
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:23,280
phase and the ground radar systems have
 

1989
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,069
phase and the ground radar systems have
identified yes this is an incoming ICBM

1990
00:46:28,069 --> 00:46:28,079
identified yes this is an incoming ICBM
 

1991
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,470
identified yes this is an incoming ICBM
MH and now the Interceptor missiles have

1992
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:30,480
MH and now the Interceptor missiles have
 

1993
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,750
MH and now the Interceptor missiles have
to launch right it's essentially

1994
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:32,760
to launch right it's essentially
 

1995
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,349
to launch right it's essentially
shooting a missile with a missile inside

1996
00:46:35,349 --> 00:46:35,359
shooting a missile with a missile inside
 

1997
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,109
shooting a missile with a missile inside
the Interceptor which is just a big

1998
00:46:37,109 --> 00:46:37,119
the Interceptor which is just a big
 

1999
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:41,069
the Interceptor which is just a big
giant rocket in its nose cone it has

2000
00:46:41,069 --> 00:46:41,079
giant rocket in its nose cone it has
 

2001
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:44,390
giant rocket in its nose cone it has
what's called a the apply named EXO

2002
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:44,400
what's called a the apply named EXO
 

2003
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,309
what's called a the apply named EXO
atmospheric kill vehicle okay there's no

2004
00:46:48,309 --> 00:46:48,319
atmospheric kill vehicle okay there's no
 

2005
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,870
atmospheric kill vehicle okay there's no
explosives in that thing it's literally

2006
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:50,880
explosives in that thing it's literally
 

2007
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,069
explosives in that thing it's literally
just going to take out the Warhead

2008
00:46:55,069 --> 00:46:55,079
just going to take out the Warhead
 

2009
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:57,510
just going to take out the Warhead
ideally with Force

2010
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:57,520
ideally with Force
 

2011
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,069
ideally with Force
so one of them is going like you know

2012
00:47:00,069 --> 00:47:00,079
so one of them is going like you know
 

2013
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,390
so one of them is going like you know
March 20 and the I mean the the speeds

2014
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:02,400
March 20 and the I mean the the speeds
 

2015
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,190
March 20 and the I mean the the speeds
at which these two moving objects

2016
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:05,200
at which these two moving objects
 

2017
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,109
at which these two moving objects
hurdling through space are going is

2018
00:47:08,109 --> 00:47:08,119
hurdling through space are going is
 

2019
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:10,549
hurdling through space are going is
astonishing and the fact that that

2020
00:47:10,549 --> 00:47:10,559
astonishing and the fact that that
 

2021
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:13,150
astonishing and the fact that that
interception is even possible is really

2022
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:13,160
interception is even possible is really
 

2023
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,390
interception is even possible is really
remarkable but it's only possible 50% of

2024
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:15,400
remarkable but it's only possible 50% of
 

2025
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,349
remarkable but it's only possible 50% of
the time is it possible that we only

2026
00:47:18,349 --> 00:47:18,359
the time is it possible that we only
 

2027
00:47:18,359 --> 00:47:20,349
the time is it possible that we only
know about 44 but there could be a lot

2028
00:47:20,349 --> 00:47:20,359
know about 44 but there could be a lot
 

2029
00:47:20,359 --> 00:47:23,390
know about 44 but there could be a lot
more no impossible that I would be

2030
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:23,400
more no impossible that I would be
 

2031
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,470
more no impossible that I would be
willing to bet and how well tested are

2032
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:25,480
willing to bet and how well tested are
 

2033
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,549
willing to bet and how well tested are
these interceptors well that's where we

2034
00:47:27,549 --> 00:47:27,559
these interceptors well that's where we
 

2035
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:29,589
these interceptors well that's where we
get the success rate that's around 50%

2036
00:47:29,589 --> 00:47:29,599
get the success rate that's around 50%
 

2037
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,829
get the success rate that's around 50%
because of the test right and actually

2038
00:47:31,829 --> 00:47:31,839
because of the test right and actually
 

2039
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,589
because of the test right and actually
the Interceptor program is are you ready

2040
00:47:33,589 --> 00:47:33,599
the Interceptor program is are you ready
 

2041
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:37,270
the Interceptor program is are you ready
for this it's on strategic pause right

2042
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:37,280
for this it's on strategic pause right
 

2043
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,990
for this it's on strategic pause right
right now meaning the Interceptor

2044
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:39,000
right now meaning the Interceptor
 

2045
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,190
right now meaning the Interceptor
missiles are there but developing them

2046
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:41,200
missiles are there but developing them
 

2047
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,470
missiles are there but developing them
and making them more effective is on

2048
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:43,480
and making them more effective is on
 

2049
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,870
and making them more effective is on
strategic pause because they can't be

2050
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:45,880
strategic pause because they can't be
 

2051
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,190
strategic pause because they can't be
made more effective right people have

2052
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:48,200
made more effective right people have
 

2053
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,030
made more effective right people have
these fantasies that uh we have a system

2054
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:51,040
these fantasies that uh we have a system
 

2055
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,710
these fantasies that uh we have a system
like the Iron Dome and they see this in

2056
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:53,720
like the Iron Dome and they see this in
 

2057
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,390
like the Iron Dome and they see this in
current events and they're like oh our

2058
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:55,400
current events and they're like oh our
 

2059
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,109
current events and they're like oh our
interceptors would do that it's just

2060
00:47:57,109 --> 00:47:57,119
interceptors would do that it's just
 

2061
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:00,390
interceptors would do that it's just
simply not true why why can't an Iron

2062
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:00,400
simply not true why why can't an Iron
 

2063
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,430
simply not true why why can't an Iron
Dome like system be constructed for

2064
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:02,440
Dome like system be constructed for
 

2065
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,030
Dome like system be constructed for
nuclear warheads we have systems I write

2066
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:05,040
nuclear warheads we have systems I write
 

2067
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,710
nuclear warheads we have systems I write
about called the Thad system which is

2068
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:06,720
about called the Thad system which is
 

2069
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,630
about called the Thad system which is
groundbased and then the Eis system

2070
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:08,640
groundbased and then the Eis system
 

2071
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,069
groundbased and then the Eis system
which is on you know vessels and these

2072
00:48:11,069 --> 00:48:11,079
which is on you know vessels and these
 

2073
00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:14,430
which is on you know vessels and these
are great at shooting down some in you

2074
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:14,440
are great at shooting down some in you
 

2075
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,270
are great at shooting down some in you
know some Rockets but they they they can

2076
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:17,280
know some Rockets but they they they can
 

2077
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,270
know some Rockets but they they they can
only shoot them sort of one at a time

2078
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:19,280
only shoot them sort of one at a time
 

2079
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,390
only shoot them sort of one at a time
you cannot shoot the motherload as it's

2080
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:21,400
you cannot shoot the motherload as it's
 

2081
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,710
you cannot shoot the motherload as it's
coming in those are the smaller systems

2082
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:23,720
coming in those are the smaller systems
 

2083
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,790
coming in those are the smaller systems
right the tactical nuclear weapons and

2084
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:25,800
right the tactical nuclear weapons and
 

2085
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,030
right the tactical nuclear weapons and
by the way our systems are all deployed

2086
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:28,040
by the way our systems are all deployed
 

2087
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:30,270
by the way our systems are all deployed
overseas and our egis systems are all

2088
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:30,280
overseas and our egis systems are all
 

2089
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,630
overseas and our egis systems are all
out at Sea and again reporting that I

2090
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:32,640
out at Sea and again reporting that I
 

2091
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,589
out at Sea and again reporting that I
was like wait what you know you have to

2092
00:48:34,589 --> 00:48:34,599
was like wait what you know you have to
 

2093
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:36,750
was like wait what you know you have to
really hunker down are we sure about

2094
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:36,760
really hunker down are we sure about
 

2095
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,910
really hunker down are we sure about
this people really don't want to believe

2096
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:38,920
this people really don't want to believe
 

2097
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,510
this people really don't want to believe
this it's an actual fact after 911

2098
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:41,520
this it's an actual fact after 911
 

2099
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,990
this it's an actual fact after 911
Congress considered putting and you know

2100
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:44,000
Congress considered putting and you know
 

2101
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,670
Congress considered putting and you know
egis missiles and maybe even Thad

2102
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:45,680
egis missiles and maybe even Thad
 

2103
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,990
egis missiles and maybe even Thad
systems along the west coast of the

2104
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:47,000
systems along the west coast of the
 

2105
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,349
systems along the west coast of the
United States to specifically deal with

2106
00:48:49,349 --> 00:48:49,359
United States to specifically deal with
 

2107
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,270
United States to specifically deal with
the threats against nuclear armed North

2108
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:51,280
the threats against nuclear armed North
 

2109
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,750
the threats against nuclear armed North
Korea but it hasn't done so yet and

2110
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:53,760
Korea but it hasn't done so yet and
 

2111
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,150
Korea but it hasn't done so yet and
again you have to ask yourself wait a

2112
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:55,160
again you have to ask yourself wait a
 

2113
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,589
again you have to ask yourself wait a
minute this is insanity you know one

2114
00:48:57,589 --> 00:48:57,599
minute this is insanity you know one
 

2115
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,710
minute this is insanity you know one
nuclear weapon Gets By any of these

2116
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:00,720
nuclear weapon Gets By any of these
 

2117
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,309
nuclear weapon Gets By any of these
systems and it's full out nuclear

2118
00:49:03,309 --> 00:49:03,319
systems and it's full out nuclear
 

2119
00:49:03,319 --> 00:49:05,150
systems and it's full out nuclear
warfare

2120
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:05,160
warfare
 

2121
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,150
warfare
so that's not the solution more nuclear

2122
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:08,160
so that's not the solution more nuclear
 

2123
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,789
so that's not the solution more nuclear
weapons is not the

2124
00:49:09,789 --> 00:49:09,799
weapons is not the
 

2125
00:49:09,799 --> 00:49:12,030
weapons is not the
solution I'm looking for a hopeful thing

2126
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:12,040
solution I'm looking for a hopeful thing
 

2127
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:14,710
solution I'm looking for a hopeful thing
here about North Korea uh how many

2128
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:14,720
here about North Korea uh how many
 

2129
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,630
here about North Korea uh how many
deployed nuclear warheads does North

2130
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:16,640
deployed nuclear warheads does North
 

2131
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,710
deployed nuclear warheads does North
Korea have so does the current system

2132
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:19,720
Korea have so does the current system
 

2133
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,030
Korea have so does the current system
with as we described it uh the

2134
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:22,040
with as we described it uh the
 

2135
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,270
with as we described it uh the
interceptors and so on have a hope

2136
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:24,280
interceptors and so on have a hope
 

2137
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:28,190
interceptors and so on have a hope
against the North Korean attack the one

2138
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:28,200
against the North Korean attack the one
 

2139
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,190
against the North Korean attack the one
that you mentioned people are worried

2140
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:30,200
that you mentioned people are worried
 

2141
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:35,630
that you mentioned people are worried
about so they North Korea has 50 let's

2142
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:35,640
about so they North Korea has 50 let's
 

2143
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:40,270
about so they North Korea has 50 let's
say 50 nuclear weapons right now some

2144
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:40,280
say 50 nuclear weapons right now some
 

2145
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:43,069
say 50 nuclear weapons right now some
NOS put it at more than a 100 it's it's

2146
00:49:43,069 --> 00:49:43,079
NOS put it at more than a 100 it's it's
 

2147
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:45,510
NOS put it at more than a 100 it's it's
impossible to know because North Korea's

2148
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:45,520
impossible to know because North Korea's
 

2149
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,710
impossible to know because North Korea's
nuclear weapons program has no

2150
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:47,720
nuclear weapons program has no
 

2151
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:50,910
nuclear weapons program has no
transparency they're the only nuclear

2152
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:50,920
transparency they're the only nuclear
 

2153
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,589
transparency they're the only nuclear
armed nation that doesn't announce when

2154
00:49:53,589 --> 00:49:53,599
armed nation that doesn't announce when
 

2155
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,630
armed nation that doesn't announce when
they do a ballistic missile test

2156
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:55,640
they do a ballistic missile test
 

2157
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,549
they do a ballistic missile test
everyone else does no one wants to start

2158
00:49:57,549 --> 00:49:57,559
everyone else does no one wants to start
 

2159
00:49:57,559 --> 00:49:59,750
everyone else does no one wants to start
a nuclear war by accident right so if

2160
00:49:59,750 --> 00:49:59,760
a nuclear war by accident right so if
 

2161
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,230
a nuclear war by accident right so if
Russia's going to launch an ICBM they

2162
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:01,240
Russia's going to launch an ICBM they
 

2163
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,270
Russia's going to launch an ICBM they
tell us if we're going to launch one and

2164
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:03,280
tell us if we're going to launch one and
 

2165
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,270
tell us if we're going to launch one and
I'm I'm talking test runs here you know

2166
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:05,280
I'm I'm talking test runs here you know
 

2167
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,670
I'm I'm talking test runs here you know
with the dummy Warhead we we tell them

2168
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:07,680
with the dummy Warhead we we tell them
 

2169
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,309
with the dummy Warhead we we tell them
not North Korea that's a fact okay so

2170
00:50:11,309 --> 00:50:11,319
not North Korea that's a fact okay so
 

2171
00:50:11,319 --> 00:50:14,190
not North Korea that's a fact okay so
we're constantly up against the fear of

2172
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:14,200
we're constantly up against the fear of
 

2173
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,950
we're constantly up against the fear of
North Korea in the scenario I have the

2174
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:16,960
North Korea in the scenario I have the
 

2175
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,510
North Korea in the scenario I have the
incoming North Korean one Megaton you

2176
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:20,520
incoming North Korean one Megaton you
 

2177
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:23,589
incoming North Korean one Megaton you
know weapon coming in and the

2178
00:50:23,589 --> 00:50:23,599
know weapon coming in and the
 

2179
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,950
know weapon coming in and the
Interceptor system tries to shoot it

2180
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:25,960
Interceptor system tries to shoot it
 

2181
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:29,150
Interceptor system tries to shoot it
down so there there's not enough time

2182
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:29,160
down so there there's not enough time
 

2183
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,990
down so there there's not enough time
and this by the way I ran through by all

2184
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:31,000
and this by the way I ran through by all
 

2185
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,390
and this by the way I ran through by all
you know generals from the Pentagon who

2186
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:33,400
you know generals from the Pentagon who
 

2187
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:36,950
you know generals from the Pentagon who
run these scenarios for no red right and

2188
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:36,960
run these scenarios for no red right and
 

2189
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,910
run these scenarios for no red right and
confirmed all of this as fact this is

2190
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:38,920
confirmed all of this as fact this is
 

2191
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,710
confirmed all of this as fact this is
not this is this is this is the

2192
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:40,720
not this is this is this is the
 

2193
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,230
not this is this is this is the
situation right so in the scenario I

2194
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:44,240
situation right so in the scenario I
 

2195
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,150
situation right so in the scenario I
have the nuclear ICBM coming in the

2196
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:47,160
have the nuclear ICBM coming in the
 

2197
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,910
have the nuclear ICBM coming in the
Interceptor missiles try to shoot down

2198
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:48,920
Interceptor missiles try to shoot down
 

2199
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,190
Interceptor missiles try to shoot down
the Warhead the capability is is not

2200
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:52,200
the Warhead the capability is is not
 

2201
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,190
the Warhead the capability is is not
like what's called Shoot you know and

2202
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:54,200
like what's called Shoot you know and
 

2203
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,309
like what's called Shoot you know and
look they can't there's not enough time

2204
00:50:56,309 --> 00:50:56,319
look they can't there's not enough time
 

2205
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,589
look they can't there's not enough time
to go like and we're going to try to get

2206
00:50:58,589 --> 00:50:58,599
to go like and we're going to try to get
 

2207
00:50:58,599 --> 00:51:00,150
to go like and we're going to try to get
it we missed it okay let's go for

2208
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:00,160
it we missed it okay let's go for
 

2209
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,430
it we missed it okay let's go for

a system at the Pentagon and so this
 

2305
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,910
a system at the Pentagon and so this

beneath stratcom because they're
 

2311
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,750
beneath stratcom because they're
connected as being real and then it was

the neck of time that it was it was an
error and that's one of five examples

2330
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:36,000
error and that's one of five examples
 

2331
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,829
error and that's one of five examples
can you speak to maybe um is there any

scenarios that the Pentagon runs I'd

2422

mean again they are very classified

2426
00:55:56,069 --> 00:55:56,079
mean again they are very classified
 

2427
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:58,069
mean again they are very classified
right I mean it was interesting coming

2428
00:55:58,069 --> 00:55:58,079
right I mean it was interesting coming
 

2429

war gaming scenarios they're almost all

2440
00:56:14,109 --> 00:56:14,119
war gaming scenarios they're almost all
 

2441
00:56:14,119 --> 00:56:16,470
war gaming scenarios they're almost all
still classified one of them was

2442
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:16,480
still classified one of them was
 

2443
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,029
still classified one of them was
Declassified recently if you can call it

2444
00:56:19,029 --> 00:56:19,039
Declassified recently if you can call it
 

2445
00:56:19,039 --> 00:56:21,470
Declassified recently if you can call it
that I show an image of it in the book

2446
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:21,480
that I show an image of it in the book
 

2447
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,230
that I show an image of it in the book
and it's just basically

2448
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:23,240
and it's just basically
 

2449
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:26,870
and it's just basically
like almost all almost entirely redact

2450
00:56:26,870 --> 00:56:26,880
like almost all almost entirely redact
 

2451
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,430
like almost all almost entirely redact
and then like there'll be a date you

2452
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:28,440
and then like there'll be a date you
 

2453
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:31,990
and then like there'll be a date you
know or it'll say like phase one um and

2454
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:32,000
know or it'll say like phase one um and
 

2455
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,109
know or it'll say like phase one um and
that one was called proud profit but

2456
00:56:34,109 --> 00:56:34,119
that one was called proud profit but
 

2457
00:56:34,119 --> 00:56:35,510
that one was called proud profit but
what was incredible about the

2458
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:35,520
what was incredible about the
 

2459
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,789
what was incredible about the
declassification process of that is it

2460
00:56:37,789 --> 00:56:37,799
declassification process of that is it
 

2461
00:56:37,799 --> 00:56:39,510
declassification process of that is it
allowed allowed a couple of people who

2462
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:39,520
allowed allowed a couple of people who
 

2463
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,910
allowed allowed a couple of people who
were there to talk about it okay and

2464
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:41,920
were there to talk about it okay and
 

2465
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,990
were there to talk about it okay and
that's why we have that information and

2466
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:44,000
that's why we have that information and
 

2467
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,710
that's why we have that information and
I write about proud profit in the book

2468
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:45,720
I write about proud profit in the book
 

2469
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:48,349
I write about proud profit in the book
because it was super significant in many

war well you've raised a really
 

2957
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:48,109
war well you've raised a really
important question that we look to the

01:07:48,109 --> 01:07:48,119
important question that we look to the

important question that we look to the
historical record for that answer right

2960

historical record for that answer right
 

2961

him right like you do all the footwork
to know what questions to ask and then

to know what questions to ask and then
 

3667
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:07,629
to know what questions to ask and then
you take the very specific questions to

you take the very specific questions to
 

3669
01:24:07,639 --> 01:24:10,910

01:24:17,830 --> 01:24:17,840
and it's very similar to ours because
 

3675

his background and he comes from the
intelligence world right so my

3776
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:25,760
intelligence world right so my
 

3777
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,270
intelligence world right so my
experience in

3778
01:26:27,270 --> 01:26:27,280
experience in
 

3779
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:30,310
experience in
interviewing oldtimers who spent decades

3780
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:30,320
interviewing oldtimers who spent decades
 

3781
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:34,070
interviewing oldtimers who spent decades
working for the CIA or even nro or

3782
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:34,080
working for the CIA or even nro or
 

3783
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:36,510
working for the CIA or even nro or
NSA I know the way they think from

3784
01:26:36,510 --> 01:26:36,520
NSA I know the way they think from
 

3785
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:37,750
NSA I know the way they think from
having spent hundreds of hours

3786
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:37,760
having spent hundreds of hours
 

3787
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,950
having spent hundreds of hours
interviewing them right and then I know

3788
01:26:39,950 --> 01:26:39,960
interviewing them right and then I know
 

3789
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:44,669
interviewing them right and then I know
the way that you know military men think

3790
01:26:44,669 --> 01:26:44,679
the way that you know military men think
 

3791
01:26:44,679 --> 01:26:47,550
the way that you know military men think
and it's very different right so Putin's

3792
01:26:47,550 --> 01:26:47,560
and it's very different right so Putin's
 

3793
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:50,830
and it's very different right so Putin's
not a military person per se he's an

3794
01:26:50,830 --> 01:26:50,840
not a military person per se he's an
 

3795
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:53,910
not a military person per se he's an
intelligence officer so what con would

3796
01:26:53,910 --> 01:26:53,920
intelligence officer so what con would
 

3797
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:55,390
intelligence officer so what con would
concern concern me there if I had to

3798
01:26:55,390 --> 01:26:55,400
concern concern me there if I had to
 

3799
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:57,470
concern concern me there if I had to
guess about his mindset has to do with

3800
01:26:57,470 --> 01:26:57,480
guess about his mindset has to do with
 

3801
01:26:57,480 --> 01:27:00,870
guess about his mindset has to do with
paranoia right most Intelligence

3802
01:27:00,870 --> 01:27:00,880
paranoia right most Intelligence
 

3803
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:04,790
paranoia right most Intelligence
Officers must have a degree of healthy

3804
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:04,800
Officers must have a degree of healthy
 

3805
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,830
Officers must have a degree of healthy
paranoia or they're going to wind up

3806
01:27:06,830 --> 01:27:06,840
paranoia or they're going to wind up
 

3807
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:10,350
paranoia or they're going to wind up
dead right and so that's not a great

3808
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:10,360
dead right and so that's not a great
 

3809
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:12,390
dead right and so that's not a great
quality to have you would be more

3810
01:27:12,390 --> 01:27:12,400
quality to have you would be more
 

3811
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:15,149
quality to have you would be more
trigger happy perhaps so you're more you

3812
01:27:15,149 --> 01:27:15,159
trigger happy perhaps so you're more you
 

3813
01:27:15,159 --> 01:27:17,149
trigger happy perhaps so you're more you
would be more prone to respond to

3814
01:27:17,149 --> 01:27:17,159
would be more prone to respond to
 

3815
01:27:17,159 --> 01:27:20,149
would be more prone to respond to
erroneous signals and and you'd be

3816
01:27:20,149 --> 01:27:20,159
erroneous signals and and you'd be
 

3817
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:22,310
erroneous signals and and you'd be
suspicious and you can see that now

3818
01:27:22,310 --> 01:27:22,320
suspicious and you can see that now
 

3819
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:25,950
suspicious and you can see that now
there's a such a you know

3820
01:27:25,950 --> 01:27:25,960
there's a such a you know
 

3821
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:32,189
there's a such a you know
incredible distrust and and and sort of

3822
01:27:32,189 --> 01:27:32,199
incredible distrust and and and sort of
 

3823
01:27:32,199 --> 01:27:34,950
incredible distrust and and and sort of
real conflict

3824
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:34,960
real conflict
 

3825
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:38,830
real conflict
between Russia between its leader and

3826
01:27:38,830 --> 01:27:38,840
between Russia between its leader and
 

3827
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:41,510
between Russia between its leader and
NATO between its leader and all of the

01:27:41,510 --> 01:27:41,520
NATO between its leader and all of the
 

3829
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:45,470
NATO between its leader and all of the
West and then that is fueled by his

3830
01:27:45,470 --> 01:27:45,480
West and then that is fueled by his
 

3831
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:47,070
West and then that is fueled by his
closest

01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:51,470

advisers um kind of you know seem they

3834
01:27:51,470 --> 01:27:51,480
advisers um kind of you know seem they
 

3835
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:53,790
advisers um kind of you know seem they
seem to be from the statements they have

3836
01:27:53,790 --> 01:27:53,800
seem to be from the statements they have
 

3837
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:56,189
seem to be from the statements they have
made that I've read in Translation they

3838
01:27:56,189 --> 01:27:56,199
made that I've read in Translation they
 

3839
01:27:56,199 --> 01:27:59,149
made that I've read in Translation they
seem to be fostering that same idea that

3840
01:27:59,149 --> 01:27:59,159
seem to be fostering that same idea that
 

3841
01:27:59,159 --> 01:28:02,270
seem to be fostering that same idea that
you know NATO really has it in for

3842
01:28:02,270 --> 01:28:02,280
you know NATO really has it in for
 

3843
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:06,109
you know NATO really has it in for
Russia the America really has it in and

3844
01:28:06,109 --> 01:28:06,119
Russia the America really has it in and
 

3845
01:28:06,119 --> 01:28:09,669
Russia the America really has it in and
that is so dangerous and disheartening

3846
01:28:09,669 --> 01:28:09,679
that is so dangerous and disheartening
 

3847
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:11,709
that is so dangerous and disheartening
and perhaps makes it less likely that

3848
01:28:11,709 --> 01:28:11,719
and perhaps makes it less likely that
 

3849
01:28:11,719 --> 01:28:13,990
and perhaps makes it less likely that
the president would pick up the phone

plummets right right and there are all
kinds of papers that have been written

4406
01:41:25,990 --> 01:41:26,000
kinds of papers that have been written
 

4407
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:30,229
kinds of papers that have been written
about this using modern calcul you know

4408
01:41:30,229 --> 01:41:30,239
about this using modern calcul you know
 

4409
01:41:30,239 --> 01:41:34,470
about this using modern calcul you know
systems and the numbers vary but the

4410
01:41:34,470 --> 01:41:34,480
systems and the numbers vary but the
 

4411
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:37,709
systems and the numbers vary but the
bottom line is agriculture fails mhm

4412
01:41:37,709 --> 01:41:37,719
bottom line is agriculture fails mhm
 

4413
01:41:37,719 --> 01:41:40,550
bottom line is agriculture fails mhm
Foods obviously uh

4414
01:41:40,550 --> 01:41:40,560
Foods obviously uh
 

4415
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:43,229
Foods obviously uh
dies uh so the agriculture system

4416
01:41:43,229 --> 01:41:43,239
dies uh so the agriculture system
 

4417
01:41:43,239 --> 01:41:44,870
dies uh so the agriculture system
completely shuts down so the food

4418
01:41:44,870 --> 01:41:44,880
completely shuts down so the food
 

4419
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:48,350
completely shuts down so the food
sources shut down so there's no food

4420
01:41:48,350 --> 01:41:48,360
sources shut down so there's no food
 

4421
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:49,830

there's no sun temperature drops

4422
01:41:49,830 --> 01:41:49,840
there's no sun temperature drops
 

4423
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:51,709
there's no sun temperature drops
completely no

spoken of radiation poisoning because

4428
01:41:55,470 --> 01:41:55,480
spoken of radiation poisoning because
 

4429
01:41:55,480 --> 01:41:57,830
spoken of radiation poisoning because
you know the radiation poisoning kills

4430
01:41:57,830 --> 01:41:57,840
you know the radiation poisoning kills
 

4431
01:41:57,840 --> 01:41:59,870
you know the radiation poisoning kills
many people in the aftermath of the

4432
01:41:59,870 --> 01:41:59,880
many people in the aftermath of the
 

4433
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:03,149
many people in the aftermath of the
nuclear the nuclear exchange but after

01:42:03,149 --> 01:42:03,159
nuclear the nuclear exchange but after
 

4435
01:42:03,159 --> 01:42:06,070
nuclear the nuclear exchange but after
the nuclear freeze ends after nuclear

winter you know after the Sun starts to

4438
01:42:08,310 --> 01:42:08,320
winter you know after the Sun starts to
 

4439
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:11,390

now you have no ozone layer or you have

4442
01:42:13,470 --> 01:42:13,480
now you have no ozone layer or you have
 

4443
01:42:13,480 --> 01:42:16,189
now you have no ozone layer or you have
a severely depleted ozone layer and so

4444
01:42:16,189 --> 01:42:16,199
a severely depleted ozone layer and so
 

4445
01:42:16,199 --> 01:42:18,950
a severely depleted ozone layer and so
the sun's rays are now poisonous so you

4446
01:42:18,950 --> 01:42:18,960
the sun's rays are now poisonous so you
 

4447
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:21,070
the sun's rays are now poisonous so you
have people living underground and you

4448
01:42:21,070 --> 01:42:21,080
have people living underground and you
 

4449
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:22,910
have people living underground and you
have this great thawing and with that

4450
01:42:22,910 --> 01:42:22,920
have this great thawing and with that
 

4451
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:26,310
have this great thawing and with that
great thawing comes pathogens and plague

4452
01:42:26,310 --> 01:42:26,320
great thawing comes pathogens and plague
 

4453
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:29,270
great thawing comes pathogens and plague
and you have this you know system where

4454
01:42:29,270 --> 01:42:29,280
and you have this you know system where
 

4455
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:31,510
and you have this you know system where
the small-bodied animals the insects and

4456
01:42:31,510 --> 01:42:31,520
the small-bodied animals the insects and
 

4457
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:33,470
the small-bodied animals the insects and
whatnot begin reproducing really fast

4458
01:42:33,470 --> 01:42:33,480
whatnot begin reproducing really fast
 

4459
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:35,350
whatnot begin reproducing really fast
and the larger body animals like you and

4460
01:42:35,350 --> 01:42:35,360
and the larger body animals like you and
 

4461
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:38,750
and the larger body animals like you and
me begin to go extinct Professor ton

4462
01:42:38,750 --> 01:42:38,760
me begin to go extinct Professor ton
 

4463

70% of the species and nuclear war would

70% of the species and nuclear war would
 

4473
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:54,550
70% of the species and nuclear war would
likely do the same and so here we are

4474
01:42:54,550 --> 01:42:54,560
likely do the same and so here we are
 

4475
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:56,830
likely do the same and so here we are
talking about this because there is a

4476
01:42:56,830 --> 01:42:56,840
talking about this because there is a
 

4477
01:42:56,840 --> 01:42:58,589
talking about this because there is a
difference there's nothing you can do

4478
01:42:58,589 --> 01:42:58,599
difference there's nothing you can do
 

4479
01:42:58,599 --> 01:43:00,870
difference there's nothing you can do
about an asteroid but there is something

4480
01:43:00,870 --> 01:43:00,880
about an asteroid but there is something
 

4481
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:03,390
about an asteroid but there is something
you can do about a nuclear

4482
01:43:03,390 --> 01:43:03,400
you can do about a nuclear
 

4483
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:05,990
you can do about a nuclear
war do you think it's possible that some

4484
01:43:05,990 --> 01:43:06,000
war do you think it's possible that some
 

4485
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:09,149
war do you think it's possible that some
humans will survive all of this so if we

4486
01:43:09,149 --> 01:43:09,159
humans will survive all of this so if we
 

4487
01:43:09,159 --> 01:43:12,149
humans will survive all of this so if we
look I mean how long would it

4488
01:43:12,149 --> 01:43:12,159
look I mean how long would it
 

4489
01:43:12,159 --> 01:43:14,990
look I mean how long would it
be uh would it be decades would it be

4490
01:43:14,990 --> 01:43:15,000
be uh would it be decades would it be
 

4491
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,750

you know I do think all
 

4723
01:48:14,719 --> 01:48:19,149
you know I do think all
things come from what happens you know

4724
01:48:19,149 --> 01:48:19,159
things come from what happens you know

the quote what Einstein is said to have
 

4745
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:49,709
the quote what Einstein is said to have
said which is that he was

01:48:49,709 --> 01:48:49,719
said which is that he was
 

4747
01:48:49,719 --> 01:48:53,510
said which is that he was

asked what weapons World War three would
 

4749

stones let me ask you about the great

4756
01:49:07,550 --> 01:49:07,560
stones let me ask you about the great
 

4757
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:10,149
stones let me ask you about the great
filter when you look

4758
01:49:10,149 --> 01:49:10,159
filter when you look
 

4759
01:49:10,159 --> 01:49:13,589
filter when you look
up into our galaxy into our

4760
01:49:13,589 --> 01:49:13,599
up into our galaxy into our
 

4761
01:49:13,599 --> 01:49:16,510
up into our galaxy into our
universe look up at the

4762
01:49:16,510 --> 01:49:16,520
universe look up at the
 

4763
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:19,709
universe look up at the
sky do you think uh there's other alien

4764
01:49:19,709 --> 01:49:19,719
sky do you think uh there's other alien
 

4765
01:49:19,719 --> 01:49:21,870
sky do you think uh there's other alien
civilizations that are contending with

4766
01:49:21,870 --> 01:49:21,880
civilizations that are contending with
 

4767
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:24,470
civilizations that are contending with
some similar question questions and

4768
01:49:24,470 --> 01:49:24,480
some similar question questions and
 

4769
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:27,270
some similar question questions and
perhaps the reason we have not

4770
01:49:27,270 --> 01:49:27,280
perhaps the reason we have not
 

4771
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:31,030
perhaps the reason we have not
definitively seen alien civilizations is

4772
01:49:31,030 --> 01:49:31,040
definitively seen alien civilizations is
 

4773
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:34,390
definitively seen alien civilizations is
because the others have failed to find a

4774
01:49:34,390 --> 01:49:34,400
because the others have failed to find a
 

4775
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:36,629
because the others have failed to find a
solution to this great filter something

4776
01:49:36,629 --> 01:49:36,639
solution to this great filter something
 

4777
01:49:36,639 --> 01:49:39,669
solution to this great filter something
like nuclear

4778
01:49:39,669 --> 01:49:39,679

 

4779
01:49:39,679 --> 01:49:41,910

weapons I'm not sure I'm going have to

4780
01:49:41,910 --> 01:49:41,920
weapons I'm not sure I'm going have to
 

4781
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:45,030
weapons I'm not sure I'm going have to
think about that

4782
01:49:45,030 --> 01:49:45,040

 

4783
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:47,629

question but what I what does come to

4784
01:49:47,629 --> 01:49:47,639
question but what I what does come to
 

4785
01:49:47,639 --> 01:49:50,430
question but what I what does come to
mind is an answer that was given to me

4786
01:49:50,430 --> 01:49:50,440
mind is an answer that was given to me
 

4787
01:49:50,440 --> 01:49:53,270
mind is an answer that was given to me
similarly right but

4788
01:49:53,270 --> 01:49:53,280
similarly right but
 

4789
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:56,189
similarly right but
by a man by Ed Mitchell who went to the

4790
01:49:56,189 --> 01:49:56,199
by a man by Ed Mitchell who went to the
 

4791
01:49:56,199 --> 01:50:01,189
by a man by Ed Mitchell who went to the
moon right um and he was the sixth man

4792
01:50:01,189 --> 01:50:01,199
moon right um and he was the sixth man
 

4793
01:50:01,199 --> 01:50:02,229
moon right um and he was the sixth man
to walk on the

4794
01:50:02,229 --> 01:50:02,239
to walk on the
 

4795
01:50:02,239 --> 01:50:05,390
to walk on the
moon and so his opinion I think might

4796
01:50:05,390 --> 01:50:05,400
moon and so his opinion I think might
 

4797
01:50:05,400 --> 01:50:07,229
moon and so his opinion I think might
count a little more than mine on that

4798
01:50:07,229 --> 01:50:07,239
count a little more than mine on that
 

4799
01:50:07,239 --> 01:50:11,070
count a little more than mine on that
subject because his lens is so much

4800
01:50:11,070 --> 01:50:11,080
subject because his lens is so much
 

4801
01:50:11,080 --> 01:50:16,189
subject because his lens is so much
greater right and Mitchell

4802
01:50:16,189 --> 01:50:16,199
greater right and Mitchell
 

4803
01:50:16,199 --> 01:50:19,310
greater right and Mitchell
was vilified when he got back from the

4804
01:50:19,310 --> 01:50:19,320
was vilified when he got back from the
 

4805
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:21,950
was vilified when he got back from the
Moon because it became known that he

4806
01:50:21,950 --> 01:50:21,960
Moon because it became known that he
 

4807
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:23,310
Moon because it became known that he
believed in

4808
01:50:23,310 --> 01:50:23,320
believed in
 

4809
01:50:23,320 --> 01:50:25,709
believed in
things like extrasensory

things like extrasensory
 

4811
01:50:25,719 --> 01:50:28,790
things like extrasensory
perception and this kind of

4812
01:50:28,790 --> 01:50:28,800
perception and this kind of
 

4813
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:32,149
perception and this kind of
mystical metaphysical way of looking at

4814
01:50:32,149 --> 01:50:32,159
mystical metaphysical way of looking at
 

4815
01:50:32,159 --> 01:50:35,870
mystical metaphysical way of looking at
the world and he he really suffered from

01:50:35,870 --> 01:50:35,880
the world and he he really suffered from
 

4817
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:37,510
the world and he he really suffered from
that I mean he was ridiculed and he lost

that I mean he was ridiculed and he lost
 

4819
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:40,910
that I mean he was ridiculed and he lost
a lot of his career and his friends but

4820
01:50:40,910 --> 01:50:40,920
a lot of his career and his friends but
 

4821
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:43,270
a lot of his career and his friends but
what he said to me in our

what he said to me in our
 

4823
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:46,069
what he said to me in our

I think in an in a way I might want to

I think in an in a way I might want to

01:50:58,350 --> 01:50:58,360
he said
 

4835
01:50:58,360 --> 01:51:01,550
he said
that as they were returning from the

Earth he looked down at the Earth and

4840
01:51:07,669 --> 01:51:07,679
Earth he looked down at the Earth and
 

4841
01:51:07,679 --> 01:51:09,229
Earth he looked down at the Earth and
and I'm paraphrasing him I write all

4842
01:51:09,229 --> 01:51:09,239
and I'm paraphrasing him I write all
 

4843
01:51:09,239 --> 01:51:11,510
and I'm paraphrasing him I write all
this in in phenomena an earlier book but

4844
01:51:11,510 --> 01:51:11,520
this in in phenomena an earlier book but
 

4845
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:14,030
this in in phenomena an earlier book but
he the paraphrasing is that he looked

4846
01:51:14,030 --> 01:51:14,040
he the paraphrasing is that he looked
 

4847
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:16,669
he the paraphrasing is that he looked
down from the earth and he and it was

4848
01:51:16,669 --> 01:51:16,679
down from the earth and he and it was
 

4849
01:51:16,679 --> 01:51:18,709
down from the earth and he and it was
1971 and he thought about all the

4850
01:51:18,709 --> 01:51:18,719
1971 and he thought about all the
 

4851
01:51:18,719 --> 01:51:21,990
1971 and he thought about all the
conflict going on down below

4852
01:51:21,990 --> 01:51:22,000
conflict going on down below
 

4853
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:23,629
conflict going on down below
particularly the Vietnam War where many

4854
01:51:23,629 --> 01:51:23,639
particularly the Vietnam War where many
 

4855
01:51:23,639 --> 01:51:27,390
particularly the Vietnam War where many
of his friends were and then he looked

4856
01:51:27,390 --> 01:51:27,400
of his friends were and then he looked
 

4857
01:51:27,400 --> 01:51:30,790
of his friends were and then he looked
behind him into the great vast

4858
01:51:30,790 --> 01:51:30,800
behind him into the great vast
 

4859
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:34,430
behind him into the great vast
Galaxy and he had a moment he says that

4860
01:51:34,430 --> 01:51:34,440
Galaxy and he had a moment he says that
 

4861
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:36,750
Galaxy and he had a moment he says that
was like an epiphany like not a

01:51:36,750 --> 01:51:36,760
was like an epiphany like not a
 

4863
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:38,910
was like an epiphany like not a
near-death experience but a sort of near

01:51:38,910 --> 01:51:38,920
near-death experience but a sort of near
 

4865
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:42,270
near-death experience but a sort of near
life experience right where he believed

01:51:42,270 --> 01:51:42,280
life experience right where he believed
 

4867
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:45,310
life experience right where he believed
that the human consciousness which is

about metaphysics

about metaphysics

and uh ESP perhaps come from Mitchell's

theory was that human consciousness the

01:52:01,719 --> 01:52:05,350
the way to understand it was had
something to do with realizing that

4880
01:52:05,350 --> 01:52:05,360
something to do with realizing that
 

4881
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:08,589
something to do with realizing that
man's inner life and man's outer life

4882
01:52:08,589 --> 01:52:08,599
man's inner life and man's outer life
 

4883
01:52:08,599 --> 01:52:11,750
man's inner life and man's outer life
are deeply connected in the same way

4884
01:52:11,750 --> 01:52:11,760
are deeply connected in the same way
 

4885
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:13,790
are deeply connected in the same way
that man is connected to the

4886
01:52:13,790 --> 01:52:13,800
that man is connected to the
 

4887
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:16,229
that man is connected to the
Galaxy and he said it much more

4888
01:52:16,229 --> 01:52:16,239
Galaxy and he said it much more
 

4889
01:52:16,239 --> 01:52:20,109
Galaxy and he said it much more
eloquently but you kind of get the idea

4890
01:52:20,109 --> 01:52:20,119
eloquently but you kind of get the idea
 

4891
01:52:20,119 --> 01:52:22,310
eloquently but you kind of get the idea
that and I think it's why humans have

4892
01:52:22,310 --> 01:52:22,320
that and I think it's why humans have
 

4893
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:25,550
that and I think it's why humans have
always always love to look up right um

4894
01:52:25,550 --> 01:52:25,560
always always love to look up right um
 

4895
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:28,550
always always love to look up right um
that that there's more there and it's a

4896
01:52:28,550 --> 01:52:28,560
that that there's more there and it's a
 

4897
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:29,990
that that there's more there and it's a
bit like the wish it's like it's like

4898
01:52:29,990 --> 01:52:30,000
bit like the wish it's like it's like
 

4899
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,669
bit like the wish it's like it's like
the big version of the wishing tree you

4900
01:52:31,669 --> 01:52:31,679
the big version of the wishing tree you
 

4901
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:35,310
the big version of the wishing tree you
know what do I wish for for myself and

4902
01:52:35,310 --> 01:52:35,320
know what do I wish for for myself and
 

4903
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:38,149
know what do I wish for for myself and
what is maybe perhaps the the

4904
01:52:38,149 --> 01:52:38,159
what is maybe perhaps the the
 

4905
01:52:38,159 --> 01:52:40,990
what is maybe perhaps the the
realignment of thinking for those of us

4906
01:52:40,990 --> 01:52:41,000
realignment of thinking for those of us
 

4907
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,390
realignment of thinking for those of us
in search of Happiness right and rather

4908
01:52:43,390 --> 01:52:43,400
in search of Happiness right and rather
 

4909
01:52:43,400 --> 01:52:44,950
in search of Happiness right and rather
instead of war

4910
01:52:44,950 --> 01:52:44,960
instead of war
 

4911
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:46,990
instead of war
is

4912
01:52:46,990 --> 01:52:47,000
is
 

4913
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:51,550
is
um you know what does it mean to have a

4914
01:52:51,550 --> 01:52:51,560
um you know what does it mean to have a
 

4915
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:53,709
um you know what does it mean to have a
conscience to have

4916
01:52:53,709 --> 01:52:53,719
conscience to have
 

4917
01:52:53,719 --> 01:52:55,750
conscience to have
Consciousness what does it mean to be a

4918
01:52:55,750 --> 01:52:55,760
Consciousness what does it mean to be a
 

4919
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:57,550
Consciousness what does it mean to be a
thinking person what does it mean to be

4920
01:52:57,550 --> 01:52:57,560
thinking person what does it mean to be
 

4921
01:52:57,560 --> 01:53:01,750
thinking person what does it mean to be
on this Earth to Born to be born to live

4922
01:53:01,750 --> 01:53:01,760
on this Earth to Born to be born to live
 

4923
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:04,550
on this Earth to Born to be born to live
to die and then there is legacy and so

4924
01:53:04,550 --> 01:53:04,560
to die and then there is legacy and so
 

4925
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:06,470
to die and then there is legacy and so
all of those

4926
01:53:06,470 --> 01:53:06,480
all of those
 

4927
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:08,430
all of those
ideas

4928
01:53:08,430 --> 01:53:08,440
ideas
 

4929
01:53:08,440 --> 01:53:13,030
ideas
are I think Foster the kind of

4930
01:53:13,030 --> 01:53:13,040
are I think Foster the kind of
 

4931
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:17,510
are I think Foster the kind of
conversation that would that deescalate

4932
01:53:17,510 --> 01:53:17,520
conversation that would that deescalate
 

4933
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:21,270
conversation that would that deescalate
conflict yeah so in some deep way so the

4934
01:53:21,270 --> 01:53:21,280
conflict yeah so in some deep way so the
 

4935
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:22,750
conflict yeah so in some deep way so the
mysteries of what's out there when we

4936
01:53:22,750 --> 01:53:22,760
mysteries of what's out there when we
 

4937
01:53:22,760 --> 01:53:24,350
mysteries of what's out there when we
look out to the

4938
01:53:24,350 --> 01:53:24,360
look out to the
 

4939
01:53:24,360 --> 01:53:26,830
look out to the
Stars uh are the same

4940
01:53:26,830 --> 01:53:26,840
Stars uh are the same
 

4941
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:30,709
Stars uh are the same
Mysteries that uh we find in when trying

4942
01:53:30,709 --> 01:53:30,719
Mysteries that uh we find in when trying
 

4943
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:32,310
Mysteries that uh we find in when trying
to understand the human

4944
01:53:32,310 --> 01:53:32,320
to understand the human
 

4945
01:53:32,320 --> 01:53:35,069
to understand the human
mind and they're they're coupled in some

4946
01:53:35,069 --> 01:53:35,079
mind and they're they're coupled in some
 

4947
01:53:35,079 --> 01:53:38,030
mind and they're they're coupled in some
way for me thinking about alien

4948
01:53:38,030 --> 01:53:38,040
way for me thinking about alien
 

4949
01:53:38,040 --> 01:53:40,790
way for me thinking about alien
civilizations out there is really the

4950
01:53:40,790 --> 01:53:40,800
civilizations out there is really the
 

4951
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:42,470
civilizations out there is really the
same kind of

4952
01:53:42,470 --> 01:53:42,480
same kind of
 

4953
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:45,310
same kind of
question which is what what are we what

4954
01:53:45,310 --> 01:53:45,320
question which is what what are we what
 

4955
01:53:45,320 --> 01:53:48,069
question which is what what are we what
is this what what are we doing here how

4956
01:53:48,069 --> 01:53:48,079
is this what what are we doing here how
 

4957
01:53:48,079 --> 01:53:49,510
is this what what are we doing here how
do we come

4958
01:53:49,510 --> 01:53:49,520
do we come
 

4959
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:52,550
do we come
here why does it seem to be so magical

4960
01:53:52,550 --> 01:53:52,560
here why does it seem to be so magical
 

4961
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:55,550
here why does it seem to be so magical
and beautiful and Powerful now where is

4962
01:53:55,550 --> 01:53:55,560
and beautiful and Powerful now where is
 

4963
01:53:55,560 --> 01:53:56,550
and beautiful and Powerful now where is
it

4964
01:53:56,550 --> 01:53:56,560
it
 

4965
01:53:56,560 --> 01:54:01,069
it
going because it feels like we're

4966
01:54:01,069 --> 01:54:01,079
going because it feels like we're
 

4967
01:54:01,079 --> 01:54:03,550
going because it feels like we're
really perhaps for the first time in

4968
01:54:03,550 --> 01:54:03,560
really perhaps for the first time in
 

4969
01:54:03,560 --> 01:54:05,830
really perhaps for the first time in
history are in a moment where we can

4970
01:54:05,830 --> 01:54:05,840
history are in a moment where we can
 

4971
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:08,870
history are in a moment where we can
destroy ourselves and so naturally you

4972
01:54:08,870 --> 01:54:08,880
destroy ourselves and so naturally you
 

4973
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:13,189
destroy ourselves and so naturally you
ask well where's others like

4974
01:54:13,189 --> 01:54:13,199
ask well where's others like
 

4975
01:54:13,199 --> 01:54:18,550
ask well where's others like
us is is it perhaps are we

4976
01:54:18,550 --> 01:54:18,560
us is is it perhaps are we
 

4977
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:20,750
us is is it perhaps are we
inevitably going to a place where we'll

4978
01:54:20,750 --> 01:54:20,760
inevitably going to a place where we'll
 

4979
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:22,550
inevitably going to a place where we'll
destroy ourselves is it basically

4980
01:54:22,550 --> 01:54:22,560
destroy ourselves is it basically
 

4981
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:24,510
destroy ourselves is it basically
inevitable that we destroy ourselves we

4982
01:54:24,510 --> 01:54:24,520
inevitable that we destroy ourselves we
 

4983
01:54:24,520 --> 01:54:25,669
inevitable that we destroy ourselves we
become too

4984
01:54:25,669 --> 01:54:25,679
become too
 

4985
01:54:25,679 --> 01:54:29,189
become too
powerful and not insufficiently wise to

4986
01:54:29,189 --> 01:54:29,199
powerful and not insufficiently wise to
 

4987
01:54:29,199 --> 01:54:32,390
powerful and not insufficiently wise to
know what to do with that

4988
01:54:32,390 --> 01:54:32,400

 

4989
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:35,350

power but like you said probably the

4990
01:54:35,350 --> 01:54:35,360
power but like you said probably the
 

4991
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:38,589
power but like you said probably the
answers to that are in here we don't

4992
01:54:38,589 --> 01:54:38,599
answers to that are in here we don't
 

4993
01:54:38,599 --> 01:54:40,270
answers to that are in here we don't
need to look out

4994
01:54:40,270 --> 01:54:40,280
need to look out
 

4995
01:54:40,280 --> 01:54:43,470
need to look out
there I'd love to ask you about the

4996
01:54:43,470 --> 01:54:43,480
there I'd love to ask you about the
 

4997
01:54:43,480 --> 01:54:45,910
there I'd love to ask you about the
extra sensory uh perception you've

4998
01:54:45,910 --> 01:54:45,920
extra sensory uh perception you've
 

4999
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:48,229
extra sensory uh perception you've
written like you said the book phenomena

5000
01:54:48,229 --> 01:54:48,239
written like you said the book phenomena
 

5001
01:54:48,239 --> 01:54:50,830
written like you said the book phenomena
on the secret history of the US

5002
01:54:50,830 --> 01:54:50,840
on the secret history of the US
 

5003
01:54:50,840 --> 01:54:52,709
on the secret history of the US
government's investigations into

5004
01:54:52,709 --> 01:54:52,719
government's investigations into
 

5005
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:55,709
government's investigations into
extrasensory perception and

5006
01:54:55,709 --> 01:54:55,719
extrasensory perception and
 

5007
01:54:55,719 --> 01:54:57,950
extrasensory perception and
psychokinesis uh what are some of the

5008
01:54:57,950 --> 01:54:57,960
psychokinesis uh what are some of the
 

5009
01:54:57,960 --> 01:55:00,069
psychokinesis uh what are some of the
more interesting extrasensory abilities

5010
01:55:00,069 --> 01:55:00,079
more interesting extrasensory abilities
 

5011
01:55:00,079 --> 01:55:02,430
more interesting extrasensory abilities
that were explored by the government and

5012
01:55:02,430 --> 01:55:02,440
that were explored by the government and
 

5013
01:55:02,440 --> 01:55:04,950
that were explored by the government and
maybe just in general espb what is it

5014
01:55:04,950 --> 01:55:04,960
maybe just in general espb what is it
 

5015
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:08,430
maybe just in general espb what is it
what what do you know of it the book was

5016
01:55:08,430 --> 01:55:08,440
what what do you know of it the book was
 

5017
01:55:08,440 --> 01:55:11,149
what what do you know of it the book was
so interesting to report because I spend

5018
01:55:11,149 --> 01:55:11,159
so interesting to report because I spend
 

5019
01:55:11,159 --> 01:55:12,790
so interesting to report because I spend
so much time dealing with like

5020
01:55:12,790 --> 01:55:12,800
so much time dealing with like
 

5021
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:16,430
so much time dealing with like
mechanized systems machines war machines

5022
01:55:16,430 --> 01:55:16,440
mechanized systems machines war machines
 

5023
01:55:16,440 --> 01:55:19,149
mechanized systems machines war machines
and yet the military and intelligence

5024
01:55:19,149 --> 01:55:19,159
and yet the military and intelligence
 

5025
01:55:19,159 --> 01:55:21,950
and yet the military and intelligence
were and continue to be incredibly

5026
01:55:21,950 --> 01:55:21,960
were and continue to be incredibly
 

5027
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:24,589
were and continue to be incredibly
interesting Ed in the human mind in

5028
01:55:24,589 --> 01:55:24,599
interesting Ed in the human mind in
 

5029
01:55:24,599 --> 01:55:27,229
interesting Ed in the human mind in
Consciousness and so you know if one is

5030
01:55:27,229 --> 01:55:27,239
Consciousness and so you know if one is
 

5031
01:55:27,239 --> 01:55:29,109
Consciousness and so you know if one is
called hard science this what we're

5032
01:55:29,109 --> 01:55:29,119
called hard science this what we're
 

5033
01:55:29,119 --> 01:55:30,350
called hard science this what we're
talking about now is called squishy

5034
01:55:30,350 --> 01:55:30,360
talking about now is called squishy
 

5035
01:55:30,360 --> 01:55:32,430
talking about now is called squishy
science right and it was really

5036
01:55:32,430 --> 01:55:32,440
science right and it was really
 

5037
01:55:32,440 --> 01:55:34,669
science right and it was really
interesting to delve into that world it

programs that was a complete disaster in
 

5155
01:58:27,239 --> 01:58:29,350
programs that was a complete disaster in
my opinion because the military needs to

5156
01:58:29,350 --> 01:58:29,360
my opinion because the military needs to
 

5157
01:58:29,360 --> 01:58:31,189
my opinion because the military needs to
control everything in a mechanized

5181
01:59:03,599 --> 01:59:06,069
IED there and they call this the spidey
sense and they actually have a program

5182
01:59:06,069 --> 01:59:06,079
sense and they actually have a program
 

5183
01:59:06,079 --> 01:59:08,109
sense and they actually have a program
that that works from this so these

5184
01:59:08,109 --> 01:59:08,119
that that works from this so these
 

5185
01:59:08,119 --> 01:59:09,990
that that works from this so these
things never go away they kind of circle

6125
02:20:03,960 --> 02:20:06,830
such an interesting person and has such
a really unique origin story about how

6126
02:20:06,830 --> 02:20:06,840
a really unique origin story about how
 

6127
02:20:06,840 --> 02:20:08,710
a really unique origin story about how
he came into all of this and he's such a

6128
02:20:08,710 --> 02:20:08,720
he came into all of this and he's such a
 

6129
02:20:08,720 --> 02:20:11,389
he came into all of this and he's such a
scientist right and he is profoundly

6130
02:20:11,389 --> 02:20:11,399
scientist right and he is profoundly
 

6131
02:20:11,399 --> 02:20:13,630
scientist right and he is profoundly
dedicated to this issue and stands

6132
02:20:13,630 --> 02:20:13,640
dedicated to this issue and stands
 

6133
02:20:13,640 --> 02:20:15,510
dedicated to this issue and stands
completely on the opposite end of the

6134
02:20:15,510 --> 02:20:15,520
completely on the opposite end of the
 

6135
02:20:15,520 --> 02:20:16,950
completely on the opposite end of the
spectrum from me and knows a lot more

6136
02:20:16,950 --> 02:20:16,960
spectrum from me and knows a lot more
 

6137
02:20:16,960 --> 02:20:18,750
spectrum from me and knows a lot more
and has studied this for decades more

6138
02:20:18,750 --> 02:20:18,760
and has studied this for decades more
 

6139
02:20:18,760 --> 02:20:20,790
and has studied this for decades more
but what he said to me is the most

6140
02:20:20,790 --> 02:20:20,800
but what he said to me is the most
 

6141
02:20:20,800 --> 02:20:22,710
but what he said to me is the most
interesting thing which is that it's not

6142
02:20:22,710 --> 02:20:22,720
interesting thing which is that it's not
 

6143
02:20:22,720 --> 02:20:24,870
interesting thing which is that it's not
a military problem it's an intelligence

6144
02:20:24,870 --> 02:20:24,880
a military problem it's an intelligence
 

6145
02:20:24,880 --> 02:20:26,910
a military problem it's an intelligence
problem because jacqu believes that this

6146
02:20:26,910 --> 02:20:26,920
problem because jacqu believes that this
 

6147
02:20:26,920 --> 02:20:30,230
problem because jacqu believes that this
is some kind of intelligence right which

6148
02:20:30,230 --> 02:20:30,240
is some kind of intelligence right which
 

6149
02:20:30,240 --> 02:20:33,270
is some kind of intelligence right which
really the closest I can do to wrapping

6150
02:20:33,270 --> 02:20:33,280
really the closest I can do to wrapping
 

6151
02:20:33,280 --> 02:20:35,710
really the closest I can do to wrapping
my head around that takes me to

6152
02:20:35,710 --> 02:20:35,720
my head around that takes me to
 

6153
02:20:35,720 --> 02:20:38,670
my head around that takes me to
Consciousness right the idea of what is

6154
02:20:38,670 --> 02:20:38,680
Consciousness right the idea of what is
 

6155
02:20:38,680 --> 02:20:40,550
Consciousness right the idea of what is
consciousness and I think that's where

6156
02:20:40,550 --> 02:20:40,560
consciousness and I think that's where
 

6157
02:20:40,560 --> 02:20:42,750
consciousness and I think that's where
it becomes very interesting I think the

6158
02:20:42,750 --> 02:20:42,760
it becomes very interesting I think the
 

6159
02:20:42,760 --> 02:20:45,830
it becomes very interesting I think the
government is hiding bodies and crafts

6160
02:20:45,830 --> 02:20:45,840
government is hiding bodies and crafts
 

6161
02:20:45,840 --> 02:20:48,750
government is hiding bodies and crafts
is is very Paul benoits read it Google

6162
02:20:48,750 --> 02:20:48,760
is is very Paul benoits read it Google
 

6163

uh yeah I I think this kind of flying

6166
02:20:53,190 --> 02:20:53,200
uh yeah I I think this kind of flying
 

6167
02:20:53,200 --> 02:20:57,190

saucer thing is a is a a trivialization

6168
02:20:57,190 --> 02:20:57,200
saucer thing is a is a a trivialization
 

6169
02:20:57,200 --> 02:20:59,070
saucer thing is a is a a trivialization
of what kind of if there's alien

6170
02:20:59,070 --> 02:20:59,080
of what kind of if there's alien
 

6171
02:20:59,080 --> 02:21:01,510
of what kind of if there's alien
civilizations out there trivialization

6172
02:21:01,510 --> 02:21:01,520
civilizations out there trivialization
 

6173
02:21:01,520 --> 02:21:03,990
civilizations out there trivialization
that's a great word trivialization

6174
02:21:03,990 --> 02:21:04,000
that's a great word trivialization
 

6175
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:05,990
that's a great word trivialization
that's I agree with you I tend to

6176
02:21:05,990 --> 02:21:06,000
that's I agree with you I tend to
 

6177
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,510
that's I agree with you I tend to
believe that there is like a very large

6178
02:21:08,510 --> 02:21:08,520
believe that there is like a very large
 

6179
02:21:08,520 --> 02:21:11,150
believe that there is like a very large
number of alien civilizations out there

6180
02:21:11,150 --> 02:21:11,160
number of alien civilizations out there
 

6181
02:21:11,160 --> 02:21:14,830
number of alien civilizations out there
and I I believe we we would have trouble

6182
02:21:14,830 --> 02:21:14,840
and I I believe we we would have trouble
 

6183
02:21:14,840 --> 02:21:17,510
and I I believe we we would have trouble
comprehending what that even looks like

6184
02:21:17,510 --> 02:21:17,520
comprehending what that even looks like
 

6185
02:21:17,520 --> 02:21:19,590
comprehending what that even looks like
or they to visit I I tend to believe

6186
02:21:19,590 --> 02:21:19,600
or they to visit I I tend to believe
 

6187
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:21,870
or they to visit I I tend to believe
they are already here or have visited

6188
02:21:21,870 --> 02:21:21,880
they are already here or have visited
 

6189
02:21:21,880 --> 02:21:24,190
they are already here or have visited
and we're too dumb to understand what

6190
02:21:24,190 --> 02:21:24,200
and we're too dumb to understand what
 

6191
02:21:24,200 --> 02:21:26,710
and we're too dumb to understand what
that even means and they certainly would

6192
02:21:26,710 --> 02:21:26,720
that even means and they certainly would
 

6193
02:21:26,720 --> 02:21:29,710
that even means and they certainly would
not appear as

6194
02:21:29,710 --> 02:21:29,720
not appear as
 

6195
02:21:29,720 --> 02:21:32,990
not appear as
um as uh flying objects that defy

6196
02:21:32,990 --> 02:21:33,000
um as uh flying objects that defy
 

6197
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,550
um as uh flying objects that defy
gravity for brief moments of time on low

6198
02:21:35,550 --> 02:21:35,560
gravity for brief moments of time on low
 

6199
02:21:35,560 --> 02:21:38,230
gravity for brief moments of time on low
resolution video um I tend to have

6200
02:21:38,230 --> 02:21:38,240
resolution video um I tend to have
 

6201
02:21:38,240 --> 02:21:40,429
resolution video um I tend to have
humility about all this kind of stuff

6202
02:21:40,429 --> 02:21:40,439
humility about all this kind of stuff
 

6203
02:21:40,439 --> 02:21:42,389
humility about all this kind of stuff
but I think radical humility is required

6204
02:21:42,389 --> 02:21:42,399
but I think radical humility is required
 

6205
02:21:42,399 --> 02:21:44,550
but I think radical humility is required
to even like open your eyes to what an

6206
02:21:44,550 --> 02:21:44,560
to even like open your eyes to what an
 

6207
02:21:44,560 --> 02:21:46,150
to even like open your eyes to what an
alien intelligence would actually look

6208
02:21:46,150 --> 02:21:46,160
alien intelligence would actually look
 

6209
02:21:46,160 --> 02:21:50,550
alien intelligence would actually look
like and it I to me it's beyond military

6210
02:21:50,550 --> 02:21:50,560
like and it I to me it's beyond military
 

6211
02:21:50,560 --> 02:21:52,710
like and it I to me it's beyond military
lications it's like the basic human

6212
02:21:52,710 --> 02:21:52,720
lications it's like the basic human
 

6213
02:21:52,720 --> 02:21:55,270
lications it's like the basic human
question of like what is even this thing

6214
02:21:55,270 --> 02:21:55,280
question of like what is even this thing
 

6215
02:21:55,280 --> 02:21:56,750
question of like what is even this thing
like you mentioned Consciousness that's

6216
02:21:56,750 --> 02:21:56,760
like you mentioned Consciousness that's
 

6217
02:21:56,760 --> 02:21:58,870
like you mentioned Consciousness that's
going on like where does this come from

6218
02:21:58,870 --> 02:21:58,880
going on like where does this come from
 

6219
02:21:58,880 --> 02:22:01,150
going on like where does this come from
why is it so powerful is it unique in

6220
02:22:01,150 --> 02:22:01,160
why is it so powerful is it unique in
 

6221
02:22:01,160 --> 02:22:05,110
why is it so powerful is it unique in
the universe I tend to believe not uh of

6222
02:22:05,110 --> 02:22:05,120
the universe I tend to believe not uh of
 

6223
02:22:05,120 --> 02:22:07,349
the universe I tend to believe not uh of
course I hang out a bunch with with

6224
02:22:07,349 --> 02:22:07,359
course I hang out a bunch with with
 

6225
02:22:07,359 --> 02:22:10,270
course I hang out a bunch with with
other folks like Elon who believe we are

6226
02:22:10,270 --> 02:22:10,280
other folks like Elon who believe we are
 

6227
02:22:10,280 --> 02:22:13,349
other folks like Elon who believe we are
alone but I think that

6228
02:22:13,349 --> 02:22:13,359
alone but I think that
 

6229
02:22:13,359 --> 02:22:15,550
alone but I think that
belief just like you

6230
02:22:15,550 --> 02:22:15,560
belief just like you
 

6231
02:22:15,560 --> 02:22:19,830
belief just like you
said has power because it actually

6232
02:22:19,830 --> 02:22:19,840
said has power because it actually
 

6233
02:22:19,840 --> 02:22:23,790
said has power because it actually
manifests itself itself in uh in reality

6234
02:22:23,790 --> 02:22:23,800
manifests itself itself in uh in reality
 

6235
02:22:23,800 --> 02:22:25,550
manifests itself itself in uh in reality
so if you believe that we're alone in

6236
02:22:25,550 --> 02:22:25,560
so if you believe that we're alone in
 

6237
02:22:25,560 --> 02:22:27,630
so if you believe that we're alone in
this universe that's a great motivator

6238
02:22:27,630 --> 02:22:27,640
this universe that's a great motivator
 

6239
02:22:27,640 --> 02:22:28,870
this universe that's a great motivator
to build rockets and become

6240
02:22:28,870 --> 02:22:28,880
to build rockets and become
 

6241

to build rockets and become
multiplanetary and save ourselves

6242
02:22:31,030 --> 02:22:31,040
multiplanetary and save ourselves

especially in the case of nuclear war uh
 

6245
02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:35,710
especially in the case of nuclear war uh
because otherwise whatever this Special

Sauce this this flame of Consciousness
 

6249
02:22:38,840 --> 02:22:41,349
Sauce this this flame of Consciousness
will go out if we destroy ourselves on

6250
02:22:41,349 --> 02:22:41,359
will go out if we destroy ourselves on
 

6251
02:22:41,359 --> 02:22:43,750
will go out if we destroy ourselves on
this Earth and uh for people like Elon

it's too high of a probability that we

it's too high of a probability that we
 

6255
02:22:46,280 --> 02:22:48,469
it's too high of a probability that we

02:23:22,600 --> 02:23:25,309
what's the probability it's
not so you know I've never I've never

source yeah okay who's the
 

6289
02:23:33,080 --> 02:23:36,349
source yeah okay who's the
source so before I say anything on that

6290
02:23:36,349 --> 02:23:36,359
source so before I say anything on that
 

6291
02:23:36,359 --> 02:23:39,309
source so before I say anything on that
let me let me let me speak to the the

6297
02:23:44,279 --> 02:23:47,030
so you asked me what's the probability
that that is still standing as an

6298
02:23:47,030 --> 02:23:47,040
that that is still standing as an
 

6299
02:23:47,040 --> 02:23:51,389
that that is still standing as an
idea 14 12 13 14 years later right so I

6300
02:23:51,389 --> 02:23:51,399
idea 14 12 13 14 years later right so I
 

6301
02:23:51,399 --> 02:23:52,950
idea 14 12 13 14 years later right so I
continued to work with that source for

third
 

6583
02:29:40,520 --> 02:29:43,110
third
option it turns out so first of all

6584
02:29:43,110 --> 02:29:43,120
option it turns out so first of all
 

6585
02:29:43,120 --> 02:29:44,630

that pause there the reason I ask of how

7144
02:41:23,190 --> 02:41:23,200
that pause there the reason I ask of how
 

7145
02:41:23,200 --> 02:41:24,870
that pause there the reason I ask of how
difficult the assassinations are you

7146

so I guess the
reconnaissance the intelligence for

7152
02:41:31,710 --> 02:41:31,720
