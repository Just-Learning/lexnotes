rate is 8% interest if I charge them 25

764
00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:25,079

them 8 and a quarter you know 8.25 then

768
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:32,240
them 8 and a quarter you know 8.25 then
 

769
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,990
them 8 and a quarter you know 8.25 then
I get 1% of the loan back as a fee so if

770
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,000

ability

1776
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:53,399
ability
 

1777
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:56,629
ability
to to leverage that perfect those

1778
00:34:56,629 --> 00:34:56,639
to to leverage that perfect those
 

1779
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,510
to to leverage that perfect those
perfect credit profiles against

1780
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:00,520
perfect credit profiles against

00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,950
perfect credit profiles against
properties and I mean ultimately that's

1782
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:02,960
properties and I mean ultimately that's
 

1783
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,710
properties and I mean ultimately that's
what I end up doing and and so each one

1784
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:04,720
what I end up doing and and so each one
 

1785
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,470
what I end up doing and and so each one
of those identities was

1786
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:06,480
of those identities was
 

1787
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,230
of those identities was
worth you know a few million can you

1788
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:09,240
worth you know a few million can you
 

1789
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,349
worth you know a few million can you
explain how that works so uh to leverage

1790
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:11,359
explain how that works so uh to leverage
 

1791
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,030
explain how that works so uh to leverage
them against property so how does that

1792
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:13,040
them against property so how does that
 

1793
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,910
them against property so how does that
work with the mortgage so what I did

1794
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:15,920
work with the mortgage so what I did
 

1795
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,030
work with the mortgage so what I did
eventually I mean this would like is

1796
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:18,040
eventually I mean this would like is
 

1797
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,270

00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:13,280
hundred so I thought what I could do is
 

1839
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,990
hundred so I thought what I could do is
I

1840
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:15,000
I
 

1841
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,990
I
can I can buy these houses renovate them

1842
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:19,000
can I can buy these houses renovate them
 

1843
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,870
can I can buy these houses renovate them
and sell them to you know regular

1844
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:22,880
and sell them to you know regular
 

1845
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,230

people but I also had been working on

1846
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:25,240
people but I also had been working on
 

1847
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,309
people but I also had been working on
the synthetic identities

1848
00:36:27,309 --> 00:36:27,319
the synthetic identities
 

1849
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:28,990

1877
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,790
maybe I'll pocket 40 or 50,000 I don't
really have to do

1878
00:36:59,790 --> 00:36:59,800
really have to do
 

1879
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,750
really have to do
anything but that seemed shortsighted so

1880
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:02,760
anything but that seemed shortsighted so
 

1881
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,430
anything but that seemed shortsighted so
I thought what' be even better is that

1882
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:04,440
I thought what' be even better is that
 

1883
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,550
I thought what' be even better is that
if I did a little bit of Renovations and

1884
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:06,560
if I did a little bit of Renovations and
 

1885
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,790
if I did a little bit of Renovations and
then I sold it for much higher maybe I

1886
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:08,800
then I sold it for much higher maybe I
 

1887
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,990
then I sold it for much higher maybe I
put 10,000 clean up the outside of it

1888
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:11,000
put 10,000 clean up the outside of it
 

1889
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,030
put 10,000 clean up the outside of it
because these guys don't care what the

00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:12,040
because these guys don't care what the
 

1891

3220
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:05,920
trouble here because I'm looking at a
 

3221

3223
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,589
felony but I'm not going to go to jail
because there was no potential for the

3224
01:03:09,589 --> 01:03:09,599
because there was no potential for the
 

3225
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:13,230
because there was no potential for the
bank to lend to lose money

3226
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:13,240
bank to lend to lose money
 

3227
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:16,430

so because I bought the house with like
 

3229
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,589
so because I bought the house with like
a hard money loan and then I renovated

3230
01:03:18,589 --> 01:03:18,599
a hard money loan and then I renovated
 

3231
01:03:18,599 --> 01:03:20,710
a hard money loan and then I renovated
it with my own cash and when I sold it

3232
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:20,720
it with my own cash and when I sold it
 

3233
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,029
it with my own cash and when I sold it
it appraised at

3234
01:03:23,029 --> 01:03:23,039
it appraised at
 

3235
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:26,950

are there people in this world you
 

3437
01:07:26,599 --> 01:07:29,109
are there people in this world you
trusted or you still

3438
01:07:29,109 --> 01:07:29,119
trusted or you still
 

3439
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:33,109
trusted or you still
trust I you know the the problem

3440
01:07:33,109 --> 01:07:33,119
trust I you know the the problem
 

3441
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:36,029
trust I you know the the problem
is eventually I

3442
01:07:36,029 --> 01:07:36,039
is eventually I
 

3443
01:07:36,039 --> 01:07:38,549
is eventually I
cooperate

3444
01:07:38,549 --> 01:07:38,559
cooperate
 

3445
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:40,789
cooperate
and at the time I didn't want to

3446
01:07:40,789 --> 01:07:40,799
and at the time I didn't want to
 

3447
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:42,990
and at the time I didn't want to
cooperate I didn't believe in

3448
01:07:42,990 --> 01:07:43,000
cooperate I didn't believe in
 

3449
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,670
cooperate I didn't believe in
cooperation but after seeing how many

3450
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:45,680
cooperation but after seeing how many
 

3451
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:48,390
cooperation but after seeing how many
people cooperate and the way the system

3452
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:48,400
people cooperate and the way the system
 

3453
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:52,670
people cooperate and the way the system
is set up I think that my understanding

3454
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:52,680
is set up I think that my understanding
 

3455
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:54,750
is set up I think that my understanding
of loyalty

3456
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:54,760
of loyalty
 

3457
01:07:54,760 --> 01:08:00,269
of loyalty
is vastly more realistic now and I think

3458
01:08:00,269 --> 01:08:00,279
is vastly more realistic now and I think
 

3459
01:08:00,279 --> 01:08:04,309
is vastly more realistic now and I think
that if you're committing crime if if

3460
01:08:04,309 --> 01:08:04,319
that if you're committing crime if if
 

3461
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:06,630
that if you're committing crime if if
you're absolutely like the things I did

3462
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:06,640
you're absolutely like the things I did
 

3463
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,710
you're absolutely like the things I did
I did a bunch of scumbag things you know

3464
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:08,720
I did a bunch of scumbag things you know
 

3465

I mean I'm not killing people but I'm

3466
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:11,640

3467
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:14,190
I mean I'm not killing people but I'm
doing scumbag things I'm lying cheating

3468
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:14,200
doing scumbag things I'm lying cheating
 

3469
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:16,870
doing scumbag things I'm lying cheating
stealing that I'm a thief you know you

3470
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:16,880
stealing that I'm a thief you know you
 

3471
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:20,229
stealing that I'm a thief you know you
boil down to it that's what I am so you

3472
01:08:20,229 --> 01:08:20,239
boil down to it that's what I am so you
 

3473
01:08:20,239 --> 01:08:23,070
boil down to it that's what I am so you
can't go around behaving like a scumbag

3474
01:08:23,070 --> 01:08:23,080
can't go around behaving like a scumbag
 

3475
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:25,430
can't go around behaving like a scumbag
dealing with scumbags and then expect

3476
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:25,440
dealing with scumbags and then expect
 

3477
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:27,870
dealing with scumbags and then expect
those same scumbags to

3478
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:27,880
those same scumbags to
 

3479
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:30,630
those same scumbags to
suddenly abide by some kind of a street

3480
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:30,640
suddenly abide by some kind of a street
 

3481
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:33,829
suddenly abide by some kind of a street
code and not roll over on you you know

3482
01:08:33,829 --> 01:08:33,839
code and not roll over on you you know
 

3483
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:37,149
code and not roll over on you you know
and it does happen but it's it's like in

3484
01:08:37,149 --> 01:08:37,159
and it does happen but it's it's like in

01:08:42,550 --> 01:08:42,560
that cooperate 90s something percent and
 

3489
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:43,870
that cooperate 90s something percent and
people cooperate when they're not even
