that's what's emerging in fact if you
want to call machine learning a field i

want to call machine learning a field i
think that's what it is that's a proto

00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
generations but do you think there's
 

343
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,150
generations but do you think there's
something deeper about ai in his dreams

something deeper about ai in his dreams
 

345
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,070
something deeper about ai in his dreams

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,430
well the dreams and aspirations maybe
but those are from those are 500 years

from now i think that that's like the

uh scientifically of our era can you
 

371
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,430
uh scientifically of our era can you
linger on that just for a moment because

linger on that just for a moment because

linger on that just for a moment because
you stand

00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:32,800
can you can you elaborate your intuition

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,510
can you can you elaborate your intuition

of
 

383
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,710
of
why we

00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:34,720
why we
 

385
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,550
why we
like where we stand in our understanding

386
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:36,560
like where we stand in our understanding
 

387
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,469
like where we stand in our understanding
of the human brain and a lot of people

of the human brain and a lot of people

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,070

say you know scientists say we're not

00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,080
say you know scientists say we're not
 

391
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,670

very far in understanding human brain
 

393
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,510
very far in understanding human brain
but you're like you're saying we're in

394
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:43,520
but you're like you're saying we're in
 

395
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,150
but you're like you're saying we're in
the dark here well i know i'm not unique

396
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,160
the dark here well i know i'm not unique
 

397
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,510
the dark here well i know i'm not unique
i don't even think in the clarity but if

00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
i don't even think in the clarity but if

um as i'm saying scrupulous but people

494
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:15,759
um as i'm saying scrupulous but people
 

495
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,070
um as i'm saying scrupulous but people
will oversell um i need money from a lab

496
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,080
will oversell um i need money from a lab
 

497
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,990
will oversell um i need money from a lab
i'm gonna i'm studying here you know

498
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,000
i'm gonna i'm studying here you know
 

499
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,029
i'm gonna i'm studying here you know
computational neuroscience um i'm gonna

500
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:23,039
computational neuroscience um i'm gonna
 

501
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,550
computational neuroscience um i'm gonna
oversell it and so there's been too much

502
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:24,560
oversell it and so there's been too much
 

503
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,589
oversell it and so there's been too much
of that so i'll step into the slight the

504
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:27,599
of that so i'll step into the slight the
 

505
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,189
of that so i'll step into the slight the
gray area between metaphor and

506
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:29,199
gray area between metaphor and
 

507
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,589
gray area between metaphor and
engineering with uh i'm not sure if

508
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:31,599
engineering with uh i'm not sure if
 

509
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,350
engineering with uh i'm not sure if
you're familiar with

510
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:33,360
you're familiar with
 

511
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,350
you're familiar with
brain computer interfaces

512
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:35,360
brain computer interfaces
 

513
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,310
brain computer interfaces
so

514
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:36,320
so
 

515
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,790
so
a company like elon musk has neural link

516
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:38,800
a company like elon musk has neural link
 

517
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,870
a company like elon musk has neural link
that's working on

518
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:40,880
that's working on
 

519
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,630
that's working on
putting electrodes into the brain and

520
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:42,640
putting electrodes into the brain and
 

521
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,710
putting electrodes into the brain and
trying to be able to read both read and

522
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:44,720
trying to be able to read both read and
 

523
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,590
trying to be able to read both read and
send electrical signals just as you said

524
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:47,600
send electrical signals just as you said
 

525
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,350
send electrical signals just as you said
even

526
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:49,360
even
 

527
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,470
even
the basic mechanism of communication

528
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:52,480
the basic mechanism of communication
 

529
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,310
the basic mechanism of communication
in the brain is not something we

530
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:54,320
in the brain is not something we
 

531
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,790
in the brain is not something we
understand but do you hope

532
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:56,800
understand but do you hope
 

533
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,630
understand but do you hope
without understanding the fundamental

534
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:58,640
without understanding the fundamental
 

535
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,870
without understanding the fundamental
principles of how the brain works we'll

536
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:00,880
principles of how the brain works we'll
 

537
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,150
principles of how the brain works we'll
be able to do something interesting

538
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,160
be able to do something interesting
 

539
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,710
be able to do something interesting
at that gray area of metaphor it's not

540
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:06,720
at that gray area of metaphor it's not
 

541
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,790
at that gray area of metaphor it's not
my area so i i hope in the sense like

542
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:08,800
my area so i i hope in the sense like
 

543
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,470
my area so i i hope in the sense like
anybody else hopes for some interesting

544
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:10,480
anybody else hopes for some interesting
 

545
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,550
anybody else hopes for some interesting
things to happen from research

546
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:12,560
things to happen from research
 

547
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,070
things to happen from research
i would expect more something like

548
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,080
i would expect more something like
 

549
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,590
i would expect more something like
alzheimer's will get figured out from

550
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:15,600
alzheimer's will get figured out from
 

551
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,030
alzheimer's will get figured out from
modern neuroscience

552
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,040
modern neuroscience
 

553
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,150
modern neuroscience
that you know a lot of there's a lot of

554
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,160
that you know a lot of there's a lot of
 

555
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,630
that you know a lot of there's a lot of
human suffering based on brain disease

556
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:20,640
human suffering based on brain disease
 

557
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,790
human suffering based on brain disease
and we throw things like lithium at the

558
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:22,800
and we throw things like lithium at the
 

559
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,630
and we throw things like lithium at the
brain it kind of works no one has a clue

560
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:24,640
brain it kind of works no one has a clue
 

561
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,590
brain it kind of works no one has a clue
why

562
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:25,600
why
 

563
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,870
why
that's not quite true but you know

564
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:26,880
that's not quite true but you know
 

565
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,630
that's not quite true but you know
mostly we don't know and that's even

566
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:28,640
mostly we don't know and that's even
 

567
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,630
mostly we don't know and that's even
just about the biochemistry of the brain

568
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:30,640
just about the biochemistry of the brain
 

569
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,230
just about the biochemistry of the brain
and how it leads to mood swings and so

570
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,240
and how it leads to mood swings and so
 

571
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,030
and how it leads to mood swings and so
on how thought emerges from that we just

572
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,040
on how thought emerges from that we just
 

573
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,070
on how thought emerges from that we just
we were really really completely dim so

574
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,080
we were really really completely dim so
 

575
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,110
we were really really completely dim so
that you might want to hook up

576
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,120
that you might want to hook up
 

577
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,630
that you might want to hook up
electrodes and try to do some signal

578
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:40,640
electrodes and try to do some signal
 

579
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,070
electrodes and try to do some signal
processing on that and try to find

580
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,080
processing on that and try to find
 

581
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,110
processing on that and try to find
patterns

582
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:43,120
patterns
 

583
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,350
patterns
fine you know by all means go for it

584
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,360
fine you know by all means go for it
 

585
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,509
fine you know by all means go for it
it's just not scientific at this point

586
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:47,519
it's just not scientific at this point
 

587
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,430
it's just not scientific at this point
it's just it's so it's like kind of

588
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:49,440
it's just it's so it's like kind of
 

589
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,110
it's just it's so it's like kind of
sitting in a satellite and watching the

590
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:51,120
sitting in a satellite and watching the
 

591
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,509
sitting in a satellite and watching the
emissions from a city and trying to

592
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:53,519
emissions from a city and trying to
 

593
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,030
emissions from a city and trying to
affirm things about the micro economy

594
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,040
affirm things about the micro economy
 

595
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,310
affirm things about the micro economy
even though you don't have microeconomic

596
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:56,320
even though you don't have microeconomic
 

597
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,389
even though you don't have microeconomic
concepts i mean it's really that kind of

598
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:58,399
concepts i mean it's really that kind of
 

599
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,230
concepts i mean it's really that kind of
thing and so yes can you find some

600
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:00,240
thing and so yes can you find some
 

601
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,829
thing and so yes can you find some
signals that do something interesting or

602
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:01,839
signals that do something interesting or
 

603
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,790
signals that do something interesting or
useful can you control a cursor

604
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:04,800
useful can you control a cursor
 

605
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,670
useful can you control a cursor
or mouse with your brain yeah absolutely

606
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:07,680
or mouse with your brain yeah absolutely
 

607
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,670
or mouse with your brain yeah absolutely
you know and then i can imagine business

608
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:09,680
you know and then i can imagine business
 

609
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,150
you know and then i can imagine business
models based on that and even you know

610
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,160
models based on that and even you know
 

611
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,389
models based on that and even you know
medical applications of that but from

612
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:14,399
medical applications of that but from
 

613
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,310
medical applications of that but from
there to understanding algorithms that

614
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:16,320
there to understanding algorithms that
 

615
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,590
there to understanding algorithms that
allow us to really tie in deeply to from

616
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:19,600
allow us to really tie in deeply to from
 

617
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,350
allow us to really tie in deeply to from
the brain to computer you know i just no

618
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:21,360
the brain to computer you know i just no
 

619
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,710
the brain to computer you know i just no
i don't agree with elon musk i don't

620
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:22,720
i don't agree with elon musk i don't
 

621
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,150
i don't agree with elon musk i don't
think that's even that's not for our

622
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,160
think that's even that's not for our
 

623
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,389
think that's even that's not for our
generation it's not even for the century

624
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:26,399
generation it's not even for the century
 

625
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,430
generation it's not even for the century
so

626
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:27,440
so
 

627
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,630
so
just uh in hopes of getting you to dream

628
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:30,640
just uh in hopes of getting you to dream
 

629
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,389
just uh in hopes of getting you to dream
uh you've mentioned kolmogorov and

630
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:32,399
uh you've mentioned kolmogorov and
 

631
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,990
uh you've mentioned kolmogorov and
touring might pop up

632
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,000
touring might pop up
 

633
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,430
touring might pop up
do you think that there might be

634
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:37,440
do you think that there might be
 

635
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,590
do you think that there might be
breakthroughs they'll get you to sit

636
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:39,600
breakthroughs they'll get you to sit
 

637
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,630
breakthroughs they'll get you to sit
back in five ten years and say

638
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:42,640
back in five ten years and say
 

639
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,750
back in five ten years and say
wow

640
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,760
wow
 

641
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,670
wow
oh i'm sure there will be but i don't

642
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:45,680
oh i'm sure there will be but i don't
 

643
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,750
oh i'm sure there will be but i don't
think that there'll be demos that

644
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:47,760
think that there'll be demos that
 

645
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,110
think that there'll be demos that
impress me

646
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,120
impress me
 

647
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,269
impress me
i don't think that having a computer

648
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:51,279
i don't think that having a computer
 

649
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,269
i don't think that having a computer
call a restaurant and pretend to be a

00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:53,279
call a restaurant and pretend to be a
 

651
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,790
call a restaurant and pretend to be a
human

652
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:54,800
human
 

653
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,230
human
is a breakthrough

654
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,240
is a breakthrough
 

655
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,310
is a breakthrough
and people you know some people present

656
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,320
and people you know some people present
 

657
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,590
and people you know some people present
it as such

658
00:10:59,590 --> 00:10:59,600
it as such
 

659
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,670
it as such
it's imitating human intelligence it's

660
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:01,680
it's imitating human intelligence it's
 

661
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,069
it's imitating human intelligence it's
even putting coughs

662
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:04,079
even putting coughs
 

663
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,030
even putting coughs
in the thing to make a bit of a pr stunt

664
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,040
in the thing to make a bit of a pr stunt
 

665
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,150
in the thing to make a bit of a pr stunt
and so fine the world runs on those

666
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,160
and so fine the world runs on those
 

667
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,190
and so fine the world runs on those
things too

668
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:11,200
things too
 

669
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,110
things too
and i don't want to diminish all the

670
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,120
and i don't want to diminish all the
 

671
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,470
and i don't want to diminish all the
hard work and engineering that goes

672
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:14,480
hard work and engineering that goes
 

673
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,829
hard work and engineering that goes
behind things like that and and the

674
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:15,839
behind things like that and and the
 

675
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,670
behind things like that and and the
ultimate value to the human race but

676
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:17,680
ultimate value to the human race but
 

677
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,990
ultimate value to the human race but
that's not scientific understanding

678
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,000
that's not scientific understanding
 

679
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,590
that's not scientific understanding
and and i know the people who work on

680
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:21,600
and and i know the people who work on
 

681
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,949
and and i know the people who work on
these things they are after a scientific

682
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
these things they are after a scientific
 

683
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,310
these things they are after a scientific
understanding you know in the meantime

684
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:24,320
understanding you know in the meantime
 

685
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,430
understanding you know in the meantime
they've got to kind of you know the

686
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:25,440
they've got to kind of you know the
 

687
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,870
they've got to kind of you know the
trains got to run and they got miles to

688
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:26,880
trains got to run and they got miles to
 

689
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,389
trains got to run and they got miles to
feed and they got things to do

690
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:28,399
feed and they got things to do
 

691
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,389
feed and they got things to do
and there's nothing wrong with all that

692
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:30,399
and there's nothing wrong with all that
 

693
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,829
and there's nothing wrong with all that
i would call that though just

694
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:31,839
i would call that though just
 

695
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,430
i would call that though just
engineering and i want to distinguish

696
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:33,440
engineering and i want to distinguish
 

697
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,870
engineering and i want to distinguish
that between an engineering field like

698
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:34,880
that between an engineering field like
 

699
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,990
that between an engineering field like
electoral internet chemical injury that

electoral internet chemical injury that
 

701
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,910
electoral internet chemical injury that
originally that originally emerged that

702
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:37,920
originally that originally emerged that
 

703
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,350
originally that originally emerged that
had real principles and you really knew

704
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:39,360
had real principles and you really knew
 

705
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,389
had real principles and you really knew
what you're doing and you had a little

706
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:40,399
what you're doing and you had a little
 

707
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,310
what you're doing and you had a little
scientific understanding maybe not even

708
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:42,320
scientific understanding maybe not even
 

709
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,430
scientific understanding maybe not even
complete

710
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:43,440
complete
 

711
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,430
complete
so it became more predictable and it was

712
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:45,440
so it became more predictable and it was
 

713
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,190
so it became more predictable and it was
really gave value to human life because

714
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,200
really gave value to human life because
 

715
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,470
really gave value to human life because
it was understood

716
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
it was understood
 

717
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,949
it was understood
and and so we have to we don't want to

718
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:50,959
and and so we have to we don't want to
 

719
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,269
and and so we have to we don't want to
muddle too much these waters of you know

720
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:53,279
muddle too much these waters of you know
 

721
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,870
muddle too much these waters of you know
what we're able to do versus what we

722
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:54,880
what we're able to do versus what we
 

723
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,710
what we're able to do versus what we
really can do in a way that's going to

724
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:56,720
really can do in a way that's going to
 

725
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,710
really can do in a way that's going to
impress the next so i don't i don't need

00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:58,720
impress the next so i don't i don't need
 

727
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,389
impress the next so i don't i don't need
to be wowed but i i think that someone

728
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:00,399
to be wowed but i i think that someone
 

729
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,069
to be wowed but i i think that someone
comes along in 20 years

730
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:02,079
comes along in 20 years
 

731
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,030
comes along in 20 years

a younger person who's absorbed all the
 

733
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,430
a younger person who's absorbed all the
uh the technology and for them to be

00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:07,440
uh the technology and for them to be
 

735
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,629
uh the technology and for them to be
wowed i think they have to be more

736
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:08,639
wowed i think they have to be more
 

737
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,230
wowed i think they have to be more
deeply impressed a young kulmogorov

deeply impressed a young kulmogorov
 

739
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,910
deeply impressed a young kulmogorov
would not be wowed by some of the stunts

740
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:11,920
would not be wowed by some of the stunts
 

741
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,190
would not be wowed by some of the stunts
that you see right now coming from the

742
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:13,200
that you see right now coming from the
 

743
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,949
that you see right now coming from the
big companies the demos but do you think

744
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:14,959
big companies the demos but do you think
 

745
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,509
big companies the demos but do you think
the breakthroughs from kolmogorov

746
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:17,519
the breakthroughs from kolmogorov
 

747
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,430
the breakthroughs from kolmogorov
would be and give this question a chance

748
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:19,440
would be and give this question a chance
 

749
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,870
would be and give this question a chance
do you think they'll be in the

750
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,880
do you think they'll be in the
 

751
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,910
do you think they'll be in the
scientific fundamental principles arena

752
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:23,920
scientific fundamental principles arena
 

753
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,750
scientific fundamental principles arena
or do you think it's possible to have

754
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,760
or do you think it's possible to have
 

755
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,150
or do you think it's possible to have
fundamental breakthroughs in engineering

756
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,160
fundamental breakthroughs in engineering
 

757
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,269
fundamental breakthroughs in engineering
meaning

758
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:29,279
meaning
 

759
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,870
meaning
you know i would say some of the things

760
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:30,880
you know i would say some of the things
 

761
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,269
you know i would say some of the things
that elon musk is working with spacex

762
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:33,279
that elon musk is working with spacex
 

763
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,509
that elon musk is working with spacex
and then others sort of trying to

764
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:35,519
and then others sort of trying to
 

765
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,269
and then others sort of trying to
revolutionize the fundamentals of

766
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:37,279
revolutionize the fundamentals of
 

767
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,670
revolutionize the fundamentals of
engineering of manufacturing of

768
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:39,680
engineering of manufacturing of
 

769
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,430
engineering of manufacturing of
of saying here's a problem we know how

770
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:41,440
of saying here's a problem we know how
 

771
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,590
of saying here's a problem we know how
to do a demo of and actually taking it

772
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:43,600
to do a demo of and actually taking it
 

773
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,990
to do a demo of and actually taking it
to scale yeah so so there's going to be

774
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,000
to scale yeah so so there's going to be
 

775
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,269
to scale yeah so so there's going to be
all kinds of breakthroughs i just don't

776
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:47,279
all kinds of breakthroughs i just don't
 

777
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,949
all kinds of breakthroughs i just don't
like that terminology i'm a scientist

778
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:48,959
like that terminology i'm a scientist
 

779
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,629
like that terminology i'm a scientist
and i work on things day in and day out

780
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:50,639
and i work on things day in and day out
 

781
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,150
and i work on things day in and day out
and things move along and eventually say

782
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,160
and things move along and eventually say
 

783
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,910
and things move along and eventually say
wow something happened but it's i don't

784
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:53,920
wow something happened but it's i don't
 

785
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,069
wow something happened but it's i don't
like that language very much

786
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:56,079
like that language very much
 

787
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,870
like that language very much
also i don't like to prize theoretical

788
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:58,880
also i don't like to prize theoretical
 

789
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,269
also i don't like to prize theoretical
breakthroughs over practical ones um i

790
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:01,279
breakthroughs over practical ones um i
 

791
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,790
breakthroughs over practical ones um i
tend to be more of a theoretician and i

792
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:02,800
tend to be more of a theoretician and i
 

793
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,949
tend to be more of a theoretician and i
think there's lots to do in that arena

794
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:04,959
think there's lots to do in that arena
 

795
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,430
think there's lots to do in that arena
right now um and so i wouldn't point to

796
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:07,440
right now um and so i wouldn't point to
 

797
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,710
right now um and so i wouldn't point to
the komo gurus i might point to the

798
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:08,720
the komo gurus i might point to the
 

799
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,470
the komo gurus i might point to the
edisons of the era and maybe musk is a

800
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:10,480
edisons of the era and maybe musk is a
 

801
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,190
edisons of the era and maybe musk is a
bit more like that but um you know musk

802
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:13,200
bit more like that but um you know musk
 

803
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,949
bit more like that but um you know musk
god bless him also

804
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:14,959
god bless him also
 

805
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,110
god bless him also
we'll say things about ai that he knows

806
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,120
we'll say things about ai that he knows
 

807
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,870
we'll say things about ai that he knows
very little about and and he doesn't

808
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:18,880
very little about and and he doesn't
 

809
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,710
very little about and and he doesn't
know what he's he he is you know leads

810
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:20,720
know what he's he he is you know leads
 

811
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,069
know what he's he he is you know leads
people astray when he talks about things

812
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:22,079

you know we don't have that field so we

866
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,120
you know we don't have that field so we
 

867
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,230
you know we don't have that field so we
don't think these things through very

868

well
 

871
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,790
well
but i see that is emerging and that will

872

that you talk about and we'll get to
 

889
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,470
that you talk about and we'll get to
will be seen as sort of breakthrough and

890

will be seen as sort of breakthrough and
 

891
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,069
will be seen as sort of breakthrough and
we're in the very early days of really

892

we're in the very early days of really
 

893
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,150
we're in the very early days of really
doing interesting stuff there and we'll

doing interesting stuff there and we'll
 

895
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,150
doing interesting stuff there and we'll
get to that but it's just taking a quick

896
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,160
get to that but it's just taking a quick
 

897
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,189
get to that but it's just taking a quick
step back

know finding patterns it's all about
making decisions in real worlds and

974
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:50,880
making decisions in real worlds and
 

975
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,269
making decisions in real worlds and
having close feedback loops so something

976
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:53,279
having close feedback loops so something
 

977
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,670
having close feedback loops so something
like symbolic ai expert systems reading

machine learning so i don't even like

988
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:05,440
machine learning so i don't even like
 

989
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,629
machine learning so i don't even like
the word but you know i think that with

the field you're talking about is all
 

993
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,670
the field you're talking about is all
about making large collections of

00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:09,680
about making large collections of
 

995
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,189

collections of entities yes right and

998
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:13,759
collections of entities yes right and
 

999
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,430
collections of entities yes right and
there are principles for that at that

1000
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:15,440
there are principles for that at that
 

1001
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,629
there are principles for that at that

scale you don't have to say the
 

1003
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,990

and
 

1059
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,670
and
aspects of this will look intelligent it

00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:03,680
aspects of this will look intelligent it
 

1061
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,990
aspects of this will look intelligent it
will look computers were so dumb

1062
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,000
will look computers were so dumb
 

1063
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,990
will look computers were so dumb
before they will seem more intelligent

1064

before they will seem more intelligent
 

1065
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,270
before they will seem more intelligent
we will use that buzz word of

1066
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:09,280
we will use that buzz word of
 

1067
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,789
we will use that buzz word of
intelligence so we can use it in that

1068
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:10,799
intelligence so we can use it in that
 

1069
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,590
intelligence so we can use it in that
sense but you know so machine learning

1070
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:13,600
sense but you know so machine learning
 

1071
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,189
sense but you know so machine learning
you can scope it narrowly is just

1072
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:15,199
you can scope it narrowly is just
 

1073
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,549
you can scope it narrowly is just

00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:23,520
word you could throw in the mix
 

1083
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,870
word you could throw in the mix
it really is important that the

it really is important that the
 

1085

uh mccarthy needed a new name because
 

1137
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,630
uh mccarthy needed a new name because
cybernetics already existed and he

1138
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:12,640
cybernetics already existed and he
 

1139
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,470
cybernetics already existed and he
didn't like you know no one really liked

1140
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:14,480
didn't like you know no one really liked

he had encompassed all this and in some
sense he did you look at the language of

1148
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,080
sense he did you look at the language of
 

1149
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,669

cybernetics it was everything we're
 

1151
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,110

00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:25,120
talking about it was control theory and
 

1153
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,710
talking about it was control theory and

maybe the personalities but mccarthy
 

1163

and real world discipline it was a
 

1183
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,590
and real world discipline it was a
terrible choice because it led to

1184
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:53,600
terrible choice because it led to
 

1185
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,029
terrible choice because it led to

perhaps but we don't understand

perhaps but we don't understand
intelligence it's a small tangent

1192
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:00,320
intelligence it's a small tangent
 

1193
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,430
intelligence it's a small tangent
because you're one of the great

because you're one of the great

because you're one of the great
personalities of machine learning

1196
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,120
personalities of machine learning

do you think science progresses by

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,549
do you think science progresses by
personalities or by the fundamental

1204
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:10,559
personalities or by the fundamental
 

1205
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,870
personalities or by the fundamental
principles and theories and

principles and theories and
 

1207
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,029
principles and theories and
research that's outside of personality

1208
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:15,039
research that's outside of personality
 

1209
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,630
research that's outside of personality
both and i wouldn't say there should be

1210
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:16,640
both and i wouldn't say there should be
 

1211
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,230
both and i wouldn't say there should be
one kind of personality i have mine and

1212
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:18,240
one kind of personality i have mine and
 

1213
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,789
one kind of personality i have mine and
i have my preferences and

1214
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:20,799
i have my preferences and
 

1215
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,950
i have my preferences and
i have a kind of network around me that

1216
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:22,960
i have a kind of network around me that
 

1217
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,710
i have a kind of network around me that
feeds me and and some of them agree with

1218
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:24,720
feeds me and and some of them agree with
 

1219
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,150
feeds me and and some of them agree with
me and some disagree but all kinds of

1220
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:26,160
me and some disagree but all kinds of
 

1221
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,669
me and some disagree but all kinds of
personalities are needed

1222
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:27,679
personalities are needed
 

1223
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,669
personalities are needed
um right now i think the personality

1224
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:29,679
um right now i think the personality
 

1225
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,110
um right now i think the personality
that's a little too exuberant a little

1226
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,120
that's a little too exuberant a little
 

1227
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,110
that's a little too exuberant a little
bit too ready to promise the moon is a

1228
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,120
bit too ready to promise the moon is a
 

1229
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,029
bit too ready to promise the moon is a
little bit too much in ascendance

1230
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:35,039
little bit too much in ascendance
 

1231
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,110
little bit too much in ascendance
um and i do i do think that that's

1232
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,120
um and i do i do think that that's
 

1233
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,549
um and i do i do think that that's
there's some good to that it certainly

1234
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:38,559
there's some good to that it certainly
 

1235
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,750
there's some good to that it certainly
attracts lots of young people to our

1236
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:39,760
attracts lots of young people to our
 

1237
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,750
attracts lots of young people to our
field but a lot of those people come in

1238
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:41,760
field but a lot of those people come in
 

1239
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,750
field but a lot of those people come in
with strong misconceptions and they have

1240
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:43,760
with strong misconceptions and they have
 

1241
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,669
with strong misconceptions and they have
to then unlearn those and then find

1242
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:45,679
to then unlearn those and then find
 

1243
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,270
to then unlearn those and then find
something you know

1244
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:47,280
something you know
 

1245
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,150
something you know
to do

1246
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:48,160
to do
 

1247
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,990
to do
um and so i think there's just got to be

1248
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:50,000
um and so i think there's just got to be
 

1249
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,830
um and so i think there's just got to be
some multiple voices and there's i

1250
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:51,840
some multiple voices and there's i
 

1251
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,110
some multiple voices and there's i
didn't i wasn't hearing enough of the

1252
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:53,120
didn't i wasn't hearing enough of the
 

1253
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,710
didn't i wasn't hearing enough of the
more sober voice

1254
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:54,720
more sober voice
 

1255
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,150
more sober voice
so uh as a continuation of a fun tangent

1256
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,160
so uh as a continuation of a fun tangent
 

1257
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,750
so uh as a continuation of a fun tangent
and speaking of vibrant personalities

1258
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:01,760
and speaking of vibrant personalities
 

1259
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,750
and speaking of vibrant personalities
what would you say is the most

1260
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:03,760
what would you say is the most
 

1261
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,430
what would you say is the most
interesting disagreement you have with

1262
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:05,440
interesting disagreement you have with
 

1263
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,190
interesting disagreement you have with
yon lacoon

1264
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:07,200
yon lacoon
 

1265
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,830
yon lacoon
so john's an old friend and i just say

1266
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:09,840
so john's an old friend and i just say
 

1267
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,909
so john's an old friend and i just say
that i i don't think we disagree about

1268
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:11,919
that i i don't think we disagree about
 

1269
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,510
that i i don't think we disagree about
very much really

1270
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:13,520
very much really
 

1271
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,750
very much really
he and i both kind of have a let's build

1272
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:15,760
he and i both kind of have a let's build
 

1273
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,470
he and i both kind of have a let's build
that kind of mentality and does it work

1274
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:18,480
that kind of mentality and does it work
 

1275
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,230
that kind of mentality and does it work
kind of mentality and uh kind of

1276
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:20,240
kind of mentality and uh kind of
 

1277
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,230
kind of mentality and uh kind of
concrete um we both speak french and we

1278
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:22,240
concrete um we both speak french and we
 

1279
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,070
concrete um we both speak french and we
speak french more together and we have

1280
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,080
speak french more together and we have
 

1281
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,909
speak french more together and we have
we have a lot a lot in common

1282
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:25,919
we have a lot a lot in common
 

1283
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:26,870
we have a lot a lot in common
um

1284
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:26,880
um
 

1285
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,230
um
and so you know if one wanted to

1286
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:28,240
and so you know if one wanted to
 

1287
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,549
and so you know if one wanted to
highlight a a disagreement it's not

1288
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:30,559
highlight a a disagreement it's not
 

1289
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,149
highlight a a disagreement it's not
really a fundamental one i think it's

1290
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:32,159
really a fundamental one i think it's
 

1291
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,789
really a fundamental one i think it's
just kind of where we're emphasizing um

1292
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:34,799
just kind of where we're emphasizing um
 

1293
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,430
just kind of where we're emphasizing um
jan has uh emphasized pattern

1294
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:37,440
jan has uh emphasized pattern
 

1295
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,110
jan has uh emphasized pattern
recognition and

1296
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:39,120
recognition and
 

1297
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,350
recognition and
uh has emphasized prediction

1298
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:41,360
uh has emphasized prediction
 

1299
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,669
uh has emphasized prediction
all right so you know um and it's

1300
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:43,679
all right so you know um and it's
 

1301
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:44,870
all right so you know um and it's
interesting to try to take that as far

1302
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:44,880
interesting to try to take that as far
 

1303
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,070
interesting to try to take that as far
as you can if you could do perfect

1304
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:46,080
as you can if you could do perfect
 

1305
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,430
as you can if you could do perfect
prediction what would that give you kind

1306
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:47,440
prediction what would that give you kind
 

1307
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,110
prediction what would that give you kind
of as a thought experiment

1308
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:49,120
of as a thought experiment
 

1309
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,230
of as a thought experiment
um

1310
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:50,240
um
 

1311
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,950
um
and um i think that's

1312
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:52,960
and um i think that's
 

1313
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,029
and um i think that's
way too limited um

1314
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:55,039
way too limited um
 

1315
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,789
way too limited um
we cannot do perfect prediction we will

1316
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:56,799
we cannot do perfect prediction we will
 

1317
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,149
we cannot do perfect prediction we will
never have the data sets allow me to

00:20:58,149 --> 00:20:58,159
never have the data sets allow me to

1323
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,390
what question you're going to ask next i
have no clue i will never know such

1324
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:02,400
have no clue i will never know such
 

1325

things moreover most of us find

1326
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:04,720
things moreover most of us find
 

1327
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,630
things moreover most of us find
ourselves during the day in all kinds of

1328
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:06,640
ourselves during the day in all kinds of
 

1329
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,029
ourselves during the day in all kinds of
situations we had no anticipation of

1330
00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:09,039
situations we had no anticipation of
 

1331
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,270
situations we had no anticipation of
that are kind of very very

1332
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:11,280
that are kind of very very
 

1333
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,110
that are kind of very very
novel in various ways

1334
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:13,120
novel in various ways
 

1335
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,029
novel in various ways
and in that moment we want to think

1336
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:15,039
and in that moment we want to think
 

1337
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,789
and in that moment we want to think
through what we want and also there's

1338
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:16,799
through what we want and also there's
 

1339
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,029
through what we want and also there's
going to be market forces acting on us

1340
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:19,039
going to be market forces acting on us

gathered the data
 

1407
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,789
gathered the data
you know it i could go on and on i hope

1408
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:16,799
you know it i could go on and on i hope
 

1409
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,870
you know it i could go on and on i hope
you can see and i don't i think that if

1410
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:18,880
you can see and i don't i think that if
 

1411
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,870
you can see and i don't i think that if
you say predictions everything that that

1412
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:20,880
you say predictions everything that that
 

1413
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,350
you say predictions everything that that
you're missing all of this stuff

1414
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:23,360
you're missing all of this stuff
 

1415
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,669
you're missing all of this stuff
and so prediction plus decision making

1416
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:25,679
and so prediction plus decision making
 

1417
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:26,870
and so prediction plus decision making
is everything but both of them are

1418
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:26,880
is everything but both of them are
 

1419
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,870
is everything but both of them are
equally important and so the field has

1420
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:28,880
equally important and so the field has
 

1421
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,510
equally important and so the field has
emphasized prediction yan rightly so has

1422
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:31,520
emphasized prediction yan rightly so has
 

1423
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,350
emphasized prediction yan rightly so has
seen how powerful that is

1424
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:33,360
seen how powerful that is
 

1425
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,350
seen how powerful that is
but at the cost of people not being

1426
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:35,360
but at the cost of people not being
 

1427
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,789
but at the cost of people not being
aware that decision making is where the

1428
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:36,799
aware that decision making is where the
 

1429
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,470
aware that decision making is where the
rubber really hits the road where human

1445
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,149
blah
i'm not the only one working on those

1446
00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:50,159
i'm not the only one working on those
 

1447
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,390
i'm not the only one working on those
but we're a smaller tribe and right now

1448
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:52,400
but we're a smaller tribe and right now
 

1449
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,230
but we're a smaller tribe and right now
we're not the the one that people talk

1450
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:54,240
we're not the the one that people talk
 

1451
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,149
we're not the the one that people talk
about the most um

1452
00:22:56,149 --> 00:22:56,159
about the most um
 

1453
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,350
about the most um
but you know if you go out in the real

1454
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:57,360
but you know if you go out in the real
 

1455
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,230
but you know if you go out in the real
world in industry um you know at amazon

1456
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:00,240
world in industry um you know at amazon
 

1457
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,270
world in industry um you know at amazon
i'd say half the people there are

1458
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:01,280
i'd say half the people there are
 

1459
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,710
i'd say half the people there are
working on decision making and the other

1460
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:02,720
working on decision making and the other
 

1461
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,909
working on decision making and the other
half are doing you know the pattern

1462
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:03,919
half are doing you know the pattern
 

1463
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,909
half are doing you know the pattern
recognition it's important and the words

1464
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:05,919
recognition it's important and the words
 

1465
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,669
recognition it's important and the words
of pattern recognition and prediction i

1466
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:07,679
of pattern recognition and prediction i
 

1467
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,510
of pattern recognition and prediction i
think the distinction there

1468
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:09,520
think the distinction there
 

1469
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,510
think the distinction there
not to linger on words but the

1470
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:11,520
not to linger on words but the
 

1471
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,669
not to linger on words but the
distinction there is more a constrained

1472
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:13,679
distinction there is more a constrained
 

1473
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,390
distinction there is more a constrained
sort of in the lab data set versus

1474
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:16,400
sort of in the lab data set versus
 

1475
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,990
sort of in the lab data set versus
decision making is talking about

1476
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,000
decision making is talking about
 

1477
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,909
decision making is talking about
consequential decisions in the real

1478
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:19,919
consequential decisions in the real
 

1479
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,350
consequential decisions in the real
world under the messiness and the

1480
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:21,360
world under the messiness and the
 

1481
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,350
world under the messiness and the
uncertainty of the real world

1482
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:23,360
uncertainty of the real world
 

1483
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,630
uncertainty of the real world
and just

1484
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:24,640
and just
 

1485
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,830
and just
the whole of it the whole mess of it

1486
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:25,840
the whole of it the whole mess of it
 

1487
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,270
the whole of it the whole mess of it
that actually touches human beings and

1488
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:27,280
that actually touches human beings and
 

1489
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,270
that actually touches human beings and
scale like you said market forces that's

1490
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:29,280
scale like you said market forces that's
 

1491
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,350
scale like you said market forces that's
the that's the distinction yeah it helps

1492
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:31,360
the that's the distinction yeah it helps
 

1493
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,950
the that's the distinction yeah it helps
add those that perspective that broader

1494
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:32,960
add those that perspective that broader
 

1495
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,190
add those that perspective that broader
perspective you're right i totally agree

1496
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:35,200
perspective you're right i totally agree
 

1497
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,549
perspective you're right i totally agree
uh on the other hand if you're a real

1498
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:36,559
uh on the other hand if you're a real
 

1499
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,750
uh on the other hand if you're a real
prediction person of course you want it

1500
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:37,760
prediction person of course you want it
 

1501
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,710
prediction person of course you want it
to be in the real world you want to

1502
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:38,720
to be in the real world you want to
 

1503
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,830
to be in the real world you want to
predict real world events i'm just

1504
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:39,840
predict real world events i'm just
 

1505
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,669
predict real world events i'm just
saying that's not possible with just

1506
00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:41,679
saying that's not possible with just
 

1507
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,750
saying that's not possible with just
data sets uh that it has to be in the

1508
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:43,760
data sets uh that it has to be in the
 

1509
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,390
data sets uh that it has to be in the
context of you know uh strategic things

1510
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:46,400
context of you know uh strategic things
 

1511
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,750
context of you know uh strategic things
that someone's doing data they might

1512
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:47,760
that someone's doing data they might
 

1513
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,029
that someone's doing data they might
gather things they could have gathered

1514
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:49,039
gather things they could have gathered
 

1515
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,789
gather things they could have gathered
the reasoning process around data it's

1516
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:50,799
the reasoning process around data it's
 

1517
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:51,990
the reasoning process around data it's
not just taking data and making

1518
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,000
not just taking data and making
 

1519
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,990
not just taking data and making
predictions based on the data so one of

1520
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,000
predictions based on the data so one of
 

1521
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,710
predictions based on the data so one of
the the things that you're working on

1522
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:56,720
the the things that you're working on
 

1523
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,990
the the things that you're working on
i'm sure there's others working on it

1524
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:58,000
i'm sure there's others working on it
 

1525
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,269
i'm sure there's others working on it
but i don't hear often

1526
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:01,279

 

1527
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,789

it talked about especially in the

1528
00:24:02,789 --> 00:24:02,799
it talked about especially in the
 

1529
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,950
it talked about especially in the
clarity that you talk about it and i

1530
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:04,960
clarity that you talk about it and i
 

1531
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,390
clarity that you talk about it and i
think it's both the most exciting and

1532
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:06,400
think it's both the most exciting and
 

1533
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,789
think it's both the most exciting and
the most concerning area

1534
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:08,799
the most concerning area
 

1535
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,430
the most concerning area
of ai in terms of decision making so

1536
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:11,440
of ai in terms of decision making so
 

1537
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,029
of ai in terms of decision making so
you've talked about ai systems that help

1538
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:13,039
you've talked about ai systems that help
 

1539
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,710
you've talked about ai systems that help
make decisions that scale in a

1540
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:14,720
make decisions that scale in a
 

1541
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,470
make decisions that scale in a
distributed way millions billions

1542
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:16,480
distributed way millions billions
 

1543
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,669
distributed way millions billions
decisions

1544
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:17,679
decisions
 

1545
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,669
decisions
it's sort of markets of decisions can

1546
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:19,679
it's sort of markets of decisions can
 

1547
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,990
it's sort of markets of decisions can
you as a starting point sort of give an

1548
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:22,000
you as a starting point sort of give an
 

1549
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,630
you as a starting point sort of give an
example of a system that you think about

1550
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:24,640
example of a system that you think about
 

1551
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,149
example of a system that you think about
when you're thinking about these kinds

1552
00:24:26,149 --> 00:24:26,159
when you're thinking about these kinds
 

1553
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,190
when you're thinking about these kinds
of systems

1554
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:27,200
of systems
 

1555
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,789
of systems
uh yeah so first of all you're

1556
00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:28,799
uh yeah so first of all you're
 

1557
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,070
uh yeah so first of all you're
absolutely getting into some territory

1558
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:30,080
absolutely getting into some territory
 

1559
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,470
absolutely getting into some territory
which i will be beyond my expertise and

1560
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:32,480
which i will be beyond my expertise and
 

1561
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,750
which i will be beyond my expertise and
and there are lots of things that are

1562
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:33,760
and there are lots of things that are
 

1563
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,269
and there are lots of things that are
going to be very non-obvious to think

1564
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:35,279
going to be very non-obvious to think
 

1565
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,350
going to be very non-obvious to think
about just like just

1566
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:37,360
about just like just
 

1567
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,470
about just like just
again i like to think about history a

1568
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:38,480
again i like to think about history a
 

1569
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,830
again i like to think about history a
little bit but think about put yourself

1570
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:39,840
little bit but think about put yourself
 

1571
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,190
little bit but think about put yourself
back in the 60s there was kind of a

1572
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:41,200
back in the 60s there was kind of a
 

1573
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,950
back in the 60s there was kind of a
banking system that wasn't computerized

1574
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:42,960
banking system that wasn't computerized
 

1575
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,470
banking system that wasn't computerized
really there was there was database

1576
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:44,480
really there was there was database
 

1577
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,950
really there was there was database
theory emerging and database people had

1578
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:46,960
theory emerging and database people had
 

1579
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,230
theory emerging and database people had
to think about how do i actually not

1580
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:48,240
to think about how do i actually not
 

1581
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,990
to think about how do i actually not
just move data around but actual money

1582
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:50,000
just move data around but actual money
 

1583
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,909
just move data around but actual money
and have it be you know

1584
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:51,919
and have it be you know
 

1585
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,149
and have it be you know
valid and have transactions that atms

1586
00:24:54,149 --> 00:24:54,159
valid and have transactions that atms
 

1587
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,590
valid and have transactions that atms
happen that are actually you know all

1588
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:55,600
happen that are actually you know all
 

1589
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,029
happen that are actually you know all
valid and

1590
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:57,039
valid and
 

1591
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,110
valid and
so on so forth so that's the kind of

1592
00:24:59,110 --> 00:24:59,120
so on so forth so that's the kind of
 

1593
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,470
so on so forth so that's the kind of
issues you get into when you start to

1594
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:00,480
issues you get into when you start to
 

1595
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,909
issues you get into when you start to
get serious about sort of things like

1596
00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:01,919
get serious about sort of things like
 

1597
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:02,870
get serious about sort of things like
this

1598
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:02,880
this
 

1599
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,789
this
i like to think about as kind of almost

1600
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:04,799
i like to think about as kind of almost
 

1601
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,870
i like to think about as kind of almost
a thought experiment to help me think uh

they will create the system just like

1950
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:21,360
they will create the system just like
 

1951

entity you don't hire them per se
 

1971
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,029
entity you don't hire them per se
right you have to create an ecosystem in

1972
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:41,039
right you have to create an ecosystem in
 

1973
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,110
right you have to create an ecosystem in
which they are wanted and that they

1974
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:43,120
which they are wanted and that they
 

1975
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,269
which they are wanted and that they
belong right so you have to have some

1976
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:45,279
belong right so you have to have some
 

1977
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,710

right and so with movies you can kind of
 

1991
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,789
right and so with movies you can kind of
go give a large sum of money to somebody

you got a partner right and um so but
anyway you know not to integrate these

asking these questions and some of them
 

2035
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,029
asking these questions and some of them
are even making an effort but it is it

is partly a respect the culture as you
 

2039
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,549
is partly a respect the culture as you
were as a technology person you got to

were as a technology person you got to
 

2041
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,190
were as a technology person you got to

cultural uh you know meaning how much of

2044
00:31:50,389 --> 00:31:50,399
cultural uh you know meaning how much of
 

2045
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,310
cultural uh you know meaning how much of
a role do you think the algorithm

2046
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:52,320
a role do you think the algorithm
 

2047
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,470
a role do you think the algorithm
machine learning has in connecting the

2048
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:54,480
machine learning has in connecting the
 

2049
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,789
machine learning has in connecting the
consumer to the creator

sort of uh the recommender system aspect

2052
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:58,960
sort of uh the recommender system aspect
 

2053
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,789
sort of uh the recommender system aspect
of this yeah it's a great question i

2054
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:00,799
of this yeah it's a great question i
 

2055
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,269
of this yeah it's a great question i
think pretty high recommend you know um

2056
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:03,279
think pretty high recommend you know um
 

2057
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,029
think pretty high recommend you know um
there's no magic in the algorithms but a

2058
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:05,039
there's no magic in the algorithms but a
 

2059
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,110
there's no magic in the algorithms but a
good recommender system is way better

2060
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:07,120
good recommender system is way better
 

2061
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,350
good recommender system is way better
than a bad recommender system and uh

2062
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:09,360
than a bad recommender system and uh
 

2063
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,110
than a bad recommender system and uh
recommender systems was a billion dollar

2064
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:11,120
recommender systems was a billion dollar

2137
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,430
it really is trying to find out what's
in the data uh it doesn't work so well

2138
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:17,440
in the data uh it doesn't work so well
 

2139
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,870
in the data uh it doesn't work so well
for other kind of entities but that's

2140
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:18,880
for other kind of entities but that's
 

2141
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,389
for other kind of entities but that's
just the complexity of human life like

with other
 

2161
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,230

think it's a solvable problem for
 

2197
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,190
think it's a solvable problem for
machines or is it a deeply human problem

machines or is it a deeply human problem
 

2199
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,190

that's unsolvable uh so i don't even

2200
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:19,200
that's unsolvable uh so i don't even
 

2201
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,710
that's unsolvable uh so i don't even
think about it that level i think that

dominated by the google facebook kind of

2526
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:53,440
dominated by the google facebook kind of
 

2527
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,030
dominated by the google facebook kind of
mentality and the subscription and

2528
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:55,040
mentality and the subscription and
 

2529
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,870
mentality and the subscription and
advertising and that is that's the core

2530
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:56,880
advertising and that is that's the core
 

2531
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,990
advertising and that is that's the core
problem

2532
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:58,000
problem
 

2533
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,310
problem
right the fake news actually rides on

2534
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:00,320
right the fake news actually rides on
 

2535
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,870
right the fake news actually rides on
top of that because it means that you're

2536
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:02,880
top of that because it means that you're
 

2537
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,390
top of that because it means that you're
monetizing with click-through rate and

2538
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:04,400
monetizing with click-through rate and
 

2539
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,750
monetizing with click-through rate and
that is the core problem you got to

2540
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:05,760
that is the core problem you got to
 

2541
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,230
that is the core problem you got to
remove that so advertisement

2542
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:08,240
remove that so advertisement
 

2543
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,750

so
 

2553
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,069

00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,910
so we have to fix
we have to build algorithms that

2562
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:25,920
we have to build algorithms that
 

2563
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,510

i will look at it and and so that's part

2736
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:04,000
i will look at it and and so that's part
 

2737
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,430
i will look at it and and so that's part
of the overall information flow in a

2738
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:05,440
of the overall information flow in a
 

2739
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,390
of the overall information flow in a
good market uh so advertising has a role

um but the problem is of course that
 

2743
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,230
um but the problem is of course that
that signal is now completely gone

2744
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:12,240
that signal is now completely gone
 

2745
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,069
that signal is now completely gone
because it just you know dominar by

2746
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:14,079
because it just you know dominar by
 

2747
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:15,589
because it just you know dominar by
these tiny little things that add up to

2748
00:42:15,589 --> 00:42:15,599
these tiny little things that add up to
 

2749
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,190
these tiny little things that add up to
big money for the company

big money for the company
 

2751
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,349
big money for the company
you know so i i think it will just i

2752
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:19,359
you know so i i think it will just i
 

2753
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:20,790
you know so i i think it will just i
think it will change because the

2754
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:20,800
think it will change because the
 

2755
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,710
think it will change because the
societies just don't you know stick with

2756
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:22,720
societies just don't you know stick with
 

2757
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,710
societies just don't you know stick with
things that annoy a lot of people and

2758
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:24,720
things that annoy a lot of people and
 

2759
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,390
things that annoy a lot of people and
advertising currently annoys people more

2760
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:26,400
advertising currently annoys people more
 

2761
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,230
advertising currently annoys people more
than it provides information

2762
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:28,240
than it provides information
 

2763
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,990
than it provides information
and i think that at google probably is

2764
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:30,000
and i think that at google probably is
 

2765
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,670
and i think that at google probably is
smart enough to figure out that this is

2766
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:31,680
smart enough to figure out that this is
 

2767
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,750
smart enough to figure out that this is
a dead this is a bad model even though

2768
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:33,760
a dead this is a bad model even though
 

2769
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,030
a dead this is a bad model even though
it's a hard huge amount of money and

2770
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:35,040
it's a hard huge amount of money and
 

2771
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,309
it's a hard huge amount of money and
they'll have to figure out how to pull

2772
00:42:36,309 --> 00:42:36,319
they'll have to figure out how to pull
 

2773
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,390
they'll have to figure out how to pull
it away from it and slowly and i'm sure

2774
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:38,400
it away from it and slowly and i'm sure
 

2775
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,950
it away from it and slowly and i'm sure
the ceo there will figure it out but um

2776
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:40,960
the ceo there will figure it out but um
 

2777
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,990
the ceo there will figure it out but um
they need to do it and uh they need to

2778
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:44,000
they need to do it and uh they need to
 

2779

paid and they take a five percent cut
that five percent could start to get big

2792
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:56,000
that five percent could start to get big
 

2793
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,910
that five percent could start to get big

i apologize if it's just a matter of
 

2877
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:19,829

algorithmically to where it actually

2884
00:44:24,069 --> 00:44:24,079
algorithmically to where it actually
 

2885
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,910
algorithmically to where it actually
becomes a connection almost address

2886
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:25,920
becomes a connection almost address
 

2887
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:26,870
becomes a connection almost address
that's a good question so let's

that's a good question so let's
 

2889
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,589
that's a good question so let's
component all that push first of all i i

2890
00:44:29,589 --> 00:44:29,599
component all that push first of all i i
 

2891
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:30,870
component all that push first of all i i
what we just talked about i was

2899
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,750
into a market that don't come any other
way especially algorithmically it's a

2900
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:37,760
way especially algorithmically it's a
 

2901
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,349
way especially algorithmically it's a
sign that someone spent money on it it's

2902
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:39,359

00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:11,040
wouldn't want it i wouldn't have wanted
 

3329
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,349
wouldn't want it i wouldn't have wanted
it per se because um

3330
00:51:13,349 --> 00:51:13,359
it per se because um
 

3331
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:15,030
it per se because um
there should be also sites where that's

3332
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:15,040
there should be also sites where that's
 

3333
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,549
there should be also sites where that's
not actually the goal the goal is to

3334
00:51:16,549 --> 00:51:16,559
not actually the goal the goal is to
 

3335
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,710
not actually the goal the goal is to
actually have a broadcast channel that i

3336
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:18,720
actually have a broadcast channel that i
 

3337
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,710
actually have a broadcast channel that i
monetize in some other way if i chose to

3338
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:20,720
monetize in some other way if i chose to
 

3339
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,030
monetize in some other way if i chose to
i mean i could now people know about it

3340
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:23,040
i mean i could now people know about it
 

3341
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,030
i mean i could now people know about it
i could i'm not doing it but um that's

3342
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:25,040
i could i'm not doing it but um that's
 

3343
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,870
i could i'm not doing it but um that's
fine with me there also the musicians

3344
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:26,880
fine with me there also the musicians
 

3345
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,630
fine with me there also the musicians
who are making all this music i don't

3346
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:28,640
who are making all this music i don't
 

3347
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,069
who are making all this music i don't
think the right model is that you pay a

3348
00:51:30,069 --> 00:51:30,079
think the right model is that you pay a
 

3349
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:31,910
think the right model is that you pay a
little subscription fee to them all

3350
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:31,920
little subscription fee to them all
 

3351
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,430
little subscription fee to them all
right because because people can copy

3352
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:33,440
right because because people can copy
 

3353
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,950
right because because people can copy
the bits too easily and it's just not

3354
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:34,960
the bits too easily and it's just not
 

3355
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,549
the bits too easily and it's just not
that somewhere the value is the value is

3356
00:51:36,549 --> 00:51:36,559
that somewhere the value is the value is
 

3357
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:38,150
that somewhere the value is the value is
that a connection was made between real

3358
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:38,160
that a connection was made between real
 

3359
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,910
that a connection was made between real
human beings then you can follow up on

3360
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:39,920
human beings then you can follow up on
 

3361
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:40,870
human beings then you can follow up on
that

3362
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:40,880
that
 

3363
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,430
that
right and create yet more value so no i

3364
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:43,440
right and create yet more value so no i
 

3365
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,030
right and create yet more value so no i
think um

3366
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:45,040
think um
 

3367
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,630
think um

00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:10,000
so i don't know how to do this and i'm
 

3795
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,069
so i don't know how to do this and i'm
not a privacy researcher per se i just i

3796
00:58:12,069 --> 00:58:12,079
not a privacy researcher per se i just i
 

3797
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:14,150
not a privacy researcher per se i just i
recognize the vast complexity of this

3798
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:14,160
recognize the vast complexity of this
 

3799
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,910
recognize the vast complexity of this
it's not just technology it's not just

3800
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:15,920
it's not just technology it's not just
 

3801

there's got to be kind of whole layers

3804
00:58:20,309 --> 00:58:20,319
there's got to be kind of whole layers
 

3805
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:22,150
there's got to be kind of whole layers
around it and so i when i allude to this

3806
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:22,160
around it and so i when i allude to this
 

3807
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,630
around it and so i when i allude to this
emerging engineering field this is a big

3808
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:24,640
emerging engineering field this is a big
 

3809
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:25,670
emerging engineering field this is a big
part of it

3810
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:25,680
part of it
 

3811
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,990
part of it
um like when electrical engineering come

3812
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:28,000
um like when electrical engineering come
 

3813
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,510
um like when electrical engineering come
came i'm not wasn't around in the time

3814
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:29,520
came i'm not wasn't around in the time

but
 

3817
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,390
but
you just didn't plug electricity you

3818
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:32,400
you just didn't plug electricity you
 

3819
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,750
you just didn't plug electricity you
know into walls and it all kind of

3820
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:33,760
know into walls and it all kind of
 

3821
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,950
know into walls and it all kind of
worked you don't have to have like

3822
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:34,960
worked you don't have to have like
 

3823
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,710
worked you don't have to have like
underwriter's laboratory that reassured

3824
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:36,720
underwriter's laboratory that reassured
 

3825
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,150
underwriter's laboratory that reassured
you that that plug's not going to burn

3826
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:38,160
you that that plug's not going to burn

people who can install things there'll
 

3835
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,150
people who can install things there'll
be people who can watch the installers

there'll be a whole layers you know an

3838
00:58:47,829 --> 00:58:47,839
there'll be a whole layers you know an
 

3839
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:49,670
there'll be a whole layers you know an
onion of these kind of things

3840
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:49,680
onion of these kind of things
 

3841
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,750
onion of these kind of things
and for things as deeply

3842
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:51,760
and for things as deeply
 

3843
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,349
and for things as deeply
interesting as privacy which is his

3844
00:58:53,349 --> 00:58:53,359
interesting as privacy which is his
 

3845
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:55,190
interesting as privacy which is his
least essential electricity

3846
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:55,200
least essential electricity
 

3847
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,950
least essential electricity
um that that's gonna take decades to

3848
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:56,960
um that that's gonna take decades to
 

3849
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,309
um that that's gonna take decades to
kind of work out but it's gonna require

3850
00:58:58,309 --> 00:58:58,319
kind of work out but it's gonna require
 

3851
00:58:58,319 --> 00:58:59,589
kind of work out but it's gonna require
a lot of new structures that we don't

3852
00:58:59,589 --> 00:58:59,599
a lot of new structures that we don't
 

3853
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:00,870
a lot of new structures that we don't
have right now so it's kind of hard to

3854
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:00,880
have right now so it's kind of hard to
 

3855
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,069
have right now so it's kind of hard to
talk about it

3856
00:59:02,069 --> 00:59:02,079
talk about it
 

3857
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:03,349
talk about it
and you're saying there's a lot of money

3858
00:59:03,349 --> 00:59:03,359
and you're saying there's a lot of money
 

3859
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:04,950
and you're saying there's a lot of money
to be made if you get it right so

3860
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:04,960
to be made if you get it right so
 

3861
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,030
to be made if you get it right so
absolutely a lot of money to be made and

3862
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:07,040
absolutely a lot of money to be made and
 

3863
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,230
absolutely a lot of money to be made and
all these things that provide human

3864
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:08,240
all these things that provide human
 

3865
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,910
all these things that provide human
services and people recognize them as

3866
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:09,920
services and people recognize them as
 

3867
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,270
services and people recognize them as
useful parts

3868
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:11,280
useful parts
 

3869
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,190
useful parts
of their lives uh so yeah

3870
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:13,200
of their lives uh so yeah
 

3871
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,069

so yeah the dialect sometimes goes from
 

3875
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:18,390
so yeah the dialect sometimes goes from
the exuberant technologists

challenging ones to have are where we
 

3889
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,589
challenging ones to have are where we
need to be having our conversations and

need to be having our conversations and
 

3891
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:32,950
need to be having our conversations and
you know there's not actually there's

3892
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:32,960
you know there's not actually there's
 

3893
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,510
you know there's not actually there's
not many forum forum for those

um you know there's that's that's kind
 

3897
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,430
um you know there's that's that's kind
of what i would look for maybe i could

3898

of what i would look for maybe i could
 

3899
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,109
of what i would look for maybe i could
go and i could read a comment section of

3900
00:59:41,109 --> 00:59:41,119
go and i could read a comment section of
 

3901

01:00:28,789 --> 01:00:28,799
going to waste a lot of my time even
 

3951
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,390
going to waste a lot of my time even
though there was some value

3952
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:30,400
though there was some value
 

3953
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,190
though there was some value
um and so yeah worlds that are somehow

3954
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:33,200
um and so yeah worlds that are somehow
 

3955
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,309
um and so yeah worlds that are somehow
you enter in you know what you're

3956
01:00:34,309 --> 01:00:34,319
you enter in you know what you're
 

3957
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:36,230
you enter in you know what you're
getting and it's kind of appeals to you

3958
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:36,240
getting and it's kind of appeals to you
 

3959
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,910
getting and it's kind of appeals to you
might new things might happen but you

3960
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:37,920
might new things might happen but you
 

3961
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,430
might new things might happen but you
kind of have some some trust in that

3962
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:39,440
kind of have some some trust in that
 

3963
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,549
kind of have some some trust in that
world

3964
01:00:40,549 --> 01:00:40,559
world
 

3965
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:42,710
world
and there's some deep interesting

3966
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:42,720
and there's some deep interesting
 

3967
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,950
and there's some deep interesting
complex psychological aspects around

3968
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:44,960
complex psychological aspects around
 

3969
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,270
complex psychological aspects around
anonymity uh how that changes human

3970
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:47,280
anonymity uh how that changes human
 

3971
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,990
anonymity uh how that changes human
behavior indeed quite dark and quite

3972
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:50,000
behavior indeed quite dark and quite
 

3973
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,150
behavior indeed quite dark and quite
dark yeah i think a lot of us are

3974
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:52,160
dark yeah i think a lot of us are
 

3975
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,109
dark yeah i think a lot of us are
especially

3976
01:00:53,109 --> 01:00:53,119
especially
 

3977
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,870
especially
those of us who really love the advent

3978
01:00:54,870 --> 01:00:54,880
those of us who really love the advent
 

3979
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,150
those of us who really love the advent
of technology i loved social networks

3980
01:00:56,150 --> 01:00:56,160
of technology i loved social networks
 

3981
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,589
of technology i loved social networks
when it came out i was just i didn't see

3982
01:00:57,589 --> 01:00:57,599
when it came out i was just i didn't see
 

3983
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:59,270
when it came out i was just i didn't see
any negatives there at all

3984
01:00:59,270 --> 01:00:59,280
any negatives there at all
 

3985
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,270
any negatives there at all
but then i started uh seeing comment

3986
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:01,280
but then i started uh seeing comment
 

3987
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,950
but then i started uh seeing comment
sections i think it was maybe you know

3988
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:02,960
sections i think it was maybe you know
 

3989
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,470
sections i think it was maybe you know
cnn or something

3990
01:01:04,470 --> 01:01:04,480
cnn or something
 

3991
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,230
cnn or something
and i started going wow this this

3992
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:06,240
and i started going wow this this
 

3993
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,950
and i started going wow this this
darkness i just did not know about and

3994
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:08,960
darkness i just did not know about and
 

3995
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,950
darkness i just did not know about and
um and our technology is now amplifying

3996
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:10,960
um and our technology is now amplifying
 

3997
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:11,670
um and our technology is now amplifying
it

3998
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:11,680
it
 

3999
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,349
it
so sorry for the big philosophical

4000
01:01:13,349 --> 01:01:13,359
so sorry for the big philosophical
 

4001
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:15,030
so sorry for the big philosophical
question but on that topic do you think

4002
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:15,040
question but on that topic do you think
 

4003
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,710
question but on that topic do you think
human beings because you've also out of

4004
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:16,720
human beings because you've also out of
 

4005
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:20,150
human beings because you've also out of
all things had a foot in psychology too

4006
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:20,160
all things had a foot in psychology too
 

4007
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,750
all things had a foot in psychology too
the do you think human beings are

4008
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:21,760
the do you think human beings are
 

4009
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,589
the do you think human beings are
fundamentally good

4010
01:01:23,589 --> 01:01:23,599
fundamentally good
 

4011
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:25,670
fundamentally good
like all of us have

4012
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:25,680
like all of us have
 

4013
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,950
like all of us have
good intent that could be mined or

4014
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:28,960
good intent that could be mined or
 

4015
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,109
good intent that could be mined or
is it

4016
01:01:31,109 --> 01:01:31,119
is it
 

4017
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:32,950
is it
depending on context and environment

4018
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:32,960
depending on context and environment
 

4019
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,789
depending on context and environment
everybody could be evil

4020
01:01:34,789 --> 01:01:34,799
everybody could be evil
 

4021
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:37,030
everybody could be evil
thought my answer is fundamentally good

4022
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:37,040
thought my answer is fundamentally good
 

4023
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,510
thought my answer is fundamentally good
um but fundamentally limited all of us

4024
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:39,520
um but fundamentally limited all of us
 

4025
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,430
um but fundamentally limited all of us
have very you know blinkers on we don't

4026
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:41,440
have very you know blinkers on we don't
 

4027
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,750
have very you know blinkers on we don't
see the other person's pain that easily

4028
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:43,760
see the other person's pain that easily
 

4029
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,349
see the other person's pain that easily
we don't see the other person's point of

4030
01:01:45,349 --> 01:01:45,359
we don't see the other person's point of
 

4031
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:47,349
we don't see the other person's point of
view that easily we're very much in our

4032
01:01:47,349 --> 01:01:47,359
view that easily we're very much in our
 

4033
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:49,589
view that easily we're very much in our
own head in our own world

4034
01:01:49,589 --> 01:01:49,599
own head in our own world
 

4035
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:51,349
own head in our own world
and on my good days i think that

4036
01:01:51,349 --> 01:01:51,359
and on my good days i think that
 

4037
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:53,030
and on my good days i think that
technology could open us up to you know

4038
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:53,040
technology could open us up to you know
 

4039
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,549
technology could open us up to you know
more perspectives and more less

4040
01:01:54,549 --> 01:01:54,559
more perspectives and more less
 

4041
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,470
more perspectives and more less
blinkered and more understanding you

4042
01:01:56,470 --> 01:01:56,480
blinkered and more understanding you
 

4043
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,230
blinkered and more understanding you
know a lot of wars in human history

4044
01:01:58,230 --> 01:01:58,240
know a lot of wars in human history
 

4045
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,910
know a lot of wars in human history
happen because of just ignorance they

4046
01:01:59,910 --> 01:01:59,920
happen because of just ignorance they
 

4047
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,190
happen because of just ignorance they
didn't they they thought the other

4048
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:01,200
didn't they they thought the other
 

4049
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,309
didn't they they thought the other
person was doing this well other person

4050
01:02:02,309 --> 01:02:02,319
person was doing this well other person
 

4051
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:03,589
person was doing this well other person
wasn't doing this and we have huge

4052
01:02:03,589 --> 01:02:03,599
wasn't doing this and we have huge
 

4053
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:06,069
wasn't doing this and we have huge
amounts of that um but in my lifetime

4054
01:02:06,069 --> 01:02:06,079
amounts of that um but in my lifetime
 

4055
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,750
amounts of that um but in my lifetime
i've not seen technology really help in

4056
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:07,760
i've not seen technology really help in
 

4057
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,789
i've not seen technology really help in
that way yet and i do i do i do believe

4058
01:02:10,789 --> 01:02:10,799
that way yet and i do i do i do believe
 

4059
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:11,829
that way yet and i do i do i do believe
in that but

4060
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:11,839
in that but
 

4061
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:13,589
in that but
you know no i think fundamentally humans

4062
01:02:13,589 --> 01:02:13,599
you know no i think fundamentally humans
 

4063
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:15,430
you know no i think fundamentally humans
are good the people suffer people have

4064
01:02:15,430 --> 01:02:15,440
are good the people suffer people have
 

4065
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,029
are good the people suffer people have
grievances because you have grudges and

4066
01:02:17,029 --> 01:02:17,039
grievances because you have grudges and
 

4067
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:18,309
grievances because you have grudges and
those things cause them to do things

4068
01:02:18,309 --> 01:02:18,319
those things cause them to do things
 

4069
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:19,829
those things cause them to do things
they probably wouldn't want

4070
01:02:19,829 --> 01:02:19,839
they probably wouldn't want
 

4071
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:22,470
they probably wouldn't want
they regret it often um

4072
01:02:22,470 --> 01:02:22,480
they regret it often um
 

4073
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,950
they regret it often um
so no i i i think it's a

4074
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:24,960
so no i i i think it's a
 

4075
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,630
so no i i i think it's a
you know part of the progress of

4076
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:26,640
you know part of the progress of
 

4077
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,630
you know part of the progress of
technology is to indeed allow it to be a

4078
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:28,640
technology is to indeed allow it to be a
 

4079
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,069
technology is to indeed allow it to be a
little easier to be the real good person

4080
01:02:30,069 --> 01:02:30,079
little easier to be the real good person
 

4081
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,589
little easier to be the real good person
you actually are

4082
01:02:31,589 --> 01:02:31,599
you actually are
 

4083
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:32,630
you actually are
well but

4084
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:32,640
well but
 

4085
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,309
well but
do you think individual human life or

4086
01:02:36,309 --> 01:02:36,319
do you think individual human life or
 

4087
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:38,710
do you think individual human life or
society could be modeled as an

4088
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:38,720
society could be modeled as an
 

4089
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:41,109
society could be modeled as an
optimization problem

4090
01:02:41,109 --> 01:02:41,119
optimization problem
 

4091
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:43,510
optimization problem
um not the way i think typically i mean

4092
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:43,520
um not the way i think typically i mean
 

4093
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,029
um not the way i think typically i mean
that's your time one of the most complex

4094
01:02:45,029 --> 01:02:45,039
that's your time one of the most complex
 

4095
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:47,430
that's your time one of the most complex
phenomena in the whole you know in all

4096
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:47,440
phenomena in the whole you know in all
 

4097
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,589
phenomena in the whole you know in all
ways individual human life for society

4098
01:02:49,589 --> 01:02:49,599
ways individual human life for society
 

4099
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,910
ways individual human life for society
as a whole both both i mean individual

4100
01:02:51,910 --> 01:02:51,920
as a whole both both i mean individual
 

4101
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,190
as a whole both both i mean individual
human life is amazingly complex and um

4102
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:55,200
human life is amazingly complex and um
 

4103
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,109
human life is amazingly complex and um
so uh you know optimization is kind of

4104
01:02:57,109 --> 01:02:57,119
so uh you know optimization is kind of
 

4105
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:58,549
so uh you know optimization is kind of
just one branch of mathematics that

4106
01:02:58,549 --> 01:02:58,559
just one branch of mathematics that
 

4107
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,990
just one branch of mathematics that
talks about certain kind of things and

4108
01:02:59,990 --> 01:03:00,000
talks about certain kind of things and
 

4109
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,230
talks about certain kind of things and
uh it just feels way too limited for the

4110
01:03:02,230 --> 01:03:02,240
uh it just feels way too limited for the
 

4111
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,510
uh it just feels way too limited for the
complexity of

4112
01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:03,520
complexity of
 

4113
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,750
complexity of
such things what properties of

4114
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:05,760
such things what properties of
 

4115
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,349
such things what properties of
optimization problems do you think so do

4116
01:03:07,349 --> 01:03:07,359
optimization problems do you think so do
 

4117
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:09,910
optimization problems do you think so do
you think most interesting problems that

4118
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:09,920
you think most interesting problems that
 

4119
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,069
you think most interesting problems that
could be solved through optimization

4120
01:03:12,069 --> 01:03:12,079
could be solved through optimization
 

4121
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:13,510
could be solved through optimization
uh what kind of properties does that

4122
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:13,520
uh what kind of properties does that
 

4123
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:14,829
uh what kind of properties does that
surface have

4124
01:03:14,829 --> 01:03:14,839
surface have
 

4125
01:03:14,839 --> 01:03:17,589
surface have
non-convexity convexity linearity all

4126
01:03:17,589 --> 01:03:17,599
non-convexity convexity linearity all
 

4127
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:19,990
non-convexity convexity linearity all
those kinds of things saddle points well

4128
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:20,000
those kinds of things saddle points well
 

4129
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,430
those kinds of things saddle points well
so optimization's just one piece of

4130
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:21,440
so optimization's just one piece of
 

4131
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,190
so optimization's just one piece of
mathematics you know there's like you

4132
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:23,200
mathematics you know there's like you
 

4133
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,109
mathematics you know there's like you
just even in our era we're aware that

4134
01:03:25,109 --> 01:03:25,119
just even in our era we're aware that
 

4135
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:26,789
just even in our era we're aware that
say sampling

4136
01:03:26,789 --> 01:03:26,799
say sampling
 

4137
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:28,789
say sampling
um is coming up with examples of

01:03:28,789 --> 01:03:28,799
um is coming up with examples of
 

4139
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:30,390

01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:32,880
description what's sampling
 

4143
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,630
description what's sampling
well you they you can if you're a kind

4144
01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:34,640
well you they you can if you're a kind
 

4145
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:35,670
well you they you can if you're a kind
of a certain kind of mathematician you

4146
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:35,680
of a certain kind of mathematician you
 

4147
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,430
of a certain kind of mathematician you
can try to blend them and make them seem

4148
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:37,440
can try to blend them and make them seem
 

4149
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,630
can try to blend them and make them seem
to be sort of the same thing but

4150
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:38,640
to be sort of the same thing but
 

4151
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,390
to be sort of the same thing but
optimization is roughly speaking trying

4152
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:40,400
optimization is roughly speaking trying
 

4153
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,190
optimization is roughly speaking trying
to

4154
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:41,200
to
 

4155
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,910
to
uh find a point that um a single point

4156
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:43,920
uh find a point that um a single point
 

4157
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,029
uh find a point that um a single point
that is the

4158
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:45,039
that is the
 

4159
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:46,789
that is the
optimum of a criterion function of some

4160
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:46,799
optimum of a criterion function of some
 

4161
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:47,670
optimum of a criterion function of some
kind

4162
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:47,680
kind
 

4163
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:50,309
kind
um and sampling is trying to from that

4164
01:03:50,309 --> 01:03:50,319
um and sampling is trying to from that
 

4165
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:51,589
um and sampling is trying to from that
same surface

4166
01:03:51,589 --> 01:03:51,599
same surface
 

4167
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:53,990
same surface
treat that as a distribution or density

4168
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:54,000
treat that as a distribution or density
 

4169
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,670
treat that as a distribution or density
and find prop points that have high

4170
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:55,680
and find prop points that have high
 

4171
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:56,710
and find prop points that have high
density

4172
01:03:56,710 --> 01:03:56,720
density
 

4173
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:00,069
density
so um i i want the entire distribution

4174
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:00,079
so um i i want the entire distribution
 

4175
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:01,910
so um i i want the entire distribution
and the sampling paradigm and i want the

4176
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:01,920
and the sampling paradigm and i want the
 

4177
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,589
and the sampling paradigm and i want the
um you know the the single point that's

4178
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:03,599
um you know the the single point that's
 

4179
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:05,510
um you know the the single point that's
the best point in the par in the sample

4180
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:05,520
the best point in the par in the sample
 

4181
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,750
the best point in the par in the sample
in the uh optimization paradigm now if

4182
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:07,760
in the uh optimization paradigm now if
 

4183
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,430
in the uh optimization paradigm now if
you were optimizing in the space of

4184
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:09,440
you were optimizing in the space of
 

4185
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,670
you were optimizing in the space of
probability measures the output of that

4186
01:04:11,670 --> 01:04:11,680
probability measures the output of that
 

4187
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:12,630
probability measures the output of that
could be a whole probability

4188
01:04:12,630 --> 01:04:12,640
could be a whole probability
 

4189
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,150
could be a whole probability
distribution so you can start to make

4190
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:14,160
distribution so you can start to make
 

4191
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,150
distribution so you can start to make
these things the same but in mathematics

4192
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:16,160
these things the same but in mathematics
 

4193
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,430
these things the same but in mathematics
if you go too high up that kind of

4194
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:17,440
if you go too high up that kind of
 

4195
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,430
if you go too high up that kind of
abstraction arc you start to lose

4196
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:19,440
abstraction arc you start to lose
 

4197
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,829
abstraction arc you start to lose
the uh you know the ability to do the

4198
01:04:21,829 --> 01:04:21,839
the uh you know the ability to do the
 

4199
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:23,109
the uh you know the ability to do the
interesting theorems so you kind of

4200
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:23,119
interesting theorems so you kind of
 

4201
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:24,870
interesting theorems so you kind of
don't try to you don't try to overly

4202
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:24,880
don't try to you don't try to overly
 

4203
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,789
don't try to you don't try to overly
over abstract

4204
01:04:26,789 --> 01:04:26,799
over abstract
 

4205
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:29,510
over abstract
so as a small tangent what kind of world

4206
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:29,520
so as a small tangent what kind of world
 

4207
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,750
so as a small tangent what kind of world
view do you find more appealing one that

4208
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:31,760
view do you find more appealing one that
 

4209
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:32,549
view do you find more appealing one that
is

4210
01:04:32,549 --> 01:04:32,559
is
 

4211
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:36,230
is
deterministic or stochastic

4212
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:36,240
deterministic or stochastic
 

4213
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,270
deterministic or stochastic
well that's easy i mean i'm a

4214
01:04:37,270 --> 01:04:37,280
well that's easy i mean i'm a
 

4215
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,270
well that's easy i mean i'm a
statistician you know the world is

4216
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:39,280
statistician you know the world is
 

4217
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,630
statistician you know the world is
highly stochastic wait i don't know

4218
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:40,640
highly stochastic wait i don't know
 

4219
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:41,589
highly stochastic wait i don't know
what's going to happen in the next five

4220
01:04:41,589 --> 01:04:41,599
what's going to happen in the next five
 

4221
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:42,950
what's going to happen in the next five
minutes right because you're going to

4222
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:42,960
minutes right because you're going to
 

4223
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,750
minutes right because you're going to
ask what we're going to do

4224
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:45,760
ask what we're going to do
 

4225
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,589
ask what we're going to do
massive uncertainty yeah you know

4226
01:04:47,589 --> 01:04:47,599
massive uncertainty yeah you know
 

4227
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:49,510
massive uncertainty yeah you know
massive uncertainty and so the best i

4228
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:49,520
massive uncertainty and so the best i
 

4229
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,510
massive uncertainty and so the best i
can do is have come rough sense or

4230
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:51,520
can do is have come rough sense or
 

4231
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,910
can do is have come rough sense or
probability distribution on things and

4232
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:53,920
probability distribution on things and
 

4233
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,510
probability distribution on things and
somehow use that in my reasoning about

4234
01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:55,520
somehow use that in my reasoning about
 

4235
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:58,069
somehow use that in my reasoning about
what to do now

4236
01:04:58,069 --> 01:04:58,079
what to do now
 

4237
01:04:58,079 --> 01:04:59,910
what to do now
so

4238
01:04:59,910 --> 01:04:59,920
so
 

4239
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,710
so
how does the distributed at scale when

4240
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:02,720
how does the distributed at scale when
 

4241
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:06,390
how does the distributed at scale when
you have multi-agent systems

4242
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:06,400

 

4243
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,789

look like so optimization

4244
01:05:08,789 --> 01:05:08,799
look like so optimization
 

4245
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:11,510
look like so optimization
can optimize sort of it makes a lot more

4246
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:11,520
can optimize sort of it makes a lot more
 

4247
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:12,390
can optimize sort of it makes a lot more
sense

4248
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:12,400
sense
 

4249
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,470
sense
sort of uh at least from from a robotics

4250
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:14,480
sort of uh at least from from a robotics
 

4251
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,309
sort of uh at least from from a robotics

4254
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:18,160

objective function

4256
01:05:20,789 --> 01:05:20,799
objective function
 

4257
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:22,549
objective function
when you start to enter the real world

4258
01:05:22,549 --> 01:05:22,559
when you start to enter the real world
 

4259
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:24,390
when you start to enter the real world
this game theoretic concept starts

4260
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:24,400
this game theoretic concept starts
 

4261
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,910
this game theoretic concept starts
popping up

4262
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:25,920
popping up
 

4263
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:26,789
popping up
and

4264
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:26,799
and
 

4265
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:28,549
and
that

4266
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:28,559
that
 

4267
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:30,390
that
how do you see optimization in this

4268
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:30,400
how do you see optimization in this
 

4269
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:31,829
how do you see optimization in this
because you've talked about markets in a

01:05:31,829 --> 01:05:31,839
because you've talked about markets in a

scale what does that look like do you

4272
01:05:33,910 --> 01:05:33,920
scale what does that look like do you
 

4273
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,589
scale what does that look like do you
see this optimization do you see it as

4274
01:05:35,589 --> 01:05:35,599
see this optimization do you see it as
 

4275
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:37,589
see this optimization do you see it as
sampling do you see like how how should

4276
01:05:37,589 --> 01:05:37,599
sampling do you see like how how should
 

4277
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:39,510
sampling do you see like how how should
you modify these all blend together um

4278
01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:39,520
you modify these all blend together um
 

4279
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,270
you modify these all blend together um
and a system designer thinking about how

4280
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:41,280
and a system designer thinking about how
 

4281
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,589
and a system designer thinking about how
to build an incentivized system will

4282
01:05:43,589 --> 01:05:43,599
to build an incentivized system will
 

4283
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:45,430
to build an incentivized system will
have a blend of all these things so you

4284
01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:45,440
have a blend of all these things so you
 

4285
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,750
have a blend of all these things so you
know a particle in a potential well is

4286
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:47,760
know a particle in a potential well is
 

4287
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:50,150
know a particle in a potential well is
optimizing a function called lagrangian

4288
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:50,160
optimizing a function called lagrangian
 

4289
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:51,750
optimizing a function called lagrangian
right the particle doesn't know that

4290
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:51,760
right the particle doesn't know that
 

4291
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,750
right the particle doesn't know that
there's no algorithm running

4292
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:53,760
there's no algorithm running
 

4293
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,670
there's no algorithm running
that does that it just happens it's so

4294
01:05:55,670 --> 01:05:55,680
that does that it just happens it's so
 

4295
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,029
that does that it just happens it's so
it's a description mathematically of

4296
01:05:57,029 --> 01:05:57,039
it's a description mathematically of
 

4297
01:05:57,039 --> 01:05:58,710
it's a description mathematically of
something that helps us understand as

4298
01:05:58,710 --> 01:05:58,720
something that helps us understand as
 

4299
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,390
something that helps us understand as
analysts what's happening

4300
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:00,400
analysts what's happening
 

4301
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:01,750
analysts what's happening
right and so the same will happen when

4302
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:01,760
right and so the same will happen when
 

4303
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,109
right and so the same will happen when
we talk about you know mixtures of

4304
01:06:03,109 --> 01:06:03,119
we talk about you know mixtures of
 

4305
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:04,870
we talk about you know mixtures of
humans and computers and markets and so

4306
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:04,880
humans and computers and markets and so
 

4307
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,309
humans and computers and markets and so
on so forth there'll be certain

4308
01:06:06,309 --> 01:06:06,319
on so forth there'll be certain
 

4309
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:07,589
on so forth there'll be certain
principles that allow us to understand

4310
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:07,599
principles that allow us to understand
 

4311
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:08,789
principles that allow us to understand

now at some point i may have set up a

4318
01:06:15,829 --> 01:06:15,839
now at some point i may have set up a
 

4319
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:18,870
now at some point i may have set up a
multi-agent or market kind of system

4320
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:18,880
multi-agent or market kind of system
 

4321
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,630
multi-agent or market kind of system
and i'm now thinking about an individual

4322
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:20,640
and i'm now thinking about an individual
 

4323
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,150
and i'm now thinking about an individual
agent in that system

4324
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:22,160
agent in that system
 

4325
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:23,750
agent in that system
and they're asked to do some tasks and

4326
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:23,760
and they're asked to do some tasks and
 

4327
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:24,789
and they're asked to do some tasks and
they're incentivized in some way they

4328
01:06:24,789 --> 01:06:24,799
they're incentivized in some way they
 

4329
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:26,470
they're incentivized in some way they
get certain signals and they they have

4330
01:06:26,470 --> 01:06:26,480
get certain signals and they they have
 

4331
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,789
get certain signals and they they have
some utility maybe what they will do at

4332
01:06:28,789 --> 01:06:28,799
some utility maybe what they will do at
 

4333
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:30,470
some utility maybe what they will do at
that point is they just won't know the

4334
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:30,480
that point is they just won't know the
 

4335
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:31,910
that point is they just won't know the
answer they may have to optimize to find

4336
01:06:31,910 --> 01:06:31,920
answer they may have to optimize to find
 

4337
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:34,069
answer they may have to optimize to find
an answer okay so an autism could be

01:06:34,069 --> 01:06:34,079
an answer okay so an autism could be
 

4339
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:36,710
an answer okay so an autism could be
embedded inside of an overall market

4340
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:36,720
embedded inside of an overall market

it is often studied very narrowly for
 

4347
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,750
it is often studied very narrowly for
certain kinds of problems

certain kinds of problems
 

4349
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,430
certain kinds of problems
but it's roughly speaking this is just

4353
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,190
the i don't know what you're going to do
so i kind of anticipate that a little

4354
01:06:49,190 --> 01:06:49,200
so i kind of anticipate that a little
 

4355
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,710
so i kind of anticipate that a little
bit and you anticipate what i'm

you can describe what saddle points are

4372
01:07:04,549 --> 01:07:04,559
you can describe what saddle points are
 

4373
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:05,510
you can describe what saddle points are
but

4374
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:05,520
but
 

4375
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,190
but
i've heard you kind of mentioned that

i've heard you kind of mentioned that

just trying to say

01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,309
just trying to say
if you happen to be at this equilibrium

4398
01:07:28,309 --> 01:07:28,319
if you happen to be at this equilibrium
 

4399
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:29,670
if you happen to be at this equilibrium
you would see certain kind of behavior

4400
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:29,680
you would see certain kind of behavior
 

4401
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,029
you would see certain kind of behavior
and we see that in real life that's what

4402
01:07:31,029 --> 01:07:31,039
and we see that in real life that's what
 

4403
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:32,710
and we see that in real life that's what
an economist wants to do especially

um

4408
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:35,520
um
 

4409
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:36,710
um
uh

4410
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:36,720
uh
 

4411
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,870
uh
in in continuous uh

4412
01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:38,880
in in continuous uh
 

4413
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,549
in in continuous uh
differential game theory you're in

4414
01:07:40,549 --> 01:07:40,559
differential game theory you're in
 

4415
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:42,630
differential game theory you're in
continuous spaces a um some of the

4416
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:42,640
continuous spaces a um some of the
 

4417
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,309
continuous spaces a um some of the
simplest equilibria are saddle points a

4418
01:07:44,309 --> 01:07:44,319
simplest equilibria are saddle points a
 

4419
01:07:44,319 --> 01:07:46,309
simplest equilibria are saddle points a
nash equilibrium is a saddle point it's

4420
01:07:46,309 --> 01:07:46,319
nash equilibrium is a saddle point it's
 

4421
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:48,230
nash equilibrium is a saddle point it's
a special kind of salon point

4422
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:48,240
a special kind of salon point
 

4423
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:49,430
a special kind of salon point
so

4424
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:49,440
so
 

4425
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,870
so
classically in game theory you were

4426
01:07:50,870 --> 01:07:50,880
classically in game theory you were
 

4427
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,950
classically in game theory you were
trying to find nash equilibria and

4428
01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:52,960
trying to find nash equilibria and
 

4429
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:54,150
trying to find nash equilibria and
algorithmic games here you're trying to

4430
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:54,160
algorithmic games here you're trying to
 

4431
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:56,230
algorithmic games here you're trying to
find algorithms that would find them and

4432
01:07:56,230 --> 01:07:56,240
find algorithms that would find them and
 

4433
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,750
find algorithms that would find them and
so you're trying to find saddle points i

4434
01:07:57,750 --> 01:07:57,760
so you're trying to find saddle points i
 

4435
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:58,950
so you're trying to find saddle points i
mean so that's literally what you're

4436
01:07:58,950 --> 01:07:58,960
mean so that's literally what you're
 

4437
01:07:58,960 --> 01:07:59,910
mean so that's literally what you're
trying to do

4438
01:07:59,910 --> 01:07:59,920
trying to do
 

4439
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,829
trying to do
um but you know any economist knows that

4440
01:08:01,829 --> 01:08:01,839
um but you know any economist knows that
 

4441
01:08:01,839 --> 01:08:03,990
um but you know any economist knows that
nash equilibria have their limitations

4442
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:04,000
nash equilibria have their limitations
 

4443
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,390
nash equilibria have their limitations
they are definitely not that explanatory

4444
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:06,400
they are definitely not that explanatory
 

4445
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,549
they are definitely not that explanatory
in many situations they're not what you

4446
01:08:08,549 --> 01:08:08,559
in many situations they're not what you
 

4447
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:11,029
in many situations they're not what you
really want um there's other kind of

4448
01:08:11,029 --> 01:08:11,039
really want um there's other kind of
 

4449
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:13,109
really want um there's other kind of
equilibria and there's names associated

4450
01:08:13,109 --> 01:08:13,119
equilibria and there's names associated
 

4451
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:14,390
equilibria and there's names associated
with these because they came from

4452
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:14,400
with these because they came from
 

4453
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,750
with these because they came from
history with certain people working on

4454
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:15,760
history with certain people working on
 

4455
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,829
history with certain people working on
them but there will be new ones emerging

4456
01:08:17,829 --> 01:08:17,839
them but there will be new ones emerging
 

4457
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:20,149
them but there will be new ones emerging
so you know one example is a stackelberg

4458
01:08:20,149 --> 01:08:20,159
so you know one example is a stackelberg
 

4459
01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:23,030
so you know one example is a stackelberg
equilibrium so you know nash you and i

4460
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:23,040
equilibrium so you know nash you and i
 

4461
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,470
equilibrium so you know nash you and i
are both playing this game against each

4462
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:24,480
are both playing this game against each
 

4463
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:25,910
are both playing this game against each
other or for each other maybe it's

4464
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:25,920
other or for each other maybe it's
 

4465
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,749
other or for each other maybe it's
cooperative and we're both going to

4466
01:08:27,749 --> 01:08:27,759
cooperative and we're both going to
 

4467
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:28,950
cooperative and we're both going to
think it through and then we're going to

4468
01:08:28,950 --> 01:08:28,960
think it through and then we're going to
 

4469
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:29,990
think it through and then we're going to
decide and we're going to off you know

4470
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:30,000
decide and we're going to off you know
 

4471
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,309
decide and we're going to off you know
do our thing simultaneously

4472
01:08:32,309 --> 01:08:32,319
do our thing simultaneously
 

4473
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:33,749
do our thing simultaneously
you know in a stackelberg no i'm going

4474
01:08:33,749 --> 01:08:33,759
you know in a stackelberg no i'm going
 

4475
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:35,189
you know in a stackelberg no i'm going
to be the first mover i'm going to make

4476
01:08:35,189 --> 01:08:35,199
to be the first mover i'm going to make
 

4477
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:36,789
to be the first mover i'm going to make
a move you're going to look at my move

4478
01:08:36,789 --> 01:08:36,799
a move you're going to look at my move
 

4479
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:38,309
a move you're going to look at my move
and then you're going to make yours now

4480
01:08:38,309 --> 01:08:38,319
and then you're going to make yours now
 

4481
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:39,829
and then you're going to make yours now
since i know you're going to look at my

4482
01:08:39,829 --> 01:08:39,839
since i know you're going to look at my
 

4483
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:41,749
since i know you're going to look at my
move i anticipate what you're going to

4484
01:08:41,749 --> 01:08:41,759
move i anticipate what you're going to
 

4485
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:43,590
move i anticipate what you're going to
do and so i don't do something stupid

4486
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:43,600
do and so i don't do something stupid
 

4487
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,430
do and so i don't do something stupid
but and but then i know that you were

4488
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:45,440
but and but then i know that you were
 

4489
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:47,349
but and but then i know that you were
also anticipating me so we're kind of

4490
01:08:47,349 --> 01:08:47,359
also anticipating me so we're kind of
 

4491
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:48,709
also anticipating me so we're kind of
going back and so far am i but there is

4492
01:08:48,709 --> 01:08:48,719
going back and so far am i but there is
 

4493
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:50,470
going back and so far am i but there is
then a first mover

4494
01:08:50,470 --> 01:08:50,480
then a first mover
 

4495
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:51,430
then a first mover
thing

4496
01:08:51,430 --> 01:08:51,440
thing
 

4497
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:53,030
thing
and so there's a those are different

4498
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:53,040
and so there's a those are different
 

4499
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,669
and so there's a those are different
equilibria all right and uh

4500
01:08:55,669 --> 01:08:55,679
equilibria all right and uh
 

4501
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,430
equilibria all right and uh
so just mathematically yeah these things

4502
01:08:57,430 --> 01:08:57,440
so just mathematically yeah these things
 

4503
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:59,189
so just mathematically yeah these things
have certain topologies certain shapes

4504
01:08:59,189 --> 01:08:59,199
have certain topologies certain shapes
 

4505
01:08:59,199 --> 01:09:00,070
have certain topologies certain shapes
they're like southwest and

4506
01:09:00,070 --> 01:09:00,080
they're like southwest and
 

4507
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:01,669
they're like southwest and
algorithmically or dynamically how do

4508
01:09:01,669 --> 01:09:01,679
algorithmically or dynamically how do
 

4509
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:03,110
algorithmically or dynamically how do
you move towards them how do you move

4510
01:09:03,110 --> 01:09:03,120
you move towards them how do you move
 

4511
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,870
you move towards them how do you move
away from things

4512
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:04,880
away from things
 

4513
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,709
away from things
um you know so some of these questions

4514
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:06,719
um you know so some of these questions
 

4515
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:08,709
um you know so some of these questions
have answers they've been studied others

4516
01:09:08,709 --> 01:09:08,719
have answers they've been studied others
 

4517
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:10,309
have answers they've been studied others

know young people getting in this field

4526
01:09:16,709 --> 01:09:16,719
know young people getting in this field
 

4527
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:17,910
know young people getting in this field
who kind of think it's all done because

4528
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:17,920
who kind of think it's all done because
 

4529
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,309
who kind of think it's all done because
we have you know tensorflow well no

4530
01:09:20,309 --> 01:09:20,319
we have you know tensorflow well no
 

4531
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:22,149
we have you know tensorflow well no
these are all open problems and they're

4532
01:09:22,149 --> 01:09:22,159
these are all open problems and they're
 

4533
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:23,510
these are all open problems and they're
really important and interesting and

4534
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:23,520
really important and interesting and
 

4535
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,269
really important and interesting and
it's about strategic settings how do i

4536
01:09:25,269 --> 01:09:25,279
it's about strategic settings how do i
 

4537
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:27,269
it's about strategic settings how do i
collect data suppose i don't know what

4538
01:09:27,269 --> 01:09:27,279
collect data suppose i don't know what
 

4539
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:28,390
collect data suppose i don't know what
you're going to do because i don't know

4540
01:09:28,390 --> 01:09:28,400
you're going to do because i don't know
 

4541
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,229
you're going to do because i don't know
you very well right well i got to kind

4542
01:09:30,229 --> 01:09:30,239
you very well right well i got to kind
 

4543
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,669
you very well right well i got to kind
of date about you so maybe i want to

4544
01:09:31,669 --> 01:09:31,679
of date about you so maybe i want to
 

4545
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:33,430
of date about you so maybe i want to
push you in a part of the space where i

4546
01:09:33,430 --> 01:09:33,440
push you in a part of the space where i
 

4547
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:34,630
push you in a part of the space where i
don't know much about you so i can get

4548
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:34,640
don't know much about you so i can get
 

4549
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,550
don't know much about you so i can get
data because and then later i'll realize

4550
01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:36,560
data because and then later i'll realize
 

4551
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,390
data because and then later i'll realize
that you'll never you'll never go there

4552
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:38,400
that you'll never you'll never go there
 

4553
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:39,669
that you'll never you'll never go there
because of the way the game is set up

4554
01:09:39,669 --> 01:09:39,679
because of the way the game is set up
 

4555
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:41,430
because of the way the game is set up
but you know that's part of the overall

4556
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:41,440
but you know that's part of the overall
 

4557
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:43,590
but you know that's part of the overall
you know data analysis context is that

4558
01:09:43,590 --> 01:09:43,600
you know data analysis context is that
 

4559
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:44,950
you know data analysis context is that
yeah even the game of poker is

4560
01:09:44,950 --> 01:09:44,960
yeah even the game of poker is
 

4561
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,229
yeah even the game of poker is
fascinating space

4562
01:09:46,229 --> 01:09:46,239
fascinating space
 

4563
01:09:46,239 --> 01:09:47,510
fascinating space
whenever there's any uncertainty your

4564
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:47,520
whenever there's any uncertainty your
 

4565
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,590
whenever there's any uncertainty your
lack of information is it's a

4566
01:09:49,590 --> 01:09:49,600
lack of information is it's a
 

4567
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,229
lack of information is it's a
super exciting space yeah uh

4568
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:52,239
super exciting space yeah uh
 

4569
01:09:52,239 --> 01:09:53,590
super exciting space yeah uh
just uh

4570
01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:53,600
just uh

just uh
lingard optimization for a second so if

4572
01:09:55,510 --> 01:09:55,520
lingard optimization for a second so if
 

4573
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:56,950
lingard optimization for a second so if
we look at deep learning it's

4574
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:56,960
we look at deep learning it's
 

4575
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,630
we look at deep learning it's
essentially minimization of a

4576
01:09:58,630 --> 01:09:58,640
essentially minimization of a
 

4577
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,550
essentially minimization of a

loss function so is there something

4580
01:10:02,709 --> 01:10:02,719
loss function so is there something
 

4581
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:05,350
loss function so is there something
insightful or hopeful that you see

in the real world is trying to optimize

4588
01:10:13,430 --> 01:10:13,440
in the real world is trying to optimize
 

4589
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,510
in the real world is trying to optimize
over is there something interesting this

4590
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:15,520
over is there something interesting this
 

4591
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:16,470
over is there something interesting this
is just

4592
01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:16,480
is just
 

4593
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:17,830
is just
the usual kind of problems of

4594
01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:17,840
the usual kind of problems of
 

4595
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,910
the usual kind of problems of
optimization

4596
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:19,920
optimization
 

4597
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,669
optimization
i think from an optimization point of

4598
01:10:21,669 --> 01:10:21,679
i think from an optimization point of
 

4599
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:23,030
i think from an optimization point of
view that surface first of all it's

4600
01:10:23,030 --> 01:10:23,040
view that surface first of all it's
 

4601
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:24,390
view that surface first of all it's
pretty smooth

4602
01:10:24,390 --> 01:10:24,400
pretty smooth
 

4603
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:25,270
pretty smooth
um

4604
01:10:25,270 --> 01:10:25,280
um
 

4605
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,189
um
and secondly if there's over if it's

4606
01:10:27,189 --> 01:10:27,199
and secondly if there's over if it's
 

4607
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:28,550
and secondly if there's over if it's
over parameterized there's kind of lots

4608
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:28,560
over parameterized there's kind of lots
 

4609
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:31,270
over parameterized there's kind of lots
of paths down to reasonable optima

4610
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:31,280
of paths down to reasonable optima
 

4611
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,950
of paths down to reasonable optima
and so kind of the getting downhill to

4612
01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:32,960
and so kind of the getting downhill to
 

4613
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:35,350
and so kind of the getting downhill to
the to an optimum is viewed as not as

01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:35,360
the to an optimum is viewed as not as
 

4615
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,430
the to an optimum is viewed as not as
hard as you might have expected in high

4616
01:10:37,430 --> 01:10:37,440
hard as you might have expected in high
 

4617
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,750

the fact that some optima tend to be

4620
01:10:41,350 --> 01:10:41,360
the fact that some optima tend to be
 

4621
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,110
the fact that some optima tend to be
really good ones and others not so good

4622
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:43,120
really good ones and others not so good
 

4623
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:44,870
really good ones and others not so good
and you tend to it's not sometimes you

4624
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:44,880
and you tend to it's not sometimes you
 

4625
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,030
and you tend to it's not sometimes you
find the good ones is sort of still

4626
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:47,040
find the good ones is sort of still
 

4627
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,430
find the good ones is sort of still

it's able to work at this scale but um

4680
01:11:36,149 --> 01:11:36,159
it's able to work at this scale but um
 

4681
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:38,229
it's able to work at this scale but um
um i don't think that we're stuck with

4682
01:11:38,229 --> 01:11:38,239
um i don't think that we're stuck with
 

4683
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,750
um i don't think that we're stuck with
that and we're certainly not stuck with

4684
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:39,760
that and we're certainly not stuck with
 

4685
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:40,790
that and we're certainly not stuck with
that because we're understanding the

4686
01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:40,800
that because we're understanding the
 

4687
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:41,910
that because we're understanding the
brain

4688
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:41,920
brain
 

4689
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,990

so in terms of uh on the algorithm size

4690
01:11:43,990 --> 01:11:44,000
so in terms of uh on the algorithm size
 

4691
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,070
so in terms of uh on the algorithm size
of gradient descent do you think we're

4692
01:11:46,070 --> 01:11:46,080
of gradient descent do you think we're
 

4693
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,229
of gradient descent do you think we're
stuck with gradient descent this is uh

4694
01:11:48,229 --> 01:11:48,239
stuck with gradient descent this is uh
 

4695
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:50,310
stuck with gradient descent this is uh
variants of it what variants do you find

4696
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:50,320
variants of it what variants do you find
 

4697
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,750
variants of it what variants do you find
interesting or do you think there'll be

4698
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:51,760
interesting or do you think there'll be
 

4699
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,590
interesting or do you think there'll be
something else invented

4700
01:11:53,590 --> 01:11:53,600
something else invented
 

4701
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,990
something else invented
that uh is able to

4702
01:11:55,990 --> 01:11:56,000
that uh is able to
 

4703
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,229
that uh is able to
walk all over these optimization spaces

4704
01:11:58,229 --> 01:11:58,239
walk all over these optimization spaces
 

4705
01:11:58,239 --> 01:12:00,149
walk all over these optimization spaces
in more interesting ways so there's a

4706
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:00,159
in more interesting ways so there's a
 

4707
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:02,229
in more interesting ways so there's a
co-design of the surface and or the

4708
01:12:02,229 --> 01:12:02,239
co-design of the surface and or the
 

4709
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:04,470
co-design of the surface and or the
architecture and the algorithm

4710
01:12:04,470 --> 01:12:04,480
architecture and the algorithm
 

4711
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,550
architecture and the algorithm
so if you just ask if we stay with the

4712
01:12:06,550 --> 01:12:06,560
so if you just ask if we stay with the
 

4713
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:07,830
so if you just ask if we stay with the
kind of architectures we have now and

4714
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:07,840
kind of architectures we have now and
 

4715
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,990
kind of architectures we have now and
not just neural nets but you know

4716
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:10,000
not just neural nets but you know
 

4717
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,590
not just neural nets but you know
phase retrieval architectures or

4718
01:12:11,590 --> 01:12:11,600
phase retrieval architectures or
 

4719
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,110
phase retrieval architectures or
materials completion architectures and

4720
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:13,120
materials completion architectures and
 

4721
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,870
materials completion architectures and
so on um

4722
01:12:14,870 --> 01:12:14,880
so on um
 

4723
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,149
so on um
you know i think we've kind of come to a

4724
01:12:16,149 --> 01:12:16,159
you know i think we've kind of come to a
 

4725
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:19,030
you know i think we've kind of come to a
place where yeah a stochastic gradient

4726
01:12:19,030 --> 01:12:19,040
place where yeah a stochastic gradient
 

4727
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:21,430
place where yeah a stochastic gradient
algorithms are dominant and

4728
01:12:21,430 --> 01:12:21,440
algorithms are dominant and
 

4729
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:24,229
algorithms are dominant and
um there are versions uh they're you

4730
01:12:24,229 --> 01:12:24,239
um there are versions uh they're you
 

4731
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:25,270
um there are versions uh they're you
know that are a little better than

4732
01:12:25,270 --> 01:12:25,280
know that are a little better than
 

4733
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,110
know that are a little better than
others they you know have more

4734
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:27,120
others they you know have more
 

4735
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,709
others they you know have more
guarantees they're more robust and and

4736
01:12:28,709 --> 01:12:28,719
guarantees they're more robust and and
 

4737
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:30,310
guarantees they're more robust and and
so on and there's ongoing research to

4738
01:12:30,310 --> 01:12:30,320
so on and there's ongoing research to
 

4739
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:31,430
so on and there's ongoing research to
kind of figure out which is the best

4740
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:31,440
kind of figure out which is the best
 

4741
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,270
kind of figure out which is the best
downforce situation

4742
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:33,280
downforce situation
 

4743
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:35,030
downforce situation
um but i think that that'll start to

4744
01:12:35,030 --> 01:12:35,040
um but i think that that'll start to
 

4745
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:36,550
um but i think that that'll start to
co-evolve that that'll put pressure on

4746
01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:36,560
co-evolve that that'll put pressure on
 

4747
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,070
co-evolve that that'll put pressure on
the actual architecture and so we

4748
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:38,080
the actual architecture and so we
 

4749
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,430
the actual architecture and so we
shouldn't do it in this particular way

4750
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:39,440
shouldn't do it in this particular way
 

4751
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:40,550
shouldn't do it in this particular way
we should do it in a different way

4752
01:12:40,550 --> 01:12:40,560
we should do it in a different way
 

4753
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,590
we should do it in a different way
because this other algorithm is now

4754
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:41,600
because this other algorithm is now
 

4755
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:42,870
because this other algorithm is now
available if you do it in a different

4756
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:42,880
available if you do it in a different
 

4757
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:43,830
available if you do it in a different
way

4758
01:12:43,830 --> 01:12:43,840
way
 

4759
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,110
way
um

4760
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:45,120
um
 

4761
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:45,910
um
so

4762
01:12:45,910 --> 01:12:45,920
so
 

4763
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:46,870
so
uh

4764
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:46,880
uh
 

4765
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:48,709
uh
that that i can't really anticipate that

4766
01:12:48,709 --> 01:12:48,719
that that i can't really anticipate that
 

4767
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:50,790
that that i can't really anticipate that
co-evolution process but

4768
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:50,800
co-evolution process but
 

4769
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,550
co-evolution process but
you know gradients are amazing uh

4770
01:12:52,550 --> 01:12:52,560
you know gradients are amazing uh
 

4771
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:55,590
you know gradients are amazing uh
mathematical objects um they uh have a

4772
01:12:55,590 --> 01:12:55,600
mathematical objects um they uh have a
 

4773
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:56,390
mathematical objects um they uh have a
lot of

4774
01:12:56,390 --> 01:12:56,400
lot of
 

4775
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,990
lot of
people who uh

4776
01:12:57,990 --> 01:12:58,000
people who uh
 

4777
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,189
people who uh
start to study them more deeply

4778
01:12:59,189 --> 01:12:59,199
start to study them more deeply
 

4779
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:00,470
start to study them more deeply
mathematically

4780
01:13:00,470 --> 01:13:00,480
mathematically
 

4781
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,310
mathematically
are kind of shocked about what what they

4782
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:02,320
are kind of shocked about what what they
 

4783
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:05,030
are kind of shocked about what what they
are and what they can do um i mean to

4784
01:13:05,030 --> 01:13:05,040
are and what they can do um i mean to
 

4785
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,630
are and what they can do um i mean to
think about this way if uh suppose that

4786
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:06,640
think about this way if uh suppose that
 

4787
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,390
think about this way if uh suppose that
i tell you if you move along the x-axis

4788
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:08,400
i tell you if you move along the x-axis
 

4789
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,590
i tell you if you move along the x-axis
you get uh

4790
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:09,600
you get uh
 

4791
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,430
you get uh
uh uh you know you go uphill in some

4792
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:11,440
uh uh you know you go uphill in some
 

4793
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:13,189
uh uh you know you go uphill in some
objective by you know three units

4794
01:13:13,189 --> 01:13:13,199
objective by you know three units
 

4795
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:15,590
objective by you know three units
whereas if you move on the y-axis you go

4796
01:13:15,590 --> 01:13:15,600
whereas if you move on the y-axis you go
 

4797
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,070
whereas if you move on the y-axis you go
uphill by seven units right now i'm

4798
01:13:18,070 --> 01:13:18,080
uphill by seven units right now i'm
 

4799
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:19,669
uphill by seven units right now i'm
gonna only allow you to move a certain

4800
01:13:19,669 --> 01:13:19,679
gonna only allow you to move a certain
 

4801
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:21,350
gonna only allow you to move a certain
you know unit distance

4802
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:21,360
you know unit distance
 

4803
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:23,830
you know unit distance
all right what are you gonna do well the

4804
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:23,840
all right what are you gonna do well the
 

4805
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,750
all right what are you gonna do well the
most not people will say i'm gonna go

4806
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:25,760
most not people will say i'm gonna go
 

4807
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:27,189
most not people will say i'm gonna go
along the y-axis i'm getting the biggest

4808
01:13:27,189 --> 01:13:27,199
along the y-axis i'm getting the biggest
 

4809
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:29,350
along the y-axis i'm getting the biggest
bang for my buck you know and my buck is

4810
01:13:29,350 --> 01:13:29,360
bang for my buck you know and my buck is
 

4811
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,270
bang for my buck you know and my buck is
only one unit so i'm gonna put all of it

4812
01:13:31,270 --> 01:13:31,280
only one unit so i'm gonna put all of it
 

4813
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,350
only one unit so i'm gonna put all of it
in the y-axis right

4814
01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:33,360
in the y-axis right
 

4815
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:36,550
in the y-axis right
and uh why should i even take any of my

4816
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:36,560
and uh why should i even take any of my
 

4817
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,630
and uh why should i even take any of my
strength my step size and put any of it

4818
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:38,640
strength my step size and put any of it
 

4819
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:39,990
strength my step size and put any of it
in the x-axis because i'm getting less

4820
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:40,000
in the x-axis because i'm getting less
 

4821
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,830
in the x-axis because i'm getting less
bang for my buck that seems like a

4822
01:13:41,830 --> 01:13:41,840
bang for my buck that seems like a
 

4823
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,030
bang for my buck that seems like a
completely

4824
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:43,040
completely
 

4825
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,350
completely
you know clear cl argument and it's

4826
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:45,360
you know clear cl argument and it's
 

4827
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:47,669
you know clear cl argument and it's
wrong because the gradient direction is

4828
01:13:47,669 --> 01:13:47,679
wrong because the gradient direction is
 

4829
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:49,590
wrong because the gradient direction is
not to go along the y-axis it's to take

4830
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:49,600
not to go along the y-axis it's to take
 

4831
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,270
not to go along the y-axis it's to take
a little bit of the x-axis

4832
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:51,280
a little bit of the x-axis
 

4833
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,430
a little bit of the x-axis
uh and that to understand that you have

4834
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:53,440
uh and that to understand that you have
 

4835
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:56,310
uh and that to understand that you have
to you have to know some math and um

4836
01:13:56,310 --> 01:13:56,320
to you have to know some math and um
 

4837
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:58,870
to you have to know some math and um
so even a you know trivial so so-called

4838
01:13:58,870 --> 01:13:58,880
so even a you know trivial so so-called
 

4839
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,310
so even a you know trivial so so-called
operator like grading is not trivial and

4840
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:00,320
operator like grading is not trivial and
 

4841
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:02,229
operator like grading is not trivial and
so you know exploiting its properties is

4842
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:02,239
so you know exploiting its properties is
 

4843
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:04,229
so you know exploiting its properties is
still very very important um now we know

4844
01:14:04,229 --> 01:14:04,239
still very very important um now we know
 

4845
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:05,590
still very very important um now we know
that just providing descent has got all

4846
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:05,600
that just providing descent has got all
 

4847
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,030
that just providing descent has got all
kinds of problems it gets stuck in many

4848
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:07,040
kinds of problems it gets stuck in many
 

4849
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,950
kinds of problems it gets stuck in many
ways and it hadn't have you know good

4850
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:08,960
ways and it hadn't have you know good
 

4851
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:11,910
ways and it hadn't have you know good
dimension dependence and so on so um my

4852
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:11,920
dimension dependence and so on so um my
 

4853
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:13,669
dimension dependence and so on so um my
own line of work recently has been about

4854
01:14:13,669 --> 01:14:13,679
own line of work recently has been about
 

4855
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:15,750
own line of work recently has been about
what kinds of stochasticity how can we

4856
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:15,760
what kinds of stochasticity how can we
 

4857
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:16,950
what kinds of stochasticity how can we
get dimension dependence how can we do

4858
01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:16,960
get dimension dependence how can we do
 

4859
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,550
get dimension dependence how can we do
the theory of that

4860
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:18,560
the theory of that
 

4861
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,149
the theory of that
um and we've come up pretty favorable

4862
01:14:20,149 --> 01:14:20,159
um and we've come up pretty favorable
 

4863
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:21,189
um and we've come up pretty favorable
results with certain kinds of

4864
01:14:21,189 --> 01:14:21,199
results with certain kinds of
 

4865
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:22,550
results with certain kinds of
stochasticity

4866
01:14:22,550 --> 01:14:22,560
stochasticity
 

4867
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,790
stochasticity
we have sufficient conditions generally

4868
01:14:24,790 --> 01:14:24,800
we have sufficient conditions generally
 

4869
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,709
we have sufficient conditions generally
we know if you if you do this we will

4870
01:14:26,709 --> 01:14:26,719
we know if you if you do this we will
 

4871
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:28,550
we know if you if you do this we will
give you a good guarantee

4872
01:14:28,550 --> 01:14:28,560
give you a good guarantee
 

4873
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:29,990
give you a good guarantee
we don't have necessary conditions that

4874
01:14:29,990 --> 01:14:30,000
we don't have necessary conditions that
 

4875
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,070
we don't have necessary conditions that
it must be done a certain way in general

4876
01:14:32,070 --> 01:14:32,080
it must be done a certain way in general
 

4877
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:34,470
it must be done a certain way in general
so stochasticity how much randomness to

4878
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:34,480
so stochasticity how much randomness to
 

4879
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,310
so stochasticity how much randomness to
inject into the

4880
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:36,320
inject into the
 

4881
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,149
inject into the
into the walking along the gradient and

4882
01:14:38,149 --> 01:14:38,159
into the walking along the gradient and
 

4883
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:39,750
into the walking along the gradient and
what kind of randomness

4884
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:39,760
what kind of randomness
 

4885
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,990
what kind of randomness
why is randomness good in this process

4886
01:14:41,990 --> 01:14:42,000
why is randomness good in this process
 

4887
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,669
why is randomness good in this process
why is stochasticity good yeah so um i

4888
01:14:45,669 --> 01:14:45,679
why is stochasticity good yeah so um i
 

4889
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:47,110
why is stochasticity good yeah so um i
give you simple answers but in some

4890
01:14:47,110 --> 01:14:47,120
give you simple answers but in some
 

4891
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,550
give you simple answers but in some
sense again it's kind of amazing

4892
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:48,560
sense again it's kind of amazing
 

4893
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,630
sense again it's kind of amazing
stochasticity just uh

4894
01:14:50,630 --> 01:14:50,640
stochasticity just uh
 

4895
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,630
stochasticity just uh
um you know

4896
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:52,640
um you know
 

4897
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,470
um you know
particular features of a surface that

4898
01:14:54,470 --> 01:14:54,480
particular features of a surface that
 

4899
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:55,910
particular features of a surface that
could have hurt you if you were doing

4900
01:14:55,910 --> 01:14:55,920
could have hurt you if you were doing
 

4901
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,149
could have hurt you if you were doing
one thing um deterministically it won't

4902
01:14:58,149 --> 01:14:58,159
one thing um deterministically it won't
 

4903
01:14:58,159 --> 01:14:59,510
one thing um deterministically it won't
hurt you because

4904
01:14:59,510 --> 01:14:59,520
hurt you because
 

4905
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,830
hurt you because
uh you know by chance there's very

4906
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:01,840
uh you know by chance there's very
 

4907
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,270
uh you know by chance there's very
little chance that you would get hurt

4908
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:03,280
little chance that you would get hurt
 

4909
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:04,390
little chance that you would get hurt
and um

4910
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:04,400
and um
 

4911
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:07,910
and um
you know so here stochasticity um

4912
01:15:07,910 --> 01:15:07,920
you know so here stochasticity um
 

4913
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:10,950
you know so here stochasticity um
you know is just kind of saves you from

4914
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:10,960
you know is just kind of saves you from
 

4915
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,470
you know is just kind of saves you from
some of the particular features of

4916
01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:12,480
some of the particular features of
 

4917
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,149
some of the particular features of
surfaces that um

4918
01:15:14,149 --> 01:15:14,159
surfaces that um
 

4919
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:16,550
surfaces that um
you know and in fact if you think about

4920
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:16,560
you know and in fact if you think about
 

4921
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,390
you know and in fact if you think about
you know surfaces that are discontinuous

4922
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:18,400
you know surfaces that are discontinuous
 

4923
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:19,590
you know surfaces that are discontinuous
in a first derivative like you know

4924
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:19,600
in a first derivative like you know
 

4925
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:21,189
in a first derivative like you know
absolute value function

4926
01:15:21,189 --> 01:15:21,199
absolute value function
 

4927
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:23,350
absolute value function
um you will go down and hit that point

4928
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:23,360
um you will go down and hit that point
 

4929
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:24,790
um you will go down and hit that point
where there's non-differentiability

4930
01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:24,800
where there's non-differentiability
 

4931
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,229
where there's non-differentiability
right and if you're running a

4932
01:15:26,229 --> 01:15:26,239
right and if you're running a
 

4933
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:27,750
right and if you're running a
deterministic argument at that point you

4934
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:27,760
deterministic argument at that point you
 

4935
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,430
deterministic argument at that point you
can really do something bad

4936
01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:29,440
can really do something bad
 

4937
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,350
can really do something bad
right whereas stochasticity just means

4938
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:31,360
right whereas stochasticity just means
 

4939
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,390
right whereas stochasticity just means
it's pretty unlikely that's going to

4940
01:15:32,390 --> 01:15:32,400
it's pretty unlikely that's going to
 

4941
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:33,590
it's pretty unlikely that's going to
happen you're going to you're going to

4942
01:15:33,590 --> 01:15:33,600
happen you're going to you're going to
 

4943
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,510
happen you're going to you're going to
hit that point

4944
01:15:35,510 --> 01:15:35,520
hit that point
 

4945
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,430
hit that point
so you know it's again not trivially

4946
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:37,440
so you know it's again not trivially
 

4947
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,430
so you know it's again not trivially
analyzed but um

4948
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:39,440
analyzed but um
 

4949
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:40,950
analyzed but um
especially in higher dimensions also

4950
01:15:40,950 --> 01:15:40,960
especially in higher dimensions also
 

4951
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,550
especially in higher dimensions also
stochasticity our intuition isn't very

4952
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:42,560
stochasticity our intuition isn't very
 

4953
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,390
stochasticity our intuition isn't very
good about it but it has properties that

4954
01:15:44,390 --> 01:15:44,400
good about it but it has properties that
 

4955
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,669
good about it but it has properties that
kind of are very appealing in high

4956
01:15:45,669 --> 01:15:45,679
kind of are very appealing in high
 

4957
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:47,270
kind of are very appealing in high
dimensions for a lot of large number of

4958
01:15:47,270 --> 01:15:47,280
dimensions for a lot of large number of
 

4959
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:48,310
dimensions for a lot of large number of
reasons

4960
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:48,320
reasons
 

4961
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,390
reasons
um so it's it's all part of the

4962
01:15:50,390 --> 01:15:50,400
um so it's it's all part of the
 

4963
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,750
um so it's it's all part of the
mathematics to kind of that's what's fun

4964
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:51,760
mathematics to kind of that's what's fun
 

4965
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,270
mathematics to kind of that's what's fun
to work in the field is that you get to

4966
01:15:53,270 --> 01:15:53,280
to work in the field is that you get to
 

4967
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:55,990
to work in the field is that you get to
try to understand this mathematics and

4968
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:56,000
try to understand this mathematics and
 

4969
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:56,790
try to understand this mathematics and
um

4970
01:15:56,790 --> 01:15:56,800
um
 

4971
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,790
um
but long story short you know partly

4972
01:15:58,790 --> 01:15:58,800
but long story short you know partly
 

4973
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:00,390
but long story short you know partly
empirically it was discovered stochastic

4974
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:00,400
empirically it was discovered stochastic

kind of followed i'd say um that

4978
01:16:05,030 --> 01:16:05,040
kind of followed i'd say um that
 

4979
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,709
kind of followed i'd say um that
but i don't see that we're getting

4980
01:16:06,709 --> 01:16:06,719
but i don't see that we're getting
 

4981
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:08,790
but i don't see that we're getting
clearly out of that uh

4982
01:16:08,790 --> 01:16:08,800
clearly out of that uh
 

4983
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:09,669
clearly out of that uh
what's

4984
01:16:09,669 --> 01:16:09,679
what's
 

4985
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:12,229
what's
the most beautiful mysterious a profound

01:16:12,229 --> 01:16:12,239
the most beautiful mysterious a profound
 

4987
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:15,510

01:16:17,110 --> 01:16:17,120
i don't know the most
 

4991
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,709
i don't know the most
but let me just say that uh you know

4992
01:16:18,709 --> 01:16:18,719
but let me just say that uh you know
 

4993
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:20,470
but let me just say that uh you know
nestorov's work on nest drive

4994
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:20,480

acceleration to me is uh pretty pretty

4996
01:16:23,030 --> 01:16:23,040
acceleration to me is uh pretty pretty
 

4997
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,110
acceleration to me is uh pretty pretty
surprising and pretty deep

4998
01:16:25,110 --> 01:16:25,120
surprising and pretty deep
 

4999
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,070

5001
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,590
um
can you elaborate well install

5002
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:27,600
can you elaborate well install
 

5003
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:29,669
can you elaborate well install
acceleration is just that um

5004
01:16:29,669 --> 01:16:29,679
acceleration is just that um
 

5005
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:31,350
acceleration is just that um
i suppose that we are

5006
01:16:31,350 --> 01:16:31,360
i suppose that we are
 

5007
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:32,630
i suppose that we are
going to use gradients to move around

5008
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:32,640
going to use gradients to move around
 

5009
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,070
going to use gradients to move around
into space for the reasons i've alluded

5010
01:16:34,070 --> 01:16:34,080
into space for the reasons i've alluded
 

5011
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:36,070
into space for the reasons i've alluded
to there there are nice directions to

5012
01:16:36,070 --> 01:16:36,080
to there there are nice directions to
 

5013
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:36,950
to there there are nice directions to
move

5014
01:16:36,950 --> 01:16:36,960
move
 

5015
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:38,709
move
and suppose that i tell you that you're

5016
01:16:38,709 --> 01:16:38,719
and suppose that i tell you that you're
 

5017
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,310
and suppose that i tell you that you're
only allowed to use gradients you're not

5018
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:40,320
only allowed to use gradients you're not
 

5019
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,229
only allowed to use gradients you're not
going to be allowed to you'll see this

5020
01:16:42,229 --> 01:16:42,239
going to be allowed to you'll see this
 

5021
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:44,229
going to be allowed to you'll see this
local person it can only sense kind of a

5022
01:16:44,229 --> 01:16:44,239
local person it can only sense kind of a
 

5023
01:16:44,239 --> 01:16:46,709
local person it can only sense kind of a
change in the surface

5024
01:16:46,709 --> 01:16:46,719
change in the surface
 

5025
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:48,470
change in the surface
um but i'm going to give you kind of a

5026
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:48,480
um but i'm going to give you kind of a
 

5027
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:49,830
um but i'm going to give you kind of a
computer that's able to store all your

5028
01:16:49,830 --> 01:16:49,840
computer that's able to store all your
 

5029
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,430
computer that's able to store all your
previous gradients and so you start to

5030
01:16:51,430 --> 01:16:51,440
previous gradients and so you start to
 

5031
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,030
previous gradients and so you start to
learn some something about the the

5032
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:53,040
learn some something about the the
 

5033
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:54,229
learn some something about the the
surface

5034
01:16:54,229 --> 01:16:54,239
surface
 

5035
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:55,990
surface
um and i'm going to restrict you to

5036
01:16:55,990 --> 01:16:56,000
um and i'm going to restrict you to
 

5037
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,750
um and i'm going to restrict you to
maybe move in the direction of like a

5038
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:57,760
maybe move in the direction of like a
 

5039
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:59,430
maybe move in the direction of like a
linear span of all the gradients so you

5040
01:16:59,430 --> 01:16:59,440
linear span of all the gradients so you
 

5041
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:00,470
linear span of all the gradients so you
can't kind of just move in some

5042
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:00,480
can't kind of just move in some
 

5043
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:03,189
can't kind of just move in some
arbitrary direction right so now we have

5044
01:17:03,189 --> 01:17:03,199
arbitrary direction right so now we have
 

5045
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:05,270
arbitrary direction right so now we have
a well-defined mathematical complexity

5046
01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:05,280
a well-defined mathematical complexity
 

5047
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:06,550
a well-defined mathematical complexity
model there's a certain classes of

5048
01:17:06,550 --> 01:17:06,560
model there's a certain classes of
 

5049
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,229
model there's a certain classes of
algorithms that can do that and others

5050
01:17:08,229 --> 01:17:08,239
algorithms that can do that and others
 

5051
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:10,229
algorithms that can do that and others
that can't and we can ask for certain

5052
01:17:10,229 --> 01:17:10,239
that can't and we can ask for certain
 

5053
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:12,149
that can't and we can ask for certain
kinds of surfaces how fast can you get

5054
01:17:12,149 --> 01:17:12,159
kinds of surfaces how fast can you get
 

5055
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:13,590
kinds of surfaces how fast can you get
down to the optimum

5056
01:17:13,590 --> 01:17:13,600
down to the optimum
 

5057
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,669
down to the optimum
so there's an answers to these so for a

5058
01:17:15,669 --> 01:17:15,679
so there's an answers to these so for a
 

5059
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:18,470
so there's an answers to these so for a

01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:18,480
you know a smooth convex function
 

5061
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:20,390
you know a smooth convex function
there's an answer which is one over the

5062
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:20,400
there's an answer which is one over the
 

5063
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,229
there's an answer which is one over the
number of steps squared

5064
01:17:22,229 --> 01:17:22,239
number of steps squared
 

5065
01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:25,350
number of steps squared
you will be within a ball of that size

5066
01:17:25,350 --> 01:17:25,360
you will be within a ball of that size
 

5067
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,510
you will be within a ball of that size
after after k steps

5068
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:27,520
after after k steps
 

5069
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:28,630
after after k steps
um

5070
01:17:28,630 --> 01:17:28,640
um
 

5071
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,630
um
gradient descent in particular has a

5072
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:30,640
gradient descent in particular has a
 

5073
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:33,030
gradient descent in particular has a
slower rate it's one over k

5074
01:17:33,030 --> 01:17:33,040
slower rate it's one over k
 

5075
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:34,070
slower rate it's one over k
okay

5076
01:17:34,070 --> 01:17:34,080
okay
 

5077
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,189
okay
um

5078
01:17:35,189 --> 01:17:35,199
um
 

5079
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:36,950
um
so you could ask is gradient is said

5080
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:36,960
so you could ask is gradient is said
 

5081
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:38,390
so you could ask is gradient is said
actually even though we know it's a good

5082
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:38,400
actually even though we know it's a good
 

5083
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,229
actually even though we know it's a good
algorithm is it the best algorithm in

5084
01:17:40,229 --> 01:17:40,239
algorithm is it the best algorithm in
 

5085
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:42,790
algorithm is it the best algorithm in
the sense of the answer is no well well

5086
01:17:42,790 --> 01:17:42,800
the sense of the answer is no well well
 

5087
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,390
the sense of the answer is no well well
not clear yet because

5088
01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:44,400
not clear yet because
 

5089
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:45,110
not clear yet because
what

5090
01:17:45,110 --> 01:17:45,120
what
 

5091
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,790
what
one of our case score is a lower bound

5092
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:46,800
one of our case score is a lower bound
 

5093
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,630
one of our case score is a lower bound
that's that's probably the best you can

5094
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:48,640
that's that's probably the best you can
 

5095
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:51,189
that's that's probably the best you can
do what gradient is one over k but is

5096
01:17:51,189 --> 01:17:51,199
do what gradient is one over k but is
 

5097
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:52,470
do what gradient is one over k but is
there something better

5098
01:17:52,470 --> 01:17:52,480
there something better
 

5099
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:55,270
there something better
and so i think as a surprise to most

5100
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:55,280
and so i think as a surprise to most
 

5101
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,790
and so i think as a surprise to most
though nest drove discovered a new

5102
01:17:56,790 --> 01:17:56,800
though nest drove discovered a new
 

5103
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:59,830
though nest drove discovered a new
algorithm that is got two pieces to it

5104
01:17:59,830 --> 01:17:59,840
algorithm that is got two pieces to it
 

5105
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,669
algorithm that is got two pieces to it
it uses two gradients

5106
01:18:01,669 --> 01:18:01,679
it uses two gradients
 

5107
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:02,790
it uses two gradients
um

5108
01:18:02,790 --> 01:18:02,800
um
 

5109
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:05,030
um
and uh puts those together in a certain

5110
01:18:05,030 --> 01:18:05,040
and uh puts those together in a certain
 

5111
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:07,669
and uh puts those together in a certain
kind of obscure way and uh the thing

5112
01:18:07,669 --> 01:18:07,679
kind of obscure way and uh the thing
 

5113
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:09,110
kind of obscure way and uh the thing
doesn't even move downhill all the time

5114
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:09,120
doesn't even move downhill all the time
 

5115
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:11,270
doesn't even move downhill all the time
it sometimes goes back uphill

5116
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:11,280
it sometimes goes back uphill
 

5117
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:12,470
it sometimes goes back uphill
and if you're a physicist that kind of

5118
01:18:12,470 --> 01:18:12,480
and if you're a physicist that kind of
 

5119
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:13,590
and if you're a physicist that kind of
makes some sense you're building up some

5120
01:18:13,590 --> 01:18:13,600
makes some sense you're building up some
 

5121
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,590
makes some sense you're building up some
momentum and that is kind of the right

5122
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:15,600
momentum and that is kind of the right
 

5123
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,990
momentum and that is kind of the right
intuition but that that intuition is not

5124
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:18,000
intuition but that that intuition is not
 

5125
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,590
intuition but that that intuition is not
enough to understand kind of how to do

5126
01:18:19,590 --> 01:18:19,600
enough to understand kind of how to do
 

5127
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,430
enough to understand kind of how to do
it and why it works

5128
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:21,440
it and why it works
 

5129
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:22,229
it and why it works
um

5130
01:18:22,229 --> 01:18:22,239
um
 

5131
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:23,990
um
but it does it achieves one over k

5132
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:24,000
but it does it achieves one over k
 

5133
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,310
but it does it achieves one over k
squared and uh it has a mathematical

5134
01:18:26,310 --> 01:18:26,320
squared and uh it has a mathematical
 

5135
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,149
squared and uh it has a mathematical
structure and it's still kind of to this

5136
01:18:28,149 --> 01:18:28,159
structure and it's still kind of to this
 

5137
01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:29,669
structure and it's still kind of to this
day a lot of us are writing papers and

5138
01:18:29,669 --> 01:18:29,679
day a lot of us are writing papers and
 

5139
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:31,990
day a lot of us are writing papers and
trying to explore that and understand it

5140
01:18:31,990 --> 01:18:32,000
trying to explore that and understand it
 

5141
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,390
trying to explore that and understand it
um so there are lots of cool ideas in

5142
01:18:34,390 --> 01:18:34,400
um so there are lots of cool ideas in
 

5143
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:35,830
um so there are lots of cool ideas in
optimization but just kind of using

5144
01:18:35,830 --> 01:18:35,840
optimization but just kind of using
 

5145
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,430
optimization but just kind of using
gradients i think is number one that

5146
01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:37,440
gradients i think is number one that
 

5147
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:40,709
gradients i think is number one that
goes back you know 150 years um and then

5148
01:18:40,709 --> 01:18:40,719
goes back you know 150 years um and then
 

5149
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:42,070
goes back you know 150 years um and then
nest drive i think has made a major

5150
01:18:42,070 --> 01:18:42,080
nest drive i think has made a major
 

5151
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,830
nest drive i think has made a major
contribution with this idea so like you

5152
01:18:43,830 --> 01:18:43,840
contribution with this idea so like you
 

5153
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:45,830
contribution with this idea so like you
said gradients themselves are in some

5154
01:18:45,830 --> 01:18:45,840
said gradients themselves are in some
 

5155
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,709
said gradients themselves are in some
sense mysterious yeah they're not uh

5156
01:18:48,709 --> 01:18:48,719
sense mysterious yeah they're not uh
 

5157
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:50,470
sense mysterious yeah they're not uh
they're not as trivial as they're not as

5158
01:18:50,470 --> 01:18:50,480
they're not as trivial as they're not as
 

5159
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:51,590
they're not as trivial as they're not as
trivial

5160
01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:51,600
trivial
 

5161
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,750
trivial
coordinate descent is more of a trivial

5162
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:53,760
coordinate descent is more of a trivial
 

5163
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:55,270
coordinate descent is more of a trivial
one you just pick one of the coordinates

5164
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:55,280
one you just pick one of the coordinates
 

5165
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:56,550
one you just pick one of the coordinates
that's how we think that's our human

5166
01:18:56,550 --> 01:18:56,560
that's how we think that's our human
 

5167
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,149
that's how we think that's our human
mind that's our human minds think and

5168
01:18:58,149 --> 01:18:58,159
mind that's our human minds think and
 

5169
01:18:58,159 --> 01:19:00,070
mind that's our human minds think and
gradients are not that easy for our

5170
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:00,080
gradients are not that easy for our
 

5171
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:03,110
gradients are not that easy for our
human mind to grapple with

5172
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:03,120
human mind to grapple with
 

5173
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:04,870
human mind to grapple with
an absurd question

5174
01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:04,880
an absurd question
 

5175
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:08,390
an absurd question
but uh what is statistics

5176
01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:08,400
but uh what is statistics
 

5177
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,750
but uh what is statistics
so the here it's a little bit it's

5178
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:09,760
so the here it's a little bit it's
 

5179
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:11,430
so the here it's a little bit it's
somewhere between math and science and

5180
01:19:11,430 --> 01:19:11,440
somewhere between math and science and
 

5181
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:13,030
somewhere between math and science and
technology it's somewhere in that convex

5182
01:19:13,030 --> 01:19:13,040
technology it's somewhere in that convex
 

5183
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,550
technology it's somewhere in that convex
hole so it's a

5184
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:14,560
hole so it's a
 

5185
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:16,070
hole so it's a
set of principles that allow you to make

5186
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:16,080
set of principles that allow you to make
 

5187
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,750
set of principles that allow you to make
inferences that have got some reason to

5188
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:17,760
inferences that have got some reason to
 

5189
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:20,229
inferences that have got some reason to
be believed and also principles allow

5190
01:19:20,229 --> 01:19:20,239
be believed and also principles allow
 

5191
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:22,390
be believed and also principles allow
you make decisions where you can have

5192
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:22,400
you make decisions where you can have
 

5193
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:23,510
you make decisions where you can have
some reason to believe you're not going

5194
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:23,520
some reason to believe you're not going
 

5195
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:24,870
some reason to believe you're not going
to make errors

5196
01:19:24,870 --> 01:19:24,880
to make errors
 

5197
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,310
to make errors
so all of that requires some assumptions

5198
01:19:26,310 --> 01:19:26,320
so all of that requires some assumptions
 

5199
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:27,590
so all of that requires some assumptions
about what do you mean by an error what

5200
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:27,600
about what do you mean by an error what
 

5201
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,030
about what do you mean by an error what
do you mean by you know the

5202
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:29,040
do you mean by you know the
 

5203
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:31,110
do you mean by you know the
probabilities and um

5204
01:19:31,110 --> 01:19:31,120
probabilities and um
 

5205
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:33,110
probabilities and um
but you know you start after you start

5206
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:33,120
but you know you start after you start
 

5207
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,390
but you know you start after you start
making some of those assumptions you're

5208
01:19:34,390 --> 01:19:34,400
making some of those assumptions you're
 

5209
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:35,510
making some of those assumptions you're
led to

5210
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:35,520
led to
 

5211
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:36,630
led to
uh

5212
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:36,640
uh
 

5213
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,550
uh
conclusions that yes i can guarantee

5214
01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:38,560
conclusions that yes i can guarantee
 

5215
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,229
conclusions that yes i can guarantee
that you know you know if you do this in

5216
01:19:40,229 --> 01:19:40,239
that you know you know if you do this in
 

5217
01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:41,430
that you know you know if you do this in
this way your probability of making

5218
01:19:41,430 --> 01:19:41,440
this way your probability of making
 

5219
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:43,350
this way your probability of making
error will be small

5220
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:43,360
error will be small
 

5221
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:45,510
error will be small
your probability of continuing to not

5222
01:19:45,510 --> 01:19:45,520
your probability of continuing to not
 

5223
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:48,630
your probability of continuing to not
make errors over time will be small and

5224
01:19:48,630 --> 01:19:48,640
make errors over time will be small and
 

5225
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:49,990
make errors over time will be small and
probability you found something that's

5226
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:50,000
probability you found something that's
 

5227
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,630
probability you found something that's
real will be small uh will be high so

5228
01:19:52,630 --> 01:19:52,640
real will be small uh will be high so
 

5229
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:55,030
real will be small uh will be high so
decision making is a big part of the big

5230
01:19:55,030 --> 01:19:55,040
decision making is a big part of the big
 

5231
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,030
decision making is a big part of the big
part yeah so uh the original so

5232
01:19:57,030 --> 01:19:57,040
part yeah so uh the original so
 

5233
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:59,189
part yeah so uh the original so
statistics uh you know short history was

5234
01:19:59,189 --> 01:19:59,199
statistics uh you know short history was
 

5235
01:19:59,199 --> 01:20:01,750
statistics uh you know short history was
that you know it's kind of goes back

5236
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:01,760
that you know it's kind of goes back
 

5237
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,350
that you know it's kind of goes back
as a formal discipline you know 250

5238
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:03,360
as a formal discipline you know 250
 

5239
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:04,709
as a formal discipline you know 250
years or so

5240
01:20:04,709 --> 01:20:04,719
years or so
 

5241
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:06,310
years or so
it was called inverse probability

5242
01:20:06,310 --> 01:20:06,320
it was called inverse probability
 

5243
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:08,229
it was called inverse probability
because around that era

5244
01:20:08,229 --> 01:20:08,239
because around that era
 

5245
01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:09,669
because around that era
probability was developed sort of

5246
01:20:09,669 --> 01:20:09,679
probability was developed sort of
 

5247
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:12,229
probability was developed sort of
especially to explain gambling

5248
01:20:12,229 --> 01:20:12,239
especially to explain gambling
 

5249
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:15,350
especially to explain gambling
situations of course and um interesting

5250
01:20:15,350 --> 01:20:15,360
situations of course and um interesting
 

5251
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,149
situations of course and um interesting
so

5252
01:20:16,149 --> 01:20:16,159
so
 

5253
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:17,430
so
you would say well given the state of

5254
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:17,440
you would say well given the state of
 

5255
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:18,470
you would say well given the state of
nature is this there's a certain

5256
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:18,480
nature is this there's a certain
 

5257
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,510
nature is this there's a certain
roulette board that has a certain

5258
01:20:19,510 --> 01:20:19,520
roulette board that has a certain
 

5259
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:21,590
roulette board that has a certain
mechanism in it uh what kind of outcomes

5260
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:21,600
mechanism in it uh what kind of outcomes
 

5261
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:22,950
mechanism in it uh what kind of outcomes
do i expect to see

5262
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:22,960
do i expect to see
 

5263
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:25,830
do i expect to see
uh and um especially if i do things long

5264
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:25,840
uh and um especially if i do things long
 

5265
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,430
uh and um especially if i do things long
long amounts of time what outcomes i see

5266
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:27,440
long amounts of time what outcomes i see
 

5267
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,310
long amounts of time what outcomes i see
and the physicists start to pay

5268
01:20:28,310 --> 01:20:28,320
and the physicists start to pay
 

5269
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:29,590
and the physicists start to pay
attention to this

5270
01:20:29,590 --> 01:20:29,600
attention to this
 

5271
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:32,229
attention to this
um and then people say well given let's

5272
01:20:32,229 --> 01:20:32,239
um and then people say well given let's
 

5273
01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:34,390
um and then people say well given let's
turn the problem around what if i saw

5274
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:34,400
turn the problem around what if i saw
 

5275
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:35,830
turn the problem around what if i saw
certain outcomes could i infer what the

5276
01:20:35,830 --> 01:20:35,840
certain outcomes could i infer what the
 

5277
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,590
certain outcomes could i infer what the
underlying mechanism was that's an

5278
01:20:37,590 --> 01:20:37,600
underlying mechanism was that's an
 

5279
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,430
underlying mechanism was that's an
inverse problem and in fact for quite a

5280
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:39,440
inverse problem and in fact for quite a
 

5281
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:40,950
inverse problem and in fact for quite a
while statistics was called inverse

5282
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:40,960
while statistics was called inverse
 

5283
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,550
while statistics was called inverse
probability that was the name of the

5284
01:20:42,550 --> 01:20:42,560
probability that was the name of the
 

5285
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:43,750
probability that was the name of the
field

5286
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:43,760
field
 

5287
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:47,270
field
and i believe that uh it was laplace uh

5288
01:20:47,270 --> 01:20:47,280
and i believe that uh it was laplace uh
 

5289
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,270
and i believe that uh it was laplace uh
who was working in napoleon's government

5290
01:20:49,270 --> 01:20:49,280
who was working in napoleon's government

01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,709
census of france
learn about the people there so he went

5296
01:20:54,709 --> 01:20:54,719
learn about the people there so he went
 

5297
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:56,950
learn about the people there so he went
and gathered data and he analyzed that

5298
01:20:56,950 --> 01:20:56,960
and gathered data and he analyzed that
 

5299
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:00,950
and gathered data and he analyzed that
data to determine policy and uh said

5300
01:21:00,950 --> 01:21:00,960
data to determine policy and uh said
 

5301
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:03,270
data to determine policy and uh said
let's call this field that does this

5302
01:21:03,270 --> 01:21:03,280
let's call this field that does this
 

5303
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,590
let's call this field that does this
kind of thing statistics because um

5304
01:21:05,590 --> 01:21:05,600
kind of thing statistics because um
 

5305
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,669
kind of thing statistics because um
the the word state is in there in french

5306
01:21:07,669 --> 01:21:07,679
the the word state is in there in french
 

5307
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:09,430
the the word state is in there in french
that's eta but

5308
01:21:09,430 --> 01:21:09,440
that's eta but
 

5309
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,270
that's eta but
you know it's the study of data for the

5310
01:21:11,270 --> 01:21:11,280
you know it's the study of data for the
 

5311
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:13,350
you know it's the study of data for the
state

5312
01:21:13,350 --> 01:21:13,360
state
 

5313
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,350
state
so anyway that caught on and um it's

5314
01:21:15,350 --> 01:21:15,360
so anyway that caught on and um it's
 

5315
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:18,229
so anyway that caught on and um it's
been called statistics ever since but um

5316
01:21:18,229 --> 01:21:18,239
been called statistics ever since but um
 

5317
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:20,470
been called statistics ever since but um
uh but by the time it got formalized it

5318
01:21:20,470 --> 01:21:20,480
uh but by the time it got formalized it
 

5319
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:22,870
uh but by the time it got formalized it
was sort of in the 30s um

5320
01:21:22,870 --> 01:21:22,880
was sort of in the 30s um
 

5321
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:24,709
was sort of in the 30s um
and uh around that time there was game

5322
01:21:24,709 --> 01:21:24,719
and uh around that time there was game
 

5323
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:26,390
and uh around that time there was game
theory and decision theory developed

5324
01:21:26,390 --> 01:21:26,400
theory and decision theory developed
 

5325
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,229
theory and decision theory developed
nearby

5326
01:21:28,229 --> 01:21:28,239
nearby
 

5327
01:21:28,239 --> 01:21:29,270
nearby
people in that era didn't think of

5328
01:21:29,270 --> 01:21:29,280
people in that era didn't think of
 

5329
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:30,950
people in that era didn't think of
themselves as either computer science or

5330
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:30,960
themselves as either computer science or
 

5331
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,629
themselves as either computer science or
statistics or controlled or econ they

5332
01:21:32,629 --> 01:21:32,639
statistics or controlled or econ they
 

5333
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:34,709
statistics or controlled or econ they
were all they were all the above and so

5334
01:21:34,709 --> 01:21:34,719
were all they were all the above and so
 

5335
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:36,149
were all they were all the above and so
you know von neumann is developing game

5336
01:21:36,149 --> 01:21:36,159
you know von neumann is developing game
 

5337
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:37,910
you know von neumann is developing game
theory but also thinking of that as

5338
01:21:37,910 --> 01:21:37,920
theory but also thinking of that as
 

5339
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,750
theory but also thinking of that as
decision theory wall is an

5340
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:39,760
decision theory wall is an
 

5341
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:41,990
decision theory wall is an
econometrician developing decision

5342
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:42,000
econometrician developing decision
 

5343
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,350
econometrician developing decision
theory and then you know turning that

5344
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:43,360
theory and then you know turning that
 

5345
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:44,870
theory and then you know turning that
into statistics

5346
01:21:44,870 --> 01:21:44,880
into statistics
 

5347
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:46,950
into statistics
and so it's all about here's a

5348
01:21:46,950 --> 01:21:46,960
and so it's all about here's a
 

5349
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:48,629
and so it's all about here's a
here's not just data and you analyze it

5350
01:21:48,629 --> 01:21:48,639
here's not just data and you analyze it
 

5351
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:50,390
here's not just data and you analyze it
here's a loss function here's what you

5352
01:21:50,390 --> 01:21:50,400
here's a loss function here's what you
 

5353
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:51,350
here's a loss function here's what you
care about here's the question you're

5354
01:21:51,350 --> 01:21:51,360
care about here's the question you're
 

5355
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,870
care about here's the question you're
trying to ask

5356
01:21:52,870 --> 01:21:52,880
trying to ask
 

5357
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:55,110
trying to ask
here is a probability model and here's

5358
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:55,120
here is a probability model and here's
 

5359
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:56,629
here is a probability model and here's
the risk you will face if you make

5360
01:21:56,629 --> 01:21:56,639
the risk you will face if you make
 

5361
01:21:56,639 --> 01:21:58,390
the risk you will face if you make
certain decisions

5362
01:21:58,390 --> 01:21:58,400
certain decisions
 

5363
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:01,590
certain decisions
um and to this day in most advanced

5364
01:22:01,590 --> 01:22:01,600
um and to this day in most advanced
 

5365
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,669
um and to this day in most advanced
statistical curricula you teach decision

5366
01:22:03,669 --> 01:22:03,679
statistical curricula you teach decision
 

5367
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:05,669
statistical curricula you teach decision
theory is the starting point and then it

5368
01:22:05,669 --> 01:22:05,679
theory is the starting point and then it
 

5369
01:22:05,679 --> 01:22:07,270
theory is the starting point and then it
branches out into the two branches of

5370
01:22:07,270 --> 01:22:07,280
branches out into the two branches of
 

5371
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:09,510
branches out into the two branches of
bazin or frequentist but um that's it's

5372
01:22:09,510 --> 01:22:09,520
bazin or frequentist but um that's it's
 

5373
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:11,669
bazin or frequentist but um that's it's
all about decisions

5374
01:22:11,669 --> 01:22:11,679
all about decisions
 

5375
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:14,790
all about decisions
in statistics what is the most

5376
01:22:14,790 --> 01:22:14,800
in statistics what is the most
 

5377
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,070
in statistics what is the most
beautiful

5378
01:22:16,070 --> 01:22:16,080
beautiful

mysterious maybe surprising idea that
you've come across

5382
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:21,520
you've come across
 

5383
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:25,189
you've come across
uh yeah good question um

5384
01:22:25,189 --> 01:22:25,199
uh yeah good question um
 

5385
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:27,110
uh yeah good question um
i mean there's a bunch of surprising

5386
01:22:27,110 --> 01:22:27,120
i mean there's a bunch of surprising
 

5387
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:28,550
i mean there's a bunch of surprising
ones there's something that's way too

5388
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:28,560
ones there's something that's way too
 

5389
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:29,830
ones there's something that's way too
technical for this thing but something

5390
01:22:29,830 --> 01:22:29,840
technical for this thing but something
 

5391
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:31,669
technical for this thing but something
called james stein estimation which is

5392
01:22:31,669 --> 01:22:31,679
called james stein estimation which is
 

5393
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:33,430
called james stein estimation which is
kind of surprising

5394
01:22:33,430 --> 01:22:33,440
kind of surprising
 

5395
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:35,030
kind of surprising
and really takes time to wrap your head

5396
01:22:35,030 --> 01:22:35,040
and really takes time to wrap your head
 

5397
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,510
and really takes time to wrap your head
around can you try to maybe i think i

5398
01:22:37,510 --> 01:22:37,520
around can you try to maybe i think i
 

5399
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:40,070
around can you try to maybe i think i
don't even want to try um let me just

5400
01:22:40,070 --> 01:22:40,080
don't even want to try um let me just
 

5401
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,350
don't even want to try um let me just
say a colleague

5402
01:22:41,350 --> 01:22:41,360
say a colleague

paper on james stein estimation which
 

5409
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:48,790
paper on james stein estimation which
helps to its views of paradox it kind of

5410
01:22:48,790 --> 01:22:48,800
helps to its views of paradox it kind of
 

5411
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:49,990
helps to its views of paradox it kind of
defeats the mind's attempts to

5412
01:22:49,990 --> 01:22:50,000
defeats the mind's attempts to
 

5413
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,149
defeats the mind's attempts to
understand it but you can and steve has

5414
01:22:52,149 --> 01:22:52,159
understand it but you can and steve has
 

5415
01:22:52,159 --> 01:22:54,149
understand it but you can and steve has
a nice perspective on that

5416
01:22:54,149 --> 01:22:54,159
a nice perspective on that
 

5417
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:55,669
a nice perspective on that
um

5418
01:22:55,669 --> 01:22:55,679
um
 

5419
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:57,750
um
there uh so one of the troubles with

5420
01:22:57,750 --> 01:22:57,760
there uh so one of the troubles with
 

5421
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:59,510
there uh so one of the troubles with
statistics is that it's like in physics

5422
01:22:59,510 --> 01:22:59,520
statistics is that it's like in physics
 

5423
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:01,189
statistics is that it's like in physics
that are in quantum physics you have

5424
01:23:01,189 --> 01:23:01,199
that are in quantum physics you have
 

5425
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:02,950
that are in quantum physics you have
multiple interpretations there's a wave

5426
01:23:02,950 --> 01:23:02,960
multiple interpretations there's a wave
 

5427
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:05,510
multiple interpretations there's a wave
and particle duality in physics and

5428
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:05,520
and particle duality in physics and
 

5429
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:07,510
and particle duality in physics and
you get used to that over time but it

5430
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:07,520
you get used to that over time but it
 

5431
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:09,030
you get used to that over time but it
still kind of haunts you that you don't

5432
01:23:09,030 --> 01:23:09,040
still kind of haunts you that you don't
 

5433
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:09,750
still kind of haunts you that you don't
really

5434
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:09,760
really
 

5435
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:10,950
really
you know quite understand the

5436
01:23:10,950 --> 01:23:10,960
you know quite understand the
 

5437
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,550
you know quite understand the
relationship the electrons away when

5438
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:12,560
relationship the electrons away when
 

5439
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:14,870
relationship the electrons away when
electrons a particle well

5440
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:14,880
electrons a particle well
 

5441
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,550
electrons a particle well
um well the same thing happens here

5442
01:23:16,550 --> 01:23:16,560
um well the same thing happens here
 

5443
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,310
um well the same thing happens here
there's bayesian ways of thinking and

5444
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:18,320
there's bayesian ways of thinking and
 

5445
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,629
there's bayesian ways of thinking and
frequentist and they are different they

5446
01:23:20,629 --> 01:23:20,639
frequentist and they are different they
 

5447
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:22,390
frequentist and they are different they
they all they sometimes become sort of

5448
01:23:22,390 --> 01:23:22,400
they all they sometimes become sort of
 

5449
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,070
they all they sometimes become sort of
the same in practice but they are

5450
01:23:24,070 --> 01:23:24,080
the same in practice but they are
 

5451
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:25,990
the same in practice but they are
physically different and then in some

5452
01:23:25,990 --> 01:23:26,000
physically different and then in some
 

5453
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,510
physically different and then in some
practice they are not the same at all

5454
01:23:27,510 --> 01:23:27,520
practice they are not the same at all
 

5455
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,750
practice they are not the same at all
they give you rather different answers

5456
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:29,760
they give you rather different answers
 

5457
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,590
they give you rather different answers
um and so it is very much like wave and

5458
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:31,600
um and so it is very much like wave and
 

5459
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,590
um and so it is very much like wave and
particle duality and that is something

5460
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:33,600
particle duality and that is something
 

5461
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,030
particle duality and that is something
you have to kind of get used to in the

5462
01:23:35,030 --> 01:23:35,040
you have to kind of get used to in the
 

5463
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,790
you have to kind of get used to in the
field can you define beijing and

5464
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:36,800
field can you define beijing and
 

5465
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,470
field can you define beijing and
frequencies yeah in decision theory you

5466
01:23:38,470 --> 01:23:38,480
frequencies yeah in decision theory you
 

5467
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:40,310
frequencies yeah in decision theory you
can make i have a like i have a video

5468
01:23:40,310 --> 01:23:40,320
can make i have a like i have a video
 

5469
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:41,750
can make i have a like i have a video
that people could see it's called are

5470
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:41,760
that people could see it's called are
 

5471
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:43,350
that people could see it's called are
you a bayesian or a frequentist and kind

5472
01:23:43,350 --> 01:23:43,360
you a bayesian or a frequentist and kind
 

5473
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:44,950
you a bayesian or a frequentist and kind
of help try to

5474
01:23:44,950 --> 01:23:44,960
of help try to
 

5475
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:46,310
of help try to
to make it really clear it comes from

5476
01:23:46,310 --> 01:23:46,320
to make it really clear it comes from
 

5477
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,550
to make it really clear it comes from
decision theory so you know decision

5478
01:23:48,550 --> 01:23:48,560
decision theory so you know decision
 

5479
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:49,590
decision theory so you know decision
theory

5480
01:23:49,590 --> 01:23:49,600
theory
 

5481
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:51,189
theory
uh you're talking about loss functions

5482
01:23:51,189 --> 01:23:51,199
uh you're talking about loss functions
 

5483
01:23:51,199 --> 01:23:52,790
uh you're talking about loss functions
which are a function of

5484
01:23:52,790 --> 01:23:52,800
which are a function of
 

5485
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:55,270
which are a function of
data x and parameter theta it's a

5486
01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:55,280
data x and parameter theta it's a
 

5487
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,110
data x and parameter theta it's a
function of two arguments

5488
01:23:57,110 --> 01:23:57,120
function of two arguments
 

5489
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:58,310
function of two arguments
okay

5490
01:23:58,310 --> 01:23:58,320
okay
 

5491
01:23:58,320 --> 01:23:59,669
okay
neither one of those arguments is known

5492
01:23:59,669 --> 01:23:59,679
neither one of those arguments is known
 

5493
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:01,669
neither one of those arguments is known
you don't know the data a priori it's

5494
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:01,679
you don't know the data a priori it's
 

5495
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:02,709
you don't know the data a priori it's
random

5496
01:24:02,709 --> 01:24:02,719
random
 

5497
01:24:02,719 --> 01:24:04,229
random
and the parameter is unknown all right

5498
01:24:04,229 --> 01:24:04,239
and the parameter is unknown all right
 

5499
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:05,430
and the parameter is unknown all right
so you have this function of two things

5500
01:24:05,430 --> 01:24:05,440
so you have this function of two things
 

5501
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:06,790
so you have this function of two things
you don't know and you're trying to say

5502
01:24:06,790 --> 01:24:06,800
you don't know and you're trying to say
 

5503
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,310
you don't know and you're trying to say
i want that function to be small i want

5504
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:08,320
i want that function to be small i want
 

5505
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,590
i want that function to be small i want
small loss

5506
01:24:09,590 --> 01:24:09,600
small loss
 

5507
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,629
small loss
right

5508
01:24:10,629 --> 01:24:10,639
right
 

5509
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:12,470
right
well um

5510
01:24:12,470 --> 01:24:12,480
well um
 

5511
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:13,990
well um
what are you gonna do so you sort of say

5512
01:24:13,990 --> 01:24:14,000
what are you gonna do so you sort of say
 

5513
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,430
what are you gonna do so you sort of say
well i'm gonna average over these

5514
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:15,440
well i'm gonna average over these
 

5515
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:17,350
well i'm gonna average over these
quantities or maximize over them or

5516
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:17,360
quantities or maximize over them or
 

5517
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:19,590
quantities or maximize over them or
something so that you know

5518
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:19,600
something so that you know
 

5519
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,350
something so that you know
i turn that uncertainty into something

5520
01:24:21,350 --> 01:24:21,360
i turn that uncertainty into something
 

5521
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:22,870
i turn that uncertainty into something
certain

5522
01:24:22,870 --> 01:24:22,880
certain
 

5523
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,550
certain
so you could look at the first argument

5524
01:24:24,550 --> 01:24:24,560
so you could look at the first argument
 

5525
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:25,750
so you could look at the first argument
an average over it or you could look at

5526
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:25,760
an average over it or you could look at
 

5527
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:26,870
an average over it or you could look at
the second argument average over it

5528
01:24:26,870 --> 01:24:26,880
the second argument average over it
 

5529
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,629
the second argument average over it
that's bayesian frequencies so the

5530
01:24:28,629 --> 01:24:28,639
that's bayesian frequencies so the
 

5531
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:30,070
that's bayesian frequencies so the
frequencies says i'm going to look at

5532
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:30,080
frequencies says i'm going to look at
 

5533
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,709
frequencies says i'm going to look at
the x the data and i'm going to take

5534
01:24:32,709 --> 01:24:32,719
the x the data and i'm going to take
 

5535
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:34,310
the x the data and i'm going to take
that as random and i'm going to average

5536
01:24:34,310 --> 01:24:34,320
that as random and i'm going to average
 

5537
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:35,669
that as random and i'm going to average
over the distribution so i take the

5538
01:24:35,669 --> 01:24:35,679
over the distribution so i take the
 

5539
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:38,470
over the distribution so i take the
expectation loss under x

5540
01:24:38,470 --> 01:24:38,480

theta is held fixed

5542
01:24:40,149 --> 01:24:40,159
theta is held fixed
 

5543
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:42,149
theta is held fixed
all right that's called the risk and so

5544
01:24:42,149 --> 01:24:42,159
all right that's called the risk and so
 

5545
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:43,910
all right that's called the risk and so
it's looking at other all the data sets

5546
01:24:43,910 --> 01:24:43,920
it's looking at other all the data sets
 

5547
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:45,669
it's looking at other all the data sets
you could get

5548
01:24:45,669 --> 01:24:45,679
you could get
 

5549
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:47,189
you could get
all right and say how well will a

5550
01:24:47,189 --> 01:24:47,199
all right and say how well will a
 

5551
01:24:47,199 --> 01:24:48,629
all right and say how well will a
certain procedure do under all those

5552
01:24:48,629 --> 01:24:48,639
certain procedure do under all those
 

5553
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:49,830
certain procedure do under all those
data sets

5554
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:49,840
data sets
 

5555
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:52,149
data sets
that's called a frequency guarantee

5556
01:24:52,149 --> 01:24:52,159
that's called a frequency guarantee
 

5557
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:53,430
that's called a frequency guarantee
all right so i think it is very

5558
01:24:53,430 --> 01:24:53,440
all right so i think it is very
 

5559
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:54,790
all right so i think it is very

many many data sets that you never even

many many data sets that you never even

the bayesian perspective says well no

5578
01:25:11,590 --> 01:25:11,600
the bayesian perspective says well no

01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:12,950
the bayesian perspective says well no
i'm going to look at the other argument

5580
01:25:12,950 --> 01:25:12,960
i'm going to look at the other argument
 

5581
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:14,950
i'm going to look at the other argument
of the loss function the theta part okay

5582
01:25:14,950 --> 01:25:14,960
of the loss function the theta part okay
 

5583
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:16,790
of the loss function the theta part okay
that's unknown and i'm uncertain about

5584
01:25:16,790 --> 01:25:16,800
that's unknown and i'm uncertain about
 

5585
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:19,110
that's unknown and i'm uncertain about
it so i could have my own personal

5586
01:25:19,110 --> 01:25:19,120
it so i could have my own personal
 

5587
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:20,709
it so i could have my own personal

many tall people are there out there i'm

5590
01:25:22,149 --> 01:25:22,159

5591
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:23,430
many tall people are there out there i'm
trying to infer the average height of

01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:23,440
trying to infer the average height of
 

5593
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:24,709
trying to infer the average height of
the population well i have an idea

5594
01:25:24,709 --> 01:25:24,719
the population well i have an idea
 

5595
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:27,270
the population well i have an idea
roughly what the height is

5596
01:25:27,270 --> 01:25:27,280
roughly what the height is
 

5597
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:30,629
roughly what the height is
so i'm going to average over the um

5598
01:25:30,629 --> 01:25:30,639
so i'm going to average over the um
 

5599
01:25:30,639 --> 01:25:31,990
so i'm going to average over the um
the theta

5600
01:25:31,990 --> 01:25:32,000
the theta
 

5601
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,950
the theta
so now that loss function has only now

5602
01:25:34,950 --> 01:25:34,960
so now that loss function has only now
 

5603
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:37,030
so now that loss function has only now
again one argument's gone

5604
01:25:37,030 --> 01:25:37,040
again one argument's gone
 

5605
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:38,629
again one argument's gone
now it's a function of x

5606
01:25:38,629 --> 01:25:38,639
now it's a function of x
 

5607
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:40,070
now it's a function of x
and that's what a bayesian does is they

5608
01:25:40,070 --> 01:25:40,080
and that's what a bayesian does is they
 

5609
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:41,270
and that's what a bayesian does is they
say well let's just focus on the

01:25:41,270 --> 01:25:41,280
say well let's just focus on the
 

5611
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:43,030
say well let's just focus on the
particular x we got the data set we got

we condition on that
 

5615
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,790
we condition on that
conditional on the x i say something

about my loss that's a bayesian approach

about my loss that's a bayesian approach
 

5619
01:25:49,199 --> 01:25:52,070
about my loss that's a bayesian approach
to things and the bayesian will argue

5620
01:25:52,070 --> 01:25:52,080
to things and the bayesian will argue
 

5621
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:53,590
to things and the bayesian will argue
that it's not relevant to look at all

01:25:53,590 --> 01:25:53,600
that it's not relevant to look at all

that it's not relevant to look at all
the other data sets you could have

it's really only the data set you got

it's really only the data set you got
 

5631

it's really only the data set you got
all right and i do agree with that

01:26:03,350 --> 01:26:03,360
all right and i do agree with that
 

5633
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:04,790
all right and i do agree with that
especially in situations where you're

5634
01:26:04,790 --> 01:26:04,800
especially in situations where you're
 

5635
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,310
especially in situations where you're
working with a scientist you can learn a

working with a scientist you can learn a
 

5637
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:08,149
working with a scientist you can learn a
lot about the domain and you really only

5638
01:26:08,149 --> 01:26:08,159
lot about the domain and you really only
 

5639
01:26:08,159 --> 01:26:09,590
lot about the domain and you really only
focus on certain kinds of data and

5640
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:09,600
focus on certain kinds of data and
 

5641
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,430
focus on certain kinds of data and
you've gathered your data and you make

01:26:11,430 --> 01:26:11,440
you've gathered your data and you make
 

5643
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:13,189
you've gathered your data and you make
inferences

inferences
 

5645
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:14,870

i don't agree with it though that it you

5646
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:14,880
i don't agree with it though that it you
 

5647
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,950
i don't agree with it though that it you
know in the sense that there are needs

01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:21,270

you want to say something so these two

5654
01:26:21,270 --> 01:26:21,280
you want to say something so these two
 

5655
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:22,629
you want to say something so these two
things have to go out to fight each

5656
01:26:22,629 --> 01:26:22,639
things have to go out to fight each
 

5657
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:23,510
things have to go out to fight each
other a little bit but they have to

5658
01:26:23,510 --> 01:26:23,520
other a little bit but they have to
 

5659
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:24,629
other a little bit but they have to
blend

so long story short there's a set of

so long story short there's a set of

it's

you know reasonable and kosher
write down a bunch of the math that kind

5680
01:26:42,149 --> 01:26:42,159
write down a bunch of the math that kind
 

5681
01:26:42,159 --> 01:26:43,910
write down a bunch of the math that kind
of flows from that and then realize

of flows from that and then realize

there's a bunch of things you don't know

there's a bunch of things you don't know
 

5685
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:46,790
there's a bunch of things you don't know
because it's the real world then you

01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:46,800
because it's the real world then you
 

5687
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,149
because it's the real world then you
don't know everything so you're

5688
01:26:48,149 --> 01:26:48,159
don't know everything so you're
 

5689
01:26:48,159 --> 01:26:50,149
don't know everything so you're
uncertain about certain quantities at

5690
01:26:50,149 --> 01:26:50,159
uncertain about certain quantities at
 

5691
01:26:50,159 --> 01:26:51,990
uncertain about certain quantities at
that point ask is there a reasonable way

5692
01:26:51,990 --> 01:26:52,000
that point ask is there a reasonable way
 

5693
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,629
that point ask is there a reasonable way
to plug in an estimate for those things

5694
01:26:54,629 --> 01:26:54,639
to plug in an estimate for those things
 

5695
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:57,270
to plug in an estimate for those things
okay and in some cases there's quite a

5696
01:26:57,270 --> 01:26:57,280
okay and in some cases there's quite a
 

5697
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,950
okay and in some cases there's quite a
reasonable thing to do

5698
01:26:58,950 --> 01:26:58,960
reasonable thing to do
 

5699
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:00,709
reasonable thing to do
to plug in there's a natural thing you

5700
01:27:00,709 --> 01:27:00,719
to plug in there's a natural thing you
 

5701
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:01,990
to plug in there's a natural thing you
can observe in the world that you can

5702
01:27:01,990 --> 01:27:02,000
can observe in the world that you can
 

5703
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,030
can observe in the world that you can
plug in

5704
01:27:03,030 --> 01:27:03,040
plug in
 

5705
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:03,990
plug in
and then do a little bit more

5706
01:27:03,990 --> 01:27:04,000
and then do a little bit more
 

5707
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,430
and then do a little bit more
mathematics and assure yourself it's

5708
01:27:05,430 --> 01:27:05,440
mathematics and assure yourself it's
 

5709
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:07,750
mathematics and assure yourself it's
really good so my math are based on

5710
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:07,760
really good so my math are based on
 

5711
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:09,910
really good so my math are based on
human expertise what's what are good

5712
01:27:09,910 --> 01:27:09,920
human expertise what's what are good
 

5713
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,110
human expertise what's what are good
they're both going in the bayesian

5714
01:27:11,110 --> 01:27:11,120
they're both going in the bayesian
 

5715
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:12,310
they're both going in the bayesian
framework allows you to put a lot of

5716
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:12,320
framework allows you to put a lot of
 

5717
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:15,270
framework allows you to put a lot of
human expertise in

5718
01:27:15,270 --> 01:27:15,280
human expertise in
 

5719
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:17,110
human expertise in
but the math kind of guides you along

5720
01:27:17,110 --> 01:27:17,120
but the math kind of guides you along
 

5721
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:18,629
but the math kind of guides you along
that path and then kind of reassures you

5722
01:27:18,629 --> 01:27:18,639
that path and then kind of reassures you
 

5723
01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:19,910
that path and then kind of reassures you
at the end you could put that stamp of

5724
01:27:19,910 --> 01:27:19,920
at the end you could put that stamp of
 

5725
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:21,590
at the end you could put that stamp of
approval under certain assumptions this

5726
01:27:21,590 --> 01:27:21,600
approval under certain assumptions this
 

5727
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,350
approval under certain assumptions this
thing will work so perhaps you asked

5728
01:27:23,350 --> 01:27:23,360
thing will work so perhaps you asked
 

5729
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:24,629
thing will work so perhaps you asked
question what's my favorite you know or

5730
01:27:24,629 --> 01:27:24,639
question what's my favorite you know or
 

5731
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:26,310
question what's my favorite you know or
what's the most surprising nice idea so

5732
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:26,320
what's the most surprising nice idea so
 

5733
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:27,830
what's the most surprising nice idea so
one that is more accessible is something

5734
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:27,840
one that is more accessible is something
 

5735
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:31,510
one that is more accessible is something
called false discovery rate which is um

5736
01:27:31,510 --> 01:27:31,520
called false discovery rate which is um
 

5737
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:33,270
called false discovery rate which is um
you know you're making not just one

5738
01:27:33,270 --> 01:27:33,280
you know you're making not just one
 

5739
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,189
you know you're making not just one
hypothesis test or making one decision

5740
01:27:35,189 --> 01:27:35,199
hypothesis test or making one decision
 

5741
01:27:35,199 --> 01:27:36,950

01:27:36,950 --> 01:27:36,960
you're making a whole bag of them
 

5743
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,590
you're making a whole bag of them
and in that bag of decisions you look at

5744
01:27:39,590 --> 01:27:39,600
and in that bag of decisions you look at
 

5745
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,270
and in that bag of decisions you look at
the ones where you made a discovery you

5746
01:27:41,270 --> 01:27:41,280
the ones where you made a discovery you
 

5747
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:42,790
the ones where you made a discovery you
announced that something interesting it

5748
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:42,800
announced that something interesting it
 

5749
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,629
announced that something interesting it
happened all right that's gonna be some

you like the fraction of your false
 

5761
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,229
you like the fraction of your false

those latter ones are almost all of them

01:28:06,629 --> 01:28:06,639
those latter ones are almost all of them
 

5775
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:08,310
those latter ones are almost all of them
um

5776
01:28:08,310 --> 01:28:08,320
um
 

5777
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,070
um
have more of a frequencies flavor they

5778
01:28:10,070 --> 01:28:10,080
have more of a frequencies flavor they
 

5779
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:11,910
have more of a frequencies flavor they
say given the truth

5780
01:28:11,910 --> 01:28:11,920
say given the truth
 

5781
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:13,590
say given the truth
is that the null hypothesis is true

5782
01:28:13,590 --> 01:28:13,600
is that the null hypothesis is true
 

5783
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,669
is that the null hypothesis is true
here's what accuracy i would get or

5784
01:28:15,669 --> 01:28:15,679
here's what accuracy i would get or
 

5785
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:17,030
here's what accuracy i would get or
given that the alternative is true

5786
01:28:17,030 --> 01:28:17,040
given that the alternative is true
 

5787
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:18,790
given that the alternative is true
here's what i would get so it's kind of

5788
01:28:18,790 --> 01:28:18,800
here's what i would get so it's kind of
 

5789
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,870
here's what i would get so it's kind of
going forward from the state of nature

5790
01:28:20,870 --> 01:28:20,880
going forward from the state of nature
 

5791
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,149
going forward from the state of nature
to the data

5792
01:28:22,149 --> 01:28:22,159
to the data
 

5793
01:28:22,159 --> 01:28:23,669
to the data
the bayesian goes the other direction

5794
01:28:23,669 --> 01:28:23,679
the bayesian goes the other direction
 

5795
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:25,030
the bayesian goes the other direction
from the data back to the state of

5796
01:28:25,030 --> 01:28:25,040
from the data back to the state of
 

5797
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:26,629
from the data back to the state of
nature and that's actually what false

5798
01:28:26,629 --> 01:28:26,639
nature and that's actually what false
 

5799
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:28,790
nature and that's actually what false
discovery rate is it says given you made

5800
01:28:28,790 --> 01:28:28,800
discovery rate is it says given you made
 

5801
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:30,390
discovery rate is it says given you made
a discovery

5802
01:28:30,390 --> 01:28:30,400
a discovery
 

5803
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,390
a discovery
okay that's condition on your data

5804
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:32,400
okay that's condition on your data
 

5805
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:34,709
okay that's condition on your data
what's the probability of the hypothesis

5806
01:28:34,709 --> 01:28:34,719
what's the probability of the hypothesis
 

5807
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:36,629
what's the probability of the hypothesis
it's going the other direction

5808
01:28:36,629 --> 01:28:36,639
it's going the other direction
 

5809
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:39,189
it's going the other direction
and so um the classical frequency look

5810
01:28:39,189 --> 01:28:39,199
and so um the classical frequency look
 

5811
01:28:39,199 --> 01:28:40,390
and so um the classical frequency look
at that so i can't know that there's

5812
01:28:40,390 --> 01:28:40,400
at that so i can't know that there's
 

5813
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:42,629
at that so i can't know that there's
some priors needed in that and the

5814
01:28:42,629 --> 01:28:42,639
some priors needed in that and the
 

5815
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:45,189
some priors needed in that and the
empirical bayesian goes ahead and plows

5816
01:28:45,189 --> 01:28:45,199
empirical bayesian goes ahead and plows
 

5817
01:28:45,199 --> 01:28:46,950
empirical bayesian goes ahead and plows
forward and starts writing down these

5818
01:28:46,950 --> 01:28:46,960
forward and starts writing down these
 

5819
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:49,350
forward and starts writing down these
formulas and realizes at some point some

5820
01:28:49,350 --> 01:28:49,360
formulas and realizes at some point some
 

5821
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:50,310
formulas and realizes at some point some
of those things can actually be

5822
01:28:50,310 --> 01:28:50,320
of those things can actually be
 

5823
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:52,310
of those things can actually be
estimated in a reasonable way oh

5824
01:28:52,310 --> 01:28:52,320
estimated in a reasonable way oh
 

5825
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:53,669
estimated in a reasonable way oh
and so it's kind of it's a beautiful set

5826
01:28:53,669 --> 01:28:53,679
and so it's kind of it's a beautiful set
 

5827
01:28:53,679 --> 01:28:55,590
and so it's kind of it's a beautiful set
of ideas so i i this kind of line of

5828
01:28:55,590 --> 01:28:55,600
of ideas so i i this kind of line of
 

5829
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,510
of ideas so i i this kind of line of
argument has come out it's not certainly

5830
01:28:57,510 --> 01:28:57,520
argument has come out it's not certainly
 

5831
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:59,750
argument has come out it's not certainly
mine but it it sort of came out from

5832
01:28:59,750 --> 01:28:59,760
mine but it it sort of came out from
 

5833
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:03,590
mine but it it sort of came out from
robin's around 1960. uh brad ephron has

5834
01:29:03,590 --> 01:29:03,600
robin's around 1960. uh brad ephron has
 

5835
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:04,950
robin's around 1960. uh brad ephron has
written beautifully about this in

5836
01:29:04,950 --> 01:29:04,960
written beautifully about this in
 

5837
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:07,430
written beautifully about this in
various papers and books and uh and the

5838
01:29:07,430 --> 01:29:07,440
various papers and books and uh and the
 

5839
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:10,390
various papers and books and uh and the
fdr is you know ben yamini

5840
01:29:10,390 --> 01:29:10,400
fdr is you know ben yamini
 

5841
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,950
fdr is you know ben yamini
in israel um john storey did this

5842
01:29:12,950 --> 01:29:12,960
in israel um john storey did this
 

5843
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,709
in israel um john storey did this
bayesian interpretation and so on so

5844
01:29:14,709 --> 01:29:14,719
bayesian interpretation and so on so
 

5845
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:16,629
bayesian interpretation and so on so
i've just absorbed these things over the

5846
01:29:16,629 --> 01:29:16,639
i've just absorbed these things over the
 

5847
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:18,310
i've just absorbed these things over the
years and find it a very healthy way to

5848
01:29:18,310 --> 01:29:18,320
years and find it a very healthy way to
 

5849
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:21,030
years and find it a very healthy way to
think about statistics

5850
01:29:21,030 --> 01:29:21,040
think about statistics
 

5851
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:23,270
think about statistics
let me ask you about intelligence to

5852
01:29:23,270 --> 01:29:23,280
let me ask you about intelligence to
 

5853
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:25,750
let me ask you about intelligence to
jump slightly back out

5854
01:29:25,750 --> 01:29:25,760
jump slightly back out
 

5855
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,070
jump slightly back out

we'll one day understand the
 

5871
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:43,669
we'll one day understand the
fundamentals of human intelligence and

what it means

you know have good uh benchmarks for
 

5877
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,750

understand human intelligence right and
 

5895
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:08,629
understand human intelligence right and
i think

5896
01:30:08,629 --> 01:30:08,639
i think
 

5897
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:09,830
i think
many psychologists i know are fairly

01:32:33,350 --> 01:32:33,360
are so they are intelligent
 

6053
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:36,709
are so they are intelligent
uh now um we humans didn't evolve to be

6054
01:32:36,709 --> 01:32:36,719
uh now um we humans didn't evolve to be
 

6055

we've been participating in them right

01:32:40,070 --> 01:32:40,080
we've been participating in them right
 

6059
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:42,790
we've been participating in them right
but we are not ourselves a market per se

6060
01:32:42,790 --> 01:32:42,800
but we are not ourselves a market per se
 

6061
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:44,790
but we are not ourselves a market per se
um the neurons could be viewed as the

01:32:44,790 --> 01:32:44,800
um the neurons could be viewed as the

know neuroscience kind of perspectives

6066
01:32:47,990 --> 01:32:48,000
know neuroscience kind of perspectives
 

6067
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,149
know neuroscience kind of perspectives
that's interesting to pursue all that

6068
01:32:50,149 --> 01:32:50,159
that's interesting to pursue all that
 

6069
01:32:50,159 --> 01:32:51,590
that's interesting to pursue all that
the point though is is that if you were

6070
01:32:51,590 --> 01:32:51,600
the point though is is that if you were
 

6071
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,590
the point though is is that if you were
to study humans and really be the

6072
01:32:53,590 --> 01:32:53,600
to study humans and really be the
 

6073
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,030
to study humans and really be the
world's best psychologist study for

6074
01:32:55,030 --> 01:32:55,040
world's best psychologist study for
 

6075
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:56,470
world's best psychologist study for
thousands of years and come up with the

6076
01:32:56,470 --> 01:32:56,480
thousands of years and come up with the
 

6077
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:57,590
thousands of years and come up with the
theory of human intelligence you might

6078
01:32:57,590 --> 01:32:57,600
theory of human intelligence you might
 

6079
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,510
theory of human intelligence you might
have never discovered principles of

6080
01:32:59,510 --> 01:32:59,520
have never discovered principles of
 

6081
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:02,310
have never discovered principles of
markets you know spy demand curves and

6082
01:33:02,310 --> 01:33:02,320
markets you know spy demand curves and
 

6083
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:03,669
markets you know spy demand curves and
you know matching and auctions and all

6084
01:33:03,669 --> 01:33:03,679
you know matching and auctions and all
 

6085
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:05,830
you know matching and auctions and all
that uh those are real principles and

6086
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:05,840
that uh those are real principles and
 

6087
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:07,510
that uh those are real principles and
they lead to a form of intelligence

6088
01:33:07,510 --> 01:33:07,520
they lead to a form of intelligence
 

6089
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:09,350
they lead to a form of intelligence
that's not maybe human intelligence it's

6090
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:09,360
that's not maybe human intelligence it's
 

6091
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:11,189
that's not maybe human intelligence it's
arguably another kind of intelligence

6092
01:33:11,189 --> 01:33:11,199
arguably another kind of intelligence
 

6093
01:33:11,199 --> 01:33:12,790
arguably another kind of intelligence
there probably are third kinds of

6094
01:33:12,790 --> 01:33:12,800
there probably are third kinds of
 

6095
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,310
there probably are third kinds of
intelligence or fourth that none of us

6096
01:33:14,310 --> 01:33:14,320
intelligence or fourth that none of us
 

6097
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:15,510
intelligence or fourth that none of us
are really thinking too much about right

6098
01:33:15,510 --> 01:33:15,520
are really thinking too much about right
 

6099
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:16,310
are really thinking too much about right
now

6100
01:33:16,310 --> 01:33:16,320
now
 

6101
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:17,990
now
so if you really and then all those are

6102
01:33:17,990 --> 01:33:18,000
so if you really and then all those are
 

6103
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,669
so if you really and then all those are
relevant to computer systems in the

6104
01:33:19,669 --> 01:33:19,679
relevant to computer systems in the
 

6105
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:21,990
relevant to computer systems in the
future certainly the market one is

6106
01:33:21,990 --> 01:33:22,000
future certainly the market one is
 

6107
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,470
future certainly the market one is
relevant right now whereas understand

6108
01:33:24,470 --> 01:33:24,480
relevant right now whereas understand
 

6109
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:26,149
relevant right now whereas understand
human intelligence is not so clear that

6110
01:33:26,149 --> 01:33:26,159
human intelligence is not so clear that
 

6111
01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:28,310
human intelligence is not so clear that
it's relevant right now probably not

6112
01:33:28,310 --> 01:33:28,320
it's relevant right now probably not
 

6113
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:30,790
it's relevant right now probably not
um so if you want general intelligence

6114
01:33:30,790 --> 01:33:30,800
um so if you want general intelligence
 

6115
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:32,550
um so if you want general intelligence
whatever one means by that or you know

6116
01:33:32,550 --> 01:33:32,560
whatever one means by that or you know
 

6117
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:33,910
whatever one means by that or you know
understand the intelligence in a deep

6118
01:33:33,910 --> 01:33:33,920
understand the intelligence in a deep
 

6119
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:35,990
understand the intelligence in a deep
sense and all that it is definitely has

6120
01:33:35,990 --> 01:33:36,000
sense and all that it is definitely has
 

6121
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,510
sense and all that it is definitely has
to be not just human intelligence it's

6122
01:33:37,510 --> 01:33:37,520
to be not just human intelligence it's
 

6123
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:39,350
to be not just human intelligence it's
got to be this broader thing and that's

6124
01:33:39,350 --> 01:33:39,360
got to be this broader thing and that's
 

6125
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:41,990
got to be this broader thing and that's
not a mystery markets are intelligent so

6126
01:33:41,990 --> 01:33:42,000
not a mystery markets are intelligent so
 

6127
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:42,790
not a mystery markets are intelligent so
you know

6128
01:33:42,790 --> 01:33:42,800
you know
 

6129
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:43,990
you know
it's definitely not just a philosophical

6130
01:33:43,990 --> 01:33:44,000
it's definitely not just a philosophical
 

6131
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,030
it's definitely not just a philosophical
stance to say we gotta move beyond and

6132
01:33:45,030 --> 01:33:45,040
stance to say we gotta move beyond and
 

6133
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:46,149
stance to say we gotta move beyond and
tell who intelligence that sounds

6134
01:33:46,149 --> 01:33:46,159
tell who intelligence that sounds
 

6135
01:33:46,159 --> 01:33:48,790
tell who intelligence that sounds
ridiculous yeah but it's not and in that

6136
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:48,800
ridiculous yeah but it's not and in that
 

6137

organism do you think the intelligence

6150
01:34:03,830 --> 01:34:03,840
organism do you think the intelligence
 

6151
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,990
organism do you think the intelligence
of that organism when you think from the

of that organism when you think from the

intelligence infrastructure is
 

6157
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:10,709
intelligence infrastructure is
increasing

increasing
 

6159
01:34:10,719 --> 01:34:12,470

is it increasing linearly is it

01:34:12,470 --> 01:34:12,480
is it increasing linearly is it
 

6161
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,310
is it increasing linearly is it
increasing exponentially what do you

6162
01:34:14,310 --> 01:34:14,320
increasing exponentially what do you
 

6163
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:16,149
increasing exponentially what do you
think the future of that intelligence i

6164
01:34:16,149 --> 01:34:16,159
think the future of that intelligence i
 

6165
01:34:16,159 --> 01:34:17,990
think the future of that intelligence i
don't know i don't tend to think i don't

6166
01:34:17,990 --> 01:34:18,000
don't know i don't tend to think i don't

tend to answer questions like that

6168
01:34:19,590 --> 01:34:19,600
tend to answer questions like that
 

6169
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:21,270
tend to answer questions like that
because you know that's science fiction

6170
01:34:21,270 --> 01:34:21,280
because you know that's science fiction
 

6171
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:24,950
because you know that's science fiction
hoping to catch you off guard

6173
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:27,350

well again because you said it's so far

01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:30,310
well again because you said it's so far
in the future it's fun to ask and you'll

6176
01:34:30,310 --> 01:34:30,320
in the future it's fun to ask and you'll
 

6177
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:32,950
in the future it's fun to ask and you'll
probably you know like you said

6178
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:32,960
probably you know like you said
 

6179
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:35,189
probably you know like you said
predicting the future is really nearly

6180
01:34:35,189 --> 01:34:35,199
predicting the future is really nearly
 

6181
01:34:35,199 --> 01:34:37,030
predicting the future is really nearly
impossible but

6182
01:34:37,030 --> 01:34:37,040
impossible but
 

6183
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:37,830
impossible but
say

6184
01:34:37,830 --> 01:34:37,840
say
 

6185
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:40,870
say
as an axiom one day we create

6186
01:34:40,870 --> 01:34:40,880
as an axiom one day we create
 

6187
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:42,709
as an axiom one day we create
a human level superhuman level

intelligent not the scale of markets but
 

6191
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:47,270
intelligent not the scale of markets but
the scale of an individual

6192
01:34:47,270 --> 01:34:47,280
the scale of an individual
 

6193
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:49,109
the scale of an individual
what do you think is

6194
01:34:49,109 --> 01:34:49,119
what do you think is
 

6195
01:34:49,119 --> 01:34:49,990
what do you think is
is

6196
01:34:49,990 --> 01:34:50,000
is
 

6197
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,270
is
what do you think it would take to do

6198
01:34:51,270 --> 01:34:51,280
what do you think it would take to do
 

6199
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:53,669
what do you think it would take to do
that or maybe to ask another question

6200
01:34:53,669 --> 01:34:53,679
that or maybe to ask another question
 

6201
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:56,709
that or maybe to ask another question
is how would that system be different

6202
01:34:56,709 --> 01:34:56,719
is how would that system be different
 

6203
01:34:56,719 --> 01:34:58,870
is how would that system be different
than the biological

6204
01:34:58,870 --> 01:34:58,880
than the biological
 

6205
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:01,270
than the biological
human beings that we see around us today

6206
01:35:01,270 --> 01:35:01,280
human beings that we see around us today
 

6207
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:02,950
human beings that we see around us today
is it possible to say anything

6208
01:35:02,950 --> 01:35:02,960
is it possible to say anything
 

6209
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:04,390
is it possible to say anything
interesting to that question or is it

6210
01:35:04,390 --> 01:35:04,400
interesting to that question or is it
 

6211
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:06,550
interesting to that question or is it
just a stupid question it's not stupid

6212
01:35:06,550 --> 01:35:06,560
just a stupid question it's not stupid
 

6213
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:08,149
just a stupid question it's not stupid
question but it's science fiction

6214
01:35:08,149 --> 01:35:08,159
question but it's science fiction
 

6215
01:35:08,159 --> 01:35:10,229
question but it's science fiction
science fiction and so i'm totally happy

6216
01:35:10,229 --> 01:35:10,239
science fiction and so i'm totally happy
 

6217
01:35:10,239 --> 01:35:11,669
science fiction and so i'm totally happy
to read science fiction and think about

6218
01:35:11,669 --> 01:35:11,679
to read science fiction and think about
 

6219
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:13,350
to read science fiction and think about
it from time my own life

6220
01:35:13,350 --> 01:35:13,360
it from time my own life
 

6221
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:15,510
it from time my own life
i loved there was this like brain in a

6222
01:35:15,510 --> 01:35:15,520
i loved there was this like brain in a
 

6223
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:17,030
i loved there was this like brain in a
vat kind of you know little thing that

6224
01:35:17,030 --> 01:35:17,040
vat kind of you know little thing that
 

6225
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:18,470
vat kind of you know little thing that
people were talking about when i was a

6226
01:35:18,470 --> 01:35:18,480
people were talking about when i was a
 

6227
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:20,709
people were talking about when i was a
student i remember you know imagine that

6228
01:35:20,709 --> 01:35:20,719
student i remember you know imagine that
 

6229
01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:21,590
student i remember you know imagine that
uh

6230
01:35:21,590 --> 01:35:21,600
uh
 

6231
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,830
uh
um you know between your brain and your

6232
01:35:23,830 --> 01:35:23,840
um you know between your brain and your
 

6233
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:25,109
um you know between your brain and your
body there's you know there's a bunch of

6234
01:35:25,109 --> 01:35:25,119
body there's you know there's a bunch of
 

6235
01:35:25,119 --> 01:35:26,629
body there's you know there's a bunch of
wires right

6236
01:35:26,629 --> 01:35:26,639
wires right
 

6237
01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:28,070
wires right
and suppose that every one of them was

6238
01:35:28,070 --> 01:35:28,080
and suppose that every one of them was
 

6239
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:29,510
and suppose that every one of them was
replaced with a

6240
01:35:29,510 --> 01:35:29,520
replaced with a
 

6241
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:31,990
replaced with a
uh uh literal wire and then suppose that

6242
01:35:31,990 --> 01:35:32,000
uh uh literal wire and then suppose that
 

6243
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,030
uh uh literal wire and then suppose that
wire was turning actually a little

6244
01:35:33,030 --> 01:35:33,040
wire was turning actually a little
 

6245
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:35,109
wire was turning actually a little
wireless you know there's a receiver and

6246
01:35:35,109 --> 01:35:35,119
wireless you know there's a receiver and
 

6247
01:35:35,119 --> 01:35:36,950
wireless you know there's a receiver and
sender so the brain has got all the

6248
01:35:36,950 --> 01:35:36,960
sender so the brain has got all the
 

6249
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:39,270
sender so the brain has got all the
senders and receiver you know on all of

6250
01:35:39,270 --> 01:35:39,280
senders and receiver you know on all of
 

6251
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:42,550
senders and receiver you know on all of
its exiting uh you know axons and all

6252
01:35:42,550 --> 01:35:42,560
its exiting uh you know axons and all
 

6253
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:44,070
its exiting uh you know axons and all
the dendrites down the body have

6254
01:35:44,070 --> 01:35:44,080
the dendrites down the body have
 

6255
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:45,990
the dendrites down the body have
replaced with syndrome receivers now you

6256
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:46,000
replaced with syndrome receivers now you
 

6257
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,510
replaced with syndrome receivers now you
could move the body off somewhere and

6258
01:35:47,510 --> 01:35:47,520
could move the body off somewhere and
 

6259
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:49,109
could move the body off somewhere and
put the brain in a vat

6260
01:35:49,109 --> 01:35:49,119
put the brain in a vat
 

6261
01:35:49,119 --> 01:35:50,629
put the brain in a vat
right and

6262
01:35:50,629 --> 01:35:50,639
right and
 

6263
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:51,910
right and
then you could do things like start

6264
01:35:51,910 --> 01:35:51,920
then you could do things like start
 

6265
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:53,189
then you could do things like start
killing off those centers of receivers

6266
01:35:53,189 --> 01:35:53,199
killing off those centers of receivers
 

6267
01:35:53,199 --> 01:35:55,189
killing off those centers of receivers
one by one and after you've killed off

6268
01:35:55,189 --> 01:35:55,199
one by one and after you've killed off
 

6269
01:35:55,199 --> 01:35:56,870
one by one and after you've killed off
all of them where is that person you

6270
01:35:56,870 --> 01:35:56,880
all of them where is that person you
 

6271
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:57,910
all of them where is that person you
know they thought they were out in the

6272
01:35:57,910 --> 01:35:57,920
know they thought they were out in the
 

6273
01:35:57,920 --> 01:35:59,350
know they thought they were out in the
body walking around the world and they

6274
01:35:59,350 --> 01:35:59,360
body walking around the world and they
 

6275
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:00,629
body walking around the world and they
moved on so those are science fiction

6276
01:36:00,629 --> 01:36:00,639
moved on so those are science fiction
 

6277
01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:02,070
moved on so those are science fiction
things those are fun to think about it's

6278
01:36:02,070 --> 01:36:02,080
things those are fun to think about it's
 

6279
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:03,590
things those are fun to think about it's
just intriguing about where's what is

6280
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:03,600
just intriguing about where's what is
 

6281
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:05,350
just intriguing about where's what is
thought where is it and all that

6282
01:36:05,350 --> 01:36:05,360
thought where is it and all that
 

6283
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:06,550
thought where is it and all that
and

6284
01:36:06,550 --> 01:36:06,560
and
 

6285
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:08,390
and
i think every 18 year old it's to take

6286
01:36:08,390 --> 01:36:08,400
i think every 18 year old it's to take
 

6287
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:09,750
i think every 18 year old it's to take
philosophy classes and think about these

6288
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:09,760
philosophy classes and think about these
 

6289
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:10,390
philosophy classes and think about these
things

6290
01:36:10,390 --> 01:36:10,400
things
 

6291
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:11,430
things
and i think that everyone should think

6292
01:36:11,430 --> 01:36:11,440
and i think that everyone should think
 

6293
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:12,950
and i think that everyone should think
about what could happen in society

6294
01:36:12,950 --> 01:36:12,960
about what could happen in society
 

6295
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:14,310
about what could happen in society
that's kind of bad and all that but i

6296
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:14,320
that's kind of bad and all that but i
 

6297
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:15,510
that's kind of bad and all that but i
really don't think that's the right

6298
01:36:15,510 --> 01:36:15,520
really don't think that's the right
 

6299
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:17,350
really don't think that's the right
thing for most of us that are my age

6300
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:17,360
thing for most of us that are my age
 

6301
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:19,350
thing for most of us that are my age
group to be doing and thinking about

6302
01:36:19,350 --> 01:36:19,360
group to be doing and thinking about
 

6303
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:22,149

i really think that we have so many more

6304
01:36:22,149 --> 01:36:22,159

language there
 

6379
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:35,430
language there
uh it is not that you're so brilliant

6380
01:37:35,430 --> 01:37:35,440
uh it is not that you're so brilliant
 

6381
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:36,709
uh it is not that you're so brilliant
and you have great brilliant ideas and

and you have great brilliant ideas and
 

6383
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:38,629
and you have great brilliant ideas and
therefore that's that's just you know

6384
01:37:38,629 --> 01:37:38,639
therefore that's that's just you know
 

6385

therefore that's that's just you know
that's how you have success or that's

that's how you have success or that's
 

6387
01:37:40,159 --> 01:37:42,390
that's how you have success or that's
how you enter into the field uh it's

6388
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:42,400
how you enter into the field uh it's
 

6389
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,629
how you enter into the field uh it's
that you apprentice yourself you you

6390
01:37:44,629 --> 01:37:44,639
that you apprentice yourself you you
 

6391
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:46,310
that you apprentice yourself you you
spend a lot of time you work on hard

6392
01:37:46,310 --> 01:37:46,320
spend a lot of time you work on hard
 

6393
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:48,229
spend a lot of time you work on hard
things you

6394
01:37:48,229 --> 01:37:48,239
things you
 

6395
01:37:48,239 --> 01:37:51,109
things you
try and pull back and you be as broad as

6396
01:37:51,109 --> 01:37:51,119
try and pull back and you be as broad as
 

6397
01:37:51,119 --> 01:37:53,590
try and pull back and you be as broad as
you can you talk lots of people um

6398
01:37:53,590 --> 01:37:53,600
you can you talk lots of people um
 

6399
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:55,750
you can you talk lots of people um
and it's like entering any kind of a

6400
01:37:55,750 --> 01:37:55,760
and it's like entering any kind of a
 

6401
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:57,990
and it's like entering any kind of a
creative community there's um

6402
01:37:57,990 --> 01:37:58,000
creative community there's um
 

6403
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,229
creative community there's um
years that are needed and uh human

6404
01:38:00,229 --> 01:38:00,239
years that are needed and uh human
 

6405
01:38:00,239 --> 01:38:01,669
years that are needed and uh human
connections are critical to it so you

6406
01:38:01,669 --> 01:38:01,679
connections are critical to it so you
 

6407
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:03,990
connections are critical to it so you
know i think about you know being a

6408
01:38:03,990 --> 01:38:04,000
know i think about you know being a
 

6409
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,910
know i think about you know being a
musician or being an artist or something

6410
01:38:05,910 --> 01:38:05,920
musician or being an artist or something
 

6411
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:07,750
musician or being an artist or something
you don't just you know immediately from

6412
01:38:07,750 --> 01:38:07,760
you don't just you know immediately from
 

6413
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:10,229
you don't just you know immediately from
day one you know you you're a genius and

6414
01:38:10,229 --> 01:38:10,239
day one you know you you're a genius and
 

6415
01:38:10,239 --> 01:38:11,990
day one you know you you're a genius and
therefore you do it no you

6416
01:38:11,990 --> 01:38:12,000
therefore you do it no you
 

6417
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:12,950
therefore you do it no you
um

6418
01:38:12,950 --> 01:38:12,960
um
 

6419
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:13,830
um
you know

6420
01:38:13,830 --> 01:38:13,840
you know
 

6421
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:16,149
you know
practice really really hard on basics

6422
01:38:16,149 --> 01:38:16,159
practice really really hard on basics
 

6423
01:38:16,159 --> 01:38:19,430
practice really really hard on basics
and you uh be humble about where you are

6424
01:38:19,430 --> 01:38:19,440
and you uh be humble about where you are
 

6425
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:21,109
and you uh be humble about where you are
and then and you realize you'll never be

6426
01:38:21,109 --> 01:38:21,119
and then and you realize you'll never be
 

6427
01:38:21,119 --> 01:38:22,790
and then and you realize you'll never be
an expert on everything so you kind of

6428
01:38:22,790 --> 01:38:22,800
an expert on everything so you kind of
 

6429
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:24,550
an expert on everything so you kind of
pick and there's a lot of randomness and

6430
01:38:24,550 --> 01:38:24,560
pick and there's a lot of randomness and
 

6431
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:26,870
pick and there's a lot of randomness and
a lot of kind of

6432
01:38:26,870 --> 01:38:26,880
a lot of kind of
 

6433
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:28,870
a lot of kind of
luck but

6434
01:38:28,870 --> 01:38:28,880
luck but
 

6435
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:30,229
luck but
luck just kind of picks out which branch

6436
01:38:30,229 --> 01:38:30,239
luck just kind of picks out which branch
 

6437
01:38:30,239 --> 01:38:31,590
luck just kind of picks out which branch
of the tree go down but you'll go down

6438
01:38:31,590 --> 01:38:31,600
of the tree go down but you'll go down
 

6439
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:32,790
of the tree go down but you'll go down
some branch

6440
01:38:32,790 --> 01:38:32,800
some branch
 

6441
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:33,750
some branch
um

6442
01:38:33,750 --> 01:38:33,760
um
 

6443
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:35,750
um
so yeah it's it's a community so the

6444
01:38:35,750 --> 01:38:35,760
so yeah it's it's a community so the
 

6445
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:37,590
so yeah it's it's a community so the
graduate school is i still think is one

6446
01:38:37,590 --> 01:38:37,600
graduate school is i still think is one
 

6447
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:39,109
graduate school is i still think is one
of the wonderful phenomena that we have

6448
01:38:39,109 --> 01:38:39,119
of the wonderful phenomena that we have
 

6449
01:38:39,119 --> 01:38:41,270
of the wonderful phenomena that we have
in our in our world it's it's very much

6450
01:38:41,270 --> 01:38:41,280
in our in our world it's it's very much
 

6451
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,950
in our in our world it's it's very much
about apprenticeship with an advisor

6452
01:38:42,950 --> 01:38:42,960
about apprenticeship with an advisor
 

6453
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:44,390
about apprenticeship with an advisor
it's very much about a group of people

6454
01:38:44,390 --> 01:38:44,400
it's very much about a group of people
 

6455
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,510
it's very much about a group of people
you belong to

6456
01:38:45,510 --> 01:38:45,520
you belong to
 

6457
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:47,109
you belong to
it's a four or five year process so it's

6458
01:38:47,109 --> 01:38:47,119
it's a four or five year process so it's
 

6459
01:38:47,119 --> 01:38:48,470
it's a four or five year process so it's
plenty of time

6460
01:38:48,470 --> 01:38:48,480
plenty of time
 

6461
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:50,470
plenty of time
to start from kind of nothing to come up

6462
01:38:50,470 --> 01:38:50,480
to start from kind of nothing to come up
 

6463
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:52,470
to start from kind of nothing to come up
to something you know more expertise and

6464
01:38:52,470 --> 01:38:52,480
to something you know more expertise and
 

6465
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:53,669
to something you know more expertise and
then start to have your own creativity

6466
01:38:53,669 --> 01:38:53,679
then start to have your own creativity
 

6467
01:38:53,679 --> 01:38:55,510
then start to have your own creativity
start to flower even surprise into your

6468
01:38:55,510 --> 01:38:55,520
start to flower even surprise into your
 

6469
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:56,830
start to flower even surprise into your
own self

6470
01:38:56,830 --> 01:38:56,840
own self
 

6471
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:59,510
own self
um and it's a very cooperative endeavor

6472
01:38:59,510 --> 01:38:59,520
um and it's a very cooperative endeavor
 

6473
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:03,350
um and it's a very cooperative endeavor
it's i think a lot of people uh think of

6474
01:39:03,350 --> 01:39:03,360
it's i think a lot of people uh think of
 

6475
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:04,950
it's i think a lot of people uh think of
science as highly competitive and i

6476
01:39:04,950 --> 01:39:04,960
science as highly competitive and i
 

6477
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:06,390
science as highly competitive and i
think in some other fields it might be

6478
01:39:06,390 --> 01:39:06,400
think in some other fields it might be
 

6479
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:07,830
think in some other fields it might be
more so

6480
01:39:07,830 --> 01:39:07,840
more so
 

6481
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:09,189
more so
here it's way more cooperative than you

6482
01:39:09,189 --> 01:39:09,199
here it's way more cooperative than you
 

6483
01:39:09,199 --> 01:39:11,430
here it's way more cooperative than you
might imagine

6484
01:39:11,430 --> 01:39:11,440
might imagine
 

6485
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:12,790
might imagine
and people are always teaching each

6486
01:39:12,790 --> 01:39:12,800
and people are always teaching each
 

6487
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:14,310
and people are always teaching each
other something and people are always

6488
01:39:14,310 --> 01:39:14,320
other something and people are always
 

6489
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:16,950
other something and people are always
more than happy to uh be clear that so i

6490
01:39:16,950 --> 01:39:16,960
more than happy to uh be clear that so i
 

6491
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:18,550
more than happy to uh be clear that so i
i feel i'm an expert on certain kind of

6492
01:39:18,550 --> 01:39:18,560
i feel i'm an expert on certain kind of
 

6493

6500
01:39:24,950 --> 01:39:24,960

i you know you don't so

6502
01:39:27,030 --> 01:39:27,040
i you know you don't so

um i'm always willing to reveal my
 

6505
01:39:29,119 --> 01:39:30,390
um i'm always willing to reveal my
ignorance to people around me so they

6506
01:39:30,390 --> 01:39:30,400
ignorance to people around me so they
 

6507
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:31,750
ignorance to people around me so they
can teach me things

and uh i think a lot of us feel that way
 

6511
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:35,430
and uh i think a lot of us feel that way
about our field so it's very cooperative

6512
01:39:35,430 --> 01:39:35,440
about our field so it's very cooperative
 

6513
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:37,030
about our field so it's very cooperative
uh i might add it's also very

6514
01:39:37,030 --> 01:39:37,040
uh i might add it's also very
 

6515
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:38,310
uh i might add it's also very
international because it's so

6516
01:39:38,310 --> 01:39:38,320
international because it's so
 

6517
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:41,669
international because it's so
cooperative we see no barriers and uh so

6518
01:39:41,669 --> 01:39:41,679
cooperative we see no barriers and uh so
 

6519
01:39:41,679 --> 01:39:43,109
cooperative we see no barriers and uh so
that the nationalism that you see

6520
01:39:43,109 --> 01:39:43,119
that the nationalism that you see
 

6521
01:39:43,119 --> 01:39:44,149
that the nationalism that you see
especially in the current era and

6523
01:39:44,159 --> 01:39:45,910
especially in the current era and
everything is just at odds with the way

01:39:45,910 --> 01:39:45,920
everything is just at odds with the way
 

6525
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:47,270
everything is just at odds with the way
that most of us think about what we're

that most of us think about what we're
doing here where this is a human

6528
01:39:49,030 --> 01:39:49,040
doing here where this is a human
 

6529
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:51,109
doing here where this is a human
endeavor and we we cooperate

yeah learning language is a big part of
 

6735
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:57,830
yeah learning language is a big part of
that i think i've said in some interview

6736
01:42:57,830 --> 01:42:57,840
that i think i've said in some interview
 

6737
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:59,350
that i think i've said in some interview
at some point that if i had you know

6738
01:42:59,350 --> 01:42:59,360
at some point that if i had you know
 

6739
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:00,950
at some point that if i had you know
millions of dollars on the infinite time

6740
01:43:00,950 --> 01:43:00,960
millions of dollars on the infinite time
 

6741
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:02,390
millions of dollars on the infinite time
whatever what would you really work on

6742
01:43:02,390 --> 01:43:02,400
whatever what would you really work on
 

6743
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:03,910
whatever what would you really work on
if you really wanted to do ai and for me

6744
01:43:03,910 --> 01:43:03,920
if you really wanted to do ai and for me
 

6745
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:06,149
if you really wanted to do ai and for me
that is natural language and really done

6746
01:43:06,149 --> 01:43:06,159
that is natural language and really done
 

6747
01:43:06,159 --> 01:43:08,149
that is natural language and really done
right you know deep understanding of

6748
01:43:08,149 --> 01:43:08,159
right you know deep understanding of
 

6749
01:43:08,159 --> 01:43:11,030
right you know deep understanding of
language um that's to me an amazingly

6750
01:43:11,030 --> 01:43:11,040
language um that's to me an amazingly
 

6751
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:13,350
language um that's to me an amazingly
interesting scientific challenge and uh

6752
01:43:13,350 --> 01:43:13,360
interesting scientific challenge and uh
 

6753
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:15,590
interesting scientific challenge and uh
when we're very far away one we're very

6754
01:43:15,590 --> 01:43:15,600
when we're very far away one we're very
 

6755
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:17,430
when we're very far away one we're very
far away but good natural language

6756
01:43:17,430 --> 01:43:17,440
far away but good natural language
 

6757
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:19,109
far away but good natural language
people are kind of really invested then

6758
01:43:19,109 --> 01:43:19,119
people are kind of really invested then
 

6759
01:43:19,119 --> 01:43:20,390
people are kind of really invested then
i think a lot of them see that's where

6760
01:43:20,390 --> 01:43:20,400
i think a lot of them see that's where
 

6761
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:22,229
i think a lot of them see that's where
the core of ai is that if you understand

6762
01:43:22,229 --> 01:43:22,239
the core of ai is that if you understand
 

6763
01:43:22,239 --> 01:43:24,310
the core of ai is that if you understand
that you really help human communication

6764
01:43:24,310 --> 01:43:24,320
that you really help human communication
 

6765
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:25,750
that you really help human communication
you understand something about the human

6766
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:25,760
you understand something about the human
 

6767
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:27,109
you understand something about the human
mind the semantics that come out of the

6768
01:43:27,109 --> 01:43:27,119
mind the semantics that come out of the
 

6769
01:43:27,119 --> 01:43:29,990
mind the semantics that come out of the
human mind and i agree i think that will

6770
01:43:29,990 --> 01:43:30,000
human mind and i agree i think that will
 

6771
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,669
human mind and i agree i think that will
be such a long time so i didn't do that

6772
01:43:31,669 --> 01:43:31,679
be such a long time so i didn't do that
 

6773
01:43:31,679 --> 01:43:33,350
be such a long time so i didn't do that
in my career just because i kind of i

6774
01:43:33,350 --> 01:43:33,360
in my career just because i kind of i
 

6775
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:34,950
in my career just because i kind of i
was behind in the early days i didn't

6776
01:43:34,950 --> 01:43:34,960
was behind in the early days i didn't
 

6777
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:36,790
was behind in the early days i didn't
kind of know enough of that stuff i was

6778
01:43:36,790 --> 01:43:36,800
kind of know enough of that stuff i was
 

6779
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:38,390
kind of know enough of that stuff i was
at mit i didn't learn much

6780
01:43:38,390 --> 01:43:38,400
at mit i didn't learn much
 

6781
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:39,669
at mit i didn't learn much
language

6782
01:43:39,669 --> 01:43:39,679
language
 

6783
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:40,950
language
and it was too late at some point to

6784
01:43:40,950 --> 01:43:40,960
and it was too late at some point to
 

6785
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:42,790
and it was too late at some point to
kind of spend a whole career doing that

6786
01:43:42,790 --> 01:43:42,800
kind of spend a whole career doing that
 

6787
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:45,430
kind of spend a whole career doing that
but i admire that field and uh

6788
01:43:45,430 --> 01:43:45,440
but i admire that field and uh
 

6789
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:46,310
but i admire that field and uh
um

6790

um
and so in my little way by learning

6792
01:43:47,669 --> 01:43:47,679
and so in my little way by learning
 

6793
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:50,310
and so in my little way by learning
language you know kind of

6794
01:43:50,310 --> 01:43:50,320
language you know kind of
 

6795
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:52,229
language you know kind of
that part of my brain has um has been

6796

davis and machine learning i don't think

6802
01:43:57,830 --> 01:43:57,840
davis and machine learning i don't think
 

6803
