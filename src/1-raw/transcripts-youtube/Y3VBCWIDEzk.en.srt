00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,670
silicon chips against nuclear war
so he becomes part of the nuclear war

508
00:09:59,670 --> 00:09:59,680
so he becomes part of the nuclear war
 

509
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,550
so he becomes part of the nuclear war
protection defense apparatus even though

510
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:02,560
protection defense apparatus even though
 

511
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,590
protection defense apparatus even though
he wanted to work on alternative energy

512
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:05,600
he wanted to work on alternative energy
 

513
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,990
he wanted to work on alternative energy
doing very similar work with silicon

514
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,000
doing very similar work with silicon
 

515
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,630
doing very similar work with silicon
chips but in a different framework and

516
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:10,640
chips but in a different framework and
 

517
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,550
chips but in a different framework and
so

518
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:12,560
so
 

519
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,790
so
the practice of science often gets

520
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:14,800
the practice of science often gets
 

521
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,230
the practice of science often gets
pushed into and is is woven into

522
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,240
pushed into and is is woven into
 

523
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,710
pushed into and is is woven into
ideological practices and sort of in the

524
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:20,720
ideological practices and sort of in the
 

525
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,949
ideological practices and sort of in the
same way that you get beautiful

526
00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:22,959
same way that you get beautiful
 

527
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,750
same way that you get beautiful
um medieval cathedrals built

528
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:25,760

uh in service of of catholicism

530
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:29,279
uh in service of of catholicism
 

531
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,509
uh in service of of catholicism
well what's in the mind of an individual

532
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:31,519
well what's in the mind of an individual
 

533
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,829
well what's in the mind of an individual
scientist so this this process of

534
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:33,839
scientist so this this process of
 

535
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,389
scientist so this this process of
ideology polluting science or is it

536
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:36,399
ideology polluting science or is it
 

537
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,110
ideology polluting science or is it
science empowering ideology

538
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,120
science empowering ideology
 

539
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,030
science empowering ideology
so

540
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,040
so
 

541
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,110

to know
 

587
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,910
to know
maybe they have ways of of lying to

588
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:29,920
maybe they have ways of of lying to
 

589
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,550
maybe they have ways of of lying to
themselves

themselves
 

591
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,590

maybe they are the one person who agreed

592
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:35,600
maybe they are the one person who agreed
 

593
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,069
maybe they are the one person who agreed
to do it in

594
00:11:37,069 --> 00:11:37,079
to do it in

99 refused
 

597
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,590
99 refused
so you know it's

598
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:43,600
so you know it's
 

599
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,190
so you know it's
hard if not impossible to know what's in

it's not hard
 

611
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,269
it's not hard
to find people willing to fill that in

612
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:01,279
to find people willing to fill that in
 

613
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,990
to find people willing to fill that in
especially if they're narrow technocrats

614

especially if they're narrow technocrats
 

615
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,670
especially if they're narrow technocrats
you know if they're just doing their job

616
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:05,680
you know if they're just doing their job
 

617
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,389
you know if they're just doing their job
if they're just building the widget

618
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:08,399
if they're just building the widget
 

619
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,470
if they're just building the widget
and i think a lot of

620
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:10,480
and i think a lot of
 

621
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,790
and i think a lot of
scientific training is in widget widget

622
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:12,800
scientific training is in widget widget
 

623
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,350
scientific training is in widget widget
building and that leads to the

624
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:15,360
building and that leads to the
 

625
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,590
building and that leads to the
possibility that they can become easily

626
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:17,600
possibility that they can become easily
 

627
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,269
possibility that they can become easily
instrumentalized

628
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:19,279
instrumentalized
 

629
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,750
instrumentalized
in a particular

00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:21,760
in a particular
 

631
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,310
in a particular
in a particular action which is maybe

632
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:24,320
in a particular action which is maybe
 

633
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,590
in a particular action which is maybe
horrific or or glorious

634
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:27,600
horrific or or glorious
 

635
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,790
horrific or or glorious
the other thing to keep in mind is that

636
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:30,800
the other thing to keep in mind is that
 

637
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,710
the other thing to keep in mind is that
sciences as we say what scientists do

638
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:34,720
sciences as we say what scientists do
 

639
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,910
sciences as we say what scientists do
and

640
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:35,920
and
 

641
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,829
and
that can include a lot of things that

642
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:37,839
that can include a lot of things that
 

643
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,310
that can include a lot of things that
can exclude a lot of things

644
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:40,320
can exclude a lot of things
 

645
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,230
can exclude a lot of things
the word science itself is interesting

646
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:42,240
the word science itself is interesting
 

647
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,629
the word science itself is interesting
because it's cognate it actually comes

648
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:44,639
because it's cognate it actually comes
 

649
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,829
because it's cognate it actually comes
originally from the proto-indo-european

650
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:47,839
originally from the proto-indo-european
 

651
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,110
originally from the proto-indo-european
uh

652
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,120
uh
 

653
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,509
uh
skein meaning to cut

654
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:51,519
skein meaning to cut
 

655
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,110
skein meaning to cut
or divide

656
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:53,120
or divide
 

657
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,190
or divide
and so it's cognate with

658
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:55,200
and so it's cognate with
 

659
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,470
and so it's cognate with
scissors

660
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:56,480
scissors
 

661
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,470
scissors
schism

662
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:58,480
schism
 

663
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,870
schism
skin skin is that which divides you from

664
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:00,880
skin skin is that which divides you from
 

665
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,269
skin skin is that which divides you from
the world shit or scat is that which has

666
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:03,279
the world shit or scat is that which has
 

667
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,430
the world shit or scat is that which has
been divided from you

668
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:05,440
been divided from you
 

669
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,790
been divided from you
into the world

into the world
 

671
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,430
into the world
and so there's this cognate uh between

672
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:09,440
and so there's this cognate uh between
 

673
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,150
and so there's this cognate uh between
science and shit or science and cutting

674
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,160

with the whole idea being that you're

676
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:13,600
with the whole idea being that you're
 

677
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,470
with the whole idea being that you're
dividing into parts classifying it's the

678
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:16,480
dividing into parts classifying it's the
 

679
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,269
dividing into parts classifying it's the
taxonomic impulse

680
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:19,279
taxonomic impulse
 

681
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,389
taxonomic impulse
and

682
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:20,399
and
 

683
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,230
and
to know is to know where something

684
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:22,240
to know is to know where something
 

685
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,550
to know is to know where something
belongs to divide it into its parts and

686
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:24,560
belongs to divide it into its parts and
 

687
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,030
belongs to divide it into its parts and
put it in its proper place

688
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,040
put it in its proper place
 

689
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,509
put it in its proper place
and that taxonomic impulse can be very

690
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:29,519
and that taxonomic impulse can be very
 

691
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,949
and that taxonomic impulse can be very
static

692
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:30,959
static
 

693
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,230
static
it's actually one of the things that

694
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:32,240
it's actually one of the things that
 

695
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,030
it's actually one of the things that
darwin had to overcome in recognizing

696
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,040
darwin had to overcome in recognizing
 

697
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,350
darwin had to overcome in recognizing
evolution that the taxonomies are in

698
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:37,360
evolution that the taxonomies are in
 

699
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,710
evolution that the taxonomies are in
motion

700
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:38,720
motion
 

701
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,829
motion
um

702
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:39,839
um
 

703
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,910
um
but it also can lead to a kind of myopia

704
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:41,920
but it also can lead to a kind of myopia
 

705
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,990
but it also can lead to a kind of myopia
that my job is done when i've classified

706
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,000
that my job is done when i've classified
 

707
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,030
that my job is done when i've classified
something is is is this bird an x a y or

something is is is this bird an x a y or
 

709
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,350
something is is is this bird an x a y or
a z and

710
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:49,360
a z and
 

711
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,110
a z and
that again can be

712
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,120
that again can be
 

713
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,189
that again can be
it can be ideological or it cannot be

714
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:53,199
it can be ideological or it cannot be
 

715
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,069
it can be ideological or it cannot be
but

716
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:54,079
but
 

717
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,470
but
scientists are humans humans and they're

718
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:56,480
scientists are humans humans and they're
 

719
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,629
scientists are humans humans and they're
fitting in

720
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:58,639
fitting in
 

721
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,670
fitting in
with a world with a world practice

722
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:01,680
with a world with a world practice
 

723
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,150
with a world with a world practice
and that's that's that's limiting it's

724
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,160
and that's that's that's limiting it's
 

725
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,110
and that's that's that's limiting it's
kind of inevitable it's unavoidable it's

726
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:07,120
kind of inevitable it's unavoidable it's
 

727
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,829
kind of inevitable it's unavoidable it's
hard to be if not impossible

728
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:09,839
hard to be if not impossible
 

729
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,430
hard to be if not impossible
out of the world

730
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:11,440
out of the world
 

731
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,430
out of the world
that we're that we're walking in

yeah and it's fascinating because i

00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:14,480
yeah and it's fascinating because i
 

735
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,550
yeah and it's fascinating because i
think ideologies also have an impulse

736
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:16,560
think ideologies also have an impulse
 

737
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,430
think ideologies also have an impulse
towards forming taxonomies and there is

738
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:19,440
towards forming taxonomies and there is
 

739
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,269
towards forming taxonomies and there is
um

740
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:21,279
um
 

741
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,629
um
so just uh so uh being at mit

just basic conversations
 

765
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,110
just basic conversations
and i think this has to do

766
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:47,120
and i think this has to do
 

767
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,590
and i think this has to do
you said scientists are widget builders

768
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:49,600
you said scientists are widget builders
 

769
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,829
you said scientists are widget builders
and taxonomizers

770
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:51,839
and taxonomizers
 

771
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,550
and taxonomizers
i think there's power in somebody

772
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:54,560
i think there's power in somebody
 

773
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,949
i think there's power in somebody
like the nazi regime or like a jeffrey

774
00:14:56,949 --> 00:14:56,959
like the nazi regime or like a jeffrey

like the nazi regime or like a jeffrey
epstein just being excited about your

776
00:14:59,350 --> 00:14:59,360
epstein just being excited about your
 

777
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,550
epstein just being excited about your
widgets

778
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:00,560
widgets
 

779
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,670
widgets
and

780
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:01,680
and
 

781
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,990
and
making you feel like the widget

782
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:04,000
making you feel like the widget
 

783
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,350
making you feel like the widget
serves a greater purpose in the world

784
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:07,360
serves a greater purpose in the world
 

785
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,870
serves a greater purpose in the world
and so it's not like you're um

786
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:10,880
and so it's not like you're um
 

787
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,230
and so it's not like you're um
you know some sometimes people say

788
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:12,240
you know some sometimes people say
 

789
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,110
you know some sometimes people say
scientists want to make money and uh or

790
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:15,120
scientists want to make money and uh or
 

791
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,269
scientists want to make money and uh or
they have a big kind of

792
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:17,279
they have a big kind of
 

793
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,350
they have a big kind of
ideological drive behind it i think

794
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:19,360
ideological drive behind it i think
 

795
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,550
ideological drive behind it i think
there's just

796
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:20,560
there's just
 

797
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,910
there's just
nice one

798
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:21,920
nice one
 

799
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,110
nice one
the widgets you like building anyway

800
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:25,120
the widgets you like building anyway
 

801
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,110
the widgets you like building anyway
somehow somebody convinces you some

802
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,120
somehow somebody convinces you some
 

803
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,150
somehow somebody convinces you some
charismatic person that this widget

804
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,160
charismatic person that this widget
 

805
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,470
charismatic person that this widget
is actually has a grander

806
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:32,480
is actually has a grander
 

807
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,670
is actually has a grander
purpose and you don't almost feel think

808
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:35,680
purpose and you don't almost feel think
 

809
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,069
purpose and you don't almost feel think
about the negative or whether it's

810
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:38,079
about the negative or whether it's
 

811
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,629
about the negative or whether it's
positive just the fact that it's grand

812
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:40,639
positive just the fact that it's grand
 

813
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,189
positive just the fact that it's grand
is already super exciting yeah yeah i

814
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:43,199
is already super exciting yeah yeah i
 

815
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,629
is already super exciting yeah yeah i
think that's right i think that's the

816
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:44,639
think that's right i think that's the
 

817
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,629
think that's right i think that's the
story of vernafun brown

818
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:46,639
story of vernafun brown
 

819
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,230
story of vernafun brown
you know and the fascination with

820
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:48,240
you know and the fascination with
 

821
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,910
you know and the fascination with
rockets and

822
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:49,920
rockets and
 

823
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,189
rockets and
this will

824
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:51,199
this will
 

825
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,269
this will
you know enlarge something in the world

826
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:53,279
you know enlarge something in the world
 

827
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,150
you know enlarge something in the world
and here he is he's an ss officer he's

1187
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,430
the outcomes of our hard work yeah well
it's kind of like the fan the story of

1188
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:33,440
it's kind of like the fan the story of
 

1189
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,270
it's kind of like the fan the story of
the two-thirds of the

1190
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:35,280
the two-thirds of the
 

1191
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,950
the two-thirds of the
things that marx calls for in the

1192
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:36,960
things that marx calls for in the
 

1193
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,710
things that marx calls for in the
communist manifesto are already just

1194
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:38,720
communist manifesto are already just
 

1195
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,909
communist manifesto are already just
part of the

1196
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:39,919
part of the
 

1197
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,430
part of the
liberal state

1198
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:41,440
liberal state
 

1199
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,669
liberal state
and so the parts we remember or forget

1200
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:43,679
and so the parts we remember or forget
 

1201
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,710
and so the parts we remember or forget
about an ideology are very revealing

1202
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:46,720
about an ideology are very revealing
 

1203
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,470
about an ideology are very revealing
if we can just linger on this a little

1204
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:48,480
if we can just linger on this a little
 

1205
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,669
if we can just linger on this a little
bit longer

1206
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:49,679
bit longer
 

1207
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,270
bit longer
what have you learned

1208
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:51,280
what have you learned
 

1209
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,630
what have you learned
from this period of the nineteen

1210
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:54,640
from this period of the nineteen
 

1211
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,950
from this period of the nineteen
about the scientific process

1212
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:56,960
about the scientific process
 

1213
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,990
about the scientific process
so

1214
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:58,000
so
 

1215
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,669
so
one of the labels you can put on your

1216
00:22:59,669 --> 00:22:59,679
one of the labels you can put on your
 

1217
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,029
one of the labels you can put on your
work

1218
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:01,039
work
 

1219
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,950
work
and you as a scholar is a philosopher of

1220
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:02,960
and you as a scholar is a philosopher of
 

1221
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,710
and you as a scholar is a philosopher of
science

1222
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:04,720
science
 

1223
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,270
science
and you also talk about nazi germany as

1224
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:07,280
and you also talk about nazi germany as
 

1225
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,390
and you also talk about nazi germany as
a singular

1226
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:08,400
a singular
 

1227
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,029
a singular
moment in time or like a a rebirth of

1228
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:11,039
moment in time or like a a rebirth of
 

1229
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:11,830
moment in time or like a a rebirth of
the

1230
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:11,840
the
 

1231
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,990
the
integration between

1232
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:14,000
integration between
 

1233
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,909
integration between
ideology and science

1234
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:15,919
ideology and science
 

1235
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,029
ideology and science
so the

1236
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:17,039
so the
 

1237
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,710
so the
like um

1238
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:18,720
like um
 

1239
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,789
like um
in terms of valueless science i think is

1240
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:20,799
in terms of valueless science i think is
 

1241
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,750
in terms of valueless science i think is
the term value freestyle value free

1242
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:23,760
the term value freestyle value free
 

1243
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,350
the term value freestyle value free
science uh

1244
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:25,360
science uh
 

1245
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,270
science uh
that you use i mean it seems like nazi

1246
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:27,280
that you use i mean it seems like nazi
 

1247
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,789
that you use i mean it seems like nazi
germany is a

1248
00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:28,799
germany is a
 

1249
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,549
germany is a
important moment in history i mean it

1250
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:30,559
important moment in history i mean it
 

1251
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,870
important moment in history i mean it
probably goes up and down

1252
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:32,880
probably goes up and down
 

1253
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,230
probably goes up and down
what

1254
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:34,240
what

what um
difficult truths have you learned about

1258
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:37,600
difficult truths have you learned about
 

1259
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,430
difficult truths have you learned about
the scientific process and what hopeful

1260
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:41,440
the scientific process and what hopeful
 

1261
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,549
the scientific process and what hopeful
things have you learned about the

1262

things have you learned about the
 

1263
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,230
things have you learned about the
scientific process

1264
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:44,240
scientific process
 

1265
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,750
scientific process
well

1266
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:45,760
well
 

1267
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,430
well
i guess the saddening thing is how

1268
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:47,440
i guess the saddening thing is how
 

1269
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,350
i guess the saddening thing is how
easily people can become part of a

1270
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:49,360
easily people can become part of a
 

1271
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,029
easily people can become part of a
machine

1272
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:51,039
machine
 

1273
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,669
machine
uh if there's power

1274
00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:53,679
uh if there's power
 

1275
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,230
uh if there's power
people can be found to follow it

1276
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:56,240
people can be found to follow it
 

1277
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,390
people can be found to follow it
you know one of the things i work on is

1278
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:58,400
you know one of the things i work on is
 

1279

you know one of the things i work on is
is big tobacco and we'll probably come

1280
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:00,799
is big tobacco and we'll probably come
 

1281
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,950
is big tobacco and we'll probably come
to that but

1282
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:02,960
to that but
 

1283
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,430
to that but
it's amazing to me how easily people are

1284
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:05,440
it's amazing to me how easily people are
 

1285
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,029
it's amazing to me how easily people are
willing to work for big tobacco it's

1286
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:07,039
willing to work for big tobacco it's
 

1287
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,710
willing to work for big tobacco it's
amazing to me how

amazing to me how
 

1289

amazing to me how
many

1290
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:09,919
many
 

1291
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,590
many
scientists and physicians were willing

1292
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:11,600
scientists and physicians were willing
 

1293
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,190
scientists and physicians were willing
to work for the

1294
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:13,200
to work for the
 

1295
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,510
to work for the
nazi regime

1296
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:15,520
nazi regime
 

1297
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,830
nazi regime
for multiple reasons

1298
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:17,840
for multiple reasons
 

1299
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,350
for multiple reasons
partly because

1300
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:19,360
partly because
 

1301
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,990
partly because
a lot of them really thought they were

1302
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:22,000
a lot of them really thought they were
 

1303
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,669
a lot of them really thought they were
you know doing the lord's work they

filth
 

1309
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,149
filth
you know i mean

1310
00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:30,159
you know i mean
 

1311
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,230
you know i mean

a parasitic race you know why wouldn't
 

1315
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,549
a parasitic race you know why wouldn't
you you know get rid of them

1316
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:36,559
you you know get rid of them
 

1317
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,470
you you know get rid of them
so there's an ontology there's there's a

1318
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:38,480
so there's an ontology there's there's a
 

1319
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,390
so there's an ontology there's there's a
theory of the world

1320
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:40,400
theory of the world
 

1321
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,390
theory of the world
that they're building on

1322
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:42,400
that they're building on
 

1323
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,630
that they're building on
and interestingly one that was

1324
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:44,640
and interestingly one that was
 

1325
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,830
and interestingly one that was
um

1326
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:45,840
um
 

1327
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,350
um
also present in the united states and

1328
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:47,360
also present in the united states and
 

1329
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,669
also present in the united states and
one of the things i did find out

1330
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:49,679
one of the things i did find out
 

1331
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,909
one of the things i did find out
in my earliest research was that the

1332
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:51,919
in my earliest research was that the
 

1333
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,149
in my earliest research was that the
nazis had looked

1334
00:24:54,149 --> 00:24:54,159
nazis had looked
 

1335
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,830

racial separation
 

1343
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,310
racial separation
and

1344
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:02,320
and
 

1345
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,390
and
saw themselves in a kind of competition

1346
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:04,400
saw themselves in a kind of competition
 

1347
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,029
saw themselves in a kind of competition
to become the world's racial leader

1348
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:07,039
to become the world's racial leader
 

1349
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,350
to become the world's racial leader
as the most purified

racial form
 

1353
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,350
racial form
and that this required this kind of

1354
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:13,360
and that this required this kind of
 

1355
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,990
and that this required this kind of
cleansing process

1356
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:16,000
cleansing process
 

1357
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,510
cleansing process
and

1358
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:17,520

these were all of a piece
 

1375
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,630
these were all of a piece
uh there's a famous uh illustration that

1376
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:40,640

 

1377
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,870

richard dahl talks about the great great

cancer theorists of

1380
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:44,720
cancer theorists of
 

1381
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,950
cancer theorists of
of of studying in nazi germany in the in

1382
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:46,960
of of studying in nazi germany in the in
 

1383
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,630
of of studying in nazi germany in the in
the 1930s and

1384
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:48,640
the 1930s and
 

1385
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,710
the 1930s and
he's shown a lecture where

1386
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:50,720
he's shown a lecture where
 

1387
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,190
he's shown a lecture where
cancer cells are shown as jews and

1388
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:53,200
cancer cells are shown as jews and
 

1389
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,149
cancer cells are shown as jews and
x-rays are shown as a stormtroopers and

1390
00:25:56,149 --> 00:25:56,159
x-rays are shown as a stormtroopers and
 

1391
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,870
x-rays are shown as a stormtroopers and
these stormtroopers are killing the the

1392
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:58,880
these stormtroopers are killing the the
 

1393
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,230
these stormtroopers are killing the the
cancer cells who are also jews and so

1394
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:02,240
cancer cells who are also jews and so
 

1395
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,190
cancer cells who are also jews and so
there's this metaphorical work of of

1396
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:05,200
there's this metaphorical work of of
 

1397
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,070
there's this metaphorical work of of
cleaning extermination sanitation

1398
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,080
cleaning extermination sanitation
 

1399
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,710
cleaning extermination sanitation
purification of the sort purification

1400
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:10,720
purification of the sort purification
 

1401
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,390
purification of the sort purification
there's definitely a kind of purity

1402
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:12,400
there's definitely a kind of purity
 

1403
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,470
there's definitely a kind of purity
quest and you see that at

1404
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:14,480
quest and you see that at
 

1405
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,630
quest and you see that at
multiple levels

1406
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:16,640
multiple levels
 

1407
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,710
multiple levels
and so

1408
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:18,720
and so
 

1409
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,669
and so
you see how easy it is for people to

1410
00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:21,679
you see how easy it is for people to
 

1411
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,510
you see how easy it is for people to
fall into that

1412
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:23,520
fall into that
 

1413
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,110
fall into that
given a particular

1414
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:25,120
given a particular
 

1415
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,950
given a particular
theory and again

1416
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:26,960
theory and again
 

1417
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,870
theory and again
coming back to that earlier sort of

1418
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:28,880
coming back to that earlier sort of
 

1419
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,470
coming back to that earlier sort of
point about the scarecrow which i think

1420
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:30,480
point about the scarecrow which i think
 

1421
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,029
point about the scarecrow which i think
is very important uh

1422
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:33,039
is very important uh
 

1423
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,870
is very important uh
if we imagine that nothing like this

1424
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:34,880
if we imagine that nothing like this
 

1425
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,870
if we imagine that nothing like this
went on here in the united states that

1426
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:36,880
went on here in the united states that
 

1427
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,870
went on here in the united states that
would be a big mistake

1428
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:38,880
would be a big mistake
 

1429
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,470
would be a big mistake

00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:58,320
world war ii so you have racial
 

1445
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,590
world war ii so you have racial
segregation

1446
00:26:59,590 --> 00:26:59,600
segregation

00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:01,679
you have massive sterilization in the
 

1449
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,310
you have massive sterilization in the
united states way before the nazis

1450
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:04,320
united states way before the nazis
 

1451
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,070
united states way before the nazis
one of the first things the nazis do

1452
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:06,080
one of the first things the nazis do
 

1453
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,470
one of the first things the nazis do
from a racial hygiene point of view is

1454
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:08,480
from a racial hygiene point of view is
 

1455
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,029
from a racial hygiene point of view is
start sterilizing what they call the

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,190
handicapped well that had been going on
since around world war one

1462
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:17,200
since around world war one
 

1463
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,510
since around world war one
in the united states and even earlier in

1464
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:19,520
in the united states and even earlier in
 

1465
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,230
in the united states and even earlier in
certain states in the form of castration

1466
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:22,240
certain states in the form of castration
 

1467
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,950
certain states in the form of castration
of of prisoners

1468

of of prisoners
in order to prevent their demon seed

1470
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:27,200
in order to prevent their demon seed
 

1471
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,950
in order to prevent their demon seed
from being propagated

1472
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:28,960
from being propagated
 

1473
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,470
from being propagated
further into the race

1474
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:30,480
further into the race
 

1475
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,669
further into the race
so

1476
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:31,679
so
 

1477
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,029
so
there's a kind of a racial international

1478
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:35,039
there's a kind of a racial international
 

1479
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,110
there's a kind of a racial international
that's going on and that part of the

1480
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:37,120
that's going on and that part of the
 

1481
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,230
that's going on and that part of the
story

1482
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:38,240
story
 

1483
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,950
story
also needs to be told

1484
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:40,960
also needs to be told
 

1485
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,630
also needs to be told
and scientists were able to carry those

1486
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:42,640
and scientists were able to carry those
 

1487
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,110
and scientists were able to carry those
ideas in their mind from from your work

1488
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:45,120
ideas in their mind from from your work
 

1489
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,430
ideas in their mind from from your work
of course of course i mean that's one of

1490
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:47,440
of course of course i mean that's one of

it has to be done on a case-by-case

it has to be done on a case-by-case

1509
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,510
but in general i think it's it's usually
better to add on rather than subtract in

convince
 

1615
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,190

but uh

1616
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:19,200

 

1617
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,510

can you steal man the argument that my

1618
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:21,520
can you steal man the argument that my
 

1619
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,430
can you steal man the argument that my
column should be banned and can you

1620

00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:28,880
well i wouldn't say it should be banned
 

1627
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,029
well i wouldn't say it should be banned
i think if anything that might make it

1628
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:31,039
i think if anything that might make it
 

1629
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,950
i think if anything that might make it
forbidden fruit

1630
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:32,960
forbidden fruit
 

1631
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,389
forbidden fruit
now this might be

1632
00:30:34,389 --> 00:30:34,399
now this might be
 

1633
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,710
now this might be
different when we come to statues on the

1634
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:36,720
different when we come to statues on the
 

1635
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,830
different when we come to statues on the
public square after world war ii

1636
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:39,840
public square after world war ii
 

1637
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,350
public square after world war ii
the statues of hitler there must have

1638
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:41,360
the statues of hitler there must have
 

1639
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,830
the statues of hitler there must have
been thousands of them were taken down

1640
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:43,840
been thousands of them were taken down
 

1641
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,590
been thousands of them were taken down
now i think even the most rabid

1642
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:47,600
now i think even the most rabid
 

1643
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,990
now i think even the most rabid
opponents of cancel culture

1644
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:52,000

 

1645
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,830

would not say there was something wrong

1646
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:53,840
would not say there was something wrong
 

1647
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,230
would not say there was something wrong
with taking down the statues of hitler

1648
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:56,240
with taking down the statues of hitler
 

1649
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,870
with taking down the statues of hitler
that were in every office building every

1650
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:58,880
that were in every office building every
 

1651
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,029
that were in every office building every
post office

1652
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:01,039
post office
 

1653
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,149
post office
so

1654
00:31:02,149 --> 00:31:02,159
so
 

1655
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,110
so
i think a lot depends on the

1656
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:05,120
i think a lot depends on the
 

1657
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,830
i think a lot depends on the

now partly just because it's kind of

1680
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:37,279
now partly just because it's kind of
 

1681
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,230
now partly just because it's kind of
outdated and crazy crazy talk so

1682
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:40,240
outdated and crazy crazy talk so
 

1683

types of things
 

1691
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,070
types of things
it's a judgment call in each case i

1692
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:50,080
it's a judgment call in each case i
 

1693
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,950
it's a judgment call in each case i
think it has to be probably voted on

1694
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:54,960

 

1695
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,350

but it also uh i think

1696
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:57,360
but it also uh i think
 

1697
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,350
but it also uh i think
in many of these cases there's an add-on

1698
00:31:59,350 --> 00:31:59,360
in many of these cases there's an add-on
 

1699
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,909
in many of these cases there's an add-on
view it would fix a lot of the problems

1700
00:32:01,909 --> 00:32:01,919
view it would fix a lot of the problems
 

1701
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,269

00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,349
obviously all
uh approaches will go wrong in some ways

1822
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:11,359
uh approaches will go wrong in some ways
 

1823
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,829
uh approaches will go wrong in some ways
which is more likely to go wrong

1824
00:34:13,829 --> 00:34:13,839
which is more likely to go wrong
 

1825
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,750
which is more likely to go wrong
uh one where you try to get a hold of

1826
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:15,760
uh one where you try to get a hold of
 

1827
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,629
uh one where you try to get a hold of
like all right this is a viral

1828
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:18,639
like all right this is a viral
 

1829
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,829
like all right this is a viral
thing and it doesn't

1830
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:21,839
thing and it doesn't
 

1831
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,510
thing and it doesn't
fit with scientific consensus so we

1832
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:23,520
fit with scientific consensus so we
 

1833
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,669
fit with scientific consensus so we
should probably like try to like quiet

1834
00:34:25,669 --> 00:34:25,679
should probably like try to like quiet
 

1835
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,510
should probably like try to like quiet
it down a little bit or do you let it

1836
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:27,520
it down a little bit or do you let it
 

1837
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,869
it down a little bit or do you let it
all just fly and let the ideas battle do

1838
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:30,879
all just fly and let the ideas battle do
 

1839
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:33,109
all just fly and let the ideas battle do
you think about this kind of stuff

1840
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:33,119
you think about this kind of stuff
 

1841
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,710
you think about this kind of stuff
in the context of

1842
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:34,720
in the context of

million dollar
 

1847
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,550
million dollar
question of course now it's a

00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:40,560
question of course now it's a
 

1849
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,389
question of course now it's a
multi-billion dollar question not

trying to make an effort to rein in
misinformation it's going to be

1904
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:47,040
misinformation it's going to be
 

1905
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,030
misinformation it's going to be
difficult and there the mistakes are

1906
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:49,040
difficult and there the mistakes are
 

1907
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,589
difficult and there the mistakes are
going to be made but it can't be a

1908
00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:51,599
going to be made but it can't be a
 

1909

unfortunately
 

1915
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,270
unfortunately
the pressure these platforms feel

1916
00:35:59,270 --> 00:35:59,280
the pressure these platforms feel
 

1917
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,510
the pressure these platforms feel
to identify and to censor misinformation

1918
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:03,520
to identify and to censor misinformation
 

1919
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,390
to identify and to censor misinformation
that pressure is uh

that pressure is uh
 

1921
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,270
that pressure is uh
ideological in nature currently

1922
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:09,280
ideological in nature currently

00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,550
ideological in nature currently
so if you just objectively look there's

1924
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:12,560
so if you just objectively look there's
 

1925
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,630
so if you just objectively look there's
a certain political lien to people that

1926
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:14,640
a certain political lien to people that
 

1927
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,349
a certain political lien to people that
are

misinformation which makes me very
uncomfortable

1934
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:20,480
uncomfortable
 

1935
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,310
uncomfortable
because now there's an ideology to

well that's that's certainly possible

1986
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:18,880
well that's that's certainly possible
 

1987
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,790
well that's that's certainly possible
yeah i mean the uh

conspiracies
and

2004
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:38,160
and
 

2005
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,670
and
that

2006
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:39,680
that
 

2007
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,390
that
you know people work behind scenes to do

2008
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:42,400
you know people work behind scenes to do
 

2009
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,270
you know people work behind scenes to do
powerful bad things and

2010
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:45,280
powerful bad things and
 

2011
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,589
powerful bad things and
that's what needs to be exposed the

2012
00:37:47,589 --> 00:37:47,599
that's what needs to be exposed the
 

2013
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:48,950
that's what needs to be exposed the
other thing i worry about which is

2014
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:48,960
other thing i worry about which is
 

2015
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,510
other thing i worry about which is
relevant to your question again it's a

2016
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:51,520
relevant to your question again it's a
 

2017
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,910
relevant to your question again it's a
billion or trillion dollar question is

2018
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:53,920
billion or trillion dollar question is
 

2019
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,910
billion or trillion dollar question is
uh we're ki i think in a world of kind

2020
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:55,920
uh we're ki i think in a world of kind
 

2021
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,990
uh we're ki i think in a world of kind
of flattening where

2022
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:58,000
of flattening where
 

2023
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,349
of flattening where
all news or all information or all data

2024
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:01,359
all news or all information or all data
 

2025
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,349
all news or all information or all data
is kind of equal in some way and so you

2026
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:03,359
is kind of equal in some way and so you
 

2027
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,109
is kind of equal in some way and so you
get the twitter verse

2028
00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:05,119
get the twitter verse
 

2029
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,950
get the twitter verse
going and

2030
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:06,960
going and
 

2031
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,630
going and
it doesn't matter if it's peer-reviewed

2032
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:08,640
it doesn't matter if it's peer-reviewed
 

2033
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,950
it doesn't matter if it's peer-reviewed
or it doesn't matter if it's

2034
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:10,960
or it doesn't matter if it's
 

2035
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,829
or it doesn't matter if it's
been supported by evidence it's just

2036
00:38:13,829 --> 00:38:13,839
been supported by evidence it's just
 

2037
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,510
been supported by evidence it's just
you know a kind of

2038
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:15,520
you know a kind of
 

2039
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,710
you know a kind of
outburst

2040
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:16,720
outburst
 

2041
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,470
outburst
it's it's interesting to contrast it

2042
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:18,480
it's it's interesting to contrast it
 

2043
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,390
it's it's interesting to contrast it
with say a hundred years ago i mean what

2044
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:20,400
with say a hundred years ago i mean what
 

2045
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,349
with say a hundred years ago i mean what
would

2046
00:38:21,349 --> 00:38:21,359
would
 

2047
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,710
would
a crazy person or a uh

2048
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:24,720
a crazy person or a uh
 

2049
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,030
a crazy person or a uh
a flat earther or anything

2050
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:27,040
a flat earther or anything
 

2051
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,589
a flat earther or anything
what venue would they have i mean maybe

2052
00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:29,599
what venue would they have i mean maybe
 

2053
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,750
what venue would they have i mean maybe
they could go to a church or someplace i

2054
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:31,760
they could go to a church or someplace i
 

2055
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,950
they could go to a church or someplace i
mean

2056
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:32,960
mean
 

2057
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,430
mean
uh

2058
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:35,440

 

2059
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,589

so now we have this in these empowering

2060
00:38:37,589 --> 00:38:37,599
so now we have this in these empowering
 

2061
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:38,710
so now we have this in these empowering
engines

2062
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:38,720
engines
 

2063
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,950
engines
then that's what's new historically is

2064
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:40,960
then that's what's new historically is
 

2065
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,910
then that's what's new historically is
that

2066
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:41,920
that
 

2067
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,589
that
basically anyone can have a blog or a

2068
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:45,599
basically anyone can have a blog or a
 

2069
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:46,790
basically anyone can have a blog or a
twitter

2070
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:46,800
twitter
 

2071
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,230
twitter
feed and

2072
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:48,240
feed and
 

2073
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,790
feed and
that is new and so that is

2074
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:50,800
that is new and so that is
 

2075
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,230
that is new and so that is
you can think of it also as a kind of

2076
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:52,240
you can think of it also as a kind of
 

2077
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,750
you can think of it also as a kind of
clutter so it's kind of a radical

2078
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:53,760
clutter so it's kind of a radical
 

2079
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,990
clutter so it's kind of a radical
democracy in a way that kind of the one

2080
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:56,000
democracy in a way that kind of the one
 

2081
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,589
democracy in a way that kind of the one
of the weaknesses of democracy is if

2082
00:38:57,589 --> 00:38:57,599
of the weaknesses of democracy is if
 

2083
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,670
of the weaknesses of democracy is if
everyone has an equal voice

2084
00:38:59,670 --> 00:38:59,680
everyone has an equal voice
 

2085
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,829
everyone has an equal voice
and if everyone has equal power

2086
00:39:01,829 --> 00:39:01,839
and if everyone has equal power
 

2087
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,829
and if everyone has equal power
so there's of course a flip side to that

2088
00:39:03,829 --> 00:39:03,839
so there's of course a flip side to that
 

2089
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,550
so there's of course a flip side to that
where everyone has equal power it forces

2090
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:06,560
where everyone has equal power it forces
 

2091
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,829
where everyone has equal power it forces
the people

2092
00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:07,839
the people
 

2093
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,510
the people
who are quote-unquote experts to be

2094
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:09,520
who are quote-unquote experts to be
 

2095
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,150
who are quote-unquote experts to be
better communication i think people like

2099
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,349
scientists are just like upset that they
have to do like better work at

have to do like better work at
 

2101
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,589
have to do like better work at
communicating now they used to be lazy

2102
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:17,599
communicating now they used to be lazy
 

2103
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,430
communicating now they used to be lazy
and you could just like say i have a phd

2104
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:19,440
and you could just like say i have a phd
 

2105
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,950
and you could just like say i have a phd
therefore everyone listen to me now they

get the uglification of science the
 

2181
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,030
get the uglification of science the
deliberate uglification of science with

deliberate uglification of science with

the idea being that if you are clear and
if you speak beautifully if you write

00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:37,040
if you speak beautifully if you write
 

2187
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,030
if you speak beautifully if you write
beautifully you're hiding something

2188
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:39,040
beautifully you're hiding something
 

2189
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,870
beautifully you're hiding something
you're covering over

00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:40,880
you're covering over
 

2191
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,150
you're covering over
the truth with

2197
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,670
and decorations and and
scents and pleasant odors and so

2198
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:49,680
scents and pleasant odors and so
 

2199
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,349
scents and pleasant odors and so
you get this

2200
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:51,359
you get this
 

2201
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,190
you get this
scientific paper format you know

2202
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:53,200
scientific paper format you know
 

2203
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,190
scientific paper format you know
introduction discussion

2204
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:55,200

00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,069
introduction discussion
methods conclude you know results

2206
00:40:58,069 --> 00:40:58,079
methods conclude you know results
 

2207
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,349
methods conclude you know results
conclusions

2208
00:40:59,349 --> 00:40:59,359
conclusions
 

2209
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:02,630
conclusions
and it's it's kind of policed in this

2210
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:02,640
and it's it's kind of policed in this
 

2211
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,589
and it's it's kind of policed in this
inhumane non-humanistic kind of

2212
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:05,599
inhumane non-humanistic kind of
 

2213
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:07,270
inhumane non-humanistic kind of
rhetorical way and that's a big problem

2214
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:07,280
rhetorical way and that's a big problem
 

2215
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,950
rhetorical way and that's a big problem
and so you get

2216
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:08,960
and so you get
 

2217
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,870
and so you get
that combined with just the rise of the

2218
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:10,880
that combined with just the rise of the
 

2219
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,589
that combined with just the rise of the
research lab and the ever narrower

00:41:13,589 --> 00:41:13,599
research lab and the ever narrower

2225
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,470

it's not surprising that people might

2226
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:20,480
it's not surprising that people might
 

2227
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,870
it's not surprising that people might
not trust certain aspects of that that

2228
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:22,880
not trust certain aspects of that that
 

2229
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,990
not trust certain aspects of that that
combined with the dirty laundry history

2230
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:26,000
combined with the dirty laundry history
 

2231
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,910
combined with the dirty laundry history
of a lot of science

2232
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:27,920
of a lot of science
 

2233
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,230
of a lot of science
uh that you did have you know the

2234
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:30,240
uh that you did have you know the
 

2235
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,270
uh that you did have you know the
requirement that uh at auschwitz that

2236
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:33,280
requirement that uh at auschwitz that
 

2237
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,349
requirement that uh at auschwitz that
people be you know that physicians

2238
00:41:35,349 --> 00:41:35,359
people be you know that physicians
 

2239
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,670
people be you know that physicians
supervise the killings

2240
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:37,680
supervise the killings
 

2241
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,710
supervise the killings
uh

2242
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:38,720
uh
 

2243
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,589
uh
you know

2244
00:41:39,589 --> 00:41:39,599
you know
 

2245
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:42,630
you know
the the horrors of you know tuskegee and

2246
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:42,640
the the horrors of you know tuskegee and
 

2247
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,150
the the horrors of you know tuskegee and
and all kinds of other things or even

2248
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:44,160
and all kinds of other things or even
 

2249
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,829
and all kinds of other things or even
something like the atom bomb which is

2250
00:41:45,829 --> 00:41:45,839
something like the atom bomb which is
 

2251
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,390
something like the atom bomb which is
arguably more neutral at least but

2252
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:48,400
arguably more neutral at least but
 

2253
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,390
arguably more neutral at least but
nonetheless horrific and so

2254
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:50,400
nonetheless horrific and so
 

2255
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,230
nonetheless horrific and so
it's not surprising that

2256
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:52,240
it's not surprising that
 

2257
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,829
it's not surprising that
a lot of people don't trust science and

2258
00:41:53,829 --> 00:41:53,839
a lot of people don't trust science and
 

2259
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,069
a lot of people don't trust science and
a lot of science shouldn't be trusted

2260
00:41:56,069 --> 00:41:56,079
a lot of science shouldn't be trusted
 

2261
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:57,510
a lot of science shouldn't be trusted
right there's science and then there's

2262
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:57,520
right there's science and then there's
 

2263
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,670
right there's science and then there's
science so there's a long history of

2264
00:41:59,670 --> 00:41:59,680
science so there's a long history of
 

2265
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,710
science so there's a long history of
dirty

2266
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:00,720
dirty
 

2267
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,470
dirty
bad science

2268
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:02,480
bad science
 

2269
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,230
bad science
that you don't solve just by saying we

2270
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:04,240
that you don't solve just by saying we
 

2271
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,829
that you don't solve just by saying we
should have trusted it

2272
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:05,839
should have trusted it
 

2273
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:07,190
should have trusted it
let's just stay

2274
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:07,200
let's just stay
 

2275
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,829
let's just stay
uncovered for a brief moment

2276
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:09,839
uncovered for a brief moment
 

2277
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,109
uncovered for a brief moment
and talk about a

00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:11,119
and talk about a
 

2279
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,470

that i think about is anthony fauci

2284
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:16,400
that i think about is anthony fauci
 

2285
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,309
that i think about is anthony fauci
i've thought about whether to talk to

2286
00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:18,319
i've thought about whether to talk to
 

2287
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:22,309
i've thought about whether to talk to
him or not

2288
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:22,319

 

2289
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,230

i have my own feelings about anthony

basically everybody and i admire
 

2295
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,510
basically everybody and i admire
scientists a lot and there's something

2296
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:31,520
scientists a lot and there's something
 

2297
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:36,230
scientists a lot and there's something
about him that bothers me

2298
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:36,240

 

2299
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,470

i think because i'm always bothered by

2300
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:38,480
i think because i'm always bothered by
 

2301
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,190
i think because i'm always bothered by
ego and lack of humility and i sense

2302
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:41,200
ego and lack of humility and i sense
 

2303
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,069
ego and lack of humility and i sense
that

2304
00:42:42,069 --> 00:42:42,079
that
 

2305
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:43,510
that
maybe

2306
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:43,520
maybe
 

2307
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,270
maybe
maybe i'm very wrong on this but so

2308
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:47,280
maybe i'm very wrong on this but so
 

2309
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,750
maybe i'm very wrong on this but so
he said that he represents science if

2310
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:49,760
he said that he represents science if
 

2311
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,630
he said that he represents science if

i'm bothered by it because i feel like

2474
00:45:51,109 --> 00:45:51,119
i'm bothered by it because i feel like
 

2475
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,190
i'm bothered by it because i feel like
science is under attack

2476
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:53,200
science is under attack
 

2477
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,109
science is under attack
uh people distrust science more and more

2478
00:45:55,109 --> 00:45:55,119
uh people distrust science more and more
 

2479
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,750
uh people distrust science more and more
and more yeah and uh it is perhaps

2480
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:57,760
and more yeah and uh it is perhaps
 

2481
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,710
and more yeah and uh it is perhaps
unfair to put place like anthony fauci

2482
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:00,720
unfair to put place like anthony fauci
 

2483
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,950
unfair to put place like anthony fauci

leadership position that can heal the

2522
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:38,160
leadership position that can heal the
 

2523
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,750
leadership position that can heal the
division you can you can think of

2524
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:41,760
division you can you can think of
 

2525
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,630
division you can you can think of
tech

2526
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:42,640
tech
 

2527
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,670

leaders

2528
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:43,680
leaders
 

2529
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,109
leaders
they can heal the division because they

2530
00:46:45,109 --> 00:46:45,119
they can heal the division because they
 

2531
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:46,870
they can heal the division because they
have the platform they can speak out

2532
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:46,880
have the platform they can speak out

00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:48,560
with eloquence you can think of
 

2535
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,870
with eloquence you can think of
political leaders presidents that can

2536

political leaders presidents that can
 

2537
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,950
political leaders presidents that can
speak out and heal the division you

speak out and heal the division you
 

2539
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,550
speak out and heal the division you
could think of scientific leaders like

2540
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:54,560
could think of scientific leaders like
 

2541
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,270
could think of scientific leaders like
anthony fauci they could heal division

2542
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:57,280
anthony fauci they could heal division
 

2543
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,790
anthony fauci they could heal division
none of these are doing a good job right

2544
00:46:58,790 --> 00:46:58,800
none of these are doing a good job right
 

2545
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,230
none of these are doing a good job right
now and

2546
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:00,240
now and
 

2547
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,950
now and
which is you know leadership is hard

2548
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:02,960
which is you know leadership is hard
 

2549
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,109
which is you know leadership is hard
which is why when great leaders come

2550
00:47:05,109 --> 00:47:05,119
which is why when great leaders come
 

2551
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,990
which is why when great leaders come
along history remembers them so i just

2552
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:08,000
along history remembers them so i just
 

2553
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,910
along history remembers them so i just
want to point out the emperor has no

2554
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:09,920
want to point out the emperor has no

2559
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,550
kind of mediocre yeah because it feels
like not i guess

2560
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:16,560
like not i guess
 

2561

like not i guess
i'll take it to a question about nazi

2562
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:18,400
i'll take it to a question about nazi
 

2563
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,589
i'll take it to a question about nazi
germany what is the heroic action for a

2564
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:21,599
germany what is the heroic action for a
 

2565
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,790
germany what is the heroic action for a
scientist

2566
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:22,800
scientist
 

2567
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,510
scientist
in nazi germany like

2568
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:25,520
in nazi germany like
 

2569
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,349
in nazi germany like
to stand

2570
00:47:27,349 --> 00:47:27,359
to stand
 

2571
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:30,630
to stand
to see what's right

2572
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:30,640
to see what's right
 

2573
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,230
to see what's right
when uh

2574
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:32,240
when uh
 

2575
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,030
when uh
you're under this cloud of ideology

2576
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:35,040
you're under this cloud of ideology
 

2577
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,470
you're under this cloud of ideology
yeah

2578
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:36,480
yeah
 

2579
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,790
yeah
well it's an almost impossible

2580
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:38,800
well it's an almost impossible
 

2581
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,750
well it's an almost impossible
task in nazi germany uh

2582
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:41,760
task in nazi germany uh
 

2583
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,309
task in nazi germany uh
maybe the heroic task would have been

2584
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:44,319
maybe the heroic task would have been
 

2585
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:45,829
maybe the heroic task would have been
before

2586
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:45,839
before
 

2587
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,630
before
uh hitler was essentially elected

2588
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:48,640
uh hitler was essentially elected
 

2589
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,750
uh hitler was essentially elected
uh

2590
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:49,760
uh
 

2591
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,470
uh
and the reichstag is burned

2592
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:52,480
and the reichstag is burned
 

2593
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,030
and the reichstag is burned
so in the 30s because it's building when

2594
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:55,040
so in the 30s because it's building when
 

2595
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,510
so in the 30s because it's building when
it's building uh what the other

2596
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:57,520
it's building uh what the other
 

2597
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,190
it's building uh what the other
alternatives are

2598
00:47:59,190 --> 00:47:59,200
alternatives are
 

2599
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,390
alternatives are
um maybe it's events in in world war one

2600
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:02,400
um maybe it's events in in world war one
 

2601
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,870
um maybe it's events in in world war one
that that could have made

2602
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:04,880
that that could have made
 

2603
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,510
that that could have made
nazism less inevitable

2604
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:07,520
nazism less inevitable
 

2605
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,710
nazism less inevitable
um

2606
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:08,720
um
 

2607
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,030
um
you know maybe it's uh

2608
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:11,040
you know maybe it's uh
 

2609
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,309
you know maybe it's uh
going back

2610
00:48:12,309 --> 00:48:12,319
going back
 

2611
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:15,270
going back
in to the british empire which

2612
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:15,280
in to the british empire which
 

2613
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,750
in to the british empire which
had a giant empire and and germany

2614
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:17,760
had a giant empire and and germany
 

2615
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,750
had a giant empire and and germany
wanted a big empire too

2616
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:19,760
wanted a big empire too
 

2617
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,349
wanted a big empire too
right and that part of the history of

2618
00:48:21,349 --> 00:48:21,359
right and that part of the history of
 

2619
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,670
right and that part of the history of
world war one is is often often

2620
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:23,680
world war one is is often often
 

2621
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,109
world war one is is often often
forgotten

2622
00:48:25,109 --> 00:48:25,119
forgotten
 

2623
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:26,230
forgotten
so

2624
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:26,240
so
 

2625
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,549
so
you know the heroic act is is to stand

2626
00:48:28,549 --> 00:48:28,559
you know the heroic act is is to stand
 

2627
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:30,390
you know the heroic act is is to stand
up and tell the truth

2628
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:30,400
up and tell the truth
 

2629
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,870
up and tell the truth
and fight against evil

2630
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:32,880
and fight against evil
 

2631
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,109
and fight against evil
and of course you can get oh science

2632
00:48:35,109 --> 00:48:35,119
and of course you can get oh science
 

2633
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:36,549
and of course you can get oh science
interrupt but of course you have some

2634
00:48:36,549 --> 00:48:36,559
interrupt but of course you have some
 

2635
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:37,750
interrupt but of course you have some
courage

2636
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:37,760
courage
 

2637
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,950

that we don't look
 

2703
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,710
that we don't look
enough at what i call the causes of

we're all worried about
 

2731
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,950
we're all worried about
climate change and reducing our carbon

2732

climate change and reducing our carbon
 

2733
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,349
climate change and reducing our carbon
footprint but what about the

2734
00:50:23,349 --> 00:50:23,359
footprint but what about the
 

2735
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,270
footprint but what about the
hidden causes

2736
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:25,280
hidden causes
 

2737
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,829
hidden causes
the unprobed causes i'm doing a project

00:50:30,309 --> 00:50:30,319
now with london shebinger on
 

2741
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:31,589
now with london shebinger on
looking at

2742
00:50:31,589 --> 00:50:31,599
looking at
 

2743
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,829
looking at
how voluntary family planning could

2744
00:50:33,829 --> 00:50:33,839
how voluntary family planning could
 

2745
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:35,510
how voluntary family planning could
actually have a big

2746
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:35,520
actually have a big
 

2747
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:39,270
actually have a big
role in reducing carbon footprint

2748
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:39,280
role in reducing carbon footprint
 

2749
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,870
role in reducing carbon footprint
throughout the world and these

2750
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:40,880
throughout the world and these
 

2751
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,710
throughout the world and these
literatures are never joined or rarely

2752
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:42,720
literatures are never joined or rarely
 

2753
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,150
literatures are never joined or rarely
joined

2754
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:44,160
joined
 

2755
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,710
joined
that we have this huge um

2756
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:46,720
that we have this huge um
 

2757
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,230
that we have this huge um
carbon emissions problem but we also

2758
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:50,240
carbon emissions problem but we also
 

2759
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,270
carbon emissions problem but we also
have

2760
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:51,280
have
 

2761
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,870
have
you know too many people on the planet

2762
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:52,880
you know too many people on the planet
 

2763
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,710
you know too many people on the planet
and the cause of that is because too few

2764
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:56,720
and the cause of that is because too few
 

2765
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,589
and the cause of that is because too few
women and men have access to

2766
00:50:59,589 --> 00:50:59,599
women and men have access to
 

2767
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:01,270
women and men have access to
birth control

2768
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:01,280
birth control
 

2769
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,549
birth control
and

2770
00:51:02,549 --> 00:51:02,559
and
 

2771
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,109
and
if you join those

2772
00:51:05,109 --> 00:51:05,119
if you join those
 

2773
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:06,309
if you join those
realms

2774
00:51:06,309 --> 00:51:06,319
realms
 

2775
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:07,750
realms
open

2776
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:07,760
open
 

2777
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,230
open
there's going to be new possibilities

2778
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:10,240
there's going to be new possibilities
 

2779
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,670
there's going to be new possibilities
uh and

2780
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:11,680
uh and
 

2781
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,470
uh and
that's it's kind of like looking at uh

2782
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:14,480
that's it's kind of like looking at uh
 

2783
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,870
that's it's kind of like looking at uh
uh the flip side of fascism and the kind

2784
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:16,880
uh the flip side of fascism and the kind
 

2785
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,349
uh the flip side of fascism and the kind
of things the discoveries they made that

2786
00:51:19,349 --> 00:51:19,359
of things the discoveries they made that
 

2787
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:21,190
of things the discoveries they made that
have been ignored that's one of the

2788
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:21,200
have been ignored that's one of the
 

2789
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,430
have been ignored that's one of the
things i'm interested in is finding

2790
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:23,440
things i'm interested in is finding
 

2791
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,670
things i'm interested in is finding
some of the gaping holes the ideological

2792
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:25,680
some of the gaping holes the ideological
 

2793
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,750
some of the gaping holes the ideological
gaps that have been ignored because of

2794
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:27,760
gaps that have been ignored because of
 

2795
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:33,510
gaps that have been ignored because of
ideology left or right by the way

2796
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:33,520

 

2797
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,069

all both of which are involve blinders

2798
00:51:36,069 --> 00:51:36,079
all both of which are involve blinders
 

2799
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:37,430
all both of which are involve blinders
and so there's all kinds of blinders

2800
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:37,440
and so there's all kinds of blinders
 

2801
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,750
and so there's all kinds of blinders
that we live in that's part of ideology

2802
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:39,760
that we live in that's part of ideology
 

2803
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,710
that we live in that's part of ideology
is what what don't we even see and that

2804
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:42,720
is what what don't we even see and that
 

2805
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:43,750
is what what don't we even see and that
would

2806
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:43,760
would
 

2807
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,150
would
uh prevent us from seeing some deep

2808
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:46,160
uh prevent us from seeing some deep
 

2809
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,470
uh prevent us from seeing some deep
objective scientific truth right some

2810
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:48,480
objective scientific truth right some
 

2811
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,790
objective scientific truth right some
truth and there's actually so just to

2812
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:50,800
truth and there's actually so just to
 

2813
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,069
truth and there's actually so just to
mention there's

2814
00:51:52,069 --> 00:51:52,079
mention there's
 

2815
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:53,910
mention there's
some people including elon who are

2816
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:53,920
some people including elon who are
 

2817
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,870
some people including elon who are
saying

2818
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:54,880
saying
 

2819
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,030
saying
um there's not too many people there's

2820
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:57,040
um there's not too many people there's
 

2821
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,710
um there's not too many people there's
not enough people

it's and so it's like some of this is
 

2829
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,230
it's and so it's like some of this is
actually very difficult to figure out

2830
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:06,240
actually very difficult to figure out
 

2831
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,670
actually very difficult to figure out
because that there's there's these

um
 

2843
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,270
um
there are certain topics on which it's

cigarettes would no more likely to be
 

3039
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:57,270
cigarettes would no more likely to be
mentioned than if we were talking about

so
 

3053
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:11,030
so
we live in this world where most things

3054
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:11,040
we live in this world where most things
 

3055

00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:24,309
we don't see what's behind us we have a
fovea which means not only do we only

3066
00:56:24,309 --> 00:56:24,319
fovea which means not only do we only
 

3067
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,750

3071
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:30,630

and that's because we're predators we

3072
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:30,640
and that's because we're predators we
 

3073
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,789
and that's because we're predators we
don't have the eternal watchfulness of

prey we have a zeroed targeted focus and
 

3077
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,430
prey we have a zeroed targeted focus and
that leads to

3078
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:37,440
that leads to
 

3079
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,829
that leads to
a kind of myopia or a tunnel vision and

3080

a kind of myopia or a tunnel vision and

a kind of myopia or a tunnel vision and
all kinds of things

all kinds of things
 

3083
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,069
all kinds of things
then when you get something like a very

3084
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:44,079
then when you get something like a very
 

3085
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:46,349
then when you get something like a very
powerful tobacco industry which is a

3086
00:56:46,349 --> 00:56:46,359
powerful tobacco industry which is a
 

3087
00:56:46,359 --> 00:56:48,069
powerful tobacco industry which is a
multi-multi-billion dollar industry

3088
00:56:48,069 --> 00:56:48,079
multi-multi-billion dollar industry
 

3089
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:49,670
multi-multi-billion dollar industry
which still spends

3090
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:49,680
which still spends
 

3091
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,990
which still spends
many billions of dollars advertising

3092
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:52,000
many billions of dollars advertising
 

3093
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,910
many billions of dollars advertising
every year but nonetheless manages to

3094
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:53,920
every year but nonetheless manages to
 

3095
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,150
every year but nonetheless manages to
make themselves invisible you have this

3096
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:56,160
make themselves invisible you have this
 

3097
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,470
make themselves invisible you have this
powerful agent that is producing

3098
00:56:58,470 --> 00:56:58,480
powerful agent that is producing
 

3099
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,109
powerful agent that is producing
producing this engine of death

3100
00:57:01,109 --> 00:57:01,119
producing this engine of death
 

3101
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:03,349
producing this engine of death
that

3102
00:57:03,349 --> 00:57:03,359
that
 

3103
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:05,109
that
is invisible it's been reduced to the

3104
00:57:05,109 --> 00:57:05,119
is invisible it's been reduced to the
 

3105
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:06,870
is invisible it's been reduced to the
fish that move themselves in other words

3106
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:06,880
fish that move themselves in other words
 

3107
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,950
fish that move themselves in other words
there's not really a tobacco industry

3108
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:08,960
there's not really a tobacco industry
 

3109
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,470
there's not really a tobacco industry
there's just people who smoke and that's

3110
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:10,480
there's just people who smoke and that's
 

3111
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,789
there's just people who smoke and that's
a personal choice like what food we're

3112
00:57:12,789 --> 00:57:12,799
a personal choice like what food we're
 

3113
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:14,950
a personal choice like what food we're
going to have for dinner tonight and

3114
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:14,960
going to have for dinner tonight and
 

3115
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:19,430
going to have for dinner tonight and
so it's erased from the policy world

3116
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:19,440
so it's erased from the policy world
 

3117
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,910
so it's erased from the policy world
it's as if it doesn't exist

3118
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:21,920
it's as if it doesn't exist
 

3119
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,990
it's as if it doesn't exist
and creating that sense of invisibility

3120
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:26,000
and creating that sense of invisibility
 

3121
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,750
and creating that sense of invisibility
to failure to understand the causes of

3122
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:27,760
to failure to understand the causes of
 

3123
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,910
to failure to understand the causes of
causes

3124
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:29,920
causes
 

3125
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,950
causes
is what allows the epidemic to continue

3126
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:32,960
is what allows the epidemic to continue
 

3127
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:33,750

4101
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:07,750
there was smoking on it originally
and then there were ashtrays

4102
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:07,760
and then there were ashtrays
 

4103
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,669
and then there were ashtrays
and even today

4104
01:15:09,669 --> 01:15:09,679
and even today
 

4105
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:12,550
and even today
every plane by law has to have ashtrays

4106
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:12,560
every plane by law has to have ashtrays
 

4107
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,470
every plane by law has to have ashtrays
in the bathrooms because people still

4108
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:14,480
in the bathrooms because people still
 

4109
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:16,630
in the bathrooms because people still
smoke in the planes

4110
01:15:16,630 --> 01:15:16,640
smoke in the planes
 

4111
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:18,149
smoke in the planes
there's a special technique they have

4112
01:15:18,149 --> 01:15:18,159
there's a special technique they have
 

4113
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:20,070
there's a special technique they have
where they go in and

4114
01:15:20,070 --> 01:15:20,080
where they go in and
 

4115
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:21,669
where they go in and
light up your cigarette and put your

4116
01:15:21,669 --> 01:15:21,679
light up your cigarette and put your
 

4117
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:22,950
light up your cigarette and put your
mouth right down in the middle of the

4118
01:15:22,950 --> 01:15:22,960
mouth right down in the middle of the
 

4119
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,870
mouth right down in the middle of the
toilet and then flush it right at that

4120
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:24,880
toilet and then flush it right at that
 

4121
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,070
toilet and then flush it right at that
same moment

4122
01:15:26,070 --> 01:15:26,080
same moment
 

4123
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,590
same moment
and that's why they're i think it's a

4124
01:15:27,590 --> 01:15:27,600
and that's why they're i think it's a
 

4125
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,830
and that's why they're i think it's a
good big puff

4126
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:29,840
good big puff
 

4127
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,590
good big puff
puff and flush it

4128
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:31,600
puff and flush it
 

4129
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,350
puff and flush it
and to prevent people from bringing down

4130
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:33,360
and to prevent people from bringing down
 

4131
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:35,110
and to prevent people from bringing down
the plane by putting the cigarette out

4132
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:35,120
the plane by putting the cigarette out
 

4133
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:36,709
the plane by putting the cigarette out
in the trash

4134
01:15:36,709 --> 01:15:36,719
in the trash
 

4135
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:38,950
in the trash
every plane must have ashtrays

4136
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:38,960
every plane must have ashtrays
 

4137
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,229
every plane must have ashtrays
so that tells you something about the

4138
01:15:40,229 --> 01:15:40,239
so that tells you something about the
 

4139
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:43,430
so that tells you something about the
power of addiction the power of normalcy

4140
01:15:43,430 --> 01:15:43,440
power of addiction the power of normalcy
 

4141
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:46,310
power of addiction the power of normalcy
and it's related to your question of

4142
01:15:46,310 --> 01:15:46,320
and it's related to your question of
 

4143
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,390
and it's related to your question of
this this crucial moment if you can no

4144
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:48,400
this this crucial moment if you can no
 

4145
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,390
this this crucial moment if you can no
longer smoke in a bar if you can no

longer smoke in a bar if you can no
 

4147
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,910
longer smoke in a bar if you can no
longer smell and by the way that's

4148
01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:51,920
longer smell and by the way that's
 

4149
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,910
longer smell and by the way that's
different from drinking

4150
01:15:53,910 --> 01:15:53,920
different from drinking
 

4151
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:57,350
different from drinking

there are some addicts you know five

4160
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:03,920
there are some addicts you know five
 

4161
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:07,430
there are some addicts you know five
percent we say but you're talking about

4162
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:07,440
percent we say but you're talking about
 

4163
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,910
percent we say but you're talking about
70 80 90 of people who smoke cigarettes

01:16:09,910 --> 01:16:09,920
70 80 90 of people who smoke cigarettes
 

4165
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:11,669
70 80 90 of people who smoke cigarettes
regularly or wish they did not and

4166
01:16:11,669 --> 01:16:11,679
regularly or wish they did not and
 

4167
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:14,149
regularly or wish they did not and
that's actually where i learned about

4168
01:16:14,149 --> 01:16:14,159
that's actually where i learned about
 

4169
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:15,189
that's actually where i learned about
uh

4170
01:16:15,189 --> 01:16:15,199
uh
 

4171
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:16,630
uh
the idea that we could get rid of

4172
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:16,640
the idea that we could get rid of
 

4173
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,630
the idea that we could get rid of
cigarettes entirely was just from

4174
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:18,640
cigarettes entirely was just from
 

4175
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,310
cigarettes entirely was just from
talking to ordinary smokers those are

4176
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:20,320
talking to ordinary smokers those are
 

4177
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:21,830
talking to ordinary smokers those are
the people

4178

the people
 

4179
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:22,709
the people
who

4180
01:16:22,709 --> 01:16:22,719
who
 

4181
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:24,630
who
are willing to say you know let's let's

are willing to say you know let's let's
 

4183
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,950
are willing to say you know let's let's
get let's get cigarettes all together

4184
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:26,960
get let's get cigarettes all together
 

4185
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:28,310
get let's get cigarettes all together
and get rid of them all together because

4186
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:28,320
and get rid of them all together because
 

4187
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,310
and get rid of them all together because
it's not a recreational drug it's very

it's not a recreational drug it's very
 

4189
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,790
it's not a recreational drug it's very
different from alcohol and the genius of

01:16:32,790 --> 01:16:32,800
different from alcohol and the genius of
 

4191
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:35,189
different from alcohol and the genius of
of the alc of the tobacco industry is to

4192
01:16:35,189 --> 01:16:35,199
of the alc of the tobacco industry is to
 

4193
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:36,550
of the alc of the tobacco industry is to
turn

basic to trivialize addiction into just

4196
01:16:38,709 --> 01:16:38,719
basic to trivialize addiction into just
 

4197
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,310
basic to trivialize addiction into just
something we all like

4198
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:40,320
something we all like
 

4199
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,950
something we all like
it's addictive i like it

4200
01:16:42,950 --> 01:16:42,960
it's addictive i like it
 

4201
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:45,189
it's addictive i like it
and also to say that basically smoking

4202
01:16:45,189 --> 01:16:45,199
and also to say that basically smoking
 

4203
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:48,229
and also to say that basically smoking
is like drinking which in fact it's not

4204
01:16:48,229 --> 01:16:48,239
is like drinking which in fact it's not
 

4205
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:51,030
is like drinking which in fact it's not
alcohol tends to be a recreational drug

4206
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:51,040
alcohol tends to be a recreational drug
 

4207
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:51,910
alcohol tends to be a recreational drug
and

4208
01:16:51,910 --> 01:16:51,920
and
 

4209
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:55,669
and
cigarettes are more like heroin

4210
01:16:55,669 --> 01:16:55,679

 

4211
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,790

so

4212
01:16:56,790 --> 01:16:56,800
so
 

4213
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:59,510
so
how do we get that 200 billion down

4214
01:16:59,510 --> 01:16:59,520
how do we get that 200 billion down
 

4215
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,030
how do we get that 200 billion down
closer to zero

4216
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:01,040
closer to zero
 

4217
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,950
closer to zero
well the good news and i know you like

4218
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:02,960
well the good news and i know you like
 

4219
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,270
well the good news and i know you like
good news and i i do too

4220
01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:05,280
good news and i i do too
 

4221
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:08,149
good news and i i do too
is that every year

4222
01:17:08,149 --> 01:17:08,159
is that every year
 

4223
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:10,390
is that every year
we have about eight billion fewer

4224
01:17:10,390 --> 01:17:10,400
we have about eight billion fewer
 

4225
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,709
we have about eight billion fewer
cigarettes smoked in the united states

4226
01:17:12,709 --> 01:17:12,719
cigarettes smoked in the united states
 

4227
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:13,830
cigarettes smoked in the united states
so

4228
01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:13,840
so
 

4229
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,990
so
we're going in the right direction we're

4230
01:17:15,990 --> 01:17:16,000
we're going in the right direction we're
 

4231
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,070
we're going in the right direction we're
going to solve this you know they're not

4232
01:17:18,070 --> 01:17:18,080
going to solve this you know they're not
 

4233
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:19,830
going to solve this you know they're not
every problem you can solve in the world

4234
01:17:19,830 --> 01:17:19,840
every problem you can solve in the world
 

4235
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:22,470
every problem you can solve in the world
this is a very solvable problem it's an

4236
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:22,480
this is a very solvable problem it's an
 

4237
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:24,870
this is a very solvable problem it's an

01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:28,400

4241
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,030

much more invisible than covet

4242
01:17:31,030 --> 01:17:31,040
much more invisible than covet
 

4243
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:33,110
much more invisible than covet
but very solvable and actually will be

4244
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:33,120
but very solvable and actually will be
 

4245
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:33,990
but very solvable and actually will be
solved

4246
01:17:33,990 --> 01:17:34,000
solved
 

4247
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,510
solved
probably because of

4248
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:35,520
probably because of
 

4249
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:37,270
probably because of
of climate change because we're going to

01:17:39,669 --> 01:17:39,679
need to find ways to

reduce carbon footprints across the
 

4255
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:43,430
reduce carbon footprints across the
board and that's going to be a

4256
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:43,440
board and that's going to be a
 

4257
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,270
board and that's going to be a
a kind of uh

4258
01:17:45,270 --> 01:17:45,280
a kind of uh
 

4259
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,669
a kind of uh
cultural revolution of sorts

4260
01:17:47,669 --> 01:17:47,679
cultural revolution of sorts
 

4261
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:50,229
cultural revolution of sorts

and i remember
 

4675
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,030
and i remember
finding a

of six million jews using that language
how could this be you know i researched

4684
01:25:30,629 --> 01:25:30,639
how could this be you know i researched
 

4685
01:25:30,639 --> 01:25:32,390
how could this be you know i researched
it was i thought it wasn't even real and

4686
01:25:32,390 --> 01:25:32,400
it was i thought it wasn't even real and
 

4687
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:33,750
it was i thought it wasn't even real and
so i went and actually got the original

4688
01:25:33,750 --> 01:25:33,760
so i went and actually got the original

it's just one of those oddities

4692
01:25:38,229 --> 01:25:38,239
it's just one of those oddities
 

4693
01:25:38,239 --> 01:25:39,590
it's just one of those oddities
of

4694
01:25:39,590 --> 01:25:39,600
of
 

4695
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:42,550
of
life that just happens just weird stuff

4696
01:25:42,550 --> 01:25:42,560
life that just happens just weird stuff
 

4697
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:44,149
life that just happens just weird stuff
happens right

4698
01:25:44,149 --> 01:25:44,159
happens right
 

4699
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:45,830
happens right
that's the source of conspiracy theories

4700
01:25:45,830 --> 01:25:45,840
that's the source of conspiracy theories
 

4701
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,229
that's the source of conspiracy theories
right exactly uh so weird stuff happens

4702
01:25:48,229 --> 01:25:48,239
right exactly uh so weird stuff happens
 

4703
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:50,709
right exactly uh so weird stuff happens
but you know there's a inkling

4704
01:25:50,709 --> 01:25:50,719
but you know there's a inkling
 

4705
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:52,229
but you know there's a inkling
you know that

4706
01:25:52,229 --> 01:25:52,239
you know that
 

4707
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:53,590
you know that
that couldn't have been written in

4708
01:25:53,590 --> 01:25:53,600
that couldn't have been written in
 

4709
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,350
that couldn't have been written in
another time in history it was much less

4710
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:55,360
another time in history it was much less
 

4711
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,189
another time in history it was much less
likely that little coincidence to have

4712
01:25:57,189 --> 01:25:57,199
likely that little coincidence to have
 

4713
01:25:57,199 --> 01:25:59,350
likely that little coincidence to have
happened in another so it has uh some

4714
01:25:59,350 --> 01:25:59,360
happened in another so it has uh some
 

4715
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:00,790
happened in another so it has uh some
kind of

4716
01:26:00,790 --> 01:26:00,800
kind of
 

4717
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:01,990
kind of
resonance

4718
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:02,000
resonance
 

4719
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,310
resonance
with something yeah that captures

4720
01:26:04,310 --> 01:26:04,320
with something yeah that captures
 

4721
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:06,470
with something yeah that captures
something deep to the culture yeah

4722
01:26:06,470 --> 01:26:06,480
something deep to the culture yeah
 

4723
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:08,149
something deep to the culture yeah
that's why i'm interested in probing i

4724
01:26:08,149 --> 01:26:08,159
that's why i'm interested in probing i
 

4725
01:26:08,159 --> 01:26:09,910
that's why i'm interested in probing i
mean history is about seeing the

4726
01:26:09,910 --> 01:26:09,920
mean history is about seeing the

01:26:11,590 --> 01:26:11,600
universal through the particular in a
 

4729
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:13,510
universal through the particular in a
way and so you look for the weird

4730
01:26:13,510 --> 01:26:13,520
way and so you look for the weird
 

4731
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:15,189
way and so you look for the weird
particular and then pull at that string

4732
01:26:15,189 --> 01:26:15,199
particular and then pull at that string
 

4733
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:16,790
particular and then pull at that string
to see if there's something there is it

4734
01:26:16,790 --> 01:26:16,800
to see if there's something there is it
 

4735
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:19,590
to see if there's something there is it
that weird you know i i did a project i

4736

4903
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:11,990
and
you know we we create an image of nazism

4904
01:29:11,990 --> 01:29:12,000
you know we we create an image of nazism
 

4905
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,470
you know we we create an image of nazism
which is this fantasy image yeah and

4906
01:29:16,470 --> 01:29:16,480
which is this fantasy image yeah and
 

4907
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:18,149
which is this fantasy image yeah and
you know they're human beings making

4908
01:29:18,149 --> 01:29:18,159
you know they're human beings making
 

4909
01:29:18,159 --> 01:29:20,390
you know they're human beings making
these decisions

4910
01:29:20,390 --> 01:29:20,400
these decisions
 

4911
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:22,149
these decisions
and when it's tied to things like

4912
01:29:22,149 --> 01:29:22,159
and when it's tied to things like
 

4913
01:29:22,159 --> 01:29:24,950
and when it's tied to things like
removing cancer so you're saying they

4914
01:29:24,950 --> 01:29:24,960
removing cancer so you're saying they
 

4915
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:25,830
removing cancer so you're saying they
kind of

4916
01:29:25,830 --> 01:29:25,840
kind of
 

4917
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:28,390
kind of
the the effort of purification walks

4918
01:29:28,390 --> 01:29:28,400
the the effort of purification walks
 

4919
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:31,030
the the effort of purification walks
alongside with this effort of

4920
01:29:31,030 --> 01:29:31,040
alongside with this effort of
 

4921
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:33,590
alongside with this effort of
fighting cancer and then the final the

4922
01:29:33,590 --> 01:29:33,600
fighting cancer and then the final the
 

4923
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,110
fighting cancer and then the final the
difficult

4924
01:29:35,110 --> 01:29:35,120
difficult
 

4925
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:37,750

truth here is that there's a lot of

4926
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:37,760
truth here is that there's a lot of
 

4927
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:39,910
truth here is that there's a lot of

innovation
 

4929
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:41,590

4933
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:47,750
scientific innovation on fighting cancer
it's not a bunch of blind robots

4934
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:47,760
it's not a bunch of blind robots

it's a period of massive innovation
 

4939

it's a period of massive innovation
i mean they declared this

4940
01:29:56,629 --> 01:29:56,639
i mean they declared this
 

4941
01:29:56,639 --> 01:29:59,270
i mean they declared this
soybeans to be the official bean of the

about whole grain bread it's better than
you know so allegedly so far so far

4966
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:25,760
you know so allegedly so far so far
 

4967
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:27,510
you know so allegedly so far so far
that's what we think

4968
01:30:27,510 --> 01:30:27,520
that's what we think
 

4969
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:29,110
that's what we think
we'll discover eventually that bread is

4970
01:30:29,110 --> 01:30:29,120
we'll discover eventually that bread is
 

4971
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:30,950
we'll discover eventually that bread is
the thing that's killing us

4972
01:30:30,950 --> 01:30:30,960
the thing that's killing us
 

4973
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:34,629
the thing that's killing us
uh well by the way i'm eating mostly uh

uh well by the way i'm eating mostly uh
meat so mostly carnivore and that's been

4976
01:30:37,030 --> 01:30:37,040
meat so mostly carnivore and that's been
 

4977
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:38,550
meat so mostly carnivore and that's been
a discovery for me i don't care what

01:30:38,550 --> 01:30:38,560
a discovery for me i don't care what
 

4979
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:39,669
a discovery for me i don't care what
like

i'm not making a general statement about
 

4983
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,270
i'm not making a general statement about
the population but me personally how i

4984
01:30:43,270 --> 01:30:43,280
the population but me personally how i
 

4985
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:46,709
the population but me personally how i
feel i i like i've discovered fasting so

4986
01:30:46,709 --> 01:30:46,719
feel i i like i've discovered fasting so
 

4987
01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:49,030
feel i i like i've discovered fasting so
i often like on days like this when it's

4988
01:30:49,030 --> 01:30:49,040
i often like on days like this when it's
 

4989
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:50,470
i often like on days like this when it's
pretty stressful

4990
01:30:50,470 --> 01:30:50,480
pretty stressful
 

4991
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:54,310
pretty stressful
um i'll eat once a day and only meat or

4992
01:30:54,310 --> 01:30:54,320
um i'll eat once a day and only meat or
 

4993
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:56,790
um i'll eat once a day and only meat or
mostly meat and that's

4994
01:30:56,790 --> 01:30:56,800
mostly meat and that's
 

4995
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:59,510
mostly meat and that's
that's amazing to me from a scientific

4996
01:30:59,510 --> 01:30:59,520
that's amazing to me from a scientific
 

4997
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:02,149
that's amazing to me from a scientific
discovery perspective that that makes me

4998
01:31:02,149 --> 01:31:02,159
discovery perspective that that makes me
 

4999
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:04,790
discovery perspective that that makes me
feel way better

5000
01:31:04,790 --> 01:31:04,800
feel way better
 

5001
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,390
feel way better
you know there's not scientific support

5002
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:06,400
you know there's not scientific support
 

5003
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,629
you know there's not scientific support
why might make you feel but i don't care

5004
01:31:08,629 --> 01:31:08,639
why might make you feel but i don't care
 

5005
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:10,390
why might make you feel but i don't care
the point is i've done the experiments

5006
01:31:10,390 --> 01:31:10,400
the point is i've done the experiments
 

5007
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:12,149
the point is i've done the experiments
on the end of one

5008
01:31:12,149 --> 01:31:12,159
on the end of one
 

5009
01:31:12,159 --> 01:31:13,830
on the end of one
and it just makes me feel better well i

5010
01:31:13,830 --> 01:31:13,840
and it just makes me feel better well i
 

5011
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:16,629
and it just makes me feel better well i
think fasting is way undervalued

5012
01:31:16,629 --> 01:31:16,639
think fasting is way undervalued
 

5013
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:18,470
think fasting is way undervalued
i mean where do we get the idea you need

5014
01:31:18,470 --> 01:31:18,480
i mean where do we get the idea you need
 

5015
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:20,950
i mean where do we get the idea you need
three meals a day i have a friend at

5016
01:31:20,950 --> 01:31:20,960
three meals a day i have a friend at
 

5017
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:23,270
three meals a day i have a friend at
harvard and he he'll go seven or eight

5018
01:31:23,270 --> 01:31:23,280
harvard and he he'll go seven or eight
 

5019

days

5020
01:31:24,229 --> 01:31:24,239
days
 

5021
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:26,390
days
periodically without food he drinks

5022
01:31:26,390 --> 01:31:26,400
periodically without food he drinks
 

5023
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:27,990
periodically without food he drinks
water

5024
01:31:27,990 --> 01:31:28,000
water
 

5025
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,910
water
but he considers it a kind of

5026
01:31:29,910 --> 01:31:29,920
but he considers it a kind of
 

5027
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:32,149
but he considers it a kind of
purification and

5028
01:31:32,149 --> 01:31:32,159
purification and
 

5029
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:35,189
purification and
you know we're in a world where

5030
01:31:35,189 --> 01:31:35,199
you know we're in a world where
 

5031
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:37,669
you know we're in a world where
it's too easy to get food yeah we're in

5032
01:31:37,669 --> 01:31:37,679
it's too easy to get food yeah we're in
 

5033
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:39,270
it's too easy to get food yeah we're in
a world i mean most animals are living

5034
01:31:39,270 --> 01:31:39,280
a world i mean most animals are living
 

5035
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:40,709
a world i mean most animals are living
in a sense at the on the brink of

5036
01:31:40,709 --> 01:31:40,719
in a sense at the on the brink of
 

5037
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:44,950
in a sense at the on the brink of
starvation but we have technologies

5038
01:31:44,950 --> 01:31:44,960
starvation but we have technologies
 

5039
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:46,070
starvation but we have technologies
and

5040
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:46,080
and
 

5041
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:48,070
and
social conditions that allow

5042
01:31:48,070 --> 01:31:48,080
social conditions that allow
 

5043
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:48,950
social conditions that allow
it

5044
01:31:48,950 --> 01:31:48,960
it
 

5045
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:51,750
it
it's way too easy to to find a piece of

5046
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:51,760
it's way too easy to to find a piece of
 

5047
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:53,669
it's way too easy to to find a piece of
cake or a donut

01:31:53,669 --> 01:31:53,679
cake or a donut
 

5049
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:56,310
cake or a donut
and that's not something we evolved with

5050
01:31:56,310 --> 01:31:56,320
and that's not something we evolved with
 

5051
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:58,229
and that's not something we evolved with
we've been talking about purification in

5052
01:31:58,229 --> 01:31:58,239
we've been talking about purification in
 

5053
01:31:58,239 --> 01:31:59,750
we've been talking about purification in
that negative context but you know

5054
01:31:59,750 --> 01:31:59,760
that negative context but you know
 

5055
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:01,669
that negative context but you know
there's appealing ways of

5056
01:32:01,669 --> 01:32:01,679
there's appealing ways of
 

5057
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:02,470
there's appealing ways of
uh

5058
01:32:02,470 --> 01:32:02,480
uh
 

5059

of minimalism of removing things from

01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:04,320
of minimalism of removing things from
 

5061
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:06,790
of minimalism of removing things from
your life of of seeking

5062

your life of of seeking
 

5063
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:09,270
your life of of seeking

well
 

5243
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:17,109
well

and that little stand i mean that had an
 

5303
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:22,070
and that little stand i mean that had an
impact on me you know that the

5304
01:36:22,070 --> 01:36:22,080
impact on me you know that the
 

5305
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:24,870
impact on me you know that the
last at least it woke me up to

5306
01:36:24,870 --> 01:36:24,880
last at least it woke me up to

01:36:41,350 --> 01:36:41,360
i mean that's pure research some of the
 

5327
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:43,350
i mean that's pure research some of the
biggest discoveries like i didn't think

01:36:43,350 --> 01:36:43,360
biggest discoveries like i didn't think
 

5329
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:45,669
biggest discoveries like i didn't think
of it as military i thought of it as

5330
01:36:45,669 --> 01:36:45,679
of it as military i thought of it as
 

5331
01:36:45,679 --> 01:36:48,390
of it as military i thought of it as
engineering and science but then

5332

when the
 

5335
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:52,870
when the

drums of war start beating like
 

5337
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:55,510
drums of war start beating like
say in some future time

5338
01:36:55,510 --> 01:36:55,520
say in some future time

part of the world
and then all of a sudden all my widgets

5362
01:37:17,990 --> 01:37:18,000
and then all of a sudden all my widgets
 

5363
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,669
and then all of a sudden all my widgets
are being used for that that's why i've

5364
01:37:19,669 --> 01:37:19,679
are being used for that that's why i've
 

5365
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:21,669
are being used for that that's why i've
been waking up more and more

5366
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:21,679
been waking up more and more
 

5367
01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:23,430
been waking up more and more
to uh there's been something released

5368
01:37:23,430 --> 01:37:23,440
to uh there's been something released
 

5369
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:25,510
to uh there's been something released
called like the ai reports eric schmidt

5370
01:37:25,510 --> 01:37:25,520
called like the ai reports eric schmidt
 

5371
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:27,990
called like the ai reports eric schmidt
was one of the co-authors of it which is

5372
01:37:27,990 --> 01:37:28,000
was one of the co-authors of it which is
 

5373
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,390
was one of the co-authors of it which is
essentially saying that because china is

5374
01:37:30,390 --> 01:37:30,400
essentially saying that because china is
 

5375
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:33,109
essentially saying that because china is
developing autonomous weapons systems

5376
01:37:33,109 --> 01:37:33,119
developing autonomous weapons systems
 

5377
01:37:33,119 --> 01:37:35,669
developing autonomous weapons systems
us should not ban autonomous weapons

5378
01:37:35,669 --> 01:37:35,679
us should not ban autonomous weapons
 

5379
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:37,510
us should not ban autonomous weapons
systems and should also be doing it so

5380
01:37:37,510 --> 01:37:37,520
systems and should also be doing it so
 

5381
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:39,430
systems and should also be doing it so
basically put ai

5382
01:37:39,430 --> 01:37:39,440
basically put ai
 

5383
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:40,709
basically put ai
into our

5384
01:37:40,709 --> 01:37:40,719
into our
 

5385
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:43,350
into our
weapons of war and that

5386
01:37:43,350 --> 01:37:43,360
weapons of war and that
 

5387
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:46,149
weapons of war and that
that escalation that race is terrifying

5388
01:37:46,149 --> 01:37:46,159
that escalation that race is terrifying
 

5389
01:37:46,159 --> 01:37:47,590
that escalation that race is terrifying
uh just like all the things you

5390
01:37:47,590 --> 01:37:47,600
uh just like all the things you

and all those kinds of things yeah i
mean these have always been in the

6292
01:53:48,310 --> 01:53:48,320
mean these have always been in the
 

6293
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:49,990
mean these have always been in the
university

6294
01:53:49,990 --> 01:53:50,000
university
 

6295
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:53,270
university
when people have been most adamant

6296
01:53:53,270 --> 01:53:53,280
when people have been most adamant
 

6297
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:56,470
when people have been most adamant
in saying that science is a neutral

6298
01:53:56,470 --> 01:53:56,480

value free enterprise
 

6301
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:01,750
value free enterprise
it's times like the 1950s when there

6302
01:54:01,750 --> 01:54:01,760
it's times like the 1950s when there
 

6303
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:03,189
it's times like the 1950s when there
weren't blacks and there weren't even

6304
01:54:03,189 --> 01:54:03,199
weren't blacks and there weren't even
 

6305
01:54:03,199 --> 01:54:07,189
weren't blacks and there weren't even
women in universities so

6306
01:54:07,189 --> 01:54:07,199

 

6307
01:54:07,199 --> 01:54:09,430

what i discovered was that value

6308
01:54:09,430 --> 01:54:09,440
what i discovered was that value
 

6309
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:12,149
what i discovered was that value
neutrality or this ideology of that we

6310
01:54:12,149 --> 01:54:12,159
neutrality or this ideology of that we
 

6311
01:54:12,159 --> 01:54:14,870
neutrality or this ideology of that we
are value-free it really arose

6312
01:54:14,870 --> 01:54:14,880
are value-free it really arose
 

6313
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:17,030
are value-free it really arose
as a defensive shield

6314
01:54:17,030 --> 01:54:17,040
as a defensive shield
 

6315
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:19,510
as a defensive shield
to prevent

6316
01:54:19,510 --> 01:54:19,520
to prevent
 

6317
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:20,830

inclusion to prevent
 

6321
01:54:23,199 --> 01:54:24,790
inclusion to prevent
you know

6322
01:54:24,790 --> 01:54:24,800
you know
 

6323
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:26,310
you know
questioning of

6324
01:54:26,310 --> 01:54:26,320
questioning of
 

6325
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:28,470
questioning of
the priorities of science

6326
01:54:28,470 --> 01:54:28,480
the priorities of science
 

6327
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:30,390
the priorities of science
the practice of science the nature of

6328
01:54:30,390 --> 01:54:30,400
the practice of science the nature of
 

6329
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:32,070
the practice of science the nature of

6330
01:54:32,070 --> 01:54:32,080
science
 

6331
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:33,750
science
now we're in a period now i think of a

6332
01:54:33,750 --> 01:54:33,760
now we're in a period now i think of a
 

6333
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:36,470
now we're in a period now i think of a
kind of inclusive revolution where

6334
01:54:36,470 --> 01:54:36,480
kind of inclusive revolution where
 

6335
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:38,629
kind of inclusive revolution where
people are realizing well

6336
01:54:38,629 --> 01:54:38,639
people are realizing well
 

6337
01:54:38,639 --> 01:54:40,709
people are realizing well
we can't have

6338
01:54:40,709 --> 01:54:40,719
we can't have
 

6339
01:54:40,719 --> 01:54:43,750
we can't have
you know universities that look too much

6340
01:54:43,750 --> 01:54:43,760
you know universities that look too much
 

6341
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:45,350
you know universities that look too much
a certain way

6342
01:54:45,350 --> 01:54:45,360
a certain way
 

6343
01:54:45,360 --> 01:54:47,109
a certain way
there's probably going to be

6344
01:54:47,109 --> 01:54:47,119
there's probably going to be
 

6345
01:54:47,119 --> 01:54:48,870
there's probably going to be
in that omelette making you know there's

6346
01:54:48,870 --> 01:54:48,880
in that omelette making you know there's
 

6347
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:50,629
in that omelette making you know there's
going to be a few uh eggs that get

6348
01:54:50,629 --> 01:54:50,639
going to be a few uh eggs that get
 

6349
01:54:50,639 --> 01:54:51,910
going to be a few uh eggs that get
broken

6350
01:54:51,910 --> 01:54:51,920
broken
 

6351
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:53,589
broken
and uh

6352
01:54:53,589 --> 01:54:53,599
and uh
 

6353
01:54:53,599 --> 01:54:54,629
and uh
i think

6354
01:54:54,629 --> 01:54:54,639
i think
 

6355
01:54:54,639 --> 01:54:56,870
i think
people may exaggerate the extent to

6356
01:54:56,870 --> 01:54:56,880
people may exaggerate the extent to
 

6357
01:54:56,880 --> 01:54:58,470
people may exaggerate the extent to
which that's going in is it's definitely

6358
01:54:58,470 --> 01:54:58,480
which that's going in is it's definitely
 

6359
01:54:58,480 --> 01:55:00,310
which that's going in is it's definitely
real like cancer culture all those kinds

6360
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:00,320
real like cancer culture all those kinds
 

6361
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:03,750
real like cancer culture all those kinds
of things i mean it's definitely real

6362
01:55:03,750 --> 01:55:03,760
of things i mean it's definitely real
 

6363
01:55:03,760 --> 01:55:06,470
of things i mean it's definitely real
but it's also they're in a way it's also

6364
01:55:06,470 --> 01:55:06,480
but it's also they're in a way it's also
 

6365
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:07,910
but it's also they're in a way it's also
a distraction

6366
01:55:07,910 --> 01:55:07,920
a distraction
 

6367
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:09,030
a distraction

6571
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:39,350

we're jumping around a little bit but

6572
01:58:39,350 --> 01:58:39,360
we're jumping around a little bit but
 

6573
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:41,990
we're jumping around a little bit but
you i read you also do work on human

6574
01:58:41,990 --> 01:58:42,000
you i read you also do work on human
 

6575
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:43,910
you i read you also do work on human
origins so we we

6576
01:58:43,910 --> 01:58:43,920
origins so we we
 

6577
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:46,390
origins so we we
we mentioned this earlier let me ask

6578
01:58:46,390 --> 01:58:46,400
we mentioned this earlier let me ask
 

6579
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:48,870
we mentioned this earlier let me ask
another big philosophical question

6580
01:58:48,870 --> 01:58:48,880
another big philosophical question
 

6581
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:50,310
another big philosophical question
um

6582
01:58:50,310 --> 01:58:50,320
um
 

6583
01:58:50,320 --> 01:58:52,550
um
what what's human what makes us human

6584
01:58:52,550 --> 01:58:52,560
what what's human what makes us human
 

6585
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:54,629
what what's human what makes us human
what is human and uh

6586
01:58:54,629 --> 01:58:54,639
what is human and uh
 

6587
01:58:54,639 --> 01:58:57,270
what is human and uh
where did that humanness come from

6588
01:58:57,270 --> 01:58:57,280
where did that humanness come from
 

6589
01:58:57,280 --> 01:59:00,229
where did that humanness come from
that's exactly the question we need to

6590
01:59:00,229 --> 01:59:00,239
that's exactly the question we need to
 

6591
01:59:00,239 --> 01:59:02,709
that's exactly the question we need to
problematize because it's what i call

6592
01:59:02,709 --> 01:59:02,719
problematize because it's what i call
 

6593
01:59:02,719 --> 01:59:05,109
problematize because it's what i call
the gandhi question it's like

6594
01:59:05,109 --> 01:59:05,119
the gandhi question it's like
 

6595
01:59:05,119 --> 01:59:07,030
the gandhi question it's like
uh you know gandhi's ask what do you

6596

uh you know gandhi's ask what do you
think of western civilization and he

6598
01:59:09,030 --> 01:59:09,040
think of western civilization and he
 

6599
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:11,589
think of western civilization and he
says it would be a good idea

6600
01:59:11,589 --> 01:59:11,599
says it would be a good idea
 

6601
01:59:11,599 --> 01:59:14,709
says it would be a good idea
you know and so when did humans evolve

6602
01:59:14,709 --> 01:59:14,719
you know and so when did humans evolve
 

6603
01:59:14,719 --> 01:59:16,790
you know and so when did humans evolve
you know well

6604
01:59:16,790 --> 01:59:16,800
you know well
 

6605
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:18,070
you know well
not yet

6606

not yet
 

6607
01:59:18,080 --> 01:59:18,950
not yet
so

6608
01:59:18,950 --> 01:59:18,960
so
 

6609
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:21,750
so
we don't talk about you know when did

6610
01:59:21,750 --> 01:59:21,760
we don't talk about you know when did
 

6611
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:23,510
we don't talk about you know when did
you know

6612

you know
 

6613
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:25,430
you know
we talk about the rise of modern

6614
01:59:25,430 --> 01:59:25,440
we talk about the rise of modern
 

6615
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:27,750

humanity

6616
01:59:27,750 --> 01:59:27,760
humanity
 

6617
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:29,589
humanity
and what's happened in the last

and what's happened in the last
 

6619
01:59:29,599 --> 01:59:31,510
and what's happened in the last
50 or 60 years or so which i think is a

01:59:31,510 --> 01:59:31,520
50 or 60 years or so which i think is a
 

6621
01:59:31,520 --> 01:59:33,990
50 or 60 years or so which i think is a
good thing intellectually is that we've

6622
01:59:33,990 --> 01:59:34,000
good thing intellectually is that we've
 

6623
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:37,030
good thing intellectually is that we've
smeared out humanness to mean many

6624
01:59:37,030 --> 01:59:37,040
smeared out humanness to mean many
 

6625
01:59:37,040 --> 01:59:39,430
smeared out humanness to mean many
different things it's not just tool use

6626
01:59:39,430 --> 01:59:39,440
different things it's not just tool use
 

6627
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:41,750
different things it's not just tool use
it's not just upright posture upright

6628

tool use goes back at least two and a
 

6635
01:59:46,719 --> 01:59:49,109
tool use goes back at least two and a
half million years stone two years but

6636
01:59:49,109 --> 01:59:49,119
half million years stone two years but
 

6637
01:59:49,119 --> 01:59:52,149
half million years stone two years but
since wasps and chimpanzees use tools

6638
01:59:52,149 --> 01:59:52,159
since wasps and chimpanzees use tools
 

6639
01:59:52,159 --> 01:59:54,790
since wasps and chimpanzees use tools
then it's got to be even older

6640
01:59:54,790 --> 01:59:54,800
then it's got to be even older
 

6641
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:56,070
then it's got to be even older
so that that's actually one of the

so that that's actually one of the
 

6643
01:59:56,080 --> 01:59:58,390
so that that's actually one of the

02:00:48,639 --> 02:00:50,950
this particular fossil we've just found
was anything less than fully human

6694
02:00:50,950 --> 02:00:50,960
was anything less than fully human
 

6695
02:00:50,960 --> 02:00:53,189
was anything less than fully human
so there's a projection of humanness

6696
02:00:53,189 --> 02:00:53,199
so there's a projection of humanness
 

6697
02:00:53,199 --> 02:00:55,189
so there's a projection of humanness
arbitrarily back

6698
02:00:55,189 --> 02:00:55,199
arbitrarily back
 

6699
02:00:55,199 --> 02:00:57,350
arbitrarily back
into the past

6700
02:00:57,350 --> 02:00:57,360
into the past
 

6701
02:00:57,360 --> 02:00:59,350
into the past
so that even these little monkey-like

6702
02:00:59,350 --> 02:00:59,360
so that even these little monkey-like
 

6703
02:00:59,360 --> 02:01:00,870
so that even these little monkey-like
creatures ramapithe scenes

6704
02:01:00,870 --> 02:01:00,880
creatures ramapithe scenes
 

6705
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:02,950
creatures ramapithe scenes
rhombopithicus were being declared to

6706
02:01:02,950 --> 02:01:02,960
rhombopithicus were being declared to
 

6707
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:05,189
rhombopithicus were being declared to
have folkways and mores and language

6708
02:01:05,189 --> 02:01:05,199
have folkways and mores and language
 

6709
02:01:05,199 --> 02:01:07,270
have folkways and mores and language
which is ridiculous

6710
02:01:07,270 --> 02:01:07,280
which is ridiculous
 

6711
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:08,470
which is ridiculous
no one want to be

6712
02:01:08,470 --> 02:01:08,480
no one want to be
 

6713
02:01:08,480 --> 02:01:10,149
no one want to be
one to say that neanderthals were

6714
02:01:10,149 --> 02:01:10,159
one to say that neanderthals were
 

6715
02:01:10,159 --> 02:01:12,149
one to say that neanderthals were
anything less than fully human so it's a

6716
02:01:12,149 --> 02:01:12,159
anything less than fully human so it's a
 

6717
02:01:12,159 --> 02:01:14,629
anything less than fully human so it's a
very interesting question

6718
02:01:14,629 --> 02:01:14,639
very interesting question
 

6719
02:01:14,639 --> 02:01:17,669
very interesting question
at what point are they us i mean human

6720
02:01:17,669 --> 02:01:17,679
at what point are they us i mean human
 

6721
02:01:17,679 --> 02:01:19,830
at what point are they us i mean human
origins is very much an identity quest

6722
02:01:19,830 --> 02:01:19,840
origins is very much an identity quest
 

6723
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:22,550
origins is very much an identity quest
it's when did we become us which sort of

6724
02:01:22,550 --> 02:01:22,560
it's when did we become us which sort of
 

6725
02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:25,589
it's when did we become us which sort of
begs the question what are we who are we

6726
02:01:25,589 --> 02:01:25,599
begs the question what are we who are we
 

6727
02:01:25,599 --> 02:01:27,990
begs the question what are we who are we
um and how much is that is the hardware

6728
02:01:27,990 --> 02:01:28,000
um and how much is that is the hardware
 

6729
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:29,750
um and how much is that is the hardware
evolution question and versus the

6730
02:01:29,750 --> 02:01:29,760
evolution question and versus the
 

6731
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:32,070
evolution question and versus the
software like what

6732
02:01:32,070 --> 02:01:32,080
software like what
 

6733
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:34,550
software like what
the actual development of society like

6734
02:01:34,550 --> 02:01:34,560
the actual development of society like
 

6735
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:37,589
the actual development of society like
can't you argue that we became human

6736
02:01:37,589 --> 02:01:37,599
can't you argue that we became human
 

6737
02:01:37,599 --> 02:01:39,830
can't you argue that we became human
with uh with agriculture

6738
02:01:39,830 --> 02:01:39,840
with uh with agriculture
 

6739
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:41,430
with uh with agriculture
i mean can't you argue that we became

6740
02:01:41,430 --> 02:01:41,440
i mean can't you argue that we became
 

6741
02:01:41,440 --> 02:01:43,350
i mean can't you argue that we became
human with the industrial revolution

6742
02:01:43,350 --> 02:01:43,360
human with the industrial revolution
 

6743
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:45,910
human with the industrial revolution
well certainly by then

6744
02:01:45,910 --> 02:01:45,920
well certainly by then
 

6745
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:47,510
well certainly by then
they are us

6746
02:01:47,510 --> 02:01:47,520
they are us
 

6747
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:48,470
they are us
but

6748
02:01:48,470 --> 02:01:48,480
but
 

6749
02:01:48,480 --> 02:01:50,709
but
agriculture is only 12 000 years ago

6750
02:01:50,709 --> 02:01:50,719
agriculture is only 12 000 years ago
 

6751
02:01:50,719 --> 02:01:52,550
agriculture is only 12 000 years ago
that's a blink in the eye right that's

6752
02:01:52,550 --> 02:01:52,560
that's a blink in the eye right that's
 

6753
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:54,070
that's a blink in the eye right that's
that's yesterday

6754
02:01:54,070 --> 02:01:54,080
that's yesterday
 

6755
02:01:54,080 --> 02:01:55,830
that's yesterday
it's interesting prior to the 19th

6756
02:01:55,830 --> 02:01:55,840
it's interesting prior to the 19th
 

6757
02:01:55,840 --> 02:01:57,189
it's interesting prior to the 19th
century

6758
02:01:57,189 --> 02:01:57,199
century
 

6759
02:01:57,199 --> 02:01:59,189
century
most scholars thought that the pyramids

6760
02:01:59,189 --> 02:01:59,199
most scholars thought that the pyramids
 

6761
02:01:59,199 --> 02:02:01,030
most scholars thought that the pyramids
were at the beginning of time

6762
02:02:01,030 --> 02:02:01,040
were at the beginning of time
 

6763
02:02:01,040 --> 02:02:02,390
were at the beginning of time
essentially they were closer to the

6764
02:02:02,390 --> 02:02:02,400
essentially they were closer to the
 

6765
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:03,990
essentially they were closer to the
beginning of time than they are to us

6766
02:02:03,990 --> 02:02:04,000
beginning of time than they are to us
 

6767
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:04,950
beginning of time than they are to us
now

6768
02:02:04,950 --> 02:02:04,960
now
 

6769
02:02:04,960 --> 02:02:06,229
now
it's a blink in the eye you know we use

6770
02:02:06,229 --> 02:02:06,239
it's a blink in the eye you know we use
 

6771
02:02:06,239 --> 02:02:08,310
it's a blink in the eye you know we use
the metaphor of a meter you know the

6772
02:02:08,310 --> 02:02:08,320
the metaphor of a meter you know the
 

6773
02:02:08,320 --> 02:02:10,470
the metaphor of a meter you know the
earth is 5 billion

6774
02:02:10,470 --> 02:02:10,480
earth is 5 billion
 

6775
02:02:10,480 --> 02:02:14,149
earth is 5 billion
so that's a meter

6776
02:02:14,149 --> 02:02:14,159

 

6777
02:02:14,159 --> 02:02:16,790

the natural history of upright humans is

6778
02:02:16,790 --> 02:02:16,800
the natural history of upright humans is
 

6779
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:19,189
the natural history of upright humans is
5 million so that's

6780
02:02:19,189 --> 02:02:19,199
5 million so that's
 

6781
02:02:19,199 --> 02:02:21,430
5 million so that's
that would be like one millimeter this

6782
02:02:21,430 --> 02:02:21,440
that would be like one millimeter this
 

6783
02:02:21,440 --> 02:02:23,669
that would be like one millimeter this
would be the thickness of the white

6784
02:02:23,669 --> 02:02:23,679
would be the thickness of the white
 

6785
02:02:23,679 --> 02:02:25,830
would be the thickness of the white
of your fingernail

6786
02:02:25,830 --> 02:02:25,840
of your fingernail
 

6787
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:28,229
of your fingernail
and then the pyramids are five thousand

6788
02:02:28,229 --> 02:02:28,239
and then the pyramids are five thousand
 

6789
02:02:28,239 --> 02:02:29,270
and then the pyramids are five thousand
so that's

6790
02:02:29,270 --> 02:02:29,280
so that's
 

6791
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:31,430
so that's
a thousandth

6792
02:02:31,430 --> 02:02:31,440
a thousandth
 

6793
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:34,070
a thousandth
of a millimeter a micron which is the

6794
02:02:34,070 --> 02:02:34,080
of a millimeter a micron which is the
 

6795
02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:35,589
of a millimeter a micron which is the
amount taken off

6796
02:02:35,589 --> 02:02:35,599
amount taken off
 

6797
02:02:35,599 --> 02:02:37,750
amount taken off
when you brush your

6798
02:02:37,750 --> 02:02:37,760
when you brush your
 

6799
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:39,589
when you brush your
fingers on your

6800
02:02:39,589 --> 02:02:39,599
fingers on your
 

6801
02:02:39,599 --> 02:02:40,870
fingers on your
your jacket

6802
02:02:40,870 --> 02:02:40,880
your jacket
 

6803
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:43,030
your jacket
so

6804
02:02:43,030 --> 02:02:43,040
so
 

6805
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:45,430
so
the there's a natural history of

6806
02:02:45,430 --> 02:02:45,440
the there's a natural history of
 

6807
02:02:45,440 --> 02:02:47,189
the there's a natural history of
humanity and then there's the history of

6808
02:02:47,189 --> 02:02:47,199
humanity and then there's the history of
 

6809
02:02:47,199 --> 02:02:50,149
humanity and then there's the history of
our constituents we're all stardust

6810
02:02:50,149 --> 02:02:50,159
our constituents we're all stardust
 

6811
02:02:50,159 --> 02:02:52,709
our constituents we're all stardust
because all of our complex atoms began

6812
02:02:52,709 --> 02:02:52,719
because all of our complex atoms began
 

6813
02:02:52,719 --> 02:02:53,430
because all of our complex atoms began

6817
02:02:55,119 --> 02:02:58,149

many billions of years ago

6818
02:02:58,149 --> 02:02:58,159
many billions of years ago
 

6819
02:02:58,159 --> 02:02:59,430
many billions of years ago
but

6820
02:02:59,430 --> 02:02:59,440
but
 

6821
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:02,390
but
upright posture 5 million

6822
02:03:02,390 --> 02:03:02,400
upright posture 5 million
 

6823
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:05,350
upright posture 5 million
agriculture only a few thousand

6824
02:03:05,350 --> 02:03:05,360
agriculture only a few thousand
 

6825
02:03:05,360 --> 02:03:07,109
agriculture only a few thousand
years ago

02:03:07,109 --> 02:03:07,119
years ago
 

6827
02:03:07,119 --> 02:03:09,510
years ago
we cultivate dogs a couple hundred

6828
02:03:09,510 --> 02:03:09,520
we cultivate dogs a couple hundred
 

6829
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:10,790
we cultivate dogs a couple hundred
thousand years ago so those are

6830
02:03:10,790 --> 02:03:10,800
thousand years ago so those are
 

6831
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:12,870
thousand years ago so those are
paleolithic instruments cats are

6832
02:03:12,870 --> 02:03:12,880
paleolithic instruments cats are
 

6833
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:14,790
paleolithic instruments cats are
neolithic instruments because they're

6834
02:03:14,790 --> 02:03:14,800
neolithic instruments because they're
 

6835
02:03:14,800 --> 02:03:18,229
neolithic instruments because they're
used to kill vermin dogs are used to

6836
02:03:18,229 --> 02:03:18,239
used to kill vermin dogs are used to
 

6837
02:03:18,239 --> 02:03:20,709
used to kill vermin dogs are used to
to hunt with us

6838
02:03:20,709 --> 02:03:20,719
to hunt with us
 

6839
02:03:20,719 --> 02:03:21,990
to hunt with us
but there is what you say this

6840
02:03:21,990 --> 02:03:22,000
but there is what you say this
 

6841
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:25,589
but there is what you say this
co-evolution our social aspect yeah and

6842
02:03:25,589 --> 02:03:25,599
co-evolution our social aspect yeah and
 

6843
02:03:25,599 --> 02:03:28,149
co-evolution our social aspect yeah and
our physical aspect even the fact that

6844
02:03:28,149 --> 02:03:28,159
our physical aspect even the fact that
 

6845
02:03:28,159 --> 02:03:30,229
our physical aspect even the fact that
we have whites of the eyes we're the

6846
02:03:30,229 --> 02:03:30,239
we have whites of the eyes we're the
 

6847
02:03:30,239 --> 02:03:32,550
we have whites of the eyes we're the
only animal with whites of the eyes

6848
02:03:32,550 --> 02:03:32,560
only animal with whites of the eyes
 

6849
02:03:32,560 --> 02:03:35,270
only animal with whites of the eyes
and the whites of the eyes

6850
02:03:35,270 --> 02:03:35,280
and the whites of the eyes
 

6851
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:37,030
and the whites of the eyes
tell intent

6852
02:03:37,030 --> 02:03:37,040
tell intent
 

6853
02:03:37,040 --> 02:03:38,950
tell intent
they tell direction they tell interest

6854
02:03:38,950 --> 02:03:38,960
they tell direction they tell interest
 

6855
02:03:38,960 --> 02:03:40,390
they tell direction they tell interest
they know

6856
02:03:40,390 --> 02:03:40,400

resolution i can tell what you're
 

6865
02:03:46,480 --> 02:03:47,669
resolution i can tell what you're
looking at

6866
02:03:47,669 --> 02:03:47,679
looking at
 

6867
02:03:47,679 --> 02:03:49,350
looking at
that's recent

6868
02:03:49,350 --> 02:03:49,360
that's recent
 

6869
02:03:49,360 --> 02:03:51,510
that's recent
and

6870
02:03:51,510 --> 02:03:51,520
and
 

6871
02:03:51,520 --> 02:03:53,750
and
the people who do reconstruction for

02:03:58,310 --> 02:03:58,320
an ethnographic identity with the viewer
 

6877
02:03:58,320 --> 02:04:00,069
an ethnographic identity with the viewer
and so they

6878
02:04:00,069 --> 02:04:00,079
and so they
 

6879
02:04:00,079 --> 02:04:02,790
and so they
fantasize about all these other early

6880
02:04:02,790 --> 02:04:02,800
fantasize about all these other early
 

6881
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:06,149
fantasize about all these other early
hominids non-human pre-human hominids if

hominids non-human pre-human hominids if
that's a word

6884
02:04:07,669 --> 02:04:07,679
that's a word
 

6885
02:04:07,679 --> 02:04:09,750
that's a word
as having eyes like us but they probably

6886
02:04:09,750 --> 02:04:09,760
as having eyes like us but they probably
 

6887
02:04:09,760 --> 02:04:11,350
as having eyes like us but they probably
didn't

6888
02:04:11,350 --> 02:04:11,360
didn't
 

6889
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:14,229
didn't
and they were probably

6890
02:04:14,229 --> 02:04:14,239
and they were probably
 

6891
02:04:14,239 --> 02:04:15,910
and they were probably
not self-aware

6892
02:04:15,910 --> 02:04:15,920
not self-aware
 

6893
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:17,510
not self-aware
at least the early ones i can't have

6894
02:04:17,510 --> 02:04:17,520
at least the early ones i can't have
 

6895
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:19,430
at least the early ones i can't have
been self-aware the way we are insofar

6896
02:04:19,430 --> 02:04:19,440
been self-aware the way we are insofar
 

6897
02:04:19,440 --> 02:04:20,550
been self-aware the way we are insofar
as we are

6898
02:04:20,550 --> 02:04:20,560
as we are

they may not have spoke
 

6901
02:04:23,040 --> 02:04:25,830
they may not have spoke
so i'm interested in

6902
02:04:25,830 --> 02:04:25,840
so i'm interested in
 

6903
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:28,390
so i'm interested in
basically when did we become what we

6904
02:04:28,390 --> 02:04:28,400
basically when did we become what we
 

6905
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:31,030
basically when did we become what we
think is human it's clear that when we

6906
02:04:31,030 --> 02:04:31,040
think is human it's clear that when we
 

6907
02:04:31,040 --> 02:04:31,910
think is human it's clear that when we
start

6908
02:04:31,910 --> 02:04:31,920
start
 

6909
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:33,750
start
burying the dead and making jewel making

6910
02:04:33,750 --> 02:04:33,760
burying the dead and making jewel making
 

6911
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:36,550
burying the dead and making jewel making
jewelry and and

6912
02:04:36,550 --> 02:04:36,560
jewelry and and
 

6913
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:39,109
jewelry and and
when we in a sense invent fantasy

6914
02:04:39,109 --> 02:04:39,119
when we in a sense invent fantasy
 

6915
02:04:39,119 --> 02:04:42,550
when we in a sense invent fantasy
when we invent deception

6916
02:04:42,550 --> 02:04:42,560
when we invent deception
 

6917
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:43,990
when we invent deception
that's human that's full of human we

6918
02:04:43,990 --> 02:04:44,000
that's human that's full of human we
 

6919
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,350
that's human that's full of human we
become human

6920
02:04:45,350 --> 02:04:45,360
become human
 

6921
02:04:45,360 --> 02:04:46,790
become human
by

6922
02:04:46,790 --> 02:04:46,800
by
 

6923
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:49,030
by
thinking there's a world that really is

6924
02:04:49,030 --> 02:04:49,040
thinking there's a world that really is
 

6925
02:04:49,040 --> 02:04:49,990
thinking there's a world that really is
not

6926
02:04:49,990 --> 02:04:50,000
not
 

6927
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:51,510
not
i mean that's that feels like we're

6928
02:04:51,510 --> 02:04:51,520
i mean that's that feels like we're
 

6929
02:04:51,520 --> 02:04:52,950
i mean that's that feels like we're
starting to operate in the space of

6930
02:04:52,950 --> 02:04:52,960
starting to operate in the space of
 

6931
02:04:52,960 --> 02:04:55,830
starting to operate in the space of
ideas more and more so to have deception

6932
02:04:55,830 --> 02:04:55,840
ideas more and more so to have deception
 

6933
02:04:55,840 --> 02:04:57,510
ideas more and more so to have deception
to have imagination

6934
02:04:57,510 --> 02:04:57,520
to have imagination
 

6935
02:04:57,520 --> 02:04:59,589
to have imagination
you start to be able to have ideas and

6936
02:04:59,589 --> 02:04:59,599
you start to be able to have ideas and
 

6937
02:04:59,599 --> 02:05:01,270
you start to be able to have ideas and
share them and it feels like the sharing

6938
02:05:01,270 --> 02:05:01,280
share them and it feels like the sharing
 

6939
02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:02,870
share them and it feels like the sharing
is the thing that really develops the

6940
02:05:02,870 --> 02:05:02,880
is the thing that really develops the
 

6941
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:04,790
is the thing that really develops the
idea so it's not you come up with ideas

6942
02:05:04,790 --> 02:05:04,800
idea so it's not you come up with ideas
 

6943
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:07,030
idea so it's not you come up with ideas
and you we become able to sort of

6944
02:05:07,030 --> 02:05:07,040
and you we become able to sort of
 

6945
02:05:07,040 --> 02:05:09,430
and you we become able to sort of
understand what each other is thinking

6946
02:05:09,430 --> 02:05:09,440
understand what each other is thinking
 

6947
02:05:09,440 --> 02:05:11,189
understand what each other is thinking
some animals can do this to a certain

6948
02:05:11,189 --> 02:05:11,199
some animals can do this to a certain
 

6949
02:05:11,199 --> 02:05:13,750
some animals can do this to a certain
extent dogs have a certain empathy but

6950
02:05:13,750 --> 02:05:13,760
extent dogs have a certain empathy but
 

6951
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:15,669
extent dogs have a certain empathy but
it's it's limited it's highly limited

6952
02:05:15,669 --> 02:05:15,679
it's it's limited it's highly limited
 

6953
02:05:15,679 --> 02:05:17,510
it's it's limited it's highly limited
but you could probably argue that the

6954
02:05:17,510 --> 02:05:17,520
but you could probably argue that the
 

6955
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:19,669
but you could probably argue that the
dogs got that from the humans yeah i

6956
02:05:19,669 --> 02:05:19,679
dogs got that from the humans yeah i
 

6957
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:21,589
dogs got that from the humans yeah i
mean humans and dogs have co-evolved

6958
02:05:21,589 --> 02:05:21,599
mean humans and dogs have co-evolved
 

6959
02:05:21,599 --> 02:05:23,910
mean humans and dogs have co-evolved
have definitely co-evolved because it's

6960
02:05:23,910 --> 02:05:23,920
have definitely co-evolved because it's
 

6961
02:05:23,920 --> 02:05:26,149
have definitely co-evolved because it's
over a hundred thousand years we've been

6962
02:05:26,149 --> 02:05:26,159
over a hundred thousand years we've been
 

6963
02:05:26,159 --> 02:05:27,830
over a hundred thousand years we've been
working together there

6964
02:05:27,830 --> 02:05:27,840
working together there
 

6965
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:30,390
working together there
but but all our hands have evolved with

6966
02:05:30,390 --> 02:05:30,400
but but all our hands have evolved with
 

6967
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:31,910
but but all our hands have evolved with
tools

6968
02:05:31,910 --> 02:05:31,920
tools
 

6969
02:05:31,920 --> 02:05:33,830
tools
and so i'm trying to figure out now the

6970
02:05:33,830 --> 02:05:33,840
and so i'm trying to figure out now the
 

6971
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:35,750
and so i'm trying to figure out now the
original purpose is the purpose of a

6972
02:05:35,750 --> 02:05:35,760
original purpose is the purpose of a
 

6973
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:37,589
original purpose is the purpose of a
julian hand axis the old the first

6974
02:05:37,589 --> 02:05:37,599
julian hand axis the old the first
 

6975
02:05:37,599 --> 02:05:39,910
julian hand axis the old the first

beautiful tool made by humans which
 

6977
02:05:39,920 --> 02:05:41,830
beautiful tool made by humans which
were made unchanged what kind of axe is

6978
02:05:41,830 --> 02:05:41,840
were made unchanged what kind of axe is
 

6979
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:43,109
were made unchanged what kind of axe is
this they're called the shulian hand

6980
02:05:43,109 --> 02:05:43,119
this they're called the shulian hand
 

6981
02:05:43,119 --> 02:05:45,030
this they're called the shulian hand
axes they're the

6982
02:05:45,030 --> 02:05:45,040
axes they're the
 

6983
02:05:45,040 --> 02:05:47,430
axes they're the
these beautiful teardrop shaped

i mean
when did that originate just the

when did that originate just the
 

7401
02:13:07,760 --> 02:13:09,430
when did that originate just the
collection the

7402
02:13:09,430 --> 02:13:09,440
collection the
 

7403
02:13:09,440 --> 02:13:12,229
collection the
white it goes through different stages

7404
02:13:12,229 --> 02:13:12,239
white it goes through different stages
 

7405
02:13:12,239 --> 02:13:14,629
white it goes through different stages
people have always

7406
02:13:14,629 --> 02:13:14,639
people have always
 

7407
02:13:14,639 --> 02:13:16,470
people have always
gathered the odd thing

7408
02:13:16,470 --> 02:13:16,480
gathered the odd thing
 

7409
02:13:16,480 --> 02:13:18,870

that's part of the rise of natural
 

7443
02:13:50,480 --> 02:13:52,470
that's part of the rise of natural
history the idea you taxonomize the

7444
02:13:52,470 --> 02:13:52,480
history the idea you taxonomize the
 

7445
02:13:52,480 --> 02:13:54,310
history the idea you taxonomize the
world you classify the world you look

7446

world you classify the world you look
 

7447
02:13:54,320 --> 02:13:57,350
world you classify the world you look
for the rare object the rarity

7448
02:13:57,350 --> 02:13:57,360
for the rare object the rarity
 

7449
02:13:57,360 --> 02:13:59,430
for the rare object the rarity
and rarity still is a kind of virtue

7450
02:13:59,430 --> 02:13:59,440
and rarity still is a kind of virtue
 

7451
02:13:59,440 --> 02:14:01,030
and rarity still is a kind of virtue
like the recent

7452
02:14:01,030 --> 02:14:01,040
like the recent
 

7453
02:14:01,040 --> 02:14:02,550
like the recent
news about trying to figure out ball

7454
02:14:02,550 --> 02:14:02,560
news about trying to figure out ball
 

7455

lightning when i was growing up ball

7456
02:14:04,470 --> 02:14:04,480
lightning when i was growing up ball
 

7457
02:14:04,480 --> 02:14:06,550
lightning when i was growing up ball
lightning was the big question does it

7458
02:14:06,550 --> 02:14:06,560
lightning was the big question does it
 

7459
02:14:06,560 --> 02:14:09,030
lightning was the big question does it
exist does it not exist and now there's

7460
02:14:09,030 --> 02:14:09,040
exist does it not exist and now there's
 

7461
02:14:09,040 --> 02:14:10,629
exist does it not exist and now there's
new evidence of how it actually might

7462
02:14:10,629 --> 02:14:10,639
new evidence of how it actually might
 

7463
02:14:10,639 --> 02:14:12,390
new evidence of how it actually might
wait what really there's new evidence

7464
02:14:12,390 --> 02:14:12,400
wait what really there's new evidence
 

7465
02:14:12,400 --> 02:14:14,950
wait what really there's new evidence
yes yeah there's i grew up with that

7466
02:14:14,950 --> 02:14:14,960
yes yeah there's i grew up with that
 

7467
02:14:14,960 --> 02:14:17,030

02:14:17,030 --> 02:14:17,040
my dad when i was young told me i asked
 

7469
02:14:17,040 --> 02:14:19,030
my dad when i was young told me i asked
him like how do i win a nobel prize

7470
02:14:19,030 --> 02:14:19,040
him like how do i win a nobel prize
 

7471
02:14:19,040 --> 02:14:21,589
him like how do i win a nobel prize
he said uh invent a time machine or

7472
02:14:21,589 --> 02:14:21,599
he said uh invent a time machine or
 

7473
02:14:21,599 --> 02:14:23,750
he said uh invent a time machine or
figure out how ball lightning works

7474
02:14:23,750 --> 02:14:23,760
figure out how ball lightning works
 

7475
02:14:23,760 --> 02:14:26,310
figure out how ball lightning works
and so i got really excited i was like

7476
02:14:26,310 --> 02:14:26,320
and so i got really excited i was like
 

7477
02:14:26,320 --> 02:14:27,669
and so i got really excited i was like
damn it i'm gonna figure out how this

7478
02:14:27,669 --> 02:14:27,679
damn it i'm gonna figure out how this
 

7479
02:14:27,679 --> 02:14:29,030
damn it i'm gonna figure out how this
ball lightning works it's very

7480
02:14:29,030 --> 02:14:29,040
ball lightning works it's very
 

7481
02:14:29,040 --> 02:14:30,550
ball lightning works it's very
interesting from a history of science

7482
02:14:30,550 --> 02:14:30,560
interesting from a history of science
 

7483
02:14:30,560 --> 02:14:32,790
interesting from a history of science
point of view because it's so rare

7484
02:14:32,790 --> 02:14:32,800
point of view because it's so rare
 

7485
02:14:32,800 --> 02:14:34,950
point of view because it's so rare
that in a way it doesn't exist it you

7486
02:14:34,950 --> 02:14:34,960
that in a way it doesn't exist it you
 

7487
02:14:34,960 --> 02:14:36,870
that in a way it doesn't exist it you
can't replicate it you can't make it

7488
02:14:36,870 --> 02:14:36,880
can't replicate it you can't make it
 

7489
02:14:36,880 --> 02:14:38,790
can't replicate it you can't make it
does it really exist it's a little bit

7490
02:14:38,790 --> 02:14:38,800
does it really exist it's a little bit
 

7491
02:14:38,800 --> 02:14:40,470
does it really exist it's a little bit

02:14:46,480 --> 02:14:48,149
falls
as a result of a meteorite a meteorite

7502
02:14:48,149 --> 02:14:48,159
as a result of a meteorite a meteorite
 

7503
02:14:48,159 --> 02:14:50,069
as a result of a meteorite a meteorite
hits the earth blasts earth up into

7504
02:14:50,069 --> 02:14:50,079
hits the earth blasts earth up into
 

7505
02:14:50,079 --> 02:14:52,470
hits the earth blasts earth up into
space it falls back down

7506
02:14:52,470 --> 02:14:52,480
space it falls back down
 

7507
02:14:52,480 --> 02:14:55,350
space it falls back down
as a glass that's called a tectite and

7508
02:14:55,350 --> 02:14:55,360
as a glass that's called a tectite and
 

7509
02:14:55,360 --> 02:14:57,270
as a glass that's called a tectite and
there's a rare form of it called libyan

7510
02:14:57,270 --> 02:14:57,280
there's a rare form of it called libyan
 

7511
02:14:57,280 --> 02:14:58,550
there's a rare form of it called libyan
glass

7512
02:14:58,550 --> 02:14:58,560
glass
 

7513
02:14:58,560 --> 02:15:00,470
glass
which fell probably around 20 million

7514
02:15:00,470 --> 02:15:00,480
which fell probably around 20 million
 

7515
02:15:00,480 --> 02:15:02,950
which fell probably around 20 million
years ago and now works out of the

7516
02:15:02,950 --> 02:15:02,960
years ago and now works out of the
 

7517
02:15:02,960 --> 02:15:04,950
years ago and now works out of the
sahara every now and then it was the

7518
02:15:04,950 --> 02:15:04,960
sahara every now and then it was the
 

7519
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:06,830
sahara every now and then it was the
most valuable stone of

7520
02:15:06,830 --> 02:15:06,840
most valuable stone of
 

7521
02:15:06,840 --> 02:15:09,990
most valuable stone of
antiquity the centerpiece of tuttan

7522
02:15:09,990 --> 02:15:10,000
antiquity the centerpiece of tuttan
 

7523
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:11,990
antiquity the centerpiece of tuttan
kamon's breastplate is made of this

7524
02:15:11,990 --> 02:15:12,000
kamon's breastplate is made of this
 

7525
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:13,510
kamon's breastplate is made of this
beautiful yellow

7526
02:15:13,510 --> 02:15:13,520
beautiful yellow
 

7527
02:15:13,520 --> 02:15:16,390
beautiful yellow
gemstone libyan glass

7528
02:15:16,390 --> 02:15:16,400
gemstone libyan glass
 

7529
02:15:16,400 --> 02:15:17,189
gemstone libyan glass
so

7530
02:15:17,189 --> 02:15:17,199
so
 

7531
02:15:17,199 --> 02:15:19,270
so
rarity is something that

7532
02:15:19,270 --> 02:15:19,280
rarity is something that
 

7533
02:15:19,280 --> 02:15:21,589
rarity is something that
the hobbyists have always liked

7534
02:15:21,589 --> 02:15:21,599
the hobbyists have always liked
 

7535
02:15:21,599 --> 02:15:23,990
the hobbyists have always liked
to cherish the rarity the odds and

7536
02:15:23,990 --> 02:15:24,000
to cherish the rarity the odds and
 

7537
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:27,189
to cherish the rarity the odds and
science has a kind of often aversion

7538
02:15:27,189 --> 02:15:27,199
science has a kind of often aversion
 

7539
02:15:27,199 --> 02:15:29,109
science has a kind of often aversion
as a kind of a love-hate relationship

7540
02:15:29,109 --> 02:15:29,119
as a kind of a love-hate relationship
 

7541
02:15:29,119 --> 02:15:32,069
as a kind of a love-hate relationship
with rarity and novelty science is often

7542
02:15:32,069 --> 02:15:32,079
with rarity and novelty science is often
 

7543
02:15:32,079 --> 02:15:33,669
with rarity and novelty science is often
trying to pursue novelty to make

7544
02:15:33,669 --> 02:15:33,679
trying to pursue novelty to make
 

7545
02:15:33,679 --> 02:15:35,430
trying to pursue novelty to make
discoveries

7546
02:15:35,430 --> 02:15:35,440
discoveries
 

7547
02:15:35,440 --> 02:15:37,430
discoveries
but if you can't replicate it it's kind

7548
02:15:37,430 --> 02:15:37,440
but if you can't replicate it it's kind
 

7549
02:15:37,440 --> 02:15:39,750
but if you can't replicate it it's kind
of like well does it really exist yeah

7550
02:15:39,750 --> 02:15:39,760
of like well does it really exist yeah
 

7551
02:15:39,760 --> 02:15:42,229
of like well does it really exist yeah
which is why i mean ufos and aliens and

7552
02:15:42,229 --> 02:15:42,239
which is why i mean ufos and aliens and
 

7553
02:15:42,239 --> 02:15:43,430
which is why i mean ufos and aliens and
all those kinds there's a general

7554
02:15:43,430 --> 02:15:43,440
all those kinds there's a general
 

7555
02:15:43,440 --> 02:15:45,030
all those kinds there's a general
aversion to that because it's like it's

7556
02:15:45,030 --> 02:15:45,040
aversion to that because it's like it's
 

7557
02:15:45,040 --> 02:15:47,189
aversion to that because it's like it's
a one-time event

7558
02:15:47,189 --> 02:15:47,199
a one-time event
 

7559
02:15:47,199 --> 02:15:48,310
a one-time event
uh right

7560
02:15:48,310 --> 02:15:48,320
uh right
 

7561
02:15:48,320 --> 02:15:49,350
uh right
it's

7562
02:15:49,350 --> 02:15:49,360
it's
 

7563
02:15:49,360 --> 02:15:51,350
it's
it's sad because there's uh

7564
02:15:51,350 --> 02:15:51,360
it's sad because there's uh
 

7565
02:15:51,360 --> 02:15:53,830
it's sad because there's uh
just like you said

7566
02:15:53,830 --> 02:15:53,840
just like you said
 

7567
02:15:53,840 --> 02:15:56,550
just like you said
singular events or rare events are

7568
02:15:56,550 --> 02:15:56,560
singular events or rare events are
 

7569
02:15:56,560 --> 02:15:59,270
singular events or rare events are
somehow really inspiring to us

7570
02:15:59,270 --> 02:15:59,280
somehow really inspiring to us
 

7571
02:15:59,280 --> 02:16:01,109
somehow really inspiring to us
and so you kind of have to balance that

7572
02:16:01,109 --> 02:16:01,119
and so you kind of have to balance that
 

7573
02:16:01,119 --> 02:16:03,109
and so you kind of have to balance that
yeah there's a scientific process but

7574
02:16:03,109 --> 02:16:03,119
yeah there's a scientific process but
 

7575
02:16:03,119 --> 02:16:05,109
yeah there's a scientific process but
you also have to like oh the it's the

7576
02:16:05,109 --> 02:16:05,119
you also have to like oh the it's the
 

7577
02:16:05,119 --> 02:16:07,669
you also have to like oh the it's the
thing you you find with the weird the

7578
02:16:07,669 --> 02:16:07,679
thing you you find with the weird the
 

7579
02:16:07,679 --> 02:16:10,950
thing you you find with the weird the
the peculiar it's like huh yeah what is

7580
02:16:10,950 --> 02:16:10,960
the peculiar it's like huh yeah what is
 

7581
02:16:10,960 --> 02:16:15,030
the peculiar it's like huh yeah what is
it even the universe itself it could be

7582
02:16:15,030 --> 02:16:15,040
it even the universe itself it could be
 

7583
02:16:15,040 --> 02:16:16,870
it even the universe itself it could be
that

7584
02:16:16,870 --> 02:16:16,880
that
 

7585
02:16:16,880 --> 02:16:19,350
that
the universe begins

7586
02:16:19,350 --> 02:16:19,360
the universe begins
 

7587
02:16:19,360 --> 02:16:22,629
the universe begins
and then we'll end say in a cold death

7588
02:16:22,629 --> 02:16:22,639
and then we'll end say in a cold death
 

7589
02:16:22,639 --> 02:16:24,069
and then we'll end say in a cold death
and that's it

7590
02:16:24,069 --> 02:16:24,079
and that's it
 

7591
02:16:24,079 --> 02:16:25,830
and that's it
i mean it could be a one-off thing or it

7592
02:16:25,830 --> 02:16:25,840
i mean it could be a one-off thing or it
 

7593
02:16:25,840 --> 02:16:28,790
i mean it could be a one-off thing or it
could be one of an infinite many cycles

7594
02:16:28,790 --> 02:16:28,800
could be one of an infinite many cycles
 

7595
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:31,189
could be one of an infinite many cycles
oh and maybe all of the laws of nature

7596
02:16:31,189 --> 02:16:31,199
oh and maybe all of the laws of nature
 

7597
02:16:31,199 --> 02:16:34,150
oh and maybe all of the laws of nature
are recreated anew with each cycle yeah

7598
02:16:34,150 --> 02:16:34,160
are recreated anew with each cycle yeah
 

7599
02:16:34,160 --> 02:16:35,750
are recreated anew with each cycle yeah
or maybe

7600
02:16:35,750 --> 02:16:35,760
or maybe
 

7601
02:16:35,760 --> 02:16:37,910
or maybe
what we're assuming about the big bang

7602
02:16:37,910 --> 02:16:37,920
what we're assuming about the big bang
 

7603
02:16:37,920 --> 02:16:39,750
what we're assuming about the big bang
there's some element of falsity maybe

7604
02:16:39,750 --> 02:16:39,760
there's some element of falsity maybe
 

7605
02:16:39,760 --> 02:16:42,469
there's some element of falsity maybe
the speed of light is not constant

7606
02:16:42,469 --> 02:16:42,479
the speed of light is not constant
 

7607
02:16:42,479 --> 02:16:44,469
the speed of light is not constant
but changes over time that would throw

7608
02:16:44,469 --> 02:16:44,479
but changes over time that would throw
 

7609
02:16:44,479 --> 02:16:45,990
but changes over time that would throw
into question all kinds of theories

7610
02:16:45,990 --> 02:16:46,000
into question all kinds of theories
 

7611
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:46,950
into question all kinds of theories
about

7612
02:16:46,950 --> 02:16:46,960
about
 

7613
02:16:46,960 --> 02:16:49,509
about
dark matter and dark energy yeah and

7614
02:16:49,509 --> 02:16:49,519
dark matter and dark energy yeah and
 

7615
02:16:49,519 --> 02:16:51,910
dark matter and dark energy yeah and
even the age of the universe and i to me

7616
02:16:51,910 --> 02:16:51,920
even the age of the universe and i to me
 

7617
02:16:51,920 --> 02:16:54,549
even the age of the universe and i to me
there's very likely trillions

7618
02:16:54,549 --> 02:16:54,559
there's very likely trillions
 

7619
02:16:54,559 --> 02:16:57,669
there's very likely trillions
of uh conversations going on like this

7620
02:16:57,669 --> 02:16:57,679
of uh conversations going on like this
 

7621
02:16:57,679 --> 02:17:00,790
of uh conversations going on like this
on other planets yeah in different yeah

7622
02:17:00,790 --> 02:17:00,800
on other planets yeah in different yeah
 

7623
02:17:00,800 --> 02:17:02,709
on other planets yeah in different yeah
no doubt that's exactly there were

7624
02:17:02,709 --> 02:17:02,719
no doubt that's exactly there were
 

7625
02:17:02,719 --> 02:17:03,990
no doubt that's exactly there were
different kinds of drugs different

time scales at which life form is or

7632
02:17:09,349 --> 02:17:09,359
time scales at which life form is or
 

7633
02:17:09,359 --> 02:17:12,070
time scales at which life form is or
what life looks like or how life behaves

7634
02:17:12,070 --> 02:17:12,080
what life looks like or how life behaves

or what life is and all those things it
 

7637
02:17:14,880 --> 02:17:16,629
or what life is and all those things it
kind of yeah every time you think about

7638
02:17:16,629 --> 02:17:16,639
kind of yeah every time you think about
 

7639
02:17:16,639 --> 02:17:19,750
kind of yeah every time you think about
this it's more and more humbling

7640
02:17:19,750 --> 02:17:19,760
this it's more and more humbling
 

7641
02:17:19,760 --> 02:17:23,509
this it's more and more humbling
just this whole fog of ignorance yeah i

7642
02:17:23,509 --> 02:17:23,519
just this whole fog of ignorance yeah i
 

7643
02:17:23,519 --> 02:17:24,870
just this whole fog of ignorance yeah i
mean i mean

7644
02:17:24,870 --> 02:17:24,880
mean i mean
 

7645
02:17:24,880 --> 02:17:26,549
mean i mean
what drives me crazy is wondering about

7646
02:17:26,549 --> 02:17:26,559
what drives me crazy is wondering about
 

7647
02:17:26,559 --> 02:17:29,190
what drives me crazy is wondering about
the beautiful gemstones on other

7648
02:17:29,190 --> 02:17:29,200
the beautiful gemstones on other
 

7649
02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:31,429
the beautiful gemstones on other
planets i call them exo agates you know

7650
02:17:31,429 --> 02:17:31,439
planets i call them exo agates you know
 

7651
02:17:31,439 --> 02:17:32,790
planets i call them exo agates you know
they must be

7652
02:17:32,790 --> 02:17:32,800
they must be
 

7653
02:17:32,800 --> 02:17:35,270
they must be
unbelievable features and forms

7654
02:17:35,270 --> 02:17:35,280
unbelievable features and forms
 

7655
02:17:35,280 --> 02:17:37,509
unbelievable features and forms
which are unimaginable

7656
02:17:37,509 --> 02:17:37,519
which are unimaginable
 

7657
02:17:37,519 --> 02:17:38,950
which are unimaginable
to us because one thing we do know is

7658
02:17:38,950 --> 02:17:38,960
to us because one thing we do know is
 

7659
02:17:38,960 --> 02:17:41,110
to us because one thing we do know is
that nature is very creative i mean we

7660
02:17:41,110 --> 02:17:41,120
that nature is very creative i mean we
 

7661
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:43,190
that nature is very creative i mean we
are the product of nature and we seem to

7662
02:17:43,190 --> 02:17:43,200
are the product of nature and we seem to
 

7663
02:17:43,200 --> 02:17:45,349
are the product of nature and we seem to
be fairly creative

7664
02:17:45,349 --> 02:17:45,359
be fairly creative
 

7665
02:17:45,359 --> 02:17:47,990
be fairly creative
and so imagine what else uh nature's

7666
02:17:47,990 --> 02:17:48,000
and so imagine what else uh nature's
 

7667
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,150
and so imagine what else uh nature's
created but even that's unknown it you

7668
02:17:50,150 --> 02:17:50,160
created but even that's unknown it you
 

7669
02:17:50,160 --> 02:17:51,750
created but even that's unknown it you
know is how common is life in the

7670
02:17:51,750 --> 02:17:51,760
know is how common is life in the
 

7671
02:17:51,760 --> 02:17:53,190
know is how common is life in the
universe is it

7672
02:17:53,190 --> 02:17:53,200
universe is it
 

7673
02:17:53,200 --> 02:17:55,190
universe is it
is it common or is it rare we only have

7674
02:17:55,190 --> 02:17:55,200
is it common or is it rare we only have
 

7675
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:57,110
is it common or is it rare we only have
a sample size of one

7676
02:17:57,110 --> 02:17:57,120
a sample size of one
 

7677
02:17:57,120 --> 02:17:58,950
a sample size of one
you know it could be quite common or it

7678
02:17:58,950 --> 02:17:58,960
you know it could be quite common or it
 

7679
02:17:58,960 --> 02:18:02,950
you know it could be quite common or it
could be even unique yeah

7680
02:18:02,950 --> 02:18:02,960

 

7681
02:18:02,960 --> 02:18:06,709

i i tend to believe it's everywhere

7682
02:18:06,709 --> 02:18:06,719
i i tend to believe it's everywhere
 

7683
02:18:06,719 --> 02:18:08,549
i i tend to believe it's everywhere
except for the fact that we don't even

7684
02:18:08,549 --> 02:18:08,559
except for the fact that we don't even
 

7685
02:18:08,559 --> 02:18:10,549
except for the fact that we don't even
know how to define what life is like

7686
02:18:10,549 --> 02:18:10,559
know how to define what life is like
 

7687
02:18:10,559 --> 02:18:12,629
know how to define what life is like
what is everywhere exactly we're talking

7688
02:18:12,629 --> 02:18:12,639
what is everywhere exactly we're talking
 

7689
02:18:12,639 --> 02:18:14,629
what is everywhere exactly we're talking
about it's it's very possible that

7690
02:18:14,629 --> 02:18:14,639
about it's it's very possible that
 

7691
02:18:14,639 --> 02:18:16,230
about it's it's very possible that
there's

7692
02:18:16,230 --> 02:18:16,240
there's
 

7693
02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:18,070
there's
not

7694
02:18:18,070 --> 02:18:18,080
not
 

7695
02:18:18,080 --> 02:18:20,150
not

walking around
 

7703
02:18:28,080 --> 02:18:30,790
walking around
at this time scale but like well there

7704
02:18:30,790 --> 02:18:30,800
at this time scale but like well there
 

7705
02:18:30,800 --> 02:18:32,709
at this time scale but like well there
could be very different kind of other

7706
02:18:32,709 --> 02:18:32,719
could be very different kind of other
 

7707
02:18:32,719 --> 02:18:33,830
could be very different kind of other
things

7708
02:18:33,830 --> 02:18:33,840
things
 

7709
02:18:33,840 --> 02:18:36,150
things
um it was interesting that some people

7710
02:18:36,150 --> 02:18:36,160
um it was interesting that some people
 

7711
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:38,309
um it was interesting that some people
this is not a common belief but a friend

7712
02:18:38,309 --> 02:18:38,319
this is not a common belief but a friend
 

7713
02:18:38,319 --> 02:18:40,150
this is not a common belief but a friend
now named lee cronin

7714
02:18:40,150 --> 02:18:40,160
now named lee cronin
 

7715
02:18:40,160 --> 02:18:43,270
now named lee cronin
he's a chemist and uh biologist

7716
02:18:43,270 --> 02:18:43,280
he's a chemist and uh biologist
 

7717
02:18:43,280 --> 02:18:45,270
he's a chemist and uh biologist
and he believes that if we ran evolution

7718
02:18:45,270 --> 02:18:45,280
and he believes that if we ran evolution
 

7719
02:18:45,280 --> 02:18:47,030
and he believes that if we ran evolution
over and over and over and over on earth

you get very different not just you

7722
02:18:49,589 --> 02:18:49,599
you get very different not just you
 

7723
02:18:49,599 --> 02:18:51,429
you get very different not just you
wouldn't just get different organisms

7724
02:18:51,429 --> 02:18:51,439
wouldn't just get different organisms
 

7725
02:18:51,439 --> 02:18:53,669
wouldn't just get different organisms
you get very different biology yeah

7726
02:18:53,669 --> 02:18:53,679
you get very different biology yeah
 

7727
02:18:53,679 --> 02:18:55,110
you get very different biology yeah
that's quite impossible yeah and that's

7728
02:18:55,110 --> 02:18:55,120
that's quite impossible yeah and that's
 

7729
02:18:55,120 --> 02:18:56,870
that's quite impossible yeah and that's
a weird thing to i mean most people kind

7730
02:18:56,870 --> 02:18:56,880
a weird thing to i mean most people kind
 

7731
02:18:56,880 --> 02:18:59,270
a weird thing to i mean most people kind
of assume well it kind of you know it

7732
02:18:59,270 --> 02:18:59,280
of assume well it kind of you know it
 

7733
02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:00,790
of assume well it kind of you know it
fits to the environment and you're going

7734
02:19:00,790 --> 02:19:00,800
fits to the environment and you're going
 

7735
02:19:00,800 --> 02:19:02,790
fits to the environment and you're going
to get similar things maybe not humans

7736
02:19:02,790 --> 02:19:02,800
to get similar things maybe not humans
 

7737
02:19:02,800 --> 02:19:04,070
to get similar things maybe not humans
and so on but

7738
02:19:04,070 --> 02:19:04,080
and so on but
 

7739
02:19:04,080 --> 02:19:06,230
and so on but
to get very different biology like

7740
02:19:06,230 --> 02:19:06,240
to get very different biology like
 

7741
02:19:06,240 --> 02:19:07,990
to get very different biology like
starting from the bacteria to the you

7742
02:19:07,990 --> 02:19:08,000
starting from the bacteria to the you
 

7743
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:09,190
starting from the bacteria to the you
know just how

7744
02:19:09,190 --> 02:19:09,200
know just how
 

7745
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:11,270
know just how
well the idea that it would be dna based

7746
02:19:11,270 --> 02:19:11,280
well the idea that it would be dna based
 

7747
02:19:11,280 --> 02:19:13,750
well the idea that it would be dna based
dna on some other planet that seems to

7748
02:19:13,750 --> 02:19:13,760
dna on some other planet that seems to
 

7749
02:19:13,760 --> 02:19:16,150
dna on some other planet that seems to
me like saying they're speaking swahili

7750
02:19:16,150 --> 02:19:16,160
me like saying they're speaking swahili
 

7751
02:19:16,160 --> 02:19:17,830
me like saying they're speaking swahili
on some other planet i mean the odds of

7752
02:19:17,830 --> 02:19:17,840
on some other planet i mean the odds of
 

7753
02:19:17,840 --> 02:19:20,629
on some other planet i mean the odds of
that particular architecture i think are

7754
02:19:20,629 --> 02:19:20,639
that particular architecture i think are
 

7755
02:19:20,639 --> 02:19:22,950
that particular architecture i think are
infinitesimally small

7756
02:19:22,950 --> 02:19:22,960
infinitesimally small
 

7757
02:19:22,960 --> 02:19:25,669
infinitesimally small
what's the coolest stone you've ever

7758
02:19:25,669 --> 02:19:25,679
what's the coolest stone you've ever
 

7759
02:19:25,679 --> 02:19:26,629
what's the coolest stone you've ever
seen

7760
02:19:26,629 --> 02:19:26,639
seen
 

7761
02:19:26,639 --> 02:19:28,950
seen
oh my god there's so many

7762
02:19:28,950 --> 02:19:28,960
oh my god there's so many
 

7763
02:19:28,960 --> 02:19:31,750
oh my god there's so many
and what what what defines is it rarity

7764
02:19:31,750 --> 02:19:31,760
and what what what defines is it rarity
 

7765
02:19:31,760 --> 02:19:34,790
and what what what defines is it rarity
is it just raw beauty what what

7766
02:19:34,790 --> 02:19:34,800
is it just raw beauty what what
 

7767
02:19:34,800 --> 02:19:36,230
is it just raw beauty what what
captivates your

7768

captivates your
i like

7770
02:19:37,190 --> 02:19:37,200
i like
 

7771
02:19:37,200 --> 02:19:39,990
i like
excitement a storied stone

7772
02:19:39,990 --> 02:19:40,000
excitement a storied stone
 

7773
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:43,190
excitement a storied stone
i have a very beautiful fair burn agate

7774
02:19:43,190 --> 02:19:43,200
i have a very beautiful fair burn agate
 

7775
02:19:43,200 --> 02:19:45,270
i have a very beautiful fair burn agate
which is multiple layers

7776
02:19:45,270 --> 02:19:45,280
which is multiple layers
 

7777
02:19:45,280 --> 02:19:46,870
which is multiple layers
and there's something i call agate

7778
02:19:46,870 --> 02:19:46,880
and there's something i call agate
 

7779
02:19:46,880 --> 02:19:49,030
and there's something i call agate
paralysis because

7780
02:19:49,030 --> 02:19:49,040
paralysis because
 

7781
02:19:49,040 --> 02:19:50,630
paralysis because
to polish it

7782
02:19:50,630 --> 02:19:50,640
to polish it
 

7783
02:19:50,640 --> 02:19:53,270
to polish it
you have to go through the layers

7784
02:19:53,270 --> 02:19:53,280
you have to go through the layers
 

7785
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:55,990
you have to go through the layers
which means you're destroying the layers

7786
02:19:55,990 --> 02:19:56,000
which means you're destroying the layers
 

7787
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:57,429
which means you're destroying the layers
and maybe what should be done is it

7788
02:19:57,429 --> 02:19:57,439
and maybe what should be done is it
 

7789
02:19:57,439 --> 02:19:59,429
and maybe what should be done is it
should be like a movie where you you

7790
02:19:59,429 --> 02:19:59,439
should be like a movie where you you
 

7791
02:19:59,439 --> 02:20:00,469
should be like a movie where you you
film

7792
02:20:00,469 --> 02:20:00,479
film
 

7793
02:20:00,479 --> 02:20:02,309
film
the entire process of cutting and

7794
02:20:02,309 --> 02:20:02,319
the entire process of cutting and
 

7795
02:20:02,319 --> 02:20:04,469
the entire process of cutting and
polishing so that

7796
02:20:04,469 --> 02:20:04,479
polishing so that
 

7797
02:20:04,479 --> 02:20:06,150
polishing so that
it's not dead

7798
02:20:06,150 --> 02:20:06,160
it's not dead
 

7799
02:20:06,160 --> 02:20:07,750
it's not dead
in other words what was the diamond when

7800
02:20:07,750 --> 02:20:07,760
in other words what was the diamond when
 

7801
02:20:07,760 --> 02:20:09,830
in other words what was the diamond when
it started rough the the rough diamond

7802
02:20:09,830 --> 02:20:09,840
it started rough the the rough diamond
 

7803
02:20:09,840 --> 02:20:11,990
it started rough the the rough diamond
is gone but if you could sort of do a

7804
02:20:11,990 --> 02:20:12,000
is gone but if you could sort of do a
 

7805
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,389
is gone but if you could sort of do a
filmic version yeah of a cutting process

7806
02:20:14,389 --> 02:20:14,399
filmic version yeah of a cutting process
 

7807
02:20:14,399 --> 02:20:15,670
filmic version yeah of a cutting process
so that the

7808
02:20:15,670 --> 02:20:15,680
so that the
 

7809
02:20:15,680 --> 02:20:18,630
so that the
the stone would exist in a from a

7810
02:20:18,630 --> 02:20:18,640
the stone would exist in a from a
 

7811
02:20:18,640 --> 02:20:20,950
the stone would exist in a from a
pre-polished to a polished state all as

7812
02:20:20,950 --> 02:20:20,960
pre-polished to a polished state all as
 

7813
02:20:20,960 --> 02:20:22,309
pre-polished to a polished state all as
a kind of

7814
02:20:22,309 --> 02:20:22,319
a kind of
 

7815
02:20:22,319 --> 02:20:24,070
a kind of
nft or something

7816
02:20:24,070 --> 02:20:24,080
nft or something
 

7817
02:20:24,080 --> 02:20:27,349
nft or something
another that should be nfc that's right

7818
02:20:27,349 --> 02:20:27,359
another that should be nfc that's right
 

7819
02:20:27,359 --> 02:20:28,070
another that should be nfc that's right
so

7820
02:20:28,070 --> 02:20:28,080
so
 

7821
02:20:28,080 --> 02:20:31,270
so
the other thing i fantasize about is how

7822
02:20:31,270 --> 02:20:31,280
the other thing i fantasize about is how
 

7823
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:33,510
the other thing i fantasize about is how
pattern recognition technology will

7824
02:20:33,510 --> 02:20:33,520
pattern recognition technology will
 

7825
02:20:33,520 --> 02:20:35,030
pattern recognition technology will
probably in the future allow us to

7826
02:20:35,030 --> 02:20:35,040
probably in the future allow us to
 

7827
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:37,270
probably in the future allow us to
discover all kinds of amazing stones

7828
02:20:37,270 --> 02:20:37,280
discover all kinds of amazing stones
 

7829
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:39,990
discover all kinds of amazing stones
including for example fossil skulls

7830
02:20:39,990 --> 02:20:40,000
including for example fossil skulls
 

7831
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,150
including for example fossil skulls
fossil skulls of humans

7832
02:20:42,150 --> 02:20:42,160
fossil skulls of humans
 

7833
02:20:42,160 --> 02:20:45,030
fossil skulls of humans
now it's kind of a chance process that

7834
02:20:45,030 --> 02:20:45,040
now it's kind of a chance process that
 

7835
02:20:45,040 --> 02:20:47,030
now it's kind of a chance process that
you discover a skull in

7836
02:20:47,030 --> 02:20:47,040
you discover a skull in
 

7837
02:20:47,040 --> 02:20:49,910
you discover a skull in
east africa but why not have a drone

7838
02:20:49,910 --> 02:20:49,920
east africa but why not have a drone
 

7839
02:20:49,920 --> 02:20:53,030
east africa but why not have a drone
moving constantly scanning for pattern

7840
02:20:53,030 --> 02:20:53,040
moving constantly scanning for pattern
 

7841
02:20:53,040 --> 02:20:54,389
moving constantly scanning for pattern
recognition

7842
02:20:54,389 --> 02:20:54,399
recognition
 

7843
02:20:54,399 --> 02:20:57,510
recognition
of human skull human teeth very slowly

7844
02:20:57,510 --> 02:20:57,520
of human skull human teeth very slowly
 

7845
02:20:57,520 --> 02:20:58,950
of human skull human teeth very slowly
and then on the surface you mean just

7846
02:20:58,950 --> 02:20:58,960
and then on the surface you mean just
 

7847
02:20:58,960 --> 02:21:00,790
and then on the surface you mean just
above the surface just 10 feet above the

7848
02:21:00,790 --> 02:21:00,800
above the surface just 10 feet above the
 

7849
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:02,630
above the surface just 10 feet above the
surface 20 feet above the surface no

7850
02:21:02,630 --> 02:21:02,640
surface 20 feet above the surface no
 

7851
02:21:02,640 --> 02:21:04,150
surface 20 feet above the surface no
sorry you think you'll be able to find

7852
02:21:04,150 --> 02:21:04,160
sorry you think you'll be able to find
 

7853
02:21:04,160 --> 02:21:06,309
sorry you think you'll be able to find
skulls on the surface yes

7854
02:21:06,309 --> 02:21:06,319
skulls on the surface yes
 

7855
02:21:06,319 --> 02:21:08,389
skulls on the surface yes
yes in the middle of a place that no one

7856
02:21:08,389 --> 02:21:08,399
yes in the middle of a place that no one
 

7857
02:21:08,399 --> 02:21:09,670
yes in the middle of a place that no one
has looked which

7858
02:21:09,670 --> 02:21:09,680
has looked which
 

7859
02:21:09,680 --> 02:21:11,670
has looked which
these areas are vast right

7860
02:21:11,670 --> 02:21:11,680
these areas are vast right
 

7861
02:21:11,680 --> 02:21:13,830
these areas are vast right
so it could be found on the surface then

7862
02:21:13,830 --> 02:21:13,840
so it could be found on the surface then
 

7863
02:21:13,840 --> 02:21:15,750
so it could be found on the surface then
move to the next layer then then find it

7864
02:21:15,750 --> 02:21:15,760
move to the next layer then then find it
 

7865
02:21:15,760 --> 02:21:18,389
move to the next layer then then find it
under the surface as well there's lidar

7866
02:21:18,389 --> 02:21:18,399
under the surface as well there's lidar
 

7867
02:21:18,399 --> 02:21:19,830
under the surface as well there's lidar
there's all kinds of ways we're finding

7868
02:21:19,830 --> 02:21:19,840
there's all kinds of ways we're finding
 

7869
02:21:19,840 --> 02:21:21,349
there's all kinds of ways we're finding
jungles and

7870
02:21:21,349 --> 02:21:21,359
jungles and
 

7871
02:21:21,359 --> 02:21:23,990
jungles and
jungle cities in in under the amazon

7872
02:21:23,990 --> 02:21:24,000
jungle cities in in under the amazon
 

7873
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,150
jungle cities in in under the amazon
that people didn't know about do you

7874
02:21:26,150 --> 02:21:26,160
that people didn't know about do you
 

7875
02:21:26,160 --> 02:21:27,510
that people didn't know about do you
think there's something

7876
02:21:27,510 --> 02:21:27,520
think there's something
 

7877
02:21:27,520 --> 02:21:28,550
think there's something
out there

7878
02:21:28,550 --> 02:21:28,560
out there
 

7879
02:21:28,560 --> 02:21:30,710
out there
that would just blow your mind oh for

7880
02:21:30,710 --> 02:21:30,720
that would just blow your mind oh for
 

7881
02:21:30,720 --> 02:21:31,990
that would just blow your mind oh for
sure

7882
02:21:31,990 --> 02:21:32,000
sure
 

7883
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:33,590
sure
for sure

7884
02:21:33,590 --> 02:21:33,600
for sure
 

7885
02:21:33,600 --> 02:21:36,469
for sure
yeah no doubt oh man

7886
02:21:36,469 --> 02:21:36,479
yeah no doubt oh man
 

7887
02:21:36,479 --> 02:21:38,550
yeah no doubt oh man
and uh how much of it is a little bit

7888
02:21:38,550 --> 02:21:38,560
and uh how much of it is a little bit
 

7889
02:21:38,560 --> 02:21:40,070
and uh how much of it is a little bit
underground right or how much of it is

7890
02:21:40,070 --> 02:21:40,080
underground right or how much of it is
 

7891
02:21:40,080 --> 02:21:42,710
underground right or how much of it is
in the ocean yeah i mean here right here

7892
02:21:42,710 --> 02:21:42,720
in the ocean yeah i mean here right here
 

7893
02:21:42,720 --> 02:21:44,550
in the ocean yeah i mean here right here
we are in the bay area

7894
02:21:44,550 --> 02:21:44,560
we are in the bay area
 

7895
02:21:44,560 --> 02:21:46,070
we are in the bay area
we know that

7896
02:21:46,070 --> 02:21:46,080
we know that
 

7897
02:21:46,080 --> 02:21:48,309
we know that
much of the native american civilization

7898
02:21:48,309 --> 02:21:48,319
much of the native american civilization
 

7899
02:21:48,319 --> 02:21:50,550
much of the native american civilization
here was under the bay

7900
02:21:50,550 --> 02:21:50,560
here was under the bay
 

7901
02:21:50,560 --> 02:21:53,110
here was under the bay
because six thousand years ago the bay

7902
02:21:53,110 --> 02:21:53,120
because six thousand years ago the bay
 

7903
02:21:53,120 --> 02:21:55,750
because six thousand years ago the bay
was dry it was a river not a bay

7904
02:21:55,750 --> 02:21:55,760
was dry it was a river not a bay
 

7905
02:21:55,760 --> 02:21:58,070
was dry it was a river not a bay
and so all of those whatever

7906
02:21:58,070 --> 02:21:58,080
and so all of those whatever
 

7907
02:21:58,080 --> 02:22:00,230
and so all of those whatever
material culture archaeological traces

7908
02:22:00,230 --> 02:22:00,240
material culture archaeological traces
 

7909
02:22:00,240 --> 02:22:02,230
material culture archaeological traces
existed there

7910
02:22:02,230 --> 02:22:02,240
existed there
 

7911
02:22:02,240 --> 02:22:04,230
existed there
are now at least preserved under the

7912
02:22:04,230 --> 02:22:04,240
are now at least preserved under the
 

7913
02:22:04,240 --> 02:22:05,429
are now at least preserved under the
water

7914
02:22:05,429 --> 02:22:05,439
water
 

7915
02:22:05,439 --> 02:22:08,070
water
so i think we're just beginning to to

7916
02:22:08,070 --> 02:22:08,080
so i think we're just beginning to to
 

7917
02:22:08,080 --> 02:22:10,630
so i think we're just beginning to to
touch the it could be treasure too

7918
02:22:10,630 --> 02:22:10,640
touch the it could be treasure too
 

7919
02:22:10,640 --> 02:22:12,150
touch the it could be treasure too
i mean like literally like you said we

7920
02:22:12,150 --> 02:22:12,160
i mean like literally like you said we
 

7921
02:22:12,160 --> 02:22:14,070
i mean like literally like you said we
lose the wisdom or we'll lose the

7922
02:22:14,070 --> 02:22:14,080
lose the wisdom or we'll lose the
 

7923
02:22:14,080 --> 02:22:16,150
lose the wisdom or we'll lose the
knowledge but

7924
02:22:16,150 --> 02:22:16,160
knowledge but
 

7925
02:22:16,160 --> 02:22:19,750
knowledge but
i i mean um

7926
02:22:19,750 --> 02:22:19,760

 

7927
02:22:19,760 --> 02:22:21,750

if there's the pyramids right it's the

7928
02:22:21,750 --> 02:22:21,760
if there's the pyramids right it's the
 

7929
02:22:21,760 --> 02:22:23,190
if there's the pyramids right it's the
great wonders of the world there might

7930
02:22:23,190 --> 02:22:23,200
great wonders of the world there might
 

7931
02:22:23,200 --> 02:22:24,389
great wonders of the world there might
be other wanderers that are completely

7932
02:22:24,389 --> 02:22:24,399
be other wanderers that are completely
 

7933
02:22:24,399 --> 02:22:27,510
be other wanderers that are completely
lost yeah just i mean one of the stones

7934
02:22:27,510 --> 02:22:27,520
lost yeah just i mean one of the stones
 

7935
02:22:27,520 --> 02:22:29,830
lost yeah just i mean one of the stones
you asked about stones i like i

7936
02:22:29,830 --> 02:22:29,840
you asked about stones i like i
 

7937
02:22:29,840 --> 02:22:31,750
you asked about stones i like i
i like

7938
02:22:31,750 --> 02:22:31,760
i like
 

7939
02:22:31,760 --> 02:22:34,150
i like
stones for example

7940
02:22:34,150 --> 02:22:34,160
stones for example
 

7941
02:22:34,160 --> 02:22:36,790
stones for example
every now and then dinosaurs would eat

7942
02:22:36,790 --> 02:22:36,800
every now and then dinosaurs would eat
 

7943
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:37,830
every now and then dinosaurs would eat
rocks

7944
02:22:37,830 --> 02:22:37,840
rocks
 

7945
02:22:37,840 --> 02:22:41,030
rocks
as gizzard stones and then you find them

7946
02:22:41,030 --> 02:22:41,040
as gizzard stones and then you find them
 

7947
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:42,950
as gizzard stones and then you find them
in their in their guts and their bones

7948
02:22:42,950 --> 02:22:42,960
in their in their guts and their bones
 

7949
02:22:42,960 --> 02:22:44,150
in their in their guts and their bones
well every now and then they would eat a

7950
02:22:44,150 --> 02:22:44,160
well every now and then they would eat a
 

7951
02:22:44,160 --> 02:22:46,070
well every now and then they would eat a
piece of petrified wood

7952
02:22:46,070 --> 02:22:46,080
piece of petrified wood
 

7953
02:22:46,080 --> 02:22:48,790
piece of petrified wood
so the idea that something was a tree

7954
02:22:48,790 --> 02:22:48,800
so the idea that something was a tree
 

7955
02:22:48,800 --> 02:22:51,590
so the idea that something was a tree
and then stone and then swallowed by a

7956
02:22:51,590 --> 02:22:51,600
and then stone and then swallowed by a
 

7957
02:22:51,600 --> 02:22:53,510
and then stone and then swallowed by a
dinosaur and ground up in the gizzard

7958
02:22:53,510 --> 02:22:53,520
dinosaur and ground up in the gizzard
 

7959
02:22:53,520 --> 02:22:55,830
dinosaur and ground up in the gizzard
and polished and then left in a you know

7960
02:22:55,830 --> 02:22:55,840
and polished and then left in a you know
 

7961
02:22:55,840 --> 02:22:57,510
and polished and then left in a you know
yeah so i like things that have been

7962
02:22:57,510 --> 02:22:57,520
yeah so i like things that have been
 

7963
02:22:57,520 --> 02:22:59,830
yeah so i like things that have been
through dramatic there's a story there

7964
02:22:59,830 --> 02:22:59,840
through dramatic there's a story there
 

7965
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:01,750
through dramatic there's a story there
there's this yeah i mean that that's

7966
02:23:01,750 --> 02:23:01,760
there's this yeah i mean that that's
 

7967
02:23:01,760 --> 02:23:03,910
there's this yeah i mean that that's
okay the the really fascinating thing

7968
02:23:03,910 --> 02:23:03,920
okay the the really fascinating thing
 

7969
02:23:03,920 --> 02:23:05,270
okay the the really fascinating thing
why

7970
02:23:05,270 --> 02:23:05,280
why
 

7971
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:09,590
why
seeing allah or crosses in the stone

7972
02:23:09,590 --> 02:23:09,600
seeing allah or crosses in the stone
 

7973
02:23:09,600 --> 02:23:11,910
seeing allah or crosses in the stone
is it feels like the stone has wisdom

7974
02:23:11,910 --> 02:23:11,920
is it feels like the stone has wisdom
 

7975
02:23:11,920 --> 02:23:12,790
is it feels like the stone has wisdom
because

7976
02:23:12,790 --> 02:23:12,800
because
 

7977
02:23:12,800 --> 02:23:14,309
because
it's been

there's a there's a
 

7981
02:23:15,920 --> 02:23:17,830
there's a there's a
it's been through so many generations of

7982
02:23:17,830 --> 02:23:17,840
it's been through so many generations of
 

7983
02:23:17,840 --> 02:23:19,750
it's been through so many generations of
humans it's like bigger

7984
02:23:19,750 --> 02:23:19,760
humans it's like bigger
 

7985
02:23:19,760 --> 02:23:22,550
humans it's like bigger
right it's seen it all also it's also

7986
02:23:22,550 --> 02:23:22,560
right it's seen it all also it's also
 

7987
02:23:22,560 --> 02:23:24,710
right it's seen it all also it's also
the intellectual question of intelligent

7988
02:23:24,710 --> 02:23:24,720
the intellectual question of intelligent
 

7989
02:23:24,720 --> 02:23:26,790
the intellectual question of intelligent
design in other words when people say

7990
02:23:26,790 --> 02:23:26,800
design in other words when people say
 

7991
02:23:26,800 --> 02:23:29,590
design in other words when people say
intelligent design mostly it's bogus but

7992
02:23:29,590 --> 02:23:29,600
intelligent design mostly it's bogus but
 

7993
02:23:29,600 --> 02:23:32,389
intelligent design mostly it's bogus but
there are several interesting examples

7994
02:23:32,389 --> 02:23:32,399
there are several interesting examples
 

7995
02:23:32,399 --> 02:23:36,070
there are several interesting examples
of actual intelligent design meaning

7996
02:23:36,070 --> 02:23:36,080
of actual intelligent design meaning
 

7997
02:23:36,080 --> 02:23:38,950
of actual intelligent design meaning
when is a stone the product of artifice

7998
02:23:38,950 --> 02:23:38,960
when is a stone the product of artifice
 

7999
02:23:38,960 --> 02:23:41,349
when is a stone the product of artifice
and when is it a geofact produced by

8000
02:23:41,349 --> 02:23:41,359
and when is it a geofact produced by
 

8001
02:23:41,359 --> 02:23:42,389
and when is it a geofact produced by
nature

8002
02:23:42,389 --> 02:23:42,399
nature
 

8003
02:23:42,399 --> 02:23:43,670
nature
and that's that was an important

8004
02:23:43,670 --> 02:23:43,680
and that's that was an important
 

8005
02:23:43,680 --> 02:23:46,550
and that's that was an important
discovery in the 19th century the the

8006
02:23:46,550 --> 02:23:46,560
discovery in the 19th century the the
 

8007
02:23:46,560 --> 02:23:48,950
discovery in the 19th century the the
zone of percussion it's called the the

8008
02:23:48,950 --> 02:23:48,960
zone of percussion it's called the the
 

8009
02:23:48,960 --> 02:23:50,389
zone of percussion it's called the the
percussion zone

8010

percussion zone
 

8011
02:23:50,399 --> 02:23:52,070
percussion zone
or how do you know that a signal from

8012
02:23:52,070 --> 02:23:52,080
or how do you know that a signal from
 

8013
02:23:52,080 --> 02:23:54,309
or how do you know that a signal from
out of space is an intelligent signal

8014
02:23:54,309 --> 02:23:54,319
out of space is an intelligent signal
 

8015
02:23:54,319 --> 02:23:55,990
out of space is an intelligent signal
and as opposed to

8016
02:23:55,990 --> 02:23:56,000
and as opposed to
 

8017
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,790
and as opposed to
hydrogen doing something or some

hydrogen doing something or some
 

8019
02:23:58,800 --> 02:24:01,349
hydrogen doing something or some
natural thing that's the genuine problem

8020
02:24:01,349 --> 02:24:01,359
natural thing that's the genuine problem
 

8021
02:24:01,359 --> 02:24:03,670
natural thing that's the genuine problem
of intelligent design how do you know if

8022
02:24:03,670 --> 02:24:03,680
of intelligent design how do you know if
 

8023
02:24:03,680 --> 02:24:04,950
of intelligent design how do you know if
it's pi

8024
02:24:04,950 --> 02:24:04,960
it's pi
 

8025
02:24:04,960 --> 02:24:07,910
it's pi
maybe if it's e if it's some

8026
02:24:07,910 --> 02:24:07,920
maybe if it's e if it's some
 

8027
02:24:07,920 --> 02:24:09,910
maybe if it's e if it's some
you know pattern

8028
02:24:09,910 --> 02:24:09,920
you know pattern
 

8029
02:24:09,920 --> 02:24:11,670
you know pattern
is how do you know that that's an

8030
02:24:11,670 --> 02:24:11,680
is how do you know that that's an
 

8031
02:24:11,680 --> 02:24:13,429
is how do you know that that's an
intelligent signal how do you know that

02:24:13,429 --> 02:24:13,439
intelligent signal how do you know that
 

8033
02:24:13,439 --> 02:24:16,070
intelligent signal how do you know that
an artifact in the ground is

8034
02:24:16,070 --> 02:24:16,080
an artifact in the ground is
 

8035
02:24:16,080 --> 02:24:17,349
an artifact in the ground is
you know

8036
02:24:17,349 --> 02:24:17,359
you know
 

8037
02:24:17,359 --> 02:24:19,910
you know
we'll see in the clouds of a face

8038
02:24:19,910 --> 02:24:19,920
we'll see in the clouds of a face
 

8039
02:24:19,920 --> 02:24:22,230
we'll see in the clouds of a face
it's called paradoia we have a kind of a

8040
02:24:22,230 --> 02:24:22,240
it's called paradoia we have a kind of a
 

8041
02:24:22,240 --> 02:24:24,950
it's called paradoia we have a kind of a
built-in ability to see faces where they

8042
02:24:24,950 --> 02:24:24,960
built-in ability to see faces where they
 

8043
02:24:24,960 --> 02:24:26,950
built-in ability to see faces where they
really aren't there right that's why

8044
02:24:26,950 --> 02:24:26,960
really aren't there right that's why
 

8045
02:24:26,960 --> 02:24:28,950
really aren't there right that's why
kids like clowns

8046
02:24:28,950 --> 02:24:28,960
kids like clowns
 

8047
02:24:28,960 --> 02:24:30,550
kids like clowns
you know we've evolved that so babies

8048
02:24:30,550 --> 02:24:30,560
you know we've evolved that so babies
 

8049
02:24:30,560 --> 02:24:32,389
you know we've evolved that so babies
evolve it to recognize their parents and

8050
02:24:32,389 --> 02:24:32,399
evolve it to recognize their parents and
 

8051
02:24:32,399 --> 02:24:33,910
evolve it to recognize their parents and
so forth

8052
02:24:33,910 --> 02:24:33,920
so forth
 

8053
02:24:33,920 --> 02:24:36,389
so forth
but when is it a projection

8054
02:24:36,389 --> 02:24:36,399
but when is it a projection
 

8055
02:24:36,399 --> 02:24:38,630
but when is it a projection
and when is it really in the in the in

8056
02:24:38,630 --> 02:24:38,640
and when is it really in the in the in
 

8057
02:24:38,640 --> 02:24:40,150
and when is it really in the in the in
the stone

8058
02:24:40,150 --> 02:24:40,160
the stone
 

8059
02:24:40,160 --> 02:24:42,469
the stone
and that was a big question with the

8060
02:24:42,469 --> 02:24:42,479
and that was a big question with the
 

8061
02:24:42,479 --> 02:24:44,790
and that was a big question with the
rise of fossils you know if you find a a

8062
02:24:44,790 --> 02:24:44,800
rise of fossils you know if you find a a
 

8063
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:46,469
rise of fossils you know if you find a a
curly thing

8064
02:24:46,469 --> 02:24:46,479
curly thing
 

8065
02:24:46,479 --> 02:24:48,870
curly thing
is that life or is it non-life is it you

8066
02:24:48,870 --> 02:24:48,880
is that life or is it non-life is it you
 

8067
02:24:48,880 --> 02:24:49,750
is that life or is it non-life is it you
know

8068
02:24:49,750 --> 02:24:49,760
know
 

8069
02:24:49,760 --> 02:24:51,429
know
people have made this mistake before you

8070
02:24:51,429 --> 02:24:51,439
people have made this mistake before you
 

8071
02:24:51,439 --> 02:24:53,429
people have made this mistake before you
know they'll find a rock on on the moon

8072
02:24:53,429 --> 02:24:53,439
know they'll find a rock on on the moon
 

8073
02:24:53,439 --> 02:24:55,590
know they'll find a rock on on the moon
or mars they say oh this is a face or

8074
02:24:55,590 --> 02:24:55,600
or mars they say oh this is a face or
 

8075
02:24:55,600 --> 02:24:56,870
or mars they say oh this is a face or
whatever well

8076
02:24:56,870 --> 02:24:56,880
whatever well
 

8077
02:24:56,880 --> 02:24:59,030
whatever well
you know no that's that's just

8078
02:24:59,030 --> 02:24:59,040
you know no that's that's just
 

8079
02:24:59,040 --> 02:25:01,750
you know no that's that's just
projection that's paradoia i guess

8080
02:25:01,750 --> 02:25:01,760
projection that's paradoia i guess
 

8081
02:25:01,760 --> 02:25:03,429
projection that's paradoia i guess
throughout science you have this problem

8082
02:25:03,429 --> 02:25:03,439
throughout science you have this problem
 

8083
02:25:03,439 --> 02:25:06,150
throughout science you have this problem
of signal it just because something is

8084
02:25:06,150 --> 02:25:06,160
of signal it just because something is
 

8085
02:25:06,160 --> 02:25:08,230
of signal it just because something is
beautiful

8086
02:25:08,230 --> 02:25:08,240
beautiful
 

8087
02:25:08,240 --> 02:25:11,110
beautiful
doesn't mean it was i mean that's that's

8088
02:25:11,110 --> 02:25:11,120
doesn't mean it was i mean that's that's
 

8089
02:25:11,120 --> 02:25:13,429
doesn't mean it was i mean that's that's
not a good signal to determine if it's

8090
02:25:13,429 --> 02:25:13,439
not a good signal to determine if it's
 

8091
02:25:13,439 --> 02:25:16,150
not a good signal to determine if it's
intelligent design or

8092
02:25:16,150 --> 02:25:16,160
intelligent design or
 

8093
02:25:16,160 --> 02:25:17,910
intelligent design or
natural

8094
02:25:17,910 --> 02:25:17,920
natural
 

8095
02:25:17,920 --> 02:25:20,309

evolution or natural design just because
 

8097
02:25:20,319 --> 02:25:22,790

you're you see a stone that just

8098
02:25:22,790 --> 02:25:22,800
you're you see a stone that just
 

8099
02:25:22,800 --> 02:25:25,990
you're you see a stone that just
yeah the pattern is is incredible how do

8100
02:25:25,990 --> 02:25:26,000
yeah the pattern is is incredible how do
 

8101
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:27,429
yeah the pattern is is incredible how do
you what do you know how do you know

8102
02:25:27,429 --> 02:25:27,439
you what do you know how do you know
 

8103
02:25:27,439 --> 02:25:30,550
you what do you know how do you know
it's a fossil is one question

8104
02:25:30,550 --> 02:25:30,560
it's a fossil is one question
 

8105
02:25:30,560 --> 02:25:32,389
it's a fossil is one question
namely the ex you know the remnants of

8106
02:25:32,389 --> 02:25:32,399
namely the ex you know the remnants of
 

8107
02:25:32,399 --> 02:25:33,590
namely the ex you know the remnants of
an organism

8108
02:25:33,590 --> 02:25:33,600
an organism
 

8109
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:35,670
an organism
and how do you know if it was

8110
02:25:35,670 --> 02:25:35,680
and how do you know if it was
 

8111
02:25:35,680 --> 02:25:37,349
and how do you know if it was
manipulated by a human

8112
02:25:37,349 --> 02:25:37,359
manipulated by a human
 

8113
02:25:37,359 --> 02:25:39,750
manipulated by a human
you know this is a big problem in in

8114
02:25:39,750 --> 02:25:39,760
you know this is a big problem in in
 

8115
02:25:39,760 --> 02:25:42,790
you know this is a big problem in in
trying to figure out the oldest art

8116
02:25:42,790 --> 02:25:42,800
trying to figure out the oldest art
 

8117
02:25:42,800 --> 02:25:45,270
trying to figure out the oldest art
if you find scratchings on a bone

8118
02:25:45,270 --> 02:25:45,280
if you find scratchings on a bone
 

8119
02:25:45,280 --> 02:25:47,670
if you find scratchings on a bone
is that a tally is it is it someone

8120
02:25:47,670 --> 02:25:47,680
is that a tally is it is it someone
 

8121
02:25:47,680 --> 02:25:50,309
is that a tally is it is it someone
marking her her menstrual period is it

8122
02:25:50,309 --> 02:25:50,319
marking her her menstrual period is it
 

8123
02:25:50,319 --> 02:25:52,630
marking her her menstrual period is it
phases of the moon

or is it trampling by an antelope and

8126
02:25:55,110 --> 02:25:55,120
or is it trampling by an antelope and
 

8127
02:25:55,120 --> 02:25:56,309
or is it trampling by an antelope and
that's that's called the science of

8128
02:25:56,309 --> 02:25:56,319
that's that's called the science of
 

8129
02:25:56,319 --> 02:25:59,349
that's that's called the science of
taphonomy to discern when a marking on a

bone or a stone
 

8133
02:26:01,359 --> 02:26:04,150
bone or a stone
is in a sense a an artifact or a

8134
02:26:04,150 --> 02:26:04,160
is in a sense a an artifact or a
 

8135
02:26:04,160 --> 02:26:07,190
is in a sense a an artifact or a
geofactor an antelope effect

geofactor an antelope effect
 

8137
02:26:07,200 --> 02:26:08,950
geofactor an antelope effect
and that's it's an intellectually

8138
02:26:08,950 --> 02:26:08,960
and that's it's an intellectually
 

8139
02:26:08,960 --> 02:26:11,110
and that's it's an intellectually
challenging question and people want to

8140
02:26:11,110 --> 02:26:11,120
challenging question and people want to
 

8141
02:26:11,120 --> 02:26:12,790
challenging question and people want to
fantasize they'll find a stone it looks

8142
02:26:12,790 --> 02:26:12,800
fantasize they'll find a stone it looks
 

8143
02:26:12,800 --> 02:26:15,510
fantasize they'll find a stone it looks
like a carving is 300 000 years old

8144
02:26:15,510 --> 02:26:15,520
like a carving is 300 000 years old
 

8145
02:26:15,520 --> 02:26:17,990
like a carving is 300 000 years old
generally i think those are just

8146
02:26:17,990 --> 02:26:18,000
generally i think those are just
 

8147
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,630
generally i think those are just
odd stones yeah you don't find the

8148
02:26:20,630 --> 02:26:20,640
odd stones yeah you don't find the
 

8149
02:26:20,640 --> 02:26:22,630
odd stones yeah you don't find the
explosion

8150
02:26:22,630 --> 02:26:22,640
explosion
 

8151
02:26:22,640 --> 02:26:24,309
explosion
of carved stone

8152
02:26:24,309 --> 02:26:24,319
of carved stone
 

8153
02:26:24,319 --> 02:26:26,550
of carved stone
until around 60

8154
02:26:26,550 --> 02:26:26,560
until around 60
 

8155
02:26:26,560 --> 02:26:28,630
until around 60
000 years ago 50 60

8156
02:26:28,630 --> 02:26:28,640
000 years ago 50 60
 

8157
02:26:28,640 --> 02:26:30,070
000 years ago 50 60
000 years ago there seems to be

8158
02:26:30,070 --> 02:26:30,080
000 years ago there seems to be
 

8159
02:26:30,080 --> 02:26:31,710
000 years ago there seems to be
something that

8160
02:26:31,710 --> 02:26:31,720
something that
 

8161
02:26:31,720 --> 02:26:34,150
something that
paleontologists call the creative

8162
02:26:34,150 --> 02:26:34,160
paleontologists call the creative
 

8163
02:26:34,160 --> 02:26:37,270
paleontologists call the creative
explosion or the big bang of the mind

8164
02:26:37,270 --> 02:26:37,280
explosion or the big bang of the mind
 

8165
02:26:37,280 --> 02:26:41,510
explosion or the big bang of the mind
that produces a kind of ability to

8166
02:26:41,510 --> 02:26:41,520
that produces a kind of ability to
 

8167
02:26:41,520 --> 02:26:45,110
that produces a kind of ability to
to see in the distance to

8168
02:26:45,110 --> 02:26:45,120
to see in the distance to
 

8169
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:47,030
to see in the distance to
identify a shape

8170
02:26:47,030 --> 02:26:47,040
identify a shape
 

8171
02:26:47,040 --> 02:26:48,870
identify a shape
in an object to create a shape and an

8172
02:26:48,870 --> 02:26:48,880
in an object to create a shape and an
 

8173
02:26:48,880 --> 02:26:49,910
in an object to create a shape and an
object that you don't get the

8174
02:26:49,910 --> 02:26:49,920
object that you don't get the
 

8175
02:26:49,920 --> 02:26:51,270
object that you don't get the
neandertals

8176
02:26:51,270 --> 02:26:51,280
neandertals
 

8177
02:26:51,280 --> 02:26:53,349
neandertals
don't seem to have ever done what we

8178
02:26:53,349 --> 02:26:53,359
don't seem to have ever done what we
 

8179
02:26:53,359 --> 02:26:54,950
don't seem to have ever done what we
would call art

8180
02:26:54,950 --> 02:26:54,960
would call art
 

8181
02:26:54,960 --> 02:26:56,630
would call art
that's a very interesting

8182
02:26:56,630 --> 02:26:56,640
that's a very interesting
 

8183
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:58,070
that's a very interesting
phenomenon

8184
02:26:58,070 --> 02:26:58,080
phenomenon
 

8185
02:26:58,080 --> 02:26:59,750
phenomenon
you know but it requires that you have

8186
02:26:59,750 --> 02:26:59,760
you know but it requires that you have
 

8187
02:26:59,760 --> 02:27:01,349
you know but it requires that you have
some understanding

8188
02:27:01,349 --> 02:27:01,359
some understanding
 

8189
02:27:01,359 --> 02:27:03,270
some understanding
when is something art and when is it

8190
02:27:03,270 --> 02:27:03,280
when is something art and when is it
 

8191
02:27:03,280 --> 02:27:05,030
when is something art and when is it
just oh that's a rock that looks like a

8192
02:27:05,030 --> 02:27:05,040
just oh that's a rock that looks like a
 

8193
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:07,110
just oh that's a rock that looks like a
face or some not necessarily

8194
02:27:07,110 --> 02:27:07,120
face or some not necessarily
 

8195
02:27:07,120 --> 02:27:08,630
face or some not necessarily
understanding but a conception that's

8196
02:27:08,630 --> 02:27:08,640
understanding but a conception that's
 

8197
02:27:08,640 --> 02:27:10,630
understanding but a conception that's
mutually agreed upon right that we're

8198
02:27:10,630 --> 02:27:10,640
mutually agreed upon right that we're
 

8199
02:27:10,640 --> 02:27:12,150
mutually agreed upon right that we're
able to because

8200
02:27:12,150 --> 02:27:12,160
able to because
 

8201
02:27:12,160 --> 02:27:14,469
able to because
maybe neanderthals maybe fish having a

8202
02:27:14,469 --> 02:27:14,479
maybe neanderthals maybe fish having a
 

8203
02:27:14,479 --> 02:27:17,110
maybe neanderthals maybe fish having a
conception of art they just uh

8204
02:27:17,110 --> 02:27:17,120
conception of art they just uh
 

8205
02:27:17,120 --> 02:27:19,270
conception of art they just uh
and this this also gets back to your

8206
02:27:19,270 --> 02:27:19,280
and this this also gets back to your
 

8207
02:27:19,280 --> 02:27:21,670
and this this also gets back to your
question about professional bias and

8208
02:27:21,670 --> 02:27:21,680
question about professional bias and
 

8209
02:27:21,680 --> 02:27:24,630
question about professional bias and
ideology because there's a huge reward

8210
02:27:24,630 --> 02:27:24,640
ideology because there's a huge reward
 

8211
02:27:24,640 --> 02:27:27,349
ideology because there's a huge reward
for finding the oldest art yeah

8212
02:27:27,349 --> 02:27:27,359
for finding the oldest art yeah
 

8213
02:27:27,359 --> 02:27:30,150
for finding the oldest art yeah
yeah if if everyone says it's 50 000

8214
02:27:30,150 --> 02:27:30,160
yeah if if everyone says it's 50 000
 

8215
02:27:30,160 --> 02:27:32,070
yeah if if everyone says it's 50 000
years ago and you find one that's 300

8216
02:27:32,070 --> 02:27:32,080
years ago and you find one that's 300
 

8217
02:27:32,080 --> 02:27:35,270
years ago and you find one that's 300
000 years ago that's a huge discovery

8218
02:27:35,270 --> 02:27:35,280
000 years ago that's a huge discovery
 

8219
02:27:35,280 --> 02:27:37,270
000 years ago that's a huge discovery
so

8220
02:27:37,270 --> 02:27:37,280
so
 

8221
02:27:37,280 --> 02:27:39,110
so
there's a there's a bias and this has

8222
02:27:39,110 --> 02:27:39,120
there's a there's a bias and this has
 

8223
02:27:39,120 --> 02:27:40,550
there's a there's a bias and this has
been one of the

8224
02:27:40,550 --> 02:27:40,560
been one of the
 

8225
02:27:40,560 --> 02:27:42,469
been one of the
things that's led to the

8226
02:27:42,469 --> 02:27:42,479
things that's led to the
 

8227
02:27:42,479 --> 02:27:45,110
things that's led to the
probably the over-proliferation

8228
02:27:45,110 --> 02:27:45,120
probably the over-proliferation
 

8229
02:27:45,120 --> 02:27:48,469
probably the over-proliferation
of different species of hominids

8230
02:27:48,469 --> 02:27:48,479
of different species of hominids
 

8231
02:27:48,479 --> 02:27:51,190
of different species of hominids
because there's no academic reward for

8232
02:27:51,190 --> 02:27:51,200
because there's no academic reward for
 

8233
02:27:51,200 --> 02:27:53,429
because there's no academic reward for
finding yet another example of someone

8234
02:27:53,429 --> 02:27:53,439
finding yet another example of someone
 

8235
02:27:53,439 --> 02:27:54,950
finding yet another example of someone
else's species

8236
02:27:54,950 --> 02:27:54,960
else's species
 

8237
02:27:54,960 --> 02:27:57,510
else's species
but there's a huge reward

8238
02:27:57,510 --> 02:27:57,520
but there's a huge reward
 

8239
02:27:57,520 --> 02:27:59,429
but there's a huge reward
if you can find you know

8240
02:27:59,429 --> 02:27:59,439
if you can find you know
 

8241
02:27:59,439 --> 02:28:02,150
if you can find you know
uh a lex friedmanite you know

8242
02:28:02,150 --> 02:28:02,160
uh a lex friedmanite you know
 

8243
02:28:02,160 --> 02:28:03,910
uh a lex friedmanite you know
new you can name it after yourself or

8244
02:28:03,910 --> 02:28:03,920
new you can name it after yourself or
 

8245
02:28:03,920 --> 02:28:06,870
new you can name it after yourself or
whatever yeah uh new fossil yeah that

8246
02:28:06,870 --> 02:28:06,880
whatever yeah uh new fossil yeah that
 

8247
02:28:06,880 --> 02:28:08,550
whatever yeah uh new fossil yeah that
there's a huge professional reward to be

8248
02:28:08,550 --> 02:28:08,560
there's a huge professional reward to be
 

8249
02:28:08,560 --> 02:28:10,469
there's a huge professional reward to be
the first at something and so those

8250
02:28:10,469 --> 02:28:10,479
the first at something and so those
 

8251
02:28:10,479 --> 02:28:13,110
the first at something and so those
types of professional rewards

8252
02:28:13,110 --> 02:28:13,120
types of professional rewards
 

8253
02:28:13,120 --> 02:28:14,389
types of professional rewards
also

8254
02:28:14,389 --> 02:28:14,399
also
 

8255
02:28:14,399 --> 02:28:16,389
also
influence science and what kind of

8256
02:28:16,389 --> 02:28:16,399
influence science and what kind of
 

8257
02:28:16,399 --> 02:28:17,750
influence science and what kind of
science gets done

8258
02:28:17,750 --> 02:28:17,760
science gets done
 

8259
02:28:17,760 --> 02:28:20,389
science gets done
yeah so i'm always suspicious of uh

8260
02:28:20,389 --> 02:28:20,399
yeah so i'm always suspicious of uh
 

8261
02:28:20,399 --> 02:28:22,710
yeah so i'm always suspicious of uh
and as we should all be when you can

8262
02:28:22,710 --> 02:28:22,720
and as we should all be when you can
 

8263
02:28:22,720 --> 02:28:25,590
and as we should all be when you can
kind of intuit a financial and otherwise

8264
02:28:25,590 --> 02:28:25,600
kind of intuit a financial and otherwise
 

8265
02:28:25,600 --> 02:28:28,070
kind of intuit a financial and otherwise
motivation i mean that's actually

8266
02:28:28,070 --> 02:28:28,080
motivation i mean that's actually
 

8267
02:28:28,080 --> 02:28:29,590
motivation i mean that's actually
often in the modern age where i'm

8268
02:28:29,590 --> 02:28:29,600
often in the modern age where i'm
 

8269
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:32,070
often in the modern age where i'm
suspicious of conspiracy theories

8270
02:28:32,070 --> 02:28:32,080
suspicious of conspiracy theories
 

8271
02:28:32,080 --> 02:28:33,670
suspicious of conspiracy theories
it's not

8272
02:28:33,670 --> 02:28:33,680
it's not
 

8273
02:28:33,680 --> 02:28:35,510
it's not
that the logic doesn't make sense or

8274
02:28:35,510 --> 02:28:35,520
that the logic doesn't make sense or
 

8275
02:28:35,520 --> 02:28:36,710
that the logic doesn't make sense or
something like that i personally

8276
02:28:36,710 --> 02:28:36,720
something like that i personally
 

8277
02:28:36,720 --> 02:28:39,110
something like that i personally
actually just enjoy conspiracy theories

8278
02:28:39,110 --> 02:28:39,120
actually just enjoy conspiracy theories
 

8279
02:28:39,120 --> 02:28:41,270
actually just enjoy conspiracy theories
i've been listening to um flat earth has

8280
02:28:41,270 --> 02:28:41,280
i've been listening to um flat earth has
 

8281
02:28:41,280 --> 02:28:43,110
i've been listening to um flat earth has
discussed stuff recently it's kind of

8282
02:28:43,110 --> 02:28:43,120
discussed stuff recently it's kind of
 

8283
02:28:43,120 --> 02:28:45,190
discussed stuff recently it's kind of
exciting for some reason

8284
02:28:45,190 --> 02:28:45,200
exciting for some reason
 

8285
02:28:45,200 --> 02:28:47,349
exciting for some reason
it's like because i consider like what

8286
02:28:47,349 --> 02:28:47,359
it's like because i consider like what
 

8287
02:28:47,359 --> 02:28:49,910
it's like because i consider like what
if it's true it's exciting to discover

8288
02:28:49,910 --> 02:28:49,920
if it's true it's exciting to discover
 

8289
02:28:49,920 --> 02:28:51,830
if it's true it's exciting to discover
together like think through first

8290
02:28:51,830 --> 02:28:51,840
together like think through first
 

8291
02:28:51,840 --> 02:28:54,070
together like think through first
principles like what does the world look

8292
02:28:54,070 --> 02:28:54,080
principles like what does the world look
 

8293
02:28:54,080 --> 02:28:56,070
principles like what does the world look
like it's exciting i mean it's the

8294
02:28:56,070 --> 02:28:56,080
like it's exciting i mean it's the
 

8295
02:28:56,080 --> 02:28:59,270
like it's exciting i mean it's the
childlike discovery of a new idea uh but

8296
02:28:59,270 --> 02:28:59,280
childlike discovery of a new idea uh but
 

8297
02:28:59,280 --> 02:29:00,950
childlike discovery of a new idea uh but
the the reason i'm skeptical of a lot of

8298
02:29:00,950 --> 02:29:00,960
the the reason i'm skeptical of a lot of
 

8299
02:29:00,960 --> 02:29:03,190
the the reason i'm skeptical of a lot of
conspiracy theories is

8300
02:29:03,190 --> 02:29:03,200
conspiracy theories is
 

8301
02:29:03,200 --> 02:29:06,550
conspiracy theories is
when i see how popular you can get

8302
02:29:06,550 --> 02:29:06,560
when i see how popular you can get
 

8303
02:29:06,560 --> 02:29:08,150
when i see how popular you can get
propagating those conspiracy theories

8304
02:29:08,150 --> 02:29:08,160
propagating those conspiracy theories
 

8305
02:29:08,160 --> 02:29:10,950
propagating those conspiracy theories
how quickly it can form a large movement

8306
02:29:10,950 --> 02:29:10,960
how quickly it can form a large movement
 

8307
02:29:10,960 --> 02:29:13,110
how quickly it can form a large movement
and it's like

8308
02:29:13,110 --> 02:29:13,120
and it's like
 

8309
02:29:13,120 --> 02:29:13,830
and it's like
like

8310
02:29:13,830 --> 02:29:13,840
like
 

8311
02:29:13,840 --> 02:29:15,750
like
such thin evidence it's like if loch

8312
02:29:15,750 --> 02:29:15,760
such thin evidence it's like if loch
 

8313
02:29:15,760 --> 02:29:18,469
such thin evidence it's like if loch
ness exists there's just one i mean how

8314
02:29:18,469 --> 02:29:18,479
ness exists there's just one i mean how
 

8315
02:29:18,479 --> 02:29:19,670
ness exists there's just one i mean how
does the

8316
02:29:19,670 --> 02:29:19,680
does the
 

8317
02:29:19,680 --> 02:29:21,590
does the
reproduction work on that but now you

8318
02:29:21,590 --> 02:29:21,600
reproduction work on that but now you
 

8319
02:29:21,600 --> 02:29:24,070
reproduction work on that but now you
talk about an animal that has only one

8320
02:29:24,070 --> 02:29:24,080
talk about an animal that has only one
 

8321
02:29:24,080 --> 02:29:25,990
talk about an animal that has only one
in a population it just doesn't some of

8322
02:29:25,990 --> 02:29:26,000
in a population it just doesn't some of
 

8323
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:27,429
in a population it just doesn't some of
the things don't make sense no but see

8324
02:29:27,429 --> 02:29:27,439
the things don't make sense no but see
 

8325
02:29:27,439 --> 02:29:29,750
the things don't make sense no but see
this is the logic side i don't even go

8326
02:29:29,750 --> 02:29:29,760
this is the logic side i don't even go
 

8327
02:29:29,760 --> 02:29:31,510
this is the logic side i don't even go
that far i i

8328
02:29:31,510 --> 02:29:31,520
that far i i
 

8329
02:29:31,520 --> 02:29:33,030
that far i i
the fact is if you say there's a loch

8330
02:29:33,030 --> 02:29:33,040
the fact is if you say there's a loch
 

8331
02:29:33,040 --> 02:29:35,030
the fact is if you say there's a loch
ness monster i just see how quickly the

8332
02:29:35,030 --> 02:29:35,040
ness monster i just see how quickly the
 

8333
02:29:35,040 --> 02:29:37,110
ness monster i just see how quickly the
idea spreads in popularity

8334
02:29:37,110 --> 02:29:37,120
idea spreads in popularity
 

8335
02:29:37,120 --> 02:29:39,270
idea spreads in popularity
it's the people are hungry to discover

8336
02:29:39,270 --> 02:29:39,280
it's the people are hungry to discover
 

8337
02:29:39,280 --> 02:29:41,349
it's the people are hungry to discover
something new just like you mentioned

8338
02:29:41,349 --> 02:29:41,359
something new just like you mentioned
 

8339
02:29:41,359 --> 02:29:44,070
something new just like you mentioned
uh with the hominids and i'm very

8340
02:29:44,070 --> 02:29:44,080
uh with the hominids and i'm very
 

8341
02:29:44,080 --> 02:29:46,630
uh with the hominids and i'm very
suspicious of where there's like a

8342
02:29:46,630 --> 02:29:46,640
suspicious of where there's like a
 

8343
02:29:46,640 --> 02:29:48,469
suspicious of where there's like a
strange hunger

8344
02:29:48,469 --> 02:29:48,479
strange hunger
 

8345
02:29:48,479 --> 02:29:50,550
strange hunger
for ideas because then

8346
02:29:50,550 --> 02:29:50,560
for ideas because then
 

8347
02:29:50,560 --> 02:29:52,469
for ideas because then
they're they're less likely to be

8348
02:29:52,469 --> 02:29:52,479
they're they're less likely to be
 

8349
02:29:52,479 --> 02:29:54,550
they're they're less likely to be
objective and rigorous in considering

8350
02:29:54,550 --> 02:29:54,560
objective and rigorous in considering
 

8351
02:29:54,560 --> 02:29:57,110
objective and rigorous in considering
the validity of that idea i'm not going

8352
02:29:57,110 --> 02:29:57,120
the validity of that idea i'm not going
 

8353
02:29:57,120 --> 02:30:00,389
the validity of that idea i'm not going
to the logic because actually flat earth

8354
02:30:00,389 --> 02:30:00,399
to the logic because actually flat earth
 

8355
02:30:00,399 --> 02:30:03,990
to the logic because actually flat earth
is pretty logical yeah very logical if

8356
02:30:03,990 --> 02:30:04,000
is pretty logical yeah very logical if
 

8357
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:05,910
is pretty logical yeah very logical if
your logic is not the problem

8358
02:30:05,910 --> 02:30:05,920
your logic is not the problem
 

8359
02:30:05,920 --> 02:30:08,469
your logic is not the problem
right so it's but this spreads really

8360
02:30:08,469 --> 02:30:08,479
right so it's but this spreads really
 

8361
02:30:08,479 --> 02:30:10,469
right so it's but this spreads really
quickly and i and i once again with

8362
02:30:10,469 --> 02:30:10,479
quickly and i and i once again with
 

8363
02:30:10,479 --> 02:30:11,990
quickly and i and i once again with
conspiracy theories i think it

8364
02:30:11,990 --> 02:30:12,000
conspiracy theories i think it
 

8365
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:13,830
conspiracy theories i think it
represents it's you have to think about

8366
02:30:13,830 --> 02:30:13,840
represents it's you have to think about
 

8367
02:30:13,840 --> 02:30:15,429
represents it's you have to think about
the cause of causes

8368
02:30:15,429 --> 02:30:15,439
the cause of causes
 

8369
02:30:15,439 --> 02:30:17,590
the cause of causes
or cause of cause of causes like you

8370
02:30:17,590 --> 02:30:17,600
or cause of cause of causes like you
 

8371
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:19,190
or cause of cause of causes like you
talked about which is like it represents

8372
02:30:19,190 --> 02:30:19,200
talked about which is like it represents
 

8373
02:30:19,200 --> 02:30:20,550
talked about which is like it represents
some deeper

8374
02:30:20,550 --> 02:30:20,560
some deeper
 

8375
02:30:20,560 --> 02:30:22,710
some deeper
uh fragmenting

8376
02:30:22,710 --> 02:30:22,720
uh fragmenting
 

8377
02:30:22,720 --> 02:30:23,830
uh fragmenting
of the

8378
02:30:23,830 --> 02:30:23,840
of the
 

8379
02:30:23,840 --> 02:30:26,150
of the
the common humanity we have the

8380
02:30:26,150 --> 02:30:26,160
the common humanity we have the
 

8381
02:30:26,160 --> 02:30:27,110
the common humanity we have the

02:30:29,270 --> 02:30:29,280
the trust in the
 

8385
02:30:29,280 --> 02:30:31,349
the trust in the
in the in the big

8386
02:30:31,349 --> 02:30:31,359
in the in the big
 

8387
02:30:31,359 --> 02:30:33,270
in the in the big
community that is science and the big

8388
02:30:33,270 --> 02:30:33,280
community that is science and the big
 

8389
02:30:33,280 --> 02:30:34,870
community that is science and the big
community that is government all that

8390
02:30:34,870 --> 02:30:34,880
community that is government all that
 

8391
02:30:34,880 --> 02:30:36,230
community that is government all that
kind of stuff

8392
02:30:36,230 --> 02:30:36,240
kind of stuff
 

8393
02:30:36,240 --> 02:30:37,429
kind of stuff
well that's why things like ball

8394
02:30:37,429 --> 02:30:37,439
well that's why things like ball
 

8395
02:30:37,439 --> 02:30:40,309
well that's why things like ball
lightning are cool because it's like

8396
02:30:40,309 --> 02:30:40,319
lightning are cool because it's like
 

8397
02:30:40,319 --> 02:30:42,710
lightning are cool because it's like
the scientists denied it but here it is

8398
02:30:42,710 --> 02:30:42,720
the scientists denied it but here it is
 

8399
02:30:42,720 --> 02:30:45,110
the scientists denied it but here it is
exactly exactly and that's ultimately

8400
02:30:45,110 --> 02:30:45,120
exactly exactly and that's ultimately
 

8401
02:30:45,120 --> 02:30:47,349
exactly exactly and that's ultimately
ends up everyone said i was insane but

8402
02:30:47,349 --> 02:30:47,359
ends up everyone said i was insane but
 

8403
02:30:47,359 --> 02:30:48,630
ends up everyone said i was insane but
uh

8404
02:30:48,630 --> 02:30:48,640
uh
 

8405
02:30:48,640 --> 02:30:50,150
uh
and but it's still exciting you said

8406
02:30:50,150 --> 02:30:50,160
and but it's still exciting you said
 

8407
02:30:50,160 --> 02:30:51,510
and but it's still exciting you said
there's some breakthroughs i need to

8408
02:30:51,510 --> 02:30:51,520
there's some breakthroughs i need to
 

8409
02:30:51,520 --> 02:30:53,510
there's some breakthroughs i need to
look it up yeah that's really cool it's

8410
02:30:53,510 --> 02:30:53,520
look it up yeah that's really cool it's
 

8411
02:30:53,520 --> 02:30:55,110
look it up yeah that's really cool it's
pretty exciting yeah there's some new

8412
02:30:55,110 --> 02:30:55,120
pretty exciting yeah there's some new
 

8413
02:30:55,120 --> 02:30:57,190
pretty exciting yeah there's some new
theories of how it actually might

8414
02:30:57,190 --> 02:30:57,200
theories of how it actually might
 

8415
02:30:57,200 --> 02:30:58,870
theories of how it actually might
because i think i mean there's obviously

8416
02:30:58,870 --> 02:30:58,880
because i think i mean there's obviously
 

8417
02:30:58,880 --> 02:31:00,389
because i think i mean there's obviously
several ways to prove that like one of

8418
02:31:00,389 --> 02:31:00,399
several ways to prove that like one of
 

8419
02:31:00,399 --> 02:31:03,190
several ways to prove that like one of
them is to recreate in the lab which is

8420
02:31:03,190 --> 02:31:03,200
them is to recreate in the lab which is
 

8421
02:31:03,200 --> 02:31:04,630
them is to recreate in the lab which is
standard that's probably very very

8422
02:31:04,630 --> 02:31:04,640
standard that's probably very very
 

8423
02:31:04,640 --> 02:31:05,670
standard that's probably very very
difficult

8424
02:31:05,670 --> 02:31:05,680
difficult
 

8425
02:31:05,680 --> 02:31:07,670
difficult
um just because we're on the topic of

8426
02:31:07,670 --> 02:31:07,680
um just because we're on the topic of
 

8427
02:31:07,680 --> 02:31:08,630
um just because we're on the topic of
rocks

8428
02:31:08,630 --> 02:31:08,640
rocks
 

8429
02:31:08,640 --> 02:31:10,710
rocks
i don't know if you've heard about this

8430
02:31:10,710 --> 02:31:10,720
i don't know if you've heard about this
 

8431
02:31:10,720 --> 02:31:12,630
i don't know if you've heard about this
interstellar rock that flew through our

8432
02:31:12,630 --> 02:31:12,640
interstellar rock that flew through our
 

8433
02:31:12,640 --> 02:31:15,349
interstellar rock that flew through our
uh called the muammar yes

8434
02:31:15,349 --> 02:31:15,359
uh called the muammar yes
 

8435
02:31:15,359 --> 02:31:17,590
uh called the muammar yes
the cigar-shaped one the cigar was a fan

8436
02:31:17,590 --> 02:31:17,600
the cigar-shaped one the cigar was a fan
 

8437
02:31:17,600 --> 02:31:18,790
the cigar-shaped one the cigar was a fan
of rocks what do you think about that

8438
02:31:18,790 --> 02:31:18,800
of rocks what do you think about that
 

8439
02:31:18,800 --> 02:31:20,790
of rocks what do you think about that
one so well i think that

8440
02:31:20,790 --> 02:31:20,800
one so well i think that
 

8441
02:31:20,800 --> 02:31:23,110
one so well i think that
generally i mean when the people were

8442
02:31:23,110 --> 02:31:23,120
generally i mean when the people were
 

8443
02:31:23,120 --> 02:31:25,830
generally i mean when the people were
speculating it might be a spaceship i

8444
02:31:25,830 --> 02:31:25,840
speculating it might be a spaceship i
 

8445
02:31:25,840 --> 02:31:27,830
speculating it might be a spaceship i
thought come on rocks do all kinds of

8446
02:31:27,830 --> 02:31:27,840
thought come on rocks do all kinds of
 

8447
02:31:27,840 --> 02:31:30,070
thought come on rocks do all kinds of
crazy things they do a lot more than you

8448
02:31:30,070 --> 02:31:30,080
crazy things they do a lot more than you
 

8449
02:31:30,080 --> 02:31:32,309
crazy things they do a lot more than you
realize they can do unbelievable

8450
02:31:32,309 --> 02:31:32,319
realize they can do unbelievable
 

8451
02:31:32,319 --> 02:31:33,910
realize they can do unbelievable
unbelievably cool things they're parts

8452
02:31:33,910 --> 02:31:33,920
unbelievably cool things they're parts
 

8453
02:31:33,920 --> 02:31:35,590
unbelievably cool things they're parts
of the desert

8454
02:31:35,590 --> 02:31:35,600
of the desert
 

8455
02:31:35,600 --> 02:31:38,550
of the desert
they're in in utah where rocks move and

8456
02:31:38,550 --> 02:31:38,560
they're in in utah where rocks move and
 

8457
02:31:38,560 --> 02:31:41,670
they're in in utah where rocks move and
create these long tracks and it's now we

8458
02:31:41,670 --> 02:31:41,680
create these long tracks and it's now we
 

8459
02:31:41,680 --> 02:31:45,429
create these long tracks and it's now we
know it's from liquefaction and and

8460
02:31:45,429 --> 02:31:45,439
know it's from liquefaction and and
 

8461
02:31:45,439 --> 02:31:47,030
know it's from liquefaction and and
and wind and various things but they're

8462
02:31:47,030 --> 02:31:47,040
and wind and various things but they're
 

8463
02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:49,670
and wind and various things but they're
still unbelievably cool rocks can do

8464
02:31:49,670 --> 02:31:49,680
still unbelievably cool rocks can do
 

8465
02:31:49,680 --> 02:31:51,030
still unbelievably cool rocks can do
almost anything

8466
02:31:51,030 --> 02:31:51,040
almost anything
 

8467
02:31:51,040 --> 02:31:54,150
almost anything
and so just the fact that one comes from

8468
02:31:54,150 --> 02:31:54,160
and so just the fact that one comes from
 

8469
02:31:54,160 --> 02:31:55,750
and so just the fact that one comes from
outside the solar system doesn't mean it

8470
02:31:55,750 --> 02:31:55,760
outside the solar system doesn't mean it
 

8471
02:31:55,760 --> 02:31:57,750
outside the solar system doesn't mean it
has to be a spaceship

8472
02:31:57,750 --> 02:31:57,760
has to be a spaceship
 

8473
02:31:57,760 --> 02:31:59,270
has to be a spaceship
so but nonetheless i thought it was

8474
02:31:59,270 --> 02:31:59,280
so but nonetheless i thought it was
 

8475
02:31:59,280 --> 02:32:01,190
so but nonetheless i thought it was
awesome i thought it was really

8476
02:32:01,190 --> 02:32:01,200
awesome i thought it was really
 

8477
02:32:01,200 --> 02:32:03,190
awesome i thought it was really
really cool and i i sort of

8478
02:32:03,190 --> 02:32:03,200
really cool and i i sort of
 

8479
02:32:03,200 --> 02:32:05,110
really cool and i i sort of
wish it would happen more often i kind

8480
02:32:05,110 --> 02:32:05,120
wish it would happen more often i kind
 

8481
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:07,429
wish it would happen more often i kind
of hope it's trash from another alien

8482
02:32:07,429 --> 02:32:07,439
of hope it's trash from another alien
 

8483
02:32:07,439 --> 02:32:09,590
of hope it's trash from another alien
civilization that'd be fantastic because

8484
02:32:09,590 --> 02:32:09,600
civilization that'd be fantastic because
 

8485
02:32:09,600 --> 02:32:11,830
civilization that'd be fantastic because
if you're uh

8486

if you're uh
 

8487
02:32:11,840 --> 02:32:14,230
if you're uh
if if humans are all a lesson that we

8488
02:32:14,230 --> 02:32:14,240
if if humans are all a lesson that we
 

8489
02:32:14,240 --> 02:32:15,990
if if humans are all a lesson that we
produce like more trash than we do

8490
02:32:15,990 --> 02:32:16,000
produce like more trash than we do
 

8491
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:17,910
produce like more trash than we do
intelligent signal

8492
02:32:17,910 --> 02:32:17,920
intelligent signal
 

8493
02:32:17,920 --> 02:32:20,230
intelligent signal
and so the first thing to reach other

8494
02:32:20,230 --> 02:32:20,240
and so the first thing to reach other
 

8495
02:32:20,240 --> 02:32:21,990
and so the first thing to reach other
civilizations i feel like would be our

8496
02:32:21,990 --> 02:32:22,000
civilizations i feel like would be our
 

8497
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,389
civilizations i feel like would be our
trash our pollution

8498
02:32:24,389 --> 02:32:24,399
trash our pollution
 

8499
02:32:24,399 --> 02:32:26,309
trash our pollution
before the intelligence signal reaches

8500
02:32:26,309 --> 02:32:26,319
before the intelligence signal reaches
 

8501
02:32:26,319 --> 02:32:28,070
before the intelligence signal reaches
them

8502
02:32:28,070 --> 02:32:28,080
them
 

8503
02:32:28,080 --> 02:32:29,510

8555
02:33:23,040 --> 02:33:24,870
ideology in biology in russia at the
time that led to their distrust of

time that led to their distrust of
 

8557
02:33:24,880 --> 02:33:26,150

lamarckian theories of heredity and
 

8577
02:33:45,120 --> 02:33:46,830
lamarckian theories of heredity and
rejected that part of

or
through the cracks or you never know

8630
02:34:42,070 --> 02:34:42,080
through the cracks or you never know
 

8631
02:34:42,080 --> 02:34:43,670
through the cracks or you never know
when something fails

8632
02:34:43,670 --> 02:34:43,680
when something fails
 

8633
02:34:43,680 --> 02:34:45,429
when something fails
you don't always know why it failed but

8634
02:34:45,429 --> 02:34:45,439
you don't always know why it failed but
 

8635
02:34:45,439 --> 02:34:47,510
you don't always know why it failed but
i was very disappointed and it sort of

i was very disappointed and it sort of
 

8637
02:34:47,520 --> 02:34:48,790
i was very disappointed and it sort of
ended that

8638
02:34:48,790 --> 02:34:48,800
ended that
 

8639
02:34:48,800 --> 02:34:50,630
ended that
the project i didn't have access to

8640
02:34:50,630 --> 02:34:50,640
the project i didn't have access to
 

8641
02:34:50,640 --> 02:34:52,150
the project i didn't have access to
archives on it

8642
02:34:52,150 --> 02:34:52,160
archives on it
 

8643
02:34:52,160 --> 02:34:54,230
archives on it
i could have obviously done it later but

8644
02:34:54,230 --> 02:34:54,240
i could have obviously done it later but

uh you know so like there was that
curiosity initially but and then you

8648
02:34:58,389 --> 02:34:58,399
curiosity initially but and then you
 

8649
02:34:58,399 --> 02:35:01,270
curiosity initially but and then you
focused on nazi and on the nazi side of

focused on nazi and on the nazi side of
yeah i mean the other thing was i was

taiwan and it was one in 50 odds of
 

8665
02:35:16,319 --> 02:35:20,070
taiwan and it was one in 50 odds of

and
 

8747
02:36:34,640 --> 02:36:37,110
and
therefore anti-genetics

8748
02:36:37,110 --> 02:36:37,120
therefore anti-genetics
 

8749
02:36:37,120 --> 02:36:39,830
therefore anti-genetics
and they saw genetics as essentially

8750
02:36:39,830 --> 02:36:39,840
and they saw genetics as essentially
 

8751
02:36:39,840 --> 02:36:41,830
and they saw genetics as essentially
nazi and that was enough for me i know

8752
02:36:41,830 --> 02:36:41,840
nazi and that was enough for me i know
 

8753
02:36:41,840 --> 02:36:43,510
nazi and that was enough for me i know

8757
02:36:45,120 --> 02:36:47,030
have enough time i wasn't allowed to go
and actually research it

8758
02:36:47,030 --> 02:36:47,040
and actually research it
 

8759
02:36:47,040 --> 02:36:48,790
and actually research it
in the german case

8760

few people
 

8997
02:41:01,840 --> 02:41:03,910
few people
elderly people people who had sort of

02:41:03,910 --> 02:41:03,920
elderly people people who had sort of
 

8999
02:41:03,920 --> 02:41:05,670
elderly people people who had sort of
slipped through the cracks you know

slipped through the cracks you know
 

9001
02:41:05,680 --> 02:41:08,389
slipped through the cracks you know
maybe even should have been prosecuted

9002
02:41:08,389 --> 02:41:08,399
maybe even should have been prosecuted
 

9003
02:41:08,399 --> 02:41:10,870

you know
 

9013
02:41:17,439 --> 02:41:20,790
you know
on these topics and they were guarded

9014
02:41:20,790 --> 02:41:20,800
on these topics and they were guarded
 

9015
02:41:20,800 --> 02:41:23,750
on these topics and they were guarded
but

9016
02:41:23,750 --> 02:41:23,760

 

9017
02:41:23,760 --> 02:41:25,429

these were the lives they lived and you

9018
02:41:25,429 --> 02:41:25,439
these were the lives they lived and you
 

9019
02:41:25,439 --> 02:41:27,510
these were the lives they lived and you
know mainly they wanted

9020
02:41:27,510 --> 02:41:27,520
know mainly they wanted
 

9021

people not to be talking too much about
 

9023
02:41:29,439 --> 02:41:32,389
people not to be talking too much about
this so it gets sealed off and walled

9024
02:41:32,389 --> 02:41:32,399
this so it gets sealed off and walled
 

9025
02:41:32,399 --> 02:41:34,230
this so it gets sealed off and walled
off and that's why the reading the

9026
02:41:34,230 --> 02:41:34,240
off and that's why the reading the
 

9027
02:41:34,240 --> 02:41:36,070
off and that's why the reading the
medical literature itself was so much

9028
02:41:36,070 --> 02:41:36,080
medical literature itself was so much
 

9029
02:41:36,080 --> 02:41:38,309
medical literature itself was so much
more valuable

9030
02:41:38,309 --> 02:41:38,319
more valuable
 

9031
02:41:38,319 --> 02:41:39,670
more valuable
because there's no

9111
02:43:03,359 --> 02:43:06,309
that even the loggers couldn't kill
right and so from these

9112
02:43:06,309 --> 02:43:06,319
right and so from these
 

9113
02:43:06,319 --> 02:43:07,830
right and so from these
stumps you get what are called fairy

9114
02:43:07,830 --> 02:43:07,840
stumps you get what are called fairy
 

9115
02:43:07,840 --> 02:43:10,790
stumps you get what are called fairy
rings which are you know like five trees

9116
02:43:10,790 --> 02:43:10,800
rings which are you know like five trees
 

9117
02:43:10,800 --> 02:43:12,469
rings which are you know like five trees
coming in a ring around it each one

9118
02:43:12,469 --> 02:43:12,479
coming in a ring around it each one
 

9119
02:43:12,479 --> 02:43:15,990
coming in a ring around it each one
competing to be the successor so they've

9120
02:43:15,990 --> 02:43:16,000
competing to be the successor so they've
 

9121
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,230
competing to be the successor so they've
seen this story before

9122
02:43:18,230 --> 02:43:18,240
seen this story before
 

9123
02:43:18,240 --> 02:43:19,750
seen this story before
and they know to

9124
02:43:19,750 --> 02:43:19,760
and they know to
 

9125
02:43:19,760 --> 02:43:22,550
and they know to
to re-sprout yeah and

9126
02:43:22,550 --> 02:43:22,560
to re-sprout yeah and
 

9127
02:43:22,560 --> 02:43:23,990
to re-sprout yeah and
that i think is a very hopeful thing is

9128
02:43:23,990 --> 02:43:24,000
that i think is a very hopeful thing is
 

9129
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:27,110
that i think is a very hopeful thing is
that the roots are old growth and

9130
02:43:27,110 --> 02:43:27,120
that the roots are old growth and
 

9131
02:43:27,120 --> 02:43:29,830
that the roots are old growth and
hopefully in 100 200 300 years

9132
02:43:29,830 --> 02:43:29,840
hopefully in 100 200 300 years
 

9133
02:43:29,840 --> 02:43:31,510
hopefully in 100 200 300 years
it won't peak until around a thousand

9134
02:43:31,510 --> 02:43:31,520
it won't peak until around a thousand
 

9135
02:43:31,520 --> 02:43:34,230
it won't peak until around a thousand
years from now you'll get these

9136
02:43:34,230 --> 02:43:34,240
years from now you'll get these
 

9137
02:43:34,240 --> 02:43:37,110
years from now you'll get these
restoration of all of this magnificent

9138
02:43:37,110 --> 02:43:37,120
restoration of all of this magnificent
 

9139
02:43:37,120 --> 02:43:39,510
restoration of all of this magnificent
uh old growth

9140
02:43:39,510 --> 02:43:39,520
uh old growth
 

9141
02:43:39,520 --> 02:43:41,750
uh old growth
um but so many other things you know

9142
02:43:41,750 --> 02:43:41,760
um but so many other things you know
 

9143
02:43:41,760 --> 02:43:43,590
um but so many other things you know
give me hope you know we have to have

9144
02:43:43,590 --> 02:43:43,600
give me hope you know we have to have
 

9145
02:43:43,600 --> 02:43:46,150
give me hope you know we have to have
hope and i think that uh

9146
02:43:46,150 --> 02:43:46,160
hope and i think that uh
 

9147
02:43:46,160 --> 02:43:47,910
hope and i think that uh
if the world is infinite there's

9148
02:43:47,910 --> 02:43:47,920
if the world is infinite there's
 

9149
02:43:47,920 --> 02:43:49,990
if the world is infinite there's
infinitely many many ways for it to

9150
02:43:49,990 --> 02:43:50,000
infinitely many many ways for it to
 

9151
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:51,190
infinitely many many ways for it to
become

9152
02:43:51,190 --> 02:43:51,200
become
 

9153
02:43:51,200 --> 02:43:53,349
become
fixed i mean obvious that we have some

9154
02:43:53,349 --> 02:43:53,359
fixed i mean obvious that we have some
 

9155
02:43:53,359 --> 02:43:54,790
fixed i mean obvious that we have some
problems need to be fixed but they're

9156
02:43:54,790 --> 02:43:54,800
problems need to be fixed but they're
 

9157
02:43:54,800 --> 02:43:57,349
problems need to be fixed but they're
fixable that's really beautifully put

9158
02:43:57,349 --> 02:43:57,359
fixable that's really beautifully put
 

9159
02:43:57,359 --> 02:44:00,070
fixable that's really beautifully put
that is a really hopeful idea that

9160
02:44:00,070 --> 02:44:00,080
that is a really hopeful idea that
 

9161
02:44:00,080 --> 02:44:03,510
that is a really hopeful idea that
nature that life even human civilization

9162
02:44:03,510 --> 02:44:03,520
nature that life even human civilization
 

9163
02:44:03,520 --> 02:44:05,590
nature that life even human civilization
is resilient to all the mistakes we make

9164
02:44:05,590 --> 02:44:05,600
is resilient to all the mistakes we make
 

9165
02:44:05,600 --> 02:44:08,950
is resilient to all the mistakes we make
so the roots are there so it outlives us

9166
02:44:08,950 --> 02:44:08,960
so the roots are there so it outlives us
 

9167
02:44:08,960 --> 02:44:10,950
so the roots are there so it outlives us
it's patient with our

9168
02:44:10,950 --> 02:44:10,960
it's patient with our
 

9169
02:44:10,960 --> 02:44:12,309
it's patient with our
adolescent

9170
02:44:12,309 --> 02:44:12,319
adolescent
 

9171
02:44:12,319 --> 02:44:13,830
adolescent
fuck-ups

9172
02:44:13,830 --> 02:44:13,840
fuck-ups
 

9173
02:44:13,840 --> 02:44:17,110
fuck-ups
i mean we're a thin layer on the crust

9174
02:44:17,110 --> 02:44:17,120
i mean we're a thin layer on the crust
 

9175
02:44:17,120 --> 02:44:18,630
i mean we're a thin layer on the crust
and you know eventually the earth will

9176
02:44:18,630 --> 02:44:18,640
and you know eventually the earth will
 

9177
02:44:18,640 --> 02:44:20,550
and you know eventually the earth will
be swallowed by the sun and

9178
02:44:20,550 --> 02:44:20,560
be swallowed by the sun and
 

9179
02:44:20,560 --> 02:44:22,070
be swallowed by the sun and
humans won't it will have long gone

9180
02:44:22,070 --> 02:44:22,080
humans won't it will have long gone
 

9181
02:44:22,080 --> 02:44:23,670
humans won't it will have long gone
extinct by then

9182
02:44:23,670 --> 02:44:23,680
extinct by then
 

9183
02:44:23,680 --> 02:44:24,630
extinct by then
um

9184
02:44:24,630 --> 02:44:24,640
um
 

9185
02:44:24,640 --> 02:44:26,150
um
but yeah there's all kinds around

9186
02:44:26,150 --> 02:44:26,160
but yeah there's all kinds around
 

9187
02:44:26,160 --> 02:44:27,830
but yeah there's all kinds around
grounds for hope

9188
02:44:27,830 --> 02:44:27,840
grounds for hope
 

9189
02:44:27,840 --> 02:44:28,950
grounds for hope
uh so

9190
02:44:28,950 --> 02:44:28,960
uh so
 

9191
02:44:28,960 --> 02:44:30,230
uh so
us being a

9192
02:44:30,230 --> 02:44:30,240
us being a
 

9193
02:44:30,240 --> 02:44:32,389
us being a
thin layer of crust

9194
02:44:32,389 --> 02:44:32,399
thin layer of crust
 

9195
02:44:32,399 --> 02:44:34,230
thin layer of crust
what do you think is the meaning of this

9196
02:44:34,230 --> 02:44:34,240
what do you think is the meaning of this
 

9197
02:44:34,240 --> 02:44:35,830
what do you think is the meaning of this
layer what's the meaning of human

9198
02:44:35,830 --> 02:44:35,840
layer what's the meaning of human
 

9199
02:44:35,840 --> 02:44:37,590
layer what's the meaning of human
existence what's the meaning of life

9200
02:44:37,590 --> 02:44:37,600
existence what's the meaning of life
 

9201
02:44:37,600 --> 02:44:39,269
existence what's the meaning of life
well i think it depends who you're

9202
02:44:39,269 --> 02:44:39,279
well i think it depends who you're
 

9203
02:44:39,279 --> 02:44:40,950
well i think it depends who you're
talking to if you're

9204
02:44:40,950 --> 02:44:40,960
talking to if you're
 

9205
02:44:40,960 --> 02:44:43,510
talking to if you're
talking to a raccoon it might be

9206
02:44:43,510 --> 02:44:43,520
talking to a raccoon it might be
 

9207
02:44:43,520 --> 02:44:45,429
talking to a raccoon it might be
one thing if you're talking to an growth

9208
02:44:45,429 --> 02:44:45,439
one thing if you're talking to an growth
 

9209
02:44:45,439 --> 02:44:46,710
one thing if you're talking to an growth
tree

9210
02:44:46,710 --> 02:44:46,720
tree
 

9211
02:44:46,720 --> 02:44:48,630
tree
it's making sure you're straight up

9212
02:44:48,630 --> 02:44:48,640
it's making sure you're straight up
 

9213
02:44:48,640 --> 02:44:50,469
it's making sure you're straight up
upright and not you know on a slippery

9214
02:44:50,469 --> 02:44:50,479
upright and not you know on a slippery
 

9215
02:44:50,479 --> 02:44:52,389
upright and not you know on a slippery
slope of fish

9216
02:44:52,389 --> 02:44:52,399
slope of fish
 

9217
02:44:52,399 --> 02:44:53,910
slope of fish
yeah fish i guess they're trying to

9218
02:44:53,910 --> 02:44:53,920
yeah fish i guess they're trying to
 

9219
02:44:53,920 --> 02:44:55,349
yeah fish i guess they're trying to
avoid the hook

9220
02:44:55,349 --> 02:44:55,359
avoid the hook
 

9221
02:44:55,359 --> 02:44:57,510
avoid the hook
yeah right no fish ever

9222
02:44:57,510 --> 02:44:57,520
yeah right no fish ever
 

9223
02:44:57,520 --> 02:44:59,510
yeah right no fish ever
when they take the bait no fish in the

9224
02:44:59,510 --> 02:44:59,520
when they take the bait no fish in the
 

9225
02:44:59,520 --> 02:45:02,150
when they take the bait no fish in the
world has ever said i hope i get hooked

9226
02:45:02,150 --> 02:45:02,160
world has ever said i hope i get hooked
 

9227
02:45:02,160 --> 02:45:04,150
world has ever said i hope i get hooked
um and that's that's one of the problems

9228
02:45:04,150 --> 02:45:04,160
um and that's that's one of the problems
 

9229
02:45:04,160 --> 02:45:06,150
um and that's that's one of the problems
with tobacco is that there's all this

9230
02:45:06,150 --> 02:45:06,160
with tobacco is that there's all this
 

9231
02:45:06,160 --> 02:45:07,429
with tobacco is that there's all this
bait and

9232
02:45:07,429 --> 02:45:07,439
bait and
 

9233
02:45:07,439 --> 02:45:09,110
bait and
people get hooked

9234
02:45:09,110 --> 02:45:09,120
people get hooked
 

9235
02:45:09,120 --> 02:45:10,230
people get hooked
but uh

9236
02:45:10,230 --> 02:45:10,240
but uh
 

9237
02:45:10,240 --> 02:45:11,990
but uh
you know the fish don't have heads we

9238
02:45:11,990 --> 02:45:12,000
you know the fish don't have heads we
 

9239
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:13,990
you know the fish don't have heads we
have heads one of the great innovations

9240
02:45:13,990 --> 02:45:14,000
have heads one of the great innovations
 

9241
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,309
have heads one of the great innovations
in the history of

9242
02:45:16,309 --> 02:45:16,319
in the history of
 

9243
02:45:16,319 --> 02:45:18,469
in the history of
humanity going back way priming is the

9244
02:45:18,469 --> 02:45:18,479
humanity going back way priming is the
 

9245
02:45:18,479 --> 02:45:20,630
humanity going back way priming is the
invention of the head the mobile head

9246
02:45:20,630 --> 02:45:20,640
invention of the head the mobile head
 

9247
02:45:20,640 --> 02:45:23,269
invention of the head the mobile head
that turns and sees

9248
02:45:23,269 --> 02:45:23,279
that turns and sees
 

9249
02:45:23,279 --> 02:45:24,469
that turns and sees
you know

9250
02:45:24,469 --> 02:45:24,479
you know
 

9251
02:45:24,479 --> 02:45:25,510
you know
and

9252
02:45:25,510 --> 02:45:25,520
and
 

9253
02:45:25,520 --> 02:45:27,110
and
the fish didn't have that you know they

9254
02:45:27,110 --> 02:45:27,120
the fish didn't have that you know they
 

9255
02:45:27,120 --> 02:45:28,870
the fish didn't have that you know they
didn't have hands

9256
02:45:28,870 --> 02:45:28,880
didn't have hands
 

9257
02:45:28,880 --> 02:45:32,469
didn't have hands
the octopus kept cool stuff yeah um it's

9258
02:45:32,469 --> 02:45:32,479
the octopus kept cool stuff yeah um it's
 

9259
02:45:32,479 --> 02:45:33,990
the octopus kept cool stuff yeah um it's
not all about the head

9260
02:45:33,990 --> 02:45:34,000
not all about the head
 

9261
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:35,429
not all about the head
it's not all about the head well in fact

9262
02:45:35,429 --> 02:45:35,439
it's not all about the head well in fact
 

9263
02:45:35,439 --> 02:45:37,110
it's not all about the head well in fact
the octopus basically they've got brains

9264
02:45:37,110 --> 02:45:37,120
the octopus basically they've got brains
 

9265
02:45:37,120 --> 02:45:38,630
the octopus basically they've got brains
in their fingers

9266
02:45:38,630 --> 02:45:38,640
in their fingers
 

9267
02:45:38,640 --> 02:45:40,550
in their fingers
and maybe brains is not even that good

9268
02:45:40,550 --> 02:45:40,560
and maybe brains is not even that good
 

9269
02:45:40,560 --> 02:45:42,150
and maybe brains is not even that good
of an invention and the long arc of

9270
02:45:42,150 --> 02:45:42,160
of an invention and the long arc of
 

9271
02:45:42,160 --> 02:45:43,269
of an invention and the long arc of
history

9272
02:45:43,269 --> 02:45:43,279
history
 

9273
02:45:43,279 --> 02:45:45,190
history
because the fish maybe got it right

9274
02:45:45,190 --> 02:45:45,200
because the fish maybe got it right
 

9275
02:45:45,200 --> 02:45:47,349
because the fish maybe got it right
[Laughter]

9276
02:45:47,349 --> 02:45:47,359
[Laughter]
 

9277
02:45:47,359 --> 02:45:48,950
[Laughter]
stay in the ocean well of course we

9278
02:45:48,950 --> 02:45:48,960
stay in the ocean well of course we
 

9279
02:45:48,960 --> 02:45:51,190
stay in the ocean well of course we
evolved from fish so

9280
02:45:51,190 --> 02:45:51,200
evolved from fish so
 

9281
02:45:51,200 --> 02:45:52,150
evolved from fish so
yeah

9282
02:45:52,150 --> 02:45:52,160
yeah
 

9283
02:45:52,160 --> 02:45:54,230
yeah
but uh we moved on

9284
02:45:54,230 --> 02:45:54,240
but uh we moved on
 

9285
02:45:54,240 --> 02:45:56,469
but uh we moved on
is there a why to this

9286
02:45:56,469 --> 02:45:56,479
is there a why to this
 

9287
02:45:56,479 --> 02:45:58,150
is there a why to this
uh or

9288
02:45:58,150 --> 02:45:58,160
uh or
 

9289
02:45:58,160 --> 02:46:00,550
uh or
is it just the way

9290
02:46:00,550 --> 02:46:00,560
is it just the way
 

9291
02:46:00,560 --> 02:46:03,510
is it just the way
it's it's like the current it's just

9292
02:46:03,510 --> 02:46:03,520
it's it's like the current it's just
 

9293
02:46:03,520 --> 02:46:05,190
it's it's like the current it's just
it's just like these pockets of

9294
02:46:05,190 --> 02:46:05,200
it's just like these pockets of
 

9295
02:46:05,200 --> 02:46:07,990
it's just like these pockets of
interesting complexity pops up like

9296
02:46:07,990 --> 02:46:08,000
interesting complexity pops up like
 

9297
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,630
interesting complexity pops up like
like allah showing up on a rock this is

9298
02:46:10,630 --> 02:46:10,640
like allah showing up on a rock this is
 

9299
02:46:10,640 --> 02:46:12,389
like allah showing up on a rock this is
what human civilization is this weird

9300
02:46:12,389 --> 02:46:12,399
what human civilization is this weird
 

9301
02:46:12,399 --> 02:46:13,910
what human civilization is this weird
little thing that showed up on a rock

9302
02:46:13,910 --> 02:46:13,920
little thing that showed up on a rock
 

9303
02:46:13,920 --> 02:46:15,910
little thing that showed up on a rock
and then it'll disappear well we are

9304
02:46:15,910 --> 02:46:15,920
and then it'll disappear well we are
 

9305
02:46:15,920 --> 02:46:17,830
and then it'll disappear well we are
probably the most remarkable creation

9306
02:46:17,830 --> 02:46:17,840
probably the most remarkable creation
 

9307
02:46:17,840 --> 02:46:18,950
probably the most remarkable creation
that

9308
02:46:18,950 --> 02:46:18,960
that
 

9309
02:46:18,960 --> 02:46:20,870
that
nature has ever

9310
02:46:20,870 --> 02:46:20,880
nature has ever
 

9311
02:46:20,880 --> 02:46:23,190
nature has ever
belched forward we're probably the only

9312
02:46:23,190 --> 02:46:23,200
belched forward we're probably the only
 

9313
02:46:23,200 --> 02:46:25,510
belched forward we're probably the only
one if you don't count the

9314
02:46:25,510 --> 02:46:25,520
one if you don't count the
 

9315
02:46:25,520 --> 02:46:28,309
one if you don't count the
kt meteorite that just almost destroyed

9316
02:46:28,309 --> 02:46:28,319
kt meteorite that just almost destroyed
 

9317
02:46:28,319 --> 02:46:29,830
kt meteorite that just almost destroyed
the earth we're the only ones that can

9318
02:46:29,830 --> 02:46:29,840
the earth we're the only ones that can
 

9319
02:46:29,840 --> 02:46:31,670
the earth we're the only ones that can
really have the capacity to destroy the

9320
02:46:31,670 --> 02:46:31,680
really have the capacity to destroy the
 

9321
02:46:31,680 --> 02:46:34,070
really have the capacity to destroy the
earth

9322
02:46:34,070 --> 02:46:34,080

 

9323
02:46:34,080 --> 02:46:36,630

i'm fascinated by the meteorite that

9324
02:46:36,630 --> 02:46:36,640
i'm fascinated by the meteorite that
 

9325
02:46:36,640 --> 02:46:38,710
i'm fascinated by the meteorite that
wiped out everything bigger than four

9326
02:46:38,710 --> 02:46:38,720
wiped out everything bigger than four
 

9327
02:46:38,720 --> 02:46:41,110
wiped out everything bigger than four
feet long you know the

9328
02:46:41,110 --> 02:46:41,120
feet long you know the
 

9329
02:46:41,120 --> 02:46:42,870
feet long you know the
the mount everest size meteorite that

9330
02:46:42,870 --> 02:46:42,880
the mount everest size meteorite that
 

9331
02:46:42,880 --> 02:46:45,670
the mount everest size meteorite that
hit the earth 66 million years ago

9332
02:46:45,670 --> 02:46:45,680
hit the earth 66 million years ago
 

9333
02:46:45,680 --> 02:46:48,790
hit the earth 66 million years ago
and destroyed most species in in the

9334
02:46:48,790 --> 02:46:48,800
and destroyed most species in in the
 

9335
02:46:48,800 --> 02:46:51,030
and destroyed most species in in the
water and on land

9336
02:46:51,030 --> 02:46:51,040
water and on land
 

9337
02:46:51,040 --> 02:46:52,870
water and on land
there could have been some smart folks

9338
02:46:52,870 --> 02:46:52,880
there could have been some smart folks
 

9339
02:46:52,880 --> 02:46:54,469
there could have been some smart folks
around then too well actually one thing

9340
02:46:54,469 --> 02:46:54,479
around then too well actually one thing
 

9341
02:46:54,479 --> 02:46:58,429
around then too well actually one thing
i like to think about is that

9342
02:46:58,429 --> 02:46:58,439

 

9343
02:46:58,439 --> 02:47:01,510

232.3 million years ago

9344
02:47:01,510 --> 02:47:01,520
232.3 million years ago
 

9345
02:47:01,520 --> 02:47:03,190
232.3 million years ago
and 230

9346
02:47:03,190 --> 02:47:03,200
and 230
 

9347
02:47:03,200 --> 02:47:05,190
and 230
2.4 million years ago that's a hundred

9348
02:47:05,190 --> 02:47:05,200
2.4 million years ago that's a hundred
 

9349
02:47:05,200 --> 02:47:07,670
2.4 million years ago that's a hundred
thousand years that tiniest of a sliver

9350
02:47:07,670 --> 02:47:07,680
thousand years that tiniest of a sliver
 

9351
02:47:07,680 --> 02:47:09,590
thousand years that tiniest of a sliver
maybe a millimeter in most parts of the

9352
02:47:09,590 --> 02:47:09,600
maybe a millimeter in most parts of the
 

9353
02:47:09,600 --> 02:47:10,870
maybe a millimeter in most parts of the
earth

9354
02:47:10,870 --> 02:47:10,880
earth
 

9355
02:47:10,880 --> 02:47:12,550
earth
it's enough time for a species of

9356
02:47:12,550 --> 02:47:12,560
it's enough time for a species of
 

9357
02:47:12,560 --> 02:47:15,429
it's enough time for a species of
dinosaur to become intelligent

9358
02:47:15,429 --> 02:47:15,439
dinosaur to become intelligent
 

9359
02:47:15,439 --> 02:47:17,590
dinosaur to become intelligent
build a civilization and go extinct with

9360
02:47:17,590 --> 02:47:17,600
build a civilization and go extinct with
 

9361
02:47:17,600 --> 02:47:19,990
build a civilization and go extinct with
no traces

9362
02:47:19,990 --> 02:47:20,000
no traces
 

9363
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,950
no traces
and uh maybe that happened

9364
02:47:22,950 --> 02:47:22,960
and uh maybe that happened
 

9365
02:47:22,960 --> 02:47:24,630
and uh maybe that happened
our ignorance

9366
02:47:24,630 --> 02:47:24,640
our ignorance
 

9367
02:47:24,640 --> 02:47:26,630
our ignorance
can fully engulf the fact that that

9368
02:47:26,630 --> 02:47:26,640
can fully engulf the fact that that
 

9369
02:47:26,640 --> 02:47:30,389
can fully engulf the fact that that
happened

9370
02:47:30,389 --> 02:47:30,399

 

9371
02:47:30,399 --> 02:47:32,950

oh there's the beautiful self-importance

9372
02:47:32,950 --> 02:47:32,960
oh there's the beautiful self-importance
 

9373
02:47:32,960 --> 02:47:34,870
oh there's the beautiful self-importance
of us of us humans

9374
02:47:34,870 --> 02:47:34,880
of us of us humans
 

9375
02:47:34,880 --> 02:47:36,790
of us of us humans
it's easy to forget

9376
02:47:36,790 --> 02:47:36,800
it's easy to forget
 

9377
02:47:36,800 --> 02:47:39,190
it's easy to forget
that multiple intelligent civilizations

9378
02:47:39,190 --> 02:47:39,200
that multiple intelligent civilizations
 

9379
02:47:39,200 --> 02:47:41,030
that multiple intelligent civilizations
could have lived on earth

9380
02:47:41,030 --> 02:47:41,040
could have lived on earth
 

9381
02:47:41,040 --> 02:47:44,070
could have lived on earth
it's possible and gone extinct or even

9382
02:47:44,070 --> 02:47:44,080
it's possible and gone extinct or even
 

9383
02:47:44,080 --> 02:47:46,630
it's possible and gone extinct or even
life may have evolved more than once

9384
02:47:46,630 --> 02:47:46,640
life may have evolved more than once
 

9385
02:47:46,640 --> 02:47:48,790
life may have evolved more than once
not only that but it proto-life may

9386
02:47:48,790 --> 02:47:48,800
not only that but it proto-life may
 

9387
02:47:48,800 --> 02:47:50,150
not only that but it proto-life may
still exist and we were not even looking

9388
02:47:50,150 --> 02:47:50,160
still exist and we were not even looking
 

9389
02:47:50,160 --> 02:47:52,870
still exist and we were not even looking
for it you know some type of clay

9390
02:47:52,870 --> 02:47:52,880
for it you know some type of clay
 

9391
02:47:52,880 --> 02:47:53,670
for it you know some type of clay
that

9392
02:47:53,670 --> 02:47:53,680
that
 

9393
02:47:53,680 --> 02:47:56,870
that
became life may still exist and people

9394
02:47:56,870 --> 02:47:56,880
became life may still exist and people
 

9395
02:47:56,880 --> 02:47:58,389
became life may still exist and people
one thing i like to think about is is

9396
02:47:58,389 --> 02:47:58,399
one thing i like to think about is is
 

9397
02:47:58,399 --> 02:48:00,550
one thing i like to think about is is
always what is the before time that is

9398
02:48:00,550 --> 02:48:00,560
always what is the before time that is
 

9399
02:48:00,560 --> 02:48:01,670
always what is the before time that is
now

9400
02:48:01,670 --> 02:48:01,680
now
 

9401
02:48:01,680 --> 02:48:03,429
now
i remember lecturing about this right

9402
02:48:03,429 --> 02:48:03,439
i remember lecturing about this right
 

9403
02:48:03,439 --> 02:48:05,269
i remember lecturing about this right
before kovat and it's sort of like what

9404
02:48:05,269 --> 02:48:05,279
before kovat and it's sort of like what
 

9405
02:48:05,279 --> 02:48:07,349
before kovat and it's sort of like what
is the what is the our world now that

9406
02:48:07,349 --> 02:48:07,359
is the what is the our world now that
 

9407
02:48:07,359 --> 02:48:09,110
is the what is the our world now that
we'll say what was it like to be then

9408
02:48:09,110 --> 02:48:09,120
we'll say what was it like to be then
 

9409
02:48:09,120 --> 02:48:11,429
we'll say what was it like to be then
before yeah before and that's the world

9410
02:48:11,429 --> 02:48:11,439
before yeah before and that's the world
 

9411
02:48:11,439 --> 02:48:13,349
before yeah before and that's the world
we live in we live in a before time for

9412
02:48:13,349 --> 02:48:13,359
we live in we live in a before time for
 

9413
02:48:13,359 --> 02:48:15,190
we live in we live in a before time for
something we really can't predict

9414
02:48:15,190 --> 02:48:15,200
something we really can't predict
 

9415
02:48:15,200 --> 02:48:17,990
something we really can't predict
probably physical

9416
02:48:17,990 --> 02:48:18,000
probably physical
 

9417
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:19,030
probably physical
uh

9418
02:48:19,030 --> 02:48:19,040
uh
 

9419
02:48:19,040 --> 02:48:21,030
uh
you know appendages and you know and

9420
02:48:21,030 --> 02:48:21,040
you know appendages and you know and
 

9421
02:48:21,040 --> 02:48:23,510
you know appendages and you know and
being in person being able to touch each

9422
02:48:23,510 --> 02:48:23,520
being in person being able to touch each
 

9423
02:48:23,520 --> 02:48:26,230
being in person being able to touch each
other or wanting to touch each other

9424
02:48:26,230 --> 02:48:26,240
other or wanting to touch each other
 

9425
02:48:26,240 --> 02:48:28,870
other or wanting to touch each other
versus being in the digital world

9426
02:48:28,870 --> 02:48:28,880
versus being in the digital world
 

9427
02:48:28,880 --> 02:48:30,630
versus being in the digital world
right this whole idea of the metaverse

9428
02:48:30,630 --> 02:48:30,640
right this whole idea of the metaverse
 

9429
02:48:30,640 --> 02:48:32,550
right this whole idea of the metaverse
and more and more moving into a digital

9430
02:48:32,550 --> 02:48:32,560
and more and more moving into a digital
 

9431
02:48:32,560 --> 02:48:33,910
and more and more moving into a digital
space

9432
02:48:33,910 --> 02:48:33,920
space
 

9433
