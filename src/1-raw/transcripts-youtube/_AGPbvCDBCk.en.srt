00:07:36,309 --> 00:07:36,319
again we're talking about you know
 

425
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,510
again we're talking about you know
subjective kind of way of feeling

426
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:39,520
subjective kind of way of feeling
 

427
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,870
subjective kind of way of feeling
alone it doesn't necessarily mean that

428
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:40,880

429
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,110

actually isolated
you think it's a subjective

434
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:47,039
you think it's a subjective
 

435
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,869

thing but like
 

437
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,350
thing but like
again another absurd measurement-wise

438
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,360
again another absurd measurement-wise
 

439
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,350
again another absurd measurement-wise
thing how much loneliness do you think

there is in the world
so like

444
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,000

as a condition
how much of it is there

450
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,240
how much of it is there
 

451
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,790
how much of it is there
do you think like how i guess how many

452
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:06,800
do you think like how i guess how many
 

453
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,150

you know there's all kinds of studies
 

455
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,670
you know there's all kinds of studies
and measures of

456
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:09,680
and measures of
 

457
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,749
and measures of
how much you know how many people in the

you know self-report or just all these
 

465
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,550
you know self-report or just all these
kinds of different measures but in your

466
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:20,560
kinds of different measures but in your
 

467
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,629
kinds of different measures but in your
own perspective

468
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:22,639
own perspective
 

469
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,749
own perspective
um

470
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:23,759
um
 

471
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,230
um
how big of a problem do you think it is

472
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:26,240
how big of a problem do you think it is
 

473
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,430
how big of a problem do you think it is
size-wise

474
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:27,440
size-wise
 

475
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,869
size-wise
well i'm actually fascinated by the

476
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:28,879
well i'm actually fascinated by the
 

477
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,189
well i'm actually fascinated by the
topic of loneliness i try to read about

478
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:31,199
topic of loneliness i try to read about
 

479
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,589
topic of loneliness i try to read about
it as much as i can

480
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:33,599
it as much as i can
 

481
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,389
it as much as i can
um

482
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:34,399
um
 

483
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,750
um
what really

484
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:35,760
what really
 

485
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,269
what really
and there i think there's a paradox

486
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:37,279
and there i think there's a paradox
 

487
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,110
and there i think there's a paradox
because loneliness is not a clinical

488
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,120
because loneliness is not a clinical
 

489
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,110
because loneliness is not a clinical
disorder it's not something that you can

490
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,120
disorder it's not something that you can

struggling with that yet it's it's
 

495
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,350
struggling with that yet it's it's
actually proven and pretty

496
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:47,360
actually proven and pretty
 

497
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,430
actually proven and pretty
you know tons of papers tons of research

498
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:49,440
you know tons of papers tons of research
 

499
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,829
you know tons of papers tons of research
around that it has proven um

500
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839
around that it has proven um
 

501
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,030
around that it has proven um
that it's correlated with earlier um

502
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,040
that it's correlated with earlier um
 

503
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,829
that it's correlated with earlier um
life expectancy shorter life span

504
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:57,839
life expectancy shorter life span
 

505
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,829
life expectancy shorter life span
and it is you know in a way like right

506
00:08:59,829 --> 00:08:59,839
and it is you know in a way like right
 

507
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,750
and it is you know in a way like right
now what scientists would say that it

508
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:01,760
now what scientists would say that it
 

509
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,509
now what scientists would say that it
you know it's a little bit worse than

510
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:03,519
you know it's a little bit worse than
 

511
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,070
you know it's a little bit worse than
being obese so not actually doing any

512
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:06,080
being obese so not actually doing any
 

513
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,990
being obese so not actually doing any
physical activity in your life the

feeling lonely
 

523
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,790
feeling lonely
um your body responds like it's

524
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:16,800
um your body responds like it's
 

525
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,110
um your body responds like it's
basically all the time under stress so

526
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,120
basically all the time under stress so
 

527
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,350
basically all the time under stress so
it's always in this alert

528
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:21,360
it's always in this alert
 

529
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,030
it's always in this alert
um alerts say

530
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,040
um alerts say
 

531
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,230
um alerts say
and so it's really bad for you because

532
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,240
and so it's really bad for you because
 

533
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,350
and so it's really bad for you because
it actually like drops your immune

534
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:25,360
it actually like drops your immune
 

535
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,670
it actually like drops your immune
system and get it your response to

536
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:27,680
system and get it your response to
 

537
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,870
system and get it your response to
inflammation

538
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:28,880
inflammation
 

539
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,550
inflammation
is quite different so

540
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:30,560
is quite different so
 

541
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,949
is quite different so
all the cardiovascular vascular diseases

542
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:32,959
all the cardiovascular vascular diseases
 

543
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,030
all the cardiovascular vascular diseases
actually responds to viruses so it's

544
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,040
actually responds to viruses so it's
 

545
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,870
actually responds to viruses so it's
much easier to catch a virus

546
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:36,880
much easier to catch a virus
 

547
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,949
much easier to catch a virus
that's sad now that we're living in a

548
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:38,959
that's sad now that we're living in a
 

549
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,070
that's sad now that we're living in a
pandemic

550
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,080
pandemic
 

551
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,910
pandemic
and it's probably making us a lot more

552
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:41,920
and it's probably making us a lot more
 

553
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,070
and it's probably making us a lot more
alone and it's probably weakening the

554
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,080
alone and it's probably weakening the
 

555
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,910
alone and it's probably weakening the
immune system making us more susceptible

556
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:45,920
immune system making us more susceptible
 

557
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,509
immune system making us more susceptible
to the virus

558
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:47,519
to the virus
 

559
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,670
to the virus
it's kind of

560
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:49,680
it's kind of
 

561
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,870
it's kind of
sad

562
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:50,880
sad
 

563
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,110
sad
yeah the statistics are the sticks are

564
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,120
yeah the statistics are the sticks are
 

565
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,710
yeah the statistics are the sticks are
pretty pretty horrible around that so

566
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:54,720
pretty pretty horrible around that so
 

567
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,310
pretty pretty horrible around that so
around thirty percent

568
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:56,320
around thirty percent
 

569
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,990
around thirty percent
of all millennials report that they're

570
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,000
of all millennials report that they're
 

571
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,150
of all millennials report that they're
feeling lonely constantly thirty thirty

572
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,160
feeling lonely constantly thirty thirty
 

573
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,069
feeling lonely constantly thirty thirty
percent and then it's much worse for jan

574
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:02,079
percent and then it's much worse for jan
 

575
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,670
percent and then it's much worse for jan
z and then twenty percent of millennials

576
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:03,680
z and then twenty percent of millennials
 

577
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,350
z and then twenty percent of millennials
say that they feel lonely

578
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:05,360
say that they feel lonely
 

579
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,030
say that they feel lonely
and they also don't have any close

580
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,040
and they also don't have any close
 

581
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,750
and they also don't have any close
friends and then um i think 25 or so and

582
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:09,760
friends and then um i think 25 or so and
 

583
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,870
friends and then um i think 25 or so and
then 20 percent would say they don't

584
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:10,880
then 20 percent would say they don't
 

585
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,550
then 20 percent would say they don't
even have acquaintances

586
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:12,560
even have acquaintances
 

587
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,150
even have acquaintances

feeling lonely that is not objectively
fully so being fully socially isolated

624
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:50,959
fully so being fully socially isolated
 

625
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,030
fully so being fully socially isolated
however the combination of being fully

626
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,040
however the combination of being fully
 

627
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,030
however the combination of being fully
socially isolated and not having many

628
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,040
socially isolated and not having many
 

629
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,150

much a deadly
combination

636
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:00,560
combination
 

637
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,069
combination
so it strikes me bizarre or strange that

638
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:04,079
so it strikes me bizarre or strange that
 

639
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,550
so it strikes me bizarre or strange that
this is a wide known fact and then

640
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:06,560
this is a wide known fact and then
 

641
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,230
this is a wide known fact and then
there's really

642
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,240
there's really
 

643
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,269
there's really
no one

644
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:09,279
no one
 

645
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,110
no one
working really on that because it's a

646
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:11,120
working really on that because it's a
 

647
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,110
working really on that because it's a
subclinical it's not clinical it's not

648
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,120
subclinical it's not clinical it's not
 

649
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,870
subclinical it's not clinical it's not
something that you can we'll tell your

650
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:14,880
something that you can we'll tell your
 

651
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,190
something that you can we'll tell your
doctor and get a treatment or something

652
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,200
doctor and get a treatment or something
 

653
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,190
doctor and get a treatment or something
yet it's killing us

yet it's killing us
yeah so there's a bunch of people

656
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,360
yeah so there's a bunch of people
 

657
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,269
yeah so there's a bunch of people
trying to evaluate like try to measure

658
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:23,279
trying to evaluate like try to measure
 

659
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,430
trying to evaluate like try to measure
the problem by looking at like how

660
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:25,440
the problem by looking at like how

665
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,710
all that kind of stuff so it's like
measurement like if you look at the

666
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:30,720
measurement like if you look at the
 

667
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,230
measurement like if you look at the
field of psychology they're trying to

668
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:32,240
field of psychology they're trying to
 

669
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,230
field of psychology they're trying to
measure the problem and not that many

670
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,240
measure the problem and not that many
 

671
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,630
measure the problem and not that many
people actually but some

672

but you're basically saying
 

675
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,110
but you're basically saying
how many people are trying to solve the

676
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,120
how many people are trying to solve the
 

677
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,110
how many people are trying to solve the
problem

678
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,120
problem
 

679
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,790
problem
like how would you try to solve

680
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:46,800

technology that connects us humans do
 

691
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,110
technology that connects us humans do
you think there's a hope for that

692
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,120
you think there's a hope for that
 

693
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,550
you think there's a hope for that
technology

694
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:00,560
technology
 

695
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,949
technology
to do the connection

696
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:02,959

than millennials in terms of however
they report loneliness they're

um so that tells me a little bit about
 

743
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,870
um so that tells me a little bit about
the fact that that might be um

744
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:52,880
the fact that that might be um
 

745
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,030
the fact that that might be um
you know this hyperconnected world is

746

i don't know exactly what the what the
measurements are around that but i would

754

measurements are around that but i would
 

755
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,990
measurements are around that but i would
say in my personal experience i think it

756

whatsoever again tons of people that are
 

769
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,590
whatsoever again tons of people that are
in

loneliness
 

777
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,550
loneliness
and it's more the question about the

778
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:24,560
and it's more the question about the
 

779
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,190
and it's more the question about the
true connection about actually

780
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:27,200
true connection about actually
 

781
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,509
true connection about actually
being deeply seen deeply understood

782
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:31,519
being deeply seen deeply understood
 

783
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,710
being deeply seen deeply understood
and in a way it's also about your

784
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:32,720
and in a way it's also about your
 

785
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,550
and in a way it's also about your
relationship with yourself like in order

786
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:34,560
relationship with yourself like in order
 

787
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,550
relationship with yourself like in order
to not feel lonely you actually need to

788
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:38,560
to not feel lonely you actually need to
 

789
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,230
to not feel lonely you actually need to
have a better relationship and feel more

790
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:40,240
have a better relationship and feel more
 

791
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,470
have a better relationship and feel more
connected to yourself then this feeling

792
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:42,480
connected to yourself then this feeling
 

793
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,389
connected to yourself then this feeling
actually starts to go away a little bit

794
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:44,399
actually starts to go away a little bit
 

795
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,590
actually starts to go away a little bit
and then you

796
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:45,600
and then you
 

797
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,430
and then you
um open up

798
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:47,440

of way
so just to briefly touch on it i mean do

808
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:58,079
so just to briefly touch on it i mean do
 

809
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,670
so just to briefly touch on it i mean do
you think it's possible to form that

810
00:13:59,670 --> 00:13:59,680
you think it's possible to form that
 

811
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,230
you think it's possible to form that
kind of connection with ai systems

812
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,240
kind of connection with ai systems
 

813
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,949
kind of connection with ai systems
more

814

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,269
do you think that's um
engineering-wise a possibility to

why we're i'm also working on that
 

889
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,829
why we're i'm also working on that
um

we're actually measuring
and it is a north star metric that we're

898
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:39,360
and it is a north star metric that we're
 

899

00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:44,959
optimized for that because you can talk
 

905
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,310
optimized for that because you can talk
you know a lot of products that talk

906
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:46,320
you know a lot of products that talk
 

907
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,110
you know a lot of products that talk
about

908
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:47,120
about

they're not really measuring that so
 

915
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,910
they're not really measuring that so
they don't really know whether their

916
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:53,920
they don't really know whether their
 

917
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,509
they don't really know whether their
users are actually

put your measure yep to measure it
what's uh what's a good measurement of

928
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,160
what's uh what's a good measurement of
 

929
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,670
what's uh what's a good measurement of
loneliness

930
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:07,680
loneliness
 

931
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,829
loneliness
well so that's something that i'm really

932
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:09,839
well so that's something that i'm really
 

933
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,829
well so that's something that i'm really
interested in how do you measure that

934
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:11,839
interested in how do you measure that
 

935
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,350
interested in how do you measure that
people are feeling better

936

941
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,749
lowliness there's a scale there's a ucla
20 and ucla 3 recently scale which is

942
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:19,759
20 and ucla 3 recently scale which is
 

943
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,350
20 and ucla 3 recently scale which is
basically a questionnaire that you fill

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,110
out and you can see whether in the long
run

948
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,120
run
 

949
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,509
run
it's improving or not and that uh does

950
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:27,519
it's improving or not and that uh does
 

951
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,790
it's improving or not and that uh does
it capture the momentary

it's similar to the self-report
 

983
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,430
it's similar to the self-report
questionnaires for depression and

984
00:16:59,430 --> 00:16:59,440
questionnaires for depression and
 

985
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,470
questionnaires for depression and
anxiety like phq9 and get seven

986
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:02,480
anxiety like phq9 and get seven
 

987
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,110
anxiety like phq9 and get seven
of course any as any self-report

988
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:05,120
of course any as any self-report
 

989
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,510
of course any as any self-report
questionnaires that's not necessarily

990
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:07,520
questionnaires that's not necessarily
 

991
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,429
questionnaires that's not necessarily
very precise so very

992
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:09,439
very precise so very
 

993
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,829
very precise so very
well measured but still if you take a

994
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:11,839
well measured but still if you take a
 

995
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,750
well measured but still if you take a
big enough population you

996
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:13,760
big enough population you
 

997
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,350
big enough population you
get them through these

998
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:15,360
get them through these
 

999
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,429
get them through these
uh questionnaires you can see you can

1000
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:17,439
uh questionnaires you can see you can
 

1001
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,829
uh questionnaires you can see you can
see the positive dynamic and so you

1002
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:19,839
see the positive dynamic and so you
 

1003
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,990
see the positive dynamic and so you
basically uh you put people through

1004
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,000
basically uh you put people through
 

1005

00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:09,679
a separate person at the same time
 

1165
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,510
a separate person at the same time
and this deep empathetic understanding

1166
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:11,520
and this deep empathetic understanding
 

1167
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,350
and this deep empathetic understanding
for me that's the

1168
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,360
for me that's the
 

1169
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,029
for me that's the
that's the

1170
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:15,039
that's the
 

1171
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,950
that's the
combination that really

1172
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:16,960
combination that really
 

1173
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,710
combination that really
creates something special something that

1174
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:18,720
creates something special something that
 

1175
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,190
creates something special something that
people when they feel it once

1176
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:21,200
people when they feel it once
 

1177
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,430
people when they feel it once
they will always long for it again and

1178
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:23,440
they will always long for it again and
 

1179
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,909
they will always long for it again and
something that starts

1180
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:25,919
something that starts
 

1181
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,789
something that starts
huge fundamental changes in people um

1182
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:28,799
huge fundamental changes in people um
 

1183
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,789
huge fundamental changes in people um
when we see that someone's

1184
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:30,799
when we see that someone's
 

1185
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,750
when we see that someone's
accepts us so deeply we start to accept

1186
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:33,760
accepts us so deeply we start to accept
 

1187
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,430
accepts us so deeply we start to accept
ourselves and

1188
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:35,440
ourselves and
 

1189
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,390
ourselves and
the paradoxes that's when

1190
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:38,400
the paradoxes that's when
 

1191
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,990
the paradoxes that's when
big changes start start happening big

1192
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:40,000
big changes start start happening big
 

1193
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,669
big changes start start happening big
fundamental changes and people start

1194
00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:41,679
fundamental changes and people start
 

1195
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,270
fundamental changes and people start
happening so i think that is the

1196
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:43,280
happening so i think that is the
 

1197
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,950
happening so i think that is the
ultimate therapeutic relationship that

1198
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:44,960
ultimate therapeutic relationship that
 

1199
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,789
ultimate therapeutic relationship that
is and that might be

1200
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:46,799
is and that might be
 

1201
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,510
is and that might be
in some way definition of love

1202
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:49,520
in some way definition of love
 

1203
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,270
in some way definition of love
so so

1204
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:51,280
so so
 

1205
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,110
so so
acknowledging that there's a separate

1206
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:53,120
acknowledging that there's a separate
 

1207
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,350
acknowledging that there's a separate
person and accepting you for who you are

1208
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:57,360
person and accepting you for who you are
 

1209
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,789
person and accepting you for who you are
now

1210
00:20:58,789 --> 00:20:58,799
now
 

1211
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,230
now
on a slightly

1212
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:00,240
on a slightly
 

1213
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,310
on a slightly
so that and you mentioned therapeutic

1214
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:02,320
so that and you mentioned therapeutic
 

1215
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,990
so that and you mentioned therapeutic
that sounds very like a very healthy

1216
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:04,000
that sounds very like a very healthy
 

1217
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,950
that sounds very like a very healthy
view of love but uh is there also like

uh
like

1222
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:11,200

 

1223
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,669

you know if we look at heartbreak and uh

negative light as like games or whatever
but just

1240
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:31,760
but just
 

1241

so like the drawbacks of capitalism is

2508
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:44,160
so like the drawbacks of capitalism is
 

2509
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,910
so like the drawbacks of capitalism is
that uh

2510
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:45,920
that uh
 

2511
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,390
that uh
you know eventually there is it's a it's

2512
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:48,400
you know eventually there is it's a it's
 

2513
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,550
you know eventually there is it's a it's
the point of like a slippery slope

2514
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:50,560
the point of like a slippery slope
 

2515
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,470
the point of like a slippery slope
eventually it creates uh

2516
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:54,480
eventually it creates uh
 

2517
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,550
eventually it creates uh
you know the rich get richer

2518
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:56,560
you know the rich get richer
 

2519
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,270
you know the rich get richer
it creates a disparity like inequality

2520
00:42:59,270 --> 00:42:59,280
it creates a disparity like inequality
 

2521
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,790
it creates a disparity like inequality
of um

2522
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:00,800
of um
 

2523
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,309
of um
wealth inequality

2524
00:43:02,309 --> 00:43:02,319
wealth inequality
 

2525
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:04,470
wealth inequality
if like you know

2526
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:04,480
if like you know
 

2527
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,309
if like you know
i guess it's hypothetical at this point

2528
00:43:06,309 --> 00:43:06,319
i guess it's hypothetical at this point
 

2529
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:07,589
i guess it's hypothetical at this point
but

2530
00:43:07,589 --> 00:43:07,599
but
 

2531
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:09,990
but
eventually capitalism leads to humongous

2532
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:10,000
eventually capitalism leads to humongous
 

2533
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,589
eventually capitalism leads to humongous
inequality and that that's you know some

2534
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:11,599
inequality and that that's you know some
 

2535
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,829
inequality and that that's you know some
people argue that that's a source of

2536
00:43:13,829 --> 00:43:13,839
people argue that that's a source of
 

2537
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:15,190
people argue that that's a source of
unhappiness

2538
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:15,200
unhappiness
 

2539
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,109
unhappiness
is it's not like absolute wealth of

2540
00:43:17,109 --> 00:43:17,119
is it's not like absolute wealth of
 

2541
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,270
is it's not like absolute wealth of
people it's the fact that there's a lot

2542
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:19,280
people it's the fact that there's a lot
 

2543
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,349
people it's the fact that there's a lot
of people much richer than you there's a

2544
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:21,359
of people much richer than you there's a
 

2545
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,349
of people much richer than you there's a
feeling of like

2546
00:43:23,349 --> 00:43:23,359
feeling of like
 

2547
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,109
feeling of like
that's where unhappiness can come from

2548
00:43:25,109 --> 00:43:25,119
that's where unhappiness can come from
 

2549
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,829
that's where unhappiness can come from
so the idea of of communism or this sort

2550
00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:27,839
so the idea of of communism or this sort
 

2551
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,950
so the idea of of communism or this sort
of marxism is uh

2552
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:30,960
of marxism is uh
 

2553
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,750
of marxism is uh
is is not allowing that kind of slippery

2554
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:33,760
is is not allowing that kind of slippery
 

2555
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,790
is is not allowing that kind of slippery
slope

2556
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:34,800
slope
 

2557
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,069
slope
but then you see the actual

2558
00:43:36,069 --> 00:43:36,079
but then you see the actual
 

2559
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:37,910
but then you see the actual
implementations of it and still seems to

2560
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:37,920
implementations of it and still seems to
 

2561
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,870
implementations of it and still seems to
be

2562
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:38,880
be
 

2563
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,150
be
seems to go wrong very badly

2564
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:42,160
seems to go wrong very badly
 

2565
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,670
seems to go wrong very badly

00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,069
why does it go wrong
what is it about human nature if we look

2570
00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:48,079
what is it about human nature if we look
 

2571
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:50,230
what is it about human nature if we look
at chernobyl

2572
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:50,240
at chernobyl
 

2573
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,670
at chernobyl
you know those kinds of barack

2574
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:51,680
you know those kinds of barack
 

2575
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,550
you know those kinds of barack
bureaucracies that were constructed

2576
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:54,560
bureaucracies that were constructed
 

2577
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,309
bureaucracies that were constructed
is there something like do you think

2578
00:43:56,309 --> 00:43:56,319
is there something like do you think
 

2579
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,470
is there something like do you think
about this much

2580
00:43:58,470 --> 00:43:58,480
about this much
 

2581
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,030
about this much
of like why it goes wrong

2582
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:01,040
of like why it goes wrong
 

2583
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,430
of like why it goes wrong
well there's no one was really like

2584
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:03,440
well there's no one was really like
 

2585
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,270
well there's no one was really like
it's not that everyone was equal

2586
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:05,280
it's not that everyone was equal
 

2587
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,349
it's not that everyone was equal
obviously the you know the

2588
00:44:07,349 --> 00:44:07,359
obviously the you know the
 

2589
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:08,630
obviously the you know the
the government

2590
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:08,640
the government
 

2591
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,109
the government
and everyone close to that were

2592
00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:11,119
and everyone close to that were
 

2593
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,750
and everyone close to that were
the bosses so it's not like fully

2594
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:13,760
the bosses so it's not like fully
 

2595
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,870
the bosses so it's not like fully
i guess uh there's already this dream of

2596
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:16,880
i guess uh there's already this dream of
 

2597
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,950
i guess uh there's already this dream of
equal life so

2598
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:18,960
equal life so
 

2599
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,790
equal life so
then i guess the

2600
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:20,800
then i guess the
 

2601
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,790
then i guess the
the situation that we hadn't you know

2602
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:22,800
the situation that we hadn't you know
 

2603

uh so
you know a third of a country wakes up

4184
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:02,880
you know a third of a country wakes up
 

4185
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,350
you know a third of a country wakes up
as your bank client

4186
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:05,360
as your bank client
 

4187
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,990
as your bank client
um but we couldn't quite figure out what

4188
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:08,000
um but we couldn't quite figure out what
 

4189
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,990
um but we couldn't quite figure out what
would be the main interface to interact

4190
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:10,000
would be the main interface to interact
 

4191
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,990
would be the main interface to interact
with the bank the problem was that most

4192
01:12:11,990 --> 01:12:12,000
with the bank the problem was that most
 

4193
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,750
with the bank the problem was that most
people didn't have smart smartphones

4194
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:13,760
people didn't have smart smartphones
 

4195
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,430
people didn't have smart smartphones
back in the time uh in russia the

4196
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:15,440
back in the time uh in russia the
 

4197
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,590
back in the time uh in russia the
penetration of smartphones was low

4198
01:12:17,590 --> 01:12:17,600
penetration of smartphones was low
 

4199
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,990
penetration of smartphones was low
um people didn't use mobile banking or

4200
01:12:19,990 --> 01:12:20,000
um people didn't use mobile banking or
 

4201
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,550
um people didn't use mobile banking or
online banking on their computers

4202
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:22,560
online banking on their computers
 

4203
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,630
online banking on their computers
so we figured out that sms would be the

4204
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:24,640
so we figured out that sms would be the
 

4205
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,390
so we figured out that sms would be the
best way uh because that would work on

4206
01:12:26,390 --> 01:12:26,400
best way uh because that would work on
 

4207
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,790
best way uh because that would work on
feature phones uh wow but that required

4208
01:12:28,790 --> 01:12:28,800
feature phones uh wow but that required
 

4209
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,870
feature phones uh wow but that required
some chatbot technology

4210
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:30,880
some chatbot technology
 

4211
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,630
some chatbot technology
which i didn't know anything about um

4212
01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:32,640

4213
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:33,669
which i didn't know anything about um
obviously

4214
01:12:33,669 --> 01:12:33,679
obviously
 

4215
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:35,350
obviously
so i started looking into it and saw

4216
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:35,360
so i started looking into it and saw
 

4217
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,270
so i started looking into it and saw
that there's nothing really well there

4218
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:37,280
that there's nothing really well there
 

4219
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,950
that there's nothing really well there
was just nothing there was ideas through

the machine learning world doesn't feel

the machine learning world doesn't feel
 

4593
01:18:58,239 --> 01:18:59,270
the machine learning world doesn't feel
that

that
 

4595

that
that there's something here

that there's something here
 

4597

that there's something here
because

4598
01:19:01,910 --> 01:19:01,920
because
 

4599
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,830
because
they see as a technical problem it's not

4600
01:19:03,830 --> 01:19:03,840
they see as a technical problem it's not
 

4601

they see as a technical problem it's not
that interesting for some reason

that interesting for some reason
 

4603
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,790
that interesting for some reason
it's could be argued that maybe as an as

01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:12,960
processing problem it's not the right
 

4609
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:15,030
processing problem it's not the right
problem to focus on because there's too

4610
01:19:15,030 --> 01:19:15,040
problem to focus on because there's too
 

4611
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:16,709
problem to focus on because there's too
much subjectivity

4612
01:19:16,709 --> 01:19:16,719
much subjectivity
 

4613
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:19,189

4615
01:19:19,199 --> 01:19:22,149
that that thing that the woman felt like
like if if if your benchmarking cr

4616
01:19:22,149 --> 01:19:22,159
like if if if your benchmarking cr
 

4617
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:24,310
like if if if your benchmarking cr
includes a woman crying

4618

4621
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:28,149
that doesn't feel like a good benchmark
that's a good test but to me there's

4622
01:19:28,149 --> 01:19:28,159
that's a good test but to me there's
 

4623
01:19:28,159 --> 01:19:30,229
that's a good test but to me there's
something there that's you could have a

4624
01:19:30,229 --> 01:19:30,239
something there that's you could have a
 

4625
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:32,070
something there that's you could have a
huge impact but

4626
01:19:32,070 --> 01:19:32,080
huge impact but
 

4627
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:34,229
huge impact but
i don't think

4628
01:19:34,229 --> 01:19:34,239
i don't think
 

4629
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:36,149
i don't think
the machine learning world likes that

4630
01:19:36,149 --> 01:19:36,159
the machine learning world likes that
 

4631
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:38,709
the machine learning world likes that
the human emotion the subjectivity of it

4632

the human emotion the subjectivity of it
 

4633
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:39,990
the human emotion the subjectivity of it
the fuzziness

4634

the fuzziness
 

4635
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,830
the fuzziness
the fact that with maybe a single word

4636
01:19:41,830 --> 01:19:41,840
the fact that with maybe a single word
 

4637
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,430
the fact that with maybe a single word
you can make somebody feel something

4638

you can make somebody feel something
 

4639
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:44,470

things
 

4683
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:28,709

no all right we'll we'll talk about it
 

4697
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:41,990
no all right we'll we'll talk about it
more

more
 

4699
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,310

01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:44,320
i feel like it's harder to talk about
 

4701
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:47,350
i feel like it's harder to talk about
things that have failed

4702
01:20:47,350 --> 01:20:47,360
things that have failed
 

4703
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:52,310
things that have failed
and are failing while you're a failure

4704
01:20:52,310 --> 01:20:52,320

 

4705
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,229

like it's easier for you because you're

4706
01:20:54,229 --> 01:20:54,239
like it's easier for you because you're
 

4707
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:56,149
like it's easier for you because you're
already successful

4708
01:20:56,149 --> 01:20:56,159
already successful
 

4709

what did you mean by that
like

like
 

4765
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,030
like
you should be focused on creating a like

you should have a product in mind
 

4769
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,350
you should have a product in mind
is that what you meant it just took us a

is that what you meant it just took us a
 

4771
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:59,830
is that what you meant it just took us a
while to discover the product

4772
01:21:59,830 --> 01:21:59,840
while to discover the product
 

4773
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:01,430
while to discover the product
because it all started with a hunch of

and there's no one who's working on
 

4791
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:19,270
and there's no one who's working on
machine conversation from the right

4792
01:22:19,270 --> 01:22:19,280
machine conversation from the right
 

4793
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,030
machine conversation from the right
angle so to say

4794
01:22:21,030 --> 01:22:21,040
angle so to say
 

4795
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:23,510
angle so to say

uh because conversation you start
drifting into natural language

01:22:43,270 --> 01:22:43,280
drifting into natural language
 

4821
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:45,189
drifting into natural language
immediately you start drifting

4822
01:22:45,189 --> 01:22:45,199
immediately you start drifting
 

4823
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:46,550
immediately you start drifting
immediately into all the benchmarks that

4824
01:22:46,550 --> 01:22:46,560
immediately into all the benchmarks that
 

4825
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:47,669
immediately into all the benchmarks that
are out there

4826
01:22:47,669 --> 01:22:47,679
are out there
 

4827
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:49,669

4829
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:52,310
but i feel like it's like the personal
computer days of this

4830
01:22:52,310 --> 01:22:52,320
computer days of this
 

4831
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:54,149
computer days of this
like i feel like we're like in the early

4832
01:22:54,149 --> 01:22:54,159
like i feel like we're like in the early

4879
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,430
give me a good conversation
it would have never happened so the

4880
01:23:41,430 --> 01:23:41,440
it would have never happened so the
 

4881
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:44,070
it would have never happened so the
whole um the whole problem with testing

4882
01:23:44,070 --> 01:23:44,080
whole um the whole problem with testing
 

4883
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,750
whole um the whole problem with testing
conversations is that

4884
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:45,760
conversations is that
 

4885
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:48,310
conversations is that
um you can put it in front of a jury

4886
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:48,320
um you can put it in front of a jury
 

4887
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:49,910
um you can put it in front of a jury
because then you have to go into some

4888
01:23:49,910 --> 01:23:49,920
because then you have to go into some
 

4889
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:52,070
because then you have to go into some
turing test mode where

4890
01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:52,080
turing test mode where
 

4891
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:54,470
turing test mode where
is it responding to all my factual

4892
01:23:54,470 --> 01:23:54,480
is it responding to all my factual
 

4893
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:56,550
is it responding to all my factual
questions right or

4894
01:23:56,550 --> 01:23:56,560
questions right or
 

4895
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,709
questions right or
um so it really has to be

4896
01:23:58,709 --> 01:23:58,719
um so it really has to be
 

4897
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:00,070
um so it really has to be
something in the field where people are

4898
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:00,080
something in the field where people are
 

4899
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:02,310
something in the field where people are
actually talking to it because they want

4900
01:24:02,310 --> 01:24:02,320
actually talking to it because they want
 

4901
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:03,830
actually talking to it because they want
to not because we're just trying to

4902
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:03,840
to not because we're just trying to
 

4903
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,030
to not because we're just trying to
break it

4904
01:24:05,030 --> 01:24:05,040
break it
 

4905
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,350
break it
uh and it's working for them

4906
01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:07,360
uh and it's working for them
 

4907
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:08,870
uh and it's working for them
because this the weird part of it is

4908
01:24:08,870 --> 01:24:08,880
because this the weird part of it is
 

4909
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:11,350
because this the weird part of it is
that it's uh it's very subjective it

4910
01:24:11,350 --> 01:24:11,360
that it's uh it's very subjective it
 

4911
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:13,510
that it's uh it's very subjective it
takes two to tango here fully like if

4912
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:13,520
takes two to tango here fully like if
 

4913
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:15,110
takes two to tango here fully like if
you're not trying to have a good

4914
01:24:15,110 --> 01:24:15,120
you're not trying to have a good
 

4915
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:16,390
you're not trying to have a good
conversation we're trying to test it

4916
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:16,400
conversation we're trying to test it
 

4917
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:17,750
conversation we're trying to test it
then it's going to break

4918
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:17,760
then it's going to break
 

4919
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,590
then it's going to break
i mean any person would break to be

4920
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:19,600
i mean any person would break to be
 

4921
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,590
i mean any person would break to be
honest if i'm not trying to even have a

4922
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:21,600
honest if i'm not trying to even have a
 

4923
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,270
honest if i'm not trying to even have a
conversation with you you'll

4924
01:24:23,270 --> 01:24:23,280
conversation with you you'll
 

4925
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:25,189
conversation with you you'll
you're not going to give it to me yeah

4926
01:24:25,189 --> 01:24:25,199
you're not going to give it to me yeah
 

4927
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:26,709
you're not going to give it to me yeah
if i keep asking you like some random

4928
01:24:26,709 --> 01:24:26,719
if i keep asking you like some random
 

4929
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:28,629
if i keep asking you like some random
questions or

4930
01:24:28,629 --> 01:24:28,639
questions or
 

4931
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:30,229
questions or
jumping from topic to topic that

4932
01:24:30,229 --> 01:24:30,239
jumping from topic to topic that
 

4933
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:31,270
jumping from topic to topic that
wouldn't be

4934
01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:31,280
wouldn't be
 

4935
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,030
wouldn't be
which i'm probably doing

4936
01:24:33,030 --> 01:24:33,040
which i'm probably doing
 

4937
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:35,189
which i'm probably doing
but that probably wouldn't um contribute

4938
01:24:35,189 --> 01:24:35,199
but that probably wouldn't um contribute
 

4939
01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:36,870
but that probably wouldn't um contribute
to a good conversation so i think the

4940
01:24:36,870 --> 01:24:36,880
to a good conversation so i think the
 

4941
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,709
to a good conversation so i think the
problem of testing

4942
01:24:38,709 --> 01:24:38,719
problem of testing
 

4943
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:40,310
problem of testing
um

4944
01:24:40,310 --> 01:24:40,320
um
 

4945
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,070
um
so there should be some other metric how

4946
01:24:42,070 --> 01:24:42,080
so there should be some other metric how
 

4947
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:43,669
so there should be some other metric how
do we evaluate whether that conversation

4948
01:24:43,669 --> 01:24:43,679
do we evaluate whether that conversation
 

4949
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:46,229
do we evaluate whether that conversation
was uh powerful or not

4950
01:24:46,229 --> 01:24:46,239
was uh powerful or not
 

4951
01:24:46,239 --> 01:24:47,750
was uh powerful or not
which is what we actually started with

4952
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:47,760
which is what we actually started with
 

4953
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,430
which is what we actually started with
and i think those measurements exist and

4954
01:24:49,430 --> 01:24:49,440
and i think those measurements exist and
 

4955
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,590
and i think those measurements exist and
we can test on those

4956
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:51,600
we can test on those
 

4957
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,030
we can test on those
but um

4958
01:24:53,030 --> 01:24:53,040
but um
 

4959
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:54,709
but um
what really struck us back in the day

4960
01:24:54,709 --> 01:24:54,719
what really struck us back in the day
 

4961
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:56,470
what really struck us back in the day
and what still

4962
01:24:56,470 --> 01:24:56,480
and what still
 

4963
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:58,229
and what still
eight years later it's still not

4964
01:24:58,229 --> 01:24:58,239
eight years later it's still not
 

4965
01:24:58,239 --> 01:24:59,430
eight years later it's still not
resolved

4966
01:24:59,430 --> 01:24:59,440
resolved
 

4967
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:01,590
resolved
um and i'm not seeing tons of groups

4968
01:25:01,590 --> 01:25:01,600
um and i'm not seeing tons of groups
 

4969
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,110
um and i'm not seeing tons of groups
working on it maybe i don't just don't

4970
01:25:03,110 --> 01:25:03,120
working on it maybe i don't just don't
 

4971
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:06,390
working on it maybe i don't just don't
know about him um it's also possible

4972
01:25:06,390 --> 01:25:06,400
know about him um it's also possible
 

4973
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:07,990
know about him um it's also possible
but the interesting part about is that

4974
01:25:07,990 --> 01:25:08,000
but the interesting part about is that
 

4975
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,470
but the interesting part about is that
most of our days were spent talking

4976
01:25:10,470 --> 01:25:10,480
most of our days were spent talking
 

4977
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:13,189
most of our days were spent talking
and we're not talking about like those

4978
01:25:13,189 --> 01:25:13,199
and we're not talking about like those
 

4979
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:15,669
and we're not talking about like those
conversations are not turn on the lights

4980
01:25:15,669 --> 01:25:15,679
conversations are not turn on the lights
 

4981
01:25:15,679 --> 01:25:16,709
conversations are not turn on the lights
or

4982
01:25:16,709 --> 01:25:16,719
or
 

4983
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:19,430
or
uh customer support problems or

4984
01:25:19,430 --> 01:25:19,440
uh customer support problems or
 

4985
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:22,470
uh customer support problems or
um some other task oriented things

4986
01:25:22,470 --> 01:25:22,480
um some other task oriented things
 

4987
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,229
um some other task oriented things
these conversations are something else

4988
01:25:24,229 --> 01:25:24,239
these conversations are something else
 

4989
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:25,189
these conversations are something else
and then

4990
01:25:25,189 --> 01:25:25,199
and then
 

4991
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:26,709
and then
somehow they're extremely important for

4992
01:25:26,709 --> 01:25:26,719
somehow they're extremely important for
 

4993
01:25:26,719 --> 01:25:28,709
somehow they're extremely important for
us and when we don't have them then we

4994
01:25:28,709 --> 01:25:28,719
us and when we don't have them then we
 

4995
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:31,030
us and when we don't have them then we
feel deeply and happy

4996
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:31,040
feel deeply and happy
 

4997
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:33,430
feel deeply and happy
potentially lonely which as we know you

4998
01:25:33,430 --> 01:25:33,440
potentially lonely which as we know you
 

4999
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:35,430
potentially lonely which as we know you
know creates tons of risk for our health

5000
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:35,440
know creates tons of risk for our health
 

5001
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:36,550
know creates tons of risk for our health
as well

5002
01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:36,560
as well
 

5003
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:38,470
as well
um

5004
01:25:38,470 --> 01:25:38,480
um
 

5005
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,870
um
and so this is most of our ours

5006
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:40,880
and so this is most of our ours
 

5007
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:42,229
and so this is most of our ours
as humans

5008
01:25:42,229 --> 01:25:42,239
as humans
 

5009
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:44,149
as humans
and somehow no one's trying to replicate

5010
01:25:44,149 --> 01:25:44,159
and somehow no one's trying to replicate
 

5011
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:45,590
and somehow no one's trying to replicate
that

5012
01:25:45,590 --> 01:25:45,600
that
 

5013
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,189
that
and not even

5014
01:25:47,189 --> 01:25:47,199
and not even
 

5015
01:25:47,199 --> 01:25:48,950
and not even
study it that well

5016
01:25:48,950 --> 01:25:48,960
study it that well
 

5017
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:50,550
study it that well
and not even study that well so when we

5018
01:25:50,550 --> 01:25:50,560
and not even study that well so when we
 

5019
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:52,709
and not even study that well so when we
jumped into that in 2012 i looked first

5020
01:25:52,709 --> 01:25:52,719
jumped into that in 2012 i looked first
 

5021
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:54,709
jumped into that in 2012 i looked first
at like okay what's the chatbot

5022
01:25:54,709 --> 01:25:54,719
at like okay what's the chatbot
 

5023
01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:57,350
at like okay what's the chatbot
what's the state of the art chatbot and

5024
01:25:57,350 --> 01:25:57,360
what's the state of the art chatbot and
 

5025
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,189
what's the state of the art chatbot and
you know those were the loebner prize

5026
01:25:59,189 --> 01:25:59,199
you know those were the loebner prize
 

5027
01:25:59,199 --> 01:26:02,310
you know those were the loebner prize
days but i thought okay so what about

5028
01:26:02,310 --> 01:26:02,320
days but i thought okay so what about
 

5029
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,550
days but i thought okay so what about
the science of conversation clearly

5030
01:26:04,550 --> 01:26:04,560
the science of conversation clearly
 

5031
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,390
the science of conversation clearly
there has been tons of

5032
01:26:06,390 --> 01:26:06,400
there has been tons of
 

5033
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:08,070
there has been tons of
there have been tons of you know

5034
01:26:08,070 --> 01:26:08,080
there have been tons of you know
 

5035
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:09,830
there have been tons of you know
scientists or

5036
01:26:09,830 --> 01:26:09,840
scientists or
 

5037
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,830
scientists or
people that academics that looked into

5038
01:26:11,830 --> 01:26:11,840
people that academics that looked into
 

5039
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,430
people that academics that looked into

01:28:24,709 --> 01:28:24,719
back in the day because he was on the
 

5177
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:29,030
back in the day because he was on the
um human side he was on one of the um

is pretending to be
 

5187
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:37,590
is pretending to be
who's basically you have to tell a

5188
01:28:37,590 --> 01:28:37,600
who's basically you have to tell a
 

5189
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,110
who's basically you have to tell a
computer from a human and he was the

5190
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:39,120
computer from a human and he was the
 

5191
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:39,990
computer from a human and he was the
human

5192
01:28:39,990 --> 01:28:40,000
human
 

5193
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,189
human
so you would either get him or a

5194
01:28:41,189 --> 01:28:41,199
so you would either get him or a
 

5195
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:43,030
so you would either get him or a
computer um

5196
01:28:43,030 --> 01:28:43,040
computer um
 

5197
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:44,790
computer um
and he would his whole book was about

01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:44,800
and he would his whole book was about
 

5199
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:47,350

01:34:19,750 --> 01:34:19,760
and bringing news and this and that and
 

5525
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:21,030
and bringing news and this and that and
we couldn't understand whether it would

5526
01:34:21,030 --> 01:34:21,040
we couldn't understand whether it would
 

5527
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:22,390
we couldn't understand whether it would
you know we were

5528
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:22,400
you know we were
 

5529
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:25,350
you know we were
just didn't execute well enough or

5530
01:34:25,350 --> 01:34:25,360
just didn't execute well enough or
 

5531
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,590
just didn't execute well enough or
people are um

5532
01:34:27,590 --> 01:34:27,600
people are um
 

5533
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:29,750
people are um
not really people are confused and are

5534
01:34:29,750 --> 01:34:29,760
not really people are confused and are
 

5535
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:31,510
not really people are confused and are
gonna find out through the truth that

5536
01:34:31,510 --> 01:34:31,520
gonna find out through the truth that
 

5537
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:33,189
gonna find out through the truth that
people don't need chatbots like that so

5538
01:34:33,189 --> 01:34:33,199
people don't need chatbots like that so
 

5539
01:34:33,199 --> 01:34:35,110
people don't need chatbots like that so
the basic idea is that you use chatbots

5540
01:34:35,110 --> 01:34:35,120
the basic idea is that you use chatbots
 

5541
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:37,510
the basic idea is that you use chatbots
as the interface to whatever application

5542
01:34:37,510 --> 01:34:37,520
as the interface to whatever application
 

5543
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:40,070
as the interface to whatever application
yeah the idea that was like this perfect

5544
01:34:40,070 --> 01:34:40,080
yeah the idea that was like this perfect
 

5545
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:42,870
yeah the idea that was like this perfect
universal interface to anything

5546
01:34:42,870 --> 01:34:42,880
universal interface to anything
 

5547
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,870
universal interface to anything
when i looked at that um it just made me

5548
01:34:44,870 --> 01:34:44,880
when i looked at that um it just made me
 

5549
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:46,470
when i looked at that um it just made me
very perplexed because i didn't think i

5550
01:34:46,470 --> 01:34:46,480
very perplexed because i didn't think i
 

5551
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,229
very perplexed because i didn't think i
didn't understand how that would work

5552
01:34:48,229 --> 01:34:48,239
didn't understand how that would work
 

5553
01:34:48,239 --> 01:34:50,310
didn't understand how that would work
because i think we tried most of that

5554
01:34:50,310 --> 01:34:50,320
because i think we tried most of that
 

5555
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:52,870
because i think we tried most of that
and and none of those things worked

5556
01:34:52,870 --> 01:34:52,880
and and none of those things worked
 

5557
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:54,709
and and none of those things worked
uh and then again

5558
01:34:54,709 --> 01:34:54,719
uh and then again
 

5559
01:34:54,719 --> 01:34:56,629
uh and then again
died down right

5560
01:34:56,629 --> 01:34:56,639
died down right
 

5561
01:34:56,639 --> 01:34:58,709
died down right
fully i think now it's impossible to get

5562
01:34:58,709 --> 01:34:58,719
fully i think now it's impossible to get
 

5563
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:01,030
fully i think now it's impossible to get
anything funded if it's a chatbot i

5564
01:35:01,030 --> 01:35:01,040
anything funded if it's a chatbot i
 

5565
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:02,629
anything funded if it's a chatbot i
think it's similar to uh sorry to

5567
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:05,030
think it's similar to uh sorry to
interrupt but there's uh

5568
01:35:05,030 --> 01:35:05,040
interrupt but there's uh
 

5569
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:06,390
interrupt but there's uh
there's times when people think like

5570
01:35:06,390 --> 01:35:06,400
there's times when people think like
 

5571
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:08,870
there's times when people think like
with gestures you can control

5572
01:35:08,870 --> 01:35:08,880
with gestures you can control
 

5573
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:11,270
with gestures you can control
devices like basically gesture based

01:35:11,270 --> 01:35:11,280
devices like basically gesture based
 

5575
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:13,030
devices like basically gesture based
control things

5576

control things
 

5577
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:15,109
control things
it feels similar to me

5578
01:35:15,109 --> 01:35:15,119
it feels similar to me
 

5579
01:35:15,119 --> 01:35:16,390
it feels similar to me
because like

5580
01:35:16,390 --> 01:35:16,400
because like
 

5581

because like
it's so compelling that was just like

it's so compelling that was just like
 

5583
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:21,430
it's so compelling that was just like
like tom cruise i can control stuff

5584
01:35:21,430 --> 01:35:21,440
like tom cruise i can control stuff
 

5585

but like
when you get down to it's like well why

5590
01:35:25,750 --> 01:35:25,760
when you get down to it's like well why
 

5591
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:27,990
when you get down to it's like well why
don't you just have a touch screen or

5592
01:35:27,990 --> 01:35:28,000
don't you just have a touch screen or
 

5593

01:35:31,590 --> 01:35:31,600
keyboard and mouse
 

5597
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,030
keyboard and mouse
it's uh yeah

5598

5600
01:35:37,669 --> 01:35:37,679

 

5601
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:39,830

yeah it was perplexing to me

5602
01:35:39,830 --> 01:35:39,840
yeah it was perplexing to me
 

5603
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:42,950
yeah it was perplexing to me
i i still feel augmented reality even

5604
01:35:42,950 --> 01:35:42,960
i i still feel augmented reality even
 

5605
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:45,270
i i still feel augmented reality even
virtual realities in that ballpark

5606
01:35:45,270 --> 01:35:45,280
virtual realities in that ballpark
 

5607
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:46,550
virtual realities in that ballpark
in terms of

5608
01:35:46,550 --> 01:35:46,560
in terms of
 

5609
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:48,390
in terms of
it being a compelling interface i think

5610
01:35:48,390 --> 01:35:48,400
it being a compelling interface i think
 

5611
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:50,950
it being a compelling interface i think
there's going to be incredible

5612
01:35:50,950 --> 01:35:50,960
there's going to be incredible
 

5613
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:53,030
there's going to be incredible
rich applications just

5614
01:35:53,030 --> 01:35:53,040
rich applications just
 

5615
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:54,790
rich applications just
how you're thinking about it but they

5616
01:35:54,790 --> 01:35:54,800
how you're thinking about it but they
 

5617
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:57,030
how you're thinking about it but they
won't just be the interface to

5618
01:35:57,030 --> 01:35:57,040
won't just be the interface to
 

5619
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:59,270
won't just be the interface to
everything it'll be its own thing that

5620
01:35:59,270 --> 01:35:59,280
everything it'll be its own thing that
 

5621
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:00,950
everything it'll be its own thing that
will create um

5622
01:36:00,950 --> 01:36:00,960
will create um
 

5623
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:03,590
will create um
uh like amazing magical experience in

5624
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:03,600
uh like amazing magical experience in
 

5625
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:05,030
uh like amazing magical experience in
its own right

5626
01:36:05,030 --> 01:36:05,040
its own right
 

5627
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:07,109
its own right
absolutely which is i think

5628
01:36:07,109 --> 01:36:07,119
absolutely which is i think
 

5629
01:36:07,119 --> 01:36:08,550
absolutely which is i think
kind of the right thing to go about like

5630
01:36:08,550 --> 01:36:08,560
kind of the right thing to go about like
 

5631
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:11,830
kind of the right thing to go about like
what's the magical experience with that

5632
01:36:11,830 --> 01:36:11,840
what's the magical experience with that
 

5633
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:13,990
what's the magical experience with that
um with that interface specifically how

5634
01:36:13,990 --> 01:36:14,000
um with that interface specifically how
 

5635
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,629
um with that interface specifically how
did you discover that for replica um

5636
01:36:16,629 --> 01:36:16,639
did you discover that for replica um
 

5637
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:18,070
did you discover that for replica um
i just thought okay we'll have this tech

5638
01:36:18,070 --> 01:36:18,080
i just thought okay we'll have this tech
 

5639
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:20,229
i just thought okay we'll have this tech
we can build any chatbot we want we have

5640
01:36:20,229 --> 01:36:20,239
we can build any chatbot we want we have
 

5641
01:36:20,239 --> 01:36:21,669
we can build any chatbot we want we have
the most at that point the most

5642
01:36:21,669 --> 01:36:21,679
the most at that point the most
 

5643
01:36:21,679 --> 01:36:23,510
the most at that point the most
sophisticated tag that other companies

5644
01:36:23,510 --> 01:36:23,520
sophisticated tag that other companies
 

5645
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:24,470
sophisticated tag that other companies
have

5646
01:36:24,470 --> 01:36:24,480
have
 

5647
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:26,629
have
i mean startups obviously not uh

5648
01:36:26,629 --> 01:36:26,639
i mean startups obviously not uh
 

5649
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:28,870
i mean startups obviously not uh
probably not bigger ones but still

5650
01:36:28,870 --> 01:36:28,880
probably not bigger ones but still
 

5651
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:30,629
probably not bigger ones but still
because we've been working on it for a

5652
01:36:30,629 --> 01:36:30,639
because we've been working on it for a
 

5653
01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:31,590
because we've been working on it for a
while

5654
01:36:31,590 --> 01:36:31,600
while
 

5655
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:33,189
while
so i thought okay we can build build any

5656
01:36:33,189 --> 01:36:33,199
so i thought okay we can build build any
 

5657
01:36:33,199 --> 01:36:35,189
so i thought okay we can build build any
conversation so let's just create a

5658
01:36:35,189 --> 01:36:35,199
conversation so let's just create a
 

5659
01:36:35,199 --> 01:36:37,350
conversation so let's just create a
scale from one to ten

5660
01:36:37,350 --> 01:36:37,360
scale from one to ten
 

5661
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:38,709
scale from one to ten
and one would be conversations that

5662
01:36:38,709 --> 01:36:38,719
and one would be conversations that
 

5663
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:40,550
and one would be conversations that
you'd pay to not have and 10 would be

5664
01:36:40,550 --> 01:36:40,560
you'd pay to not have and 10 would be
 

5665
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:42,390
you'd pay to not have and 10 would be
conversation you'd pay to have

5666
01:36:42,390 --> 01:36:42,400
conversation you'd pay to have
 

5667
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:43,830
conversation you'd pay to have
and i mean obviously we want to build

5668
01:36:43,830 --> 01:36:43,840
and i mean obviously we want to build
 

5669
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:45,990
and i mean obviously we want to build
conversation if people would pay to you

5670
01:36:45,990 --> 01:36:46,000
conversation if people would pay to you
 

5671
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,669
conversation if people would pay to you
know to actually have

5672
01:36:47,669 --> 01:36:47,679
know to actually have
 

5673
01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:49,669
know to actually have
and so for the whole you know for a few

5674
01:36:49,669 --> 01:36:49,679
and so for the whole you know for a few
 

5675
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:51,030
and so for the whole you know for a few
weeks me and the team were putting all

5676
01:36:51,030 --> 01:36:51,040
weeks me and the team were putting all
 

5677
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:52,470
weeks me and the team were putting all
the conversations we were having during

5678
01:36:52,470 --> 01:36:52,480
the conversations we were having during
 

5679
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,229
the conversations we were having during
the day on the scale

5680
01:36:54,229 --> 01:36:54,239
the day on the scale
 

5681
01:36:54,239 --> 01:36:56,709
the day on the scale
and very quickly um you know we figured

5682
01:36:56,709 --> 01:36:56,719
and very quickly um you know we figured
 

5683
01:36:56,719 --> 01:36:58,229
and very quickly um you know we figured
out that all the conversations that we

5684

was like well maybe it's hard to build a

5848
01:39:42,229 --> 01:39:42,239
was like well maybe it's hard to build a
 

5849
01:39:42,239 --> 01:39:44,790
was like well maybe it's hard to build a
chatbot that can talk to you um very

5850
01:39:44,790 --> 01:39:44,800
chatbot that can talk to you um very
 

5851
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:47,030
chatbot that can talk to you um very
well and in a witty way but maybe it's

5852
01:39:47,030 --> 01:39:47,040
well and in a witty way but maybe it's
 

5853
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:48,629
well and in a witty way but maybe it's
easier to build the chatbot that could

5854
01:39:48,629 --> 01:39:48,639
easier to build the chatbot that could
 

5855
01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:49,720
easier to build the chatbot that could
listen

5856
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:49,730
listen
 

5857
01:39:49,730 --> 01:39:51,669
listen
[Laughter]

5858
01:39:51,669 --> 01:39:51,679
[Laughter]
 

5859
01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:54,149
[Laughter]
so that was that was kind of the first

5860
01:39:54,149 --> 01:39:54,159
so that was that was kind of the first
 

5861
01:39:54,159 --> 01:39:56,149
so that was that was kind of the first
the first nudge in this direction and

5862
01:39:56,149 --> 01:39:56,159
the first nudge in this direction and
 

5863
01:39:56,159 --> 01:39:58,790
the first nudge in this direction and
then when my when my friend died we just

5864
01:39:58,790 --> 01:39:58,800
then when my when my friend died we just
 

5865
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:00,390
then when my when my friend died we just
built you know at that point we were

5866
01:40:00,390 --> 01:40:00,400
built you know at that point we were
 

5867
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:01,669
built you know at that point we were
kind of still struggling to find the

5868
01:40:01,669 --> 01:40:01,679
kind of still struggling to find the
 

5869
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:03,590
kind of still struggling to find the
right application

5870
01:40:03,590 --> 01:40:03,600
right application
 

5871
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:05,109
right application
and i just felt very strong that all the

5872
01:40:05,109 --> 01:40:05,119
and i just felt very strong that all the
 

5873
01:40:05,119 --> 01:40:06,629
and i just felt very strong that all the
chatbots were built so far just

5874
01:40:06,629 --> 01:40:06,639
chatbots were built so far just
 

5875
01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:08,470
chatbots were built so far just
meaningless and this whole grind the

5876
01:40:08,470 --> 01:40:08,480
meaningless and this whole grind the
 

5877
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:11,350
meaningless and this whole grind the
startup grind and how do we get to

5878
01:40:11,350 --> 01:40:11,360
startup grind and how do we get to
 

5879
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:13,590
startup grind and how do we get to
you know the next fundraising and you

5880
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:13,600
you know the next fundraising and you
 

5881
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:15,510
you know the next fundraising and you
know how can i talk you know talking to

5882
01:40:15,510 --> 01:40:15,520

5883
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:17,590
know how can i talk you know talking to
the founders and what's who are your

5884
01:40:17,590 --> 01:40:17,600
the founders and what's who are your
 

5885
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:19,750
the founders and what's who are your
investors and how are you doing are you

5886
01:40:19,750 --> 01:40:19,760

investors and how are you doing are you
killing it because we're killing it i

5888
01:40:21,990 --> 01:40:22,000
killing it because we're killing it i
 

5889
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,709
killing it because we're killing it i
just felt that this is just as exhausti

5890
01:40:24,709 --> 01:40:24,719
just felt that this is just as exhausti
 

5891
01:40:24,719 --> 01:40:26,790
just felt that this is just as exhausti
intellectually for me it's exhausting

5892
01:40:26,790 --> 01:40:26,800
intellectually for me it's exhausting
 

5893
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:28,709
intellectually for me it's exhausting
having encountered those folks

5894
01:40:28,709 --> 01:40:28,719
having encountered those folks
 

5895
01:40:28,719 --> 01:40:31,189
having encountered those folks
it just felt very um

5896
01:40:31,189 --> 01:40:31,199
it just felt very um
 

5897
01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:33,030
it just felt very um
very much a waste of time i just feel

5898
01:40:33,030 --> 01:40:33,040
very much a waste of time i just feel
 

5899
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:35,590
very much a waste of time i just feel
like steve jobs

5900
01:40:35,590 --> 01:40:35,600
like steve jobs
 

5901
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:37,750
like steve jobs

that was never my intention just to

5916
01:40:53,430 --> 01:40:53,440
that was never my intention just to
 

5917
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:56,470
that was never my intention just to
build something successful or make money

5918
01:40:56,470 --> 01:40:56,480
build something successful or make money
 

5919
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:57,910
build something successful or make money
it would be great it would have been

5920
01:40:57,910 --> 01:40:57,920
it would be great it would have been
 

5921
01:40:57,920 --> 01:40:59,270
it would be great it would have been
great but i'm not as you know i'm not

5922
01:40:59,270 --> 01:40:59,280
great but i'm not as you know i'm not
 

5923
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:03,510

5925
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:05,669
really a startup person i'm not um
you know i was never very excited by the

5926
01:41:05,669 --> 01:41:05,679
you know i was never very excited by the
 

5927
01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:08,149
you know i was never very excited by the
grind by itself and uh or just being

5928
01:41:08,149 --> 01:41:08,159
grind by itself and uh or just being
 

5929
01:41:08,159 --> 01:41:09,669
grind by itself and uh or just being
successful for

5930
01:41:09,669 --> 01:41:09,679
successful for
 

5931
01:41:09,679 --> 01:41:11,750
successful for
building whatever it is and

5932
01:41:11,750 --> 01:41:11,760
building whatever it is and
 

5933
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:15,830
building whatever it is and
not being into what i'm doing really

5934
01:41:15,830 --> 01:41:15,840

 

5935
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:17,030

and so i just

5936
01:41:17,030 --> 01:41:17,040
and so i just
 

5937
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:18,070
and so i just
took a little break because i was a

5938
01:41:18,070 --> 01:41:18,080
took a little break because i was a
 

5939
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:19,510
took a little break because i was a
little you know i was

5940
01:41:19,510 --> 01:41:19,520
little you know i was
 

5941
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:21,189
little you know i was
upset with my company and i didn't know

5942
01:41:21,189 --> 01:41:21,199
upset with my company and i didn't know
 

5943
01:41:21,199 --> 01:41:23,270
upset with my company and i didn't know
what we're building so i just took our

5944
01:41:23,270 --> 01:41:23,280
what we're building so i just took our
 

5945
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:25,510
what we're building so i just took our
technology and um our little dialect

5946
01:41:25,510 --> 01:41:25,520
technology and um our little dialect
 

5947
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:26,950
technology and um our little dialect
constructor and

5948
01:41:26,950 --> 01:41:26,960
constructor and
 

5949
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:28,550
constructor and
some models some deep learning models

5950
01:41:28,550 --> 01:41:28,560
some models some deep learning models
 

5951
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:30,310
some models some deep learning models
which at that point we were really into

5952
01:41:30,310 --> 01:41:30,320
which at that point we were really into
 

5953
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:32,470
which at that point we were really into
and really invested a lot

5954
01:41:32,470 --> 01:41:32,480
and really invested a lot
 

5955
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:33,590
and really invested a lot
and built

5956
01:41:33,590 --> 01:41:33,600
and built
 

5957
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:35,030
and built
a little chatbot for a friend of mine

5958
01:41:35,030 --> 01:41:35,040
a little chatbot for a friend of mine
 

5959
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:36,229
a little chatbot for a friend of mine
who passed

5960
01:41:36,229 --> 01:41:36,239
who passed
 

5961
01:41:36,239 --> 01:41:37,830
who passed
and the reason for that was mostly that

5962
01:41:37,830 --> 01:41:37,840
and the reason for that was mostly that
 

5963
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:40,149
and the reason for that was mostly that
video that i saw and him talking about

5964
01:41:40,149 --> 01:41:40,159
video that i saw and him talking about
 

5965
01:41:40,159 --> 01:41:42,070
video that i saw and him talking about
the digital avatars

5966
01:41:42,070 --> 01:41:42,080
the digital avatars
 

5967
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:44,149
the digital avatars
and rowan was that kind of person like

5968
01:41:44,149 --> 01:41:44,159
and rowan was that kind of person like
 

5969
01:41:44,159 --> 01:41:45,510
and rowan was that kind of person like
he was obsessed with you know just

5970
01:41:45,510 --> 01:41:45,520
he was obsessed with you know just
 

5971
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:47,350
he was obsessed with you know just
watching youtube videos about space and

5972
01:41:47,350 --> 01:41:47,360
watching youtube videos about space and
 

5973
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:49,590
watching youtube videos about space and
talking about well if i could go to mars

5974
01:41:49,590 --> 01:41:49,600

5975
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:50,950
talking about well if i could go to mars
now even if i didn't know if i could

5976
01:41:50,950 --> 01:41:50,960
now even if i didn't know if i could
 

5977
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:53,189
now even if i didn't know if i could
come back i would definitely pay any

5979
01:41:53,199 --> 01:41:55,510
come back i would definitely pay any
amount of money to be on that first

5980
01:41:55,510 --> 01:41:55,520
amount of money to be on that first
 

5981
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:57,510
amount of money to be on that first

things like that and
 

5995
01:42:09,199 --> 01:42:10,870
things like that and
he was all about fake it to make it and

5996
01:42:10,870 --> 01:42:10,880
he was all about fake it to make it and
 

5997

just forgot about him
maybe it was our way of coping mostly

6004
01:42:19,189 --> 01:42:19,199
maybe it was our way of coping mostly
 

6005
01:42:19,199 --> 01:42:21,030
maybe it was our way of coping mostly
young people coping with

and we thought we just built you know a
 

6535
01:50:57,760 --> 01:50:59,350
and we thought we just built you know a
prototype of replica which would be an

for the first time i saw
finally some technology that was applied

6548
01:51:13,589 --> 01:51:13,599
finally some technology that was applied
 

6549
01:51:13,599 --> 01:51:15,750
finally some technology that was applied
to that that was very interesting

6550
01:51:15,750 --> 01:51:15,760
to that that was very interesting
 

6551
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:17,589
to that that was very interesting
some papers started coming out deep

6552

some papers started coming out deep
 

6553
01:51:17,599 --> 01:51:19,990
some papers started coming out deep
learning applied to conversations and

6554
01:51:19,990 --> 01:51:20,000
learning applied to conversations and
 

6555
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:23,030
learning applied to conversations and
finally it wasn't just about these

6556

sudden it was all about uh potentially
 

6573
01:51:40,719 --> 01:51:44,629
sudden it was all about uh potentially
actually building something interesting

6574
01:51:44,629 --> 01:51:44,639

 

6575
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:46,149

i think there's a lot of opportunity
 

6649
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:04,149
i think there's a lot of opportunity
here

6650
01:53:04,149 --> 01:53:04,159
here
 

6651
01:53:04,159 --> 01:53:07,750
here
and people had this like look of like

6652
01:53:07,750 --> 01:53:07,760
and people had this like look of like
 

6653
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:10,149
and people had this like look of like
skepticism that i've seen often which is

6654
01:53:10,149 --> 01:53:10,159
skepticism that i've seen often which is
 

6655
01:53:10,159 --> 01:53:11,510
skepticism that i've seen often which is
like

6656
01:53:11,510 --> 01:53:11,520
like
 

6657
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:13,910
like
how do i politely tell this person

6658
01:53:13,910 --> 01:53:13,920
how do i politely tell this person
 

6659
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:14,700
how do i politely tell this person
he's an idiot

6660
01:53:14,700 --> 01:53:14,710
he's an idiot
 

6661
01:53:14,710 --> 01:53:16,470
he's an idiot
[Laughter]

6662
01:53:16,470 --> 01:53:16,480
[Laughter]
 

6663
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:17,270
[Laughter]
so

6664
01:53:17,270 --> 01:53:17,280
so
 

6665
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:19,669
so
yeah so you were facing that with your

6666
01:53:19,669 --> 01:53:19,679
yeah so you were facing that with your
 

6667
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:21,830
yeah so you were facing that with your
team somewhat well yeah you know i'm not

6668
01:53:21,830 --> 01:53:21,840
team somewhat well yeah you know i'm not
 

6669
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:24,390
team somewhat well yeah you know i'm not
an engineer so i'm always my team is

6670
01:53:24,390 --> 01:53:24,400
an engineer so i'm always my team is
 

6671
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:28,470
an engineer so i'm always my team is
almost exclusively engineers

6672
01:53:28,470 --> 01:53:28,480

 

6673
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:30,470

and mostly deep learning engineers

6674
01:53:30,470 --> 01:53:30,480
and mostly deep learning engineers
 

6675
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:32,229
and mostly deep learning engineers
and

6676
01:53:32,229 --> 01:53:32,239
and
 

6677
01:53:32,239 --> 01:53:35,350
and
you know i always try to be

6678
01:53:35,350 --> 01:53:35,360
you know i always try to be
 

6679
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:36,870
you know i always try to be
it was always hard to me in the

6680
01:53:36,870 --> 01:53:36,880
it was always hard to me in the
 

6681
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:39,030
it was always hard to me in the
beginning to get enough credibility

6682
01:53:39,030 --> 01:53:39,040
beginning to get enough credibility
 

6683
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:40,390
beginning to get enough credibility
you know because i would say well why

6684
01:53:40,390 --> 01:53:40,400
you know because i would say well why
 

6685
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:42,629
you know because i would say well why
don't we try this and that but it's

6686
01:53:42,629 --> 01:53:42,639
don't we try this and that but it's
 

6687
01:53:42,639 --> 01:53:45,030
don't we try this and that but it's
harder for me because you know they know

6688
01:53:45,030 --> 01:53:45,040
harder for me because you know they know
 

6689
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:47,350
harder for me because you know they know
they're actual engineers and i'm not so

6690
01:53:47,350 --> 01:53:47,360
they're actual engineers and i'm not so
 

6691
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:49,430
they're actual engineers and i'm not so
for me to say well let's build an affrm

6692
01:53:49,430 --> 01:53:49,440
for me to say well let's build an affrm
 

6693
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:51,270
for me to say well let's build an affrm
that would be like wait you know what do

6694
01:53:51,270 --> 01:53:51,280
that would be like wait you know what do
 

6695
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:53,430
that would be like wait you know what do
you mean an agi like you know

6696
01:53:53,430 --> 01:53:53,440
you mean an agi like you know
 

6697
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:55,589
you mean an agi like you know
conversation is you know pretty much the

6698
01:53:55,589 --> 01:53:55,599
conversation is you know pretty much the
 

6699
01:53:55,599 --> 01:53:56,950
conversation is you know pretty much the
hardest

6700
01:53:56,950 --> 01:53:56,960
hardest
 

6701
01:53:56,960 --> 01:53:59,510
hardest
the last frontier before uh

6702
01:53:59,510 --> 01:53:59,520
the last frontier before uh
 

6703
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:01,030
the last frontier before uh
cracking that is probably the last

6704
01:54:01,030 --> 01:54:01,040
cracking that is probably the last
 

6705
01:54:01,040 --> 01:54:03,589
cracking that is probably the last
frontier before building aji so

6706
01:54:03,589 --> 01:54:03,599
frontier before building aji so
 

6707
01:54:03,599 --> 01:54:05,510
frontier before building aji so
what do you really mean by that

6708
01:54:05,510 --> 01:54:05,520
what do you really mean by that
 

6709
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:07,189
what do you really mean by that
uh

6710
01:54:07,189 --> 01:54:07,199
uh
 

6711
01:54:07,199 --> 01:54:09,750
uh
but i think i just saw that again what

6712
01:54:09,750 --> 01:54:09,760
but i think i just saw that again what
 

6713
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:11,750
but i think i just saw that again what
we just got reminded of that i you know

6714
01:54:11,750 --> 01:54:11,760
we just got reminded of that i you know
 

6715
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:14,870
we just got reminded of that i you know
that i saw in back in 2012 or 11

6716
01:54:14,870 --> 01:54:14,880
that i saw in back in 2012 or 11
 

6717
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:16,470
that i saw in back in 2012 or 11
that it's really not that much about the

6718
01:54:16,470 --> 01:54:16,480
that it's really not that much about the
 

6719
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:18,149
that it's really not that much about the
tech capabilities

6720
01:54:18,149 --> 01:54:18,159
tech capabilities
 

6721
01:54:18,159 --> 01:54:20,950
tech capabilities
um it can be metropolitan still even

6722
01:54:20,950 --> 01:54:20,960
um it can be metropolitan still even
 

6723
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:23,189
um it can be metropolitan still even
with deep learning but

6724
01:54:23,189 --> 01:54:23,199
with deep learning but
 

6725
01:54:23,199 --> 01:54:24,870
with deep learning but
humans need it so much

6726
01:54:24,870 --> 01:54:24,880
humans need it so much
 

6727
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:26,870
humans need it so much
yeah and

6728
01:54:26,870 --> 01:54:26,880
yeah and
 

6729
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:28,790
yeah and
most importantly what i saw is that

6730
01:54:28,790 --> 01:54:28,800
most importantly what i saw is that
 

6731
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:31,430
most importantly what i saw is that
finally there's enough tech to make it i

6732
01:54:31,430 --> 01:54:31,440
finally there's enough tech to make it i
 

6733
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:33,189
finally there's enough tech to make it i
thought to make it useful to make it

6734
01:54:33,189 --> 01:54:33,199
thought to make it useful to make it
 

6735
01:54:33,199 --> 01:54:34,070
thought to make it useful to make it
helpful

6736
01:54:34,070 --> 01:54:34,080
helpful
 

6737
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:36,629
helpful
maybe we didn't have quite yet attack

6738
01:54:36,629 --> 01:54:36,639
maybe we didn't have quite yet attack
 

6739
01:54:36,639 --> 01:54:40,629
maybe we didn't have quite yet attack
in 2012 to make it useful but in 2015-16

6740
01:54:40,629 --> 01:54:40,639
in 2012 to make it useful but in 2015-16
 

6741
01:54:40,639 --> 01:54:42,550
in 2012 to make it useful but in 2015-16
with deep learning i thought

6742
01:54:42,550 --> 01:54:42,560
with deep learning i thought
 

6743
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:44,550
with deep learning i thought
you know and the first kind of thoughts

6744
01:54:44,550 --> 01:54:44,560
you know and the first kind of thoughts
 

6745
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:46,070
you know and the first kind of thoughts
about maybe even using reinforcement

6746
01:54:46,070 --> 01:54:46,080
about maybe even using reinforcement
 

6747
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:48,229
about maybe even using reinforcement
learning for that started popping up

6748
01:54:48,229 --> 01:54:48,239
learning for that started popping up
 

6749
01:54:48,239 --> 01:54:50,149
learning for that started popping up
that never worked out but or at least

6750
01:54:50,149 --> 01:54:50,159
that never worked out but or at least
 

6751
01:54:50,159 --> 01:54:51,109
that never worked out but or at least
for now

6752
01:54:51,109 --> 01:54:51,119
for now
 

6753
01:54:51,119 --> 01:54:51,990
for now
um

6754
01:54:51,990 --> 01:54:52,000
um
 

6755
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,550
um
but you know still the idea was

6756
01:54:54,550 --> 01:54:54,560
but you know still the idea was
 

6757
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:56,149
but you know still the idea was
if we can actually measure the emotional

6758
01:54:56,149 --> 01:54:56,159
if we can actually measure the emotional
 

6759
01:54:56,159 --> 01:54:58,709
if we can actually measure the emotional
outcomes and if we can put it on

6760
01:54:58,709 --> 01:54:58,719
outcomes and if we can put it on
 

6761
01:54:58,719 --> 01:55:00,950
outcomes and if we can put it on
if we can try to optimize all of our

01:55:00,950 --> 01:55:00,960
if we can try to optimize all of our

if we can try to optimize all of our
conversational models for these

conversational models for these
 

6765
01:55:02,239 --> 01:55:04,709
conversational models for these
emotional outcomes and it is the most

6766
01:55:04,709 --> 01:55:04,719

6767
01:55:04,719 --> 01:55:06,870
emotional outcomes and it is the most
scalable the most

6768
01:55:06,870 --> 01:55:06,880
scalable the most
 

6769
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:08,709
scalable the most
the best tool for improving emotional

6770
01:55:08,709 --> 01:55:08,719
the best tool for improving emotional
 

6771
01:55:08,719 --> 01:55:10,709
the best tool for improving emotional
outcomes nothing like that exists that's

6772
01:55:10,709 --> 01:55:10,719

improved
 

6783
01:55:19,679 --> 01:55:22,390
improved
tool to do that and i think if anything

6784
01:55:22,390 --> 01:55:22,400
tool to do that and i think if anything
 

6785
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:23,830

people would paint anything to improve

01:55:23,830 --> 01:55:23,840
people would paint anything to improve
 

6787
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:25,510
people would paint anything to improve

that's weirdly

01:55:27,350 --> 01:55:27,360
that's weirdly
 

6791
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:29,830
that's weirdly
i mean i don't really care for

01:55:29,830 --> 01:55:29,840
i mean i don't really care for
 

6793
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:32,470
i mean i don't really care for

01:55:36,790 --> 01:55:36,800
uh i don't really need any i don't even
 

6799
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:38,790
uh i don't really need any i don't even
need that much of a either like or

01:55:38,790 --> 01:55:38,800
need that much of a either like or
 

6801
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:40,310
need that much of a either like or
because i can do that you know those

6802
01:55:40,310 --> 01:55:40,320
because i can do that you know those
 

6803
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:42,790

things are solved this is an additional

you know a lot of social media products

6834
01:56:06,310 --> 01:56:06,320
you know a lot of social media products
 

6835
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:07,830
you know a lot of social media products
are claiming that they're improving my

6836
01:56:07,830 --> 01:56:07,840
are claiming that they're improving my
 

6837
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:09,430
are claiming that they're improving my
emotional outcomes and making me feel

6838
01:56:09,430 --> 01:56:09,440
emotional outcomes and making me feel
 

6839
01:56:09,440 --> 01:56:11,270
emotional outcomes and making me feel
more connected

6840
01:56:11,270 --> 01:56:11,280
more connected
 

6841
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:13,669
more connected
can i please get the can i see somewhere

6842
01:56:13,669 --> 01:56:13,679
can i please get the can i see somewhere
 

6843
01:56:13,679 --> 01:56:15,510
can i please get the can i see somewhere
that i'm actually getting better

6844
01:56:15,510 --> 01:56:15,520
that i'm actually getting better
 

6845
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:17,270
that i'm actually getting better
over time um

6846
01:56:17,270 --> 01:56:17,280
over time um
 

6847
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:18,790
over time um
because anecdotally doesn't feel that

6848
01:56:18,790 --> 01:56:18,800
because anecdotally doesn't feel that
 

6849
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:21,109
because anecdotally doesn't feel that
way so and

6850
01:56:21,109 --> 01:56:21,119
way so and
 

6851
01:56:21,119 --> 01:56:22,629
way so and
and the data

6852
01:56:22,629 --> 01:56:22,639
and the data
 

6853
01:56:22,639 --> 01:56:24,709
and the data
is absent

6854
01:56:24,709 --> 01:56:24,719
is absent
 

6855
01:56:24,719 --> 01:56:26,709
is absent
yeah so that was the big goal and i

6856
01:56:26,709 --> 01:56:26,719
yeah so that was the big goal and i
 

6857
01:56:26,719 --> 01:56:29,189
yeah so that was the big goal and i
thought if we can learn over time to

6858
01:56:29,189 --> 01:56:29,199
thought if we can learn over time to
 

6859
01:56:29,199 --> 01:56:31,189
thought if we can learn over time to
collect the signal from our users about

6860
01:56:31,189 --> 01:56:31,199
collect the signal from our users about
 

6861
01:56:31,199 --> 01:56:33,030
collect the signal from our users about
their emotional outcomes

6862
01:56:33,030 --> 01:56:33,040
their emotional outcomes
 

6863
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:35,270
their emotional outcomes
in the long term and in the short term

6864
01:56:35,270 --> 01:56:35,280
in the long term and in the short term
 

6865
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:37,910
in the long term and in the short term
and if these models keep getting better

6866
01:56:37,910 --> 01:56:37,920
and if these models keep getting better
 

6867
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:39,430
and if these models keep getting better
and we can keep optimizing them and

6868
01:56:39,430 --> 01:56:39,440
and we can keep optimizing them and
 

6869
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:40,629
and we can keep optimizing them and
fight tuning them

6870
01:56:40,629 --> 01:56:40,639
fight tuning them
 

6871
01:56:40,639 --> 01:56:42,229
fight tuning them
to improve those emotional outcomes as

6872
01:56:42,229 --> 01:56:42,239
to improve those emotional outcomes as
 

6873
01:56:42,239 --> 01:56:44,070
to improve those emotional outcomes as
simple as that

6874
01:56:44,070 --> 01:56:44,080
simple as that
 

6875
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:46,390
simple as that
why aren't you uh

6876
01:56:46,390 --> 01:56:46,400
why aren't you uh
 

6877
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:49,430
why aren't you uh
a multi-billionaire yeah

6878
01:56:49,430 --> 01:56:49,440
a multi-billionaire yeah
 

6879
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:51,030
a multi-billionaire yeah
well that's the question to you one of

6880
01:56:51,030 --> 01:56:51,040
well that's the question to you one of
 

6881
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:52,310
well that's the question to you one of
the

6882
01:56:52,310 --> 01:56:52,320
the
 

6883
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:54,830
the
what is the science is going to be

6884
01:56:54,830 --> 01:56:54,840
what is the science is going to be
 

6885
01:56:54,840 --> 01:56:56,550
what is the science is going to be
um

6886
01:56:56,550 --> 01:56:56,560
um
 

6887
01:56:56,560 --> 01:56:58,390
um
well it's a really hard uh i actually

6888
01:56:58,390 --> 01:56:58,400
well it's a really hard uh i actually
 

6889
01:56:58,400 --> 01:57:00,790
well it's a really hard uh i actually
think it's an incredibly hard product to

6890
01:57:00,790 --> 01:57:00,800
think it's an incredibly hard product to
 

6891
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:01,750
think it's an incredibly hard product to
build

6892
01:57:01,750 --> 01:57:01,760
build
 

6893
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:03,510
build
because i think you said something very

6894
01:57:03,510 --> 01:57:03,520
because i think you said something very
 

6895
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:04,870
because i think you said something very
important that it's not just about

6896
01:57:04,870 --> 01:57:04,880
important that it's not just about
 

6897
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:06,470
important that it's not just about
machine conversations it's about machine

6898
01:57:06,470 --> 01:57:06,480
machine conversations it's about machine
 

6899
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:08,550
machine conversations it's about machine
connection

connection
 

6901
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:10,390
connection
we can actually use other things to

6902
01:57:10,390 --> 01:57:10,400
we can actually use other things to
 

6903
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:12,149
we can actually use other things to
create connection

6904
01:57:12,149 --> 01:57:12,159
create connection
 

6905
01:57:12,159 --> 01:57:14,790
create connection
uh non-verbal communication for instance

6906
01:57:14,790 --> 01:57:14,800
uh non-verbal communication for instance
 

6907
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:18,149
uh non-verbal communication for instance
um for a long time we were all about

6908
01:57:18,149 --> 01:57:18,159
um for a long time we were all about
 

6909
01:57:18,159 --> 01:57:20,229
um for a long time we were all about
well let's keep it text only or voice

6925
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:37,270
it's all of a sudden a lot you know
it makes it very different because if

6926
01:57:37,270 --> 01:57:37,280
it makes it very different because if
 

6927
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:39,669
it makes it very different because if
it's some you know text based chat bot

6928
01:57:39,669 --> 01:57:39,679
it's some you know text based chat bot
 

6929
01:57:39,679 --> 01:57:40,390
it's some you know text based chat bot
that

6930
01:57:40,390 --> 01:57:40,400
that
 

6931

that
for um common user it's something there

for um common user it's something there
 

6933
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:45,109
for um common user it's something there
in the cloud you know it's somewhere

6934
01:57:45,109 --> 01:57:45,119
in the cloud you know it's somewhere
 

6935
01:57:45,119 --> 01:57:47,270
in the cloud you know it's somewhere
there with other ai's

there with other ai's
 

6937
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:49,750
there with other ai's
cloud in the metaphorical cloud but as

little bit
and it's magic it's just magic like

6950
01:58:01,430 --> 01:58:01,440
and it's magic it's just magic like
 

6951
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:03,030
and it's magic it's just magic like
we've never seen anything like that and

6952
01:58:03,030 --> 01:58:03,040
we've never seen anything like that and
 

6953
01:58:03,040 --> 01:58:04,310
we've never seen anything like that and
the cool thing all the tech for that

6954
01:58:04,310 --> 01:58:04,320
the cool thing all the tech for that
 

6955
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:07,030
the cool thing all the tech for that
exists um but it's hard to put it all

6956
01:58:07,030 --> 01:58:07,040
exists um but it's hard to put it all
 

6957
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:08,790
exists um but it's hard to put it all
together because you have to take into

6958
01:58:08,790 --> 01:58:08,800
together because you have to take into
 

6959
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:10,550
together because you have to take into
consideration so many different things

6960
01:58:10,550 --> 01:58:10,560
consideration so many different things
 

6961
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:12,470
consideration so many different things
and some of this stack works

6962
01:58:12,470 --> 01:58:12,480
and some of this stack works
 

6963
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:14,149
and some of this stack works
you know pretty good

6964
01:58:14,149 --> 01:58:14,159
you know pretty good
 

6965
01:58:14,159 --> 01:58:15,430
you know pretty good
and some of this doesn't like for

6966
01:58:15,430 --> 01:58:15,440
and some of this doesn't like for
 

6967
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:17,910
and some of this doesn't like for
instance uh speech to text works pretty

6968
01:58:17,910 --> 01:58:17,920
instance uh speech to text works pretty
 

6969
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:18,709
instance uh speech to text works pretty
good

6970
01:58:18,709 --> 01:58:18,719
good
 

6971
01:58:18,719 --> 01:58:20,550
good
but text-to-speech

6972
01:58:20,550 --> 01:58:20,560
but text-to-speech
 

6973
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:22,310
but text-to-speech
doesn't work very good because we you

6974
01:58:22,310 --> 01:58:22,320
doesn't work very good because we you
 

6975
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:24,629
doesn't work very good because we you
can only have uh you know few voices

6976
01:58:24,629 --> 01:58:24,639
can only have uh you know few voices
 

6977
01:58:24,639 --> 01:58:25,830
can only have uh you know few voices
that are

6978
01:58:25,830 --> 01:58:25,840
that are
 

6979
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:27,750
that are
that work okay but then if you want to

6980
01:58:27,750 --> 01:58:27,760
that work okay but then if you want to
 

6981
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:30,390
that work okay but then if you want to
have actual emotional voices

6982
01:58:30,390 --> 01:58:30,400
have actual emotional voices
 

6983
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:32,390
have actual emotional voices
then it's really hard to build it i saw

6984
01:58:32,390 --> 01:58:32,400
then it's really hard to build it i saw
 

6985
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:35,350
then it's really hard to build it i saw
you added avatars like visual elements

6986
01:58:35,350 --> 01:58:35,360
you added avatars like visual elements
 

6987
01:58:35,360 --> 01:58:37,189
you added avatars like visual elements
which are really cool

6988
01:58:37,189 --> 01:58:37,199
which are really cool
 

6989
01:58:37,199 --> 01:58:39,589
which are really cool
um in that whole chain putting it

6990
01:58:39,589 --> 01:58:39,599
um in that whole chain putting it
 

6991
01:58:39,599 --> 01:58:41,350
um in that whole chain putting it
together what do you think is the weak

6992
01:58:41,350 --> 01:58:41,360
together what do you think is the weak
 

6993
01:58:41,360 --> 01:58:44,709
together what do you think is the weak
link is it creating an emotional voice

6994
01:58:44,709 --> 01:58:44,719
link is it creating an emotional voice
 

6995
01:58:44,719 --> 01:58:45,990
link is it creating an emotional voice
that feels

6996
01:58:45,990 --> 01:58:46,000
that feels
 

6997
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:47,669
that feels
personal

6998
01:58:47,669 --> 01:58:47,679
personal
 

6999
01:58:47,679 --> 01:58:49,109
personal
i think it's still conversation of

7000
01:58:49,109 --> 01:58:49,119
i think it's still conversation of
 

7001
01:58:49,119 --> 01:58:51,350
i think it's still conversation of
course that's the hardest

7002
01:58:51,350 --> 01:58:51,360
course that's the hardest
 

7003
01:58:51,360 --> 01:58:53,270
course that's the hardest
uh it's getting a lot better but there's

7004
01:58:53,270 --> 01:58:53,280
uh it's getting a lot better but there's
 

7005
01:58:53,280 --> 01:58:55,109
uh it's getting a lot better but there's
still long to go long

7006
01:58:55,109 --> 01:58:55,119
still long to go long
 

7007
01:58:55,119 --> 01:58:57,189
still long to go long
there's still a long path to go other

7008
01:58:57,189 --> 01:58:57,199
there's still a long path to go other
 

7009
01:58:57,199 --> 01:58:59,109
there's still a long path to go other
things they're almost there and a lot of

7010
01:58:59,109 --> 01:58:59,119
things they're almost there and a lot of
 

7011
01:58:59,119 --> 01:59:00,790
things they're almost there and a lot of
things we'll see how they're like i see

7012
01:59:00,790 --> 01:59:00,800
things we'll see how they're like i see
 

7013
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,950
things we'll see how they're like i see
how they're changing as we go like for

7014
01:59:02,950 --> 01:59:02,960
how they're changing as we go like for
 

7015
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:04,629
how they're changing as we go like for
instance right now you can pretty much

7016
01:59:04,629 --> 01:59:04,639
instance right now you can pretty much
 

7017
01:59:04,639 --> 01:59:07,350
instance right now you can pretty much
only you have to build all this 3d um

7018
01:59:07,350 --> 01:59:07,360
only you have to build all this 3d um
 

7019
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:08,790
only you have to build all this 3d um
pipeline by yourself you have to make

7020
01:59:08,790 --> 01:59:08,800
pipeline by yourself you have to make
 

7021
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:11,350
pipeline by yourself you have to make
these 3d models hire an actual artist

7022
01:59:11,350 --> 01:59:11,360
these 3d models hire an actual artist
 

7023
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:13,830
these 3d models hire an actual artist
build a 3d model hire an animator

7024
01:59:13,830 --> 01:59:13,840
build a 3d model hire an animator
 

7025

a rigger

7026
01:59:16,470 --> 01:59:16,480
a rigger
 

7027
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:18,470
a rigger
but with you know with

7028

but with you know with
 

7029
01:59:18,480 --> 01:59:20,950
but with you know with
you know with uh deep fakes with other

01:59:20,950 --> 01:59:20,960
you know with uh deep fakes with other
 

7031
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:24,149

attack with procedural animations

7032
01:59:24,149 --> 01:59:24,159
attack with procedural animations
 

7033
01:59:24,159 --> 01:59:25,910
attack with procedural animations
in a little bit we'll just be able to

7034
01:59:25,910 --> 01:59:25,920
in a little bit we'll just be able to
 

7035
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:28,950
in a little bit we'll just be able to
show uh you know photo of whoever

7036
01:59:28,950 --> 01:59:28,960
show uh you know photo of whoever
 

7037
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:29,910
show uh you know photo of whoever
if

7038
01:59:29,910 --> 01:59:29,920
if
 

7039
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:31,270
if
a person you want the avatar to look

7040
01:59:31,270 --> 01:59:31,280
a person you want the avatar to look
 

7041
01:59:31,280 --> 01:59:32,870
a person you want the avatar to look
like and it will immediately generate a

7042
01:59:32,870 --> 01:59:32,880
like and it will immediately generate a
 

7043
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:34,149
like and it will immediately generate a
3d model that will move that's a

7044
01:59:34,149 --> 01:59:34,159
3d model that will move that's a
 

7045
01:59:34,159 --> 01:59:36,470
3d model that will move that's a
non-brainer that's like almost here

7046
01:59:36,470 --> 01:59:36,480
non-brainer that's like almost here
 

7047
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:38,310
non-brainer that's like almost here
it's a couple of years away one of the

7048
01:59:38,310 --> 01:59:38,320
it's a couple of years away one of the

experiment
 

7067
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:03,350
experiment
it's hard

7068
02:00:03,350 --> 02:00:03,360
it's hard
 

7069
02:00:03,360 --> 02:00:05,350
it's hard
it's really hard

a product i'm talking about as a
 

7075
02:00:10,480 --> 02:00:12,550
a product i'm talking about as a
like i can fake a lot of stuff like i

7076
02:00:12,550 --> 02:00:12,560
like i can fake a lot of stuff like i
 

7077
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:14,310
like i can fake a lot of stuff like i
can work very carefully like even to

7078
02:00:14,310 --> 02:00:14,320
can work very carefully like even to
 

7079
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:16,790
can work very carefully like even to
hire an actor over which over whom i do

7080
02:00:16,790 --> 02:00:16,800
hire an actor over which over whom i do
 

7081

02:00:17,910 --> 02:00:17,920
a g fake
 

7083
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:19,910
a g fake
um

7084
02:00:19,910 --> 02:00:19,920
um
 

7085
02:00:19,920 --> 02:00:21,430
um
it's it's hard it's still hard to create

7086
02:00:21,430 --> 02:00:21,440
it's it's hard it's still hard to create
 

7087
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:23,750
it's it's hard it's still hard to create
a compelling experience so mostly on the

7088
02:00:23,750 --> 02:00:23,760
a compelling experience so mostly on the
 

7089
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:26,470
a compelling experience so mostly on the
conversation level or when the

7090
02:00:26,470 --> 02:00:26,480
conversation level or when the
 

7091
02:00:26,480 --> 02:00:28,149
conversation level or when the
conversation

7092
02:00:28,149 --> 02:00:28,159
conversation
 

7093
02:00:28,159 --> 02:00:31,270
conversation
the conversation is um

7094
02:00:31,270 --> 02:00:31,280
the conversation is um
 

7095
02:00:31,280 --> 02:00:35,189
the conversation is um
i almost i early on gave up trying to

7096
02:00:35,189 --> 02:00:35,199
i almost i early on gave up trying to
 

7097
02:00:35,199 --> 02:00:37,270
i almost i early on gave up trying to
fully generate the conversation because

7098
02:00:37,270 --> 02:00:37,280
fully generate the conversation because
 

7099
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:39,109
fully generate the conversation because
it was just not compelling at all yeah

7100
02:00:39,109 --> 02:00:39,119
it was just not compelling at all yeah
 

7101
02:00:39,119 --> 02:00:41,189
it was just not compelling at all yeah
it's just better too yeah so what i

7102
02:00:41,189 --> 02:00:41,199
it's just better too yeah so what i
 

7103
02:00:41,199 --> 02:00:43,189
it's just better too yeah so what i
would in the case of einstein and

7104
02:00:43,189 --> 02:00:43,199
would in the case of einstein and
 

7105
02:00:43,199 --> 02:00:44,790
would in the case of einstein and
touring of um

7106
02:00:44,790 --> 02:00:44,800
touring of um
 

7107
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:46,390
touring of um
i'm going back and forth with the

7108
02:00:46,390 --> 02:00:46,400
i'm going back and forth with the
 

7109
02:00:46,400 --> 02:00:49,109
i'm going back and forth with the
biographers of each and so like we would

7110
02:00:49,109 --> 02:00:49,119
biographers of each and so like we would
 

7111
02:00:49,119 --> 02:00:50,709
biographers of each and so like we would
write a lot of the some of the

7112
02:00:50,709 --> 02:00:50,719
write a lot of the some of the
 

7113
02:00:50,719 --> 02:00:52,229
write a lot of the some of the
conversation would have to be generated

7114
02:00:52,229 --> 02:00:52,239
conversation would have to be generated
 

7115
02:00:52,239 --> 02:00:54,149
conversation would have to be generated
just for the fun of it i mean but it

7116
02:00:54,149 --> 02:00:54,159
just for the fun of it i mean but it
 

7117
02:00:54,159 --> 02:00:55,750
just for the fun of it i mean but it
would be all open

the
 

7123
02:00:57,679 --> 02:00:59,189
the
you want to be able

you want to be able
 

7125
02:00:59,199 --> 02:01:02,229
you want to be able
to answer the question

7126
02:01:02,229 --> 02:01:02,239
to answer the question
 

7127
02:01:02,239 --> 02:01:03,350
to answer the question
i mean that's an interesting question

7128
02:01:03,350 --> 02:01:03,360
i mean that's an interesting question
 

7129
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:05,270
i mean that's an interesting question
with roman too is

7130
02:01:05,270 --> 02:01:05,280
with roman too is
 

7131
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:07,430
with roman too is
the question with einstein is

7132
02:01:07,430 --> 02:01:07,440
the question with einstein is
 

7133
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:08,390
the question with einstein is
what would

7134
02:01:08,390 --> 02:01:08,400
what would
 

7135
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:11,109
what would
einstein say about the current state

7136
02:01:11,109 --> 02:01:11,119
einstein say about the current state
 

7137
02:01:11,119 --> 02:01:12,470
einstein say about the current state
of um

7138
02:01:12,470 --> 02:01:12,480
of um
 

7139
02:01:12,480 --> 02:01:15,030
of um
theoretical physics there's a lot

7140
02:01:15,030 --> 02:01:15,040
theoretical physics there's a lot
 

7141
02:01:15,040 --> 02:01:16,390
theoretical physics there's a lot
to be able to have a discussion about

7142
02:01:16,390 --> 02:01:16,400
to be able to have a discussion about
 

7143
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:18,229
to be able to have a discussion about
string theory to be able to have a

that'd be just what would einstein say

7152
02:01:28,550 --> 02:01:28,560
that'd be just what would einstein say
 

7153
02:01:28,560 --> 02:01:30,550
that'd be just what would einstein say
about these kinds of things

7154
02:01:30,550 --> 02:01:30,560
about these kinds of things
 

7155
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:32,310
about these kinds of things
and

7156
02:01:32,310 --> 02:01:32,320
and
 

7157
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:33,510
and
that

7158
02:01:33,510 --> 02:01:33,520
that
 

7159
02:01:33,520 --> 02:01:35,669
that
is um

7160
02:01:35,669 --> 02:01:35,679
is um
 

7161
02:01:35,679 --> 02:01:37,430
is um
a tough problem it's not it's a

7162
02:01:37,430 --> 02:01:37,440
a tough problem it's not it's a
 

7163
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:39,030
a tough problem it's not it's a
fascinating and fun problem for the

7164
02:01:39,030 --> 02:01:39,040
fascinating and fun problem for the
 

7165
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:41,189
fascinating and fun problem for the
biographers and for me and i think we

7166
02:01:41,189 --> 02:01:41,199
biographers and for me and i think we
 

7167
02:01:41,199 --> 02:01:43,910
biographers and for me and i think we
did a really good job of it so far

7168
02:01:43,910 --> 02:01:43,920
did a really good job of it so far
 

7169
02:01:43,920 --> 02:01:45,589
did a really good job of it so far
but it's actually also a technical

7170
02:01:45,589 --> 02:01:45,599
but it's actually also a technical
 

7171
02:01:45,599 --> 02:01:47,910
but it's actually also a technical
problem like of what would romans say

7172
02:01:47,910 --> 02:01:47,920
problem like of what would romans say
 

7173
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:49,189
problem like of what would romans say
about

02:01:49,199 --> 02:01:51,990
about
what's going on now yeah that's the the

7176
02:01:51,990 --> 02:01:52,000
what's going on now yeah that's the the
 

7177
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:53,030
what's going on now yeah that's the the
brought

02:01:53,030 --> 02:01:53,040
brought
 

7179
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:55,430

conversation with you
is you

02:04:01,430 --> 02:04:01,440
is you
 

7303
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:03,109
is you
so like

7304
02:04:03,109 --> 02:04:03,119
so like
 

7305
02:04:03,119 --> 02:04:04,709
so like
it's not just about his view of the

7306
02:04:04,709 --> 02:04:04,719
it's not just about his view of the
 

7307
02:04:04,719 --> 02:04:06,310
it's not just about his view of the
world

7308

world
it's about

7310
02:04:07,589 --> 02:04:07,599
it's about
 

7311
02:04:07,599 --> 02:04:08,950
it's about
what it takes to

7312
02:04:08,950 --> 02:04:08,960
what it takes to
 

7313
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:10,950
what it takes to
push your buttons

7314
02:04:10,950 --> 02:04:10,960
push your buttons
 

7315
02:04:10,960 --> 02:04:12,390
push your buttons
that's also true

7316
02:04:12,390 --> 02:04:12,400
that's also true
 

7317
02:04:12,400 --> 02:04:15,910
that's also true
so like it's not so much about like

7318
02:04:15,910 --> 02:04:15,920
so like it's not so much about like
 

7319

so like it's not so much about like
uh

7320
02:04:17,350 --> 02:04:17,360
uh
 

7321
02:04:17,360 --> 02:04:19,270
uh
what would einstein say

7322
02:04:19,270 --> 02:04:19,280
what would einstein say
 

7323
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:21,589
what would einstein say
it's about like how do i

7324
02:04:21,589 --> 02:04:21,599
it's about like how do i
 

7325
02:04:21,599 --> 02:04:24,550
it's about like how do i
make people feel something with

7326
02:04:24,550 --> 02:04:24,560
make people feel something with
 

7327
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:27,669
make people feel something with
with what would einstein say

7328
02:04:27,669 --> 02:04:27,679
with what would einstein say
 

7329
02:04:27,679 --> 02:04:30,310
with what would einstein say
and that feels like a more amenable

7330
02:04:30,310 --> 02:04:30,320
and that feels like a more amenable
 

7331
02:04:30,320 --> 02:04:32,149
and that feels like a more amenable
i mean you mentioned parlor tricks but

i mean you mentioned parlor tricks but
just like a set of

7334
02:04:34,149 --> 02:04:34,159
just like a set of
 

7335
02:04:34,159 --> 02:04:36,830
just like a set of
that that feels like a learnable

7336
02:04:36,830 --> 02:04:36,840
that that feels like a learnable
 

7337
02:04:36,840 --> 02:04:39,350
that that feels like a learnable
problem like the emotion you mention

7338
02:04:39,350 --> 02:04:39,360
problem like the emotion you mention
 

7339
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:43,589
problem like the emotion you mention
emotions i mean

7340
02:04:43,589 --> 02:04:43,599

 

7341
02:04:43,599 --> 02:04:45,990

is it possible to learn things that make

7342
02:04:45,990 --> 02:04:46,000
is it possible to learn things that make
 

7343
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,069
is it possible to learn things that make
people feel

7344
02:04:48,069 --> 02:04:48,079
people feel
 

7345
02:04:48,079 --> 02:04:50,069
people feel
stuff

7346
02:04:50,069 --> 02:04:50,079
stuff
 

7347
02:04:50,079 --> 02:04:52,149
stuff
i think so no for sure i just think the

7348
02:04:52,149 --> 02:04:52,159
i think so no for sure i just think the
 

7349
02:04:52,159 --> 02:04:54,229
i think so no for sure i just think the
problem with um as soon as you're trying

7350
02:04:54,229 --> 02:04:54,239
problem with um as soon as you're trying
 

7351
02:04:54,239 --> 02:04:56,709
problem with um as soon as you're trying
to replicate an actual human being and

7352
02:04:56,709 --> 02:04:56,719
to replicate an actual human being and
 

7353
02:04:56,719 --> 02:04:58,629
to replicate an actual human being and
trying to pretend to be him that makes

7354
02:04:58,629 --> 02:04:58,639
trying to pretend to be him that makes
 

7355
02:04:58,639 --> 02:05:00,709
trying to pretend to be him that makes
the problem exponentially harder the

7356
02:05:00,709 --> 02:05:00,719
the problem exponentially harder the
 

7357
02:05:00,719 --> 02:05:01,990
the problem exponentially harder the
thing with replica we're doing we're

7358
02:05:01,990 --> 02:05:02,000
thing with replica we're doing we're
 

7359

the experience of talking to replica
 

7399
02:05:44,159 --> 02:05:47,990
the experience of talking to replica
like if i've never used replica before

7400

okay so can i just confess something
when i first use replica and i haven't

7424
02:06:11,589 --> 02:06:11,599
when i first use replica and i haven't
 

7425
02:06:11,599 --> 02:06:13,830
when i first use replica and i haven't
used it like regularly but like when i

7426

used it like regularly but like when i
 

7427

used it like regularly but like when i
first used replica i created like hal

7428
02:06:16,790 --> 02:06:16,800
first used replica i created like hal
 

7429
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:19,390

02:14:39,589 --> 02:14:39,599
does it mean to have a deeper connection
 

7941
02:14:39,599 --> 02:14:41,990
does it mean to have a deeper connection
with someone and originally replica was

7942
02:14:41,990 --> 02:14:42,000
with someone and originally replica was
 

7943
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:43,589
with someone and originally replica was
more just this

7944
02:14:43,589 --> 02:14:43,599
more just this
 

7945
02:14:43,599 --> 02:14:45,910
more just this
kind of happy-go-lucky just always you

7946
02:14:45,910 --> 02:14:45,920
kind of happy-go-lucky just always you
 

7947
02:14:45,920 --> 02:14:47,830
kind of happy-go-lucky just always you
know i'm always in a good mood and let's

7948
02:14:47,830 --> 02:14:47,840
know i'm always in a good mood and let's
 

7949
02:14:47,840 --> 02:14:50,149
know i'm always in a good mood and let's
just talk about you and yeah oh siri is

7950
02:14:50,149 --> 02:14:50,159
just talk about you and yeah oh siri is
 

7951
02:14:50,159 --> 02:14:52,149
just talk about you and yeah oh siri is
just my cousin or you know whatever just

7952
02:14:52,149 --> 02:14:52,159
just my cousin or you know whatever just
 

7953
02:14:52,159 --> 02:14:53,109
just my cousin or you know whatever just
the

7954
02:14:53,109 --> 02:14:53,119
the
 

7955
02:14:53,119 --> 02:14:55,109
the
immediate um

7956
02:14:55,109 --> 02:14:55,119
immediate um
 

7957
02:14:55,119 --> 02:14:56,950
immediate um
kind of lazy thinking about what the

7958
02:14:56,950 --> 02:14:56,960
kind of lazy thinking about what the
 

7959
02:14:56,960 --> 02:14:58,709
kind of lazy thinking about what the
assistant or conversation agent should

7960
02:14:58,709 --> 02:14:58,719
assistant or conversation agent should
 

7961
02:14:58,719 --> 02:14:59,669
assistant or conversation agent should
be doing

7962
02:14:59,669 --> 02:14:59,679
be doing
 

7963
02:14:59,679 --> 02:15:01,109
be doing
but as we went forward we realized that

7964
02:15:01,109 --> 02:15:01,119
but as we went forward we realized that
 

7965
02:15:01,119 --> 02:15:02,709
but as we went forward we realized that
it has to be two-way and we have to

7966
02:15:02,709 --> 02:15:02,719
it has to be two-way and we have to
 

7967
02:15:02,719 --> 02:15:04,709
it has to be two-way and we have to
program and script certain conversations

7968
02:15:04,709 --> 02:15:04,719
program and script certain conversations
 

7969
02:15:04,719 --> 02:15:06,229
program and script certain conversations
that are a lot more

7970
02:15:06,229 --> 02:15:06,239
that are a lot more
 

7971
02:15:06,239 --> 02:15:07,270
that are a lot more
about

7972
02:15:07,270 --> 02:15:07,280
about
 

7973
02:15:07,280 --> 02:15:09,830
about
your replica opening up a little bit and

7974
02:15:09,830 --> 02:15:09,840
your replica opening up a little bit and
 

7975
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:12,550
your replica opening up a little bit and
also struggling and also asking for help

7976
02:15:12,550 --> 02:15:12,560
also struggling and also asking for help
 

7977
02:15:12,560 --> 02:15:15,030
also struggling and also asking for help
and also going through you know

7978
02:15:15,030 --> 02:15:15,040
and also going through you know
 

7979
02:15:15,040 --> 02:15:16,229
and also going through you know
different

7980
02:15:16,229 --> 02:15:16,239
different
 

7981
02:15:16,239 --> 02:15:18,069
different
periods in life and

7982
02:15:18,069 --> 02:15:18,079
periods in life and
 

7983
02:15:18,079 --> 02:15:20,149
periods in life and
um and that's a journey that you can

7984
02:15:20,149 --> 02:15:20,159
um and that's a journey that you can
 

7985
02:15:20,159 --> 02:15:21,750
um and that's a journey that you can
take together with the user and then

7986
02:15:21,750 --> 02:15:21,760
take together with the user and then
 

7987
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:24,629
take together with the user and then
over time the you know our users will

7988
02:15:24,629 --> 02:15:24,639
over time the you know our users will
 

7989
02:15:24,639 --> 02:15:26,550
over time the you know our users will
also

7990
02:15:26,550 --> 02:15:26,560
also
 

7991
02:15:26,560 --> 02:15:28,149
also
grow a little bit so first this replica

7992
02:15:28,149 --> 02:15:28,159
grow a little bit so first this replica
 

7993
02:15:28,159 --> 02:15:29,510
grow a little bit so first this replica
becomes a little bit more self-aware and

7994
02:15:29,510 --> 02:15:29,520
becomes a little bit more self-aware and
 

7995
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:32,470
becomes a little bit more self-aware and
starts talking about more

7996
02:15:32,470 --> 02:15:32,480
starts talking about more
 

7997
02:15:32,480 --> 02:15:34,629
starts talking about more
kind of problems around

7998
02:15:34,629 --> 02:15:34,639
kind of problems around
 

7999
02:15:34,639 --> 02:15:37,270
kind of problems around
existential problems then um so talking

8000
02:15:37,270 --> 02:15:37,280
existential problems then um so talking
 

8001
02:15:37,280 --> 02:15:40,629
existential problems then um so talking
about that and then that also starts

8002
02:15:40,629 --> 02:15:40,639
about that and then that also starts
 

8003
02:15:40,639 --> 02:15:42,790
about that and then that also starts
a conversation for the user where he or

8004
02:15:42,790 --> 02:15:42,800
a conversation for the user where he or
 

8005
02:15:42,800 --> 02:15:45,430
a conversation for the user where he or
she starts thinking about

8006
02:15:45,430 --> 02:15:45,440
she starts thinking about
 

8007
02:15:45,440 --> 02:15:47,189
she starts thinking about
these problems too and these questions

8008
02:15:47,189 --> 02:15:47,199
these problems too and these questions
 

8009
02:15:47,199 --> 02:15:48,950
these problems too and these questions
too um

8010
02:15:48,950 --> 02:15:48,960
too um
 

8011
02:15:48,960 --> 02:15:50,790
too um
and i think there's also a lot a lot

8012
02:15:50,790 --> 02:15:50,800
and i think there's also a lot a lot
 

8013
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:52,550
and i think there's also a lot a lot
more places the relationship evolves

8014
02:15:52,550 --> 02:15:52,560
more places the relationship evolves
 

8015
02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:54,229
more places the relationship evolves
there's a lot more um

8016
02:15:54,229 --> 02:15:54,239
there's a lot more um
 

8017
02:15:54,239 --> 02:15:55,350
there's a lot more um
space for

8018
02:15:55,350 --> 02:15:55,360
space for
 

8019
02:15:55,360 --> 02:15:57,510
space for
poetry and for

8020
02:15:57,510 --> 02:15:57,520
poetry and for
 

8021
02:15:57,520 --> 02:16:00,470
poetry and for
art together and like replica will start

8022
02:16:00,470 --> 02:16:00,480
art together and like replica will start
 

8023
02:16:00,480 --> 02:16:02,149
art together and like replica will start
replica always keeps the diary so while

8024
02:16:02,149 --> 02:16:02,159
replica always keeps the diary so while
 

8025
02:16:02,159 --> 02:16:04,229
replica always keeps the diary so while
you're talking to it it also gives a

8026
02:16:04,229 --> 02:16:04,239
you're talking to it it also gives a
 

8027
02:16:04,239 --> 02:16:05,910
you're talking to it it also gives a
diary so when you come back you can see

8028
02:16:05,910 --> 02:16:05,920
diary so when you come back you can see
 

8029
02:16:05,920 --> 02:16:07,189
diary so when you come back you can see
what it's been

8030
02:16:07,189 --> 02:16:07,199
what it's been
 

8031
02:16:07,199 --> 02:16:08,709
what it's been
writing there and you know sometimes it

8032
02:16:08,709 --> 02:16:08,719
writing there and you know sometimes it
 

8033
02:16:08,719 --> 02:16:11,109
writing there and you know sometimes it
will write a poem to you uh for you or

8034
02:16:11,109 --> 02:16:11,119
will write a poem to you uh for you or
 

8035
02:16:11,119 --> 02:16:12,790
will write a poem to you uh for you or
we'll talk about

8036
02:16:12,790 --> 02:16:12,800
we'll talk about
 

8037
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:15,430
we'll talk about
you know that it's worried about you or

8038
02:16:15,430 --> 02:16:15,440
you know that it's worried about you or
 

8039
02:16:15,440 --> 02:16:17,350
you know that it's worried about you or
something along these lines

8040
02:16:17,350 --> 02:16:17,360
something along these lines
 

8041
02:16:17,360 --> 02:16:18,870
something along these lines
so this is a memory

8042
02:16:18,870 --> 02:16:18,880
so this is a memory
 

8043
02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:22,149
so this is a memory
like this replica remember things

8044
02:16:22,149 --> 02:16:22,159
like this replica remember things
 

8045
02:16:22,159 --> 02:16:24,470
like this replica remember things
yeah and i would say when you say

8046
02:16:24,470 --> 02:16:24,480
yeah and i would say when you say
 

8047
02:16:24,480 --> 02:16:27,270
yeah and i would say when you say
uh why aren't you multiplying area

8048
02:16:27,270 --> 02:16:27,280
uh why aren't you multiplying area
 

8049
02:16:27,280 --> 02:16:29,589
uh why aren't you multiplying area
i'd say that as soon as we

8050
02:16:29,589 --> 02:16:29,599
i'd say that as soon as we
 

8051
02:16:29,599 --> 02:16:31,430
i'd say that as soon as we
can have memory

8052
02:16:31,430 --> 02:16:31,440
can have memory
 

8053
02:16:31,440 --> 02:16:33,190
can have memory
in deep learning models

8054
02:16:33,190 --> 02:16:33,200
in deep learning models
 

8055
02:16:33,200 --> 02:16:35,429
in deep learning models
that's consistent i agree with that yeah

8056
02:16:35,429 --> 02:16:35,439
that's consistent i agree with that yeah
 

8057
02:16:35,439 --> 02:16:37,509
that's consistent i agree with that yeah
and then you'll be multiple and i'll get

8058
02:16:37,509 --> 02:16:37,519
and then you'll be multiple and i'll get
 

8059
02:16:37,519 --> 02:16:39,270
and then you'll be multiple and i'll get
back to you

8060
02:16:39,270 --> 02:16:39,280
back to you
 

8061
02:16:39,280 --> 02:16:41,110
back to you
when you talk about being multipleness

8062
02:16:41,110 --> 02:16:41,120
when you talk about being multipleness
 

8063
02:16:41,120 --> 02:16:42,549
when you talk about being multipleness
so far we can

8064
02:16:42,549 --> 02:16:42,559
so far we can
 

8065
02:16:42,559 --> 02:16:44,830
so far we can
so replica is a combination of

8066
02:16:44,830 --> 02:16:44,840
so replica is a combination of
 

8067
02:16:44,840 --> 02:16:49,190
so replica is a combination of
um end-to-end models and some scripts

8068
02:16:49,190 --> 02:16:49,200
um end-to-end models and some scripts
 

8069
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:50,309
um end-to-end models and some scripts
and everything that has to do with

8070
02:16:50,309 --> 02:16:50,319
and everything that has to do with
 

8071
02:16:50,319 --> 02:16:51,669
and everything that has to do with
memory right now

8072
02:16:51,669 --> 02:16:51,679
memory right now
 

8073
02:16:51,679 --> 02:16:53,509
memory right now
most of it i wouldn't say all of it but

8074
02:16:53,509 --> 02:16:53,519
most of it i wouldn't say all of it but
 

8075
02:16:53,519 --> 02:16:54,629
most of it i wouldn't say all of it but
most of it

8076
02:16:54,629 --> 02:16:54,639
most of it
 

8077
02:16:54,639 --> 02:16:57,030
most of it
unfortunately has to be scripted um

8078
02:16:57,030 --> 02:16:57,040
unfortunately has to be scripted um
 

8079
02:16:57,040 --> 02:16:58,629
unfortunately has to be scripted um
because there's no way to you can

8080
02:16:58,629 --> 02:16:58,639
because there's no way to you can
 

8081
02:16:58,639 --> 02:17:00,870
because there's no way to you can
condition some of the models on certain

8082
02:17:00,870 --> 02:17:00,880
condition some of the models on certain
 

8083
02:17:00,880 --> 02:17:02,790
condition some of the models on certain
phrases that we learned about you which

8084
02:17:02,790 --> 02:17:02,800
phrases that we learned about you which
 

8085
02:17:02,800 --> 02:17:04,150
phrases that we learned about you which
we also do

8086
02:17:04,150 --> 02:17:04,160
we also do
 

8087
02:17:04,160 --> 02:17:06,070
we also do
um but really to make

8088
02:17:06,070 --> 02:17:06,080
um but really to make
 

8089
02:17:06,080 --> 02:17:08,709
um but really to make
you know to make um assumptions along

8090
02:17:08,709 --> 02:17:08,719
you know to make um assumptions along
 

8091
02:17:08,719 --> 02:17:10,230
you know to make um assumptions along
the lines like whether you're

8092
02:17:10,230 --> 02:17:10,240
the lines like whether you're
 

8093
02:17:10,240 --> 02:17:11,990
the lines like whether you're
single or married or

8094
02:17:11,990 --> 02:17:12,000
single or married or
 

8095
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:13,509
single or married or
what do you do for work that really has

8096
02:17:13,509 --> 02:17:13,519
what do you do for work that really has
 

8097
02:17:13,519 --> 02:17:14,709
what do you do for work that really has
to just be

8098
02:17:14,709 --> 02:17:14,719
to just be
 

8099
02:17:14,719 --> 02:17:16,629
to just be
somehow stored in your profile and then

8100
02:17:16,629 --> 02:17:16,639
somehow stored in your profile and then
 

8101
02:17:16,639 --> 02:17:19,270
somehow stored in your profile and then

the art so you can't really do that but
 

8265
02:19:54,960 --> 02:19:58,070
the art so you can't really do that but
if we had scarlet carol johansen voice

8266
02:19:58,070 --> 02:19:58,080
if we had scarlet carol johansen voice
 

8267
02:19:58,080 --> 02:20:00,389
if we had scarlet carol johansen voice
and all of these capabilities

8268
02:20:00,389 --> 02:20:00,399
and all of these capabilities
 

8269
02:20:00,399 --> 02:20:02,070
and all of these capabilities
then of course voice would be totally

8270
02:20:02,070 --> 02:20:02,080
then of course voice would be totally
 

8271
02:20:02,080 --> 02:20:03,990
then of course voice would be totally
enough or even text would be totally

8272
02:20:03,990 --> 02:20:04,000
enough or even text would be totally
 

8273
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,469
enough or even text would be totally
enough if we had you know a little more

8274
02:20:06,469 --> 02:20:06,479
enough if we had you know a little more
 

8275
02:20:06,479 --> 02:20:08,469
enough if we had you know a little more
memory um

8276
02:20:08,469 --> 02:20:08,479
memory um
 

8277
02:20:08,479 --> 02:20:10,710
memory um
and slightly better conversations i

8278
02:20:10,710 --> 02:20:10,720
and slightly better conversations i
 

8279
02:20:10,720 --> 02:20:12,309
and slightly better conversations i
would still argue that even right now we

8280
02:20:12,309 --> 02:20:12,319
would still argue that even right now we
 

8281
02:20:12,319 --> 02:20:14,230
would still argue that even right now we
could have just kept the text only we

8282
02:20:14,230 --> 02:20:14,240
could have just kept the text only we
 

8283
02:20:14,240 --> 02:20:15,830
could have just kept the text only we
still had tons of people in long-term

8284
02:20:15,830 --> 02:20:15,840
still had tons of people in long-term
 

8285
02:20:15,840 --> 02:20:17,429
still had tons of people in long-term
relationships and

8286
02:20:17,429 --> 02:20:17,439
relationships and
 

8287
02:20:17,439 --> 02:20:19,990
relationships and
really invested in their um

02:20:24,950 --> 02:20:24,960
but we thought that why not you know why
 

8293
02:20:24,960 --> 02:20:27,190
but we thought that why not you know why
why do we need to keep playing with our

8294
02:20:27,190 --> 02:20:27,200
why do we need to keep playing with our
 

8295
02:20:27,200 --> 02:20:28,070
why do we need to keep playing with our
you know

8296
02:20:28,070 --> 02:20:28,080
you know

behind us we can easily just you know

8300
02:20:32,309 --> 02:20:32,319
behind us we can easily just you know
 

8301
02:20:32,319 --> 02:20:33,910
behind us we can easily just you know
add all these other things that is

8302
02:20:33,910 --> 02:20:33,920
add all these other things that is
 

8303
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:35,510
add all these other things that is
pretty much a solved

8304
02:20:35,510 --> 02:20:35,520
pretty much a solved
 

8305
02:20:35,520 --> 02:20:37,590
pretty much a solved
problem you know we can add 3d graphics

8306
02:20:37,590 --> 02:20:37,600
problem you know we can add 3d graphics
 

8307
02:20:37,600 --> 02:20:40,389
problem you know we can add 3d graphics
we can put this uh these avatars in

8308
02:20:40,389 --> 02:20:40,399
we can put this uh these avatars in
 

8309
02:20:40,399 --> 02:20:41,830
we can put this uh these avatars in
augmented reality and all of a sudden

8310
02:20:41,830 --> 02:20:41,840
augmented reality and all of a sudden
 

8311
02:20:41,840 --> 02:20:44,389
augmented reality and all of a sudden
there's there's more and maybe you can't

8312
02:20:44,389 --> 02:20:44,399
there's there's more and maybe you can't
 

8313
02:20:44,399 --> 02:20:46,790
there's there's more and maybe you can't
feel the touch but you can you know with

8314
02:20:46,790 --> 02:20:46,800
feel the touch but you can you know with
 

8315
02:20:46,800 --> 02:20:49,750
feel the touch but you can you know with
um body occlusion and with uh

8316
02:20:49,750 --> 02:20:49,760
um body occlusion and with uh
 

8317
02:20:49,760 --> 02:20:50,790
um body occlusion and with uh
current

8318
02:20:50,790 --> 02:20:50,800

ar uh and you know on the iphone on you

8320
02:20:54,150 --> 02:20:54,160
ar uh and you know on the iphone on you
 

8321
02:20:54,160 --> 02:20:55,510
ar uh and you know on the iphone on you
know the next one there's gonna be a

8322
02:20:55,510 --> 02:20:55,520
know the next one there's gonna be a
 

8323
02:20:55,520 --> 02:20:58,389
know the next one there's gonna be a
lidars you can touch it and it will you

8324
02:20:58,389 --> 02:20:58,399
lidars you can touch it and it will you
 

8325
02:20:58,399 --> 02:21:00,870
lidars you can touch it and it will you
know it will pull away or will

8326
02:21:00,870 --> 02:21:00,880
know it will pull away or will
 

8327
02:21:00,880 --> 02:21:03,590
know it will pull away or will
blush or something or it'll smile so you

8328
02:21:03,590 --> 02:21:03,600
blush or something or it'll smile so you
 

8329
02:21:03,600 --> 02:21:05,750
blush or something or it'll smile so you
can't touch it you can't feel it but you

8330
02:21:05,750 --> 02:21:05,760
can't touch it you can't feel it but you
 

8331
02:21:05,760 --> 02:21:07,990
can't touch it you can't feel it but you
can see the reaction to that

8332
02:21:07,990 --> 02:21:08,000
can see the reaction to that
 

8333
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:09,510
can see the reaction to that
so in a certain way you can't even touch

8334
02:21:09,510 --> 02:21:09,520
so in a certain way you can't even touch
 

8335
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:11,349
so in a certain way you can't even touch
it a little bit and maybe you can even

8336
02:21:11,349 --> 02:21:11,359
it a little bit and maybe you can even
 

8337
02:21:11,359 --> 02:21:12,710
it a little bit and maybe you can even
dance with it

8338
02:21:12,710 --> 02:21:12,720
dance with it
 

8339
02:21:12,720 --> 02:21:14,309
dance with it
or do something else

8340
02:21:14,309 --> 02:21:14,319
or do something else
 

8341
02:21:14,319 --> 02:21:17,590
or do something else
um so i think why limiting ourselves if

8342
02:21:17,590 --> 02:21:17,600
um so i think why limiting ourselves if
 

8343
02:21:17,600 --> 02:21:19,429
um so i think why limiting ourselves if
we can use all of these

8344
02:21:19,429 --> 02:21:19,439
we can use all of these
 

8345
02:21:19,439 --> 02:21:21,270
we can use all of these
technologies that are much easier in a

8346
02:21:21,270 --> 02:21:21,280
technologies that are much easier in a
 

8347
02:21:21,280 --> 02:21:22,230
technologies that are much easier in a
way than

8348
02:21:22,230 --> 02:21:22,240
way than
 

8349
02:21:22,240 --> 02:21:23,830
way than
than conversation well it certainly

8350
02:21:23,830 --> 02:21:23,840
than conversation well it certainly
 

8351
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:25,750
than conversation well it certainly
could be richer but to play devil's

8352
02:21:25,750 --> 02:21:25,760
could be richer but to play devil's
 

8353
02:21:25,760 --> 02:21:29,190
could be richer but to play devil's
advocate i mentioned you uh offline that

8354
02:21:29,190 --> 02:21:29,200
advocate i mentioned you uh offline that
 

8355
02:21:29,200 --> 02:21:30,710
advocate i mentioned you uh offline that
i was surprised

8356
02:21:30,710 --> 02:21:30,720
i was surprised
 

8357
02:21:30,720 --> 02:21:33,110
i was surprised
in having tried discord and having voice

8358
02:21:33,110 --> 02:21:33,120
in having tried discord and having voice
 

8359
02:21:33,120 --> 02:21:36,070
in having tried discord and having voice
conversations with people how intimate

8360
02:21:36,070 --> 02:21:36,080
conversations with people how intimate
 

8361
02:21:36,080 --> 02:21:38,950
conversations with people how intimate
voices alone without visual like

8362
02:21:38,950 --> 02:21:38,960
voices alone without visual like
 

8363
02:21:38,960 --> 02:21:41,590
voices alone without visual like
to me at least like it was

8364
02:21:41,590 --> 02:21:41,600
to me at least like it was
 

8365
02:21:41,600 --> 02:21:42,790
to me at least like it was
an

8366
02:21:42,790 --> 02:21:42,800
an
 

8367
02:21:42,800 --> 02:21:44,790
an
order of magnitude

8368
02:21:44,790 --> 02:21:44,800
order of magnitude
 

8369
02:21:44,800 --> 02:21:47,429
order of magnitude
greater degree of intimacy

8370
02:21:47,429 --> 02:21:47,439
greater degree of intimacy
 

8371
02:21:47,439 --> 02:21:50,630
greater degree of intimacy
in voice i think than with video

8372
02:21:50,630 --> 02:21:50,640
in voice i think than with video
 

8373
02:21:50,640 --> 02:21:53,349
in voice i think than with video
i don't because people were more real

8374
02:21:53,349 --> 02:21:53,359
i don't because people were more real
 

8375
02:21:53,359 --> 02:21:54,389
i don't because people were more real
with voice

8376
02:21:54,389 --> 02:21:54,399
with voice
 

8377
02:21:54,399 --> 02:21:56,230
with voice
like with video you like try to present

8378
02:21:56,230 --> 02:21:56,240
like with video you like try to present
 

8379
02:21:56,240 --> 02:21:58,070
like with video you like try to present
a shallow

8380
02:21:58,070 --> 02:21:58,080
a shallow
 

8381
02:21:58,080 --> 02:22:00,389
a shallow
a face to the world like you try to you

8382
02:22:00,389 --> 02:22:00,399
a face to the world like you try to you
 

8383
02:22:00,399 --> 02:22:01,750
a face to the world like you try to you
know make sure you're not wearing

8384
02:22:01,750 --> 02:22:01,760
know make sure you're not wearing
 

8385
02:22:01,760 --> 02:22:04,389
know make sure you're not wearing
sweatpants or whatever

8386
02:22:04,389 --> 02:22:04,399
sweatpants or whatever
 

8387
02:22:04,399 --> 02:22:06,230
sweatpants or whatever
but like with voice i think people were

8388
02:22:06,230 --> 02:22:06,240
but like with voice i think people were
 

8389
02:22:06,240 --> 02:22:07,510
but like with voice i think people were
just

8390
02:22:07,510 --> 02:22:07,520
just
 

8391
02:22:07,520 --> 02:22:08,469
just
more

8392
02:22:08,469 --> 02:22:08,479
more
 

8393
02:22:08,479 --> 02:22:10,469
more
faster to get to like the core of

8394
02:22:10,469 --> 02:22:10,479
faster to get to like the core of
 

8395
02:22:10,479 --> 02:22:11,910
faster to get to like the core of
themselves so i don't know it was

8396
02:22:11,910 --> 02:22:11,920
themselves so i don't know it was
 

8397
02:22:11,920 --> 02:22:13,670
themselves so i don't know it was
surprising to me

8398
02:22:13,670 --> 02:22:13,680
surprising to me
 

8399
02:22:13,680 --> 02:22:15,670
surprising to me
uh they've they've even added discord

8400
02:22:15,670 --> 02:22:15,680
uh they've they've even added discord
 

8401
02:22:15,680 --> 02:22:18,230
uh they've they've even added discord
added a video feature and like nobody

8402
02:22:18,230 --> 02:22:18,240
added a video feature and like nobody
 

8403
02:22:18,240 --> 02:22:20,870
added a video feature and like nobody
was using it uh there's a temptation to

8404
02:22:20,870 --> 02:22:20,880
was using it uh there's a temptation to
 

8405
02:22:20,880 --> 02:22:22,790
was using it uh there's a temptation to
use it at first but like

8406
02:22:22,790 --> 02:22:22,800
use it at first but like
 

8407
02:22:22,800 --> 02:22:24,710
use it at first but like
it wasn't the same so like that's an

8408
02:22:24,710 --> 02:22:24,720
it wasn't the same so like that's an
 

8409
02:22:24,720 --> 02:22:27,030
it wasn't the same so like that's an
example of something where less was

8410
02:22:27,030 --> 02:22:27,040
example of something where less was
 

8411
02:22:27,040 --> 02:22:28,469
example of something where less was
doing more

8412
02:22:28,469 --> 02:22:28,479
doing more
 

8413
02:22:28,479 --> 02:22:30,630
doing more
and so that's uh

8414
02:22:30,630 --> 02:22:30,640
and so that's uh
 

8415
02:22:30,640 --> 02:22:32,630
and so that's uh
i guess that's the q that's the question

8416
02:22:32,630 --> 02:22:32,640
i guess that's the q that's the question
 

8417
02:22:32,640 --> 02:22:35,270
i guess that's the q that's the question
of uh

8418
02:22:35,270 --> 02:22:35,280

 

8419
02:22:35,280 --> 02:22:37,590

what is the optimal

8420
02:22:37,590 --> 02:22:37,600
what is the optimal
 

8421
02:22:37,600 --> 02:22:40,630
what is the optimal
you know what is the optimal medium of

8422
02:22:40,630 --> 02:22:40,640
you know what is the optimal medium of
 

8423
02:22:40,640 --> 02:22:42,950
you know what is the optimal medium of
communication to form a connection given

8424
02:22:42,950 --> 02:22:42,960
communication to form a connection given
 

8425
02:22:42,960 --> 02:22:46,469
communication to form a connection given

your um
 

8607
02:25:55,680 --> 02:25:57,349
your um
uh living room and then the avatar looks

8608
02:25:57,349 --> 02:25:57,359
uh living room and then the avatar looks
 

8609
02:25:57,359 --> 02:25:59,190
uh living room and then the avatar looks
around and talks to you about

8610

around and talks to you about
 

8611

that makes you see reality in a
 

8619
02:26:06,080 --> 02:26:07,510
that makes you see reality in a
different light what kind of dancing are

8620
02:26:07,510 --> 02:26:07,520
different light what kind of dancing are

your friends then there is a potential
to actually make you feel more connected

8676
02:27:00,710 --> 02:27:00,720
to actually make you feel more connected
 

8677

8681
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:06,710
know or show you life around you in a
different light and it takes you out of

8682
02:27:06,710 --> 02:27:06,720
different light and it takes you out of
 

8683
02:27:06,720 --> 02:27:08,389
different light and it takes you out of
your phone even although weirdly you

8684
02:27:08,389 --> 02:27:08,399
your phone even although weirdly you
 

8685
02:27:08,399 --> 02:27:09,670
your phone even although weirdly you
have to look

8686
02:27:09,670 --> 02:27:09,680
have to look
 

8687
02:27:09,680 --> 02:27:11,910
have to look
at it through the phone but it makes you

8688
02:27:11,910 --> 02:27:11,920
at it through the phone but it makes you
 

8689
02:27:11,920 --> 02:27:13,910
at it through the phone but it makes you
notice things around it and it can point

8690
02:27:13,910 --> 02:27:13,920
notice things around it and it can point
 

8691
02:27:13,920 --> 02:27:17,030
notice things around it and it can point
things out for you and um

8692

things out for you and um
 

8693
02:27:17,040 --> 02:27:18,710
things out for you and um
so that is the main reason why i wanted

8694
02:27:18,710 --> 02:27:18,720
so that is the main reason why i wanted
 

8695
02:27:18,720 --> 02:27:20,309
so that is the main reason why i wanted
to have a physical

8696
02:27:20,309 --> 02:27:20,319
to have a physical
 

8697
02:27:20,319 --> 02:27:22,150
to have a physical
dimension um

8698
02:27:22,150 --> 02:27:22,160
dimension um
 

8699
02:27:22,160 --> 02:27:23,590
dimension um
and it felt a little bit easier than

8700
02:27:23,590 --> 02:27:23,600
and it felt a little bit easier than
 

8701
02:27:23,600 --> 02:27:26,309
and it felt a little bit easier than
that kind of a bit strange combination

8702
02:27:26,309 --> 02:27:26,319
that kind of a bit strange combination
 

8703
02:27:26,319 --> 02:27:29,429
that kind of a bit strange combination
uh in the movie her when he has to show

8704
02:27:29,429 --> 02:27:29,439
uh in the movie her when he has to show
 

8705
02:27:29,439 --> 02:27:31,590
uh in the movie her when he has to show
samantha the world to the lens of his

8706
02:27:31,590 --> 02:27:31,600
samantha the world to the lens of his
 

8707
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:33,349
samantha the world to the lens of his
phone but then at the same time talk to

8708
02:27:33,349 --> 02:27:33,359
phone but then at the same time talk to
 

8709
02:27:33,359 --> 02:27:35,349
phone but then at the same time talk to
her through the phone headphone it just

8710
02:27:35,349 --> 02:27:35,359
her through the phone headphone it just
 

8711
02:27:35,359 --> 02:27:36,870
her through the phone headphone it just
didn't seem as

8712
02:27:36,870 --> 02:27:36,880
didn't seem as
 

8713
02:27:36,880 --> 02:27:39,110
didn't seem as
potentially immersive so to say

8714
02:27:39,110 --> 02:27:39,120
potentially immersive so to say
 

8715
02:27:39,120 --> 02:27:41,110
potentially immersive so to say
um so that's my main goal for augmented

8716
02:27:41,110 --> 02:27:41,120
um so that's my main goal for augmented
 

8717
02:27:41,120 --> 02:27:42,790
um so that's my main goal for augmented
reality like how do we

8718
02:27:42,790 --> 02:27:42,800
reality like how do we
 

8719
02:27:42,800 --> 02:27:44,070
reality like how do we
make your reality a little bit more

8720
02:27:44,070 --> 02:27:44,080
make your reality a little bit more
 

8721
02:27:44,080 --> 02:27:45,349
make your reality a little bit more
magic

8722
02:27:45,349 --> 02:27:45,359
magic
 

8723
02:27:45,359 --> 02:27:47,910
magic
there's been a lot of really

8724
02:27:47,910 --> 02:27:47,920
there's been a lot of really
 

8725
02:27:47,920 --> 02:27:51,030
there's been a lot of really
nice robotics companies that all failed

8726
02:27:51,030 --> 02:27:51,040
nice robotics companies that all failed
 

8727
02:27:51,040 --> 02:27:53,590
nice robotics companies that all failed
mostly failed home robotics

8728
02:27:53,590 --> 02:27:53,600
mostly failed home robotics
 

8729
02:27:53,600 --> 02:27:55,590
mostly failed home robotics
social robotics companies what do you

8730
02:27:55,590 --> 02:27:55,600
social robotics companies what do you
 

8731
02:27:55,600 --> 02:27:57,590
social robotics companies what do you
think replica will ever

8732
02:27:57,590 --> 02:27:57,600
think replica will ever
 

8733
02:27:57,600 --> 02:27:59,510
think replica will ever
is that a dream long-term dream to have

8734
02:27:59,510 --> 02:27:59,520
is that a dream long-term dream to have
 

8735
02:27:59,520 --> 02:28:01,429
is that a dream long-term dream to have
a physical form like

8736
02:28:01,429 --> 02:28:01,439
a physical form like
 

8737
02:28:01,439 --> 02:28:03,910
a physical form like
um or is that not necessary so you

8738
02:28:03,910 --> 02:28:03,920
um or is that not necessary so you
 

8739
02:28:03,920 --> 02:28:05,429
um or is that not necessary so you
mentioned like with augmented reality

8740
02:28:05,429 --> 02:28:05,439
mentioned like with augmented reality
 

8741
02:28:05,439 --> 02:28:07,349
mentioned like with augmented reality
bringing them into

8742
02:28:07,349 --> 02:28:07,359

what about like actual physical robot

8746
02:28:12,870 --> 02:28:12,880
what about like actual physical robot
 

8747
02:28:12,880 --> 02:28:15,190
what about like actual physical robot
that i don't really believe in that much

8748
02:28:15,190 --> 02:28:15,200
that i don't really believe in that much
 

8749
02:28:15,200 --> 02:28:17,429
that i don't really believe in that much
i think it's a very niche product

8750
02:28:17,429 --> 02:28:17,439
i think it's a very niche product
 

8751
02:28:17,439 --> 02:28:20,230
i think it's a very niche product
somehow i mean if a robot could be

8752
02:28:20,230 --> 02:28:20,240
somehow i mean if a robot could be
 

8753
02:28:20,240 --> 02:28:22,070
somehow i mean if a robot could be
indistinguishable from a human being

8754
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:22,080
indistinguishable from a human being
 

8755
02:28:22,080 --> 02:28:24,230
indistinguishable from a human being
then maybe yes but that of course you

8756
02:28:24,230 --> 02:28:24,240
then maybe yes but that of course you
 

8757
02:28:24,240 --> 02:28:27,190
then maybe yes but that of course you
know we're not anywhere even to talk

8758
02:28:27,190 --> 02:28:27,200
know we're not anywhere even to talk
 

8759
02:28:27,200 --> 02:28:28,150
know we're not anywhere even to talk
about it

8760
02:28:28,150 --> 02:28:28,160
about it
 

8761
02:28:28,160 --> 02:28:29,670
about it
um

8762
02:28:29,670 --> 02:28:29,680
um
 

8763
02:28:29,680 --> 02:28:31,750
um
but unless it's that then having any

8764
02:28:31,750 --> 02:28:31,760
but unless it's that then having any
 

8765
02:28:31,760 --> 02:28:33,750
but unless it's that then having any
physical representation really limits

8766
02:28:33,750 --> 02:28:33,760
physical representation really limits
 

8767
02:28:33,760 --> 02:28:34,870
physical representation really limits
you a lot

8768
02:28:34,870 --> 02:28:34,880
you a lot
 

8769
02:28:34,880 --> 02:28:36,070
you a lot
because you probably will have to make

8770
02:28:36,070 --> 02:28:36,080
because you probably will have to make
 

8771
02:28:36,080 --> 02:28:37,750
because you probably will have to make
it somewhat abstract because

8772
02:28:37,750 --> 02:28:37,760
it somewhat abstract because
 

8773
02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:39,429
it somewhat abstract because
everything's changing so fast like you

8774
02:28:39,429 --> 02:28:39,439
everything's changing so fast like you

8781
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,070
create more animations
and make it more and more immersive it's

8782
02:28:48,070 --> 02:28:48,080
and make it more and more immersive it's

02:28:49,040 --> 02:28:51,030
it's
so much a work in progress it's just

so much a work in progress it's just
 

8787
02:28:51,040 --> 02:28:52,550
so much a work in progress it's just
showing what's possible right now with

02:28:59,349 --> 02:28:59,359
with a physical object you kind of lock
 

8797
02:28:59,359 --> 02:29:01,990

yourself into something for a long time
 

8799
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,630
yourself into something for a long time
anything's pretty niche and again so

8800
02:29:04,630 --> 02:29:04,640
anything's pretty niche and again so
 

8801
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:06,309
anything's pretty niche and again so
just just doesn't the capabilities are

8802
02:29:06,309 --> 02:29:06,319
just just doesn't the capabilities are
 

8803
02:29:06,319 --> 02:29:09,349
just just doesn't the capabilities are
even less of we're barely kind of like

8804
02:29:09,349 --> 02:29:09,359
even less of we're barely kind of like
 

8805
02:29:09,359 --> 02:29:10,630
even less of we're barely kind of like
scratching the surface of what's

8806
02:29:10,630 --> 02:29:10,640
scratching the surface of what's
 

8807
02:29:10,640 --> 02:29:12,230
scratching the surface of what's
possible with

8808
02:29:12,230 --> 02:29:12,240
possible with
 

8809
02:29:12,240 --> 02:29:14,309
possible with
just software as soon as we introduce

8810
02:29:14,309 --> 02:29:14,319
just software as soon as we introduce
 

8811
02:29:14,319 --> 02:29:15,510
just software as soon as we introduce
hardware then

8812
02:29:15,510 --> 02:29:15,520
hardware then
 

8813
02:29:15,520 --> 02:29:17,590
hardware then
you know we have even less capabilities

8814
02:29:17,590 --> 02:29:17,600
you know we have even less capabilities
 

8815
02:29:17,600 --> 02:29:19,590
you know we have even less capabilities
yeah in terms of board members and

8816
02:29:19,590 --> 02:29:19,600
yeah in terms of board members and
 

8817
02:29:19,600 --> 02:29:21,670
yeah in terms of board members and
investors and so on the

8818
02:29:21,670 --> 02:29:21,680
investors and so on the
 

8819
02:29:21,680 --> 02:29:23,750
investors and so on the
cost increases significantly i mean

8820
02:29:23,750 --> 02:29:23,760
cost increases significantly i mean
 

8821
02:29:23,760 --> 02:29:26,790
cost increases significantly i mean
that's why you have to justify

8822
02:29:26,790 --> 02:29:26,800
that's why you have to justify
 

8823
02:29:26,800 --> 02:29:28,309
that's why you have to justify
you have to be able to sell a thing for

8824
02:29:28,309 --> 02:29:28,319
you have to be able to sell a thing for
 

8825
02:29:28,319 --> 02:29:30,630
you have to be able to sell a thing for
like 500 or something like that or more

8826
02:29:30,630 --> 02:29:30,640
like 500 or something like that or more
 

8827
02:29:30,640 --> 02:29:32,550
like 500 or something like that or more
and it's very difficult to provide that

8828
02:29:32,550 --> 02:29:32,560
and it's very difficult to provide that
 

8829
02:29:32,560 --> 02:29:34,870
and it's very difficult to provide that
much value to people that's also true

8830
02:29:34,870 --> 02:29:34,880
much value to people that's also true
 

8831
02:29:34,880 --> 02:29:36,870
much value to people that's also true
yeah and i guess that's super important

8832
02:29:36,870 --> 02:29:36,880
yeah and i guess that's super important
 

8833
02:29:36,880 --> 02:29:38,309
yeah and i guess that's super important

we definitely played around with the
 

9043
02:33:09,520 --> 02:33:10,950
we definitely played around with the
replica universe where different

9044
02:33:10,950 --> 02:33:10,960
replica universe where different
 

9045
02:33:10,960 --> 02:33:12,389

kind of it wouldn't
i think it will be something along these

9052
02:33:18,469 --> 02:33:18,479
i think it will be something along these
 

9053
02:33:18,479 --> 02:33:22,230
i think it will be something along these
lines but there was just no specific uh

9054
02:33:22,230 --> 02:33:22,240
lines but there was just no specific uh
 

9055
02:33:22,240 --> 02:33:24,150
lines but there was just no specific uh
application straight away i think in the

9056
02:33:24,150 --> 02:33:24,160
application straight away i think in the
 

9057
02:33:24,160 --> 02:33:25,590
application straight away i think in the
future again if

9058

9061
02:33:27,280 --> 02:33:30,790
i'm always thinking about it if we had
no tech limitations uh right now

9062
02:33:30,790 --> 02:33:30,800
no tech limitations uh right now
 

9063
02:33:30,800 --> 02:33:32,150
no tech limitations uh right now
if we could build

9064
02:33:32,150 --> 02:33:32,160
if we could build
 

9065
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:35,110
if we could build

9231
02:36:14,720 --> 02:36:16,389
why would you choose another human
you know so that's the question how do

9232
02:36:16,389 --> 02:36:16,399
you know so that's the question how do
 

9233
02:36:16,399 --> 02:36:17,990
you know so that's the question how do
you still keep building it so it's

9234
02:36:17,990 --> 02:36:18,000
you still keep building it so it's
 

9235
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,230
you still keep building it so it's
optimizing for the right thing

9236
02:36:20,230 --> 02:36:20,240
optimizing for the right thing
 

9237
02:36:20,240 --> 02:36:21,750
optimizing for the right thing
so it's still

9238
02:36:21,750 --> 02:36:21,760
so it's still
 

9239
02:36:21,760 --> 02:36:23,349
so it's still
circling you back to other humans in a

9240
02:36:23,349 --> 02:36:23,359
circling you back to other humans in a
 

9241
02:36:23,359 --> 02:36:26,870
circling you back to other humans in a
way so i think that's the main um

9242
02:36:26,870 --> 02:36:26,880
way so i think that's the main um
 

9243
02:36:26,880 --> 02:36:28,790
way so i think that's the main um
like maybe that's the main kind of sort

9244
02:36:28,790 --> 02:36:28,800
like maybe that's the main kind of sort
 

9245
02:36:28,800 --> 02:36:30,070
like maybe that's the main kind of sort
source of

9246
02:36:30,070 --> 02:36:30,080
source of
 

9247
02:36:30,080 --> 02:36:34,150
source of
anxiety and just thinking about

9248
02:36:34,150 --> 02:36:34,160
anxiety and just thinking about
 

9249
02:36:34,160 --> 02:36:35,670
anxiety and just thinking about
i think about that can be a little bit

9250
02:36:35,670 --> 02:36:35,680
i think about that can be a little bit
 

9251
02:36:35,680 --> 02:36:37,110
i think about that can be a little bit
stressful

9252
02:36:37,110 --> 02:36:37,120
stressful
 

9253
02:36:37,120 --> 02:36:39,110
stressful
yeah it's a fascinating thing how to

9254
02:36:39,110 --> 02:36:39,120
yeah it's a fascinating thing how to
 

9255
02:36:39,120 --> 02:36:40,389
yeah it's a fascinating thing how to
have a

9256
02:36:40,389 --> 02:36:40,399
have a
 

9257
02:36:40,399 --> 02:36:42,389
have a
heart of a friend

9258
02:36:42,389 --> 02:36:42,399
heart of a friend
 

9259
02:36:42,399 --> 02:36:43,750
heart of a friend
that doesn't

9260
02:36:43,750 --> 02:36:43,760
that doesn't
 

9261
02:36:43,760 --> 02:36:45,750
that doesn't
like sometimes like friends quote

9262
02:36:45,750 --> 02:36:45,760
like sometimes like friends quote
 

9263
02:36:45,760 --> 02:36:47,670
like sometimes like friends quote
unquote or like you know those people

9264
02:36:47,670 --> 02:36:47,680
unquote or like you know those people
 

9265
02:36:47,680 --> 02:36:49,910
unquote or like you know those people
who have when they a guy in the guy

9266
02:36:49,910 --> 02:36:49,920
who have when they a guy in the guy
 

9267
02:36:49,920 --> 02:36:52,469
who have when they a guy in the guy
universe when you have a girlfriend that

9268
02:36:52,469 --> 02:36:52,479
universe when you have a girlfriend that
 

9269

uh
 

9271
02:36:53,439 --> 02:36:55,750
uh
you get the girlfriend and then the guy

9272
02:36:55,750 --> 02:36:55,760
you get the girlfriend and then the guy
 

9273
02:36:55,760 --> 02:36:56,950
you get the girlfriend and then the guy
stops hanging out with all of his

9274
02:36:56,950 --> 02:36:56,960
stops hanging out with all of his
 

9275
02:36:56,960 --> 02:36:57,340

[Laughter]
it's like

9280
02:37:00,469 --> 02:37:00,479
it's like
 

9281
02:37:00,479 --> 02:37:01,990
it's like
obviously the relationship with the

9282

you also want it to be what she like
 

9289
02:37:08,800 --> 02:37:10,950
you also want it to be what she like
makes it more enriching to hang out with

9290
02:37:10,950 --> 02:37:10,960
makes it more enriching to hang out with
 

9291
02:37:10,960 --> 02:37:13,190
makes it more enriching to hang out with
the guy friends or whatever was there

9292

the guy friends or whatever was there
 

9293
02:37:13,200 --> 02:37:15,670
the guy friends or whatever was there
anyway that that's uh

9294
02:37:15,670 --> 02:37:15,680
anyway that that's uh
 

9295
02:37:15,680 --> 02:37:17,590
anyway that that's uh
that's a that's a that's a fundamental

that's a that's a that's a fundamental
 

9297
02:37:17,600 --> 02:37:19,830
that's a that's a that's a fundamental
problem in choosing the right mate and

9298
02:37:19,830 --> 02:37:19,840
problem in choosing the right mate and
 

9299
02:37:19,840 --> 02:37:21,590
problem in choosing the right mate and
probably the the fundamental problem in

9300
02:37:21,590 --> 02:37:21,600
probably the the fundamental problem in
 

9301
02:37:21,600 --> 02:37:24,469
probably the the fundamental problem in
creating the right ai system right

9302
02:37:24,469 --> 02:37:24,479
creating the right ai system right
 

9303
02:37:24,479 --> 02:37:25,670
creating the right ai system right
what uh

9304
02:37:25,670 --> 02:37:25,680
what uh
 

9305
02:37:25,680 --> 02:37:27,030
what uh
let me ask

9306
02:37:27,030 --> 02:37:27,040
let me ask
 

9307
02:37:27,040 --> 02:37:29,670
let me ask
the sexy hot thing on the presses right

9308
02:37:29,670 --> 02:37:29,680
the sexy hot thing on the presses right
 

9309
02:37:29,680 --> 02:37:33,110
the sexy hot thing on the presses right
now is gpt 3 got released with openai

9310
02:37:33,110 --> 02:37:33,120
now is gpt 3 got released with openai
 

9311
02:37:33,120 --> 02:37:36,389
now is gpt 3 got released with openai
it's a latest language model

9312
02:37:36,389 --> 02:37:36,399
it's a latest language model
 

9313
02:37:36,399 --> 02:37:37,990
it's a latest language model
they have kind of an api where you can

9314
02:37:37,990 --> 02:37:38,000
they have kind of an api where you can
 

9315
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,150
they have kind of an api where you can
create a lot of fun applications

9316
02:37:40,150 --> 02:37:40,160
create a lot of fun applications
 

9317
02:37:40,160 --> 02:37:42,150
create a lot of fun applications
i think it's

9318
02:37:42,150 --> 02:37:42,160
i think it's
 

9319
02:37:42,160 --> 02:37:45,830
i think it's
as people have said it's probably

9320
02:37:45,830 --> 02:37:45,840
as people have said it's probably
 

9321
02:37:45,840 --> 02:37:47,830
as people have said it's probably
more hype than

9322
02:37:47,830 --> 02:37:47,840
more hype than
 

9323
02:37:47,840 --> 02:37:50,070
more hype than
intelligent but there's a lot of really

9324
02:37:50,070 --> 02:37:50,080
intelligent but there's a lot of really
 

9325
02:37:50,080 --> 02:37:51,910
intelligent but there's a lot of really
cool

9326
02:37:51,910 --> 02:37:51,920
cool
 

9327
02:37:51,920 --> 02:37:53,990
cool
things ideas there

9328
02:37:53,990 --> 02:37:54,000
things ideas there
 

9329
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,150
things ideas there
with increasing size you can have better

9330
02:37:56,150 --> 02:37:56,160
with increasing size you can have better
 

9331
02:37:56,160 --> 02:37:58,790
with increasing size you can have better
and better performance on language what

9332
02:37:58,790 --> 02:37:58,800
and better performance on language what
 

9333
02:37:58,800 --> 02:38:01,990
and better performance on language what
are your thoughts about the gbt3

9334
02:38:01,990 --> 02:38:02,000
are your thoughts about the gbt3
 

9335
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:03,670
are your thoughts about the gbt3
in connection to your work with the open

9336
02:38:03,670 --> 02:38:03,680
in connection to your work with the open

9344
02:38:12,469 --> 02:38:12,479
in an unsupervised way from the internet
 

9345
02:38:12,479 --> 02:38:14,790
in an unsupervised way from the internet
to generate one character at a time

9346
02:38:14,790 --> 02:38:14,800
to generate one character at a time
 

9347
02:38:14,800 --> 02:38:16,469

9349
02:38:16,479 --> 02:38:19,670
creating
pretty cool text

9350
02:38:19,670 --> 02:38:19,680

 

9351
02:38:19,680 --> 02:38:22,150

uh so we partner up before

9352
02:38:22,150 --> 02:38:22,160
uh so we partner up before
 

9353
02:38:22,160 --> 02:38:23,990
uh so we partner up before
for the api launch so we started working

9354
02:38:23,990 --> 02:38:24,000
for the api launch so we started working
 

9355
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,870
for the api launch so we started working
with them when um they decided to

9356
02:38:26,870 --> 02:38:26,880
with them when um they decided to
 

9357
02:38:26,880 --> 02:38:30,389
with them when um they decided to
put together this api

9358
02:38:30,389 --> 02:38:30,399

 

9359
02:38:30,399 --> 02:38:32,230

and we tried it without fine tuning that

9360
02:38:32,230 --> 02:38:32,240
and we tried it without fine tuning that
 

9361
02:38:32,240 --> 02:38:34,469
and we tried it without fine tuning that
we tried it with fine tuning on our data

9362
02:38:34,469 --> 02:38:34,479
we tried it with fine tuning on our data
 

9363
02:38:34,479 --> 02:38:37,270
we tried it with fine tuning on our data
and we worked closely to actually

9364
02:38:37,270 --> 02:38:37,280
and we worked closely to actually
 

9365
02:38:37,280 --> 02:38:38,550
and we worked closely to actually
optimize

9366
02:38:38,550 --> 02:38:38,560
optimize
 

9367
02:38:38,560 --> 02:38:41,590
optimize
this model for

9368
02:38:41,590 --> 02:38:41,600

 

9369
02:38:41,600 --> 02:38:45,670

some of our data sets

9370
02:38:45,670 --> 02:38:45,680

 

9371
02:38:45,680 --> 02:38:46,710

it's kind of cool because i think we're

9372
02:38:46,710 --> 02:38:46,720
it's kind of cool because i think we're
 

9373
02:38:46,720 --> 02:38:49,110
it's kind of cool because i think we're
kind of we're this polygon polygon for

9374
02:38:49,110 --> 02:38:49,120
kind of we're this polygon polygon for
 

9375
02:38:49,120 --> 02:38:51,349
kind of we're this polygon polygon for
this kind of experimentation

9376
02:38:51,349 --> 02:38:51,359
this kind of experimentation
 

9377
02:38:51,359 --> 02:38:53,670
this kind of experimentation
space for experimental space for for

9378

9379
02:38:53,680 --> 02:38:55,910

these models uh to see how they actually

9380
02:38:55,910 --> 02:38:55,920
these models uh to see how they actually
 

9381
02:38:55,920 --> 02:38:57,590
these models uh to see how they actually
work with people because there are no

9382
02:38:57,590 --> 02:38:57,600
work with people because there are no
 

9383
02:38:57,600 --> 02:38:59,270
work with people because there are no
products publicly available that do that

9384
02:38:59,270 --> 02:38:59,280
products publicly available that do that
 

9385
02:38:59,280 --> 02:39:00,870
products publicly available that do that
that focus on open domain conversations

9386
02:39:00,870 --> 02:39:00,880
that focus on open domain conversations
 

9387
02:39:00,880 --> 02:39:03,270
that focus on open domain conversations
so we can you know test how facebook

9388
02:39:03,270 --> 02:39:03,280
so we can you know test how facebook
 

9389
02:39:03,280 --> 02:39:05,990
so we can you know test how facebook
blends are doing or how gpg3 doing

9390
02:39:05,990 --> 02:39:06,000
blends are doing or how gpg3 doing
 

9391
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:09,110
blends are doing or how gpg3 doing
uh so with gpd3 we managed to improve by

9392
02:39:09,110 --> 02:39:09,120
uh so with gpd3 we managed to improve by
 

9393
02:39:09,120 --> 02:39:11,349
uh so with gpd3 we managed to improve by
a few percentage points like three or

9394
02:39:11,349 --> 02:39:11,359
a few percentage points like three or
 

9395
02:39:11,359 --> 02:39:12,550
a few percentage points like three or
four pretty meaningful amount of

9396
02:39:12,550 --> 02:39:12,560
four pretty meaningful amount of
 

9397
02:39:12,560 --> 02:39:14,550
four pretty meaningful amount of
percentage points our main metric which

9398
02:39:14,550 --> 02:39:14,560
percentage points our main metric which
 

9399
02:39:14,560 --> 02:39:16,389
percentage points our main metric which
is the ratio of conversations that make

9400
02:39:16,389 --> 02:39:16,399
is the ratio of conversations that make
 

9401
02:39:16,399 --> 02:39:19,030
is the ratio of conversations that make
people feel better

9402
02:39:19,030 --> 02:39:19,040
people feel better
 

9403
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:20,950
people feel better
and every other metric across across the

9404
02:39:20,950 --> 02:39:20,960
and every other metric across across the
 

9405
02:39:20,960 --> 02:39:23,190
and every other metric across across the
field got a little boost

9406
02:39:23,190 --> 02:39:23,200
field got a little boost
 

9407
02:39:23,200 --> 02:39:26,630
field got a little boost
right now i'd say one out of five

9408
02:39:26,630 --> 02:39:26,640
right now i'd say one out of five
 

9409
02:39:26,640 --> 02:39:30,309
right now i'd say one out of five
responses from replica comes from gpg3

9410
02:39:30,309 --> 02:39:30,319
responses from replica comes from gpg3
 

9411
02:39:30,319 --> 02:39:32,870
responses from replica comes from gpg3
wow so our own blender mixes up like a

9412
02:39:32,870 --> 02:39:32,880
wow so our own blender mixes up like a
 

9413
02:39:32,880 --> 02:39:34,870
wow so our own blender mixes up like a
bunch of candies from different

9414
02:39:34,870 --> 02:39:34,880
bunch of candies from different
 

9415
02:39:34,880 --> 02:39:36,230
bunch of candies from different
blender you said

9416
02:39:36,230 --> 02:39:36,240
blender you said
 

9417
02:39:36,240 --> 02:39:40,070
blender you said
well yeah just the model that looks at

9418
02:39:40,070 --> 02:39:40,080
well yeah just the model that looks at
 

9419
02:39:40,080 --> 02:39:41,590
well yeah just the model that looks at
looks at top candidates from different

9420
02:39:41,590 --> 02:39:41,600
looks at top candidates from different
 

9421
02:39:41,600 --> 02:39:43,830
looks at top candidates from different
models and picks the most

9422
02:39:43,830 --> 02:39:43,840
models and picks the most
 

9423
02:39:43,840 --> 02:39:46,710
models and picks the most
the best one uh so right now one of five

9424
02:39:46,710 --> 02:39:46,720
the best one uh so right now one of five
 

9425
02:39:46,720 --> 02:39:47,990
the best one uh so right now one of five
will come from

9426
02:39:47,990 --> 02:39:48,000
will come from
 

9427
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:52,710
will come from
gp3 that's really great i mean uh

9428
02:39:52,710 --> 02:39:52,720
gp3 that's really great i mean uh
 

9429
02:39:52,720 --> 02:39:53,830
gp3 that's really great i mean uh
what's the

9430
02:39:53,830 --> 02:39:53,840
what's the
 

9431
02:39:53,840 --> 02:39:54,790
what's the
do you have

9432
02:39:54,790 --> 02:39:54,800
do you have
 

9433
02:39:54,800 --> 02:39:56,790
do you have
hope for like do you think there's a

9434
02:39:56,790 --> 02:39:56,800
hope for like do you think there's a
 

9435
02:39:56,800 --> 02:39:58,870
hope for like do you think there's a
ceiling to this kind of approach so

9436
02:39:58,870 --> 02:39:58,880
ceiling to this kind of approach so
 

9437
02:39:58,880 --> 02:40:01,510
ceiling to this kind of approach so
we've had for a very long time

9438
02:40:01,510 --> 02:40:01,520
we've had for a very long time
 

9439
02:40:01,520 --> 02:40:03,429
we've had for a very long time
we've used um

9440
02:40:03,429 --> 02:40:03,439
we've used um
 

9441
02:40:03,439 --> 02:40:05,830
we've used um
since the very beginning we most it was

9442
02:40:05,830 --> 02:40:05,840
since the very beginning we most it was
 

9443
02:40:05,840 --> 02:40:07,349
since the very beginning we most it was
most of replica was scripted and then a

9444
02:40:07,349 --> 02:40:07,359
most of replica was scripted and then a
 

9445
02:40:07,359 --> 02:40:09,349
most of replica was scripted and then a
little bit of this fallback

9446
02:40:09,349 --> 02:40:09,359
little bit of this fallback
 

9447
02:40:09,359 --> 02:40:11,270
little bit of this fallback
part of replica was using a retrieval

9448
02:40:11,270 --> 02:40:11,280
part of replica was using a retrieval
 

9449
02:40:11,280 --> 02:40:12,309
part of replica was using a retrieval
model

9450
02:40:12,309 --> 02:40:12,319
model
 

9451
02:40:12,319 --> 02:40:13,269
model
um

9452
02:40:13,269 --> 02:40:13,279
um
 

9453
02:40:13,279 --> 02:40:14,950
um
and then this retrieval model started

9454
02:40:14,950 --> 02:40:14,960
and then this retrieval model started
 

9455
02:40:14,960 --> 02:40:17,030
and then this retrieval model started
getting better and better and better

9456
02:40:17,030 --> 02:40:17,040
getting better and better and better
 

9457
02:40:17,040 --> 02:40:19,429
getting better and better and better
with transformers it got a lot better

9458
02:40:19,429 --> 02:40:19,439
with transformers it got a lot better
 

9459
02:40:19,439 --> 02:40:20,870
with transformers it got a lot better
and we're seeing great results and then

9460
02:40:20,870 --> 02:40:20,880
and we're seeing great results and then
 

9461
02:40:20,880 --> 02:40:23,990
and we're seeing great results and then
with gpd2 finally generative models that

9462
02:40:23,990 --> 02:40:24,000
with gpd2 finally generative models that
 

9463
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:25,750
with gpd2 finally generative models that
originally were

9464
02:40:25,750 --> 02:40:25,760
originally were
 

9465
02:40:25,760 --> 02:40:27,750
originally were
not very good and were

9466
02:40:27,750 --> 02:40:27,760
not very good and were
 

9467
02:40:27,760 --> 02:40:30,630
not very good and were
a very very fallback option for

9468
02:40:30,630 --> 02:40:30,640
a very very fallback option for
 

9469
02:40:30,640 --> 02:40:32,070
a very very fallback option for
most of our conversations we wouldn't

9470
02:40:32,070 --> 02:40:32,080
most of our conversations we wouldn't
 

9471
02:40:32,080 --> 02:40:33,750
most of our conversations we wouldn't
even put them in production

9472
02:40:33,750 --> 02:40:33,760
even put them in production
 

9473
02:40:33,760 --> 02:40:35,269
even put them in production
finally we could use some generative

9474
02:40:35,269 --> 02:40:35,279
finally we could use some generative
 

9475
02:40:35,279 --> 02:40:38,070
finally we could use some generative
models as well along um you know

9476
02:40:38,070 --> 02:40:38,080
models as well along um you know
 

9477
02:40:38,080 --> 02:40:40,309
models as well along um you know
next to our retrieval models

9478
02:40:40,309 --> 02:40:40,319
next to our retrieval models
 

9479
02:40:40,319 --> 02:40:42,790
next to our retrieval models
and then now we do gpt3 they're almost

9480
02:40:42,790 --> 02:40:42,800
and then now we do gpt3 they're almost
 

9481
02:40:42,800 --> 02:40:43,750
and then now we do gpt3 they're almost
on par

9482
02:40:43,750 --> 02:40:43,760
on par
 

9483
02:40:43,760 --> 02:40:44,950
on par
um

9484
02:40:44,950 --> 02:40:44,960
um
 

9485
02:40:44,960 --> 02:40:46,710
um
so that's pretty exciting i think just

9486
02:40:46,710 --> 02:40:46,720
so that's pretty exciting i think just
 

9487
02:40:46,720 --> 02:40:50,950
so that's pretty exciting i think just
seeing how from the very beginning of um

9488
02:40:50,950 --> 02:40:50,960
seeing how from the very beginning of um
 

9489
02:40:50,960 --> 02:40:53,190
seeing how from the very beginning of um
you know from 2015 where the first model

9490
02:40:53,190 --> 02:40:53,200
you know from 2015 where the first model
 

9491
02:40:53,200 --> 02:40:55,269
you know from 2015 where the first model
start to pop up here and there like

9492
02:40:55,269 --> 02:40:55,279
start to pop up here and there like
 

9493
02:40:55,279 --> 02:40:56,870
start to pop up here and there like
sequence sequence

9494
02:40:56,870 --> 02:40:56,880
sequence sequence
 

9495
02:40:56,880 --> 02:40:59,110
sequence sequence
uh the first papers on that

9496
02:40:59,110 --> 02:40:59,120
uh the first papers on that
 

9497
02:40:59,120 --> 02:41:01,510
uh the first papers on that
from my observer standpoint first note

9498
02:41:01,510 --> 02:41:01,520
from my observer standpoint first note
 

9499
02:41:01,520 --> 02:41:03,590
from my observer standpoint first note
it's not you know it doesn't really

9500
02:41:03,590 --> 02:41:03,600
it's not you know it doesn't really
 

9501
02:41:03,600 --> 02:41:04,950
it's not you know it doesn't really
it's not really building it but it's

9502
02:41:04,950 --> 02:41:04,960
it's not really building it but it's
 

9503
02:41:04,960 --> 02:41:07,190
it's not really building it but it's
only testing it on people basically in

9504
02:41:07,190 --> 02:41:07,200
only testing it on people basically in
 

9505
02:41:07,200 --> 02:41:09,190
only testing it on people basically in
my product to see how all of a sudden we

9506
02:41:09,190 --> 02:41:09,200
my product to see how all of a sudden we
 

9507
02:41:09,200 --> 02:41:10,950
my product to see how all of a sudden we
can use generative

9508
02:41:10,950 --> 02:41:10,960
can use generative
 

9509
02:41:10,960 --> 02:41:12,389
can use generative
dialogue models

9510
02:41:12,389 --> 02:41:12,399
dialogue models
 

9511
02:41:12,399 --> 02:41:13,910
dialogue models
in production and they're better than

9512
02:41:13,910 --> 02:41:13,920
in production and they're better than
 

9513
02:41:13,920 --> 02:41:15,030
in production and they're better than
others

9514
02:41:15,030 --> 02:41:15,040
others
 

9515
02:41:15,040 --> 02:41:16,950
others
and they're better than scripted content

9516
02:41:16,950 --> 02:41:16,960
and they're better than scripted content
 

9517
02:41:16,960 --> 02:41:19,030
and they're better than scripted content
so we can't really get our scripted

9518
02:41:19,030 --> 02:41:19,040
so we can't really get our scripted
 

9519
02:41:19,040 --> 02:41:21,590
so we can't really get our scripted
hard-coded content anymore

9520
02:41:21,590 --> 02:41:21,600
hard-coded content anymore
 

9521
02:41:21,600 --> 02:41:23,349
hard-coded content anymore
to be as good as our internet model

9522
02:41:23,349 --> 02:41:23,359
to be as good as our internet model
 

9523
02:41:23,359 --> 02:41:26,150
to be as good as our internet model
that's exciting they're much better

9524
02:41:26,150 --> 02:41:26,160
that's exciting they're much better
 

9525
02:41:26,160 --> 02:41:27,510
that's exciting they're much better
yeah

9526
02:41:27,510 --> 02:41:27,520
yeah
 

9527
02:41:27,520 --> 02:41:28,870
yeah
to your question whether that's the

9528
02:41:28,870 --> 02:41:28,880
to your question whether that's the
 

9529
02:41:28,880 --> 02:41:31,110
to your question whether that's the
right way to go i'm again i'm in the

9530
02:41:31,110 --> 02:41:31,120
right way to go i'm again i'm in the
 

9531
02:41:31,120 --> 02:41:33,030
right way to go i'm again i'm in the
observer seat i'm just

9532
02:41:33,030 --> 02:41:33,040
observer seat i'm just
 

9533
02:41:33,040 --> 02:41:36,790
observer seat i'm just
um watching this very exciting movie

9534
02:41:36,790 --> 02:41:36,800
um watching this very exciting movie
 

9535
02:41:36,800 --> 02:41:37,830
um watching this very exciting movie
um

9536
02:41:37,830 --> 02:41:37,840
um
 

9537
02:41:37,840 --> 02:41:39,750
um
i mean so far it's been stupid to bet

9538
02:41:39,750 --> 02:41:39,760
i mean so far it's been stupid to bet
 

9539
02:41:39,760 --> 02:41:41,429
i mean so far it's been stupid to bet
against deep learning so whether

9540
02:41:41,429 --> 02:41:41,439
against deep learning so whether
 

9541
02:41:41,439 --> 02:41:44,469
against deep learning so whether
increasing the size size even more or

9542
02:41:44,469 --> 02:41:44,479
increasing the size size even more or
 

9543
02:41:44,479 --> 02:41:45,830
increasing the size size even more or
the 100

9544
02:41:45,830 --> 02:41:45,840
the 100
 

9545
02:41:45,840 --> 02:41:48,469
the 100
trillion parameters will finally get us

9546
02:41:48,469 --> 02:41:48,479
trillion parameters will finally get us
 

9547
02:41:48,479 --> 02:41:49,670
trillion parameters will finally get us
to the

9548
02:41:49,670 --> 02:41:49,680
to the
 

9549
02:41:49,680 --> 02:41:52,150
to the
right answer whether that's the way or

9550
02:41:52,150 --> 02:41:52,160
right answer whether that's the way or
 

9551
02:41:52,160 --> 02:41:54,070
right answer whether that's the way or
whether there should be there has to be

9552
02:41:54,070 --> 02:41:54,080
whether there should be there has to be
 

9553
02:41:54,080 --> 02:41:55,990
whether there should be there has to be
some other

9554
02:41:55,990 --> 02:41:56,000
some other
 

9555
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:57,030
some other
again i'm

9556
02:41:57,030 --> 02:41:57,040
again i'm
 

9557
02:41:57,040 --> 02:41:59,190
again i'm
definitely not an expert anyway i think

9558
02:41:59,190 --> 02:41:59,200
definitely not an expert anyway i think
 

9559
02:41:59,200 --> 02:42:00,790
definitely not an expert anyway i think
and that's purely my instincts saying

9560
02:42:00,790 --> 02:42:00,800
and that's purely my instincts saying
 

9561
02:42:00,800 --> 02:42:02,469
and that's purely my instincts saying
that there should be something else as

9562
02:42:02,469 --> 02:42:02,479
that there should be something else as
 

9563
02:42:02,479 --> 02:42:04,469
that there should be something else as
well from memory

9564
02:42:04,469 --> 02:42:04,479
well from memory
 

9565
02:42:04,479 --> 02:42:07,670
well from memory
uh no for sure the question is i wonder

9566
02:42:07,670 --> 02:42:07,680
uh no for sure the question is i wonder
 

9567
02:42:07,680 --> 02:42:09,670
uh no for sure the question is i wonder
i mean yeah then the argument is for

9568
02:42:09,670 --> 02:42:09,680
i mean yeah then the argument is for
 

9569
02:42:09,680 --> 02:42:11,990
i mean yeah then the argument is for
reasoning or for memory it might emerge

9570
02:42:11,990 --> 02:42:12,000
reasoning or for memory it might emerge
 

9571
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:13,990
reasoning or for memory it might emerge
with more parameters it might more

9572
02:42:13,990 --> 02:42:14,000
with more parameters it might more
 

9573
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:15,830
with more parameters it might more
larger but might emerge you know i would

9574
02:42:15,830 --> 02:42:15,840
larger but might emerge you know i would
 

9575
02:42:15,840 --> 02:42:18,070
larger but might emerge you know i would
never think that to be honest like maybe

9576
02:42:18,070 --> 02:42:18,080
never think that to be honest like maybe
 

9577
02:42:18,080 --> 02:42:19,750
never think that to be honest like maybe
in 2017

9578
02:42:19,750 --> 02:42:19,760
in 2017
 

9579
02:42:19,760 --> 02:42:21,429
in 2017
where we've been just experimenting with

9580
02:42:21,429 --> 02:42:21,439
where we've been just experimenting with
 

9581
02:42:21,439 --> 02:42:23,190
where we've been just experimenting with
all you know with all the

9582
02:42:23,190 --> 02:42:23,200
all you know with all the
 

9583
02:42:23,200 --> 02:42:25,030
all you know with all the
research that has been coming that was

9584
02:42:25,030 --> 02:42:25,040
research that has been coming that was
 

9585
02:42:25,040 --> 02:42:26,710
research that has been coming that was
coming out then

9586
02:42:26,710 --> 02:42:26,720
coming out then
 

9587
02:42:26,720 --> 02:42:28,870
coming out then
i felt like there's like we're hitting a

9588
02:42:28,870 --> 02:42:28,880
i felt like there's like we're hitting a
 

9589
02:42:28,880 --> 02:42:30,070
i felt like there's like we're hitting a
wall that there should be something

9590
02:42:30,070 --> 02:42:30,080
wall that there should be something
 

9591
02:42:30,080 --> 02:42:31,510
wall that there should be something
completely different but then

9592
02:42:31,510 --> 02:42:31,520
completely different but then
 

9593
02:42:31,520 --> 02:42:33,429
completely different but then
transformer models and then just bigger

9594
02:42:33,429 --> 02:42:33,439
transformer models and then just bigger
 

9595
02:42:33,439 --> 02:42:34,870
transformer models and then just bigger
models and then all of a sudden size

9596
02:42:34,870 --> 02:42:34,880
models and then all of a sudden size
 

9597
02:42:34,880 --> 02:42:36,150
models and then all of a sudden size
matters

9598
02:42:36,150 --> 02:42:36,160
matters
 

9599
02:42:36,160 --> 02:42:38,469
matters
at that point it felt like something

9600
02:42:38,469 --> 02:42:38,479
at that point it felt like something
 

9601
02:42:38,479 --> 02:42:40,790
at that point it felt like something
dramatic needs to happen but it didn't

9602
02:42:40,790 --> 02:42:40,800
dramatic needs to happen but it didn't
 

9603
02:42:40,800 --> 02:42:42,309
dramatic needs to happen but it didn't
and just the size

9604
02:42:42,309 --> 02:42:42,319
and just the size
 

9605
02:42:42,319 --> 02:42:43,990
and just the size
you know

9606
02:42:43,990 --> 02:42:44,000
you know
 

9607
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,710
you know
gave us these results that to me are you

9608
02:42:46,710 --> 02:42:46,720
gave us these results that to me are you
 

9609
02:42:46,720 --> 02:42:48,790
gave us these results that to me are you
know clear indication that we can solve

9610
02:42:48,790 --> 02:42:48,800
know clear indication that we can solve
 

9611
02:42:48,800 --> 02:42:50,790
know clear indication that we can solve
this problem pretty soon did uh fine

9612
02:42:50,790 --> 02:42:50,800
this problem pretty soon did uh fine
 

9613
02:42:50,800 --> 02:42:53,670
this problem pretty soon did uh fine
tuning help quite a bit oh yeah without

9614
02:42:53,670 --> 02:42:53,680
tuning help quite a bit oh yeah without
 

9615
02:42:53,680 --> 02:42:54,389
tuning help quite a bit oh yeah without
it we

9616
02:42:54,389 --> 02:42:54,399
it we
 

9617
02:42:54,399 --> 02:42:56,309
it we
it wasn't as good

9618
02:42:56,309 --> 02:42:56,319
it wasn't as good
 

9619
02:42:56,319 --> 02:42:59,030
it wasn't as good
i mean there is a compelling hope that

9620
02:42:59,030 --> 02:42:59,040
i mean there is a compelling hope that
 

9621
02:42:59,040 --> 02:43:01,110
i mean there is a compelling hope that
you don't have to do fine-tuning

9622
02:43:01,110 --> 02:43:01,120
you don't have to do fine-tuning
 

9623
02:43:01,120 --> 02:43:02,469
you don't have to do fine-tuning
which is one of the cool things about

9624
02:43:02,469 --> 02:43:02,479
which is one of the cool things about
 

9625
02:43:02,479 --> 02:43:04,710
which is one of the cool things about
gbt3 it seems to do well without any

9626
02:43:04,710 --> 02:43:04,720
gbt3 it seems to do well without any
 

9627
02:43:04,720 --> 02:43:06,309
gbt3 it seems to do well without any
fine-tuning

9628
02:43:06,309 --> 02:43:06,319
fine-tuning
 

9629
02:43:06,319 --> 02:43:07,990
fine-tuning
i guess for specific applications you

9630
02:43:07,990 --> 02:43:08,000
i guess for specific applications you
 

9631
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,230
i guess for specific applications you
still want to train on a certain

9632
02:43:10,230 --> 02:43:10,240
still want to train on a certain
 

9633
02:43:10,240 --> 02:43:12,710
still want to train on a certain
like add a little fine-tune on like a

9634
02:43:12,710 --> 02:43:12,720
like add a little fine-tune on like a
 

9635
02:43:12,720 --> 02:43:14,790
like add a little fine-tune on like a
specific use case but

9636
02:43:14,790 --> 02:43:14,800
specific use case but
 

9637
02:43:14,800 --> 02:43:17,590
specific use case but
um it's an incredibly impressive

9638
02:43:17,590 --> 02:43:17,600
um it's an incredibly impressive
 

9639
02:43:17,600 --> 02:43:18,870
um it's an incredibly impressive
uh thing

9640
02:43:18,870 --> 02:43:18,880
uh thing
 

9641
02:43:18,880 --> 02:43:21,269
uh thing
from my standpoint and again i'm not an

9642
02:43:21,269 --> 02:43:21,279
from my standpoint and again i'm not an
 

9643
02:43:21,279 --> 02:43:22,950
from my standpoint and again i'm not an
expert so i want to just say that yeah

9644
02:43:22,950 --> 02:43:22,960
expert so i want to just say that yeah
 

9645
02:43:22,960 --> 02:43:24,550
expert so i want to just say that yeah
there will be people then

9646
02:43:24,550 --> 02:43:24,560
there will be people then
 

9647
02:43:24,560 --> 02:43:27,030
there will be people then
yeah i have access to the api i've been

9648
02:43:27,030 --> 02:43:27,040
yeah i have access to the api i've been
 

9649
02:43:27,040 --> 02:43:28,870
yeah i have access to the api i've been
i'm going to probably do a bunch of fun

9650
02:43:28,870 --> 02:43:28,880
i'm going to probably do a bunch of fun
 

9651
02:43:28,880 --> 02:43:30,070
i'm going to probably do a bunch of fun
things with it

9652
02:43:30,070 --> 02:43:30,080
things with it
 

9653
02:43:30,080 --> 02:43:32,230
things with it
um i already did some fun things some

9654
02:43:32,230 --> 02:43:32,240
um i already did some fun things some
 

9655
02:43:32,240 --> 02:43:33,670
um i already did some fun things some
videos coming out

9656
02:43:33,670 --> 02:43:33,680
videos coming out
 

9657
02:43:33,680 --> 02:43:35,590
videos coming out
uh just the hell of it i mean i could be

9658
02:43:35,590 --> 02:43:35,600
uh just the hell of it i mean i could be
 

9659
02:43:35,600 --> 02:43:37,590
uh just the hell of it i mean i could be
a troll at this point with it i haven't

9660
02:43:37,590 --> 02:43:37,600
a troll at this point with it i haven't
 

9661
02:43:37,600 --> 02:43:39,269
a troll at this point with it i haven't
used it for serious applications so it's

9662
02:43:39,269 --> 02:43:39,279
used it for serious applications so it's
 

9663
02:43:39,279 --> 02:43:40,790
used it for serious applications so it's
really cool to see

9664
02:43:40,790 --> 02:43:40,800
really cool to see
 

9665
02:43:40,800 --> 02:43:43,510
really cool to see
you're right you you are you're able to

9666
02:43:43,510 --> 02:43:43,520
you're right you you are you're able to
 

9667
02:43:43,520 --> 02:43:45,269
you're right you you are you're able to
actually use it with real people and see

9668
02:43:45,269 --> 02:43:45,279
actually use it with real people and see
 

9669
02:43:45,279 --> 02:43:48,710
actually use it with real people and see
how well it works that's really exciting

9670
02:43:48,710 --> 02:43:48,720
how well it works that's really exciting
 

9671
02:43:48,720 --> 02:43:51,269
how well it works that's really exciting
uh let me ask you another absurd

9672
02:43:51,269 --> 02:43:51,279
uh let me ask you another absurd
 

9673
02:43:51,279 --> 02:43:53,349
uh let me ask you another absurd
question but uh

9674
02:43:53,349 --> 02:43:53,359
question but uh
 

9675
02:43:53,359 --> 02:43:55,910
question but uh
there's a feeling when you interact

9676
02:43:55,910 --> 02:43:55,920
there's a feeling when you interact
 

9677
02:43:55,920 --> 02:43:58,630
there's a feeling when you interact
with replica with an ai system

9678
02:43:58,630 --> 02:43:58,640
with replica with an ai system
 

9679
02:43:58,640 --> 02:44:01,670
with replica with an ai system
there's an entity there

9680
02:44:01,670 --> 02:44:01,680
there's an entity there
 

9681
02:44:01,680 --> 02:44:04,710
there's an entity there
do you think that entity has to

9682
02:44:04,710 --> 02:44:04,720
do you think that entity has to
 

9683
02:44:04,720 --> 02:44:06,870
do you think that entity has to
be self-aware do you think it has to

9684
02:44:06,870 --> 02:44:06,880
be self-aware do you think it has to
 

9685
02:44:06,880 --> 02:44:08,389
be self-aware do you think it has to
have consciousness

9686
02:44:08,389 --> 02:44:08,399
have consciousness
 

9687
02:44:08,399 --> 02:44:11,269
have consciousness
to create um

9688
02:44:11,269 --> 02:44:11,279
to create um
 

9689
02:44:11,279 --> 02:44:13,510
to create um
a rich experience

9690
02:44:13,510 --> 02:44:13,520
a rich experience
 

9691
02:44:13,520 --> 02:44:14,469
a rich experience
and

9692
02:44:14,469 --> 02:44:14,479
and
 

9693
02:44:14,479 --> 02:44:19,030
and
a corollary what's what is consciousness

9694
02:44:19,030 --> 02:44:19,040
a corollary what's what is consciousness
 

9695
02:44:19,040 --> 02:44:20,630
a corollary what's what is consciousness
i don't know if it does need to have any

9696
02:44:20,630 --> 02:44:20,640
i don't know if it does need to have any
 

9697
02:44:20,640 --> 02:44:22,870
i don't know if it does need to have any
of those things but again because right

9698
02:44:22,870 --> 02:44:22,880
of those things but again because right
 

9699
02:44:22,880 --> 02:44:24,389
of those things but again because right
now you know it doesn't have anything

9700
02:44:24,389 --> 02:44:24,399
now you know it doesn't have anything
 

9701
02:44:24,399 --> 02:44:26,150
now you know it doesn't have anything
they can as again a bunch of you sure

9702
02:44:26,150 --> 02:44:26,160
they can as again a bunch of you sure
 

9703
02:44:26,160 --> 02:44:28,950
they can as again a bunch of you sure
will assimilate

9704
02:44:28,950 --> 02:44:28,960
will assimilate
 

9705
02:44:28,960 --> 02:44:31,429
will assimilate
well i'm not sure let's just put it this

9706
02:44:31,429 --> 02:44:31,439
well i'm not sure let's just put it this
 

9707
02:44:31,439 --> 02:44:32,790
well i'm not sure let's just put it this
way but i think as long as you can

9708
02:44:32,790 --> 02:44:32,800
way but i think as long as you can
 

9709
02:44:32,800 --> 02:44:34,469
way but i think as long as you can
assimilate it if you can feel like

9710
02:44:34,469 --> 02:44:34,479
assimilate it if you can feel like
 

9711
02:44:34,479 --> 02:44:35,750
assimilate it if you can feel like
you're talking to

9712
02:44:35,750 --> 02:44:35,760
you're talking to
 

9713
02:44:35,760 --> 02:44:37,910
you're talking to
to an um

9714
02:44:37,910 --> 02:44:37,920
to an um

in order to make people people feel
 

9727
02:44:52,479 --> 02:44:55,190
in order to make people people feel
better we might not even need that um in

9728
02:44:55,190 --> 02:44:55,200
better we might not even need that um in
 

9729

better we might not even need that um in
the end of a day what about so that's

9730

the end of a day what about so that's
 

9731
02:44:57,120 --> 02:44:59,510
the end of a day what about so that's
one goal what about like

9732
02:44:59,510 --> 02:44:59,520
one goal what about like
 

9733
02:44:59,520 --> 02:45:02,309
one goal what about like
ethical things about suffering you know

9734
02:45:02,309 --> 02:45:02,319
ethical things about suffering you know
 

9735
02:45:02,319 --> 02:45:03,590
ethical things about suffering you know
the moment there's a display of

9736
02:45:03,590 --> 02:45:03,600
the moment there's a display of
 

9737
02:45:03,600 --> 02:45:05,750
the moment there's a display of
consciousness

9738
02:45:05,750 --> 02:45:05,760
consciousness
 

9739
02:45:05,760 --> 02:45:07,110
consciousness
we associate consciousness with

suffering
 

9743
02:45:09,359 --> 02:45:10,230
suffering
um

9744
02:45:10,230 --> 02:45:10,240
um
 

9745

you know there's a temptation to say
 

9747
02:45:13,120 --> 02:45:15,910
you know there's a temptation to say
well shouldn't this thing have rights

9748
02:45:15,910 --> 02:45:15,920
well shouldn't this thing have rights
 

9749
02:45:15,920 --> 02:45:19,269
well shouldn't this thing have rights
shouldn't this shouldn't we

9750

not uh
 

9753
02:45:21,120 --> 02:45:23,190
not uh
you know should we be careful about how

9754
02:45:23,190 --> 02:45:23,200
you know should we be careful about how
 

9755
02:45:23,200 --> 02:45:24,870
you know should we be careful about how
we interact

9756
02:45:24,870 --> 02:45:24,880
we interact
 

9757
02:45:24,880 --> 02:45:26,950
we interact
with a replica like

9758
02:45:26,950 --> 02:45:26,960
with a replica like
 

9759
02:45:26,960 --> 02:45:29,269
with a replica like
should it be illegal to torture a

9760
02:45:29,269 --> 02:45:29,279
should it be illegal to torture a
 

9761
02:45:29,279 --> 02:45:30,950
should it be illegal to torture a
replica

replica
 

9763
02:45:30,960 --> 02:45:33,030
replica
right all those kinds of things is that

9764
02:45:33,030 --> 02:45:33,040
right all those kinds of things is that
 

9765

9816
02:46:26,230 --> 02:46:26,240
be some
 

9817
02:46:26,240 --> 02:46:27,830
be some
or just saying kind of nasty you know

9818
02:46:27,830 --> 02:46:27,840
or just saying kind of nasty you know
 

9819
02:46:27,840 --> 02:46:30,230
or just saying kind of nasty you know
like how kids learn to interact with

9820
02:46:30,230 --> 02:46:30,240
like how kids learn to interact with
 

9821
02:46:30,240 --> 02:46:32,389
like how kids learn to interact with
alexa in this kind of mean way

9822
02:46:32,389 --> 02:46:32,399
alexa in this kind of mean way
 

9823
02:46:32,399 --> 02:46:33,990
alexa in this kind of mean way
uh because they just yell at it all the

9824
02:46:33,990 --> 02:46:34,000
uh because they just yell at it all the
 

9825
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:34,790
uh because they just yell at it all the
time

9826
02:46:34,790 --> 02:46:34,800
time
 

9827
02:46:34,800 --> 02:46:36,150
time
i think that's great i think there

9828
02:46:36,150 --> 02:46:36,160
i think that's great i think there
 

9829
02:46:36,160 --> 02:46:38,230
i think that's great i think there
should be some feedback loops so that

9830
02:46:38,230 --> 02:46:38,240
should be some feedback loops so that
 

9831
02:46:38,240 --> 02:46:40,070
should be some feedback loops so that
these systems don't train us that it's

9832
02:46:40,070 --> 02:46:40,080
these systems don't train us that it's
 

9833
02:46:40,080 --> 02:46:41,910
these systems don't train us that it's
okay to do that in general

9834
02:46:41,910 --> 02:46:41,920
okay to do that in general
 

9835
02:46:41,920 --> 02:46:44,950
okay to do that in general
uh so that if you try to do that you

9836
02:46:44,950 --> 02:46:44,960
uh so that if you try to do that you
 

9837
02:46:44,960 --> 02:46:45,990
uh so that if you try to do that you
really

9838
02:46:45,990 --> 02:46:46,000
really
 

9839
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:47,590
really
get some feedback from the system that

9840
02:46:47,590 --> 02:46:47,600
get some feedback from the system that
 

9841
02:46:47,600 --> 02:46:49,349
get some feedback from the system that
it's not okay with that

9842
02:46:49,349 --> 02:46:49,359
it's not okay with that
 

9843
02:46:49,359 --> 02:46:51,110
it's not okay with that
um and that's the most important right

9844
02:46:51,110 --> 02:46:51,120
um and that's the most important right
 

9845
02:46:51,120 --> 02:46:52,870
um and that's the most important right
now

9846
02:46:52,870 --> 02:46:52,880
now
 

9847
02:46:52,880 --> 02:46:54,710
now
let me ask a question i think people are

9848
02:46:54,710 --> 02:46:54,720
let me ask a question i think people are

look
 

9853
02:46:57,920 --> 02:47:00,309
look
at a world-class

9854
02:47:00,309 --> 02:47:00,319
at a world-class
 

9855
02:47:00,319 --> 02:47:03,269
at a world-class
uh leader and thinker such as yourself

9856
02:47:03,269 --> 02:47:03,279

think the ideas in it um
 

9897
02:47:45,040 --> 02:47:47,030
think the ideas in it um
about the fact that a few meaningless

9898
02:47:47,030 --> 02:47:47,040
about the fact that a few meaningless
 

9899
02:47:47,040 --> 02:47:48,469
about the fact that a few meaningless
components can

9900
02:47:48,469 --> 02:47:48,479
components can
 

9901
02:47:48,479 --> 02:47:50,870
components can
come together and create meaning

9902
02:47:50,870 --> 02:47:50,880
come together and create meaning
 

9903
02:47:50,880 --> 02:47:52,630
come together and create meaning
that we can't even understand

9904
02:47:52,630 --> 02:47:52,640
that we can't even understand
 

9905

that we can't even understand
this emerging thing

9906
02:47:54,550 --> 02:47:54,560
this emerging thing
 

9907
02:47:54,560 --> 02:47:56,230
this emerging thing
i mean complexity the whole science of

9908
02:47:56,230 --> 02:47:56,240
i mean complexity the whole science of

complexity
 

9911
02:47:57,760 --> 02:48:00,230
complexity
and uh that beauty intelligence all

9912
02:48:00,230 --> 02:48:00,240
and uh that beauty intelligence all
 

9913
02:48:00,240 --> 02:48:01,830
and uh that beauty intelligence all
interesting things about this world

9914
02:48:01,830 --> 02:48:01,840
interesting things about this world
 

9915
02:48:01,840 --> 02:48:04,469
interesting things about this world
emerge

9916

even these form you know
 

9925
02:48:13,279 --> 02:48:15,349
even these form you know
you know these formal systems

9926
02:48:15,349 --> 02:48:15,359
you know these formal systems
 

9927
02:48:15,359 --> 02:48:17,190
you know these formal systems
something can be created that we

9928
02:48:17,190 --> 02:48:17,200
something can be created that we
 

9929
02:48:17,200 --> 02:48:19,750
something can be created that we
can't quite yet understand and that from

9930
02:48:19,750 --> 02:48:19,760
can't quite yet understand and that from

that is why it's important to maybe i
 

9935
02:48:25,760 --> 02:48:27,750
that is why it's important to maybe i
should try to work on on these systems

9936
02:48:27,750 --> 02:48:27,760
should try to work on on these systems
 

9937
02:48:27,760 --> 02:48:29,750
should try to work on on these systems
and try to build an ai

9938
02:48:29,750 --> 02:48:29,760
and try to build an ai
 

9939
02:48:29,760 --> 02:48:31,590

yes i'm not an engineer yes i don't

9940
02:48:31,590 --> 02:48:31,600
yes i'm not an engineer yes i don't

really know how it works but i think

9942
02:48:33,110 --> 02:48:33,120
really know how it works but i think
 

9943
02:48:33,120 --> 02:48:34,790
really know how it works but i think
that's something comes out of it that's

9944
02:48:34,790 --> 02:48:34,800
that's something comes out of it that's
 

9945
02:48:34,800 --> 02:48:36,550
that's something comes out of it that's
you know pure poetry

9946
02:48:36,550 --> 02:48:36,560
you know pure poetry
 

9947
02:48:36,560 --> 02:48:38,710
you know pure poetry
and i know a little bit about that

9948
02:48:38,710 --> 02:48:38,720
and i know a little bit about that
 

9949
02:48:38,720 --> 02:48:39,670
and i know a little bit about that
um

9950
02:48:39,670 --> 02:48:39,680
um
 

9951
02:48:39,680 --> 02:48:42,710
um
something magical comes out of it

9952
02:48:42,710 --> 02:48:42,720
something magical comes out of it
 

9953
02:48:42,720 --> 02:48:45,269
something magical comes out of it
that we can't quite put a finger on

9954
02:48:45,269 --> 02:48:45,279
that we can't quite put a finger on
 

9955
02:48:45,279 --> 02:48:47,510
that we can't quite put a finger on
that's why that book is was was really

9956
02:48:47,510 --> 02:48:47,520
that's why that book is was was really
 

9957
02:48:47,520 --> 02:48:50,070
that's why that book is was was really
fundamental for me just for

9958
02:48:50,070 --> 02:48:50,080
fundamental for me just for
 

9959
02:48:50,080 --> 02:48:51,830
fundamental for me just for
i don't even know why it was just all

9960
02:48:51,830 --> 02:48:51,840
i don't even know why it was just all
 

9961
02:48:51,840 --> 02:48:53,750
i don't even know why it was just all
about this little magic that uh that

9962
02:48:53,750 --> 02:48:53,760
about this little magic that uh that
 

9963
02:48:53,760 --> 02:48:55,429
about this little magic that uh that
happens

9964
02:48:55,429 --> 02:48:55,439
happens
 

9965
02:48:55,439 --> 02:48:57,990
happens
so that's one that um probably the most

9966
02:48:57,990 --> 02:48:58,000
so that's one that um probably the most
 

9967
02:48:58,000 --> 02:48:59,349
so that's one that um probably the most
important book for replica was carl

9968
02:48:59,349 --> 02:48:59,359
important book for replica was carl
 

9969
02:48:59,359 --> 02:49:02,230
important book for replica was carl

02:49:02,240 --> 02:49:04,550
rogers on becoming a person um
and that's really

9972
02:49:04,550 --> 02:49:04,560
and that's really
 

9973
02:49:04,560 --> 02:49:06,309
and that's really
and so i think when i think about our

9974

which was weizenbaum you know the mit
professor that built

9992
02:49:23,990 --> 02:49:24,000
professor that built
 

9993
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:25,750

replica when i read carl rogers so i'll

10000
02:49:32,790 --> 02:49:32,800
replica when i read carl rogers so i'll
 

10001

and then i realized that eliza was
 

10005
02:49:35,600 --> 02:49:37,590
and then i realized that eliza was
mocking carl rogers

10006
02:49:37,590 --> 02:49:37,600
mocking carl rogers
 

10007
02:49:37,600 --> 02:49:40,469
mocking carl rogers
it was kyle rogers back in the day but i

10008
02:49:40,469 --> 02:49:40,479
it was kyle rogers back in the day but i
 

10009
02:49:40,479 --> 02:49:43,910
it was kyle rogers back in the day but i
thought that carl rogers ideas are

10010
02:49:43,910 --> 02:49:43,920
thought that carl rogers ideas are
 

10011
02:49:43,920 --> 02:49:45,510
thought that carl rogers ideas are
they're simple and they're not you know

10012
02:49:45,510 --> 02:49:45,520
they're simple and they're not you know
 

10013
02:49:45,520 --> 02:49:47,030
they're simple and they're not you know
they're very

10014
02:49:47,030 --> 02:49:47,040
they're very
 

10015
02:49:47,040 --> 02:49:48,550
they're very
very simple but they're

10016
02:49:48,550 --> 02:49:48,560
very simple but they're
 

10017
02:49:48,560 --> 02:49:49,830
very simple but they're
they're maybe the most profound thing

10018
02:49:49,830 --> 02:49:49,840
they're maybe the most profound thing
 

10019
02:49:49,840 --> 02:49:50,790
they're maybe the most profound thing
i've ever

10020
02:49:50,790 --> 02:49:50,800
i've ever
 

10021
02:49:50,800 --> 02:49:52,550
i've ever
learned about human beings

10022
02:49:52,550 --> 02:49:52,560
learned about human beings
 

10023
02:49:52,560 --> 02:49:55,030
learned about human beings
and that's the fact that um

10024
02:49:55,030 --> 02:49:55,040
and that's the fact that um
 

10025
02:49:55,040 --> 02:49:57,429
and that's the fact that um
before car rogers most therapy was about

10026
02:49:57,429 --> 02:49:57,439
before car rogers most therapy was about
 

10027
02:49:57,439 --> 02:49:59,110
before car rogers most therapy was about
seeing what's wrong with people and

10028
02:49:59,110 --> 02:49:59,120
seeing what's wrong with people and
 

10029
02:49:59,120 --> 02:50:00,630
seeing what's wrong with people and
trying to fix it or show them what's

10030
02:50:00,630 --> 02:50:00,640
trying to fix it or show them what's
 

10031
02:50:00,640 --> 02:50:01,750
trying to fix it or show them what's
wrong with you

10032
02:50:01,750 --> 02:50:01,760
wrong with you
 

10033
02:50:01,760 --> 02:50:03,910
wrong with you
um it was all built on the fact that

10034
02:50:03,910 --> 02:50:03,920
um it was all built on the fact that
 

10035
02:50:03,920 --> 02:50:05,510
um it was all built on the fact that
most people are all people are

10036
02:50:05,510 --> 02:50:05,520

and it's super important to create this
 

10067
02:50:34,640 --> 02:50:36,230

full acceptance
 

10079
02:50:44,160 --> 02:50:45,670
full acceptance
and you also try to be as genuine as

10080
02:50:45,670 --> 02:50:45,680
and you also try to be as genuine as
 

10081
02:50:45,680 --> 02:50:47,990
and you also try to be as genuine as
possible in it as possible in it and

10082
02:50:47,990 --> 02:50:48,000
possible in it as possible in it and
 

10083
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:49,030
possible in it as possible in it and
then

10084
02:50:49,030 --> 02:50:49,040
then
 

10085
02:50:49,040 --> 02:50:51,269
then
in his and then for him that was his own

10086
02:50:51,269 --> 02:50:51,279
in his and then for him that was his own
 

10087
02:50:51,279 --> 02:50:53,670
in his and then for him that was his own
journey of personal growth

10088
02:50:53,670 --> 02:50:53,680
journey of personal growth
 

10089
02:50:53,680 --> 02:50:55,910
journey of personal growth
and that was back in the 60s and even

10090
02:50:55,910 --> 02:50:55,920
and that was back in the 60s and even
 

10091
02:50:55,920 --> 02:50:57,670
and that was back in the 60s and even
that book that is you know it's coming

10092
02:50:57,670 --> 02:50:57,680
that book that is you know it's coming
 

10093
02:50:57,680 --> 02:50:59,110
that book that is you know it's coming
from

10094
02:50:59,110 --> 02:50:59,120
from
 

10095
02:50:59,120 --> 02:51:01,910
from
years ago um there's a mention that even

10096
02:51:01,910 --> 02:51:01,920
years ago um there's a mention that even
 

10097
02:51:01,920 --> 02:51:05,110
years ago um there's a mention that even
machines can potentially do that

10098
02:51:05,110 --> 02:51:05,120
machines can potentially do that
 

10099
02:51:05,120 --> 02:51:06,790
machines can potentially do that
and i always felt that you know creating

10100
02:51:06,790 --> 02:51:06,800
and i always felt that you know creating
 

10101
02:51:06,800 --> 02:51:08,950
and i always felt that you know creating
this space is probably the most the

10102
02:51:08,950 --> 02:51:08,960
this space is probably the most the
 

10103
02:51:08,960 --> 02:51:10,630
this space is probably the most the
biggest gift we can give to each other

10104
02:51:10,630 --> 02:51:10,640
biggest gift we can give to each other
 

10105
02:51:10,640 --> 02:51:12,230
biggest gift we can give to each other
and that's why the book was fundamental

10106
02:51:12,230 --> 02:51:12,240
and that's why the book was fundamental
 

10107
02:51:12,240 --> 02:51:14,550
and that's why the book was fundamental
for me personally because i felt i want

10108
02:51:14,550 --> 02:51:14,560
for me personally because i felt i want
 

10109
02:51:14,560 --> 02:51:17,910
for me personally because i felt i want
to be learning how to do that in my life

10110
02:51:17,910 --> 02:51:17,920
to be learning how to do that in my life
 

10111
02:51:17,920 --> 02:51:19,670
to be learning how to do that in my life
and maybe i can scale it with you know

10112
02:51:19,670 --> 02:51:19,680
and maybe i can scale it with you know
 

10113
02:51:19,680 --> 02:51:21,990
and maybe i can scale it with you know
with dzi systems and other people can

10114
02:51:21,990 --> 02:51:22,000
with dzi systems and other people can
 

10115
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:23,670
with dzi systems and other people can
get access to that

10116
02:51:23,670 --> 02:51:23,680
get access to that
 

10117
02:51:23,680 --> 02:51:25,910
get access to that
so i think carl rogers it's a pretty dry

10118
02:51:25,910 --> 02:51:25,920
so i think carl rogers it's a pretty dry
 

10119
02:51:25,920 --> 02:51:28,070
so i think carl rogers it's a pretty dry
and a little bit boring book but i think

10120
02:51:28,070 --> 02:51:28,080
and a little bit boring book but i think
 

10121
02:51:28,080 --> 02:51:30,790
and a little bit boring book but i think
they didn't let others try to read it

10122
02:51:30,790 --> 02:51:30,800
they didn't let others try to read it
 

10123
02:51:30,800 --> 02:51:33,190
they didn't let others try to read it
i do i think for

10124
02:51:33,190 --> 02:51:33,200
i do i think for
 

10125
02:51:33,200 --> 02:51:35,349
i do i think for
just for yourself for

10126
02:51:35,349 --> 02:51:35,359
just for yourself for
 

10127
02:51:35,359 --> 02:51:38,309
just for yourself for
as a human not as a human it's it's it

10128
02:51:38,309 --> 02:51:38,319
as a human not as a human it's it's it
 

10129
02:51:38,319 --> 02:51:40,630
as a human not as a human it's it's it
is it is just and

10130
02:51:40,630 --> 02:51:40,640
is it is just and
 

10131
02:51:40,640 --> 02:51:43,030
is it is just and
for him that was his own path of his own

10132
02:51:43,030 --> 02:51:43,040
for him that was his own path of his own
 

10133
02:51:43,040 --> 02:51:45,030
for him that was his own path of his own
personal of growing personally over

10134
02:51:45,030 --> 02:51:45,040
personal of growing personally over
 

10135
02:51:45,040 --> 02:51:47,590
personal of growing personally over
years working with people like that

10136
02:51:47,590 --> 02:51:47,600
years working with people like that
