about like the specifics of the product

1336
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:47,440
about like the specifics of the product

how to design things how to like the you

1338
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:49,440
how to design things how to like the you
 

1339
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,029
how to design things how to like the you
know the first principles the basics of

1340
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:51,039
know the first principles the basics of
 

1341
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,269
know the first principles the basics of
how to build the thing how much it's

1342
00:23:52,269 --> 00:23:52,279
how to build the thing how much it's
 

1343
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:54,230
how to build the thing how much it's
going to cause all that yeah I mean

1344
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:54,240
going to cause all that yeah I mean
 

1345
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,310
going to cause all that yeah I mean
because if you can't do the basics

1346
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:55,320
because if you can't do the basics
 

1347
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,190
because if you can't do the basics
you're not going to be able to do the

1348
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:56,200
you're not going to be able to do the
 

1349
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,909
you're not going to be able to do the
bigger things and at the same time

00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,390
bigger things and at the same time
you've got to be one of the things that

you've got to be one of the things that
 

1353
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,669
you've got to be one of the things that

1357
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,390
remind any that I work with on is we all
tend to lie to ourselves our product is

1358
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:06,400
tend to lie to ourselves our product is
 

1359
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,029
tend to lie to ourselves our product is
bigger faster cheaper this or that as if

bigger faster cheaper this or that as if
 

1361
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:13,110
bigger faster cheaper this or that as if
that is a um finite situation that's

1362
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:13,120
that is a um finite situation that's
 

1363
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,710
that is a um finite situation that's
never going to change right and there's

never going to change right and there's
 

1365
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,470
never going to change right and there's

00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:51,039
at the time and then a year later we
 

1549
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,190
at the time and then a year later we
sold it to Yahoo for $5.7 billion in

1550
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:54,200
sold it to Yahoo for $5.7 billion in
 

1551
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,789
sold it to Yahoo for $5.7 billion in
Yahoo stock and I owned you know right

1552
00:27:57,789 --> 00:27:57,799
Yahoo stock and I owned you know right
 

1553
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:00,230
Yahoo stock and I owned you know right
around 30% of the company give or take

1554
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:00,240
around 30% of the company give or take
 

1555
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,909
around 30% of the company give or take
and so after taxes that's what got me

1556
00:28:01,909 --> 00:28:01,919
and so after taxes that's what got me
 

1557
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,389
and so after taxes that's what got me
there well there's a lot of questions

1558
00:28:03,389 --> 00:28:03,399
there well there's a lot of questions
 

1559
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:04,950
there well there's a lot of questions
there so the technical challenge of that

1560
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:04,960
there so the technical challenge of that
 

1561
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,630
there so the technical challenge of that
you're making it sound easy but uh you

1562
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:07,640
you're making it sound easy but uh you
 

1563
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,470
you're making it sound easy but uh you
wrote code but still in the early days

1564
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:11,480
wrote code but still in the early days
 

1565
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,950
wrote code but still in the early days
of the internet how do you figure out

1566
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:12,960
of the internet how do you figure out
 

1567
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,750
of the internet how do you figure out
how to create this kind of uh product of

1568
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:16,760
how to create this kind of uh product of
 

1569
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,549
how to create this kind of uh product of
of of just audio at first and then video

1570
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:18,559
of of just audio at first and then video
 

1571
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,149
of of just audio at first and then video
at first a lot of iterations right like

1572
00:28:20,149 --> 00:28:20,159
at first a lot of iterations right like
 

1573
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,630
at first a lot of iterations right like
you talked about um we started in the

1574
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:22,640
you talked about um we started in the
 

1575
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,149
you talked about um we started in the
second bedroom of my house set up a

1576
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:24,159
second bedroom of my house set up a
 

1577
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,509
second bedroom of my house set up a
server I got an ISDN line which was a

1578
00:28:26,509 --> 00:28:26,519
server I got an ISDN line which was a
 

1579
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:32,070
server I got an ISDN line which was a
128k line and set up downloaded Netscape

1580
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:32,080
128k line and set up downloaded Netscape
 

1581
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,470
128k line and set up downloaded Netscape
server and then started using different

1582
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:35,480
server and then started using different
 

1583
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,590
server and then started using different
file formats that were Progressive

1584
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:37,600
file formats that were Progressive
 

1585
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,269
file formats that were Progressive
loading and allowing people to connect

1586
00:28:40,269 --> 00:28:40,279
loading and allowing people to connect
 

1587
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:42,630
loading and allowing people to connect
to the server and do a progressive

1588
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:42,640
to the server and do a progressive
 

1589
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,110
to the server and do a progressive
download so that the audio you can

1590
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:44,120
download so that the audio you can
 

1591
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,909
download so that the audio you can
listen to the audio while it was

1592
00:28:45,909 --> 00:28:45,919
listen to the audio while it was
 

1593
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,750
listen to the audio while it was
downloading onto your PC yeah was it

1594
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:47,760
downloading onto your PC yeah was it
 

1595
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,549
downloading onto your PC yeah was it
super choppy so you trying to figure out

1596
00:28:49,549 --> 00:28:49,559
super choppy so you trying to figure out
 

1597
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:50,870
super choppy so you trying to figure out
yeah for sure for sure it would buffer

1598
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:50,880
yeah for sure for sure it would buffer
 

1599
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,669
yeah for sure for sure it would buffer
it was yeah was it it wasn't good but it

1600
00:28:52,669 --> 00:28:52,679
it was yeah was it it wasn't good but it
 

1601
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:54,350
it was yeah was it it wasn't good but it
was a start but it was good enough cuz

1602
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:54,360
was a start but it was good enough cuz
 

1603
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,789
was a start but it was good enough cuz
it's the first kind of yeah because

1604
00:28:55,789 --> 00:28:55,799
it's the first kind of yeah because
 

1605
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:57,230
it's the first kind of yeah because
there was no other competition right

1606
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:57,240
there was no other competition right
 

1607
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,070
there was no other competition right
there was nobody else doing it and so it

1608
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,080
there was nobody else doing it and so it
 

1609
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,870
there was nobody else doing it and so it
was like okay I can get access to this

1610
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:00,880
was like okay I can get access to this
 

1611
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,470
was like okay I can get access to this
this or this and then there were some

1612
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:02,480
this or this and then there were some
 

1613
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,110
this or this and then there were some
third party software companies zing and

1614
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:05,120
third party software companies zing and
 

1615
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,950
third party software companies zing and
um Progressive networks and others that

1616
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:06,960
um Progressive networks and others that
 

1617
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,070
um Progressive networks and others that
were that took it a little bit further

1618
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:09,080
were that took it a little bit further
 

1619
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,070
were that took it a little bit further
so we partnered with them and I started

1620
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,080
so we partnered with them and I started
 

1621
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,830
so we partnered with them and I started
going to local radio stations where

1622
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:14,840
going to local radio stations where
 

1623
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,070
going to local radio stations where
literally we would set up a server right

1624
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:18,080
literally we would set up a server right
 

1625
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,789
literally we would set up a server right
next to it I had a

1626
00:29:19,789 --> 00:29:19,799
next to it I had a
 

1627
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,990
next to it I had a
$49 um radio the highest FM radio that I

1628
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:23,000
$49 um radio the highest FM radio that I
 

1629
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,669
$49 um radio the highest FM radio that I
could find and we take the output of the

1630
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:25,679
could find and we take the output of the
 

1631
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,269
could find and we take the output of the
audio signal from the radio with these

1632
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:28,279
audio signal from the radio with these
 

1633

audio signal from the radio with these
two analog cables plug it into the

1634
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:30,640
two analog cables plug it into the
 

1635
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,789
two analog cables plug it into the
server encode it and make it available

1636
00:29:33,789 --> 00:29:33,799
server encode it and make it available
 

1637
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:36,990
server encode it and make it available
from aet.com then I would go on yunet

1638
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:37,000
from aet.com then I would go on yunet
 

1639
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,310
from aet.com then I would go on yunet
bulletin boards I would go on CompuServe

1640
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:39,320
bulletin boards I would go on CompuServe
 

1641
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,430
bulletin boards I would go on CompuServe
I would go on Prodigy I would go on AOL

1642
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:42,440
I would go on Prodigy I would go on AOL
 

1643
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,669
I would go on Prodigy I would go on AOL
I'd go wherever I could find bodies and

1644
00:29:44,669 --> 00:29:44,679
I'd go wherever I could find bodies and
 

1645
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:46,669
I'd go wherever I could find bodies and
I'd say okay we've got this radio

1646
00:29:46,669 --> 00:29:46,679
I'd say okay we've got this radio
 

1647

dollars and we'll do it just under their
 

1779
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,870
dollars and we'll do it just under their
PCS at work so we did you know when

1780
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:14,880
PCS at work so we did you know when
 

1781
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,110
PCS at work so we did you know when
Intel announced the P90 PC we you know

1782
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:18,120
Intel announced the P90 PC we you know

phone or a new product we would charge
 

1789
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,029
phone or a new product we would charge
them and so we Ed the consumer side to

1790
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:26,039
them and so we Ed the consumer side to
 

1791
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:29,870
them and so we Ed the consumer side to
do a proof of concept for Network um and

1792
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:29,880
do a proof of concept for Network um and
 

1793
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,590
do a proof of concept for Network um and
then we would take that knowledge and go

1794
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:32,600
then we would take that knowledge and go
 

1795
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,110
then we would take that knowledge and go
to corporations and that's how we made

00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:34,120
to corporations and that's how we made
 

1797
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,750
to corporations and that's how we made
our revenue and there's some selling

1798

you said a bunch of servers like at
 

1813
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,230
you said a bunch of servers like at
which point do you get more Engineers

1814
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:51,240
which point do you get more Engineers
 

1815
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,590
which point do you get more Engineers
how much did you understand could do

1816
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:53,600
how much did you understand could do
 

1817
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,950
how much did you understand could do
yourself and then also once you can't do

1818
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:56,960
yourself and then also once you can't do
 

1819
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,909
yourself and then also once you can't do
it all yourself

1820
00:32:58,909 --> 00:32:58,919
it all yourself
 

1821
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:00,789
it all yourself
how much technical Savvy is required to

1822
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:00,799
how much technical Savvy is required to
 

1823
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:01,789
how much technical Savvy is required to
understand enough to hire the right

1824
00:33:01,789 --> 00:33:01,799
understand enough to hire the right
 

1825
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:03,590
understand enough to hire the right
people to keep building this and Innova

network to um software to just all these
 

1837
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,549
network to um software to just all these
different things was this like a scary

1838
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:18,559
different things was this like a scary
 

1839

thing like it's terrifying right because
 

1841
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,029
thing like it's terrifying right because
as we were growing trying to keep up the

1842
00:33:23,029 --> 00:33:23,039
as we were growing trying to keep up the
 

1843
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,990
as we were growing trying to keep up the
scale and literally we're buying

1844
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:25,000
scale and literally we're buying
 

1845
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,230
scale and literally we're buying
off-the-shelf PCS and then you know cars

1846
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:28,240
off-the-shelf PCS and then you know cars
 

1847
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,110
off-the-shelf PCS and then you know cars
as the technology advanced and hard

1848
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:30,120
as the technology advanced and hard
 

1849
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,509
as the technology advanced and hard
drives and things would fail and we

1850
00:33:32,509 --> 00:33:32,519
drives and things would fail and we
 

1851
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:34,310
drives and things would fail and we
would have to you know we didn't have

1852
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:34,320
would have to you know we didn't have
 

1853
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,750
would have to you know we didn't have
machine learning back then to do an

1854
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:35,760
machine learning back then to do an
 

1855
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,070
machine learning back then to do an
analysis of you know how to distribute

1856
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:38,080
analysis of you know how to distribute
 

1857
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,350
analysis of you know how to distribute
server you know resources so you know

1858
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:41,360
server you know resources so you know
 

1859
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,870
server you know resources so you know
like there was there was a time when um

1860
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:44,880
like there was there was a time when um
 

1861

of um their interviews of him or
something like that right and we

1868
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:55,360
something like that right and we
 

1869
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,149
something like that right and we
literally we I knew at that point time

1870
00:33:58,149 --> 00:33:58,159
literally we I knew at that point time
 

1871
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,029
literally we I knew at that point time
when that was released everybody at work

1872
00:34:00,029 --> 00:34:00,039
when that was released everybody at work
 

1873
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:01,830
when that was released everybody at work
was going to want to listen to it right

1874
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:01,840
was going to want to listen to it right
 

1875
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,710
was going to want to listen to it right
so we had to take down servers that were

1876
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:03,720
so we had to take down servers that were
 

1877
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,830
so we had to take down servers that were
doing Chicago Cubs baseball right you

1878
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:06,840
doing Chicago Cubs baseball right you
 

1879
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,349
doing Chicago Cubs baseball right you
know and just make all these on the-fly

1880
00:34:08,349 --> 00:34:08,359
know and just make all these on the-fly
 

1881
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:10,149
know and just make all these on the-fly
decisions because there was no we didn't

1882
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:10,159
decisions because there was no we didn't
 

1883
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,190
decisions because there was no we didn't
have the tools to analyze or predict be

1884
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:12,200
have the tools to analyze or predict be
 

1885
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,629
have the tools to analyze or predict be
predictive but yeah it was it was all

1886
00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:14,639
predictive but yeah it was it was all
 

1887
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,190
predictive but yeah it was it was all
technology driven and

1888
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:16,200
technology driven and
 

1889
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,829
technology driven and
marketing um the acquisition by Yahoo

1890
00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:18,839
marketing um the acquisition by Yahoo
 

1891
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:20,510
marketing um the acquisition by Yahoo
can you tell the story of that but also

1892
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:20,520
can you tell the story of that but also
 

1893
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,430
can you tell the story of that but also
in the broader context of this internet

1894
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:23,440
in the broader context of this internet
 

1895
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,190
in the broader context of this internet
bubble this is a fascinating part of

1896
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:26,200
bubble this is a fascinating part of
 

1897
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,790
bubble this is a fascinating part of
human history yeah so so on the

1898
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:28,800
human history yeah so so on the
 

1899
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,629
human history yeah so so on the
acquisition side we were the largest

1900
00:34:30,629 --> 00:34:30,639
acquisition side we were the largest
 

1901
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,190
acquisition side we were the largest
media site on the internet it wasn't

1902
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:32,200
media site on the internet it wasn't
 

1903
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,829
media site on the internet it wasn't
close there was nobody close we were

1904
00:34:34,829 --> 00:34:34,839
close there was nobody close we were
 

1905
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:36,589
close there was nobody close we were
YouTube and relatively speaking we would

1906
00:34:36,589 --> 00:34:36,599
YouTube and relatively speaking we would
 

1907
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:38,829
YouTube and relatively speaking we would
be 10x YouTube relative to the

1908
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:38,839
be 10x YouTube relative to the
 

1909
00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:40,069
be 10x YouTube relative to the
competition because there was nobody

1910
00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:40,079
competition because there was nobody
 

1911
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,629
competition because there was nobody
there um and so it became obvious to

1912
00:34:43,629 --> 00:34:43,639
there um and so it became obvious to
 

1913
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,990
there um and so it became obvious to
Yahoo AOL and others that they needed a

1914
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:46,000
Yahoo AOL and others that they needed a
 

1915
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,109
Yahoo AOL and others that they needed a
multimedia component and we had the

1916
00:34:48,109 --> 00:34:48,119
multimedia component and we had the
 

1917
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:51,270
multimedia component and we had the
infrastructure sales all that stuff um

1918
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:51,280
infrastructure sales all that stuff um
 

1919
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,869
infrastructure sales all that stuff um
and so

1920
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:52,879
and so
 

1921
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:56,750
and so
Yahoo when we went public in 98 or right

1922
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:56,760
Yahoo when we went public in 98 or right
 

1923
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,670
Yahoo when we went public in 98 or right
before I think it was they made an

1924
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:58,680
before I think it was they made an
 

1925
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,390
before I think it was they made an
investment of like $2 million which gave

1926
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:01,400
investment of like $2 million which gave
 

1927
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,910
investment of like $2 million which gave
us a connection to them and then after

1928
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:03,920

1929
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,589
us a connection to them and then after
we went public they decided they needed

1930
00:35:06,589 --> 00:35:06,599
we went public they decided they needed
 

1931
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:11,190
we went public they decided they needed
to have multimedia and so in April of 99

1932
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:11,200
to have multimedia and so in April of 99
 

1933
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,710

what I did was we put together a caller
 

2115
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,990
what I did was we put together a caller
where I sold calls and bought puts and

cabs and people just start talking about
 

2181
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,670

internet stocks there were people

2182
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:06,680
internet stocks there were people
 

2183
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,390
internet stocks there were people
creating companies with just a website

creating companies with just a website
 

2185
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,230
creating companies with just a website
and going public you know that's a

2186
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:10,240
and going public you know that's a
 

2187
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,109
and going public you know that's a
bubble right where there's no intrinsic

2188
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:12,119
bubble right where there's no intrinsic
 

2189
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:14,230
bubble right where there's no intrinsic
value at all and people aren't even

2190
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:14,240
value at all and people aren't even

2197
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,030
frothiness of the stock market that's a
bubble you don't see that right now

2198
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:21,040
bubble you don't see that right now
 

2199
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,550
bubble you don't see that right now
there's not companies you don't see

2200
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:22,560
there's not companies you don't see
 

2201
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,309
there's not companies you don't see
hardly you don't see any IPOs right now

2202
00:40:24,309 --> 00:40:24,319
hardly you don't see any IPOs right now
 

2203
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:26,550
hardly you don't see any IPOs right now
for that matter so you know I don't

2204
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:26,560
for that matter so you know I don't
 

2205
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,950
for that matter so you know I don't
think we're in a bubble now but back

2206
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:27,960
think we're in a bubble now but back
 

2207
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,710
think we're in a bubble now but back
then yes I thought we were in a bubble

2208
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:29,720
then yes I thought we were in a bubble
 

2209
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,390
then yes I thought we were in a bubble
but that wasn't really the motivating

2210
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:31,400
but that wasn't really the motivating
 

2211
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,870
but that wasn't really the motivating
factor do you think it's possible we're

2212
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:32,880
factor do you think it's possible we're
 

2213
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,349
factor do you think it's possible we're
in a bit of an AI bubble right now no

2214
00:40:36,349 --> 00:40:36,359
in a bit of an AI bubble right now no
 

2215
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:38,710
in a bit of an AI bubble right now no
because we're not seeing funky AI

2216
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:38,720
because we're not seeing funky AI
 

2217

00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:48,160
just creating models to create models
 

2225
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,190

that are going public then yeah that's

2226
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:50,200
that are going public then yeah that's
 

2227
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,030
that are going public then yeah that's
probably the start of a bubble um but

2228
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:53,040
probably the start of a bubble um but
 

2229
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,710

00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,630
know how to sell and I know technology
and I've learned enough over the years

2264
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:29,640
and I've learned enough over the years
 

2265
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,990
and I've learned enough over the years
to do that um could I make 10 million

2266
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:32,000
to do that um could I make 10 million
 

2267
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,550
to do that um could I make 10 million
probably 100 million I hope so um but a

2268
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:35,560
probably 100 million I hope so um but a
 

2269
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,910
probably 100 million I hope so um but a
billion just something good has got to

2270
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:37,920
billion just something good has got to
 

2271
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,990
billion just something good has got to
happen you know um timing timing you

2272
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:41,000
happen you know um timing timing you
 

2273
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,550
happen you know um timing timing you
know Internet stock market was going

2274
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:42,560
know Internet stock market was going
 

2275
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,550
know Internet stock market was going
nuts right when we started you know and

2276
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:45,560
nuts right when we started you know and
 

2277
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,950
nuts right when we started you know and
that certainly I couldn't predict or

2278
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:47,960
that certainly I couldn't predict or
 

2279
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,550
that certainly I couldn't predict or
control um you know it's like AI right

2280
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:51,560
control um you know it's like AI right
 

2281
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,710
control um you know it's like AI right
now ai's been around a long long long

2282
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:54,720
now ai's been around a long long long
 

2283
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:59,390
now ai's been around a long long long
long time and the Nvidia processors or

2284
00:41:59,390 --> 00:41:59,400
long time and the Nvidia processors or
 

2285
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,829
long time and the Nvidia processors or
gpus rather you couldn't predict that

2286
00:42:01,829 --> 00:42:01,839
gpus rather you couldn't predict that
 

2287
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:03,270
gpus rather you couldn't predict that
now's the time that they were going to

2288
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:03,280
now's the time that they were going to
 

2289
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,430
now's the time that they were going to
be get to that cost Effectiveness where

2290
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:05,440
be get to that cost Effectiveness where
 

2291
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,589
be get to that cost Effectiveness where
you know you could do you could create

2292
00:42:07,589 --> 00:42:07,599
you know you could do you could create
 

2293
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,829
you know you could do you could create
models and train them and although it's

2294
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:09,839
models and train them and although it's
 

2295
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:12,550
models and train them and although it's
expensive it's still doable you know we

2296
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:12,560
expensive it's still doable you know we
 

2297
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,829
expensive it's still doable you know we
didn't really even we had as6 right for

2298
00:42:14,829 --> 00:42:14,839
didn't really even we had as6 right for
 

2299
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:17,390
didn't really even we had as6 right for
custom applications and we had CPUs that

2300
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:17,400
custom applications and we had CPUs that
 

2301
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,670
custom applications and we had CPUs that
were leading the way but gpus were more

2302
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:19,680
were leading the way but gpus were more
 

2303
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,510
were leading the way but gpus were more
for gaming and then crypto Mining and

2304
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:22,520
for gaming and then crypto Mining and
 

2305
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,109
for gaming and then crypto Mining and
now all then all of a sudden they were

2306
00:42:24,109 --> 00:42:24,119
now all then all of a sudden they were
 

2307
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:28,030
now all then all of a sudden they were
the foundation for AI models so

2308
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:28,040
the foundation for AI models so
 

2309
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:31,349
the foundation for AI models so

it's that simple so that's a beautiful

3248
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:09,520
it's that simple so that's a beautiful
 

3249
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:12,270
it's that simple so that's a beautiful
ideal when it's implemented implemented

3250
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:12,280
ideal when it's implemented implemented
 

3251
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,630
ideal when it's implemented implemented
poorly perhaps or in a way that doesn't

3252
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:14,640
poorly perhaps or in a way that doesn't
 

3253
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:18,150
poorly perhaps or in a way that doesn't
reach that ideal do you see maybe when

3254
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:18,160
reach that ideal do you see maybe when
 

3255
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:21,430
reach that ideal do you see maybe when
it's uh quota based do you see that it

3256
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:21,440
it's uh quota based do you see that it
 

3257
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:25,349
it's uh quota based do you see that it
can result in essentially racism towards

3258
01:00:25,349 --> 01:00:25,359
can result in essentially racism towards
 

3259
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:27,069
can result in essentially racism towards
Asian people and white people for

3260
01:00:27,069 --> 01:00:27,079

example there's a lot to unpack there

3262
01:00:29,029 --> 01:00:29,039
example there's a lot to unpack there
 

3263
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:31,630
example there's a lot to unpack there
right um so first you can't do quotas

3264
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:31,640
right um so first you can't do quotas
 

3265
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:33,950
right um so first you can't do quotas
they're illegal unless they you're um

3266
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:33,960
they're illegal unless they you're um
 

3267
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,270
they're illegal unless they you're um
and I'm not the lawyer on this subject

3268
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:35,280
and I'm not the lawyer on this subject
 

3269
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,150
and I'm not the lawyer on this subject
but unless you're you're trying to

3270
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:38,160
but unless you're you're trying to
 

3271
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,829
but unless you're you're trying to
repair something that's happened in the

3272
01:00:39,829 --> 01:00:39,839
repair something that's happened in the
 

3273
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:41,230
repair something that's happened in the
past like some discrimination that's

3274
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:41,240
past like some discrimination that's
 

3275
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:43,870
past like some discrimination that's
happened in the past so it's not quota

3276
01:00:43,870 --> 01:00:43,880
happened in the past so it's not quota
 

3277
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:46,069
happened in the past so it's not quota
based and I think that's really just

3278
01:00:46,069 --> 01:00:46,079
based and I think that's really just
 

3279
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:49,589
based and I think that's really just
kind of a a straw man that that people

3280
01:00:49,589 --> 01:00:49,599
kind of a a straw man that that people
 

3281
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:51,870
kind of a a straw man that that people
put out there now does that mean that

3282
01:00:51,870 --> 01:00:51,880
put out there now does that mean that
 

3283
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,150
put out there now does that mean that

when I see an ideal that you know you

3688
01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:04,480
when I see an ideal that you know you
 

3689
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,470
when I see an ideal that you know you
try to implement it and support it and

3690
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:06,480
try to implement it and support it and
 

3691
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:09,870
try to implement it and support it and
get to that point but universities and

3692
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:09,880
get to that point but universities and
 

3693
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,390
get to that point but universities and
companies are night and day different

3694
01:10:11,390 --> 01:10:11,400
companies are night and day different
 

3695
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,229
companies are night and day different
right I can see an argument for the

3696
01:10:13,229 --> 01:10:13,239
right I can see an argument for the
 

3697
01:10:13,239 --> 01:10:15,270
right I can see an argument for the
ideology in a university I can see you

3698
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:15,280
ideology in a university I can see you
 

3699
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,950
ideology in a university I can see you
know you look at the the the amount of

3700
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:16,960
know you look at the the the amount of
 

3701
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,550
know you look at the the the amount of
money spent on it and so while the the

3702
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:19,560
money spent on it and so while the the
 

3703
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:23,550
money spent on it and so while the the
goal is right um the way they implement

3704
01:10:23,550 --> 01:10:23,560
goal is right um the way they implement
 

3705
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:25,590
goal is right um the way they implement
it in universities the way they

3706
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:25,600
it in universities the way they
 

3707
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,430
it in universities the way they
Implement most things in universities is

3708
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:27,440
Implement most things in universities is
 

3709
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:29,790
Implement most things in universities is
wrong right there's a reason why tuition

3710
01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:29,800
wrong right there's a reason why tuition
 

3711
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:33,030
wrong right there's a reason why tuition
has gone up you know a multitude of uh

3712
01:10:33,030 --> 01:10:33,040
has gone up you know a multitude of uh
 

3713
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:37,910
has gone up you know a multitude of uh
or a multiple of inflation um they're

3714
01:10:37,910 --> 01:10:37,920
or a multiple of inflation um they're
 

3715
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:39,750
or a multiple of inflation um they're
not well-run organizations across the

3716
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:39,760
not well-run organizations across the
 

3717
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,669
not well-run organizations across the
board so I'm not going to argue with

3718
01:10:41,669 --> 01:10:41,679
board so I'm not going to argue with
 

3719
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:43,149
board so I'm not going to argue with
that at all so when you've seen me argue

3720
01:10:43,149 --> 01:10:43,159
that at all so when you've seen me argue
 

3721
01:10:43,159 --> 01:10:45,590
that at all so when you've seen me argue
with Dei I haven't waited into Dei and

3722
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:45,600
with Dei I haven't waited into Dei and
 

3723
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,870
with Dei I haven't waited into Dei and
Universities at all so it's mostly

3724
01:10:46,870 --> 01:10:46,880
Universities at all so it's mostly
 

3725
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,709
Universities at all so it's mostly
focused on companies 100% right because

3726
01:10:48,709 --> 01:10:48,719
focused on companies 100% right because
 

3727
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:50,510
focused on companies 100% right because
that's where where I exist but at the

3728
01:10:50,510 --> 01:10:50,520
that's where where I exist but at the
 

3729
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:52,510
that's where where I exist but at the
same time like I read Christopher ru's

3730
01:10:52,510 --> 01:10:52,520
same time like I read Christopher ru's
 

3731
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:54,270
same time like I read Christopher ru's
book where he talks about the kind of

3732
01:10:54,270 --> 01:10:54,280
book where he talks about the kind of
 

3733
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:57,030
book where he talks about the kind of
the genealogy of ISM and and ideology

3734
01:10:57,030 --> 01:10:57,040
the genealogy of ISM and and ideology
 

3735
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,550
the genealogy of ISM and and ideology
but then he gets to the point and I hope

3736
01:10:58,550 --> 01:10:58,560
but then he gets to the point and I hope
 

3737
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,590
but then he gets to the point and I hope
I'm remembering this right where he says

3738
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:01,600
I'm remembering this right where he says
 

3739
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:05,350
I'm remembering this right where he says
that the response to it is

3740
01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:05,360
that the response to it is
 

3741
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,270
that the response to it is
decentralized activism if you will

3742
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:07,280
decentralized activism if you will
 

3743
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:09,310
decentralized activism if you will
that's not the word he used to try to

3744
01:11:09,310 --> 01:11:09,320
that's not the word he used to try to
 

3745
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:11,630
that's not the word he used to try to
counter that

3746
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:11,640
counter that
 

3747
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:14,030
counter that
Dei

3748
01:11:14,030 --> 01:11:14,040
Dei
 

3749
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,870
Dei
and that seems to me to be counter to

3750
01:11:16,870 --> 01:11:16,880
and that seems to me to be counter to
 

3751
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,390
and that seems to me to be counter to
the whole conservative movement right

3752
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:18,400
the whole conservative movement right
 

3753
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:21,550

01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:01,600
that's

that's
that's billions of customers who are not

going to so what you're saying is the
 

4011
01:17:05,719 --> 01:17:07,910
going to so what you're saying is the
free market stops with artificial

01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:12,480
attention and respond that Google
 

4017
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:14,629
attention and respond that Google
doesn't listen to the responses that

4018
01:17:14,629 --> 01:17:14,639
doesn't listen to the responses that
 

4019
01:17:14,639 --> 01:17:16,430
doesn't listen to the responses that
people inside of Google will ignore

4020
01:17:16,430 --> 01:17:16,440
people inside of Google will ignore
 

4021
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:19,070
people inside of Google will ignore
their own best financial interest and

even their own best personal interest
 

4025
01:17:20,679 --> 01:17:21,510

so so I just don't see that and and

4030
01:17:27,550 --> 01:17:27,560
so so I just don't see that and and
 

4031
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:28,870
so so I just don't see that and and
elon's not allowed to make those same

elon's not allowed to make those same
 

4033
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:31,830
elon's not allowed to make those same
mistakes but is allowed to make those

4034
01:17:31,830 --> 01:17:31,840
mistakes but is allowed to make those
 

4035
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,750
mistakes but is allowed to make those
mistakes but Google isn't oh no Elon is

4036
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:34,760

out I think overstating the criticism of

that everybody uses well I guess the
 

4115
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,470
that everybody uses well I guess the
main criticism is you want to have some

main criticism is you want to have some

01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:07,390
main criticism is you want to have some
transparency of all the teams that are

transparency of all the teams that are

involved and that this kind of to the
 

4121
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:14,070
involved and that this kind of to the
degree there's a left leaning ideology

4122
01:19:14,070 --> 01:19:14,080
degree there's a left leaning ideology
 

4123
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:16,030
degree there's a left leaning ideology
within the companies it doesn't affect

01:19:16,030 --> 01:19:16,040
within the companies it doesn't affect
 

4125
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:17,910
within the companies it doesn't affect
the product but that's the beauty of the

4126
01:19:17,910 --> 01:19:17,920
the product but that's the beauty of the
 

4127
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,669
the product but that's the beauty of the
free market yeah that's where the market

4128
01:19:19,669 --> 01:19:19,679
free market yeah that's where the market
 

4129
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:22,550
free market yeah that's where the market
corrects it right and not only from the

4130
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:22,560
corrects it right and not only from the
 

4131
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,950
corrects it right and not only from the
outside because everybody you know was

4132
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:24,960
outside because everybody you know was
 

4133
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,950
outside because everybody you know was
going to test it like when YouTube first

4134
01:19:26,950 --> 01:19:26,960
going to test it like when YouTube first
 

4135
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:28,990
going to test it like when YouTube first
came out or not first came out when

after Google bought them you used to be
 

4139
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:33,629
after Google bought them you used to be
able there used to be um different

able there used to be um different
 

4141
01:19:33,639 --> 01:19:34,910
able there used to be um different
commands you could give it right there

4142
01:19:34,910 --> 01:19:34,920
commands you could give it right there
 

4143
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:37,709
commands you could give it right there
were line um prompt commands that you

4144
01:19:37,709 --> 01:19:37,719
were line um prompt commands that you
 

4145
01:19:37,719 --> 01:19:39,629
were line um prompt commands that you
could give it and you could find all the

4146
01:19:39,629 --> 01:19:39,639
could give it and you could find all the
 

4147
01:19:39,639 --> 01:19:42,629
could give it and you could find all the
nasty porn that got loaded before the

project where we take 30 different AI
 

4255
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,390
project where we take 30 different AI
models and there's just a meta search

4256
01:21:49,390 --> 01:21:49,400
models and there's just a meta search
 

4257
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:51,709
models and there's just a meta search
engine where it searches all of them and

4258
01:21:51,709 --> 01:21:51,719
engine where it searches all of them and
 

4259
01:21:51,719 --> 01:21:53,990
engine where it searches all of them and
you can compare all the outputs and see

4260
01:21:53,990 --> 01:21:54,000
you can compare all the outputs and see
 

4261
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,310
you can compare all the outputs and see
what you think is is the best kind of

01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:35,790
your tribe the only way to stand down is
hyperbole the hard part and why I like

5094
01:40:35,790 --> 01:40:35,800
hyperbole the hard part and why I like
 

5095
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:37,350
hyperbole the hard part and why I like
this conversation is how do you

5096

this conversation is how do you
 

5097
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:40,430
this conversation is how do you
distinguish hyperbole versus reality and

5098
01:40:40,430 --> 01:40:40,440
distinguish hyperbole versus reality and
 

5099
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:42,589
distinguish hyperbole versus reality and
I get where you're going Lex where it's

5100
01:40:42,589 --> 01:40:42,599
I get where you're going Lex where it's
 

5101

like
 

5103
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:48,589
like
what the smallest spark sometimes can

5104
01:40:48,589 --> 01:40:48,599
what the smallest spark sometimes can
 

5105
01:40:48,599 --> 01:40:51,149
what the smallest spark sometimes can
cause people to change and then that

5106
01:40:51,149 --> 01:40:51,159
cause people to change and then that
 

5107
01:40:51,159 --> 01:40:54,510
cause people to change and then that
spark becomes bigger and then it becomes

5108
01:40:54,510 --> 01:40:54,520
spark becomes bigger and then it becomes
 

5109
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:56,589
spark becomes bigger and then it becomes
um more widespread and then all of a

5110
01:40:56,589 --> 01:40:56,599
um more widespread and then all of a
 

5111
01:40:56,599 --> 01:40:58,669
um more widespread and then all of a
sudden your country has changed it's not

5112
01:40:58,669 --> 01:40:58,679
sudden your country has changed it's not
 

5113
01:40:58,679 --> 01:41:00,830
sudden your country has changed it's not
what you thought it was I I get that

5114
01:41:00,830 --> 01:41:00,840
what you thought it was I I get that
 

5115

what you thought it was I I get that
completely right and yes you always have

5116
01:41:03,270 --> 01:41:03,280
completely right and yes you always have
 

5117
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:05,709
completely right and yes you always have
to be on top of that to make sure but a

5118
01:41:05,709 --> 01:41:05,719
to be on top of that to make sure but a
 

5119
01:41:05,719 --> 01:41:07,030
to be on top of that to make sure but a
lot of that comes from lack of

5120
01:41:07,030 --> 01:41:07,040
lot of that comes from lack of
 

5121
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:09,270
lot of that comes from lack of
leadership right and lack of trust

5122
01:41:09,270 --> 01:41:09,280
leadership right and lack of trust
 

5123

Elon changed the
 

5179
01:42:11,119 --> 01:42:13,470
Elon changed the
algorithm yeah just by taking himself

5180
01:42:13,470 --> 01:42:13,480
algorithm yeah just by taking himself
 

5181
01:42:13,480 --> 01:42:16,070
algorithm yeah just by taking himself
out of it seriously I'm not saying don't

know if you look at his followers um
they're almost all right leaning

5188
01:42:23,950 --> 01:42:23,960
they're almost all right leaning
 

5189
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:25,470
they're almost all right leaning
if you look at the people he engages

5190
01:42:25,470 --> 01:42:25,480
if you look at the people he engages
 

5191

engages with negatively like me right I
 

5197
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:35,390
engages with negatively like me right I
consider myself an an independent but it

01:42:35,390 --> 01:42:35,400
consider myself an an independent but it
 

5199
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:38,950
consider myself an an independent but it
I lean left on the Dei topic right um

5200
01:42:38,950 --> 01:42:38,960
I lean left on the Dei topic right um
 

5201
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:41,149
I lean left on the Dei topic right um
that influences the algorithm and so you

5202
01:42:41,149 --> 01:42:41,159
that influences the algorithm and so you
 

5203
01:42:41,159 --> 01:42:44,149
that influences the algorithm and so you
see what you see because of what he says

5204
01:42:44,149 --> 01:42:44,159
see what you see because of what he says
 

5205
01:42:44,159 --> 01:42:47,629
see what you see because of what he says
yeah well I mean for sure but the the

5206
01:42:47,629 --> 01:42:47,639
yeah well I mean for sure but the the
 

5207
01:42:47,639 --> 01:42:49,229
yeah well I mean for sure but the the
there could be a lot of influential

5208
01:42:49,229 --> 01:42:49,239
there could be a lot of influential
 

5209
01:42:49,239 --> 01:42:52,030
there could be a lot of influential
people on on Twitter that influence the

feel it's not even about ideology where

5214
01:42:56,709 --> 01:42:56,719
feel it's not even about ideology where
 

5215
01:42:56,719 --> 01:42:59,470
feel it's not even about ideology where
you lean it's about like the algorithm

5216
01:42:59,470 --> 01:42:59,480
you lean it's about like the algorithm
 

5217
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:04,070
you lean it's about like the algorithm
not prioritizing drama be like the the

5218
01:43:04,070 --> 01:43:04,080
not prioritizing drama be like the the
 

5219
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:07,709
not prioritizing drama be like the the
the attention grabbing thing or the

5220
01:43:07,709 --> 01:43:07,719
the attention grabbing thing or the
 

5221
01:43:07,719 --> 01:43:10,350
the attention grabbing thing or the
lower lizard version of that where like

5222
01:43:10,350 --> 01:43:10,360
lower lizard version of that where like
 

5223
01:43:10,360 --> 01:43:13,310

5226
01:43:15,189 --> 01:43:15,199
when I last read through all the stuff
 

5227
01:43:15,199 --> 01:43:16,750
when I last read through all the stuff
on on their algorithm right maybe it's

5228
01:43:16,750 --> 01:43:16,760
on on their algorithm right maybe it's
 

5229
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:20,310
on on their algorithm right maybe it's
changed Whoever has the biggest account

5230
01:43:20,310 --> 01:43:20,320
changed Whoever has the biggest account
 

5231
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:23,510
changed Whoever has the biggest account
and gets engagement on that account

5232
01:43:23,510 --> 01:43:23,520
and gets engagement on that account
 

5233
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:26,870
and gets engagement on that account
influences what people see the most yeah

5234
01:43:26,870 --> 01:43:26,880
influences what people see the most yeah
 

5235
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:27,830
influences what people see the most yeah
I mean that's interesting I don't know

5236
01:43:27,830 --> 01:43:27,840
I mean that's interesting I don't know
 

5237
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:29,550
I mean that's interesting I don't know
if that's to to the degree that's true

5238
01:43:29,550 --> 01:43:29,560
if that's to to the degree that's true
 

5239
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:30,510
if that's to to the degree that's true
they

5240
01:43:30,510 --> 01:43:30,520
they
 

5241
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:32,510
they
they've Prett sure it's still the case

5242
01:43:32,510 --> 01:43:32,520
they've Prett sure it's still the case
 

5243
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:34,790
they've Prett sure it's still the case
pretty rigorous description of

5244
01:43:34,790 --> 01:43:34,800
pretty rigorous description of
 

5245
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:37,589
pretty rigorous description of
What's um of the way the aor works it's

5246
01:43:37,589 --> 01:43:37,599
What's um of the way the aor works it's
 

5247
01:43:37,599 --> 01:43:38,790
What's um of the way the aor works it's
actually kind of fascinating there's

5248
01:43:38,790 --> 01:43:38,800
actually kind of fascinating there's
 

5249
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:40,430
actually kind of fascinating there's
like clustering of people based on

5250
01:43:40,430 --> 01:43:40,440
like clustering of people based on
 

5251
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:42,030
like clustering of people based on
interest right but I think they call the

5252
01:43:42,030 --> 01:43:42,040
interest right but I think they call the
 

5253
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:44,109
interest right but I think they call the
nearest neighbor right approach and I

5254
01:43:44,109 --> 01:43:44,119
nearest neighbor right approach and I
 

5255
01:43:44,119 --> 01:43:46,149
nearest neighbor right approach and I
think that's what they do and so whoever

5256
01:43:46,149 --> 01:43:46,159
think that's what they do and so whoever
 

5257
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:47,790
think that's what they do and so whoever
has the biggest account has the most

5258
01:43:47,790 --> 01:43:47,800
has the biggest account has the most
 

5259
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:49,070
has the biggest account has the most
neighbors who in turn have their

5260
01:43:49,070 --> 01:43:49,080
neighbors who in turn have their
 

5261
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:50,149
neighbors who in turn have their
neighbors who in turn have their

5262
01:43:50,149 --> 01:43:50,159
neighbors who in turn have their
 

5263
01:43:50,159 --> 01:43:52,709
neighbors who in turn have their
neighbors and that's how they discern

5264
01:43:52,709 --> 01:43:52,719
neighbors and that's how they discern
 

5265
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:54,430
neighbors and that's how they discern
what comes next but there's a clustering

5266
01:43:54,430 --> 01:43:54,440
what comes next but there's a clustering
 

5267
01:43:54,440 --> 01:43:55,870
what comes next but there's a clustering
still so like if you don't give a shit

5268
01:43:55,870 --> 01:43:55,880
still so like if you don't give a shit
 

5269
01:43:55,880 --> 01:43:58,270
still so like if you don't give a shit
about Elon you're not and you're not

5270
01:43:58,270 --> 01:43:58,280
about Elon you're not and you're not
 

5271
01:43:58,280 --> 01:43:59,589
about Elon you're not and you're not
following him yeah you're not you're not

5272
01:43:59,589 --> 01:43:59,599
following him yeah you're not you're not
 

5273
01:43:59,599 --> 01:44:01,390
following him yeah you're not you're not
going to have an influence he's not

5274
01:44:01,390 --> 01:44:01,400
going to have an influence he's not
 

5275
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:02,910
going to have an influence he's not
going to have influence when you get a

5276
01:44:02,910 --> 01:44:02,920
going to have influence when you get a
 

5277
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:04,790
going to have influence when you get a
break just create a burner account on

5278
01:44:04,790 --> 01:44:04,800
break just create a burner account on
 

5279
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:06,550
break just create a burner account on
Twitter and see what who they recommend

5280
01:44:06,550 --> 01:44:06,560
Twitter and see what who they recommend
 

5281
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:09,990
Twitter and see what who they recommend
to you Elon and not just Elon I mean the

5282
01:44:09,990 --> 01:44:10,000
to you Elon and not just Elon I mean the
 

5283
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,510
to you Elon and not just Elon I mean the
people that Elon likes and I'm saying

5284
01:44:12,510 --> 01:44:12,520
people that Elon likes and I'm saying
 

5285
01:44:12,520 --> 01:44:14,550
people that Elon likes and I'm saying
that's not Elon saying add this person

5286
01:44:14,550 --> 01:44:14,560
that's not Elon saying add this person
 

5287
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:16,430
that's not Elon saying add this person
add this person and suggest this person

5288
01:44:16,430 --> 01:44:16,440
add this person and suggest this person
 

5289
01:44:16,440 --> 01:44:18,910
add this person and suggest this person
this person this person I'm saying

5290
01:44:18,910 --> 01:44:18,920
this person this person I'm saying
 

5291
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:19,990
this person this person I'm saying
that's what the algorithm is yeah there

5292
01:44:19,990 --> 01:44:20,000
that's what the algorithm is yeah there
 

5293
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,310
that's what the algorithm is yeah there
should be transparency around that for

5294
01:44:21,310 --> 01:44:21,320
should be transparency around that for
 

5295
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:23,430
should be transparency around that for
sure there is there is that's the whole

5296
01:44:23,430 --> 01:44:23,440
sure there is there is that's the whole
 

5297
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:25,430
sure there is there is that's the whole
point right he knows his transparency

5298
01:44:25,430 --> 01:44:25,440
point right he knows his transparency
 

5299
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:26,990
point right he knows his transparency
and he knows the impact that's why when

5300
01:44:26,990 --> 01:44:27,000
and he knows the impact that's why when
 

5301
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,629
and he knows the impact that's why when
I say take yourself out of the algorithm

5302
01:44:29,629 --> 01:44:29,639
I say take yourself out of the algorithm
 

5303
01:44:29,639 --> 01:44:31,790
I say take yourself out of the algorithm
right don't include his account that

5304
01:44:31,790 --> 01:44:31,800
right don't include his account that
 

5305
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:33,470
right don't include his account that
changes I think the output of the

5306
01:44:33,470 --> 01:44:33,480
changes I think the output of the
 

5307
01:44:33,480 --> 01:44:35,709
changes I think the output of the
algorithm well when he wasn't owning

5308
01:44:35,709 --> 01:44:35,719
algorithm well when he wasn't owning
 

5309
01:44:35,719 --> 01:44:37,070
algorithm well when he wasn't owning
Twitter he was one of the biggest

5310
01:44:37,070 --> 01:44:37,080
Twitter he was one of the biggest
 

5311
01:44:37,080 --> 01:44:38,510
Twitter he was one of the biggest
accounts if not the biggest account

5312
01:44:38,510 --> 01:44:38,520
accounts if not the biggest account
 

5313
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:40,669
accounts if not the biggest account
already it wasn't but still like even

5314
01:44:40,669 --> 01:44:40,679
already it wasn't but still like even
 

5315
01:44:40,679 --> 01:44:42,750
already it wasn't but still like even
like the Kim well the Kim Kardashian

5316
01:44:42,750 --> 01:44:42,760
like the Kim well the Kim Kardashian
 

5317
01:44:42,760 --> 01:44:46,109
like the Kim well the Kim Kardashian
accounts whatever right it would I I

5318
01:44:46,109 --> 01:44:46,119
accounts whatever right it would I I
 

5319
01:44:46,119 --> 01:44:47,990
accounts whatever right it would I I
don't it wasn't open source to elon's

5320
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:48,000
don't it wasn't open source to elon's
 

5321
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,030
don't it wasn't open source to elon's
credit it is now so I couldn't see it to

5322
01:44:50,030 --> 01:44:50,040
credit it is now so I couldn't see it to
 

5323
01:44:50,040 --> 01:44:51,990
credit it is now so I couldn't see it to
know right so I didn't get the sense one

5324
01:44:51,990 --> 01:44:52,000
know right so I didn't get the sense one
 

5325
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,910
know right so I didn't get the sense one
way or the other of one one element

5326
01:44:53,910 --> 01:44:53,920
way or the other of one one element
 

5327
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:55,709
way or the other of one one element
being dominant over the other but

5328
01:44:55,709 --> 01:44:55,719
being dominant over the other but
 

5329
01:44:55,719 --> 01:44:57,750
being dominant over the other but
obviously conservatives felt that that

5330
01:44:57,750 --> 01:44:57,760
obviously conservatives felt that that
 

5331
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:00,030
obviously conservatives felt that that
left leaning was more dominant back then

5332
01:45:00,030 --> 01:45:00,040
left leaning was more dominant back then
 

5333
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:01,550
left leaning was more dominant back then
yeah I would love to see numbers on all

5334
01:45:01,550 --> 01:45:01,560
yeah I would love to see numbers on all
 

5335
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:05,109
yeah I would love to see numbers on all
of this yeah you me both Dei everything

5336
01:45:05,109 --> 01:45:05,119
of this yeah you me both Dei everything
 

5337
01:45:05,119 --> 01:45:08,270
of this yeah you me both Dei everything
like this uh sometimes anecdotal data

5338
01:45:08,270 --> 01:45:08,280
like this uh sometimes anecdotal data
 

5339
01:45:08,280 --> 01:45:10,629
like this uh sometimes anecdotal data
really frustrates me it frustrates me

5340
01:45:10,629 --> 01:45:10,639
really frustrates me it frustrates me
 

5341
01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:13,629
really frustrates me it frustrates me
primarily because of how sexy it is like

5342
01:45:13,629 --> 01:45:13,639
primarily because of how sexy it is like
 

5343
01:45:13,639 --> 01:45:15,149
primarily because of how sexy it is like
people just love it's a great way to

5344
01:45:15,149 --> 01:45:15,159
people just love it's a great way to
 

5345
01:45:15,159 --> 01:45:17,070
people just love it's a great way to
describe it love a story and I'm like

5346
01:45:17,070 --> 01:45:17,080
describe it love a story and I'm like
 

5347
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:19,430
describe it love a story and I'm like
God damn it this is not science this is

5348
01:45:19,430 --> 01:45:19,440
God damn it this is not science this is
 

5349
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:22,229
God damn it this is not science this is
this it's not even common sense you know

5350
01:45:22,229 --> 01:45:22,239
this it's not even common sense you know
 

5351
01:45:22,239 --> 01:45:24,830
this it's not even common sense you know
well no I I I think anecdotal stories

5352
01:45:24,830 --> 01:45:24,840
well no I I I think anecdotal stories
 

5353
01:45:24,840 --> 01:45:27,270
well no I I I think anecdotal stories
often have a wisdom in them like no

5354
01:45:27,270 --> 01:45:27,280
often have a wisdom in them like no
 

5355
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:28,910
often have a wisdom in them like no
doubt right you there's something to be

5356
01:45:28,910 --> 01:45:28,920
doubt right you there's something to be
 

5357
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:31,310
doubt right you there's something to be
gained from from seeing there's a signal

5358
01:45:31,310 --> 01:45:31,320
gained from from seeing there's a signal
 

5359
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:33,350
gained from from seeing there's a signal
there but like how representative is

5360
01:45:33,350 --> 01:45:33,360
there but like how representative is
 

5361
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:35,149
there but like how representative is
that signal of the broader thing there's

5362
01:45:35,149 --> 01:45:35,159
that signal of the broader thing there's
 

5363
01:45:35,159 --> 01:45:36,669
that signal of the broader thing there's
a whole lot more noise than signal more

5364
01:45:36,669 --> 01:45:36,679
a whole lot more noise than signal more
 

5365
01:45:36,679 --> 01:45:38,790
a whole lot more noise than signal more
often than not all right so as I

5366
01:45:38,790 --> 01:45:38,800
often than not all right so as I
 

5367
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:41,189
often than not all right so as I
mentioned Cost Plus drugs there's so

5368
01:45:41,189 --> 01:45:41,199
mentioned Cost Plus drugs there's so
 

5369
01:45:41,199 --> 01:45:43,830
mentioned Cost Plus drugs there's so
many questions I can ask here but uh

5370
01:45:43,830 --> 01:45:43,840
many questions I can ask here but uh
 

5371
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:45,950
many questions I can ask here but uh
what's the big question what's broken

5372
01:45:45,950 --> 01:45:45,960
what's the big question what's broken
 

5373
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:48,270
what's the big question what's broken
about our healthc care system there's no

5374
01:45:48,270 --> 01:45:48,280
about our healthc care system there's no
 

5375
01:45:48,280 --> 01:45:50,189
about our healthc care system there's no
transparency there and when there lack

5376
01:45:50,189 --> 01:45:50,199
transparency there and when there lack
 

5377
01:45:50,199 --> 01:45:52,629
transparency there and when there lack
of transparency leads to lack of trust

5378
01:45:52,629 --> 01:45:52,639

5911
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:27,669
Martin scr to jail and so I was reading
up on that and he increased the price of

5912
01:56:27,669 --> 01:56:27,679
up on that and he increased the price of
 

5913
01:56:27,679 --> 01:56:29,750
up on that and he increased the price of
this drug der Prim I think it was like

5914
01:56:29,750 --> 01:56:29,760
this drug der Prim I think it was like
 

5915
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:32,550
this drug der Prim I think it was like
7,5% or increased a lowcost drug to

5916
01:56:32,550 --> 01:56:32,560
7,5% or increased a lowcost drug to
 

5917
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:34,870
7,5% or increased a lowcost drug to
$7,500 one of those and I'm like well if

5918
01:56:34,870 --> 01:56:34,880
$7,500 one of those and I'm like well if
 

5919
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:36,669
$7,500 one of those and I'm like well if
he can just jack up the price to this

5920
01:56:36,669 --> 01:56:36,679
he can just jack up the price to this
 

5921
01:56:36,679 --> 01:56:38,950
he can just jack up the price to this
drug and charge more and get away with

5922
01:56:38,950 --> 01:56:38,960
drug and charge more and get away with
 

5923
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:40,510
drug and charge more and get away with
it this has to be an incredibly

5924
01:56:40,510 --> 01:56:40,520
it this has to be an incredibly
 

5925
01:56:40,520 --> 01:56:42,069
it this has to be an incredibly
inefficient

5926
01:56:42,069 --> 01:56:42,079
inefficient
 

5927
01:56:42,079 --> 01:56:44,669
inefficient
market and so the question is why is he

5928
01:56:44,669 --> 01:56:44,679
market and so the question is why is he
 

5929
01:56:44,679 --> 01:56:46,990
market and so the question is why is he
able to do it and it was immediately

5930
01:56:46,990 --> 01:56:47,000
able to do it and it was immediately
 

5931
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,390
able to do it and it was immediately
apparent that it was a lack of

5932
01:56:48,390 --> 01:56:48,400
apparent that it was a lack of
 

5933
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:50,310
apparent that it was a lack of
transparency and so can we start a

5934
01:56:50,310 --> 01:56:50,320
transparency and so can we start a
 

5935
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:52,069
transparency and so can we start a
company that is fully transparent with

5936
01:56:52,069 --> 01:56:52,079
company that is fully transparent with
 

5937
01:56:52,079 --> 01:56:54,390
company that is fully transparent with
our cost our markup and our selling

our cost our markup and our selling
 

5939
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:57,709
our cost our markup and our selling
price and see if it works and so we went

5940
01:56:57,709 --> 01:56:57,719
price and see if it works and so we went
 

5941
01:56:57,719 --> 01:56:59,950
price and see if it works and so we went
for it and it took off immediately I

5942
01:56:59,950 --> 01:56:59,960
for it and it took off immediately I
 

5943
01:56:59,960 --> 01:57:01,910

6001
01:57:55,079 --> 01:57:56,950
yeah it is dark but we'll get past that
right because there's a downstream

6002
01:57:56,950 --> 01:57:56,960
right because there's a downstream
 

6003
01:57:56,960 --> 01:57:59,390
right because there's a downstream
impact of all this in the rebates and

6007
01:58:02,159 --> 01:58:05,030
the greediness of those big three pbms
when you go to a local pharmacy here in

01:58:15,480 --> 01:58:19,430
drug that cost
$600 well in the insurance company that

$600 well in the insurance company that
 

6021

$600 the pharmacy first buys that drug
 

6023
01:58:22,599 --> 01:58:26,790
$600 the pharmacy first buys that drug
for probably that price minus 5% so $570

6024

for probably that price minus 5% so $570
 

6025
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:28,430
for probably that price minus 5% so $570
then there's probably a co-pay by the

Coen Mark andri you think AI should be
 

6209
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:52,310
Coen Mark andri you think AI should be
open sourced yeah for sure so like all

good choice for them I think that's a
smart choice right but it's just a

6222
02:02:03,830 --> 02:02:03,840
smart choice right but it's just a

conferences you know it's like the early
 

6241
02:02:22,719 --> 02:02:24,550
conferences you know it's like the early
days of streaming and the internet where

6242
02:02:24,550 --> 02:02:24,560
days of streaming and the internet where
 

6243
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:26,910
days of streaming and the internet where
people Ed the same technology everywhere

decision to is right but go back to
 

6273
02:02:53,880 --> 02:02:56,030
decision to is right but go back to
historically you know there was digital

6274
02:02:56,030 --> 02:02:56,040
historically you know there was digital
 

6275
02:02:56,040 --> 02:02:58,910

and they thought and IBM to a certain
 

6279
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:04,990
and they thought and IBM to a certain
extent um thought that they wouldn't be

6280
02:03:04,990 --> 02:03:05,000
extent um thought that they wouldn't be
 

6281
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,189
extent um thought that they wouldn't be

subject to a problem with the PC
 

6283
02:03:07,199 --> 02:03:09,669
subject to a problem with the PC
industry and then all of a

6284
02:03:09,669 --> 02:03:09,679
industry and then all of a
 

6285
02:03:09,679 --> 02:03:12,270
industry and then all of a
sudden and in with their their main

6286
02:03:12,270 --> 02:03:12,280
sudden and in with their their main
 

6287
02:03:12,280 --> 02:03:13,870

software they wouldn't use offthe shelf

6290
02:03:16,030 --> 02:03:16,040
software they wouldn't use offthe shelf
 

6291
02:03:16,040 --> 02:03:18,390
software they wouldn't use offthe shelf
software right so for a digital

6292
02:03:18,390 --> 02:03:18,400

you needed software that was written for

6296
02:03:22,629 --> 02:03:22,639
you needed software that was written for
 

6297
02:03:22,639 --> 02:03:24,109

it there was nothing off the shelf and
 

6299
02:03:24,119 --> 02:03:26,510
it there was nothing off the shelf and
when the PC industry came along it was

6300
02:03:26,510 --> 02:03:26,520
when the PC industry came along it was
 

6301
02:03:26,520 --> 02:03:28,790
when the PC industry came along it was
the exact opposite there was you know Ms

6302
02:03:28,790 --> 02:03:28,800
the exact opposite there was you know Ms
 

6303
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:30,350
the exact opposite there was you know Ms
Doss and then Windows things that were

6304
02:03:30,350 --> 02:03:30,360
Doss and then Windows things that were
 

6305
02:03:30,360 --> 02:03:32,390
Doss and then Windows things that were
off the shelf that every PC could use

6306
02:03:32,390 --> 02:03:32,400
off the shelf that every PC could use
 

6307
02:03:32,400 --> 02:03:33,790
off the shelf that every PC could use
and that changed how people thought

6308
02:03:33,790 --> 02:03:33,800
and that changed how people thought
 

6309
02:03:33,800 --> 02:03:35,750
and that changed how people thought
about software and I think the same

6310
02:03:35,750 --> 02:03:35,760
about software and I think the same
 

6311
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:37,709
about software and I think the same
thing will happen here where it's going

6312
02:03:37,709 --> 02:03:37,719
thing will happen here where it's going
 

6313
02:03:37,719 --> 02:03:41,470
thing will happen here where it's going
to be um as models become more efficient

6314
02:03:41,470 --> 02:03:41,480
to be um as models become more efficient
 

6315
02:03:41,480 --> 02:03:44,390
to be um as models become more efficient
and easier and less expensive to train

6316
02:03:44,390 --> 02:03:44,400
and easier and less expensive to train
 

6317
02:03:44,400 --> 02:03:47,270
and easier and less expensive to train
um I think there'll be more more reasons

6318
02:03:47,270 --> 02:03:47,280
um I think there'll be more more reasons
 

6319
02:03:47,280 --> 02:03:50,189
um I think there'll be more more reasons
to open source yeah that's the hope it

6320
02:03:50,189 --> 02:03:50,199
to open source yeah that's the hope it
 

6321
02:03:50,199 --> 02:03:51,629
to open source yeah that's the hope it
creates more competition and a lot of

6322
02:03:51,629 --> 02:03:51,639
creates more competition and a lot of
 

6323
02:03:51,639 --> 02:03:52,750
creates more competition and a lot of

6328
02:03:56,870 --> 02:03:56,880
approaches uh in how they're implemented
 

6329
02:03:56,880 --> 02:03:58,149
approaches uh in how they're implemented
deployed what kind of products they

6330
02:03:58,149 --> 02:03:58,159
deployed what kind of products they
 

6331
02:03:58,159 --> 02:04:01,430
deployed what kind of products they
create all of that V compared the danger

6332
02:04:01,430 --> 02:04:01,440
create all of that V compared the danger
 

6333
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:04,229

6405
02:05:30,599 --> 02:05:32,069
version of of meta's Open Source I just
don't I there's just that would be

6406
02:05:32,069 --> 02:05:32,079
don't I there's just that would be

you're going to see each of them have
 

6411
02:05:36,679 --> 02:05:38,750
you're going to see each of them have
their own models and update them as they

6412
02:05:38,750 --> 02:05:38,760
their own models and update them as they
 

6413
02:05:38,760 --> 02:05:41,830
their own models and update them as they
go and license them yeah and yeah make

6414
02:05:41,830 --> 02:05:41,840
go and license them yeah and yeah make
 

6415
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:44,549
go and license them yeah and yeah make
