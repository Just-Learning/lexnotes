Lex we got to uh talk about where we are

108
00:02:17,869 --> 00:02:17,879
Lex we got to uh talk about where we are
 

109
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,229
Lex we got to uh talk about where we are
in the political spectrum and uh in fact

110
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:20,239
in the political spectrum and uh in fact
 

111
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,949
in the political spectrum and uh in fact
there's two different uh spectrums now

112
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:22,959
there's two different uh spectrums now
 

113
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,110
there's two different uh spectrums now
people often think of left right uh and

114
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,120
people often think of left right uh and
 

115
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,710
people often think of left right uh and
that's true that exists but layered on

116
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:27,720
that's true that exists but layered on
 

117
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,229
that's true that exists but layered on
top of that is now populist versus

118
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:30,239
top of that is now populist versus
 

119
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,750
top of that is now populist versus
establishment

120
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:31,760
establishment
 

121
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,390
establishment
so I'm Center left on the Left Right

122
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:35,400
so I'm Center left on the Left Right
 

123
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,949
so I'm Center left on the Left Right
Spectrum um but I'm all the way on the

124
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:38,959
Spectrum um but I'm all the way on the
 

125
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,149
Spectrum um but I'm all the way on the
populist end of of the second Spectrum

126
00:02:42,149 --> 00:02:42,159
populist end of of the second Spectrum
 

127
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:44,670
populist end of of the second Spectrum
so where does progressivism lie within

128
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:44,680
so where does progressivism lie within
 

129
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,270
so where does progressivism lie within
that well uh I would argue that it's

130
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:48,280
that well uh I would argue that it's
 

131
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,589
that well uh I would argue that it's
exactly in those places it's populist uh

132
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:51,599
exactly in those places it's populist uh
 

133
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,110
exactly in those places it's populist uh
and it's on the left but it is not

134
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:54,120
and it's on the left but it is not
 

135
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,390
and it's on the left but it is not
far-left so far-left is a different

136
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:56,400
far-left so far-left is a different
 

137
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,990
far-left so far-left is a different
animal and we could talk about that in a

138
00:02:58,990 --> 00:02:59,000
animal and we could talk about that in a
 

139
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,830
animal and we could talk about that in a
little bit so so in terms of what makes

140
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:01,840
little bit so so in terms of what makes
 

141
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,589
little bit so so in terms of what makes
a progressive so expand the circle of

297
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,350
I I'm on the right I'm on the left and
that comes with a certain preset

298
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,360
that comes with a certain preset
 

299
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,070
that comes with a certain preset
ideology so the right is always correct

300
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,080
ideology so the right is always correct
 

301
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,270
ideology so the right is always correct
the left is always correct so there's

302
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:06,280
the left is always correct so there's
 

303
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,469
the left is always correct so there's
two problems with that number one how

304
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:08,479
two problems with that number one how
 

305
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,029
two problems with that number one how
could you possibly believe in a preset

306

could you possibly believe in a preset
 

307
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,710
could you possibly believe in a preset
ideology if you're an independent

308

311
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,550
thinker it's literally by definition not
possible if you say I lent my brain to

312
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:18,560
possible if you say I lent my brain to
 

313
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,110

what I call corporatism so you have to

406
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:09,199
what I call corporatism so you have to
 

407
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,710
what I call corporatism so you have to
get to a balance in order to get to the

408
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:10,720
get to a balance in order to get to the
 

409
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,070
get to a balance in order to get to the
right answer so that's an interesting

410
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,080
right answer so that's an interesting
 

411
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,990
right answer so that's an interesting
distinction here so you're actually as

412
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,000
distinction here so you're actually as
 

413
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,350
distinction here so you're actually as
far as I understand Pro capitalism yes

414
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:16,360

which is an interesting place to be
 

417
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,390
which is an interesting place to be
that's the thing that probably makes you

418
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,400
that's the thing that probably makes you
 

419
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,309
that's the thing that probably makes you
Center left and then still populist

420
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:24,319
Center left and then still populist
 

421
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,749

you're you're full of uh beautiful

422
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:25,759
you're you're full of uh beautiful
 

423
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,390
you're you're full of uh beautiful
contradictions that say this which will

424
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:27,400
contradictions that say this which will
 

425
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,710
contradictions that say this which will
be great to untangle but what what's the

426
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:29,720
be great to untangle but what what's the
 

427
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,149
be great to untangle but what what's the
difference between corporatism and

428
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:32,159
difference between corporatism and
 

429
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,790
difference between corporatism and
capitalism is there a difference yeah

430
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:34,800
capitalism is there a difference yeah
 

431
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,790
capitalism is there a difference yeah
so I I really believe in capitalism I I

432
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:37,800
so I I really believe in capitalism I I
 

433
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,709
so I I really believe in capitalism I I
don't think that there's really a second

434
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:39,719
don't think that there's really a second
 

435
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,630
don't think that there's really a second
choice um the in where it gets super

436
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:42,640
choice um the in where it gets super
 

437
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,670
choice um the in where it gets super
interesting is the distinction between

438
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:44,680
interesting is the distinction between
 

439
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,990
interesting is the distinction between
capitalism and socialism because that's

440
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:47,000
capitalism and socialism because that's
 

441
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,949
capitalism and socialism because that's
not at all as clear as people think it

442
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:48,959
not at all as clear as people think it
 

443
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,949
not at all as clear as people think it
is and people often say socialism and

444
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:51,959
is and people often say socialism and
 

445
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,230
is and people often say socialism and
communism as synonms when they're not

446
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
communism as synonms when they're not
 

447
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,590
communism as synonms when they're not
synonyms right and so I view it as

448
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:58,600
synonyms right and so I view it as
 

449
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,870
synonyms right and so I view it as
there's basically four uh distinct areas

450
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:01,880
there's basically four uh distinct areas
 

451
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,230
there's basically four uh distinct areas
it's obviously a spectrum everything is

452
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:03,240
it's obviously a spectrum everything is
 

453
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,389
it's obviously a spectrum everything is
a spectrum right on one end you have

454
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:05,399
a spectrum right on one end you have
 

455
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,470
a spectrum right on one end you have
communism on the left and on the other

456
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:07,480
communism on the left and on the other
 

457
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,630
communism on the left and on the other
end you have corporatism on the right

458
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:09,640
end you have corporatism on the right
 

459
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,550
end you have corporatism on the right
okay and I would argue that capitalism

460
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:11,560
okay and I would argue that capitalism
 

461
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,990
okay and I would argue that capitalism
is in the middle and so communism we

462
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:15,000
is in the middle and so communism we
 

463
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,630
is in the middle and so communism we
know uh State owns all property you're

464
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:18,640
know uh State owns all property you're
 

465
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,110
know uh State owns all property you're
not allowed to have private property so

466
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,120
not allowed to have private property so
 

467
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,509
not allowed to have private property so
I will piss off a lot of people in this

468
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:23,519

475
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,190

other side too okay so communism makes

476
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:34,200
other side too okay so communism makes
 

477
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,790
other side too okay so communism makes
no sense at all totally opposed to human

478
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:36,800
no sense at all totally opposed to human
 

479
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,790
no sense at all totally opposed to human
nature it never works it always evolves

480
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:39,800
nature it never works it always evolves
 

481
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,230
nature it never works it always evolves
into dictatorship because it is not

482
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:43,240
into dictatorship because it is not
 

483
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,870
into dictatorship because it is not
built for human nature it we're never

484
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:45,880
built for human nature it we're never
 

485
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,110
built for human nature it we're never
going to act like that it's not in our

486
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:48,120
going to act like that it's not in our
 

487
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,670
going to act like that it's not in our
DNA you could try to wish it into

488
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:50,680
DNA you could try to wish it into
 

489
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,949
DNA you could try to wish it into
existence and they have and it never

490
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:52,959
existence and they have and it never
 

491
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,350
existence and they have and it never
works and it's because once you have

492
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:56,360
works and it's because once you have
 

493
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,790
works and it's because once you have
almost no rules in terms of uh oh all

494
00:09:59,790 --> 00:09:59,800
almost no rules in terms of uh oh all
 

495
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,069
almost no rules in terms of uh oh all
equal and even though communism

496
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:02,079
equal and even though communism
 

497
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,310
equal and even though communism
eventually winds up having an enormous

498
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:04,320
eventually winds up having an enormous
 

499
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,710
eventually winds up having an enormous
amount of rules right uh it creates a

500
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:07,720
amount of rules right uh it creates a
 

501
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,069
amount of rules right uh it creates a
power vacuum when you say hey there's no

502
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:10,079
power vacuum when you say hey there's no
 

503
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,389
power vacuum when you say hey there's no
structure of power here right we're all

504
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:12,399
structure of power here right we're all
 

505
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,430
structure of power here right we're all
equal it's a flat line one guy usually

506
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:15,440
equal it's a flat line one guy usually
 

507
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,069
equal it's a flat line one guy usually
gets up because that's human nature and

508
00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:17,079
gets up because that's human nature and
 

509
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:19,949
gets up because that's human nature and
goes uh I don't think so I think if

510
00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:19,959
goes uh I don't think so I think if
 

511
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:21,670
goes uh I don't think so I think if
you're going to leave a power vacuum I'm

512
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:21,680
you're going to leave a power vacuum I'm
 

513
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,550
you're going to leave a power vacuum I'm
going to take that power vacuum that's

514
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:23,560
going to take that power vacuum that's
 

515
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,069
going to take that power vacuum that's
actually a really interesting way to put

516
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:25,079
actually a really interesting way to put
 

517
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:29,590
actually a really interesting way to put
it because when everyone is equal nobody

518
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:29,600
it because when everyone is equal nobody
 

519
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,670
it because when everyone is equal nobody
is in power and human nature is such

520
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:31,680
is in power and human nature is such
 

521
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,030
is in power and human nature is such
that there's everybody's there's a Will

522
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,040
that there's everybody's there's a Will
 

523
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,509
that there's everybody's there's a Will
To Power so when you create a power

524
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:34,519
To Power so when you create a power
 

525
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:37,030
To Power so when you create a power
vacuum somebody's going to to fill it so

526
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,040
vacuum somebody's going to to fill it so
 

527
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,790
vacuum somebody's going to to fill it so
the alternative is to have people in

528
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:39,800
the alternative is to have people in
 

529
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,949
the alternative is to have people in
power but there's a balance of power and

530
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:41,959
power but there's a balance of power and
 

531
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:43,550
power but there's a balance of power and
then there's like a democratic system

532
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:43,560
then there's like a democratic system
 

533
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,269
then there's like a democratic system
that elects the people in power and

534
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:45,279
that elects the people in power and
 

535
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,389
that elects the people in power and
keeps churning and rotating who's inv

536
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:47,399
keeps churning and rotating who's inv
 

537
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,430
keeps churning and rotating who's inv
that is exactly it Lex you got it

538
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:49,440
that is exactly it Lex you got it
 

539
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,710
that is exactly it Lex you got it
exactly right in my opinion okay so

540
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:51,720
exactly right in my opinion okay so
 

541
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,389
exactly right in my opinion okay so
that's why communism never works and can

542
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:54,399
that's why communism never works and can
 

543
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,590
that's why communism never works and can
never work so they it it's an idea of

544
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:58,600
never work so they it it's an idea of
 

545
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,470
never work so they it it's an idea of
like we're all going to work as hard as

546
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:00,480
like we're all going to work as hard as
 

547
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,590
like we're all going to work as hard as
we possibly can and take only what we

548
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:02,600
we possibly can and take only what we
 

549
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,629
we possibly can and take only what we
need where when when has that ever

550
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:05,639
need where when when has that ever
 

551
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,470
need where when when has that ever
happened in the history of humanity

552
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:07,480
happened in the history of humanity
 

553
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,990
happened in the history of humanity
right we're just not built that way so

554
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,000
right we're just not built that way so
 

555
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,750
right we're just not built that way so
okay we can get into that debate with my

556
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,760
okay we can get into that debate with my
 

557
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,389
okay we can get into that debate with my
friends on the left Etc now corporatism

depending on the project so when people

1272
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:19,480
depending on the project so when people
 

1273
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,630
depending on the project so when people
say are you in favor of Regulation or

1274

is a regulation right so uh my idea is a
 

1283
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,310
is a regulation right so uh my idea is a
simple one and one we're going to keep

1284
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:35,320
simple one and one we're going to keep

coming back to balance so when my dad

1286
00:25:37,909 --> 00:25:37,919
coming back to balance so when my dad
 

1287
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,630
coming back to balance so when my dad
was a small business owner in New Jersey

and and they inspected the elevator six
 

1291
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,269
and and they inspected the elevator six
times a year that was overregulation and

times a year that was overregulation and
 

1293
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:48,070
times a year that was overregulation and
I said to my dad so should they not

1298
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:51,880
growing up and he said no no you got to
 

1299
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,750
growing up and he said no no you got to
inspect it at least twice a year I said

1300
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:53,760
inspect it at least twice a year I said
 

1301
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,950
inspect it at least twice a year I said
why he said because in Turkey sometimes

1302
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:55,960
why he said because in Turkey sometimes
 

1303
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,190
why he said because in Turkey sometimes
they don't inspect it and then the

1304
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:57,200
they don't inspect it and then the
 

1305
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,190

00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:10,520
especially in for example in Tech
 

1317
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,149
especially in for example in Tech
something I'm much more familiar with is

1318
00:26:12,149 --> 00:26:12,159
something I'm much more familiar with is
 

1319
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,630
something I'm much more familiar with is
very difficult because uh people in

1320
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:14,640
very difficult because uh people in
 

1321

century before the internet was uh uh
 

1325
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,630
century before the internet was uh uh
invented so like how are they supposed

1326
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:22,640
invented so like how are they supposed
 

1327
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,710
invented so like how are they supposed
to come up with regulations yeah that's

should be able to sort of compete the
 

1333
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,750
should be able to sort of compete the
market regulates and then the government

1334
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:30,760
market regulates and then the government
 

1335
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,070
market regulates and then the government
can step in and protect uh the market

1336
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,080
can step in and protect uh the market
 

1337
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,990
can step in and protect uh the market
from forming monopolies for example

which is easier to do yeah but that's a
 

1341
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,110
which is easier to do yeah but that's a
form of Regulation right but then

1342
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:39,120
form of Regulation right but then
 

1343
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,269
form of Regulation right but then
there's like more check in the elevator

the politicians but it seems like our
 

2369
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,390
the politicians but it seems like our
current system and the megaphone that a

00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:15,720
as I am and uh and it's because he took
 

2443
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:19,190
as I am and uh and it's because he took
a populist movement and he redirected it

5,000 is too high but those are fine
 

2755
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,430
5,000 is too high but those are fine
debates yeah you know but you basically

2756
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:06,440
debates yeah you know but you basically
 

2757
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,430
debates yeah you know but you basically
want to create an incentive everything

2758
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:08,440

2761
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,950
is about incentives and disincentives
again capitalists realize this better

2762
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:11,960
again capitalists realize this better
 

2763
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,309
again capitalists realize this better
than anyone else right so you want to

2764
00:54:14,309 --> 00:54:14,319
than anyone else right so you want to
 

2765
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:17,390
than anyone else right so you want to
set up an incentive to serve your voters

2766
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:17,400
set up an incentive to serve your voters
 

2767
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,630
set up an incentive to serve your voters
not your donors so if you take away

2768
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:19,640
not your donors so if you take away
 

2769
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,549
not your donors so if you take away
private donors well there goes that

2770
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:21,559
private donors well there goes that
 

2771
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:23,950
private donors well there goes that
incentive and that's gigantic right and

2772
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:23,960
incentive and that's gigantic right and
 

2773
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,390
incentive and that's gigantic right and
then if you set up small Grassroots

2774
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:26,400
then if you set up small Grassroots
 

2775
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,750
then if you set up small Grassroots
funding is a way to get past the

2776
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:27,760
funding is a way to get past the
 

2777
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,589
funding is a way to get past the
threshold to get the funding to run an

2778
00:54:30,589 --> 00:54:30,599
threshold to get the funding to run an
 

2779
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:32,829
threshold to get the funding to run an
election well then good because then

2780
00:54:32,829 --> 00:54:32,839
election well then good because then
 

2781
00:54:32,839 --> 00:54:34,829
election well then good because then
you're serving small donors which are

2782
00:54:34,829 --> 00:54:34,839
you're serving small donors which are
 

2783
00:54:34,839 --> 00:54:37,789
you're serving small donors which are
generally voters right so that's what

2784
00:54:37,789 --> 00:54:37,799
generally voters right so that's what
 

2785
00:54:37,799 --> 00:54:40,789
generally voters right so that's what
you want and ending private financing is

2786
00:54:40,789 --> 00:54:40,799
you want and ending private financing is
 

2787

critical but the second thing is ending
 

2789
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:45,510
critical but the second thing is ending

3056
01:00:03,109 --> 01:00:03,119
right balance and in order to do that
 

3057
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:05,510
right balance and in order to do that
like if you say well if we change the

3058
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:05,520
like if you say well if we change the
 

3059
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,789
like if you say well if we change the
system I'm afraid of change because what

if the pendulum swings too far in the

01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:10,720
if the pendulum swings too far in the
 

3063
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,190
if the pendulum swings too far in the
other direction right well then you

3064
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:13,200
other direction right well then you
 

3065
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:16,270
other direction right well then you
would be opposed to change at all times

3066
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:16,280
would be opposed to change at all times
 

3067

the old days now it's a little bit
 

3943

the old days now it's a little bit
different because of online media but

3944
01:18:15,669 --> 01:18:15,679
different because of online media but
 

3945
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:17,709
different because of online media but
especially 10 years ago and remember we

3946
01:18:17,709 --> 01:18:17,719
especially 10 years ago and remember we
 

3947
01:18:17,719 --> 01:18:20,270
especially 10 years ago and remember we
started 22 years ago so I've Been Losing

3948
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:20,280
started 22 years ago so I've Been Losing

My Mind Over how obvious corporate media

3950
01:18:22,669 --> 01:18:22,679
My Mind Over how obvious corporate media
 

3951
01:18:22,679 --> 01:18:25,149
My Mind Over how obvious corporate media
corruption has been for decades now

3952
01:18:25,149 --> 01:18:25,159
corruption has been for decades now
 

3953
01:18:25,159 --> 01:18:27,030
corruption has been for decades now
right but no one acknowledged it until

3954
01:18:27,030 --> 01:18:27,040
right but no one acknowledged it until
 

3955
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:29,189
right but no one acknowledged it until
online media got stronger but one of the

3956
01:18:29,189 --> 01:18:29,199
online media got stronger but one of the
 

3957
01:18:29,199 --> 01:18:31,790
online media got stronger but one of the
myths that corporate media creates is

3958
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:31,800
myths that corporate media creates is
 

3959
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:34,110
myths that corporate media creates is
the myth of meritocracy not that

3960
01:18:34,110 --> 01:18:34,120
the myth of meritocracy not that
 

3961
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:36,470
the myth of meritocracy not that
meritocracy can't exist or shouldn't

3962
01:18:36,470 --> 01:18:36,480
meritocracy can't exist or shouldn't
 

3963
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:39,950
meritocracy can't exist or shouldn't
exist but they pretend it exists today

3964
01:18:39,950 --> 01:18:39,960
exist but they pretend it exists today
 

3965
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:42,990
exist but they pretend it exists today
so the problem with that myth Lex is

3966
01:18:42,990 --> 01:18:43,000
so the problem with that myth Lex is
 

3967
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,870
so the problem with that myth Lex is
that it gets people thinking well if

3968
01:18:44,870 --> 01:18:44,880
that it gets people thinking well if
 

3969
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:47,189
that it gets people thinking well if
they're already rich they must have

3970
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:47,199
they're already rich they must have
 

3971
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:50,950
they're already rich they must have
merited it by definition so all the rich

3972
01:18:50,950 --> 01:18:50,960
merited it by definition so all the rich
 

3973
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:54,830
merited it by definition so all the rich
have Merit and the reverse of that if if

3974
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:54,840
have Merit and the reverse of that if if
 

3975
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:56,709
have Merit and the reverse of that if if
you're poor middle class well you must

3976
01:18:56,709 --> 01:18:56,719
you're poor middle class well you must
 

3977
01:18:56,719 --> 01:19:00,110
you're poor middle class well you must
not have merited wealth so you're no

3978
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:00,120
not have merited wealth so you're no
 

3979
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:02,550
not have merited wealth so you're no
good we don't have to listen to you and

3980
01:19:02,550 --> 01:19:02,560
good we don't have to listen to you and
 

3981
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:06,629
good we don't have to listen to you and
that's a really dangerous awful idea and

3982
01:19:06,629 --> 01:19:06,639
that's a really dangerous awful idea and
 

3983
01:19:06,639 --> 01:19:10,070
that's a really dangerous awful idea and
so if we get to a de meritocracy one day

3984
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:10,080
so if we get to a de meritocracy one day
 

3985
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:11,709
so if we get to a de meritocracy one day

contradiction to that why did she
 

4633
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:47,990
contradiction to that why did she
propose to raise the the corporate uh

4639
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:55,990
because that's easy because that is
something that's super popular and she's

she will not increase corporate taxes so
 

4735
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:40,310
she will not increase corporate taxes so
would the same be the case for Price

4736
01:33:40,310 --> 01:33:40,320
would the same be the case for Price
 

4737
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:42,709
would the same be the case for Price
controls or the anti- price gouging that

4738
01:33:42,709 --> 01:33:42,719
controls or the anti- price gouging that
 

4739
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:44,189
controls or the anti- price gouging that
she's supposing it's not price controls

4740
01:33:44,189 --> 01:33:44,199
she's supposing it's not price controls
 

4741
01:33:44,199 --> 01:33:46,950
she's supposing it's not price controls
it's price G anti price gouging it it is

4742
01:33:46,950 --> 01:33:46,960
it's price G anti price gouging it it is
 

4743
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:49,310
it's price G anti price gouging it it is
price controls but I mean minimum wages

4744
01:33:49,310 --> 01:33:49,320
price controls but I mean minimum wages
 

4745
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:51,189
price controls but I mean minimum wages
price controls also now we're going to

4746
01:33:51,189 --> 01:33:51,199
price controls also now we're going to
 

4747
01:33:51,199 --> 01:33:52,950
price controls also now we're going to
get into a lot of minutia but I'll try

4748
01:33:52,950 --> 01:33:52,960
get into a lot of minutia but I'll try
 

4749
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:54,270
get into a lot of minutia but I'll try
to keep it Broad

4750
01:33:54,270 --> 01:33:54,280
to keep it Broad
 

4751
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:57,070
to keep it Broad
so price controls are a disaster they

4752
01:33:57,070 --> 01:33:57,080
so price controls are a disaster they
 

4753
01:33:57,080 --> 01:33:59,990
so price controls are a disaster they
never work if you say oh here's a banana

4754
01:33:59,990 --> 01:34:00,000
never work if you say oh here's a banana
 

4755
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,950
never work if you say oh here's a banana
it has to stay at a dollar a pound make

4756
01:34:01,950 --> 01:34:01,960
it has to stay at a dollar a pound make
 

4757
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:04,390
it has to stay at a dollar a pound make
up a number right well Supply and

4758
01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:04,400
up a number right well Supply and
 

4759
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,350
up a number right well Supply and
demand's going to move and then that's

4760
01:34:06,350 --> 01:34:06,360
demand's going to move and then that's
 

4761
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:07,830
demand's going to move and then that's
going to and so the minute it moves to

4762
01:34:07,830 --> 01:34:07,840
going to and so the minute it moves to
 

4763
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:10,350
going to and so the minute it moves to
$2 where the price should be then you're

4764
01:34:10,350 --> 01:34:10,360
$2 where the price should be then you're
 

4765
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:11,830
$2 where the price should be then you're
going to run into shortages so we all

4766
01:34:11,830 --> 01:34:11,840
going to run into shortages so we all
 

4767
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:14,950
going to run into shortages so we all
know this it's a bad idea right but are

4768
01:34:14,950 --> 01:34:14,960

valve so the system keeps going is it

5176
01:42:01,070 --> 01:42:01,080
valve so the system keeps going is it
 

5177
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:05,470
valve so the system keeps going is it
possible to steal man the case that

5178
01:42:05,470 --> 01:42:05,480
possible to steal man the case that
 

5179
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:07,870
possible to steal man the case that

I'm saying like they have zero control
 

5193
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:22,950
I'm saying like they have zero control
over me um maybe you could say that's

5194
01:42:22,950 --> 01:42:22,960
over me um maybe you could say that's
 

5195
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:24,589
over me um maybe you could say that's
not that's because it's not a lot of

01:42:24,589 --> 01:42:24,599
not that's because it's not a lot of
 

5197
01:42:24,599 --> 01:42:29,350
not that's because it's not a lot of
money or maybe maybe I'm a unique person

5198
01:42:29,350 --> 01:42:29,360
money or maybe maybe I'm a unique person

01:49:09,080 --> 01:49:10,390
people so you see the Spectrum even if
you think Trump's not on that end and

5532
01:49:10,390 --> 01:49:10,400
you think Trump's not on that end and
 

5533
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:11,750
you think Trump's not on that end and
you think I'm wrong about that you get

5534
01:49:11,750 --> 01:49:11,760
you think I'm wrong about that you get
 

5535
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:13,750
you think I'm wrong about that you get
that there are people on that end right

5536
01:49:13,750 --> 01:49:13,760
that there are people on that end right
 

5537
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:16,310
that there are people on that end right
so you have a spectrum of Integrity

5538
01:49:16,310 --> 01:49:16,320
so you have a spectrum of Integrity
 

5539
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:18,550
so you have a spectrum of Integrity
empathy Etc that's what I would call

5540
01:49:18,550 --> 01:49:18,560
empathy Etc that's what I would call
 

5541
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:21,229
empathy Etc that's what I would call
your Hardware you layer on top of that

5542
01:49:21,229 --> 01:49:21,239
your Hardware you layer on top of that
 

5543
01:49:21,239 --> 01:49:23,470
your Hardware you layer on top of that
your software okay the software is

5603
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:41,109
Bernie they're on the same part of that
that Spectrum right but for most people

5604
01:50:41,109 --> 01:50:41,119
that Spectrum right but for most people
 

5605
01:50:41,119 --> 01:50:43,069
that Spectrum right but for most people
the great majority of the spectrum if

5606
01:50:43,069 --> 01:50:43,079
the great majority of the spectrum if
 

5607
01:50:43,079 --> 01:50:44,950
the great majority of the spectrum if
you overload them with software that

5608
01:50:44,950 --> 01:50:44,960
you overload them with software that
 

5609
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:47,830
you overload them with software that
incentivizes them to not have integrity

5610
01:50:47,830 --> 01:50:47,840
incentivizes them to not have integrity
 

5611
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:50,669
incentivizes them to not have integrity
they will succumb and now let's switch

5612
01:50:50,669 --> 01:50:50,679
they will succumb and now let's switch
 

5613
01:50:50,679 --> 01:50:52,950
they will succumb and now let's switch
to politicians in particular why why do

01:50:52,950 --> 01:50:52,960
to politicians in particular why why do
 

5615
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:56,229
to politicians in particular why why do
I think that they're on average far more

5616
01:50:56,229 --> 01:50:56,239
I think that they're on average far more
 

5617
01:50:56,239 --> 01:50:58,430
I think that they're on average far more
likely to be on the sociopathic part of

01:50:58,430 --> 01:50:58,440
likely to be on the sociopathic part of
 

5619
01:50:58,440 --> 01:50:59,270
likely to be on the sociopathic part of
the

5620
01:50:59,270 --> 01:50:59,280
the
 

5621
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:02,390
the
spectrum because of the incentives and

5622
01:51:02,390 --> 01:51:02,400
spectrum because of the incentives and
 

5623
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:04,589
spectrum because of the incentives and
disincentives so this changes every

5624
01:51:04,589 --> 01:51:04,599
disincentives so this changes every
 

5625
01:51:04,599 --> 01:51:06,910
disincentives so this changes every
Congressional cycle and when just

5626
01:51:06,910 --> 01:51:06,920
Congressional cycle and when just
 

5627
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:08,669
Congressional cycle and when just
Democrats were winning a lot it got all

5628
01:51:08,669 --> 01:51:08,679
Democrats were winning a lot it got all
 

5629
01:51:08,679 --> 01:51:09,870
Democrats were winning a lot it got all
the way down to

5630
01:51:09,870 --> 01:51:09,880
the way down to
 

5631
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:12,669
the way down to
87.5% but on average for Congressional

5632
01:51:12,669 --> 01:51:12,679
87.5% but on average for Congressional
 

5633
01:51:12,679 --> 01:51:14,750
87.5% but on average for Congressional
elections the person with more money

5634
01:51:14,750 --> 01:51:14,760
elections the person with more money
 

5635
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:17,669
elections the person with more money
wins 95% of the time it doesn't matter

5636
01:51:17,669 --> 01:51:17,679
wins 95% of the time it doesn't matter
 

5637
01:51:17,679 --> 01:51:18,990
wins 95% of the time it doesn't matter
if they're a liberal or conservative

5638
01:51:18,990 --> 01:51:19,000
if they're a liberal or conservative
 

5639
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,669
if they're a liberal or conservative
republican or democrat or any ideology

5640
01:51:21,669 --> 01:51:21,679
republican or democrat or any ideology
 

5641
01:51:21,679 --> 01:51:23,350
republican or democrat or any ideology
they have

5642
01:51:23,350 --> 01:51:23,360
they have
 

5643
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:26,629
they have
95% okay so now let's say you got the 5%

5644
01:51:26,629 --> 01:51:26,639
95% okay so now let's say you got the 5%
 

5645
01:51:26,639 --> 01:51:29,149
95% okay so now let's say you got the 5%
that went in uh that are not hooked on

5646
01:51:29,149 --> 01:51:29,159
that went in uh that are not hooked on
 

5647
01:51:29,159 --> 01:51:31,470
that went in uh that are not hooked on
the money well they're going to get a

5648
01:51:31,470 --> 01:51:31,480
the money well they're going to get a
 

5649
01:51:31,480 --> 01:51:32,750
the money well they're going to get a
primary challenge then they're going to

5650
01:51:32,750 --> 01:51:32,760
primary challenge then they're going to
 

5651
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:35,430
primary challenge then they're going to
get a general election Challenge and 95%

5652
01:51:35,430 --> 01:51:35,440
get a general election Challenge and 95%
 

5653
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:37,550
get a general election Challenge and 95%
of the time the one with more money wins

5654
01:51:37,550 --> 01:51:37,560
of the time the one with more money wins
 

5655
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:40,310
of the time the one with more money wins
So eventually this system Cycles through

5656
01:51:40,310 --> 01:51:40,320
So eventually this system Cycles through
 

5657
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:42,390
So eventually this system Cycles through
until only the cor almost only the

5658
01:51:42,390 --> 01:51:42,400
until only the cor almost only the
 

5659
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:44,589
until only the cor almost only the
corrupt are left wait hold on a second

5660
01:51:44,589 --> 01:51:44,599
corrupt are left wait hold on a second
 

5661
01:51:44,599 --> 01:51:47,790
corrupt are left wait hold on a second
is that is that real 95% so if you have

5662
01:51:47,790 --> 01:51:47,800
is that is that real 95% so if you have
 

5663
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:50,189
is that is that real 95% so if you have
more

5664
01:51:50,189 --> 01:51:50,199

 

5665
01:51:50,199 --> 01:51:55,310

money 95% of the time you win huh

5666
01:51:55,310 --> 01:51:55,320
money 95% of the time you win huh
 

5667
01:51:55,320 --> 01:51:59,229
money 95% of the time you win huh
yes I'd like to believe that's less the

5668
01:51:59,229 --> 01:51:59,239
yes I'd like to believe that's less the
 

5669
01:51:59,239 --> 01:52:02,350
yes I'd like to believe that's less the
case for for example for higher you get

5670
01:52:02,350 --> 01:52:02,360
case for for example for higher you get
 

5671
01:52:02,360 --> 01:52:04,350
case for for example for higher you get
yes that's true you're right so you know

5672
01:52:04,350 --> 01:52:04,360
yes that's true you're right so you know
 

5673
01:52:04,360 --> 01:52:06,870
yes that's true you're right so you know
why so the presidential race is

5674
01:52:06,870 --> 01:52:06,880
why so the presidential race is
 

5675
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:09,149
why so the presidential race is
Ironically in some ways the least

5676
01:52:09,149 --> 01:52:09,159
Ironically in some ways the least
 

5677
01:52:09,159 --> 01:52:13,149
Ironically in some ways the least
corrupt so let's dive into why if you're

5678
01:52:13,149 --> 01:52:13,159
corrupt so let's dive into why if you're
 

5679
01:52:13,159 --> 01:52:15,229
corrupt so let's dive into why if you're
running a local race anywhere in the

5680
01:52:15,229 --> 01:52:15,239
running a local race anywhere in the
 

5681
01:52:15,239 --> 01:52:16,550
running a local race anywhere in the
country you're going to get almost no

5682
01:52:16,550 --> 01:52:16,560
country you're going to get almost no
 

5683
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:17,870
country you're going to get almost no
press conference meaning a congressional

5684
01:52:17,870 --> 01:52:17,880
press conference meaning a congressional
 

5685
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:20,310
press conference meaning a congressional

prosecuted in the different
 

5949
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:23,669
prosecuted in the different
states and so the idea as the Republican

5950
01:57:23,669 --> 01:57:23,679
states and so the idea as the Republican
 

5951
01:57:23,679 --> 01:57:26,709
states and so the idea as the Republican
legislator legislators then go we're

5952
01:57:26,709 --> 01:57:26,719
legislator legislators then go we're
 

5953
01:57:26,719 --> 01:57:29,430

sending these new electors in and we

5954
01:57:29,430 --> 01:57:29,440
sending these new electors in and we
 

5955
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:31,870
sending these new electors in and we
think Trump won Arizona and Georgia and

5956
01:57:31,870 --> 01:57:31,880
think Trump won Arizona and Georgia and
 

5957
01:57:31,880 --> 01:57:34,350
think Trump won Arizona and Georgia and
Wisconsin right that was the idea that

5958
01:57:34,350 --> 01:57:34,360
Wisconsin right that was the idea that
 

5959
01:57:34,360 --> 01:57:36,750
Wisconsin right that was the idea that
was the plan and then you come back to

5960
01:57:36,750 --> 01:57:36,760
was the plan and then you come back to
 

5961
01:57:36,760 --> 01:57:38,790
was the plan and then you come back to
the house at that point when there are

5962
01:57:38,790 --> 01:57:38,800
the house at that point when there are
 

5963
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:41,950
the house at that point when there are
two different sets of electors the rule

5964
01:57:41,950 --> 01:57:41,960
two different sets of electors the rule
 

5965
01:57:41,960 --> 01:57:45,109
two different sets of electors the rule
constitutional rule is the house decides

5966
01:57:45,109 --> 01:57:45,119
constitutional rule is the house decides
 

5967
01:57:45,119 --> 01:57:48,470
constitutional rule is the house decides
but the house decides not on a majority

5968
01:57:48,470 --> 01:57:48,480
but the house decides not on a majority
 

5969
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:49,870
but the house decides not on a majority
because the Democrats had the majority

5970
01:57:49,870 --> 01:57:49,880
because the Democrats had the majority
 

5971
01:57:49,880 --> 01:57:51,790
because the Democrats had the majority
at the time they decide on a majority of

5972
01:57:51,790 --> 01:57:51,800
at the time they decide on a majority of
 

5973
01:57:51,800 --> 01:57:54,910
at the time they decide on a majority of
the States they vote by state and the

5974
01:57:54,910 --> 01:57:54,920
the States they vote by state and the
 

5975
01:57:54,920 --> 01:57:56,709
the States they vote by state and the
Republicans had the majority of the

5976
01:57:56,709 --> 01:57:56,719
Republicans had the majority of the
 

5977
01:57:56,719 --> 01:57:59,510
Republicans had the majority of the
states so in that way you steal the

5978
01:57:59,510 --> 01:57:59,520
states so in that way you steal the
 

5979
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:01,709
states so in that way you steal the
election even though Trump didn't win

5980
01:58:01,709 --> 01:58:01,719
election even though Trump didn't win
 

5981
01:58:01,719 --> 01:58:04,229
election even though Trump didn't win
you install him back in as president

5982
01:58:04,229 --> 01:58:04,239
you install him back in as president
 

5983
01:58:04,239 --> 01:58:07,109
you install him back in as president
that is a frontal assault on democracy

5984
01:58:07,109 --> 01:58:07,119
that is a frontal assault on democracy
 

5985
01:58:07,119 --> 01:58:10,310
that is a frontal assault on democracy
and I loathe it and then Trump on top

5986
01:58:10,310 --> 01:58:10,320
and I loathe it and then Trump on top
 

5987
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:13,069
and I loathe it and then Trump on top
just blabbers out well sometimes you

6562
02:09:39,229 --> 02:09:39,239
bias towards the left yeah do you think
 

6563
02:09:39,239 --> 02:09:40,790
bias towards the left yeah do you think
first of all I think you've argued that

6564
02:09:40,790 --> 02:09:40,800
first of all I think you've argued that
 

6565
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:44,709
first of all I think you've argued that
that's not true that there's a bias uh

6566
02:09:44,709 --> 02:09:44,719
that's not true that there's a bias uh
 

6567
02:09:44,719 --> 02:09:47,229
that's not true that there's a bias uh
in the other direction but whether

6568
02:09:47,229 --> 02:09:47,239
in the other direction but whether
 

6569
02:09:47,239 --> 02:09:48,750
in the other direction but whether
there's a bias or not do you think that

6570
02:09:48,750 --> 02:09:48,760
there's a bias or not do you think that
 

6571
02:09:48,760 --> 02:09:50,310
there's a bias or not do you think that
how big of an impact that has on the

6572
02:09:50,310 --> 02:09:50,320
how big of an impact that has on the
 

6573
02:09:50,320 --> 02:09:51,870
how big of an impact that has on the
result of the election

6574
02:09:51,870 --> 02:09:51,880
result of the election
 

6575
02:09:51,880 --> 02:09:54,750
result of the election
okay so let's break that down uh Tech

6576
02:09:54,750 --> 02:09:54,760
okay so let's break that down uh Tech
 

6577
02:09:54,760 --> 02:09:56,750
okay so let's break that down uh Tech
and media are totally different so let's

6578
02:09:56,750 --> 02:09:56,760
and media are totally different so let's
 

6579
02:09:56,760 --> 02:09:59,669
and media are totally different so let's
do media first and we'll do Tech so on

6580
02:09:59,669 --> 02:09:59,679
do media first and we'll do Tech so on
 

6581
02:09:59,679 --> 02:10:01,950
do media first and we'll do Tech so on
uh mainstream media corporate media and

6582
02:10:01,950 --> 02:10:01,960
uh mainstream media corporate media and
 

6583
02:10:01,960 --> 02:10:05,510
uh mainstream media corporate media and
I I actually think that right-wing media

6584
02:10:05,510 --> 02:10:05,520
I I actually think that right-wing media
 

6585
02:10:05,520 --> 02:10:07,830
I I actually think that right-wing media
like Fox News is part of corporate media

6586
02:10:07,830 --> 02:10:07,840
like Fox News is part of corporate media
 

6587
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:11,189
like Fox News is part of corporate media
they just play good cop bad cop and so

they just play good cop bad cop and so
 

6589
02:10:11,199 --> 02:10:13,430
they just play good cop bad cop and so
in in that realm the bias is not right

6590
02:10:13,430 --> 02:10:13,440
in in that realm the bias is not right
 

6591
02:10:13,440 --> 02:10:16,350
in in that realm the bias is not right
or left except on social issues okay so

6592
02:10:16,350 --> 02:10:16,360
or left except on social issues okay so
 

6593
02:10:16,360 --> 02:10:18,109
or left except on social issues okay so
and that's where that image comes from

6594
02:10:18,109 --> 02:10:18,119
and that's where that image comes from
 

6595
02:10:18,119 --> 02:10:20,750
and that's where that image comes from
on social issues yes the media is

6596
02:10:20,750 --> 02:10:20,760
on social issues yes the media is
 

6597
02:10:20,760 --> 02:10:23,549
on social issues yes the media is
generally on the left and rightwing

6598
02:10:23,549 --> 02:10:23,559
generally on the left and rightwing
 

6599
02:10:23,559 --> 02:10:26,629

that Biden works for the donors 98% I

7242
02:23:08,190 --> 02:23:08,200
that Biden works for the donors 98% I
 

7243
02:23:08,200 --> 02:23:11,270
that Biden works for the donors 98% I
think he only works for them 80% or 55%

7244
02:23:11,270 --> 02:23:11,280
think he only works for them 80% or 55%
 

7245
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:13,429
think he only works for them 80% or 55%
fine we could have that debate but you

7246
02:23:13,429 --> 02:23:13,439
fine we could have that debate but you
 

7247
02:23:13,439 --> 02:23:15,710
fine we could have that debate but you
can't argue that it isn't his source of

7248
02:23:15,710 --> 02:23:15,720
can't argue that it isn't his source of
 

7249
02:23:15,720 --> 02:23:17,790
can't argue that it isn't his source of
power and you can't argue it anymore

7250
02:23:17,790 --> 02:23:17,800
power and you can't argue it anymore
 

7251
02:23:17,800 --> 02:23:18,830
power and you can't argue it anymore
even if you were going to argue it

7252
02:23:18,830 --> 02:23:18,840
even if you were going to argue it
 

7253
02:23:18,840 --> 02:23:20,790
even if you were going to argue it
earlier because once the donors said

7254
02:23:20,790 --> 02:23:20,800
earlier because once the donors said
 

7255
02:23:20,800 --> 02:23:22,389
earlier because once the donors said

didn't have any options he couldn't he
 

7259
02:23:24,720 --> 02:23:27,830
didn't have any options he couldn't he
couldn't go on so but was he forced out

7260
02:23:27,830 --> 02:23:27,840
couldn't go on so but was he forced out
 

7261
02:23:27,840 --> 02:23:30,349
couldn't go on so but was he forced out
at like knife point or something no so

7262
02:23:30,349 --> 02:23:30,359
at like knife point or something no so
 

7263
02:23:30,359 --> 02:23:32,510
at like knife point or something no so
was it voluntary yeah ultimately if

7264
02:23:32,510 --> 02:23:32,520
was it voluntary yeah ultimately if
 

7265
02:23:32,520 --> 02:23:34,110
was it voluntary yeah ultimately if
Biden decided to stay in there was

7266
02:23:34,110 --> 02:23:34,120
Biden decided to stay in there was
 

7267
02:23:34,120 --> 02:23:36,349
Biden decided to stay in there was
nothing we could do about it and so he

7268
02:23:36,349 --> 02:23:36,359
nothing we could do about it and so he
 

7269
02:23:36,359 --> 02:23:38,349
nothing we could do about it and so he
had to voluntarily make that decision

7270
02:23:38,349 --> 02:23:38,359
had to voluntarily make that decision
 

7271
02:23:38,359 --> 02:23:40,309
had to voluntarily make that decision
but he voluntarily made it because he

7272
02:23:40,309 --> 02:23:40,319
but he voluntarily made it because he
 

7273
02:23:40,319 --> 02:23:43,830
but he voluntarily made it because he
had no choice left yeah I wish he

7274
02:23:43,830 --> 02:23:43,840
had no choice left yeah I wish he
 

7275
02:23:43,840 --> 02:23:47,590
had no choice left yeah I wish he
stepped down voluntarily from a place of

7276
02:23:47,590 --> 02:23:47,600
stepped down voluntarily from a place of
 

7277
02:23:47,600 --> 02:23:51,590
stepped down voluntarily from a place of
strength so I think I think presidents I

7278

Moment yeah for for me one of the

9126
03:00:47,309 --> 03:00:47,319
Moment yeah for for me one of the
 

9127
03:00:47,319 --> 03:00:50,389
Moment yeah for for me one of the
biggest deal man for Trump is that he

9128
03:00:50,389 --> 03:00:50,399
biggest deal man for Trump is that he

03:00:52,040 --> 03:00:54,469
has both the skill and the
predisposition to not be a

03:00:54,469 --> 03:00:54,479
predisposition to not be a
 

9133
03:00:54,479 --> 03:00:58,150
predisposition to not be a
warmonger he I think better than the

quagmire like we did in Iraq and
 

9195
03:02:11,960 --> 03:02:15,790
quagmire like we did in Iraq and
Afghanistan and they're bleeding out so

9196
03:02:15,790 --> 03:02:15,800
Afghanistan and they're bleeding out so
 

9197
03:02:15,800 --> 03:02:17,910
Afghanistan and they're bleeding out so
they the military industrial complex

9198
03:02:17,910 --> 03:02:17,920
they the military industrial complex
 

9199
03:02:17,920 --> 03:02:19,830
they the military industrial complex
wants Russia to bleed out for as long as

9200
03:02:19,830 --> 03:02:19,840
wants Russia to bleed out for as long as
 

9201
03:02:19,840 --> 03:02:22,550
wants Russia to bleed out for as long as
humanly possible they actually care more

9202
03:02:22,550 --> 03:02:22,560
humanly possible they actually care more
 

9203
03:02:22,560 --> 03:02:24,190
humanly possible they actually care more
about their own interests of course than

9204
03:02:24,190 --> 03:02:24,200
about their own interests of course than
 

9205
03:02:24,200 --> 03:02:27,550
about their own interests of course than
they do about Ukrainian interests so in

9206
03:02:27,550 --> 03:02:27,560
they do about Ukrainian interests so in
 

9207
03:02:27,560 --> 03:02:28,990
they do about Ukrainian interests so in
fact there's a good argument to be made

9208
03:02:28,990 --> 03:02:29,000
fact there's a good argument to be made
 

9209
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:30,389
fact there's a good argument to be made
that Ukraine could have gotten a peace

9210
03:02:30,389 --> 03:02:30,399
that Ukraine could have gotten a peace
 

9211
03:02:30,399 --> 03:02:34,790
that Ukraine could have gotten a peace
deal earlier uh and we prevented it so

9212
03:02:34,790 --> 03:02:34,800
deal earlier uh and we prevented it so
 

9213
03:02:34,800 --> 03:02:38,229
deal earlier uh and we prevented it so
but the bottom line now is probably how

9214
03:02:38,229 --> 03:02:38,239
but the bottom line now is probably how
 

9215
03:02:38,239 --> 03:02:41,030
but the bottom line now is probably how
a deal gets done is they let go of three

9216
03:02:41,030 --> 03:02:41,040
a deal gets done is they let go of three
 

9217
03:02:41,040 --> 03:02:43,950
a deal gets done is they let go of three
more areas in Ukraine they already lost

9218
03:02:43,950 --> 03:02:43,960
more areas in Ukraine they already lost
 

9219
03:02:43,960 --> 03:02:46,030
more areas in Ukraine they already lost
Crimea they'd have to let go of three

9220
03:02:46,030 --> 03:02:46,040
Crimea they'd have to let go of three
 

9221
03:02:46,040 --> 03:02:49,990
Crimea they'd have to let go of three
more regions and that is tough because

9222
03:02:49,990 --> 03:02:50,000
more regions and that is tough because
 

9223
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:51,830
more regions and that is tough because
at that point Russia's a little bit

9224
03:02:51,830 --> 03:02:51,840
at that point Russia's a little bit
 

9225
03:02:51,840 --> 03:02:53,830
at that point Russia's a little bit
encouraged every time they do an

9226
03:02:53,830 --> 03:02:53,840
encouraged every time they do an
 

9227
03:02:53,840 --> 03:02:56,110
encouraged every time they do an
invasion they get more land they might

9228
03:02:56,110 --> 03:02:56,120
invasion they get more land they might
 

9229
03:02:56,120 --> 03:02:57,550
invasion they get more land they might
not get all the land they wanted but

9230
03:02:57,550 --> 03:02:57,560
not get all the land they wanted but
 

9231
03:02:57,560 --> 03:03:00,710
not get all the land they wanted but
they get a lot of land so that's it's a

9232
03:03:00,710 --> 03:03:00,720
they get a lot of land so that's it's a
 

9233
03:03:00,720 --> 03:03:04,710
they get a lot of land so that's it's a
very difficult issue but literally which

9234
03:03:04,710 --> 03:03:04,720
very difficult issue but literally which
 

9235
03:03:04,720 --> 03:03:07,030
very difficult issue but literally which
which person if they become president

9236
03:03:07,030 --> 03:03:07,040
which person if they become president
 

9237
03:03:07,040 --> 03:03:10,309
which person if they become president

think
Trump uh sees themselves and uh wants to

9310
03:04:43,910 --> 03:04:43,920
Trump uh sees themselves and uh wants to
 

9311

end and I think Trump would bring that

9318
03:04:53,830 --> 03:04:53,840
end and I think Trump would bring that
 

9319
03:04:53,840 --> 03:04:57,630

03:04:57,630 --> 03:04:57,640
much faster and I I disagree with you at
 

9321
03:04:57,640 --> 03:05:00,790
much faster and I I disagree with you at
least my hope is that he would negotiate

9322
03:05:00,790 --> 03:05:00,800
least my hope is that he would negotiate
 

9323
03:05:00,800 --> 03:05:04,309
least my hope is that he would negotiate
something that would be fair he's

9324
03:05:04,309 --> 03:05:04,319
something that would be fair he's
 

9325
03:05:04,319 --> 03:05:07,510
something that would be fair he's
not his anti-war record is so

9326
03:05:07,510 --> 03:05:07,520
not his anti-war record is so
 

9327
03:05:07,520 --> 03:05:11,269
not his anti-war record is so
complicated because moving the embassy

9328
03:05:11,269 --> 03:05:11,279
complicated because moving the embassy
 

9329
03:05:11,279 --> 03:05:14,070
complicated because moving the embassy
in Israel and killing the top Iranian

9330
03:05:14,070 --> 03:05:14,080
in Israel and killing the top Iranian
 

9331
03:05:14,080 --> 03:05:16,590
in Israel and killing the top Iranian
General were super provocative and they

9332
03:05:16,590 --> 03:05:16,600
General were super provocative and they
 

9333
03:05:16,600 --> 03:05:19,070
General were super provocative and they
could have easily triggered a giant War

9334
03:05:19,070 --> 03:05:19,080
could have easily triggered a giant War
 

9335
03:05:19,080 --> 03:05:20,710
could have easily triggered a giant War
there and then you know what's going to

9336
03:05:20,710 --> 03:05:20,720
there and then you know what's going to
 

9337
03:05:20,720 --> 03:05:22,510
there and then you know what's going to
happen if you get into any kind of real

9338
03:05:22,510 --> 03:05:22,520
happen if you get into any kind of real
 

9339
03:05:22,520 --> 03:05:24,030
happen if you get into any kind of real
war Trump's going to want to prove his

was very clear about it but the problem
 

9379
03:06:07,760 --> 03:06:10,870
was very clear about it but the problem
is if you get your bluff called and so

so we're in De but let me connect it
 

10129
03:21:33,040 --> 03:21:35,590
so we're in De but let me connect it
back to the hope when mainstream media

10130
03:21:35,590 --> 03:21:35,600
back to the hope when mainstream media
 

10131
03:21:35,600 --> 03:21:38,229
back to the hope when mainstream media
has you hooked you got no hope because

10132
03:21:38,229 --> 03:21:38,239
has you hooked you got no hope because
 

10133
03:21:38,239 --> 03:21:40,550
has you hooked you got no hope because
you don't have the right information you

10134
03:21:40,550 --> 03:21:40,560
you don't have the right information you
 

10135

03:21:47,070 --> 03:21:47,080
online world it's chaotic
 

10141
03:21:47,080 --> 03:21:48,790
online world it's chaotic
and don't get me wrong it's got plenty

10142
03:21:48,790 --> 03:21:48,800
and don't get me wrong it's got plenty
 

10143
03:21:48,800 --> 03:21:52,990
and don't get me wrong it's got plenty
of downsides right but within that chaos

10144
03:21:52,990 --> 03:21:53,000
of downsides right but within that chaos
 

10145
03:21:53,000 --> 03:21:55,670
of downsides right but within that chaos
the truth begins to emerge and so for

throughout history why when you're

number one in news online the algorithm
 

10155
03:22:03,359 --> 03:22:05,590
number one in news online the algorithm
rewards anyone attacking you because

rewards anyone attacking you because
then you get into their algorithmic Loop

10158
03:22:07,710 --> 03:22:07,720
then you get into their algorithmic Loop
 

10159
03:22:07,720 --> 03:22:09,870
then you get into their algorithmic Loop
mhm it's not an accident that we've been

10160
03:22:09,870 --> 03:22:09,880
mhm it's not an accident that we've been
 

10161
03:22:09,880 --> 03:22:12,309
mhm it's not an accident that we've been
attacked dozens of times one we're

10162
03:22:12,309 --> 03:22:12,319
attacked dozens of times one we're
 

10163
03:22:12,319 --> 03:22:14,070
attacked dozens of times one we're
independent thinkers so anyone if we

10164
03:22:14,070 --> 03:22:14,080
independent thinkers so anyone if we
 

10165
03:22:14,080 --> 03:22:15,309
independent thinkers so anyone if we
don't match their ideology they're going

10166
03:22:15,309 --> 03:22:15,319
don't match their ideology they're going
 

10167
03:22:15,319 --> 03:22:17,309
don't match their ideology they're going
to attack us but number two they get in

10168
03:22:17,309 --> 03:22:17,319
to attack us but number two they get in
 

10169
03:22:17,319 --> 03:22:19,269
to attack us but number two they get in
our algorithm loop it's too hard to

10170
03:22:19,269 --> 03:22:19,279
our algorithm loop it's too hard to
 

10171
03:22:19,279 --> 03:22:21,830
our algorithm loop it's too hard to
resist right so all of a sudden they

10172
03:22:21,830 --> 03:22:21,840
resist right so all of a sudden they
 

10173
03:22:21,840 --> 03:22:23,469
resist right so all of a sudden they
think that we're being funded by Nancy

10174
03:22:23,469 --> 03:22:23,479
think that we're being funded by Nancy

Pelosi or the CIA and oh We're Off to
the Races there's another fight right

10178
03:22:28,429 --> 03:22:28,439
the Races there's another fight right
 

10179
03:22:28,439 --> 03:22:31,030
the Races there's another fight right
but our competition is a graveyard and

10180
03:22:31,030 --> 03:22:31,040
but our competition is a graveyard and
 

10181
03:22:31,040 --> 03:22:35,070
but our competition is a graveyard and
so we've B we won all almost all all of

10182
03:22:35,070 --> 03:22:35,080
so we've B we won all almost all all of
 

10183
03:22:35,080 --> 03:22:38,590
so we've B we won all almost all all of
those fights why because we try really

10184
03:22:38,590 --> 03:22:38,600
those fights why because we try really
 

10185
03:22:38,600 --> 03:22:41,990
those fights why because we try really
hard to stick with the truth with logic

10186
03:22:41,990 --> 03:22:42,000
hard to stick with the truth with logic
 

10187
03:22:42,000 --> 03:22:44,349
hard to stick with the truth with logic
and we don't do audience capture even if

10188
03:22:44,349 --> 03:22:44,359
and we don't do audience capture even if
 

10189
03:22:44,359 --> 03:22:46,150
and we don't do audience capture even if
our audience is going in one direction

10190
03:22:46,150 --> 03:22:46,160
our audience is going in one direction
 

10191
03:22:46,160 --> 03:22:48,630
our audience is going in one direction
we don't think it's right we Anna and I

10192
03:22:48,630 --> 03:22:48,640
we don't think it's right we Anna and I
 

10193
03:22:48,640 --> 03:22:50,670
we don't think it's right we Anna and I
will come out and go no sorry guys love

10194
03:22:50,670 --> 03:22:50,680
will come out and go no sorry guys love
 

10195

okay ETA so in that
 

10199
03:22:57,600 --> 03:23:00,150
okay ETA so in that
world the people it's going to take a

10200
03:23:00,150 --> 03:23:00,160
world the people it's going to take a
 

10201
03:23:00,160 --> 03:23:01,990
world the people it's going to take a
while guys but people who are telling

10202
03:23:01,990 --> 03:23:02,000
while guys but people who are telling
 

10203
03:23:02,000 --> 03:23:03,670
while guys but people who are telling
the truth are eventually going to rise

10204
03:23:03,670 --> 03:23:03,680
the truth are eventually going to rise
 

10205
03:23:03,680 --> 03:23:07,469
the truth are eventually going to rise
up and when they do now we're free and

10206
03:23:07,469 --> 03:23:07,479
up and when they do now we're free and
 

10207
03:23:07,479 --> 03:23:08,910
up and when they do now we're free and
now the second part is even more

10208
03:23:08,910 --> 03:23:08,920
now the second part is even more
 

10209
03:23:08,920 --> 03:23:10,469
now the second part is even more
devastating for mainstream media because

10210
03:23:10,469 --> 03:23:10,479
devastating for mainstream media because
 

10211

at the revenue for CNN Etc and they have

10214
03:23:18,070 --> 03:23:18,080
at the revenue for CNN Etc and they have
 

10215
03:23:18,080 --> 03:23:20,469
at the revenue for CNN Etc and they have
a massive problem and people don't

10216
03:23:20,469 --> 03:23:20,479
a massive problem and people don't
 

10217
03:23:20,479 --> 03:23:22,710
a massive problem and people don't
realize how big the problem is that

10218
03:23:22,710 --> 03:23:22,720
realize how big the problem is that
 

10219
03:23:22,720 --> 03:23:25,349
realize how big the problem is that
thing is going to capsize I don't talk

10220
03:23:25,349 --> 03:23:25,359
thing is going to capsize I don't talk
 

10221
03:23:25,359 --> 03:23:27,590
thing is going to capsize I don't talk
about it often because I don't want more

10222
03:23:27,590 --> 03:23:27,600
about it often because I don't want more
 

10223
03:23:27,600 --> 03:23:30,189
about it often because I don't want more
competition okay I'm I also have a

10224
03:23:30,189 --> 03:23:30,199
competition okay I'm I also have a
 

10225
03:23:30,199 --> 03:23:33,790
competition okay I'm I also have a
company right in in the online World Etc

10226
03:23:33,790 --> 03:23:33,800
company right in in the online World Etc
 

10227
03:23:33,800 --> 03:23:36,429
company right in in the online World Etc
but but but I'm too honest I gotta say

10228
03:23:36,429 --> 03:23:36,439
but but but I'm too honest I gotta say
 

10229
03:23:36,439 --> 03:23:39,269
but but but I'm too honest I gotta say
it I gotta say it so there they have two

10230
03:23:39,269 --> 03:23:39,279
it I gotta say it so there they have two
 

10231
03:23:39,279 --> 03:23:41,630
it I gotta say it so there they have two
revenue streams one is ADS that's why

10232
03:23:41,630 --> 03:23:41,640
revenue streams one is ADS that's why
 

10233
03:23:41,640 --> 03:23:43,630
revenue streams one is ADS that's why
they serve advertisers and politicians

10234
03:23:43,630 --> 03:23:43,640
they serve advertisers and politicians
 

10235
03:23:43,640 --> 03:23:46,550
they serve advertisers and politicians
are huge advertisers as we mentioned the

10236
03:23:46,550 --> 03:23:46,560
are huge advertisers as we mentioned the
 

10237
03:23:46,560 --> 03:23:49,309
are huge advertisers as we mentioned the
second uh Revenue stream depending on

10238
03:23:49,309 --> 03:23:49,319
second uh Revenue stream depending on
 

10239
03:23:49,319 --> 03:23:51,389
second uh Revenue stream depending on
the compan is arguably more important

10240
03:23:51,389 --> 03:23:51,399
the compan is arguably more important
 

10241
03:23:51,399 --> 03:23:52,510
the compan is arguably more important
which is

10242
03:23:52,510 --> 03:23:52,520
which is
 

10243
03:23:52,520 --> 03:23:55,389
which is
subscribers so now what happens in a

10244
03:23:55,389 --> 03:23:55,399
subscribers so now what happens in a
 

10245
03:23:55,399 --> 03:23:58,910
subscribers so now what happens in a
business normally is uh so they started

10246
03:23:58,910 --> 03:23:58,920
business normally is uh so they started
 

10247
03:23:58,920 --> 03:24:00,870
business normally is uh so they started
out low and then they got high and now

10248
03:24:00,870 --> 03:24:00,880
out low and then they got high and now
 

10249
03:24:00,880 --> 03:24:03,070
out low and then they got high and now
they got a ton of subscribers at its

find the truth like we were mentioning

10338
03:25:53,670 --> 03:25:53,680
find the truth like we were mentioning
 

10339
03:25:53,680 --> 03:25:55,750
find the truth like we were mentioning
but most of the time it's just drama and

10340
03:25:55,750 --> 03:25:55,760
but most of the time it's just drama and
 

10341
03:25:55,760 --> 03:25:57,510
but most of the time it's just drama and
it can it doesn't care about the truth

10342
03:25:57,510 --> 03:25:57,520
it can it doesn't care about the truth
 

10343

it can it doesn't care about the truth
it just cares about drama and then the

10344
03:25:59,349 --> 03:25:59,359
it just cares about drama and then the
 

10345
03:25:59,359 --> 03:26:01,750
it just cares about drama and then the
same is like conspiracy theories now

10346
03:26:01,750 --> 03:26:01,760
same is like conspiracy theories now
 

10347
03:26:01,760 --> 03:26:03,950
same is like conspiracy theories now
some conspiracy theories have value and

10348
03:26:03,950 --> 03:26:03,960
some conspiracy theories have value and
 

10349
03:26:03,960 --> 03:26:06,710
some conspiracy theories have value and
depth and they allow us to to question

10350
03:26:06,710 --> 03:26:06,720
depth and they allow us to to question
 

10351
03:26:06,720 --> 03:26:10,150

The Establishment institutions but the

10352
03:26:10,150 --> 03:26:10,160
The Establishment institutions but the
 

10353
03:26:10,160 --> 03:26:12,469
The Establishment institutions but the
bottom line is conspiracy theories get

10354
03:26:12,469 --> 03:26:12,479
bottom line is conspiracy theories get
 

10355
03:26:12,479 --> 03:26:14,590
bottom line is conspiracy theories get
clicks and so you can just keep coming

10356
03:26:14,590 --> 03:26:14,600
clicks and so you can just keep coming
 

10357
03:26:14,600 --> 03:26:16,550
clicks and so you can just keep coming
up with random conspiracy theories and

10358
03:26:16,550 --> 03:26:16,560
up with random conspiracy theories and
 

10359
03:26:16,560 --> 03:26:17,870
up with random conspiracy theories and
they many of them don't have to be

10360
03:26:17,870 --> 03:26:17,880
they many of them don't have to be
 

10361
03:26:17,880 --> 03:26:19,870
they many of them don't have to be
grounded in the truth at all and so

10362
03:26:19,870 --> 03:26:19,880
grounded in the truth at all and so
 

10363
03:26:19,880 --> 03:26:22,630
grounded in the truth at all and so
that's the sea we're operating in and

10364
03:26:22,630 --> 03:26:22,640
that's the sea we're operating in and
 

10365
03:26:22,640 --> 03:26:26,349
that's the sea we're operating in and

10645
03:32:08,520 --> 03:32:10,269
and every time they win and they're like
that how' you know that because we get

10646
03:32:10,269 --> 03:32:10,279
that how' you know that because we get
 

10647
03:32:10,279 --> 03:32:12,429
that how' you know that because we get
trained we're not going to lose to a

10648
03:32:12,429 --> 03:32:12,439
trained we're not going to lose to a
 

10649
03:32:12,439 --> 03:32:14,670
trained we're not going to lose to a
non- wrestler in a wrestling contest

10650
03:32:14,670 --> 03:32:14,680
non- wrestler in a wrestling contest
 

10651
03:32:14,680 --> 03:32:16,429
non- wrestler in a wrestling contest
it's not going to happen right

10652
03:32:16,429 --> 03:32:16,439
it's not going to happen right
 

10653
03:32:16,439 --> 03:32:19,429
it's not going to happen right
so you can get lucky but it's unlikely

10654
03:32:19,429 --> 03:32:19,439
so you can get lucky but it's unlikely
 

10655
03:32:19,439 --> 03:32:22,070
so you can get lucky but it's unlikely

long time ago but at least you know the
 

10659
03:32:23,359 --> 03:32:26,110
long time ago but at least you know the
mechanics right uh number two I've

10660
03:32:26,110 --> 03:32:26,120
mechanics right uh number two I've
 

10661
03:32:26,120 --> 03:32:27,870
mechanics right uh number two I've
gotten into about 30 actual street

but it's not no experience it's some
experience and the most important part

10672
03:32:37,110 --> 03:32:37,120
experience and the most important part
 

10673
03:32:37,120 --> 03:32:39,389

11161
03:42:23,439 --> 03:42:25,429
I mentioned earlier no one probably not
he might not even consciously know it

11162
03:42:25,429 --> 03:42:25,439
he might not even consciously know it
 

11163
03:42:25,439 --> 03:42:26,950
he might not even consciously know it
but no one dislikes Bernie more than

11164
03:42:26,950 --> 03:42:26,960
but no one dislikes Bernie more than
 

11165
03:42:26,960 --> 03:42:29,670
but no one dislikes Bernie more than
Obama because if Bernie got into office

11166
03:42:29,670 --> 03:42:29,680
Obama because if Bernie got into office
 

11167
03:42:29,680 --> 03:42:32,469
Obama because if Bernie got into office
he'd embarrass Obama by doing a lot more

11168
03:42:32,469 --> 03:42:32,479
he'd embarrass Obama by doing a lot more
 

11169
03:42:32,479 --> 03:42:35,149
he'd embarrass Obama by doing a lot more
change and Obama told us that change

11170
03:42:35,149 --> 03:42:35,159
change and Obama told us that change
 

11171
03:42:35,159 --> 03:42:38,110
change and Obama told us that change
wasn't possible you could only get 5%

11172
03:42:38,110 --> 03:42:38,120
wasn't possible you could only get 5%
 

11173
03:42:38,120 --> 03:42:40,590
wasn't possible you could only get 5%
and so if Bernie does 50% then Obama's

11174
03:42:40,590 --> 03:42:40,600
and so if Bernie does 50% then Obama's
 

11175
03:42:40,600 --> 03:42:42,910
and so if Bernie does 50% then Obama's
humiliated and his record and his legacy

11176
03:42:42,910 --> 03:42:42,920
humiliated and his record and his legacy
 

11177
03:42:42,920 --> 03:42:46,189
humiliated and his record and his legacy
is ruined right so he I don't think he

11178
03:42:46,189 --> 03:42:46,199
is ruined right so he I don't think he
 

11179
03:42:46,199 --> 03:42:48,309
is ruined right so he I don't think he
makes that conscious decision right but

11180
03:42:48,309 --> 03:42:48,319
makes that conscious decision right but
 

11181
03:42:48,319 --> 03:42:50,710
makes that conscious decision right but
it's subconscious it's a way of thinking

11182
03:42:50,710 --> 03:42:50,720
it's subconscious it's a way of thinking
 

11183
03:42:50,720 --> 03:42:53,910
it's subconscious it's a way of thinking

of a question um a lot of them could
 

11225
03:43:42,880 --> 03:43:45,110
of a question um a lot of them could
probably be explained by corporatism and

11226
03:43:45,110 --> 03:43:45,120
probably be explained by corporatism and
 

11227

the military industrial complex uh but
there's also a lot of them can be

11230
03:43:49,870 --> 03:43:49,880
there's also a lot of them can be
 

11231

human nature uh Epstein is an example of
 

11235
03:43:55,279 --> 03:43:57,429
human nature uh Epstein is an example of
that there's a lot of ways to explain

11236
03:43:57,429 --> 03:43:57,439
that there's a lot of ways to explain
 

11237
03:43:57,439 --> 03:44:01,189

nature um but there could be bigger
 

11243
03:44:04,880 --> 03:44:08,269
nature um but there could be bigger
explanations underlying it so sometimes

11244
03:44:08,269 --> 03:44:08,279
explanations underlying it so sometimes
 

11245
03:44:08,279 --> 03:44:10,070
explanations underlying it so sometimes
when we have long thoughtful

11246
03:44:10,070 --> 03:44:10,080
when we have long thoughtful
 

11247
03:44:10,080 --> 03:44:11,950
when we have long thoughtful
conversations like this I'll say it

11248
03:44:11,950 --> 03:44:11,960
conversations like this I'll say it
 

11249
03:44:11,960 --> 03:44:13,990
conversations like this I'll say it
depends a lot yeah and then people get

11250
03:44:13,990 --> 03:44:14,000
depends a lot yeah and then people get
 

11251
03:44:14,000 --> 03:44:15,429
depends a lot yeah and then people get
frustrated by that but then you're

frustrated by that but then you're
 

11253
03:44:15,439 --> 03:44:18,590
frustrated by that but then you're
frustrated by the world cuz it depends

11254
03:44:18,590 --> 03:44:18,600
frustrated by the world cuz it depends
 

11255
03:44:18,600 --> 03:44:21,990
frustrated by the world cuz it depends
so conspiracy theories if you say are

11256
03:44:21,990 --> 03:44:22,000
so conspiracy theories if you say are
 

11257

11259
03:44:24,159 --> 03:44:27,070
they all right or are they all wrong
already the question's wrong so it

11260
03:44:27,070 --> 03:44:27,080
already the question's wrong so it
 

11261
03:44:27,080 --> 03:44:30,070
already the question's wrong so it
depends what is the conspiracy theory so

11262
03:44:30,070 --> 03:44:30,080
depends what is the conspiracy theory so
 

11263
03:44:30,080 --> 03:44:32,149
depends what is the conspiracy theory so
if it's you know some of the Absurd ones

my point is yeah some conspiracy
theories could be true it depends on

theories could be true it depends on
 

11351
03:46:21,520 --> 03:46:26,110
theories could be true it depends on
objective reality right you get to

11352
03:46:26,110 --> 03:46:26,120

 

11353

11357
03:46:31,720 --> 03:46:35,269
time because I want you to test me and
see does it match objective reality so I

11358
03:46:35,269 --> 03:46:35,279
see does it match objective reality so I
 

11359
03:46:35,279 --> 03:46:38,149
see does it match objective reality so I

03:46:38,159 --> 03:46:39,590
said the minute that it happened you'll
have your answer based on whether the

11362
03:46:39,590 --> 03:46:39,600

11363
03:46:39,600 --> 03:46:42,030
have your answer based on whether the
video in the hallway worked or not if

it's for only for the powerful and so
 

11497
03:49:26,720 --> 03:49:30,030
it's for only for the powerful and so
it's more of a machine and they don't do

Outsiders well that's you know one of
 

11529

the conspiracy theories with Epstein is
that he's a front for like a I guess

11532
03:50:11,269 --> 03:50:11,279
that he's a front for like a I guess
 

11533
03:50:11,279 --> 03:50:15,229
that he's a front for like a I guess
CIA and they're getting data on

11534
03:50:15,229 --> 03:50:15,239
CIA and they're getting data on
 

11535
03:50:15,239 --> 03:50:19,389
CIA and they're getting data on
people like creepy

11536
03:50:19,389 --> 03:50:19,399
people like creepy
 

11537
03:50:19,399 --> 03:50:22,469
people like creepy
pedophile kind of data to they they can

11538
03:50:22,469 --> 03:50:22,479
pedophile kind of data to they they can
 

11539
03:50:22,479 --> 03:50:24,510
pedophile kind of data to they they can
use to then threatened character

11540
03:50:24,510 --> 03:50:24,520
use to then threatened character
 

11541
03:50:24,520 --> 03:50:27,110
use to then threatened character
assassination and they they put them in

11542
03:50:27,110 --> 03:50:27,120
assassination and they they put them in
 

11543
03:50:27,120 --> 03:50:29,590
assassination and they they put them in
this way put the people in their pockets

11544
03:50:29,590 --> 03:50:29,600
this way put the people in their pockets
 

11545
03:50:29,600 --> 03:50:32,469
this way put the people in their pockets
so look we're not in on it so we there's

11546
03:50:32,469 --> 03:50:32,479
so look we're not in on it so we there's
 

11547
03:50:32,479 --> 03:50:35,590
so look we're not in on it so we there's
no way we can know right but the I just

11548
03:50:35,590 --> 03:50:35,600
no way we can know right but the I just
 

11549
03:50:35,600 --> 03:50:38,550
no way we can know right but the I just
always go back to logic

11550
03:50:38,550 --> 03:50:38,560
always go back to logic
 

11551
03:50:38,560 --> 03:50:41,910
always go back to logic
so he has dirt on a lot of powerful

11552
03:50:41,910 --> 03:50:41,920
so he has dirt on a lot of powerful
 

11553
03:50:41,920 --> 03:50:44,950
so he has dirt on a lot of powerful
people he dies in a way that is is an

11554
03:50:44,950 --> 03:50:44,960
people he dies in a way that is is an
 

11555
03:50:44,960 --> 03:50:46,750
people he dies in a way that is is an
obvious murderer and not a

11556
03:50:46,750 --> 03:50:46,760
obvious murderer and not a
 

11557
03:50:46,760 --> 03:50:49,510
obvious murderer and not a
suicide and then you begin to think who

11558
03:50:49,510 --> 03:50:49,520
suicide and then you begin to think who
 

11559
03:50:49,520 --> 03:50:51,990
suicide and then you begin to think who
would have enough power to be able to

11560
03:50:51,990 --> 03:50:52,000
would have enough power to be able to
 

11561
03:50:52,000 --> 03:50:54,910
would have enough power to be able to
get away with that crime and that is a

11562
03:50:54,910 --> 03:50:54,920
get away with that crime and that is a
 

11563
03:50:54,920 --> 03:50:58,429
get away with that crime and that is a
very limited number of either people or

11564
03:50:58,429 --> 03:50:58,439
very limited number of either people or
 

11565
03:50:58,439 --> 03:51:02,790
very limited number of either people or
governments right so that's probably

11566
03:51:02,790 --> 03:51:02,800
governments right so that's probably
 

11567
03:51:02,800 --> 03:51:04,630
governments right so that's probably
your answer without knowing anything

11568
03:51:04,630 --> 03:51:04,640
your answer without knowing anything
 

11569
03:51:04,640 --> 03:51:07,070
your answer without knowing anything
that's internal yeah that's crazy we

11570
03:51:07,070 --> 03:51:07,080
that's internal yeah that's crazy we
 

11571
03:51:07,080 --> 03:51:09,550
that's internal yeah that's crazy we
don't have the list of clients what is

don't have the list of clients what is
 

11573

don't have the list of clients what is
the best way to

03:51:11,000 --> 03:51:13,750
the best way to
achieve stability and peace in Israel

11576

next 5 10
 

11583
03:51:19,640 --> 03:51:22,269
next 5 10
years if people wanted to get to peace

11584
03:51:22,269 --> 03:51:22,279
years if people wanted to get to peace
 

11585
03:51:22,279 --> 03:51:24,389
years if people wanted to get to peace
it's relatively straightforward there's

11586
03:51:24,389 --> 03:51:24,399
it's relatively straightforward there's
 

11587
03:51:24,399 --> 03:51:27,389
it's relatively straightforward there's
already a deal the that was negotiated

your company it's it's unacceptable risk

12052
04:00:48,550 --> 04:00:48,560
your company it's it's unacceptable risk
 

12053
04:00:48,560 --> 04:00:50,269
your company it's it's unacceptable risk
but you're not wrong we talked about it

12054
04:00:50,269 --> 04:00:50,279
but you're not wrong we talked about it
 

12055
04:00:50,279 --> 04:00:52,710
but you're not wrong we talked about it
earlier but as part of that risk there's

12056
04:00:52,710 --> 04:00:52,720
earlier but as part of that risk there's
 

12057
04:00:52,720 --> 04:00:54,830
earlier but as part of that risk there's
a sliver in there that he could

12058
04:00:54,830 --> 04:00:54,840
a sliver in there that he could
 

12059
04:00:54,840 --> 04:00:56,910
a sliver in there that he could
accidentally do the right thing we

12060
04:00:56,910 --> 04:00:56,920
accidentally do the right thing we
 

12061
04:00:56,920 --> 04:00:58,710
accidentally do the right thing we
talked a lot about Hope in this

12062
04:00:58,710 --> 04:00:58,720
talked a lot about Hope in this
 

12063

States of us humans on Earth so why am I

12070
04:01:07,750 --> 04:01:07,760

Center left and not center right it gets

12072
04:01:09,670 --> 04:01:09,680
Center left and not center right it gets
 

12073
04:01:09,680 --> 04:01:12,870
Center left and not center right it gets
to that question so you look at the

12074
04:01:12,870 --> 04:01:12,880
to that question so you look at the
 

12075
04:01:12,880 --> 04:01:14,950
to that question so you look at the
polling not just here in America but in

12076
04:01:14,950 --> 04:01:14,960
polling not just here in America but in
 

12077
04:01:14,960 --> 04:01:17,269
polling not just here in America but in
almost any country and it almost always

12078
04:01:17,269 --> 04:01:17,279
almost any country and it almost always
 

12079
04:01:17,279 --> 04:01:21,630
almost any country and it almost always
breaks out to 2/3 1/3 right 2/3 the of

12080
04:01:21,630 --> 04:01:21,640
breaks out to 2/3 1/3 right 2/3 the of
 

12081
04:01:21,640 --> 04:01:24,870
breaks out to 2/3 1/3 right 2/3 the of
the people say let's be empathetic let's

12082
04:01:24,870 --> 04:01:24,880
the people say let's be empathetic let's
 

12083
04:01:24,880 --> 04:01:28,750
the people say let's be empathetic let's
share let's be let's do equality Justice

12084
04:01:28,750 --> 04:01:28,760

12085
04:01:28,760 --> 04:01:31,670
share let's be let's do equality Justice
let's be fair right one third goes no me

12086
04:01:31,670 --> 04:01:31,680
let's be fair right one third goes no me
 

12087
04:01:31,680 --> 04:01:33,870
let's be fair right one third goes no me
me me me me me me me me okay that's just

12088
04:01:33,870 --> 04:01:33,880
me me me me me me me me okay that's just
 

12089
04:01:33,880 --> 04:01:37,309
me me me me me me me me okay that's just
the nature of humanity and so and

12090
04:01:37,309 --> 04:01:37,319
the nature of humanity and so and
 

12091
04:01:37,319 --> 04:01:40,309
the nature of humanity and so and
usually the same third goes no change

12092
04:01:40,309 --> 04:01:40,319
usually the same third goes no change
 

12093
04:01:40,319 --> 04:01:42,510
usually the same third goes no change
and the other two-thirds go well some

12094
04:01:42,510 --> 04:01:42,520
and the other two-thirds go well some
 

12095
04:01:42,520 --> 04:01:44,550
and the other two-thirds go well some
change right

12096
04:01:44,550 --> 04:01:44,560
change right
 

12097
04:01:44,560 --> 04:01:46,990
change right
so because if you don't do any change

12098
04:01:46,990 --> 04:01:47,000
so because if you don't do any change
 

12099
04:01:47,000 --> 04:01:48,429
so because if you don't do any change
you're you're never going to get to the

12100
04:01:48,429 --> 04:01:48,439
you're you're never going to get to the
 

12101
04:01:48,439 --> 04:01:50,189
you're you're never going to get to the
right answer for the wisdom of the crowd

12102
04:01:50,189 --> 04:01:50,199
right answer for the wisdom of the crowd
 

12103
04:01:50,199 --> 04:01:51,870
right answer for the wisdom of the crowd
to work for free markets to work for

12104
04:01:51,870 --> 04:01:51,880
to work for free markets to work for
 

12105
04:01:51,880 --> 04:01:53,510
to work for free markets to work for
everything to work you have to keep

12106
04:01:53,510 --> 04:01:53,520
everything to work you have to keep
 

12107
04:01:53,520 --> 04:01:55,429
everything to work you have to keep
changing because the times change and

12108
04:01:55,429 --> 04:01:55,439
changing because the times change and
 

12109
04:01:55,439 --> 04:01:57,469
changing because the times change and
the culture changes and the situation

12110
04:01:57,469 --> 04:01:57,479
the culture changes and the situation
 

12111
04:01:57,479 --> 04:02:00,550
the culture changes and the situation
changes right so that's why there's

12112
04:02:00,550 --> 04:02:00,560
changes right so that's why there's
 

12113
04:02:00,560 --> 04:02:02,469
changes right so that's why there's
amendments in the Constitution because

12114
04:02:02,469 --> 04:02:02,479
amendments in the Constitution because
 

12115
04:02:02,479 --> 04:02:04,149
amendments in the Constitution because
you need to be able to change the

12116
04:02:04,149 --> 04:02:04,159
you need to be able to change the
 

12117
04:02:04,159 --> 04:02:05,710
you need to be able to change the
document from time to time be careful

12118
04:02:05,710 --> 04:02:05,720
document from time to time be careful
 

12119
04:02:05,720 --> 04:02:08,349
document from time to time be careful
with it right but you need to allow for

12120
04:02:08,349 --> 04:02:08,359
with it right but you need to allow for
 

12121
04:02:08,359 --> 04:02:12,550
with it right but you need to allow for
an Avenue for change so now why does the

12122
04:02:12,550 --> 04:02:12,560
an Avenue for change so now why does the
 

12123
04:02:12,560 --> 04:02:14,830
an Avenue for change so now why does the
one-third keep winning so many different

12124
04:02:14,830 --> 04:02:14,840
one-third keep winning so many different
 

12125
04:02:14,840 --> 04:02:17,110
one-third keep winning so many different
places because they have more money and

12126
04:02:17,110 --> 04:02:17,120
places because they have more money and
 

12127
04:02:17,120 --> 04:02:18,630
places because they have more money and
power and by the way if you're more

12128
04:02:18,630 --> 04:02:18,640
power and by the way if you're more
 

12129
04:02:18,640 --> 04:02:21,710
power and by the way if you're more
selfish you're more likely to get more

12130
04:02:21,710 --> 04:02:21,720
selfish you're more likely to get more
 

12131
04:02:21,720 --> 04:02:24,149
selfish you're more likely to get more
money in power right and I wish that

12132
04:02:24,149 --> 04:02:24,159
money in power right and I wish that
 

12133
04:02:24,159 --> 04:02:26,670
money in power right and I wish that
weren't the case but it is and these are

12134
04:02:26,670 --> 04:02:26,680
weren't the case but it is and these are
 

12135
04:02:26,680 --> 04:02:29,950
weren't the case but it is and these are
not blanket rules they're on average so

12136
04:02:29,950 --> 04:02:29,960
not blanket rules they're on average so
 

12137
04:02:29,960 --> 04:02:33,950
not blanket rules they're on average so
that third winds up winning in so many

12138
04:02:33,950 --> 04:02:33,960
that third winds up winning in so many
 

12139
04:02:33,960 --> 04:02:36,389
that third winds up winning in so many
circumstances but the bottom line is we

12140
04:02:36,389 --> 04:02:36,399
circumstances but the bottom line is we
 

12141
04:02:36,399 --> 04:02:39,309
circumstances but the bottom line is we
are a species that requires

12142
04:02:39,309 --> 04:02:39,319
are a species that requires
 

12143
04:02:39,319 --> 04:02:41,110
are a species that requires
consent

12144
04:02:41,110 --> 04:02:41,120
consent
 

12145
04:02:41,120 --> 04:02:45,750
consent
so I I mean I'm A Stone Cold atheist so

12146
04:02:45,750 --> 04:02:45,760
so I I mean I'm A Stone Cold atheist so
 

12147
04:02:45,760 --> 04:02:48,110
so I I mean I'm A Stone Cold atheist so
uh so I don't think we're kind of like

12148
04:02:48,110 --> 04:02:48,120
uh so I don't think we're kind of like
 

12149
04:02:48,120 --> 04:02:53,750
uh so I don't think we're kind of like
apes I think we are Apes okay and so and

12150
04:02:53,750 --> 04:02:53,760
apes I think we are Apes okay and so and
 

12151
04:02:53,760 --> 04:02:55,110
apes I think we are Apes okay and so and
all the scientists out there are going

12152
04:02:55,110 --> 04:02:55,120
all the scientists out there are going
 

12153
04:02:55,120 --> 04:02:57,309
all the scientists out there are going
well of course we are everyone else is

12154
04:02:57,309 --> 04:02:57,319
well of course we are everyone else is
 

12155
04:02:57,319 --> 04:03:00,910
well of course we are everyone else is
going that's crazy okay so when you look

12156
04:03:00,910 --> 04:03:00,920
going that's crazy okay so when you look
 

12157
04:03:00,920 --> 04:03:03,149
going that's crazy okay so when you look
at it as a species different species

12158
04:03:03,149 --> 04:03:03,159
at it as a species different species
 

12159
04:03:03,159 --> 04:03:04,870
at it as a species different species
react in different ways snakes have no

12160
04:03:04,870 --> 04:03:04,880
react in different ways snakes have no
 

12161
04:03:04,880 --> 04:03:07,189
react in different ways snakes have no
empathy because it's not in their DNA

12162
04:03:07,189 --> 04:03:07,199
empathy because it's not in their DNA
 

12163
04:03:07,199 --> 04:03:09,790
empathy because it's not in their DNA
they and that's why we have a a sense of

12164
04:03:09,790 --> 04:03:09,800
they and that's why we have a a sense of
 

12165
04:03:09,800 --> 04:03:13,510
they and that's why we have a a sense of
what a snake does right so for good news

12166
04:03:13,510 --> 04:03:13,520
what a snake does right so for good news
 

12167
04:03:13,520 --> 04:03:15,870
what a snake does right so for good news
is for higher level Apes like us bonobos

12168
04:03:15,870 --> 04:03:15,880
is for higher level Apes like us bonobos
 

12169
04:03:15,880 --> 04:03:19,550
is for higher level Apes like us bonobos
