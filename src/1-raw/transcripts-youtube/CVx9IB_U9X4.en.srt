toughness and so I was being responsible

2444
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:02,280
toughness and so I was being responsible
 

2445
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,990
toughness and so I was being responsible
after two rounds that's enough normally

2446
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:04,000
after two rounds that's enough normally
 

2447
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,950
after two rounds that's enough normally
I don't put a guy into box until maybe

2448
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:05,960
I don't put a guy into box until maybe
 

2449
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,750
I don't put a guy into box until maybe
four months 5 months 6 Months 8 months

2450
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:07,760
four months 5 months 6 Months 8 months
 

2451
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,789
four months 5 months 6 Months 8 months
10 it depends what it takes to learn on

2452
00:55:09,789 --> 00:55:09,799
10 it depends what it takes to learn on
 

2453
00:55:09,799 --> 00:55:12,030
10 it depends what it takes to learn on
the floor before it's responsible to put

2454
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:12,040
the floor before it's responsible to put
 

2455
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:15,270
the floor before it's responsible to put
them in the ring to to actually take on

2456
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:15,280
them in the ring to to actually take on
 

2457
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,030
them in the ring to to actually take on
uh incoming real live shells instead of

2458
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:19,040
uh incoming real live shells instead of
 

2459
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:22,990
uh incoming real live shells instead of
blanks yeah and so normally I wouldn't

2460
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:23,000
blanks yeah and so normally I wouldn't
 

2461
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,270
blanks yeah and so normally I wouldn't
have them in and I knew after today he

2462
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:25,280
have them in and I knew after today he
 

2463
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,470
have them in and I knew after today he
wouldn't be in the ring again if I

2464
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:26,480
wouldn't be in the ring again if I
 

2465
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,230
wouldn't be in the ring again if I
trained him I would teach him first and

2466
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:28,240
trained him I would teach him first and
 

2467
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,390
trained him I would teach him first and
then he'd get back in in a few months

2468
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:30,400
then he'd get back in in a few months
 

2469
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,349
then he'd get back in in a few months
but for this day it was the only

2470
00:55:34,349 --> 00:55:34,359

 

2471
00:55:34,359 --> 00:55:36,910

way it's kind of like I used to make

2472
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:36,920
way it's kind of like I used to make
 

2473
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,470
way it's kind of like I used to make
this analogy and C loved it I he said

2474
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:39,480
this analogy and C loved it I he said
 

2475
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,950
this analogy and C loved it I he said
what's traded on fighter what do you

2476
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:40,960
what's traded on fighter what do you
 

2477
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,109
what's traded on fighter what do you
what what do you look for tading a

2478
00:55:42,109 --> 00:55:42,119
what what do you look for tading a
 

2479
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:43,910
what what do you look for tading a
fighter Teddy you know he asked me this

2480
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:43,920
fighter Teddy you know he asked me this
 

2481
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,349
fighter Teddy you know he asked me this
ridiculous question just to test me and

2482
00:55:46,349 --> 00:55:46,359
ridiculous question just to test me and
 

2483
00:55:46,359 --> 00:55:48,710
ridiculous question just to test me and
and I say it's like going to Macy's with

2484

there and um just that there was the
 

3989
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:04,310
there and um just that there was the
existence of test tubes um in the place

3990
01:29:04,310 --> 01:29:04,320
existence of test tubes um in the place
 

3991
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:05,790
existence of test tubes um in the place
because you can't freaking do

3992
01:29:05,790 --> 01:29:05,800
because you can't freaking do
 

3993
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:07,550
because you can't freaking do
experiments without test tubes now

3994
01:29:07,550 --> 01:29:07,560
experiments without test tubes now
 

3995
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:10,189
experiments without test tubes now
you're the scientist with the test tubes

3996
01:29:10,189 --> 01:29:10,199
you're the scientist with the test tubes
 

3997
01:29:10,199 --> 01:29:14,669
you're the scientist with the test tubes
yeah I I I guess so and um I I just hope

3998
01:29:14,669 --> 01:29:14,679
yeah I I I guess so and um I I just hope
 

3999

4001
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:22,510
that um what I said earlier is is
really is really my

4002
01:29:22,510 --> 01:29:22,520
really is really my
 

4003
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:25,189
really is really my
thread through this whole thing when you

4004
01:29:25,189 --> 01:29:25,199
thread through this whole thing when you
 

4005
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:27,830
thread through this whole thing when you
say can you forgive cuss

4006
01:29:27,830 --> 01:29:27,840
say can you forgive cuss
 

4007
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:29,430
say can you forgive cuss
um

4008
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:29,440
um
 

4009
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:32,270
um
I I'm still trying to forgive

4010
01:29:32,270 --> 01:29:32,280
I I'm still trying to forgive
 

4011
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:34,629
I I'm still trying to forgive
myself

4012
01:29:34,629 --> 01:29:34,639
myself
 

4013
01:29:34,639 --> 01:29:37,629
myself
and if if I can have hope that I can

4014
01:29:37,629 --> 01:29:37,639
and if if I can have hope that I can
 

4015
01:29:37,639 --> 01:29:41,189
and if if I can have hope that I can
forgive myself I think that hope has to

4016
01:29:41,189 --> 01:29:41,199
forgive myself I think that hope has to
 

4017
01:29:41,199 --> 01:29:45,750
forgive myself I think that hope has to
start with the power to forgive someone

4018
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:45,760

like how do you try how do you take the
 

5569
02:05:09,079 --> 02:05:10,790
like how do you try how do you take the
leap of trust

5570
02:05:10,790 --> 02:05:10,800
leap of trust
 

5571
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:13,990
leap of trust
towards people again and again after

5572
02:05:13,990 --> 02:05:14,000
towards people again and again after
 

5573
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,310
towards people again and again after
that just by remembering that I'm still

5574
02:05:16,310 --> 02:05:16,320
that just by remembering that I'm still
 

5575
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:19,709
that just by remembering that I'm still
trying to forgive myself

5576
02:05:19,709 --> 02:05:19,719
trying to forgive myself
 

5577
02:05:19,719 --> 02:05:22,669
trying to forgive myself
for the things that I came up short with

5578
02:05:22,669 --> 02:05:22,679
for the things that I came up short with
 

5579
02:05:22,679 --> 02:05:25,189
for the things that I came up short with
and if I haven't figured that out

5580
02:05:25,189 --> 02:05:25,199
and if I haven't figured that out
 

5581
02:05:25,199 --> 02:05:27,790
and if I haven't figured that out
yet it's probably

5582
02:05:27,790 --> 02:05:27,800
yet it's probably
 

5583
02:05:27,800 --> 02:05:32,830
yet it's probably
okay to um to

5584
02:05:32,830 --> 02:05:32,840

 

5585
02:05:32,840 --> 02:05:35,390

5589
02:05:38,320 --> 02:05:40,069
didn't get it at they didn't figure it
out and if I couldn't figure it out and

5590
02:05:40,069 --> 02:05:40,079
out and if I couldn't figure it out and
 

5591
