three different processes that were

66
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:29,360
three different processes that were
 

67
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,270
three different processes that were
taken place in the late 80s and early

68
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:32,280
taken place in the late 80s and early
 

69
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,550
taken place in the late 80s and early
90s and the one was the collapse of

70
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:35,560
90s and the one was the collapse of
 

71
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,310
90s and the one was the collapse of
Communism as ideology another was the

72
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:39,320
Communism as ideology another was the
 

73
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,950
Communism as ideology another was the
end of the Cold War and the third one

74
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:42,960
end of the Cold War and the third one
 

75
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,550
end of the Cold War and the third one
was the end of the Soviet

76
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:45,560
was the end of the Soviet
 

77
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,429
was the end of the Soviet
Union uh all of these processes were

78
00:01:48,429 --> 00:01:48,439
Union uh all of these processes were
 

79
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:51,590
Union uh all of these processes were
interrelated interconnected but when

80
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:51,600
interrelated interconnected but when
 

81
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,270
interrelated interconnected but when
people provide ideology as the

82
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:54,280
people provide ideology as the
 

83
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,910
people provide ideology as the
explanation for all of these processes

84
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:56,920
explanation for all of these processes
 

85
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,149
explanation for all of these processes
that's why I

86
00:01:58,149 --> 00:01:58,159
that's why I
 

87
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,950
that's why I
disagree because ideological collapse

88
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:01,960
disagree because ideological collapse
 

89
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,510
disagree because ideological collapse
happened on the territory of the Soviet

90
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:03,520
happened on the territory of the Soviet
 

91
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,310

about Moscow Leningrad or St Petersburg
 

97
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,190
about Moscow Leningrad or St Petersburg
now ofas St but the fall of the Soviet

98
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:16,200
now ofas St but the fall of the Soviet
 

99
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,030
now ofas St but the fall of the Soviet
Union is about a story in which Vaso and

100
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:20,040
Union is about a story in which Vaso and
 

101
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,309
Union is about a story in which Vaso and
St Petersburg ended up in one country

102
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:23,319
St Petersburg ended up in one country
 

103
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:26,869
St Petersburg ended up in one country
and K of me andan ended in different

104
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:26,879
and K of me andan ended in different
 

105
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,790
and K of me andan ended in different
countries so the theories and EXP

for me this are really very helpful
 

111
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,750

of ideological uh ideological
 

123
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:55,949
of ideological uh ideological
implosion that's that's how I look at

124
00:02:55,949 --> 00:02:55,959
implosion that's that's how I look at
 

125
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:58,229

that's how I
 

129
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,630
that's how I
look at the theories that explain that

130
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:02,640
look at the theories that explain that
 

131
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,910
look at the theories that explain that
collapse so it's a story of geography

132
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:05,920
collapse so it's a story of geography

135
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,470
ideology
economics which are the most important

00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:09,480
economics which are the most important
 

137
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,229
economics which are the most important
to understand of what made the collapse

138
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
to understand of what made the collapse
 

139
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,509
to understand of what made the collapse
of the Soviet Union happen the Soviet

collapse was unique but not more unique
 

143
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,869
collapse was unique but not more unique
than collapse of any other Empire so

144
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:21,879
than collapse of any other Empire so

internationalists how that plays with

210
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:54,720
internationalists how that plays with
 

211
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,189
internationalists how that plays with
the idea of Russian Empire and so on but

212
00:04:57,189 --> 00:04:57,199
the idea of Russian Empire and so on but
 

213
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,230
the idea of Russian Empire and so on but
first let me ask about us influence on

214
00:04:59,230 --> 00:04:59,240
first let me ask about us influence on
 

215
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,510
first let me ask about us influence on
this so so one of the ideas is that you

216
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:02,520
this so so one of the ideas is that you
 

217
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,629
this so so one of the ideas is that you
know through the cold war that mechanism

218
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:05,639
know through the cold war that mechanism
 

219
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,150

us had major interest to weaken the
 

221
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,590
us had major interest to weaken the
Soviet Union and therefore it the

222
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:11,600
Soviet Union and therefore it the
 

223
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,909
Soviet Union and therefore it the
collapse could be attributed to pressure

224
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:14,919
collapse could be attributed to pressure
 

225
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:17,550

00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,000
there truth to that the pressure from
 

229
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,749
there truth to that the pressure from
the United States this is part of the

230
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:21,759

the the politics the political campaign
of course have their own rules and they

326
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:36,120
of course have their own rules and they
 

327
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,150
of course have their own rules and they
produce and give birth to

00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:39,160
produce and give birth to
 

329
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,869
produce and give birth to
mythology with which we we still at

330
00:07:41,869 --> 00:07:41,879
mythology with which we we still at
 

331
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,510
mythology with which we we still at
least in this country we live till now

332
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:43,520
least in this country we live till now
 

333
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,790

till today so gorbachov is an

334
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:45,800
till today so gorbachov is an
 

335
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,869
till today so gorbachov is an
interesting figure in all of this is

336
00:07:47,869 --> 00:07:47,879
interesting figure in all of this is
 

337
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:50,070
interesting figure in all of this is
there possible a history where the

338
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,080
there possible a history where the
 

339
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,990
there possible a history where the
Soviet Union did not collapse and some

340
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:53,000
Soviet Union did not collapse and some
 

341
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,830
Soviet Union did not collapse and some
of the ideas a gorbachov had for the

342
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:54,840
of the ideas a gorbachov had for the
 

343
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,149
of the ideas a gorbachov had for the
future of the Soviet Union came to

344
00:07:57,149 --> 00:07:57,159
future of the Soviet Union came to
 

345
00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:00,149
future of the Soviet Union came to
life of course history on the one hand

346
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:00,159
life of course history on the one hand
 

347
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:02,869
life of course history on the one hand
there is a statement it it doesn't allow

348
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:02,879
there is a statement it it doesn't allow
 

349
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,909
there is a statement it it doesn't allow
for what ifs on the other hand in my

350
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:05,919
for what ifs on the other hand in my
 

351
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,710
for what ifs on the other hand in my
opinion history is full of what if

352
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:09,720
opinion history is full of what if
 

353
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,110
opinion history is full of what if
that's what history is about and

354
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:11,120
that's what history is about and
 

355
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,469
that's what history is about and
certainly certainly there there are

356
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:12,479
certainly certainly there there are
 

357
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,350
certainly certainly there there are
scenarios how the Soviet Union would

358
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,360
scenarios how the Soviet Union would
 

359
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,830
scenarios how the Soviet Union would
would uh continue uh would continue

360
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:18,840
would uh continue uh would continue
 

361
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,110
would uh continue uh would continue
beyond let's say gorbachov's tenure mhm

362
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,120
beyond let's say gorbachov's tenure mhm
 

363
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,270
beyond let's say gorbachov's tenure mhm
and the argument has been made that the

364
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:26,280
and the argument has been made that the
 

365
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,950
and the argument has been made that the
reforms that he introduced that they

366
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:27,960
reforms that he introduced that they
 

367
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,510
reforms that he introduced that they
were mismanaged and they could be

368
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,520
were mismanaged and they could be
 

369
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,469
were mismanaged and they could be
managed differently or there could be no

370
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:31,479
managed differently or there could be no
 

371
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:33,829
managed differently or there could be no
reforms and there could be continuing

372
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:33,839
reforms and there could be continuing
 

373
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,469
reforms and there could be continuing
stagnation so that is all possible what

374
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:37,479
stagnation so that is all possible what
 

375
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:39,990
stagnation so that is all possible what
I think would happen one way or another

376
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,000
I think would happen one way or another
 

377
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,269
I think would happen one way or another
is the Soviet collapse in a different

is the Soviet collapse in a different

form on on somebody else's watch at some
 

381
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,550

00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,670
dealing with not just processes that
were happening in the Soviet Union we're

were happening in the Soviet Union we're
 

387
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,509
were happening in the Soviet Union we're
dealing with global processes and the

00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:56,519
dealing with global processes and the
 

389
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,470
dealing with global processes and the
20th century turned out to be the

00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:58,480
20th century turned out to be the
 

391
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,590
20th century turned out to be the
century of the disintegration of the

392

century of the disintegration of the
 

393
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,870
century of the disintegration of the
empires you look at the globe at the map

394
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:05,880
empires you look at the globe at the map
 

395
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,790
empires you look at the globe at the map
of the world in 1914 and you compare it

396
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:08,800
of the world in 1914 and you compare it
 

397
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,910
of the world in 1914 and you compare it
to to the map at the end of the 20th

century in 1991 1992 and suddenly you
 

401
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,310
century in 1991 1992 and suddenly you
realize that there are many candidates

402
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:18,320
realize that there are many candidates
 

403
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,269
realize that there are many candidates
for being the most important event the

404
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:20,279
for being the most important event the
 

405

States that's the outcome of the

416
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,240
States that's the outcome of the
 

417
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,829
States that's the outcome of the
different processes of the 20th century

different processes of the 20th century

different processes of the 20th century
look Yugoslavia is falling apart around

look Yugoslavia is falling apart around
 

421
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:44,829
look Yugoslavia is falling apart around
the same time

00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:53,399
rare occurrence in in the fall of multi-
 

429
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:56,069
rare occurrence in in the fall of multi-
multinational States so yeah the writing

430
00:09:56,069 --> 00:09:56,079
multinational States so yeah the writing
 

431
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:58,150
multinational States so yeah the writing
was on the wall whether it would happen

432
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,160
was on the wall whether it would happen
 

433
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,389
was on the wall whether it would happen
under gorbach of or later whether it

434
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:00,399
under gorbach of or later whether it
 

435
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,990
under gorbach of or later whether it
would happen as the result of reforms or

436
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,000
would happen as the result of reforms or
 

437
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,870
would happen as the result of reforms or
as the result of no reforms but I I I I

438
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:07,880
as the result of no reforms but I I I I
 

439
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,550
as the result of no reforms but I I I I
think that sooner or later that's that

440
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:10,560
think that sooner or later that's that
 

441
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,030
think that sooner or later that's that
that would happen yeah it's very

442
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,040
that would happen yeah it's very
 

443
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,829
that would happen yeah it's very
possible hundreds of years from now the

444
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:13,839
possible hundreds of years from now the
 

445
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,630
possible hundreds of years from now the
way the 20th century is written

446
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:16,640
way the 20th century is written
 

447
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,470
way the 20th century is written
about as the century defined by the

448
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:20,480
about as the century defined by the
 

449
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,829
about as the century defined by the
collapse of Empires you call the Soviet

Union the last empire the book is called
 

453
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,310
Union the last empire the book is called
the last empire so is there something

454
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,320
the last empire so is there something
 

455
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,110
the last empire so is there something
fundamental about the way the world is

456
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,120
fundamental about the way the world is
 

457
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,030
fundamental about the way the world is
that means it's not conducive to the

00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,040
that means it's not conducive to the
 

459
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,030
that means it's not conducive to the
formation of Empires the meaning that I

460
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:36,040
formation of Empires the meaning that I

the World War II the price was enormous
but the Soviet Union emerged as a great

lives lost at that point the price was
 

711
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,949

00:16:39,949 --> 00:16:39,959
was actually very very low but for Putin
 

713
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:42,509
was actually very very low but for Putin
what was important that the state was

714
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:42,519
what was important that the state was
 

715
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:45,509
what was important that the state was
lost and he in particular was concerned

716
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:45,519
lost and he in particular was concerned
 

717
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,590

about the division of the Russian of the

about the division of the Russian of the
 

719
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,910
about the division of the Russian of the
Russian people which he understood back

720
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:49,920
Russian people which he understood back
 

721
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,509
Russian people which he understood back
then like he understands now in a very

722
00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:52,519
then like he understands now in a very
 

723
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:56,550
then like he understands now in a very
very broad terms so for him for him the

724
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:56,560
very broad terms so for him for him the
 

725
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,670
very broad terms so for him for him the
biggest tragedy is not the loss of life

726
00:16:59,670 --> 00:16:59,680
biggest tragedy is not the loss of life
 

727
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,350
biggest tragedy is not the loss of life
the biggest strategy is the loss of the

728
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:02,360
the biggest strategy is the loss of the
 

729
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,990
the biggest strategy is the loss of the
great power status or or the unity of

00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:17,360
the paper and what is between the lines
 

741
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,230

so both the unity of the sort of quote

let's go back into history what is the
 

753
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:37,549
let's go back into history what is the
origin of uh Slavic Nations we can look

perspectives and we are now making uh
 

759
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,310
perspectives and we are now making uh
major breakthroughs in in answering this

Innovative linguistic analysis the study
 

765
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,070
Innovative linguistic analysis the study
of DNA so that's that's that's really

perspective uh coupled with the fact
 

1827
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,270
perspective uh coupled with the fact
that there's this radical revolutionary

1828

that there's this radical revolutionary
 

1829
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,710
that there's this radical revolutionary
extremist flavor to the way he sees the

world that label just stays that he's a
fascist he's a Nazi uh to what degree is

fascist he's a Nazi uh to what degree is
 

1835
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:51,470
fascist he's a Nazi uh to what degree is
it's true to what degree is it not uh

it's true to what degree is it not uh
this label is certainly promoted by the

1838
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:53,640
this label is certainly promoted by the
 

1839
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,510
this label is certainly promoted by the
first by the Soviet propaganda and then

1840
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:55,520
first by the Soviet propaganda and then
 

1841
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,549
first by the Soviet propaganda and then
by Russia prop Russian propaganda it's

by Russia prop Russian propaganda it's
 

1843
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:01,270
by Russia prop Russian propaganda it's
it's it works very nicely um if you if

1844
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:01,280
it's it works very nicely um if you if
 

1845
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,390
it's it works very nicely um if you if
you focus on the on the years of

1846
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:03,400
you focus on the on the years of
 

1847
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,510
you focus on the on the years of
collaboration uh those were the same

1848
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:05,520
collaboration uh those were the same
 

1849
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,069
collaboration uh those were the same
years when Joseph Stalin collaborated

1850
00:44:08,069 --> 00:44:08,079
years when Joseph Stalin collaborated
 

1851
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:11,870
years when Joseph Stalin collaborated
with Hitler right so we we have we have

1852
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:11,880
with Hitler right so we we have we have
 

1853
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,829
with Hitler right so we we have we have
the same the same reason to call um

1854
00:44:14,829 --> 00:44:14,839
the same the same reason to call um
 

1855
00:44:14,839 --> 00:44:18,030
the same the same reason to call um
Stalin Stalin Nazi collaborator as we

1856
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:18,040
Stalin Stalin Nazi collaborator as we
 

1857
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,990
Stalin Stalin Nazi collaborator as we
have uh the reason to call bandara Nazi

1858
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:21,000
have uh the reason to call bandara Nazi
 

1859
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,589
have uh the reason to call bandara Nazi
collaborator we we look at the at the

1860
00:44:24,589 --> 00:44:24,599
collaborator we we look at the at the
 

1861
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:26,589
collaborator we we look at the at the
situation in the Pacific

1862
00:44:26,589 --> 00:44:26,599
situation in the Pacific
 

1863
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:29,549
situation in the Pacific
in Indonesia in other places uh the

1864
00:44:29,549 --> 00:44:29,559
in Indonesia in other places uh the
 

1865
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:32,829
in Indonesia in other places uh the
leaders who worked together with

1866
00:44:32,829 --> 00:44:32,839
leaders who worked together with
 

1867
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:35,349
leaders who worked together with
Japanese with the idea of promoting

1868
00:44:35,349 --> 00:44:35,359
Japanese with the idea of promoting
 

1869
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:37,589
Japanese with the idea of promoting
independence of their countries after

1870
00:44:37,589 --> 00:44:37,599
independence of their countries after
 

1871
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:39,670
independence of their countries after
the Japanese collapse be become leaders

1872
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:39,680
the Japanese collapse be become leaders
 

1873
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,470
the Japanese collapse be become leaders
of the Empire so the difference with

1874
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:41,480
of the Empire so the difference with
 

1875
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,190
of the Empire so the difference with
Bandera is that he never becomes the

1876
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:43,200
Bandera is that he never becomes the
 

1877
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,309
Bandera is that he never becomes the
leader the leader of Empire and and and

1878
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:47,319
leader the leader of Empire and and and
 

1879
00:44:47,319 --> 00:44:49,750
leader the leader of Empire and and and
Immunity that comes with that with that

1880
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:49,760
Immunity that comes with that with that
 

1881
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,750
Immunity that comes with that with that
position certainly doesn't apply to

1882
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:52,760
position certainly doesn't apply to
 

1883
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:56,349
position certainly doesn't apply to
him but there are other part parts of

1884
00:44:56,349 --> 00:44:56,359
him but there are other part parts of
 

1885
00:44:56,359 --> 00:44:58,349
him but there are other part parts of
his life which certainly certainly put

1886
00:44:58,349 --> 00:44:58,359
his life which certainly certainly put
 

1887
00:44:58,359 --> 00:45:00,790
his life which certainly certainly put
this whole thing in in question the fate

1888
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:00,800
this whole thing in in question the fate
 

1889
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,349
this whole thing in in question the fate
of his family his own time in the German

1890
00:45:04,349 --> 00:45:04,359
of his family his own time in the German
 

1891
00:45:04,359 --> 00:45:07,630
of his family his own time in the German
concentration camp uh certainly Don't

1892
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:07,640
concentration camp uh certainly Don't
 

1893
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:10,750
concentration camp uh certainly Don't
Fit Don't Fit the the propaganda one

1894
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:10,760
Fit Don't Fit the the propaganda one

00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:16,800
him being a hero that's that's a very
 

1899
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,510
him being a hero that's that's a very
very interesting question because he is

1900
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:19,520
very interesting question because he is
 

1901
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,430
very interesting question because he is
perceived in Ukraine today by not

the the Soviet Union and by extension

1910
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:34,960
the the Soviet Union and by extension
 

1911
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,510
the the Soviet Union and by extension
against Russia and Russian occupation so

1912
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:37,520
against Russia and Russian occupation so
 

1913
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:42,270
against Russia and Russian occupation so
his popularity grew after February 24th

1914
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:42,280
his popularity grew after February 24th
 

1915
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,750
his popularity grew after February 24th
2022 as a symbol of that resistance

1916
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:45,760
2022 as a symbol of that resistance
 

1917
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,870
2022 as a symbol of that resistance
again we are talking here about myth and

1918
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:47,880
again we are talking here about myth and
 

1919
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,069
again we are talking here about myth and
mythology because Bandera was not

1920
00:45:51,069 --> 00:45:51,079
mythology because Bandera was not
 

1921
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:54,549
mythology because Bandera was not
leading the fight against the Soviet U

1922
00:45:54,549 --> 00:45:54,559
leading the fight against the Soviet U
 

1923
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:58,430
leading the fight against the Soviet U
the the the Soviet occupation in uh in

1924
00:45:58,430 --> 00:45:58,440
the the the Soviet occupation in uh in
 

1925
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,309
the the the Soviet occupation in uh in
Ukraine because at that time he was just

1926
00:46:00,309 --> 00:46:00,319
Ukraine because at that time he was just
 

1927
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:02,670
Ukraine because at that time he was just
simply not in Ukraine he was in Germany

1928
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:02,680
simply not in Ukraine he was in Germany
 

1929
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,790
simply not in Ukraine he was in Germany
and you can imagine that geography

1930
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:04,800
and you can imagine that geography
 

1931
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,670
and you can imagine that geography
mattered at that time much more than it

1932
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:06,680
mattered at that time much more than it
 

1933
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,670
mattered at that time much more than it
matters today uh there's a million

1934
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:08,680
matters today uh there's a million
 

1935
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,750
matters today uh there's a million
questions to ask here I think it's an

1936
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:10,760
questions to ask here I think it's an
 

1937
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,349
questions to ask here I think it's an
important topic because it is at the

1938
00:46:13,349 --> 00:46:13,359
important topic because it is at the
 

1939
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:17,710
important topic because it is at the
center of the claimed reason that the

1940
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:17,720
center of the claimed reason that the
 

1941
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,309
center of the claimed reason that the
war continues in Ukraine so I would like

1942
00:46:20,309 --> 00:46:20,319
war continues in Ukraine so I would like
 

1943
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,710
war continues in Ukraine so I would like
to explore that from from different

1944
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:21,720
to explore that from from different
 

1945
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,150
to explore that from from different
angles but just to clarify was there a

1946
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:24,160
angles but just to clarify was there a
 

1947
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:28,030
angles but just to clarify was there a
moment where Bandera chose

1948
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:28,040

 

1949
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,230

Nazi Germany over the Red Army When The

1950
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:31,240
Nazi Germany over the Red Army When The
 

1951
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:35,630
Nazi Germany over the Red Army When The
War already began so in the list of uh

1952
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:35,640
War already began so in the list of uh
 

1953
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,790
War already began so in the list of uh
allegiances is Ukraine's Independence

1954
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:38,800
allegiances is Ukraine's Independence
 

1955
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,470
allegiances is Ukraine's Independence
more important than fighting Nazi

1956
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:41,480
more important than fighting Nazi
 

1957
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,790
more important than fighting Nazi
Germany

1958
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:42,800
Germany
 

1959
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,190
Germany
essentially the Ukrainian Independence

1960
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:45,200
essentially the Ukrainian Independence
 

1961
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,630
essentially the Ukrainian Independence
was the their goal and they were there

1962
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:48,640
was the their goal and they were there
 

1963
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,549
was the their goal and they were there
to to work with anybody who would who

1964
00:46:52,549 --> 00:46:52,559
to to work with anybody who would who
 

1965
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:55,470
to to work with anybody who would who
would support and and in one way or at

1966
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:55,480
would support and and in one way or at
 

1967
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,950
would support and and in one way or at
least allow the Ukrainian Independence

1968
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:57,960
least allow the Ukrainian Independence
 

1969
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,790
least allow the Ukrainian Independence
so the there is no question that uh they

1970
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:00,800
so the there is no question that uh they
 

1971
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,510
so the there is no question that uh they
they are just classic nationalists so

1972
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:03,520
they are just classic nationalists so
 

1973
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:07,790
they are just classic nationalists so
the the goal is uh nationalism is the

1974
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:07,800
the the goal is uh nationalism is the
 

1975
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,990
the the goal is uh nationalism is the
principle According to which the at

1976
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:10,000
principle According to which the at
 

1977
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,190
principle According to which the at
least one definitions is According to

1978
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:12,200
least one definitions is According to
 

1979
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,510
least one definitions is According to
which the cultural boundaries coincide

1980
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:15,520
which the cultural boundaries coincide
 

1981
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,870
which the cultural boundaries coincide
with political boundaries so their goal

1982
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:18,880
with political boundaries so their goal
 

1983
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,190
with political boundaries so their goal
was to create political boundaries that

1984
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:22,200
was to create political boundaries that
 

1985
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,470
was to create political boundaries that
would coincide with the geographic

1986
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:24,480
would coincide with the geographic
 

1987
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,549
would coincide with the geographic
boundaries in the conditions of the

1988
00:47:26,549 --> 00:47:26,559
boundaries in the conditions of the
 

1989
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:29,069
boundaries in the conditions of the
World War II and certainly making making

1990
00:47:29,069 --> 00:47:29,079
World War II and certainly making making
 

1991
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:34,069
World War II and certainly making making
deals with with whoever would would

1992
00:47:34,069 --> 00:47:34,079
deals with with whoever would would
 

1993
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:36,950
deals with with whoever would would
uh would either support as I said or

1994
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:36,960
uh would either support as I said or
 

1995
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,190
uh would either support as I said or
tolerate that that project of theirs so

1996
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:40,200
tolerate that that project of theirs so
 

1997
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,190
tolerate that that project of theirs so
I would love to find the line between

1998
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:43,200
I would love to find the line between
 

1999
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,270
I would love to find the line between
nationalism even extreme nationalism and

2000
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:45,280
nationalism even extreme nationalism and
 

2001
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,349
nationalism even extreme nationalism and
Fascism and

Bandera
 

2029

Bandera
himself um in terms of fascist

2030
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:27,880

 

2031
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,390

there is very clear and there is

2032
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:29,400
there is very clear and there is
 

2033
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,790
there is very clear and there is
research done that in particular Italian

2034
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:31,800
research done that in particular Italian
 

2035
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:35,750
research done that in particular Italian
fascist fascism had influence uh on the

2036
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:35,760
fascist fascism had influence uh on the
 

2037
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,790
fascist fascism had influence uh on the
on the thinking of people in that

2038
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:37,800
on the thinking of people in that
 

2039
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,950
on the thinking of people in that
organization including people at the top

2040
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:40,960
organization including people at the top
 

2041
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,150
organization including people at the top
but it is also very important to um keep

2042
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:44,160
but it is also very important to um keep
 

2043
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,230
but it is also very important to um keep
in

2044
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:45,240
in
 

2045
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:48,510
in
mind that they call themselves

2046
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:48,520
mind that they call themselves
 

2047
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,990
mind that they call themselves
nationalists and

2048
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:50,000
nationalists and
 

2049
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,109
nationalists and
revolutionaries and despite the fact

2050
00:48:53,109 --> 00:48:53,119
revolutionaries and despite the fact
 

2051
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:57,829
revolutionaries and despite the fact
that in 1939 in 1940 1941 it was very

2052
00:48:57,829 --> 00:48:57,839
that in 1939 in 1940 1941 it was very
 

2053
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:00,270
that in 1939 in 1940 1941 it was very
beneficial for them to declare

2054
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:00,280
beneficial for them to declare
 

2055
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,270
beneficial for them to declare
themselves to be Ukrainian

2056
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:02,280
themselves to be Ukrainian
 

2057
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:06,270
themselves to be Ukrainian
fascists and establish this bond with

2058
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:06,280
fascists and establish this bond with
 

2059
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:10,270
fascists and establish this bond with
not just with with Italy but with uh uh

2060
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:10,280
not just with with Italy but with uh uh
 

2061
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:14,750
not just with with Italy but with uh uh
Nazi Germany they refused to do that and

2062
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:14,760
Nazi Germany they refused to do that and
 

2063
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,630
Nazi Germany they refused to do that and
then they refused to recall their

2064
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:16,640
then they refused to recall their
 

2065
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:21,990
then they refused to recall their
independence so uh influences yes but

2066
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:22,000
independence so uh influences yes but
 

2067
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,309
independence so uh influences yes but
but clearly it's it's it's it's a

2068
00:49:24,309 --> 00:49:24,319

theories uh but also my understanding is
 

2087
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:59,230
theories uh but also my understanding is
that um they are extremely

2088
00:49:59,230 --> 00:49:59,240
that um they are extremely
 

2089
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:03,230
that um they are extremely
marginal and they're more marginal than

Europe maybe in the US as
well and for me the question is not

2096
00:50:16,549 --> 00:50:16,559
well and for me the question is not
 

2097
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:18,670
well and for me the question is not
whether the Ukraine has

2098
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:18,680
whether the Ukraine has
 

2099
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:23,150
whether the Ukraine has
it but why even in the conditions of the

2100
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:23,160
it but why even in the conditions of the
 

2101
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,190
it but why even in the conditions of the
war the radical nationalism

political Nation so for me as a scholar

2128
00:51:05,789 --> 00:51:05,799
political Nation so for me as a scholar
 

2129
00:51:05,799 --> 00:51:09,589
political Nation so for me as a scholar
and a researcher what I see is that uh

2130
00:51:09,589 --> 00:51:09,599
and a researcher what I see is that uh
 

2131
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:12,910
and a researcher what I see is that uh

and in Europe in general and the
 

2141
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:25,910
and in Europe in general and the
question is why I I don't know I have

2142
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:25,920
question is why I I don't know I have
 

2143
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,349
question is why I I don't know I have
I I I I don't know answer but that's

2144
00:51:28,349 --> 00:51:28,359
I I I I don't know answer but that's
 

2145
00:51:28,359 --> 00:51:31,309
I I I I don't know answer but that's
that's that that's the question that I

2146
00:51:31,309 --> 00:51:31,319
that's that that's the question that I
 

2147
00:51:31,319 --> 00:51:34,230
that's that that's the question that I
think is interesting to answer how how

2148
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:34,240
think is interesting to answer how how

2165
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:57,750
this this the the really from my my
point of view interesting interesting

2166
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:57,760
point of view interesting interesting
 

2167
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,390
point of view interesting interesting
questions and again we we can we can

2168
00:51:59,390 --> 00:51:59,400
questions and again we we can we can
 

2169
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,069
questions and again we we can we can
certainly debate that so uh just for

2170
00:52:02,069 --> 00:52:02,079
certainly debate that so uh just for
 

2171
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,710
certainly debate that so uh just for
context the the the most popular far

2172
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:04,720
context the the the most popular far
 

2173
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:08,069
context the the the most popular far
right party won 2.15% of the vote in

2175
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:10,789
right party won 2.15% of the vote in
2019 this is before the war so that's

2176
00:52:10,789 --> 00:52:10,799
2019 this is before the war so that's
 

2177
00:52:10,799 --> 00:52:12,870
2019 this is before the war so that's
where things stood it's unclear where

2178
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:12,880
where things stood it's unclear where
 

2179
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,030
where things stood it's unclear where
they stand now it'd be an interesting

2180
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:15,040
they stand now it'd be an interesting
 

2181
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,750
they stand now it'd be an interesting
question whether it escalated and how

2182
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:16,760
question whether it escalated and how
 

2183
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,670
question whether it escalated and how
much what you're saying is that war in

2184
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:19,680
much what you're saying is that war in
 

2185
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:23,670
much what you're saying is that war in
general can serve as a catalyst for

2186
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:23,680
general can serve as a catalyst for
 

2187
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,430
general can serve as a catalyst for
expansion of extremist groups

2188
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:26,440
expansion of extremist groups
 

2189
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,230
expansion of extremist groups
of extremist nationalistic groups

2190
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:28,240
of extremist nationalistic groups
 

2191
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,549
of extremist nationalistic groups
especially like the far right and it's

2192
00:52:31,549 --> 00:52:31,559
especially like the far right and it's
 

2193
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:34,549
especially like the far right and it's
interesting to see to what degree they

2194
00:52:34,549 --> 00:52:34,559
interesting to see to what degree they
 

2195
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,549
interesting to see to what degree they
have or have not risen to power in the

2196
00:52:37,549 --> 00:52:37,559
have or have not risen to power in the
 

2197
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:40,950
have or have not risen to power in the
sort of in the shadows so no nationalist

2198
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:40,960
sort of in the shadows so no nationalist
 

2199
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,190
sort of in the shadows so no nationalist
or nationalistic party actually crossed

2200
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:43,200
or nationalistic party actually crossed
 

2201
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,630
or nationalistic party actually crossed
the the barrier to get into the

2202
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:44,640
the the barrier to get into the
 

2203
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,430
the the barrier to get into the
parliament so Ukraine is the country

2204
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:46,440

00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,990
where there is no
right of far right in the parliament we

2208
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:51,000
right of far right in the parliament we
 

2209

just uh
um one more way to to to stress this

2216
00:52:59,270 --> 00:52:59,280
um one more way to to to stress this

more than 2% so that's that's the
 

2241

suddenly suddenly people not just start

2320
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:17,160
suddenly suddenly people not just start
 

2321
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,950
suddenly suddenly people not just start
listening they just stop

2322
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:19,960
listening they just stop
 

2323
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:23,270
listening they just stop
analyzing and as a as a propaganda tool

2324
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:23,280
analyzing and as a as a propaganda tool
 

2325
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,270
analyzing and as a as a propaganda tool
this is this is of course Very very

2326
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:25,280
this is this is of course Very very
 

2327
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,750
this is this is of course Very very
powerful tool um in terms of to what

2328
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:28,760
powerful tool um in terms of to what
 

2329
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,990
powerful tool um in terms of to what
degree this is this this is the real

2330
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:31,000
degree this is this this is the real
 

2331
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,750
degree this is this this is the real
goal or not we discussed the the

2332
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:33,760
goal or not we discussed the the
 

2333
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,109
goal or not we discussed the the
importance of the far right in in in

2334
00:55:36,109 --> 00:55:36,119
importance of the far right in in in
 

2335
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:39,510
importance of the far right in in in
Europe and and in Ukraine so if that's

2336
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:39,520
Europe and and in Ukraine so if that's
 

2337
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,829
Europe and and in Ukraine so if that's
the real goal of the war probably the

2338
00:55:41,829 --> 00:55:41,839
the real goal of the war probably the
 

2339
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,510
the real goal of the war probably the
war would have to start not against

2340
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:43,520
war would have to start not against
 

2341
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,309
war would have to start not against
Ukraine but probably against France or

2342
00:55:45,309 --> 00:55:45,319
Ukraine but probably against France or
 

2343
00:55:45,319 --> 00:55:47,349
Ukraine but probably against France or
some other country if you take this at

2344
00:55:47,349 --> 00:55:47,359
some other country if you take this at
 

2345
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:49,670
some other country if you take this at
face failure well there's something

2346
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:49,680
face failure well there's something
 

2347
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:53,069
face failure well there's something
really interesting here as you mentioned

2348
00:55:53,069 --> 00:55:53,079
really interesting here as you mentioned
 

2349
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:56,230
really interesting here as you mentioned
I spoken to a lot of people in

2350
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:56,240
I spoken to a lot of people in
 

2351
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:00,390
I spoken to a lot of people in
Russia and uh you said analysis

2352
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:00,400
Russia and uh you said analysis
 

2353
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,950
Russia and uh you said analysis
stops in the west people look at the

2354
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:02,960
stops in the west people look at the
 

2355
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,190
stops in the west people look at the
word denotification and look at the

2356
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:05,200
word denotification and look at the
 

2357
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,230
word denotification and look at the
things we've just discussed and kind

2358
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:07,240
things we've just discussed and kind
 

2359
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:10,990
things we've just discussed and kind
of almost think this this is absurd when

2360
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:11,000
of almost think this this is absurd when
 

2361
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,750
of almost think this this is absurd when
you talk to people in Russia maybe it's

2362
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:13,760
you talk to people in Russia maybe it's
 

2363
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,109
you talk to people in Russia maybe it's
deep in there somewhere the history of

2364
00:56:16,109 --> 00:56:16,119
deep in there somewhere the history of
 

2365
00:56:16,119 --> 00:56:19,549
deep in there somewhere the history of
World War II still reverberates through

2366
00:56:19,549 --> 00:56:19,559
World War II still reverberates through
 

2367
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:23,510
World War II still reverberates through
the maybe the fears uh maybe the pride

2368
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:23,520
the maybe the fears uh maybe the pride
 

2369
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,349
the maybe the fears uh maybe the pride
whatever the Deep emotion

2370
00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:26,359
whatever the Deep emotion
 

2371
00:56:26,359 --> 00:56:29,069
whatever the Deep emotion
uh history is there it seems that the

2372
00:56:29,069 --> 00:56:29,079
uh history is there it seems that the
 

2373
00:56:29,079 --> 00:56:30,510
uh history is there it seems that the
goal of

2374
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:30,520
goal of
 

2375
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,950
goal of
denazification appears to be reasonable

2376
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:32,960
denazification appears to be reasonable
 

2377
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,230
denazification appears to be reasonable
for people in Russia they don't seem to

2378
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:36,240
for people in Russia they don't seem to
 

2379
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,549
for people in Russia they don't seem to
see the absurdity or the complexity or

2380
00:56:39,549 --> 00:56:39,559
see the absurdity or the complexity or
 

2381
00:56:39,559 --> 00:56:42,230
see the absurdity or the complexity or
the even the need for analysis I guess

there's actually complexities to Wars we
 

2677
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,390
there's actually complexities to Wars we
can talk about for example a lot of dark

2678
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:32,400
can talk about for example a lot of dark
 

2679
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,750
can talk about for example a lot of dark
aspects on all sides of World War II the

2680
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:34,760

the the Red Army when they say martial
 

2685
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,789
the the Red Army when they say martial
German there's a lot of really dark

2686
01:03:41,789 --> 01:03:41,799
German there's a lot of really dark
 

2687
01:03:41,799 --> 01:03:45,670
German there's a lot of really dark
complexity and on all sides so you know

2688
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:45,680
complexity and on all sides so you know
 

2689
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,150
complexity and on all sides so you know
that could be an opportunity to explore

2690
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:47,160
that could be an opportunity to explore
 

2691
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,910
that could be an opportunity to explore
the dark complexity that some of the

2692
01:03:48,910 --> 01:03:48,920
the dark complexity that some of the
 

2693
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:52,349
the dark complexity that some of the
ukrainians were in the SS uh or Bandera

2694
01:03:52,349 --> 01:03:52,359
ukrainians were in the SS uh or Bandera
 

2695
01:03:52,359 --> 01:03:54,269
ukrainians were in the SS uh or Bandera
the the complexities there but I think

2696
01:03:54,269 --> 01:03:54,279
the the complexities there but I think
 

2697
01:03:54,279 --> 01:03:57,150
the the complexities there but I think
they were doing not a complex thing they

2698
01:03:57,150 --> 01:03:57,160
they were doing not a complex thing they
 

2699
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:00,109
they were doing not a complex thing they
were doing a very shallow applaud and we

2700
01:04:00,109 --> 01:04:00,119
were doing a very shallow applaud and we
 

2701
01:04:00,119 --> 01:04:02,670
were doing a very shallow applaud and we
should applaud Veterans of course but in

2702
01:04:02,670 --> 01:04:02,680
should applaud Veterans of course but in
 

2703
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:04,349
should applaud Veterans of course but in
that case they were doing it for show

2704
01:04:04,349 --> 01:04:04,359
that case they were doing it for show
 

2705
01:04:04,359 --> 01:04:06,910
that case they were doing it for show
for zilinski and so on so we should

2706
01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:06,920
for zilinski and so on so we should
 

2707
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:09,870
for zilinski and so on so we should
clarify that the Applause

2708
01:04:09,870 --> 01:04:09,880
clarify that the Applause
 

2709
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:14,230
clarify that the Applause

01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:52,789
only way how you deal with propaganda
because propaganda is not necessarily

something that uh is is an outright lie
 

2833
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:02,109
something that uh is is an outright lie
it can be just one factor that taken out

it can be just one factor that taken out
 

2835
01:07:02,119 --> 01:07:05,829
it can be just one factor that taken out
of the context and and is is blown out

2837
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:08,549
of the context and and is is blown out
of proportion and that's that is good

2838
01:07:08,549 --> 01:07:08,559
of proportion and that's that is good
 

2839
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:10,990
of proportion and that's that is good
enough uh in the way to defend against

01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:11,000
enough uh in the way to defend against
 

2841
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,910
enough uh in the way to defend against
that is to bring in the

economy and
uh dbas is a classical Rust Belt and we

3978
01:34:43,430 --> 01:34:43,440
uh dbas is a classical Rust Belt and we
 

3979
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:45,990
uh dbas is a classical Rust Belt and we
know what happens with the cities that

3980
01:34:45,990 --> 01:34:46,000
know what happens with the cities that
 

3981
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,070
know what happens with the cities that
were part of the first or second wave of

01:43:17,589 --> 01:43:17,599
in the people self report and of viws of

01:43:17,599 --> 01:43:20,430
in the people self report and of viws of
Ukrainian in 2014 and 2015 at the time

4332
01:43:20,430 --> 01:43:20,440
Ukrainian in 2014 and 2015 at the time
 

4333
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:24,510
Ukrainian in 2014 and 2015 at the time
of the start of the war when the the the

4334
01:43:24,510 --> 01:43:24,520
of the start of the war when the the the
 

4335
01:43:24,520 --> 01:43:27,790
of the start of the war when the the the
the threat was the most clear one this

4336
01:43:27,790 --> 01:43:27,800
the threat was the most clear one this
 

4337
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:30,030
the threat was the most clear one this
is self-reporting that doesn't mean that

4338
01:43:30,030 --> 01:43:30,040
is self-reporting that doesn't mean that
 

4339
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:32,589
is self-reporting that doesn't mean that
people exactly do what what but they

4340
01:43:32,589 --> 01:43:32,599
people exactly do what what but they
 

4341
01:43:32,599 --> 01:43:34,149
people exactly do what what but they
believe that that's what that they

4342
01:43:34,149 --> 01:43:34,159
believe that that's what that they
 

4343
01:43:34,159 --> 01:43:37,950
believe that that's what that they
supposed to do and then return back to

4344
01:43:37,950 --> 01:43:37,960
supposed to do and then return back to
 

4345
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:41,550
supposed to do and then return back to
to where it was by the year 2016 and

4346
01:43:41,550 --> 01:43:41,560
to where it was by the year 2016 and
 

4347
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:45,629
to where it was by the year 2016 and
2017 so this this Dynamic can can repeat

4348
01:43:45,629 --> 01:43:45,639
2017 so this this Dynamic can can repeat
 

4349
01:43:45,639 --> 01:43:49,109
2017 so this this Dynamic can can repeat
itself but given given the how long the

4350
01:43:49,109 --> 01:43:49,119
itself but given given the how long the
 

4351
01:43:49,119 --> 01:43:52,430
itself but given given the how long the
war is going on how big the impact how

4352
01:43:52,430 --> 01:43:52,440
war is going on how big the impact how
 

4353
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:55,950
war is going on how big the impact how
big the stresses and that the the the

4354
01:43:55,950 --> 01:43:55,960
big the stresses and that the the the
 

4355
01:43:55,960 --> 01:43:58,470
big the stresses and that the the the
way the wave of the future is probably

4356
01:43:58,470 --> 01:43:58,480
way the wave of the future is probably
 

4357
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:00,149
way the wave of the future is probably
associated with younger people who are

4358
01:44:00,149 --> 01:44:00,159
associated with younger people who are
 

4359
01:44:00,159 --> 01:44:02,990
associated with younger people who are
switching to Ukrainian so I would I

4360

Empire what they find there are imperial

4562
01:48:56,910 --> 01:48:56,920
Empire what they find there are imperial
 

4563
01:48:56,920 --> 01:49:00,149
Empire what they find there are imperial
projects and and that's that's that's

4564
01:49:00,149 --> 01:49:00,159
projects and and that's that's that's
 

4565
01:49:00,159 --> 01:49:02,709
projects and and that's that's that's
certainly the story of the of the

4566
01:49:02,709 --> 01:49:02,719
certainly the story of the of the
 

4567
01:49:02,719 --> 01:49:04,510
certainly the story of the of the
Putin's claim that's the story of the

4568
01:49:04,510 --> 01:49:04,520
Putin's claim that's the story of the
 

4569
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:08,270
Putin's claim that's the story of the
argument and to to conclude the argument

4570
01:49:08,270 --> 01:49:08,280
argument and to to conclude the argument
 

4571
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:10,310
argument and to to conclude the argument
that he lays out there historical

4572
01:49:10,310 --> 01:49:10,320
that he lays out there historical
 

4573
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:13,350
that he lays out there historical
argument comes also almost directly from

4574
01:49:13,350 --> 01:49:13,360
argument comes also almost directly from
 

4575
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:15,550
argument comes also almost directly from
the narratives of the late 19th and the

4576
01:49:15,550 --> 01:49:15,560
the narratives of the late 19th and the
 

4577
01:49:15,560 --> 01:49:17,270
the narratives of the late 19th and the
beginning of the 20th century so it's

4578
01:49:17,270 --> 01:49:17,280
beginning of the 20th century so it's
 

4579
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:20,229
beginning of the 20th century so it's
not only the argument is coming from the

4580
01:49:20,229 --> 01:49:20,239
not only the argument is coming from the
 

4581
01:49:20,239 --> 01:49:23,109
not only the argument is coming from the
that era but also the argumentation is

4582
01:49:23,109 --> 01:49:23,119
that era but also the argumentation is
 

4583
01:49:23,119 --> 01:49:25,229
that era but also the argumentation is
is coming from that era as well but that

4584
01:49:25,229 --> 01:49:25,239

similarities but this similarities also

4744
01:53:08,270 --> 01:53:08,280
similarities but this similarities also
 

4745
01:53:08,280 --> 01:53:10,350
similarities but this similarities also
very often

4746
01:53:10,350 --> 01:53:10,360
very often
 

4747
01:53:10,360 --> 01:53:14,629
very often
obscure things that uh that became so

4748
01:53:14,629 --> 01:53:14,639
obscure things that uh that became so
 

4749
01:53:14,639 --> 01:53:17,550
obscure things that uh that became so
important in the course of this war and

4750
01:53:17,550 --> 01:53:17,560
important in the course of this war and
 

4751
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:20,629
important in the course of this war and
I already mentioned the book uh

4752
01:53:20,629 --> 01:53:20,639
I already mentioned the book uh
 

4753
01:53:20,639 --> 01:53:23,189
I already mentioned the book uh
titled by by by President kushma of

titled by by by President kushma of
Ukraine Ukraine is not Russia so that's

4756
01:53:26,350 --> 01:53:26,360
Ukraine Ukraine is not Russia so that's
 

4757
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:28,069
Ukraine Ukraine is not Russia so that's
that's the argument despite the fact

4758
01:53:28,069 --> 01:53:28,079
that's the argument despite the fact
 

4759
01:53:28,079 --> 01:53:30,870
that's the argument despite the fact
that you think that we are the same we

4760
01:53:30,870 --> 01:53:30,880
that you think that we are the same we
 

4761
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:31,870
that you think that we are the same we
behave

4762
01:53:31,870 --> 01:53:31,880
behave
 

4763
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:34,270
behave
differently and it turned out that they

4764
01:53:34,270 --> 01:53:34,280
differently and it turned out that they
 

4765
01:53:34,280 --> 01:53:37,390
differently and it turned out that they
behave differently you have botne in in

4766
01:53:37,390 --> 01:53:37,400
behave differently you have botne in in
 

4767
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:40,189
behave differently you have botne in in
Moscow and police violence and that's

4768
01:53:40,189 --> 01:53:40,199
Moscow and police violence and that's
 

4769
01:53:40,199 --> 01:53:44,189
Moscow and police violence and that's
the end of it you have the um maidan in

4770
01:53:44,189 --> 01:53:44,199
the end of it you have the um maidan in
 

4771
01:53:44,199 --> 01:53:46,790
the end of it you have the um maidan in
Ukraine and you have police violence and

4772
01:53:46,790 --> 01:53:46,800
Ukraine and you have police violence and
 

4773
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:49,069
Ukraine and you have police violence and
that's that's the beginning that's not

4774
01:53:49,069 --> 01:53:49,079
that's that's the beginning that's not
 

4775
01:53:49,079 --> 01:53:50,310
that's that's the beginning that's not
the end

4776
01:53:50,310 --> 01:53:50,320
the end
 

4777
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:54,990
the end
history really matters in in the way why

4778
01:53:54,990 --> 01:53:55,000
history really matters in in the way why
 

4779
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:58,310
history really matters in in the way why
why uh sometimes people speaking the

01:53:58,310 --> 01:53:58,320
why uh sometimes people speaking the
 

4781
01:53:58,320 --> 01:54:00,470
why uh sometimes people speaking the
same language with different accents

4782
01:54:00,470 --> 01:54:00,480
same language with different accents
 

4783
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:03,470
same language with different accents
behave very differently Russia and

4784
01:54:03,470 --> 01:54:03,480
behave very differently Russia and
 

4785
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:06,709
behave very differently Russia and
Russian identity was formed around the

4786
01:54:06,709 --> 01:54:06,719
Russian identity was formed around the
 

4787
01:54:06,719 --> 01:54:09,310
Russian identity was formed around the
state and has difficulty imagining

4788
01:54:09,310 --> 01:54:09,320
state and has difficulty imagining
 

4789
01:54:09,320 --> 01:54:12,030
state and has difficulty imagining
itself outside of the state and that

4790
01:54:12,030 --> 01:54:12,040
itself outside of the state and that
 

4791
01:54:12,040 --> 01:54:14,109
itself outside of the state and that
state happened to be Imperial from most

4792
01:54:14,109 --> 01:54:14,119
state happened to be Imperial from most

state Ukraine came into existence out of
the parts of different Empires which

01:54:27,109 --> 01:54:27,119
the parts of different Empires which
 

4801
01:54:27,119 --> 01:54:29,109
the parts of different Empires which
means they left different cultural

4802
01:54:29,109 --> 01:54:29,119
means they left different cultural

impact on them and for ukrainians to
 

4805
01:54:31,560 --> 01:54:35,189
impact on them and for ukrainians to
stay together autocratic regime so far

4806
01:54:35,189 --> 01:54:35,199
stay together autocratic regime so far
 

4807
01:54:35,199 --> 01:54:37,669
stay together autocratic regime so far
didn't work it's like the colonies of

4808
01:54:37,669 --> 01:54:37,679
didn't work it's like the colonies of
 

4809
01:54:37,679 --> 01:54:41,030
didn't work it's like the colonies of
the United States you have to you have

4810
01:54:41,030 --> 01:54:41,040
the United States you have to you have
 

4811
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:43,350
the United States you have to you have
to find common language you you have to

4812
01:54:43,350 --> 01:54:43,360
to find common language you you have to
 

4813
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:47,310
to find common language you you have to
talk to each other and that became part

4814
01:54:47,310 --> 01:54:47,320
talk to each other and that became part
 

4815
01:54:47,320 --> 01:54:50,669
talk to each other and that became part
of the Ukrainian political DNA

4816
01:54:50,669 --> 01:54:50,679
of the Ukrainian political DNA
 

4817
01:54:50,679 --> 01:54:53,470
of the Ukrainian political DNA
and that that became a huge factor in

4818
01:54:53,470 --> 01:54:53,480
and that that became a huge factor in
 

4819
01:54:53,480 --> 01:54:57,109
and that that became a huge factor in
the war and um very few people in

4820
01:54:57,109 --> 01:54:57,119
the war and um very few people in
 

4821
01:54:57,119 --> 01:54:59,830
the war and um very few people in
Ukraine believed what what Vladimir

4822
01:54:59,830 --> 01:54:59,840
Ukraine believed what what Vladimir
 

4823
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:01,350
Ukraine believed what what Vladimir
Putin was saying that Russians and

4824
01:55:01,350 --> 01:55:01,360
Putin was saying that Russians and
 

4825
01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:03,750
Putin was saying that Russians and
ukrainians were one and the same people

4826
01:55:03,750 --> 01:55:03,760
ukrainians were one and the same people
 

4827
01:55:03,760 --> 01:55:05,589
ukrainians were one and the same people
but the majority

4828
01:55:05,589 --> 01:55:05,599
but the majority
 

4829
01:55:05,599 --> 01:55:08,950
but the majority
believed that they're certainly close

4830
01:55:08,950 --> 01:55:08,960
believed that they're certainly close
 

4831
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:11,589
believed that they're certainly close
culturally and historically Nations and

4832
01:55:11,589 --> 01:55:11,599
culturally and historically Nations and
 

4833
01:55:11,599 --> 01:55:14,189
culturally and historically Nations and
from that point of view the bombardment

4834
01:55:14,189 --> 01:55:14,199
from that point of view the bombardment
 

4835
01:55:14,199 --> 01:55:15,589
from that point of view the bombardment
of the Ukrainian

4836
01:55:15,589 --> 01:55:15,599
of the Ukrainian
 

4837
01:55:15,599 --> 01:55:18,189
of the Ukrainian
cities became such a shock to the

4838
01:55:18,189 --> 01:55:18,199
cities became such a shock to the
 

4839
01:55:18,199 --> 01:55:20,149
cities became such a shock to the
ukrainians because

4840
01:55:20,149 --> 01:55:20,159
ukrainians because
 

4841
01:55:20,159 --> 01:55:23,069
ukrainians because
down they they maybe looked at Syria

4842
01:55:23,069 --> 01:55:23,079
down they they maybe looked at Syria
 

4843
01:55:23,079 --> 01:55:26,910
down they they maybe looked at Syria
they looked at chich and were explaining

4844
01:55:26,910 --> 01:55:26,920
they looked at chich and were explaining
 

4845
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:28,350
they looked at chich and were explaining
that through the fact that there was

4846
01:55:28,350 --> 01:55:28,360
that through the fact that there was
 

4847
01:55:28,360 --> 01:55:31,669
that through the fact that there was
basically such a big cultural Gap and

4848
01:55:31,669 --> 01:55:31,679
basically such a big cultural Gap and
 

4849
01:55:31,679 --> 01:55:34,069
basically such a big cultural Gap and
difference between Russians and and and

4850
01:55:34,069 --> 01:55:34,079
difference between Russians and and and
 

4851
01:55:34,079 --> 01:55:36,950
difference between Russians and and and
those those countries and those Nations

4852
01:55:36,950 --> 01:55:36,960
those those countries and those Nations
 

4853
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:40,550
those those countries and those Nations
but I I I I my understanding at least

4854
01:55:40,550 --> 01:55:40,560
but I I I I my understanding at least
 

4855
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:43,750
but I I I I my understanding at least
most of them had difficulty Imagining

4856
01:55:43,750 --> 01:55:43,760
most of them had difficulty Imagining
 

4857
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:45,750
most of them had difficulty Imagining
the war of that proportion and that that

4858
01:55:45,750 --> 01:55:45,760
the war of that proportion and that that
 

4859
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:48,709
the war of that proportion and that that
sort of ferocity and that sort of war

4860
01:55:48,709 --> 01:55:48,719
sort of ferocity and that sort of war
 

4861
01:55:48,719 --> 01:55:52,830
sort of ferocity and that sort of war
crimes the the the bringing that sort of

4862
01:55:52,830 --> 01:55:52,840
crimes the the the bringing that sort of
 

4863
01:55:52,840 --> 01:55:55,709
crimes the the the bringing that sort of
war crimes and on that level so it's

4864
01:55:55,709 --> 01:55:55,719
war crimes and on that level so it's
 

4865
01:55:55,719 --> 01:55:58,430
war crimes and on that level so it's
interesting that you say that in the DNA

4866
01:55:58,430 --> 01:55:58,440
interesting that you say that in the DNA
 

4867
01:55:58,440 --> 01:56:01,270
interesting that you say that in the DNA
of Ukraine versus Russia

4868
01:56:01,270 --> 01:56:01,280
of Ukraine versus Russia
 

4869
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:03,870
of Ukraine versus Russia
so maybe Russia is

4870
01:56:03,870 --> 01:56:03,880
so maybe Russia is
 

4871
01:56:03,880 --> 01:56:08,030
so maybe Russia is
more conducive to authoritarian

4872
01:56:08,030 --> 01:56:08,040
more conducive to authoritarian
 

4873
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:12,430
more conducive to authoritarian
regimes and Ukraine is more conducive to

4874
01:56:12,430 --> 01:56:12,440
regimes and Ukraine is more conducive to
 

4875
01:56:12,440 --> 01:56:14,910
regimes and Ukraine is more conducive to
defining Itself by rebelling against

4876
01:56:14,910 --> 01:56:14,920
defining Itself by rebelling against
 

4877
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:16,550
defining Itself by rebelling against
authoritarian

4878
01:56:16,550 --> 01:56:16,560
authoritarian
 

4879
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:20,030
authoritarian
regimes uh by Rebellion absolutely

4880
01:56:20,030 --> 01:56:20,040
regimes uh by Rebellion absolutely
 

4881
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:22,430
regimes uh by Rebellion absolutely
and that was the story pretty much

4882
01:56:22,430 --> 01:56:22,440
and that was the story pretty much
 

4883
01:56:22,440 --> 01:56:26,629
and that was the story pretty much
before 1991 so what you see since 1991

4884
01:56:26,629 --> 01:56:26,639
before 1991 so what you see since 1991
 

4885
01:56:26,639 --> 01:56:30,669
before 1991 so what you see since 1991
and what you see today is a I would say

4886
01:56:30,669 --> 01:56:30,679
and what you see today is a I would say
 

4887
01:56:30,679 --> 01:56:33,069
and what you see today is a I would say
new Factor certainly in Ukrainian modern

4888
01:56:33,069 --> 01:56:33,079
new Factor certainly in Ukrainian modern
 

4889
01:56:33,079 --> 01:56:35,830
new Factor certainly in Ukrainian modern
history because ukrainians traditionally

4890
01:56:35,830 --> 01:56:35,840
history because ukrainians traditionally
 

4891
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:38,950
history because ukrainians traditionally
were very successful Rebels the largest

4892
01:56:38,950 --> 01:56:38,960
were very successful Rebels the largest
 

4893
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:41,950
were very successful Rebels the largest

aggression were trying to to convey to
Vladimir Putin what uh he wanted there

5032
02:00:21,310 --> 02:00:21,320
Vladimir Putin what uh he wanted there
 

5033
02:00:21,320 --> 02:00:25,310
Vladimir Putin what uh he wanted there
was an ultimatum that really was uh

5034
02:00:25,310 --> 02:00:25,320
was an ultimatum that really was uh
 

5035
02:00:25,320 --> 02:00:28,229
was an ultimatum that really was uh
there to um not to start negotiations

5036
02:00:28,229 --> 02:00:28,239
there to um not to start negotiations
 

5037
02:00:28,239 --> 02:00:30,109
there to um not to start negotiations
but really to stop negotiations he

5038
02:00:30,109 --> 02:00:30,119
but really to stop negotiations he
 

5039
02:00:30,119 --> 02:00:33,030
but really to stop negotiations he
demanded the withdrawal of NATO to the

5040
02:00:33,030 --> 02:00:33,040
demanded the withdrawal of NATO to the
 

5041
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:36,470
demanded the withdrawal of NATO to the
borders of the 1997 if I if I'm not

5042
02:00:36,470 --> 02:00:36,480
borders of the 1997 if I if I'm not
 

5043
02:00:36,480 --> 02:00:39,149
borders of the 1997 if I if I'm not
mistaken so completely something that

5044
02:00:39,149 --> 02:00:39,159
mistaken so completely something that
 

5045
02:00:39,159 --> 02:00:41,310
mistaken so completely something that
neither leaders would accept nor the

5046
02:00:41,310 --> 02:00:41,320
neither leaders would accept nor the
 

5047
02:00:41,320 --> 02:00:43,870
neither leaders would accept nor the
countries members of NATO would accept

5048
02:00:43,870 --> 02:00:43,880
countries members of NATO would accept
 

5049
02:00:43,880 --> 02:00:46,629
countries members of NATO would accept
but for me it's very clear that that was

5050
02:00:46,629 --> 02:00:46,639
but for me it's very clear that that was
 

5051
02:00:46,639 --> 02:00:49,790
but for me it's very clear that that was
that that was an excuse that that was a

5052
02:00:49,790 --> 02:00:49,800
that that was an excuse that that was a
 

5053
02:00:49,800 --> 02:00:53,189
that that was an excuse that that was a
justification and what happened uh later

5054
02:00:53,189 --> 02:00:53,199
justification and what happened uh later
 

5055
02:00:53,199 --> 02:00:55,950
justification and what happened uh later
in the year 2022 and 2023 certainly

5056
02:00:55,950 --> 02:00:55,960
in the year 2022 and 2023 certainly
 

5057
02:00:55,960 --> 02:00:59,310
in the year 2022 and 2023 certainly
confirms me in that in that

5058
02:00:59,310 --> 02:00:59,320
confirms me in that in that
 

5059
02:00:59,320 --> 02:01:04,189
confirms me in that in that
belief uh Finland joined NATO and Sweden

5060
02:01:04,189 --> 02:01:04,199
belief uh Finland joined NATO and Sweden
 

5061
02:01:04,199 --> 02:01:08,629
belief uh Finland joined NATO and Sweden
is on the way to join in NATO so uh

5062
02:01:08,629 --> 02:01:08,639
is on the way to join in NATO so uh
 

5063
02:01:08,639 --> 02:01:12,589
is on the way to join in NATO so uh
Finland joining NATO increased uh border

5064
02:01:12,589 --> 02:01:12,599
Finland joining NATO increased uh border
 

5065
02:01:12,599 --> 02:01:15,990
Finland joining NATO increased uh border
between Russia and NATO toold and

5066
02:01:15,990 --> 02:01:16,000
between Russia and NATO toold and
 

5067
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:19,350
between Russia and NATO toold and
probably more than that so if NATO is

5068
02:01:19,350 --> 02:01:19,360
probably more than that so if NATO is
 

5069
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:20,790
probably more than that so if NATO is
the real

5070
02:01:20,790 --> 02:01:20,800
the real
 

5071
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:23,390
the real
concern it would be probably not

5072
02:01:23,390 --> 02:01:23,400
concern it would be probably not
 

5073
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:26,390
concern it would be probably not
completely unreasonable to expect that

5074
02:01:26,390 --> 02:01:26,400
completely unreasonable to expect that
 

5075
02:01:26,400 --> 02:01:29,310
completely unreasonable to expect that
if not every single soldier but at least

5076
02:01:29,310 --> 02:01:29,320
if not every single soldier but at least
 

5077
02:01:29,320 --> 02:01:31,430
if not every single soldier but at least
half of the Russian army fighting in

half of the Russian army fighting in
 

5079
02:01:31,440 --> 02:01:35,350
half of the Russian army fighting in
Ukraine would be moved to protect the

02:01:35,350 --> 02:01:35,360
Ukraine would be moved to protect the
 

5081
02:01:35,360 --> 02:01:39,390
Ukraine would be moved to protect the

War and uh we know know that that the

the uh Korean war ended in

this division division of Korea but the
 

5701
02:16:56,080 --> 02:16:58,830
this division division of Korea but the
negotiations were going on for more than

5702
02:16:58,830 --> 02:16:58,840
negotiations were going on for more than
 

5703
02:16:58,840 --> 02:17:01,349
negotiations were going on for more than
two years while those negotiations were

5704
02:17:01,349 --> 02:17:01,359
two years while those negotiations were
 

5705
02:17:01,359 --> 02:17:03,230
two years while those negotiations were
going on both sides were trying to

5706
02:17:03,230 --> 02:17:03,240
going on both sides were trying to
 

5707
02:17:03,240 --> 02:17:06,950
going on both sides were trying to
improve their position there and until

5708
02:17:06,950 --> 02:17:06,960
improve their position there and until
 

5709
02:17:06,960 --> 02:17:09,709
improve their position there and until
there was a political change death of

5710
02:17:09,709 --> 02:17:09,719
there was a political change death of
 

5711
02:17:09,719 --> 02:17:13,549
there was a political change death of
Stalin arrival of Asen in the United

5712
02:17:13,549 --> 02:17:13,559
Stalin arrival of Asen in the United
 

5713
02:17:13,559 --> 02:17:17,190
Stalin arrival of Asen in the United
States and the realization that the the

5714
02:17:17,190 --> 02:17:17,200
States and the realization that the the
 

5715
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:19,150
States and the realization that the the
chance of succeeding on the

5716
02:17:19,150 --> 02:17:19,160
chance of succeeding on the
 

5717
02:17:19,160 --> 02:17:22,509
chance of succeeding on the
battlefield uh huge the peace talks

5718
02:17:22,509 --> 02:17:22,519
battlefield uh huge the peace talks
 

5719
02:17:22,519 --> 02:17:24,429
battlefield uh huge the peace talks
didn't come

5720
02:17:24,429 --> 02:17:24,439
didn't come
 

5721
02:17:24,439 --> 02:17:27,709
didn't come
so at this point all three scenarios are

5722
02:17:27,709 --> 02:17:27,719
so at this point all three scenarios are
 

5723
02:17:27,719 --> 02:17:30,549
so at this point all three scenarios are
possible I don't I don't really discount

5724
02:17:30,549 --> 02:17:30,559
possible I don't I don't really discount
 

5725
02:17:30,559 --> 02:17:33,950
possible I don't I don't really discount
any of them it's early early to to say

5726
02:17:33,950 --> 02:17:33,960
any of them it's early early to to say
 

5727
02:17:33,960 --> 02:17:35,349
any of them it's early early to to say
what will happen so without any

5728
02:17:35,349 --> 02:17:35,359
what will happen so without any
 

5729
02:17:35,359 --> 02:17:38,070
what will happen so without any
political change let's try to

5730
02:17:38,070 --> 02:17:38,080
political change let's try to
 

5731
02:17:38,080 --> 02:17:40,309
political change let's try to
imagine what are the possibilities that

5732
02:17:40,309 --> 02:17:40,319
imagine what are the possibilities that
 

5733
02:17:40,319 --> 02:17:42,950
imagine what are the possibilities that
the war ends this

5734
02:17:42,950 --> 02:17:42,960
the war ends this
 

5735
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:46,589
the war ends this
year is it possible that it can end with

5736
02:17:46,589 --> 02:17:46,599
year is it possible that it can end with
 

5737
02:17:46,599 --> 02:17:48,990
year is it possible that it can end with
compromise basically at the place it

5738
02:17:48,990 --> 02:17:49,000
compromise basically at the place it
 

5739
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,750
compromise basically at the place it
started meaning back to the borders of

5740
02:17:51,750 --> 02:17:51,760
started meaning back to the borders of
 

5741
02:17:51,760 --> 02:17:55,549
started meaning back to the borders of
2022 yeah back to the borders of 22 with

5742
02:17:55,549 --> 02:17:55,559
2022 yeah back to the borders of 22 with
 

5743
02:17:55,559 --> 02:17:58,309
2022 yeah back to the borders of 22 with
some security guarantees that aren't

5744
02:17:58,309 --> 02:17:58,319
some security guarantees that aren't
 

5745
02:17:58,319 --> 02:18:00,990
some security guarantees that aren't
really guarantees but are hopeful

5746
02:18:00,990 --> 02:18:01,000
really guarantees but are hopeful
 

5747
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,990
really guarantees but are hopeful
guarantees no it's it's is it is not

5748
02:18:03,990 --> 02:18:04,000
guarantees no it's it's is it is not
 

5749
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:05,870
guarantees no it's it's is it is not
just virtual impossibility it is

5750
02:18:05,870 --> 02:18:05,880
just virtual impossibility it is
 

5751
02:18:05,880 --> 02:18:07,950
just virtual impossibility it is
impossible without political change in

5752
02:18:07,950 --> 02:18:07,960
impossible without political change in
 

5753
02:18:07,960 --> 02:18:12,230
impossible without political change in
Moscow the reason is that back in the

02:18:28,910 --> 02:18:28,920
Constitution which basically in simple
 

5767
02:18:28,920 --> 02:18:31,389
Constitution which basically in simple
language is that the hands are tied up

5768

02:19:00,389 --> 02:19:00,399
Russia what what that really meant in
 

5791
02:19:00,399 --> 02:19:02,509
Russia what what that really meant in
plain language is that basically we are

5792
02:19:02,509 --> 02:19:02,519
plain language is that basically we are
 

5793
02:19:02,519 --> 02:19:04,910

agreement with five of our o

5796
02:19:08,070 --> 02:19:08,080
agreement with five of our o
 

5797
02:19:08,080 --> 02:19:10,429
agreement with five of our o
blists not just Ann nexted but also

5798
02:19:10,429 --> 02:19:10,439
blists not just Ann nexted but also
 

5799
02:19:10,439 --> 02:19:12,750
blists not just Ann nexted but also
included into the Russian Constitution

included into the Russian Constitution
 

5801
02:19:12,760 --> 02:19:16,429
included into the Russian Constitution
so that's where we are so the that that

5802
02:19:16,429 --> 02:19:16,439
so that's where we are so the that that
 

5803
02:19:16,439 --> 02:19:19,750
so that's where we are so the that that
scenario is is uh again everything is

5804
02:19:19,750 --> 02:19:19,760
scenario is is uh again everything is
 

5805
02:19:19,760 --> 02:19:21,910
scenario is is uh again everything is
possible of course but it's highly

5806
02:19:21,910 --> 02:19:21,920
possible of course but it's highly
 

5807
02:19:21,920 --> 02:19:23,469
possible of course but it's highly
highly unlikely so the Russian

5808
02:19:23,469 --> 02:19:23,479
highly unlikely so the Russian
 

5809
02:19:23,479 --> 02:19:25,629
highly unlikely so the Russian
Constitution is a is a thing that's very

5810
02:19:25,629 --> 02:19:25,639
Constitution is a is a thing that's very
 

5811
02:19:25,639 --> 02:19:28,070
Constitution is a is a thing that's very
that makes this all very difficult yes

5812
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:28,080
that makes this all very difficult yes
 

5813
02:19:28,080 --> 02:19:31,150
that makes this all very difficult yes
and not only as a negotiation tactic for

5814
02:19:31,150 --> 02:19:31,160
and not only as a negotiation tactic for
 

5815
02:19:31,160 --> 02:19:33,509
and not only as a negotiation tactic for
Putin whoever would would negotiate on

5816
02:19:33,509 --> 02:19:33,519
Putin whoever would would negotiate on
 

5817
02:19:33,519 --> 02:19:36,549
Putin whoever would would negotiate on
the Russian side but also as as a legal

5818
02:19:36,549 --> 02:19:36,559
the Russian side but also as as a legal
 

5819
02:19:36,559 --> 02:19:39,230
the Russian side but also as as a legal
issue so like the Practical aspect of it

5820
02:19:39,230 --> 02:19:39,240
issue so like the Practical aspect of it
 

5821
02:19:39,240 --> 02:19:42,990
issue so like the Practical aspect of it
even is yes you really have to uh change

5822
02:19:42,990 --> 02:19:43,000
even is yes you really have to uh change
 

5823
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,349
even is yes you really have to uh change
the Constitution before the peace

5824
02:19:45,349 --> 02:19:45,359
the Constitution before the peace
 

5825
02:19:45,359 --> 02:19:47,750
the Constitution before the peace
agreement takes hold or immediate medely

5826
02:19:47,750 --> 02:19:47,760
agreement takes hold or immediate medely
 

5827
02:19:47,760 --> 02:19:50,950
agreement takes hold or immediate medely
after that and with the Minsk agreements

5828
02:19:50,950 --> 02:19:50,960
after that and with the Minsk agreements
 

5829
02:19:50,960 --> 02:19:53,550
after that and with the Minsk agreements
that was one of things that uh Russia

5830
02:19:53,550 --> 02:19:53,560
that was one of things that uh Russia
 

5831
02:19:53,560 --> 02:19:55,150
that was one of things that uh Russia
wanted from Ukraine change of the

5832
02:19:55,150 --> 02:19:55,160
wanted from Ukraine change of the
 

5833
02:19:55,160 --> 02:19:57,469
wanted from Ukraine change of the
Constitution and it turned out to be

5834
02:19:57,469 --> 02:19:57,479
Constitution and it turned out to be
 

5835
02:19:57,479 --> 02:19:59,950
Constitution and it turned out to be
really impossible so that that's one of

5836
02:19:59,950 --> 02:19:59,960
really impossible so that that's one of
 

5837
02:19:59,960 --> 02:20:02,870
really impossible so that that's one of
the one of the Back stories of of the

5838
02:20:02,870 --> 02:20:02,880
the one of the Back stories of of the
 

5839
02:20:02,880 --> 02:20:04,750
the one of the Back stories of of the
Minsk and and collapse of the Minsk

5840
02:20:04,750 --> 02:20:04,760
Minsk and and collapse of the Minsk
 

5841
02:20:04,760 --> 02:20:07,030
Minsk and and collapse of the Minsk
agreements is there something like M

5842
02:20:07,030 --> 02:20:07,040
agreements is there something like M
 

5843
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:08,990
agreements is there something like M
Minsk agreements that are possible now

5844
02:20:08,990 --> 02:20:09,000
Minsk agreements that are possible now
 

5845
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,750
Minsk agreements that are possible now
to maybe this is a legal question but to

5846
02:20:11,750 --> 02:20:11,760
to maybe this is a legal question but to
 

5847
02:20:11,760 --> 02:20:14,389
to maybe this is a legal question but to
override the Constitution to sort of

5848
02:20:14,389 --> 02:20:14,399
override the Constitution to sort of
 

5849
02:20:14,399 --> 02:20:17,630
override the Constitution to sort of
shake everything up so see the

5850
02:20:17,630 --> 02:20:17,640
shake everything up so see the
 

5851
02:20:17,640 --> 02:20:20,070
shake everything up so see the
Constitutional Amendment as a uh as just

5852
02:20:20,070 --> 02:20:20,080
Constitutional Amendment as a uh as just
 

5853
02:20:20,080 --> 02:20:22,670
Constitutional Amendment as a uh as just
a negotiation tactic to to come to the

5854
02:20:22,670 --> 02:20:22,680
a negotiation tactic to to come to the
 

5855
02:20:22,680 --> 02:20:24,550
a negotiation tactic to to come to the
table to something like M Minsk

5856
02:20:24,550 --> 02:20:24,560
table to something like M Minsk
 

5857
02:20:24,560 --> 02:20:28,429
table to something like M Minsk
agreement given uh how how fast those

5858
02:20:28,429 --> 02:20:28,439
agreement given uh how how fast those
 

5859
02:20:28,439 --> 02:20:30,429
agreement given uh how how fast those
those amendments to the Constitution

5860
02:20:30,429 --> 02:20:30,439
those amendments to the Constitution
 

5861
02:20:30,439 --> 02:20:31,790
those amendments to the Constitution
were

5862
02:20:31,790 --> 02:20:31,800
were
 

5863
02:20:31,800 --> 02:20:34,990
were
adopted uh that suggests that really

5864
02:20:34,990 --> 02:20:35,000
adopted uh that suggests that really
 

5865
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,510
adopted uh that suggests that really
executive power in in Russia has

5866
02:20:37,510 --> 02:20:37,520
executive power in in Russia has
 

5867
02:20:37,520 --> 02:20:40,550
executive power in in Russia has
enormous power over the the legislative

5868
02:20:40,550 --> 02:20:40,560
enormous power over the the legislative
 

5869
02:20:40,560 --> 02:20:43,309
enormous power over the the legislative
branch so it's it's Again difficult to

5870
02:20:43,309 --> 02:20:43,319
branch so it's it's Again difficult to
 

5871
02:20:43,319 --> 02:20:45,590
branch so it's it's Again difficult to
imagine but technically this is possible

5872
02:20:45,590 --> 02:20:45,600
imagine but technically this is possible
 

5873
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:48,190
imagine but technically this is possible
again if if the but but possible if

5874
02:20:48,190 --> 02:20:48,200
again if if the but but possible if
 

5875
02:20:48,200 --> 02:20:50,590
again if if the but but possible if
there is a political change in Moscow I

5876
02:20:50,590 --> 02:20:50,600
there is a political change in Moscow I
 

5877
02:20:50,600 --> 02:20:52,750
there is a political change in Moscow I
don't understand why assuming political

5878
02:20:52,750 --> 02:20:52,760
don't understand why assuming political
 

5879
02:20:52,760 --> 02:20:54,710
don't understand why assuming political
change in Moscow is not possible this

5880
02:20:54,710 --> 02:20:54,720
change in Moscow is not possible this
 

5881
02:20:54,720 --> 02:20:57,389
change in Moscow is not possible this
year so I'm trying to see if there's a

5882
02:20:57,389 --> 02:20:57,399
year so I'm trying to see if there's a
 

5883
02:20:57,399 --> 02:20:59,750
year so I'm trying to see if there's a
way to end this war this year right

5884
02:20:59,750 --> 02:20:59,760
way to end this war this year right
 

5885
02:20:59,760 --> 02:21:02,469
way to end this war this year right
there is a possibility of armistice

5886
02:21:02,469 --> 02:21:02,479
there is a possibility of armistice
 

5887
02:21:02,479 --> 02:21:06,230
there is a possibility of armistice
right but Armistice more along the like

5888
02:21:06,230 --> 02:21:06,240
right but Armistice more along the like
 

5889
02:21:06,240 --> 02:21:08,990
right but Armistice more along the like
any Armistice along the lines of the

5890
02:21:08,990 --> 02:21:09,000
any Armistice along the lines of the
 

5891
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:10,190
any Armistice along the lines of the
current front

02:21:10,190 --> 02:21:10,200
current front
 

5893
02:21:10,200 --> 02:21:13,389
current front
lines but withdrawal of the Russian

5894
02:21:13,389 --> 02:21:13,399
lines but withdrawal of the Russian
 

5895
02:21:13,399 --> 02:21:16,230
lines but withdrawal of the Russian
troops to the borders of 2022 at this

5896
02:21:16,230 --> 02:21:16,240
troops to the borders of 2022 at this
 

5897
02:21:16,240 --> 02:21:18,270
troops to the borders of 2022 at this
point whether it's reasonable or

5898
02:21:18,270 --> 02:21:18,280
point whether it's reasonable or
 

5899
02:21:18,280 --> 02:21:20,670
point whether it's reasonable or
unreasonable can be achieved all only as

5900
02:21:20,670 --> 02:21:20,680
unreasonable can be achieved all only as
 

5901
02:21:20,680 --> 02:21:23,110
unreasonable can be achieved all only as
the result of the defeat of the Russian

5902
02:21:23,110 --> 02:21:23,120
the result of the defeat of the Russian
 

5903
02:21:23,120 --> 02:21:25,590
the result of the defeat of the Russian
army like it happened near cave is it

5904
02:21:25,590 --> 02:21:25,600
army like it happened near cave is it
 

5905
02:21:25,600 --> 02:21:27,230
army like it happened near cave is it
possible possible is

5906
02:21:27,230 --> 02:21:27,240
possible possible is
 

5907
02:21:27,240 --> 02:21:30,070
possible possible is
it likely especially given what is

5908
02:21:30,070 --> 02:21:30,080
it likely especially given what is
 

5909
02:21:30,080 --> 02:21:32,150
it likely especially given what is
happening with the Western support

5910
02:21:32,150 --> 02:21:32,160
happening with the Western support
 

5911
02:21:32,160 --> 02:21:35,429
happening with the Western support
military support for for for Ukraine

5912
02:21:35,429 --> 02:21:35,439
military support for for for Ukraine
 

5913
02:21:35,439 --> 02:21:38,510
military support for for for Ukraine
probably not but if Putin the executive

02:21:38,510 --> 02:21:38,520
probably not but if Putin the executive
 

5915
02:21:38,520 --> 02:21:42,030
probably not but if Putin the executive
branch has a lot of power why can't the

5916
02:21:42,030 --> 02:21:42,040
branch has a lot of power why can't the
 

5917
02:21:42,040 --> 02:21:44,150
branch has a lot of power why can't the
United States President the Russian

5918
02:21:44,150 --> 02:21:44,160
United States President the Russian
 

5919

president the Ukrainian president come
to the table and draw up something like

5922
02:21:48,590 --> 02:21:48,600
to the table and draw up something like
 

5923
02:21:48,600 --> 02:21:51,590
to the table and draw up something like
the M Minsk agreements where and then

5924
02:21:51,590 --> 02:21:51,600
the M Minsk agreements where and then
 

5925
02:21:51,600 --> 02:21:54,270
the M Minsk agreements where and then
rapid constitutional change is made and

5926
02:21:54,270 --> 02:21:54,280
rapid constitutional change is made and
 

5927
02:21:54,280 --> 02:21:56,790
rapid constitutional change is made and
you go back to the borders in 2022

5928
02:21:56,790 --> 02:21:56,800
you go back to the borders in 2022
 

5929
02:21:56,800 --> 02:22:00,830
you go back to the borders in 2022
before 2022 like through agreements

5930
02:22:00,830 --> 02:22:00,840
before 2022 like through agreements
 

5931
02:22:00,840 --> 02:22:03,510
before 2022 like through agreements
through compromise impossible for you

through compromise impossible for you
 

5933
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:06,389
through compromise impossible for you
certainly not this year I look at this

5934
02:22:06,389 --> 02:22:06,399
certainly not this year I look at this
 

5935
02:22:06,399 --> 02:22:09,870
certainly not this year I look at this
year as the time when at least one side

5936
02:22:09,870 --> 02:22:09,880
year as the time when at least one side
 

5937
02:22:09,880 --> 02:22:13,469

5941
02:22:16,280 --> 02:22:18,389
it can through the through military
means but that's been happening last

5942
02:22:18,389 --> 02:22:18,399
means but that's been happening last
 

5943
02:22:18,399 --> 02:22:20,429
means but that's been happening last
year too there's been a counter

tactics uh that the the last year was uh
 

5955
02:22:33,960 --> 02:22:37,110
tactics uh that the the last year was uh
pretty much a lot of fighting a lot of

pretty much a lot of fighting a lot of

suffering very little movement of the of
 

5959
02:22:40,479 --> 02:22:43,550
suffering very little movement of the of
the front line the biggest change of the

5960
02:22:43,550 --> 02:22:43,560
the front line the biggest change of the
 

5961
02:22:43,560 --> 02:22:46,190
the front line the biggest change of the

02:22:50,550 --> 02:22:50,560
the Black Sea where they pushed the the
 

5965
02:22:50,560 --> 02:22:53,510
the Black Sea where they pushed the the
Russian Navy into the western part of

5966
02:22:53,510 --> 02:22:53,520
Russian Navy into the western part of
 

5967
02:22:53,520 --> 02:22:55,590
Russian Navy into the western part of
the pond

5968
02:22:55,590 --> 02:22:55,600
the pond
 

5969
02:22:55,600 --> 02:23:00,870
the pond
and restored the the grain Corridor and

5970
02:23:00,870 --> 02:23:00,880
and restored the the grain Corridor and
 

5971
02:23:00,880 --> 02:23:04,349
and restored the the grain Corridor and
export from Odessa apparently up to 75%

5972
02:23:04,349 --> 02:23:04,359
export from Odessa apparently up to 75%
 

5973
02:23:04,359 --> 02:23:06,270
export from Odessa apparently up to 75%
of what it used to be before the war so

5974
02:23:06,270 --> 02:23:06,280
of what it used to be before the war so
 

5975
02:23:06,280 --> 02:23:10,389
of what it used to be before the war so
that's that's the the only major change

5976
02:23:10,389 --> 02:23:10,399
that's that's the the only major change
 

5977
02:23:10,399 --> 02:23:13,349
that's that's the the only major change
but again the the price is enormous in

5978
02:23:13,349 --> 02:23:13,359
but again the the price is enormous in
 

5979
02:23:13,359 --> 02:23:16,510
but again the the price is enormous in
terms of wealth in terms of especially

so thinking about what 2024 brings
zalinski just fired Ukraine's head of

5986
02:23:24,110 --> 02:23:24,120
zalinski just fired Ukraine's head of
 

5987
02:23:24,120 --> 02:23:24,830
zalinski just fired Ukraine's head of
the

5988
02:23:24,830 --> 02:23:24,840
the
 

5989
02:23:24,840 --> 02:23:27,469
the
army a man you've mentioned General

5990
02:23:27,469 --> 02:23:27,479
army a man you've mentioned General
 

5991
02:23:27,479 --> 02:23:31,150
army a man you've mentioned General
valer uh zi what do you make of this

5992
02:23:31,150 --> 02:23:31,160
valer uh zi what do you make of this
 

5993
02:23:31,160 --> 02:23:34,030
valer uh zi what do you make of this
development this is a very very

5994
02:23:34,030 --> 02:23:34,040
development this is a very very
 

5995
02:23:34,040 --> 02:23:35,309
development this is a very very
dangerous

5996
02:23:35,309 --> 02:23:35,319
dangerous
 

5997
02:23:35,319 --> 02:23:37,349
dangerous
moment in in the

5998
02:23:37,349 --> 02:23:37,359
moment in in the
 

5999
02:23:37,359 --> 02:23:42,269
moment in in the
War uh the reason for that is that Z is

6000
02:23:42,269 --> 02:23:42,279
War uh the reason for that is that Z is
 

6001
02:23:42,279 --> 02:23:44,750
War uh the reason for that is that Z is
someone who is very popular with the

6002
02:23:44,750 --> 02:23:44,760
someone who is very popular with the
 

6003
02:23:44,760 --> 02:23:47,990
someone who is very popular with the
Army and with people in general

02:23:47,990 --> 02:23:48,000
Army and with people in general
 

6005
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:51,110
Army and with people in general
so if you look at that through American

6006
02:23:51,110 --> 02:23:51,120
so if you look at that through American
 

6007
02:23:51,120 --> 02:23:54,910
so if you look at that through American
prism that would be something analogous

6008
02:23:54,910 --> 02:23:54,920
prism that would be something analogous
 

6009
02:23:54,920 --> 02:23:57,190
prism that would be something analogous
to President

that Stakes for us at that time were
 

6017
02:24:06,399 --> 02:24:08,590
that Stakes for us at that time were
very high but probably not as high as

6018
02:24:08,590 --> 02:24:08,600
very high but probably not as high as

they are for Ukraine for Ukraine
today in both cases what is at stake is

6022
02:24:15,110 --> 02:24:15,120
today in both cases what is at stake is
 

6023
02:24:15,120 --> 02:24:18,590
today in both cases what is at stake is
certainly the idea that the political

6024
02:24:18,590 --> 02:24:18,600
certainly the idea that the political
 

6025
02:24:18,600 --> 02:24:20,429
certainly the idea that the political
leadership and Military leadership have

6026

to be on the same page and uh the
 

6029
02:24:23,600 --> 02:24:27,070
to be on the same page and uh the
question is whether on the part of

6030
02:24:27,070 --> 02:24:27,080
question is whether on the part of
 

6031
02:24:27,080 --> 02:24:30,389
question is whether on the part of
zalinski this is just the change of the

taking more active part in planning

the Democratic
 

6269
02:30:10,600 --> 02:30:13,870
the Democratic
mindset towards an authoritarian one I

6270
02:30:13,870 --> 02:30:13,880
mindset towards an authoritarian one I
 

6271
02:30:13,880 --> 02:30:16,309
mindset towards an authoritarian one I
think that there is a possibility of

6272
02:30:16,309 --> 02:30:16,319
think that there is a possibility of
 

6273
02:30:16,319 --> 02:30:20,150
think that there is a possibility of
that right you in the conditions of

6274
02:30:20,150 --> 02:30:20,160
that right you in the conditions of
 

6275
02:30:20,160 --> 02:30:21,990
that right you in the conditions of
any any

6276
02:30:21,990 --> 02:30:22,000
any any
 

6277
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,630
any any
emergency war in in the case of the

6278
02:30:24,630 --> 02:30:24,640
emergency war in in the case of the
 

6279
02:30:24,640 --> 02:30:26,910
emergency war in in the case of the
Soviet Union there was a Chernobyl

6280
02:30:26,910 --> 02:30:26,920
Soviet Union there was a Chernobyl
 

6281
02:30:26,920 --> 02:30:30,389
Soviet Union there was a Chernobyl
disaster and so on and so forth you make

6282
02:30:30,389 --> 02:30:30,399
disaster and so on and so forth you make
 

6283
02:30:30,399 --> 02:30:32,150
disaster and so on and so forth you make
decisions much

6284
02:30:32,150 --> 02:30:32,160
decisions much
 

6285
02:30:32,160 --> 02:30:35,590
decisions much
faster you you you create this vertical

6286
02:30:35,590 --> 02:30:35,600
faster you you you create this vertical
 

6287
02:30:35,600 --> 02:30:38,830
faster you you you create this vertical
and um then it's it's very easier to get

6288
02:30:38,830 --> 02:30:38,840
and um then it's it's very easier to get
 

6289
02:30:38,840 --> 02:30:43,349
and um then it's it's very easier to get
to get really used to that way dealing

6290
02:30:43,349 --> 02:30:43,359
to get really used to that way dealing
 

6291
02:30:43,359 --> 02:30:45,469
to get really used to that way dealing
with the issues in in the conditions of

6292
02:30:45,469 --> 02:30:45,479
with the issues in in the conditions of
 

6293
02:30:45,479 --> 02:30:47,550
with the issues in in the conditions of
emergency right and and then either

6294
02:30:47,550 --> 02:30:47,560
emergency right and and then either
 

6295
02:30:47,560 --> 02:30:49,030
emergency right and and then either
continue

6296
02:30:49,030 --> 02:30:49,040
continue
 

6297
02:30:49,040 --> 02:30:53,269
continue
emergency or or with no emergency they

6298
02:30:53,269 --> 02:30:53,279
emergency or or with no emergency they
 

6299
02:30:53,279 --> 02:30:56,630
emergency or or with no emergency they
continuing the emergency mode I I think

6300
02:30:56,630 --> 02:30:56,640
continuing the emergency mode I I think
 

6301
02:30:56,640 --> 02:31:00,790
continuing the emergency mode I I think
um again that that would be a very very

6302
02:31:00,790 --> 02:31:00,800
um again that that would be a very very
 

6303
02:31:00,800 --> 02:31:03,510
um again that that would be a very very
natural thing for any human being to to

6304
02:31:03,510 --> 02:31:03,520
natural thing for any human being to to
 

6305
02:31:03,520 --> 02:31:05,190
natural thing for any human being to to
do to make it

6306
02:31:05,190 --> 02:31:05,200
do to make it
 

6307
02:31:05,200 --> 02:31:08,830
do to make it
easier should I do that easier and in

6308
02:31:08,830 --> 02:31:08,840
easier should I do that easier and in
 

6309
02:31:08,840 --> 02:31:10,710
easier should I do that easier and in
more effective way or should I do the

6310
02:31:10,710 --> 02:31:10,720
more effective way or should I do the
 

6311
02:31:10,720 --> 02:31:13,870
more effective way or should I do the
right way that's that's a challenge it's

6312
02:31:13,870 --> 02:31:13,880
right way that's that's a challenge it's
 

6313
02:31:13,880 --> 02:31:16,190
right way that's that's a challenge it's
it's it's it's it's sometimes it's

6314
02:31:16,190 --> 02:31:16,200
it's it's it's it's sometimes it's
 

6315
02:31:16,200 --> 02:31:18,030
it's it's it's it's sometimes it's
difficult to answer this question let me

6316
02:31:18,030 --> 02:31:18,040
difficult to answer this question let me
 

6317
02:31:18,040 --> 02:31:19,950
difficult to answer this question let me
stay in power for just a little longer

6318
02:31:19,950 --> 02:31:19,960
stay in power for just a little longer
 

6319
02:31:19,960 --> 02:31:22,630
stay in power for just a little longer
to do it the efficient way Y and then

6320
02:31:22,630 --> 02:31:22,640
to do it the efficient way Y and then
 

6321
02:31:22,640 --> 02:31:24,550
to do it the efficient way Y and then
time flies away and all of a sudden

6322
02:31:24,550 --> 02:31:24,560
time flies away and all of a sudden
 

6323
02:31:24,560 --> 02:31:26,830
time flies away and all of a sudden
you're it's it's you're you're going for

6324
02:31:26,830 --> 02:31:26,840
you're it's it's you're you're going for
 

6325

the third term and the fourth term and

6326
02:31:29,070 --> 02:31:29,080

today as a historian I have a lot of
 

6385
02:32:47,840 --> 02:32:51,190
today as a historian I have a lot of
questions and I have questions about

6386
02:32:51,190 --> 02:32:51,200
questions and I have questions about
 

6387
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:53,389
questions and I have questions about
when when the decision was made to

6388

trying so as a historian I I have this

6396
02:33:03,030 --> 02:33:03,040
trying so as a historian I I have this
 

6397
02:33:03,040 --> 02:33:05,510
trying so as a historian I I have this
this this big question have question

6398
02:33:05,510 --> 02:33:05,520
this this big question have question
 

6399

this this big question have question
about the Crimea when those decisions

6400
02:33:07,750 --> 02:33:07,760
about the Crimea when those decisions
 

6401
02:33:07,760 --> 02:33:13,030
about the Crimea when those decisions
were made so that sort of questions that

6402
02:33:13,030 --> 02:33:13,040
were made so that sort of questions that
 

6403
02:33:13,040 --> 02:33:15,830
were made so that sort of questions that
that interest me but the rest either I

6404
02:33:15,830 --> 02:33:15,840
that interest me but the rest either I
 

6405
02:33:15,840 --> 02:33:18,349
that interest me but the rest either I
think I understand what is going on with

6406
02:33:18,349 --> 02:33:18,359
think I understand what is going on with
 

6407
02:33:18,359 --> 02:33:20,269
think I understand what is going on with
him or I don't expect the answer that

6408
02:33:20,269 --> 02:33:20,279
him or I don't expect the answer that
 

6409
02:33:20,279 --> 02:33:23,790
him or I don't expect the answer that
can help for for example a good question

6410
02:33:23,790 --> 02:33:23,800
can help for for example a good question
 

6411
02:33:23,800 --> 02:33:27,550
can help for for example a good question
whether you regret or not the start of

6412
02:33:27,550 --> 02:33:27,560
whether you regret or not the start of
 

6413
02:33:27,560 --> 02:33:31,309
whether you regret or not the start of
the war in 2022 given given the enormous

6414
02:33:31,309 --> 02:33:31,319
the war in 2022 given given the enormous
 

6415
02:33:31,319 --> 02:33:34,550
the war in 2022 given given the enormous
enormous casualties on both

6416
02:33:34,550 --> 02:33:34,560
enormous casualties on both
 

6417
02:33:34,560 --> 02:33:38,469
enormous casualties on both
sides but you can't expect from a

6418
02:33:38,469 --> 02:33:38,479
sides but you can't expect from a
 

6419
02:33:38,479 --> 02:33:40,870
sides but you can't expect from a
politician an honest answer to this

6420
02:33:40,870 --> 02:33:40,880
politician an honest answer to this
 

6421
02:33:40,880 --> 02:33:43,630
politician an honest answer to this
question right so there are questions to

6422
02:33:43,630 --> 02:33:43,640
question right so there are questions to
 

6423
02:33:43,640 --> 02:33:45,150
question right so there are questions to
which I know he

6424
02:33:45,150 --> 02:33:45,160
which I know he
 

6425
02:33:45,160 --> 02:33:47,630
which I know he
can't answer honestly and then there are

6426
02:33:47,630 --> 02:33:47,640
can't answer honestly and then there are
 

6427
02:33:47,640 --> 02:33:49,110
can't answer honestly and then there are
other questions to which I think he

6428
02:33:49,110 --> 02:33:49,120
other questions to which I think he
 

6429
02:33:49,120 --> 02:33:51,870
other questions to which I think he
already provided all answers that he

6430
02:33:51,870 --> 02:33:51,880
already provided all answers that he
 

6431
02:33:51,880 --> 02:33:56,150
already provided all answers that he
could so what what for me is is is of

6432
02:33:56,150 --> 02:33:56,160
could so what what for me is is is of
 

6433
02:33:56,160 --> 02:33:58,389
could so what what for me is is is of
Interest are basically questions for a

6434
02:33:58,389 --> 02:33:58,399
Interest are basically questions for a
 

6435
02:33:58,399 --> 02:34:01,389
Interest are basically questions for a
historian about about the the timing and

6436
02:34:01,389 --> 02:34:01,399
historian about about the the timing and
 

6437
02:34:01,399 --> 02:34:03,070
historian about about the the timing and
and the and the and the logic of

6438
02:34:03,070 --> 02:34:03,080
and the and the and the logic of
 

6439
02:34:03,080 --> 02:34:05,630
and the and the and the logic of
particular decisions well I do wonder

6440
02:34:05,630 --> 02:34:05,640
particular decisions well I do wonder
 

6441
02:34:05,640 --> 02:34:08,870
particular decisions well I do wonder
how different what he says publicly is

6442
02:34:08,870 --> 02:34:08,880
how different what he says publicly is
 

6443
02:34:08,880 --> 02:34:11,429
how different what he says publicly is
from what he thinks privately so a

6444
02:34:11,429 --> 02:34:11,439
from what he thinks privately so a
 

6445
02:34:11,439 --> 02:34:13,349
from what he thinks privately so a
question about

6446
02:34:13,349 --> 02:34:13,359
question about
 

6447
02:34:13,359 --> 02:34:16,750
question about
when the decision to invade Ukraine

6448
02:34:16,750 --> 02:34:16,760
when the decision to invade Ukraine
 

6449
02:34:16,760 --> 02:34:19,950
when the decision to invade Ukraine
happen is a very good question to give

6450
02:34:19,950 --> 02:34:19,960
happen is a very good question to give
 

6451
02:34:19,960 --> 02:34:23,030
happen is a very good question to give
insight to the difference between how he

6452
02:34:23,030 --> 02:34:23,040
insight to the difference between how he
 

6453
02:34:23,040 --> 02:34:24,910
insight to the difference between how he
thinks about the world privately versus

6454
02:34:24,910 --> 02:34:24,920
thinks about the world privately versus
 

6455
02:34:24,920 --> 02:34:26,190
thinks about the world privately versus
what he says

6456
02:34:26,190 --> 02:34:26,200
what he says
 

6457
02:34:26,200 --> 02:34:30,670
what he says
publicly yeah and same about other you

6458
02:34:30,670 --> 02:34:30,680
publicly yeah and same about other you
 

6459
02:34:30,680 --> 02:34:34,150
publicly yeah and same about other you
know about Empire is if you ask uh Putin

6460
02:34:34,150 --> 02:34:34,160
know about Empire is if you ask uh Putin
 

6461
02:34:34,160 --> 02:34:36,230
know about Empire is if you ask uh Putin
he will say he has no interest in Empire

6462
02:34:36,230 --> 02:34:36,240
he will say he has no interest in Empire
 

6463
02:34:36,240 --> 02:34:38,510
he will say he has no interest in Empire
and he finds the notion

6464
02:34:38,510 --> 02:34:38,520
and he finds the notion
 

6465
02:34:38,520 --> 02:34:41,110
and he finds the notion
silly but at the same

6466
02:34:41,110 --> 02:34:41,120
silly but at the same
 

6467
02:34:41,120 --> 02:34:43,910
silly but at the same
time perhaps privately there's a sense

6468
02:34:43,910 --> 02:34:43,920
time perhaps privately there's a sense
 

6469
02:34:43,920 --> 02:34:49,990
time perhaps privately there's a sense
in which he does uh seek the the

6470
02:34:49,990 --> 02:34:50,000
in which he does uh seek the the
 

6471
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:53,389
in which he does uh seek the the
reunification of the Russian Empire not

6472
02:34:53,389 --> 02:34:53,399
reunification of the Russian Empire not
 

6473
02:34:53,399 --> 02:34:55,150
reunification of the Russian Empire not
in the form of the Russian Empire not in

6474
02:34:55,150 --> 02:34:55,160
in the form of the Russian Empire not in
 

6475
02:34:55,160 --> 02:34:57,030
in the form of the Russian Empire not in
the form of the Soviet Union but

6476
02:34:57,030 --> 02:34:57,040
the form of the Soviet Union but
 

6477
02:34:57,040 --> 02:34:58,910
the form of the Soviet Union but
certainly in some form of the Russian

6478
02:34:58,910 --> 02:34:58,920
certainly in some form of the Russian
 

6479
02:34:58,920 --> 02:35:02,510
certainly in some form of the Russian
control that's that's uh

6480
02:35:02,510 --> 02:35:02,520
control that's that's uh
 

6481
02:35:02,520 --> 02:35:05,950
control that's that's uh
that's for me at least it's quite clear

6482
02:35:05,950 --> 02:35:05,960
that's for me at least it's quite clear
 

6483
02:35:05,960 --> 02:35:07,990
that's for me at least it's quite clear

7429
02:58:07,520 --> 02:58:09,830
safe terms a number of people died per
energy generated it's much safer than

this makes the nuclear industry not only
 

7455
02:58:39,239 --> 02:58:41,550
this makes the nuclear industry not only
risky to operate but also impossible to

than once and Fukushima came because the
 

7581
03:01:43,760 --> 03:01:46,590
than once and Fukushima came because the
s were shut down as they add zapia but

03:01:46,590 --> 03:01:46,600
s were shut down as they add zapia but
 

7583
03:01:46,600 --> 03:01:48,389
s were shut down as they add zapia but
they still needed

they still needed
 

7585
03:01:48,399 --> 03:01:51,030
they still needed
electricity to bring water and to cool

7586

electricity to bring water and to cool
 

7587
03:01:51,040 --> 03:01:54,469
electricity to bring water and to cool
them down and in Fukushima case it was

7588
03:01:54,469 --> 03:01:54,479
them down and in Fukushima case it was
 

7589
03:01:54,479 --> 03:01:56,670
them down and in Fukushima case it was
the tsunami that cut off the supply of

the area around zapia that did did the

7596
03:02:04,349 --> 03:02:04,359
the area around zapia that did did the
 

7597
03:02:04,359 --> 03:02:08,670
the area around zapia that did did the
same effect so we have 440 reactors in

7598
03:02:08,670 --> 03:02:08,680
same effect so we have 440 reactors in
 

7599
03:02:08,680 --> 03:02:10,990
same effect so we have 440 reactors in
the world today plus

7600
03:02:10,990 --> 03:02:11,000
the world today plus
 

7601
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:13,910
the world today plus

minus none of them was designed to
 

7603
03:02:13,920 --> 03:02:17,389
minus none of them was designed to
withstand the direct missile attack or

7604
03:02:17,389 --> 03:02:17,399

Warfare if operators they're human then

7608
03:02:22,550 --> 03:02:22,560
Warfare if operators they're human then
 

7609
03:02:22,560 --> 03:02:24,389
Warfare if operators they're human then
they make mistakes like they did at

7610
03:02:24,389 --> 03:02:24,399
they make mistakes like they did at
 

7611
03:02:24,399 --> 03:02:27,590
they make mistakes like they did at
Three Mile Island or Chernobyl but think

7612
03:02:27,590 --> 03:02:27,600
Three Mile Island or Chernobyl but think
 

7613
03:02:27,600 --> 03:02:30,309
Three Mile Island or Chernobyl but think
also if the war is happening around them

7614
03:02:30,309 --> 03:02:30,319
also if the war is happening around them
 

7615
03:02:30,319 --> 03:02:31,950
also if the war is happening around them
if they're not sure what is happening

7616
03:02:31,950 --> 03:02:31,960
if they're not sure what is happening
 

7617
03:02:31,960 --> 03:02:35,190
if they're not sure what is happening
with their with their families uh if

7618
03:02:35,190 --> 03:02:35,200
with their with their families uh if
 

7619
03:02:35,200 --> 03:02:37,349
with their with their families uh if
they don't know whether they will be

7620
03:02:37,349 --> 03:02:37,359
they don't know whether they will be
 

7621
03:02:37,359 --> 03:02:40,630
they don't know whether they will be
next missile whether we'll hit the uh

7622
03:02:40,630 --> 03:02:40,640
next missile whether we'll hit the uh
 

7623
03:02:40,640 --> 03:02:43,110
next missile whether we'll hit the uh
room where where they the control room

7624
03:02:43,110 --> 03:02:43,120
room where where they the control room
 

7625
03:02:43,120 --> 03:02:44,510
room where where they the control room
or not

7626
03:02:44,510 --> 03:02:44,520
or not
 

7627
03:02:44,520 --> 03:02:48,429
or not
that that multiplies also so we we are

7628
03:02:48,429 --> 03:02:48,439
that that multiplies also so we we are
 

7629
03:02:48,439 --> 03:02:52,030
that that multiplies also so we we are
in a situation where um we are not done

7630
03:02:52,030 --> 03:02:52,040
in a situation where um we are not done
 

7631
03:02:52,040 --> 03:02:55,510
in a situation where um we are not done
yet with the nuclear accidents you each

7632
03:02:55,510 --> 03:02:55,520
yet with the nuclear accidents you each
 

7633
03:02:55,520 --> 03:02:57,590
yet with the nuclear accidents you each
time it's not like we don't pay

7634
03:02:57,590 --> 03:02:57,600
time it's not like we don't pay
 

7635
03:02:57,600 --> 03:02:59,229
time it's not like we don't pay
attention or we don't

7636
03:02:59,229 --> 03:02:59,239
attention or we don't
 

7637
03:02:59,239 --> 03:03:02,110
attention or we don't
learn smart people work on that and

7638
03:03:02,110 --> 03:03:02,120
learn smart people work on that and
 

7639
03:03:02,120 --> 03:03:04,630
learn smart people work on that and
after every accident try to figure the

7640
03:03:04,630 --> 03:03:04,640
after every accident try to figure the
 

7641
03:03:04,640 --> 03:03:08,790
after every accident try to figure the
way how not to to to to step in in into

7642
03:03:08,790 --> 03:03:08,800
way how not to to to to step in in into
 

7643
03:03:08,800 --> 03:03:11,870
way how not to to to to step in in into
the same into the same trap

7644
03:03:11,870 --> 03:03:11,880
the same into the same trap
 

7645
03:03:11,880 --> 03:03:15,910
the same into the same trap
but next accident would actually expose

7646
03:03:15,910 --> 03:03:15,920
but next accident would actually expose
 

7647
03:03:15,920 --> 03:03:18,870
but next accident would actually expose
a new new vulnerability you deal with

7648
03:03:18,870 --> 03:03:18,880
a new new vulnerability you deal with
 

7649
03:03:18,880 --> 03:03:21,550
a new new vulnerability you deal with
Chernobyl and then tsunami comes you

7650
03:03:21,550 --> 03:03:21,560
Chernobyl and then tsunami comes you
 

7651
03:03:21,560 --> 03:03:25,110
Chernobyl and then tsunami comes you
deal with tsunami and then War comes and

7652
03:03:25,110 --> 03:03:25,120
deal with tsunami and then War comes and
 

7653
03:03:25,120 --> 03:03:30,670
deal with tsunami and then War comes and
we we really in that sense um we have

7654
03:03:30,670 --> 03:03:30,680
we we really in that sense um we have
 

7655
03:03:30,680 --> 03:03:32,550
we we really in that sense um we have
sometimes wild imagination but sometimes

7656
03:03:32,550 --> 03:03:32,560
sometimes wild imagination but sometimes
 

7657
03:03:32,560 --> 03:03:34,670
sometimes wild imagination but sometimes
it's difficult to imagine what can

7658
03:03:34,670 --> 03:03:34,680
it's difficult to imagine what can
 

7659
03:03:34,680 --> 03:03:36,790
it's difficult to imagine what can
happen next so we're not done there will

7660
03:03:36,790 --> 03:03:36,800
happen next so we're not done there will
 

7661
03:03:36,800 --> 03:03:38,950
happen next so we're not done there will
be there will be nuclear accidents

7662
03:03:38,950 --> 03:03:38,960
be there will be nuclear accidents
 

7663
03:03:38,960 --> 03:03:42,910
be there will be nuclear accidents
unfortunately in the future and that

7664
03:03:42,910 --> 03:03:42,920
unfortunately in the future and that
 

7665
03:03:42,920 --> 03:03:45,190
unfortunately in the future and that
makes nuclear

7666
03:03:45,190 --> 03:03:45,200
makes nuclear
 

7667
03:03:45,200 --> 03:03:48,750
makes nuclear
energy so problematic when you count on

7668
03:03:48,750 --> 03:03:48,760
energy so problematic when you count on
 

7669
03:03:48,760 --> 03:03:52,670
energy so problematic when you count on
it to fight climate change I'll explain

7670
03:03:52,670 --> 03:03:52,680
it to fight climate change I'll explain
 

7671
03:03:52,680 --> 03:03:56,190
it to fight climate change I'll explain
why you gave the figures how many people

7672
03:03:56,190 --> 03:03:56,200
why you gave the figures how many people
 

7673
03:03:56,200 --> 03:03:58,630
why you gave the figures how many people
die from burning coal from how many

7674
03:03:58,630 --> 03:03:58,640
die from burning coal from how many
 

7675
03:03:58,640 --> 03:04:01,630
die from burning coal from how many
people die from from

7676
03:04:01,630 --> 03:04:01,640
people die from from
 

7677
03:04:01,640 --> 03:04:05,030
people die from from
radiation and it's it's it's a good

7678
03:04:05,030 --> 03:04:05,040
radiation and it's it's it's a good
 

7679
03:04:05,040 --> 03:04:07,550
radiation and it's it's it's a good
argument some people would question them

7680
03:04:07,550 --> 03:04:07,560
argument some people would question them
 

7681
03:04:07,560 --> 03:04:09,550
argument some people would question them
because it's also the issue of not just

7682
03:04:09,550 --> 03:04:09,560
because it's also the issue of not just
 

7683
03:04:09,560 --> 03:04:13,030
because it's also the issue of not just
dying but uh impact impact of radiation

7684
03:04:13,030 --> 03:04:13,040
dying but uh impact impact of radiation
 

7685
03:04:13,040 --> 03:04:15,349
dying but uh impact impact of radiation
on on cancer on on our health which is

not completely understood yet so it's

7688
03:04:17,670 --> 03:04:17,680
not completely understood yet so it's
 

7689
03:04:17,680 --> 03:04:19,150
not completely understood yet so it's
still there there is a lot of question

7690
03:04:19,150 --> 03:04:19,160
still there there is a lot of question
 

7691
03:04:19,160 --> 03:04:20,750
still there there is a lot of question
marks but let's assume what you are

7692
03:04:20,750 --> 03:04:20,760
marks but let's assume what you are
 

7693
03:04:20,760 --> 03:04:24,469
marks but let's assume what you are
saying that's the figures that's how it

7694
03:04:24,469 --> 03:04:24,479
saying that's the figures that's how it
 

7695
03:04:24,479 --> 03:04:29,790
saying that's the figures that's how it
is but we as people we for whatever

7696
03:04:29,790 --> 03:04:29,800
is but we as people we for whatever
 

7697
03:04:29,800 --> 03:04:32,110
is but we as people we for whatever
reason are not afraid of

reason are not afraid of
 

7699
03:04:32,120 --> 03:04:34,670
reason are not afraid of
coal but we are very much afraid of

7700
03:04:34,670 --> 03:04:34,680
coal but we are very much afraid of
 

7701
03:04:34,680 --> 03:04:39,389

it's everywhere MH and you can't you
 

7705
03:04:41,520 --> 03:04:44,469
it's everywhere MH and you can't you
can't see it mhm and then and and then

7706
03:04:44,469 --> 03:04:44,479
can't see it mhm and then and and then
 

7707
03:04:44,479 --> 03:04:46,429
can't see it mhm and then and and then
you start having issues and and then you

7708
03:04:46,429 --> 03:04:46,439
you start having issues and and then you
 

7709
03:04:46,439 --> 03:04:47,590
you start having issues and and then you
have

7710
03:04:47,590 --> 03:04:47,600
have
 

7711
03:04:47,600 --> 03:04:52,990
have
St problems and um during the covid the

7712
03:04:52,990 --> 03:04:53,000
St problems and um during the covid the
 

7713
03:04:53,000 --> 03:04:56,670
St problems and um during the covid the
the governments closed the

7714
03:04:56,670 --> 03:04:56,680

 

7715
03:04:56,680 --> 03:04:59,550

so good ideas I isolation so that was

7718
03:05:03,190 --> 03:05:03,200
so good ideas I isolation so that was
 

7719
03:05:03,200 --> 03:05:06,630
so good ideas I isolation so that was
the way government started to to fight

7720
03:05:06,630 --> 03:05:06,640
the way government started to to fight
 

7721
03:05:06,640 --> 03:05:11,469
the way government started to to fight
for access to uh fiser to to Mna to to

03:05:18,429 --> 03:05:18,439
vaccine uh so now back to the to the
 

7727
03:05:18,439 --> 03:05:21,590

7731
03:05:23,479 --> 03:05:26,389
Chernobyl
happens uh that's the the highest point

7732
03:05:26,389 --> 03:05:26,399
happens uh that's the the highest point
 

7733
03:05:26,399 --> 03:05:28,309
happens uh that's the the highest point
in the development of nuclear industry

7734
03:05:28,309 --> 03:05:28,319
in the development of nuclear industry
 

7735
03:05:28,319 --> 03:05:31,349
in the development of nuclear industry
so far in terms of how many how many new

7736
03:05:31,349 --> 03:05:31,359
so far in terms of how many how many new
 

7737
03:05:31,359 --> 03:05:34,349
so far in terms of how many how many new
reactors were commissioned or the the

7738
03:05:34,349 --> 03:05:34,359
reactors were commissioned or the the
 

7739
03:05:34,359 --> 03:05:36,030
reactors were commissioned or the the
licenses were

7740
03:05:36,030 --> 03:05:36,040
licenses were
 

7741
03:05:36,040 --> 03:05:41,150
licenses were
issued uh the next react reactor after 3

7742
03:05:41,150 --> 03:05:41,160
issued uh the next react reactor after 3
 

7743

m Island in the US us go ahead was given

7744
03:05:45,110 --> 03:05:45,120
m Island in the US us go ahead was given
 

7745
03:05:45,120 --> 03:05:47,349
m Island in the US us go ahead was given
it seems to me 10 years ago or something

7746
03:05:47,349 --> 03:05:47,359
it seems to me 10 years ago or something
 

7747
03:05:47,359 --> 03:05:49,590
it seems to me 10 years ago or something
like that the Fukushima happens the

7748
03:05:49,590 --> 03:05:49,600
like that the Fukushima happens the
 

7749
03:05:49,600 --> 03:05:51,710
like that the Fukushima happens the
reaction is in China to that as well

7750
03:05:51,710 --> 03:05:51,720
reaction is in China to that as well
 

7751
03:05:51,720 --> 03:05:54,110
reaction is in China to that as well
they're very much concerned so there is

7752
03:05:54,110 --> 03:05:54,120
they're very much concerned so there is
 

7753
03:05:54,120 --> 03:05:57,190
they're very much concerned so there is
a saying in the in the field Chernobyl

7754
03:05:57,190 --> 03:05:57,200
a saying in the in the field Chernobyl
 

7755
03:05:57,200 --> 03:05:59,950
a saying in the in the field Chernobyl
anywhere is Chernobyl everywhere after

7756
03:05:59,950 --> 03:05:59,960
anywhere is Chernobyl everywhere after

Fukushima Germany decides to go nuclear

7758
03:06:03,070 --> 03:06:03,080
Fukushima Germany decides to go nuclear
 

7759
03:06:03,080 --> 03:06:05,910
Fukushima Germany decides to go nuclear
free and and gets there at the expense

7760
03:06:05,910 --> 03:06:05,920
free and and gets there at the expense
 

7761
03:06:05,920 --> 03:06:09,429
free and and gets there at the expense
of burning burning coal so that's that's

7762
03:06:09,429 --> 03:06:09,439
of burning burning coal so that's that's
 

7763
03:06:09,439 --> 03:06:13,030
of burning burning coal so that's that's
how we react and each major accident

7764
03:06:13,030 --> 03:06:13,040
how we react and each major accident
 

7765
03:06:13,040 --> 03:06:15,110
how we react and each major accident
that that means Global

7766
03:06:15,110 --> 03:06:15,120
that that means Global
 

7767
03:06:15,120 --> 03:06:18,910
that that means Global

7768
03:06:18,910 --> 03:06:18,920
freeze on the on the on the nuclear
 

7769
03:06:18,920 --> 03:06:21,229

reactor production for at least another
 

7771
03:06:21,239 --> 03:06:24,349
reactor production for at least another
10 years so that's what I mean that

7772
03:06:24,349 --> 03:06:24,359
10 years so that's what I mean that
 

7773
03:06:24,359 --> 03:06:27,349
10 years so that's what I mean that

7781
03:06:36,960 --> 03:06:41,070

unreliable option and to you you suspect
 

7783
03:06:41,080 --> 03:06:43,469
unreliable option and to you you suspect
that that's an irreparable aspect of

7784
03:06:43,469 --> 03:06:43,479
that that's an irreparable aspect of
 

7785
03:06:43,479 --> 03:06:46,269
that that's an irreparable aspect of
human nature and the human mind that

03:06:50,560 --> 03:06:54,790
a kind of panic invisible threats of
this kind whether it's a virus or um or

7792
03:06:54,790 --> 03:06:54,800
this kind whether it's a virus or um or
 

7793
03:06:54,800 --> 03:06:56,670
this kind whether it's a virus or um or
radiation there's something about the

7794
03:06:56,670 --> 03:06:56,680
radiation there's something about the
 

7795
03:06:56,680 --> 03:07:00,710
radiation there's something about the
mind if I get a stomach a in the United

7796
03:07:00,710 --> 03:07:00,720
mind if I get a stomach a in the United
 

7797
03:07:00,720 --> 03:07:02,830
mind if I get a stomach a in the United
States after Fukushima I kind of think

7798
03:07:02,830 --> 03:07:02,840
States after Fukushima I kind of think
 

7799
03:07:02,840 --> 03:07:06,030
States after Fukushima I kind of think
it's probably radiation this kind of uh

7800
03:07:06,030 --> 03:07:06,040
it's probably radiation this kind of uh
 

7801
03:07:06,040 --> 03:07:08,830
it's probably radiation this kind of uh
irrational type of thinking and that's

7802
03:07:08,830 --> 03:07:08,840
irrational type of thinking and that's
 

7803
03:07:08,840 --> 03:07:11,870
irrational type of thinking and that's
not possible to repair I think we can we

7804
03:07:11,870 --> 03:07:11,880
not possible to repair I think we can we
 

7805
03:07:11,880 --> 03:07:13,750
not possible to repair I think we can we
can be we can bet tray

7806
03:07:13,750 --> 03:07:13,760
can be we can bet tray
 

7807
03:07:13,760 --> 03:07:17,229
can be we can bet tray
right we can be pretty smart aren't we

7808
03:07:17,229 --> 03:07:17,239
right we can be pretty smart aren't we
 

7809
03:07:17,239 --> 03:07:18,229
right we can be pretty smart aren't we
but but

7810
03:07:18,229 --> 03:07:18,239
but but
 

7811
03:07:18,239 --> 03:07:20,950
but but
generally we are afraid of things that

7812
03:07:20,950 --> 03:07:20,960
generally we are afraid of things that
 

7813
03:07:20,960 --> 03:07:24,710
generally we are afraid of things that
we see but even more we afraid of things

7814
03:07:24,710 --> 03:07:24,720
we see but even more we afraid of things
 

7815
03:07:24,720 --> 03:07:27,309
we see but even more we afraid of things
that we don't see and radiation is one

7816
03:07:27,309 --> 03:07:27,319
that we don't see and radiation is one
 

7817
03:07:27,319 --> 03:07:30,269
that we don't see and radiation is one

us and I don't think we we ask the

8064
03:13:47,150 --> 03:13:47,160
us and I don't think we we ask the
 

8065
03:13:47,160 --> 03:13:49,469
us and I don't think we we ask the
question qu often enough ask the

8066
03:13:49,469 --> 03:13:49,479
question qu often enough ask the
 

8067
03:13:49,479 --> 03:13:51,670
question qu often enough ask the
question that way and if you don't ask

8068
03:13:51,670 --> 03:13:51,680
question that way and if you don't ask
 

8069
03:13:51,680 --> 03:13:53,309
question that way and if you don't ask
right questions we don't get right

8070
03:13:53,309 --> 03:13:53,319
right questions we don't get right
 

8071
03:13:53,319 --> 03:13:56,349
right questions we don't get right
answers yeah if you've written a book a

8072
03:13:56,349 --> 03:13:56,359
answers yeah if you've written a book a
 

8073
03:13:56,359 --> 03:13:58,950
answers yeah if you've written a book a
great book on the Cuban Missile Crisis

8074
03:13:58,950 --> 03:13:58,960
great book on the Cuban Missile Crisis
 

8075
03:13:58,960 --> 03:14:00,309
great book on the Cuban Missile Crisis
we

8076
03:14:00,309 --> 03:14:00,319
we
 

8077
03:14:00,319 --> 03:14:03,950
we
came very close not to Just Another

8078
03:14:03,950 --> 03:14:03,960
came very close not to Just Another
 

8079
03:14:03,960 --> 03:14:07,110
came very close not to Just Another
World War but to uh you know a nuclear

8080
03:14:07,110 --> 03:14:07,120
World War but to uh you know a nuclear
 

8081
03:14:07,120 --> 03:14:11,469
World War but to uh you know a nuclear
war and um the destruction

8082
03:14:11,469 --> 03:14:11,479
war and um the destruction
 

8083
03:14:11,479 --> 03:14:16,750
war and um the destruction
of human civilization as we know it

8084
03:14:16,750 --> 03:14:16,760
of human civilization as we know it
 

8085
03:14:16,760 --> 03:14:19,870
of human civilization as we know it
so I guess it's a good question to ask

8086
03:14:19,870 --> 03:14:19,880
so I guess it's a good question to ask
 

8087
03:14:19,880 --> 03:14:22,309
so I guess it's a good question to ask
uh what do we do so right and maybe one

8088
03:14:22,309 --> 03:14:22,319
uh what do we do so right and maybe one
 

8089
03:14:22,319 --> 03:14:25,830
uh what do we do so right and maybe one
of the answers could be that we just got

8090
03:14:25,830 --> 03:14:25,840
of the answers could be that we just got
 

8091
03:14:25,840 --> 03:14:28,910
of the answers could be that we just got
lucky and and the question is how do how

8092
03:14:28,910 --> 03:14:28,920
lucky and and the question is how do how
 

8093
03:14:28,920 --> 03:14:30,590
lucky and and the question is how do how
do we keep getting

8094
03:14:30,590 --> 03:14:30,600
do we keep getting
 

8095
03:14:30,600 --> 03:14:33,950
do we keep getting
lucky um luck luck is clearly clearly

8096
03:14:33,950 --> 03:14:33,960
lucky um luck luck is clearly clearly
 

8097
03:14:33,960 --> 03:14:38,469
lucky um luck luck is clearly clearly
one of the factors in in the in um Cuban

8098
03:14:38,469 --> 03:14:38,479
one of the factors in in the in um Cuban
 

8099
03:14:38,479 --> 03:14:41,950
one of the factors in in the in um Cuban
Missile Crisis because uh what happened

8100
03:14:41,950 --> 03:14:41,960
Missile Crisis because uh what happened
 

8101
03:14:41,960 --> 03:14:43,469
Missile Crisis because uh what happened
there and the there is one of the

8102
03:14:43,469 --> 03:14:43,479
there and the there is one of the
 

8103
03:14:43,479 --> 03:14:46,510
there and the there is one of the
lessons is that uh

8104
03:14:46,510 --> 03:14:46,520
lessons is that uh
 

8105
03:14:46,520 --> 03:14:49,389
lessons is that uh
eventually the the commanders at the top

8106
03:14:49,389 --> 03:14:49,399
eventually the the commanders at the top
 

8107
03:14:49,399 --> 03:14:51,229
eventually the the commanders at the top
they believe that they have all the

8108
03:14:51,229 --> 03:14:51,239
they believe that they have all the
 

8109
03:14:51,239 --> 03:14:54,309
they believe that they have all the
cards they negotiate with each other

8110
03:14:54,309 --> 03:14:54,319
cards they negotiate with each other
 

8111
03:14:54,319 --> 03:14:59,070
cards they negotiate with each other
they try to to see who who blinks first

8112
03:14:59,070 --> 03:14:59,080
they try to to see who who blinks first
 

8113
03:14:59,080 --> 03:15:00,790
they try to to see who who blinks first
in in the game of nuclear

8114
03:15:00,790 --> 03:15:00,800
in in the game of nuclear
 

8115
03:15:00,800 --> 03:15:02,870
in in the game of nuclear
brinkmanship the trick

8116
03:15:02,870 --> 03:15:02,880
brinkmanship the trick
 

8117
03:15:02,880 --> 03:15:06,469
brinkmanship the trick
is that they don't

8118
03:15:06,469 --> 03:15:06,479
is that they don't
 

8119
03:15:06,479 --> 03:15:09,269
is that they don't
control fully people on the

8120
03:15:09,269 --> 03:15:09,279
control fully people on the
 

8121
03:15:09,279 --> 03:15:12,070
control fully people on the
ground the most dangerous moment of one

8122
03:15:12,070 --> 03:15:12,080
ground the most dangerous moment of one
 

8123
03:15:12,080 --> 03:15:13,750
ground the most dangerous moment of one
of the most dangerous moment of the

8124
03:15:13,750 --> 03:15:13,760
of the most dangerous moment of the
 

8125
03:15:13,760 --> 03:15:16,990
of the most dangerous moment of the
Cuban Missile Crisis was the Soviet

War uh
 

8135
03:15:29,239 --> 03:15:32,389
War uh
and the the order to shoot the missile

8136
03:15:32,389 --> 03:15:32,399
and the the order to shoot the missile
 

8137
03:15:32,399 --> 03:15:35,150
and the the order to shoot the missile
was given with Moscow having no clue

8138
03:15:35,150 --> 03:15:35,160
was given with Moscow having no clue
 

8139
03:15:35,160 --> 03:15:37,110
was given with Moscow having no clue
what was going on the ground Moscow

never gave gave approval for
 

8143
03:15:39,720 --> 03:15:42,790
never gave gave approval for
that and uh again I described that in

8144
03:15:42,790 --> 03:15:42,800
that and uh again I described that in
 

8145
03:15:42,800 --> 03:15:45,750
that and uh again I described that in
book many times about Kennedy bringing

8146
03:15:45,750 --> 03:15:45,760
book many times about Kennedy bringing
 

8147
03:15:45,760 --> 03:15:48,710
book many times about Kennedy bringing
back his wisdom from World War II years

8148
03:15:48,710 --> 03:15:48,720
back his wisdom from World War II years
 

8149
03:15:48,720 --> 03:15:51,590
back his wisdom from World War II years
there there always will be S so B who

8150
03:15:51,590 --> 03:15:51,600
there there always will be S so B who
 

8151
03:15:51,600 --> 03:15:55,030
there there always will be S so B who
didn't get the order or or or missed

8152
03:15:55,030 --> 03:15:55,040
didn't get the order or or or missed
 

8153
03:15:55,040 --> 03:15:57,150
didn't get the order or or or missed
things and and that was happening on the

8154
03:15:57,150 --> 03:15:57,160
things and and that was happening on the
 

8155
03:15:57,160 --> 03:16:01,030
things and and that was happening on the
American side as well so uh people who

8156
03:16:01,030 --> 03:16:01,040
American side as well so uh people who
 

8157
03:16:01,040 --> 03:16:02,950
American side as well so uh people who
believe that they in control really are

8158
03:16:02,950 --> 03:16:02,960
believe that they in control really are
 

8159
03:16:02,960 --> 03:16:05,229
believe that they in control really are
not in control and that can

8160
03:16:05,229 --> 03:16:05,239
not in control and that can
 

8161
03:16:05,239 --> 03:16:09,389
not in control and that can
escalate uh whether they very often

8162
03:16:09,389 --> 03:16:09,399
escalate uh whether they very often
 

8163
03:16:09,399 --> 03:16:11,590
escalate uh whether they very often
against against their their ises so that

8164
03:16:11,590 --> 03:16:11,600
against against their their ises so that
 

8165
03:16:11,600 --> 03:16:15,469
against against their their ises so that
is one lesson but going back to what why

8166
03:16:15,469 --> 03:16:15,479
is one lesson but going back to what why
 

8167
03:16:15,479 --> 03:16:18,710
is one lesson but going back to what why
we're still here and why why the world

8168
03:16:18,710 --> 03:16:18,720
we're still here and why why the world
 

8169
03:16:18,720 --> 03:16:21,349
we're still here and why why the world
didn't didn't end up in

8170
03:16:21,349 --> 03:16:21,359
didn't didn't end up in
 

8171
03:16:21,359 --> 03:16:24,710
didn't didn't end up in
1962 is that the leadership and and

8172
03:16:24,710 --> 03:16:24,720
1962 is that the leadership and and
 

8173
03:16:24,720 --> 03:16:27,070
1962 is that the leadership and and
that's that's I I come to the issue that

8174
03:16:27,070 --> 03:16:27,080
that's that's I I come to the issue that
 

8175
03:16:27,080 --> 03:16:30,150
that's that's I I come to the issue that
you strongly believe in that people

8176
03:16:30,150 --> 03:16:30,160
you strongly believe in that people
 

8177

the the later maybe for kusov to make

8222
03:17:36,950 --> 03:17:36,960
the the later maybe for kusov to make
 

8223
03:17:36,960 --> 03:17:40,110
the the later maybe for kusov to make
sure that this that the war between the

8224
03:17:40,110 --> 03:17:40,120
sure that this that the war between the
 

8225
03:17:40,120 --> 03:17:43,710
sure that this that the war between the
United States and and and uh the Soviet

8226
03:17:43,710 --> 03:17:43,720
United States and and and uh the Soviet
 

8227
03:17:43,720 --> 03:17:45,950
United States and and and uh the Soviet
Union doesn't start because they knew

8228
03:17:45,950 --> 03:17:45,960
Union doesn't start because they knew
 

8229
03:17:45,960 --> 03:17:48,790
Union doesn't start because they knew
that that war would be would be a

8230
03:17:48,790 --> 03:17:48,800
that that war would be would be a
 

8231
03:17:48,800 --> 03:17:53,110
that that war would be would be a
nuclear war so we have we have a very

8232
03:17:53,110 --> 03:17:53,120
nuclear war so we have we have a very
 

8233
03:17:53,120 --> 03:17:56,630
nuclear war so we have we have a very
very paradoxical sort of situation the

8234
03:17:56,630 --> 03:17:56,640
very paradoxical sort of situation the
 

8235
03:17:56,640 --> 03:17:58,830
very paradoxical sort of situation the
crisis occurred because of the nuclear

8236
03:17:58,830 --> 03:17:58,840
crisis occurred because of the nuclear
 

8237
03:17:58,840 --> 03:18:01,950
crisis occurred because of the nuclear
weapons because kosov put them on Cuba

8238
03:18:01,950 --> 03:18:01,960
weapons because kosov put them on Cuba
 

8239
03:18:01,960 --> 03:18:03,870
weapons because kosov put them on Cuba
but the crisis was resolved and we

8240
03:18:03,870 --> 03:18:03,880
but the crisis was resolved and we
 

8241
03:18:03,880 --> 03:18:06,070
but the crisis was resolved and we
didn't end in the third world war

8242
03:18:06,070 --> 03:18:06,080
didn't end in the third world war
 

8243
03:18:06,080 --> 03:18:09,110
didn't end in the third world war
because of the nuclear weapons

8244
03:18:09,110 --> 03:18:09,120
because of the nuclear weapons
 

8245
03:18:09,120 --> 03:18:13,389
because of the nuclear weapons
because people leaders were afraid of

8246
03:18:13,389 --> 03:18:13,399
because people leaders were afraid of
 

8247
03:18:13,399 --> 03:18:15,990
because people leaders were afraid of
them and that's that's where I want to

8248
03:18:15,990 --> 03:18:16,000
them and that's that's where I want to
 

8249
03:18:16,000 --> 03:18:18,309
them and that's that's where I want to
put emphasis it's not that the nuclear

8250
03:18:18,309 --> 03:18:18,319
put emphasis it's not that the nuclear
 

8251
03:18:18,319 --> 03:18:20,990
put emphasis it's not that the nuclear
weapons created crisis or solve the

8252
03:18:20,990 --> 03:18:21,000
weapons created crisis or solve the
 

8253
03:18:21,000 --> 03:18:23,349
weapons created crisis or solve the
crisis it's basically our perception of

8254
03:18:23,349 --> 03:18:23,359
crisis it's basically our perception of
 

8255
03:18:23,359 --> 03:18:28,189
crisis it's basically our perception of
them and we are now in the age after the

03:18:28,189 --> 03:18:28,199
them and we are now in the age after the
