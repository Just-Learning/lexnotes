probably an index you can put together

172
00:03:39,309 --> 00:03:39,319
probably an index you can put together
 

173
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,429
probably an index you can put together
like yeah right

174

like yeah right
 

175
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:44,390
like yeah right
exactly peration that that's a really

176
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,400
exactly peration that that's a really
 

177
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,990
exactly peration that that's a really
interesting way to put it because

178
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:47,000
interesting way to put it because

201
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,830

very very sad for me and when you go to

202
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:17,840
very very sad for me and when you go to
 

203
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,390
very very sad for me and when you go to
a place where where you live grow up in

a place where where that human life is
 

207
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,830
a place where where that human life is
not valued there's there's something

00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:25,840
not valued there's there's something

about to be

1246
00:25:34,789 --> 00:25:34,799

well in the background and I think

1254
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:42,720
well in the background and I think

well in the background and I think
that's what restaurants do is a very

1256
00:25:44,909 --> 00:25:44,919
that's what restaurants do is a very
 

1257
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:46,870
that's what restaurants do is a very
very subtle version of that you're in a

1258
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:46,880
very subtle version of that you're in a
 

1259
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,230
very subtle version of that you're in a
room with strangers yeah and you're yeah

1260
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:49,240
room with strangers yeah and you're yeah

1267
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,909
in a room of strangers and it's just
something that adds that energy to to

if you change it up and you mix up a
 

2619
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:17,349
if you change it up and you mix up a
whole bunch of salt you've now

2620
00:52:17,349 --> 00:52:17,359
whole bunch of salt you've now
 

2621
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:20,150
whole bunch of salt you've now
multiplied your learning path so for me

2622
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:20,160
multiplied your learning path so for me
 

2623
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,910

if uh if I ever change it I might

2628
00:52:29,069 --> 00:52:29,079
if uh if I ever change it I might
 

2629
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:31,069
if uh if I ever change it I might
sprinkle a little bit of molden salt a

2630

more for for that at when you're
 

2635
00:52:36,359 --> 00:52:37,829
more for for that at when you're
actually eating texture yeah it gives

2636
00:52:37,829 --> 00:52:37,839
actually eating texture yeah it gives
 

2637
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:39,710
actually eating texture yeah it gives
you texture as well as salt exactly you

2638
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:39,720
you texture as well as salt exactly you
 

2639
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,069
you texture as well as salt exactly you
wouldn't use it on scrambled eggs but

2640
00:52:41,069 --> 00:52:41,079
wouldn't use it on scrambled eggs but
 

2641
00:52:41,079 --> 00:52:44,829
wouldn't use it on scrambled eggs but
the but if you switch out your salts

2642
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:44,839
the but if you switch out your salts
 

2643
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:46,589
the but if you switch out your salts
it's a different

2644
00:52:46,589 --> 00:52:46,599
it's a different
 

2645
00:52:46,599 --> 00:52:50,150
it's a different
weapon need to learn it you I like I

2646
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:50,160
weapon need to learn it you I like I
 

2647
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,829
weapon need to learn it you I like I
like how you know usually there's wine

2648
00:52:53,829 --> 00:52:53,839

back to sort of farm to table when

2652
00:52:58,230 --> 00:52:58,240
back to sort of farm to table when
 

2653
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,030
back to sort of farm to table when
you're talking about carrots in that

2654
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:01,040
you're talking about carrots in that
 

2655
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,109
you're talking about carrots in that
same rigor and Nuance you have to

2656
00:53:04,109 --> 00:53:04,119
same rigor and Nuance you have to
 

2657
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:06,430
same rigor and Nuance you have to
consider the different Farms involved

2658
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:06,440
consider the different Farms involved
 

2659
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,430

for the carrots in that same way you
 

2661
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,109
for the carrots in that same way you
have to consider the different salts

2662
00:53:11,109 --> 00:53:11,119
have to consider the different salts
 

2663
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:13,670
have to consider the different salts
yeah with like and also not even all

2664
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:13,680
yeah with like and also not even all
 

2665
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,390
yeah with like and also not even all
kosha salts are the same it's the

2666
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:15,400
kosha salts are the same it's the
 

2667
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,349
kosha salts are the same it's the
particular salt that you like get to

2668
00:53:18,349 --> 00:53:18,359
particular salt that you like get to
 

2669
00:53:18,359 --> 00:53:21,390
particular salt that you like get to
know it be get in a relationship with it

2670
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:21,400
know it be get in a relationship with it
 

2671
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,990
know it be get in a relationship with it
it's like great people learn so much how

2672
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:24,000
it's like great people learn so much how
 

2673
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,430
it's like great people learn so much how
they in terms of the uh the measurement

2674
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:26,440
they in terms of the uh the measurement
 

2675
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,430
they in terms of the uh the measurement
the proportion the the amount you put of

2676
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:28,440
the proportion the the amount you put of
 

2677
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,910
the proportion the the amount you put of
salt you put in are you doing that like

2678
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:31,920
salt you put in are you doing that like
 

2679
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,190
salt you put in are you doing that like
exactly or are you doing it by feel so

2680
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:34,200
exactly or are you doing it by feel so
 

2681
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,390
exactly or are you doing it by feel so
it's by feel and that's where you get

2682
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:35,400
it's by feel and that's where you get
 

2683
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,549
it's by feel and that's where you get
the relationship so in fact I have a in

2684
00:53:37,549 --> 00:53:37,559
the relationship so in fact I have a in
 

2685
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:39,349
the relationship so in fact I have a in
the the book in The cookbook I have QR

2686
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:39,359
the the book in The cookbook I have QR
 

2687
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:42,150
the the book in The cookbook I have QR
codes that people can scan because uh

2688
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:42,160
codes that people can scan because uh
 

2689
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,549
codes that people can scan because uh
what I struggle with recipes is they

2690
00:53:43,549 --> 00:53:43,559
what I struggle with recipes is they
 

2691
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:46,150
what I struggle with recipes is they
don't they don't teach technique right

2692
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:46,160
don't they don't teach technique right
 

2693
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,430
don't they don't teach technique right
they can they can describe the technique

2694
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:47,440
they can they can describe the technique
 

2695
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,349
they can they can describe the technique
but they don't teach the technique it's

2696
00:53:49,349 --> 00:53:49,359
but they don't teach the technique it's
 

2697
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,309
but they don't teach the technique it's
it's a technique it's not a recipe and

2698
00:53:51,309 --> 00:53:51,319
it's a technique it's not a recipe and
 

2699
00:53:51,319 --> 00:53:53,430
it's a technique it's not a recipe and
so one of the one of the lessons is how

2700
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:53,440
so one of the one of the lessons is how
 

2701
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,950

so you can see with your eyes CU they're
 

2709
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,589
so you can see with your eyes CU they're
little flakes how much salt is on your

2710
00:54:09,589 --> 00:54:09,599
little flakes how much salt is on your
 

2711
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:12,430
little flakes how much salt is on your
steak and then taste cook it and then

2712
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:12,440
steak and then taste cook it and then
 

2713
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,910
steak and then taste cook it and then
taste it and know you think you need

2714
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:14,920
taste it and know you think you need
 

2715
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,069
taste it and know you think you need
more or you need it less okay now next

2716
00:54:17,069 --> 00:54:17,079
more or you need it less okay now next
 

2717
00:54:17,079 --> 00:54:19,150
more or you need it less okay now next
time put a little more on because you

2718
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:19,160
time put a little more on because you
 

2719
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:22,190
time put a little more on because you
can see it and it's about learning the

2720
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:22,200
can see it and it's about learning the
 

2721
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,950
can see it and it's about learning the
the the fact that you you want to be

2722
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:23,960
the the fact that you you want to be
 

2723
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,950
the the fact that you you want to be
able to see how much salt is on the

2724
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:25,960
able to see how much salt is on the
 

2725
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,109
able to see how much salt is on the
steak so that you can then train

2726
00:54:27,109 --> 00:54:27,119
steak so that you can then train
 

2727
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:28,470
steak so that you can then train
yourself for the future of how much salt

2728
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:28,480
yourself for the future of how much salt
 

2729
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,190
yourself for the future of how much salt
you want to your steak Yeah but then the

2730
00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:30,200
you want to your steak Yeah but then the
 

2731
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,589
you want to your steak Yeah but then the
steak and the salt kind of dance

2732
00:54:31,589 --> 00:54:31,599
steak and the salt kind of dance
 

2733
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:32,829
steak and the salt kind of dance
together it depends on where the steak

2734
00:54:32,829 --> 00:54:32,839
together it depends on where the steak
 

2735
00:54:32,839 --> 00:54:34,789
together it depends on where the steak
came from true that's true all the

2736
00:54:34,789 --> 00:54:34,799
came from true that's true all the
 

2737
00:54:34,799 --> 00:54:36,270
came from true that's true all the
thickness of the steak that'll make a

2738
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:36,280
thickness of the steak that'll make a
 

2739
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,309
thickness of the steak that'll make a
difference but for the most part if you

2740
00:54:38,309 --> 00:54:38,319
difference but for the most part if you
 

2741
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:41,589
difference but for the most part if you
learn if if you're able to see it versus

2742
00:54:41,589 --> 00:54:41,599
learn if if you're able to see it versus
 

2743
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:43,710
learn if if you're able to see it versus
table salt for example just just just

2744
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:43,720
table salt for example just just just
 

2745
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,950
table salt for example just just just
disappears you just can't see what

2746
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:45,960
disappears you just can't see what
 

2747
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,150
disappears you just can't see what
you're putting on your steak you can't

2748
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:47,160
you're putting on your steak you can't
 

2749
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,789
you're putting on your steak you can't
really learn as a result I think you

2750
00:54:48,789 --> 00:54:48,799
really learn as a result I think you
 

2751
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:50,589
really learn as a result I think you
talk about roast chickens where your

2752
00:54:50,589 --> 00:54:50,599
talk about roast chickens where your
 

2753
00:54:50,599 --> 00:54:53,030
talk about roast chickens where your
love of food be uh began what about

2754
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:53,040
love of food be uh began what about
 

2755

downhill so that's created the wrong
center of gravity so instead of breaking

3208
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:06,720
center of gravity so instead of breaking
 

3209
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:09,789
center of gravity so instead of breaking
it just through me I landed on my head

3210
01:04:09,789 --> 01:04:09,799
it just through me I landed on my head
 

3211
01:04:09,799 --> 01:04:12,150
it just through me I landed on my head
my head went into my chest like

3212
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:12,160
my head went into my chest like
 

3213
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:15,549
my head went into my chest like
compression into my chest down like that

3214
01:04:15,549 --> 01:04:15,559
compression into my chest down like that
 

3215
01:04:15,559 --> 01:04:19,549
compression into my chest down like that
I ruptured my spine at C6 and

3216
01:04:19,549 --> 01:04:19,559
I ruptured my spine at C6 and
 

3217
01:04:19,559 --> 01:04:21,069
I ruptured my spine at C6 and
C7

I found a way to turn myself around so

3270
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:30,160
I found a way to turn myself around so
 

3271
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,349
I found a way to turn myself around so
that my face wouldn't be on the ground

3272
01:05:32,349 --> 01:05:32,359
that my face wouldn't be on the ground
 

3273
01:05:32,359 --> 01:05:33,710
that my face wouldn't be on the ground
but I knew I couldn't

3274
01:05:33,710 --> 01:05:33,720
but I knew I couldn't
 

3275
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:37,630
but I knew I couldn't
move and um uh that they said actually

3276
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:37,640
move and um uh that they said actually
 

3277
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:40,430
move and um uh that they said actually
caused more damage than well obviously

3278
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:40,440
caused more damage than well obviously
 

3279
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:41,910
caused more damage than well obviously
the accident created the opening but

3280
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:41,920
the accident created the opening but
 

3281
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:44,549
the accident created the opening but
once once you move your body the blood

3282
01:05:44,549 --> 01:05:44,559
once once you move your body the blood
 

3283
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:46,589
once once you move your body the blood
goes into the spinal column at a faster

3284
01:05:46,589 --> 01:05:46,599
goes into the spinal column at a faster
 

3285
01:05:46,599 --> 01:05:48,710
goes into the spinal column at a faster
rate and that that is what caused my

3286
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:48,720
rate and that that is what caused my
 

3287
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:54,630
rate and that that is what caused my
paralysis but I remember that and I um

3288
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:54,640
paralysis but I remember that and I um
 

3289
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:57,510
paralysis but I remember that and I um
I remember getting into the into the the

seconds minutes it was a different
 

3299
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:10,750
seconds minutes it was a different
feeling of death it was it's

3300
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:10,760

 

3301

moving you your brain even thinks it's
moving but it's not moving it's like the

3338
01:06:59,109 --> 01:06:59,119
moving but it's not moving it's like the
 

3339
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:03,029
moving but it's not moving it's like the
worst like most terrifying thing so the

3340
01:07:03,029 --> 01:07:03,039
worst like most terrifying thing so the

3344
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:08,200
your neck was really at a Zer degree
 

3345
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:11,870
your neck was really at a Zer degree
angle that so rare but as a result there

3346
01:07:11,870 --> 01:07:11,880
angle that so rare but as a result there
 

3347
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,190
angle that so rare but as a result there
is no twisting of the of the

3348
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:14,200
is no twisting of the of the
 

3349
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,230
is no twisting of the of the
spine we think that we can get the blood

3350
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:16,240
spine we think that we can get the blood
 

3351
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:17,829
spine we think that we can get the blood
out of your of your spinal column and

3352
01:07:17,829 --> 01:07:17,839
out of your of your spinal column and
 

3353
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:20,269
out of your of your spinal column and
you should get uh some or maybe all of

3665
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:07,870
instruction manual yeah sure so first of
all I think many many different ways to

3666
01:14:07,870 --> 01:14:07,880
all I think many many different ways to
 

3667
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:09,510
all I think many many different ways to
do it right so and I have done I've done

3668
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:09,520
do it right so and I have done I've done
 

3669
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:12,910
do it right so and I have done I've done
many many different ways um there's a

3670
01:14:12,910 --> 01:14:12,920
many many different ways um there's a
 

3671
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:15,030
many many different ways um there's a
very Western medicine approach where you

3672
01:14:15,030 --> 01:14:15,040
very Western medicine approach where you
 

3673
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:18,870
very Western medicine approach where you
have uh doctors that uh look after you

3674
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:18,880
have uh doctors that uh look after you
 

3675
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:21,870
have uh doctors that uh look after you
during the day you know put an eye mask

3676
01:14:21,870 --> 01:14:21,880
during the day you know put an eye mask
 

3677
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:23,910
during the day you know put an eye mask
on you're on on a futon and you're

3678
01:14:23,910 --> 01:14:23,920
on you're on on a futon and you're
 

3679
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:27,270
on you're on on a futon and you're
really are in a western medicine setting

3680
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:27,280
really are in a western medicine setting
 

3681
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:30,310
really are in a western medicine setting
and it's a frankly for me has been the

3682
01:14:30,310 --> 01:14:30,320
and it's a frankly for me has been the
 

3683
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,310
and it's a frankly for me has been the
most powerful experience I feel the most

3684
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:32,320
most powerful experience I feel the most
 

3685
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,550
most powerful experience I feel the most
comfortable because I'm part of western

3686
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:34,560
comfortable because I'm part of western
 

3687
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:37,790
comfortable because I'm part of western
medicine in my upbringing The Other

Extreme that they're kind of in between

01:14:39,950 --> 01:14:39,960
Extreme that they're kind of in between
 

3691
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:42,229
Extreme that they're kind of in between
would be very probably a Peruvian

3692
01:14:42,229 --> 01:14:42,239
would be very probably a Peruvian
 

3693
01:14:42,239 --> 01:14:43,590
would be very probably a Peruvian
ceremon where probably where we going to

3694
01:14:43,590 --> 01:14:43,600
ceremon where probably where we going to
 

3695
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:47,590
ceremon where probably where we going to
go very much um uh

3696
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:47,600
go very much um uh
 

3697
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:50,229
go very much um uh
about you do it in a community you do it

3698
01:14:50,229 --> 01:14:50,239
about you do it in a community you do it
 

3699
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:52,110
about you do it in a community you do it
with others and you you feel people go

3700
01:14:52,110 --> 01:14:52,120
with others and you you feel people go
 

3701
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:53,950
with others and you you feel people go
through their pain and their

3702
01:14:53,950 --> 01:14:53,960
through their pain and their
 

3703
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:56,310
through their pain and their
processing um so I I know I know the

3704
01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:56,320
processing um so I I know I know the
 

3705
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,270
processing um so I I know I know the
whole gamut but the the thing that the

3706
01:14:58,270 --> 01:14:58,280
whole gamut but the the thing that the
 

3707
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:00,149
whole gamut but the the thing that the
thing that I found most powerful about

3708
01:15:00,149 --> 01:15:00,159
thing that I found most powerful about
 

3709
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:02,550
thing that I found most powerful about
it uh and profoundly powerful I would

3710
01:15:02,550 --> 01:15:02,560
it uh and profoundly powerful I would
 

3711
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,390
it uh and profoundly powerful I would
say first of all it's non-recreational

3712
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:04,400
say first of all it's non-recreational
 

3713
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:07,550
say first of all it's non-recreational
so no don't no one should do this for a

3714
01:15:07,550 --> 01:15:07,560
so no don't no one should do this for a
 

3715
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:10,350
so no don't no one should do this for a
good time it's is not a good time this

3716
01:15:10,350 --> 01:15:10,360
good time it's is not a good time this
 

3717
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:14,830
good time it's is not a good time this
is uh this is a very almost traumatic

3718
01:15:14,830 --> 01:15:14,840
is uh this is a very almost traumatic
 

3719
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,390
is uh this is a very almost traumatic
but in again a beautiful way I actually

3720
01:15:16,390 --> 01:15:16,400
but in again a beautiful way I actually
 

3721
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:17,709
but in again a beautiful way I actually
going to say that way but it's not it's

3722
01:15:17,709 --> 01:15:17,719
going to say that way but it's not it's
 

3723
01:15:17,719 --> 01:15:20,390
going to say that way but it's not it's
not traumatic it's

3724
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:20,400
not traumatic it's
 

3725
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,830
not traumatic it's
profound so it's it's more like you

3726
01:15:22,830 --> 01:15:22,840
profound so it's it's more like you
 

3727
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:24,950
profound so it's it's more like you
don't have

3728
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:24,960
don't have
 

3729
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:28,990
don't have
have you you you you you really leave

3730
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:29,000
have you you you you you really leave

who you were before
 

3733
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,149
who you were before
behind and then you become the person

3734
01:15:36,149 --> 01:15:36,159
behind and then you become the person
 

3735
01:15:36,159 --> 01:15:39,470
behind and then you become the person
you will be

3736
01:15:39,470 --> 01:15:39,480

 

3737
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:42,030

engine could was not cooling so we had
 

3805
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:05,830
engine could was not cooling so we had
to put the heat on so we for the heat

3806
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:05,840
to put the heat on so we for the heat
 

3807
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:08,070
to put the heat on so we for the heat
blasting to cool the keep the engine

but actually the outside heat is hotter
 

3815
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:15,629
but actually the outside heat is hotter
than the inside heat so you're you're

than the inside heat so you're you're
 

3817
01:17:15,639 --> 01:17:18,870

zip 2 that was an interesting time in
 

4327
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:51,550
zip 2 that was an interesting time in
the history of tech yeah what I mean

4328
01:27:51,550 --> 01:27:51,560
the history of tech yeah what I mean
 

4329
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:53,990
the history of tech yeah what I mean
what was it like you

4333
01:27:57,320 --> 01:28:01,229
mentioned uh the first people to look at
a map uh basically a directions yeah so

4334
01:28:01,229 --> 01:28:01,239
a map uh basically a directions yeah so
 

4335
01:28:01,239 --> 01:28:02,669
a map uh basically a directions yeah so
mapping had been on the internet but

4336
01:28:02,669 --> 01:28:02,679
mapping had been on the internet but
 

4337
01:28:02,679 --> 01:28:05,149
mapping had been on the internet but
vector-based mapping had not so that's

4338
01:28:05,149 --> 01:28:05,159
vector-based mapping had not so that's
 

4339
01:28:05,159 --> 01:28:07,310
vector-based mapping had not so that's
the ability to zoom in or zoom out and

4340
01:28:07,310 --> 01:28:07,320
the ability to zoom in or zoom out and
 

4341
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:09,750
the ability to zoom in or zoom out and
it's really data versus an image that

4342
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:09,760
it's really data versus an image that
 

4343
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:12,629
it's really data versus an image that
comes across and uh we we came went to

4344
01:28:12,629 --> 01:28:12,639
comes across and uh we we came went to
 

4345

also a very hard company to build and I
 

4459
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:30,270
also a very hard company to build and I

future at that time
 

4603
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:23,910
future at that time
like the company that Tesla is today

4604
01:33:23,910 --> 01:33:23,920
like the company that Tesla is today
 

4605
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:26,229
like the company that Tesla is today
could you have possibly could you Elon

4606
01:33:26,229 --> 01:33:26,239
could you have possibly could you Elon
 

4607
01:33:26,239 --> 01:33:30,149
could you have possibly could you Elon
imagine it no no I I um I certainly

4608
01:33:30,149 --> 01:33:30,159
imagine it no no I I um I certainly
 

4609
01:33:30,159 --> 01:33:33,790
imagine it no no I I um I certainly
didn't what I what I saw in it

4610
01:33:33,790 --> 01:33:33,800
didn't what I what I saw in it
 

4611
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:37,790
didn't what I what I saw in it
was a real for me personally I was

4612
01:33:37,790 --> 01:33:37,800
was a real for me personally I was
 

4613
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:40,750
was a real for me personally I was
really upset that the General Motors had

4614
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:40,760
really upset that the General Motors had
 

4615
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:43,229
really upset that the General Motors had
killed the their EV car there's even a

4616
01:33:43,229 --> 01:33:43,239
killed the their EV car there's even a
 

4617
01:33:43,239 --> 01:33:45,510
killed the their EV car there's even a
movie called who killed the electric car

4618
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:45,520
movie called who killed the electric car
 

4619
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:50,109
movie called who killed the electric car
and I and I knew that the the physics of

4620
01:33:50,109 --> 01:33:50,119
and I and I knew that the the physics of
 

4621
01:33:50,119 --> 01:33:53,390
and I and I knew that the the physics of
of um of electric is perfectly fine I

4622
01:33:53,390 --> 01:33:53,400
of um of electric is perfectly fine I
 

4623
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:55,189
of um of electric is perfectly fine I
mean there's no reason why you couldn't

4624
01:33:55,189 --> 01:33:55,199
mean there's no reason why you couldn't
 

4625
01:33:55,199 --> 01:33:57,750
mean there's no reason why you couldn't
use an electric car to drive around what

4626
01:33:57,750 --> 01:33:57,760
use an electric car to drive around what
 

4627
01:33:57,760 --> 01:33:59,510
use an electric car to drive around what
what I what resonated with me with the

4628
01:33:59,510 --> 01:33:59,520
what I what resonated with me with the
 

4629
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:01,350
what I what resonated with me with the
with the business plan

4630
01:34:01,350 --> 01:34:01,360
with the business plan
 

4631
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:03,870
with the business plan
was take an electric motor which is

4632
01:34:03,870 --> 01:34:03,880
was take an electric motor which is
 

4633
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:06,350
was take an electric motor which is
really a high performance motor and put

4634
01:34:06,350 --> 01:34:06,360
really a high performance motor and put
 

4635
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:09,070
really a high performance motor and put
it in a sports car and sell it at a high

4636
01:34:09,070 --> 01:34:09,080
it in a sports car and sell it at a high
 

4637
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:11,590
it in a sports car and sell it at a high
price as a way to enter into the market

4638
01:34:11,590 --> 01:34:11,600
price as a way to enter into the market
 

4639
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:13,790
price as a way to enter into the market
whereas what what others had been doing

4640
01:34:13,790 --> 01:34:13,800
whereas what what others had been doing
 

4641
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:15,629
whereas what what others had been doing
at least General Motors had done is you

4642
01:34:15,629 --> 01:34:15,639
at least General Motors had done is you
 

4643
01:34:15,639 --> 01:34:18,510
at least General Motors had done is you
put it into a really crummy car and you

4644
01:34:18,510 --> 01:34:18,520
put it into a really crummy car and you
 

4645
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:20,229
put it into a really crummy car and you
you sell it as a commuter vehicle that

4646
01:34:20,229 --> 01:34:20,239
you sell it as a commuter vehicle that
 

4647
01:34:20,239 --> 01:34:22,390
you sell it as a commuter vehicle that
doesn't really work that well and looks

4648
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:22,400
doesn't really work that well and looks
 

4649
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:23,550
doesn't really work that well and looks
ugly as well like they really did

4650
01:34:23,550 --> 01:34:23,560
ugly as well like they really did
 

4651
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:25,229
ugly as well like they really did
everything they could to make that thing

4652
01:34:25,229 --> 01:34:25,239
everything they could to make that thing
 

4653
01:34:25,239 --> 01:34:28,550
everything they could to make that thing
as ugly as Sin and and then um I was

4654
01:34:28,550 --> 01:34:28,560
as ugly as Sin and and then um I was
 

4655
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:30,350
as ugly as Sin and and then um I was
like okay I get it we're we're going to

4656
01:34:30,350 --> 01:34:30,360
like okay I get it we're we're going to
 

4657
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:32,990
like okay I get it we're we're going to
take a an appropriate technology and put

4658
01:34:32,990 --> 01:34:33,000
take a an appropriate technology and put
 

4659
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,470
take a an appropriate technology and put
it in an appropriate car so that when

4660
01:34:36,470 --> 01:34:36,480
it in an appropriate car so that when
 

4661
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:38,550
it in an appropriate car so that when
you have because electric motors they

4662
01:34:38,550 --> 01:34:38,560
you have because electric motors they
 

4663
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:41,910
you have because electric motors they
have constant torque you incredible

4664
01:34:41,910 --> 01:34:41,920
have constant torque you incredible
 

4665
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,390
have constant torque you incredible
power put it in a car that that looks

4666
01:34:44,390 --> 01:34:44,400
power put it in a car that that looks
 

4667
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:47,270
power put it in a car that that looks
like a sports car you know so so so the

4668
01:34:47,270 --> 01:34:47,280
like a sports car you know so so so the
 

4669
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:49,390
like a sports car you know so so so the
idea was to put it in the Lotus Elise

4670
01:34:49,390 --> 01:34:49,400
idea was to put it in the Lotus Elise
 

4671
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:52,030
idea was to put it in the Lotus Elise
redesigned it a bit um

4672
01:34:52,030 --> 01:34:52,040
redesigned it a bit um
 

4673
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:54,390
redesigned it a bit um
and um I even at that point I was like

4674
01:34:54,390 --> 01:34:54,400
and um I even at that point I was like
 

4675
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:56,870
and um I even at that point I was like
this is theoretically good so I'm going

4676
01:34:56,870 --> 01:34:56,880
this is theoretically good so I'm going
 

4677
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:59,750
this is theoretically good so I'm going
to join and help build it but I was not

4678
01:34:59,750 --> 01:34:59,760
to join and help build it but I was not
 

4679
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:01,350
to join and help build it but I was not
convinced that it would work because

4680
01:35:01,350 --> 01:35:01,360
convinced that it would work because
 

4681
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:02,790
convinced that it would work because
because General Motors had done such a

4682
01:35:02,790 --> 01:35:02,800
because General Motors had done such a
 

4683
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,669
because General Motors had done such a
terrible job of making everyone think

4684
01:35:04,669 --> 01:35:04,679
terrible job of making everyone think
 

4685
01:35:04,679 --> 01:35:06,990
terrible job of making everyone think
that these things are terrible but but I

4686
01:35:06,990 --> 01:35:07,000
that these things are terrible but but I
 

4687
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,790
that these things are terrible but but I
was curious and the time that I fell in

4688
01:35:09,790 --> 01:35:09,800
was curious and the time that I fell in
 

4689
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,790
was curious and the time that I fell in
love with the company and its mission

4690
01:35:11,790 --> 01:35:11,800
love with the company and its mission
 

4691
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:15,750
love with the company and its mission
was I was driving in in a in a what's

4692
01:35:15,750 --> 01:35:15,760
was I was driving in in a in a what's
 

4693
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:19,390
was I was driving in in a in a what's
called a mule where we we take a a a a

4694
01:35:19,390 --> 01:35:19,400
called a mule where we we take a a a a
 

4695
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:21,750
called a mule where we we take a a a a
car and we take the engine out and we

4696
01:35:21,750 --> 01:35:21,760
car and we take the engine out and we
 

4697
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:25,910
car and we take the engine out and we
put put in a electric drive train and I

4698
01:35:25,910 --> 01:35:25,920
put put in a electric drive train and I
 

4699
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:27,470
put put in a electric drive train and I
drove it you know even the dashboards

4700
01:35:27,470 --> 01:35:27,480
drove it you know even the dashboards
 

4701
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:28,590
drove it you know even the dashboards
there's no dashboard it's just like you

4702
01:35:28,590 --> 01:35:28,600
there's no dashboard it's just like you
 

4703
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:30,149
there's no dashboard it's just like you
got you got to steering wheel and it's

4704
01:35:30,149 --> 01:35:30,159
got you got to steering wheel and it's
 

4705
01:35:30,159 --> 01:35:33,189
got you got to steering wheel and it's
just like wires and everything around

4706
01:35:33,189 --> 01:35:33,199
just like wires and everything around
 

4707
01:35:33,199 --> 01:35:35,149
just like wires and everything around
and I remember there's a street we were

4708
01:35:35,149 --> 01:35:35,159
and I remember there's a street we were
 

4709
01:35:35,159 --> 01:35:37,149
and I remember there's a street we were
on in the Bay Area called Bing Street

4710
01:35:37,149 --> 01:35:37,159
on in the Bay Area called Bing Street
 

4711
01:35:37,159 --> 01:35:40,070
on in the Bay Area called Bing Street
and I was just like no no no no traffic

4712
01:35:40,070 --> 01:35:40,080
and I was just like no no no no traffic
 

4713
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:42,149
and I was just like no no no no traffic
so I'm just going to drive this I'm the

4714
01:35:42,149 --> 01:35:42,159
so I'm just going to drive this I'm the
 

4715
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:45,830
so I'm just going to drive this I'm the
floor it and see what happens and it was

4716
01:35:45,830 --> 01:35:45,840
floor it and see what happens and it was
 

4717
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,629
floor it and see what happens and it was
it was a feeling I'd never experienced

4718
01:35:47,629 --> 01:35:47,639
it was a feeling I'd never experienced
 

4719
01:35:47,639 --> 01:35:49,390
it was a feeling I'd never experienced
before so it's not gasoline cars have an

4720
01:35:49,390 --> 01:35:49,400
before so it's not gasoline cars have an
 

4721
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:52,270
before so it's not gasoline cars have an
inertia to them so you

4722
01:35:52,270 --> 01:35:52,280
inertia to them so you
 

4723
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:54,950
inertia to them so you
yeah this is just was like being shot

4724
01:35:54,950 --> 01:35:54,960
yeah this is just was like being shot
 

4725
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:57,390
yeah this is just was like being shot
out of a cannon mhm and I okay this is

4726
01:35:57,390 --> 01:35:57,400
out of a cannon mhm and I okay this is
 

4727
01:35:57,400 --> 01:35:59,510
out of a cannon mhm and I okay this is
going to be real it's a very spaceship

4728
01:35:59,510 --> 01:35:59,520
going to be real it's a very spaceship
 

4729
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:02,149
going to be real it's a very spaceship
like feeling yeah it's like whoa it's

4730
01:36:02,149 --> 01:36:02,159
like feeling yeah it's like whoa it's
 

4731

that's that's a really good Insight I I
 

4867
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:39,030
that's that's a really good Insight I I
actually live with this concept of a

4868
01:38:39,030 --> 01:38:39,040
actually live with this concept of a
 

4869
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:41,470
actually live with this concept of a
growth mindset versus a fixed mindset

4870
01:38:41,470 --> 01:38:41,480
growth mindset versus a fixed mindset
 

4871
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:42,830
growth mindset versus a fixed mindset
and and it's a I don't know

4872
01:38:42,830 --> 01:38:42,840
and and it's a I don't know
 

4873
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:45,189
and and it's a I don't know
philosophical term where where fixed

4874
01:38:45,189 --> 01:38:45,199
philosophical term where where fixed
 

4875
01:38:45,199 --> 01:38:47,750
philosophical term where where fixed
mindset is about the destination and a

4876
01:38:47,750 --> 01:38:47,760
mindset is about the destination and a
 

4877
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:50,750
mindset is about the destination and a
growth mindset is about learning on the

4878
01:38:50,750 --> 01:38:50,760
growth mindset is about learning on the
 

4879
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:52,709
growth mindset is about learning on the
journey

4880
01:38:52,709 --> 01:38:52,719
journey
 

4881
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:56,350
journey
and I think that I'm a happier person

4882
01:38:56,350 --> 01:38:56,360
and I think that I'm a happier person
 

4883
01:38:56,360 --> 01:38:58,189
and I think that I'm a happier person

01:39:02,310 --> 01:39:02,320
approach whereas it's really frustrating
 

4889
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:04,629
approach whereas it's really frustrating
if you're always it has to be about the

01:39:04,629 --> 01:39:04,639
if you're always it has to be about the
 

4891
01:39:04,639 --> 01:39:06,669
if you're always it has to be about the
destination every time the nice thing

4892
01:39:06,669 --> 01:39:06,679
destination every time the nice thing
 

4893
01:39:06,679 --> 01:39:08,390
destination every time the nice thing
about destination at least from my

4894
01:39:08,390 --> 01:39:08,400
about destination at least from my
 

4895
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:10,270
about destination at least from my
personal perspective as like a

personal perspective as like a
 

4897
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:13,870
personal perspective as like a
programmer engineer is like it's it puts

4898
01:39:13,870 --> 01:39:13,880
programmer engineer is like it's it puts
 

4899
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:16,030
programmer engineer is like it's it puts
a little fire under you to get shit done

4900
01:39:16,030 --> 01:39:16,040
a little fire under you to get shit done
 

4901
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:17,990
a little fire under you to get shit done
like if there's a clear deadline of a

4902
01:39:17,990 --> 01:39:18,000
like if there's a clear deadline of a
 

4903
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,390
like if there's a clear deadline of a
destination you feel the aniet would say

4904
01:39:21,390 --> 01:39:21,400
destination you feel the aniet would say
 

4905
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:22,709
destination you feel the aniet would say
that I still do that but I call those

4906
01:39:22,709 --> 01:39:22,719
that I still do that but I call those
 

4907
01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:24,109
that I still do that but I call those
forcing functions instead of

4908
01:39:24,109 --> 01:39:24,119
forcing functions instead of
 

4909
01:39:24,119 --> 01:39:27,030
forcing functions instead of

4910
01:39:27,030 --> 01:39:27,040
destinations sure because you're just
 

4911
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:30,070
destinations sure because you're just

01:39:36,830 --> 01:39:36,840
times there's a reason I mean this 20th
 

4919
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:38,109

out we have a reason is we didn't make
 

4923
01:39:40,159 --> 01:39:42,830
out we have a reason is we didn't make
this up out of thin air um and so you

4924
01:39:42,830 --> 01:39:42,840
this up out of thin air um and so you
 

4925
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:45,870
this up out of thin air um and so you
yeah that does push you but just because

yeah that does push you but just because
 

4927
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:47,629
yeah that does push you but just because
we have the cookbook doesn't mean it's a

01:39:47,629 --> 01:39:47,639
we have the cookbook doesn't mean it's a
 

4929
01:39:47,639 --> 01:39:50,669
we have the cookbook doesn't mean it's a

on the journey speaking of Journeys I
 

4935
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:55,990

Humanity on seriously that is pokot in a
journey that is incredible um it's an

4942
01:40:04,470 --> 01:40:04,480
journey that is incredible um it's an
 

4943
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:06,510
journey that is incredible um it's an
interesting moment in the history of

4944
01:40:06,510 --> 01:40:06,520
interesting moment in the history of
 

4945
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:09,149
interesting moment in the history of
humanity that perhaps hopefully will

4946
01:40:09,149 --> 01:40:09,159
humanity that perhaps hopefully will
 

4947
01:40:09,159 --> 01:40:12,950
humanity that perhaps hopefully will
become a multiplanetary species uh but

4948
01:40:12,950 --> 01:40:12,960
become a multiplanetary species uh but
 

4949
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:15,350
become a multiplanetary species uh but

the hardest times in SpaceX
 

4967
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:40,350
the hardest times in SpaceX
was uh we were in the mid Pacific in

the rocket world that money goes away

4974
01:40:47,709 --> 01:40:47,719
the rocket world that money goes away
 

4975
01:40:47,719 --> 01:40:50,390
the rocket world that money goes away
really quickly and we're in this

4976
01:40:50,390 --> 01:40:50,400
really quickly and we're in this
 

4977
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:51,470
really quickly and we're in this
military base

4978

qualin and uh I think it was the second
rocket that blew up I'm not sure

4984
01:40:59,750 --> 01:40:59,760
rocket that blew up I'm not sure
 

4985
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:02,830
rocket that blew up I'm not sure
but uh we didn't have infinite resources

4986
01:41:02,830 --> 01:41:02,840
but uh we didn't have infinite resources
 

4987
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:04,189
but uh we didn't have infinite resources
I certainly didn't have the resources I

4988
01:41:04,189 --> 01:41:04,199
I certainly didn't have the resources I
 

4989

support but the um the so so every every
 

4993
01:41:09,679 --> 01:41:12,910
support but the um the so so every every
rocket launch was like to or die and the

4994
01:41:12,910 --> 01:41:12,920
rocket launch was like to or die and the
 

4995
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:16,750
rocket launch was like to or die and the
first one had blown up and so the second
