and this is a thing that makes me sad
about alien life why it's why we have to

about alien life why it's why we have to
 

17
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,990
about alien life why it's why we have to
create alien life in the lab as quickly

create alien life in the lab as quickly
 

19
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,870

Cronin so your big assembly Theory paper

64
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:18,040
Cronin so your big assembly Theory paper
 

65
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,990
Cronin so your big assembly Theory paper
was published in nature congratulations

66
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:21,000
was published in nature congratulations
 

67
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,550
was published in nature congratulations
thanks it created uh I think it's fair

68
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:23,560
thanks it created uh I think it's fair
 

69
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,270
thanks it created uh I think it's fair
to say a lot of controversy but also a

70
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:26,280
to say a lot of controversy but also a
 

71
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,550
to say a lot of controversy but also a
lot of interesting discussion so maybe I

72
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:29,560
lot of interesting discussion so maybe I
 

73
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,230
lot of interesting discussion so maybe I
can try to summarize assembly Theory and

74
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:31,240
can try to summarize assembly Theory and
 

75
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,830
can try to summarize assembly Theory and
you tell me if I'm wrong okay for it so

76
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:33,840
you tell me if I'm wrong okay for it so
 

77
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,109
you tell me if I'm wrong okay for it so
assembly Theory says that if we look at

78
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:37,119
assembly Theory says that if we look at
 

79
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,550
assembly Theory says that if we look at
any object in the universe any object

80
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:40,560
any object in the universe any object
 

81
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,870
any object in the universe any object
that we can quantify how complex it is

82
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:42,880
that we can quantify how complex it is
 

83
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,630
that we can quantify how complex it is
by trying to find the number of steps it

84
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:44,640
by trying to find the number of steps it
 

85
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,870
by trying to find the number of steps it
took to create it and also we can

86
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:47,880
took to create it and also we can
 

87
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,709
took to create it and also we can
determine if it was built by a process

88
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:50,719
determine if it was built by a process
 

89
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,950
determine if it was built by a process
akin to evolution by looking at how many

copies of the object there are yep

92
00:01:55,389 --> 00:01:55,399

00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:58,270
copies of the object there are yep
that's spot on y spot on spot on I was

94
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:58,280
that's spot on y spot on spot on I was
 

95
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,510
that's spot on y spot on spot on I was
not expecting that okay so let's go

96
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:00,520
not expecting that okay so let's go
 

97
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,069
not expecting that okay so let's go
through

00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:02,079
through
 

99
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,910
through
definitions so there's a central

100
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:03,920
definitions so there's a central
 

101
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,950
definitions so there's a central
equation I'd love to uh talk about but

102
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:06,960
equation I'd love to uh talk about but
 

103
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,589
equation I'd love to uh talk about but
definition wise what is an

definition wise what is an
 

105
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:14,430
definition wise what is an

107
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,350

00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:16,360
I'm going to try to be as meticulous as
 

109
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,470
I'm going to try to be as meticulous as
possible objects need to be

110
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:19,480
possible objects need to be
 

111
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,190
possible objects need to be
finite um and they need to be

112
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:22,200
finite um and they need to be
 

113
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,990
finite um and they need to be
decomposable into

114
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:25,000
decomposable into
 

115
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,030

118
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:31,080
objects um is a Planet an object
 

119
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,750
objects um is a Planet an object
probably yes in the if you scale out so

120
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:33,760
probably yes in the if you scale out so
 

121
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,670
probably yes in the if you scale out so
an object is finite and countable and

122
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:36,680
an object is finite and countable and
 

123
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,350
an object is finite and countable and
decomposable um I suppose mathematically

124
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,360
decomposable um I suppose mathematically
 

125
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,790
decomposable um I suppose mathematically
but yeah I still I still wake up some

126
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:41,800
but yeah I still I still wake up some
 

127
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,910
but yeah I still I still wake up some
days and go to think to myself what is

128
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:44,920
days and go to think to myself what is
 

129
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,030
days and go to think to myself what is
an object because it's it's it's a

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,509

objects it's kind of cool right so okay
so what finds the object is it's history

164
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:32,879
so what finds the object is it's history
 

165
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,350
so what finds the object is it's history
or memory whichever is the sexier word

166
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:36,360
or memory whichever is the sexier word
 

167
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,630
or memory whichever is the sexier word
I'm happy with both depending on the day

168
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
I'm happy with both depending on the day
 

169
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,070
I'm happy with both depending on the day
okay so the set of steps it took to

170
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:41,080
okay so the set of steps it took to
 

171
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,429
okay so the set of steps it took to
create the object so there's a

172
00:03:44,429 --> 00:03:44,439
create the object so there's a
 

173
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:46,670
create the object so there's a
sense in which every object in the

174
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:46,680
sense in which every object in the
 

175
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,869
sense in which every object in the
universe has a history Y and that is

176
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:50,879
universe has a history Y and that is
 

177
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,750
universe has a history Y and that is
part of the thing that is used to

178
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:52,760
part of the thing that is used to
 

179
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,429
part of the thing that is used to
describe its complexity how complicated

180
00:03:55,429 --> 00:03:55,439
describe its complexity how complicated
 

181
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,149
describe its complexity how complicated
it is okay what is an assembly index so

182
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:00,159
it is okay what is an assembly index so
 

183
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,949
it is okay what is an assembly index so
the assembly index if you to take the

184
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:02,959
the assembly index if you to take the
 

185
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,990
the assembly index if you to take the
object apart and be super lazy about it

186
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:07,000
object apart and be super lazy about it
 

187
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,229
object apart and be super lazy about it
or minimal say what it because you know

188
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:09,239
or minimal say what it because you know
 

189
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:10,710
or minimal say what it because you know
it's like you've got a really short-term

190
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:10,720
it's like you've got a really short-term
 

191
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,830
it's like you've got a really short-term
memory so what you do is you lay all the

192
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:12,840
memory so what you do is you lay all the
 

193
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,069
memory so what you do is you lay all the
parts on the path and you find the

194
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:16,079
parts on the path and you find the
 

195
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,670
parts on the path and you find the
minimum um number of steps you take on

196
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:18,680
minimum um number of steps you take on
 

197
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,749
minimum um number of steps you take on
the path to add the parts together to to

198
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:21,759
the path to add the parts together to to
 

199
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,030
the path to add the parts together to to
to reproduce the object and that minimum

200
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,040
to reproduce the object and that minimum
 

201
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,550
to reproduce the object and that minimum
number is the assembly index is a

202
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:26,560
number is the assembly index is a
 

203
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,550
number is the assembly index is a
minimum bound and it was always my

204
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:28,560
minimum bound and it was always my
 

205
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,189
minimum bound and it was always my
intuition the minimum bound an assembly

206
00:04:30,189 --> 00:04:30,199
intuition the minimum bound an assembly
 

207
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,550
intuition the minimum bound an assembly
theory was really important and I only

208
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:31,560
theory was really important and I only
 

209
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,990
theory was really important and I only
worked out why a few weeks ago which is

210
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:33,000
worked out why a few weeks ago which is
 

211
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,670
worked out why a few weeks ago which is
kind of funny because I was just like no

212
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:34,680
kind of funny because I was just like no
 

213
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,670
kind of funny because I was just like no
this is Sacra sank I don't know why it

214
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:36,680
this is Sacra sank I don't know why it
 

215
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,070
this is Sacra sank I don't know why it
will come to me one day and then when I

216
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,080
will come to me one day and then when I
 

217
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,710
will come to me one day and then when I
was pushed by a bunch of

218
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:39,720
was pushed by a bunch of
 

219
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,870
was pushed by a bunch of
mathematicians um we we we came up with

220
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:42,880
mathematicians um we we we came up with
 

221
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,629
mathematicians um we we we came up with
the the correct physical explanation

222
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
the the correct physical explanation
 

223
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,150
the the correct physical explanation
which I can get to but it's the minimum

224
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,160
which I can get to but it's the minimum
 

225
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,510
which I can get to but it's the minimum
and it's really important it's the

226
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:49,520
and it's really important it's the
 

227
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,909
and it's really important it's the
minimum and the reason I knew the

228
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:51,919
minimum and the reason I knew the
 

229
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,070
minimum and the reason I knew the
minimum was right is because we could

230
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:53,080
minimum was right is because we could
 

231
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,310
minimum was right is because we could
measure it so almost before this paper

232
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:55,320
measure it so almost before this paper
 

233
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,830
measure it so almost before this paper
came out we've with published papers

234
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:57,840
came out we've with published papers
 

235
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,390
came out we've with published papers
explain how you can measure the assembly

236
00:04:59,390 --> 00:04:59,400
explain how you can measure the assembly
 

237
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,430
explain how you can measure the assembly
in index of molecules okay so that's not

238
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:02,440
in index of molecules okay so that's not
 

239
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,189
in index of molecules okay so that's not
so trivial to figure out so when you

240
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:04,199
so trivial to figure out so when you
 

241
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:07,189
so trivial to figure out so when you
look at an object we can say a molecule

242
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:07,199
look at an object we can say a molecule
 

243
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,550
look at an object we can say a molecule
we can say object more generally mhm to

244
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:09,560
we can say object more generally mhm to
 

245
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,950
we can say object more generally mhm to
figure out the minimum number of steps

246
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:11,960
figure out the minimum number of steps
 

247
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,710
figure out the minimum number of steps
it takes to create that

248
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:13,720
it takes to create that
 

249
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,150
it takes to create that
object that doesn't seem like a trivial

250
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:16,160
object that doesn't seem like a trivial
 

251
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,189
object that doesn't seem like a trivial
thing to do so with molecules is it's

252
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:19,199
thing to do so with molecules is it's
 

253
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,110
thing to do so with molecules is it's
not trivial but it is possible because

254
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:22,120
not trivial but it is possible because
 

255
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,870
not trivial but it is possible because
what you can do and because I'm I'm a

256
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:24,880
what you can do and because I'm I'm a
 

257
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,230
what you can do and because I'm I'm a
chemist so I'm kind of like I see the

258
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:26,240
chemist so I'm kind of like I see the
 

259
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,070
chemist so I'm kind of like I see the
lens of the world for just chemistry um

260
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:29,080
lens of the world for just chemistry um
 

261
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,550
lens of the world for just chemistry um
um I break the molecule apart break

262
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:32,560
um I break the molecule apart break
 

263
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,749
um I break the molecule apart break
bonds and if you break up if you take a

264
00:05:34,749 --> 00:05:34,759
bonds and if you break up if you take a
 

265
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,070
bonds and if you break up if you take a
molecule and you break it all apart you

266
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,080
molecule and you break it all apart you
 

267
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,070
molecule and you break it all apart you
have a bunch of atoms and then you can

268
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,080
have a bunch of atoms and then you can
 

269
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,150
have a bunch of atoms and then you can
say okay I'm going to then Form B take

270
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:41,160
say okay I'm going to then Form B take
 

271
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,350
say okay I'm going to then Form B take
the atoms and form bonds and go up the

272
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:43,360
the atoms and form bonds and go up the
 

273
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,309
the atoms and form bonds and go up the
the chain of events to make the molecule

274
00:05:46,309 --> 00:05:46,319
the chain of events to make the molecule
 

275
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,990
the chain of events to make the molecule
and that's what made me realize take a

276
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000
and that's what made me realize take a
 

277
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,189
and that's what made me realize take a
toy example literally toy example take a

278
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:50,199
toy example literally toy example take a
 

279
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:52,510
toy example literally toy example take a
Lego object which is broken up of Lego

280
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:52,520
Lego object which is broken up of Lego
 

281
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,590
Lego object which is broken up of Lego
blocks so you could do exactly the same

282
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:54,600
blocks so you could do exactly the same
 

283
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,309
blocks so you could do exactly the same
thing in this case the Lego blocks are

284
00:05:57,309 --> 00:05:57,319
thing in this case the Lego blocks are
 

285
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:00,430
thing in this case the Lego blocks are
naturally the smallest they're the atoms

286
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:00,440
naturally the smallest they're the atoms
 

287
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,070
naturally the smallest they're the atoms
in the actual composite Lego

288
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:03,080
in the actual composite Lego
 

289
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,230
in the actual composite Lego
architecture but then if you maybe take

290
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:06,240
architecture but then if you maybe take
 

291
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,790
architecture but then if you maybe take
you know um a couple of blocks and put

292
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:08,800
you know um a couple of blocks and put
 

293
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,189
you know um a couple of blocks and put
them together in a certain way maybe

294
00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:10,199
them together in a certain way maybe
 

295
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,070
them together in a certain way maybe
they have a they offset in some way that

296
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,080
they have a they offset in some way that
 

297
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,830
they have a they offset in some way that
offset is on the memory you can use that

298
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:14,840
offset is on the memory you can use that
 

299
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,550
offset is on the memory you can use that
offset again with only a penalty of one

300
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:16,560
offset again with only a penalty of one
 

301
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,550
offset again with only a penalty of one
and you can then make a square triangle

302
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:18,560
and you can then make a square triangle
 

303
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,550
and you can then make a square triangle
and keep going and you remember those

304
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,560
and keep going and you remember those
 

305
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,150
and keep going and you remember those
motifs on the Chain so you can then leap

306
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,160
motifs on the Chain so you can then leap
 

307
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,950
motifs on the Chain so you can then leap
from the the start with all the Lego

308
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:26,960
from the the start with all the Lego
 

309
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,830
from the the start with all the Lego
blocks or atoms just laid out in front

310
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:28,840
blocks or atoms just laid out in front
 

311
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,629
blocks or atoms just laid out in front
of you and say right I'll take you you

312
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:30,639
of you and say right I'll take you you
 

313
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,909
of you and say right I'll take you you
you connect and do the least amount of

314
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:32,919
you connect and do the least amount of
 

315
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:35,870
you connect and do the least amount of
work so it's really like uh the the

316
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:35,880
work so it's really like uh the the
 

317
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,629
work so it's really like uh the the
smallest um um steps you can take on the

318
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:38,639
smallest um um steps you can take on the
 

319
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,469
smallest um um steps you can take on the
graph to make the object and so for

320
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:40,479
graph to make the object and so for
 

321
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,110
graph to make the object and so for
molecules it came relatively intuitively

322
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,120
molecules it came relatively intuitively
 

323
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,670
molecules it came relatively intuitively
and then we started to apply it to

324
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:44,680
and then we started to apply it to
 

325
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,670
and then we started to apply it to
language we've even started to apply it

326
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:46,680
language we've even started to apply it
 

327
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,430
language we've even started to apply it
to mathematical theorems but I'm so well

328
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:48,440
to mathematical theorems but I'm so well
 

329
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,350
to mathematical theorems but I'm so well
out of my depth but it looks like you

330
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:50,360
out of my depth but it looks like you
 

331
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,230
out of my depth but it looks like you
can take minimum set of axioms and then

332
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:52,240
can take minimum set of axioms and then
 

333
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,909
can take minimum set of axioms and then
start to build up kind of uh

334
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:54,919
start to build up kind of uh
 

335
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:56,990
start to build up kind of uh
mathematical architectures in the same

336
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:57,000
mathematical architectures in the same
 

337
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,909
mathematical architectures in the same
way and then the shortest path to get

338
00:06:58,909 --> 00:06:58,919
way and then the shortest path to get
 

339
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,270
way and then the shortest path to get
there is some something interesting that

340
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:00,280
there is some something interesting that
 

341
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,189
there is some something interesting that
I don't yet understand so what's the

342
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:03,199
I don't yet understand so what's the
 

343
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,150
I don't yet understand so what's the
computational complexity of figuring out

344
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:05,160
computational complexity of figuring out
 

345
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,309
computational complexity of figuring out
the shortest path in um with molecules

346
00:07:09,309 --> 00:07:09,319
the shortest path in um with molecules
 

347
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:12,670
the shortest path in um with molecules
with language with mathematical theorems

348
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:12,680
with language with mathematical theorems
 

349
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,230
with language with mathematical theorems
it seems like once you have the fully

00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:14,240
it seems like once you have the fully
 

351
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,150
it seems like once you have the fully

from the building basic building blocks

358
00:07:25,309 --> 00:07:25,319
from the building basic building blocks
 

359
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,869
from the building basic building blocks
isn't like a is that an N hard problem

360
00:07:27,869 --> 00:07:27,879
isn't like a is that an N hard problem
 

361
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,430
isn't like a is that an N hard problem
it's a hard problem it's a hard problem

362
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:29,440
it's a hard problem it's a hard problem
 

363
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,510
it's a hard problem it's a hard problem
but actually if you look at it so the

364
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:31,520
but actually if you look at it so the
 

365
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,790
but actually if you look at it so the
best way to look at it for let's take a

366
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:32,800
best way to look at it for let's take a
 

367
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,510
best way to look at it for let's take a
molecule so if the molecule has um 13

368
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:35,520
molecule so if the molecule has um 13
 

369
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,469
molecule so if the molecule has um 13
bonds first of all take 13 copies of the

370
00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:37,479
bonds first of all take 13 copies of the
 

371
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:38,749
bonds first of all take 13 copies of the
molecule and just cut all the bonds so

372
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:38,759
molecule and just cut all the bonds so
 

373
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,830
molecule and just cut all the bonds so
take cut 12 bonds and then you just put

374
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:40,840
take cut 12 bonds and then you just put
 

375
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,869
take cut 12 bonds and then you just put
them in order yeah and then that's how

376
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:42,879
them in order yeah and then that's how
 

377
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,510
them in order yeah and then that's how
it works so and you keep looking for

378
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:46,520
it works so and you keep looking for
 

379
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,390
it works so and you keep looking for
Symmetry and re or or copies so you can

380
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:49,400
Symmetry and re or or copies so you can
 

381
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,830
Symmetry and re or or copies so you can
then shorten it as you go down and that

382
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:51,840
then shorten it as you go down and that
 

383
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,550
then shorten it as you go down and that
becomes comor quite hard um for some

384
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:55,560
becomes comor quite hard um for some
 

385
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,749
becomes comor quite hard um for some
natural product

386
00:07:56,749 --> 00:07:56,759
natural product
 

387
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,309
natural product
molecules um it's comes very hard it's

388
00:07:59,309 --> 00:07:59,319
molecules um it's comes very hard it's
 

389
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:01,309
molecules um it's comes very hard it's
not impossible but we're looking at the

390
00:08:01,309 --> 00:08:01,319
not impossible but we're looking at the
 

391
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,469
not impossible but we're looking at the
bounds on that at the moment but as the

392
00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:03,479
bounds on that at the moment but as the
 

393
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:06,110
bounds on that at the moment but as the
object gets bigger it becomes really

394
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:06,120
object gets bigger it becomes really
 

395
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,710
object gets bigger it becomes really
hard and but there that's the bad news

396
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:08,720
hard and but there that's the bad news
 

397
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,990
hard and but there that's the bad news
but the good news is there are shortcuts

398
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,000
but the good news is there are shortcuts
 

399
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,029
but the good news is there are shortcuts
and we might even be able to physically

400
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:13,039
and we might even be able to physically
 

401
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,029
and we might even be able to physically
measure the complexity without

402
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:15,039
measure the complexity without
 

403
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,550
measure the complexity without
computationally calculating it which is

404
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:17,560
computationally calculating it which is
 

405
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,390
computationally calculating it which is
kind of insane wait wait how would you

406
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:19,400
kind of insane wait wait how would you
 

407
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,869
kind of insane wait wait how would you
do that well in the case of molecule um

408
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
do that well in the case of molecule um
 

409
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,550
do that well in the case of molecule um
so if you shine light on a molecule

410
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:24,560
so if you shine light on a molecule
 

411
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,270
so if you shine light on a molecule
let's take it infrared the the molecule

412
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:27,280
let's take it infrared the the molecule
 

413
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,790
let's take it infrared the the molecule
has each of the bonds absorb

414
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:29,800
has each of the bonds absorb
 

415
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,629
has each of the bonds absorb
the infrared differently in what we call

416
00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:31,639
the infrared differently in what we call
 

417
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:34,149
the infrared differently in what we call
the fingerprint region and so it's a bit

418
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:34,159
the fingerprint region and so it's a bit
 

419
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,029
the fingerprint region and so it's a bit
like a um and because it's quantized as

420
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:37,039
like a um and because it's quantized as
 

421
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,630
like a um and because it's quantized as
well you have all these discrete kind of

422
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:39,640
well you have all these discrete kind of
 

423
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,509
well you have all these discrete kind of
absorbances and my intuition after we

424
00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:42,519
absorbances and my intuition after we
 

425
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:44,070
absorbances and my intuition after we
realized we could cut molecules up in

426
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:44,080
realized we could cut molecules up in
 

427
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,630
realized we could cut molecules up in
Mass Spec that was the first go at this

428
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:46,640
Mass Spec that was the first go at this
 

429
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,190
Mass Spec that was the first go at this
we did it with using infrared and the

430
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:48,200
we did it with using infrared and the
 

431
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,070
we did it with using infrared and the
infrared gave us an even better

432
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,080
infrared gave us an even better
 

433
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,190
infrared gave us an even better
correlation assembly index and we used

434
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:52,200
correlation assembly index and we used
 

435
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,710
correlation assembly index and we used
another technique as well in addition to

436
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
another technique as well in addition to
 

437
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,829
another technique as well in addition to
infrared called NMR nuclear magnetic

438
00:08:56,829 --> 00:08:56,839
infrared called NMR nuclear magnetic
 

439
00:08:56,839 --> 00:08:58,470
infrared called NMR nuclear magnetic
resonance which tells you about the

440
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:58,480
resonance which tells you about the
 

441
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,990
resonance which tells you about the
number of different gentic environments

442
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,000
number of different gentic environments
 

443
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,230
number of different gentic environments
in a molecule and that also worked out

444
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,240
in a molecule and that also worked out
 

445
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,590
in a molecule and that also worked out
so we have three techniques which each

446
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:04,600
so we have three techniques which each
 

447
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,030
so we have three techniques which each
of them independently gives us the same

448
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:08,040
of them independently gives us the same
 

449
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,710
of them independently gives us the same
or tending towards the same assembly

450
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:09,720
or tending towards the same assembly
 

451
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,590
or tending towards the same assembly
index for molecule that we can calculate

452
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:11,600
index for molecule that we can calculate
 

453
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,670
index for molecule that we can calculate
mathematically okay so these are all

454
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:13,680
mathematically okay so these are all
 

455
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,190
mathematically okay so these are all
methods of mass spectrometry mass spec

456
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
methods of mass spectrometry mass spec
 

457
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,190
methods of mass spectrometry mass spec
you scan a molecule it gives you data in

458
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:20,200
you scan a molecule it gives you data in
 

459
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,230
you scan a molecule it gives you data in
the form of a Mass Spectrum and you're

460
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:22,240
the form of a Mass Spectrum and you're
 

461
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,069
the form of a Mass Spectrum and you're
saying that uh the data correlates to

462
00:09:24,069 --> 00:09:24,079
saying that uh the data correlates to
 

463
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:26,870
saying that uh the data correlates to
the assembly index yeah so how

464
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:26,880
the assembly index yeah so how
 

465
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,630
the assembly index yeah so how
generalizable is that shortcut first of

466
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:28,640
generalizable is that shortcut first of
 

467
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,750
generalizable is that shortcut first of
all to chemistry and second of all

468
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:30,760
all to chemistry and second of all
 

469
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,430
all to chemistry and second of all
beyond that cuz that seems like a nice

470
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:34,440
beyond that cuz that seems like a nice
 

471
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,949
beyond that cuz that seems like a nice
hack and you're extremely knowledgeable

472
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959
hack and you're extremely knowledgeable
 

473
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,350
hack and you're extremely knowledgeable
about various aspects of chemistry so

474
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:39,360
about various aspects of chemistry so
 

475
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,430
about various aspects of chemistry so
you can say okay it kind of

476
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:41,440
you can say okay it kind of
 

477
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,870
you can say okay it kind of
correlates but you know the whole idea

478
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
correlates but you know the whole idea
 

479
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,030
correlates but you know the whole idea
behind assembly Theory paper and perhaps

480
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,040
behind assembly Theory paper and perhaps
 

481
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,590
behind assembly Theory paper and perhaps
why it's so controversial is that it

482
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:50,600
why it's so controversial is that it
 

483
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,190
why it's so controversial is that it
reaches

484
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:52,200
reaches
 

485
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,430
reaches
bigger it reaches for the bigger general

486
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:55,440
bigger it reaches for the bigger general
 

487
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,350
bigger it reaches for the bigger general
theory of objects in the universe yeah

488
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:58,360
theory of objects in the universe yeah
 

489
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,190
theory of objects in the universe yeah
I'd say so I'd agree so I've started

490
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,200
I'd say so I'd agree so I've started
 

491
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,030
I'd say so I'd agree so I've started
assembly theory of emoticons with my lab

492
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:04,040
assembly theory of emoticons with my lab
 

493
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,310
assembly theory of emoticons with my lab
believe it or not so we take emojis yeah

494
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:06,320
believe it or not so we take emojis yeah
 

495
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,150
believe it or not so we take emojis yeah
pixelate them and work out the assembly

496
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,160
pixelate them and work out the assembly
 

497
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,630
pixelate them and work out the assembly
index for emoji yeah and then work out

498
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:10,640
index for emoji yeah and then work out
 

499
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,550
index for emoji yeah and then work out
how many emojis you can make on the path

500
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:12,560
how many emojis you can make on the path
 

501
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,630
how many emojis you can make on the path
of emoji so there's the Uber emoji from

502
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:14,640
of emoji so there's the Uber emoji from
 

503
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,949
of emoji so there's the Uber emoji from
which all other emo em emojis emerge

504
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:17,959
which all other emo em emojis emerge
 

505
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:19,870
which all other emo em emojis emerge
yeah and then you can so you can then

506
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:19,880
yeah and then you can so you can then
 

507
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,750
yeah and then you can so you can then
take a photograph and by looking at the

508
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:21,760
take a photograph and by looking at the
 

509
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,949
take a photograph and by looking at the
shortest path on or by reproducing the

510
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:24,959
shortest path on or by reproducing the
 

511
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,310
shortest path on or by reproducing the
pixels to make the image you want you

512
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:27,320
pixels to make the image you want you
 

513
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,750
pixels to make the image you want you
can measure that so then you start to be

514
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:29,760
can measure that so then you start to be
 

515
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,750
can measure that so then you start to be
able to take um spatial data now there's

516
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:32,760
able to take um spatial data now there's
 

517
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,630
able to take um spatial data now there's
some problems there what is then the

518
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:34,640
some problems there what is then the
 

519
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,990
some problems there what is then the
definition of the object how many pixels

520
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,000
definition of the object how many pixels
 

521
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,230
definition of the object how many pixels
um how do you break it down and so we're

522
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:40,240
um how do you break it down and so we're
 

523
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,910
um how do you break it down and so we're
just learning all this right now so how

524
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:42,920
just learning all this right now so how
 

525
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,670
just learning all this right now so how
do you compute the how do you begin to

526
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:45,680
do you compute the how do you begin to
 

527
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,710
do you compute the how do you begin to
compute the assembly index of a

528
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:49,720
compute the assembly index of a
 

529
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,670
compute the assembly index of a
graphical like a set of pixels on a 2G

530
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:52,680
graphical like a set of pixels on a 2G
 

531
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,230
graphical like a set of pixels on a 2G
plane that form a thing so you would

532
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,240
plane that form a thing so you would
 

533
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,150
plane that form a thing so you would
first of all determine the resolution so

534
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:58,160
first of all determine the resolution so
 

535
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,829
first of all determine the resolution so
then sure how how what is your XY what

536
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:00,839
then sure how how what is your XY what
 

537
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,110
then sure how how what is your XY what
the number on the X and Y plane and then

538
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,120
the number on the X and Y plane and then
 

539
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,990
the number on the X and Y plane and then
look at the surface area and then you

540
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:05,000
look at the surface area and then you
 

541
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,190
look at the surface area and then you
take all your emojis and make sure

542
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:06,200
take all your emojis and make sure
 

543
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,350
take all your emojis and make sure
they're all looked at the same

544
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:07,360
they're all looked at the same
 

545
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,069
they're all looked at the same
resolution yes and then we will

546
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:09,079
resolution yes and then we will
 

547
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:12,350
resolution yes and then we will
basically then um do the exactly the

548
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:12,360
basically then um do the exactly the
 

549
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,629
basically then um do the exactly the
same thing we would do for cutting the

550
00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:14,639
same thing we would do for cutting the
 

551
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:17,389
same thing we would do for cutting the
bonds you'd cut bits out of the Emoji on

552
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:17,399
bonds you'd cut bits out of the Emoji on
 

553
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:19,389
bonds you'd cut bits out of the Emoji on
and look at the the you'd have a bag of

554
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:19,399
and look at the the you'd have a bag of
 

555
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:22,590
and look at the the you'd have a bag of
pixels so um and you would then add

556
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:22,600
pixels so um and you would then add
 

557
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,790
pixels so um and you would then add
those pixels together to make the

558
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:24,800
those pixels together to make the
 

559
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,750
those pixels together to make the
overall emoji wait wait a but like first

560
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:27,760
overall emoji wait wait a but like first
 

561
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,550
overall emoji wait wait a but like first
of all not every pixel

562
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:29,560
of all not every pixel
 

563
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,069
of all not every pixel
pix's I mean this is at the core sort of

564
00:11:33,069 --> 00:11:33,079
pix's I mean this is at the core sort of
 

565
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:35,190
pix's I mean this is at the core sort of
machine learning and computer vision not

566
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:35,200
machine learning and computer vision not
 

567
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,990
machine learning and computer vision not
every pixel is that important and

568
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:37,000
every pixel is that important and
 

569
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,470
every pixel is that important and
there's like macro features there's

570
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:38,480
there's like macro features there's
 

571
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,069
there's like macro features there's
micro features and all that kind of

572
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:40,079
micro features and all that kind of
 

573
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,629
micro features and all that kind of
stuff exactly what like uh you know the

574
00:11:42,629 --> 00:11:42,639
stuff exactly what like uh you know the
 

575
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:45,670
stuff exactly what like uh you know the
eyes appear in A lot of them the smile

576
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:45,680
eyes appear in A lot of them the smile
 

577
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,910
eyes appear in A lot of them the smile
appears in a lot of them so in the same

578
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:47,920
appears in a lot of them so in the same
 

579
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,750
appears in a lot of them so in the same
way in chemistry we assume the bond is

580
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:49,760
way in chemistry we assume the bond is
 

581
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,750
way in chemistry we assume the bond is
fundamental what we do in there here is

582
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:51,760
fundamental what we do in there here is
 

583
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,030
fundamental what we do in there here is
we assume the resolution at the scale of

584
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:54,040
we assume the resolution at the scale of
 

585
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,829
we assume the resolution at the scale of
which we do it is fundamental and we're

586
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:55,839
which we do it is fundamental and we're
 

587
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:56,990
which we do it is fundamental and we're
just working that out and that you're

588
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:57,000
just working that out and that you're
 

589
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,590
just working that out and that you're
right that will change right because as

590
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:58,600
right that will change right because as
 

591
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,629
right that will change right because as
you take your lens out a bit you it will

592
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:00,639
you take your lens out a bit you it will
 

593
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,670
you take your lens out a bit you it will
change dramatically but it but it's just

594
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:03,680
change dramatically but it but it's just
 

595
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,910
change dramatically but it but it's just
a new way of looking at not just

596
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:05,920
a new way of looking at not just
 

597
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,670
a new way of looking at not just
compression what we do right now in

598
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:07,680
compression what we do right now in
 

599
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,310
compression what we do right now in
computer science and data one big kind

600
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:10,320
computer science and data one big kind
 

601
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,069
computer science and data one big kind
of um uh um kind of misunder

602
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:15,079
of um uh um kind of misunder
 

603
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:16,310
of um uh um kind of misunder
understanding as assembly theory is

604
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:16,320
understanding as assembly theory is
 

605
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,629
understanding as assembly theory is
telling you about how compressed the

606
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:17,639
telling you about how compressed the
 

607
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:21,470
telling you about how compressed the
object is that's not right it's a how

608
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:21,480
object is that's not right it's a how
 

609
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,269
object is that's not right it's a how
much information is required on a chain

610
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:24,279
much information is required on a chain
 

611
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:26,829
much information is required on a chain
of events because the nice thing is if

612
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:26,839
of events because the nice thing is if
 

613
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:28,949
of events because the nice thing is if
you when you do compression in computers

614
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:28,959
you when you do compression in computers
 

615
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,509
you when you do compression in computers
science we're wandering a bit here but

616
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:30,519
science we're wandering a bit here but
 

617
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:32,590
science we're wandering a bit here but
it's kind of worth wandering I think in

618
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:32,600
it's kind of worth wandering I think in
 

619
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,310
it's kind of worth wandering I think in
you you um assume you have instantaneous

620
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:35,320
you you um assume you have instantaneous
 

621
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,670
you you um assume you have instantaneous
access to all the information in the

622
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:36,680
access to all the information in the
 

623
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,030
access to all the information in the
memory yeah assembly Theory you say no

624
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,040
memory yeah assembly Theory you say no
 

625
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,269
memory yeah assembly Theory you say no
you don't get access to that memory

626
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:40,279
you don't get access to that memory
 

627
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:41,750
you don't get access to that memory
until you've done the work and then

628
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:41,760
until you've done the work and then
 

629
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,990
until you've done the work and then
you've done access to that memory you

630
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:43,000
you've done access to that memory you
 

631
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,110
you've done access to that memory you
can have access but not to the next one

632
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,120
can have access but not to the next one
 

633
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,710
can have access but not to the next one
and this is how in assembly Theory we

634
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:46,720
and this is how in assembly Theory we
 

635
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,790
and this is how in assembly Theory we
talk about the four universes the

636
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:48,800
talk about the four universes the
 

637
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,629
talk about the four universes the
assembly Universe the assembly possible

638
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:51,639
assembly Universe the assembly possible
 

639
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:53,470
assembly Universe the assembly possible
and the assembly contingent and then the

640
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:53,480
and the assembly contingent and then the
 

641
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,350
and the assembly contingent and then the
assembly observed and they're all all

642
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:56,360
assembly observed and they're all all
 

643
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,949
assembly observed and they're all all
scales in this combinatorial universe

644
00:12:58,949 --> 00:12:58,959
scales in this combinatorial universe
 

645
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,870
scales in this combinatorial universe
yeah can you explain each one of them

646
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:00,880
yeah can you explain each one of them
 

647
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,670
yeah can you explain each one of them
yep so the assembly universe is like

648
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:02,680
yep so the assembly universe is like
 

649
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,710
yep so the assembly universe is like
anything goes just this just coment toal

650
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:05,720
anything goes just this just coment toal
 

651
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,389
anything goes just this just coment toal
kind of explosion in everything so

652
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:07,399
kind of explosion in everything so
 

653
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:08,470
kind of explosion in everything so
that's the biggest one that's the

654
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:08,480
that's the biggest one that's the
 

655
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,230
that's the biggest one that's the
biggest one it's massive assembly

656
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:10,240
biggest one it's massive assembly
 

657
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,150
biggest one it's massive assembly
Universe assembly possible assembly

658
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:13,160
Universe assembly possible assembly
 

659
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,470
Universe assembly possible assembly
contingent assembly observed and uh on

660
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:17,480
contingent assembly observed and uh on
 

661
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,670
contingent assembly observed and uh on
the y axis is assembly steps and time

662
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:20,680
the y axis is assembly steps and time
 

663
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,990
the y axis is assembly steps and time
yeah and you know in the x-axis as as

664
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:24,000
yeah and you know in the x-axis as as
 

665
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,230
yeah and you know in the x-axis as as
the thing expands Through Time more and

666
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:27,240
the thing expands Through Time more and
 

667
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,389
the thing expands Through Time more and
more unique objects appear

668
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:29,399
more unique objects appear
 

669
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:31,710
more unique objects appear
so yeah so assembly universe everything

670
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:31,720
so yeah so assembly universe everything
 

671
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,509
so yeah so assembly universe everything
goes y um assembly possible laws of

672
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:34,519
goes y um assembly possible laws of
 

673
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:35,790
goes y um assembly possible laws of
physics come in in this case in

674
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:35,800
physics come in in this case in
 

675
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,430
physics come in in this case in
chemistry Bonds in assembly so that

676
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:38,440
chemistry Bonds in assembly so that
 

677
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,150
chemistry Bonds in assembly so that
means those are actually constraints I

678
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,160
means those are actually constraints I
 

679
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,790
means those are actually constraints I
guess yes and they're the only

680
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:41,800
guess yes and they're the only
 

681
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,069
guess yes and they're the only
constraints they're the constraints at

682
00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:43,079
constraints they're the constraints at
 

683
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:44,430
constraints they're the constraints at
the base the way to look at is you got

684
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:44,440
the base the way to look at is you got
 

685
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,470
the base the way to look at is you got
all your atoms they're quanti you can

686
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:46,480
all your atoms they're quanti you can
 

687
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,110
all your atoms they're quanti you can
just bung them together so then you can

688
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:48,120
just bung them together so then you can
 

689
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,350
just bung them together so then you can
become a kind of so in the way in

690
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:50,360
become a kind of so in the way in
 

691
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,870
become a kind of so in the way in
computer science speak I suppose the

692
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:51,880
computer science speak I suppose the
 

693
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,430
computer science speak I suppose the
assembly universe is just like no laws

694
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:53,440
assembly universe is just like no laws
 

695
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,710
assembly universe is just like no laws
of physics things can fly through

696
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:55,720
of physics things can fly through
 

697
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,310
of physics things can fly through
mountains beyond the speed of light in

698
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:58,320
mountains beyond the speed of light in
 

699
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,949
mountains beyond the speed of light in
in the assembly possible you have to

700
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:00,959
in the assembly possible you have to
 

701
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,670
in the assembly possible you have to
apply the laws of physics but you can

702
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:03,680
apply the laws of physics but you can
 

703
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,230
apply the laws of physics but you can
get access to all the motifs

704
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:05,240
get access to all the motifs
 

705
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,030
get access to all the motifs
instantaneously with no effort that

706
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:08,040
instantaneously with no effort that
 

707
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,629
instantaneously with no effort that
means you could make anything then the

708
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:10,639
means you could make anything then the
 

709
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,949
means you could make anything then the
assembly contingent says no you can't

710
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:12,959
assembly contingent says no you can't
 

711
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,990
assembly contingent says no you can't
have access to the highly assembled

712
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:15,000
have access to the highly assembled
 

713
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,350
have access to the highly assembled
object in the future until you've done

714
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:16,360
object in the future until you've done
 

715
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,749
object in the future until you've done
the work in the past on the causal chain

716
00:14:18,749 --> 00:14:18,759
the work in the past on the causal chain
 

717
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:22,110
the work in the past on the causal chain
and that's really the really interesting

718
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:22,120
and that's really the really interesting
 

719
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,670
and that's really the really interesting
shift where you go from assembly um

720
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:24,680
shift where you go from assembly um
 

721
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,509
shift where you go from assembly um
possible to assembly contingent that is

722
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:27,519
possible to assembly contingent that is
 

723
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,590
possible to assembly contingent that is
really the key thing in assembly theory

724
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:29,600
really the key thing in assembly theory
 

725
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,110
really the key thing in assembly theory
that says you cannot just have

726
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:31,120
that says you cannot just have
 

727
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,949
that says you cannot just have
instantaneous access to all those

728
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:32,959
instantaneous access to all those
 

729
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,430
instantaneous access to all those
memories you have to have done the work

730
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:35,440
memories you have to have done the work
 

731
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,910
memories you have to have done the work
somehow the universe has to have somehow

732
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:37,920
somehow the universe has to have somehow
 

733
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,230
somehow the universe has to have somehow
built a um a system that allows you to

734
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:42,240
built a um a system that allows you to
 

735
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,550
built a um a system that allows you to
select that path um rather than other

736
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:45,560
select that path um rather than other
 

737
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,870
select that path um rather than other
paths and then the final thing the

738
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:47,880
paths and then the final thing the
 

739
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,230
paths and then the final thing the
assembly observed is basically saying oh

740
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:51,240
assembly observed is basically saying oh
 

741
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,749
assembly observed is basically saying oh
these are the things we actually see we

742
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:52,759
these are the things we actually see we
 

743
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:56,230
these are the things we actually see we
can go backwards now and understand that

744
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:56,240
can go backwards now and understand that
 

745
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,910
can go backwards now and understand that
they have been created by this this

746
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:57,920
they have been created by this this
 

747
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,110
they have been created by this this
causal process says wait a minute so

748
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:00,120
causal process says wait a minute so
 

749
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,310
causal process says wait a minute so
when you say the universe has to

750
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:01,320
when you say the universe has to
 

751
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,670
when you say the universe has to
construct the system that does the work

752
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:04,680
construct the system that does the work
 

753
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,550
construct the system that does the work
is that like the environment that'll

754
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:06,560
is that like the environment that'll
 

755
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,069
is that like the environment that'll
that that allows for like selection yeah

756
00:15:09,069 --> 00:15:09,079
that that allows for like selection yeah
 

757
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:10,269
that that allows for like selection yeah
yeah yeah that's the thing that does The

758
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:10,279
yeah yeah that's the thing that does The
 

759
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:11,790
yeah yeah that's the thing that does The
Selection you could think about in terms

760
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:11,800
Selection you could think about in terms
 

761
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,749
Selection you could think about in terms
of a Von noyman Constructor first

762
00:15:13,749 --> 00:15:13,759
of a Von noyman Constructor first
 

763
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:17,269
of a Von noyman Constructor first
selection a ribosome uh Tesla plant

764
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:17,279
selection a ribosome uh Tesla plant
 

765
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,829
selection a ribosome uh Tesla plant
assembling Teslas you know the the

766
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:19,839
assembling Teslas you know the the
 

767
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,069
assembling Teslas you know the the
difference between the assembly Universe

768
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:22,079
difference between the assembly Universe
 

769
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,350
difference between the assembly Universe
in Tesla land and the Tesla Factory is

770
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:25,360
in Tesla land and the Tesla Factory is
 

771
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,189
in Tesla land and the Tesla Factory is
everyone says no Teslas are just easy

772
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:27,199
everyone says no Teslas are just easy
 

773
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,389
everyone says no Teslas are just easy
they just spring out you know how to

774
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:28,399
they just spring out you know how to
 

775
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,990
they just spring out you know how to
make them all a Tesla Factory you have

776
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,000
make them all a Tesla Factory you have
 

777
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,910
make them all a Tesla Factory you have
to put things in sequence and out comes

778
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:31,920
to put things in sequence and out comes
 

779
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,230
to put things in sequence and out comes
a Tesla so you're talking about the

780
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:33,240
a Tesla so you're talking about the
 

781
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,829
a Tesla so you're talking about the
factory yes this is this is really nice

782
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:35,839
factory yes this is this is really nice
 

783
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,749
factory yes this is this is really nice
super important point is that when I

784
00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:37,759
super important point is that when I
 

785
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,629
super important point is that when I
talk about the universe having a memory

786
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:39,639
talk about the universe having a memory
 

787
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,870
talk about the universe having a memory
or there's some magic it's not that it's

788
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:41,880
or there's some magic it's not that it's
 

789
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,990
or there's some magic it's not that it's
that tells you that there must be a

790
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:45,000
that tells you that there must be a
 

791
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,990
that tells you that there must be a
process encoded somewhere in physical

792
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,000
process encoded somewhere in physical
 

793
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,749
process encoded somewhere in physical
reality be it a cell a Tesla Factory or

794
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:51,759
reality be it a cell a Tesla Factory or
 

795
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,189
reality be it a cell a Tesla Factory or
something else that is making that

796
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:53,199
something else that is making that
 

797
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,710
something else that is making that
object I'm not saying there's some kind

798
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:54,720
object I'm not saying there's some kind
 

799
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,629
object I'm not saying there's some kind
of woo woo memory in the universe you

800
00:15:57,629 --> 00:15:57,639
of woo woo memory in the universe you
 

801
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:59,710
of woo woo memory in the universe you
know morphic resonance or something I'm

802
00:15:59,710 --> 00:15:59,720
know morphic resonance or something I'm
 

803
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,550
know morphic resonance or something I'm
saying that there is an actual causal

804
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:03,560
saying that there is an actual causal
 

805
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,990
saying that there is an actual causal
process that is being directed

806
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,000
process that is being directed
 

807
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,430
process that is being directed
constrained in some way um so it's not

808
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:08,440
constrained in some way um so it's not
 

809
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,550
constrained in some way um so it's not
kind of uh just making everything yeah

810
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:10,560
kind of uh just making everything yeah
 

811
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,710
kind of uh just making everything yeah
but Le what's the factory they made the

812
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:15,720

 

813
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,749

factory so what what is the so first of

814
00:16:18,749 --> 00:16:18,759
factory so what what is the so first of
 

815
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:21,350
factory so what what is the so first of
all you assume the laws of physics is uh

816
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:21,360
all you assume the laws of physics is uh
 

817
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,990
all you assume the laws of physics is uh
just sprung to the existence at the

818
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,000
just sprung to the existence at the
 

819
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,550
just sprung to the existence at the
beginning those are constraints but what

820
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:26,560
beginning those are constraints but what
 

821
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,629
beginning those are constraints but what
what makes the factory is the

822
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:27,639
what makes the factory is the
 

823
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:29,470
what makes the factory is the
environment that doesn't selection this

824
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:29,480
environment that doesn't selection this
 

825
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,150
environment that doesn't selection this
is the question of well it's the first

826
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:32,160
is the question of well it's the first
 

827
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,829
is the question of well it's the first
interesting question that I want to

828
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:33,839
interesting question that I want to
 

829
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,389
interesting question that I want to
answer out of four I think the factory

830
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:37,399
answer out of four I think the factory
 

831
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:39,350
answer out of four I think the factory
emerges in the envir the interplay

832
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:39,360
emerges in the envir the interplay
 

833
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,949
emerges in the envir the interplay
between the environment and the objects

834
00:16:41,949 --> 00:16:41,959
between the environment and the objects
 

835
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,389
between the environment and the objects
that are being built and and here let me

836
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:45,399
that are being built and and here let me
 

837
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:47,030
that are being built and and here let me
I'll have a go explain to you the the

838
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,040
I'll have a go explain to you the the
 

839
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,269
I'll have a go explain to you the the
shortest path so why is the shortest

840
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:49,279
shortest path so why is the shortest
 

841
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,269
shortest path so why is the shortest
path important imagine you've got um I'm

842
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:52,279
path important imagine you've got um I'm
 

843
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,590
path important imagine you've got um I'm
going to have to go chemistry for a

844
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:53,600
going to have to go chemistry for a
 

845
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,990
going to have to go chemistry for a
moment then abstract it um so imagine

846
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,000
moment then abstract it um so imagine
 

847
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,550
moment then abstract it um so imagine
you've got an envir a given environment

848
00:16:59,550 --> 00:16:59,560
you've got an envir a given environment
 

849
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,910
you've got an envir a given environment
that um that you have a budget of atoms

850
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:01,920
that um that you have a budget of atoms
 

851
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,949
that um that you have a budget of atoms
you're just flinging together yep and

852
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:04,959
you're just flinging together yep and
 

853
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,150
you're just flinging together yep and
the the objective of those atoms that

854
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:07,160
the the objective of those atoms that
 

855
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,069
the the objective of those atoms that
being flung together in say molecule a

856
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:10,079
being flung together in say molecule a
 

857
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,750
being flung together in say molecule a
um have to make they have they decompose

858
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:12,760
um have to make they have they decompose
 

859
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,829
um have to make they have they decompose
so molecules decompose over time so the

860
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:15,839
so molecules decompose over time so the
 

861
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,390
so molecules decompose over time so the
molecules um in this environment in this

862
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:18,400
molecules um in this environment in this
 

863
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,150
molecules um in this environment in this
magic environment have to not die but

864
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:21,160
magic environment have to not die but
 

865
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,590
magic environment have to not die but
they do die there's a there's a they

866
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:22,600
they do die there's a there's a they
 

867
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,390
they do die there's a there's a they
have a halflife so the only way the

868
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:24,400
have a halflife so the only way the
 

869
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,750
have a halflife so the only way the
molecules can get through that

870
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:25,760
molecules can get through that
 

871
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,110
molecules can get through that
environment out the other side let

872
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:27,120
environment out the other side let
 

873
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,750
environment out the other side let
pretend the environment is a box go in

874
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:28,760
pretend the environment is a box go in
 

875
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,590
pretend the environment is a box go in
and out without dying and there's a

876
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:31,600
and out without dying and there's a
 

877
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,310
and out without dying and there's a
there's just an infinite supply of atoms

878
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:33,320
there's just an infinite supply of atoms
 

879
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,950
there's just an infinite supply of atoms
coming or well a large

880
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:35,960
coming or well a large
 

881
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,470
coming or well a large
Supply the the molecule gets built but

882
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:39,480
Supply the the molecule gets built but
 

883
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,870
Supply the the molecule gets built but
the molecule that is able to template

884
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:41,880
the molecule that is able to template
 

885
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,990
the molecule that is able to template
itself being built um and survives in

886
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:45,000
itself being built um and survives in
 

887
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,909
itself being built um and survives in
the environment will will basically re

888
00:17:48,909 --> 00:17:48,919
the environment will will basically re
 

889
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:51,549
the environment will will basically re
Supreme now let's say that molecule

890
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:51,559
Supreme now let's say that molecule
 

891
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:52,750
Supreme now let's say that molecule
takes 10

892
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:52,760
takes 10
 

893
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,950
takes 10
steps now and it and it's using a finite

894
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:55,960
steps now and it and it's using a finite
 

895
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,430
steps now and it and it's using a finite
set of atoms right or now let's say

896
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:58,440
set of atoms right or now let's say
 

897
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,110
set of atoms right or now let's say
another molecule smart ass molecule we

898
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:00,120
another molecule smart ass molecule we
 

899
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,070
another molecule smart ass molecule we
call it comes in yeah and can survive in

900
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:03,080
call it comes in yeah and can survive in
 

901
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,149
call it comes in yeah and can survive in
that

902
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:04,159
that
 

903
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,029
that
environment and can copy itself but it

904
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:07,039
environment and can copy itself but it
 

905
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,549
environment and can copy itself but it
only needs five

906
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:08,559
only needs five
 

907
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,750
only needs five
steps the molecule that only needs five

908
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:10,760
steps the molecule that only needs five
 

909
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,430
steps the molecule that only needs five
steps because it's Contin both molecules

910
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:12,440
steps because it's Contin both molecules
 

911
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,870
steps because it's Contin both molecules
are being destroyed but they're creating

912
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:13,880
are being destroyed but they're creating
 

913
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,310
are being destroyed but they're creating
themselves faster they can be destroyed

914
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:16,320
themselves faster they can be destroyed
 

915
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,230
themselves faster they can be destroyed
you can see that the shortest path

916
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:19,240
you can see that the shortest path
 

917
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,669
you can see that the shortest path
Reigns Supreme so the shortest path

918
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:21,679
Reigns Supreme so the shortest path
 

919
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,149
Reigns Supreme so the shortest path
tells us something super interesting

920
00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:23,159
tells us something super interesting
 

921
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:25,470
tells us something super interesting
about the minimal amount of uh

922
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:25,480
about the minimal amount of uh
 

923
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,870
about the minimal amount of uh
information required to propagate that

924
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:27,880
information required to propagate that
 

925
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,669
information required to propagate that
motif in time and space um and it's just

926
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:31,679
motif in time and space um and it's just
 

927
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,590
motif in time and space um and it's just
like a kind of it seems to be like some

928
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:33,600
like a kind of it seems to be like some
 

929
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,390
like a kind of it seems to be like some
kind of conservation law so one of the

930
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:36,400
kind of conservation law so one of the
 

931
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,029
kind of conservation law so one of the
intuitions you have is the propagation

932
00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:39,039
intuitions you have is the propagation
 

933
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,870
intuitions you have is the propagation
of motives in time will be done by the

934
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:41,880
of motives in time will be done by the
 

935
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,390
of motives in time will be done by the
things that can construct themselves in

936
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:44,400
things that can construct themselves in
 

937
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,470
things that can construct themselves in
the

938
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:45,480
the
 

939
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,070
the
shortest path yeah so like you can

940
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:49,080
shortest path yeah so like you can
 

941
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,510
shortest path yeah so like you can
assume that most of the objects in the

942
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:50,520
assume that most of the objects in the
 

943
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,510
assume that most of the objects in the
universe are built in the shortest in

944
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:52,520
universe are built in the shortest in
 

945
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,510
universe are built in the shortest in
the most efficient way that the so big

946
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:57,520
the most efficient way that the so big
 

947
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,190
the most efficient way that the so big
leap I just took there yeah no yeah yes

948
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:00,200
leap I just took there yeah no yeah yes
 

949
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,350
leap I just took there yeah no yeah yes
and no because there are other things so

950
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:02,360
and no because there are other things so
 

951
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,230
and no because there are other things so
in the limit yes because you want to

952
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:04,240
in the limit yes because you want to
 

953
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,830
in the limit yes because you want to
tell the difference between things that

954
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:05,840
tell the difference between things that
 

955
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,070
tell the difference between things that
have required a factory to build them

956
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:08,080
have required a factory to build them
 

957
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,950
have required a factory to build them
and just random

958
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:09,960
and just random
 

959
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,070
and just random
processes um but you can find instances

960
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,080
processes um but you can find instances
 

961
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,350
processes um but you can find instances
where the shortest path isn't taken for

962
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:16,360
where the shortest path isn't taken for
 

963
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,710
where the shortest path isn't taken for
an individual object individual function

964
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:19,720
an individual object individual function
 

965
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,149
an individual object individual function
MH um and people go ah that means the

966
00:19:23,149 --> 00:19:23,159
MH um and people go ah that means the
 

967
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:24,870
MH um and people go ah that means the
shortest path isn't right and then I say

968
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:24,880
shortest path isn't right and then I say
 

969
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,310
shortest path isn't right and then I say
well I don't know I think it's right

970
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:27,320
well I don't know I think it's right
 

971
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,789
well I don't know I think it's right
still because

972
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:28,799
still because
 

973
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,070
still because
so of course because there are other

974
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:31,080
so of course because there are other
 

975
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,470
so of course because there are other
driving forces it's not just one

976
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:32,480
driving forces it's not just one
 

977
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,830
driving forces it's not just one
molecule now when you start to now you

978
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:34,840
molecule now when you start to now you
 

979
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,549
molecule now when you start to now you
start to consider two objects you have a

980
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:36,559
start to consider two objects you have a
 

981
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,710
start to consider two objects you have a
joint assembly space and it's not now

982
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:39,720
joint assembly space and it's not now
 

983
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,149
joint assembly space and it's not now
it's a compromise between not just

984
00:19:41,149 --> 00:19:41,159
it's a compromise between not just
 

985
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:43,230
it's a compromise between not just
making a and b in the shortest path you

986
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:43,240
making a and b in the shortest path you
 

987
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,310
making a and b in the shortest path you
want to make a and be in the shortest

988
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:45,320
want to make a and be in the shortest
 

989
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,669
want to make a and be in the shortest
path which might mean that a is slightly

990
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:47,679
path which might mean that a is slightly
 

991
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,870
path which might mean that a is slightly
longer you have compromise so when you

992
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:49,880
longer you have compromise so when you
 

993
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,230
longer you have compromise so when you
see slightly more nesting in the

994
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:53,240
see slightly more nesting in the
 

995
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,230
see slightly more nesting in the
construction when you take a given

996
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:55,240
construction when you take a given
 

997
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,590
construction when you take a given
object that can look longer but that's

998
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:57,600
object that can look longer but that's
 

999
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,549
object that can look longer but that's
because the overall function is the

1000
00:19:59,549 --> 00:19:59,559
because the overall function is the
 

1001
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:01,549
because the overall function is the
object is still trying to be efficient

1002
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:01,559
object is still trying to be efficient
 

1003
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:04,549
object is still trying to be efficient
yeah and this is still very

1004
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:04,559
yeah and this is still very
 

1005
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,390
yeah and this is still very
handwavy um and maybe have no leg to

1006
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:07,400
handwavy um and maybe have no leg to
 

1007
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,870
handwavy um and maybe have no leg to
stand on but we think we're getting

1008
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:08,880
stand on but we think we're getting
 

1009
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,310
stand on but we think we're getting
somewhere with that and there's probably

1010
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,320
somewhere with that and there's probably
 

1011
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,950
somewhere with that and there's probably
some parallelization yeah right so this

1012
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:12,960
some parallelization yeah right so this
 

1013
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,950
some parallelization yeah right so this
is all this not sequential the building

1014
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:15,960
is all this not sequential the building
 

1015
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,750
is all this not sequential the building
is I guess when you're when you're

1016
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:18,760
is I guess when you're when you're
 

1017
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,630
is I guess when you're when you're
talking about complex objects you you

1018
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:20,640
talking about complex objects you you
 

1019
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,870
talking about complex objects you you
don't have to work sequentially you can

1020
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:22,880
don't have to work sequentially you can
 

1021
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,950
don't have to work sequentially you can
work in parallel you can get your

1022
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:23,960
work in parallel you can get your
 

1023
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,070
work in parallel you can get your
friends together and they can yeah these

1024
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,080
friends together and they can yeah these
 

1025
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,909
friends together and they can yeah these
and the the thing we're working on right

1026
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:27,919
and the the thing we're working on right
 

1027
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,870
and the the thing we're working on right
now is how to understand these parallel

1028
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:30,880
now is how to understand these parallel
 

1029
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,549
now is how to understand these parallel
processes now there's an in a new thing

1030
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:33,559
processes now there's an in a new thing
 

1031
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:36,230
processes now there's an in a new thing
we've introduced called assembly depth

1032
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:36,240
we've introduced called assembly depth
 

1033
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,510
we've introduced called assembly depth
and ass assembly depth can be lower than

1034
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:39,520
and ass assembly depth can be lower than
 

1035
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,470
and ass assembly depth can be lower than
the assembly index for a molecule when

1036
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:42,480
the assembly index for a molecule when
 

1037
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,310
the assembly index for a molecule when
they're cooperating together because

1038
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:44,320
they're cooperating together because
 

1039
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,110
they're cooperating together because
exactly this parallel processing is

1040
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:46,120
exactly this parallel processing is
 

1041
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,710
exactly this parallel processing is
going on and my team have been working

1042
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:48,720
going on and my team have been working
 

1043
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,270
going on and my team have been working
this out in the last few weeks because

1044
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:50,280
this out in the last few weeks because
 

1045
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,669
this out in the last few weeks because
we're looking at what compromises does

1046
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:52,679
we're looking at what compromises does
 

1047
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:54,270
we're looking at what compromises does
nature need to make when it's making

1048
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:54,280
nature need to make when it's making
 

1049
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,669
nature need to make when it's making
molecules in a cell and I I wonder if

1050
00:20:57,669 --> 00:20:57,679
molecules in a cell and I I wonder if
 

1051
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:58,750
molecules in a cell and I I wonder if
you know

1052
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:58,760
you know
 

1053
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,110
you know
I I maybe like well I'm always leaping

1054
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:01,120
I I maybe like well I'm always leaping
 

1055
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,990
I I maybe like well I'm always leaping
out of um my competence but in economics

1056
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:05,000
out of um my competence but in economics
 

1057
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,310
out of um my competence but in economics
I'm just wondering if you could apply

1058
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:06,320
I'm just wondering if you could apply
 

1059
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,870
I'm just wondering if you could apply
this in economic process it seems like

1060
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:07,880
this in economic process it seems like
 

1061
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,070
this in economic process it seems like
capitalism is very good at finding

1062
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:09,080
capitalism is very good at finding
 

1063
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,870
capitalism is very good at finding
shortest path you know every time and

1064
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:11,880
shortest path you know every time and
 

1065
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,470
shortest path you know every time and
there are ludicrous things that happen

1066
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:13,480
there are ludicrous things that happen
 

1067
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,029
there are ludicrous things that happen
because actually the cost functions been

1068
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:15,039
because actually the cost functions been
 

1069
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,669
because actually the cost functions been
minimized and so I keep seeing parallels

1070
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:17,679
minimized and so I keep seeing parallels
 

1071
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,149
minimized and so I keep seeing parallels
everywhere where there are complex

1072
00:21:19,149 --> 00:21:19,159
everywhere where there are complex
 

1073
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:21,630
everywhere where there are complex
nested systems where if you give it

1074
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:21,640
nested systems where if you give it
 

1075
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,350
nested systems where if you give it
enough time and you introduce a bit of

1076
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:24,360
enough time and you introduce a bit of
 

1077
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,350
enough time and you introduce a bit of
heterogeneity the system readjusts and

1078
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:26,360
heterogeneity the system readjusts and
 

1079
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,669
heterogeneity the system readjusts and

1080
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:28,679
finds a new shorts path but the s path
 

1081
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:30,950

isn't fixed on just one molecule now

1082
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:30,960
isn't fixed on just one molecule now
 

1083
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,510
isn't fixed on just one molecule now
it's in the actual existence of the

00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:33,520
it's in the actual existence of the
 

1085
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,590
it's in the actual existence of the
object over time and that object could

1086
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:35,600
object over time and that object could
 

1087
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,430
object over time and that object could
be a city it could be a cell it could be

1088
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:37,440
be a city it could be a cell it could be
 

1089
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,029
be a city it could be a cell it could be
a factory but I think we're going Way

1090
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:40,039
a factory but I think we're going Way
 

1091
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:42,149
a factory but I think we're going Way
Beyond molecules and and my competence

1092
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:42,159
Beyond molecules and and my competence
 

1093
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,990
Beyond molecules and and my competence
probably should go back to molecules but

1094
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:44,000
probably should go back to molecules but
 

1095
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,390
probably should go back to molecules but
hey all right before we get too far

1096
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:46,400
hey all right before we get too far
 

1097
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,950
hey all right before we get too far
let's talk about the assembly

1098
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:48,960
let's talk about the assembly
 

1099
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,750
let's talk about the assembly
equation okay how should we do this all

1100
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:51,760
equation okay how should we do this all
 

1101
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,110
equation okay how should we do this all
right let me just even read that part of

1102
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,120
right let me just even read that part of
 

1103
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:53,870
right let me just even read that part of
the

1104
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:53,880
the
 

1105
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,630
the
paper we Define assembly as the total

1106
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:56,640
paper we Define assembly as the total
 

1107
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,029
paper we Define assembly as the total

Ensemble MH and then a

1118
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:14,600
Ensemble MH and then a
 

1119
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,990
Ensemble MH and then a
sum from one to n where n is the total

1120
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,000
sum from one to n where n is the total

number of unique
 

1123
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,710
number of unique
objects and then there is a few

1124
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:21,720
objects and then there is a few
 

1125
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,590
objects and then there is a few
variables in there that include the

1126
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:23,600
variables in there that include the
 

1127
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,950
variables in there that include the
assembly

1128
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:24,960

index the copy number which we'll talk

1130
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:27,720
index the copy number which we'll talk
 

1131
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,070
index the copy number which we'll talk
about that's an interesting I don't

1132
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:29,080
about that's an interesting I don't
 

1133
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,029
about that's an interesting I don't
remember you talking about that that's

1134
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:31,039
remember you talking about that that's
 

1135
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,750
remember you talking about that that's
an interesting addition and I think a

1136
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:32,760
an interesting addition and I think a
 

1137
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,669
an interesting addition and I think a
powerful one has to do with what that

1138
00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:36,679
powerful one has to do with what that
 

1139
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:38,830
powerful one has to do with what that
you can create pretty complex objects

1140
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:38,840
you can create pretty complex objects
 

1141
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,470
you can create pretty complex objects
randomly mhm and in order to know that

1142
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:41,480
randomly mhm and in order to know that
 

1143
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,909
randomly mhm and in order to know that
they're not random that there's a

1144
00:22:42,909 --> 00:22:42,919
they're not random that there's a
 

1145
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:45,110
they're not random that there's a
factory involved you need to see a bunch

1146
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:45,120
factory involved you need to see a bunch
 

1147
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,430
factory involved you need to see a bunch
of them that's that's the intuition

1148
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:47,440
of them that's that's the intuition
 

1149
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,830
of them that's that's the intuition
there it's an interesting intuition and

1150
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:49,840
there it's an interesting intuition and
 

1151
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,830
there it's an interesting intuition and
then uh some

1152
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:51,840
then uh some
 

1153
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,750
then uh some
normalization what else is it n n minus

1154
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:54,760
normalization what else is it n n minus
 

1155
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,549
normalization what else is it n n minus
one just to make sure that um more than

1156
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:56,559
one just to make sure that um more than
 

1157
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,190
one just to make sure that um more than
one object one object could be one of

1158
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:58,200
one object one object could be one of
 

1159
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,149
one object one object could be one of
and random yep and then you have more

1160
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:00,159
and random yep and then you have more
 

1161
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,750
and random yep and then you have more
than one identical object that's

1162
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:01,760
than one identical object that's
 

1163
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,470
than one identical object that's
interesting when when there's when

1164
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:03,480
interesting when when there's when
 

1165
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,029
interesting when when there's when
there's two of a thing two of a thing is

1166
00:23:06,029 --> 00:23:06,039
there's two of a thing two of a thing is
 

1167
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:07,669
there's two of a thing two of a thing is
super important especially if the IND

1168
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:07,679
super important especially if the IND
 

1169
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,789
super important especially if the IND
index assembly index is high so uh we

1170
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:10,799
index assembly index is high so uh we
 

1171
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,990
index assembly index is high so uh we
could say several questions here one

1172
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:13,000
could say several questions here one
 

1173
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,070
could say several questions here one
let's talk about

1174
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:14,080
let's talk about
 

1175
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,710
let's talk about
selection what is this term selection

1176
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:16,720
selection what is this term selection
 

1177
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,390
selection what is this term selection
what is this term evolution that we're

1178
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:18,400
what is this term evolution that we're
 

1179
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,630
what is this term evolution that we're
referring to which which aspect of

1180
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:20,640
referring to which which aspect of
 

1181
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,990
referring to which which aspect of
darwinian evolution are we referring to

1182
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:23,000
darwinian evolution are we referring to
 

1183
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,470
darwinian evolution are we referring to
that's interesting here so yeah so this

1184
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:27,480
that's interesting here so yeah so this
 

1185
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,950
that's interesting here so yeah so this
is probably what you know the paper we

1186
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:28,960
is probably what you know the paper we
 

1187
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,070
is probably what you know the paper we
should talk about the paper for a second

1188
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:30,080
should talk about the paper for a second
 

1189
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,590
should talk about the paper for a second
the paper did what it did is it kind of

1190
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:32,600
the paper did what it did is it kind of
 

1191
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,269
the paper did what it did is it kind of
annoyed um we didn't knowy I mean it got

1192
00:23:35,269 --> 00:23:35,279
annoyed um we didn't knowy I mean it got
 

1193
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:37,669
annoyed um we didn't knowy I mean it got
intention and obviously angry people the

1194
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:37,679
intention and obviously angry people the
 

1195
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,029
intention and obviously angry people the
angry people were annoyed there's angry

1196
00:23:40,029 --> 00:23:40,039
angry people were annoyed there's angry
 

1197
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:41,750
angry people were annoyed there's angry
people in the world that's good so what

1198
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:41,760
people in the world that's good so what
 

1199
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,149
people in the world that's good so what
happened is the evolutionary biologist

1200
00:23:43,149 --> 00:23:43,159
happened is the evolutionary biologist
 

1201
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:45,350
happened is the evolutionary biologist
got angry we were not expecting that

1202
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:45,360
got angry we were not expecting that
 

1203
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,510
got angry we were not expecting that
because we thought Evolution biologies

1204
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:46,520
because we thought Evolution biologies
 

1205
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,390
because we thought Evolution biologies
would be cool I knew that some not many

1206
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:50,400
would be cool I knew that some not many
 

1207
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,310
would be cool I knew that some not many
computational complexity people will get

1208
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:52,320
computational complexity people will get
 

1209
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,310
computational complexity people will get
angry cuz i' kind of been poking them

1210
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:54,320
angry cuz i' kind of been poking them
 

1211
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,149
angry cuz i' kind of been poking them
and maybe I deserved it but I was trying

1212
00:23:56,149 --> 00:23:56,159
and maybe I deserved it but I was trying
 

1213
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,430
and maybe I deserved it but I was trying
to poke them in a productive way mhm and

1214
00:23:59,430 --> 00:23:59,440
to poke them in a productive way mhm and
 

1215
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,710
to poke them in a productive way mhm and
then the physicist kind of got grumpy

1216
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:01,720
then the physicist kind of got grumpy
 

1217
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,549
then the physicist kind of got grumpy
because the initial conditions tell

1218
00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:03,559
because the initial conditions tell
 

1219
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:05,710
because the initial conditions tell
everything the preotic chemist got

1220
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:05,720
everything the preotic chemist got
 

1221
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,190
everything the preotic chemist got
slightly grumpy because there's not

1222
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:07,200
slightly grumpy because there's not
 

1223
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,590
slightly grumpy because there's not
enough chemistry in there then finally

1224
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:08,600
enough chemistry in there then finally
 

1225
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,830
enough chemistry in there then finally
when the creationist said it wasn't

1226
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:09,840
when the creationist said it wasn't
 

1227
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,070
when the creationist said it wasn't
creationist enough I was like right I've

1228
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:12,080
creationist enough I was like right I've
 

1229
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,669
creationist enough I was like right I've
done my job the phys well you saying the

1230
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:13,679
done my job the phys well you saying the
 

1231
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:14,830
done my job the phys well you saying the
physics they

1232
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:14,840
physics they
 

1233
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,029
physics they
say because you're basically saying that

1234
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:18,039
say because you're basically saying that
 

1235
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,269
say because you're basically saying that
physics is not enough to tell the story

1236
00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:20,279
physics is not enough to tell the story
 

1237
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:23,149
physics is not enough to tell the story
of how biology emerges I think so and

1238
00:24:23,149 --> 00:24:23,159
of how biology emerges I think so and
 

1239
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:26,510
of how biology emerges I think so and
then they said a few physics is the

1240
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:26,520
then they said a few physics is the
 

1241
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,070
then they said a few physics is the
beginning and the end of the story

1242
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:29,080
beginning and the end of the story
 

1243
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,110
beginning and the end of the story
yeah so what happened is the reason why

1244
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:31,120
yeah so what happened is the reason why
 

1245
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,149
yeah so what happened is the reason why
people put the phone down on the call of

1246
00:24:33,149 --> 00:24:33,159
people put the phone down on the call of
 

1247
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:35,310
people put the phone down on the call of
the paper if you if you view reading the

1248
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:35,320
the paper if you if you view reading the
 

1249
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,870
the paper if you if you view reading the
paper like a phone call they got to the

1250
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:36,880
paper like a phone call they got to the
 

1251
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,710
paper like a phone call they got to the
abstract Y and in the abstract it's

1252
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:39,720
abstract Y and in the abstract it's
 

1253
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,389
abstract Y and in the abstract it's
first sentence is pretty first two

1254
00:24:41,389 --> 00:24:41,399
first sentence is pretty first two
 

1255
00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:43,430
first sentence is pretty first two
sentences caused everybody scientists

1256
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:43,440
sentences caused everybody scientists
 

1257
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,310
sentences caused everybody scientists
have grappled with reconciling

1258
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:45,320
have grappled with reconciling
 

1259
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,149
have grappled with reconciling
biological evolution with the immutable

1260
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:48,159
biological evolution with the immutable
 

1261

true right there's nothing wrong with

1264
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:52,919
true right there's nothing wrong with
 

1265
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:54,669
true right there's nothing wrong with
that statement totally

1266
00:24:54,669 --> 00:24:54,679
that statement totally
 

1267
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:58,190
that statement totally
true yeah these laws under pin life's

1268
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:58,200
true yeah these laws under pin life's
 

1269
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,549
true yeah these laws under pin life's

human culture and Technology yet they do
 

1273
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,470
human culture and Technology yet they do
not predict the emergence of these

humble title and and the the the
entirety of the paper I think uh

1288
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:22,799
entirety of the paper I think uh
 

1289
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,269
entirety of the paper I think uh
presents interesting ideas but reaches

00:25:28,389 --> 00:25:28,399
High I am
 

1293
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:31,230
High I am
not I would do it all again this paper

1294
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:31,240
not I would do it all again this paper
 

1295
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,789
not I would do it all again this paper
was actually on the pre-print server for

00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:35,440
over a year you regret nothing yeah I I
 

1299
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,190
over a year you regret nothing yeah I I
I think yeah I don't regret anything you

1300
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:37,200
I think yeah I don't regret anything you
 

1301
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,750
I think yeah I don't regret anything you
and Frank Sinatra did it your way what I

1302
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:39,760
and Frank Sinatra did it your way what I

love about being a scientist is kind of

1304
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:42,080
love about being a scientist is kind of
 

1305
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,950
love about being a scientist is kind of
sometimes I'm because I'm a bit dim I'm

1306
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:43,960
sometimes I'm because I'm a bit dim I'm
 

1307
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,510
sometimes I'm because I'm a bit dim I'm
like and I don't understand what people

1308
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:45,520
like and I don't understand what people
 

1309
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,590
like and I don't understand what people
telling me I want to get to the point

1310
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:47,600
telling me I want to get to the point
 

1311
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,230
telling me I want to get to the point
this paper says Hey laws of physics are

1312
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:50,240
this paper says Hey laws of physics are
 

1313
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,510
this paper says Hey laws of physics are
really cool the universe is

1314
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:52,520
really cool the universe is
 

1315
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,950
really cool the universe is
great but they don't really it's not

1316
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:56,960
great but they don't really it's not
 

1317
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,630
great but they don't really it's not
intuitive that you just run the standard

1318
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:58,640
intuitive that you just run the standard
 

1319
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,710
intuitive that you just run the standard
model and get life out I think most

1320
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:00,720
model and get life out I think most
 

1321
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,029
model and get life out I think most
physicists might go yeah there's this

1322
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:03,039
physicists might go yeah there's this
 

1323
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,110
physicists might go yeah there's this
you know it's not just we can't just go

1324
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:05,120
you know it's not just we can't just go
 

1325
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,630
you know it's not just we can't just go
back and say that's what happened

1326
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:06,640
back and say that's what happened
 

1327
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,070
back and say that's what happened
because physics can't explain the origin

1328
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,080
because physics can't explain the origin
 

1329
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,269
because physics can't explain the origin
of life yet doesn't mean it won't or

1330
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:11,279
of life yet doesn't mean it won't or
 

1331
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,710
of life yet doesn't mean it won't or
can't okay just to be clear sorry

1332
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:13,720
can't okay just to be clear sorry
 

1333
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,590
can't okay just to be clear sorry
intelligent designers we are going to

1334
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:15,600
intelligent designers we are going to
 

1335
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,669
intelligent designers we are going to
get there second point we say that

1336
00:26:18,669 --> 00:26:18,679
get there second point we say that
 

1337
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:21,149
get there second point we say that
Evolution works but we don't know how

1338
00:26:21,149 --> 00:26:21,159
Evolution works but we don't know how
 

1339
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:23,549
Evolution works but we don't know how
Evolution got going so biological

1340
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:23,559
Evolution got going so biological
 

1341
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:25,870
Evolution got going so biological
evolution and biological selection so

1342
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:25,880
evolution and biological selection so
 

1343
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,470
evolution and biological selection so
for me this seems like a simple

1344
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:28,480
for me this seems like a simple
 

1345
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,389
for me this seems like a simple
so when I mentioned selection and

1346
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:30,399
so when I mentioned selection and
 

1347
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:32,350
so when I mentioned selection and
evolution in the title I think and in

1348
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:32,360
evolution in the title I think and in
 

1349
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,590
evolution in the title I think and in
the abstract we should have maybe

1350
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:34,600
the abstract we should have maybe
 

1351
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,590
the abstract we should have maybe
prefaced that and said non-biological

1352
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:36,600
prefaced that and said non-biological
 

1353
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,110
prefaced that and said non-biological
selection and non-biological evolutions

1354
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:39,120
selection and non-biological evolutions
 

1355
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,510
selection and non-biological evolutions
and then that might have made it even

1356
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:40,520
and then that might have made it even
 

1357
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,190
and then that might have made it even
more crystal clear but I didn't think

1358
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:42,200
more crystal clear but I didn't think
 

1359
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,870
more crystal clear but I didn't think
that biology evolutionary biology should

1360
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:44,880
that biology evolutionary biology should
 

1361
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,630
that biology evolutionary biology should
be so bold to claim ownership of

1362
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:47,640
be so bold to claim ownership of
 

1363
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,310
be so bold to claim ownership of
selection and evolution and secondly a

1364
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:50,320
selection and evolution and secondly a
 

1365
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,870
selection and evolution and secondly a
lot of evolutionary biologists seem to

1366
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:51,880
lot of evolutionary biologists seem to
 

1367
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,269
lot of evolutionary biologists seem to
dismiss the origin of Life questions

1368
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:53,279
dismiss the origin of Life questions
 

1369
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,470
dismiss the origin of Life questions
just say it's obvious and and that

1370
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:55,480
just say it's obvious and and that
 

1371
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,590
just say it's obvious and and that
causes a real problem scientifically cuz

1372
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:57,600
causes a real problem scientifically cuz
 

1373
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,230
causes a real problem scientifically cuz
because when two different when the

1374
00:26:59,230 --> 00:26:59,240
because when two different when the
 

1375
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,310
because when two different when the
physicists are like we own the universe

1376
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:01,320
physicists are like we own the universe
 

1377
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,510
physicists are like we own the universe
universe is good we explain all of it

1378
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:03,520
universe is good we explain all of it
 

1379
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,470
universe is good we explain all of it
look at us and the EV biologist say we

1380
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:05,480
look at us and the EV biologist say we
 

1381
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,310
look at us and the EV biologist say we
can explain biology and the poor

1382
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:07,320
can explain biology and the poor
 

1383
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,149
can explain biology and the poor
chemistry in the in in the middle going

1384
00:27:09,149 --> 00:27:09,159
chemistry in the in in the middle going
 

1385
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:11,750
chemistry in the in in the middle going
but hang

1386
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:11,760
but hang
 

1387
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,990
but hang
on and this paper kind of says hey there

1388
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:15,000
on and this paper kind of says hey there
 

1389
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,549
on and this paper kind of says hey there
is an

1390
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:16,559
is an
 

1391
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,070
is an
interesting

1392
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:18,080
interesting
 

1393
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,029
interesting
um disconnect between physics and

1394
00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:21,039
um disconnect between physics and
 

1395
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,190
um disconnect between physics and
biology and that's at the point which

1396
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:23,200
biology and that's at the point which
 

1397
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,070
biology and that's at the point which
memories get made in chemistry through

1398
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:25,080
memories get made in chemistry through
 

1399
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,149
memories get made in chemistry through
bonds and hey let's look at this close

1400
00:27:27,149 --> 00:27:27,159
bonds and hey let's look at this close
 

1401
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,110
bonds and hey let's look at this close
and see we can quantify it so yeah I

1402
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:30,120
and see we can quantify it so yeah I
 

1403
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,950
and see we can quantify it so yeah I
mean I never expected the paper to to to

1404
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:32,960
mean I never expected the paper to to to
 

1405
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,029
mean I never expected the paper to to to
kind of get that much interest in still

1406
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:35,039
kind of get that much interest in still
 

1407
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,350
kind of get that much interest in still
I mean it's only been published just

1408
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:36,360
I mean it's only been published just
 

1409
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,630
I mean it's only been published just
over a month ago now so just to Ling on

1410
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:39,640
over a month ago now so just to Ling on
 

1411
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,669
over a month ago now so just to Ling on
the selection what is

1412
00:27:42,669 --> 00:27:42,679
the selection what is
 

1413
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:45,950
the selection what is
the broader sense of what selection

1414
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:45,960
the broader sense of what selection
 

1415
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,230
the broader sense of what selection
means yeah that's the really good for

1416
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:49,240
means yeah that's the really good for
 

1417
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,470
means yeah that's the really good for
selection selection so I think for

1418
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:52,480
selection selection so I think for
 

1419
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,029
selection selection so I think for
selection you need so this is where for

1420
00:27:54,029 --> 00:27:54,039
selection you need so this is where for
 

1421
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,590
selection you need so this is where for
me the concept of an object is something

1422
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:56,600
me the concept of an object is something
 

1423
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,830
me the concept of an object is something
that can persist in time time and and

1424
00:27:58,830 --> 00:27:58,840
that can persist in time time and and
 

1425
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,830
that can persist in time time and and
not die but basically can be broken up

1426
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:01,840
not die but basically can be broken up
 

1427
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,310
not die but basically can be broken up
mhm so so if I was going to kind of

1428
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:04,320
mhm so so if I was going to kind of
 

1429
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,750
mhm so so if I was going to kind of
bolster the definition of object so so

1430
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:06,760
bolster the definition of object so so
 

1431
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,549
bolster the definition of object so so
if if something can

1432
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:09,559
if if something can
 

1433
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:14,190
if if something can
form and persist for a uh a long period

1434
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:14,200
form and persist for a uh a long period
 

1435
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,430
form and persist for a uh a long period
of time um

1436
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:16,440
of time um
 

1437
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,389
of time um
under an existing environment that could

1438
00:28:19,389 --> 00:28:19,399
under an existing environment that could
 

1439
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:22,110
under an existing environment that could
destroy other and I'm going to use

1440
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:22,120
destroy other and I'm going to use
 

1441
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,830
destroy other and I'm going to use
anthropomorphic terms I apologize that

1442
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:23,840
anthropomorphic terms I apologize that
 

1443
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,950
anthropomorphic terms I apologize that
weaker objects um or less robust

1444
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:27,960
weaker objects um or less robust
 

1445
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,029
weaker objects um or less robust
um then the environment could have

1446
00:28:30,029 --> 00:28:30,039
um then the environment could have
 

1447
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:31,950
um then the environment could have
selected that so good chemistry examples

1448
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:31,960
selected that so good chemistry examples
 

1449
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,389
selected that so good chemistry examples
if you took some carbon and you made a

1450
00:28:34,389 --> 00:28:34,399
if you took some carbon and you made a
 

1451
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,630
if you took some carbon and you made a
chain of carbon atoms whereas if you

1452
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:37,640
chain of carbon atoms whereas if you
 

1453
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,509
chain of carbon atoms whereas if you
took some I don't know some carbon

1454
00:28:40,509 --> 00:28:40,519
took some I don't know some carbon
 

1455
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:42,509
took some I don't know some carbon
nitrogen and oxygen and made change from

1456
00:28:42,509 --> 00:28:42,519
nitrogen and oxygen and made change from
 

1457
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:44,110
nitrogen and oxygen and made change from
those you'd start to get different

1458
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:44,120
those you'd start to get different
 

1459
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,110
those you'd start to get different
reactions and rearrangements so a carb a

1460
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:47,120
reactions and rearrangements so a carb a
 

1461
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,350
reactions and rearrangements so a carb a
chain of carbon atoms might be more

1462
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:49,360
chain of carbon atoms might be more
 

1463
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,549
chain of carbon atoms might be more
resistant to falling apart uh under

1464
00:28:53,549 --> 00:28:53,559
resistant to falling apart uh under
 

1465
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:56,350
resistant to falling apart uh under
acidic or basic conditions um versus

1466
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:56,360
acidic or basic conditions um versus
 

1467
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,110
acidic or basic conditions um versus
another set of molecules so survives in

1468
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:58,120
another set of molecules so survives in
 

1469
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,549
another set of molecules so survives in
that environment so the acid Pond the

1470
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:00,559
that environment so the acid Pond the
 

1471
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,549
that environment so the acid Pond the
molecule the the molecu the resistant

1472
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:02,559
molecule the the molecu the resistant
 

1473
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,190
molecule the the molecu the resistant
molecule can get through and and then

1474
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:06,200
molecule can get through and and then
 

1475
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,710
molecule can get through and and then
then that molecule goes into another

1476
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:07,720
then that molecule goes into another
 

1477
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,149
then that molecule goes into another
environment so that environment now

1478
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:10,159
environment so that environment now
 

1479
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,350
environment so that environment now
maybe being an acid Bond it's a basic

1480
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:12,360
maybe being an acid Bond it's a basic
 

1481
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,830
maybe being an acid Bond it's a basic
Bond or maybe it's an oxidizing Pond and

1482
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:14,840
Bond or maybe it's an oxidizing Pond and
 

1483
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,029
Bond or maybe it's an oxidizing Pond and
so if you've got carbon and it goes in

1484
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:17,039
so if you've got carbon and it goes in
 

1485
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,590
so if you've got carbon and it goes in
oxidizing pond maybe the carbon starts

1486
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:18,600
oxidizing pond maybe the carbon starts
 

1487
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,630
oxidizing pond maybe the carbon starts
to oxidize and break apart so you go

1488
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:20,640
to oxidize and break apart so you go
 

1489
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,269
to oxidize and break apart so you go
through all these kind of obstacle

1490
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:23,279
through all these kind of obstacle
 

1491
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,389
through all these kind of obstacle
courses if you like given by reality so

1492
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:25,399
courses if you like given by reality so
 

1493
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:28,549
courses if you like given by reality so
selection is the ability happens when an

1494
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:28,559
selection is the ability happens when an
 

1495
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,110
selection is the ability happens when an
object survives in an environment for

1496
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:31,120
object survives in an environment for
 

1497
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:36,190
object survives in an environment for
some time but and this is a thing that's

1498
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:36,200
some time but and this is a thing that's
 

1499
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,590
some time but and this is a thing that's
super subtle the object has to be

1500
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:39,600
super subtle the object has to be
 

1501
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,430
super subtle the object has to be
continually being destroyed and made by

1502
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:41,440
continually being destroyed and made by
 

1503
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,909
continually being destroyed and made by
process so it's not just about the proc

1504
00:29:43,909 --> 00:29:43,919
process so it's not just about the proc
 

1505
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,269
process so it's not just about the proc
the object now it's about the process

1506
00:29:45,269 --> 00:29:45,279
the object now it's about the process
 

1507
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,789
the object now it's about the process
and time that makes it because a rock

1508
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:47,799
and time that makes it because a rock
 

1509
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:49,669
and time that makes it because a rock
could just stand on the mountain side

1510
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:49,679
could just stand on the mountain side
 

1511
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,590
could just stand on the mountain side
for four billion years and nothing

1512
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:51,600
for four billion years and nothing
 

1513
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,269
for four billion years and nothing
happened to it and that's not

1514
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:53,279
happened to it and that's not
 

1515
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,750
happened to it and that's not
necessarily really Advanced selection so

1516
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:55,760
necessarily really Advanced selection so
 

1517
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,430
necessarily really Advanced selection so
for selection to get really interesting

1518
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:57,440
for selection to get really interesting
 

1519
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,669
for selection to get really interesting
you need to have a turnover in time you

1520
00:29:59,669 --> 00:29:59,679
you need to have a turnover in time you
 

1521
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,070
you need to have a turnover in time you
need to be continually creating objects

1522
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:02,080
need to be continually creating objects
 

1523
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,710
need to be continually creating objects
producing them what we call Discovery

1524
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:04,720
producing them what we call Discovery
 

1525
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,630
producing them what we call Discovery
Time so there's a discovery time for an

1526
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:06,640
Time so there's a discovery time for an
 

1527
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,350
Time so there's a discovery time for an
object when that object is discovered if

1528
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:09,360
object when that object is discovered if
 

1529
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,710
object when that object is discovered if
it's say a molecule that can then act on

1530
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:11,720
it's say a molecule that can then act on
 

1531
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,950
it's say a molecule that can then act on
itself or the chain of events that

1532
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:13,960
itself or the chain of events that
 

1533
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,669
itself or the chain of events that
caused itself to bolster its formation

1534
00:30:16,669 --> 00:30:16,679
caused itself to bolster its formation
 

1535
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:18,310
caused itself to bolster its formation
then you go from Discovery time to

1536
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:18,320
then you go from Discovery time to
 

1537
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,590
then you go from Discovery time to
production time and suddenly you have

1538
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:20,600
production time and suddenly you have
 

1539
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,509
production time and suddenly you have
more of it in the universe so it could

1540
00:30:22,509 --> 00:30:22,519
more of it in the universe so it could
 

1541
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:24,990
more of it in the universe so it could
be a self-replicating molecule and the

1542
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:25,000
be a self-replicating molecule and the
 

1543
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,350
be a self-replicating molecule and the
interaction of the molecule in the

1544
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:26,360
interaction of the molecule in the
 

1545
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,350
interaction of the molecule in the
environment in the War Little Pond or in

1546
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:28,360
environment in the War Little Pond or in
 

1547
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,990
environment in the War Little Pond or in
the sea or wherever in the bubble could

1548
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:31,000
the sea or wherever in the bubble could
 

1549
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,990
the sea or wherever in the bubble could
then start to build a Proto Factory the

1550
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:34,000
then start to build a Proto Factory the
 

1551
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,190
then start to build a Proto Factory the
environment so really to answer your

1552
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:36,200
environment so really to answer your
 

1553
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,750
environment so really to answer your
question what the factory is the factory

1554
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:38,760
question what the factory is the factory
 

1555
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,669
question what the factory is the factory
is the environment but it's not very

1556
00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:40,679
is the environment but it's not very
 

1557
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:42,830
is the environment but it's not very
autonomous it's not very redundant

1558
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:42,840
autonomous it's not very redundant
 

1559
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,990
autonomous it's not very redundant
there's lots of things that could go

1560
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:44,000
there's lots of things that could go
 

1561
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,310
there's lots of things that could go
wrong so once you get high enough up the

1562
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:47,320
wrong so once you get high enough up the
 

1563
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:51,070
wrong so once you get high enough up the
the the hierarchy of networks of

1564
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:51,080
the the hierarchy of networks of
 

1565
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,950
the the hierarchy of networks of
interactions something needs to happen

1566
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:52,960
interactions something needs to happen
 

1567
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,269
interactions something needs to happen
that needs to be compressed into a

1568
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:54,279
that needs to be compressed into a
 

1569
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:56,669
that needs to be compressed into a
smaller volume and made resistant robust

1570
00:30:56,669 --> 00:30:56,679
smaller volume and made resistant robust
 

1571
00:30:56,679 --> 00:30:59,149
smaller volume and made resistant robust
because in bi techology selection and

1572
00:30:59,149 --> 00:30:59,159
because in bi techology selection and
 

1573
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:01,590
because in bi techology selection and
evolution is robust that you have error

1574
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:01,600
evolution is robust that you have error
 

1575
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,830
evolution is robust that you have error
correction built in you have really you

1576
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:03,840
correction built in you have really you
 

1577
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,750
correction built in you have really you
know there's good ways of basically

1578
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:05,760
know there's good ways of basically
 

1579
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,870
know there's good ways of basically
making sure propagation goes on so

1580
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:07,880
making sure propagation goes on so
 

1581
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,590
making sure propagation goes on so
really the difference between inorganic

1582
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:10,600
really the difference between inorganic
 

1583
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,190
really the difference between inorganic
a biotic selection Evolution and

1584
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:13,200
a biotic selection Evolution and
 

1585
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,669
a biotic selection Evolution and
evolution and stuff in biology is

1586
00:31:15,669 --> 00:31:15,679
evolution and stuff in biology is
 

1587
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,990
evolution and stuff in biology is
robustness um the ability to to kind of

1588
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:19,000
robustness um the ability to to kind of
 

1589
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,230
robustness um the ability to to kind of
propagate over over in the the ability

1590
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:23,240
propagate over over in the the ability
 

1591
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,909
propagate over over in the the ability
survive in lots of different

1592
00:31:24,909 --> 00:31:24,919
survive in lots of different
 

1593
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:28,230
survive in lots of different
environments whereas our poor little

1594
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:28,240
environments whereas our poor little
 

1595
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,230
environments whereas our poor little
inorganic salt molecule whatever just

1596
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:31,240
inorganic salt molecule whatever just
 

1597
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,830
inorganic salt molecule whatever just
dies in lots of different environments

1598
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:33,840
dies in lots of different environments
 

1599
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,430
dies in lots of different environments
so there's something super special that

1600
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:35,440
so there's something super special that
 

1601
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,509
so there's something super special that
happens from the inorganic envir

1602
00:31:38,509 --> 00:31:38,519
happens from the inorganic envir
 

1603
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:40,830
happens from the inorganic envir
molecule in the environment kills it to

1604
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:40,840
molecule in the environment kills it to
 

1605
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,389
molecule in the environment kills it to
where you've got Evolution and cells can

1606
00:31:42,389 --> 00:31:42,399
where you've got Evolution and cells can
 

1607
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:43,830
where you've got Evolution and cells can
survive

1608
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:43,840
survive
 

1609
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,590
survive
everywhere how special is that how do

1610
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:46,600
everywhere how special is that how do
 

1611
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,230
everywhere how special is that how do
you know those kinds of uh Evolution

1612
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:48,240
you know those kinds of uh Evolution
 

1613
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,190
you know those kinds of uh Evolution
factors aren't everywhere in the

1614
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:50,200
factors aren't everywhere in the
 

1615
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,389
factors aren't everywhere in the
universe I I don't and I'm excited

1616
00:31:54,389 --> 00:31:54,399

1617
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,629
universe I I don't and I'm excited
because I think selection isn't special

1618
00:31:56,629 --> 00:31:56,639
because I think selection isn't special
 

1619
00:31:56,639 --> 00:32:00,230
because I think selection isn't special
at all I think what is special is the

1620
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:00,240
at all I think what is special is the
 

1621
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,870
at all I think what is special is the
history of the environments on Earth

1622
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:02,880
history of the environments on Earth
 

1623
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,310
history of the environments on Earth
that gave rise to the first cell that

1624
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:05,320
that gave rise to the first cell that
 

1625
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:09,230
that gave rise to the first cell that
now has you know has taken all those

1626
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:09,240
now has you know has taken all those
 

1627
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,430
now has you know has taken all those
environments and is now more autonomous

1628
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:12,440

1629
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,269
environments and is now more autonomous
and I would like to think that you know

1630
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:14,279
and I would like to think that you know
 

1631
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:16,230
and I would like to think that you know
this

1632
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:16,240
this
 

1633
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,350
this
paper could be very

1634
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:19,360
paper could be very
 

1635
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,070
paper could be very
wrong but I don't think it's very wrong

1636
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:22,080
wrong but I don't think it's very wrong
 

1637
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,990
wrong but I don't think it's very wrong
I mean it's certainly wrong but it's

1638
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:24,000
I mean it's certainly wrong but it's
 

1639
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,110
I mean it's certainly wrong but it's
less wrong than some other ideas I hope

1640
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:26,120
less wrong than some other ideas I hope
 

1641
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,710
less wrong than some other ideas I hope
right and if allow inspires us to go and

1642
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:28,720
right and if allow inspires us to go and
 

1643
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,430
right and if allow inspires us to go and
look for selection in the universe

1644
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:30,440
look for selection in the universe
 

1645
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,029
look for selection in the universe
because we now have an equation where we

1646
00:32:32,029 --> 00:32:32,039
because we now have an equation where we
 

1647
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:33,950
because we now have an equation where we
can say we can look for selection going

1648
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:33,960
can say we can look for selection going
 

1649
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,430
can say we can look for selection going
on and say oh that's interesting we seem

00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:36,440
on and say oh that's interesting we seem
 

1651
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,909

to have a pro process that's giving

1652
00:32:38,909 --> 00:32:38,919
to have a pro process that's giving
 

1653
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:42,029
to have a pro process that's giving
that's giving us High copy number

1654
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:42,039
that's giving us High copy number
 

1655
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:44,509
that's giving us High copy number
objects that also are highly complex but

1656
00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:44,519
objects that also are highly complex but
 

1657
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:46,110
objects that also are highly complex but
that doesn't look like Life as We Know

1658
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:46,120
that doesn't look like Life as We Know
 

1659
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,310
that doesn't look like Life as We Know
It And we use that and say oh there's a

1660
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:48,320
It And we use that and say oh there's a
 

1661
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,230
It And we use that and say oh there's a
hydrothermal vent oh there's a process

1662
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:50,240
hydrothermal vent oh there's a process
 

1663
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,389
hydrothermal vent oh there's a process
going on this molecular networks because

1664
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:52,399
going on this molecular networks because
 

1665
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:55,029
going on this molecular networks because
the assembly equation is not only meant

1666
00:32:55,029 --> 00:32:55,039
the assembly equation is not only meant
 

1667
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,230
the assembly equation is not only meant
to identify at the higher end

1668
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:58,240
to identify at the higher end

Advanced selection what you get I would

1670
00:33:00,629 --> 00:33:00,639
Advanced selection what you get I would
 

1671
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:02,430
Advanced selection what you get I would
call in biology you super Advanced

1672
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:02,440
call in biology you super Advanced
 

1673
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,830
call in biology you super Advanced
selection and even I you could use the

1674
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:04,840
selection and even I you could use the
 

1675
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,029
selection and even I you could use the
assembly equation to look for technology

1676
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:07,039
assembly equation to look for technology
 

1677
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,629
assembly equation to look for technology
and um God forbid we could talk about

1678
00:33:09,629 --> 00:33:09,639
and um God forbid we could talk about
 

1679
00:33:09,639 --> 00:33:11,470
and um God forbid we could talk about
Consciousness and abstraction but let's

1680
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:11,480
Consciousness and abstraction but let's
 

1681
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,470
Consciousness and abstraction but let's
keep it primitive molecules and biology

1682
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:14,480
keep it primitive molecules and biology
 

1683
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,669
keep it primitive molecules and biology
so I think the real power of the

1684
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:15,679
so I think the real power of the
 

1685
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,750
so I think the real power of the
assembly equation is to is to say how

1686
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:17,760
assembly equation is to is to say how
 

1687
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,669
assembly equation is to is to say how
much selection is going on in this space

1688
00:33:20,669 --> 00:33:20,679
much selection is going on in this space
 

1689
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:22,310
much selection is going on in this space
and there's there's a really simple

1690
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:22,320
and there's there's a really simple
 

1691
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,310
and there's there's a really simple
thought experiment I could do is you you

1692
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:24,320
thought experiment I could do is you you
 

1693
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,950
thought experiment I could do is you you
know have a little petri dish and on

1694
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:25,960
know have a little petri dish and on
 

1695
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,070
know have a little petri dish and on
that petri dish you put some simple food

1696
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:28,080
that petri dish you put some simple food
 

1697
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,830
that petri dish you put some simple food
so the assembly index of all the sugars

1698
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:29,840
so the assembly index of all the sugars
 

1699
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,509
so the assembly index of all the sugars
and everything is quite low so then and

1700
00:33:32,509 --> 00:33:32,519
and everything is quite low so then and
 

1701
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:35,909
and everything is quite low so then and
you put a single Eco cell of e eoli cell

1702
00:33:35,909 --> 00:33:35,919
you put a single Eco cell of e eoli cell
 

1703
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,710
you put a single Eco cell of e eoli cell
yeah and then you say I'm going to I'm

1704
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:37,720
yeah and then you say I'm going to I'm
 

1705
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,269
yeah and then you say I'm going to I'm
going to measure the assembly in the

1706
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:39,279
going to measure the assembly in the
 

1707
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,389
going to measure the assembly in the
amount of assembly in the box so it's

1708
00:33:41,389 --> 00:33:41,399
amount of assembly in the box so it's
 

1709
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:45,110
amount of assembly in the box so it's
quite low but the rate of change of

1710
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:45,120
quite low but the rate of change of
 

1711
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,990
quite low but the rate of change of
assembly da DT will go vom sigmoidal as

1712
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:48,000
assembly da DT will go vom sigmoidal as
 

1713
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,149
assembly da DT will go vom sigmoidal as
it eats all the food and the number of

1714
00:33:50,149 --> 00:33:50,159
it eats all the food and the number of
 

1715
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,950
it eats all the food and the number of
coli cells will re will replicate

1716
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:52,960
coli cells will re will replicate
 

1717
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,190
coli cells will re will replicate
because they take all the food they copy

1718
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:55,200
because they take all the food they copy
 

1719
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,590
because they take all the food they copy
themselves the assembly index of all the

1720
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:56,600
themselves the assembly index of all the
 

1721
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,590
themselves the assembly index of all the
molecules goes up up up and up until the

1722
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:58,600
molecules goes up up up and up until the
 

1723
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,909
molecules goes up up up and up until the
food is exhausted in the box so now the

1724
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:01,919
food is exhausted in the box so now the
 

1725
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,269
food is exhausted in the box so now the
now the eoli stop I mean Dy is probably

1726
00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:05,279
now the eoli stop I mean Dy is probably
 

1727
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,710
now the eoli stop I mean Dy is probably
a strong word they stop respiring

1728
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:07,720
a strong word they stop respiring
 

1729
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,149
a strong word they stop respiring
because all the food is gone but

1730
00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:09,159
because all the food is gone but
 

1731
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,470
because all the food is gone but
suddenly the amount of assembly in the

1732
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:10,480
suddenly the amount of assembly in the
 

1733
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,669
suddenly the amount of assembly in the
box has gone up gigantically because of

1734
00:34:12,669 --> 00:34:12,679
box has gone up gigantically because of
 

1735
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:16,190
box has gone up gigantically because of
that one eoli Factory has just eaten

1736
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:16,200
that one eoli Factory has just eaten
 

1737
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,669
that one eoli Factory has just eaten
through M lots of other eoli Factory has

1738
00:34:18,669 --> 00:34:18,679
through M lots of other eoli Factory has
 

1739
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:21,030
through M lots of other eoli Factory has
run out of food and stopped and so that

1740
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:21,040
run out of food and stopped and so that
 

1741
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,349
run out of food and stopped and so that
looking at that so in the initial box

1742
00:34:23,349 --> 00:34:23,359
looking at that so in the initial box
 

1743
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:24,829
looking at that so in the initial box
although the amount of assembly was

1744
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:24,839
although the amount of assembly was
 

1745
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:28,310
although the amount of assembly was
really small it was able to replicate

1746
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:28,320
really small it was able to replicate
 

1747
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,190
really small it was able to replicate
and use all the food and go up and

1748
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:30,200
and use all the food and go up and
 

1749
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,190
and use all the food and go up and
that's what we're trying to do in the

1750
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:31,200
that's what we're trying to do in the
 

1751
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,869
that's what we're trying to do in the
lab actually is kind of make those kind

1752
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:32,879
lab actually is kind of make those kind
 

1753
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,149
lab actually is kind of make those kind
of experiments and see if we can spot

1754
00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:36,159
of experiments and see if we can spot
 

1755
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,430
of experiments and see if we can spot
the emergence of molecular networks are

1756
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:38,440
the emergence of molecular networks are
 

1757
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,510
the emergence of molecular networks are
producing complexity as we feed in raw

1758
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:41,520
producing complexity as we feed in raw
 

1759
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,349
producing complexity as we feed in raw
materials and we feed a challenge an

1760
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:44,359
materials and we feed a challenge an
 

1761
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:46,669
materials and we feed a challenge an
environment you know we try and kill the

1762
00:34:46,669 --> 00:34:46,679
environment you know we try and kill the
 

1763
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,990
environment you know we try and kill the
molecules and and and really that's the

1764
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:49,000
molecules and and and really that's the
 

1765
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,510
molecules and and and really that's the
main kind of idea for the entire paper

1766
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:52,520
main kind of idea for the entire paper
 

1767
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,430
main kind of idea for the entire paper
yeah and see if you can measure the

1768
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:54,440
yeah and see if you can measure the
 

1769
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,149
yeah and see if you can measure the
changes in the assembly index throughout

1770
00:34:56,149 --> 00:34:56,159
changes in the assembly index throughout
 

1771
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,910
changes in the assembly index throughout
the whole system yeah okay what what

1772
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:57,920
the whole system yeah okay what what
 

1773
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,230
the whole system yeah okay what what
about if if I show up to new planet we

1774
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:00,240
about if if I show up to new planet we
 

1775
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,270
about if if I show up to new planet we
go to Mars or some other planet from a

1776
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:02,280
go to Mars or some other planet from a
 

1777
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,870
go to Mars or some other planet from a
different solar system and how do we use

1778
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:05,880
different solar system and how do we use
 

1779
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,349
different solar system and how do we use
assembly index there to discover alien

1780
00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:09,359
assembly index there to discover alien
 

1781
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,870
assembly index there to discover alien
life um in very simply actually if we

1782
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:12,880
life um in very simply actually if we
 

1783
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,230
life um in very simply actually if we
let's say we'll go to Mars with a mass

1784
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:14,240
let's say we'll go to Mars with a mass
 

1785
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,030
let's say we'll go to Mars with a mass
spectrometer with a sufficiently high

1786
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:16,040
spectrometer with a sufficiently high
 

1787
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,069
spectrometer with a sufficiently high
resolution so what you have to be able

1788
00:35:18,069 --> 00:35:18,079
resolution so what you have to be able
 

1789
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,150
resolution so what you have to be able
to do so good thing about Mass speec um

1790
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:22,160
to do so good thing about Mass speec um
 

1791
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,670
to do so good thing about Mass speec um
is that you can um select a molecule

1792
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:25,680
is that you can um select a molecule
 

1793
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,510
is that you can um select a molecule
from the mass and then if it's high

1794
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:27,520
from the mass and then if it's high
 

1795
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,030
from the mass and then if it's high
enough resolution you can be more and

1796
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:29,040
enough resolution you can be more and
 

1797
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,910
enough resolution you can be more and
more sure that you're just seeing um

1798
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:31,920
more sure that you're just seeing um
 

1799
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,310
more sure that you're just seeing um
identical copies you can count them and

1800
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:34,320
identical copies you can count them and
 

1801
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,670
identical copies you can count them and
then you fragment them and you count the

1802
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:35,680
then you fragment them and you count the
 

1803
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,710
then you fragment them and you count the
number of fragments and look at the

1804
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:37,720
number of fragments and look at the
 

1805
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,990
number of fragments and look at the
molecular weight and the higher the

1806
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:39,000
molecular weight and the higher the
 

1807
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,790
molecular weight and the higher the
molecular weight and the higher the

1808
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:40,800
molecular weight and the higher the
 

1809
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,910
molecular weight and the higher the
number of fragments the higher the

1810
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:41,920
number of fragments the higher the
 

1811
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,310
number of fragments the higher the
assembly index so if you go to Mars and

1812
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:44,320
assembly index so if you go to Mars and
 

1813
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,790
assembly index so if you go to Mars and
you take a mass spec or high enough

1814
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:45,800
you take a mass spec or high enough
 

1815
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,710
you take a mass spec or high enough
resolution and you can find molecules

1816
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:48,720
resolution and you can find molecules
 

1817
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,990
resolution and you can find molecules
I'll give guide on Earth if you could

1818
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:51,000
I'll give guide on Earth if you could
 

1819
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,230
I'll give guide on Earth if you could
find molecules say greater than 350

1820
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:54,240
find molecules say greater than 350
 

1821
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,190
find molecules say greater than 350
molecular weight with more than 15

1822
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:56,200
molecular weight with more than 15
 

1823
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,390
molecular weight with more than 15
fragments

1824
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:57,400
fragments
 

1825
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,470
fragments
you have found artifacts that can only

1826
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:00,480
you have found artifacts that can only
 

1827
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,990
you have found artifacts that can only
be produced at least on Earth by life

1828
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:05,000
be produced at least on Earth by life
 

1829
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,510
be produced at least on Earth by life
now you would say oh well maybe the

1830
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:06,520
now you would say oh well maybe the
 

1831
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,349
now you would say oh well maybe the
geological process I would argue very

1832
00:36:08,349 --> 00:36:08,359
geological process I would argue very
 

1833
00:36:08,359 --> 00:36:10,790
geological process I would argue very
vly that that is not the case but we can

1834
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:10,800
vly that that is not the case but we can
 

1835
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,790
vly that that is not the case but we can
say look if you don't like the cut off

1836
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:12,800
say look if you don't like the cut off
 

1837
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,510
say look if you don't like the cut off
on

1838
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:13,520
on
 

1839
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,710
on
Earth go up higher 30 100 right because

1840
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:17,720
Earth go up higher 30 100 right because
 

1841
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,030
Earth go up higher 30 100 right because
there's going to be a point where you

1842
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:19,040
there's going to be a point where you
 

1843
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,790
there's going to be a point where you
can find a molecule with so many

1844
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:20,800
can find a molecule with so many
 

1845
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,150
can find a molecule with so many
different parts the chances of you

1846
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:23,160
different parts the chances of you
 

1847
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,390
different parts the chances of you
getting a molecule that has a 100

1848
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:25,400
getting a molecule that has a 100
 

1849
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,630
getting a molecule that has a 100
different parts um and finding a million

1850
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:29,640
different parts um and finding a million
 

1851
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,309
different parts um and finding a million
identical copies you know that's that's

1852
00:36:32,309 --> 00:36:32,319
identical copies you know that's that's
 

1853
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:34,430
identical copies you know that's that's
just impossible that could never happen

1854
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:34,440
just impossible that could never happen
 

1855
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,589
just impossible that could never happen
in an infinite set of universes can you

1856
00:36:37,589 --> 00:36:37,599
in an infinite set of universes can you
 

1857
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,870
in an infinite set of universes can you
just Linger on this copy number

1858
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:39,880
just Linger on this copy number
 

1859
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,390
just Linger on this copy number
thing uh a million different

1860
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:43,400
thing uh a million different
 

1861
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,109
thing uh a million different
copies what do you mean by copies and

1862
00:36:46,109 --> 00:36:46,119
copies what do you mean by copies and
 

1863
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:48,109
copies what do you mean by copies and
why is the number of copies

1864
00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:48,119
why is the number of copies
 

1865
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:50,750
why is the number of copies
important yeah that was so interesting

1866
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:50,760
important yeah that was so interesting
 

1867
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,910
important yeah that was so interesting
and that um

1868
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:52,920
and that um
 

1869
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,550
and that um
I always understood the copy number was

1870
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:55,560
I always understood the copy number was
 

1871
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,990
I always understood the copy number was
really important but I never explained

1872
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:57,000
really important but I never explained
 

1873
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,550
really important but I never explained
it properly for ages um and it be I kept

1874
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:01,560
it properly for ages um and it be I kept
 

1875
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,150
it properly for ages um and it be I kept
having this it goes back to this if I

1876
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:04,160
having this it goes back to this if I
 

1877
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,390
having this it goes back to this if I
give you a um I don't know a really

1878
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:07,400
give you a um I don't know a really
 

1879
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,990
give you a um I don't know a really
complicated molecule and I say it's

1880
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:09,000
complicated molecule and I say it's
 

1881
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,150
complicated molecule and I say it's
complicated you could say hey that's

1882
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:10,160
complicated you could say hey that's
 

1883
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,190
complicated you could say hey that's
really complicated but is it just really

1884
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:12,200
really complicated but is it just really
 

1885
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,109
really complicated but is it just really
random and so so I realized that

1886
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:15,119
random and so so I realized that
 

1887
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,630
random and so so I realized that
ultimate Randomness and ultimate

1888
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:16,640
ultimate Randomness and ultimate
 

1889
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,150
ultimate Randomness and ultimate
complexity are

1890
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:18,160
complexity are
 

1891
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,990
complexity are
indistinguishable

1892
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:20,000
indistinguishable
 

1893
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,910
indistinguishable
until you can um you can see a structure

1894
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:23,920
until you can um you can see a structure
 

1895
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,150
until you can um you can see a structure
in the randomness so you can see copies

1896
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:26,160
in the randomness so you can see copies
 

1897
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,790
in the randomness so you can see copies
so copies

1898
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:28,800
so copies
 

1899
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,109
so copies
implies structure

1900
00:37:32,109 --> 00:37:32,119
implies structure
 

1901
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:34,309
implies structure
yeah the factory I mean there's a deep

1902
00:37:34,309 --> 00:37:34,319
yeah the factory I mean there's a deep
 

1903
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:37,589
yeah the factory I mean there's a deep
profound thing in there because like if

1904
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:37,599
profound thing in there because like if
 

1905
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,390
profound thing in there because like if
you just have a

1906
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:40,400
you just have a
 

1907
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,309
you just have a
random random process you going to get a

1908
00:37:43,309 --> 00:37:43,319
random random process you going to get a
 

1909
00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:45,510
random random process you going to get a
lot of complex beautiful sophisticated

1910
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:45,520
lot of complex beautiful sophisticated
 

1911
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,109
lot of complex beautiful sophisticated
things mhm what makes

1912
00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:49,119
things mhm what makes
 

1913
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,790
things mhm what makes
them complex in the way we think life is

1914
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:51,800
them complex in the way we think life is
 

1915
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,790
them complex in the way we think life is
complex or um yeah something like a a

1916
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:55,800
complex or um yeah something like a a
 

1917
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,589
complex or um yeah something like a a
factory that's operating under a

1918
00:37:57,589 --> 00:37:57,599
factory that's operating under a
 

1919
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,870
factory that's operating under a
selection processes there should be

1920
00:37:59,870 --> 00:37:59,880
selection processes there should be
 

1921
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,870
selection processes there should be
copies is there like some looseness

1922
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:01,880
copies is there like some looseness
 

1923
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,349
copies is there like some looseness
about copies

1924
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:03,359
about copies
 

1925
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,550
about copies
like what does it mean for two objects

1926
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:05,560
like what does it mean for two objects
 

1927
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,910
like what does it mean for two objects
to be equal it it's it's all to do with

1928
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:07,920
to be equal it it's it's all to do with
 

1929
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,750
to be equal it it's it's all to do with
the the telescope or the microscope

1930
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:09,760
the the telescope or the microscope
 

1931
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,030
the the telescope or the microscope
you're using and so at the maximum

1932
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:13,040
you're using and so at the maximum
 

1933
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,349
you're using and so at the maximum
resolution so in the nice thing about

1934
00:38:15,349 --> 00:38:15,359
resolution so in the nice thing about
 

1935
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,750
resolution so in the nice thing about
the nice thing about chemists is they

1936
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:16,760
the nice thing about chemists is they
 

1937
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,470
the nice thing about chemists is they
have this concept of the molecule and

1938
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:18,480
have this concept of the molecule and
 

1939
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,950
have this concept of the molecule and
they're all familiar with a molecule and

1940
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:19,960
they're all familiar with a molecule and
 

1941
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,550
they're all familiar with a molecule and
molecules you can hold you know in your

1942
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:22,560
molecules you can hold you know in your
 

1943
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,750
molecules you can hold you know in your
hand lots of them identical copies a

1944
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:25,760
hand lots of them identical copies a
 

1945
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,349
hand lots of them identical copies a
molecules actually super important thing

1946
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:27,359
molecules actually super important thing
 

1947
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,390
molecules actually super important thing
in chemistry to say look you can have a

1948
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:29,400
in chemistry to say look you can have a
 

1949
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,470
in chemistry to say look you can have a
mole of a molecues an avagadro's number

1950
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:31,480
mole of a molecues an avagadro's number
 

1951
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,589
mole of a molecues an avagadro's number
of molecules and they're identical what

1952
00:38:33,589 --> 00:38:33,599
of molecules and they're identical what
 

1953
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:34,910
of molecules and they're identical what
does that mean that means that the

1954
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:34,920
does that mean that means that the
 

1955
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,670
does that mean that means that the
molecular composition the bonding and so

1956
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:37,680
molecular composition the bonding and so
 

1957
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,230
molecular composition the bonding and so
on the configuration is all is is

1958
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:40,240
on the configuration is all is is
 

1959
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,630
on the configuration is all is is
indistinguishable you can hold them

1960
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:41,640
indistinguishable you can hold them
 

1961
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,430
indistinguishable you can hold them
together you can overlay them so the way

1962
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:43,440
together you can overlay them so the way
 

1963
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,829
together you can overlay them so the way
I do it is if I say here's a bag um of

1964
00:38:46,829 --> 00:38:46,839
I do it is if I say here's a bag um of
 

1965
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:48,630
I do it is if I say here's a bag um of
10 identical molecules let's prove

1966
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:48,640
10 identical molecules let's prove
 

1967
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,270
10 identical molecules let's prove
they're identical you pick one out of

1968
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:50,280
they're identical you pick one out of
 

1969
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,910
they're identical you pick one out of
the the out of the bag and you basically

1970
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:52,920
the the out of the bag and you basically
 

1971
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,950
the the out of the bag and you basically
observe it using some technique and then

1972
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:54,960
observe it using some technique and then
 

1973
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,349
observe it using some technique and then
you put it you take it away and then you

1974
00:38:56,349 --> 00:38:56,359
you put it you take it away and then you
 

1975
00:38:56,359 --> 00:38:57,750
you put it you take it away and then you
pick take another one out if You observe

1976
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:57,760
pick take another one out if You observe
 

1977
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,750
pick take another one out if You observe
it using technique you see no

1978
00:38:58,750 --> 00:38:58,760
it using technique you see no
 

1979
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,510
it using technique you see no
differences they're identical it's

1980
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:00,520
differences they're identical it's
 

1981
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,670
differences they're identical it's
really interesting to get right because

1982
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:02,680
really interesting to get right because
 

1983
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,230
really interesting to get right because
if you take say two molecules molecules

1984
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:05,240
if you take say two molecules molecules
 

1985
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,230
if you take say two molecules molecules
can be in different vibrational

1986
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:07,240
can be in different vibrational
 

1987
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,790
can be in different vibrational
rotational States they're moving all the

1988
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:08,800
rotational States they're moving all the
 

1989
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,870
rotational States they're moving all the
time so for this respect identical

1990
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:10,880
time so for this respect identical
 

1991
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,390
time so for this respect identical
molecules have identical bonding in this

1992
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:13,400
molecules have identical bonding in this
 

1993
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,470
molecules have identical bonding in this
case we don't even um talk about

1994
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:15,480
case we don't even um talk about
 

1995
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,910
case we don't even um talk about
chirality because we don't have a

1996
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:16,920
chirality because we don't have a
 

1997
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,309
chirality because we don't have a
chirality detector so two identical

1998
00:39:19,309 --> 00:39:19,319
chirality detector so two identical
 

1999
00:39:19,319 --> 00:39:21,589
chirality detector so two identical
molecules in one conception assembly

2000
00:39:21,589 --> 00:39:21,599
molecules in one conception assembly
 

2001
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,630
molecules in one conception assembly
Theory basically um considers both hands

2002
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:24,640
Theory basically um considers both hands
 

2003
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,470
Theory basically um considers both hands
as being the same um but of but of

2004
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:27,480
as being the same um but of but of
 

2005
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,309
as being the same um but of but of
course they're not they're different as

2006
00:39:29,309 --> 00:39:29,319
course they're not they're different as
 

2007
00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:31,910
course they're not they're different as
soon as you have a chyro distinguisher

2008
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:31,920
soon as you have a chyro distinguisher
 

2009
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,550
soon as you have a chyro distinguisher
detect to detect the left and the right

2010
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:33,560
detect to detect the left and the right
 

2011
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,829
detect to detect the left and the right
hand they become different and so it's

2012
00:39:35,829 --> 00:39:35,839
hand they become different and so it's
 

2013
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,829
hand they become different and so it's
to do with the detection system that you

2014
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:37,839
to do with the detection system that you
 

2015
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:41,589
to do with the detection system that you
have and the resolution so I wonder if

2016
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:41,599
have and the resolution so I wonder if
 

2017
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:45,150
have and the resolution so I wonder if
there's an art in science to the which

2018
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:45,160
there's an art in science to the which
 

2019
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,069
there's an art in science to the which
detection system is used when you show

2020
00:39:47,069 --> 00:39:47,079
detection system is used when you show
 

2021
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:49,390
detection system is used when you show
up to a new planet yeah yeah yeah so

2022
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:49,400
up to a new planet yeah yeah yeah so
 

2023
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,829
up to a new planet yeah yeah yeah so
like you're talking about chemistry a

2024
00:39:50,829 --> 00:39:50,839
like you're talking about chemistry a
 

2025
00:39:50,839 --> 00:39:54,550
like you're talking about chemistry a
lot today we have kind of standardized

2026
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:54,560
lot today we have kind of standardized
 

2027
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,470
lot today we have kind of standardized
detection systems right

2028
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:57,480
detection systems right
 

2029
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,950
detection systems right
of how to compare

2030
00:39:58,950 --> 00:39:58,960
of how to compare
 

2031
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,710
of how to compare
molecules so you know when you start to

2032
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:01,720
molecules so you know when you start to
 

2033
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,550
molecules so you know when you start to
talk about emojis and language and uh

2034
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:04,560
talk about emojis and language and uh
 

2035
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,630
talk about emojis and language and uh
mathematical theorems

2036
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:06,640
mathematical theorems
 

2037
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,069
mathematical theorems
and uh I don't know more sophisticated

2038
00:40:09,069 --> 00:40:09,079
and uh I don't know more sophisticated
 

2039
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:11,510
and uh I don't know more sophisticated
things at a different scale at a smaller

2040
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:11,520
things at a different scale at a smaller
 

2041
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,030
things at a different scale at a smaller
scale than molecules at are largest

2042
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:13,040

2043
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,470
scale than molecules at are largest
scale the

2044
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:14,480
scale the
 

2045
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,550
scale the
molecules like what

2046
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:16,560
molecules like what
 

2047
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,870
molecules like what
detection like if if we look at the

2048
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:18,880
detection like if if we look at the
 

2049
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,150
detection like if if we look at the
difference between you and me lxly are

2050
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:22,160
difference between you and me lxly are
 

2051
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,829
difference between you and me lxly are
we the same are we different sure I mean

2052
00:40:24,829 --> 00:40:24,839
we the same are we different sure I mean
 

2053
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,790
we the same are we different sure I mean
of course we're different close up but

2054
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:26,800
of course we're different close up but
 

2055
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,550
of course we're different close up but
if you zoom out a little bit will

2056
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:28,560
if you zoom out a little bit will
 

2057
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,230
if you zoom out a little bit will
morphologically look the

2058
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:30,240
morphologically look the
 

2059
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,829
morphologically look the
same you know height characteristics

2060
00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:33,839
same you know height characteristics
 

2061
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,990
same you know height characteristics
hair length stuff like that well also

2062
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:36,000
hair length stuff like that well also
 

2063
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,870
hair length stuff like that well also
like the species and yeah yeah yeah and

2064
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:38,880
like the species and yeah yeah yeah and
 

2065
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,309
like the species and yeah yeah yeah and
and also there's a sense why we're both

2066
00:40:41,309 --> 00:40:41,319
and also there's a sense why we're both
 

2067
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:44,069
and also there's a sense why we're both
from Earth yeah I I agree I mean this is

2068
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:44,079
from Earth yeah I I agree I mean this is
 

2069
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,550
from Earth yeah I I agree I mean this is
the power of assembly theory in that

2070
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:45,560
the power of assembly theory in that
 

2071
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,430
the power of assembly theory in that
regard that you if if you so if

2072
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:48,440
regard that you if if you so if
 

2073
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,069
regard that you if if you so if
everything so the way to look at it if

2074
00:40:50,069 --> 00:40:50,079
everything so the way to look at it if
 

2075
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,870
everything so the way to look at it if
you have a box of objects if they're all

2076
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:53,880
you have a box of objects if they're all
 

2077
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,190
you have a box of objects if they're all
if they're all

2078
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:55,200
if they're all
 

2079
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,470
if they're all
indistinguishable uh um then using your

2080
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:58,480
indistinguishable uh um then using your
 

2081
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,030
indistinguishable uh um then using your
Technique you then you what you then do

2082
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:01,040
Technique you then you what you then do
 

2083
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,069
Technique you then you what you then do
is you then look at the assembly index

2084
00:41:03,069 --> 00:41:03,079
is you then look at the assembly index
 

2085
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:04,870
is you then look at the assembly index
now if the assembly index of them is

2086
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:04,880
now if the assembly index of them is
 

2087
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,950
now if the assembly index of them is
really low right and they all they're

2088
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:06,960
really low right and they all they're
 

2089
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,670
really low right and they all they're
all indistinguishable then You' then

2090
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:08,680
all indistinguishable then You' then
 

2091
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,190
all indistinguishable then You' then
it's telling you that you have to go to

2092
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:10,200
it's telling you that you have to go to
 

2093
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,630
it's telling you that you have to go to
another resolution so that would be you

2094
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:12,640
another resolution so that would be you
 

2095
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,069
another resolution so that would be you
know it's kind of a signing scale it's

2096
00:41:14,069 --> 00:41:14,079
know it's kind of a signing scale it's
 

2097
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,470
know it's kind of a signing scale it's
kind of nice so got it so those two kind

2098
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:16,480
kind of nice so got it so those two kind
 

2099
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,750
kind of nice so got it so those two kind
of are attentional with each other the

2100
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:18,760
of are attentional with each other the
 

2101
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,309
of are attentional with each other the
co the number of copies and the assembly

2102
00:41:20,309 --> 00:41:20,319
co the number of copies and the assembly
 

2103
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:21,630
co the number of copies and the assembly
index

2104
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:21,640
index
 

2105
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,190
index
yeah that's really really interesting so

2106
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:25,200
yeah that's really really interesting so
 

2107
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,910
yeah that's really really interesting so
okay so you show up to your Planet

2108
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:26,920
okay so you show up to your Planet
 

2109
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,510
okay so you show up to your Planet
you'll be doing what I would do Mass

2110
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:29,520
you'll be doing what I would do Mass
 

2111
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,589
you'll be doing what I would do Mass
Spec I would bring on a sample of what

2112
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:31,599
Spec I would bring on a sample of what
 

2113
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,190
Spec I would bring on a sample of what
like First of all like how big of a

2114
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:33,200
like First of all like how big of a
 

2115
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,710
like First of all like how big of a
scoop do you take did you just take a

2116
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:34,720
scoop do you take did you just take a
 

2117
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,390
scoop do you take did you just take a
scoop like what like uh so we're looking

2118
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:38,400
scoop like what like uh so we're looking
 

2119
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,309
scoop like what like uh so we're looking
for primitive life I would I would look

2120
00:41:43,309 --> 00:41:43,319
for primitive life I would I would look
 

2121
00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:45,349
for primitive life I would I would look
yeah so if you're just going to Mars or

2122
00:41:45,349 --> 00:41:45,359
yeah so if you're just going to Mars or
 

2123
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:49,030
yeah so if you're just going to Mars or
Titan or Enceladus or somewhere so a

2124
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:49,040
Titan or Enceladus or somewhere so a
 

2125
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,430
Titan or Enceladus or somewhere so a
number of ways of doing it so you could

2126
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:50,440
number of ways of doing it so you could
 

2127
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,109
number of ways of doing it so you could
take a large scoop or you go for the

2128
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:52,119
take a large scoop or you go for the
 

2129
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:54,750
take a large scoop or you go for the
atmosphere and detect stuff so and you

2130
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:54,760
atmosphere and detect stuff so and you
 

2131
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:58,150
atmosphere and detect stuff so and you
can make a light um a life meter right

2132
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:58,160
can make a light um a life meter right
 

2133
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:03,230
can make a light um a life meter right
so um one of Sarah's colleagues at ASU

2134
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:03,240
so um one of Sarah's colleagues at ASU
 

2135
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,710
so um one of Sarah's colleagues at ASU
Paul Davis keeps calling it a life meter

2136
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:05,720
Paul Davis keeps calling it a life meter
 

2137
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,550
Paul Davis keeps calling it a life meter
a life meter which is quite a nice idea

2138
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:07,560
a life meter which is quite a nice idea
 

2139
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,750
a life meter which is quite a nice idea
because you think about it if you've got

2140
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:09,760
because you think about it if you've got
 

2141
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,870
because you think about it if you've got
um a living system that's producing

2142
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:11,880
um a living system that's producing
 

2143
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,630
um a living system that's producing
these uh highly complex molecules and

2144
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:14,640
these uh highly complex molecules and
 

2145
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,109
these uh highly complex molecules and
they drift away and they're in a highly

2146
00:42:17,109 --> 00:42:17,119
they drift away and they're in a highly
 

2147
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,470
they drift away and they're in a highly
um kind of

2148
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:18,480
um kind of
 

2149
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,790
um kind of
um demanding environment they could be

2150
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:20,800
um demanding environment they could be
 

2151
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,230
um demanding environment they could be
burnt right so they could just be

2152
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:22,240
burnt right so they could just be
 

2153
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,150
burnt right so they could just be
falling apart so you want to sniff a

2154
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:24,160
falling apart so you want to sniff a
 

2155
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,589
falling apart so you want to sniff a
little bit of complexity and say warmer

2156
00:42:25,589 --> 00:42:25,599
little bit of complexity and say warmer
 

2157
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,390
little bit of complexity and say warmer
warmer warmer oh we found life we found

2158
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:27,400
warmer warmer oh we found life we found
 

2159
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,670
warmer warmer oh we found life we found
the alien we found we found the alien

2160
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:29,680
the alien we found we found the alien

Elon Musk smoking a joint in the bottom
 

2163
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,030
Elon Musk smoking a joint in the bottom
of the cave on mars or Elon himself

of the cave on mars or Elon himself
 

2165
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,069
of the cave on mars or Elon himself
whatever right you say okay found it so

2166
00:42:36,069 --> 00:42:36,079
whatever right you say okay found it so
 

2167
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,309
whatever right you say okay found it so
what you can do is the mass spectrometer

2168
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:38,319
what you can do is the mass spectrometer
 

2169
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,270
what you can do is the mass spectrometer
um you could just look for things in the

2170
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:40,280
um you could just look for things in the
 

2171
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,549
um you could just look for things in the
gas phase or you go on the surface drill

2172
00:42:42,549 --> 00:42:42,559
gas phase or you go on the surface drill
 

2173
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:45,349
gas phase or you go on the surface drill
down because you want to find molecules

2174
00:42:45,349 --> 00:42:45,359
down because you want to find molecules
 

2175
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:49,069
down because you want to find molecules
that are you you've either got to find

2176
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:49,079
that are you you've either got to find
 

2177
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:51,309
that are you you've either got to find
the source living system because the

2178
00:42:51,309 --> 00:42:51,319
the source living system because the

problem with just looking for complexity

2180
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:53,160
problem with just looking for complexity
 

2181
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,750
problem with just looking for complexity
is it gets burnt away so in a harsh

2182
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:55,760
is it gets burnt away so in a harsh
 

2183
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,270
is it gets burnt away so in a harsh
environment on on on say on the M

2184
00:42:58,270 --> 00:42:58,280
environment on on on say on the M
 

2185
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,470
environment on on on say on the M
surface of Mars there's a very low

2186
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:00,480
surface of Mars there's a very low
 

2187
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,430
surface of Mars there's a very low
probability that you're going to find

2188
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:02,440
probability that you're going to find
 

2189
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,150
probability that you're going to find
really complex molecules because of all

2190
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:04,160
really complex molecules because of all
 

2191
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,430
really complex molecules because of all
the radiation and so on if you drill

2192
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:06,440
the radiation and so on if you drill
 

2193
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,910
the radiation and so on if you drill
down a little bit you could drill down a

2194
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:07,920
down a little bit you could drill down a
 

2195
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,190
down a little bit you could drill down a
bit into into a soil that's billions of

2196
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:10,200
bit into into a soil that's billions of
 

2197
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,270
bit into into a soil that's billions of
years old then I would put in some

2198
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:13,280
years old then I would put in some
 

2199
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,870
years old then I would put in some
solvent water alcohol or something or

2200
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:15,880
solvent water alcohol or something or
 

2201
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:20,190
solvent water alcohol or something or
take a a scoop put it in put viol make

2202

then be great if you could say okay we

2214
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:32,400
then be great if you could say okay we
 

2215
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,950
then be great if you could say okay we
found evidence of life now we want to

2216
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:34,960
found evidence of life now we want to
 

2217
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,630

for more and more complexity until you

2220
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:39,800
for more and more complexity until you
 

2221
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,109
for more and more complexity until you
actually find living cells and you get

2222
00:43:42,109 --> 00:43:42,119
actually find living cells and you get
 

2223
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,030
actually find living cells and you get
those new living cells and then and then

2224
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:44,040
those new living cells and then and then
 

2225
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,390
those new living cells and then and then
you could bring them back to Earth or

2226
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:45,400
you could bring them back to Earth or
 

2227
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,510
you could bring them back to Earth or
you could try and sequence them you

2228
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:46,520
you could try and sequence them you
 

2229
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,829
you could try and sequence them you
could see that they have different DNA

2230
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:47,839
could see that they have different DNA
 

2231
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,670
could see that they have different DNA

00:43:59,750 --> 00:43:59,760
first way of doing it just no no no but
 

2243
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,829
first way of doing it just no no no but
that's that's um that's one of the major

2244
00:44:01,829 --> 00:44:01,839
that's that's um that's one of the major
 

2245
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,270
that's that's um that's one of the major
components of it but I'm talking about

2246
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:03,280
components of it but I'm talking about
 

2247
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,950
components of it but I'm talking about
like I what if it's a device we got to

2248
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:05,960
like I what if it's a device we got to
 

2249
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,829
like I what if it's a device we got to
and and branding logo we got to talk

2250
00:44:07,829 --> 00:44:07,839
and and branding logo we got to talk
 

2251
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:09,950
and and branding logo we got to talk
that that's later but what's the input

2252
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:09,960
that that's later but what's the input
 

2253
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,950
that that's later but what's the input
what's the like how do you get to the um

2254
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:13,960
what's the like how do you get to the um
 

2255
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,790
what's the like how do you get to the um
a metered output so I would I would take

2256
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:16,800
a metered output so I would I would take
 

2257
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,390
a metered output so I would I would take
a life so my my life meter our life

2258
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:20,400
a life so my my life meter our life
 

2259
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,670
a life so my my life meter our life
meter there you go thank you yeah you're

2260
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:23,680
meter there you go thank you yeah you're
 

2261
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,190
meter there you go thank you yeah you're
welcome um uh would have both infrared

2262
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:27,200
welcome um uh would have both infrared
 

2263
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,549
welcome um uh would have both infrared
and MPC so it would have two ports so it

2264
00:44:29,549 --> 00:44:29,559
and MPC so it would have two ports so it
 

2265
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:31,750
and MPC so it would have two ports so it
could Shine the Light um and so what it

2266
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:31,760
could Shine the Light um and so what it
 

2267
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,349
could Shine the Light um and so what it
would do is you would have a a vacuum

2268
00:44:34,349 --> 00:44:34,359
would do is you would have a a vacuum
 

2269
00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:36,349
would do is you would have a a vacuum
chamber and you would have an

2270
00:44:36,349 --> 00:44:36,359
chamber and you would have an
 

2271
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:38,910
chamber and you would have an
electrostatic analyzer and you'd have a

2272
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:38,920
electrostatic analyzer and you'd have a
 

2273
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:42,230
electrostatic analyzer and you'd have a
monochromator to producing infrared um

2274
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:42,240
monochromator to producing infrared um
 

2275
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,030
monochromator to producing infrared um
you'd add the S so you'd take a scoop of

2276
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:44,040
you'd add the S so you'd take a scoop of
 

2277
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,150
you'd add the S so you'd take a scoop of
the sample put it in the Life meter it

2278
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:46,160
the sample put it in the Life meter it
 

2279
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,990
the sample put it in the Life meter it
would then add a solvent or heat up the

2280
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:49,000
would then add a solvent or heat up the
 

2281
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,390
would then add a solvent or heat up the
sample so some volatiles come off the

2282
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:51,400
sample so some volatiles come off the
 

2283
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,710
sample so some volatiles come off the
volatiles would then be put into the

2284
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:53,720
volatiles would then be put into the
 

2285
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,030
volatiles would then be put into the
into the mass spectromet into

2286
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:55,040
into the mass spectromet into
 

2287
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,829
into the mass spectromet into
electrostatic trap and you'd weigh the

2288
00:44:56,829 --> 00:44:56,839
electrostatic trap and you'd weigh the
 

2289
00:44:56,839 --> 00:44:58,670
electrostatic trap and you'd weigh the
molecules and fragment them

2290
00:44:58,670 --> 00:44:58,680
molecules and fragment them
 

2291
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,349
molecules and fragment them
alternatively you'd shine infrared light

2292
00:45:00,349 --> 00:45:00,359
alternatively you'd shine infrared light
 

2293
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:01,790
alternatively you'd shine infrared light
on them you count the number of bands

2294
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:01,800
on them you count the number of bands
 

2295
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,030
on them you count the number of bands
but you'd have to in that case do some

2296
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:04,040
but you'd have to in that case do some
 

2297
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,390
but you'd have to in that case do some
separation because you want to separate

2298
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:05,400
separation because you want to separate
 

2299
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,750
separation because you want to separate
in and so in MPC it's really nice and

2300
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:07,760
in and so in MPC it's really nice and
 

2301
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,190
in and so in MPC it's really nice and
convenient because you can separate

2302
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:09,200
convenient because you can separate
 

2303
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,589
convenient because you can separate
electrostatically but um you need to

2304
00:45:11,589 --> 00:45:11,599
electrostatically but um you need to
 

2305
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:13,190
electrostatically but um you need to
have that can you do it in real time

2306
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:13,200
have that can you do it in real time
 

2307
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,990
have that can you do it in real time
yeah pretty much pretty much yeah so

2308
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:15,000
yeah pretty much pretty much yeah so
 

2309
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,950
yeah pretty much pretty much yeah so
let's go all the way back so okay we're

2310
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:16,960
let's go all the way back so okay we're
 

2311
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,230
let's go all the way back so okay we're
really going get this the the Lexus life

2312
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:20,240
really going get this the the Lexus life
 

2313
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,349
really going get this the the Lexus life
meat Lex and Lee Lex Lee it's a good

2314

it's a good good uh good ring to it all

2316
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:25,400
it's a good good uh good ring to it all
 

2317
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,430
it's a good good uh good ring to it all
right so um you have a you have a vacuum

2318
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:28,440
right so um you have a you have a vacuum
 

2319
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,630
right so um you have a you have a vacuum
chamber you have a little nose the nose

2320
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:30,640
chamber you have a little nose the nose
 

2321
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:36,150
chamber you have a little nose the nose
would have um some a a packing material

2322
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:36,160
would have um some a a packing material
 

2323
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,990
would have um some a a packing material
so you would take your your sample add

2324
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:38,000
so you would take your your sample add
 

2325
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,549
so you would take your your sample add
it onto the nose add a solvent or a gas

2326
00:45:40,549 --> 00:45:40,559
it onto the nose add a solvent or a gas
 

2327
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:42,710
it onto the nose add a solvent or a gas
it would then be sucked up the nose and

2328
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:42,720
it would then be sucked up the nose and
 

2329
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,349
it would then be sucked up the nose and
that would be separated using Chrome

2330
00:45:44,349 --> 00:45:44,359
that would be separated using Chrome
 

2331
00:45:44,359 --> 00:45:46,470
that would be separated using Chrome
what we call chromatography and then as

2332
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:46,480
what we call chromatography and then as
 

2333
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,190
what we call chromatography and then as
each band comes off the nose we would

2334
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:48,200
each band comes off the nose we would
 

2335
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,270
each band comes off the nose we would
then do mass backc and infrared and in

2336
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:51,280
then do mass backc and infrared and in
 

2337
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,030
then do mass backc and infrared and in
the account in the case of infrared

2338
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:53,040
the account in the case of infrared
 

2339
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,430
the account in the case of infrared
count the number of bands in the case of

2340
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:54,440
count the number of bands in the case of
 

2341
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,990
count the number of bands in the case of
MPC count the number of fragments and

MPC count the number of fragments and
 

2343
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,790
MPC count the number of fragments and
weigh it and then the further up in

2344
00:45:57,790 --> 00:45:57,800
weigh it and then the further up in
 

2345
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,030
weigh it and then the further up in
molecular weight range for the mass spec

2346
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:00,040
molecular weight range for the mass spec
 

2347
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,589
molecular weight range for the mass spec
and the number of bands you go up and up

2348
00:46:01,589 --> 00:46:01,599
and the number of bands you go up and up
 

2349
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,910
and the number of bands you go up and up
and up from the you know dead

2350
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:03,920
and up from the you know dead
 

2351
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,150

00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:05,160
interesting interesting over the
 

2353
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,589
interesting interesting over the
threshold oh my gosh Earth life and then

2354
00:46:08,589 --> 00:46:08,599
threshold oh my gosh Earth life and then
 

2355
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,670
threshold oh my gosh Earth life and then
right up to bat crazy this is

2356
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:10,680
right up to bat crazy this is
 

2357
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,710
right up to bat crazy this is
definitely um you know alien

2358
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:12,720
definitely um you know alien
 

2359
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,390
definitely um you know alien
intelligence that's made this life right

2360
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:14,400
intelligence that's made this life right

you could almost go all the way there

2362
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:16,040
you could almost go all the way there
 

2363
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,829
you could almost go all the way there
same in the infrared and it's pretty

2364
00:46:17,829 --> 00:46:17,839
same in the infrared and it's pretty
 

2365
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:21,510
same in the infrared and it's pretty
simple the thing that it's really

2366
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:21,520
simple the thing that it's really
 

2367
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,510
simple the thing that it's really
problematical is that for many years

2368
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:24,520
problematical is that for many years
 

2369
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,069
problematical is that for many years
decades what people have done and I

2370
00:46:27,069 --> 00:46:27,079
decades what people have done and I
 

2371
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:29,030
decades what people have done and I
can't blame them is they've rather

2372
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:29,040
can't blame them is they've rather
 

2373
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,750
can't blame them is they've rather
they've been obsessing about small

2374
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:30,760
they've been obsessing about small
 

2375
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,270
they've been obsessing about small
biomarkers on that we find on Earth

2376
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:33,280
biomarkers on that we find on Earth
 

2377
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,990
biomarkers on that we find on Earth
amino acids like single amino acids or

2378
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:36,000
amino acids like single amino acids or
 

2379
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,710
amino acids like single amino acids or
evidence of small molecules and these

2380
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:37,720
evidence of small molecules and these
 

2381
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,190
evidence of small molecules and these
things and looking for those run looking

2382
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:39,200
things and looking for those run looking
 

2383
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,910
things and looking for those run looking
for complexity they were the Bey of

2384
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:41,920
for complexity they were the Bey of
 

2385
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,270
for complexity they were the Bey of
beautiful thing about this is you can

2386
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:43,280
beautiful thing about this is you can
 

2387
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,870
beautiful thing about this is you can
look for um complexity without Earth

2388
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:47,880
look for um complexity without Earth
 

2389
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,549
look for um complexity without Earth
chemistry bias or Earth biology bias so

2390
00:46:51,549 --> 00:46:51,559
chemistry bias or Earth biology bias so
 

2391
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:53,069
chemistry bias or Earth biology bias so
assembly theory is just a way of saying

2392
00:46:53,069 --> 00:46:53,079
assembly theory is just a way of saying
 

2393
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:55,150
assembly theory is just a way of saying
hey complexity and abundance is evidence

2394
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:55,160
hey complexity and abundance is evidence
 

2395
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,309
hey complexity and abundance is evidence
of selection

2396
00:46:56,309 --> 00:46:56,319
of selection
 

2397
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:58,270
of selection
that's how our universal life meter will

2398
00:46:58,270 --> 00:46:58,280
that's how our universal life meter will
 

2399
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,589
that's how our universal life meter will
work complexity in abundance is evidence

2400
00:47:01,589 --> 00:47:01,599
work complexity in abundance is evidence
 

2401
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,710
work complexity in abundance is evidence
of

2402
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:03,720
of
 

2403
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:08,349
of
selection okay so let's apply our life

2404
00:47:08,349 --> 00:47:08,359
selection okay so let's apply our life
 

2405
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:10,790
selection okay so let's apply our life
meter to

2406
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:10,800
meter to
 

2407
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,069
meter to

2408
00:47:13,069 --> 00:47:13,079
Earth
 

2409
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:15,710
Earth
so what you know if we were just to

2410
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:15,720
so what you know if we were just to
 

2411
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:19,349
so what you know if we were just to
apply assembly index measurements to

2412
00:47:19,349 --> 00:47:19,359
apply assembly index measurements to
 

2413
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:21,390
apply assembly index measurements to
Earth what do what what kind of stuff

2414
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:21,400
Earth what do what what kind of stuff
 

2415
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,390
Earth what do what what kind of stuff
are going to be get uh are going to get

2416
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:24,400
are going to be get uh are going to get
 

2417
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,430
are going to be get uh are going to get
what's impressive

2418
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:26,440
what's impressive
 

2419
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,549
what's impressive
L some of the complexity on Earth so we

2420
00:47:28,549 --> 00:47:28,559
L some of the complexity on Earth so we
 

2421
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:30,589
L some of the complexity on Earth so we
did this a few years ago in that um when

2422
00:47:30,589 --> 00:47:30,599
did this a few years ago in that um when
 

2423
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:32,349
did this a few years ago in that um when
I was trying to convince NASA and

2424
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:32,359
I was trying to convince NASA and
 

2425
00:47:32,359 --> 00:47:33,910
I was trying to convince NASA and
colleagues that this technique could

2426
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:33,920
colleagues that this technique could
 

2427
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,309
colleagues that this technique could
work and honestly it's so funny because

2428
00:47:35,309 --> 00:47:35,319
work and honestly it's so funny because
 

2429
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:36,829
work and honestly it's so funny because
everyone's like no ain't going to

2430
00:47:36,829 --> 00:47:36,839
everyone's like no ain't going to
 

2431
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:39,390
everyone's like no ain't going to
work and I was just like because the

2432
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:39,400
work and I was just like because the
 

2433
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,109
work and I was just like because the
chemist was saying of course there are

2434
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:41,119
chemist was saying of course there are
 

2435
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:42,750
chemist was saying of course there are
complicated molecules out there you can

2436
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:42,760
complicated molecules out there you can
 

2437
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,630
complicated molecules out there you can
detect that just form randomly I was

2438
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:44,640
detect that just form randomly I was
 

2439
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,790
detect that just form randomly I was
like re really that's like that was like

2440
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:47,800
like re really that's like that was like
 

2441
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,829
like re really that's like that was like
you know as a bit like

2442
00:47:49,829 --> 00:47:49,839
you know as a bit like
 

2443
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:52,910
you know as a bit like
a um I don't know someone saying of

2444
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:52,920
a um I don't know someone saying of
 

2445
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,710
a um I don't know someone saying of
course Darwin textbook was just written

2446
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:55,720
course Darwin textbook was just written
 

2447
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,030
course Darwin textbook was just written
randomly by some monkeys and a

2448
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:57,040
randomly by some monkeys and a
 

2449
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,549
randomly by some monkeys and a
typewriter and just for me it was like

2450
00:47:58,549 --> 00:47:58,559
typewriter and just for me it was like
 

2451
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:01,990
typewriter and just for me it was like
really and and and I pushed a lot on the

2452
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:02,000
really and and and I pushed a lot on the
 

2453
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,470
really and and and I pushed a lot on the
chemist now and I think most of them are

2454
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:04,480
chemist now and I think most of them are
 

2455
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,990
chemist now and I think most of them are
on board but not totally it re really

2456
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:07,000
on board but not totally it re really
 

2457
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,549
on board but not totally it re really
had some big arguments but the copy

2458
00:48:08,549 --> 00:48:08,559
had some big arguments but the copy
 

2459
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,190
had some big arguments but the copy
number CAU there cuz I think I confused

2460
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:10,200
number CAU there cuz I think I confused
 

2461
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,470
number CAU there cuz I think I confused
the chemist by saying one off and then

2462
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:12,480
the chemist by saying one off and then
 

2463
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,230
the chemist by saying one off and then
when I made clear about the copy number

2464
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:14,240
when I made clear about the copy number
 

2465
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,069
when I made clear about the copy number
I think that made it a little bit easier

2466
00:48:16,069 --> 00:48:16,079
I think that made it a little bit easier
 

2467
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:17,349
I think that made it a little bit easier
just to

2468
00:48:17,349 --> 00:48:17,359
just to
 

2469
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:20,109
just to
clarify chemist might say that of course

2470
00:48:20,109 --> 00:48:20,119
clarify chemist might say that of course
 

2471
00:48:20,119 --> 00:48:22,349
clarify chemist might say that of course
out there outside of Earth there's

2472
00:48:22,349 --> 00:48:22,359
out there outside of Earth there's
 

2473
00:48:22,359 --> 00:48:26,430
out there outside of Earth there's
complex molecules yes okay and then

2474
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:26,440
complex molecules yes okay and then
 

2475
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,870
complex molecules yes okay and then
you're saying wait a minute that's like

2476
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:27,880
you're saying wait a minute that's like
 

2477
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,150
you're saying wait a minute that's like
saying of course there's aliens out

2478
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:30,160
saying of course there's aliens out
 

2479
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,670
saying of course there's aliens out
there like you yeah exactly that okay

2480
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:32,680
there like you yeah exactly that okay
 

2481
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,870
there like you yeah exactly that okay
exactly but you're you're say you

2482
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:34,880
exactly but you're you're say you
 

2483
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,630
exactly but you're you're say you
clarify

2484
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:36,640
clarify
 

2485
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,790
clarify
that that's actually a very interesting

2486
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:38,800
that that's actually a very interesting
 

2487
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,630
that that's actually a very interesting
question and we should be looking for

2488
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:40,640
question and we should be looking for
 

2489
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,430
question and we should be looking for
complex molecules of which the copy

2490
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:43,440
complex molecules of which the copy
 

2491
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,630
complex molecules of which the copy
number is two or greater yeah exactly so

2492
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:46,640
number is two or greater yeah exactly so
 

2493
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,349
number is two or greater yeah exactly so
on Earth so coming back to Earth what we

2494
00:48:48,349 --> 00:48:48,359
on Earth so coming back to Earth what we
 

2495
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:50,789
on Earth so coming back to Earth what we
did is we took a whole bunch of samples

2496
00:48:50,789 --> 00:48:50,799
did is we took a whole bunch of samples
 

2497
00:48:50,799 --> 00:48:52,670
did is we took a whole bunch of samples
we and we were running Prebiotic

2498
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:52,680
we and we were running Prebiotic
 

2499
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,990
we and we were running Prebiotic
chemistry experiments in the lab um we

2500
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:56,000
chemistry experiments in the lab um we
 

2501
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,710
chemistry experiments in the lab um we
took various inorganic minerals and

2502
00:48:58,710 --> 00:48:58,720
took various inorganic minerals and
 

2503
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,510
took various inorganic minerals and
extracted them look at the volatile

2504
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:00,520
extracted them look at the volatile
 

2505
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,470
extracted them look at the volatile
because there's a special way of

2506
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:02,480
because there's a special way of
 

2507
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,829
because there's a special way of
treating minerals and polymers and

2508
00:49:04,829 --> 00:49:04,839
treating minerals and polymers and
 

2509
00:49:04,839 --> 00:49:08,589
treating minerals and polymers and

00:49:08,589 --> 00:49:08,599
assembly Theory where what in this in
 

2511
00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:10,829

our life machine we're looking at

2512
00:49:10,829 --> 00:49:10,839
our life machine we're looking at
 

2513
00:49:10,839 --> 00:49:13,309
our life machine we're looking at
molecules we don't care about polymers

2514
00:49:13,309 --> 00:49:13,319
molecules we don't care about polymers
 

2515
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:14,789
molecules we don't care about polymers
because they don't they're not volatile

2516
00:49:14,789 --> 00:49:14,799
because they don't they're not volatile
 

2517
00:49:14,799 --> 00:49:17,190
because they don't they're not volatile
you can't hold them they're not how how

2518
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:17,200
you can't hold them they're not how how
 

2519
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,829
you can't hold them they're not how how
can you make if you can't assern that

2520
00:49:18,829 --> 00:49:18,839
can you make if you can't assern that
 

2521
00:49:18,839 --> 00:49:21,069
can you make if you can't assern that
they're identical then it's very

2522
00:49:21,069 --> 00:49:21,079
they're identical then it's very
 

2523
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:23,470
they're identical then it's very
difficult for you to to to work out if

2524
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:23,480
difficult for you to to to work out if
 

2525
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:24,990
difficult for you to to to work out if
there undergone selection or they're

2526
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:25,000
there undergone selection or they're
 

2527
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,990
there undergone selection or they're
just around random mess same with some

2528
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:27,000
just around random mess same with some
 

2529
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,069
just around random mess same with some
minerals but we can come back to that so

2530
00:49:29,069 --> 00:49:29,079
minerals but we can come back to that so
 

2531
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:30,549
minerals but we can come back to that so
basically what you do we got a whole

2532
00:49:30,549 --> 00:49:30,559
basically what you do we got a whole
 

2533
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:33,309
basically what you do we got a whole
load of samples inorganic ones we got a

2534
00:49:33,309 --> 00:49:33,319
load of samples inorganic ones we got a
 

2535
00:49:33,319 --> 00:49:35,950
load of samples inorganic ones we got a
load of we got Scotch whiskey and also

2536
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:35,960
load of we got Scotch whiskey and also
 

2537
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,309
load of we got Scotch whiskey and also
got took arbag which is one of my

2538
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:38,319
got took arbag which is one of my
 

2539
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:40,789
got took arbag which is one of my
favorite whiskies which is very pey and

2540
00:49:40,789 --> 00:49:40,799
favorite whiskies which is very pey and
 

2541
00:49:40,799 --> 00:49:43,670
favorite whiskies which is very pey and
another whis PD mean is like um so the

2542
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:43,680
another whis PD mean is like um so the
 

2543
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,870
another whis PD mean is like um so the
way that on on um in Scotland in Isa

2544
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:46,880
way that on on um in Scotland in Isa
 

2545
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,069
way that on on um in Scotland in Isa
which is Little Island the the the the

2546
00:49:50,069 --> 00:49:50,079
which is Little Island the the the the
 

2547
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,510
which is Little Island the the the the
the scotch the SC the whiskey is led to

2548
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:52,520
the scotch the SC the whiskey is led to
 

2549
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:56,309
the scotch the SC the whiskey is led to
mature in barrels and um

2550
00:49:56,309 --> 00:49:56,319
mature in barrels and um
 

2551
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:59,030
mature in barrels and um
the the it said that the Pete you know

2552
00:49:59,030 --> 00:49:59,040
the the it said that the Pete you know
 

2553
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,750
the the it said that the Pete you know
the the the complex molecules in the

2554
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:01,760
the the the complex molecules in the
 

2555
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,470
the the the complex molecules in the
Pete might find their way through into

2556
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:04,480
Pete might find their way through into
 

2557
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,589
Pete might find their way through into
the whiskey and that's what gives it

2558
00:50:05,589 --> 00:50:05,599
the whiskey and that's what gives it
 

2559
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,270
the whiskey and that's what gives it
this intense brown color and really

2560
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:09,280
this intense brown color and really
 

2561
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,510
this intense brown color and really
complex flavor it's literally molecular

2562
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:11,520
complex flavor it's literally molecular
 

2563
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,950
complex flavor it's literally molecular
complexity that does that and so you

2564
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:13,960
complexity that does that and so you
 

2565
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,549
complexity that does that and so you
know vulka is the complete opposite it's

2566
00:50:15,549 --> 00:50:15,559
know vulka is the complete opposite it's
 

2567
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:17,390
know vulka is the complete opposite it's
just pure right the better the whiskey

2568
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:17,400
just pure right the better the whiskey
 

2569
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,950
just pure right the better the whiskey
the higher the assembly index the the

2570
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:18,960
the higher the assembly index the the
 

2571
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,190
the higher the assembly index the the
higher assembly index the better the

2572
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:20,200
higher assembly index the better the
 

2573
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,910
higher assembly index the better the
whiskey that's what I mean I really love

2574
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:22,920
whiskey that's what I mean I really love
 

2575
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:26,150
whiskey that's what I mean I really love
deep PT Scottish whiskies near my house

beautiful whiskey but not as complex so

2582
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:33,200
beautiful whiskey but not as complex so

for fun I took some Glen coin whiskey

2584
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:35,960
for fun I took some Glen coin whiskey

per se it is taking the yeast extract

2616
00:51:13,549 --> 00:51:13,559
per se it is taking the yeast extract
 

2617
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:16,710
per se it is taking the yeast extract
taking the extract breaking the cells

taking the extract breaking the cells
 

2619
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,069
taking the extract breaking the cells
extracting the molecules and just

2620
00:51:18,069 --> 00:51:18,079
extracting the molecules and just
 

2621
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:19,270
extracting the molecules and just
looking at the profile of the molecules

2622
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:19,280
looking at the profile of the molecules
 

2623
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,309
looking at the profile of the molecules
see if there's anything over the

00:51:20,309 --> 00:51:20,319
see if there's anything over the
 

2625
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:22,510
see if there's anything over the
threshold and we also put in a really

2626
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:22,520
threshold and we also put in a really
 

2627
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:25,069
threshold and we also put in a really
complex molecule taxo so we took all of

2628
00:51:25,069 --> 00:51:25,079
complex molecule taxo so we took all of
 

2629
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:28,069
complex molecule taxo so we took all of
these but also NASA gave us I think five

2630
00:51:28,069 --> 00:51:28,079
these but also NASA gave us I think five
 

2631
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,030
these but also NASA gave us I think five
samples and they wouldn't tell us what

2632
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:30,040
samples and they wouldn't tell us what
 

2633
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,430
samples and they wouldn't tell us what
they are they said no we don't believe

you're going to get this to work and
 

2637
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,430
you're going to get this to work and
they really you know they gave us some

2638
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:34,440
they really you know they gave us some
 

2639
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:37,470
they really you know they gave us some
super complex samples and they gave us

2640
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:37,480
super complex samples and they gave us
 

2641
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,950
super complex samples and they gave us
two fossils one that was a million years

2642
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:39,960
two fossils one that was a million years
 

2643
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,829
two fossils one that was a million years
old and one was at 10,000 years old um

2644
00:51:42,829 --> 00:51:42,839
old and one was at 10,000 years old um
 

2645
00:51:42,839 --> 00:51:45,430
old and one was at 10,000 years old um
SE something from Antarctica seabed they

00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:45,440
SE something from Antarctica seabed they
 

2647
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,230

gave us immersus and meter right and a

2648
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:47,240
gave us immersus and meter right and a
 

2649
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,870
gave us immersus and meter right and a
few others put them through the system

so I we we took all the samples treated

2652
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:52,319
so I we we took all the samples treated
 

2653
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:53,870
so I we we took all the samples treated
them all identically put them into Mass

00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,390
than say let's say 10,000 identical
molecules so the copy number is already

2666
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:09,400
molecules so the copy number is already
 

2667
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,910
molecules so the copy number is already
baked in but wasn't Quantified which is

2668
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:11,920
baked in but wasn't Quantified which is
 

2669
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,190
baked in but wasn't Quantified which is
super important there this was in the

2670
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:13,200
super important there this was in the
 

2671
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,630
super important there this was in the
first paper because I was like it's

2672
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:14,640
first paper because I was like it's
 

2673
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,589
first paper because I was like it's
abundant of course um and when you then

2674
00:52:18,589 --> 00:52:18,599
abundant of course um and when you then
 

2675
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:20,510
abundant of course um and when you then
took it all out we found that the

2676
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:20,520
took it all out we found that the
 

2677
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,069
took it all out we found that the
biological

2678
00:52:22,069 --> 00:52:22,079
biological
 

2679
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:26,430
biological
samples um gave you um molecules that

2680
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:26,440
samples um gave you um molecules that
 

2681
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,670
samples um gave you um molecules that
had an assembly index greater than 15

2682
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:28,680
had an assembly index greater than 15
 

2683
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,470
had an assembly index greater than 15
and all the abiotic samples were less

2684
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:30,480
and all the abiotic samples were less
 

2685
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,910
and all the abiotic samples were less
than 15 and then we took the NASA

2686
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:31,920
than 15 and then we took the NASA
 

2687
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,430
than 15 and then we took the NASA
samples and we looked at the ones that

2688
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:33,440
samples and we looked at the ones that
 

2689
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,630
samples and we looked at the ones that
were more than 15 or less than 15 and we

2690
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:35,640
were more than 15 or less than 15 and we
 

2691
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:36,789
were more than 15 or less than 15 and we
gave them back to NASA and they're like

2692
00:52:36,789 --> 00:52:36,799
gave them back to NASA and they're like
 

2693
00:52:36,799 --> 00:52:40,030
gave them back to NASA and they're like
oh gosh yep dead Living Dead living you

2694
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:40,040
oh gosh yep dead Living Dead living you
 

2695
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,670
oh gosh yep dead Living Dead living you
got it and um and that's what we found

2696
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:42,680
got it and um and that's what we found
 

2697
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:46,150
got it and um and that's what we found
on Earth um that's a success yeah oh

2698
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:46,160
on Earth um that's a success yeah oh
 

2699
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,309
on Earth um that's a success yeah oh
yeah resounding success um well can can

2700
00:52:49,309 --> 00:52:49,319
yeah resounding success um well can can
 

2701
00:52:49,319 --> 00:52:51,190
yeah resounding success um well can can
you uh just go back to the beer and the

2702
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:51,200
you uh just go back to the beer and the
 

2703
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,430
you uh just go back to the beer and the
eoli so what's the assembly index on

2704
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:53,440
eoli so what's the assembly index on
 

2705
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,670
eoli so what's the assembly index on
those so what you were able to do is

2706
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:56,680
those so what you were able to do is
 

2707
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:01,829
those so what you were able to do is
like the assembly index um of we found

2708
00:53:01,829 --> 00:53:01,839
like the assembly index um of we found
 

2709
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:04,549
like the assembly index um of we found
High assembly index molecules origin

2710
00:53:04,549 --> 00:53:04,559
High assembly index molecules origin
 

2711
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:06,710
High assembly index molecules origin
originating from the beer sample and the

2712
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:06,720
originating from the beer sample and the
 

2713
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,270
originating from the beer sample and the
eoli sample so the yeast and the beer I

2714
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:09,280
eoli sample so the yeast and the beer I
 

2715
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,910
eoli sample so the yeast and the beer I
mean there there were I didn't know

2716
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:10,920
mean there there were I didn't know
 

2717
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,549
mean there there were I didn't know
which one was higher we wouldn't really

2718
00:53:12,549 --> 00:53:12,559
which one was higher we wouldn't really
 

2719
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:15,390
which one was higher we wouldn't really
do any detail there because now we are

2720
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:15,400
do any detail there because now we are
 

2721
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,349
do any detail there because now we are
doing that because one of the things

2722
00:53:17,349 --> 00:53:17,359
doing that because one of the things
 

2723
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:20,390
doing that because one of the things
we've done um it's a secret but I can

2724
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:20,400
we've done um it's a secret but I can
 

2725
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,230
we've done um it's a secret but I can
tell

2726
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:21,240
tell
 

2727
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:25,589
tell
you I think it's nobody's listening is

2728
00:53:25,589 --> 00:53:25,599
you I think it's nobody's listening is
 

2729
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:27,990
you I think it's nobody's listening is
that we've just mapped the Tree of Life

2730
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:28,000
that we've just mapped the Tree of Life
 

2731
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,789
that we've just mapped the Tree of Life
using assembly Theory because everyone

2732
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:29,799
using assembly Theory because everyone
 

2733
00:53:29,799 --> 00:53:31,750
using assembly Theory because everyone
said oh that you can't do infant biology

2734
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:31,760
said oh that you can't do infant biology
 

2735
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,349
said oh that you can't do infant biology
and what we're able to do is so you I

2736
00:53:33,349 --> 00:53:33,359
and what we're able to do is so you I
 

2737
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:34,910
and what we're able to do is so you I
think there's three way well two ways of

2738
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:34,920
think there's three way well two ways of
 

2739
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,030
think there's three way well two ways of
doing Tree of Life traff uh well three

2740
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:37,040
doing Tree of Life traff uh well three
 

2741
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,589
doing Tree of Life traff uh well three
ways actually yeah what's the tree of

2742
00:53:38,589 --> 00:53:38,599
ways actually yeah what's the tree of
 

2743
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:41,829
ways actually yeah what's the tree of
life so the tree of life is basically um

2744
00:53:41,829 --> 00:53:41,839
life so the tree of life is basically um
 

2745
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:44,510
life so the tree of life is basically um
tracing back the history of life on

2746
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:44,520
tracing back the history of life on
 

2747
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:45,870
tracing back the history of life on
Earth all the different species going

2748
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:45,880
Earth all the different species going
 

2749
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,950
Earth all the different species going
back what who evolved from what and it

2750
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:47,960
back what who evolved from what and it
 

2751
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:50,030
back what who evolved from what and it
all goes all the way back to the first

2752
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:50,040
all goes all the way back to the first
 

2753
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,230
all goes all the way back to the first
kind of life forms and they Branch off

2754
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:52,240
kind of life forms and they Branch off
 

2755
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,190
kind of life forms and they Branch off
and like you have plant kingdom the

2756
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:54,200
and like you have plant kingdom the
 

2757
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:57,549
and like you have plant kingdom the
animal kingdom the fungi Kingdom you

2758
00:53:57,549 --> 00:53:57,559
animal kingdom the fungi Kingdom you
 

2759
00:53:57,559 --> 00:53:58,670
animal kingdom the fungi Kingdom you
know and different and different

2760
00:53:58,670 --> 00:53:58,680
know and different and different
 

2761
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,630
know and different and different
branches all the way up um and the way

2762
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:01,640
branches all the way up um and the way
 

2763
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,309
branches all the way up um and the way
this was classically done and I'm no

2764
00:54:03,309 --> 00:54:03,319
this was classically done and I'm no
 

2765
00:54:03,319 --> 00:54:04,829
this was classically done and I'm no
evolutionary biologists the evolution

2766
00:54:04,829 --> 00:54:04,839
evolutionary biologists the evolution
 

2767
00:54:04,839 --> 00:54:07,910
evolutionary biologists the evolution
biologists are very tell me every day at

2768
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:07,920
biologists are very tell me every day at
 

2769
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,349
biologists are very tell me every day at
least 10 times um I want to be one

2770
00:54:10,349 --> 00:54:10,359
least 10 times um I want to be one
 

2771
00:54:10,359 --> 00:54:11,710
least 10 times um I want to be one
though I kind of like biology it's kind

2772
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:11,720
though I kind of like biology it's kind
 

2773
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:14,030
though I kind of like biology it's kind
of cool but yeah it's very cool um but

2774
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:14,040
of cool but yeah it's very cool um but
 

2775
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:17,750
of cool but yeah it's very cool um but
basically what uh what Darwin and Mel

2776
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:17,760
basically what uh what Darwin and Mel
 

2777
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:18,750
basically what uh what Darwin and Mel
and all these people do is just they

2778
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:18,760
and all these people do is just they
 

2779
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,349
and all these people do is just they
draw pictures right and they they tax

2780
00:54:20,349 --> 00:54:20,359
draw pictures right and they they tax
 

2781
00:54:20,359 --> 00:54:22,030
draw pictures right and they they tax
her they just con they were able to draw

2782
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:22,040
her they just con they were able to draw
 

2783
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,510
her they just con they were able to draw
pictures and and say and say oh this

2784
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:24,520
pictures and and say and say oh this
 

2785
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:28,549
pictures and and say and say oh this
look like common classes yeah

2786
00:54:28,549 --> 00:54:28,559
look like common classes yeah
 

2787
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:31,069
look like common classes yeah
then they're artists really they're just

2788
00:54:31,069 --> 00:54:31,079
then they're artists really they're just
 

2789
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:32,829
then they're artists really they're just
you know but they but they're they're

2790
00:54:32,829 --> 00:54:32,839
you know but they but they're they're
 

2791
00:54:32,839 --> 00:54:34,670
you know but they but they're they're
able to find out a lot right looking at

2792
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:34,680
able to find out a lot right looking at
 

2793
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,589
able to find out a lot right looking at
verbit in verance caman explosion all

2794
00:54:36,589 --> 00:54:36,599
verbit in verance caman explosion all
 

2795
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:39,990
verbit in verance caman explosion all
this stuff and then um then came the

2796
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:40,000
this stuff and then um then came the
 

2797
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,309
this stuff and then um then came the
genomic Revolution and suddenly everyone

2798
00:54:42,309 --> 00:54:42,319
genomic Revolution and suddenly everyone
 

2799
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:44,710
genomic Revolution and suddenly everyone
used Gene sequencing and Craig vent is a

2800
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:44,720
used Gene sequencing and Craig vent is a
 

2801
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:45,990
used Gene sequencing and Craig vent is a
good example I think he's gone around

2802
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:46,000
good example I think he's gone around
 

2803
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,549
good example I think he's gone around
the world and his yacht just taking up

2804
00:54:47,549 --> 00:54:47,559
the world and his yacht just taking up
 

2805
00:54:47,559 --> 00:54:49,510
the world and his yacht just taking up
samples looking for new species where

2806
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:49,520
samples looking for new species where
 

2807
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,710
samples looking for new species where
he's just found new species of life just

2808
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:51,720
he's just found new species of life just
 

2809
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:55,349
he's just found new species of life just
from sequencing it's amazing so you have

2810
00:54:55,349 --> 00:54:55,359
from sequencing it's amazing so you have
 

2811
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:57,670
from sequencing it's amazing so you have
taxonomy you have sequencing and then

2812
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:57,680
taxonomy you have sequencing and then
 

2813
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,710
taxonomy you have sequencing and then
you can also do a little bit of kind of

2814
00:54:59,710 --> 00:54:59,720
you can also do a little bit of kind of
 

2815
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:03,069
you can also do a little bit of kind of
molecular um uh kind of archaeology like

2816
00:55:03,069 --> 00:55:03,079
molecular um uh kind of archaeology like
 

2817
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:06,109
molecular um uh kind of archaeology like
you know measure the samples and and

2818
00:55:06,109 --> 00:55:06,119
you know measure the samples and and
 

2819
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:09,750
you know measure the samples and and
kind of form some inference what we did

2820
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:09,760
kind of form some inference what we did
 

2821
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,870
kind of form some inference what we did
um is we were able to fingerprint so we

2822
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:12,880
um is we were able to fingerprint so we
 

2823
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,710
um is we were able to fingerprint so we
took a loot of random samples from all

2824
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:14,720
took a loot of random samples from all
 

2825
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:18,270
took a loot of random samples from all
of biology and we use mass spectrometry

2826
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:18,280
of biology and we use mass spectrometry
 

2827
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,109
of biology and we use mass spectrometry
and what we did now is not just look for

2828
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:20,119
and what we did now is not just look for
 

2829
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:22,990
and what we did now is not just look for
individual molecules but we looked for

2830
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:23,000
individual molecules but we looked for
 

2831
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,190
individual molecules but we looked for
coexisting molecules where they had at

2832
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:25,200
coexisting molecules where they had at
 

2833
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,589
coexisting molecules where they had at
their joint assembly space and where we

2834
00:55:27,589 --> 00:55:27,599
their joint assembly space and where we
 

2835
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:29,349
their joint assembly space and where we
where we're able to cut them apart and

2836
00:55:29,349 --> 00:55:29,359
where we're able to cut them apart and
 

2837
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:32,109
where we're able to cut them apart and
and undergo recursion in the M spec and

2838
00:55:32,109 --> 00:55:32,119
and undergo recursion in the M spec and
 

2839
00:55:32,119 --> 00:55:34,710
and undergo recursion in the M spec and
infer some relationships and we're able

2840
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:34,720
infer some relationships and we're able
 

2841
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,510
infer some relationships and we're able
to recapitulate the Tree of Life using

2842
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:36,520
to recapitulate the Tree of Life using
 

2843
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:37,430
to recapitulate the Tree of Life using
mass

2844
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:37,440
mass
 

2845
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,270
mass
spectroscopy no sequencing and no

2846
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:40,280
spectroscopy no sequencing and no
 

2847
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:43,309
spectroscopy no sequencing and no
drawing all right can you uh try to say

2848
00:55:43,309 --> 00:55:43,319
drawing all right can you uh try to say
 

2849
00:55:43,319 --> 00:55:46,789
drawing all right can you uh try to say
that again with a little more detail so

2850
00:55:46,789 --> 00:55:46,799
that again with a little more detail so
 

2851
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:48,430
that again with a little more detail so
recreating what does it take to recreate

2852
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:48,440
recreating what does it take to recreate
 

2853
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,190
recreating what does it take to recreate
the Tree of Life what does the reverse

2854
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:50,200
the Tree of Life what does the reverse
 

2855
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,390
the Tree of Life what does the reverse
engineering process look like here so

2856
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:52,400
engineering process look like here so
 

2857
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,789
engineering process look like here so
what you do is you take an unknown

2858
00:55:53,789 --> 00:55:53,799
what you do is you take an unknown
 

2859
00:55:53,799 --> 00:55:57,270
what you do is you take an unknown
sample you it into the mass spec you get

2860
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:57,280
sample you it into the mass spec you get
 

2861
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,549
sample you it into the mass spec you get
a because this comes from what you

2862
00:55:58,549 --> 00:55:58,559
a because this comes from what you
 

2863
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:00,470
a because this comes from what you
asking like what do you see in ecoli and

2864
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:00,480
asking like what do you see in ecoli and
 

2865
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,589
asking like what do you see in ecoli and
so in ecoli you don't just see it's not

2866
00:56:02,589 --> 00:56:02,599
so in ecoli you don't just see it's not
 

2867
00:56:02,599 --> 00:56:04,589
so in ecoli you don't just see it's not
it's not it's not the the most

2868
00:56:04,589 --> 00:56:04,599
it's not it's not the the most
 

2869
00:56:04,599 --> 00:56:07,349
it's not it's not the the most
sophisticated um cells on on Earth make

2870
00:56:07,349 --> 00:56:07,359
sophisticated um cells on on Earth make
 

2871
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:09,630
sophisticated um cells on on Earth make
the most sophisticated molecules it is

2872
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:09,640
the most sophisticated molecules it is
 

2873
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,670
the most sophisticated molecules it is
the coexistence of lots of complex

2874
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:11,680
the coexistence of lots of complex
 

2875
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,510
the coexistence of lots of complex
molecules above a threshold and so what

2876
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:14,520
molecules above a threshold and so what
 

2877
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,510
molecules above a threshold and so what
we realized is you could fingerprint

2878
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:16,520
we realized is you could fingerprint
 

2879
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:19,670
we realized is you could fingerprint
different life forms so fungi make

2880
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:19,680
different life forms so fungi make
 

2881
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,230
different life forms so fungi make
really complicated molecules why because

2882
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:21,240
really complicated molecules why because
 

2883
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,670
really complicated molecules why because
they can't move they have to make

2884
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:22,680
they can't move they have to make
 

2885
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,470
they can't move they have to make
everything on site um whereas you know

2886
00:56:25,470 --> 00:56:25,480
everything on site um whereas you know
 

2887
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,510
everything on site um whereas you know
some animals are like lazy they can just

2888
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:27,520
some animals are like lazy they can just
 

2889
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,029
some animals are like lazy they can just
go eat the fungi they don't need to make

2890
00:56:30,029 --> 00:56:30,039
go eat the fungi they don't need to make
 

2891
00:56:30,039 --> 00:56:33,510
go eat the fungi they don't need to make
very much and I um and so what you do is

2892
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:33,520
very much and I um and so what you do is
 

2893
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,430
very much and I um and so what you do is
you look at the so you take I don't know

2894
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:36,440
you look at the so you take I don't know
 

2895
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,950
you look at the so you take I don't know
the fingerprint maybe the top number of

2896
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:38,960
the fingerprint maybe the top number of
 

2897
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,630
the fingerprint maybe the top number of
high molecular weight molecules you find

2898
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:40,640
high molecular weight molecules you find
 

2899
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,470
high molecular weight molecules you find
in the sample you fragment them to get

2900
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:42,480
in the sample you fragment them to get
 

2901
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,789
in the sample you fragment them to get
their assembly indices and then what you

2902
00:56:44,789 --> 00:56:44,799
their assembly indices and then what you
 

2903
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:49,630
their assembly indices and then what you
can do is you can infer common origins

2904
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:49,640
can do is you can infer common origins
 

2905
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,910
can do is you can infer common origins
of molecules you can do a kind of

2906
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:51,920
of molecules you can do a kind of
 

2907
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:55,589
of molecules you can do a kind of
molecular um um when the reverse

2908
00:56:55,589 --> 00:56:55,599
molecular um um when the reverse
 

2909
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:57,349
molecular um um when the reverse
engineering of the assembly space you

2910
00:56:57,349 --> 00:56:57,359
engineering of the assembly space you
 

2911
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,470
engineering of the assembly space you
can infer common roots and look at

2912
00:56:59,470 --> 00:56:59,480
can infer common roots and look at
 

2913
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,829
can infer common roots and look at
what's called The Joint assembly space

2914
00:57:01,829 --> 00:57:01,839
what's called The Joint assembly space
 

2915
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:03,670
what's called The Joint assembly space
um but what let's translate that into

2916
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:03,680
um but what let's translate that into
 

2917
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,870
um but what let's translate that into
the experiment take a sample bung it the

2918
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:05,880
the experiment take a sample bung it the
 

2919
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,750
the experiment take a sample bung it the
MPC take the top say 10 molecules

2920
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:08,760
MPC take the top say 10 molecules
 

2921
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,829
MPC take the top say 10 molecules
fragment them and then and that gives

2922
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:11,839
fragment them and then and that gives
 

2923
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:13,910
fragment them and then and that gives
you one fingerprint then you do it for

2924
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:13,920
you one fingerprint then you do it for
 

2925
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,150
you one fingerprint then you do it for
another sample you get another

2926
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:15,160
another sample you get another
 

2927
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,230
another sample you get another
fingerprint now the question is you say

2928
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:17,240
fingerprint now the question is you say
 

2929
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,870
fingerprint now the question is you say
hey are these samples the same or

2930
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:19,880
hey are these samples the same or
 

2931
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,510
hey are these samples the same or
different and that's what we've been

2932
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:21,520
different and that's what we've been
 

2933
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,950
different and that's what we've been
able to do and um by basically looking

2934
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:24,960
able to do and um by basically looking
 

2935
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,390
able to do and um by basically looking
the assembly space these molecules

2936
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:26,400
the assembly space these molecules
 

2937
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,549
the assembly space these molecules
create without any knowledge of assembly

2938
00:57:28,549 --> 00:57:28,559
create without any knowledge of assembly
 

2939
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:31,589
create without any knowledge of assembly

what you can do by counting the number

2952
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:44,880
what you can do by counting the number

away their origin was got it and that's

2956
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:49,480
away their origin was got it and that's
 

2957
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,910
away their origin was got it and that's
all we do and it just works but when we

2958
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:51,920
all we do and it just works but when we
 

2959
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,549
all we do and it just works but when we
realize you could even use assembly

2960
00:57:53,549 --> 00:57:53,559
realize you could even use assembly

2975
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,910
past I would some of it is gone yeah
yeah absolutely I would love to get old

2976
00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:13,920
yeah absolutely I would love to get old

fossil samples and apply assembly Theory

2978
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:15,880
fossil samples and apply assembly Theory
 

2979
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:18,630
fossil samples and apply assembly Theory
MPC and see if we can find new forms of

to Gene sequencing cuz the DNA is all

2984
00:58:23,309 --> 00:58:23,319
to Gene sequencing cuz the DNA is all
 

2985
00:58:23,319 --> 00:58:26,789
to Gene sequencing cuz the DNA is all
gone cuz DNA DNA and RNA is quite

2986
00:58:26,789 --> 00:58:26,799
gone cuz DNA DNA and RNA is quite
 

2987
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:28,950
gone cuz DNA DNA and RNA is quite
unstable but some of the more complex

2988
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:28,960
unstable but some of the more complex
 

2989
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,309
unstable but some of the more complex
molecules might be there might give you

2990
00:58:30,309 --> 00:58:30,319
molecules might be there might give you
 

2991
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:32,109
molecules might be there might give you
a hint of something new or wouldn't it

2992
00:58:32,109 --> 00:58:32,119
a hint of something new or wouldn't it
 

2993
00:58:32,119 --> 00:58:34,670
a hint of something new or wouldn't it
be great if you if you find a sample

2994
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:34,680
be great if you if you find a sample
 

2995
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:37,630
be great if you if you find a sample
that's worth really persevering and

2996
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:37,640
that's worth really persevering and
 

2997
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:40,589
that's worth really persevering and
doing um you know doing uh the proper

2998
00:58:40,589 --> 00:58:40,599
doing um you know doing uh the proper
 

2999
00:58:40,599 --> 00:58:43,829
doing um you know doing uh the proper
extraction to re to you know PCR and so

3000
00:58:43,829 --> 00:58:43,839
extraction to re to you know PCR and so
 

3001
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:45,750
extraction to re to you know PCR and so
on and then sequence it and then put it

3002
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:45,760
on and then sequence it and then put it
 

3003
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,710
on and then sequence it and then put it
together so when the thing dies you can

3004
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:47,720
together so when the thing dies you can
 

3005
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:50,069
together so when the thing dies you can
still get some information about its

3006
00:58:50,069 --> 00:58:50,079
still get some information about its
 

3007
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:52,710
still get some information about its
complexity yeah and we can and it

3008
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:52,720
complexity yeah and we can and it
 

3009
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,270
complexity yeah and we can and it
appears that you can

3010
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:55,280
appears that you can
 

3011
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,710
appears that you can
um do some dating now there are really

3012
00:58:58,710 --> 00:58:58,720
um do some dating now there are really
 

3013
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,349
um do some dating now there are really
good techniques there's radiocarbon

3014
00:59:00,349 --> 00:59:00,359
good techniques there's radiocarbon
 

3015
00:59:00,359 --> 00:59:02,789
good techniques there's radiocarbon
dating there is um longer dating going

3016
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:02,799
dating there is um longer dating going

looking at radioactive minerals and so

3018
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:04,520
looking at radioactive minerals and so
 

3019
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:07,910
looking at radioactive minerals and so
on and you can also in bone you can look

3020
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:07,920
on and you can also in bone you can look
 

3021
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,910
on and you can also in bone you can look
at the what happens in after something

3022
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:10,920
at the what happens in after something
 

3023
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:14,309
at the what happens in after something
dies is the IM the you get what's called

3024
00:59:14,309 --> 00:59:14,319
dies is the IM the you get what's called
 

3025
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:17,910
dies is the IM the you get what's called
ramiz where the the the chirality in the

3026
00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:17,920
ramiz where the the the chirality in the
 

3027
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,270
ramiz where the the the chirality in the
polymers basically changes and you just

3028
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:20,280
polymers basically changes and you just
 

3029
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,750
polymers basically changes and you just
get you get decomposition and the rate

3030
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:22,760
get you get decomposition and the rate
 

3031
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:27,950
get you get decomposition and the rate
of the deviation from the pure po um uh

3032
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:27,960
of the deviation from the pure po um uh
 

3033
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:31,430

um en antima to the mixture you can have

3034
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:31,440
um en antima to the mixture you can have
 

3035
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,470
um en antima to the mixture you can have
a it gives you a time time scale on it

3036
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:34,480
a it gives you a time time scale on it
 

3037
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,190
a it gives you a time time scale on it
halflife so you can date when it died I

3038
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:37,200
halflife so you can date when it died I
 

3039
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,029
halflife so you can date when it died I
want to use assembly Theory to see if I

00:59:39,029 --> 00:59:39,039
want to use assembly Theory to see if I
 

3041
00:59:39,039 --> 00:59:41,390
want to use assembly Theory to see if I
can date use it date death and things

and and Trace the tree of life and also

3044
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:43,720
and and Trace the tree of life and also
 

3045
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,789
and and Trace the tree of life and also
decomposition of molecules you think

3046
00:59:45,789 --> 00:59:45,799
decomposition of molecules you think
 

3047
00:59:45,799 --> 00:59:48,309
decomposition of molecules you think
it's possible oh yeah without a doubt it

3048
00:59:48,309 --> 00:59:48,319
it's possible oh yeah without a doubt it
 

3049
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:50,710
it's possible oh yeah without a doubt it
may not be better than what cuz like the

I was just at a conference where some

3052
00:59:52,069 --> 00:59:52,079
I was just at a conference where some
 

3053
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:53,750
I was just at a conference where some
brilliant people were looking at isotope

3054
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:53,760
brilliant people were looking at isotope
 

3055
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,349
brilliant people were looking at isotope
AR wrenchmen and and looking at how life

3056
00:59:56,349 --> 00:59:56,359
AR wrenchmen and and looking at how life
 

3057
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:58,710
AR wrenchmen and and looking at how life
enriches Isotopes and they're really

3058
00:59:58,710 --> 00:59:58,720
enriches Isotopes and they're really
 

3059
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,470
enriches Isotopes and they're really
sophisticated stuff that they're doing

3060
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:00,480
sophisticated stuff that they're doing
 

3061
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,150
sophisticated stuff that they're doing
but I think there's some fun to be had

3062
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:02,160
but I think there's some fun to be had
 

3063
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,710
but I think there's some fun to be had
there because it gives you another

you get older the the amount of carbon

3082
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:26,760
you get older the the amount of carbon
 

3083
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:30,470
you get older the the amount of carbon
13 in you goes up mhm because of the

3084
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:30,480
13 in you goes up mhm because of the
 

3085
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,950
13 in you goes up mhm because of the
because of the way the metabol because

3086
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:31,960
because of the way the metabol because
 

3087
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,990
because of the way the metabol because
of the way the the bonding is in in

3088
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:34,000
of the way the the bonding is in in
 

3089
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,309
of the way the the bonding is in in
carbon 13 so it has a slightly different

3090
01:00:36,309 --> 01:00:36,319
carbon 13 so it has a slightly different
 

3091
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:38,029
carbon 13 so it has a slightly different
strength bond strength and you is called

3092
01:00:38,029 --> 01:00:38,039
strength bond strength and you is called
 

3093
01:00:38,039 --> 01:00:39,870
strength bond strength and you is called
the kinetic isotope effect so you can

3094
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:39,880
the kinetic isotope effect so you can
 

3095
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:42,870
the kinetic isotope effect so you can
literally date how old you are you know

3096
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:42,880
literally date how old you are you know
 

3097
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,829
literally date how old you are you know
uh or when you stop metabolizing so you

3098
01:00:44,829 --> 01:00:44,839
uh or when you stop metabolizing so you
 

3099
01:00:44,839 --> 01:00:46,710
uh or when you stop metabolizing so you
could date someone's de how old they are

3100
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:46,720
could date someone's de how old they are
 

3101
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:49,069
could date someone's de how old they are
I think I'm making this up this might be

3102
01:00:49,069 --> 01:00:49,079
I think I'm making this up this might be
 

3103
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:51,309
I think I'm making this up this might be
right but I think it's roughly right the

3104
01:00:51,309 --> 01:00:51,319
right but I think it's roughly right the
 

3105
01:00:51,319 --> 01:00:53,349
right but I think it's roughly right the
amount of carbon 13 you have in you you

3106
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:53,359
amount of carbon 13 you have in you you
 

3107
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:56,270
amount of carbon 13 you have in you you
can kind of estimate how how old you are

3108
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:56,280
can kind of estimate how how old you are
 

3109
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,109
can kind of estimate how how old you are
how

3110
01:00:57,109 --> 01:00:57,119
how
 

3111
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:00,029
how

yeah like you could say oh this person

3114
01:01:01,549 --> 01:01:01,559
yeah like you could say oh this person
 

3115
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:03,430
yeah like you could say oh this person
is 10 years old and this person 30 years

3116
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:03,440
is 10 years old and this person 30 years
 

3117
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:04,750
is 10 years old and this person 30 years
old because they've been metabolizing

3118
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:04,760
old because they've been metabolizing
 

3119
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,789
old because they've been metabolizing
more carbon and they've accumulated it

3120
01:01:06,789 --> 01:01:06,799
more carbon and they've accumulated it
 

3121
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:08,589
more carbon and they've accumulated it
that's the basic idea it's probably

3122
01:01:08,589 --> 01:01:08,599
that's the basic idea it's probably
 

3123
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:10,829
that's the basic idea it's probably

of of chemistry are fascinating so

3126
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:13,079
of of chemistry are fascinating so
 

3127
01:01:13,079 --> 01:01:15,190
of of chemistry are fascinating so
you've been seeing a lot of

3128
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:15,200
you've been seeing a lot of
 

3129
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:19,069
you've been seeing a lot of
chemistry examples for assembly Theory

3130
01:01:19,069 --> 01:01:19,079
chemistry examples for assembly Theory
 

3131
01:01:19,079 --> 01:01:21,190
chemistry examples for assembly Theory
what if we zoom out and look at a bigger

3132
01:01:21,190 --> 01:01:21,200
what if we zoom out and look at a bigger
 

3133
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,710
what if we zoom out and look at a bigger
scale of an object mhm uh you know like

3134
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:24,720
scale of an object mhm uh you know like
 

3135
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,270
scale of an object mhm uh you know like
really complex objects like

3136
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:27,280
really complex objects like
 

3137
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,510
really complex objects like
humans or living

3138
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:29,520
humans or living
 

3139
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,750
humans or living
organisms that are made up of you know

3140
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:31,760
organisms that are made up of you know
 

3141
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,029
organisms that are made up of you know
millions or billions of other organisms

3142
01:01:34,029 --> 01:01:34,039
millions or billions of other organisms
 

3143
01:01:34,039 --> 01:01:35,150
millions or billions of other organisms
how how do

3144
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:35,160
how how do
 

3145
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:38,270
how how do
you try to apply assembly Theory to that

3146
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:38,280
you try to apply assembly Theory to that
 

3147
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:41,390
you try to apply assembly Theory to that
at the moment um we're we're we should

3148
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:41,400
at the moment um we're we're we should
 

3149
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:44,029
at the moment um we're we're we should
be able to do this to morphology in

3150
01:01:44,029 --> 01:01:44,039
be able to do this to morphology in
 

3151
01:01:44,039 --> 01:01:46,349
be able to do this to morphology in
cells so we're looking at cell surfaces

3152
01:01:46,349 --> 01:01:46,359
cells so we're looking at cell surfaces
 

3153
01:01:46,359 --> 01:01:48,950
cells so we're looking at cell surfaces
and really try and extend further it's

3154
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:48,960
and really try and extend further it's
 

3155
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,109
and really try and extend further it's
just that you know we work so hard to

3156
01:01:52,109 --> 01:01:52,119
just that you know we work so hard to
 

3157
01:01:52,119 --> 01:01:55,029
just that you know we work so hard to
get this paper out and and people to

3158
01:01:55,029 --> 01:01:55,039
get this paper out and and people to
 

3159
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:58,510
get this paper out and and people to
start discussing the ideas and I was and

3160
01:01:58,510 --> 01:01:58,520
start discussing the ideas and I was and
 

3161
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,069
start discussing the ideas and I was and
but but it's kind of funny because I

3162
01:02:00,069 --> 01:02:00,079
but but it's kind of funny because I
 

3163
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:02,309
but but it's kind of funny because I
think the PE the the penny is falling on

3164
01:02:02,309 --> 01:02:02,319
think the PE the the penny is falling on
 

3165
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:04,870
think the PE the the penny is falling on
this so yeah so what's that even what

3166
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:04,880
this so yeah so what's that even what
 

3167
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,349
this so yeah so what's that even what
what's it mean for a penny to be I mean

3168
01:02:06,349 --> 01:02:06,359
what's it mean for a penny to be I mean
 

3169
01:02:06,359 --> 01:02:07,910
what's it mean for a penny to be I mean
no the the pennies dropped right because

3170
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:07,920
no the the pennies dropped right because
 

3171
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,430
no the the pennies dropped right because
a lot of people were like it's rubbish

3172
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:09,440
a lot of people were like it's rubbish
 

3173
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,470
a lot of people were like it's rubbish
it's rubbish you've insulted me it's

3174
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:11,480
it's rubbish you've insulted me it's
 

3175
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:13,950
it's rubbish you've insulted me it's
wrong and I'm and you know I mean the

3176
01:02:13,950 --> 01:02:13,960
wrong and I'm and you know I mean the
 

3177
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:15,390
wrong and I'm and you know I mean the
paper got published on the 4th of

3178
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:15,400
paper got published on the 4th of
 

3179
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:18,190
paper got published on the 4th of
October it had 2.3 million engagements

3180
01:02:18,190 --> 01:02:18,200
October it had 2.3 million engagements
 

3181
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,549
October it had 2.3 million engagements
on Twitter right and it's been

3182
01:02:20,549 --> 01:02:20,559
on Twitter right and it's been
 

3183
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:22,349
on Twitter right and it's been
downloaded over few hundred thousand

3184
01:02:22,349 --> 01:02:22,359
downloaded over few hundred thousand
 

3185
01:02:22,359 --> 01:02:24,430
downloaded over few hundred thousand
times and someone actually said to me

3186
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:24,440
times and someone actually said to me
 

3187
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,910
times and someone actually said to me
wrote to me and said this is an example

3188
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:25,920
wrote to me and said this is an example
 

3189
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,309
wrote to me and said this is an example
really bad writing and what not to do

3190
01:02:28,309 --> 01:02:28,319
really bad writing and what not to do
 

3191
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:31,109
really bad writing and what not to do
and I was like if all of my papers got

3192
01:02:31,109 --> 01:02:31,119
and I was like if all of my papers got
 

3193
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:32,670
and I was like if all of my papers got
read this much cuz that's the objective

3194
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:32,680
read this much cuz that's the objective
 

3195
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,069
read this much cuz that's the objective
of I have a publishing a paper on people

3196
01:02:34,069 --> 01:02:34,079
of I have a publishing a paper on people
 

3197
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:36,109
of I have a publishing a paper on people
to read it I want to write that badly

3198
01:02:36,109 --> 01:02:36,119
to read it I want to write that badly
 

3199
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:38,309
to read it I want to write that badly
again yeah I don't know what's the Deep

3200
01:02:38,309 --> 01:02:38,319
again yeah I don't know what's the Deep
 

3201
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:40,230
again yeah I don't know what's the Deep
Insight here about the negativity in the

3202
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:40,240
Insight here about the negativity in the
 

3203
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,109
Insight here about the negativity in the
space I think it's probably the immune

3204
01:02:42,109 --> 01:02:42,119
space I think it's probably the immune
 

3205
01:02:42,119 --> 01:02:44,349
space I think it's probably the immune
system of the scientific Community

3206
01:02:44,349 --> 01:02:44,359
system of the scientific Community
 

3207
01:02:44,359 --> 01:02:46,150
system of the scientific Community
making sure that there's no

3208
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:46,160
making sure that there's no
 

3209
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,630
making sure that there's no
that gets published that's and and it

3210
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:48,640
that gets published that's and and it
 

3211
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,349
that gets published that's and and it
can overfire it can do a lot of damage

3212
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:50,359
can overfire it can do a lot of damage
 

3213
01:02:50,359 --> 01:02:52,230
can overfire it can do a lot of damage
it can shut down conversations in a way

3214
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:52,240
it can shut down conversations in a way
 

3215
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,510
it can shut down conversations in a way
that's not productive we and I go back I

3216
01:02:54,510 --> 01:02:54,520
that's not productive we and I go back I
 

3217
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:55,750
that's not productive we and I go back I
me answer your question about the

3218
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:55,760
me answer your question about the
 

3219
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,309
me answer your question about the
hierarchi and assembly but let's go back

3220
01:02:57,309 --> 01:02:57,319
hierarchi and assembly but let's go back
 

3221
01:02:57,319 --> 01:02:59,950
hierarchi and assembly but let's go back
to the reception people saying the paper

3222
01:02:59,950 --> 01:02:59,960
to the reception people saying the paper
 

3223
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:02,029
to the reception people saying the paper
was badly written I mean of course we

3224
01:03:02,029 --> 01:03:02,039
was badly written I mean of course we
 

3225
01:03:02,039 --> 01:03:03,470
was badly written I mean of course we
could improve it we could always improve

3226
01:03:03,470 --> 01:03:03,480
could improve it we could always improve
 

3227
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,470
could improve it we could always improve
the clarity let's go there before we go

3228
01:03:05,470 --> 01:03:05,480
the clarity let's go there before we go
 

3229
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:08,589
the clarity let's go there before we go
to the hierarchy yeah um you know it has

3230
01:03:08,589 --> 01:03:08,599
to the hierarchy yeah um you know it has
 

3231
01:03:08,599 --> 01:03:12,549
to the hierarchy yeah um you know it has
been criticized quite a bit the paper uh

3232
01:03:12,549 --> 01:03:12,559
been criticized quite a bit the paper uh
 

3233
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:14,950
been criticized quite a bit the paper uh
what has been some criticism that you

3234
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:14,960
what has been some criticism that you
 

3235
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:19,269
what has been some criticism that you
found most powerful like that you can

3236
01:03:19,269 --> 01:03:19,279
found most powerful like that you can
 

3237
01:03:19,279 --> 01:03:23,309
found most powerful like that you can
understand and can you explain it the

3238
01:03:23,309 --> 01:03:23,319
understand and can you explain it the
 

3239
01:03:23,319 --> 01:03:25,069
understand and can you explain it the
yes the most

3240
01:03:25,069 --> 01:03:25,079
yes the most
 

3241
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:27,589
yes the most
exciting criticism came from The

3242
01:03:27,589 --> 01:03:27,599
exciting criticism came from The
 

3243
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:29,230
exciting criticism came from The
evolutionary biologist telling me that

3244
01:03:29,230 --> 01:03:29,240
evolutionary biologist telling me that
 

3245
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:32,430
evolutionary biologist telling me that
they thought that that U it origin of

3246
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:32,440
they thought that that U it origin of
 

3247
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,150
they thought that that U it origin of
life was a solved problem and I was like

3248
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:34,160
life was a solved problem and I was like
 

3249
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,670
life was a solved problem and I was like
whoa we're really on at something

3250
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:35,680
whoa we're really on at something
 

3251
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:38,150
whoa we're really on at something
because it's kinan art and then when you

3252
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:38,160
because it's kinan art and then when you
 

3253
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:39,430
because it's kinan art and then when you
poke them on that they just said no you

3254
01:03:39,430 --> 01:03:39,440
poke them on that they just said no you
 

3255
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,230
poke them on that they just said no you
don't understand Evolution and I said no

3256
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:41,240
don't understand Evolution and I said no
 

3257
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:42,710
don't understand Evolution and I said no
no I don't think you understand that

3258
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:42,720
no I don't think you understand that
 

3259
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,870
no I don't think you understand that
Evolution had to occur before biology

3260
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:44,880
Evolution had to occur before biology
 

3261
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,670
Evolution had to occur before biology
and we need there's a gap that was

3262
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:46,680
and we need there's a gap that was
 

3263
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:50,190
and we need there's a gap that was
really for me that

3264
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:50,200
really for me that
 

3265
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,269
really for me that
misunderstanding and that that did cause

3266
01:03:52,269 --> 01:03:52,279
misunderstanding and that that did cause
 

3267
01:03:52,279 --> 01:03:53,950
misunderstanding and that that did cause
an immune response which was really

3268
01:03:53,950 --> 01:03:53,960
an immune response which was really
 

3269
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:56,829
an immune response which was really
interesting interesting um the second

3270
01:03:56,829 --> 01:03:56,839
interesting interesting um the second
 

3271
01:03:56,839 --> 01:03:59,309
interesting interesting um the second
thing was the fact that physicists the

3272
01:03:59,309 --> 01:03:59,319
thing was the fact that physicists the
 

3273
01:03:59,319 --> 01:04:00,950
thing was the fact that physicists the
physicists were actually really polite

3274
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:00,960
physicists were actually really polite
 

3275
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,789
physicists were actually really polite
right really nice about it but they just

3276
01:04:02,789 --> 01:04:02,799
right really nice about it but they just
 

3277
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:04,750
right really nice about it but they just
said huh we're not really sure about the

3278
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:04,760
said huh we're not really sure about the
 

3279
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:06,990
said huh we're not really sure about the
initial conditions thing but this is a

3280
01:04:06,990 --> 01:04:07,000
initial conditions thing but this is a
 

3281
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,029
initial conditions thing but this is a
really big debate that we should

3282
01:04:09,029 --> 01:04:09,039
really big debate that we should
 

3283
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:11,430
really big debate that we should
certainly get into because you know the

3284
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:11,440
certainly get into because you know the
 

3285
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,349
certainly get into because you know the
the the emergence of life was not

3286
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:13,359
the the emergence of life was not
 

3287
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:16,109
the the emergence of life was not
encoded in the initial conditions of the

3288
01:04:16,109 --> 01:04:16,119
encoded in the initial conditions of the
 

3289
01:04:16,119 --> 01:04:19,549
encoded in the initial conditions of the
Universe um and it can't and I think

3290
01:04:19,549 --> 01:04:19,559
Universe um and it can't and I think
 

3291
01:04:19,559 --> 01:04:22,230
Universe um and it can't and I think
assembly Theory shows why it can't

3292
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:22,240
assembly Theory shows why it can't
 

3293
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,710
assembly Theory shows why it can't
be I'll say

3294
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:24,720
be I'll say
 

3295
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,269
be I'll say
sure you if you could say that again the

3296
01:04:27,269 --> 01:04:27,279
sure you if you could say that again the
 

3297
01:04:27,279 --> 01:04:29,269
sure you if you could say that again the
the the origin of the the emergence of

3298
01:04:29,269 --> 01:04:29,279
the the origin of the the emergence of
 

3299
01:04:29,279 --> 01:04:33,230
the the origin of the the emergence of
life was not and cannot in principle

3300
01:04:33,230 --> 01:04:33,240
life was not and cannot in principle
 

3301
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:34,829
life was not and cannot in principle
being encoded in the initial conditions

3302
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:34,839
being encoded in the initial conditions
 

3303
01:04:34,839 --> 01:04:36,190
being encoded in the initial conditions
of the universe just to clarify what we

3304
01:04:36,190 --> 01:04:36,200
of the universe just to clarify what we
 

3305
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,549
of the universe just to clarify what we
mean by life is like what high assembly

3306
01:04:38,549 --> 01:04:38,559
mean by life is like what high assembly
 

3307
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:41,710
mean by life is like what high assembly
index objects yeah and this goes back to

3308
01:04:41,710 --> 01:04:41,720
index objects yeah and this goes back to
 

3309
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:46,589
index objects yeah and this goes back to
your favorite subject what's that

3310
01:04:46,589 --> 01:04:46,599

 

3311
01:04:46,599 --> 01:04:49,470

time right so why so why what what does

3312
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:49,480
time right so why so why what what does
 

3313
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:51,470
time right so why so why what what does
time have to do with it we I mean

3314
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:51,480
time have to do with it we I mean
 

3315
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:53,109
time have to do with it we I mean
probably we can come back to it later

3316
01:04:53,109 --> 01:04:53,119
probably we can come back to it later
 

3317
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:55,430
probably we can come back to it later
but I I think think it might be if we

3318
01:04:55,430 --> 01:04:55,440
but I I think think it might be if we
 

3319
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:59,829
but I I think think it might be if we
have time but um I think that I've I

3320
01:04:59,829 --> 01:04:59,839
have time but um I think that I've I
 

3321
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:02,870
have time but um I think that I've I
think I Now understand how to explain

3322
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:02,880
think I Now understand how to explain
 

3323
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:06,589
think I Now understand how to explain
how um you know lots of people got angry

3324
01:05:06,589 --> 01:05:06,599
how um you know lots of people got angry
 

3325
01:05:06,599 --> 01:05:08,870
how um you know lots of people got angry
with the assembly paper but also the the

3326
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:08,880
with the assembly paper but also the the
 

3327
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,390
with the assembly paper but also the the
ramification of this is how time is

3328
01:05:11,390 --> 01:05:11,400
ramification of this is how time is
 

3329
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:14,309
ramification of this is how time is
fundamental in the universe and and this

3330
01:05:14,309 --> 01:05:14,319
fundamental in the universe and and this
 

3331
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:17,069
fundamental in the universe and and this
notion of commentarial spaces and there

3332
01:05:17,069 --> 01:05:17,079
notion of commentarial spaces and there
 

3333
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:20,230
notion of commentarial spaces and there
are so many layers on this but um you

3334
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:20,240
are so many layers on this but um you
 

3335
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,230
are so many layers on this but um you
have to become an INT I think you have

3336
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:22,240
have to become an INT I think you have
 

3337
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:25,029
have to become an INT I think you have
to become an intuitionist mathema M and

3338
01:05:25,029 --> 01:05:25,039
to become an intuitionist mathema M and
 

3339
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:28,069
to become an intuitionist mathema M and
you have to abandon platonic mathematics

3340
01:05:28,069 --> 01:05:28,079
you have to abandon platonic mathematics
 

3341
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:29,950
you have to abandon platonic mathematics
and also platonic mathematics has left

3342
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:29,960
and also platonic mathematics has left
 

3343
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:32,870
and also platonic mathematics has left
physics astray but there's a lot back

3344
01:05:32,870 --> 01:05:32,880
physics astray but there's a lot back
 

3345
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,109
physics astray but there's a lot back
there so we can go to the atonic

3346
01:05:35,109 --> 01:05:35,119
there so we can go to the atonic
 

3347
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:37,430
there so we can go to the atonic
mathematic okay there's there's A's it's

3348
01:05:37,430 --> 01:05:37,440
mathematic okay there's there's A's it's
 

3349
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,870
mathematic okay there's there's A's it's
okay The evolutionary biologist

3350
01:05:38,870 --> 01:05:38,880
okay The evolutionary biologist
 

3351
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,549
okay The evolutionary biologist
criticized

3352
01:05:40,549 --> 01:05:40,559
criticized
 

3353
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:45,990
criticized
because the origin of life is

3354
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:46,000
because the origin of life is
 

3355
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,349
because the origin of life is
understood and not it doesn't require an

3356
01:05:49,349 --> 01:05:49,359
understood and not it doesn't require an
 

3357
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:51,950
understood and not it doesn't require an
explanation that involves physics yeah

3358
01:05:51,950 --> 01:05:51,960
explanation that involves physics yeah
 

3359
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:53,829
explanation that involves physics yeah
that's their statement well I mean it

3360
01:05:53,829 --> 01:05:53,839
that's their statement well I mean it
 

3361
01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:55,670
that's their statement well I mean it
was said they said lots of confusing

3362
01:05:55,670 --> 01:05:55,680
was said they said lots of confusing
 

3363
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,630
was said they said lots of confusing
statements basically I realized the

3364
01:05:58,630 --> 01:05:58,640
statements basically I realized the
 

3365
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,789
statements basically I realized the
evolutionary biology community that were

3366
01:06:00,789 --> 01:06:00,799
evolutionary biology community that were
 

3367
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:02,589
evolutionary biology community that were
vocal and some of them were really rude

3368
01:06:02,589 --> 01:06:02,599
vocal and some of them were really rude
 

3369
01:06:02,599 --> 01:06:05,789
vocal and some of them were really rude
really spiteful and needlessly so right

3370
01:06:05,789 --> 01:06:05,799
really spiteful and needlessly so right
 

3371
01:06:05,799 --> 01:06:11,390
really spiteful and needlessly so right
because look you know um it I I I didn't

3372
01:06:11,390 --> 01:06:11,400
because look you know um it I I I didn't
 

3373
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,069
because look you know um it I I I didn't
people misunderstand publication as well

3374
01:06:14,069 --> 01:06:14,079
people misunderstand publication as well
 

3375
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:15,910
people misunderstand publication as well
some of the people have said how dare

3376
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:15,920
some of the people have said how dare

01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:18,390
some of the people have said how dare
this be published in nature this is you

3378
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:18,400
this be published in nature this is you
 

3379
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,829
this be published in nature this is you
know how what a terrible journal and and

01:06:21,829 --> 01:06:21,839
know how what a terrible journal and and
 

3381
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:24,910
know how what a terrible journal and and
I and it really and I watch people look

01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:24,920
I and it really and I watch people look
 

3383
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:28,990
I and it really and I watch people look
this is a brand new idea that's not only

3384
01:06:28,990 --> 01:06:29,000
this is a brand new idea that's not only
 

3385
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,990
this is a brand new idea that's not only
potentially going to change the way we

potentially going to change the way we
 

3387
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,190
potentially going to change the way we
look at um biology it's going to change

3388
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:34,200
look at um biology it's going to change
 

3389
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,150
look at um biology it's going to change
the way we look at the universe and

01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:36,160
the way we look at the universe and
 

3391
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,309
the way we look at the universe and
everyone's like saying how dare you how

3392
01:06:38,309 --> 01:06:38,319
everyone's like saying how dare you how
 

3393
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:40,829
everyone's like saying how dare you how
dare you be so grandiose I'm like no no

3394
01:06:40,829 --> 01:06:40,839
dare you be so grandiose I'm like no no
 

3395
01:06:40,839 --> 01:06:42,950
dare you be so grandiose I'm like no no
no this is not hype we're not we're not

01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:42,960
no this is not hype we're not we're not
 

3397
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,990
no this is not hype we're not we're not
like saying we've invented some um I

01:06:45,990 --> 01:06:46,000
like saying we've invented some um I

the way people jumped on that was a
 

3409
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,510
the way people jumped on that was a

really bad precedent for young people

01:07:29,510 --> 01:07:29,520
be falsified and explored and either the
 

3435
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:32,549
be falsified and explored and either the
theory could be destroyed or built upon

3436
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:32,559
theory could be destroyed or built upon
 

3437
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:34,150
theory could be destroyed or built upon
well what about the

3438
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:34,160
well what about the
 

3439
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:37,109
well what about the
criticism of you're just putting a bunch

3440
01:07:37,109 --> 01:07:37,119
criticism of you're just putting a bunch
 

3441
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:38,670
criticism of you're just putting a bunch
of sexy names on something that's

3442
01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:38,680
of sexy names on something that's
 

3443
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,190
of sexy names on something that's
already

3444
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:40,200
already
 

3445
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:45,670
already
obvious um yeah that's really good so so

3446
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:45,680
obvious um yeah that's really good so so
 

3447
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:48,349
obvious um yeah that's really good so so
um the assembly index of a molecule is

3448
01:07:48,349 --> 01:07:48,359
um the assembly index of a molecule is
 

3449
01:07:48,359 --> 01:07:50,750
um the assembly index of a molecule is
not obvious no one had measure it before

3450
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:50,760
not obvious no one had measure it before
 

3451
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:52,910
not obvious no one had measure it before
and no one has thought to quantify

3452
01:07:52,910 --> 01:07:52,920
and no one has thought to quantify
 

3453
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:55,950
and no one has thought to quantify
selection um complexity and copy number

3454
01:07:55,950 --> 01:07:55,960
selection um complexity and copy number
 

3455
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:59,269
selection um complexity and copy number
before in such a primitive

3456
01:07:59,269 --> 01:07:59,279
before in such a primitive
 

3457
01:07:59,279 --> 01:08:02,870
before in such a primitive
um um quantifiable way I think the nice

3458
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:02,880
um um quantifiable way I think the nice
 

3459
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:05,069
um um quantifiable way I think the nice
thing about this paper this paper is is

3460
01:08:05,069 --> 01:08:05,079
thing about this paper this paper is is
 

3461
01:08:05,079 --> 01:08:07,630
thing about this paper this paper is is
a tribute to all well not to all the

3462
01:08:07,630 --> 01:08:07,640
a tribute to all well not to all the
 

3463
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:10,910
a tribute to all well not to all the
people that understand that that biology

3464
01:08:10,910 --> 01:08:10,920
people that understand that that biology
 

3465
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,150
people that understand that that biology
does something very interesting some

3466
01:08:13,150 --> 01:08:13,160
does something very interesting some
 

3467
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,829
does something very interesting some
people call it neg entropy some people

3468
01:08:14,829 --> 01:08:14,839
people call it neg entropy some people
 

3469
01:08:14,839 --> 01:08:16,789
people call it neg entropy some people
call it think about you know

3470
01:08:16,789 --> 01:08:16,799
call it think about you know
 

3471
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:19,349
call it think about you know
organizational principles that lots of

3472
01:08:19,349 --> 01:08:19,359
organizational principles that lots of
 

3473
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:22,070
organizational principles that lots of
people were not shocked by the paper

3474
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:22,080
people were not shocked by the paper
 

3475
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,590
people were not shocked by the paper
because they' done it before a lot of

3476
01:08:23,590 --> 01:08:23,600
because they' done it before a lot of
 

3477
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,309
because they' done it before a lot of
the lot of the arguments we got some

3478
01:08:25,309 --> 01:08:25,319
the lot of the arguments we got some
 

3479
01:08:25,319 --> 01:08:27,229
the lot of the arguments we got some
people said oh it's rubbish oh by the

3480
01:08:27,229 --> 01:08:27,239
people said oh it's rubbish oh by the
 

3481
01:08:27,239 --> 01:08:29,189
people said oh it's rubbish oh by the
way I had this idea 20 years before I

3482
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:29,199
way I had this idea 20 years before I
 

3483
01:08:29,199 --> 01:08:29,829
way I had this idea 20 years before I
was

3484
01:08:29,829 --> 01:08:29,839
was
 

3485
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:33,390
was
like which one if is it your the rubbish

3486
01:08:33,390 --> 01:08:33,400
like which one if is it your the rubbish
 

3487
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,789
like which one if is it your the rubbish
part or the really revolutionary part so

3488
01:08:35,789 --> 01:08:35,799
part or the really revolutionary part so
 

3489
01:08:35,799 --> 01:08:38,030
part or the really revolutionary part so
this kind of plucked two strings at once

3490
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:38,040
this kind of plucked two strings at once
 

3491
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:40,030
this kind of plucked two strings at once
it plucked the there is something

3492
01:08:40,030 --> 01:08:40,040
it plucked the there is something
 

3493
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:41,630
it plucked the there is something
interesting the biologies are we can see

3494
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:41,640
interesting the biologies are we can see
 

3495
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:43,590
interesting the biologies are we can see
around this but we haven't Quantified

3496
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:43,600
around this but we haven't Quantified
 

3497
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,709
around this but we haven't Quantified
yet and what this is a first stab at

3498
01:08:45,709 --> 01:08:45,719
yet and what this is a first stab at
 

3499
01:08:45,719 --> 01:08:49,990
yet and what this is a first stab at
quantifying that so the the the the fact

3500
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:50,000
quantifying that so the the the the fact
 

3501
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,630
quantifying that so the the the the fact
that people said um this is obvious but

3502
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:53,640
that people said um this is obvious but
 

3503
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:57,070
that people said um this is obvious but
it's it's also um so so if it's obvious

3504
01:08:57,070 --> 01:08:57,080
it's it's also um so so if it's obvious
 

3505
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:00,269
it's it's also um so so if it's obvious
why have you not done it sure but uh

3506
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:00,279
why have you not done it sure but uh
 

3507
01:09:00,279 --> 01:09:01,470
why have you not done it sure but uh
there's there's a few things to say

3508
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:01,480
there's there's a few things to say
 

3509
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:03,189
there's there's a few things to say
there one

3510
01:09:03,189 --> 01:09:03,199
there one
 

3511
01:09:03,199 --> 01:09:07,309
there one
is you know this is um in part of Phil

3512
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:07,319
is you know this is um in part of Phil
 

3513
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:08,990
is you know this is um in part of Phil
philosophical framework

3514
01:09:08,990 --> 01:09:09,000
philosophical framework
 

3515
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,269
philosophical framework
because you know it's not like you can

3516
01:09:11,269 --> 01:09:11,279
because you know it's not like you can
 

3517
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:13,870
because you know it's not like you can
apply this generally to any object in

3518
01:09:13,870 --> 01:09:13,880
apply this generally to any object in
 

3519
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,910
apply this generally to any object in
the universe it's very chemistry focused

3520
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:15,920
the universe it's very chemistry focused
 

3521
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,870
the universe it's very chemistry focused
yeah well I think you will be able to we

3522
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:17,880
yeah well I think you will be able to we
 

3523
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:19,669
yeah well I think you will be able to we
just haven't got there robustly so if we

3524
01:09:19,669 --> 01:09:19,679
just haven't got there robustly so if we
 

3525
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:22,110
just haven't got there robustly so if we
can say how can we let's go up a level

3526
01:09:22,110 --> 01:09:22,120
can say how can we let's go up a level
 

3527
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:24,349
can say how can we let's go up a level
so if we go up from Level we let's go up

3528
01:09:24,349 --> 01:09:24,359
so if we go up from Level we let's go up
 

3529
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:26,390
so if we go up from Level we let's go up
from molecules to cells cuz you jump to

3530
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:26,400
from molecules to cells cuz you jump to
 

3531
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,829
from molecules to cells cuz you jump to
people and I jump to motoc cons and both

3532
01:09:28,829 --> 01:09:28,839
people and I jump to motoc cons and both
 

3533
01:09:28,839 --> 01:09:31,030
people and I jump to motoc cons and both
are good and and they will be assembly s

3534
01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:31,040
are good and and they will be assembly s
 

3535
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:34,749
are good and and they will be assembly s
cells yeah if we go from so if we go

3536
01:09:34,749 --> 01:09:34,759
cells yeah if we go from so if we go
 

3537
01:09:34,759 --> 01:09:38,749
cells yeah if we go from so if we go
from um molecules to assemblies and

3538
01:09:38,749 --> 01:09:38,759
from um molecules to assemblies and
 

3539
01:09:38,759 --> 01:09:40,149
from um molecules to assemblies and
let's take a cellular assembly a nice

3540
01:09:40,149 --> 01:09:40,159
let's take a cellular assembly a nice
 

3541
01:09:40,159 --> 01:09:42,189
let's take a cellular assembly a nice
thing about a cell is you can tell the

3542
01:09:42,189 --> 01:09:42,199
thing about a cell is you can tell the
 

3543
01:09:42,199 --> 01:09:43,829
thing about a cell is you can tell the
difference between a UK carot and a pro

3544
01:09:43,829 --> 01:09:43,839
difference between a UK carot and a pro
 

3545
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:46,510
difference between a UK carot and a pro
carot right the organal are specialized

3546
01:09:46,510 --> 01:09:46,520
carot right the organal are specialized
 

3547
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:48,470
carot right the organal are specialized
differently we then look at the cell

3548
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:48,480
differently we then look at the cell
 

3549
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,470
differently we then look at the cell
surface and the cell surface has

3550
01:09:50,470 --> 01:09:50,480
surface and the cell surface has
 

3551
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:52,189
surface and the cell surface has
different gellation patterns and these

3552
01:09:52,189 --> 01:09:52,199
different gellation patterns and these
 

3553
01:09:52,199 --> 01:09:54,110
different gellation patterns and these
cells will stick together now let go up

3554
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:54,120
cells will stick together now let go up
 

3555
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:55,750
cells will stick together now let go up
a level in multicellular creatures you

3556
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:55,760
a level in multicellular creatures you
 

3557
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,070
a level in multicellular creatures you
have cellular differentiation now if you

3558
01:09:58,070 --> 01:09:58,080
have cellular differentiation now if you
 

3559
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,870
have cellular differentiation now if you
think about how embryos develop you go

3560
01:09:59,870 --> 01:09:59,880
think about how embryos develop you go
 

3561
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:02,229
think about how embryos develop you go
all the way back those cells undergo a

3562
01:10:02,229 --> 01:10:02,239
all the way back those cells undergo a
 

3563
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:05,149
all the way back those cells undergo a
differentiation in a causal way that's

3564
01:10:05,149 --> 01:10:05,159
differentiation in a causal way that's
 

3565
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:06,990
differentiation in a causal way that's
biomechanically a feedback between the

3566
01:10:06,990 --> 01:10:07,000
biomechanically a feedback between the
 

3567
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,229
biomechanically a feedback between the
genetics and biomechanics I think we can

3568
01:10:09,229 --> 01:10:09,239
genetics and biomechanics I think we can
 

3569
01:10:09,239 --> 01:10:11,229
genetics and biomechanics I think we can
use a sembly theory to apply to tissue

3570
01:10:11,229 --> 01:10:11,239
use a sembly theory to apply to tissue
 

3571
01:10:11,239 --> 01:10:13,390
use a sembly theory to apply to tissue
types we can even apply it to different

3572
01:10:13,390 --> 01:10:13,400
types we can even apply it to different
 

3573
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,590
types we can even apply it to different
cell disease types so that's what we're

3574
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:15,600
cell disease types so that's what we're
 

3575
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,270
cell disease types so that's what we're
doing next but we're trying to walk you

3576
01:10:18,270 --> 01:10:18,280
doing next but we're trying to walk you
 

3577
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:19,630
doing next but we're trying to walk you
know the thing is I'm trying to LEAP

3578
01:10:19,630 --> 01:10:19,640
know the thing is I'm trying to LEAP
 

3579
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,870
know the thing is I'm trying to LEAP
ahead I want to LEAP ahead to go who we

3580
01:10:21,870 --> 01:10:21,880
ahead I want to LEAP ahead to go who we
 

3581
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:24,630
ahead I want to LEAP ahead to go who we
apply it to culture clearly you can

3582
01:10:24,630 --> 01:10:24,640
apply it to culture clearly you can
 

3583
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,950
apply it to culture clearly you can
apply it to memes and culture and we've

3584
01:10:26,950 --> 01:10:26,960
apply it to memes and culture and we've
 

3585
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,430
apply it to memes and culture and we've
also applied assembly

3586
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:28,440
also applied assembly
 

3587
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:31,070
also applied assembly
Theory to um

3588
01:10:31,070 --> 01:10:31,080
Theory to um
 

3589
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:35,470
Theory to um
CA and not as you think Cel yeah yeah to

3590
01:10:35,470 --> 01:10:35,480
CA and not as you think Cel yeah yeah to
 

3591
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:38,270
CA and not as you think Cel yeah yeah to
C not just as you think different CA

3592
01:10:38,270 --> 01:10:38,280
C not just as you think different CA
 

3593
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:40,310
C not just as you think different CA
rules were invented by different people

3594
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:40,320
rules were invented by different people
 

3595
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:43,390
rules were invented by different people
at different times M and one of my uh

3596
01:10:43,390 --> 01:10:43,400
at different times M and one of my uh
 

3597
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:46,229
at different times M and one of my uh
one of my co-workers very talented chap

3598
01:10:46,229 --> 01:10:46,239
one of my co-workers very talented chap
 

3599
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:48,390
one of my co-workers very talented chap
basically was like oh I can realize that

3600
01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:48,400
basically was like oh I can realize that
 

3601
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,910
basically was like oh I can realize that
different people had different ideas or

3602
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:49,920
different people had different ideas or
 

3603
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,790
different people had different ideas or
different rules and they copied each

3604
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:51,800
different rules and they copied each
 

3605
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,630
different rules and they copied each
other and made slightly different bit

3606
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:53,640
other and made slightly different bit
 

3607
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:56,149
other and made slightly different bit
different Celler autometer um rules and

3608
01:10:56,149 --> 01:10:56,159
different Celler autometer um rules and
 

3609
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:58,310
different Celler autometer um rules and
they and and looked at them online and

3610
01:10:58,310 --> 01:10:58,320
they and and looked at them online and
 

3611
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,870
they and and looked at them online and
so he was able to refer an assembly

3612
01:10:59,870 --> 01:10:59,880
so he was able to refer an assembly
 

3613
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:02,070
so he was able to refer an assembly
index and copy number of rule whatever

3614
01:11:02,070 --> 01:11:02,080
index and copy number of rule whatever
 

3615
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:04,830
index and copy number of rule whatever
doing this thing but I digress but it

3616
01:11:04,830 --> 01:11:04,840
doing this thing but I digress but it
 

3617
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:07,229
doing this thing but I digress but it
does show you can apply it at higher

3618
01:11:07,229 --> 01:11:07,239
does show you can apply it at higher
 

3619
01:11:07,239 --> 01:11:09,590
does show you can apply it at higher
scale so what do we need to do to apply

3620
01:11:09,590 --> 01:11:09,600
scale so what do we need to do to apply
 

3621
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:12,110
scale so what do we need to do to apply
assembly Theory two things we need to

3622
01:11:12,110 --> 01:11:12,120
assembly Theory two things we need to
 

3623
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:13,669
assembly Theory two things we need to
agree there's a common set of building

3624
01:11:13,669 --> 01:11:13,679
agree there's a common set of building
 

3625
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:16,550
agree there's a common set of building
blocks so in a Cell well in a in a

3626
01:11:16,550 --> 01:11:16,560
blocks so in a Cell well in a in a
 

3627
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,430
blocks so in a Cell well in a in a
multicellular creature you need to look

3628
01:11:18,430 --> 01:11:18,440
multicellular creature you need to look
 

3629
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:21,550
multicellular creature you need to look
back in time so there is the initial um

3630
01:11:21,550 --> 01:11:21,560
back in time so there is the initial um
 

3631
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:24,189
back in time so there is the initial um
cell which the creature is fertilized

3632
01:11:24,189 --> 01:11:24,199
cell which the creature is fertilized
 

3633
01:11:24,199 --> 01:11:25,990
cell which the creature is fertilized
and then starts to grow and then there

3634
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:26,000
and then starts to grow and then there
 

3635
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,110
and then starts to grow and then there
is cell differentiation and you have to

3636
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:28,120
is cell differentiation and you have to
 

3637
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,149
is cell differentiation and you have to
then make that caal chain both on those

3638
01:11:30,149 --> 01:11:30,159
then make that caal chain both on those
 

3639
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:30,990
then make that caal chain both on those
so it

3640
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:31,000
so it
 

3641
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,070
so it
requires um development of the organism

3642
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:34,080
requires um development of the organism
 

3643
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:37,350
requires um development of the organism
in time um or if you look at the cell

3644
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:37,360
in time um or if you look at the cell
 

3645
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,709
in time um or if you look at the cell
surfaces and the cell types they've got

3646
01:11:39,709 --> 01:11:39,719
surfaces and the cell types they've got
 

3647
01:11:39,719 --> 01:11:43,790
surfaces and the cell types they've got
different um um uh features on the cell

3648
01:11:43,790 --> 01:11:43,800
different um um uh features on the cell
 

3649
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:46,310
different um um uh features on the cell
what walls and inside the cell so we're

3650
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:46,320
what walls and inside the cell so we're
 

3651
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:49,310
what walls and inside the cell so we're
building up but obviously I want to LEAP

3652
01:11:49,310 --> 01:11:49,320
building up but obviously I want to LEAP
 

3653
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:52,350
building up but obviously I want to LEAP
to things like emoticons language

3654
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:52,360
to things like emoticons language
 

3655
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:55,510
to things like emoticons language
mathematical theorems a very large

3656
01:11:55,510 --> 01:11:55,520
mathematical theorems a very large
 

3657
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,990
mathematical theorems a very large
number of steps to get from a

3658
01:11:57,990 --> 01:11:58,000
number of steps to get from a
 

3659
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,430
number of steps to get from a
molecule to uh the human brain yeah um

3660
01:12:02,430 --> 01:12:02,440
molecule to uh the human brain yeah um
 

3661
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:04,750
molecule to uh the human brain yeah um
and I think they are related but in

3662
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:04,760
and I think they are related but in
 

3663
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:06,590
and I think they are related but in
hierarchies of emergence right so you

3664
01:12:06,590 --> 01:12:06,600
hierarchies of emergence right so you
 

3665
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,110
hierarchies of emergence right so you
shouldn't compare them I mean the

3666
01:12:08,110 --> 01:12:08,120
shouldn't compare them I mean the
 

3667
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:10,110
shouldn't compare them I mean the
assembly index of a human brain what

3668
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:10,120
assembly index of a human brain what
 

3669
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:12,149
assembly index of a human brain what
does that even mean well maybe we can

3670
01:12:12,149 --> 01:12:12,159
does that even mean well maybe we can
 

3671
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:13,470
does that even mean well maybe we can
look at the morphology of the human

3672
01:12:13,470 --> 01:12:13,480
look at the morphology of the human
 

3673
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:15,910
look at the morphology of the human
brain say all human brains have these

3674
01:12:15,910 --> 01:12:15,920
brain say all human brains have these
 

3675
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:18,270
brain say all human brains have these
number of features in common M if they

3676
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:18,280
number of features in common M if they
 

3677
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:19,750
number of features in common M if they
have those number of and then let's look

3678
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:19,760
have those number of and then let's look
 

3679
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:23,030
have those number of and then let's look
at a brain in in a whale or a dolphin or

3680
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:23,040
at a brain in in a whale or a dolphin or
 

3681
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:25,950
at a brain in in a whale or a dolphin or
a chimp panzi or a bird and say okay

3682
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:25,960
a chimp panzi or a bird and say okay
 

3683
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,709
a chimp panzi or a bird and say okay
let's look at the assembly indices

3684
01:12:27,709 --> 01:12:27,719
let's look at the assembly indices
 

3685
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:29,790
let's look at the assembly indices
number of features in these and now the

3686
01:12:29,790 --> 01:12:29,800
number of features in these and now the
 

3687
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:31,310
number of features in these and now the
copy number is just the number of how

3688
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:31,320
copy number is just the number of how
 

3689
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:32,870
copy number is just the number of how
many birds are there how many

3690
01:12:32,870 --> 01:12:32,880
many birds are there how many
 

3691
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,350
many birds are there how many
chimpanzees are there how many humans

3692
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:34,360
chimpanzees are there how many humans
 

3693
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:35,709
chimpanzees are there how many humans
are there but then you have to discover

3694
01:12:35,709 --> 01:12:35,719
are there but then you have to discover
 

3695
01:12:35,719 --> 01:12:38,870
are there but then you have to discover
for that the features that you would be

3696
01:12:38,870 --> 01:12:38,880
for that the features that you would be
 

3697
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,870
for that the features that you would be
looking for yeah and that means you need

3698
01:12:40,870 --> 01:12:40,880
looking for yeah and that means you need
 

3699
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,189
looking for yeah and that means you need
to have a you need to have some idea of

3700
01:12:42,189 --> 01:12:42,199
to have a you need to have some idea of
 

3701
01:12:42,199 --> 01:12:44,110
to have a you need to have some idea of
the anatomy but is there an automated

3702
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:44,120
the anatomy but is there an automated
 

3703
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:48,030
the anatomy but is there an automated
way to discover features um I I guess so

3704
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:48,040
way to discover features um I I guess so
 

3705
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:51,350
way to discover features um I I guess so
I mean and I think this is a good way to

3706
01:12:51,350 --> 01:12:51,360
I mean and I think this is a good way to
 

3707
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,790
I mean and I think this is a good way to
apply machine learning and image recogn

3708
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:53,800
apply machine learning and image recogn
 

3709
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,310
apply machine learning and image recogn
just to basically characterize things so

3710
01:12:55,310 --> 01:12:55,320
just to basically characterize things so
 

3711
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:57,229
just to basically characterize things so
apply compression to it to see what

3712
01:12:57,229 --> 01:12:57,239
apply compression to it to see what
 

3713
01:12:57,239 --> 01:12:59,030
apply compression to it to see what
emerges and then use the

3714
01:12:59,030 --> 01:12:59,040
emerges and then use the
 

3715
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:01,950
emerges and then use the
thing the features used as part of the

3716
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:01,960
thing the features used as part of the
 

3717
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:05,669
thing the features used as part of the
compression as the measurement of uh as

3718
01:13:05,669 --> 01:13:05,679
compression as the measurement of uh as
 

3719
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:07,310
compression as the measurement of uh as
the thing that is searched for when

3720
01:13:07,310 --> 01:13:07,320
the thing that is searched for when
 

3721
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:09,110
the thing that is searched for when
you're measuring assembly index and copy

3722
01:13:09,110 --> 01:13:09,120
you're measuring assembly index and copy
 

3723
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,350
you're measuring assembly index and copy
number and and the compression has to be

3724
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:11,360
number and and the compression has to be
 

3725
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:13,110

you have to go from assembly possible to

3728
01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:15,480
you have to go from assembly possible to
 

3729
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:18,110
you have to go from assembly possible to
assembly contingent and that jump from

01:13:32,990 --> 01:13:33,000
it is a long lineage of brains going all
 

3745
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,030
it is a long lineage of brains going all
the way back and so if we could do

3746
01:13:35,030 --> 01:13:35,040
the way back and so if we could do
 

3747
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:37,390
the way back and so if we could do
assembly Theory to understand the

3748
01:13:37,390 --> 01:13:37,400
assembly Theory to understand the
 

3749
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:39,669
assembly Theory to understand the
development not just an evolutionary

3750
01:13:39,669 --> 01:13:39,679
development not just an evolutionary
 

3751
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:42,470
development not just an evolutionary
history but in biological development as

3752
01:13:42,470 --> 01:13:42,480
history but in biological development as
 

3753
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,510
history but in biological development as
you grow we are going to learn something

3754
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:44,520
you grow we are going to learn something
 

3755
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:47,550
you grow we are going to learn something
more what uh would be amazing is if you

3756
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:47,560
more what uh would be amazing is if you
 

3757
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:50,270
more what uh would be amazing is if you
can use assembly Theory this framework

3758
01:13:50,270 --> 01:13:50,280
can use assembly Theory this framework
 

3759
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:55,070
can use assembly Theory this framework
to show the increase in the assembly

3760
01:13:55,070 --> 01:13:55,080
to show the increase in the assembly
 

3761
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:58,590
to show the increase in the assembly
index uh associated with I don't know uh

3762
01:13:58,590 --> 01:13:58,600
index uh associated with I don't know uh
 

3763
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:02,669
index uh associated with I don't know uh
cultures or pieces of text like language

3764
01:14:02,669 --> 01:14:02,679
cultures or pieces of text like language
 

3765
01:14:02,679 --> 01:14:05,510
cultures or pieces of text like language
or images and so on and

3766
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:05,520
or images and so on and
 

3767
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,470
or images and so on and
illustrate without knowing the data

3768
01:14:07,470 --> 01:14:07,480
illustrate without knowing the data
 

3769
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:08,750
illustrate without knowing the data
ahead of time just kind of like you did

3770
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:08,760
ahead of time just kind of like you did
 

3771
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:10,590
ahead of time just kind of like you did
with NASA that you're able to

3772
01:14:10,590 --> 01:14:10,600
with NASA that you're able to
 

3773
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:11,910
with NASA that you're able to
demonstrate that it applies in those

3774
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:11,920
demonstrate that it applies in those
 

3775
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:14,709
demonstrate that it applies in those
other contexts I mean and that you know

3776
01:14:14,709 --> 01:14:14,719
other contexts I mean and that you know
 

3777
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:16,070
other contexts I mean and that you know
probably wouldn't at first and you have

3778
01:14:16,070 --> 01:14:16,080
probably wouldn't at first and you have
 

3779
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,629
probably wouldn't at first and you have
to evolve the theory somehow you have to

3780
01:14:18,629 --> 01:14:18,639
to evolve the theory somehow you have to
 

3781
01:14:18,639 --> 01:14:21,310
to evolve the theory somehow you have to
change it you have to expand it you know

3782
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:21,320
change it you have to expand it you know
 

3783
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:24,990
change it you have to expand it you know
um I think so but like that uh I guess

3784
01:14:24,990 --> 01:14:25,000
um I think so but like that uh I guess
 

3785
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,310
um I think so but like that uh I guess
this is as a paper of first step in

3786
01:14:27,310 --> 01:14:27,320
this is as a paper of first step in
 

3787
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:31,189
this is as a paper of first step in
saying okay can we create a general

3788
01:14:31,189 --> 01:14:31,199
saying okay can we create a general
 

3789
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:33,750
saying okay can we create a general
framework for measuring

3790
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:33,760
framework for measuring
 

3791
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,790
framework for measuring
complexity of objects for measuring life

3792
01:14:36,790 --> 01:14:36,800
complexity of objects for measuring life
 

3793
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:39,550
complexity of objects for measuring life
the complexity of living organisms yeah

3794
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:39,560
the complexity of living organisms yeah
 

3795
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,390
the complexity of living organisms yeah
that's that's what this is reaching for

3796
01:14:41,390 --> 01:14:41,400
that's that's what this is reaching for
 

3797
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:43,229
that's that's what this is reaching for
that is the first step and also to say

3798
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:43,239
that is the first step and also to say
 

3799
01:14:43,239 --> 01:14:46,189
that is the first step and also to say
look we have a way of quantifying

3800
01:14:46,189 --> 01:14:46,199
look we have a way of quantifying
 

3801
01:14:46,199 --> 01:14:49,350
look we have a way of quantifying
selection and evolution in a in a fairly

3802
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:49,360
selection and evolution in a in a fairly
 

3803
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,950
selection and evolution in a in a fairly
in a fairly not mundane but a fairly

3804
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:51,960
in a fairly not mundane but a fairly
 

3805
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:55,070
in a fairly not mundane but a fairly
mechanical way because before now is you

3806
01:14:55,070 --> 01:14:55,080
mechanical way because before now is you
 

3807
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:57,629
mechanical way because before now is you
know this it wasn't very the ground

3808
01:14:57,629 --> 01:14:57,639
know this it wasn't very the ground
 

3809
01:14:57,639 --> 01:15:00,390
know this it wasn't very the ground
Truth for it was very subjective whereas

3810
01:15:00,390 --> 01:15:00,400
Truth for it was very subjective whereas
 

3811
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:01,709
Truth for it was very subjective whereas
here we're talking about clean

3812
01:15:01,709 --> 01:15:01,719
here we're talking about clean
 

3813
01:15:01,719 --> 01:15:03,310
here we're talking about clean
observables and there's going to be

3814
01:15:03,310 --> 01:15:03,320
observables and there's going to be
 

3815
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:05,870
observables and there's going to be
layers on that I mean with collaborators

3816
01:15:05,870 --> 01:15:05,880
layers on that I mean with collaborators
 

3817
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:07,870
layers on that I mean with collaborators
right now we already think we can do

3818
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:07,880
right now we already think we can do
 

3819
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,830
right now we already think we can do
assembly theory on language and not only

3820
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:09,840
assembly theory on language and not only
 

3821
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,950
assembly theory on language and not only
that wouldn't it be great if we

3822
01:15:11,950 --> 01:15:11,960
that wouldn't it be great if we
 

3823
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:15,629
that wouldn't it be great if we
can so the if we can figure out how

3824
01:15:15,629 --> 01:15:15,639
can so the if we can figure out how
 

3825
01:15:15,639 --> 01:15:17,590
can so the if we can figure out how
Under Pressure language is going to

3826
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:17,600
Under Pressure language is going to
 

3827
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,270
Under Pressure language is going to
evolve and be more efficient because

3828
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:19,280
evolve and be more efficient because
 

3829
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:20,950
evolve and be more efficient because
you're going to want to transmit things

3830
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:20,960
you're going to want to transmit things
 

3831
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:22,189
you're going to want to transmit things
and again it's not just about

3832
01:15:22,189 --> 01:15:22,199
and again it's not just about
 

3833
01:15:22,199 --> 01:15:25,590
and again it's not just about
compression it is about um understanding

3834
01:15:25,590 --> 01:15:25,600
compression it is about um understanding
 

3835
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,990
compression it is about um understanding
how you can make the most of the in the

3836
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:28,000
how you can make the most of the in the
 

3837
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,310
how you can make the most of the in the
architecture you've already built and I

3838
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:30,320
architecture you've already built and I
 

3839
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:31,830
architecture you've already built and I
think this is something beautiful that

3840
01:15:31,830 --> 01:15:31,840
think this is something beautiful that
 

3841
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:34,550
think this is something beautiful that
Evolution does we're re reusing those

3842
01:15:34,550 --> 01:15:34,560
Evolution does we're re reusing those
 

3843
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,070
Evolution does we're re reusing those
architectures we can't just abandon our

3844
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:36,080
architectures we can't just abandon our
 

3845
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:38,270
architectures we can't just abandon our
evolutionary history and if you don't

3846
01:15:38,270 --> 01:15:38,280
evolutionary history and if you don't
 

3847
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:39,550
evolutionary history and if you don't
want to abandon your evolutionary

3848
01:15:39,550 --> 01:15:39,560
want to abandon your evolutionary
 

3849
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:41,550
want to abandon your evolutionary
history and you and you know that

3850
01:15:41,550 --> 01:15:41,560
history and you and you know that
 

3851
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:43,270
history and you and you know that
Evolution has been happening then

3852
01:15:43,270 --> 01:15:43,280
Evolution has been happening then
 

3853
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:45,310
Evolution has been happening then
assembly Theory works and I think that's

3854
01:15:45,310 --> 01:15:45,320
assembly Theory works and I think that's
 

3855
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:46,870
assembly Theory works and I think that's
that's a key comment I want to make is

3856
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:46,880
that's a key comment I want to make is
 

3857
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:49,110
that's a key comment I want to make is
that assembly theory is great for

3858
01:15:49,110 --> 01:15:49,120
that assembly theory is great for
 

3859
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:50,830
that assembly theory is great for
understanding where Evolution has been

3860
01:15:50,830 --> 01:15:50,840
understanding where Evolution has been
 

3861
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:54,149
understanding where Evolution has been
used the next jump is when we go to

3862
01:15:54,149 --> 01:15:54,159
used the next jump is when we go to
 

3863
01:15:54,159 --> 01:15:56,390
used the next jump is when we go to
technology cuz of course if you take the

3864
01:15:56,390 --> 01:15:56,400
technology cuz of course if you take the
 

3865
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:59,669
technology cuz of course if you take the
M3 processor um I want to buy I haven't

3866
01:15:59,669 --> 01:15:59,679
M3 processor um I want to buy I haven't
 

3867
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:01,189
M3 processor um I want to buy I haven't
bought one yet I can't justify it but I

3868
01:16:01,189 --> 01:16:01,199
bought one yet I can't justify it but I
 

3869
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:03,430
bought one yet I can't justify it but I
want it at some point the M3 processor

3870
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:03,440
want it at some point the M3 processor
 

3871
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:05,189
want it at some point the M3 processor
arguably is there's quite a lot of

3872
01:16:05,189 --> 01:16:05,199
arguably is there's quite a lot of
 

3873
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:07,510
arguably is there's quite a lot of
features a quite a large number the M2

3874
01:16:07,510 --> 01:16:07,520
features a quite a large number the M2
 

3875
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:08,990
features a quite a large number the M2
came before it then the M1 all the way

3876
01:16:08,990 --> 01:16:09,000
came before it then the M1 all the way
 

3877
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,070
came before it then the M1 all the way
back you can apply assembly Theory to

3878
01:16:11,070 --> 01:16:11,080
back you can apply assembly Theory to
 

3879
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:13,550
back you can apply assembly Theory to
microprocessor architecture it doesn't

3880
01:16:13,550 --> 01:16:13,560
microprocessor architecture it doesn't
 

3881
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:16,070
microprocessor architecture it doesn't
take a huge leap to see that I'm a Linux

3882
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:16,080
take a huge leap to see that I'm a Linux
 

3883
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:18,030
take a huge leap to see that I'm a Linux
guy by the way so your examples go way

3884
01:16:18,030 --> 01:16:18,040
guy by the way so your examples go way
 

3885
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:19,750
guy by the way so your examples go way
over my well whatever is that is that

3886
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:19,760
over my well whatever is that is that
 

3887
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,470
over my well whatever is that is that
like a is that a fruit company of some

3888
01:16:21,470 --> 01:16:21,480
like a is that a fruit company of some
 

3889
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:23,870
like a is that a fruit company of some
sort I don't even know

3890
01:16:23,870 --> 01:16:23,880
sort I don't even know
 

3891
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:25,110
sort I don't even know
yeah there's a lot of interesting stuff

3892
01:16:25,110 --> 01:16:25,120
yeah there's a lot of interesting stuff
 

3893
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,629
yeah there's a lot of interesting stuff
to ask about language like you could

3894
01:16:26,629 --> 01:16:26,639
to ask about language like you could
 

3895
01:16:26,639 --> 01:16:27,910
to ask about language like you could
look

3896
01:16:27,910 --> 01:16:27,920
look
 

3897
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:30,510
look
at how would that work you could look at

3898
01:16:30,510 --> 01:16:30,520
at how would that work you could look at
 

3899
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:34,390
at how would that work you could look at
gpt1 gpt2 gpt3 35

3900
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:34,400
gpt1 gpt2 gpt3 35
 

3901
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:38,149
gpt1 gpt2 gpt3 35
4 and try to analyze the kind of

3902
01:16:38,149 --> 01:16:38,159
4 and try to analyze the kind of
 

3903
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:40,590
4 and try to analyze the kind of
language it produces I mean that's

3904
01:16:40,590 --> 01:16:40,600
language it produces I mean that's
 

3905
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,629
language it produces I mean that's
almost trying to look at assembly index

3906
01:16:42,629 --> 01:16:42,639
almost trying to look at assembly index
 

3907
01:16:42,639 --> 01:16:45,870
almost trying to look at assembly index
of in intelligent systems yeah I mean I

3908
01:16:45,870 --> 01:16:45,880
of in intelligent systems yeah I mean I
 

3909
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:49,070
of in intelligent systems yeah I mean I
think um the thing about large language

3910
01:16:49,070 --> 01:16:49,080
think um the thing about large language
 

3911
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:51,830
think um the thing about large language
models um and this is a whole hobby

3912
01:16:51,830 --> 01:16:51,840
models um and this is a whole hobby
 

3913
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,870
models um and this is a whole hobby
horse I have at the moment m M um is

3914
01:16:54,870 --> 01:16:54,880
horse I have at the moment m M um is
 

3915
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:58,070
horse I have at the moment m M um is
that obviously they're they're all

3916
01:16:58,070 --> 01:16:58,080
that obviously they're they're all
 

3917
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:02,350
that obviously they're they're all
about the the the in the evidence of

3918
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:02,360
about the the the in the evidence of
 

3919
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:04,590
about the the the in the evidence of
evolution in the in the in the large

3920
01:17:04,590 --> 01:17:04,600
evolution in the in the in the large
 

3921
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:07,229
evolution in the in the in the large
language model comes from all the people

3922
01:17:07,229 --> 01:17:07,239
language model comes from all the people
 

3923
01:17:07,239 --> 01:17:09,470
language model comes from all the people
that produced all the language and

3924
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:09,480
that produced all the language and
 

3925
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:11,270
that produced all the language and
that's really interesting and all the

3926
01:17:11,270 --> 01:17:11,280
that's really interesting and all the
 

3927
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:13,030
that's really interesting and all the
corrections in the in the in the

3928
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:13,040
corrections in the in the in the
 

3929
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:17,790
corrections in the in the in the
Mechanical Turk right sure um and and so

3930
01:17:17,790 --> 01:17:17,800
Mechanical Turk right sure um and and so
 

3931
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:18,990
Mechanical Turk right sure um and and so
that's part of the History part of the

3932
01:17:18,990 --> 01:17:19,000
that's part of the History part of the
 

3933
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,510
that's part of the History part of the
memory of the system exactly so you can

3934
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:21,520
memory of the system exactly so you can
 

3935
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:24,270
memory of the system exactly so you can
you so so it would be really interesting

3936
01:17:24,270 --> 01:17:24,280
you so so it would be really interesting
 

3937
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:26,709
you so so it would be really interesting
to basically use an assembly based

3938
01:17:26,709 --> 01:17:26,719
to basically use an assembly based
 

3939
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:29,390
to basically use an assembly based
approach to to making language in a

3940
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:29,400
approach to to making language in a
 

3941
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:32,629
approach to to making language in a
hierarchy right I think is my guess is

3942
01:17:32,629 --> 01:17:32,639
hierarchy right I think is my guess is
 

3943
01:17:32,639 --> 01:17:35,950
hierarchy right I think is my guess is
that you could we might be a build a new

3944
01:17:35,950 --> 01:17:35,960
that you could we might be a build a new
 

3945
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:38,510
that you could we might be a build a new
type of large language model that uses

3946
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:38,520
type of large language model that uses
 

3947
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:41,550
type of large language model that uses
assembly theory that it has

3948
01:17:41,550 --> 01:17:41,560
assembly theory that it has
 

3949
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:44,870
assembly theory that it has
more understanding of the past and how

3950
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:44,880
more understanding of the past and how
 

3951
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,430
more understanding of the past and how
things were created well basically the

3952
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:47,440
things were created well basically the
 

3953
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:49,430
things were created well basically the
thing with llms is they like everything

3954
01:17:49,430 --> 01:17:49,440
thing with llms is they like everything
 

3955
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:52,550
thing with llms is they like everything
everywhere all at once Splat and make

3956
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:52,560
everywhere all at once Splat and make
 

3957
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,030
everywhere all at once Splat and make
the user happy so there's not much

3958
01:17:54,030 --> 01:17:54,040
the user happy so there's not much
 

3959
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:56,470
the user happy so there's not much
intelligence in the model the model is

3960
01:17:56,470 --> 01:17:56,480
intelligence in the model the model is
 

3961
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,350
intelligence in the model the model is
how the human interacts with the model

3962
01:17:58,350 --> 01:17:58,360
how the human interacts with the model
 

3963
01:17:58,360 --> 01:17:59,830
how the human interacts with the model
but wouldn't it be great if we could

3964
01:17:59,830 --> 01:17:59,840
but wouldn't it be great if we could
 

3965
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:00,790
but wouldn't it be great if we could
understand how to embed more

3966
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:00,800
understand how to embed more
 

3967
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,470
understand how to embed more
intelligence in them in the system what

3968
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:03,480
intelligence in them in the system what
 

3969
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:05,590
intelligence in them in the system what
do you mean by intelligence there like

3970
01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:05,600
do you mean by intelligence there like
 

3971
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:09,149
do you mean by intelligence there like
you seem to uh associate intelligence

3972
01:18:09,149 --> 01:18:09,159
you seem to uh associate intelligence
 

3973
01:18:09,159 --> 01:18:12,669
you seem to uh associate intelligence
with history yeah well memory I think

3974
01:18:12,669 --> 01:18:12,679
with history yeah well memory I think
 

3975
01:18:12,679 --> 01:18:14,790
with history yeah well memory I think
selection produces

3976
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:14,800
selection produces
 

3977
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,830
selection produces
intelligence well you're almost implying

3978
01:18:16,830 --> 01:18:16,840
intelligence well you're almost implying
 

3979
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:18,270
intelligence well you're almost implying
that selection

3980
01:18:18,270 --> 01:18:18,280
that selection
 

3981
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:21,870
that selection
is intelligence no yeah kind of I would

3982
01:18:21,870 --> 01:18:21,880
is intelligence no yeah kind of I would
 

3983
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:23,470
is intelligence no yeah kind of I would
go that I would go out and live say that

3984
01:18:23,470 --> 01:18:23,480
go that I would go out and live say that
 

3985
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:24,790
go that I would go out and live say that
but I think it's a little bit more human

3986
01:18:24,790 --> 01:18:24,800
but I think it's a little bit more human
 

3987
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,430
but I think it's a little bit more human
beings have the ability to abstract and

3988
01:18:26,430 --> 01:18:26,440
beings have the ability to abstract and
 

3989
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,870
beings have the ability to abstract and
they can break Beyond selection and this

3990
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:28,880
they can break Beyond selection and this
 

3991
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,750
they can break Beyond selection and this
is what why darwinian selection um

3992
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:31,760
is what why darwinian selection um
 

3993
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,310
is what why darwinian selection um
because a human being doesn't have to

3994
01:18:33,310 --> 01:18:33,320
because a human being doesn't have to
 

3995
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:35,830
because a human being doesn't have to
basically do trial and error like they

3996
01:18:35,830 --> 01:18:35,840
basically do trial and error like they
 

3997
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,430
basically do trial and error like they
can think about say oh that's a bad idea

3998
01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:37,440
can think about say oh that's a bad idea
 

3999
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:39,229
can think about say oh that's a bad idea
W do that and then Technologies and so

4000
01:18:39,229 --> 01:18:39,239
W do that and then Technologies and so
 

4001
01:18:39,239 --> 01:18:42,390
W do that and then Technologies and so
on so we escaped darwinian Evolution and

4002
01:18:42,390 --> 01:18:42,400
on so we escaped darwinian Evolution and
 

4003
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:43,750
on so we escaped darwinian Evolution and
now we're on to some other kind of

4004
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:43,760
now we're on to some other kind of
 

4005
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,870
now we're on to some other kind of
evolution I guess higher higher level

4006
01:18:45,870 --> 01:18:45,880
evolution I guess higher higher level
 

4007
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:47,669
evolution I guess higher higher level
Evolution and and will will assembly

4008
01:18:47,669 --> 01:18:47,679
Evolution and and will will assembly
 

4009
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:49,229
Evolution and and will will assembly
Theory will measure that as well right

4010
01:18:49,229 --> 01:18:49,239
Theory will measure that as well right
 

4011
01:18:49,239 --> 01:18:51,510
Theory will measure that as well right
because it's all a lineage okay another

4012
01:18:51,510 --> 01:18:51,520
because it's all a lineage okay another

piece of criticism

4014
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:53,520
piece of criticism
 

4015
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,790
piece of criticism
or by way of question

or by way of question
 

4017
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:58,350
or by way of question
is how's assembly Theory or maybe

4018
01:18:58,350 --> 01:18:58,360
is how's assembly Theory or maybe
 

4019
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:00,390
is how's assembly Theory or maybe
assembly index different from Comm

4020
01:19:00,390 --> 01:19:00,400
assembly index different from Comm
 

4021
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,430
assembly index different from Comm
complexity so for people who don't know

4022
01:19:02,430 --> 01:19:02,440
complexity so for people who don't know
 

4023
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:05,149
complexity so for people who don't know
comra complexity of an object is the

4024
01:19:05,149 --> 01:19:05,159
comra complexity of an object is the
 

4025
01:19:05,159 --> 01:19:07,550
comra complexity of an object is the
length of a shortest computer program

4026
01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:07,560
length of a shortest computer program
 

4027
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:09,669
length of a shortest computer program
that produces the object as

4028
01:19:09,669 --> 01:19:09,679
that produces the object as

4031
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:16,350
output yeah I'm I I seem to there seems
to be a disconnect between the

4032
01:19:16,350 --> 01:19:16,360
to be a disconnect between the
 

4033
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:18,350
to be a disconnect between the
computational approach this so yeah so

4034
01:19:18,350 --> 01:19:18,360
computational approach this so yeah so
 

4035
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:22,910

other thing

4042
01:19:30,669 --> 01:19:30,679
other thing
 

4043
01:19:30,679 --> 01:19:34,270
other thing
is um assembly theory is supposed to

4044
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:34,280
is um assembly theory is supposed to
 

4045
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:38,910
is um assembly theory is supposed to
trace the process by which life

4046
01:19:38,910 --> 01:19:38,920
trace the process by which life
 

4047

01:19:40,870 --> 01:19:40,880
Evolution emerged right there's a main
 

4049
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:42,430
Evolution emerged right there's a main
thing there there are lots of other

thing there there are lots of other
 

4051
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:47,590
thing there there are lots of other
layers so so Kolarov complexity you can

4052
01:19:47,590 --> 01:19:47,600
layers so so Kolarov complexity you can
 

4053
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,790
layers so so Kolarov complexity you can
you can approximate Comm grov complexity

4054
01:19:49,790 --> 01:19:49,800
you can approximate Comm grov complexity
 

4055
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,669
you can approximate Comm grov complexity
but it's not really telling you very

4056
01:19:51,669 --> 01:19:51,679
but it's not really telling you very
 

4057
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:55,270
but it's not really telling you very
much about the actual

4058
01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:55,280
much about the actual
 

4059
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,510
much about the actual
um it's really telling you about like

4060
01:19:57,510 --> 01:19:57,520
um it's really telling you about like
 

4061
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:59,390
um it's really telling you about like
your dat your data set compression of

4062
01:19:59,390 --> 01:19:59,400
your dat your data set compression of
 

4063
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:02,149
your dat your data set compression of
your data set sure and so that doesn't

4064
01:20:02,149 --> 01:20:02,159
your data set sure and so that doesn't
 

4065
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:05,790
your data set sure and so that doesn't
really help you identify the the turtle

4066
01:20:05,790 --> 01:20:05,800
really help you identify the the turtle
 

4067
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:08,430
really help you identify the the turtle
in this case as the computer MH and so

4068
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:08,440
in this case as the computer MH and so
 

4069
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:11,110
in this case as the computer MH and so
what assembly Theory does is I I'm going

4070
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:11,120
what assembly Theory does is I I'm going
 

4071
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:14,110
what assembly Theory does is I I'm going
to say a trigger warning for anyone

4072
01:20:14,110 --> 01:20:14,120
to say a trigger warning for anyone
 

4073
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:17,149
to say a trigger warning for anyone
listening who's who loves complexity

4074
01:20:17,149 --> 01:20:17,159
listening who's who loves complexity
 

4075
01:20:17,159 --> 01:20:18,910
listening who's who loves complexity
Theory I think that we're going to show

4076
01:20:18,910 --> 01:20:18,920
Theory I think that we're going to show
 

4077
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:22,270
Theory I think that we're going to show
that AIT is a very important subset of

4078
01:20:22,270 --> 01:20:22,280
that AIT is a very important subset of
 

4079
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:24,590
that AIT is a very important subset of
assembly Theory because here's what

4080
01:20:24,590 --> 01:20:24,600
assembly Theory because here's what
 

4081
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:27,669
assembly Theory because here's what
happens that um I think that assembly

4082
01:20:27,669 --> 01:20:27,679
happens that um I think that assembly
 

4083
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:31,310
happens that um I think that assembly
Theory allows us to build um go

4084
01:20:31,310 --> 01:20:31,320
Theory allows us to build um go
 

4085
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:32,510
Theory allows us to build um go
understand when with selections

4086
01:20:32,510 --> 01:20:32,520
understand when with selections
 

4087
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:35,430
understand when with selections
occurring selection produces um

4088
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:35,440
occurring selection produces um
 

4089
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:37,750
occurring selection produces um
factories and things factories in the

4090
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:37,760
factories and things factories in the
 

4091
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,790

End Produce computers and you can go

4092
01:20:39,790 --> 01:20:39,800
End Produce computers and you can go
 

4093
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:41,350
End Produce computers and you can go
then algorithmic information Theory

4094
01:20:41,350 --> 01:20:41,360
then algorithmic information Theory
 

4095
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:43,870
then algorithmic information Theory
comes out of that the frustration I've

4096
01:20:43,870 --> 01:20:43,880
comes out of that the frustration I've
 

4097
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:46,390
comes out of that the frustration I've
had with with looking at life through

4098
01:20:46,390 --> 01:20:46,400
had with with looking at life through
 

4099
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:48,070
had with with looking at life through
this kind of information theory is it

4100
01:20:48,070 --> 01:20:48,080
this kind of information theory is it
 

4101
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:51,270
this kind of information theory is it
doesn't take into account causation so

4102
01:20:51,270 --> 01:20:51,280
doesn't take into account causation so
 

4103
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,669
doesn't take into account causation so
the main difference between assembly

4104
01:20:53,669 --> 01:20:53,679
the main difference between assembly
 

4105
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:55,629
the main difference between assembly
Theory and all these complexity measures

4106
01:20:55,629 --> 01:20:55,639
Theory and all these complexity measures
 

4107
01:20:55,639 --> 01:20:59,510
Theory and all these complexity measures
is there's no C or chain yeah and I

4108
01:20:59,510 --> 01:20:59,520
is there's no C or chain yeah and I
 

4109
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,189
is there's no C or chain yeah and I
think that's the main the causal chain

4110
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:01,199
think that's the main the causal chain
 

4111
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:05,310
think that's the main the causal chain
is at the at the at the core of uh

4112
01:21:05,310 --> 01:21:05,320
is at the at the at the core of uh
 

4113
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:07,470
is at the at the at the core of uh
assembly Theory exactly and if you're if

4114
01:21:07,470 --> 01:21:07,480
assembly Theory exactly and if you're if
 

4115
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:08,990
assembly Theory exactly and if you're if
you've got all your data in a computer

4116
01:21:08,990 --> 01:21:09,000
you've got all your data in a computer
 

4117
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,709
you've got all your data in a computer
memory all the data is the same you can

4118
01:21:10,709 --> 01:21:10,719
memory all the data is the same you can
 

4119
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:12,550
memory all the data is the same you can
access it in the same way there's you

4120
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:12,560
access it in the same way there's you
 

4121
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:15,350
access it in the same way there's you
don't care you just compress it and and

4122
01:21:15,350 --> 01:21:15,360
don't care you just compress it and and
 

4123
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:16,830
don't care you just compress it and and
uh you either look at the program

4124
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:16,840
uh you either look at the program
 

4125
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:20,070
uh you either look at the program
runtime or the shortest program and that

4126
01:21:20,070 --> 01:21:20,080
runtime or the shortest program and that
 

4127
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,070
runtime or the shortest program and that
for

4128
01:21:21,070 --> 01:21:21,080
for
 

4129
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:23,390
for
me it can it

4130
01:21:23,390 --> 01:21:23,400
me it can it
 

4131
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:24,510
me it can it
is

4132
01:21:24,510 --> 01:21:24,520
is
 

4133
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:27,350
is
absolutely not capturing What It Is What

4134
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:27,360
absolutely not capturing What It Is What
 

4135
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:29,070
absolutely not capturing What It Is What
It selection does but assembly Theory

4136
01:21:29,070 --> 01:21:29,080
It selection does but assembly Theory
 

4137
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:31,790
It selection does but assembly Theory
looks at objects it doesn't have

4138
01:21:31,790 --> 01:21:31,800
looks at objects it doesn't have
 

4139
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:35,270
looks at objects it doesn't have
information about the object history

4140
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:35,280
information about the object history
 

4141
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:38,910
information about the object history
it's going to try to infer that

4142
01:21:38,910 --> 01:21:38,920
it's going to try to infer that
 

4143
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:41,870
it's going to try to infer that
history by uh looking for the shortest

4144
01:21:41,870 --> 01:21:41,880
history by uh looking for the shortest
 

4145
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:44,430
history by uh looking for the shortest
history right the object the object

4146
01:21:44,430 --> 01:21:44,440
history right the object the object
 

4147
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:48,070
history right the object the object
doesn't like uh have a a Wikipedia page

4148
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:48,080
doesn't like uh have a a Wikipedia page
 

4149
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:50,550
doesn't like uh have a a Wikipedia page
that goes with it history I would say it

4150
01:21:50,550 --> 01:21:50,560
that goes with it history I would say it
 

4151
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:52,910
that goes with it history I would say it
does in a way and it is fascinating look

4152
01:21:52,910 --> 01:21:52,920
does in a way and it is fascinating look
 

4153
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:55,910
does in a way and it is fascinating look
at so if you've just got the object mhm

4154
01:21:55,910 --> 01:21:55,920
at so if you've just got the object mhm
 

4155
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:57,270
at so if you've just got the object mhm
and you have no other information about

4156
01:21:57,270 --> 01:21:57,280
and you have no other information about
 

4157
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:58,629
and you have no other information about
the object what assembly Theory allows

4158
01:21:58,629 --> 01:21:58,639
the object what assembly Theory allows
 

4159
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:00,830
the object what assembly Theory allows
you to do with just with the object is

4160
01:22:00,830 --> 01:22:00,840
you to do with just with the object is
 

4161
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:03,950
you to do with just with the object is
to and and the the word infer is correct

4162
01:22:03,950 --> 01:22:03,960
to and and the the word infer is correct
 

4163
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:06,149
to and and the the word infer is correct
I agree infer so you like say well

4164
01:22:06,149 --> 01:22:06,159
I agree infer so you like say well
 

4165
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:07,870
I agree infer so you like say well
that's not the that's not the history

4166
01:22:07,870 --> 01:22:07,880
that's not the that's not the history
 

4167
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:09,229
that's not the that's not the history
but but something really interesting

4168
01:22:09,229 --> 01:22:09,239
but but something really interesting
 

4169
01:22:09,239 --> 01:22:12,350
but but something really interesting
comes from this the shortest path is

4170
01:22:12,350 --> 01:22:12,360
comes from this the shortest path is
 

4171
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,750
comes from this the shortest path is
inferred from the object that is the

4172
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:14,760
inferred from the object that is the
 

4173
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:17,550
inferred from the object that is the
worst case scenario if you have no

4174
01:22:17,550 --> 01:22:17,560
worst case scenario if you have no
 

4175
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:20,149
worst case scenario if you have no
machine to make it so that tells you

4176
01:22:20,149 --> 01:22:20,159
machine to make it so that tells you
 

4177
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:22,590
machine to make it so that tells you
about the depth of that object in time

4178
01:22:22,590 --> 01:22:22,600
about the depth of that object in time
 

4179
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:25,110
about the depth of that object in time
mhm and so what assembly Theory allows

4180
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:25,120
mhm and so what assembly Theory allows
 

4181
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:27,270
mhm and so what assembly Theory allows
you to do is without considering any

4182
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:27,280
you to do is without considering any
 

4183
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:29,310
you to do is without considering any
other circumstances to say from this

4184
01:22:29,310 --> 01:22:29,320
other circumstances to say from this
 

4185
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:32,149
other circumstances to say from this
object how deep is this object in time

4186
01:22:32,149 --> 01:22:32,159
object how deep is this object in time
 

4187
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:34,550
object how deep is this object in time
if um we just treat the object as itself

4188
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:34,560
if um we just treat the object as itself
 

4189
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:37,910
if um we just treat the object as itself
without any other any other constraints

4190
01:22:37,910 --> 01:22:37,920
without any other any other constraints
 

4191
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,350
without any other any other constraints
and that's super powerful because the

4192
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:39,360
and that's super powerful because the
 

4193
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,430
and that's super powerful because the
shortest path then says allows you to

4194
01:22:41,430 --> 01:22:41,440
shortest path then says allows you to
 

4195
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:43,830
shortest path then says allows you to
say oh this object wasn't just created

4196
01:22:43,830 --> 01:22:43,840
say oh this object wasn't just created
 

4197
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,709
say oh this object wasn't just created
randomly there was a process and so

4198
01:22:46,709 --> 01:22:46,719
randomly there was a process and so
 

4199
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:49,470
randomly there was a process and so
assembly theory is not meant to you know

4200
01:22:49,470 --> 01:22:49,480
assembly theory is not meant to you know
 

4201
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:53,990
assembly theory is not meant to you know
one up AIT or to ignore the factory it's

4202
01:22:53,990 --> 01:22:54,000
one up AIT or to ignore the factory it's
 

4203
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,310
one up AIT or to ignore the factory it's
just to say it's just to say hey there

just to say it's just to say hey there
 

4205

just to say it's just to say hey there
was a factory mhm that and how big was

computationally very difficult to

4212
01:23:06,510 --> 01:23:06,520
computationally very difficult to
 

4213
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:09,149
computationally very difficult to
compute uh that history right for

4214
01:23:09,149 --> 01:23:09,159
compute uh that history right for
 

4215
01:23:09,159 --> 01:23:12,189
compute uh that history right for
complex objects it it is and becomes

4216
01:23:12,189 --> 01:23:12,199
complex objects it it is and becomes
 

4217
01:23:12,199 --> 01:23:14,110
complex objects it it is and becomes
harder one of the thing that's super

4218
01:23:14,110 --> 01:23:14,120
harder one of the thing that's super
 

4219
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:16,750
harder one of the thing that's super
nice is that um it constrains your

4220
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:16,760
nice is that um it constrains your
 

4221
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:19,229
nice is that um it constrains your
initial conditions right it constrains

4222
01:23:19,229 --> 01:23:19,239
initial conditions right it constrains
 

4223
01:23:19,239 --> 01:23:21,390
initial conditions right it constrains
where you're going to be so if you take

4224
01:23:21,390 --> 01:23:21,400
where you're going to be so if you take
 

4225
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:23,310
where you're going to be so if you take
say imagine so one of the things we're

4226
01:23:23,310 --> 01:23:23,320
say imagine so one of the things we're
 

4227
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:25,390
say imagine so one of the things we're
doing right now is applying assembly

4228
01:23:25,390 --> 01:23:25,400
doing right now is applying assembly
 

4229
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:28,070
doing right now is applying assembly
Theory to drug Discovery MH now what

4230
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:28,080
Theory to drug Discovery MH now what
 

4231
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,310
Theory to drug Discovery MH now what
everyone's doing right now is taking all

4232
01:23:29,310 --> 01:23:29,320
everyone's doing right now is taking all
 

4233
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:31,430
everyone's doing right now is taking all
the proteins and looking at the proteins

4234
01:23:31,430 --> 01:23:31,440
the proteins and looking at the proteins
 

4235
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:33,510
the proteins and looking at the proteins
and and looking at molecules do with

4236
01:23:33,510 --> 01:23:33,520
and and looking at molecules do with
 

4237
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:35,870
and and looking at molecules do with
proteins why not instead take the mo

4238
01:23:35,870 --> 01:23:35,880
proteins why not instead take the mo
 

4239
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:38,510
proteins why not instead take the mo
look at the molecules that are involved

4240
01:23:38,510 --> 01:23:38,520
look at the molecules that are involved
 

4241
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:41,070
look at the molecules that are involved
interacting with the receptors over time

4242
01:23:41,070 --> 01:23:41,080
interacting with the receptors over time
 

4243
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:43,030
interacting with the receptors over time
rather thinking about and use the

4244
01:23:43,030 --> 01:23:43,040
rather thinking about and use the
 

4245
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:45,189
rather thinking about and use the
molecules evolve over time as a proxy

4246
01:23:45,189 --> 01:23:45,199
molecules evolve over time as a proxy
 

4247
01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:47,669
molecules evolve over time as a proxy
for how the proteins evolved over time

4248
01:23:47,669 --> 01:23:47,679
for how the proteins evolved over time
 

4249
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:50,229
for how the proteins evolved over time
and then use that to constrain your drug

4250
01:23:50,229 --> 01:23:50,239
and then use that to constrain your drug
 

4251
01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:52,470
and then use that to constrain your drug
Discovery process you flip the problem

4252
01:23:52,470 --> 01:23:52,480
Discovery process you flip the problem
 

4253
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:56,270
Discovery process you flip the problem
180 and focus on the molecule Evolution

4254
01:23:56,270 --> 01:23:56,280
180 and focus on the molecule Evolution
 

4255
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:58,350
180 and focus on the molecule Evolution
rather than the protein and so you can

4256
01:23:58,350 --> 01:23:58,360
rather than the protein and so you can
 

4257
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:00,910
rather than the protein and so you can
guess in the future what might happen so

4258
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:00,920
guess in the future what might happen so
 

4259
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:02,990
guess in the future what might happen so
that so that so you rather than having

4260
01:24:02,990 --> 01:24:03,000
that so that so you rather than having
 

4261
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,030
that so that so you rather than having
to consider all possible molecules you

4262
01:24:05,030 --> 01:24:05,040
to consider all possible molecules you
 

4263
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,510
to consider all possible molecules you
know where to focus and that's the same

4264
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:07,520
know where to focus and that's the same
 

4265
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:08,950
know where to focus and that's the same
thing if you're looking at in assembly

4266
01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:08,960
thing if you're looking at in assembly
 

4267
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:11,830
thing if you're looking at in assembly

you made isn't don't you have to

4282
01:24:25,990 --> 01:24:26,000
you made isn't don't you have to
 

4283
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,149
you made isn't don't you have to
simulate all of chemistry

4284
01:24:28,149 --> 01:24:28,159
simulate all of chemistry
 

4285
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:30,830
simulate all of chemistry
for uh to figure out how to come up with

4286
01:24:30,830 --> 01:24:30,840
for uh to figure out how to come up with

01:24:34,229 --> 01:24:34,239
con constraints no the molecules and the
 

4289
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:35,790

no I mean I don't I don't know enough

4290
01:24:35,790 --> 01:24:35,800
no I mean I don't I don't know enough
 

4291
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:38,629
no I mean I don't I don't know enough
about protein well this is another thing

4292
01:24:38,629 --> 01:24:38,639
about protein well this is another thing
 

4293
01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:40,510
about protein well this is another thing
that I think causes because this paper

4294
01:24:40,510 --> 01:24:40,520
that I think causes because this paper
 

4295
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:41,910
that I think causes because this paper
goes across so many boundaries so

4296
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:41,920
goes across so many boundaries so
 

4297
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:44,590
goes across so many boundaries so
chemists have looked at this and said um

4298
01:24:44,590 --> 01:24:44,600
chemists have looked at this and said um
 

4299
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:46,390
chemists have looked at this and said um
this is not a this is not a react this

4300
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:46,400
this is not a this is not a react this
 

4301
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:48,350
this is not a this is not a react this
is not correct reaction it's like no

4302
01:24:48,350 --> 01:24:48,360
is not correct reaction it's like no
 

4303
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:51,350
is not correct reaction it's like no
it's a

4304
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:51,360

 

4305
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:54,510

graph sure there's there's uh uh

4306
01:24:54,510 --> 01:24:54,520

4308
01:24:56,030 --> 01:24:56,040

examples here on chemistry yeah and so

4310
01:24:59,950 --> 01:24:59,960
examples here on chemistry yeah and so
 

4311
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:01,229
examples here on chemistry yeah and so
and what you do is you look at the

4312
01:25:01,229 --> 01:25:01,239
and what you do is you look at the
 

4313
01:25:01,239 --> 01:25:04,070
and what you do is you look at the
minimal constraints on that graph of

4314
01:25:04,070 --> 01:25:04,080
minimal constraints on that graph of
 

4315
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:06,310
minimal constraints on that graph of
course it has some mapping to the

4316
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:06,320
course it has some mapping to the
 

4317
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:08,830
course it has some mapping to the
synthesis but actually you don't have to

4318
01:25:08,830 --> 01:25:08,840
synthesis but actually you don't have to
 

4319
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:10,950
synthesis but actually you don't have to
know all of chemistry you just have to

4320
01:25:10,950 --> 01:25:10,960
know all of chemistry you just have to
 

4321
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:12,830
know all of chemistry you just have to
you can build up the constraint space

4322
01:25:12,830 --> 01:25:12,840
you can build up the constraint space
 

4323
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:16,390
you can build up the constraint space
rather nicely MH um but this is just at

4324
01:25:16,390 --> 01:25:16,400
rather nicely MH um but this is just at
 

4325
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:17,669
rather nicely MH um but this is just at
the beginning right there are so many

4326
01:25:17,669 --> 01:25:17,679
the beginning right there are so many
 

4327
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:19,229
the beginning right there are so many
directions as could go in and as I said

4328
01:25:19,229 --> 01:25:19,239
directions as could go in and as I said
 

4329
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:21,229
directions as could go in and as I said
it it could all be wrong but hopefully

4330
01:25:21,229 --> 01:25:21,239
it it could all be wrong but hopefully
 

4331
01:25:21,239 --> 01:25:23,149
it it could all be wrong but hopefully
it's less wrong what about the little

4332
01:25:23,149 --> 01:25:23,159
it's less wrong what about the little
 

4333
01:25:23,159 --> 01:25:27,229
it's less wrong what about the little
criticism I saw of do you

4334
01:25:27,229 --> 01:25:27,239
criticism I saw of do you
 

4335
01:25:27,239 --> 01:25:29,629
criticism I saw of do you
uh by way of question do you consider

4336
01:25:29,629 --> 01:25:29,639
uh by way of question do you consider
 

4337
01:25:29,639 --> 01:25:31,470
uh by way of question do you consider
the different probabilities of each

4338
01:25:31,470 --> 01:25:31,480
the different probabilities of each
 

4339
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:33,830
the different probabilities of each
reaction in the chain so like that there

4340
01:25:33,830 --> 01:25:33,840
reaction in the chain so like that there
 

4341
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:36,070
reaction in the chain so like that there
could be

4342
01:25:36,070 --> 01:25:36,080
could be
 

4343
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:38,510
could be
different when you look at a chain of

4344
01:25:38,510 --> 01:25:38,520
different when you look at a chain of
 

4345
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:40,790
different when you look at a chain of
events that led up to the creation of an

4346
01:25:40,790 --> 01:25:40,800
events that led up to the creation of an
 

4347
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:44,070
events that led up to the creation of an
object doesn't it matter that some parts

4348
01:25:44,070 --> 01:25:44,080
object doesn't it matter that some parts
 

4349
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:46,870
object doesn't it matter that some parts
in the chain are less likely than others

4350
01:25:46,870 --> 01:25:46,880
in the chain are less likely than others
 

4351
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:49,470
in the chain are less likely than others
no it doesn't matter no no well let's go

4352
01:25:49,470 --> 01:25:49,480
no it doesn't matter no no well let's go
 

4353
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:52,790
no it doesn't matter no no well let's go
back so no not less likly but react so

4354
01:25:52,790 --> 01:25:52,800
back so no not less likly but react so
 

4355
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:55,510
back so no not less likly but react so
so so no so let's go back to what we're

4356
01:25:55,510 --> 01:25:55,520
so so no so let's go back to what we're
 

4357
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:57,470
so so no so let's go back to what we're
talk looking at so the assembly index is

4358
01:25:57,470 --> 01:25:57,480
talk looking at so the assembly index is
 

4359
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:00,070
talk looking at so the assembly index is
the minimal path that could have created

4360
01:26:00,070 --> 01:26:00,080
the minimal path that could have created
 

4361
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:02,669
the minimal path that could have created
that object probabilistically so imagine

4362
01:26:02,669 --> 01:26:02,679
that object probabilistically so imagine
 

4363
01:26:02,679 --> 01:26:04,830
that object probabilistically so imagine
you have all your atoms in a plasma you

4364
01:26:04,830 --> 01:26:04,840
you have all your atoms in a plasma you
 

4365
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:07,750
you have all your atoms in a plasma you

4366
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:07,760
got enough energy you got enough um
 

4367
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,590
got enough energy you got enough um
there's collisions what is the quickest

4368
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:09,600
there's collisions what is the quickest
 

4369
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,070
there's collisions what is the quickest
way you could zip out that molecule with

4370
01:26:11,070 --> 01:26:11,080
way you could zip out that molecule with
 

4371
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:12,950
way you could zip out that molecule with
no reaction constraints how do you

4372
01:26:12,950 --> 01:26:12,960
no reaction constraints how do you
 

4373
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:14,990
no reaction constraints how do you
define quickest there then it's just

4374
01:26:14,990 --> 01:26:15,000
define quickest there then it's just
 

4375
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,550
define quickest there then it's just
basically walk on a random graph so you

4376
01:26:17,550 --> 01:26:17,560
basically walk on a random graph so you
 

4377
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:19,750
basically walk on a random graph so you
so we make an assumption that basically

4378
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:19,760
so we make an assumption that basically
 

4379
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:22,310
so we make an assumption that basically
the time scale for forming the bonds so

4380
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:22,320
the time scale for forming the bonds so
 

4381
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:23,470
the time scale for forming the bonds so
no I don't want to say that because it's

4382
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:23,480
no I don't want to say that because it's
 

4383
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:24,830
no I don't want to say that because it's
going to have people getting obsessing

4384
01:26:24,830 --> 01:26:24,840
going to have people getting obsessing
 

4385
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:26,310
going to have people getting obsessing
about this point and your criticism is a

4386
01:26:26,310 --> 01:26:26,320
about this point and your criticism is a
 

4387
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:28,229
about this point and your criticism is a
really good one what we're trying to say

4388
01:26:28,229 --> 01:26:28,239
really good one what we're trying to say
 

4389
01:26:28,239 --> 01:26:30,030
really good one what we're trying to say
is like this is this puts a lower bound

4390
01:26:30,030 --> 01:26:30,040
is like this is this puts a lower bound
 

4391
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:34,149
is like this is this puts a lower bound
on something of course um some reactions

4392
01:26:34,149 --> 01:26:34,159
on something of course um some reactions
 

4393
01:26:34,159 --> 01:26:35,830
on something of course um some reactions
are less possible than others but

4394
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:35,840
are less possible than others but
 

4395
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,590
are less possible than others but
actually I don't think chemical

4396
01:26:37,590 --> 01:26:37,600
actually I don't think chemical
 

4397
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:40,990
actually I don't think chemical
reactions exist oh boy what does that

4398
01:26:40,990 --> 01:26:41,000
reactions exist oh boy what does that
 

4399
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,550
reactions exist oh boy what does that
mean why don't chemical reactions exist

4400
01:26:44,550 --> 01:26:44,560
mean why don't chemical reactions exist
 

4401
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:46,669
mean why don't chemical reactions exist
I'm writing a paper right now that that

4402
01:26:46,669 --> 01:26:46,679
I'm writing a paper right now that that
 

4403
01:26:46,679 --> 01:26:48,310
I'm writing a paper right now that that
um I keep being told I have to finish

4404
01:26:48,310 --> 01:26:48,320
um I keep being told I have to finish
 

4405
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,990
um I keep being told I have to finish
and it's called the origin of chemical

4406
01:26:49,990 --> 01:26:50,000
and it's called the origin of chemical
 

4407
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,270
and it's called the origin of chemical
reactions and it merely says that

4408
01:26:53,270 --> 01:26:53,280
reactions and it merely says that
 

4409
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:54,950

01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:01,629
we put names chemist put names on
reactions like so you could have like I

4416
01:27:01,629 --> 01:27:01,639
reactions like so you could have like I
 

4417
01:27:01,639 --> 01:27:03,830

01:27:06,189 --> 01:27:06,199
by you know vitic um you could have the
 

4421
01:27:06,199 --> 01:27:09,830

what are these reactions so these

4424
01:27:11,189 --> 01:27:11,199
what are these reactions so these
 

4425
01:27:11,199 --> 01:27:12,709
what are these reactions so these
reactions are constrained by the

4426
01:27:12,709 --> 01:27:12,719
reactions are constrained by the
 

4427
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:14,350
reactions are constrained by the
following they're constrained by the

4428
01:27:14,350 --> 01:27:14,360
following they're constrained by the
 

4429
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:17,830
following they're constrained by the
fact they're on planet Earth 1G MH 298

4430
01:27:17,830 --> 01:27:17,840
fact they're on planet Earth 1G MH 298
 

4431
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:21,310

Kelvin one bar so these are constraints

4432
01:27:21,310 --> 01:27:21,320
Kelvin one bar so these are constraints
 

4433
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:23,590
Kelvin one bar so these are constraints
mhm um they're also constrained by the

4434
01:27:23,590 --> 01:27:23,600
mhm um they're also constrained by the
 

4435
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:26,790
mhm um they're also constrained by the
chemical composition of Earth oxygen

4436

availability all this stuff and that
 

4439
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:30,950
availability all this stuff and that
then allows us to focus in our chemistry

4440
01:27:30,950 --> 01:27:30,960
then allows us to focus in our chemistry
 

4441
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:33,310
then allows us to focus in our chemistry
so when a chemist does a reaction that's

4442
01:27:33,310 --> 01:27:33,320
so when a chemist does a reaction that's
 

4443
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:36,270
so when a chemist does a reaction that's
a really nice compressed shorthand for

control so of course we have Bond

4452
01:27:48,350 --> 01:27:48,360
control so of course we have Bond
 

4453
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:51,270
control so of course we have Bond
energies this so the bond energies are

4454
01:27:51,270 --> 01:27:51,280
energies this so the bond energies are
 

4455
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:53,830
energies this so the bond energies are
kind of intrinsic in a vacuum if you say

4456
01:27:53,830 --> 01:27:53,840
kind of intrinsic in a vacuum if you say
 

4457
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,709
kind of intrinsic in a vacuum if you say
so the bond energy you have to have a

4458
01:27:55,709 --> 01:27:55,719
so the bond energy you have to have a
 

4459
01:27:55,719 --> 01:27:59,390
so the bond energy you have to have a
bond and so for assembly Theory to work

4460
01:27:59,390 --> 01:27:59,400
bond and so for assembly Theory to work
 

4461
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:01,270

you have to have a bond which means that

4462
01:28:01,270 --> 01:28:01,280
you have to have a bond which means that
 

4463
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,470
you have to have a bond which means that
bond has to give the molecule certain

4523
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,950
Rea of the what's a different word for
chemical reaction uh transformation

4524
01:29:10,950 --> 01:29:10,960
chemical reaction uh transformation
 

4525
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:12,750
chemical reaction uh transformation
transformation yeah like a function it's

4526
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:12,760
transformation yeah like a function it's
 

4527
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:14,990
transformation yeah like a function it's
a function but no but I love chemical

4528
01:29:14,990 --> 01:29:15,000
a function but no but I love chemical
 

4529
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,109

the chemists don't all go mad I mean of

4532
01:29:18,910 --> 01:29:18,920
the chemists don't all go mad I mean of
 

4533
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:20,870
the chemists don't all go mad I mean of
course chemical reactions exist on Earth

in reactions and we can use them

4550
01:29:36,390 --> 01:29:36,400
in reactions and we can use them
 

4551
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:38,470
in reactions and we can use them
reliably but I do not think the vitic

01:30:45,470 --> 01:30:45,480
interesting information what were the
 

4619
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:48,149
interesting information what were the
editors of nature like what the reviews

4620

editors of nature like what the reviews
 

4621
01:30:48,159 --> 01:30:51,229
editors of nature like what the reviews
and so on how difficult was that process

4622
01:30:51,229 --> 01:30:51,239
and so on how difficult was that process
 

4623
01:30:51,239 --> 01:30:53,830
and so on how difficult was that process
this is a pretty like big paper yeah I

4624
01:30:53,830 --> 01:30:53,840
this is a pretty like big paper yeah I
 

4625
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:57,669
this is a pretty like big paper yeah I
mean the so um we when we originally

4626
01:30:57,669 --> 01:30:57,679
mean the so um we when we originally
 

4627
01:30:57,679 --> 01:31:01,470
mean the so um we when we originally
sent the paper um we sent the paper and

4628
01:31:01,470 --> 01:31:01,480
sent the paper um we sent the paper and
 

4629
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:02,629
sent the paper um we sent the paper and
the editor

4630
01:31:02,629 --> 01:31:02,639
the editor
 

4631
01:31:02,639 --> 01:31:06,229
the editor
said um that you know this was like this

4632
01:31:06,229 --> 01:31:06,239
said um that you know this was like this
 

4633
01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:08,070
said um that you know this was like this
was a quite a long process we sent the

4634
01:31:08,070 --> 01:31:08,080
was a quite a long process we sent the
 

4635
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:09,350
was a quite a long process we sent the
paper and the editor gave us some

4636
01:31:09,350 --> 01:31:09,360
paper and the editor gave us some
 

4637
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:12,550
paper and the editor gave us some
feedback and said you know I don't think

4638
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:12,560
feedback and said you know I don't think
 

4639
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:15,270
feedback and said you know I don't think
is that interesting it's not you know or

4640
01:31:15,270 --> 01:31:15,280
is that interesting it's not you know or
 

4641
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:18,709
is that interesting it's not you know or
it's hard it's it's a it's hard concept

4642
01:31:18,709 --> 01:31:18,719
it's hard it's it's a it's hard concept
 

4643
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:20,870
it's hard it's it's a it's hard concept
and we asked and the editor gave us some

4644
01:31:20,870 --> 01:31:20,880
and we asked and the editor gave us some
 

4645
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:24,910
and we asked and the editor gave us some
feedback M um and we and Sarah and I

4646
01:31:24,910 --> 01:31:24,920
feedback M um and we and Sarah and I
 

4647
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:27,030

took a year to rewrite the paper was the

4648
01:31:27,030 --> 01:31:27,040
took a year to rewrite the paper was the
 

4649
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:28,950
took a year to rewrite the paper was the
nature of the feedback very specific on

4650
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:28,960
nature of the feedback very specific on
 

4651
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:31,109
nature of the feedback very specific on
like this part of this part or was it

4652
01:31:31,109 --> 01:31:31,119
like this part of this part or was it
 

4653
01:31:31,119 --> 01:31:33,270
like this part of this part or was it
like like what what are you guys smoking

4654
01:31:33,270 --> 01:31:33,280
like like what what are you guys smoking
 

4655
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:34,350
like like what what are you guys smoking
what kind of yeah it was kind of the

4656
01:31:34,350 --> 01:31:34,360
what kind of yeah it was kind of the
 

4657
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:38,550
what kind of yeah it was kind of the
latter what you smoking okay and and you

4658
01:31:38,550 --> 01:31:38,560
latter what you smoking okay and and you
 

4659
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:41,669
latter what you smoking okay and and you
know but polite and there's promise yeah

4660
01:31:41,669 --> 01:31:41,679
know but polite and there's promise yeah
 

4661
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:44,030
know but polite and there's promise yeah
well the thing is there was the edit was

4662
01:31:44,030 --> 01:31:44,040
well the thing is there was the edit was
 

4663
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:46,510
well the thing is there was the edit was
really critical but in a but in a really

4664
01:31:46,510 --> 01:31:46,520
really critical but in a but in a really
 

4665
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:49,070
really critical but in a but in a really
professional way yeah and I mean for me

4666
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:49,080
professional way yeah and I mean for me
 

4667
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:50,669
professional way yeah and I mean for me
this was the way science should happen

4668
01:31:50,669 --> 01:31:50,679
this was the way science should happen
 

4669
01:31:50,679 --> 01:31:52,310
this was the way science should happen
so when it came back you know know we

4670
01:31:52,310 --> 01:31:52,320
so when it came back you know know we
 

4671
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:53,830
so when it came back you know know we
had too many equations in the paper if

4672
01:31:53,830 --> 01:31:53,840
had too many equations in the paper if
 

4673
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:54,910
had too many equations in the paper if
you look at the preprint they're just

4674
01:31:54,910 --> 01:31:54,920
you look at the preprint they're just
 

4675
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:57,229
you look at the preprint they're just
equations everywhere like 23 equations

4676
01:31:57,229 --> 01:31:57,239
equations everywhere like 23 equations
 

4677
01:31:57,239 --> 01:31:58,629
equations everywhere like 23 equations
and when I said to abishek who was the

4678
01:31:58,629 --> 01:31:58,639
and when I said to abishek who was the
 

4679
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:00,030
and when I said to abishek who was the
first author we got to remove all the

4680
01:32:00,030 --> 01:32:00,040
first author we got to remove all the
 

4681
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:02,109
first author we got to remove all the
equations but my assembly equations

4682
01:32:02,109 --> 01:32:02,119
equations but my assembly equations
 

4683
01:32:02,119 --> 01:32:04,990
equations but my assembly equations
thing AB was like you know no we can't I

4684
01:32:04,990 --> 01:32:05,000
thing AB was like you know no we can't I
 

4685
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,910
thing AB was like you know no we can't I
said well look if we want to explain

4686
01:32:06,910 --> 01:32:06,920
said well look if we want to explain
 

4687
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:08,510
said well look if we want to explain
this to people there's a real challenge

4688
01:32:08,510 --> 01:32:08,520
this to people there's a real challenge
 

4689
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:11,350
this to people there's a real challenge
mhm and so Sarah and I went through the

4690
01:32:11,350 --> 01:32:11,360
mhm and so Sarah and I went through the
 

4691
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,229
mhm and so Sarah and I went through the
I think it was actually 160 versions of

4692
01:32:13,229 --> 01:32:13,239
I think it was actually 160 versions of
 

4693
01:32:13,239 --> 01:32:14,830
I think it was actually 160 versions of
the paper but we basically we got to

4694
01:32:14,830 --> 01:32:14,840
the paper but we basically we got to
 

4695
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:17,070
the paper but we basically we got to
version 40 or something we said right

4696
01:32:17,070 --> 01:32:17,080
version 40 or something we said right
 

4697
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:19,390
version 40 or something we said right
zero it start again so we wrote the

4698
01:32:19,390 --> 01:32:19,400
zero it start again so we wrote the
 

4699
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:21,709
zero it start again so we wrote the
whole paper again we knew the entire

4700
01:32:21,709 --> 01:32:21,719
whole paper again we knew the entire
 

4701
01:32:21,719 --> 01:32:23,830
whole paper again we knew the entire
amazing and we just went bit by bit by

4702
01:32:23,830 --> 01:32:23,840
amazing and we just went bit by bit by
 

4703
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:26,189
amazing and we just went bit by bit by
bit and said what is it we want to say

4704
01:32:26,189 --> 01:32:26,199
bit and said what is it we want to say
 

4705
01:32:26,199 --> 01:32:29,750
bit and said what is it we want to say
and then we sent the paper in um and to

4706
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:29,760
and then we sent the paper in um and to
 

4707
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:32,030
and then we sent the paper in um and to
our we expected it to be rejected and

4708
01:32:32,030 --> 01:32:32,040
our we expected it to be rejected and
 

4709
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:34,790
our we expected it to be rejected and
not even go to review and then the we

4710
01:32:34,790 --> 01:32:34,800
not even go to review and then the we
 

4711
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,270
not even go to review and then the we
got notification back it had gone to

4712
01:32:36,270 --> 01:32:36,280
got notification back it had gone to
 

4713
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:38,030
got notification back it had gone to
review and we were like oh my God it's

4714
01:32:38,030 --> 01:32:38,040
review and we were like oh my God it's
 

4715
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:39,910
review and we were like oh my God it's
so going to get rejected how's it going

4716
01:32:39,910 --> 01:32:39,920
so going to get rejected how's it going
 

4717
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:41,189
so going to get rejected how's it going
to get rejected because the First

4718
01:32:41,189 --> 01:32:41,199
to get rejected because the First

01:32:41,199 --> 01:32:43,510
to get rejected because the First
Assembly paper that on the MPC we sent

4720
01:32:43,510 --> 01:32:43,520
Assembly paper that on the MPC we sent
 

4721
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:46,510
Assembly paper that on the MPC we sent
to Nature got went through six rounds of

4722
01:32:46,510 --> 01:32:46,520
to Nature got went through six rounds of
 

4723
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:49,390
to Nature got went through six rounds of
review and rejected right and there by

4724
01:32:49,390 --> 01:32:49,400
review and rejected right and there by
 

4725
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:51,310
review and rejected right and there by
by a by a chemist just said I don't

um a long story probably a boring story

4730
01:32:56,030 --> 01:32:56,040
um a long story probably a boring story
 

4731
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:58,590
um a long story probably a boring story
but in this case it went out to review

4732
01:32:58,590 --> 01:32:58,600
but in this case it went out to review
 

4733
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:00,750
but in this case it went out to review
the comments came back and the comments

um uh no they were very there were very
 

4741
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:10,950
um uh no they were very there were very
deep comments from all the reviewers

4742
01:33:10,950 --> 01:33:10,960
deep comments from all the reviewers
 

4743
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:15,270
deep comments from all the reviewers
there were um and but the but the none

01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:19,629
of the but the nice thing was the
reviewers were kind

4748
01:33:19,629 --> 01:33:19,639
reviewers were kind
 

4749
01:33:19,639 --> 01:33:22,750
reviewers were kind
of very critical but not dismissive they

4750
01:33:22,750 --> 01:33:22,760
of very critical but not dismissive they
 

4751
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:25,070
of very critical but not dismissive they
were like oh really explain this explain

4752
01:33:25,070 --> 01:33:25,080
were like oh really explain this explain
 

4753
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:26,790
were like oh really explain this explain
this explain this explain this are you

4754
01:33:26,790 --> 01:33:26,800
this explain this explain this are you
 

4755
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:28,390
this explain this explain this are you
sure it's not koler off are you sure

4756
01:33:28,390 --> 01:33:28,400
sure it's not koler off are you sure
 

4757
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:30,950
sure it's not koler off are you sure
it's not this and we went through I

4758
01:33:30,950 --> 01:33:30,960
it's not this and we went through I
 

4759
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:33,430
it's not this and we went through I
think three rounds of review pretty

4760
01:33:33,430 --> 01:33:33,440
think three rounds of review pretty
 

4761
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:37,750
think three rounds of review pretty
quick um and um and the editor went yeah

4762
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:37,760
quick um and um and the editor went yeah
 

4763
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:39,990
quick um and um and the editor went yeah
it's in M but maybe you could just

4764
01:33:39,990 --> 01:33:40,000
it's in M but maybe you could just
 

4765
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,629
it's in M but maybe you could just
comment on the whole process uh you've

4766
01:33:41,629 --> 01:33:41,639
comment on the whole process uh you've
 

4767
01:33:41,639 --> 01:33:44,070
comment on the whole process uh you've
published some pretty huge papers on all

4768
01:33:44,070 --> 01:33:44,080
published some pretty huge papers on all
 

4769
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:45,470
published some pretty huge papers on all
kinds of topics within chemistry and

4770
01:33:45,470 --> 01:33:45,480
kinds of topics within chemistry and
 

4771
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:48,390
kinds of topics within chemistry and
Beyond some of them have some little

4772
01:33:48,390 --> 01:33:48,400
Beyond some of them have some little
 

4773
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:51,910
Beyond some of them have some little
Spice in them a little spice of crazy

4774
01:33:51,910 --> 01:33:51,920
Spice in them a little spice of crazy
 

4775
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:53,709
Spice in them a little spice of crazy
like Tom way says I like my to with a

4776
01:33:53,709 --> 01:33:53,719
like Tom way says I like my to with a
 

4777
01:33:53,719 --> 01:33:55,870
like Tom way says I like my to with a
little Drop of Poison so you know it's

4778
01:33:55,870 --> 01:33:55,880
little Drop of Poison so you know it's
 

4779
01:33:55,880 --> 01:34:01,390
little Drop of Poison so you know it's
not um a mundane paper so where what's

4780
01:34:01,390 --> 01:34:01,400
not um a mundane paper so where what's
 

4781
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:03,070
not um a mundane paper so where what's
it like psychologically to go through

4782
01:34:03,070 --> 01:34:03,080
it like psychologically to go through
 

4783
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:04,310
it like psychologically to go through
all this process to keep getting

4784
01:34:04,310 --> 01:34:04,320
all this process to keep getting
 

4785
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:07,030
all this process to keep getting
rejected to uh to get reviews from

4786
01:34:07,030 --> 01:34:07,040
rejected to uh to get reviews from
 

4787
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:09,910
rejected to uh to get reviews from
people that don't get the paper or um

4788
01:34:09,910 --> 01:34:09,920
people that don't get the paper or um
 

4789
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:12,310
people that don't get the paper or um
all that kind of stuff just from a a

4790
01:34:12,310 --> 01:34:12,320
all that kind of stuff just from a a
 

4791
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:14,310
all that kind of stuff just from a a
question of a scientist like what what

4792
01:34:14,310 --> 01:34:14,320
question of a scientist like what what
 

4793
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:16,830
question of a scientist like what what
what is that like um it's uh I think

4794
01:34:16,830 --> 01:34:16,840
what is that like um it's uh I think
 

4795
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:21,270
what is that like um it's uh I think
it's a um I mean this paper for me kind

4796
01:34:21,270 --> 01:34:21,280
it's a um I mean this paper for me kind
 

4797
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:22,030
it's a um I mean this paper for me kind
of

4798
01:34:22,030 --> 01:34:22,040
of
 

4799
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:23,709
of
cuz this wasn't the the first time we

4800
01:34:23,709 --> 01:34:23,719
cuz this wasn't the the first time we
 

4801
01:34:23,719 --> 01:34:25,550
cuz this wasn't the the first time we
tried to publish assembly Theory at the

4802
01:34:25,550 --> 01:34:25,560
tried to publish assembly Theory at the
 

4803
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:27,830
tried to publish assembly Theory at the
highest level the nature Communications

4804
01:34:27,830 --> 01:34:27,840
highest level the nature Communications
 

4805
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:30,470
highest level the nature Communications
paper we on the mass spec on the on the

4806
01:34:30,470 --> 01:34:30,480
paper we on the mass spec on the on the
 

4807
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:32,870
paper we on the mass spec on the on the
idea went through went to Nature and got

4808
01:34:32,870 --> 01:34:32,880
idea went through went to Nature and got
 

4809
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:34,590
idea went through went to Nature and got
rejected went through six rounds of

4810
01:34:34,590 --> 01:34:34,600
rejected went through six rounds of
 

4811
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:38,709
rejected went through six rounds of
review and got rejected and and it and

4812
01:34:38,709 --> 01:34:38,719
review and got rejected and and it and
 

4813
01:34:38,719 --> 01:34:43,830
review and got rejected and and it and
it's and I I just was so confused when

4814
01:34:43,830 --> 01:34:43,840
it's and I I just was so confused when
 

4815
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:45,550
it's and I I just was so confused when
the when the chemist said this can't be

4816
01:34:45,550 --> 01:34:45,560
the when the chemist said this can't be
 

4817
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:47,109
the when the chemist said this can't be
possible I do not believe you can

4818
01:34:47,109 --> 01:34:47,119
possible I do not believe you can
 

4819
01:34:47,119 --> 01:34:49,669
possible I do not believe you can
measure complexity using MPC and also by

4820
01:34:49,669 --> 01:34:49,679
measure complexity using MPC and also by
 

4821
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:52,910
measure complexity using MPC and also by
the way molecules

4822
01:34:52,910 --> 01:34:52,920
the way molecules
 

4823
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:55,350
the way molecules
molecules um complex molecules can

4824
01:34:55,350 --> 01:34:55,360
molecules um complex molecules can
 

4825
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:57,669
molecules um complex molecules can
randomly form and we're like but look at

4826
01:34:57,669 --> 01:34:57,679
randomly form and we're like but look at
 

4827
01:34:57,679 --> 01:34:59,590
randomly form and we're like but look at
the data the data says and they said no

4828
01:34:59,590 --> 01:34:59,600
the data the data says and they said no
 

4829
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:02,470
the data the data says and they said no
no we don't believe you and and we went

4830
01:35:02,470 --> 01:35:02,480
no we don't believe you and and we went
 

4831

no we don't believe you and and we went
and and I just wouldn't give up um the

4832
01:35:05,550 --> 01:35:05,560
and and I just wouldn't give up um the
 

4833
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:07,350
and and I just wouldn't give up um the
editor and the editor in the end um was

4834
01:35:07,350 --> 01:35:07,360
editor and the editor in the end um was
 

4835
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:09,709
editor and the editor in the end um was
just like different editors actually

4836
01:35:09,709 --> 01:35:09,719
just like different editors actually
 

4837
01:35:09,719 --> 01:35:12,030
just like different editors actually
right what's behind that never giving up

4838
01:35:12,030 --> 01:35:12,040
right what's behind that never giving up
 

4839
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:15,350
right what's behind that never giving up
is like when you're sitting there 10:00

4840
01:35:15,350 --> 01:35:15,360
is like when you're sitting there 10:00
 

4841
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:17,629
is like when you're sitting there 10:00
in the evening there's a Melancholy

4845
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:23,109
feeling that comes over you you're like
okay this is rejection number five

4846
01:35:23,109 --> 01:35:23,119
okay this is rejection number five
 

4847
01:35:23,119 --> 01:35:24,750
okay this is rejection number five
or not it's not a rejection but maybe it

4848
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:24,760
or not it's not a rejection but maybe it

there H I don't

4858
01:35:39,310 --> 01:35:39,320

 

4859
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:41,390

know I don't normally get emotional

4860
01:35:41,390 --> 01:35:41,400
know I don't normally get emotional
 

4861
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:50,390
know I don't normally get emotional
about papers but

4862
01:35:50,390 --> 01:35:50,400

 

4863
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:56,910

um

4864

4865
01:35:56,920 --> 01:35:58,310

it's not about giving up because we want

4866
01:35:58,310 --> 01:35:58,320
it's not about giving up because we want
 

4867
01:35:58,320 --> 01:35:59,550
it's not about giving up because we want
to get it published because we want the

second silly never get emotional about
 

4885
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:33,390
second silly never get emotional about
papers normally but but you but I think

4886
01:36:33,390 --> 01:36:33,400
papers normally but but you but I think
 

4887
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:35,390
papers normally but but you but I think
what we did you just compressed like

4888
01:36:35,390 --> 01:36:35,400
what we did you just compressed like
 

4889
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:38,590
what we did you just compressed like
five years of Ang from this so it's been

4890
01:36:38,590 --> 01:36:38,600
five years of Ang from this so it's been
 

4891
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:41,070
five years of Ang from this so it's been
it's been rough it's not just rough it's

4892
01:36:41,070 --> 01:36:41,080
it's been rough it's not just rough it's
 

4893
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:42,830
it's been rough it's not just rough it's
like it happened you know I came up with

4894
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:42,840
like it happened you know I came up with
 

4895
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:45,709
like it happened you know I came up with
the assembly equation you know remote

4896
01:36:45,709 --> 01:36:45,719
the assembly equation you know remote
 

4897
01:36:45,719 --> 01:36:50,870
the assembly equation you know remote
from Sarah in Arizona and the people SFI

4898
01:36:50,870 --> 01:36:50,880
from Sarah in Arizona and the people SFI
 

4899
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:52,910
from Sarah in Arizona and the people SFI
I feel like like I was a mad person like

4900
01:36:52,910 --> 01:36:52,920
I feel like like I was a mad person like
 

4901
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:55,790
I feel like like I was a mad person like
you know the guy in depicted in in a in

4902
01:36:55,790 --> 01:36:55,800
you know the guy in depicted in in a in
 

4903
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:57,629
you know the guy in depicted in in a in
a beautiful mind who was just like not

4904
01:36:57,629 --> 01:36:57,639
a beautiful mind who was just like not
 

4905
01:36:57,639 --> 01:37:01,669
a beautiful mind who was just like not
not the actual genius part but

4906
01:37:01,669 --> 01:37:01,679

 

4907
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:04,950

just because I kept writing expanded and

4908
01:37:04,950 --> 01:37:04,960
just because I kept writing expanded and
 

4909
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:06,590
just because I kept writing expanded and
I have no mathematical ability at all

4910
01:37:06,590 --> 01:37:06,600
I have no mathematical ability at all
 

4911
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:08,270
I have no mathematical ability at all
and I was expand I was making these

4912
01:37:08,270 --> 01:37:08,280
and I was expand I was making these
 

4913
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:09,669
and I was expand I was making these
mathematical expansions where I kept

4914
01:37:09,669 --> 01:37:09,679
mathematical expansions where I kept
 

4915
01:37:09,679 --> 01:37:12,950
mathematical expansions where I kept
seeing the same Motif again I was like I

4916
01:37:12,950 --> 01:37:12,960
seeing the same Motif again I was like I
 

4917
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:14,590
seeing the same Motif again I was like I
think this is a copy number the same

4918
01:37:14,590 --> 01:37:14,600
think this is a copy number the same
 

4919
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:16,310
think this is a copy number the same
string as coming again again again I

4920
01:37:16,310 --> 01:37:16,320
string as coming again again again I
 

4921
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:18,350
string as coming again again again I
kept I couldn't do the math and then I

4922
01:37:18,350 --> 01:37:18,360
kept I couldn't do the math and then I
 

4923
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:19,950
kept I couldn't do the math and then I
realized the copy number fell out of the

4924
01:37:19,950 --> 01:37:19,960
realized the copy number fell out of the
 

4925
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:21,390
realized the copy number fell out of the
equation and everything collapsed down I

4926
01:37:21,390 --> 01:37:21,400
equation and everything collapsed down I
 

4927
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:23,550
equation and everything collapsed down I
was like oh that works kind of so we

4928
01:37:23,550 --> 01:37:23,560
was like oh that works kind of so we
 

4929
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:26,709
was like oh that works kind of so we
submitted the paper and then when it was

4930
01:37:26,709 --> 01:37:26,719
submitted the paper and then when it was
 

4931
01:37:26,719 --> 01:37:29,550
submitted the paper and then when it was
almost accepted right the mass Beck one

4932
01:37:29,550 --> 01:37:29,560
almost accepted right the mass Beck one
 

4933
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:31,910
almost accepted right the mass Beck one
and it was astrobiologist said great um

4934
01:37:31,910 --> 01:37:31,920
and it was astrobiologist said great um
 

4935
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:33,310
and it was astrobiologist said great um
you know a mass spectroscopist said

4936
01:37:33,310 --> 01:37:33,320
you know a mass spectroscopist said
 

4937
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:35,669
you know a mass spectroscopist said
great and the chemist went nonsense like

4938
01:37:35,669 --> 01:37:35,679
great and the chemist went nonsense like
 

4939
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:37,550
great and the chemist went nonsense like
biggest pile of nonsense ever fraud you

4940
01:37:37,550 --> 01:37:37,560
biggest pile of nonsense ever fraud you
 

4941

convince the editor in this case the
 

4949
01:37:48,599 --> 01:37:50,470
convince the editor in this case the
editor was just so pissed off cuz they

4950
01:37:50,470 --> 01:37:50,480
editor was just so pissed off cuz they
 

4951

published elsewhere and then um the
 

5015
01:39:02,599 --> 01:39:05,030
published elsewhere and then um the
actual experimental data so this is kind

5016
01:39:05,030 --> 01:39:05,040
actual experimental data so this is kind
 

5017
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:06,910
actual experimental data so this is kind
of in this paper the experimental

5018

of in this paper the experimental
 

5019
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:09,229
of in this paper the experimental
justification was already published so

5020
01:39:09,229 --> 01:39:09,239
justification was already published so
 

5021
01:39:09,239 --> 01:39:10,870
justification was already published so
when we did this one and we went through

5022
01:39:10,870 --> 01:39:10,880
when we did this one and we went through
 

5023
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:13,550
when we did this one and we went through
the versions and and then we sent it in

5024
01:39:13,550 --> 01:39:13,560
the versions and and then we sent it in
 

5025
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:16,390
the versions and and then we sent it in
and in the end it just got accepted we

5026
01:39:16,390 --> 01:39:16,400
and in the end it just got accepted we
 

5027
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:18,070
and in the end it just got accepted we
were like well that's kind of cool right

5028
01:39:18,070 --> 01:39:18,080
were like well that's kind of cool right
 

5029
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:19,830
were like well that's kind of cool right
this is kind of like you know some days

01:39:25,229 --> 01:39:25,239
the the the first author was like I
 

5035
01:39:25,239 --> 01:39:26,750
the the the first author was like I
can't believe it God accepted like nor

and then when the paper was published I

5040
01:39:32,390 --> 01:39:32,400
and then when the paper was published I
 

5041
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:34,550
and then when the paper was published I
was not expecting the backlash I was

5042
01:39:34,550 --> 01:39:34,560
was not expecting the backlash I was
 

5043
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:36,350
was not expecting the backlash I was
expecting

5044
01:39:36,350 --> 01:39:36,360
expecting
 

5045
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:38,189
expecting
computational well no actually I was

5046
01:39:38,189 --> 01:39:38,199
computational well no actually I was
 

5047
01:39:38,199 --> 01:39:39,350
computational well no actually I was
just expecting one person who been

5048
01:39:39,350 --> 01:39:39,360
just expecting one person who been
 

5049
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:40,990
just expecting one person who been
trolling me for a while about it just to

5050
01:39:40,990 --> 01:39:41,000
trolling me for a while about it just to
 

5051
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,950
trolling me for a while about it just to
carry on trolling but I didn't expect

5052
01:39:42,950 --> 01:39:42,960
carry on trolling but I didn't expect
 

5053
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:46,629
carry on trolling but I didn't expect
the backlash and then I I wrote wrote to

5054
01:39:46,629 --> 01:39:46,639
the backlash and then I I wrote wrote to
 

5055

so well it's I think it's a beautiful

5066
01:39:58,229 --> 01:39:58,239
so well it's I think it's a beautiful
 

5067
01:39:58,239 --> 01:40:01,629
so well it's I think it's a beautiful
story of perseverance and the backlash

5068
01:40:01,629 --> 01:40:01,639
story of perseverance and the backlash
 

5069
01:40:01,639 --> 01:40:03,669
story of perseverance and the backlash
is just a negative word

5070
01:40:03,669 --> 01:40:03,679
is just a negative word
 

5071
01:40:03,679 --> 01:40:07,189
is just a negative word
for discourse which I think is beautiful

5072
01:40:07,189 --> 01:40:07,199
for discourse which I think is beautiful
 

5073
01:40:07,199 --> 01:40:10,270
for discourse which I think is beautiful
I think you as I said to you know when

5074
01:40:10,270 --> 01:40:10,280
I think you as I said to you know when
 

5075
01:40:10,280 --> 01:40:13,390
I think you as I said to you know when
it got accepted and people were saying

5076
01:40:13,390 --> 01:40:13,400
it got accepted and people were saying
 

5077
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:15,350
it got accepted and people were saying
were kind of like hacking on it and I

5078
01:40:15,350 --> 01:40:15,360
were kind of like hacking on it and I
 

5079
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:19,430
were kind of like hacking on it and I
was like papers are not gold medals the

5080
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:19,440
was like papers are not gold medals the
 

5081
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:21,629
was like papers are not gold medals the
reason I wanted to publish that paper

5082
01:40:21,629 --> 01:40:21,639
reason I wanted to publish that paper
 

5083
01:40:21,639 --> 01:40:25,510
reason I wanted to publish that paper
in nature is because it says hey there's

5084
01:40:25,510 --> 01:40:25,520
in nature is because it says hey there's
 

5085
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:29,149
in nature is because it says hey there's
something before biological evolution

5086
01:40:29,149 --> 01:40:29,159
something before biological evolution
 

5087
01:40:29,159 --> 01:40:30,669
something before biological evolution
you have to have that if you're not a

5088
01:40:30,669 --> 01:40:30,679
you have to have that if you're not a
 

5089
01:40:30,679 --> 01:40:33,109
you have to have that if you're not a
creationist by the way this is an

5090
01:40:33,109 --> 01:40:33,119
creationist by the way this is an
 

5091
01:40:33,119 --> 01:40:35,350
creationist by the way this is an
approach first time someone has put a

5092
01:40:35,350 --> 01:40:35,360
approach first time someone has put a
 

5093
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:38,589
approach first time someone has put a
concrete mechanism or sorry a concrete

5094
01:40:38,589 --> 01:40:38,599
concrete mechanism or sorry a concrete
 

5095
01:40:38,599 --> 01:40:40,390
concrete mechanism or sorry a concrete
quantification and what comes next

5096
01:40:40,390 --> 01:40:40,400
quantification and what comes next
 

5097
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:43,070
quantification and what comes next
you're pushing on is a mechanism M and

5098
01:40:43,070 --> 01:40:43,080
you're pushing on is a mechanism M and
 

5099
01:40:43,080 --> 01:40:44,229
you're pushing on is a mechanism M and
that's what we need to get to is an

5100
01:40:44,229 --> 01:40:44,239
that's what we need to get to is an
 

5101
01:40:44,239 --> 01:40:45,990
that's what we need to get to is an
autocatalytic set self-replicating

5102
01:40:45,990 --> 01:40:46,000
autocatalytic set self-replicating
 

5103
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,229
autocatalytic set self-replicating
molecules some other features that come

01:40:48,229 --> 01:40:48,239
molecules some other features that come
 

5105
01:40:48,239 --> 01:40:51,990
molecules some other features that come
in um and the fact that this paper has

5106
01:40:51,990 --> 01:40:52,000
in um and the fact that this paper has
 

5107
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:55,350
in um and the fact that this paper has
been so discussed for me is a dream come

01:40:55,350 --> 01:40:55,360
been so discussed for me is a dream come

true like you it doesn't get better than

5110
01:40:57,750 --> 01:40:57,760
true like you it doesn't get better than
 

5111
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:59,669
true like you it doesn't get better than
that if you can't accept a few people

5112
01:40:59,669 --> 01:40:59,679
that if you can't accept a few people
 

5113
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:01,750
that if you can't accept a few people
hating it and the nice thing is the

5114
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:01,760
hating it and the nice thing is the
 

5115
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:04,310
hating it and the nice thing is the
thing that I really makes me happy is

5116
01:41:04,310 --> 01:41:04,320
thing that I really makes me happy is
 

5117
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:07,950
thing that I really makes me happy is
that no one has attacked the actual

5118
01:41:07,950 --> 01:41:07,960
that no one has attacked the actual
 

5119
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:10,350
that no one has attacked the actual
physical content like you you can

5120
01:41:10,350 --> 01:41:10,360
physical content like you you can
 

5121
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:11,709
physical content like you you can
measure the assembly index you can

5122
01:41:11,709 --> 01:41:11,719
measure the assembly index you can
 

5123
01:41:11,719 --> 01:41:14,270
measure the assembly index you can
measure selection now so either that's

5124
01:41:14,270 --> 01:41:14,280
measure selection now so either that's
 

5125
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:17,510
measure selection now so either that's
right or it's well either that's helpful

5126
01:41:17,510 --> 01:41:17,520
right or it's well either that's helpful
 

5127
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:20,390
right or it's well either that's helpful
or unhelpful if it's unhelpful this

5128
01:41:20,390 --> 01:41:20,400
or unhelpful if it's unhelpful this
 

5129
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:22,149
or unhelpful if it's unhelpful this
paper will syn down and no one will use

5130
01:41:22,149 --> 01:41:22,159
paper will syn down and no one will use
 

5131
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:24,350
paper will syn down and no one will use
it again if it's helpful it will help

5132
01:41:24,350 --> 01:41:24,360
it again if it's helpful it will help
 

5133
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:26,270
it again if it's helpful it will help
people build scaffold on it and we'll

5134
01:41:26,270 --> 01:41:26,280
people build scaffold on it and we'll
 

5135
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:28,790
people build scaffold on it and we'll
start to converge to a new paradigm so I

5136
01:41:28,790 --> 01:41:28,800
start to converge to a new paradigm so I
 

5137
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:31,189
start to converge to a new paradigm so I
think that that's the the thing that I

5138

wanted to see you know my colleagues
authors collaborators and people were

5142
01:41:37,270 --> 01:41:37,280
authors collaborators and people were
 

5143
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:39,149
authors collaborators and people were
like you've just published this paper

5144
01:41:39,149 --> 01:41:39,159
like you've just published this paper
 

5145
01:41:39,159 --> 01:41:40,790
like you've just published this paper
you're a chemist why have you done this

5146
01:41:40,790 --> 01:41:40,800
you're a chemist why have you done this
 

5147
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:42,510
you're a chemist why have you done this
like who are you to be doing

5148
01:41:42,510 --> 01:41:42,520
like who are you to be doing
 

5149
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:46,070
like who are you to be doing
evolutionary theory like well I don't

5150
01:41:46,070 --> 01:41:46,080
evolutionary theory like well I don't
 

5151
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:48,270
evolutionary theory like well I don't
know I mean sorry did I need to ca

5152
01:41:48,270 --> 01:41:48,280
know I mean sorry did I need to ca
 

5153
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:50,430
know I mean sorry did I need to ca
anyone to do anything well I'm glad you

5156
01:41:53,149 --> 01:41:53,159
did let me just before coming back to
 

5157
01:41:53,159 --> 01:41:54,790
did let me just before coming back to
origin of life and these kinds of

5158
01:41:54,790 --> 01:41:54,800
origin of life and these kinds of
 

5159
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:57,149
origin of life and these kinds of
questions uh you mentioned learning

5160
01:41:57,149 --> 01:41:57,159
questions uh you mentioned learning
 

5161
01:41:57,159 --> 01:41:59,149
questions uh you mentioned learning
difficulties I didn't know about this so

5162
01:41:59,149 --> 01:41:59,159
difficulties I didn't know about this so
 

5163
01:41:59,159 --> 01:42:02,589
difficulties I didn't know about this so
what what was it like I wasn't very good

5164
01:42:02,589 --> 01:42:02,599
what what was it like I wasn't very good
 

5165

were very young yeah yeah but in primary
school I U my handwriting was really

5170
01:42:09,830 --> 01:42:09,840
school I U my handwriting was really
 

5171
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:13,310
school I U my handwriting was really
poor and apparently I couldn't read and

5172
01:42:13,310 --> 01:42:13,320
poor and apparently I couldn't read and
 

5173
01:42:13,320 --> 01:42:15,270
poor and apparently I couldn't read and
um and I and my mathematics was very

5174
01:42:15,270 --> 01:42:15,280
um and I and my mathematics was very
 

5175
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:17,229
um and I and my mathematics was very
poor so they just said this is a problem

5176
01:42:17,229 --> 01:42:17,239
poor so they just said this is a problem
 

5177
01:42:17,239 --> 01:42:19,750
poor so they just said this is a problem
they identified it my parents kind of at

5178
01:42:19,750 --> 01:42:19,760
they identified it my parents kind of at
 

5179
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:21,229
they identified it my parents kind of at
the time were confused because I was

5180
01:42:21,229 --> 01:42:21,239
the time were confused because I was
 

5181
01:42:21,239 --> 01:42:22,709
the time were confused because I was
busy taking things apart buying

5182
01:42:22,709 --> 01:42:22,719
busy taking things apart buying
 

5183
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:24,669
busy taking things apart buying
electronic junk from the shop trying to

5184
01:42:24,669 --> 01:42:24,679
electronic junk from the shop trying to
 

5185
01:42:24,679 --> 01:42:28,550
electronic junk from the shop trying to
build computers and things um and then

5186
01:42:28,550 --> 01:42:28,560
build computers and things um and then
 

5187
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:30,510
build computers and things um and then
was I got out of when I was I think

5188
01:42:30,510 --> 01:42:30,520
was I got out of when I was I think
 

5189
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:33,109
was I got out of when I was I think
about the major transition in my

5190
01:42:33,109 --> 01:42:33,119
about the major transition in my
 

5191
01:42:33,119 --> 01:42:35,669
about the major transition in my
stupidity like you know everyone thought

5192
01:42:35,669 --> 01:42:35,679
stupidity like you know everyone thought
 

5193
01:42:35,679 --> 01:42:37,390
stupidity like you know everyone thought
I wasn't that stupid when I basically

5194
01:42:37,390 --> 01:42:37,400
I wasn't that stupid when I basically
 

5195
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:39,750
I wasn't that stupid when I basically
everyone thought I was faking I like

5196
01:42:39,750 --> 01:42:39,760
everyone thought I was faking I like
 

5197
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:41,270
everyone thought I was faking I like
stuff and I was faking wanting to be it

5198
01:42:41,270 --> 01:42:41,280
stuff and I was faking wanting to be it
 

5199
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:43,350
stuff and I was faking wanting to be it
so I always want to be a scientist so

5200
01:42:43,350 --> 01:42:43,360
so I always want to be a scientist so
 

5201
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:44,669
so I always want to be a scientist so
five six seven years old i' be a

5202
01:42:44,669 --> 01:42:44,679
five six seven years old i' be a
 

5203
01:42:44,679 --> 01:42:46,109
five six seven years old i' be a
scientists take things apart and

5204
01:42:46,109 --> 01:42:46,119
scientists take things apart and
 

5205
01:42:46,119 --> 01:42:48,310
scientists take things apart and
everyone's like yeah this guy wants to

5206
01:42:48,310 --> 01:42:48,320
everyone's like yeah this guy wants to
 

5207
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:51,109
everyone's like yeah this guy wants to
be a scientist but he's an idiot m and

5208
01:42:51,109 --> 01:42:51,119
be a scientist but he's an idiot m and
 

5209
01:42:51,119 --> 01:42:53,589
be a scientist but he's an idiot m and
so and so so everyone was really

5210
01:42:53,589 --> 01:42:53,599
so and so so everyone was really
 

5211
01:42:53,599 --> 01:42:55,270
so and so so everyone was really
confused I think at first that I wasn't

5212
01:42:55,270 --> 01:42:55,280
confused I think at first that I wasn't
 

5213
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:57,350
confused I think at first that I wasn't
smarter than I you know was claiming to

5214
01:42:57,350 --> 01:42:57,360
smarter than I you know was claiming to
 

5215
01:42:57,360 --> 01:42:59,350
smarter than I you know was claiming to
be and then I just basically didn't do

5216
01:42:59,350 --> 01:42:59,360
be and then I just basically didn't do
 

5217
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:00,709
be and then I just basically didn't do
well any the the test I went down and

5218
01:43:00,709 --> 01:43:00,719
well any the the test I went down and
 

5219
01:43:00,719 --> 01:43:04,270
well any the the test I went down and
down and down and down and then um and I

5220
01:43:04,270 --> 01:43:04,280
down and down and down and then um and I
 

5221
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:06,470
down and down and down and then um and I
was kind of like huh this is really

5222
01:43:06,470 --> 01:43:06,480
was kind of like huh this is really
 

5223
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:09,430
was kind of like huh this is really
embarrassing I really like maths and

5224
01:43:09,430 --> 01:43:09,440
embarrassing I really like maths and
 

5225
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:11,629
embarrassing I really like maths and
everyone says I can't do it I really

5226
01:43:11,629 --> 01:43:11,639
everyone says I can't do it I really
 

5227
01:43:11,639 --> 01:43:13,229
everyone says I can't do it I really
like kind of you know physics and

5228
01:43:13,229 --> 01:43:13,239
like kind of you know physics and
 

5229
01:43:13,239 --> 01:43:14,910
like kind of you know physics and
chemistry and all that in science and

5230
01:43:14,910 --> 01:43:14,920
chemistry and all that in science and
 

5231
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:16,709
chemistry and all that in science and
people say you're not you can't you

5232
01:43:16,709 --> 01:43:16,719
people say you're not you can't you
 

5233
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:19,390
people say you're not you can't you
can't read and write and so I found

5234
01:43:19,390 --> 01:43:19,400
can't read and write and so I found
 

5235
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:21,310
can't read and write and so I found
myself in a learning difficulty class at

5236
01:43:21,310 --> 01:43:21,320
myself in a learning difficulty class at
 

5237
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:22,790
myself in a learning difficulty class at
the end of primary school and the

5238
01:43:22,790 --> 01:43:22,800
the end of primary school and the
 

5239
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:25,030
the end of primary school and the
beginning of secondary school in the UK

5240
01:43:25,030 --> 01:43:25,040
beginning of secondary school in the UK
 

5241
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:27,629
beginning of secondary school in the UK
secondary school is like 11 12 years old

5242
01:43:27,629 --> 01:43:27,639
secondary school is like 11 12 years old
 

5243

5245
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:33,669
M and I remember being put in the in the
remedial class and the remedial class

5246
01:43:33,669 --> 01:43:33,679
remedial class and the remedial class
 

5247
01:43:33,679 --> 01:43:36,910
remedial class and the remedial class
was basically full of um well two typ

5248
01:43:36,910 --> 01:43:36,920
was basically full of um well two typ
 

5249

speak English mhm and there were people
that really had learning difficulty

5258
01:43:52,149 --> 01:43:52,159
that really had learning difficulty
 

5259
01:43:52,159 --> 01:44:00,350
that really had learning difficulty
so

5260
01:44:00,350 --> 01:44:00,360

 

5261
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:03,629

um the one thing I can objectively

01:44:03,629 --> 01:44:03,639
um the one thing I can objectively
 

5263
01:44:03,639 --> 01:44:10,629
um the one thing I can objectively
remember um was I mean I could read um I

5264
01:44:10,629 --> 01:44:10,639
remember um was I mean I could read um I
 

5265
01:44:10,639 --> 01:44:14,629
remember um was I mean I could read um I
like reading I read a lot um but

5266
01:44:14,629 --> 01:44:14,639
like reading I read a lot um but
 

5267
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:16,790
like reading I read a lot um but
something in me I was I'm a bit of a

5268
01:44:16,790 --> 01:44:16,800
something in me I was I'm a bit of a

5271
01:44:19,119 --> 01:44:22,350
rebel I refused to read what I was told
to read and and I found it difficulty to

5272
01:44:22,350 --> 01:44:22,360
to read and and I found it difficulty to
 

5273
01:44:22,360 --> 01:44:23,950
to read and and I found it difficulty to
read individual words in the way they

day teaching someone else to
 

5279
01:44:29,199 --> 01:44:34,270
day teaching someone else to
read um uh and they said okay they we

5280
01:44:34,270 --> 01:44:34,280
read um uh and they said okay they we
 

5281
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:37,750
read um uh and they said okay they we
don't understand this I I always knew

5282
01:44:37,750 --> 01:44:37,760
don't understand this I I always knew
 

5283
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:39,030
don't understand this I I always knew
want to be a scientist but I didn't

5284
01:44:39,030 --> 01:44:39,040
want to be a scientist but I didn't
 

5285
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:40,550
want to be a scientist but I didn't
really know what that meant and I

5286
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:40,560
really know what that meant and I
 

5287
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:42,030
really know what that meant and I
realized you had to go to university and

5288
01:44:42,030 --> 01:44:42,040
realized you had to go to university and
 

5289
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:43,350
realized you had to go to university and
I thought I can just go University take

5290
01:44:43,350 --> 01:44:43,360
I thought I can just go University take
 

5291
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:45,270
I thought I can just go University take
curious people like no no no you need to

he's definitely going to fail it's a
 

5319
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:16,270
he's definitely going to fail it's a
waste of time waste of money and he said

I failed MH so I took the exams and

5328
01:45:24,430 --> 01:45:24,440
I failed MH so I took the exams and
 

5329
01:45:24,440 --> 01:45:26,149
I failed MH so I took the exams and
passed them fortunately I didn't get the

5330
01:45:26,149 --> 01:45:26,159
passed them fortunately I didn't get the
 

5331
01:45:26,159 --> 01:45:29,070
passed them fortunately I didn't get the
top grades but I you know I got into a

5332
01:45:29,070 --> 01:45:29,080
top grades but I you know I got into a
 

5333
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:31,270
top grades but I you know I got into a
levels but then that also kind of

5334
01:45:31,270 --> 01:45:31,280
levels but then that also kind of
 

5335
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:32,870
levels but then that also kind of
limited what I could do at a levels I

5336
01:45:32,870 --> 01:45:32,880
limited what I could do at a levels I
 

5337
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:35,669
limited what I could do at a levels I
wasn't allowed to do a level maths so

5338
01:45:35,669 --> 01:45:35,679
wasn't allowed to do a level maths so
 

5339
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:36,910
wasn't allowed to do a level maths so
what do you mean you weren't allowed

5340
01:45:36,910 --> 01:45:36,920
what do you mean you weren't allowed
 

5341
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:38,870
what do you mean you weren't allowed
because I I had such a bad math grade

5342
01:45:38,870 --> 01:45:38,880
because I I had such a bad math grade
 

5343
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:41,950
because I I had such a bad math grade
from My GCSE I only had a c but I they

5344
01:45:41,950 --> 01:45:41,960
from My GCSE I only had a c but I they
 

5345
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:43,629
from My GCSE I only had a c but I they
wouldn't let me go into the ABC for math

5346
01:45:43,629 --> 01:45:43,639
wouldn't let me go into the ABC for math
 

5347
01:45:43,639 --> 01:45:44,990
wouldn't let me go into the ABC for math
because of some kind of cour workk

5348
01:45:44,990 --> 01:45:45,000
because of some kind of cour workk
 

5349
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,030
because of some kind of cour workk
requirement back then so the top grade I

5350
01:45:47,030 --> 01:45:47,040
requirement back then so the top grade I
 

5351
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:48,950
requirement back then so the top grade I
could have got was a c so CD or E so I

5352
01:45:48,950 --> 01:45:48,960
could have got was a c so CD or E so I
 

5353
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:52,229
could have got was a c so CD or E so I
got a C and then let me do um uh kind of

5354
01:45:52,229 --> 01:45:52,239
got a C and then let me do um uh kind of
 

5355
01:45:52,239 --> 01:45:53,870
got a C and then let me do um uh kind of
as level math which is this half

5356
01:45:53,870 --> 01:45:53,880
as level math which is this half
 

5357
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:55,390
as level math which is this half
intermediate but and get to go

5358
01:45:55,390 --> 01:45:55,400
intermediate but and get to go
 

5359
01:45:55,400 --> 01:45:57,270
intermediate but and get to go
University but in the ACT liked

5360
01:45:57,270 --> 01:45:57,280
University but in the ACT liked
 

5361
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:58,310
University but in the ACT liked
chemistry I had a good chemistry

5362
01:45:58,310 --> 01:45:58,320
chemistry I had a good chemistry
 

5363
01:45:58,320 --> 01:45:59,589
chemistry I had a good chemistry
teachers so in the end I got to

5364
01:45:59,589 --> 01:45:59,599
teachers so in the end I got to
 

5365
01:45:59,599 --> 01:46:01,950
teachers so in the end I got to
University to do chemistry so through

5366
01:46:01,950 --> 01:46:01,960
University to do chemistry so through
 

5367
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:04,910
University to do chemistry so through
that kind of process I think for kids in

5368
01:46:04,910 --> 01:46:04,920
that kind of process I think for kids in
 

5369
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:07,870
that kind of process I think for kids in
that situation it's it's easy to start

5370
01:46:07,870 --> 01:46:07,880
that situation it's it's easy to start
 

5371
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:09,510
that situation it's it's easy to start

5377
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:17,430
stupid and basically give up that you're
just not good at math you're not good at

5378
01:46:17,430 --> 01:46:17,440
just not good at math you're not good at
 

5379
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:21,109
just not good at math you're not good at

anything but but now but back then I was

5402
01:46:50,470 --> 01:46:50,480
anything but but now but back then I was
 

5403
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:52,950
anything but but now but back then I was
so I remember when I was like I don't

5404
01:46:52,950 --> 01:46:52,960
so I remember when I was like I don't
 

5405
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:55,270
so I remember when I was like I don't
know I I trilled I tried to build a

5406
01:46:55,270 --> 01:46:55,280
know I I trilled I tried to build a
 

5407
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:57,589
know I I trilled I tried to build a
laser when I was like eight mhm and I

5408
01:46:57,589 --> 01:46:57,599
laser when I was like eight mhm and I
 

5409
01:46:57,599 --> 01:47:00,109
laser when I was like eight mhm and I
thought how hard could it be

5410
01:47:00,109 --> 01:47:00,119
thought how hard could it be
 

5411
01:47:00,119 --> 01:47:03,510
thought how hard could it be
like and I basically I was going to buil

5412
01:47:03,510 --> 01:47:03,520
like and I basically I was going to buil
 

5413
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:05,510
like and I basically I was going to buil
a CO I was going to build a CO2 laser I

5414
01:47:05,510 --> 01:47:05,520
a CO I was going to build a CO2 laser I
 

5415
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:08,229
a CO I was going to build a CO2 laser I
was like right I think I need some

5416
01:47:08,229 --> 01:47:08,239
was like right I think I need some
 

5417
01:47:08,239 --> 01:47:11,390
was like right I think I need some
partially um coated mirrors I need some

5418
01:47:11,390 --> 01:47:11,400
partially um coated mirrors I need some
 

5419
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:12,270
partially um coated mirrors I need some
carbon

5420
01:47:12,270 --> 01:47:12,280
carbon
 

5421
01:47:12,280 --> 01:47:15,430
carbon
dioxide and I need a high high high

5422
01:47:15,430 --> 01:47:15,440
dioxide and I need a high high high
 

5423
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:18,430
dioxide and I need a high high high
voltage so I kind of and I was like I

5424
01:47:18,430 --> 01:47:18,440
voltage so I kind of and I was like I
 

5425
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:20,669
voltage so I kind of and I was like I
didn't have a and I was so stupid right

5426
01:47:20,669 --> 01:47:20,679
didn't have a and I was so stupid right
 

5427
01:47:20,679 --> 01:47:22,750
didn't have a and I was so stupid right
I was kind of so embarrassed I to make

5428
01:47:22,750 --> 01:47:22,760
I was kind of so embarrassed I to make
 

5429
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:25,430
I was kind of so embarrassed I to make
enough CO2 I actually set fire and try

5430
01:47:25,430 --> 01:47:25,440
enough CO2 I actually set fire and try
 

5431
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:29,030
enough CO2 I actually set fire and try
to filter the flame oh nice to crap it

5432
01:47:29,030 --> 01:47:29,040
to filter the flame oh nice to crap it
 

5433
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:31,510
to filter the flame oh nice to crap it
off CO2 and I was like completely

5434
01:47:31,510 --> 01:47:31,520
off CO2 and I was like completely
 

5435
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:33,629
off CO2 and I was like completely
completely failed and I bent burnt half

5436
01:47:33,629 --> 01:47:33,639
completely failed and I bent burnt half
 

5437
01:47:33,639 --> 01:47:36,470
completely failed and I bent burnt half
the the garage down so my parents were

5438
01:47:36,470 --> 01:47:36,480
the the garage down so my parents were
 

5439
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:38,510
the the garage down so my parents were
not very happy about that but so that

5440
01:47:38,510 --> 01:47:38,520
not very happy about that but so that
 

5441
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:39,750
not very happy about that but so that
was one thing I was like I really like

you know it's wrong okay why is it wrong
 

5561
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:55,350
you know it's wrong okay why is it wrong
say oh it doesn't your equation's

5562
01:49:55,350 --> 01:49:55,360
say oh it doesn't your equation's
 

5563
01:49:55,360 --> 01:49:57,709
say oh it doesn't your equation's
incorrect for this or your method is

01:50:35,550 --> 01:50:35,560
say well what about this and you know
 

5597
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:37,229
say well what about this and you know
and sometimes I'm kind of you know my

5598
01:50:37,229 --> 01:50:37,239
and sometimes I'm kind of you know my
 

5599
01:50:37,239 --> 01:50:40,709
and sometimes I'm kind of you know my
filters are kind of uh you know trunca

5600
01:50:40,709 --> 01:50:40,719
filters are kind of uh you know trunca
 

5601
01:50:40,719 --> 01:50:41,990
filters are kind of uh you know trunca
in some ways I'm just like that's wrong

5602
01:50:41,990 --> 01:50:42,000
in some ways I'm just like that's wrong
 

5603
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,189
in some ways I'm just like that's wrong
that's wrong that's wrong want do this

5604
01:50:43,189 --> 01:50:43,199
that's wrong that's wrong want do this
 

5605
01:50:43,199 --> 01:50:44,950
that's wrong that's wrong want do this
and people like oh my God you just told

5606
01:50:44,950 --> 01:50:44,960
and people like oh my God you just told
 

5607
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:47,669
and people like oh my God you just told
me you destroyed my life's work I'm like

5608
01:50:47,669 --> 01:50:47,679
me you destroyed my life's work I'm like
 

5609
01:50:47,679 --> 01:50:50,109
me you destroyed my life's work I'm like
relax no I'm just like let's make it

5610
01:50:50,109 --> 01:50:50,119
relax no I'm just like let's make it
 

5611
01:50:50,119 --> 01:50:52,550
relax no I'm just like let's make it
better and I think that we don't do that

5612
01:50:52,550 --> 01:50:52,560
better and I think that we don't do that
 

5613
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:55,709
better and I think that we don't do that
enough cuz we're we're you know we we're

5614
01:50:55,709 --> 01:50:55,719
enough cuz we're we're you know we we're
 

5615
01:50:55,719 --> 01:50:58,109
enough cuz we're we're you know we we're
we're we're either personally critical

5616
01:50:58,109 --> 01:50:58,119
we're we're either personally critical
 

5617
01:50:58,119 --> 01:51:00,189
we're we're either personally critical
which isn't helpful or we don't give any

5618
01:51:00,189 --> 01:51:00,199
which isn't helpful or we don't give any
 

5619
01:51:00,199 --> 01:51:02,709
which isn't helpful or we don't give any
criticism at all because we're too

5620
01:51:02,709 --> 01:51:02,719
criticism at all because we're too
 

5621
01:51:02,719 --> 01:51:08,149
criticism at all because we're too
scared yeah I yeah the I've seen you be

5622
01:51:08,149 --> 01:51:08,159
scared yeah I yeah the I've seen you be
 

5623
01:51:08,159 --> 01:51:11,149
scared yeah I yeah the I've seen you be
pretty aggressively critical but it's

5624
01:51:11,149 --> 01:51:11,159
pretty aggressively critical but it's
 

5625
01:51:11,159 --> 01:51:13,310
pretty aggressively critical but it's
every time I've seen it it's the idea

5626
01:51:13,310 --> 01:51:13,320
every time I've seen it it's the idea
 

5627
01:51:13,320 --> 01:51:16,430
every time I've seen it it's the idea
not the person um I I'm sure I make

not the person um I I'm sure I make
 

5629
01:51:16,440 --> 01:51:18,109
not the person um I I'm sure I make
mistakes on that I mean I I you know I

argue Lots with Sarah and she's like

5634
01:51:23,669 --> 01:51:23,679
argue Lots with Sarah and she's like
 

5635
01:51:23,679 --> 01:51:25,270
argue Lots with Sarah and she's like
kind of shocked I've argued with yasher

5636
01:51:25,270 --> 01:51:25,280
kind of shocked I've argued with yasher
 

5637
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:26,830
kind of shocked I've argued with yasher
in the past and he's like you're just

5638
01:51:26,830 --> 01:51:26,840
in the past and he's like you're just
 

5639
01:51:26,840 --> 01:51:28,229
in the past and he's like you're just
making yashab B and you're like you're

5640
01:51:28,229 --> 01:51:28,239
making yashab B and you're like you're
 

5641
01:51:28,239 --> 01:51:31,030
making yashab B and you're like you're
just making that up I'm like no not not

5642
01:51:31,030 --> 01:51:31,040
just making that up I'm like no not not
 

5643
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:35,350
just making that up I'm like no not not
quite but kind of yeah um you know I had

5644
01:51:35,350 --> 01:51:35,360
quite but kind of yeah um you know I had
 

5645
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:37,030
quite but kind of yeah um you know I had
a big argument with Sarah about time

5646
01:51:37,030 --> 01:51:37,040
a big argument with Sarah about time
 

5647
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:38,950
a big argument with Sarah about time
she's like no time time doesn't exist

5648
01:51:38,950 --> 01:51:38,960
she's like no time time doesn't exist
 

5649
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:41,109
she's like no time time doesn't exist
I'm like no no time does exist and now

5650
01:51:41,109 --> 01:51:41,119
I'm like no no time does exist and now
 

5651
01:51:41,119 --> 01:51:43,430
I'm like no no time does exist and now
and then as she realized that her

5652
01:51:43,430 --> 01:51:43,440
and then as she realized that her
 

5653
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:46,189
and then as she realized that her
conception of assembly Theory and my

5654
01:51:46,189 --> 01:51:46,199
conception of assembly Theory and my
 

5655
01:51:46,199 --> 01:51:47,629
conception of assembly Theory and my
conception assembly Theory were the same

5656
01:51:47,629 --> 01:51:47,639
conception assembly Theory were the same
 

5657
01:51:47,639 --> 01:51:50,910
conception assembly Theory were the same
thing necessitated us to abandon

5658
01:51:50,910 --> 01:51:50,920
thing necessitated us to abandon
 

5659
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:53,390
thing necessitated us to abandon
the fact that time is eternal to

5660
01:51:53,390 --> 01:51:53,400
the fact that time is eternal to
 

5661
01:51:53,400 --> 01:51:55,750
the fact that time is eternal to
actually really fundamentally question

5662
01:51:55,750 --> 01:51:55,760
actually really fundamentally question
 

5663
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:57,589
actually really fundamentally question
how the universe produces commentarial

5664
01:51:57,589 --> 01:51:57,599
how the universe produces commentarial
 

5665
01:51:57,599 --> 01:52:00,950
how the universe produces commentarial
novelty so so time is fundamental for

5666
01:52:00,950 --> 01:52:00,960
novelty so so time is fundamental for
 

5667
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:03,629
novelty so so time is fundamental for
ass Theory um I'm just trying to figure

5668
01:52:03,629 --> 01:52:03,639
ass Theory um I'm just trying to figure
 

5669
01:52:03,639 --> 01:52:06,149
ass Theory um I'm just trying to figure
out where you and Sarah converged I

5670
01:52:06,149 --> 01:52:06,159
out where you and Sarah converged I
 

5671
01:52:06,159 --> 01:52:08,030
out where you and Sarah converged I
think assembly theory is fine in this

5672
01:52:08,030 --> 01:52:08,040
think assembly theory is fine in this
 

5673
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:10,270
think assembly theory is fine in this
time right now but I think it helps us

5674
01:52:10,270 --> 01:52:10,280
time right now but I think it helps us
 

5675
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:12,030
time right now but I think it helps us
understand that something interesting is

5676
01:52:12,030 --> 01:52:12,040
understand that something interesting is
 

5677
01:52:12,040 --> 01:52:14,350
understand that something interesting is
going on so there's and I'm me really

5678
01:52:14,350 --> 01:52:14,360
going on so there's and I'm me really
 

5679
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:17,470
going on so there's and I'm me really

I'm going to butcher his argument but I

5682
01:52:18,870 --> 01:52:18,880
I'm going to butcher his argument but I
 

5683
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:20,669
I'm going to butcher his argument but I
love his argument a lot so so I hope he

5684
01:52:20,669 --> 01:52:20,679
love his argument a lot so so I hope he
 

5685
01:52:20,679 --> 01:52:23,350
love his argument a lot so so I hope he
forgives me if he hears about it but

5686
01:52:23,350 --> 01:52:23,360
forgives me if he hears about it but
 

5687
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:27,870
forgives me if he hears about it but
basically um if you want free will time

5688
01:52:27,870 --> 01:52:27,880
basically um if you want free will time
 

5689
01:52:27,880 --> 01:52:29,950
basically um if you want free will time
has to be

5690
01:52:29,950 --> 01:52:29,960
has to be
 

5691
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:33,589
has to be
fundamental and we can go a and um if

5692
01:52:33,589 --> 01:52:33,599
fundamental and we can go a and um if
 

5693
01:52:33,599 --> 01:52:36,629
fundamental and we can go a and um if
you want time to be

5694
01:52:36,629 --> 01:52:36,639
you want time to be
 

5695
01:52:36,639 --> 01:52:38,510
you want time to be
fundamental

5696
01:52:38,510 --> 01:52:38,520
fundamental
 

5697
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:42,470
fundamental
um you have to give up on platonic

5698
01:52:42,470 --> 01:52:42,480
um you have to give up on platonic
 

5699
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:44,270
um you have to give up on platonic
mathematics and you have to use

5700
01:52:44,270 --> 01:52:44,280
mathematics and you have to use
 

5701
01:52:44,280 --> 01:52:46,350
mathematics and you have to use
intuitionist mathematics by the by the

5702
01:52:46,350 --> 01:52:46,360
intuitionist mathematics by the by the
 

5703
01:52:46,360 --> 01:52:48,510
intuitionist mathematics by the by the
way um and again I'm going to butcher

5704
01:52:48,510 --> 01:52:48,520
way um and again I'm going to butcher
 

5705
01:52:48,520 --> 01:52:50,470
way um and again I'm going to butcher
this but basically

5706
01:52:50,470 --> 01:52:50,480
this but basically
 

5707
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:53,430
this but basically

Brower said no you can't all numbers are

5712
01:52:59,990 --> 01:53:00,000
Brower said no you can't all numbers are
 

5713
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,550
Brower said no you can't all numbers are
finite so they kind of like we so let's

5714
01:53:02,550 --> 01:53:02,560
finite so they kind of like we so let's
 

5715
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:04,069
finite so they kind of like we so let's
go back a step because I was like people

5716
01:53:04,069 --> 01:53:04,079
go back a step because I was like people
 

5717
01:53:04,079 --> 01:53:06,709
go back a step because I was like people

01:53:50,639 --> 01:53:54,109
the way the present builds the future so
big the universe can't ever contain the

5750
01:53:54,109 --> 01:53:54,119
big the universe can't ever contain the
 

5751
01:53:54,119 --> 01:53:56,390
big the universe can't ever contain the
future and this is a really interesting

5752
01:53:56,390 --> 01:53:56,400
future and this is a really interesting
 

5753
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:58,189
future and this is a really interesting
thing I think Max techmark has this

5754
01:53:58,189 --> 01:53:58,199
thing I think Max techmark has this
 

5755
01:53:58,199 --> 01:53:59,950
thing I think Max techmark has this
mathematical Universe he says you know

5756
01:53:59,950 --> 01:53:59,960
mathematical Universe he says you know
 

5757
01:53:59,960 --> 01:54:01,430
mathematical Universe he says you know
the universe is kind of like a block

5758
01:54:01,430 --> 01:54:01,440
the universe is kind of like a block
 

5759
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:03,870
the universe is kind of like a block
universe and I apologize to Max if I'm

5760
01:54:03,870 --> 01:54:03,880
universe and I apologize to Max if I'm
 

5761
01:54:03,880 --> 01:54:05,510
universe and I apologize to Max if I'm
getting it wrong but people think you

5762
01:54:05,510 --> 01:54:05,520
getting it wrong but people think you
 

5763
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:07,390
getting it wrong but people think you
can just move you have the stat you have

5764
01:54:07,390 --> 01:54:07,400
can just move you have the stat you have
 

5765
01:54:07,400 --> 01:54:08,750
can just move you have the stat you have
the initial

5766
01:54:08,750 --> 01:54:08,760
the initial
 

5767
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:12,390
the initial
conditions and you can run the Universe

5768
01:54:12,390 --> 01:54:12,400
conditions and you can run the Universe
 

5769
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:14,069
conditions and you can run the Universe
um right to the end and go backwards and

5770
01:54:14,069 --> 01:54:14,079
um right to the end and go backwards and
 

5771
01:54:14,079 --> 01:54:16,109
um right to the end and go backwards and
forwards in that universe that is not

5772
01:54:16,109 --> 01:54:16,119
forwards in that universe that is not
 

5773
01:54:16,119 --> 01:54:18,310
forwards in that universe that is not
correct well let me load that in the

5774
01:54:18,310 --> 01:54:18,320
correct well let me load that in the
 

5775
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:20,109
correct well let me load that in the
universe is not big enough to contain

5776
01:54:20,109 --> 01:54:20,119
universe is not big enough to contain
 

5777
01:54:20,119 --> 01:54:22,910
universe is not big enough to contain
the future yeah that's why that's it so

5778
01:54:22,910 --> 01:54:22,920
the future yeah that's why that's it so
 

5779
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:24,790
the future yeah that's why that's it so
that that's another that's a beautiful

5780
01:54:24,790 --> 01:54:24,800
that that's another that's a beautiful
 

5781
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:26,910
that that's another that's a beautiful
way of saying that time is fundamental

5782
01:54:26,910 --> 01:54:26,920
way of saying that time is fundamental
 

5783
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:30,229
way of saying that time is fundamental
yes and and that you can have and that's

5784
01:54:30,229 --> 01:54:30,239
yes and and that you can have and that's
 

5785
01:54:30,239 --> 01:54:32,870
yes and and that you can have and that's
what this is why um the ex the law of

5786
01:54:32,870 --> 01:54:32,880
what this is why um the ex the law of
 

5787
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:35,430
what this is why um the ex the law of
the excluded middle something is true or

5788
01:54:35,430 --> 01:54:35,440
the excluded middle something is true or
 

5789
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:39,030
the excluded middle something is true or
False only works in the

5790
01:54:39,030 --> 01:54:39,040

 

5791
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:41,350

past is it going to snow in New York

5792
01:54:41,350 --> 01:54:41,360
past is it going to snow in New York
 

5793
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:43,629
past is it going to snow in New York
next week or in Austin you might in

5794
01:54:43,629 --> 01:54:43,639
next week or in Austin you might in
 

5795
01:54:43,639 --> 01:54:45,709
next week or in Austin you might in
Austin say probably not in New York you

5796
01:54:45,709 --> 01:54:45,719
Austin say probably not in New York you
 

5797
01:54:45,719 --> 01:54:47,910
Austin say probably not in New York you
might say yeah if you go forward to next

5798
01:54:47,910 --> 01:54:47,920
might say yeah if you go forward to next
 

5799
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:49,750
might say yeah if you go forward to next
week and say did it snow in New York

5800
01:54:49,750 --> 01:54:49,760
week and say did it snow in New York
 

5801
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:51,910
week and say did it snow in New York
York last week true or false you can

5802
01:54:51,910 --> 01:54:51,920
York last week true or false you can
 

5803
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:54,350
York last week true or false you can
answer that question the fact that the

5804
01:54:54,350 --> 01:54:54,360
answer that question the fact that the
 

5805
01:54:54,360 --> 01:54:56,390
answer that question the fact that the
law of the excluded middle cannot apply

5806
01:54:56,390 --> 01:54:56,400
law of the excluded middle cannot apply
 

5807
01:54:56,400 --> 01:54:59,430
law of the excluded middle cannot apply
to the Future explains why time is

5808
01:54:59,430 --> 01:54:59,440
to the Future explains why time is
 

5809
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:01,950
to the Future explains why time is
fundamental well I mean that that that's

5810
01:55:01,950 --> 01:55:01,960
fundamental well I mean that that that's
 

5811
01:55:01,960 --> 01:55:03,750
fundamental well I mean that that that's
a good example intuitive example but

5812
01:55:03,750 --> 01:55:03,760
a good example intuitive example but
 

5813
01:55:03,760 --> 01:55:05,950
a good example intuitive example but
it's possible that we might be able to

5814
01:55:05,950 --> 01:55:05,960
it's possible that we might be able to
 

5815
01:55:05,960 --> 01:55:08,350
it's possible that we might be able to
predict you know whether it's going to

5816
01:55:08,350 --> 01:55:08,360
predict you know whether it's going to
 

5817
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:11,149
predict you know whether it's going to
snow if we had perfect information I I

5818
01:55:11,149 --> 01:55:11,159
snow if we had perfect information I I
 

5819
01:55:11,159 --> 01:55:14,390
snow if we had perfect information I I
think we you're saying not

5820
01:55:14,390 --> 01:55:14,400
think we you're saying not
 

5821
01:55:14,400 --> 01:55:17,550
think we you're saying not
impossible impossible so here's why yeah

5822
01:55:17,550 --> 01:55:17,560
impossible impossible so here's why yeah
 

5823
01:55:17,560 --> 01:55:19,669
impossible impossible so here's why yeah
I'll make a really quick argument and

5824
01:55:19,669 --> 01:55:19,679
I'll make a really quick argument and
 

5825
01:55:19,679 --> 01:55:21,790
I'll make a really quick argument and
this argument isn't mine it's it's Nicks

5826
01:55:21,790 --> 01:55:21,800
this argument isn't mine it's it's Nicks
 

5827
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:23,830
this argument isn't mine it's it's Nicks
and and a few other people can you can

5828
01:55:23,830 --> 01:55:23,840
and and a few other people can you can
 

5829
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:26,669
and and a few other people can you can
you explain his view on fundamental on

5830
01:55:26,669 --> 01:55:26,679
you explain his view on fundamental on
 

5831
01:55:26,679 --> 01:55:29,189
you explain his view on fundamental on
time being fundamental yeah so I'll give

5832
01:55:29,189 --> 01:55:29,199
time being fundamental yeah so I'll give
 

5833
01:55:29,199 --> 01:55:31,189
time being fundamental yeah so I'll give
my view which kind of resonates with his

5834
01:55:31,189 --> 01:55:31,199
my view which kind of resonates with his
 

5835
01:55:31,199 --> 01:55:34,589
my view which kind of resonates with his
but basically um it's very simple

5836
01:55:34,589 --> 01:55:34,599
but basically um it's very simple
 

5837
01:55:34,599 --> 01:55:36,430
but basically um it's very simple
actually it would say that free will

5838
01:55:36,430 --> 01:55:36,440
actually it would say that free will
 

5839
01:55:36,440 --> 01:55:38,350
actually it would say that free will
your ability to design and do an

5840
01:55:38,350 --> 01:55:38,360
your ability to design and do an
 

5841
01:55:38,360 --> 01:55:41,390
your ability to design and do an
experiment uh is exercising Free Will so

5842
01:55:41,390 --> 01:55:41,400
experiment uh is exercising Free Will so
 

5843
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:43,030
experiment uh is exercising Free Will so
he used that thought process I never

5844
01:55:43,030 --> 01:55:43,040
he used that thought process I never
 

5845
01:55:43,040 --> 01:55:45,390
he used that thought process I never
really thought about it that way um and

5846
01:55:45,390 --> 01:55:45,400
really thought about it that way um and
 

5847
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:46,990
really thought about it that way um and
that you actively make

5848
01:55:46,990 --> 01:55:47,000
that you actively make
 

5849
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,830
that you actively make
decisions I do think that I used to

5850
01:55:49,830 --> 01:55:49,840
decisions I do think that I used to
 

5851
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:52,790
decisions I do think that I used to
think that Free Will was a kind of kind

5852
01:55:52,790 --> 01:55:52,800
think that Free Will was a kind of kind
 

5853
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:55,189
think that Free Will was a kind of kind
of consequence of just selection but I'm

5854
01:55:55,189 --> 01:55:55,199
of consequence of just selection but I'm
 

5855
01:55:55,199 --> 01:55:56,709
of consequence of just selection but I'm
kind of understanding that human Free

5856
01:55:56,709 --> 01:55:56,719
kind of understanding that human Free
 

5857
01:55:56,719 --> 01:55:58,069
kind of understanding that human Free
Will is something really

5858
01:55:58,069 --> 01:55:58,079
Will is something really
 

5859
01:55:58,079 --> 01:56:00,950
Will is something really
interesting um and he very much inspired

5860
01:56:00,950 --> 01:56:00,960
interesting um and he very much inspired
 

5861
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:03,189
interesting um and he very much inspired
me but a thing that what Sarah Walker

5862
01:56:03,189 --> 01:56:03,199
me but a thing that what Sarah Walker
 

5863
01:56:03,199 --> 01:56:05,830
me but a thing that what Sarah Walker
said that inspired me as well that that

5864
01:56:05,830 --> 01:56:05,840
said that inspired me as well that that
 

5865
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:08,510
said that inspired me as well that that
um these will converge is that I think

5866
01:56:08,510 --> 01:56:08,520
um these will converge is that I think
 

5867
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:11,030
um these will converge is that I think
that the Universe in the universe is

5868
01:56:11,030 --> 01:56:11,040
that the Universe in the universe is
 

5869
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:14,109
that the Universe in the universe is
very big huge MH but

5870
01:56:14,109 --> 01:56:14,119
very big huge MH but
 

5871
01:56:14,119 --> 01:56:16,510
very big huge MH but
actually the own the place that is

5872
01:56:16,510 --> 01:56:16,520
actually the own the place that is
 

5873
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:18,790
actually the own the place that is
largest in the universe right now the

5874
01:56:18,790 --> 01:56:18,800
largest in the universe right now the
 

5875
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:21,350
largest in the universe right now the
largest place in un is Earth yeah I've

5876
01:56:21,350 --> 01:56:21,360
largest place in un is Earth yeah I've
 

5877
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:25,390
largest place in un is Earth yeah I've
I've seen you say that and boy does

5878
01:56:25,390 --> 01:56:25,400
I've seen you say that and boy does
 

5879
01:56:25,400 --> 01:56:27,629
I've seen you say that and boy does
that that's a that's an interesting one

5880
01:56:27,629 --> 01:56:27,639
that that's a that's an interesting one
 

5881
01:56:27,639 --> 01:56:28,910
that that's a that's an interesting one
to process what do you mean by that

5882
01:56:28,910 --> 01:56:28,920
to process what do you mean by that
 

5883
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:30,470
to process what do you mean by that
Earth is the biggest place in the

5884
01:56:30,470 --> 01:56:30,480
Earth is the biggest place in the
 

5885
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:32,589
Earth is the biggest place in the
universe because we have this commentor

5886
01:56:32,589 --> 01:56:32,599
universe because we have this commentor
 

5887
01:56:32,599 --> 01:56:34,589
universe because we have this commentor
scaffolding going all the way back from

5888
01:56:34,589 --> 01:56:34,599
scaffolding going all the way back from
 

5889
01:56:34,599 --> 01:56:36,990
scaffolding going all the way back from
Luca so you've have you've got cells

5890
01:56:36,990 --> 01:56:37,000
Luca so you've have you've got cells
 

5891
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,229
Luca so you've have you've got cells
that can self-replicate and then you go

5892
01:56:39,229 --> 01:56:39,239
that can self-replicate and then you go
 

5893
01:56:39,239 --> 01:56:41,189
that can self-replicate and then you go
all the way to terraforming the Earth

5894
01:56:41,189 --> 01:56:41,199
all the way to terraforming the Earth
 

5895
01:56:41,199 --> 01:56:43,069
all the way to terraforming the Earth
You' got all these architectures the

5896
01:56:43,069 --> 01:56:43,079
You' got all these architectures the
 

5897
01:56:43,079 --> 01:56:44,669
You' got all these architectures the
amount of selection that's going on

5898
01:56:44,669 --> 01:56:44,679
amount of selection that's going on
 

5899
01:56:44,679 --> 01:56:46,990
amount of selection that's going on
biological selection just to be clear

5900
01:56:46,990 --> 01:56:47,000
biological selection just to be clear
 

5901
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:50,310
biological selection just to be clear
biological evolution and then you have

5902
01:56:50,310 --> 01:56:50,320
biological evolution and then you have
 

5903
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:52,550
biological evolution and then you have
multicellularity then animals and

5904
01:56:52,550 --> 01:56:52,560
multicellularity then animals and
 

5905
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:54,350
multicellularity then animals and
abstraction and when abstraction there

5906
01:56:54,350 --> 01:56:54,360
abstraction and when abstraction there
 

5907
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:56,350
abstraction and when abstraction there
was another kick because you can then

5908
01:56:56,350 --> 01:56:56,360
was another kick because you can then
 

5909
01:56:56,360 --> 01:56:59,510
was another kick because you can then
build architectures and computers and

5910
01:56:59,510 --> 01:56:59,520
build architectures and computers and
 

5911
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:01,950
build architectures and computers and
cultures and language and these things

5912
01:57:01,950 --> 01:57:01,960
cultures and language and these things
 

5913
01:57:01,960 --> 01:57:03,430
cultures and language and these things
are the biggest things exist in the

5914
01:57:03,430 --> 01:57:03,440
are the biggest things exist in the
 

5915
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:05,430
are the biggest things exist in the
universe because we can just Build

5916
01:57:05,430 --> 01:57:05,440
universe because we can just Build
 

5917
01:57:05,440 --> 01:57:07,270
universe because we can just Build
architectures That Could naturally arise

5918
01:57:07,270 --> 01:57:07,280
architectures That Could naturally arise
 

5919
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:09,270
architectures That Could naturally arise
anywhere and the further that distance

5920
01:57:09,270 --> 01:57:09,280
anywhere and the further that distance
 

5921
01:57:09,280 --> 01:57:12,910
anywhere and the further that distance
goes in time and this kind of is just

5922
01:57:12,910 --> 01:57:12,920
goes in time and this kind of is just
 

5923
01:57:12,920 --> 01:57:16,430
goes in time and this kind of is just
it's gigantic mhm and from a complexity

5924
01:57:16,430 --> 01:57:16,440
it's gigantic mhm and from a complexity
 

5925
01:57:16,440 --> 01:57:18,950
it's gigantic mhm and from a complexity
perspective yeah okay wait a minute but

5926
01:57:18,950 --> 01:57:18,960
perspective yeah okay wait a minute but
 

5927
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:21,229
perspective yeah okay wait a minute but
I mean I know you're being poetic but

5928
01:57:21,229 --> 01:57:21,239
I mean I know you're being poetic but
 

5929
01:57:21,239 --> 01:57:23,149
I mean I know you're being poetic but
how do you know there's not other earth

5930
01:57:23,149 --> 01:57:23,159
how do you know there's not other earth
 

5931
01:57:23,159 --> 01:57:27,030
how do you know there's not other earth
like uh like how do you know you're

5932
01:57:27,030 --> 01:57:27,040
like uh like how do you know you're
 

5933
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:28,629
like uh like how do you know you're
you're basically saying Earth is really

5934
01:57:28,629 --> 01:57:28,639
you're basically saying Earth is really
 

5935
01:57:28,639 --> 01:57:30,990
you're basically saying Earth is really
special it's awesome stuff as far as we

5936
01:57:30,990 --> 01:57:31,000
special it's awesome stuff as far as we
 

5937
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:32,830
special it's awesome stuff as far as we
look out there's nothing like it going

5938
01:57:32,830 --> 01:57:32,840
look out there's nothing like it going
 

5939
01:57:32,840 --> 01:57:35,910
look out there's nothing like it going
on but how do you know there's not

5940
01:57:35,910 --> 01:57:35,920
on but how do you know there's not
 

5941
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:38,310
on but how do you know there's not
nearly infinite number of places where

5942
01:57:38,310 --> 01:57:38,320
nearly infinite number of places where
 

5943
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:40,950
nearly infinite number of places where
cool stuff like this is going on I agree

5944
01:57:40,950 --> 01:57:40,960
cool stuff like this is going on I agree
 

5945
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:44,069
cool stuff like this is going on I agree
and I would say I I'll say again that

5946
01:57:44,069 --> 01:57:44,079
and I would say I I'll say again that
 

5947
01:57:44,079 --> 01:57:47,149
and I would say I I'll say again that
Earth is the most gigantic thing we know

5948
01:57:47,149 --> 01:57:47,159
Earth is the most gigantic thing we know
 

5949
01:57:47,159 --> 01:57:49,950
Earth is the most gigantic thing we know
in the universe commentor we know we

5950
01:57:49,950 --> 01:57:49,960
in the universe commentor we know we
 

5951
01:57:49,960 --> 01:57:53,669
in the universe commentor we know we
know now now I guess this is just purely

5952
01:57:53,669 --> 01:57:53,679
know now now I guess this is just purely
 

5953
01:57:53,679 --> 01:57:55,550
know now now I guess this is just purely
a guess I have no data but other than

5954
01:57:55,550 --> 01:57:55,560
a guess I have no data but other than
 

5955
01:57:55,560 --> 01:57:58,030
a guess I have no data but other than
hope well maybe not hope maybe no I have

5956
01:57:58,030 --> 01:57:58,040
hope well maybe not hope maybe no I have
 

5957
01:57:58,040 --> 01:58:02,629
hope well maybe not hope maybe no I have
some data um that every star in the sky

5958
01:58:02,629 --> 01:58:02,639
some data um that every star in the sky
 

5959
01:58:02,639 --> 01:58:06,510
some data um that every star in the sky
probably has planets Y and life is

5960
01:58:06,510 --> 01:58:06,520
probably has planets Y and life is
 

5961
01:58:06,520 --> 01:58:08,870
probably has planets Y and life is
probably emerging on these planets but

5962
01:58:08,870 --> 01:58:08,880
probably emerging on these planets but
 

5963
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:11,910
probably emerging on these planets but
this the amount of contingency that is

5964
01:58:11,910 --> 01:58:11,920
this the amount of contingency that is
 

5965
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:14,430
this the amount of contingency that is
associated with life is that I think the

5966
01:58:14,430 --> 01:58:14,440
associated with life is that I think the
 

5967
01:58:14,440 --> 01:58:16,109
associated with life is that I think the
commentarial space associated with these

5968
01:58:16,109 --> 01:58:16,119
commentarial space associated with these
 

5969
01:58:16,119 --> 01:58:18,629
commentarial space associated with these
planets is so different we are never

5970
01:58:18,629 --> 01:58:18,639
planets is so different we are never
 

5971
01:58:18,639 --> 01:58:20,870
planets is so different we are never
going to our cones are never going to

5972
01:58:20,870 --> 01:58:20,880
going to our cones are never going to
 

5973
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:23,149
going to our cones are never going to
overlap or not easily and this is a

5974
01:58:23,149 --> 01:58:23,159
overlap or not easily and this is a
 

5975
01:58:23,159 --> 01:58:25,229
overlap or not easily and this is a
thing that makes me sad about alien life

5976
01:58:25,229 --> 01:58:25,239
thing that makes me sad about alien life
 

5977
01:58:25,239 --> 01:58:27,149
thing that makes me sad about alien life
why why we have to create alien life in

5978
01:58:27,149 --> 01:58:27,159
why why we have to create alien life in
 

5979
01:58:27,159 --> 01:58:30,709
why why we have to create alien life in
the lab as quickly as possible because I

5980
01:58:30,709 --> 01:58:30,719
the lab as quickly as possible because I
 

5981
01:58:30,719 --> 01:58:33,709
the lab as quickly as possible because I
don't know if we are going to be able to

5982
01:58:33,709 --> 01:58:33,719
don't know if we are going to be able to
 

5983
01:58:33,719 --> 01:58:34,910
don't know if we are going to be able to
be able to

5984
01:58:34,910 --> 01:58:34,920
be able to
 

5985
01:58:34,920 --> 01:58:38,310
be able to
build um architectures that will

5986
01:58:38,310 --> 01:58:38,320
build um architectures that will
 

5987
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:41,750
build um architectures that will
intersect with alien Co intelligence C

5988
01:58:41,750 --> 01:58:41,760
intersect with alien Co intelligence C
 

5989
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:44,430
intersect with alien Co intelligence C
and architectures intersect you you know

5990
01:58:44,430 --> 01:58:44,440
and architectures intersect you you know
 

5991
01:58:44,440 --> 01:58:46,629
and architectures intersect you you know
what I mean in time or space time and

5992
01:58:46,629 --> 01:58:46,639
what I mean in time or space time and
 

5993
01:58:46,639 --> 01:58:48,310
what I mean in time or space time and
the ability to communicate the ability

5994
01:58:48,310 --> 01:58:48,320
the ability to communicate the ability
 

5995
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:51,030
the ability to communicate the ability
to communicate yeah my biggest fear in a

5996
01:58:51,030 --> 01:58:51,040
to communicate yeah my biggest fear in a
 

5997
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:53,350
to communicate yeah my biggest fear in a
way is that life is everywhere but we

5998
01:58:53,350 --> 01:58:53,360
way is that life is everywhere but we
 

5999
01:58:53,360 --> 01:58:55,149
way is that life is everywhere but we
become infinitely more lonely because of

6000
01:58:55,149 --> 01:58:55,159
become infinitely more lonely because of
 

6001
01:58:55,159 --> 01:58:58,229
become infinitely more lonely because of
our Scaffolding in that commentor space

6002
01:58:58,229 --> 01:58:58,239
our Scaffolding in that commentor space
 

6003
01:58:58,239 --> 01:59:00,990
our Scaffolding in that commentor space
because it's so big and so so you're

6004
01:59:00,990 --> 01:59:01,000
because it's so big and so so you're
 

6005
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,430
because it's so big and so so you're
saying the the constraints created by

6006
01:59:03,430 --> 01:59:03,440
saying the the constraints created by
 

6007
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:06,750
saying the the constraints created by
the environment that led to the factory

6008
01:59:06,750 --> 01:59:06,760
the environment that led to the factory
 

6009
01:59:06,760 --> 01:59:08,830
the environment that led to the factory
of darwinian

6010
01:59:08,830 --> 01:59:08,840
of darwinian
 

6011
01:59:08,840 --> 01:59:11,270
of darwinian
evolution are just like this a little

6012
01:59:11,270 --> 01:59:11,280
evolution are just like this a little
 

6013
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:12,870
evolution are just like this a little
tiny cone in a nearly Infinite

6014
01:59:12,870 --> 01:59:12,880
tiny cone in a nearly Infinite
 

6015
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:14,950
tiny cone in a nearly Infinite
combinatorial Space so there's other

6016
01:59:14,950 --> 01:59:14,960
combinatorial Space so there's other
 

6017
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:19,310
combinatorial Space so there's other
cones like it and and what why can't we

6018
01:59:19,310 --> 01:59:19,320
cones like it and and what why can't we
 

6019
01:59:19,320 --> 01:59:22,030
cones like it and and what why can't we
communicate with other like just because

6020
01:59:22,030 --> 01:59:22,040
communicate with other like just because
 

6021
01:59:22,040 --> 01:59:25,310
communicate with other like just because
we can't create it doesn't mean we can't

6022
01:59:25,310 --> 01:59:25,320
we can't create it doesn't mean we can't
 

6023
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:28,069
we can't create it doesn't mean we can't
appreciate the creation right like that

6024
01:59:28,069 --> 01:59:28,079
appreciate the creation right like that
 

6025
01:59:28,079 --> 01:59:31,030
appreciate the creation right like that
sorry detect the creation I I I truly

6026
01:59:31,030 --> 01:59:31,040
sorry detect the creation I I I truly
 

6027
01:59:31,040 --> 01:59:33,470
sorry detect the creation I I I truly
don't know but I it's an excuse for me

6028
01:59:33,470 --> 01:59:33,480
don't know but I it's an excuse for me
 

6029
01:59:33,480 --> 01:59:34,950
don't know but I it's an excuse for me
to ask for people to give me money to

6030
01:59:34,950 --> 01:59:34,960
to ask for people to give me money to
 

6031
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:37,149
to ask for people to give me money to
make a planet simulator yeah right if I

6032
01:59:37,149 --> 01:59:37,159
make a planet simulator yeah right if I
 

6033
01:59:37,159 --> 01:59:40,149
make a planet simulator yeah right if I
can make with a different different like

6034
01:59:40,149 --> 01:59:40,159
can make with a different different like
 

6035
01:59:40,159 --> 01:59:41,589
can make with a different different like
another Shameless say it's like give me

6036
01:59:41,589 --> 01:59:41,599
another Shameless say it's like give me
 

6037
01:59:41,599 --> 01:59:43,709
another Shameless say it's like give me
money I need money this was all long

6038
01:59:43,709 --> 01:59:43,719
money I need money this was all long
 

6039
01:59:43,719 --> 01:59:46,310
money I need money this was all long
plug for a planet simulator it's like

6040
01:59:46,310 --> 01:59:46,320
plug for a planet simulator it's like
 

6041
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:47,950
plug for a planet simulator it's like
you know hey I will be the first in line

6042
01:59:47,950 --> 01:59:47,960
you know hey I will be the first in line
 

6043

to my my my my Rick my Rick garage has
 

6045
01:59:51,679 --> 01:59:55,830
to my my my my Rick my Rick garage has
run out of room you know yeah no um and

6046
01:59:55,830 --> 01:59:55,840
run out of room you know yeah no um and
 

6047
01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:57,990
run out of room you know yeah no um and
this is a planet simulator you mean like

6048
01:59:57,990 --> 01:59:58,000
this is a planet simulator you mean like
 

6049
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:59,910
this is a planet simulator you mean like
a different kind of planet or different

6050
01:59:59,910 --> 01:59:59,920
a different kind of planet or different
 

6051
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:01,750
a different kind of planet or different
sets of environments and pressures

6052

sets of environments and pressures
 

6053
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:04,350
sets of environments and pressures
exactly if we could basically recreate

6054
02:00:04,350 --> 02:00:04,360
exactly if we could basically recreate
 

6055
02:00:04,360 --> 02:00:07,830
exactly if we could basically recreate
the selection before biology as we know

6056
02:00:07,830 --> 02:00:07,840
the selection before biology as we know
 

6057
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:09,790
the selection before biology as we know

02:03:24,639 --> 02:03:25,510
dot said look how big universe is I
would have done it the other way around

6216
02:03:25,510 --> 02:03:25,520
would have done it the other way around
 

6217
02:03:25,520 --> 02:03:27,030
would have done it the other way around
said look at the Voyager prob that came

6218
02:03:27,030 --> 02:03:27,040
said look at the Voyager prob that came
 

6219
02:03:27,040 --> 02:03:28,189
said look at the Voyager prob that came
from the planet Earth that came from

6220
02:03:28,189 --> 02:03:28,199
from the planet Earth that came from

Luca look at how big Earth is

6222
02:03:30,870 --> 02:03:30,880
Luca look at how big Earth is
 

6223
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:33,510
Luca look at how big Earth is
MHM then it produced that It produced

6224
02:03:33,510 --> 02:03:33,520
MHM then it produced that It produced
 

6225
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:35,790
MHM then it produced that It produced
that yeah and that I think is like

6226
02:03:35,790 --> 02:03:35,800
that yeah and that I think is like
 

6227
02:03:35,800 --> 02:03:37,950
that yeah and that I think is like
completely amazing and then that should

6228
02:03:37,950 --> 02:03:37,960
completely amazing and then that should
 

6229
02:03:37,960 --> 02:03:39,310
completely amazing and then that should
allow people on Earth to think about

6230
02:03:39,310 --> 02:03:39,320
allow people on Earth to think about
 

6231
02:03:39,320 --> 02:03:42,589
allow people on Earth to think about
well probably we should try and get um

6232
02:03:42,589 --> 02:03:42,599
well probably we should try and get um
 

6233
02:03:42,599 --> 02:03:45,870
well probably we should try and get um
causal chains off Earth onto Mars onto

6234
02:03:45,870 --> 02:03:45,880
causal chains off Earth onto Mars onto
 

6235
02:03:45,880 --> 02:03:48,990

6237
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,149
the moon wherever whe it's human life or
Martian life that we create it doesn't

6238
02:03:51,149 --> 02:03:51,159
Martian life that we create it doesn't
 

6239
02:03:51,159 --> 02:03:55,149
Martian life that we create it doesn't
matter um but but I think um this

6240
02:03:55,149 --> 02:03:55,159
matter um but but I think um this
 

6241
02:03:55,159 --> 02:03:56,870

commentarial space tells us something

6242
02:03:56,870 --> 02:03:56,880
commentarial space tells us something
 

6243
02:03:56,880 --> 02:03:59,549
commentarial space tells us something
very important about the Universe um and

6244
02:03:59,549 --> 02:03:59,559
very important about the Universe um and
 

6245
02:03:59,559 --> 02:04:01,750
very important about the Universe um and
and that I realized in assembly theory

6246
02:04:01,750 --> 02:04:01,760
and that I realized in assembly theory
 

6247
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:04,549
and that I realized in assembly theory
that the universe is too big to contain

6248
02:04:04,549 --> 02:04:04,559
that the universe is too big to contain
 

6249
02:04:04,559 --> 02:04:07,830
that the universe is too big to contain
itself and and I think this is and now

6250
02:04:07,830 --> 02:04:07,840
itself and and I think this is and now
 

6251
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:09,350
itself and and I think this is and now
coming back and I want to I want to kind

6252
02:04:09,350 --> 02:04:09,360
coming back and I want to I want to kind
 

6253
02:04:09,360 --> 02:04:10,990
coming back and I want to I want to kind
of change your mind about time because

6254
02:04:10,990 --> 02:04:11,000
of change your mind about time because
 

6255
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,790
of change your mind about time because
I'm I'm guessing that you're a time is

6256
02:04:13,790 --> 02:04:13,800
I'm I'm guessing that you're a time is
 

6257
02:04:13,800 --> 02:04:16,589
I'm I'm guessing that you're a time is
just a coordinate yeah so I'm I'm going

6258
02:04:16,589 --> 02:04:16,599
just a coordinate yeah so I'm I'm going
 

6259
02:04:16,599 --> 02:04:18,830
just a coordinate yeah so I'm I'm going
to change guessing you're one of those

6260
02:04:18,830 --> 02:04:18,840
to change guessing you're one of those
 

6261
02:04:18,840 --> 02:04:20,549
to change guessing you're one of those
change your one of those I going change

6262
02:04:20,549 --> 02:04:20,559
change your one of those I going change
 

6263
02:04:20,559 --> 02:04:21,709
change your one of those I going change
your mind in real time or at least

6264
02:04:21,709 --> 02:04:21,719
your mind in real time or at least
 

6265
02:04:21,719 --> 02:04:24,510
your mind in real time or at least
attempt oh in real time there you go um

6266
02:04:24,510 --> 02:04:24,520
attempt oh in real time there you go um
 

6267
02:04:24,520 --> 02:04:25,870

I already got the tattoo so this is

6268
02:04:25,870 --> 02:04:25,880
I already got the tattoo so this is
 

6269
02:04:25,880 --> 02:04:27,109
I already got the tattoo so this is
going to be embarrassing if you change

6270
02:04:27,109 --> 02:04:27,119
going to be embarrassing if you change
 

6271
02:04:27,119 --> 02:04:28,669
going to be embarrassing if you change
my mind but you can just add you can

6272
02:04:28,669 --> 02:04:28,679
my mind but you can just add you can
 

6273
02:04:28,679 --> 02:04:32,430
my mind but you can just add you can
just add Arrow time on to it right true

6274
02:04:32,430 --> 02:04:32,440
just add Arrow time on to it right true
 

6275
02:04:32,440 --> 02:04:35,390
just add Arrow time on to it right true
or erase it a bit so um and the argument

6276
02:04:35,390 --> 02:04:35,400
or erase it a bit so um and the argument
 

6277
02:04:35,400 --> 02:04:36,950
or erase it a bit so um and the argument
that I think that is really most

6278
02:04:36,950 --> 02:04:36,960
that I think that is really most
 

6279
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:39,069
that I think that is really most
interesting is like people say the

6280
02:04:39,069 --> 02:04:39,079
interesting is like people say the
 

6281
02:04:39,079 --> 02:04:40,109
interesting is like people say the
initial

6282

conditions um specify the future of the
 

6285
02:04:42,920 --> 02:04:45,069
conditions um specify the future of the
universe okay fine let's say that's the

6286
02:04:45,069 --> 02:04:45,079
universe okay fine let's say that's the
 

6287
02:04:45,079 --> 02:04:47,390
universe okay fine let's say that's the
case for a moment now let's go back to

6288
02:04:47,390 --> 02:04:47,400
case for a moment now let's go back to
 

6289
02:04:47,400 --> 02:04:50,069
case for a moment now let's go back to

6353
02:06:08,520 --> 02:06:11,149

well we're using Infinity very Loosely

6359
02:06:15,159 --> 02:06:16,589
Precision I mean not Loosely but very
precisely so you think infinite

6360
02:06:16,589 --> 02:06:16,599

6371
02:06:27,119 --> 02:06:29,750
how many atoms there are in the golf
ball and let's say we can store numbers

6372
02:06:29,750 --> 02:06:29,760
ball and let's say we can store numbers
 

6373
02:06:29,760 --> 02:06:32,990
ball and let's say we can store numbers
down to Atomic dislocations MH so we can

6374
02:06:32,990 --> 02:06:33,000
down to Atomic dislocations MH so we can
 

6375
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:34,229
down to Atomic dislocations MH so we can
work out how many atoms there are in the

6376
02:06:34,229 --> 02:06:34,239
work out how many atoms there are in the
 

6377
02:06:34,239 --> 02:06:36,549
work out how many atoms there are in the
golf ball and we can store the

6378
02:06:36,549 --> 02:06:36,559
golf ball and we can store the
 

6379
02:06:36,559 --> 02:06:38,109
golf ball and we can store the
coordinates in that golf ball down to

6380
02:06:38,109 --> 02:06:38,119
coordinates in that golf ball down to
 

6381
02:06:38,119 --> 02:06:40,149
coordinates in that golf ball down to
that number but beyond that we can't MH

6382
02:06:40,149 --> 02:06:40,159
that number but beyond that we can't MH
 

6383
02:06:40,159 --> 02:06:41,629
that number but beyond that we can't MH
let's make the golf ball

6384
02:06:41,629 --> 02:06:41,639
let's make the golf ball
 

6385
02:06:41,639 --> 02:06:44,870
let's make the golf ball
smaller and and the this is where I

6386
02:06:44,870 --> 02:06:44,880
smaller and and the this is where I
 

6387
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:46,589
smaller and and the this is where I
think that we think that we get

6388
02:06:46,589 --> 02:06:46,599
think that we think that we get
 

6389
02:06:46,599 --> 02:06:48,350
think that we think that we get
Randomness in quantum mechanics and some

6390
02:06:48,350 --> 02:06:48,360
Randomness in quantum mechanics and some
 

6391
02:06:48,360 --> 02:06:49,669
Randomness in quantum mechanics and some
people so you can't get random quantum

6392
02:06:49,669 --> 02:06:49,679
people so you can't get random quantum
 

6393
02:06:49,679 --> 02:06:51,910
people so you can't get random quantum
mechanics deterministic but aha this is

6394
02:06:51,910 --> 02:06:51,920
mechanics deterministic but aha this is
 

6395
02:06:51,920 --> 02:06:53,990
mechanics deterministic but aha this is
where this is where we realize that

6396
02:06:53,990 --> 02:06:54,000
where this is where we realize that
 

6397
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:55,229
where this is where we realize that
classical mechanics and quantum

6398
02:06:55,229 --> 02:06:55,239
classical mechanics and quantum
 

6399
02:06:55,239 --> 02:06:56,830
classical mechanics and quantum
mechanics suffer from the same

6400
02:06:56,830 --> 02:06:56,840
mechanics suffer from the same
 

6401
02:06:56,840 --> 02:06:59,910
mechanics suffer from the same
uncertainty principle and that is the

6402
02:06:59,910 --> 02:06:59,920
uncertainty principle and that is the
 

6403
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:03,750
uncertainty principle and that is the
inability to specify the the initial

6404
02:07:03,750 --> 02:07:03,760
inability to specify the the initial
 

6405
02:07:03,760 --> 02:07:06,549
inability to specify the the initial
conditions to a precise enough degree to

6406
02:07:06,549 --> 02:07:06,559
conditions to a precise enough degree to
 

6407
02:07:06,559 --> 02:07:10,669
conditions to a precise enough degree to
give you determinism the universe is

6408
02:07:10,669 --> 02:07:10,679
give you determinism the universe is
 

6409
02:07:10,679 --> 02:07:13,830
give you determinism the universe is
intrinsically too big and that's why

6410
02:07:13,830 --> 02:07:13,840
intrinsically too big and that's why
 

6411
02:07:13,840 --> 02:07:16,229
intrinsically too big and that's why
time exists it's nondeterministic

6412
02:07:16,229 --> 02:07:16,239
time exists it's nondeterministic
 

6413
02:07:16,239 --> 02:07:18,830
time exists it's nondeterministic
looking back into the past you can look

6414
02:07:18,830 --> 02:07:18,840
looking back into the past you can look
 

6415
02:07:18,840 --> 02:07:22,270
looking back into the past you can look
at the you can use logical um arguments

6416
02:07:22,270 --> 02:07:22,280
at the you can use logical um arguments
 

6417
02:07:22,280 --> 02:07:23,669
at the you can use logical um arguments
because you can say was it true or false

6418
02:07:23,669 --> 02:07:23,679
because you can say was it true or false
 

6419
02:07:23,679 --> 02:07:26,790
because you can say was it true or false
you already know but this is the fact we

6420
02:07:26,790 --> 02:07:26,800
you already know but this is the fact we
 

6421
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:28,589
you already know but this is the fact we
are unable to predict the future with

02:07:28,589 --> 02:07:28,599
are unable to predict the future with

things okay so to you first of all

6430
02:07:39,870 --> 02:07:39,880
things okay so to you first of all
 

6431
02:07:39,880 --> 02:07:41,910
things okay so to you first of all
quantum mechanics you can just say

6432
02:07:41,910 --> 02:07:41,920
quantum mechanics you can just say
 

6433
02:07:41,920 --> 02:07:42,990
quantum mechanics you can just say
statistically what's going to happen

6434
02:07:42,990 --> 02:07:43,000
statistically what's going to happen
 

6435
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:44,350
statistically what's going to happen
when two golf balls hit each other

6436
02:07:44,350 --> 02:07:44,360
when two golf balls hit each other
 

6437
02:07:44,360 --> 02:07:46,950
when two golf balls hit each other
statistically but that but but sure I

6438
02:07:46,950 --> 02:07:46,960
statistically but that but but sure I
 

6439
02:07:46,960 --> 02:07:48,350
statistically but that but but sure I
can say statistic what's going to happen

6440
02:07:48,350 --> 02:07:48,360
can say statistic what's going to happen
 

6441
02:07:48,360 --> 02:07:50,629
can say statistic what's going to happen
but then what they do happen yeah and

6442
02:07:50,629 --> 02:07:50,639
but then what they do happen yeah and
 

6443
02:07:50,639 --> 02:07:53,669
but then what they do happen yeah and
and and you keep nesting it together you

6444
02:07:53,669 --> 02:07:53,679
and and you keep nesting it together you
 

6445
02:07:53,679 --> 02:07:55,629
and and you keep nesting it together you
can't I mean it goes almost back to look

6446
02:07:55,629 --> 02:07:55,639
can't I mean it goes almost back to look
 

6447
02:07:55,639 --> 02:07:57,709
can't I mean it goes almost back to look
at look at look at um let's think about

6448
02:07:57,709 --> 02:07:57,719
at look at look at um let's think about
 

6449
02:07:57,719 --> 02:08:00,069
at look at look at um let's think about
entropy in the universe so how do you

6450
02:08:00,069 --> 02:08:00,079
entropy in the universe so how do you
 

6451
02:08:00,079 --> 02:08:03,229
entropy in the universe so how do you
what how do we how do we understand um

6452
02:08:03,229 --> 02:08:03,239
what how do we how do we understand um
 

6453
02:08:03,239 --> 02:08:05,510
what how do we how do we understand um
entropy change well we could do the look

6454
02:08:05,510 --> 02:08:05,520
entropy change well we could do the look
 

6455
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:08,390
entropy change well we could do the look
at or process we can use the aeric

6456
02:08:08,390 --> 02:08:08,400
at or process we can use the aeric
 

6457
02:08:08,400 --> 02:08:13,910
at or process we can use the aeric
hypothesis um we can also have um um um

6458
02:08:13,910 --> 02:08:13,920
hypothesis um we can also have um um um
 

6459
02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:17,109
hypothesis um we can also have um um um
we can also have the uh counterfactuals

6460
02:08:17,109 --> 02:08:17,119
we can also have the uh counterfactuals
 

6461
02:08:17,119 --> 02:08:18,549
we can also have the uh counterfactuals
where we have all the different states

6462
02:08:18,549 --> 02:08:18,559
where we have all the different states
 

6463
02:08:18,559 --> 02:08:19,910
where we have all the different states
MH and we could even put that in the

6464
02:08:19,910 --> 02:08:19,920
MH and we could even put that in the
 

6465
02:08:19,920 --> 02:08:23,069
MH and we could even put that in the
Multiverse MH right but both those are

6466
02:08:23,069 --> 02:08:23,079
Multiverse MH right but both those are
 

6467
02:08:23,079 --> 02:08:26,510
Multiverse MH right but both those are
kind of they they're they're

6468
02:08:26,510 --> 02:08:26,520
kind of they they're they're
 

6469
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:29,669
kind of they they're they're
non-physical uh the Multiverse kind of

6470
02:08:29,669 --> 02:08:29,679
non-physical uh the Multiverse kind of
 

6471
02:08:29,679 --> 02:08:31,390
non-physical uh the Multiverse kind of
collapses back to the same problem about

6472
02:08:31,390 --> 02:08:31,400
collapses back to the same problem about
 

6473
02:08:31,400 --> 02:08:35,750
collapses back to the same problem about
the Precision so all the the what you if

6474
02:08:35,750 --> 02:08:35,760
the Precision so all the the what you if
 

6475
02:08:35,760 --> 02:08:38,229
the Precision so all the the what you if
you accept you don't have to have true

6476
02:08:38,229 --> 02:08:38,239
you accept you don't have to have true
 

6477
02:08:38,239 --> 02:08:41,270
you accept you don't have to have true
and false going forward into the future

6478
02:08:41,270 --> 02:08:41,280
and false going forward into the future
 

6479
02:08:41,280 --> 02:08:43,709
and false going forward into the future
um the real numbers are real they're

6480
02:08:43,709 --> 02:08:43,719
um the real numbers are real they're
 

6481
02:08:43,719 --> 02:08:46,950
um the real numbers are real they're
just they're just're they're observables

6482
02:08:46,950 --> 02:08:46,960
just they're just're they're observables
 

6483
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:49,790
just they're just're they're observables
we're trying to see exactly where time

6484
02:08:49,790 --> 02:08:49,800
we're trying to see exactly where time
 

6485
02:08:49,800 --> 02:08:52,109
we're trying to see exactly where time
being fundamental sneaks in and this

6486
02:08:52,109 --> 02:08:52,119
being fundamental sneaks in and this
 

6487
02:08:52,119 --> 02:08:53,669
being fundamental sneaks in and this
difference between that the the the golf

6488
02:08:53,669 --> 02:08:53,679
difference between that the the the golf
 

6489
02:08:53,679 --> 02:08:54,790
difference between that the the the golf
ball can't

02:08:54,790 --> 02:08:54,800
ball can't
 

6491
02:08:54,800 --> 02:08:58,030
ball can't
contain its own

precisely if how that leads to time

6496
02:09:03,870 --> 02:09:03,880
precisely if how that leads to time
 

6497
02:09:03,880 --> 02:09:05,830
precisely if how that leads to time
needing to be fundamental let me I have

6498
02:09:05,830 --> 02:09:05,840
needing to be fundamental let me I have
 

6499
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:08,350
needing to be fundamental let me I have
a what do you believe do you believe or

6500
02:09:08,350 --> 02:09:08,360
a what do you believe do you believe or
 

6501
02:09:08,360 --> 02:09:11,910
a what do you believe do you believe or
do you accept you have free

6502
02:09:11,910 --> 02:09:11,920
do you accept you have free
 

6503
02:09:11,920 --> 02:09:15,510
do you accept you have free
will yeah I think at this moment in time

6504
02:09:15,510 --> 02:09:15,520
will yeah I think at this moment in time
 

6505
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:18,149
will yeah I think at this moment in time
I believe that I have free will so then

6506
02:09:18,149 --> 02:09:18,159
I believe that I have free will so then
 

6507
02:09:18,159 --> 02:09:20,189
I believe that I have free will so then
you you are then you have to believe

6508
02:09:20,189 --> 02:09:20,199
you you are then you have to believe
 

6509
02:09:20,199 --> 02:09:22,790
you you are then you have to believe
that time is

6510
02:09:22,790 --> 02:09:22,800

 

6511
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:24,830

fundamental I understand that's the St

6512
02:09:24,830 --> 02:09:24,840
fundamental I understand that's the St
 

6513
02:09:24,840 --> 02:09:25,910
fundamental I understand that's the St
you've made well no that we can

6514
02:09:25,910 --> 02:09:25,920
you've made well no that we can
 

6515
02:09:25,920 --> 02:09:27,430
you've made well no that we can
logically follows because if you don't

6516
02:09:27,430 --> 02:09:27,440
logically follows because if you don't
 

6517
02:09:27,440 --> 02:09:29,790
logically follows because if you don't
have free will so like if you're in a if

6518
02:09:29,790 --> 02:09:29,800
have free will so like if you're in a if
 

6519
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:32,229
have free will so like if you're in a if
you're in a universe that has no time

6520
02:09:32,229 --> 02:09:32,239
you're in a universe that has no time
 

6521
02:09:32,239 --> 02:09:34,549
you're in a universe that has no time
the universe is deterministic if it's

6522
02:09:34,549 --> 02:09:34,559
the universe is deterministic if it's
 

6523
02:09:34,559 --> 02:09:36,990
the universe is deterministic if it's
deterministic then you have no free will

6524
02:09:36,990 --> 02:09:37,000
deterministic then you have no free will
 

6525
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:38,950
deterministic then you have no free will
I I think the space of how much we don't

6526
02:09:38,950 --> 02:09:38,960
I I think the space of how much we don't
 

6527
02:09:38,960 --> 02:09:43,149
I I think the space of how much we don't
know is so vast that saying the universe

6528
02:09:43,149 --> 02:09:43,159
know is so vast that saying the universe
 

6529
02:09:43,159 --> 02:09:44,870
know is so vast that saying the universe
is deterministic from that jumping

6530
02:09:44,870 --> 02:09:44,880
is deterministic from that jumping
 

6531
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:47,390
is deterministic from that jumping
there's no free will is just too

6532
02:09:47,390 --> 02:09:47,400
there's no free will is just too
 

6533
02:09:47,400 --> 02:09:49,069
there's no free will is just too
difficult of a leap no I logically

6534
02:09:49,069 --> 02:09:49,079
difficult of a leap no I logically
 

6535
02:09:49,079 --> 02:09:51,229
difficult of a leap no I logically
follows no no I I don't disagree it's

6536
02:09:51,229 --> 02:09:51,239
follows no no I I don't disagree it's
 

6537
02:09:51,239 --> 02:09:54,149
follows no no I I don't disagree it's
not I'm not saying any I mean it's deep

6538
02:09:54,149 --> 02:09:54,159
not I'm not saying any I mean it's deep
 

6539
02:09:54,159 --> 02:09:56,870
not I'm not saying any I mean it's deep
and it's important all I'm all I'm

6540
02:09:56,870 --> 02:09:56,880
and it's important all I'm all I'm
 

6541
02:09:56,880 --> 02:09:58,790
and it's important all I'm all I'm
saying and it's the difference to it's

6542
02:09:58,790 --> 02:09:58,800
saying and it's the difference to it's
 

6543
02:09:58,800 --> 02:09:59,870
saying and it's the difference to it's
actually different to what I've said

6544
02:09:59,870 --> 02:09:59,880
actually different to what I've said
 

6545
02:09:59,880 --> 02:10:03,109
actually different to what I've said
before is that if you don't require

6546
02:10:03,109 --> 02:10:03,119
before is that if you don't require
 

6547

platonistic
 

6549
02:10:04,679 --> 02:10:07,390
platonistic
mathematics and accepts that that

6550
02:10:07,390 --> 02:10:07,400
mathematics and accepts that that
 

6551
02:10:07,400 --> 02:10:10,189
mathematics and accepts that that
non-determinism is how the universe

6552
02:10:10,189 --> 02:10:10,199
non-determinism is how the universe
 

6553
02:10:10,199 --> 02:10:12,870
non-determinism is how the universe
looks and that gives us our creativity

6554
02:10:12,870 --> 02:10:12,880
looks and that gives us our creativity
 

6555
02:10:12,880 --> 02:10:14,350
looks and that gives us our creativity
and the where the universe is getting

6556
02:10:14,350 --> 02:10:14,360
and the where the universe is getting
 

6557
02:10:14,360 --> 02:10:16,549
and the where the universe is getting
novelty it's kind of really deeply

6559
02:10:16,559 --> 02:10:17,830

important in assembly Theory because

6560
02:10:17,830 --> 02:10:17,840
important in assembly Theory because
 

6561
02:10:17,840 --> 02:10:19,430
important in assembly Theory because
assembly starts to actually give you a

assembly starts to actually give you a
 

6563
02:10:19,440 --> 02:10:22,750
assembly starts to actually give you a
mechanism why you go from boring time

02:10:22,750 --> 02:10:22,760
mechanism why you go from boring time
 

6565
02:10:22,760 --> 02:10:24,470
mechanism why you go from boring time
which is basically initial conditions

02:10:28,629 --> 02:10:28,639
creative time and I hope we'll do
 

6571
02:10:28,639 --> 02:10:30,109

I've got an idea I would love to do an

6596
02:10:57,390 --> 02:10:57,400
I've got an idea I would love to do an
 

6597
02:10:57,400 --> 02:11:00,149
I've got an idea I would love to do an
experiment that that shows that the

experiment that that shows that the
 

6599
02:11:00,159 --> 02:11:02,629
experiment that that shows that the
Universe I mean universe is too too big

6600
02:11:02,629 --> 02:11:02,639
Universe I mean universe is too too big
 

6601
02:11:02,639 --> 02:11:05,629
Universe I mean universe is too too big
for itself going forward in time and and

6602
02:11:05,629 --> 02:11:05,639
for itself going forward in time and and
 

6603
02:11:05,639 --> 02:11:08,390
for itself going forward in time and and
I really you know this is why I I really

6604
02:11:08,390 --> 02:11:08,400
I really you know this is why I I really
 

6605
02:11:08,400 --> 02:11:09,950
I really you know this is why I I really
hate the idea of the boltzman brain the

6606
02:11:09,950 --> 02:11:09,960
hate the idea of the boltzman brain the
 

6607
02:11:09,960 --> 02:11:12,589
hate the idea of the boltzman brain the
boltzman brain makes me super kind of

6608
02:11:12,589 --> 02:11:12,599
boltzman brain makes me super kind of
 

6609
02:11:12,599 --> 02:11:14,310
boltzman brain makes me super kind of
like you know everyone's having a free

6610
02:11:14,310 --> 02:11:14,320
like you know everyone's having a free
 

6611
02:11:14,320 --> 02:11:16,310
like you know everyone's having a free
lunch it's like saying it's like let's

02:11:16,310 --> 02:11:16,320
lunch it's like saying it's like let's
 

6613
02:11:16,320 --> 02:11:17,750

break all the laws of physics so a

boltman brain is this idea that in a

6616
02:11:20,310 --> 02:11:20,320
boltman brain is this idea that in a
 

6617
02:11:20,320 --> 02:11:21,790
boltman brain is this idea that in a
long enough Universe a brain will just

6618
02:11:21,790 --> 02:11:21,800
long enough Universe a brain will just
 

6619
02:11:21,800 --> 02:11:24,069
long enough Universe a brain will just
emerge in the universe as conscious

6620
02:11:24,069 --> 02:11:24,079
emerge in the universe as conscious
 

6621
02:11:24,079 --> 02:11:25,870
emerge in the universe as conscious
without and that neglects the causal

chain of evolution required to produce
 

6625
02:11:28,360 --> 02:11:29,950
chain of evolution required to produce
that brain and this is where the

6626
02:11:29,950 --> 02:11:29,960
that brain and this is where the
 

6627
02:11:29,960 --> 02:11:32,270
that brain and this is where the
computational argument really falls down

6628
02:11:32,270 --> 02:11:32,280
computational argument really falls down
 

6629
02:11:32,280 --> 02:11:33,589
computational argument really falls down
because the computation is can say I can

6630
02:11:33,589 --> 02:11:33,599
because the computation is can say I can
 

6631
02:11:33,599 --> 02:11:34,910
because the computation is can say I can
calculate probability of a bolts and

6632
02:11:34,910 --> 02:11:34,920
calculate probability of a bolts and
 

6633
02:11:34,920 --> 02:11:37,149
calculate probability of a bolts and
brain and I can and they'll give you

6634
02:11:37,149 --> 02:11:37,159
brain and I can and they'll give you
 

6635
02:11:37,159 --> 02:11:38,069
brain and I can and they'll give you
probability but I can calculate

probability but I can calculate
 

6637
02:11:38,079 --> 02:11:40,430
probability but I can calculate
probability of a bolts and brain zero

6638

probability of a bolts and brain zero
 

6639
02:11:40,440 --> 02:11:42,069

just because the the the space of

possibilities is so large yeah it's like
 

6643
02:11:44,360 --> 02:11:45,830

when we start falling ourselves with

when we start falling ourselves with
 

6645
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:48,390
when we start falling ourselves with
numbers that we can't actually measure

numbers that we can't actually measure
 

6647
02:11:48,400 --> 02:11:51,189
numbers that we can't actually measure
and we can't ever conceive of I think it

6648
02:11:51,189 --> 02:11:51,199
and we can't ever conceive of I think it
 

6649
02:11:51,199 --> 02:11:55,350
and we can't ever conceive of I think it
I think it it it it doesn't give us a

6650
02:11:55,350 --> 02:11:55,360
I think it it it it doesn't give us a
 

6651
02:11:55,360 --> 02:11:57,910
I think it it it it doesn't give us a
good explanation and I've become I want

6652
02:11:57,910 --> 02:11:57,920
good explanation and I've become I want
 

6653
02:11:57,920 --> 02:12:00,270
good explanation and I've become I want
to explain why life is in the universe I

6654
02:12:00,270 --> 02:12:00,280
to explain why life is in the universe I
 

6655
02:12:00,280 --> 02:12:03,870
to explain why life is in the universe I
think life is actually novelty minor not

6656
02:12:03,870 --> 02:12:03,880
think life is actually novelty minor not
 

6657
02:12:03,880 --> 02:12:06,830
think life is actually novelty minor not
I mean life basically Minds novelty

6658
02:12:06,830 --> 02:12:06,840
I mean life basically Minds novelty
 

6659
02:12:06,840 --> 02:12:08,510
I mean life basically Minds novelty
almost from the future and makes it

6660
02:12:08,510 --> 02:12:08,520
almost from the future and makes it
 

6661
02:12:08,520 --> 02:12:10,350
almost from the future and makes it
actualizes in the

6662
02:12:10,350 --> 02:12:10,360
actualizes in the
 

6663
02:12:10,360 --> 02:12:15,030
actualizes in the
present okay life is a novelty

6664
02:12:15,030 --> 02:12:15,040
present okay life is a novelty
 

6665
02:12:15,040 --> 02:12:18,069
present okay life is a novelty
minor uh from the future that is

6666
02:12:18,069 --> 02:12:18,079
minor uh from the future that is
 

6667
02:12:18,079 --> 02:12:22,870
minor uh from the future that is
actualized in the present

6668
02:12:22,870 --> 02:12:22,880

 

6669
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:27,990

y I think so novelty minor first of all

6670
02:12:27,990 --> 02:12:28,000
y I think so novelty minor first of all
 

6671
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,589
y I think so novelty minor first of all
novelty what's the origin of novelty

6672
02:12:30,589 --> 02:12:30,599
novelty what's the origin of novelty
 

6673
02:12:30,599 --> 02:12:32,549
novelty what's the origin of novelty
when you go from boring time to creative

6674
02:12:32,549 --> 02:12:32,559
when you go from boring time to creative
 

6675
02:12:32,559 --> 02:12:36,109
when you go from boring time to creative
time where's that is it as simple as as

6676
02:12:36,109 --> 02:12:36,119
time where's that is it as simple as as
 

6677
02:12:36,119 --> 02:12:39,149
time where's that is it as simple as as
Randomness like you're referring to um I

6678
02:12:39,149 --> 02:12:39,159
Randomness like you're referring to um I
 

6679
02:12:39,159 --> 02:12:41,030
Randomness like you're referring to um I
I am really struggling with Randomness

6680
02:12:41,030 --> 02:12:41,040
I am really struggling with Randomness
 

6681
02:12:41,040 --> 02:12:43,709
I am really struggling with Randomness
because I had a really good argument

6682
02:12:43,709 --> 02:12:43,719
because I had a really good argument
 

6683
02:12:43,719 --> 02:12:46,069
because I had a really good argument
with Yasha about Randomness Nisa said

6684
02:12:46,069 --> 02:12:46,079
with Yasha about Randomness Nisa said
 

6685
02:12:46,079 --> 02:12:47,430
with Yasha about Randomness Nisa said
Randomness doesn't give you free will

6686
02:12:47,430 --> 02:12:47,440
Randomness doesn't give you free will
 

6687
02:12:47,440 --> 02:12:48,549
Randomness doesn't give you free will
that's insane because You' just be

6688
02:12:48,549 --> 02:12:48,559
that's insane because You' just be
 

6689
02:12:48,559 --> 02:12:51,189
that's insane because You' just be
random but I think and I think he's

6690
02:12:51,189 --> 02:12:51,199
random but I think and I think he's
 

6691
02:12:51,199 --> 02:12:53,189
random but I think and I think he's
right at that level yeah but I don't

6692
02:12:53,189 --> 02:12:53,199
right at that level yeah but I don't
 

6693
02:12:53,199 --> 02:12:55,549
right at that level yeah but I don't
think we I don't think he is right on

6694
02:12:55,549 --> 02:12:55,559
think we I don't think he is right on
 

6695
02:12:55,559 --> 02:12:57,189
think we I don't think he is right on
another level and it's not about

6696
02:12:57,189 --> 02:12:57,199
another level and it's not about
 

6697
02:12:57,199 --> 02:13:00,470
another level and it's not about
Randomness it's about it's about

6698
02:13:00,470 --> 02:13:00,480
Randomness it's about it's about
 

6699
02:13:00,480 --> 02:13:03,390
Randomness it's about it's about
constrained I'm going to sound like

6700
02:13:03,390 --> 02:13:03,400
constrained I'm going to sound like
 

6701
02:13:03,400 --> 02:13:05,149
constrained I'm going to sound like
constrained opport I'm making this up as

6702
02:13:05,149 --> 02:13:05,159
constrained opport I'm making this up as
 

6703
02:13:05,159 --> 02:13:07,870
constrained opport I'm making this up as
I go along so making this up constrained

6704
02:13:07,870 --> 02:13:07,880
I go along so making this up constrained
 

6705
02:13:07,880 --> 02:13:10,830
I go along so making this up constrained
opportunity so what I mean is like so

6706
02:13:10,830 --> 02:13:10,840
opportunity so what I mean is like so
 

6707
02:13:10,840 --> 02:13:15,109
opportunity so what I mean is like so
you have to have so that the novelty

6708
02:13:15,109 --> 02:13:15,119
you have to have so that the novelty
 

6709
02:13:15,119 --> 02:13:16,950
you have to have so that the novelty
what is novelty you know this is why I

6710
02:13:16,950 --> 02:13:16,960
what is novelty you know this is why I
 

6711
02:13:16,960 --> 02:13:18,510
what is novelty you know this is why I
think is the funny thing

6712
02:13:18,510 --> 02:13:18,520
think is the funny thing
 

6713
02:13:18,520 --> 02:13:20,350
think is the funny thing
you ever want to discuss AI why I think

6714
02:13:20,350 --> 02:13:20,360
you ever want to discuss AI why I think
 

6715
02:13:20,360 --> 02:13:22,910
you ever want to discuss AI why I think
everyone's kind of gone AI mad is that

6716
02:13:22,910 --> 02:13:22,920
everyone's kind of gone AI mad is that
 

6717
02:13:22,920 --> 02:13:24,189
everyone's kind of gone AI mad is that
they're

6718
02:13:24,189 --> 02:13:24,199
they're
 

6719
02:13:24,199 --> 02:13:26,750
they're
misunderstanding um novelty but let's

6720
02:13:26,750 --> 02:13:26,760
misunderstanding um novelty but let's
 

6721
02:13:26,760 --> 02:13:28,229
misunderstanding um novelty but let's
think about novelty ask what is novelty

6722
02:13:28,229 --> 02:13:28,239
think about novelty ask what is novelty
 

6723
02:13:28,239 --> 02:13:31,589
think about novelty ask what is novelty
so I think novelty is a genuinely new

6724
02:13:31,589 --> 02:13:31,599
so I think novelty is a genuinely new
 

6725
02:13:31,599 --> 02:13:33,990
so I think novelty is a genuinely new
configuration that is not predicted by

6726
02:13:33,990 --> 02:13:34,000
configuration that is not predicted by
 

6727
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:37,990
configuration that is not predicted by
the P past right and that you discover

6728
02:13:37,990 --> 02:13:38,000
the P past right and that you discover
 

6729
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,990
the P past right and that you discover
in the present right and um that is

6730
02:13:40,990 --> 02:13:41,000
in the present right and um that is
 

6731
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,350
in the present right and um that is
truly different right now everyone says

6732
02:13:43,350 --> 02:13:43,360
truly different right now everyone says
 

6733
02:13:43,360 --> 02:13:44,990
truly different right now everyone says
that some people say that novelty

6734
02:13:44,990 --> 02:13:45,000
that some people say that novelty
 

6735
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,950
that some people say that novelty
doesn't exist it's always with precedent

6736
02:13:47,950 --> 02:13:47,960
doesn't exist it's always with precedent
 

6737
02:13:47,960 --> 02:13:50,109
doesn't exist it's always with precedent
I want to do experiments that show that

6738
02:13:50,109 --> 02:13:50,119
I want to do experiments that show that
 

6739
02:13:50,119 --> 02:13:52,510
I want to do experiments that show that
that is not the case and it goes back to

6740
02:13:52,510 --> 02:13:52,520
that is not the case and it goes back to
 

6741
02:13:52,520 --> 02:13:54,510
that is not the case and it goes back to
a question you asked me a a few moments

6742
02:13:54,510 --> 02:13:54,520
a question you asked me a a few moments
 

6743
02:13:54,520 --> 02:13:58,030
a question you asked me a a few moments
ago which is where is the factory yeah

6744
02:13:58,030 --> 02:13:58,040
ago which is where is the factory yeah
 

6745
02:13:58,040 --> 02:13:59,990
ago which is where is the factory yeah
right because I think the same mechanism

6746
02:13:59,990 --> 02:14:00,000
right because I think the same mechanism
 

6747
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:03,109
right because I think the same mechanism
that gives us a factory gives us novelty

6748
02:14:03,109 --> 02:14:03,119
that gives us a factory gives us novelty
 

6749
02:14:03,119 --> 02:14:05,470
that gives us a factory gives us novelty
and I think that that is that is why I'm

6750
02:14:05,470 --> 02:14:05,480
and I think that that is that is why I'm
 

6751
02:14:05,480 --> 02:14:08,270
and I think that that is that is why I'm
so deeply hung up on time I mean of

6752
02:14:08,270 --> 02:14:08,280
so deeply hung up on time I mean of
 

6753
02:14:08,280 --> 02:14:11,430
so deeply hung up on time I mean of
course I'm wrong but how wrong and I and

6754
02:14:11,430 --> 02:14:11,440
course I'm wrong but how wrong and I and
 

6755
02:14:11,440 --> 02:14:14,830
course I'm wrong but how wrong and I and
I think that that life opens up that

6756
02:14:14,830 --> 02:14:14,840
I think that that life opens up that
 

6757
02:14:14,840 --> 02:14:19,030
I think that that life opens up that

of the Multiverse David Deutsch style
 

6767
02:14:28,920 --> 02:14:30,950
of the Multiverse David Deutsch style
which I love by the way but I don't

6768
02:14:30,950 --> 02:14:30,960
which I love by the way but I don't
 

6769
02:14:30,960 --> 02:14:32,069
which I love by the way but I don't
think is

6770
02:14:32,069 --> 02:14:32,079
think is
 

6771
02:14:32,079 --> 02:14:35,310
think is
correct um but it's it's it's kind it's

6772
02:14:35,310 --> 02:14:35,320
correct um but it's it's it's kind it's
 

6773
02:14:35,320 --> 02:14:36,149
correct um but it's it's it's kind it's
really

6774
02:14:36,149 --> 02:14:36,159
really
 

6775
02:14:36,159 --> 02:14:38,750
really
beautiful Multiverse the the David

6776
02:14:38,750 --> 02:14:38,760
beautiful Multiverse the the David

beautiful Multiverse the the David
Deutsch's conception of the Multiverse

6778
02:14:40,790 --> 02:14:40,800
Deutsch's conception of the Multiverse
 

6779
02:14:40,800 --> 02:14:44,830
Deutsch's conception of the Multiverse
is kind of like given um but I think the

6780
02:14:44,830 --> 02:14:44,840
is kind of like given um but I think the
 

6781
02:14:44,840 --> 02:14:47,149
is kind of like given um but I think the
the problem with wave particle duality

6782
02:14:47,149 --> 02:14:47,159
the problem with wave particle duality
 

6783
02:14:47,159 --> 02:14:48,629
the problem with wave particle duality
and quantum mechanics

6784
02:14:48,629 --> 02:14:48,639
and quantum mechanics
 

6785
02:14:48,639 --> 02:14:52,310
and quantum mechanics
is not um about the Multiverse it's

6786
02:14:52,310 --> 02:14:52,320
is not um about the Multiverse it's
 

6787
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:54,390
is not um about the Multiverse it's
about understanding how determined the

6788
02:14:54,390 --> 02:14:54,400
about understanding how determined the
 

6789
02:14:54,400 --> 02:14:56,310
about understanding how determined the
past is well I don't think just think

6790
02:14:56,310 --> 02:14:56,320
past is well I don't think just think
 

6791
02:14:56,320 --> 02:14:58,669
past is well I don't think just think
that actually this is a a discussion I

6792
02:14:58,669 --> 02:14:58,679
that actually this is a a discussion I
 

6793
02:14:58,679 --> 02:15:00,669
that actually this is a a discussion I
was having with Sarah about that right

6794
02:15:00,669 --> 02:15:00,679
was having with Sarah about that right
 

6795
02:15:00,679 --> 02:15:02,430
was having with Sarah about that right
where she was like oh I think we we'd

6796
02:15:02,430 --> 02:15:02,440
where she was like oh I think we we'd
 

6797
02:15:02,440 --> 02:15:05,189
where she was like oh I think we we'd
been debating this for a long time now

6798
02:15:05,189 --> 02:15:05,199
been debating this for a long time now
 

6799
02:15:05,199 --> 02:15:09,149
been debating this for a long time now
um about how we how do we reconcile

6800
02:15:09,149 --> 02:15:09,159
um about how we how do we reconcile
 

6801
02:15:09,159 --> 02:15:11,750
um about how we how do we reconcile
novelty determinism

6802
02:15:11,750 --> 02:15:11,760
novelty determinism
 

6803
02:15:11,760 --> 02:15:14,430
novelty determinism
indeterminism so okay just to clarify

6804
02:15:14,430 --> 02:15:14,440
indeterminism so okay just to clarify
 

6805
02:15:14,440 --> 02:15:16,069
indeterminism so okay just to clarify
you both you and Sarah think the

6806
02:15:16,069 --> 02:15:16,079
you both you and Sarah think the
 

6807
02:15:16,079 --> 02:15:19,189
you both you and Sarah think the
universe is not deterministic

6808
02:15:19,189 --> 02:15:19,199
universe is not deterministic
 

6809
02:15:19,199 --> 02:15:21,189
universe is not deterministic
uh I'm I won't speak for Sarah but I

6810
02:15:21,189 --> 02:15:21,199
uh I'm I won't speak for Sarah but I
 

6811
02:15:21,199 --> 02:15:25,270
uh I'm I won't speak for Sarah but I
roughly I I think that the

6812
02:15:25,270 --> 02:15:25,280

 

6813
02:15:25,280 --> 02:15:27,589

Universe I think the universe is

6814
02:15:27,589 --> 02:15:27,599
Universe I think the universe is
 

6815
02:15:27,599 --> 02:15:30,229
Universe I think the universe is
deterministic looking back in the P back

6816
02:15:30,229 --> 02:15:30,239
deterministic looking back in the P back
 

6817
02:15:30,239 --> 02:15:32,950
deterministic looking back in the P back
in the past right but undetermined going

6818
02:15:32,950 --> 02:15:32,960
in the past right but undetermined going
 

6819
02:15:32,960 --> 02:15:34,510
in the past right but undetermined going
F going forward in the future so I'm

6820
02:15:34,510 --> 02:15:34,520
F going forward in the future so I'm
 

6821
02:15:34,520 --> 02:15:36,229
F going forward in the future so I'm
kind of having my cake and eat it eating

6822
02:15:36,229 --> 02:15:36,239
kind of having my cake and eat it eating
 

6823
02:15:36,239 --> 02:15:37,910
kind of having my cake and eat it eating
it here this is because I fundamentally

6824
02:15:37,910 --> 02:15:37,920
it here this is because I fundamentally
 

6825
02:15:37,920 --> 02:15:40,069
it here this is because I fundamentally
don't understand Randomness right as

6826
02:15:40,069 --> 02:15:40,079
don't understand Randomness right as
 

6827
02:15:40,079 --> 02:15:42,390
don't understand Randomness right as
Yasha told me or other people told me

6828
02:15:42,390 --> 02:15:42,400
Yasha told me or other people told me
 

6829
02:15:42,400 --> 02:15:44,870
Yasha told me or other people told me
but if I adopt a new view now which

6830
02:15:44,870 --> 02:15:44,880
but if I adopt a new view now which
 

6831
02:15:44,880 --> 02:15:47,350
but if I adopt a new view now which
um the new view is the universe is just

6832
02:15:47,350 --> 02:15:47,360
um the new view is the universe is just
 

6833
02:15:47,360 --> 02:15:49,189
um the new view is the universe is just
net deterministic but I'd like to refine

6834
02:15:49,189 --> 02:15:49,199
net deterministic but I'd like to refine
 

6835
02:15:49,199 --> 02:15:51,510
net deterministic but I'd like to refine
that and say the universe appears

6836
02:15:51,510 --> 02:15:51,520
that and say the universe appears
 

6837
02:15:51,520 --> 02:15:54,510
that and say the universe appears
deterministic going back in the past but

6838
02:15:54,510 --> 02:15:54,520
deterministic going back in the past but
 

6839
02:15:54,520 --> 02:15:56,270
deterministic going back in the past but
it's but it's undetermined going forward

6840
02:15:56,270 --> 02:15:56,280
it's but it's undetermined going forward
 

6841
02:15:56,280 --> 02:15:59,149
it's but it's undetermined going forward
in the future so how can we have a

6842
02:15:59,149 --> 02:15:59,159
in the future so how can we have a
 

6843
02:15:59,159 --> 02:16:00,870
in the future so how can we have a
determinist a universe that has

6844
02:16:00,870 --> 02:16:00,880
determinist a universe that has
 

6845
02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:03,149
determinist a universe that has
deterministically looking rules that's

6846
02:16:03,149 --> 02:16:03,159
deterministically looking rules that's
 

6847
02:16:03,159 --> 02:16:05,189
deterministically looking rules that's
non-determined going into the future

6848
02:16:05,189 --> 02:16:05,199
non-determined going into the future
 

6849
02:16:05,199 --> 02:16:06,910
non-determined going into the future
it's this breakdown in Precision in the

6850
02:16:06,910 --> 02:16:06,920
it's this breakdown in Precision in the
 

6851
02:16:06,920 --> 02:16:09,149
it's this breakdown in Precision in the
initial conditions and we have to just

6852
02:16:09,149 --> 02:16:09,159
initial conditions and we have to just
 

6853
02:16:09,159 --> 02:16:11,109
initial conditions and we have to just
stop using initial conditions and start

6854
02:16:11,109 --> 02:16:11,119
stop using initial conditions and start
 

6855
02:16:11,119 --> 02:16:13,189
stop using initial conditions and start
looking at

6856
02:16:13,189 --> 02:16:13,199
looking at
 

6857
02:16:13,199 --> 02:16:17,750
looking at
trajectories and how how um the comori

6858
02:16:17,750 --> 02:16:17,760
trajectories and how how um the comori
 

6859
02:16:17,760 --> 02:16:20,510
trajectories and how how um the comori
space behaves in expanding Universe in

6860
02:16:20,510 --> 02:16:20,520
space behaves in expanding Universe in
 

6861
02:16:20,520 --> 02:16:23,470
space behaves in expanding Universe in
time and space and assembly Theory helps

6862
02:16:23,470 --> 02:16:23,480
time and space and assembly Theory helps
 

6863
02:16:23,480 --> 02:16:26,149
time and space and assembly Theory helps
us quantify the transition to biology

6864
02:16:26,149 --> 02:16:26,159
us quantify the transition to biology
 

6865
02:16:26,159 --> 02:16:28,310
us quantify the transition to biology
and biology appears to be novelty mining

6866
02:16:28,310 --> 02:16:28,320
and biology appears to be novelty mining
 

6867
02:16:28,320 --> 02:16:31,030
and biology appears to be novelty mining
because it's making crazy stuff you know

6868
02:16:31,030 --> 02:16:31,040
because it's making crazy stuff you know
 

6869
02:16:31,040 --> 02:16:34,150
because it's making crazy stuff you know
um that that we are unique to earth

6870
02:16:34,150 --> 02:16:34,160
um that that we are unique to earth
 

6871
02:16:34,160 --> 02:16:36,110
um that that we are unique to earth
right there are objects on Earth that

6872
02:16:36,110 --> 02:16:36,120
right there are objects on Earth that
 

6873
02:16:36,120 --> 02:16:37,990
right there are objects on Earth that
are unique to Earth they will not be

6874
02:16:37,990 --> 02:16:38,000
are unique to Earth they will not be
 

6875
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:39,270
are unique to Earth they will not be
found anywhere else because you can do

6876
02:16:39,270 --> 02:16:39,280
found anywhere else because you can do
 

6877
02:16:39,280 --> 02:16:42,349
found anywhere else because you can do
the commentarial math uh what was that

6878
02:16:42,349 --> 02:16:42,359
the commentarial math uh what was that
 

6879
02:16:42,359 --> 02:16:45,910
the commentarial math uh what was that
statement you made about life is novelty

6880
02:16:45,910 --> 02:16:45,920
statement you made about life is novelty
 

6881
02:16:45,920 --> 02:16:48,389
statement you made about life is novelty
mining from the future yeah yeah what's

6882
02:16:48,389 --> 02:16:48,399
mining from the future yeah yeah what's
 

6883
02:16:48,399 --> 02:16:50,389
mining from the future yeah yeah what's
the what's what's the little element of

6884
02:16:50,389 --> 02:16:50,399
the what's what's the little element of
 

6885
02:16:50,399 --> 02:16:52,070
the what's what's the little element of
time that you're introducing so what I'm

6886
02:16:52,070 --> 02:16:52,080
time that you're introducing so what I'm
 

6887
02:16:52,080 --> 02:16:53,589
time that you're introducing so what I'm
kind of meaning is cuz the future is

6888
02:16:53,589 --> 02:16:53,599
kind of meaning is cuz the future is
 

6889
02:16:53,599 --> 02:16:55,270
kind of meaning is cuz the future is
bigger than the present in a

6890
02:16:55,270 --> 02:16:55,280
bigger than the present in a
 

6891
02:16:55,280 --> 02:16:57,070
bigger than the present in a
deterministic universe how do you go

6892
02:16:57,070 --> 02:16:57,080
deterministic universe how do you go
 

6893
02:16:57,080 --> 02:16:59,589
deterministic universe how do you go
from the how do how do the how do the

6894
02:16:59,589 --> 02:16:59,599
from the how do how do the how do the
 

6895
02:16:59,599 --> 02:17:01,429
from the how do how do the how do the
states go from one to another I mean

6896
02:17:01,429 --> 02:17:01,439
states go from one to another I mean
 

6897
02:17:01,439 --> 02:17:04,190
states go from one to another I mean
there's a mismatch right yeah so so that

6898
02:17:04,190 --> 02:17:04,200
there's a mismatch right yeah so so that
 

6899
02:17:04,200 --> 02:17:05,629
there's a mismatch right yeah so so that
must mean that you have a little bit of

6900
02:17:05,629 --> 02:17:05,639
must mean that you have a little bit of
 

6901
02:17:05,639 --> 02:17:07,429
must mean that you have a little bit of
indeterminism whether that's Randomness

6902
02:17:07,429 --> 02:17:07,439
indeterminism whether that's Randomness
 

6903
02:17:07,439 --> 02:17:09,830
indeterminism whether that's Randomness
or something else I don't understand I

6904
02:17:09,830 --> 02:17:09,840
or something else I don't understand I
 

6905
02:17:09,840 --> 02:17:11,429
or something else I don't understand I
want to do experiments to formulate a

6906
02:17:11,429 --> 02:17:11,439
want to do experiments to formulate a
 

6907
02:17:11,439 --> 02:17:13,429
want to do experiments to formulate a
theory to refine that as we go forward

6908
02:17:13,429 --> 02:17:13,439
theory to refine that as we go forward
 

6909
02:17:13,439 --> 02:17:15,990
theory to refine that as we go forward
that might help us explain that and um

6910
02:17:15,990 --> 02:17:16,000
that might help us explain that and um
 

6911
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,309
that might help us explain that and um
and I think that's why I'm so

6912
02:17:18,309 --> 02:17:18,319
and I think that's why I'm so
 

6913
02:17:18,319 --> 02:17:22,070
and I think that's why I'm so
um determined to try and crack the the

6914
02:17:22,070 --> 02:17:22,080
um determined to try and crack the the
 

6915
02:17:22,080 --> 02:17:24,549
um determined to try and crack the the
non-life tolife transition looking at at

6916
02:17:24,549 --> 02:17:24,559
non-life tolife transition looking at at
 

6917
02:17:24,559 --> 02:17:25,990
non-life tolife transition looking at at
networks and molecules and that might

6918
02:17:25,990 --> 02:17:26,000
networks and molecules and that might
 

6919
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:29,070
networks and molecules and that might
help us think about it the mechanism but

6920
02:17:29,070 --> 02:17:29,080
help us think about it the mechanism but
 

6921
02:17:29,080 --> 02:17:30,429
help us think about it the mechanism but
certainly the future is bigger than the

6922
02:17:30,429 --> 02:17:30,439
certainly the future is bigger than the
 

6923
02:17:30,439 --> 02:17:32,589
certainly the future is bigger than the
past in in my conception of the universe

6924
02:17:32,589 --> 02:17:32,599
past in in my conception of the universe
 

6925
02:17:32,599 --> 02:17:35,629
past in in my conception of the universe
and some conception of the universe and

6926
02:17:35,629 --> 02:17:35,639
and some conception of the universe and
 

6927
02:17:35,639 --> 02:17:36,950
and some conception of the universe and
by the way that's not obvious right

6928
02:17:36,950 --> 02:17:36,960
by the way that's not obvious right
 

6929
02:17:36,960 --> 02:17:39,150
by the way that's not obvious right
that's where was just kind of the future

6930
02:17:39,150 --> 02:17:39,160
that's where was just kind of the future
 

6931
02:17:39,160 --> 02:17:41,509
that's where was just kind of the future
being bigger than the

6932
02:17:41,509 --> 02:17:41,519
being bigger than the
 

6933
02:17:41,519 --> 02:17:44,270
being bigger than the
past well that that's one statement and

6934
02:17:44,270 --> 02:17:44,280
past well that that's one statement and
 

6935
02:17:44,280 --> 02:17:45,830
past well that that's one statement and
the statement that the universe is not

6936
02:17:45,830 --> 02:17:45,840
the statement that the universe is not
 

6937
02:17:45,840 --> 02:17:47,230
the statement that the universe is not
big enough to contain the future is

6938
02:17:47,230 --> 02:17:47,240
big enough to contain the future is
 

6939
02:17:47,240 --> 02:17:50,190
big enough to contain the future is
another statement yeah yeah yeah yeah I

6940
02:17:50,190 --> 02:17:50,200
another statement yeah yeah yeah yeah I
 

6941
02:17:50,200 --> 02:17:52,190
another statement yeah yeah yeah yeah I
that one is a big one I that one's a

6942
02:17:52,190 --> 02:17:52,200
that one is a big one I that one's a
 

6943
02:17:52,200 --> 02:17:54,349
that one is a big one I that one's a
really big one I think so I think it but

6944
02:17:54,349 --> 02:17:54,359
really big one I think so I think it but
 

6945
02:17:54,359 --> 02:17:55,750
really big one I think so I think it but
I think it's

6946
02:17:55,750 --> 02:17:55,760
I think it's
 

6947
02:17:55,760 --> 02:17:57,990
I think it's
entirely because look we have the second

6948
02:17:57,990 --> 02:17:58,000
entirely because look we have the second
 

6949
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:01,190
entirely because look we have the second
law and right now I mean I'm we don't

6950
02:18:01,190 --> 02:18:01,200
law and right now I mean I'm we don't
 

6951
02:18:01,200 --> 02:18:02,950
law and right now I mean I'm we don't
need the second law if the future's

6952
02:18:02,950 --> 02:18:02,960
need the second law if the future's
 

6953
02:18:02,960 --> 02:18:04,589
need the second law if the future's
bigger than the past it follows

6954
02:18:04,589 --> 02:18:04,599
bigger than the past it follows
 

6955
02:18:04,599 --> 02:18:06,549
bigger than the past it follows
naturally right so why are we

6956
02:18:06,549 --> 02:18:06,559
naturally right so why are we
 

6957
02:18:06,559 --> 02:18:09,950
naturally right so why are we
retrofitting all these these sticking

6958
02:18:09,950 --> 02:18:09,960
retrofitting all these these sticking
 

6959
02:18:09,960 --> 02:18:12,349
retrofitting all these these sticking
plasters onto our reality to hold on to

6960
02:18:12,349 --> 02:18:12,359
plasters onto our reality to hold on to
 

6961
02:18:12,359 --> 02:18:14,270
plasters onto our reality to hold on to
a Timeless Universe yeah but that's

6962
02:18:14,270 --> 02:18:14,280
a Timeless Universe yeah but that's
 

6963
02:18:14,280 --> 02:18:16,669
a Timeless Universe yeah but that's
because it's kind of difficult to

6964
02:18:16,669 --> 02:18:16,679
because it's kind of difficult to
 

6965
02:18:16,679 --> 02:18:18,750
because it's kind of difficult to
imagine the universe

6966
02:18:18,750 --> 02:18:18,760
imagine the universe
 

6967
02:18:18,760 --> 02:18:21,990
imagine the universe
that's that can't contain the future but

6968
02:18:21,990 --> 02:18:22,000
that's that can't contain the future but
 

6969
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:23,870
that's that can't contain the future but
it's not really exciting it's very

6970
02:18:23,870 --> 02:18:23,880
it's not really exciting it's very
 

6971
02:18:23,880 --> 02:18:25,589
it's not really exciting it's very
exciting but

6972
02:18:25,589 --> 02:18:25,599
exciting but
 

6973
02:18:25,599 --> 02:18:28,830
exciting but
it's it's hard uh I mean we're we're

6974
02:18:28,830 --> 02:18:28,840
it's it's hard uh I mean we're we're
 

6975
02:18:28,840 --> 02:18:31,950
it's it's hard uh I mean we're we're
humans on Earth and we have a very kind

6976
02:18:31,950 --> 02:18:31,960
humans on Earth and we have a very kind
 

6977
02:18:31,960 --> 02:18:34,750
humans on Earth and we have a very kind
of four dimensional conception of the

6978
02:18:34,750 --> 02:18:34,760
of four dimensional conception of the
 

6979
02:18:34,760 --> 02:18:38,549
of four dimensional conception of the
world of 3D plus time it's just hard to

6980
02:18:38,549 --> 02:18:38,559
world of 3D plus time it's just hard to
 

6981
02:18:38,559 --> 02:18:41,270
world of 3D plus time it's just hard to
Inuit it a world where what does that

6982
02:18:41,270 --> 02:18:41,280
Inuit it a world where what does that
 

6983
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:45,230
Inuit it a world where what does that
even mean a universe that can't contain

6984
02:18:45,230 --> 02:18:45,240
even mean a universe that can't contain
 

6985
02:18:45,240 --> 02:18:46,509
even mean a universe that can't contain
the

6986
02:18:46,509 --> 02:18:46,519
the
 

6987
02:18:46,519 --> 02:18:49,190
the
future yeah it's kind of it's kind of

6988
02:18:49,190 --> 02:18:49,200
future yeah it's kind of it's kind of
 

6989
02:18:49,200 --> 02:18:52,110
future yeah it's kind of it's kind of
crazy but obvious weird I mean I suppose

6990
02:18:52,110 --> 02:18:52,120
crazy but obvious weird I mean I suppose
 

6991
02:18:52,120 --> 02:18:54,389
crazy but obvious weird I mean I suppose
it sounds obvious yeah if it's true but

6992
02:18:54,389 --> 02:18:54,399
it sounds obvious yeah if it's true but
 

6993
02:18:54,399 --> 02:18:56,629
it sounds obvious yeah if it's true but
the nice thing is you can so what I I

6994
02:18:56,629 --> 02:18:56,639
the nice thing is you can so what I I
 

6995
02:18:56,639 --> 02:18:58,750
the nice thing is you can so what I I
mean so the reason why assembly Theory

6996
02:18:58,750 --> 02:18:58,760
mean so the reason why assembly Theory
 

6997
02:18:58,760 --> 02:19:02,230
mean so the reason why assembly Theory
turned me onto that was that you let's

02:19:02,230 --> 02:19:02,240
turned me onto that was that you let's
 

6999
02:19:02,240 --> 02:19:03,790
turned me onto that was that you let's
let's just start in the present and look

let's just start in the present and look
 

7001
02:19:03,800 --> 02:19:05,270
let's just start in the present and look
at all the complex molecules and go

02:19:05,280 --> 02:19:08,389
at all the complex molecules and go
backwards in time and understand how

right it long enough but what that I

7128
02:21:45,070 --> 02:21:45,080
right it long enough but what that I
 

7129
02:21:45,080 --> 02:21:46,429
right it long enough but what that I
guess that means is we have to

7130
02:21:46,429 --> 02:21:46,439
guess that means is we have to

02:21:46,439 --> 02:21:48,110
guess that means is we have to
instantiate we have to have a number of

the future by iteration right and you're
like oh that's great that's great you

7144
02:22:00,830 --> 02:22:00,840
like oh that's great that's great you
 

7145
02:22:00,840 --> 02:22:02,790
like oh that's great that's great you
didn't predict it some rules you can

7146
02:22:02,790 --> 02:22:02,800
didn't predict it some rules you can
 

7147
02:22:02,800 --> 02:22:04,270
didn't predict it some rules you can
predict the what's going to happen other

7148
02:22:04,270 --> 02:22:04,280
predict the what's going to happen other
 

7149
02:22:04,280 --> 02:22:07,030
predict the what's going to happen other
rules you can't so for me if anything CA

7150
02:22:07,030 --> 02:22:07,040
rules you can't so for me if anything CA
 

7151
02:22:07,040 --> 02:22:09,110
rules you can't so for me if anything CA
are evidence that the the universe is

7152
02:22:09,110 --> 02:22:09,120
are evidence that the the universe is
 

7153
02:22:09,120 --> 02:22:10,950
are evidence that the the universe is
too big to contain itself because

7154
02:22:10,950 --> 02:22:10,960
too big to contain itself because
 

7155
02:22:10,960 --> 02:22:12,349
too big to contain itself because
otherwise you'd know what the rules are

7156
02:22:12,349 --> 02:22:12,359
otherwise you'd know what the rules are
 

7157
02:22:12,359 --> 02:22:13,990
otherwise you'd know what the rules are
going to do forever

7158
02:22:13,990 --> 02:22:14,000
going to do forever
 

7159
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,590
going to do forever
more right I guess you were saying that

7160
02:22:16,590 --> 02:22:16,600
more right I guess you were saying that
 

7161
02:22:16,600 --> 02:22:19,309
more right I guess you were saying that
the physicist just saying that all you

7162
02:22:19,309 --> 02:22:19,319
the physicist just saying that all you
 

7163
02:22:19,319 --> 02:22:20,630
the physicist just saying that all you
need is the initial conditions and the

7164
02:22:20,630 --> 02:22:20,640
need is the initial conditions and the
 

7165
02:22:20,640 --> 02:22:22,230
need is the initial conditions and the
rules of

7166
02:22:22,230 --> 02:22:22,240
rules of
 

7167
02:22:22,240 --> 02:22:24,870
rules of
physics uh is somehow missing the bigger

7168
02:22:24,870 --> 02:22:24,880
physics uh is somehow missing the bigger
 

7169
02:22:24,880 --> 02:22:28,070
physics uh is somehow missing the bigger
picture AB yeah and you know if you look

7170
02:22:28,070 --> 02:22:28,080
picture AB yeah and you know if you look
 

7171
02:22:28,080 --> 02:22:29,670
picture AB yeah and you know if you look
at CA all you need is the initial

7172
02:22:29,670 --> 02:22:29,680
at CA all you need is the initial
 

7173
02:22:29,680 --> 02:22:32,510
at CA all you need is the initial
condition and the and the rules and then

7174
02:22:32,510 --> 02:22:32,520
condition and the and the rules and then
 

7175
02:22:32,520 --> 02:22:35,349
condition and the and the rules and then
run the thing you

7176
02:22:35,349 --> 02:22:35,359
run the thing you
 

7177
02:22:35,359 --> 02:22:38,230
run the thing you
need three things you need the initial

7178
02:22:38,230 --> 02:22:38,240
need three things you need the initial
 

7179
02:22:38,240 --> 02:22:40,790
need three things you need the initial
conditions you need the rules and you

7180
02:22:40,790 --> 02:22:40,800
conditions you need the rules and you
 

7181
02:22:40,800 --> 02:22:43,110
conditions you need the rules and you
need time iteration to mine it out

7182
02:22:43,110 --> 02:22:43,120
need time iteration to mine it out
 

7183
02:22:43,120 --> 02:22:44,469
need time iteration to mine it out
without the coordinate you can't get it

7184
02:22:44,469 --> 02:22:44,479
without the coordinate you can't get it
 

7185
02:22:44,479 --> 02:22:47,429
without the coordinate you can't get it
out sure and that's that that to use fun

7186
02:22:47,429 --> 02:22:47,439
out sure and that's that that to use fun
 

7187
02:22:47,439 --> 02:22:48,710
out sure and that's that that to use fun
and you can't predict it from initial

7188
02:22:48,710 --> 02:22:48,720
and you can't predict it from initial
 

7189
02:22:48,720 --> 02:22:51,670
and you can't predict it from initial
conditions if you could then it' be fine

7190
02:22:51,670 --> 02:22:51,680
conditions if you could then it' be fine
 

7191
02:22:51,680 --> 02:22:56,190
conditions if you could then it' be fine
and that time is res Foundation of uh

7192
02:22:56,190 --> 02:22:56,200
and that time is res Foundation of uh
 

7193
02:22:56,200 --> 02:22:58,349
and that time is res Foundation of uh
it's the history the memory of each the

7194
02:22:58,349 --> 02:22:58,359
it's the history the memory of each the
 

7195
02:22:58,359 --> 02:23:02,110
it's the history the memory of each the
things that created it has to have that

7196
02:23:02,110 --> 02:23:02,120
things that created it has to have that
 

7197
02:23:02,120 --> 02:23:04,309
things that created it has to have that
memory of all the things that led up to

7198
02:23:04,309 --> 02:23:04,319
memory of all the things that led up to
 

7199
02:23:04,319 --> 02:23:06,270
memory of all the things that led up to
it I think it's a yeah you have to have

7200
02:23:06,270 --> 02:23:06,280
it I think it's a yeah you have to have
 

7201
02:23:06,280 --> 02:23:09,790
it I think it's a yeah you have to have
the resource yeah cuz time is a

7202
02:23:09,790 --> 02:23:09,800
the resource yeah cuz time is a
 

7203
02:23:09,800 --> 02:23:13,870
the resource yeah cuz time is a
fundamental resource and and um yeah I'm

7204
02:23:13,870 --> 02:23:13,880
fundamental resource and and um yeah I'm
 

7205
02:23:13,880 --> 02:23:18,990
fundamental resource and and um yeah I'm
becoming I think I had a major

7206
02:23:18,990 --> 02:23:19,000
becoming I think I had a major
 

7207
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,630
becoming I think I had a major
um uh Epiphany about Randomness but I

7208
02:23:21,630 --> 02:23:21,640
um uh Epiphany about Randomness but I
 

7209
02:23:21,640 --> 02:23:22,910
um uh Epiphany about Randomness but I
keep doing that every two days and then

7210
02:23:22,910 --> 02:23:22,920
keep doing that every two days and then
 

7211
02:23:22,920 --> 02:23:24,469
keep doing that every two days and then
it goes away again it's random you're

7212
02:23:24,469 --> 02:23:24,479
it goes away again it's random you're
 

7213
02:23:24,479 --> 02:23:25,710
it goes away again it's random you're
you're a Time

7214
02:23:25,710 --> 02:23:25,720
you're a Time
 

7215
02:23:25,720 --> 02:23:28,110
you're a Time
fundamentalist you should be as well if

7216
02:23:28,110 --> 02:23:28,120
fundamentalist you should be as well if
 

7217
02:23:28,120 --> 02:23:30,630
fundamentalist you should be as well if
you believe in Free Will yeah the only

7218
02:23:30,630 --> 02:23:30,640
you believe in Free Will yeah the only
 

7219
02:23:30,640 --> 02:23:32,510
you believe in Free Will yeah the only
conclusion is there is time is

7220
02:23:32,510 --> 02:23:32,520
conclusion is there is time is
 

7221
02:23:32,520 --> 02:23:34,150
conclusion is there is time is
fundamental otherwise you cannot have

7222
02:23:34,150 --> 02:23:34,160
fundamental otherwise you cannot have
 

7223
02:23:34,160 --> 02:23:36,870
fundamental otherwise you cannot have
free will it logically

7224
02:23:36,870 --> 02:23:36,880
free will it logically
 

7225
02:23:36,880 --> 02:23:38,469
free will it logically
follows

7226
02:23:38,469 --> 02:23:38,479
follows
 

7227
02:23:38,479 --> 02:23:41,269
follows
well my my the foundation of my belief

7228
02:23:41,269 --> 02:23:41,279
well my my the foundation of my belief
 

7229
02:23:41,279 --> 02:23:43,990
well my my the foundation of my belief
and Free Will is just

7230
02:23:43,990 --> 02:23:44,000
and Free Will is just
 

7231
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:48,030
and Free Will is just
uh is is uh observation driven

7232
02:23:48,030 --> 02:23:48,040
uh is is uh observation driven
 

7233
02:23:48,040 --> 02:23:49,670
uh is is uh observation driven
but that's I think if you use

7234
02:23:49,670 --> 02:23:49,680
but that's I think if you use
 

7235
02:23:49,680 --> 02:23:51,590
but that's I think if you use
logic it's

7236
02:23:51,590 --> 02:23:51,600
logic it's
 

7237
02:23:51,600 --> 02:23:54,230
logic it's
like logically seems like the universe

7238
02:23:54,230 --> 02:23:54,240
like logically seems like the universe
 

7239
02:23:54,240 --> 02:23:54,910
like logically seems like the universe
is

7240
02:23:54,910 --> 02:23:54,920
is
 

7241
02:23:54,920 --> 02:23:56,910
is
deterministic looking backwards in time

7242
02:23:56,910 --> 02:23:56,920
deterministic looking backwards in time
 

7243
02:23:56,920 --> 02:23:59,910
deterministic looking backwards in time
and that's correct universe is and then

7244
02:23:59,910 --> 02:23:59,920
and that's correct universe is and then
 

7245
02:23:59,920 --> 02:24:02,030
and that's correct universe is and then
everything else is is a is is a kind of

7246
02:24:02,030 --> 02:24:02,040
everything else is is a is is a kind of
 

7247
02:24:02,040 --> 02:24:03,870
everything else is is a is is a kind of
leap it requires a

7248
02:24:03,870 --> 02:24:03,880
leap it requires a
 

7249
02:24:03,880 --> 02:24:08,710
leap it requires a
leap I mean I I I think that

7250
02:24:08,710 --> 02:24:08,720
leap I mean I I I think that
 

7251
02:24:08,720 --> 02:24:11,590
leap I mean I I I think that
um it's kind of this is what I think

7252
02:24:11,590 --> 02:24:11,600
um it's kind of this is what I think
 

7253
02:24:11,600 --> 02:24:13,070
um it's kind of this is what I think
machine learning was going to provide a

7254
02:24:13,070 --> 02:24:13,080
machine learning was going to provide a
 

7255
02:24:13,080 --> 02:24:16,389
machine learning was going to provide a
big a chunk of that right CU um it to

7256
02:24:16,389 --> 02:24:16,399
big a chunk of that right CU um it to
 

7257
02:24:16,399 --> 02:24:18,190
big a chunk of that right CU um it to
help us explain this so the way I'd say

7258
02:24:18,190 --> 02:24:18,200
help us explain this so the way I'd say
 

7259
02:24:18,200 --> 02:24:21,790
help us explain this so the way I'd say
if you take that's interesting why well

7260
02:24:21,790 --> 02:24:21,800
if you take that's interesting why well
 

7261
02:24:21,800 --> 02:24:24,710
if you take that's interesting why well
let's let's let's just um my favorite

7262
02:24:24,710 --> 02:24:24,720
let's let's let's just um my favorite
 

7263
02:24:24,720 --> 02:24:27,110
let's let's let's just um my favorite
one one is because I'm I'm the AI

7264
02:24:27,110 --> 02:24:27,120
one one is because I'm I'm the AI
 

7265
02:24:27,120 --> 02:24:29,150
one one is because I'm I'm the AI
doomers are driving me mad and AI the

7266
02:24:29,150 --> 02:24:29,160
doomers are driving me mad and AI the
 

7267
02:24:29,160 --> 02:24:30,950
doomers are driving me mad and AI the
fact that we don't have any intelligence

7268
02:24:30,950 --> 02:24:30,960
fact that we don't have any intelligence
 

7269
02:24:30,960 --> 02:24:33,469
fact that we don't have any intelligence
yet I call AI autonomous informatics

7270
02:24:33,469 --> 02:24:33,479
yet I call AI autonomous informatics
 

7271
02:24:33,479 --> 02:24:36,349
yet I call AI autonomous informatics
just to make people grumpy yeah um and

7272
02:24:36,349 --> 02:24:36,359
just to make people grumpy yeah um and
 

7273
02:24:36,359 --> 02:24:38,710
just to make people grumpy yeah um and
you're saying we're quite far away from

7274
02:24:38,710 --> 02:24:38,720
you're saying we're quite far away from
 

7275
02:24:38,720 --> 02:24:42,469
you're saying we're quite far away from
AGI I think that we have no conception

7276
02:24:42,469 --> 02:24:42,479
AGI I think that we have no conception
 

7277
02:24:42,479 --> 02:24:44,870
AGI I think that we have no conception
of intelligence and I think that we

7278
02:24:44,870 --> 02:24:44,880
of intelligence and I think that we
 

7279
02:24:44,880 --> 02:24:46,349
of intelligence and I think that we
don't understand how the human brain

7280
02:24:46,349 --> 02:24:46,359
don't understand how the human brain
 

7281
02:24:46,359 --> 02:24:48,389
don't understand how the human brain
does what it does does I think that we

7282
02:24:48,389 --> 02:24:48,399
does what it does does I think that we
 

7283
02:24:48,399 --> 02:24:50,550
does what it does does I think that we
are neurosciences making great advances

7284
02:24:50,550 --> 02:24:50,560
are neurosciences making great advances
 

7285
02:24:50,560 --> 02:24:52,429
are neurosciences making great advances
but I think that we have no idea about

7286
02:24:52,429 --> 02:24:52,439
but I think that we have no idea about
 

7287
02:24:52,439 --> 02:24:57,150
but I think that we have no idea about
AGI so I am a technological I guess

7288
02:24:57,150 --> 02:24:57,160
AGI so I am a technological I guess
 

7289
02:24:57,160 --> 02:24:58,670
AGI so I am a technological I guess
Optimist I believe we should do

7290
02:24:58,670 --> 02:24:58,680
Optimist I believe we should do
 

7291
02:24:58,680 --> 02:25:01,030
Optimist I believe we should do
everything the whole regulation of AI is

7292
02:25:01,030 --> 02:25:01,040
everything the whole regulation of AI is
 

7293
02:25:01,040 --> 02:25:02,710
everything the whole regulation of AI is
nonsensical I mean why would you

7294
02:25:02,710 --> 02:25:02,720
nonsensical I mean why would you
 

7295
02:25:02,720 --> 02:25:04,550
nonsensical I mean why would you
regulate EXL other than the fact that

7296
02:25:04,550 --> 02:25:04,560
regulate EXL other than the fact that
 

7297
02:25:04,560 --> 02:25:06,870
regulate EXL other than the fact that
clippy should come back and I love XL 97

7298
02:25:06,870 --> 02:25:06,880
clippy should come back and I love XL 97
 

7299
02:25:06,880 --> 02:25:08,910
clippy should come back and I love XL 97
because we can play um you know we can

7300
02:25:08,910 --> 02:25:08,920
because we can play um you know we can
 

7301
02:25:08,920 --> 02:25:11,670
because we can play um you know we can
do the flight flight simulator uh I'm

7302
02:25:11,670 --> 02:25:11,680
do the flight flight simulator uh I'm
 

7303
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:13,510
do the flight flight simulator uh I'm
sorry in Excel yeah have you not played

7304
02:25:13,510 --> 02:25:13,520
sorry in Excel yeah have you not played
 

7305
02:25:13,520 --> 02:25:16,389
sorry in Excel yeah have you not played
the flight simulator in in Excel may7

7306
02:25:16,389 --> 02:25:16,399
the flight simulator in in Excel may7
 

7307
02:25:16,399 --> 02:25:17,870
the flight simulator in in Excel may7
yeah

7308
02:25:17,870 --> 02:25:17,880
yeah
 

7309
02:25:17,880 --> 02:25:19,950
yeah
what does that look like it's like

7310
02:25:19,950 --> 02:25:19,960
what does that look like it's like
 

7311
02:25:19,960 --> 02:25:22,910
what does that look like it's like
wireframe very very basic but basically

7312
02:25:22,910 --> 02:25:22,920
wireframe very very basic but basically
 

7313
02:25:22,920 --> 02:25:27,070
wireframe very very basic but basically
I think it's x0 y0 shift and it opens up

7314
02:25:27,070 --> 02:25:27,080
I think it's x0 y0 shift and it opens up
 

7315
02:25:27,080 --> 02:25:29,190
I think it's x0 y0 shift and it opens up
and you can play the fight simulator oh

7316
02:25:29,190 --> 02:25:29,200
and you can play the fight simulator oh
 

7317
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:32,429
and you can play the fight simulator oh
wow wait wait is it using Excel Excel

7318
02:25:32,429 --> 02:25:32,439
wow wait wait is it using Excel Excel
 

7319
02:25:32,439 --> 02:25:35,269
wow wait wait is it using Excel Excel
Excel 97 okay I resurrected it the other

7320
02:25:35,269 --> 02:25:35,279
Excel 97 okay I resurrected it the other
 

7321
02:25:35,279 --> 02:25:36,710
Excel 97 okay I resurrected it the other
day and saw clippy again for the first

7322
02:25:36,710 --> 02:25:36,720
day and saw clippy again for the first
 

7323
02:25:36,720 --> 02:25:38,469
day and saw clippy again for the first
time in a long time well clippy is

7324
02:25:38,469 --> 02:25:38,479
time in a long time well clippy is
 

7325
02:25:38,479 --> 02:25:42,150
time in a long time well clippy is
definitely coming back but you're saying

7326
02:25:42,150 --> 02:25:42,160
definitely coming back but you're saying
 

7327
02:25:42,160 --> 02:25:44,510
definitely coming back but you're saying
we don't have a a great understanding of

7328
02:25:44,510 --> 02:25:44,520
we don't have a a great understanding of
 

7329
02:25:44,520 --> 02:25:45,870
we don't have a a great understanding of
what is intelligence what is the

7330
02:25:45,870 --> 02:25:45,880
what is intelligence what is the
 

7331
02:25:45,880 --> 02:25:48,870
what is intelligence what is the
intelligence I am very frustrated

7332
02:25:48,870 --> 02:25:48,880
intelligence I am very frustrated
 

7333
02:25:48,880 --> 02:25:50,710
intelligence I am very frustrated
underpinning the human mind I'm very

7334
02:25:50,710 --> 02:25:50,720
underpinning the human mind I'm very
 

7335
02:25:50,720 --> 02:25:52,910
underpinning the human mind I'm very
frustrated by the way that um we're AI

7336
02:25:52,910 --> 02:25:52,920
frustrated by the way that um we're AI
 

7337
02:25:52,920 --> 02:25:55,510
frustrated by the way that um we're AI
dooming right now and people are

7338
02:25:55,510 --> 02:25:55,520
dooming right now and people are
 

7339
02:25:55,520 --> 02:25:59,269
dooming right now and people are
bestowing some kind of magic now um

7340
02:25:59,269 --> 02:25:59,279
bestowing some kind of magic now um
 

7341
02:25:59,279 --> 02:26:00,950
bestowing some kind of magic now um
let's go back a bit so you said about

7342
02:26:00,950 --> 02:26:00,960
let's go back a bit so you said about
 

7343
02:26:00,960 --> 02:26:03,190
let's go back a bit so you said about
AGI are we far away from AGI yes I do

7344
02:26:03,190 --> 02:26:03,200
AGI are we far away from AGI yes I do
 

7345
02:26:03,200 --> 02:26:04,710
AGI are we far away from AGI yes I do
not think we're going to get to AGI

7346
02:26:04,710 --> 02:26:04,720
not think we're going to get to AGI
 

7347
02:26:04,720 --> 02:26:07,389
not think we're going to get to AGI
anytime soon I've seen no evidence of it

7348
02:26:07,389 --> 02:26:07,399
anytime soon I've seen no evidence of it
 

7349
02:26:07,399 --> 02:26:10,150
anytime soon I've seen no evidence of it
and the AI Doom scenario is nonsensical

7350
02:26:10,150 --> 02:26:10,160
and the AI Doom scenario is nonsensical
 

7351
02:26:10,160 --> 02:26:12,349
and the AI Doom scenario is nonsensical
in the extreme yeah um and the reason

7352
02:26:12,349 --> 02:26:12,359
in the extreme yeah um and the reason
 

7353
02:26:12,359 --> 02:26:14,429
in the extreme yeah um and the reason
why I think it's nonsensical but it's

7354
02:26:14,429 --> 02:26:14,439
why I think it's nonsensical but it's
 

7355
02:26:14,439 --> 02:26:15,790
why I think it's nonsensical but it's
not non

7356
02:26:15,790 --> 02:26:15,800
not non
 

7357
02:26:15,800 --> 02:26:18,429
not non
so and don't think there isn't things we

7358
02:26:18,429 --> 02:26:18,439
so and don't think there isn't things we
 

7359
02:26:18,439 --> 02:26:20,110
so and don't think there isn't things we
should do and be very worried about

7360
02:26:20,110 --> 02:26:20,120
should do and be very worried about
 

7361
02:26:20,120 --> 02:26:21,510
should do and be very worried about
right I mean there are things we need to

7362
02:26:21,510 --> 02:26:21,520
right I mean there are things we need to
 

7363
02:26:21,520 --> 02:26:23,630
right I mean there are things we need to
worry about right now what AI are doing

7364
02:26:23,630 --> 02:26:23,640
worry about right now what AI are doing
 

7365
02:26:23,640 --> 02:26:26,389
worry about right now what AI are doing
whether it's fake data fake users right

7366
02:26:26,389 --> 02:26:26,399
whether it's fake data fake users right
 

7367
02:26:26,399 --> 02:26:29,150
whether it's fake data fake users right
I want authentic people or authentic uh

7368
02:26:29,150 --> 02:26:29,160
I want authentic people or authentic uh
 

7369
02:26:29,160 --> 02:26:31,070
I want authentic people or authentic uh
um data I don't want everything to be

7370
02:26:31,070 --> 02:26:31,080
um data I don't want everything to be
 

7371
02:26:31,080 --> 02:26:32,550
um data I don't want everything to be
faked and I think it's a really big

7372
02:26:32,550 --> 02:26:32,560
faked and I think it's a really big
 

7373
02:26:32,560 --> 02:26:34,190
faked and I think it's a really big
problem and I'm absolutely want to go on

7374
02:26:34,190 --> 02:26:34,200
problem and I'm absolutely want to go on
 

7375
02:26:34,200 --> 02:26:35,750
problem and I'm absolutely want to go on
the record to say I really worry about

7376
02:26:35,750 --> 02:26:35,760
the record to say I really worry about
 

7377
02:26:35,760 --> 02:26:38,030
the record to say I really worry about
that what I'm not worried about is that

7378
02:26:38,030 --> 02:26:38,040
that what I'm not worried about is that
 

7379
02:26:38,040 --> 02:26:40,150
that what I'm not worried about is that
some fictitious entity is going to turn

7380
02:26:40,150 --> 02:26:40,160
some fictitious entity is going to turn
 

7381
02:26:40,160 --> 02:26:43,510
some fictitious entity is going to turn

nuclear bombs I don't

7384
02:26:45,790 --> 02:26:45,800
nuclear bombs I don't
 

7385
02:26:45,800 --> 02:26:48,269
nuclear bombs I don't
know maybe I don't know anything you

7386
02:26:48,269 --> 02:26:48,279
know maybe I don't know anything you
 

7387
02:26:48,279 --> 02:26:51,590
know maybe I don't know anything you
can't think of why is this is a and I'll

7388
02:26:51,590 --> 02:26:51,600
can't think of why is this is a and I'll
 

7389
02:26:51,600 --> 02:26:53,309
can't think of why is this is a and I'll
I'll take a very simple series of

02:26:53,309 --> 02:26:53,319
I'll take a very simple series of

02:26:53,319 --> 02:26:54,269
I'll take a very simple series of
logical

7392
02:26:54,269 --> 02:26:54,279
logical
 

7393
02:26:54,279 --> 02:26:59,750
logical

7394
02:26:59,750 --> 02:26:59,760

doomers are have not had the correct and
 

7397
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:05,429
doomers are have not had the correct and
this is had not had the correct they do

7398
02:27:05,429 --> 02:27:05,439
this is had not had the correct they do

02:27:09,190 --> 02:27:09,200
epistemology they do not understand what
 

7403
02:27:09,200 --> 02:27:11,510

02:27:13,070 --> 02:27:13,080
what knowledge is they're not going to
 

7407
02:27:13,080 --> 02:27:14,710
what knowledge is they're not going to

things falsely so let me give you a very

7410
02:27:17,389 --> 02:27:17,399
things falsely so let me give you a very
 

7411
02:27:17,399 --> 02:27:18,830
things falsely so let me give you a very
simple argument people talk about the

7412
02:27:18,830 --> 02:27:18,840
simple argument people talk about the
 

7413
02:27:18,840 --> 02:27:23,150
simple argument people talk about the
probability P Doom AI um I can we can

7414
02:27:23,150 --> 02:27:23,160
probability P Doom AI um I can we can
 

7415
02:27:23,160 --> 02:27:25,349
probability P Doom AI um I can we can
work out the probability of a asteroid

7416
02:27:25,349 --> 02:27:25,359
work out the probability of a asteroid
 

7417
02:27:25,359 --> 02:27:26,670
work out the probability of a asteroid
hitting the planet why because it's

7418
02:27:26,670 --> 02:27:26,680
hitting the planet why because it's
 

7419
02:27:26,680 --> 02:27:28,790
hitting the planet why because it's
happened before we know the mechanism we

7420
02:27:28,790 --> 02:27:28,800
happened before we know the mechanism we
 

7421
02:27:28,800 --> 02:27:30,670
happened before we know the mechanism we
know that there's a gravity well or that

7422
02:27:30,670 --> 02:27:30,680
know that there's a gravity well or that
 

7423
02:27:30,680 --> 02:27:32,269
know that there's a gravity well or that
you know space time is bent and stuff

7424
02:27:32,269 --> 02:27:32,279
you know space time is bent and stuff
 

7425
02:27:32,279 --> 02:27:35,030
you know space time is bent and stuff
Falls in we don't know the probability

7426
02:27:35,030 --> 02:27:35,040
Falls in we don't know the probability
 

7427
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:37,230
Falls in we don't know the probability
of AGI because we have no mechanism so

7428
02:27:37,230 --> 02:27:37,240
of AGI because we have no mechanism so
 

7429
02:27:37,240 --> 02:27:39,110
of AGI because we have no mechanism so
let me give you the another one which is

7430
02:27:39,110 --> 02:27:39,120
let me give you the another one which is
 

7431
02:27:39,120 --> 02:27:41,710
let me give you the another one which is
like I'm really worried about AG what's

7432
02:27:41,710 --> 02:27:41,720
like I'm really worried about AG what's
 

7433
02:27:41,720 --> 02:27:44,550
like I'm really worried about AG what's
ag ag is anti-gravity one day we could

7434
02:27:44,550 --> 02:27:44,560
ag ag is anti-gravity one day we could
 

7435
02:27:44,560 --> 02:27:47,030
ag ag is anti-gravity one day we could
wake up and anti-gravity you know it's

7436
02:27:47,030 --> 02:27:47,040
wake up and anti-gravity you know it's
 

7437
02:27:47,040 --> 02:27:48,550
wake up and anti-gravity you know it's
discovered we're all going to die the

7438
02:27:48,550 --> 02:27:48,560
discovered we're all going to die the
 

7439
02:27:48,560 --> 02:27:50,110
discovered we're all going to die the
atmosphere is going to float away we're

7440
02:27:50,110 --> 02:27:50,120
atmosphere is going to float away we're
 

7441
02:27:50,120 --> 02:27:52,469
atmosphere is going to float away we're
going to float away we're all doomed

7442
02:27:52,469 --> 02:27:52,479
going to float away we're all doomed
 

7443
02:27:52,479 --> 02:27:54,910
going to float away we're all doomed
what is the probability of AG we don't

7444
02:27:54,910 --> 02:27:54,920
what is the probability of AG we don't
 

7445
02:27:54,920 --> 02:27:56,790
what is the probability of AG we don't
know because there's no NE mechanism for

7446
02:27:56,790 --> 02:27:56,800
know because there's no NE mechanism for
 

7447
02:27:56,800 --> 02:28:02,070
know because there's no NE mechanism for
AG do we worry about it no and I don't

7448
02:28:02,070 --> 02:28:02,080
AG do we worry about it no and I don't

02:28:02,080 --> 02:28:05,910
AG do we worry about it no and I don't
understand the current um reason for

nonsense I think they're not doing it

7456
02:28:13,070 --> 02:28:13,080
nonsense I think they're not doing it
 

7457
02:28:13,080 --> 02:28:15,990
nonsense I think they're not doing it
maliciously I think we're observing the

7458
02:28:15,990 --> 02:28:16,000
maliciously I think we're observing the
 

7459
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:17,950
maliciously I think we're observing the
emergence of new religions how religions

7460
02:28:17,950 --> 02:28:17,960
emergence of new religions how religions
 

7461
02:28:17,960 --> 02:28:19,469
emergence of new religions how religions
come because religions are about kind of

02:28:20,910 --> 02:28:20,920
some control so you got The Optimist

saying AI is going to cure us all and AI

7466
02:28:23,550 --> 02:28:23,560
saying AI is going to cure us all and AI
 

7467
02:28:23,560 --> 02:28:24,710
saying AI is going to cure us all and AI
is going to kill us all what's the

7468
02:28:24,710 --> 02:28:24,720
is going to kill us all what's the
 

7469
02:28:24,720 --> 02:28:27,070
is going to kill us all what's the
reality well we don't have ai we have

7470
02:28:27,070 --> 02:28:27,080
reality well we don't have ai we have
 

7471
02:28:27,080 --> 02:28:29,550
reality well we don't have ai we have
really powerful machine learning tools

7472
02:28:29,550 --> 02:28:29,560
really powerful machine learning tools
 

7473
02:28:29,560 --> 02:28:31,070
really powerful machine learning tools
and they will allow us to do interesting

7474
02:28:31,070 --> 02:28:31,080
and they will allow us to do interesting
 

7475
02:28:31,080 --> 02:28:32,910
and they will allow us to do interesting
things and we need to be careful about

7476
02:28:32,910 --> 02:28:32,920
things and we need to be careful about
 

7477
02:28:32,920 --> 02:28:35,630
things and we need to be careful about
how we use those tools in terms of

7478
02:28:35,630 --> 02:28:35,640
how we use those tools in terms of
 

7479
02:28:35,640 --> 02:28:37,469
how we use those tools in terms of
manipulating human beings and faking

manipulating human beings and faking
 

7481

stuff right right uh well let me uh let

7482
02:28:40,830 --> 02:28:40,840
stuff right right uh well let me uh let
 

7483
02:28:40,840 --> 02:28:42,429
stuff right right uh well let me uh let
me try just sort of Steal man the ey

7484
02:28:42,429 --> 02:28:42,439

dummer's argument and actually I don't

7486
02:28:44,990 --> 02:28:45,000
dummer's argument and actually I don't
 

7487
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:49,309
dummer's argument and actually I don't
know it are AI doomers in the owski camp

7488
02:28:49,309 --> 02:28:49,319
know it are AI doomers in the owski camp
 

7489
02:28:49,319 --> 02:28:50,910
know it are AI doomers in the owski camp
saying it's definitely going to kill us

7490
02:28:50,910 --> 02:28:50,920
saying it's definitely going to kill us
 

7491
02:28:50,920 --> 02:28:53,110
saying it's definitely going to kill us
because there's a spectrum 95% I think

7492
02:28:53,110 --> 02:28:53,120
because there's a spectrum 95% I think
 

7493
02:28:53,120 --> 02:28:55,630
because there's a spectrum 95% I think
is the limit yeah 95% plus that's no not

7494
02:28:55,630 --> 02:28:55,640
is the limit yeah 95% plus that's no not
 

7495
02:28:55,640 --> 02:28:57,190
is the limit yeah 95% plus that's no not
not plus I think I don't know I was

7496
02:28:57,190 --> 02:28:57,200
not plus I think I don't know I was
 

7497
02:28:57,200 --> 02:28:58,830
not plus I think I don't know I was
seeing on Twitter today various things

7498
02:28:58,830 --> 02:28:58,840
seeing on Twitter today various things
 

7499
02:28:58,840 --> 02:29:01,230
seeing on Twitter today various things
but I think yakow is yak Kowski is at

7500
02:29:01,230 --> 02:29:01,240
but I think yakow is yak Kowski is at
 

7501
02:29:01,240 --> 02:29:04,150
but I think yakow is yak Kowski is at
95% but to belong to the AI dumer Club

7502
02:29:04,150 --> 02:29:04,160
95% but to belong to the AI dumer Club
 

7503
02:29:04,160 --> 02:29:05,630
95% but to belong to the AI dumer Club
is there a threshold I don't know what

7504
02:29:05,630 --> 02:29:05,640
is there a threshold I don't know what
 

7505
02:29:05,640 --> 02:29:07,670
is there a threshold I don't know what
the membership maybe and what are the

7506
02:29:07,670 --> 02:29:07,680
the membership maybe and what are the
 

7507
02:29:07,680 --> 02:29:10,710
the membership maybe and what are the
fees I think well I saw I think Scott

7508
02:29:10,710 --> 02:29:10,720
fees I think well I saw I think Scott
 

7509
02:29:10,720 --> 02:29:12,790
fees I think well I saw I think Scott
arenson like I was quite surprised had

7510
02:29:12,790 --> 02:29:12,800
arenson like I was quite surprised had
 

7511
02:29:12,800 --> 02:29:14,830
arenson like I was quite surprised had
put two I I saw this online so it could

7512
02:29:14,830 --> 02:29:14,840
put two I I saw this online so it could
 

7513
02:29:14,840 --> 02:29:16,990
put two I I saw this online so it could
be wrong so sorry if it's wrong um says

7514
02:29:16,990 --> 02:29:17,000
be wrong so sorry if it's wrong um says
 

7515
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,429
be wrong so sorry if it's wrong um says
2% but the thing is if you were to go if

7516
02:29:19,429 --> 02:29:19,439
2% but the thing is if you were to go if
 

7517
02:29:19,439 --> 02:29:21,670
2% but the thing is if you were to go if
you if someone said there's a 2% chance

7518
02:29:21,670 --> 02:29:21,680
you if someone said there's a 2% chance
 

7519
02:29:21,680 --> 02:29:22,910
you if someone said there's a 2% chance
you're going to die going into the lift

7520
02:29:22,910 --> 02:29:22,920
you're going to die going into the lift
 

7521
02:29:22,920 --> 02:29:24,349
you're going to die going into the lift
would you go into the lift in the

7522
02:29:24,349 --> 02:29:24,359
would you go into the lift in the
 

7523
02:29:24,359 --> 02:29:26,750
would you go into the lift in the
elevator for the American English

7524
02:29:26,750 --> 02:29:26,760
elevator for the American English
 

7525
02:29:26,760 --> 02:29:29,550
elevator for the American English
speaking audience uh well no not for the

7526
02:29:29,550 --> 02:29:29,560
speaking audience uh well no not for the
 

7527
02:29:29,560 --> 02:29:31,790
speaking audience uh well no not for the
elevator so I would say anyone higher

7528
02:29:31,790 --> 02:29:31,800
elevator so I would say anyone higher
 

7529
02:29:31,800 --> 02:29:34,510
elevator so I would say anyone higher
than 2% I mean like I I mean I think

7530
02:29:34,510 --> 02:29:34,520
than 2% I mean like I I mean I think
 

7531
02:29:34,520 --> 02:29:37,590
than 2% I mean like I I mean I think
there's a zero% chance of AGI Doom zero

7532
02:29:37,590 --> 02:29:37,600
there's a zero% chance of AGI Doom zero
 

7533
02:29:37,600 --> 02:29:39,590
there's a zero% chance of AGI Doom zero
just to push back on the on the

7534
02:29:39,590 --> 02:29:39,600
just to push back on the on the
 

7535
02:29:39,600 --> 02:29:43,870
just to push back on the on the
argument we're at n of zero on the AGI

7536
02:29:43,870 --> 02:29:43,880
argument we're at n of zero on the AGI
 

7537
02:29:43,880 --> 02:29:45,990
argument we're at n of zero on the AGI
we can see on Earth that there's

7538
02:29:45,990 --> 02:29:46,000
we can see on Earth that there's
 

7539
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,230
we can see on Earth that there's
increasing ing levels of intelligence of

7540
02:29:48,230 --> 02:29:48,240
increasing ing levels of intelligence of
 

7541
02:29:48,240 --> 02:29:50,510
increasing ing levels of intelligence of
organisms we can see what humans with

7542
02:29:50,510 --> 02:29:50,520
organisms we can see what humans with
 

7543
02:29:50,520 --> 02:29:52,030
organisms we can see what humans with
extra intelligence were able to do to

7544
02:29:52,030 --> 02:29:52,040
extra intelligence were able to do to
 

7545
02:29:52,040 --> 02:29:54,710
extra intelligence were able to do to
the other species so

7546
02:29:54,710 --> 02:29:54,720
the other species so
 

7547
02:29:54,720 --> 02:29:59,469
the other species so
that is uh a lot of

7548
02:29:59,469 --> 02:29:59,479
that is uh a lot of
 

7549
02:29:59,479 --> 02:30:02,269
that is uh a lot of
samples of data what a Delta and

7550
02:30:02,269 --> 02:30:02,279
samples of data what a Delta and
 

7551
02:30:02,279 --> 02:30:04,070
samples of data what a Delta and
intelligence gives you when you have an

7552
02:30:04,070 --> 02:30:04,080
intelligence gives you when you have an
 

7553
02:30:04,080 --> 02:30:06,389
intelligence gives you when you have an
increase in intelligence how you're able

7554
02:30:06,389 --> 02:30:06,399
increase in intelligence how you're able
 

7555
02:30:06,399 --> 02:30:08,830
increase in intelligence how you're able
to dominate a species on Earth and so

7556
02:30:08,830 --> 02:30:08,840
to dominate a species on Earth and so
 

7557
02:30:08,840 --> 02:30:11,190
to dominate a species on Earth and so
the idea there is that if you

7558
02:30:11,190 --> 02:30:11,200
the idea there is that if you
 

7559
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:15,510
the idea there is that if you
have a a being that's 10x smarter than

7560
02:30:15,510 --> 02:30:15,520
have a a being that's 10x smarter than
 

7561
02:30:15,520 --> 02:30:17,389
have a a being that's 10x smarter than
humans

7562
02:30:17,389 --> 02:30:17,399
humans
 

7563
02:30:17,399 --> 02:30:19,230
humans
we're not going to be able to predict

7564
02:30:19,230 --> 02:30:19,240
we're not going to be able to predict
 

7565
02:30:19,240 --> 02:30:22,830
we're not going to be able to predict
what that's going to with that being is

7566
02:30:22,830 --> 02:30:22,840
what that's going to with that being is
 

7567
02:30:22,840 --> 02:30:25,269
what that's going to with that being is
going to be able to do especially if it

7568
02:30:25,269 --> 02:30:25,279
going to be able to do especially if it
 

7569
02:30:25,279 --> 02:30:28,590
going to be able to do especially if it
has the power to hurt humans which you

7570
02:30:28,590 --> 02:30:28,600
has the power to hurt humans which you
 

7571
02:30:28,600 --> 02:30:30,269
has the power to hurt humans which you
can imagine a lot of trajectories in

7572
02:30:30,269 --> 02:30:30,279
can imagine a lot of trajectories in
 

7573
02:30:30,279 --> 02:30:33,510
can imagine a lot of trajectories in
which the more benefit AI systems give

7574
02:30:33,510 --> 02:30:33,520
which the more benefit AI systems give
 

7575
02:30:33,520 --> 02:30:35,230
which the more benefit AI systems give
the more control we give to those AI

7576
02:30:35,230 --> 02:30:35,240
the more control we give to those AI
 

7577
02:30:35,240 --> 02:30:39,550
the more control we give to those AI
systems over our power grid over uh our

7578
02:30:39,550 --> 02:30:39,560
systems over our power grid over uh our
 

7579
02:30:39,560 --> 02:30:42,670

nuclear weapons or weapons of any sort
 

7581
02:30:42,680 --> 02:30:45,710
nuclear weapons or weapons of any sort
and then it's hard to know what a Ultra

7582
02:30:45,710 --> 02:30:45,720
and then it's hard to know what a Ultra
 

7583
02:30:45,720 --> 02:30:46,750
and then it's hard to know what a Ultra
intelligence system would would be able

7584
02:30:46,750 --> 02:30:46,760
intelligence system would would be able
 

7585
02:30:46,760 --> 02:30:48,910
intelligence system would would be able
to do in that case you don't find that

7586
02:30:48,910 --> 02:30:48,920
to do in that case you don't find that
 

7587
02:30:48,920 --> 02:30:50,790
to do in that case you don't find that

7595
02:30:57,720 --> 02:30:59,510
all um we don't know where the intention
comes from the problem is that people

you didn't say super intelligent I'll
put the words into our mouth here super

7668
02:32:24,830 --> 02:32:24,840
put the words into our mouth here super
 

7669
02:32:24,840 --> 02:32:28,670
put the words into our mouth here super
intelligent that I think that um there

7670
02:32:28,670 --> 02:32:28,680
intelligent that I think that um there
 

7671
02:32:28,680 --> 02:32:29,870
intelligent that I think that um there
is

7672
02:32:29,870 --> 02:32:29,880
is
 

7673
02:32:29,880 --> 02:32:33,190
is
no no reason to expect that we are going

02:32:33,190 --> 02:32:33,200
no no reason to expect that we are going
 

7675
02:32:33,200 --> 02:32:35,269
no no reason to expect that we are going
to make systems that are more

7676
02:32:35,269 --> 02:32:35,279
to make systems that are more
 

7677
02:32:35,279 --> 02:32:38,670
to make systems that are more
intelligent more capable you know when

7678
02:32:38,670 --> 02:32:38,680

people play chess computers they don't

7680
02:32:40,389 --> 02:32:40,399
people play chess computers they don't
 

7681
02:32:40,399 --> 02:32:42,429
people play chess computers they don't
expect to win now right they just the

7682
02:32:42,429 --> 02:32:42,439
expect to win now right they just the
 

7683
02:32:42,439 --> 02:32:45,269

that doesn't mean it's super intelligent

7686
02:32:47,269 --> 02:32:47,279
that doesn't mean it's super intelligent
 

7687
02:32:47,279 --> 02:32:49,469
that doesn't mean it's super intelligent
so I think that super intelligence I

7688
02:32:49,469 --> 02:32:49,479
so I think that super intelligence I
 

7689
02:32:49,479 --> 02:32:51,349
so I think that super intelligence I
mean I think even Nick Bostrom is is

7690
02:32:51,349 --> 02:32:51,359
mean I think even Nick Bostrom is is
 

7691
02:32:51,359 --> 02:32:53,349
mean I think even Nick Bostrom is is

7693
02:32:53,359 --> 02:32:56,150
pulling back on this now cuz he invented
this so I see this a lot when did see

02:34:02,640 --> 02:34:05,469
human beings you are autonomous and
embodied intelligence so I think that

7756
02:34:05,469 --> 02:34:05,479
embodied intelligence so I think that
 

7757
02:34:05,479 --> 02:34:07,269
embodied intelligence so I think that
there are so many levels that we're

7758
02:34:07,269 --> 02:34:07,279
there are so many levels that we're
 

7759
02:34:07,279 --> 02:34:09,830
there are so many levels that we're
missing out we've just kind of went oh

7760
02:34:09,830 --> 02:34:09,840
missing out we've just kind of went oh
 

7761
02:34:09,840 --> 02:34:12,469
missing out we've just kind of went oh
we've discovered fire oh gosh the

7762
02:34:12,469 --> 02:34:12,479
we've discovered fire oh gosh the
 

7763
02:34:12,479 --> 02:34:14,150
we've discovered fire oh gosh the
planet's just going to burn one day

7764
02:34:14,150 --> 02:34:14,160
planet's just going to burn one day
 

7765
02:34:14,160 --> 02:34:16,429
planet's just going to burn one day
randomly m i mean I just don't

7766
02:34:16,429 --> 02:34:16,439
randomly m i mean I just don't
 

7767
02:34:16,439 --> 02:34:17,830
randomly m i mean I just don't
understand that leap there are bigger

7768
02:34:17,830 --> 02:34:17,840
understand that leap there are bigger
 

7769
02:34:17,840 --> 02:34:20,389
understand that leap there are bigger
problems we need to worry about so what

7770
02:34:20,389 --> 02:34:20,399
problems we need to worry about so what
 

7771
02:34:20,399 --> 02:34:22,550
problems we need to worry about so what
is the motivation why are these people

7772
02:34:22,550 --> 02:34:22,560
is the motivation why are these people
 

7773
02:34:22,560 --> 02:34:25,030
is the motivation why are these people
let's assume they have their Earnest

7774
02:34:25,030 --> 02:34:25,040
let's assume they have their Earnest
 

7775
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:27,910
let's assume they have their Earnest
have this conviction well I think it's

7776
02:34:27,910 --> 02:34:27,920
have this conviction well I think it's
 

7777
02:34:27,920 --> 02:34:30,670
have this conviction well I think it's
just it's kind of they're making leaps

7778
02:34:30,670 --> 02:34:30,680
just it's kind of they're making leaps
 

7779
02:34:30,680 --> 02:34:32,630
just it's kind of they're making leaps
that they're trapped in a virtual

7780
02:34:32,630 --> 02:34:32,640
that they're trapped in a virtual
 

7781
02:34:32,640 --> 02:34:35,910
that they're trapped in a virtual
reality that isn't reality well I mean I

7782
02:34:35,910 --> 02:34:35,920
reality that isn't reality well I mean I
 

7783
02:34:35,920 --> 02:34:37,710
reality that isn't reality well I mean I
can continue a set of arguments here but

7784
02:34:37,710 --> 02:34:37,720
can continue a set of arguments here but
 

7785
02:34:37,720 --> 02:34:40,389
can continue a set of arguments here but
also it is true that

7786
02:34:40,389 --> 02:34:40,399
also it is true that
 

7787
02:34:40,399 --> 02:34:44,150
also it is true that
ideologies that fear Monger are

7788
02:34:44,150 --> 02:34:44,160
ideologies that fear Monger are
 

7789
02:34:44,160 --> 02:34:46,670
ideologies that fear Monger are
dangerous because you can then

7790
02:34:46,670 --> 02:34:46,680
dangerous because you can then
 

7791
02:34:46,680 --> 02:34:50,750
dangerous because you can then
use it to control to to regulate in a

7792
02:34:50,750 --> 02:34:50,760
use it to control to to regulate in a
 

7793
02:34:50,760 --> 02:34:54,150
use it to control to to regulate in a
way that uh halts progress to control

7794
02:34:54,150 --> 02:34:54,160
way that uh halts progress to control
 

7795
02:34:54,160 --> 02:34:57,510
way that uh halts progress to control
people and to uh to cancel people all

7796
02:34:57,510 --> 02:34:57,520
people and to uh to cancel people all
 

7797
02:34:57,520 --> 02:34:58,910
people and to uh to cancel people all
that kind of stuff so you have to be

7798
02:34:58,910 --> 02:34:58,920
that kind of stuff so you have to be
 

7799
02:34:58,920 --> 02:35:01,590
that kind of stuff so you have to be
careful because you reason ultimately

7800
02:35:01,590 --> 02:35:01,600
careful because you reason ultimately
 

7801
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:04,710
careful because you reason ultimately
wins right but there there is a lot of

7802
02:35:04,710 --> 02:35:04,720
wins right but there there is a lot of
 

7803
02:35:04,720 --> 02:35:06,950
wins right but there there is a lot of
concerns with super intelligent systems

7804
02:35:06,950 --> 02:35:06,960
concerns with super intelligent systems
 

7805
02:35:06,960 --> 02:35:09,150
concerns with super intelligent systems
very capable systems when you I think

7806
02:35:09,150 --> 02:35:09,160
very capable systems when you I think
 

7807
02:35:09,160 --> 02:35:11,190
very capable systems when you I think
when I when you hear the word super

7808
02:35:11,190 --> 02:35:11,200
when I when you hear the word super
 

7809
02:35:11,200 --> 02:35:14,150
when I when you hear the word super
intelligent you're hearing like it's

7810
02:35:14,150 --> 02:35:14,160
intelligent you're hearing like it's
 

7811
02:35:14,160 --> 02:35:16,269
intelligent you're hearing like it's
smarter than humans in every way that

7812
02:35:16,269 --> 02:35:16,279
smarter than humans in every way that
 

7813
02:35:16,279 --> 02:35:20,230
smarter than humans in every way that
humans are smart but

7814
02:35:20,230 --> 02:35:20,240
humans are smart but
 

7815
02:35:20,240 --> 02:35:23,630
humans are smart but
the paperclip manufacturing system

7816
02:35:23,630 --> 02:35:23,640
the paperclip manufacturing system
 

7817
02:35:23,640 --> 02:35:26,269
the paperclip manufacturing system
doesn't need to be smart in every way

7818
02:35:26,269 --> 02:35:26,279
doesn't need to be smart in every way
 

7819
02:35:26,279 --> 02:35:28,070
doesn't need to be smart in every way
just need to be smart in a set of

7820
02:35:28,070 --> 02:35:28,080
just need to be smart in a set of
 

7821
02:35:28,080 --> 02:35:31,710
just need to be smart in a set of
specific ways and the more uh capable

7822
02:35:31,710 --> 02:35:31,720
specific ways and the more uh capable
 

7823
02:35:31,720 --> 02:35:33,870
specific ways and the more uh capable
the ad systems become the more you could

7824
02:35:33,870 --> 02:35:33,880
the ad systems become the more you could
 

7825
02:35:33,880 --> 02:35:36,190
the ad systems become the more you could
see us giving them control over like I

7826
02:35:36,190 --> 02:35:36,200
see us giving them control over like I
 

7827
02:35:36,200 --> 02:35:38,590
see us giving them control over like I
said our power grid a lot of aspects of

7828
02:35:38,590 --> 02:35:38,600
said our power grid a lot of aspects of
 

7829
02:35:38,600 --> 02:35:40,950
said our power grid a lot of aspects of
human life and that means they will be

7830
02:35:40,950 --> 02:35:40,960
human life and that means they will be
 

7831
02:35:40,960 --> 02:35:43,190
human life and that means they will be
able to do more and more damage when

7832
02:35:43,190 --> 02:35:43,200
able to do more and more damage when
 

7833
02:35:43,200 --> 02:35:45,349
able to do more and more damage when
there's unintended consequences that

7834
02:35:45,349 --> 02:35:45,359
there's unintended consequences that
 

7835
02:35:45,359 --> 02:35:46,830
there's unintended consequences that
come to life

7836
02:35:46,830 --> 02:35:46,840
come to life
 

7837
02:35:46,840 --> 02:35:48,550
come to life
I I think that that's right that the

7838
02:35:48,550 --> 02:35:48,560
I I think that that's right that the
 

7839
02:35:48,560 --> 02:35:50,309
I I think that that's right that the
unintended consequences we have to think

7840
02:35:50,309 --> 02:35:50,319
unintended consequences we have to think
 

7841
02:35:50,319 --> 02:35:52,990
unintended consequences we have to think
about and I'm that I fully I fully agree

7842
02:35:52,990 --> 02:35:53,000
about and I'm that I fully I fully agree
 

7843
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:56,309
about and I'm that I fully I fully agree
with but let's go back a bit sentient I

7844
02:35:56,309 --> 02:35:56,319
with but let's go back a bit sentient I
 

7845
02:35:56,319 --> 02:35:58,190
with but let's go back a bit sentient I
mean I'm again I'm far away from my

7846
02:35:58,190 --> 02:35:58,200
mean I'm again I'm far away from my
 

7847
02:35:58,200 --> 02:35:59,550
mean I'm again I'm far away from my
comfort zone and all this stuff but hey

7848
02:35:59,550 --> 02:35:59,560
comfort zone and all this stuff but hey
 

7849
02:35:59,560 --> 02:36:01,469
comfort zone and all this stuff but hey
let's talk about it because I give

7850
02:36:01,469 --> 02:36:01,479
let's talk about it because I give
 

7851
02:36:01,479 --> 02:36:03,309
let's talk about it because I give
myself a qualification in yeah we're

7852
02:36:03,309 --> 02:36:03,319
myself a qualification in yeah we're
 

7853
02:36:03,319 --> 02:36:06,110
myself a qualification in yeah we're
both qualified in sentients I think yeah

7854
02:36:06,110 --> 02:36:06,120
both qualified in sentients I think yeah
 

7855
02:36:06,120 --> 02:36:07,429
both qualified in sentients I think yeah
as much as anyone else I think the

7856
02:36:07,429 --> 02:36:07,439
as much as anyone else I think the
 

7857
02:36:07,439 --> 02:36:09,590
as much as anyone else I think the
paperclip scenario is just such a poor

7858
02:36:09,590 --> 02:36:09,600
paperclip scenario is just such a poor
 

7859
02:36:09,600 --> 02:36:10,990
paperclip scenario is just such a poor
one because let's think about how that

7860
02:36:10,990 --> 02:36:11,000
one because let's think about how that
 

7861
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,269
one because let's think about how that
would happen um and also let's think

7862
02:36:13,269 --> 02:36:13,279
would happen um and also let's think
 

7863
02:36:13,279 --> 02:36:17,070
would happen um and also let's think
about we are being so um

7864
02:36:17,070 --> 02:36:17,080
about we are being so um
 

7865
02:36:17,080 --> 02:36:18,429
about we are being so um
unrealistic about how much of the

7866
02:36:18,429 --> 02:36:18,439
unrealistic about how much of the
 

7867
02:36:18,439 --> 02:36:20,870
unrealistic about how much of the
Earth's surface we have

7868
02:36:20,870 --> 02:36:20,880
Earth's surface we have
 

7869
02:36:20,880 --> 02:36:23,429
Earth's surface we have
commandeered you know for paper M clip

7870
02:36:23,429 --> 02:36:23,439
commandeered you know for paper M clip
 

7871
02:36:23,439 --> 02:36:25,630
commandeered you know for paper M clip
manufacturing to really happen I mean do

7872
02:36:25,630 --> 02:36:25,640
manufacturing to really happen I mean do
 

7873
02:36:25,640 --> 02:36:28,070
manufacturing to really happen I mean do
the math it's like it's it's not going

7874
02:36:28,070 --> 02:36:28,080
the math it's like it's it's not going
 

7875
02:36:28,080 --> 02:36:29,349
the math it's like it's it's not going
to happen there's not enough energy

7876
02:36:29,349 --> 02:36:29,359
to happen there's not enough energy
 

7877
02:36:29,359 --> 02:36:30,910
to happen there's not enough energy
there's not enough resource where they

7878
02:36:30,910 --> 02:36:30,920
there's not enough resource where they
 

7879
02:36:30,920 --> 02:36:33,269
there's not enough resource where they
all going to come from I think that what

7880
02:36:33,269 --> 02:36:33,279
all going to come from I think that what
 

7881
02:36:33,279 --> 02:36:37,389
all going to come from I think that what
happens in evolution is really it why is

7882
02:36:37,389 --> 02:36:37,399
happens in evolution is really it why is
 

7883
02:36:37,399 --> 02:36:39,269
happens in evolution is really it why is
why is a killer virus not killed out all

7884
02:36:39,269 --> 02:36:39,279
why is a killer virus not killed out all
 

7885
02:36:39,279 --> 02:36:41,670
why is a killer virus not killed out all
of not killed all life on Earth what

7886
02:36:41,670 --> 02:36:41,680
of not killed all life on Earth what
 

7887
02:36:41,680 --> 02:36:44,110
of not killed all life on Earth what
happens is sure super killer viruses

7888
02:36:44,110 --> 02:36:44,120
happens is sure super killer viruses
 

7889
02:36:44,120 --> 02:36:45,990
happens is sure super killer viruses
that kill the ribosome have emerged but

7890
02:36:45,990 --> 02:36:46,000
that kill the ribosome have emerged but
 

7891
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,670
that kill the ribosome have emerged but
you know what happens they nuke a small

7892
02:36:48,670 --> 02:36:48,680
you know what happens they nuke a small
 

7893
02:36:48,680 --> 02:36:50,429
you know what happens they nuke a small
space and because they can't propagate

7894
02:36:50,429 --> 02:36:50,439
space and because they can't propagate
 

7895
02:36:50,439 --> 02:36:52,469
space and because they can't propagate
they all die so there's this interplay

7896
02:36:52,469 --> 02:36:52,479
they all die so there's this interplay
 

7897
02:36:52,479 --> 02:36:54,429
they all die so there's this interplay
between evolution and propagation right

7898
02:36:54,429 --> 02:36:54,439
between evolution and propagation right
 

7899
02:36:54,439 --> 02:36:57,910
between evolution and propagation right
and death and so in evolution you don't

7900
02:36:57,910 --> 02:36:57,920
and death and so in evolution you don't
 

7901
02:36:57,920 --> 02:36:59,389
and death and so in evolution you don't
think it's possible to engineer for

7902
02:36:59,389 --> 02:36:59,399
think it's possible to engineer for
 

7903
02:36:59,399 --> 02:37:01,550
think it's possible to engineer for
example sorry to interrupt but like a

7904
02:37:01,550 --> 02:37:01,560
example sorry to interrupt but like a
 

7905
02:37:01,560 --> 02:37:03,870
example sorry to interrupt but like a
perfect virus no there's deadly enough

7906
02:37:03,870 --> 02:37:03,880
perfect virus no there's deadly enough
 

7907
02:37:03,880 --> 02:37:07,030
perfect virus no there's deadly enough
no nonsensical okay I think that just

7908
02:37:07,030 --> 02:37:07,040
no nonsensical okay I think that just
 

7909
02:37:07,040 --> 02:37:08,230
no nonsensical okay I think that just
wouldn't again it wouldn't work it was

7910
02:37:08,230 --> 02:37:08,240
wouldn't again it wouldn't work it was
 

7911
02:37:08,240 --> 02:37:09,750
wouldn't again it wouldn't work it was
too deadly it would just kill the radius

7912
02:37:09,750 --> 02:37:09,760
too deadly it would just kill the radius
 

7913
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:12,469
too deadly it would just kill the radius
and not replicate it yeah I mean but you

7914
02:37:12,469 --> 02:37:12,479
and not replicate it yeah I mean but you
 

7915
02:37:12,479 --> 02:37:14,630
and not replicate it yeah I mean but you
don't think it's possible to get a I

7916
02:37:14,630 --> 02:37:14,640
don't think it's possible to get a I
 

7917
02:37:14,640 --> 02:37:18,590
don't think it's possible to get a I
mean if you were super I mean I if you

7918
02:37:18,590 --> 02:37:18,600
mean if you were super I mean I if you
 

7919
02:37:18,600 --> 02:37:21,349
mean if you were super I mean I if you
were it not kill all of life on Earth

7920
02:37:21,349 --> 02:37:21,359
were it not kill all of life on Earth
 

7921
02:37:21,359 --> 02:37:22,870
were it not kill all of life on Earth
but kill all humans there's not many of

7922
02:37:22,870 --> 02:37:22,880
but kill all humans there's not many of
 

7923
02:37:22,880 --> 02:37:25,309
but kill all humans there's not many of
us there's only like 8

7924
02:37:25,309 --> 02:37:25,319
us there's only like 8
 

7925
02:37:25,319 --> 02:37:28,030
us there's only like 8
billion there there's so much more ants

7926
02:37:28,030 --> 02:37:28,040
billion there there's so much more ants
 

7927
02:37:28,040 --> 02:37:30,150
billion there there's so much more ants
I mean I don't I so many more

7928
02:37:30,150 --> 02:37:30,160
I mean I don't I so many more
 

7929
02:37:30,160 --> 02:37:34,030
I mean I don't I so many more
ants and they're pretty smart I think we

7930
02:37:34,030 --> 02:37:34,040
ants and they're pretty smart I think we
 

7931
02:37:34,040 --> 02:37:35,870
ants and they're pretty smart I think we
the nice thing about what we where we

7932
02:37:35,870 --> 02:37:35,880
the nice thing about what we where we
 

7933
02:37:35,880 --> 02:37:39,910
the nice thing about what we where we
are I would love for the AI crowd to

7934
02:37:39,910 --> 02:37:39,920
are I would love for the AI crowd to
 

7935
02:37:39,920 --> 02:37:41,550
are I would love for the AI crowd to
take a leaf out of the book of the

7936
02:37:41,550 --> 02:37:41,560
take a leaf out of the book of the
 

7937
02:37:41,560 --> 02:37:44,150
take a leaf out of the book of the
biowarfare chemical warfare

7938
02:37:44,150 --> 02:37:44,160
biowarfare chemical warfare
 

7939
02:37:44,160 --> 02:37:47,429
biowarfare chemical warfare
crowd um I mean not love because

7940
02:37:47,429 --> 02:37:47,439
crowd um I mean not love because
 

7941
02:37:47,439 --> 02:37:48,550
crowd um I mean not love because
actually people have been killed with

7942
02:37:48,550 --> 02:37:48,560
actually people have been killed with
 

7943
02:37:48,560 --> 02:37:49,950
actually people have been killed with
chemical weapons in the first and second

7944
02:37:49,950 --> 02:37:49,960
chemical weapons in the first and second
 

7945
02:37:49,960 --> 02:37:52,110
chemical weapons in the first and second
world war and people and bioweapons have

7946
02:37:52,110 --> 02:37:52,120
world war and people and bioweapons have
 

7947
02:37:52,120 --> 02:37:53,550
world war and people and bioweapons have
been made and you know we can argue

7948
02:37:53,550 --> 02:37:53,560
been made and you know we can argue
 

7949
02:37:53,560 --> 02:37:55,349
been made and you know we can argue
about covid-19 and all this stuff let's

7950
02:37:55,349 --> 02:37:55,359
about covid-19 and all this stuff let's
 

7951
02:37:55,359 --> 02:37:57,309
about covid-19 and all this stuff let's
not go there just now but I think there

7952
02:37:57,309 --> 02:37:57,319
not go there just now but I think there
 

7953
02:37:57,319 --> 02:37:59,150
not go there just now but I think there
is a consensus that some certain things

7954
02:37:59,150 --> 02:37:59,160
is a consensus that some certain things
 

7955
02:37:59,160 --> 02:38:01,630
is a consensus that some certain things
are bad and we shouldn't do them right

7956
02:38:01,630 --> 02:38:01,640
are bad and we shouldn't do them right
 

7957
02:38:01,640 --> 02:38:04,550
are bad and we shouldn't do them right
and um and sure it would be possible for

7958
02:38:04,550 --> 02:38:04,560
and um and sure it would be possible for
 

7959
02:38:04,560 --> 02:38:08,429
and um and sure it would be possible for
a bad actor to to engineer something bad

7960
02:38:08,429 --> 02:38:08,439
a bad actor to to engineer something bad
 

7961
02:38:08,439 --> 02:38:10,870
a bad actor to to engineer something bad
but the LI the damage would be we would

7962
02:38:10,870 --> 02:38:10,880
but the LI the damage would be we would
 

7963
02:38:10,880 --> 02:38:13,550
but the LI the damage would be we would
see it coming and we would be able to do

7964
02:38:13,550 --> 02:38:13,560
see it coming and we would be able to do
 

7965
02:38:13,560 --> 02:38:18,110
see it coming and we would be able to do
something about it uh um

7966
02:38:18,110 --> 02:38:18,120
something about it uh um
 

7967
02:38:18,120 --> 02:38:21,389
something about it uh um
now I I guess what I'm trying to say is

7968
02:38:21,389 --> 02:38:21,399
now I I guess what I'm trying to say is
 

7969
02:38:21,399 --> 02:38:23,950
now I I guess what I'm trying to say is
when people talk about doom and they

7970
02:38:23,950 --> 02:38:23,960
when people talk about doom and they
 

7971
02:38:23,960 --> 02:38:25,510
when people talk about doom and they
just when you ask them for the mechanism

7972
02:38:25,510 --> 02:38:25,520
just when you ask them for the mechanism
 

7973
02:38:25,520 --> 02:38:28,870
just when you ask them for the mechanism
they just say um you know they just make

7974
02:38:28,870 --> 02:38:28,880
they just say um you know they just make
 

7975
02:38:28,880 --> 02:38:30,990
they just say um you know they just make
something up I'm I mean in this case I'm

7976
02:38:30,990 --> 02:38:31,000
something up I'm I mean in this case I'm
 

7977
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,510
something up I'm I mean in this case I'm
Yan laon I think he put out a very good

7978
02:38:33,510 --> 02:38:33,520
Yan laon I think he put out a very good
 

7979
02:38:33,520 --> 02:38:35,150
Yan laon I think he put out a very good
point about trying to regulate jet

7980
02:38:35,150 --> 02:38:35,160
point about trying to regulate jet
 

7981
02:38:35,160 --> 02:38:37,230
point about trying to regulate jet
engines before we've even invented them

7982
02:38:37,230 --> 02:38:37,240
engines before we've even invented them
 

7983
02:38:37,240 --> 02:38:39,110
engines before we've even invented them
yeah and I think that's what I'm saying

7984
02:38:39,110 --> 02:38:39,120
yeah and I think that's what I'm saying
 

7985
02:38:39,120 --> 02:38:41,990
yeah and I think that's what I'm saying
I'm not saying we should I just don't

7986
02:38:41,990 --> 02:38:42,000
I'm not saying we should I just don't
 

7987
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:43,269
I'm not saying we should I just don't
understand why these guys are going

7988
02:38:43,269 --> 02:38:43,279
understand why these guys are going
 

7989
02:38:43,279 --> 02:38:45,389
understand why these guys are going
around making literally making stuff up

7990
02:38:45,389 --> 02:38:45,399
around making literally making stuff up
 

7991
02:38:45,399 --> 02:38:47,790
around making literally making stuff up
about all dying yeah when basically we

7992
02:38:47,790 --> 02:38:47,800
about all dying yeah when basically we
 

7993
02:38:47,800 --> 02:38:51,150
about all dying yeah when basically we
need to actually really focus on now

7994
02:38:51,150 --> 02:38:51,160
need to actually really focus on now
 

7995
02:38:51,160 --> 02:38:53,190
need to actually really focus on now
let's say there's some actors are

7996
02:38:53,190 --> 02:38:53,200
let's say there's some actors are
 

7997
02:38:53,200 --> 02:38:56,309
let's say there's some actors are
earnest right let's say owski is Being

7998
02:38:56,309 --> 02:38:56,319
earnest right let's say owski is Being
 

7999
02:38:56,319 --> 02:38:58,990
earnest right let's say owski is Being
Earnest right and he really cares but

8000
02:38:58,990 --> 02:38:59,000
Earnest right and he really cares but
 

8001
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:00,750
Earnest right and he really cares but
then but he loves it goes and then

8002
02:39:00,750 --> 02:39:00,760
then but he loves it goes and then
 

8003
02:39:00,760 --> 02:39:02,469
then but he loves it goes and then
you're all going to die it's like you

8004
02:39:02,469 --> 02:39:02,479
you're all going to die it's like you
 

8005
02:39:02,479 --> 02:39:03,469
you're all going to die it's like you
know why don't we try and do the same

8006
02:39:03,469 --> 02:39:03,479
know why don't we try and do the same
 

8007
02:39:03,479 --> 02:39:04,750
know why don't we try and do the same
thing and say you could do this and then

8008
02:39:04,750 --> 02:39:04,760
thing and say you could do this and then
 

8009
02:39:04,760 --> 02:39:06,590
thing and say you could do this and then
you're going to be happy forever after

8010
02:39:06,590 --> 02:39:06,600
you're going to be happy forever after
 

8011
02:39:06,600 --> 02:39:09,150
you're going to be happy forever after
yeah you know well I I think uh there's

8012
02:39:09,150 --> 02:39:09,160
yeah you know well I I think uh there's
 

8013
02:39:09,160 --> 02:39:11,230
yeah you know well I I think uh there's
several things to say there uh one I

8014
02:39:11,230 --> 02:39:11,240
several things to say there uh one I
 

8015
02:39:11,240 --> 02:39:12,710
several things to say there uh one I
think there is a role in society for

8016
02:39:12,710 --> 02:39:12,720
think there is a role in society for
 

8017
02:39:12,720 --> 02:39:14,389
think there is a role in society for
people that say we're all going to die

8018
02:39:14,389 --> 02:39:14,399
people that say we're all going to die
 

8019
02:39:14,399 --> 02:39:16,429
people that say we're all going to die
because I think

8020
02:39:16,429 --> 02:39:16,439
because I think
 

8021
02:39:16,439 --> 02:39:18,750
because I think
uh it filters through as a message as a

8022
02:39:18,750 --> 02:39:18,760
uh it filters through as a message as a
 

8023
02:39:18,760 --> 02:39:21,150
uh it filters through as a message as a
viral message that gives us the proper

8024
02:39:21,150 --> 02:39:21,160
viral message that gives us the proper
 

8025
02:39:21,160 --> 02:39:24,389
viral message that gives us the proper
amount of uh concern okay right meaning

8026
02:39:24,389 --> 02:39:24,399
amount of uh concern okay right meaning
 

8027
02:39:24,399 --> 02:39:28,150
amount of uh concern okay right meaning
not the it's not 95% but when you say

8028
02:39:28,150 --> 02:39:28,160
not the it's not 95% but when you say
 

8029
02:39:28,160 --> 02:39:31,469
not the it's not 95% but when you say
95% and it filters through Society it'll

8030
02:39:31,469 --> 02:39:31,479
95% and it filters through Society it'll
 

8031
02:39:31,479 --> 02:39:34,230
95% and it filters through Society it'll
give an average of like a

8032
02:39:34,230 --> 02:39:34,240
give an average of like a
 

8033
02:39:34,240 --> 02:39:37,230
give an average of like a
0.3% an average so it's nice to have

8034
02:39:37,230 --> 02:39:37,240
0.3% an average so it's nice to have
 

8035
02:39:37,240 --> 02:39:38,790
0.3% an average so it's nice to have
people that are like we're all going to

8036
02:39:38,790 --> 02:39:38,800
people that are like we're all going to
 

8037
02:39:38,800 --> 02:39:41,309
people that are like we're all going to
die then we'll have a proper concern

8038
02:39:41,309 --> 02:39:41,319
die then we'll have a proper concern
 

8039
02:39:41,319 --> 02:39:43,389
die then we'll have a proper concern
like for example I do believe we're not

8040
02:39:43,389 --> 02:39:43,399
like for example I do believe we're not
 

8041
02:39:43,399 --> 02:39:45,269
like for example I do believe we're not
properly concerned about the threat of

8042
02:39:45,269 --> 02:39:45,279
properly concerned about the threat of
 

8043
02:39:45,279 --> 02:39:48,830
properly concerned about the threat of
nuclear weapons currently like that that

8044
02:39:48,830 --> 02:39:48,840
nuclear weapons currently like that that
 

8045
02:39:48,840 --> 02:39:50,429
nuclear weapons currently like that that
it just seems like people have forgotten

8046
02:39:50,429 --> 02:39:50,439
it just seems like people have forgotten
 

8047
02:39:50,439 --> 02:39:52,710
it just seems like people have forgotten
that that's a thing and you know there's

8048
02:39:52,710 --> 02:39:52,720
that that's a thing and you know there's
 

8049
02:39:52,720 --> 02:39:55,950
that that's a thing and you know there's
a war in Ukraine with the nuclear power

8050
02:39:55,950 --> 02:39:55,960
a war in Ukraine with the nuclear power
 

8051
02:39:55,960 --> 02:39:57,309
a war in Ukraine with the nuclear power
involved there's nuclear Powers

8052
02:39:57,309 --> 02:39:57,319
involved there's nuclear Powers
 

8053
02:39:57,319 --> 02:39:58,790
involved there's nuclear Powers
throughout the world and it just feels

8054
02:39:58,790 --> 02:39:58,800
throughout the world and it just feels
 

8055
02:39:58,800 --> 02:40:01,070
throughout the world and it just feels
like we're on the brink of a potential

8056
02:40:01,070 --> 02:40:01,080
like we're on the brink of a potential
 

8057
02:40:01,080 --> 02:40:03,870
like we're on the brink of a potential
World War to a percentage that I don't

8058
02:40:03,870 --> 02:40:03,880
World War to a percentage that I don't
 

8059
02:40:03,880 --> 02:40:06,469
World War to a percentage that I don't
think people are properly calibrating

8060
02:40:06,469 --> 02:40:06,479
think people are properly calibrating
 

8061
02:40:06,479 --> 02:40:08,309
think people are properly calibrating
like in their head we're all thinking

8062
02:40:08,309 --> 02:40:08,319
like in their head we're all thinking
 

8063
02:40:08,319 --> 02:40:10,150
like in their head we're all thinking
it's a Twitter battle that's opposed to

8064
02:40:10,150 --> 02:40:10,160
it's a Twitter battle that's opposed to
 

8065
02:40:10,160 --> 02:40:13,150
it's a Twitter battle that's opposed to
like actual threat so like it's nice to

8066
02:40:13,150 --> 02:40:13,160
like actual threat so like it's nice to
 

8067
02:40:13,160 --> 02:40:15,790
like actual threat so like it's nice to
have that kind of level of concern but

8068
02:40:15,790 --> 02:40:15,800
have that kind of level of concern but
 

8069
02:40:15,800 --> 02:40:18,389
have that kind of level of concern but
to me like what I when I hear AI doors

8070
02:40:18,389 --> 02:40:18,399
to me like what I when I hear AI doors
 

8071
02:40:18,399 --> 02:40:21,190
to me like what I when I hear AI doors
what I'm imagining is with unintended

8072
02:40:21,190 --> 02:40:21,200
what I'm imagining is with unintended
 

8073
02:40:21,200 --> 02:40:24,750
what I'm imagining is with unintended
consequences a potential situation

8074
02:40:24,750 --> 02:40:24,760
consequences a potential situation
 

8075
02:40:24,760 --> 02:40:28,830
consequences a potential situation
where uh let's say 5% of the world

8076
02:40:28,830 --> 02:40:28,840
where uh let's say 5% of the world
 

8077
02:40:28,840 --> 02:40:31,670
where uh let's say 5% of the world
suffers deeply because of a mistake made

8078
02:40:31,670 --> 02:40:31,680
suffers deeply because of a mistake made
 

8079
02:40:31,680 --> 02:40:33,510
suffers deeply because of a mistake made
of unintended consequences I don't

8080
02:40:33,510 --> 02:40:33,520
of unintended consequences I don't
 

8081
02:40:33,520 --> 02:40:34,750
of unintended consequences I don't
imagine the entirety of human

8082
02:40:34,750 --> 02:40:34,760
imagine the entirety of human
 

8083
02:40:34,760 --> 02:40:37,030
imagine the entirety of human
civilization dying but there's could be

8084
02:40:37,030 --> 02:40:37,040
civilization dying but there's could be
 

8085
02:40:37,040 --> 02:40:39,230
civilization dying but there's could be
a lot of suffering if this is done poor

8086
02:40:39,230 --> 02:40:39,240
a lot of suffering if this is done poor
 

8087
02:40:39,240 --> 02:40:41,870
a lot of suffering if this is done poor
I I understand that and I'm I kind of I

8088
02:40:41,870 --> 02:40:41,880
I I understand that and I'm I kind of I
 

8089
02:40:41,880 --> 02:40:43,550
I I understand that and I'm I kind of I
guess I mean I'm involved in the whole

8090
02:40:43,550 --> 02:40:43,560
guess I mean I'm involved in the whole
 

8091
02:40:43,560 --> 02:40:46,790
guess I mean I'm involved in the whole
hype cycle like why what I would like us

8092
02:40:46,790 --> 02:40:46,800
hype cycle like why what I would like us
 

8093
02:40:46,800 --> 02:40:49,670
hype cycle like why what I would like us
to I don't want us to so what's

8094
02:40:49,670 --> 02:40:49,680
to I don't want us to so what's
 

8095
02:40:49,680 --> 02:40:52,269
to I don't want us to so what's
happening right now is there seems to be

8096
02:40:52,269 --> 02:40:52,279
happening right now is there seems to be
 

8097
02:40:52,279 --> 02:40:54,950
happening right now is there seems to be
so let me let's say having some people

8098
02:40:54,950 --> 02:40:54,960
so let me let's say having some people
 

8099
02:40:54,960 --> 02:40:58,070
so let me let's say having some people
saying ai ai Doom is a worry fine let's

8100
02:40:58,070 --> 02:40:58,080
saying ai ai Doom is a worry fine let's
 

8101
02:40:58,080 --> 02:40:59,950
saying ai ai Doom is a worry fine let's
give them that but it what seems to be

8102
02:40:59,950 --> 02:40:59,960
give them that but it what seems to be
 

8103
02:40:59,960 --> 02:41:01,990
give them that but it what seems to be
happening is there seems to be people

8104
02:41:01,990 --> 02:41:02,000
happening is there seems to be people
 

8105
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:03,710
happening is there seems to be people
who don't think AI is doing they're

8106
02:41:03,710 --> 02:41:03,720
who don't think AI is doing they're
 

8107

who don't think AI is doing they're
trying to use that to control regulation

trying to use that to control regulation
 

8109
02:41:06,479 --> 02:41:08,950
trying to use that to control regulation
and to push people to regulate where

8110
02:41:08,950 --> 02:41:08,960
and to push people to regulate where

which which stops humans generating
 

8113
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,110
which which stops humans generating
knowledge and I am an advocate for

8114
02:41:13,110 --> 02:41:13,120
knowledge and I am an advocate for
 

8115
02:41:13,120 --> 02:41:14,950
knowledge and I am an advocate for
generating as much knowledge as possible

8116
02:41:14,950 --> 02:41:14,960
generating as much knowledge as possible
 

8117

nuclear Doom a lot of adults were really
 

8123
02:41:23,040 --> 02:41:25,590
nuclear Doom a lot of adults were really
had existential threat almost as bad as

had existential threat almost as bad as
 

8125
02:41:25,600 --> 02:41:27,349
had existential threat almost as bad as
now with AI Doom they were really

8126
02:41:27,349 --> 02:41:27,359
now with AI Doom they were really
 

8127
02:41:27,359 --> 02:41:29,230
now with AI Doom they were really
worried right there was some great well

8128
02:41:29,230 --> 02:41:29,240
worried right there was some great well
 

8129
02:41:29,240 --> 02:41:30,910

not great there was some hor horrific

8130
02:41:30,910 --> 02:41:30,920
not great there was some hor horrific
 

8131
02:41:30,920 --> 02:41:32,750
not great there was some hor horrific
documentaries I think there's one called

8132
02:41:32,750 --> 02:41:32,760
documentaries I think there's one called
 

8133
02:41:32,760 --> 02:41:36,150
documentaries I think there's one called
Freds that was generated in the UK which

8134
02:41:36,150 --> 02:41:36,160
Freds that was generated in the UK which
 

8135
02:41:36,160 --> 02:41:38,790
Freds that was generated in the UK which
was like it was terrible it was like so

8136
02:41:38,790 --> 02:41:38,800
was like it was terrible it was like so
 

8137
02:41:38,800 --> 02:41:43,790
was like it was terrible it was like so
scary um and I think that the correct

8138
02:41:43,790 --> 02:41:43,800
scary um and I think that the correct
 

8139
02:41:43,800 --> 02:41:45,070
scary um and I think that the correct
thing to do is obviously get rid of

8140
02:41:45,070 --> 02:41:45,080
thing to do is obviously get rid of
 

8141
02:41:45,080 --> 02:41:46,349
thing to do is obviously get rid of
nuclear weapons but let's think about

8142
02:41:46,349 --> 02:41:46,359
nuclear weapons but let's think about
 

8143
02:41:46,359 --> 02:41:49,349
nuclear weapons but let's think about
unintended consequences we've got rid

8144
02:41:49,349 --> 02:41:49,359
unintended consequences we've got rid
 

8145
02:41:49,359 --> 02:41:52,349
unintended consequences we've got rid
of such SEC we got rid of all the sulfur

8146
02:41:52,349 --> 02:41:52,359
of such SEC we got rid of all the sulfur
 

8147
02:41:52,359 --> 02:41:53,790
of such SEC we got rid of all the sulfur
particles in the atmosphere right all

8148
02:41:53,790 --> 02:41:53,800
particles in the atmosphere right all
 

8149
02:41:53,800 --> 02:41:55,950
particles in the atmosphere right all
the all the s and what's happened in the

8150
02:41:55,950 --> 02:41:55,960
the all the s and what's happened in the
 

8151
02:41:55,960 --> 02:41:57,230
the all the s and what's happened in the
last couple of years is global warming

8152
02:41:57,230 --> 02:41:57,240
last couple of years is global warming
 

8153
02:41:57,240 --> 02:41:58,670
last couple of years is global warming
has accelerated because we've cleaned up

8154
02:41:58,670 --> 02:41:58,680
has accelerated because we've cleaned up
 

8155
02:41:58,680 --> 02:42:00,870
has accelerated because we've cleaned up
the atmosphere too

8156
02:42:00,870 --> 02:42:00,880
the atmosphere too
 

8157
02:42:00,880 --> 02:42:03,870
the atmosphere too
much so sure I mean the same thing if

8158
02:42:03,870 --> 02:42:03,880
much so sure I mean the same thing if
 

8159
02:42:03,880 --> 02:42:05,070
much so sure I mean the same thing if
you get rid of nuclear weapons you're

8160
02:42:05,070 --> 02:42:05,080
you get rid of nuclear weapons you're
 

8161
02:42:05,080 --> 02:42:07,670
you get rid of nuclear weapons you're
going exactly that's my point is if so

8162
02:42:07,670 --> 02:42:07,680
going exactly that's my point is if so
 

8163
02:42:07,680 --> 02:42:09,550
going exactly that's my point is if so
what we could do is if we actually

8164
02:42:09,550 --> 02:42:09,560
what we could do is if we actually
 

8165
02:42:09,560 --> 02:42:11,870
what we could do is if we actually
started to put the AI in charge which is

8166
02:42:11,870 --> 02:42:11,880
started to put the AI in charge which is
 

8167
02:42:11,880 --> 02:42:14,510
started to put the AI in charge which is
I really like an AI to be in charge of

8168
02:42:14,510 --> 02:42:14,520
I really like an AI to be in charge of
 

8169
02:42:14,520 --> 02:42:16,389
I really like an AI to be in charge of
all world politics and this sounds

8170
02:42:16,389 --> 02:42:16,399
all world politics and this sounds
 

8171
02:42:16,399 --> 02:42:18,269
all world politics and this sounds
ridiculous for a second hang on but if

8172
02:42:18,269 --> 02:42:18,279
ridiculous for a second hang on but if
 

8173
02:42:18,279 --> 02:42:20,230
ridiculous for a second hang on but if
we could all agree on the the aers just

8174
02:42:20,230 --> 02:42:20,240
we could all agree on the the aers just
 

8175
02:42:20,240 --> 02:42:22,469
we could all agree on the the aers just
woke up yeah yeah yeah on that statement

8176
02:42:22,469 --> 02:42:22,479
woke up yeah yeah yeah on that statement
 

8177
02:42:22,479 --> 02:42:23,990
woke up yeah yeah yeah on that statement
but I really don't like politicians who

8178
02:42:23,990 --> 02:42:24,000
but I really don't like politicians who
 

8179
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:25,870
but I really don't like politicians who
are basically just looking at local

8180
02:42:25,870 --> 02:42:25,880
are basically just looking at local
 

8181
02:42:25,880 --> 02:42:27,630
are basically just looking at local
sampling but if you could say globally

8182
02:42:27,630 --> 02:42:27,640
sampling but if you could say globally
 

8183
02:42:27,640 --> 02:42:29,429
sampling but if you could say globally
look here's some gain Theory here

8184
02:42:29,429 --> 02:42:29,439
look here's some gain Theory here
 

8185
02:42:29,439 --> 02:42:30,990
look here's some gain Theory here
there's how what is the minimum number

8186
02:42:30,990 --> 02:42:31,000
there's how what is the minimum number
 

8187
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,389
there's how what is the minimum number
of nuclear weapons we need to distribute

8188
02:42:33,389 --> 02:42:33,399
of nuclear weapons we need to distribute
 

8189
02:42:33,399 --> 02:42:37,030
of nuclear weapons we need to distribute
around the N the world to everybody to

8190
02:42:37,030 --> 02:42:37,040
around the N the world to everybody to
 

8191
02:42:37,040 --> 02:42:40,309
around the N the world to everybody to
basically reduce War to zero I mean just

8192
02:42:40,309 --> 02:42:40,319
basically reduce War to zero I mean just
 

8193
02:42:40,319 --> 02:42:42,550
basically reduce War to zero I mean just
the Start experiment of the United

8194
02:42:42,550 --> 02:42:42,560
the Start experiment of the United
 

8195
02:42:42,560 --> 02:42:45,510
the Start experiment of the United
States and China and Russia and major

8196
02:42:45,510 --> 02:42:45,520
States and China and Russia and major
 

8197
02:42:45,520 --> 02:42:47,630
States and China and Russia and major
nuclear Powers get together and say all

8198
02:42:47,630 --> 02:42:47,640
nuclear Powers get together and say all
 

8199
02:42:47,640 --> 02:42:49,590
nuclear Powers get together and say all
right we're going to distribute nuclear

8200
02:42:49,590 --> 02:42:49,600
right we're going to distribute nuclear
 

8201
02:42:49,600 --> 02:42:54,150
right we're going to distribute nuclear
weapons every single nation on Earth

8202
02:42:54,150 --> 02:42:54,160
weapons every single nation on Earth
 

8203
02:42:54,160 --> 02:42:59,469
weapons every single nation on Earth
Yep oh boy I mean that has a probably

8204
02:42:59,469 --> 02:42:59,479
Yep oh boy I mean that has a probably
 

8205
02:42:59,479 --> 02:43:03,269
Yep oh boy I mean that has a probably
greater than 50% chance of eliminating

8206
02:43:03,269 --> 02:43:03,279
greater than 50% chance of eliminating
 

8207
02:43:03,279 --> 02:43:06,110
greater than 50% chance of eliminating
major military conflict yeah yeah but

8208
02:43:06,110 --> 02:43:06,120
major military conflict yeah yeah but
 

8209
02:43:06,120 --> 02:43:08,269
major military conflict yeah yeah but
it's not 100% but it but I don't think

8210
02:43:08,269 --> 02:43:08,279
it's not 100% but it but I don't think
 

8211
02:43:08,279 --> 02:43:11,070
it's not 100% but it but I don't think
anyone will use them because I think I

8212
02:43:11,070 --> 02:43:11,080
anyone will use them because I think I
 

8213
02:43:11,080 --> 02:43:12,269
anyone will use them because I think I
think and look what you've got to try

8214
02:43:12,269 --> 02:43:12,279
think and look what you've got to try
 

8215
02:43:12,279 --> 02:43:14,429
think and look what you've got to try
and do is like for to qualify for these

8216
02:43:14,429 --> 02:43:14,439
and do is like for to qualify for these
 

8217
02:43:14,439 --> 02:43:16,389
and do is like for to qualify for these
nuclear weapons

8218
02:43:16,389 --> 02:43:16,399
nuclear weapons
 

8219
02:43:16,399 --> 02:43:18,630
nuclear weapons
I this is a great idea the game theorist

8220
02:43:18,630 --> 02:43:18,640
I this is a great idea the game theorist
 

8221
02:43:18,640 --> 02:43:21,110
I this is a great idea the game theorist
could do this right I think the question

8222
02:43:21,110 --> 02:43:21,120
could do this right I think the question
 

8223
02:43:21,120 --> 02:43:22,990
could do this right I think the question
is this I I really buy your question we

8224
02:43:22,990 --> 02:43:23,000
is this I I really buy your question we
 

8225
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,910
is this I I really buy your question we
have too many nukes um from just from a

8226
02:43:25,910 --> 02:43:25,920
have too many nukes um from just from a
 

8227
02:43:25,920 --> 02:43:27,230
have too many nukes um from just from a
feeling point of view that we've got too

8228
02:43:27,230 --> 02:43:27,240
feeling point of view that we've got too
 

8229
02:43:27,240 --> 02:43:28,910
feeling point of view that we've got too
many of them so let's reduce the number

8230
02:43:28,910 --> 02:43:28,920
many of them so let's reduce the number
 

8231
02:43:28,920 --> 02:43:30,030
many of them so let's reduce the number
but not get rid of them because we'll

8232
02:43:30,030 --> 02:43:30,040
but not get rid of them because we'll
 

8233
02:43:30,040 --> 02:43:32,230
but not get rid of them because we'll
have too much conventional Warfare so

8234
02:43:32,230 --> 02:43:32,240
have too much conventional Warfare so
 

8235
02:43:32,240 --> 02:43:33,910
have too much conventional Warfare so
then what is the minimum number of

8236
02:43:33,910 --> 02:43:33,920
then what is the minimum number of
 

8237
02:43:33,920 --> 02:43:35,309
then what is the minimum number of
nuclear weapons we can just Shute around

8238
02:43:35,309 --> 02:43:35,319
nuclear weapons we can just Shute around
 

8239
02:43:35,319 --> 02:43:38,309
nuclear weapons we can just Shute around
to to remove what hum humans hurting

8240
02:43:38,309 --> 02:43:38,319
to to remove what hum humans hurting
 

8241
02:43:38,319 --> 02:43:40,670
to to remove what hum humans hurting
each other is something we should stop

8242
02:43:40,670 --> 02:43:40,680
each other is something we should stop
 

8243
02:43:40,680 --> 02:43:44,750
each other is something we should stop
doing it's in it's not out with our our

8244
02:43:44,750 --> 02:43:44,760
doing it's in it's not out with our our
 

8245
02:43:44,760 --> 02:43:46,990
doing it's in it's not out with our our
conceptual capability but right now what

8246
02:43:46,990 --> 02:43:47,000
conceptual capability but right now what
 

8247
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:48,910
conceptual capability but right now what
about the Nations certain nations are

8248
02:43:48,910 --> 02:43:48,920
about the Nations certain nations are
 

8249
02:43:48,920 --> 02:43:51,429
about the Nations certain nations are
being um exploited for their natural

8250
02:43:51,429 --> 02:43:51,439
being um exploited for their natural
 

8251
02:43:51,439 --> 02:43:53,670
being um exploited for their natural
resources in the future because for a

8252
02:43:53,670 --> 02:43:53,680
resources in the future because for a
 

8253
02:43:53,680 --> 02:43:55,030
resources in the future because for a
short-term gain because we don't want to

8254
02:43:55,030 --> 02:43:55,040
short-term gain because we don't want to
 

8255
02:43:55,040 --> 02:43:57,150
short-term gain because we don't want to
generate knowledge and and so if

8256
02:43:57,150 --> 02:43:57,160
generate knowledge and and so if
 

8257
02:43:57,160 --> 02:44:00,030
generate knowledge and and so if
everybody had an equal doomsday

8258
02:44:00,030 --> 02:44:00,040
everybody had an equal doomsday
 

8259
02:44:00,040 --> 02:44:02,830
everybody had an equal doomsday
switch I I predict the quality of life

8260
02:44:02,830 --> 02:44:02,840
switch I I predict the quality of life
 

8261
02:44:02,840 --> 02:44:05,710
switch I I predict the quality of life
average human will go up faster I am an

8262
02:44:05,710 --> 02:44:05,720
average human will go up faster I am an
 

8263
02:44:05,720 --> 02:44:07,670
average human will go up faster I am an
optimist and I believe that humanity is

8264
02:44:07,670 --> 02:44:07,680
optimist and I believe that humanity is
 

8265
02:44:07,680 --> 02:44:08,990
optimist and I believe that humanity is
going to get better and better and

8266
02:44:08,990 --> 02:44:09,000
going to get better and better and
 

8267
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:10,670
going to get better and better and
better that we're going to eliminate

8268
02:44:10,670 --> 02:44:10,680
better that we're going to eliminate
 

8269
02:44:10,680 --> 02:44:13,910
better that we're going to eliminate
more problems um but I think yeah let's

8270
02:44:13,910 --> 02:44:13,920
more problems um but I think yeah let's
 

8271
02:44:13,920 --> 02:44:16,349
more problems um but I think yeah let's
but uh the probability of a bad

8272
02:44:16,349 --> 02:44:16,359
but uh the probability of a bad
 

8273
02:44:16,359 --> 02:44:19,750
but uh the probability of a bad
actor of one of the Nations setting off

8274
02:44:19,750 --> 02:44:19,760
actor of one of the Nations setting off
 

8275
02:44:19,760 --> 02:44:21,630
actor of one of the Nations setting off
a nuclear

8276
02:44:21,630 --> 02:44:21,640
a nuclear
 

8277
02:44:21,640 --> 02:44:23,950
a nuclear
weapon I mean you have to you have to

8278
02:44:23,950 --> 02:44:23,960
weapon I mean you have to you have to
 

8279
02:44:23,960 --> 02:44:26,469
weapon I mean you have to you have to
integrate that into the but we we get we

8280
02:44:26,469 --> 02:44:26,479
integrate that into the but we we get we
 

8281
02:44:26,479 --> 02:44:28,830
integrate that into the but we we get we
distribute the N nukes like population

8282
02:44:28,830 --> 02:44:28,840
distribute the N nukes like population
 

8283
02:44:28,840 --> 02:44:32,309
distribute the N nukes like population
right we give what we do is we can't

8284
02:44:32,309 --> 02:44:32,319
right we give what we do is we can't
 

8285
02:44:32,319 --> 02:44:34,349
right we give what we do is we can't
believe but anyway let's let just go

8286
02:44:34,349 --> 02:44:34,359
believe but anyway let's let just go
 

8287
02:44:34,359 --> 02:44:36,750
believe but anyway let's let just go
there they say so if a if a small nation

8288
02:44:36,750 --> 02:44:36,760
there they say so if a if a small nation
 

8289
02:44:36,760 --> 02:44:38,269
there they say so if a if a small nation
with a couple of nukes uses one because

8290
02:44:38,269 --> 02:44:38,279
with a couple of nukes uses one because
 

8291
02:44:38,279 --> 02:44:40,469
with a couple of nukes uses one because
they're a bit bored or annoyed they're

8292
02:44:40,469 --> 02:44:40,479
they're a bit bored or annoyed they're
 

8293
02:44:40,479 --> 02:44:42,030
they're a bit bored or annoyed they're
going to they the likelihood that they

8294
02:44:42,030 --> 02:44:42,040
going to they the likelihood that they
 

8295
02:44:42,040 --> 02:44:43,110
going to they the likelihood that they
are going to be pummeled out of

8296
02:44:43,110 --> 02:44:43,120
are going to be pummeled out of
 

8297
02:44:43,120 --> 02:44:46,590
are going to be pummeled out of
existence immediately is 100% mhm and

8298
02:44:46,590 --> 02:44:46,600
existence immediately is 100% mhm and
 

8299
02:44:46,600 --> 02:44:48,190
existence immediately is 100% mhm and
yet they've only they've only nuked one

8300
02:44:48,190 --> 02:44:48,200
yet they've only they've only nuked one
 

8301
02:44:48,200 --> 02:44:50,269
yet they've only they've only nuked one
other city I know this is crazy and I

8302
02:44:50,269 --> 02:44:50,279
other city I know this is crazy and I
 

8303
02:44:50,279 --> 02:44:52,389
other city I know this is crazy and I
apologize for well no no I think this

8304
02:44:52,389 --> 02:44:52,399
apologize for well no no I think this
 

8305
02:44:52,399 --> 02:44:54,070
apologize for well no no I think this
just to be clear we're just having a

8306
02:44:54,070 --> 02:44:54,080
just to be clear we're just having a
 

8307
02:44:54,080 --> 02:44:55,950
just to be clear we're just having a
thought experiment that's interesting

8308
02:44:55,950 --> 02:44:55,960
thought experiment that's interesting
 

8309
02:44:55,960 --> 02:44:57,910
thought experiment that's interesting
but you know there's terrorist

8310
02:44:57,910 --> 02:44:57,920
but you know there's terrorist
 

8311
02:44:57,920 --> 02:45:01,110
but you know there's terrorist
organizations that would take that would

8312
02:45:01,110 --> 02:45:01,120
organizations that would take that would
 

8313
02:45:01,120 --> 02:45:04,510
organizations that would take that would
take would take that trade yeah I mean

8314
02:45:04,510 --> 02:45:04,520
take would take that trade yeah I mean
 

8315
02:45:04,520 --> 02:45:06,309
take would take that trade yeah I mean
we have to ask ourselves a question of

8316
02:45:06,309 --> 02:45:06,319
we have to ask ourselves a question of
 

8317
02:45:06,319 --> 02:45:09,429
we have to ask ourselves a question of
how many Which percentage of humans

8318
02:45:09,429 --> 02:45:09,439
how many Which percentage of humans
 

8319
02:45:09,439 --> 02:45:11,870
how many Which percentage of humans
would be suicide bombers essentially

8320
02:45:11,870 --> 02:45:11,880
would be suicide bombers essentially
 

8321
02:45:11,880 --> 02:45:13,389
would be suicide bombers essentially
where where they would sacrifice their

8322
02:45:13,389 --> 02:45:13,399
where where they would sacrifice their
 

8323
02:45:13,399 --> 02:45:16,830
where where they would sacrifice their
own life to to uh because they hate

8324
02:45:16,830 --> 02:45:16,840
own life to to uh because they hate
 

8325
02:45:16,840 --> 02:45:19,190
own life to to uh because they hate
another group of people and that I

8326
02:45:19,190 --> 02:45:19,200
another group of people and that I
 

8327
02:45:19,200 --> 02:45:21,070
another group of people and that I
believe it's a very small fraction but

8328
02:45:21,070 --> 02:45:21,080
believe it's a very small fraction but
 

8329
02:45:21,080 --> 02:45:23,870
believe it's a very small fraction but
is it large enough to uh if you give our

8330
02:45:23,870 --> 02:45:23,880
is it large enough to uh if you give our
 

8331
02:45:23,880 --> 02:45:25,990
is it large enough to uh if you give our
nuclear weapons I can predict a future

8332
02:45:25,990 --> 02:45:26,000
nuclear weapons I can predict a future
 

8333
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:27,590
nuclear weapons I can predict a future
where we take all nuclear material and

8334
02:45:27,590 --> 02:45:27,600
where we take all nuclear material and
 

8335
02:45:27,600 --> 02:45:29,469
where we take all nuclear material and
we burn it for energy right as because

8336
02:45:29,469 --> 02:45:29,479
we burn it for energy right as because
 

8337
02:45:29,479 --> 02:45:30,510
we burn it for energy right as because
we're getting there and the other thing

8338
02:45:30,510 --> 02:45:30,520
we're getting there and the other thing
 

8339
02:45:30,520 --> 02:45:33,429
we're getting there and the other thing
you could do is say look there's a gap

8340
02:45:33,429 --> 02:45:33,439
you could do is say look there's a gap
 

8341
02:45:33,439 --> 02:45:34,790
you could do is say look there's a gap
so if we get all the countries to sign

8342
02:45:34,790 --> 02:45:34,800
so if we get all the countries to sign
 

8343
02:45:34,800 --> 02:45:36,349
so if we get all the countries to sign
up to the virtual nuclear agreement

8344
02:45:36,349 --> 02:45:36,359
up to the virtual nuclear agreement
 

8345
02:45:36,359 --> 02:45:38,389
up to the virtual nuclear agreement
where we all exist we have a simulation

8346
02:45:38,389 --> 02:45:38,399
where we all exist we have a simulation
 

8347
02:45:38,399 --> 02:45:39,429
where we all exist we have a simulation
where we can nuke each other in the

8348
02:45:39,429 --> 02:45:39,439
where we can nuke each other in the
 

8349
02:45:39,439 --> 02:45:41,309
where we can nuke each other in the
simulation and the and the economic

8350
02:45:41,309 --> 02:45:41,319
simulation and the and the economic
 

8351
02:45:41,319 --> 02:45:42,670
simulation and the and the economic
consequences are

8352
02:45:42,670 --> 02:45:42,680
consequences are
 

8353
02:45:42,680 --> 02:45:45,190
consequences are
catastrophic sure in the simulation I

8354
02:45:45,190 --> 02:45:45,200
catastrophic sure in the simulation I
 

8355
02:45:45,200 --> 02:45:46,429
catastrophic sure in the simulation I
love it it's not going to kill all

8356
02:45:46,429 --> 02:45:46,439
love it it's not going to kill all
 

8357
02:45:46,439 --> 02:45:48,750
love it it's not going to kill all
humans it's just going to have economic

8358
02:45:48,750 --> 02:45:48,760
humans it's just going to have economic
 

8359
02:45:48,760 --> 02:45:50,830
humans it's just going to have economic
conse I don't know I just made it up it

8360
02:45:50,830 --> 02:45:50,840
conse I don't know I just made it up it
 

8361
02:45:50,840 --> 02:45:52,550
conse I don't know I just made it up it
seems like it's interesting I mean it's

8362
02:45:52,550 --> 02:45:52,560
seems like it's interesting I mean it's
 

8363
02:45:52,560 --> 02:45:54,150
seems like it's interesting I mean it's
but it's interesting whether that would

8364
02:45:54,150 --> 02:45:54,160
but it's interesting whether that would
 

8365
02:45:54,160 --> 02:45:56,830
but it's interesting whether that would
have as much power on human psychology

8366
02:45:56,830 --> 02:45:56,840
have as much power on human psychology
 

8367
02:45:56,840 --> 02:46:00,230
have as much power on human psychology
as actual physical nuclear exp think so

8368
02:46:00,230 --> 02:46:00,240
as actual physical nuclear exp think so
 

8369
02:46:00,240 --> 02:46:01,870
as actual physical nuclear exp think so
it's possible but people don't take

8370
02:46:01,870 --> 02:46:01,880
it's possible but people don't take
 

8371
02:46:01,880 --> 02:46:03,830
it's possible but people don't take
Economic Consequences as seriously I

8372
02:46:03,830 --> 02:46:03,840
Economic Consequences as seriously I
 

8373
02:46:03,840 --> 02:46:07,670
Economic Consequences as seriously I
think as actual nuclear weapons I think

8374
02:46:07,670 --> 02:46:07,680
think as actual nuclear weapons I think
 

8375
02:46:07,680 --> 02:46:10,469
think as actual nuclear weapons I think
they do in Argentina and they do in

8376
02:46:10,469 --> 02:46:10,479
they do in Argentina and they do in
 

8377
02:46:10,479 --> 02:46:12,429
they do in Argentina and they do in
Somalia and they do in a lot of these

8378
02:46:12,429 --> 02:46:12,439
Somalia and they do in a lot of these
 

8379
02:46:12,439 --> 02:46:14,550
Somalia and they do in a lot of these
places where no I I think this is a

8380
02:46:14,550 --> 02:46:14,560
places where no I I think this is a
 

8381
02:46:14,560 --> 02:46:16,750
places where no I I think this is a
great idea I'm a strong Advocate now for

8382
02:46:16,750 --> 02:46:16,760
great idea I'm a strong Advocate now for
 

8383
02:46:16,760 --> 02:46:18,070
great idea I'm a strong Advocate now for
so what have we come up with burning

8384
02:46:18,070 --> 02:46:18,080
so what have we come up with burning
 

8385
02:46:18,080 --> 02:46:19,670
so what have we come up with burning
burning all the nuclear material to have

8386
02:46:19,670 --> 02:46:19,680
burning all the nuclear material to have
 

8387
02:46:19,680 --> 02:46:22,269
burning all the nuclear material to have
energy and before we do that because mad

8388
02:46:22,269 --> 02:46:22,279
energy and before we do that because mad
 

8389
02:46:22,279 --> 02:46:24,710
energy and before we do that because mad
is good mutually assured destruction is

8390
02:46:24,710 --> 02:46:24,720
is good mutually assured destruction is
 

8391
02:46:24,720 --> 02:46:27,070
is good mutually assured destruction is
very powerful let's take it into the

8392
02:46:27,070 --> 02:46:27,080
very powerful let's take it into the
 

8393
02:46:27,080 --> 02:46:30,349
very powerful let's take it into the
metaverse and then get people to kind of

8394
02:46:30,349 --> 02:46:30,359
metaverse and then get people to kind of
 

8395
02:46:30,359 --> 02:46:32,670
metaverse and then get people to kind of
um uh subscribe to that and if they

8396
02:46:32,670 --> 02:46:32,680
um uh subscribe to that and if they
 

8397
02:46:32,680 --> 02:46:34,230
um uh subscribe to that and if they
actually nuke each other even for fun in

8398
02:46:34,230 --> 02:46:34,240
actually nuke each other even for fun in
 

8399
02:46:34,240 --> 02:46:35,590
actually nuke each other even for fun in
the metaverse there are dire

8400
02:46:35,590 --> 02:46:35,600
the metaverse there are dire
 

8401
02:46:35,600 --> 02:46:38,309
the metaverse there are dire
consequences yeah yeah so it's like a

8402
02:46:38,309 --> 02:46:38,319
consequences yeah yeah so it's like a
 

8403
02:46:38,319 --> 02:46:40,710
consequences yeah yeah so it's like a
video game we all to join this metaverse

8404
02:46:40,710 --> 02:46:40,720
video game we all to join this metaverse
 

8405
02:46:40,720 --> 02:46:44,190
video game we all to join this metaverse
video game yeah I can't dire economic

8406
02:46:44,190 --> 02:46:44,200
video game yeah I can't dire economic
 

8407
02:46:44,200 --> 02:46:46,630
video game yeah I can't dire economic
consequences I don't know how and uh

8408
02:46:46,630 --> 02:46:46,640
consequences I don't know how and uh
 

8409
02:46:46,640 --> 02:46:48,990
consequences I don't know how and uh
it's all run by AI as you mentioned

8410
02:46:48,990 --> 02:46:49,000
it's all run by AI as you mentioned
 

8411
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:50,990
it's all run by AI as you mentioned
which so the AI doomers is are really

8412
02:46:50,990 --> 02:46:51,000
which so the AI doomers is are really
 

8413
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:52,950
which so the AI doomers is are really
terrified at this point no they're happy

8414
02:46:52,950 --> 02:46:52,960
terrified at this point no they're happy
 

8415
02:46:52,960 --> 02:46:54,670
terrified at this point no they're happy
they have a job for another 20 years

8416
02:46:54,670 --> 02:46:54,680
they have a job for another 20 years
 

8417
02:46:54,680 --> 02:46:57,870
they have a job for another 20 years
right oh you're mry yeah yeah yeah we

got I'm a Believer in equal employment

8420
02:47:00,630 --> 02:47:00,640
got I'm a Believer in equal employment
 

8421
02:47:00,640 --> 02:47:01,630
got I'm a Believer in equal employment
you've

8422
02:47:01,630 --> 02:47:01,640
you've
 

8423
02:47:01,640 --> 02:47:04,750
you've
mentioned that uh what you

8424
02:47:04,750 --> 02:47:04,760
mentioned that uh what you
 

8425
02:47:04,760 --> 02:47:08,190
mentioned that uh what you
call K makina yeah yeah so you've

8426
02:47:08,190 --> 02:47:08,200
call K makina yeah yeah so you've
 

8427
02:47:08,200 --> 02:47:10,790
call K makina yeah yeah so you've
mentioned that uh a chemical brain is

8428
02:47:10,790 --> 02:47:10,800
mentioned that uh a chemical brain is
 

8429
02:47:10,800 --> 02:47:13,070
mentioned that uh a chemical brain is
something you're interesting

8430
02:47:13,070 --> 02:47:13,080
something you're interesting
 

8431
02:47:13,080 --> 02:47:15,630
something you're interesting
creating and uh

8432
02:47:15,630 --> 02:47:15,640
creating and uh
 

8433
02:47:15,640 --> 02:47:18,790
creating and uh
that's a way to get conscious AI

8434
02:47:18,790 --> 02:47:18,800
that's a way to get conscious AI
 

8435
02:47:18,800 --> 02:47:20,910
that's a way to get conscious AI
soon can you explain what a chemical

8436
02:47:20,910 --> 02:47:20,920
soon can you explain what a chemical
 

8437
02:47:20,920 --> 02:47:23,110
soon can you explain what a chemical
brain is I want to understand the

8438
02:47:23,110 --> 02:47:23,120
brain is I want to understand the
 

8439
02:47:23,120 --> 02:47:24,590
brain is I want to understand the
mechanism of intelligence has gone

8440
02:47:24,590 --> 02:47:24,600
mechanism of intelligence has gone
 

8441
02:47:24,600 --> 02:47:26,469
mechanism of intelligence has gone
through Evolution right because the way

8442
02:47:26,469 --> 02:47:26,479
through Evolution right because the way
 

8443
02:47:26,479 --> 02:47:30,030
through Evolution right because the way
that the way that um intelligence was

8444
02:47:30,030 --> 02:47:30,040
that the way that um intelligence was
 

8445
02:47:30,040 --> 02:47:32,389
that the way that um intelligence was
produced by Evolution appears to be the

8446
02:47:32,389 --> 02:47:32,399
produced by Evolution appears to be the
 

8447
02:47:32,399 --> 02:47:35,510
produced by Evolution appears to be the
following origin of Life

8448
02:47:35,510 --> 02:47:35,520
following origin of Life
 

8449
02:47:35,520 --> 02:47:37,150
following origin of Life
multicellularity

8450
02:47:37,150 --> 02:47:37,160
multicellularity
 

8451
02:47:37,160 --> 02:47:40,150
multicellularity
Locomotion senses once you can start to

8452
02:47:40,150 --> 02:47:40,160
Locomotion senses once you can start to
 

8453
02:47:40,160 --> 02:47:44,150
Locomotion senses once you can start to
see things come coming toward you and

8454
02:47:44,150 --> 02:47:44,160
see things come coming toward you and
 

8455
02:47:44,160 --> 02:47:45,950
see things come coming toward you and
you can remember the the past and

8456
02:47:45,950 --> 02:47:45,960
you can remember the the past and
 

8457
02:47:45,960 --> 02:47:47,469
you can remember the the past and
interrogate the present and imagine the

8458
02:47:47,469 --> 02:47:47,479
interrogate the present and imagine the
 

8459
02:47:47,479 --> 02:47:49,870
interrogate the present and imagine the
future you can do something amazing

8460
02:47:49,870 --> 02:47:49,880
future you can do something amazing
 

8461
02:47:49,880 --> 02:47:52,030
future you can do something amazing
right so and I think only in recent

8462
02:47:52,030 --> 02:47:52,040
right so and I think only in recent
 

8463
02:47:52,040 --> 02:47:54,750
right so and I think only in recent
years did humans become Che

8464
02:47:54,750 --> 02:47:54,760
years did humans become Che
 

8465
02:47:54,760 --> 02:47:56,870
years did humans become Che
incomplete right

8466
02:47:56,870 --> 02:47:56,880
incomplete right
 

8467
02:47:56,880 --> 02:47:59,830
incomplete right
yeah yeah right we'll go and so that Che

8468
02:47:59,830 --> 02:47:59,840
yeah yeah right we'll go and so that Che
 

8469
02:47:59,840 --> 02:48:01,710
yeah yeah right we'll go and so that Che
incompleteness kind of gave us another

8470
02:48:01,710 --> 02:48:01,720
incompleteness kind of gave us another
 

8471
02:48:01,720 --> 02:48:05,830
incompleteness kind of gave us another
kick up um but our ability to process

8472
02:48:05,830 --> 02:48:05,840
kick up um but our ability to process
 

8473
02:48:05,840 --> 02:48:07,230
kick up um but our ability to process
that

8474
02:48:07,230 --> 02:48:07,240
that
 

8475
02:48:07,240 --> 02:48:10,309
that
information um is produced in a wet

8476
02:48:10,309 --> 02:48:10,319
information um is produced in a wet
 

8477
02:48:10,319 --> 02:48:14,510
information um is produced in a wet
brain and and I think that we are not

8478
02:48:14,510 --> 02:48:14,520
brain and and I think that we are not
 

8479
02:48:14,520 --> 02:48:16,070
brain and and I think that we are not
getting going to we do not have the

8480
02:48:16,070 --> 02:48:16,080
getting going to we do not have the
 

8481
02:48:16,080 --> 02:48:18,790
getting going to we do not have the
correct Hardware architectures to have

8482
02:48:18,790 --> 02:48:18,800
correct Hardware architectures to have
 

8483
02:48:18,800 --> 02:48:21,990
correct Hardware architectures to have
the domain flexibility and the inte or

8484
02:48:21,990 --> 02:48:22,000
the domain flexibility and the inte or
 

8485
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:23,950
the domain flexibility and the inte or
the ability to integrate information and

8486
02:48:23,950 --> 02:48:23,960
the ability to integrate information and
 

8487
02:48:23,960 --> 02:48:25,030
the ability to integrate information and
I think

8488
02:48:25,030 --> 02:48:25,040
I think
 

8489
02:48:25,040 --> 02:48:27,910
I think
intelligence um also comes at a massive

8490
02:48:27,910 --> 02:48:27,920
intelligence um also comes at a massive
 

8491
02:48:27,920 --> 02:48:30,950
intelligence um also comes at a massive
compromise of data right now we're

8492
02:48:30,950 --> 02:48:30,960
compromise of data right now we're
 

8493
02:48:30,960 --> 02:48:32,389
compromise of data right now we're
obsessing about getting more and more

8494
02:48:32,389 --> 02:48:32,399
obsessing about getting more and more
 

8495
02:48:32,399 --> 02:48:33,990
obsessing about getting more and more
data more and more processing more and

8496
02:48:33,990 --> 02:48:34,000
data more and more processing more and
 

8497
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:36,950
data more and more processing more and
more tricks to get dopamine hits so

8498
02:48:36,950 --> 02:48:36,960
more tricks to get dopamine hits so
 

8499
02:48:36,960 --> 02:48:39,389
more tricks to get dopamine hits so
we're going to when we look back on this

8500
02:48:39,389 --> 02:48:39,399
we're going to when we look back on this
 

8501
02:48:39,399 --> 02:48:41,030
we're going to when we look back on this
going oh yeah that was really cool cuz

8502
02:48:41,030 --> 02:48:41,040
going oh yeah that was really cool cuz
 

8503
02:48:41,040 --> 02:48:43,950
going oh yeah that was really cool cuz
when I chat as chat GPT it made me it

8504
02:48:43,950 --> 02:48:43,960
when I chat as chat GPT it made me it
 

8505
02:48:43,960 --> 02:48:47,150
when I chat as chat GPT it made me it
made me really feel really happy MH I

made me really feel really happy MH I
 

8507
02:48:47,160 --> 02:48:49,429
made me really feel really happy MH I
got a hit from it but actually it just

8508
02:48:49,429 --> 02:48:49,439
got a hit from it but actually it just
 

8509
02:48:49,439 --> 02:48:53,950
got a hit from it but actually it just
exposed how little intelligence I use in

8510
02:48:53,950 --> 02:48:53,960
exposed how little intelligence I use in
 

8511
02:48:53,960 --> 02:48:55,750
exposed how little intelligence I use in
in every

8512
02:48:55,750 --> 02:48:55,760
in every
 

8513
02:48:55,760 --> 02:48:58,870
in every
moment because I'm easily fooled so what

8514
02:48:58,870 --> 02:48:58,880
moment because I'm easily fooled so what
 

8515
02:48:58,880 --> 02:49:01,110
moment because I'm easily fooled so what
I would like to do is to say well hey

8516
02:49:01,110 --> 02:49:01,120
I would like to do is to say well hey
 

8517
02:49:01,120 --> 02:49:03,429
I would like to do is to say well hey
hang on what is it about the brain so

8518
02:49:03,429 --> 02:49:03,439
hang on what is it about the brain so
 

8519
02:49:03,439 --> 02:49:05,349
hang on what is it about the brain so
the brain has this incredible

8520
02:49:05,349 --> 02:49:05,359
the brain has this incredible
 

8521
02:49:05,359 --> 02:49:08,550
the brain has this incredible
connectivity and it has the ability to

um you know as I said earlier about my

8524
02:49:11,269 --> 02:49:11,279
um you know as I said earlier about my
 

8525
02:49:11,279 --> 02:49:13,950
um you know as I said earlier about my
nephew you know I just I went from Bill

8526
02:49:13,950 --> 02:49:13,960
nephew you know I just I went from Bill
 

8527
02:49:13,960 --> 02:49:15,630
nephew you know I just I went from Bill
to Billy and he went home right Leroy

8528
02:49:15,630 --> 02:49:15,640
to Billy and he went home right Leroy
 

8529
02:49:15,640 --> 02:49:18,110
to Billy and he went home right Leroy
like how did he make that leap that he

8530
02:49:18,110 --> 02:49:18,120
like how did he make that leap that he
 

8531
02:49:18,120 --> 02:49:19,830
like how did he make that leap that he
was able to basically without any

8532
02:49:19,830 --> 02:49:19,840
was able to basically without any
 

8533
02:49:19,840 --> 02:49:22,550
was able to basically without any
training I extended his name he went G

8534
02:49:22,550 --> 02:49:22,560
training I extended his name he went G
 

8535
02:49:22,560 --> 02:49:23,870

basically you know the farmer is feeding

8580
02:50:19,150 --> 02:50:19,160
basically you know the farmer is feeding
 

8581
02:50:19,160 --> 02:50:20,710
basically you know the farmer is feeding
the chicken every day and the chicken's

8582
02:50:20,710 --> 02:50:20,720
the chicken every day and the chicken's
 

8583
02:50:20,720 --> 02:50:22,670
the chicken every day and the chicken's
getting fat and happy and chicken's like

8584
02:50:22,670 --> 02:50:22,680
getting fat and happy and chicken's like
 

8585
02:50:22,680 --> 02:50:24,229
getting fat and happy and chicken's like
I'm really happy every time the farmer

8586
02:50:24,229 --> 02:50:24,239
I'm really happy every time the farmer
 

8587
02:50:24,239 --> 02:50:25,670
I'm really happy every time the farmer
comes in and feeds me and then one day

8588
02:50:25,670 --> 02:50:25,680
comes in and feeds me and then one day
 

8589
02:50:25,680 --> 02:50:28,070
comes in and feeds me and then one day
the farmer comes in and doesn't instead

8590
02:50:28,070 --> 02:50:28,080
the farmer comes in and doesn't instead
 

8591
02:50:28,080 --> 02:50:30,389
the farmer comes in and doesn't instead
of feeding the chicken just Rings its

8592
02:50:30,389 --> 02:50:30,399
of feeding the chicken just Rings its
 

8593
02:50:30,399 --> 02:50:33,229
of feeding the chicken just Rings its
neck you know and that's kind of and had

8594
02:50:33,229 --> 02:50:33,239
neck you know and that's kind of and had
 

8595
02:50:33,239 --> 02:50:34,870
neck you know and that's kind of and had
the chicken had an alternative

8596
02:50:34,870 --> 02:50:34,880
the chicken had an alternative
 

8597
02:50:34,880 --> 02:50:36,150
the chicken had an alternative
understanding of why the farmer was

8598
02:50:36,150 --> 02:50:36,160
understanding of why the farmer was
 

8599
02:50:36,160 --> 02:50:38,990
understanding of why the farmer was
feeding it it's interesting though

8600
02:50:38,990 --> 02:50:39,000
feeding it it's interesting though
 

8601
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:40,790
feeding it it's interesting though
because we don't know what's special

8602

02:50:42,200 --> 02:50:43,429
about the human mind that's able to come
up with these kind of

02:50:43,429 --> 02:50:43,439
up with these kind of
 

8607
02:50:43,439 --> 02:50:45,790
up with these kind of
generalities uh this Universal theories

8608
02:50:45,790 --> 02:50:45,800
generalities uh this Universal theories

of things and come up with novelty I can

8610
02:50:49,070 --> 02:50:49,080
of things and come up with novelty I can
 

8611
02:50:49,080 --> 02:50:51,150
of things and come up with novelty I can
imagine because you gave an example you

8612
02:50:51,150 --> 02:50:51,160
imagine because you gave an example you
 

8613
02:50:51,160 --> 02:50:55,590
imagine because you gave an example you
you know about William and Leroy

8614
02:50:55,590 --> 02:50:55,600
you know about William and Leroy
 

8615
02:50:55,600 --> 02:50:58,469
you know about William and Leroy
I I feel

8616
02:50:58,469 --> 02:50:58,479
I I feel
 

8617
02:50:58,479 --> 02:51:02,070
I I feel
like example like that we'll be able to

8618
02:51:02,070 --> 02:51:02,080
like example like that we'll be able to
 

8619
02:51:02,080 --> 02:51:05,190
like example like that we'll be able to
see in future versions of large language

8620
02:51:05,190 --> 02:51:05,200
see in future versions of large language
 

8621
02:51:05,200 --> 02:51:07,349

impressed by the humor the

8624
02:51:12,110 --> 02:51:12,120
impressed by the humor the
 

8625
02:51:12,120 --> 02:51:14,670
impressed by the humor the
insights all of it because it's

8626
02:51:14,670 --> 02:51:14,680
insights all of it because it's
 

8627
02:51:14,680 --> 02:51:16,309
insights all of it because it's
fundamentally trained on all the

8628
02:51:16,309 --> 02:51:16,319
fundamentally trained on all the
 

8629
02:51:16,319 --> 02:51:17,950

incredible humor and insights that's

8630
02:51:17,950 --> 02:51:17,960
incredible humor and insights that's
 

8631
02:51:17,960 --> 02:51:19,550
incredible humor and insights that's
available out there on the internet

02:51:19,550 --> 02:51:19,560
available out there on the internet
 

8633
02:51:19,560 --> 02:51:21,150
available out there on the internet
right so we'll be impressed I think

8634
02:51:21,150 --> 02:51:21,160
right so we'll be impressed I think
 

8635
02:51:21,160 --> 02:51:24,469
right so we'll be impressed I think
we'll be impressed oh I'm impressed

8636
02:51:24,469 --> 02:51:24,479
we'll be impressed oh I'm impressed
 

8637
02:51:24,479 --> 02:51:26,590
we'll be impressed oh I'm impressed
right I'm impressed increasingly so but

8638
02:51:26,590 --> 02:51:26,600
right I'm impressed increasingly so but
 

8639
02:51:26,600 --> 02:51:29,030
right I'm impressed increasingly so but
we're mining the past yes and what the

02:51:29,030 --> 02:51:29,040
we're mining the past yes and what the
 

8641
02:51:29,040 --> 02:51:30,630
we're mining the past yes and what the
human brain appears to be able to do is

8642
02:51:30,630 --> 02:51:30,640
human brain appears to be able to do is
 

8643
02:51:30,640 --> 02:51:34,429
human brain appears to be able to do is
mind the future yes so novelty it is

8644
02:51:34,429 --> 02:51:34,439
mind the future yes so novelty it is
 

8645
02:51:34,439 --> 02:51:37,429
mind the future yes so novelty it is
interesting whether these large language

02:51:37,429 --> 02:51:37,439
interesting whether these large language
 

8647
02:51:37,439 --> 02:51:39,990
interesting whether these large language

02:51:41,670 --> 02:51:41,680
something truly novel I can show on the
 

8651
02:51:41,680 --> 02:51:43,030
something truly novel I can show on the
back of a piece of paper why that's

8652
02:51:43,030 --> 02:51:43,040
back of a piece of paper why that's
 

8653
02:51:43,040 --> 02:51:45,229
back of a piece of paper why that's
impossible and it's like the problem is

02:51:45,229 --> 02:51:45,239
impossible and it's like the problem is

02:51:47,760 --> 02:51:52,030
that and again these are domain experts
kind of bullshitting each other the term

02:51:52,030 --> 02:51:52,040
kind of bullshitting each other the term

02:52:13,040 --> 02:52:14,910
will start to Guess that that it never
will produce anything out with the data

8678
02:52:14,910 --> 02:52:14,920
will produce anything out with the data
 

8679
02:52:14,920 --> 02:52:17,150
will produce anything out with the data
set because you mind the past the thing

8680
02:52:17,150 --> 02:52:17,160
set because you mind the past the thing
 

8681
02:52:17,160 --> 02:52:18,670
set because you mind the past the thing
that I'm getting to is I think that

8682
02:52:18,670 --> 02:52:18,680
that I'm getting to is I think that
 

8683
02:52:18,680 --> 02:52:20,670
that I'm getting to is I think that
actually current machine learning

8684
02:52:20,670 --> 02:52:20,680
actually current machine learning
 

8685
02:52:20,680 --> 02:52:22,590
actually current machine learning
Technologies might actually help reveal

8686
02:52:22,590 --> 02:52:22,600
Technologies might actually help reveal
 

8687
02:52:22,600 --> 02:52:24,309
Technologies might actually help reveal
why time is fundamental it's like kind

8688
02:52:24,309 --> 02:52:24,319
why time is fundamental it's like kind
 

8689
02:52:24,319 --> 02:52:26,990
why time is fundamental it's like kind
of insane because they tell you about

8690
02:52:26,990 --> 02:52:27,000
of insane because they tell you about
 

8691
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:29,030
of insane because they tell you about
what's happened in the past but they can

8692
02:52:29,030 --> 02:52:29,040
what's happened in the past but they can
 

8693
02:52:29,040 --> 02:52:30,229
what's happened in the past but they can
never help you understand what's

8694
02:52:30,229 --> 02:52:30,239
never help you understand what's
 

8695
02:52:30,239 --> 02:52:33,309
never help you understand what's
happening in the future without training

8696
02:52:33,309 --> 02:52:33,319
happening in the future without training
 

8697
02:52:33,319 --> 02:52:36,190
happening in the future without training
examples sure if that thing happens

8698
02:52:36,190 --> 02:52:36,200
examples sure if that thing happens
 

8699
02:52:36,200 --> 02:52:39,830
examples sure if that thing happens
again it's like um so I think so let's

8700
02:52:39,830 --> 02:52:39,840
again it's like um so I think so let's
 

8701
02:52:39,840 --> 02:52:41,229
again it's like um so I think so let's
think about what large language models

8702
02:52:41,229 --> 02:52:41,239
think about what large language models
 

8703
02:52:41,239 --> 02:52:44,190
think about what large language models
are doing we have the we have the Lang

8704
02:52:44,190 --> 02:52:44,200
are doing we have the we have the Lang
 

8705
02:52:44,200 --> 02:52:45,630
are doing we have the we have the Lang
we have all the internet as we know it

8706
02:52:45,630 --> 02:52:45,640
we have all the internet as we know it
 

8707
02:52:45,640 --> 02:52:47,389
we have all the internet as we know it
you know language but also they're doing

8708
02:52:47,389 --> 02:52:47,399
you know language but also they're doing
 

8709
02:52:47,399 --> 02:52:49,750
you know language but also they're doing
something else we're having human beings

8710
02:52:49,750 --> 02:52:49,760
something else we're having human beings
 

8711
02:52:49,760 --> 02:52:52,229
something else we're having human beings
correcting it all the time those models

8712
02:52:52,229 --> 02:52:52,239
correcting it all the time those models
 

8713
02:52:52,239 --> 02:52:55,309
correcting it all the time those models
are being corrected um

8714
02:52:55,309 --> 02:52:55,319
are being corrected um
 

8715
02:52:55,319 --> 02:52:58,110
are being corrected um
steered

8716
02:52:58,110 --> 02:52:58,120
steered
 

8717
02:52:58,120 --> 02:53:02,150
steered
corrected modified tweaked is well yeah

8718
02:53:02,150 --> 02:53:02,160
corrected modified tweaked is well yeah
 

8719
02:53:02,160 --> 02:53:03,309
corrected modified tweaked is well yeah
but I mean

8720
02:53:03,309 --> 02:53:03,319
but I mean
 

8721
02:53:03,319 --> 02:53:05,229
but I mean
cheating well you could say that

8722
02:53:05,229 --> 02:53:05,239
cheating well you could say that
 

8723
02:53:05,239 --> 02:53:07,229
cheating well you could say that
training on human data in the first

8724
02:53:07,229 --> 02:53:07,239
training on human data in the first
 

8725
02:53:07,239 --> 02:53:09,070
training on human data in the first
place is cheating well let me human is

8726
02:53:09,070 --> 02:53:09,080
place is cheating well let me human is
 

8727
02:53:09,080 --> 02:53:10,830
place is cheating well let me human is
in the loop sorry it's in yes so human

8728
02:53:10,830 --> 02:53:10,840
in the loop sorry it's in yes so human
 

8729
02:53:10,840 --> 02:53:12,309
in the loop sorry it's in yes so human
is definitely in the

8730
02:53:12,309 --> 02:53:12,319
is definitely in the
 

8731
02:53:12,319 --> 02:53:15,389
is definitely in the
loop uh but it's not just human is in

8732
02:53:15,389 --> 02:53:15,399
loop uh but it's not just human is in
 

8733
02:53:15,399 --> 02:53:18,870
loop uh but it's not just human is in
the loop a very large collection of

8734
02:53:18,870 --> 02:53:18,880
the loop a very large collection of
 

8735
02:53:18,880 --> 02:53:21,429
the loop a very large collection of
humans is in the loop look turn and that

8736
02:53:21,429 --> 02:53:21,439
humans is in the loop look turn and that
 

8737
02:53:21,439 --> 02:53:22,750
humans is in the loop look turn and that
could

8738
02:53:22,750 --> 02:53:22,760
could
 

8739
02:53:22,760 --> 02:53:25,349
could
be I mean to me it's not intuitive that

8740
02:53:25,349 --> 02:53:25,359
be I mean to me it's not intuitive that
 

8741
02:53:25,359 --> 02:53:27,510
be I mean to me it's not intuitive that
you said prime numbers that the system

8742
02:53:27,510 --> 02:53:27,520
you said prime numbers that the system
 

8743
02:53:27,520 --> 02:53:28,950
you said prime numbers that the system
can't generate an

8744
02:53:28,950 --> 02:53:28,960
can't generate an
 

8745
02:53:28,960 --> 02:53:31,429
can't generate an
algorithm right

8746
02:53:31,429 --> 02:53:31,439
algorithm right
 

8747
02:53:31,439 --> 02:53:34,030
algorithm right
that the algorithm that can generate

8748
02:53:34,030 --> 02:53:34,040
that the algorithm that can generate
 

8749
02:53:34,040 --> 02:53:35,950
that the algorithm that can generate
prime numbers or the algorithm that can

8750
02:53:35,950 --> 02:53:35,960
prime numbers or the algorithm that can
 

8751
02:53:35,960 --> 02:53:37,710
prime numbers or the algorithm that can
tell you if a number is prime and so on

8752
02:53:37,710 --> 02:53:37,720
tell you if a number is prime and so on
 

8753
02:53:37,720 --> 02:53:39,630
tell you if a number is prime and so on
and generate algorithms that generate

8754
02:53:39,630 --> 02:53:39,640
and generate algorithms that generate
 

8755
02:53:39,640 --> 02:53:42,429
and generate algorithms that generate
algorithms that generate algorithms that

8756
02:53:42,429 --> 02:53:42,439
algorithms that generate algorithms that
 

8757
02:53:42,439 --> 02:53:44,429
algorithms that generate algorithms that
I I can that start to look a lot like

8758
02:53:44,429 --> 02:53:44,439
I I can that start to look a lot like
 

8759
02:53:44,439 --> 02:53:48,630
I I can that start to look a lot like
like human reasoning you know I don't

8760
02:53:48,630 --> 02:53:48,640
like human reasoning you know I don't
 

8761
02:53:48,640 --> 02:53:49,870
like human reasoning you know I don't
think I think again we can show that on

8762
02:53:49,870 --> 02:53:49,880
think I think again we can show that on
 

8763
02:53:49,880 --> 02:53:52,070
think I think again we can show that on
a piece of paper that sure I think there

8764
02:53:52,070 --> 02:53:52,080
a piece of paper that sure I think there
 

8765
02:53:52,080 --> 02:53:54,710
a piece of paper that sure I think there
has you have to have so this is the

8766
02:53:54,710 --> 02:53:54,720
has you have to have so this is the
 

8767
02:53:54,720 --> 02:53:57,030
has you have to have so this is the
failure in epistemology like I'm I'm

8768
02:53:57,030 --> 02:53:57,040
failure in epistemology like I'm I'm
 

8769
02:53:57,040 --> 02:53:58,630
failure in epistemology like I'm I'm
glad I even can say that word let know

8770
02:53:58,630 --> 02:53:58,640
glad I even can say that word let know
 

8771
02:53:58,640 --> 02:54:00,469
glad I even can say that word let know
what it means you said it multiple times

8772
02:54:00,469 --> 02:54:00,479
what it means you said it multiple times
 

8773
02:54:00,479 --> 02:54:02,950
what it means you said it multiple times
I know it's like three times now without

8774
02:54:02,950 --> 02:54:02,960
I know it's like three times now without
 

8775
02:54:02,960 --> 02:54:05,469
I know it's like three times now without
failure quit while you're ahead just

8776
02:54:05,469 --> 02:54:05,479
failure quit while you're ahead just
 

8777
02:54:05,479 --> 02:54:07,790
failure quit while you're ahead just
don't say it again you did really well

8778
02:54:07,790 --> 02:54:07,800
don't say it again you did really well
 

8779
02:54:07,800 --> 02:54:11,990
don't say it again you did really well
thanks so I but I I think the so what is

8780
02:54:11,990 --> 02:54:12,000
thanks so I but I I think the so what is
 

8781
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:13,670
thanks so I but I I think the so what is
reasoning so coming back to chemical

8782
02:54:13,670 --> 02:54:13,680
reasoning so coming back to chemical
 

8783
02:54:13,680 --> 02:54:15,950
reasoning so coming back to chemical
brain if I could basically if I could

8784
02:54:15,950 --> 02:54:15,960
brain if I could basically if I could
 

8785
02:54:15,960 --> 02:54:19,150
brain if I could basically if I could
show that in a cuz I mean I'm never

8786
02:54:19,150 --> 02:54:19,160
show that in a cuz I mean I'm never
 

8787
02:54:19,160 --> 02:54:21,150
show that in a cuz I mean I'm never
going to make an intelligence in in cam

8788
02:54:21,150 --> 02:54:21,160
going to make an intelligence in in cam
 

8789
02:54:21,160 --> 02:54:23,070
going to make an intelligence in in cam
mackina because we don't have brain

8790
02:54:23,070 --> 02:54:23,080
mackina because we don't have brain
 

8791
02:54:23,080 --> 02:54:24,790
mackina because we don't have brain
cells they don't have gal cells they

8792
02:54:24,790 --> 02:54:24,800
cells they don't have gal cells they
 

8793
02:54:24,800 --> 02:54:26,750
cells they don't have gal cells they
don't have neurons but if I can make if

8794
02:54:26,750 --> 02:54:26,760
don't have neurons but if I can make if
 

8795
02:54:26,760 --> 02:54:29,990
don't have neurons but if I can make if
I can take a matri a gel and engineer

8796
02:54:29,990 --> 02:54:30,000
I can take a matri a gel and engineer
 

8797
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:33,229
I can take a matri a gel and engineer
the gel to have it be a hybrid hardware

8798
02:54:33,229 --> 02:54:33,239
the gel to have it be a hybrid hardware
 

8799
02:54:33,239 --> 02:54:35,269
the gel to have it be a hybrid hardware
for rep reprogramming which I think I

8800
02:54:35,269 --> 02:54:35,279
for rep reprogramming which I think I
 

8801
02:54:35,279 --> 02:54:37,550
for rep reprogramming which I think I
know how to do I will be to process a

8802
02:54:37,550 --> 02:54:37,560
know how to do I will be to process a
 

8803
02:54:37,560 --> 02:54:40,349
know how to do I will be to process a
lot more information and train train

8804
02:54:40,349 --> 02:54:40,359
lot more information and train train
 

8805
02:54:40,359 --> 02:54:43,790
lot more information and train train
models billions of times cheaper and use

8806
02:54:43,790 --> 02:54:43,800
models billions of times cheaper and use
 

8807
02:54:43,800 --> 02:54:44,990
models billions of times cheaper and use
cross domain main knowledge and there's

8808
02:54:44,990 --> 02:54:45,000
cross domain main knowledge and there's
 

8809
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:46,910
cross domain main knowledge and there's
certain techniques I think we can do but

8810
02:54:46,910 --> 02:54:46,920
certain techniques I think we can do but
 

8811
02:54:46,920 --> 02:54:50,990
certain techniques I think we can do but
it's still missing though the the

8812
02:54:50,990 --> 02:54:51,000
it's still missing though the the
 

8813
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:52,630
it's still missing though the the
abilities of human beings have had to

8814
02:54:52,630 --> 02:54:52,640
abilities of human beings have had to
 

8815
02:54:52,640 --> 02:54:55,750
abilities of human beings have had to
become true and complete and so I guess

8816
02:54:55,750 --> 02:54:55,760
become true and complete and so I guess
 

8817
02:54:55,760 --> 02:54:58,550
become true and complete and so I guess
the question to to give back at you and

8818
02:54:58,550 --> 02:54:58,560
the question to to give back at you and
 

8819
02:54:58,560 --> 02:55:00,229
the question to to give back at you and
I it's like how do you tell the

8820
02:55:00,229 --> 02:55:00,239
I it's like how do you tell the
 

8821
02:55:00,239 --> 02:55:02,030
I it's like how do you tell the
difference between trial and

8822
02:55:02,030 --> 02:55:02,040
difference between trial and
 

8823
02:55:02,040 --> 02:55:05,710
difference between trial and
error um and the generation of new

8824
02:55:05,710 --> 02:55:05,720
error um and the generation of new
 

8825
02:55:05,720 --> 02:55:07,710
error um and the generation of new
knowledge I think the way you can do it

8826
02:55:07,710 --> 02:55:07,720
knowledge I think the way you can do it
 

8827
02:55:07,720 --> 02:55:10,269
knowledge I think the way you can do it
is this is that you come up with a a

8828
02:55:10,269 --> 02:55:10,279
is this is that you come up with a a
 

8829
02:55:10,279 --> 02:55:12,349
is this is that you come up with a a
theory an explanation inspiration comes

8830
02:55:12,349 --> 02:55:12,359
theory an explanation inspiration comes
 

8831
02:55:12,359 --> 02:55:15,590
theory an explanation inspiration comes

yet that is what intelligence is I would

8990
02:58:25,190 --> 02:58:25,200
yet that is what intelligence is I would
 

8991
02:58:25,200 --> 02:58:28,229
yet that is what intelligence is I would
argue those leaps and some people say no

8992
02:58:28,229 --> 02:58:28,239
argue those leaps and some people say no
 

8993
02:58:28,239 --> 02:58:29,309
argue those leaps and some people say no
it's actually just what will happen if

8994
02:58:29,309 --> 02:58:29,319
it's actually just what will happen if
 

8995
02:58:29,319 --> 02:58:30,830
it's actually just what will happen if
you just do cross domain training and

8996
02:58:30,830 --> 02:58:30,840
you just do cross domain training and
 

8997
02:58:30,840 --> 02:58:33,030
you just do cross domain training and
all that stuff and that may be true and

8998
02:58:33,030 --> 02:58:33,040
all that stuff and that may be true and
 

8999
02:58:33,040 --> 02:58:35,950
all that stuff and that may be true and
I may be completely wrong but right now

9000
02:58:35,950 --> 02:58:35,960
I may be completely wrong but right now
 

9001
02:58:35,960 --> 02:58:39,070
I may be completely wrong but right now
the human mind is able to mine novelty

9002
02:58:39,070 --> 02:58:39,080
the human mind is able to mine novelty
 

9003
02:58:39,080 --> 02:58:41,309
the human mind is able to mine novelty
in a way that artificial intelligence

9004
02:58:41,309 --> 02:58:41,319
in a way that artificial intelligence
 

9005
02:58:41,319 --> 02:58:42,830
in a way that artificial intelligence
systems cannot and this is why we still

9006
02:58:42,830 --> 02:58:42,840
systems cannot and this is why we still
 

9007
02:58:42,840 --> 02:58:44,429
systems cannot and this is why we still
have a job and we're still doing stuff

9008
02:58:44,429 --> 02:58:44,439
have a job and we're still doing stuff
 

9009
02:58:44,439 --> 02:58:46,309
have a job and we're still doing stuff
and you know I used chat GPT for a few

9010
02:58:46,309 --> 02:58:46,319
and you know I used chat GPT for a few
 

9011
02:58:46,319 --> 02:58:47,910
and you know I used chat GPT for a few
weeks oh this is cool and then it took

9012
02:58:47,910 --> 02:58:47,920
weeks oh this is cool and then it took
 

9013
02:58:47,920 --> 02:58:50,389
weeks oh this is cool and then it took
me too I had to I well what happened is

9014
02:58:50,389 --> 02:58:50,399
me too I had to I well what happened is
 

9015
02:58:50,399 --> 02:58:51,630
me too I had to I well what happened is
it took me too much time to correct it

9016
02:58:51,630 --> 02:58:51,640
it took me too much time to correct it
 

9017
02:58:51,640 --> 02:58:53,550
it took me too much time to correct it
then it got really good and now they've

9018
02:58:53,550 --> 02:58:53,560
then it got really good and now they've
 

9019
02:58:53,560 --> 02:58:54,830
then it got really good and now they've
they've done something to it it's not

9020
02:58:54,830 --> 02:58:54,840
they've done something to it it's not
 

9021
02:58:54,840 --> 02:58:56,990
they've done something to it it's not
actually that good yeah right I don't

9022
02:58:56,990 --> 02:58:57,000
actually that good yeah right I don't
 

9023
02:58:57,000 --> 02:58:59,870
actually that good yeah right I don't
know what's going on censorship yeah so

9024
02:58:59,870 --> 02:58:59,880
know what's going on censorship yeah so
 

9025
02:58:59,880 --> 02:59:01,229
know what's going on censorship yeah so
I mean that's interesting but it will

9026
02:59:01,229 --> 02:59:01,239
I mean that's interesting but it will
 

9027
02:59:01,239 --> 02:59:03,750
I mean that's interesting but it will
push us humans to uh characterize

9028
02:59:03,750 --> 02:59:03,760
push us humans to uh characterize
 

9029
02:59:03,760 --> 02:59:06,070
push us humans to uh characterize
novelty better like characterize the the

9030
02:59:06,070 --> 02:59:06,080
novelty better like characterize the the
 

9031
02:59:06,080 --> 02:59:08,070
novelty better like characterize the the
novel like what is novel what is truly

9032
02:59:08,070 --> 02:59:08,080
novel like what is novel what is truly
 

9033
02:59:08,080 --> 02:59:09,150
novel like what is novel what is truly
novel what's the difference between

9034
02:59:09,150 --> 02:59:09,160
novel what's the difference between
 

9035
02:59:09,160 --> 02:59:11,389
novel what's the difference between
novelty and interpolation I think that

9036
02:59:11,389 --> 02:59:11,399
novelty and interpolation I think that
 

9037
02:59:11,399 --> 02:59:13,309
novelty and interpolation I think that
this this is the thing that makes me

9038
02:59:13,309 --> 02:59:13,319
this this is the thing that makes me
 

9039

generating novelty because we have to
 

9053
02:59:28,200 --> 02:59:31,190

we have to survive in that environment
 

9061
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:40,910
we have to survive in that environment
and I mean I I I Never Say Never I would

and I mean I I I Never Say Never I would
 

9063
02:59:40,920 --> 02:59:43,389
and I mean I I I Never Say Never I would
be very interested in how we can get um

02:59:43,389 --> 02:59:43,399
be very interested in how we can get um

you mentioned uh GPT for electron

9076
02:59:56,389 --> 02:59:56,399
you mentioned uh GPT for electron
 

9077
02:59:56,399 --> 03:00:00,550
you mentioned uh GPT for electron
density so a GPT like system for uh

9078
03:00:00,550 --> 03:00:00,560
density so a GPT like system for uh
 

9079
03:00:00,560 --> 03:00:03,309

9083
03:00:05,359 --> 03:00:07,910

it goes my team I try and do things that

9090
03:00:16,750 --> 03:00:16,760
it goes my team I try and do things that
 

9091
03:00:16,760 --> 03:00:19,150
it goes my team I try and do things that
are non obvious but non obvious in

9092
03:00:19,150 --> 03:00:19,160
are non obvious but non obvious in
 

9093
03:00:19,160 --> 03:00:20,590
are non obvious but non obvious in
certain areas and one of the things I

9094
03:00:20,590 --> 03:00:20,600
certain areas and one of the things I
 

9095
03:00:20,600 --> 03:00:23,429
certain areas and one of the things I
was always asking about in chemistry

9096
03:00:23,429 --> 03:00:23,439
was always asking about in chemistry
 

9097
03:00:23,439 --> 03:00:25,190
was always asking about in chemistry
people like to represent molecules as

9098
03:00:25,190 --> 03:00:25,200
people like to represent molecules as
 

9099
03:00:25,200 --> 03:00:28,190
people like to represent molecules as
graphs and it's quite difficult it's

9100
03:00:28,190 --> 03:00:28,200
graphs and it's quite difficult it's
 

9101
03:00:28,200 --> 03:00:29,910
graphs and it's quite difficult it's
it's really hard in a if you're doing Ai

9102
03:00:29,910 --> 03:00:29,920
it's really hard in a if you're doing Ai
 

9103
03:00:29,920 --> 03:00:31,269
it's really hard in a if you're doing Ai
and chemistry you really want to

9104
03:00:31,269 --> 03:00:31,279
and chemistry you really want to
 

9105
03:00:31,279 --> 03:00:33,269
and chemistry you really want to
basically have good representation you

9106
03:00:33,269 --> 03:00:33,279
basically have good representation you
 

9107
03:00:33,279 --> 03:00:34,630
basically have good representation you
can generate new molecules are

9108
03:00:34,630 --> 03:00:34,640
can generate new molecules are
 

9109
03:00:34,640 --> 03:00:36,870
can generate new molecules are
interesting and I was thinking well

9110
03:00:36,870 --> 03:00:36,880
interesting and I was thinking well
 

9111
03:00:36,880 --> 03:00:38,790
interesting and I was thinking well
molecules aren't really graphs and

9112
03:00:38,790 --> 03:00:38,800
molecules aren't really graphs and
 

9113
03:00:38,800 --> 03:00:40,349
molecules aren't really graphs and
they're not continuously

9114
03:00:40,349 --> 03:00:40,359
they're not continuously
 

9115
03:00:40,359 --> 03:00:42,469
they're not continuously
differentiable could I do something that

9116
03:00:42,469 --> 03:00:42,479
differentiable could I do something that
 

9117
03:00:42,479 --> 03:00:43,990
differentiable could I do something that
was continuously differentiable was like

9118
03:00:43,990 --> 03:00:44,000
was continuously differentiable was like
 

9119
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:45,150
was continuously differentiable was like
well molecules are actually made up of

9120
03:00:45,150 --> 03:00:45,160
well molecules are actually made up of
 

9121
03:00:45,160 --> 03:00:47,349
well molecules are actually made up of
electron density so I got thinking say

9122
03:00:47,349 --> 03:00:47,359
electron density so I got thinking say
 

9123
03:00:47,359 --> 03:00:49,710
electron density so I got thinking say
well okay could there be a way where we

9124
03:00:49,710 --> 03:00:49,720
well okay could there be a way where we
 

9125
03:00:49,720 --> 03:00:52,670
well okay could there be a way where we
could just basically take a um take a

9126
03:00:52,670 --> 03:00:52,680
could just basically take a um take a
 

9127
03:00:52,680 --> 03:00:54,990
could just basically take a um take a
database of readily solved electron

9128
03:00:54,990 --> 03:00:55,000
database of readily solved electron
 

9129
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:58,469
database of readily solved electron
densities for in millions of molecules

9130
03:00:58,469 --> 03:00:58,479
densities for in millions of molecules
 

9131
03:00:58,479 --> 03:00:59,830
densities for in millions of molecules
so we took the electron density for

9132
03:00:59,830 --> 03:00:59,840
so we took the electron density for
 

9133
03:00:59,840 --> 03:01:01,550
so we took the electron density for
millions of molecules and just train the

9134
03:01:01,550 --> 03:01:01,560
millions of molecules and just train the
 

9135
03:01:01,560 --> 03:01:04,590
millions of molecules and just train the
model to put to learn What electron

9136
03:01:04,590 --> 03:01:04,600
model to put to learn What electron
 

9137
03:01:04,600 --> 03:01:05,510
model to put to learn What electron
density

9138
03:01:05,510 --> 03:01:05,520
density
 

9139
03:01:05,520 --> 03:01:07,990
density
is and so what we built was a system

9140
03:01:07,990 --> 03:01:08,000
is and so what we built was a system
 

9141
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:10,710
is and so what we built was a system
that you literally could give it a let's

9142
03:01:10,710 --> 03:01:10,720
that you literally could give it a let's
 

9143
03:01:10,720 --> 03:01:12,070
that you literally could give it a let's
say you could take a protein that has a

9144
03:01:12,070 --> 03:01:12,080
say you could take a protein that has a
 

9145
03:01:12,080 --> 03:01:14,630
say you could take a protein that has a
particular active site or you know a cup

9146
03:01:14,630 --> 03:01:14,640
particular active site or you know a cup
 

9147
03:01:14,640 --> 03:01:16,469
particular active site or you know a cup
with a certain hole in it you pour noise

9148
03:01:16,469 --> 03:01:16,479
with a certain hole in it you pour noise
 

9149
03:01:16,479 --> 03:01:18,670
with a certain hole in it you pour noise
into it and with a GPT you turn the

9150
03:01:18,670 --> 03:01:18,680
into it and with a GPT you turn the
 

9151
03:01:18,680 --> 03:01:21,229
into it and with a GPT you turn the
noise into electron density and then in

9152
03:01:21,229 --> 03:01:21,239
noise into electron density and then in
 

9153
03:01:21,239 --> 03:01:23,269
noise into electron density and then in
this case it hallucinates like all of

9154
03:01:23,269 --> 03:01:23,279
this case it hallucinates like all of
 

9155
03:01:23,279 --> 03:01:25,550
this case it hallucinates like all of
them do but the hallucinations are good

9156
03:01:25,550 --> 03:01:25,560
them do but the hallucinations are good
 

9157
03:01:25,560 --> 03:01:26,990
them do but the hallucinations are good
because it means I don't have to train

9158
03:01:26,990 --> 03:01:27,000
because it means I don't have to train
 

9159
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:30,870
because it means I don't have to train
on such a large num such a huge data set

9160
03:01:30,870 --> 03:01:30,880
on such a large num such a huge data set
 

9161
03:01:30,880 --> 03:01:32,190
on such a large num such a huge data set
because these data sets are very

9162
03:01:32,190 --> 03:01:32,200
because these data sets are very
 

9163
03:01:32,200 --> 03:01:34,429
because these data sets are very
expensive because how do you produce it

9164
03:01:34,429 --> 03:01:34,439
expensive because how do you produce it
 

9165
03:01:34,439 --> 03:01:36,750
expensive because how do you produce it
so so go back a steps you've got all

9166
03:01:36,750 --> 03:01:36,760
so so go back a steps you've got all
 

9167
03:01:36,760 --> 03:01:39,309
so so go back a steps you've got all
these molecules in this data set but

9168
03:01:39,309 --> 03:01:39,319
these molecules in this data set but
 

9169
03:01:39,319 --> 03:01:41,830
these molecules in this data set but
what you've literally done is um a

9170
03:01:41,830 --> 03:01:41,840
what you've literally done is um a
 

9171
03:01:41,840 --> 03:01:43,349
what you've literally done is um a
quantum mechanical calculation we've

9172
03:01:43,349 --> 03:01:43,359
quantum mechanical calculation we've
 

9173
03:01:43,359 --> 03:01:44,710
quantum mechanical calculation we've
produced electron densities for each

9174
03:01:44,710 --> 03:01:44,720
produced electron densities for each
 

9175
03:01:44,720 --> 03:01:46,269
produced electron densities for each
molecule so you say oh this

9176
03:01:46,269 --> 03:01:46,279
molecule so you say oh this
 

9177
03:01:46,279 --> 03:01:47,630
molecule so you say oh this
representation of this molecule has

9178
03:01:47,630 --> 03:01:47,640
representation of this molecule has
 

9179
03:01:47,640 --> 03:01:49,190
representation of this molecule has
these electron densities associated with

9180
03:01:49,190 --> 03:01:49,200
these electron densities associated with
 

9181
03:01:49,200 --> 03:01:51,150
these electron densities associated with
it so you know what the representation

9182
03:01:51,150 --> 03:01:51,160
it so you know what the representation
 

9183
03:01:51,160 --> 03:01:52,830
it so you know what the representation
is and you train the neural network you

9184
03:01:52,830 --> 03:01:52,840
is and you train the neural network you
 

9185
03:01:52,840 --> 03:01:54,790
is and you train the neural network you
know what electron density is so then

9186
03:01:54,790 --> 03:01:54,800
know what electron density is so then
 

9187
03:01:54,800 --> 03:01:57,229
know what electron density is so then
you give it an unknown pocket you pour

9188
03:01:57,229 --> 03:01:57,239
you give it an unknown pocket you pour
 

9189
03:01:57,239 --> 03:01:58,870
you give it an unknown pocket you pour
in noise and you say right produce me

9190
03:01:58,870 --> 03:01:58,880
in noise and you say right produce me
 

9191
03:01:58,880 --> 03:02:01,469
in noise and you say right produce me
electron density it produces electron

9192
03:02:01,469 --> 03:02:01,479
electron density it produces electron
 

9193
03:02:01,479 --> 03:02:03,750
electron density it produces electron
density that doesn't look ridiculous and

9194
03:02:03,750 --> 03:02:03,760
density that doesn't look ridiculous and
 

9195
03:02:03,760 --> 03:02:05,670
density that doesn't look ridiculous and
what we we did in this case is we

9196
03:02:05,670 --> 03:02:05,680
what we we did in this case is we
 

9197
03:02:05,680 --> 03:02:08,150
what we we did in this case is we
produce electron density that um

9198
03:02:08,150 --> 03:02:08,160
produce electron density that um
 

9199
03:02:08,160 --> 03:02:10,110
produce electron density that um
maximizes the electrostatic potential so

9200
03:02:10,110 --> 03:02:10,120
maximizes the electrostatic potential so
 

9201
03:02:10,120 --> 03:02:12,550
maximizes the electrostatic potential so
the stickiness but minimizes the what we

9202
03:02:12,550 --> 03:02:12,560
the stickiness but minimizes the what we
 

9203
03:02:12,560 --> 03:02:13,790
the stickiness but minimizes the what we
call the steric hindrance so the

9204
03:02:13,790 --> 03:02:13,800
call the steric hindrance so the
 

9205
03:02:13,800 --> 03:02:15,990
call the steric hindrance so the
overlaps is repulsive so you know make

9206
03:02:15,990 --> 03:02:16,000
overlaps is repulsive so you know make
 

9207
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:18,790
overlaps is repulsive so you know make
the perfect fit and then we then used a

9208
03:02:18,790 --> 03:02:18,800
the perfect fit and then we then used a
 

9209
03:02:18,800 --> 03:02:19,910
the perfect fit and then we then used a
kind of

9210
03:02:19,910 --> 03:02:19,920
kind of
 

9211
03:02:19,920 --> 03:02:22,710
kind of
a kind of like a chat GPT type thing to

9212
03:02:22,710 --> 03:02:22,720
a kind of like a chat GPT type thing to
 

9213
03:02:22,720 --> 03:02:24,030
a kind of like a chat GPT type thing to
turn that electron density into what's

9214
03:02:24,030 --> 03:02:24,040
turn that electron density into what's
 

9215
03:02:24,040 --> 03:02:27,070
turn that electron density into what's
called a smile a smile string is a is a

9216
03:02:27,070 --> 03:02:27,080
called a smile a smile string is a is a
 

9217
03:02:27,080 --> 03:02:29,550
called a smile a smile string is a is a
is a a way of representing a molecule

9218
03:02:29,550 --> 03:02:29,560
is a a way of representing a molecule
 

9219
03:02:29,560 --> 03:02:32,469
is a a way of representing a molecule
and letters mhm and then we can then so

9220
03:02:32,469 --> 03:02:32,479
and letters mhm and then we can then so
 

9221
03:02:32,479 --> 03:02:33,670
and letters mhm and then we can then so
it just generates them then just

9222
03:02:33,670 --> 03:02:33,680
it just generates them then just
 

9223
03:02:33,680 --> 03:02:35,110
it just generates them then just
generates them and then the other thing

9224
03:02:35,110 --> 03:02:35,120
generates them and then the other thing
 

9225
03:02:35,120 --> 03:02:36,870
generates them and then the other thing
is then we bung that into the computer

9226
03:02:36,870 --> 03:02:36,880
is then we bung that into the computer
 

9227
03:02:36,880 --> 03:02:39,510
is then we bung that into the computer
and then just makes it yeah the the

9228
03:02:39,510 --> 03:02:39,520
and then just makes it yeah the the
 

9229
03:02:39,520 --> 03:02:42,110
and then just makes it yeah the the
computer being the thing that right

9230
03:02:42,110 --> 03:02:42,120
computer being the thing that right
 

9231
03:02:42,120 --> 03:02:43,670
computer being the thing that right
robot we've got that can basically just

9232
03:02:43,670 --> 03:02:43,680
robot we've got that can basically just
 

9233
03:02:43,680 --> 03:02:46,389
robot we've got that can basically just
do chemistry yeah so kind of we kind of

9234
03:02:46,389 --> 03:02:46,399
do chemistry yeah so kind of we kind of
 

9235
03:02:46,399 --> 03:02:48,830
do chemistry yeah so kind of we kind of
got this endtoend drug Discovery machine

9236
03:02:48,830 --> 03:02:48,840
got this endtoend drug Discovery machine
 

9237
03:02:48,840 --> 03:02:50,190
got this endtoend drug Discovery machine
where you can say oh you want to buy to

9238
03:02:50,190 --> 03:02:50,200
where you can say oh you want to buy to
 

9239
03:02:50,200 --> 03:02:52,950
where you can say oh you want to buy to
this active site here you go I mean it's

9240
03:02:52,950 --> 03:02:52,960
this active site here you go I mean it's
 

9241
03:02:52,960 --> 03:02:55,030
this active site here you go I mean it's
a bit leaky and things kind of break but

9242
03:02:55,030 --> 03:02:55,040
a bit leaky and things kind of break but
 

9243
03:02:55,040 --> 03:02:56,670
a bit leaky and things kind of break but
it's it's a proof of principle well were

9244
03:02:56,670 --> 03:02:56,680
it's it's a proof of principle well were
 

9245
03:02:56,680 --> 03:02:59,269
it's it's a proof of principle well were
the hallucinations what are those

9246
03:02:59,269 --> 03:02:59,279
the hallucinations what are those
 

9247
03:02:59,279 --> 03:03:01,429
the hallucinations what are those
still uh accurate well the

9248
03:03:01,429 --> 03:03:01,439
still uh accurate well the
 

9249
03:03:01,439 --> 03:03:02,950
still uh accurate well the
hallucinations are really great in this

9250
03:03:02,950 --> 03:03:02,960
hallucinations are really great in this
 

9251
03:03:02,960 --> 03:03:05,269
hallucinations are really great in this
case cuz in the case of a large langage

9252
03:03:05,269 --> 03:03:05,279
case cuz in the case of a large langage
 

9253
03:03:05,279 --> 03:03:06,750
case cuz in the case of a large langage
model the hallucinations just like just

9254
03:03:06,750 --> 03:03:06,760
model the hallucinations just like just
 

9255
03:03:06,760 --> 03:03:08,990
model the hallucinations just like just
make everything up to when it doesn't

9256
03:03:08,990 --> 03:03:09,000
make everything up to when it doesn't
 

9257
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:10,389
make everything up to when it doesn't
just make everything up but it gives you

9258
03:03:10,389 --> 03:03:10,399
just make everything up but it gives you
 

9259
03:03:10,399 --> 03:03:11,830
just make everything up but it gives you
an output that you're plausibly

9260
03:03:11,830 --> 03:03:11,840
an output that you're plausibly
 

9261
03:03:11,840 --> 03:03:13,510
an output that you're plausibly
comfortable with thinks you're doing

9262
03:03:13,510 --> 03:03:13,520
comfortable with thinks you're doing
 

9263
03:03:13,520 --> 03:03:15,790
comfortable with thinks you're doing
prob istically the problem on these

9264
03:03:15,790 --> 03:03:15,800
prob istically the problem on these
 

9265
03:03:15,800 --> 03:03:18,429
prob istically the problem on these
electron density models is it's very

9266
03:03:18,429 --> 03:03:18,439
electron density models is it's very
 

9267
03:03:18,439 --> 03:03:20,469
electron density models is it's very
expensive to solve a shreding equation

9268
03:03:20,469 --> 03:03:20,479
expensive to solve a shreding equation
 

9269
03:03:20,479 --> 03:03:23,469
expensive to solve a shreding equation
going up to many heavy atoms and me and

9270
03:03:23,469 --> 03:03:23,479
going up to many heavy atoms and me and
 

9271
03:03:23,479 --> 03:03:27,229
going up to many heavy atoms and me and
large molecules and so we wondered if we

9272
03:03:27,229 --> 03:03:27,239
large molecules and so we wondered if we
 

9273
03:03:27,239 --> 03:03:31,790
large molecules and so we wondered if we
trained the um the the system on up to

9274
03:03:31,790 --> 03:03:31,800
trained the um the the system on up to
 

9275
03:03:31,800 --> 03:03:33,389
trained the um the the system on up to
nine heavy atoms whether it would go

9276
03:03:33,389 --> 03:03:33,399
nine heavy atoms whether it would go
 

9277
03:03:33,399 --> 03:03:35,750
nine heavy atoms whether it would go
beyond nine and it did it started to

9278
03:03:35,750 --> 03:03:35,760
beyond nine and it did it started to
 

9279
03:03:35,760 --> 03:03:38,229
beyond nine and it did it started to
generate molecules for 12 no problem

9280
03:03:38,229 --> 03:03:38,239
generate molecules for 12 no problem
 

9281
03:03:38,239 --> 03:03:39,349
generate molecules for 12 no problem
they look pretty good and I was like

9282
03:03:39,349 --> 03:03:39,359
they look pretty good and I was like
 

9283
03:03:39,359 --> 03:03:41,190
they look pretty good and I was like
well this hallucination I will take for

9284
03:03:41,190 --> 03:03:41,200
well this hallucination I will take for
 

9285
03:03:41,200 --> 03:03:42,790
well this hallucination I will take for
free thank you very much because it just

9286
03:03:42,790 --> 03:03:42,800
free thank you very much because it just
 

9287
03:03:42,800 --> 03:03:44,710
free thank you very much because it just
basically um this is a case where

9288
03:03:44,710 --> 03:03:44,720
basically um this is a case where
 

9289
03:03:44,720 --> 03:03:46,429
basically um this is a case where
interpolation extrapolation worked

9290
03:03:46,429 --> 03:03:46,439
interpolation extrapolation worked
 

9291
03:03:46,439 --> 03:03:48,790
interpolation extrapolation worked
relatively well um and we were able to

9292
03:03:48,790 --> 03:03:48,800
relatively well um and we were able to
 

9293
03:03:48,800 --> 03:03:51,950
relatively well um and we were able to
generate the really good molecules and

9294
03:03:51,950 --> 03:03:51,960
generate the really good molecules and
 

9295
03:03:51,960 --> 03:03:54,110
generate the really good molecules and
then what we were able to do here is and

9296
03:03:54,110 --> 03:03:54,120
then what we were able to do here is and
 

9297
03:03:54,120 --> 03:03:55,510
then what we were able to do here is and
this is a really good point what I was

9298
03:03:55,510 --> 03:03:55,520
this is a really good point what I was
 

9299
03:03:55,520 --> 03:03:56,950
this is a really good point what I was
trying to say earlier

9300
03:03:56,950 --> 03:03:56,960
trying to say earlier
 

9301
03:03:56,960 --> 03:04:00,910
trying to say earlier
that we were able to generate new

9302
03:04:00,910 --> 03:04:00,920
that we were able to generate new
 

9303
03:04:00,920 --> 03:04:03,710
that we were able to generate new
molecules from the known data set that

9304
03:04:03,710 --> 03:04:03,720
molecules from the known data set that
 

9305
03:04:03,720 --> 03:04:07,469
molecules from the known data set that
would bind to the the host so a new

9306
03:04:07,469 --> 03:04:07,479
would bind to the the host so a new
 

9307
03:04:07,479 --> 03:04:10,550
would bind to the the host so a new
guest to bind were these truly novel not

9308
03:04:10,550 --> 03:04:10,560
guest to bind were these truly novel not
 

9309
03:04:10,560 --> 03:04:12,910
guest to bind were these truly novel not
really because they they were

9310
03:04:12,910 --> 03:04:12,920
really because they they were
 

9311
03:04:12,920 --> 03:04:15,229
really because they they were
constrained by the host were they new to

9312
03:04:15,229 --> 03:04:15,239
constrained by the host were they new to
 

9313
03:04:15,239 --> 03:04:20,590
constrained by the host were they new to
us yes so I do well understand I can

9314
03:04:20,590 --> 03:04:20,600
us yes so I do well understand I can
 

9315
03:04:20,600 --> 03:04:23,429
us yes so I do well understand I can
concede that machine Learning Systems um

9316
03:04:23,429 --> 03:04:23,439
concede that machine Learning Systems um
 

9317
03:04:23,439 --> 03:04:24,990
concede that machine Learning Systems um
artificial intelligence systems can

9318
03:04:24,990 --> 03:04:25,000
artificial intelligence systems can
 

9319
03:04:25,000 --> 03:04:28,790
artificial intelligence systems can
generate new entities but how novel are

9320
03:04:28,790 --> 03:04:28,800
generate new entities but how novel are
 

9321
03:04:28,800 --> 03:04:30,630
generate new entities but how novel are
they it remains to be

9322
03:04:30,630 --> 03:04:30,640
they it remains to be
 

9323
03:04:30,640 --> 03:04:33,309
they it remains to be
seen yeah and how novel the things that

9324
03:04:33,309 --> 03:04:33,319
seen yeah and how novel the things that
 

9325
03:04:33,319 --> 03:04:36,510
seen yeah and how novel the things that
humans generate is also difficult to uh

9326
03:04:36,510 --> 03:04:36,520
humans generate is also difficult to uh
 

9327
03:04:36,520 --> 03:04:39,110
humans generate is also difficult to uh
quantify they seem

9328
03:04:39,110 --> 03:04:39,120
quantify they seem
 

9329
03:04:39,120 --> 03:04:41,950
quantify they seem
novel that's what a lot of people say

9330
03:04:41,950 --> 03:04:41,960
novel that's what a lot of people say
 

9331
03:04:41,960 --> 03:04:43,910
novel that's what a lot of people say
like you know

9332
03:04:43,910 --> 03:04:43,920
like you know
 

9333
03:04:43,920 --> 03:04:45,790
like you know
so the way to really get to genuine

9334
03:04:45,790 --> 03:04:45,800
so the way to really get to genuine
 

9335
03:04:45,800 --> 03:04:48,150
so the way to really get to genuine
novelty and assembly Theory shows you

9336
03:04:48,150 --> 03:04:48,160
novelty and assembly Theory shows you
 

9337
03:04:48,160 --> 03:04:50,510
novelty and assembly Theory shows you
the way is to have different causal

9338
03:04:50,510 --> 03:04:50,520
the way is to have different causal
 

9339
03:04:50,520 --> 03:04:53,910
the way is to have different causal
chains overlap and this really this

9340
03:04:53,910 --> 03:04:53,920
chains overlap and this really this
 

9341
03:04:53,920 --> 03:04:57,750
chains overlap and this really this
really um resonates with the the the

9342
03:04:57,750 --> 03:04:57,760
really um resonates with the the the
 

9343
03:04:57,760 --> 03:05:00,990
really um resonates with the the the
time is fundamental argument and if

9344
03:05:00,990 --> 03:05:01,000
time is fundamental argument and if
 

9345
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:04,110
time is fundamental argument and if
you're bringing together um a couple of

9346
03:05:04,110 --> 03:05:04,120
you're bringing together um a couple of
 

9347
03:05:04,120 --> 03:05:06,070
you're bringing together um a couple of
object objects with different initial

9348
03:05:06,070 --> 03:05:06,080
object objects with different initial
 

9349
03:05:06,080 --> 03:05:07,870
object objects with different initial
conditions coming together when they

9350
03:05:07,870 --> 03:05:07,880
conditions coming together when they
 

9351
03:05:07,880 --> 03:05:10,349
conditions coming together when they
interact the more different their

9352
03:05:10,349 --> 03:05:10,359
interact the more different their
 

9353
03:05:10,359 --> 03:05:14,070
interact the more different their
histories the more novelty they generate

9354
03:05:14,070 --> 03:05:14,080
histories the more novelty they generate
 

9355
03:05:14,080 --> 03:05:16,870
histories the more novelty they generate
in time going forward and so it could be

9356
03:05:16,870 --> 03:05:16,880
in time going forward and so it could be
 

9357
03:05:16,880 --> 03:05:19,550
in time going forward and so it could be
that genuine novelty is basically about

9358
03:05:19,550 --> 03:05:19,560
that genuine novelty is basically about
 

9359
03:05:19,560 --> 03:05:22,349
that genuine novelty is basically about
mix mix it up a little and the human

9360
03:05:22,349 --> 03:05:22,359
mix mix it up a little and the human
 

9361
03:05:22,359 --> 03:05:24,550
mix mix it up a little and the human
brain is able to mix it up a little

9362
03:05:24,550 --> 03:05:24,560
brain is able to mix it up a little
 

9363
03:05:24,560 --> 03:05:26,150
brain is able to mix it up a little
little and all that stimulus comes from

9364
03:05:26,150 --> 03:05:26,160
little and all that stimulus comes from
 

9365
03:05:26,160 --> 03:05:28,150
little and all that stimulus comes from
the environment but all I think I'm

9366
03:05:28,150 --> 03:05:28,160
the environment but all I think I'm
 

9367
03:05:28,160 --> 03:05:30,670
the environment but all I think I'm
saying is the universe is deterministic

9368
03:05:30,670 --> 03:05:30,680
saying is the universe is deterministic
 

9369
03:05:30,680 --> 03:05:33,070
saying is the universe is deterministic
going back in time non-deterministic

9370
03:05:33,070 --> 03:05:33,080
going back in time non-deterministic
 

9371
03:05:33,080 --> 03:05:34,750
going back in time non-deterministic
going forward in time because the future

9372
03:05:34,750 --> 03:05:34,760
going forward in time because the future
 

9373
03:05:34,760 --> 03:05:36,550
going forward in time because the future
is too the universe is too big in the

9374
03:05:36,550 --> 03:05:36,560
is too the universe is too big in the
 

9375
03:05:36,560 --> 03:05:38,990
is too the universe is too big in the
future to contain in the present

9376
03:05:38,990 --> 03:05:39,000
future to contain in the present
 

9377
03:05:39,000 --> 03:05:41,990
future to contain in the present
therefore these collisions of known

9378
03:05:41,990 --> 03:05:42,000
therefore these collisions of known
 

9379
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:44,710
therefore these collisions of known
things generate unknown things that then

9380
03:05:44,710 --> 03:05:44,720
things generate unknown things that then
 

9381
03:05:44,720 --> 03:05:46,229
things generate unknown things that then
become part of your data set and don't

9382
03:05:46,229 --> 03:05:46,239
become part of your data set and don't
 

9383
03:05:46,239 --> 03:05:48,790
become part of your data set and don't
appear weird that's how we give

9384
03:05:48,790 --> 03:05:48,800
appear weird that's how we give
 

9385
03:05:48,800 --> 03:05:50,429
appear weird that's how we give

consistent with this initial condition

9388
03:05:52,349 --> 03:05:52,359
consistent with this initial condition
 

9389
03:05:52,359 --> 03:05:53,950
consistent with this initial condition
hypothesis but actually we generating

9390
03:05:53,950 --> 03:05:53,960
hypothesis but actually we generating
 

9391
03:05:53,960 --> 03:05:55,870
hypothesis but actually we generating
more and more novelty and that's how it

9392
03:05:55,870 --> 03:05:55,880
more and more novelty and that's how it
 

9393
03:05:55,880 --> 03:05:57,469
more and more novelty and that's how it
works

9394
03:05:57,469 --> 03:05:57,479
works
 

9395
03:05:57,479 --> 03:06:00,630
works
simple so it's hard to quantify novelty

9396
03:06:00,630 --> 03:06:00,640
simple so it's hard to quantify novelty
 

9397
03:06:00,640 --> 03:06:02,910
simple so it's hard to quantify novelty
looking backwards I mean the no the

9398
03:06:02,910 --> 03:06:02,920
looking backwards I mean the no the
 

9399
03:06:02,920 --> 03:06:04,550
looking backwards I mean the no the
present and the future are the novelty

9400
03:06:04,550 --> 03:06:04,560
present and the future are the novelty
 

9401
03:06:04,560 --> 03:06:06,990
present and the future are the novelty
generators but I I like this whole idea

9402
03:06:06,990 --> 03:06:07,000
generators but I I like this whole idea
 

9403
03:06:07,000 --> 03:06:11,070
generators but I I like this whole idea
of mining novelty I think it is um it is

9404
03:06:11,070 --> 03:06:11,080
of mining novelty I think it is um it is
 

9405
03:06:11,080 --> 03:06:13,550
of mining novelty I think it is um it is
going to reveal why the limitation of

9406
03:06:13,550 --> 03:06:13,560
going to reveal why the limitation of
 

9407
03:06:13,560 --> 03:06:15,389
going to reveal why the limitation of
current AI is a bit like the printing

9408
03:06:15,389 --> 03:06:15,399
current AI is a bit like the printing
 

9409
03:06:15,399 --> 03:06:18,349
current AI is a bit like the printing
press right everyone thought that when

9410
03:06:18,349 --> 03:06:18,359
press right everyone thought that when
 

9411
03:06:18,359 --> 03:06:20,389
press right everyone thought that when
book when the printing press came that

9412
03:06:20,389 --> 03:06:20,399
book when the printing press came that
 

9413
03:06:20,399 --> 03:06:22,110
book when the printing press came that
writing books is going to be terrible

9414
03:06:22,110 --> 03:06:22,120
writing books is going to be terrible
 

9415
03:06:22,120 --> 03:06:23,630
writing books is going to be terrible
that you had evil spirits and all this

9416
03:06:23,630 --> 03:06:23,640
that you had evil spirits and all this
 

9417
03:06:23,640 --> 03:06:25,070
that you had evil spirits and all this
they were just

9418
03:06:25,070 --> 03:06:25,080
they were just
 

9419
03:06:25,080 --> 03:06:28,349
they were just
books and same would be with AI yeah but

9420
03:06:28,349 --> 03:06:28,359
books and same would be with AI yeah but
 

9421
03:06:28,359 --> 03:06:30,349
books and same would be with AI yeah but
there I think there just the scale you

9422
03:06:30,349 --> 03:06:30,359
there I think there just the scale you
 

9423
03:06:30,359 --> 03:06:32,349
there I think there just the scale you
can achieve in terms of impact with AI

9424
03:06:32,349 --> 03:06:32,359
can achieve in terms of impact with AI
 

9425
03:06:32,359 --> 03:06:35,750
can achieve in terms of impact with AI
systems is pretty nerve-wracking but but

9426
03:06:35,750 --> 03:06:35,760
systems is pretty nerve-wracking but but
 

9427
03:06:35,760 --> 03:06:37,469
systems is pretty nerve-wracking but but
that's what the big companies want you

9428
03:06:37,469 --> 03:06:37,479
that's what the big companies want you
 

9429
03:06:37,479 --> 03:06:38,229
that's what the big companies want you
to

9430
03:06:38,229 --> 03:06:38,239
to
 

9431
03:06:38,239 --> 03:06:40,830
to
think but not like in terms of Destroy

9432
03:06:40,830 --> 03:06:40,840
think but not like in terms of Destroy
 

9433
03:06:40,840 --> 03:06:44,990
think but not like in terms of Destroy
All Humans but you can have major

9434
03:06:44,990 --> 03:06:45,000
All Humans but you can have major
 

9435
03:06:45,000 --> 03:06:46,550
All Humans but you can have major
consequences and the way social media

9436
03:06:46,550 --> 03:06:46,560
consequences and the way social media
 

9437
03:06:46,560 --> 03:06:49,510
consequences and the way social media
has had major consequences both positive

9438
03:06:49,510 --> 03:06:49,520
has had major consequences both positive
 

9439
03:06:49,520 --> 03:06:51,550
has had major consequences both positive
and negative and so you have to kind of

9440
03:06:51,550 --> 03:06:51,560
and negative and so you have to kind of
 

9441
03:06:51,560 --> 03:06:53,070
and negative and so you have to kind of
think about it and worry about it but

9442
03:06:53,070 --> 03:06:53,080
think about it and worry about it but
 

9443
03:06:53,080 --> 03:06:55,269
think about it and worry about it but
yeah people that fear Monger you know my

9444
03:06:55,269 --> 03:06:55,279
yeah people that fear Monger you know my

P Theory yeah for this you want to know

9446
03:06:58,349 --> 03:06:58,359
P Theory yeah for this you want to know
 

9447
03:06:58,359 --> 03:07:00,870
P Theory yeah for this you want to know
yeah is I think that um a lot of and

9448
03:07:00,870 --> 03:07:00,880
yeah is I think that um a lot of and
 

9449
03:07:00,880 --> 03:07:03,229
yeah is I think that um a lot of and
maybe I'm being and I think I really do

03:07:03,229 --> 03:07:03,239
maybe I'm being and I think I really do
 

9451
03:07:03,239 --> 03:07:06,469
maybe I'm being and I think I really do
respect um you know um a lot of the

9452
03:07:06,469 --> 03:07:06,479
respect um you know um a lot of the
 

9453
03:07:06,479 --> 03:07:08,070
respect um you know um a lot of the
people out there who are trying to have

9454
03:07:08,070 --> 03:07:08,080
people out there who are trying to have
 

9455
03:07:08,080 --> 03:07:09,870
people out there who are trying to have
discourse about the positive future so

9456
03:07:09,870 --> 03:07:09,880
discourse about the positive future so
 

9457
03:07:09,880 --> 03:07:12,870
discourse about the positive future so
open AI guys meta guys and all this and

over here is even worse yeah there's a
there's a little bit of that but there's

9488

there's a little bit of that but there's
 

9489
03:07:42,359 --> 03:07:44,710

also not enough celebration of the
 

9491
03:07:44,720 --> 03:07:46,190
also not enough celebration of the
positive impact that all these

9492
03:07:46,190 --> 03:07:46,200
positive impact that all these
 

9493
03:07:46,200 --> 03:07:48,469
positive impact that all these
technologies have had tend to focus on

9494
03:07:48,469 --> 03:07:48,479
technologies have had tend to focus on
 

9495
03:07:48,479 --> 03:07:50,469
technologies have had tend to focus on
the negative and tend to

9496
03:07:50,469 --> 03:07:50,479
the negative and tend to
 

9497
03:07:50,479 --> 03:07:53,590
the negative and tend to
forget the in part because it's hard to

9498
03:07:53,590 --> 03:07:53,600
forget the in part because it's hard to
 

9499
03:07:53,600 --> 03:07:55,389
forget the in part because it's hard to
measure like it's very hard to measure

worry about right now is like I'm really
 

9507
03:08:02,399 --> 03:08:04,429
worry about right now is like I'm really
I do care about the ethics of what we're

9508
03:08:04,429 --> 03:08:04,439
I do care about the ethics of what we're
 

9509
03:08:04,439 --> 03:08:06,349
I do care about the ethics of what we're
doing and the one of the reasons why I'm

9510
03:08:06,349 --> 03:08:06,359
doing and the one of the reasons why I'm
 

9511

so open about the the things we're
 

9513
03:08:08,200 --> 03:08:09,550
so open about the the things we're
trying to do in the lab make life look

9514
03:08:09,550 --> 03:08:09,560
trying to do in the lab make life look
 

9515
03:08:09,560 --> 03:08:10,990
trying to do in the lab make life look
at intelligence all this is so people

9516
03:08:10,990 --> 03:08:11,000
at intelligence all this is so people
 

9517
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:13,670
at intelligence all this is so people
say what are the consequences of their

9518
03:08:13,670 --> 03:08:13,680
say what are the consequences of their
 

9519
03:08:13,680 --> 03:08:15,229
say what are the consequences of their
and you say what the consequences of not

9520
03:08:15,229 --> 03:08:15,239
and you say what the consequences of not
 

9521
03:08:15,239 --> 03:08:18,510
and you say what the consequences of not
doing it and I think that um what I what

9522
03:08:18,510 --> 03:08:18,520
doing it and I think that um what I what
 

9523
03:08:18,520 --> 03:08:21,190
doing it and I think that um what I what
worries me right now in the present is

9524
03:08:21,190 --> 03:08:21,200
worries me right now in the present is
 

9525
03:08:21,200 --> 03:08:23,670
worries me right now in the present is
lack of authenticated users and

9526
03:08:23,670 --> 03:08:23,680
lack of authenticated users and
 

9527
03:08:23,680 --> 03:08:26,389
lack of authenticated users and
authenticated data and and human users

9528
03:08:26,389 --> 03:08:26,399
authenticated data and and human users
 

9529
03:08:26,399 --> 03:08:27,349
authenticated data and and human users
yeah

9530
03:08:27,349 --> 03:08:27,359
yeah
 

9531
03:08:27,359 --> 03:08:30,790
yeah
human I still think that there will be

9532
03:08:30,790 --> 03:08:30,800
human I still think that there will be
 

9533
03:08:30,800 --> 03:08:33,389
human I still think that there will be
AI agents that appear to be conscious

9534
03:08:33,389 --> 03:08:33,399
AI agents that appear to be conscious
 

9535
03:08:33,399 --> 03:08:34,670
AI agents that appear to be conscious
but they would have to be also

9536
03:08:34,670 --> 03:08:34,680
but they would have to be also
 

9537
03:08:34,680 --> 03:08:37,630
but they would have to be also
authenticated and labeled as such

9538
03:08:37,630 --> 03:08:37,640
authenticated and labeled as such
 

9539
03:08:37,640 --> 03:08:39,910
authenticated and labeled as such
there's too much there's too much value

9540
03:08:39,910 --> 03:08:39,920
there's too much there's too much value

in that you know like friendships with
 

9543
03:08:42,000 --> 03:08:43,910
in that you know like friendships with
AI systems there's too too much

9544
03:08:43,910 --> 03:08:43,920
AI systems there's too too much
 

9545
03:08:43,920 --> 03:08:45,870
AI systems there's too too much
meaningful human experiences to have

9546
03:08:45,870 --> 03:08:45,880
meaningful human experiences to have
 

9547
03:08:45,880 --> 03:08:48,229
meaningful human experiences to have
with the a systems that I just but

9548
03:08:48,229 --> 03:08:48,239
with the a systems that I just but
 

9549
03:08:48,239 --> 03:08:49,389
with the a systems that I just but
that's like a tool right it's a bit like

9614
03:10:10,070 --> 03:10:10,080
like we're just assigning words and
 

9615
03:10:10,080 --> 03:10:13,830
like we're just assigning words and
Concepts to a thing that is

9616
03:10:13,830 --> 03:10:13,840
Concepts to a thing that is
 

9617
03:10:13,840 --> 03:10:15,750
Concepts to a thing that is
fundamental to the real world that there

9618
03:10:15,750 --> 03:10:15,760
fundamental to the real world that there
 

9619
03:10:15,760 --> 03:10:18,950
fundamental to the real world that there
is something out there that is a

9620
03:10:18,950 --> 03:10:18,960
is something out there that is a
 

9621
03:10:18,960 --> 03:10:21,990
is something out there that is a
creative Force underlying the Universe

9622
03:10:21,990 --> 03:10:22,000
creative Force underlying the Universe
 

9623
03:10:22,000 --> 03:10:24,550
creative Force underlying the Universe
um I think the universe there is a

9624
03:10:24,550 --> 03:10:24,560
um I think the universe there is a
 

9625
03:10:24,560 --> 03:10:25,910
um I think the universe there is a
creative force in the universe but I

9626
03:10:25,910 --> 03:10:25,920
creative force in the universe but I
 

9627
03:10:25,920 --> 03:10:29,550
creative force in the universe but I
don't think it's it's Senti in I I mean

9628
03:10:29,550 --> 03:10:29,560
don't think it's it's Senti in I I mean
 

9629
03:10:29,560 --> 03:10:32,110
don't think it's it's Senti in I I mean
I think the so I do not understand the

9630
03:10:32,110 --> 03:10:32,120
I think the so I do not understand the
 

9631
03:10:32,120 --> 03:10:36,830
I think the so I do not understand the
universe so who am I to say you know

9632
03:10:36,830 --> 03:10:36,840
universe so who am I to say you know
 

9633
03:10:36,840 --> 03:10:40,870
universe so who am I to say you know
um that that God doesn't exist I am an

9634
03:10:40,870 --> 03:10:40,880
um that that God doesn't exist I am an
 

9635
03:10:40,880 --> 03:10:43,510
um that that God doesn't exist I am an
atheist but I'm not an angry atheist

9636
03:10:43,510 --> 03:10:43,520
atheist but I'm not an angry atheist
 

9637
03:10:43,520 --> 03:10:46,070
atheist but I'm not an angry atheist
right I have lots of I have lots of

9638
03:10:46,070 --> 03:10:46,080
right I have lots of I have lots of
 

9639
03:10:46,080 --> 03:10:47,309
right I have lots of I have lots of
there are some people I know that are

9640
03:10:47,309 --> 03:10:47,319
there are some people I know that are
 

9641
03:10:47,319 --> 03:10:50,229
there are some people I know that are
angry atheists and say you know CR say

9642
03:10:50,229 --> 03:10:50,239
angry atheists and say you know CR say
 

9643
03:10:50,239 --> 03:10:52,070
angry atheists and say you know CR say
that religious people are stupid I don't

9644
03:10:52,070 --> 03:10:52,080
that religious people are stupid I don't
 

9645
03:10:52,080 --> 03:10:55,150
that religious people are stupid I don't
think that's the case um I have faith in

9646
03:10:55,150 --> 03:10:55,160
think that's the case um I have faith in
 

9647
03:10:55,160 --> 03:10:56,550
think that's the case um I have faith in
some things because I don't I mean when

9648
03:10:56,550 --> 03:10:56,560
some things because I don't I mean when
 

9649
03:10:56,560 --> 03:10:59,229
some things because I don't I mean when
I was a kid I kept like you know like I

9650
03:10:59,229 --> 03:10:59,239
I was a kid I kept like you know like I
 

9651
03:10:59,239 --> 03:11:00,550
I was a kid I kept like you know like I
need to know what the charge of electron

9652
03:11:00,550 --> 03:11:00,560
need to know what the charge of electron
 

9653
03:11:00,560 --> 03:11:02,030
need to know what the charge of electron
is like I can't measure the charge on

9654
03:11:02,030 --> 03:11:02,040
is like I can't measure the charge on
 

9655
03:11:02,040 --> 03:11:03,790
is like I can't measure the charge on
electron that was you know I was just

9656
03:11:03,790 --> 03:11:03,800
electron that was you know I was just
 

9657
03:11:03,800 --> 03:11:05,590
electron that was you know I was just
gave up and had Faith okay you know

9658
03:11:05,590 --> 03:11:05,600
gave up and had Faith okay you know
 

9659
03:11:05,600 --> 03:11:08,550
gave up and had Faith okay you know
resistors worked so when it comes

9660
03:11:08,550 --> 03:11:08,560
resistors worked so when it comes
 

9661
03:11:08,560 --> 03:11:12,429
resistors worked so when it comes
to I want to know why the universe is

9662
03:11:12,429 --> 03:11:12,439
to I want to know why the universe is
 

9663
03:11:12,439 --> 03:11:14,269
to I want to know why the universe is
growing in the future and what humanity

9664
03:11:14,269 --> 03:11:14,279
growing in the future and what humanity
 

9665
03:11:14,279 --> 03:11:17,229
growing in the future and what humanity
is going to become and I've seen that

9666
03:11:17,229 --> 03:11:17,239
is going to become and I've seen that
 

9667
03:11:17,239 --> 03:11:19,910
is going to become and I've seen that
the the acquisition of

9668
03:11:19,910 --> 03:11:19,920
the the acquisition of
 

9669
03:11:19,920 --> 03:11:22,790
the the acquisition of
knowledge via the generation of novelty

9670
03:11:22,790 --> 03:11:22,800
knowledge via the generation of novelty
 

9671
03:11:22,800 --> 03:11:25,190
knowledge via the generation of novelty
to produce technology has uniformly made

9672
03:11:25,190 --> 03:11:25,200
to produce technology has uniformly made
 

9673
03:11:25,200 --> 03:11:27,630
to produce technology has uniformly made
humans lives better I would love to

9674
03:11:27,630 --> 03:11:27,640
humans lives better I would love to
 

9675
03:11:27,640 --> 03:11:28,790
humans lives better I would love to
continue that

9676
03:11:28,790 --> 03:11:28,800
continue that
 

9677
03:11:28,800 --> 03:11:30,590
continue that
tradition

9678
03:11:30,590 --> 03:11:30,600
tradition
 

9679
03:11:30,600 --> 03:11:33,030
tradition
and you said that there's that creative

9680
03:11:33,030 --> 03:11:33,040
and you said that there's that creative
 

9681
03:11:33,040 --> 03:11:35,630
and you said that there's that creative
Force do do you think just to think on

9682
03:11:35,630 --> 03:11:35,640
Force do do you think just to think on
 

9683
03:11:35,640 --> 03:11:36,790
Force do do you think just to think on
that point do you think there's a

9684
03:11:36,790 --> 03:11:36,800
that point do you think there's a
 

9685
03:11:36,800 --> 03:11:39,389
that point do you think there's a
creative Force like is there like a

9686
03:11:39,389 --> 03:11:39,399
creative Force like is there like a
 

9687
03:11:39,399 --> 03:11:40,590
creative Force like is there like a
thing like a

9688
03:11:40,590 --> 03:11:40,600
thing like a
 

9689
03:11:40,600 --> 03:11:43,469
thing like a
driver that's like

9690
03:11:43,469 --> 03:11:43,479
driver that's like
 

9691
03:11:43,479 --> 03:11:47,229
driver that's like
that's creating stuff yeah I think that

9692
03:11:47,229 --> 03:11:47,239
that's creating stuff yeah I think that
 

9693
03:11:47,239 --> 03:11:50,309
that's creating stuff yeah I think that
so I think that and where what what is

9694
03:11:50,309 --> 03:11:50,319
so I think that and where what what is
 

9695
03:11:50,319 --> 03:11:51,990
so I think that and where what what is
can you describe it like mathemat well I

9696
03:11:51,990 --> 03:11:52,000
can you describe it like mathemat well I
 

9697
03:11:52,000 --> 03:11:53,550
can you describe it like mathemat well I
think selection I think selection

9698
03:11:53,550 --> 03:11:53,560
think selection I think selection
 

9699
03:11:53,560 --> 03:11:55,590
think selection I think selection
selection is the force selection is the

9700
03:11:55,590 --> 03:11:55,600
selection is the force selection is the
 

9701
03:11:55,600 --> 03:11:57,830
selection is the force selection is the
force in the universe it creates

9702
03:11:57,830 --> 03:11:57,840
force in the universe it creates
 

9703
03:11:57,840 --> 03:12:00,429
force in the universe it creates
novelty so is selection somehow

9704
03:12:00,429 --> 03:12:00,439
novelty so is selection somehow
 

9705
03:12:00,439 --> 03:12:04,030
novelty so is selection somehow
fundamental like what what yeah I think

9706
03:12:04,030 --> 03:12:04,040
fundamental like what what yeah I think
 

9707
03:12:04,040 --> 03:12:06,269
fundamental like what what yeah I think
Persistence of objects that could Decay

9708
03:12:06,269 --> 03:12:06,279
Persistence of objects that could Decay
 

9709
03:12:06,279 --> 03:12:08,910
Persistence of objects that could Decay
into nothing through operations that

9710
03:12:08,910 --> 03:12:08,920
into nothing through operations that
 

9711
03:12:08,920 --> 03:12:10,990
into nothing through operations that
maintain that structure I mean think

9712
03:12:10,990 --> 03:12:11,000
maintain that structure I mean think
 

9713
03:12:11,000 --> 03:12:13,349
maintain that structure I mean think
about it if um is it's it's amazing that

9714
03:12:13,349 --> 03:12:13,359
about it if um is it's it's amazing that
 

9715
03:12:13,359 --> 03:12:15,910
about it if um is it's it's amazing that
things exist at all that we're just not

9716
03:12:15,910 --> 03:12:15,920
things exist at all that we're just not
 

9717
03:12:15,920 --> 03:12:18,990
things exist at all that we're just not
a big commentarial mess yes so the fact

9718
03:12:18,990 --> 03:12:19,000
a big commentarial mess yes so the fact
 

9719
03:12:19,000 --> 03:12:21,469
a big commentarial mess yes so the fact
and they exist and they a thing that

9720
03:12:21,469 --> 03:12:21,479
and they exist and they a thing that
 

9721
03:12:21,479 --> 03:12:24,670
and they exist and they a thing that
exists persistent time yeah may I mean

9722
03:12:24,670 --> 03:12:24,680
exists persistent time yeah may I mean
 

9723
03:12:24,680 --> 03:12:27,870
exists persistent time yeah may I mean
let's think maybe the universe is

9724
03:12:27,870 --> 03:12:27,880
let's think maybe the universe is
 

9725
03:12:27,880 --> 03:12:31,269
let's think maybe the universe is
actually in the present the things

9726
03:12:31,269 --> 03:12:31,279
actually in the present the things
 

9727
03:12:31,279 --> 03:12:33,030
actually in the present the things
everything that can exist in the present

9728
03:12:33,030 --> 03:12:33,040
everything that can exist in the present
 

9729
03:12:33,040 --> 03:12:38,630
everything that can exist in the present
does

9730
03:12:38,630 --> 03:12:38,640

 

9731
03:12:38,640 --> 03:12:40,710

exist well that would mean it's

9732
03:12:40,710 --> 03:12:40,720
exist well that would mean it's
 

9733
03:12:40,720 --> 03:12:43,429
exist well that would mean it's
deterministic right no I I think the

9734
03:12:43,429 --> 03:12:43,439
deterministic right no I I think the
 

9735
03:12:43,439 --> 03:12:44,950
deterministic right no I I think the
universities might so the universe

9736
03:12:44,950 --> 03:12:44,960
universities might so the universe
 

9737
03:12:44,960 --> 03:12:46,710
universities might so the universe
started super small the past was

9738
03:12:46,710 --> 03:12:46,720
started super small the past was
 

9739
03:12:46,720 --> 03:12:48,630
started super small the past was
deterministic there wasn't much going on

9740
03:12:48,630 --> 03:12:48,640
deterministic there wasn't much going on
 

9741
03:12:48,640 --> 03:12:50,309
deterministic there wasn't much going on
and it was able to mine mine mine mine

9742
03:12:50,309 --> 03:12:50,319
and it was able to mine mine mine mine
 

9743
03:12:50,319 --> 03:12:54,269
and it was able to mine mine mine mine
mine and so that the process I mean is

9744
03:12:54,269 --> 03:12:54,279
mine and so that the process I mean is
 

9745
03:12:54,279 --> 03:12:56,070
mine and so that the process I mean is
um somehow

9746
03:12:56,070 --> 03:12:56,080
um somehow
 

9747
03:12:56,080 --> 03:12:59,510
um somehow
generating um universes

9748
03:12:59,510 --> 03:12:59,520
generating um universes
 

9749
03:12:59,520 --> 03:13:01,469
generating um universes
basically I can't put I'm trying to put

9750
03:13:01,469 --> 03:13:01,479
basically I can't put I'm trying to put
 

9751
03:13:01,479 --> 03:13:02,630
basically I can't put I'm trying to put
this into did you just say there's no

9752
03:13:02,630 --> 03:13:02,640
this into did you just say there's no
 

9753
03:13:02,640 --> 03:13:06,670
this into did you just say there's no
free will though no I didn't say that if

9754
03:13:06,670 --> 03:13:06,680
free will though no I didn't say that if
 

9755
03:13:06,680 --> 03:13:09,309
free will though no I didn't say that if
sorry I said there is Free Will I think

9756
03:13:09,309 --> 03:13:09,319
sorry I said there is Free Will I think
 

9757
03:13:09,319 --> 03:13:13,389
sorry I said there is Free Will I think
I think I I I'm saying that free will

9758
03:13:13,389 --> 03:13:13,399
I think I I I'm saying that free will
 

9759
03:13:13,399 --> 03:13:16,710
I think I I I'm saying that free will
occurs at the boundary between

9760
03:13:16,710 --> 03:13:16,720
occurs at the boundary between
 

9761
03:13:16,720 --> 03:13:20,110
occurs at the boundary between
the the future the past and the future

9762
03:13:20,110 --> 03:13:20,120
the the future the past and the future
 

9763
03:13:20,120 --> 03:13:22,630
the the future the past and the future
yeah I got you but everything that can

9764
03:13:22,630 --> 03:13:22,640
yeah I got you but everything that can
 

9765
03:13:22,640 --> 03:13:25,870
yeah I got you but everything that can
exist does exist everything that is so

9766
03:13:25,870 --> 03:13:25,880
exist does exist everything that is so
 

9767
03:13:25,880 --> 03:13:27,630
exist does exist everything that is so
everything that's possible to exist at

9768
03:13:27,630 --> 03:13:27,640
everything that's possible to exist at
 

9769
03:13:27,640 --> 03:13:30,870
everything that's possible to exist at
this so no I'm really put there's a lot

9770
03:13:30,870 --> 03:13:30,880
this so no I'm really put there's a lot
 

9771
03:13:30,880 --> 03:13:34,190
this so no I'm really put there's a lot
of loaded words there in there's a time

9772
03:13:34,190 --> 03:13:34,200
of loaded words there in there's a time
 

9773
03:13:34,200 --> 03:13:36,429
of loaded words there in there's a time
element loaded into that I I think that

9774
03:13:36,429 --> 03:13:36,439
element loaded into that I I think that
 

9775
03:13:36,439 --> 03:13:38,190
element loaded into that I I think that
the universe is able to do what it can

9776
03:13:38,190 --> 03:13:38,200
the universe is able to do what it can
 

9777
03:13:38,200 --> 03:13:40,870
the universe is able to do what it can
in the present right yeah and then I

9778
03:13:40,870 --> 03:13:40,880
in the present right yeah and then I
 

9779
03:13:40,880 --> 03:13:41,990
in the present right yeah and then I
think in the future there are other

9780
03:13:41,990 --> 03:13:42,000
think in the future there are other
 

9781
03:13:42,000 --> 03:13:43,150
think in the future there are other
things that could be possible we can

9782
03:13:43,150 --> 03:13:43,160
things that could be possible we can
 

9783
03:13:43,160 --> 03:13:44,510
things that could be possible we can
imagine lots of things but they don't

9784
03:13:44,510 --> 03:13:44,520
imagine lots of things but they don't
 

9785
03:13:44,520 --> 03:13:48,510
imagine lots of things but they don't
all happen sure so what that's what I

9786
03:13:48,510 --> 03:13:48,520
all happen sure so what that's what I
 

9787
03:13:48,520 --> 03:13:51,150
all happen sure so what that's what I
sneak in Free Will right there yeah so I

9788
03:13:51,150 --> 03:13:51,160
sneak in Free Will right there yeah so I
 

9789
03:13:51,160 --> 03:13:53,269
sneak in Free Will right there yeah so I
guess what I'm saying is what what what

9790
03:13:53,269 --> 03:13:53,279
guess what I'm saying is what what what
 

9791
03:13:53,279 --> 03:13:57,429
guess what I'm saying is what what what
exists is a com is a convolution of the

9792
03:13:57,429 --> 03:13:57,439
exists is a com is a convolution of the
 

9793
03:13:57,439 --> 03:13:59,349
exists is a com is a convolution of the
past with the present and the Free Will

9794
03:13:59,349 --> 03:13:59,359
past with the present and the Free Will
 

9795
03:13:59,359 --> 03:14:01,389
past with the present and the Free Will
going into the future well we can still

9796
03:14:01,389 --> 03:14:01,399
going into the future well we can still
 

9797
03:14:01,399 --> 03:14:03,309
going into the future well we can still
imagine stuff right we can imagine stuff

9798
03:14:03,309 --> 03:14:03,319
imagine stuff right we can imagine stuff
 

9799
03:14:03,319 --> 03:14:05,950
imagine stuff right we can imagine stuff
that never happen and it's amazing Force

9800
03:14:05,950 --> 03:14:05,960
that never happen and it's amazing Force
 

9801
03:14:05,960 --> 03:14:08,190
that never happen and it's amazing Force
because you're imagin this is the the

9802
03:14:08,190 --> 03:14:08,200
because you're imagin this is the the
 

9803
03:14:08,200 --> 03:14:09,990
because you're imagin this is the the
most important thing that we don't

9804
03:14:09,990 --> 03:14:10,000
most important thing that we don't
 

9805
03:14:10,000 --> 03:14:13,030
most important thing that we don't
understand is our imaginations can

9806
03:14:13,030 --> 03:14:13,040
understand is our imaginations can
 

9807
03:14:13,040 --> 03:14:16,349
understand is our imaginations can
actually change the future in a tangible

9808
03:14:16,349 --> 03:14:16,359
actually change the future in a tangible
 

9809
03:14:16,359 --> 03:14:18,510
actually change the future in a tangible
way which is what the the initial

9810
03:14:18,510 --> 03:14:18,520
way which is what the the initial
 

9811
03:14:18,520 --> 03:14:20,389
way which is what the the initial
conditions in physics cannot predict

9812
03:14:20,389 --> 03:14:20,399
conditions in physics cannot predict
 

9813
03:14:20,399 --> 03:14:23,030
conditions in physics cannot predict
like your imagination has a causal

9814
03:14:23,030 --> 03:14:23,040
like your imagination has a causal
 

9815
03:14:23,040 --> 03:14:25,750
like your imagination has a causal
consequence in the future isn't that

9816
03:14:25,750 --> 03:14:25,760
consequence in the future isn't that
 

9817
03:14:25,760 --> 03:14:29,269
consequence in the future isn't that
weird too

9818
03:14:29,269 --> 03:14:29,279

 

9819
03:14:29,279 --> 03:14:31,910

yeah how do

9820
03:14:31,910 --> 03:14:31,920
yeah how do
 

9821
03:14:31,920 --> 03:14:34,710
yeah how do
you it breaks breaks the laws of physics

9822
03:14:34,710 --> 03:14:34,720
you it breaks breaks the laws of physics
 

9823
03:14:34,720 --> 03:14:36,269
you it breaks breaks the laws of physics
as we know them right

9824
03:14:36,269 --> 03:14:36,279
as we know them right
 

9825
03:14:36,279 --> 03:14:39,309
as we know them right
now yeah so you think the imagination

9826
03:14:39,309 --> 03:14:39,319
now yeah so you think the imagination
 

9827
03:14:39,319 --> 03:14:42,030
now yeah so you think the imagination
has a causal effect in the future yeah

9828
03:14:42,030 --> 03:14:42,040
has a causal effect in the future yeah
 

9829
03:14:42,040 --> 03:14:44,670
has a causal effect in the future yeah
but it does exist in there in the head

9830
03:14:44,670 --> 03:14:44,680
but it does exist in there in the head
 

9831
03:14:44,680 --> 03:14:46,510
but it does exist in there in the head
there must be a lot of power in whatever

9832
03:14:46,510 --> 03:14:46,520
there must be a lot of power in whatever
 

9833
03:14:46,520 --> 03:14:48,349
there must be a lot of power in whatever
is going on there could be a lot of

9834
03:14:48,349 --> 03:14:48,359
is going on there could be a lot of
 

9835
03:14:48,359 --> 03:14:51,110
is going on there could be a lot of
power whatever's going on in there if we

9836
03:14:51,110 --> 03:14:51,120
power whatever's going on in there if we
 

9837
03:14:51,120 --> 03:14:53,790
power whatever's going on in there if we
then go back to initial conditions yeah

9838
03:14:53,790 --> 03:14:53,800
then go back to initial conditions yeah
 

9839
03:14:53,800 --> 03:14:55,750
then go back to initial conditions yeah
and that is simply not possible that can

9840
03:14:55,750 --> 03:14:55,760
and that is simply not possible that can
 

9841
03:14:55,760 --> 03:14:58,309
and that is simply not possible that can
happen but if we go into if we go into a

9842
03:14:58,309 --> 03:14:58,319
happen but if we go into if we go into a
 

9843
03:14:58,319 --> 03:15:00,710
happen but if we go into if we go into a
universe where we accept that there is a

9844
03:15:00,710 --> 03:15:00,720
universe where we accept that there is a
 

9845
03:15:00,720 --> 03:15:03,110
universe where we accept that there is a
finite ability to represent numbers and

9846
03:15:03,110 --> 03:15:03,120
finite ability to represent numbers and
 

9847
03:15:03,120 --> 03:15:04,389
finite ability to represent numbers and
you have rounding well not rounding

9848
03:15:04,389 --> 03:15:04,399
you have rounding well not rounding
 

9849
03:15:04,399 --> 03:15:07,670
you have rounding well not rounding
errors you have some the S what happens

9850
03:15:07,670 --> 03:15:07,680
errors you have some the S what happens
 

9851
03:15:07,680 --> 03:15:09,590
errors you have some the S what happens
the your ability to make decisions

9852
03:15:09,590 --> 03:15:09,600
the your ability to make decisions
 

9853
03:15:09,600 --> 03:15:11,870
the your ability to make decisions
imagine and do stuff is at that

9854
03:15:11,870 --> 03:15:11,880
imagine and do stuff is at that
 

9855
03:15:11,880 --> 03:15:14,550
imagine and do stuff is at that
interface between the certain and the

9856
03:15:14,550 --> 03:15:14,560
interface between the certain and the
 

9857
03:15:14,560 --> 03:15:17,269
interface between the certain and the
uncertain it's not as Yasha was saying

9858
03:15:17,269 --> 03:15:17,279
uncertain it's not as Yasha was saying
 

9859
03:15:17,279 --> 03:15:19,030
uncertain it's not as Yasha was saying
to me Randomness goes and you just you

9860
03:15:19,030 --> 03:15:19,040
to me Randomness goes and you just you
 

9861
03:15:19,040 --> 03:15:21,630
to me Randomness goes and you just you
know randomly do random stuff it is that

9862
03:15:21,630 --> 03:15:21,640
know randomly do random stuff it is that
 

9863
03:15:21,640 --> 03:15:24,110
know randomly do random stuff it is that
you are set free a little on your

9864
03:15:24,110 --> 03:15:24,120
you are set free a little on your
 

9865
03:15:24,120 --> 03:15:26,790
you are set free a little on your
trajectory Free Will is about being able

9866
03:15:26,790 --> 03:15:26,800
trajectory Free Will is about being able
 

9867
03:15:26,800 --> 03:15:29,150
trajectory Free Will is about being able
to explore on this narrow

9868
03:15:29,150 --> 03:15:29,160
to explore on this narrow
 

9869
03:15:29,160 --> 03:15:31,189
to explore on this narrow
trajectory um that allows you to build

9870
03:15:31,189 --> 03:15:31,199
trajectory um that allows you to build
 

9871
03:15:31,199 --> 03:15:33,110
trajectory um that allows you to build
you have a choice about what you build

9872
03:15:33,110 --> 03:15:33,120
you have a choice about what you build
 

9873
03:15:33,120 --> 03:15:35,510
you have a choice about what you build
or that choice is uh you interacting

9874
03:15:35,510 --> 03:15:35,520
or that choice is uh you interacting
 

9875
03:15:35,520 --> 03:15:38,510
or that choice is uh you interacting
with a future in the

9876
03:15:38,510 --> 03:15:38,520
with a future in the
 

9877
03:15:38,520 --> 03:15:40,910
with a future in the
present what do you is most beautiful

9878
03:15:40,910 --> 03:15:40,920
present what do you is most beautiful
 

9879
03:15:40,920 --> 03:15:44,269
present what do you is most beautiful
about this whole thing

9880
03:15:44,269 --> 03:15:44,279
about this whole thing
 

9881
03:15:44,279 --> 03:15:45,269
about this whole thing
the

9882
03:15:45,269 --> 03:15:45,279
the
 

9883
03:15:45,279 --> 03:15:48,590
the
universe the the the fact it seems to be

9884
03:15:48,590 --> 03:15:48,600
universe the the the fact it seems to be
 

9885
03:15:48,600 --> 03:15:52,630
universe the the the fact it seems to be
very undecided very open mhm and the

03:15:52,630 --> 03:15:52,640
very undecided very open mhm and the
 

9887
03:15:52,640 --> 03:15:54,429
very undecided very open mhm and the
fact that

9888
03:15:54,429 --> 03:15:54,439
fact that
 

9889
03:15:54,439 --> 03:15:57,070
fact that
um every time I think I'm getting toward

9890
03:15:57,070 --> 03:15:57,080
um every time I think I'm getting toward
 

9891
03:15:57,080 --> 03:15:58,710
um every time I think I'm getting toward
an answer to a question there is so many

9892
03:15:58,710 --> 03:15:58,720
an answer to a question there is so many
 

9893
03:15:58,720 --> 03:16:01,670
an answer to a question there is so many
more questions that make the the chase

9894
03:16:01,670 --> 03:16:01,680
more questions that make the the chase
 

9895
03:16:01,680 --> 03:16:04,110
more questions that make the the chase
you know um do you hate that it's going

9896
03:16:04,110 --> 03:16:04,120
you know um do you hate that it's going
 

9897
03:16:04,120 --> 03:16:06,870
you know um do you hate that it's going
to be over at some point for you no I I

9898
03:16:06,870 --> 03:16:06,880
to be over at some point for you no I I
 

9899
03:16:06,880 --> 03:16:09,910
to be over at some point for you no I I
well for me I don't so I I I I think if

9900
03:16:09,910 --> 03:16:09,920
well for me I don't so I I I I think if
 

9901
03:16:09,920 --> 03:16:14,389
well for me I don't so I I I I think if
you think about it is it over Newton

9902
03:16:14,389 --> 03:16:14,399
you think about it is it over Newton
 

9903
03:16:14,399 --> 03:16:16,990
you think about it is it over Newton
now Newton has had causal consequences

9904
03:16:16,990 --> 03:16:17,000
now Newton has had causal consequences
 

9905
03:16:17,000 --> 03:16:18,389
now Newton has had causal consequences
in the future we discuss him all the

03:16:18,389 --> 03:16:18,399
in the future we discuss him all the
 

9907
03:16:18,399 --> 03:16:21,389
in the future we discuss him all the

9909
03:16:21,399 --> 03:16:22,910

03:16:38,520 --> 03:16:41,429
to Lee cor it would be quite boring
because I mean I mean I I'm no novelty

9926
03:16:41,429 --> 03:16:41,439
because I mean I mean I I'm no novelty
 

9927
03:16:41,439 --> 03:16:43,910
because I mean I mean I I'm no novelty
generation I I mean if it's a faithful

9928
03:16:43,910 --> 03:16:43,920
generation I I mean if it's a faithful
 

9929
03:16:43,920 --> 03:16:45,269
generation I I mean if it's a faithful
representation of what I've done in my

9930
03:16:45,269 --> 03:16:45,279
representation of what I've done in my
 

9931
03:16:45,279 --> 03:16:46,990
representation of what I've done in my
life that's great that's that's a

9932
03:16:46,990 --> 03:16:47,000
life that's great that's that's a
 

9933
03:16:47,000 --> 03:16:49,269
life that's great that's that's a
interesting artifact but I think the

9934
03:16:49,269 --> 03:16:49,279
interesting artifact but I think the
 

9935
03:16:49,279 --> 03:16:51,030
interesting artifact but I think the
most most interesting thing about

9936
03:16:51,030 --> 03:16:51,040
most most interesting thing about
 

9937
03:16:51,040 --> 03:16:52,229
most most interesting thing about
knowing each other is we don't know what

9938
03:16:52,229 --> 03:16:52,239
knowing each other is we don't know what
 

9939
03:16:52,239 --> 03:16:55,590
knowing each other is we don't know what
we're going to do next

9940
03:16:55,590 --> 03:16:55,600
we're going to do next
 

9941
03:16:55,600 --> 03:16:58,309
we're going to do next
sure sure I mean within some constraints

9942
03:16:58,309 --> 03:16:58,319
sure sure I mean within some constraints
 

9943
03:16:58,319 --> 03:17:00,229
sure sure I mean within some constraints
I've got you know you might I I can

9944
03:17:00,229 --> 03:17:00,239
I've got you know you might I I can
 

9945
03:17:00,239 --> 03:17:01,590
I've got you know you might I I can
predict some things about you you can

9946
03:17:01,590 --> 03:17:01,600
predict some things about you you can
 

9947
03:17:01,600 --> 03:17:02,910
predict some things about you you can
predict some things about me but we

9948
03:17:02,910 --> 03:17:02,920
predict some things about me but we
 

9949
03:17:02,920 --> 03:17:05,670
predict some things about me but we
can't predict everything everything and

9950
03:17:05,670 --> 03:17:05,680
can't predict everything everything and
 

9951
03:17:05,680 --> 03:17:07,469
can't predict everything everything and
it's because we can't predict everything

9952
03:17:07,469 --> 03:17:07,479
it's because we can't predict everything
 

9953
03:17:07,479 --> 03:17:09,150
it's because we can't predict everything
is why we're exciting to come back and

9954
03:17:09,150 --> 03:17:09,160
is why we're exciting to come back and
 

9955
03:17:09,160 --> 03:17:12,550
is why we're exciting to come back and
discuss and see it's so yeah I'm I'm I'm

9956
03:17:12,550 --> 03:17:12,560
discuss and see it's so yeah I'm I'm I'm
 

9957
03:17:12,560 --> 03:17:14,910
discuss and see it's so yeah I'm I'm I'm
I'm kind of H I'm happy that it'll be

9958
03:17:14,910 --> 03:17:14,920
I'm kind of H I'm happy that it'll be
 

9959
03:17:14,920 --> 03:17:16,710
I'm kind of H I'm happy that it'll be
interesting that some things I've done

9960
03:17:16,710 --> 03:17:16,720
interesting that some things I've done
 

9961
03:17:16,720 --> 03:17:22,630
interesting that some things I've done
can be captured but I'm pretty sure that

9962
03:17:22,630 --> 03:17:22,640

 

9963
03:17:22,640 --> 03:17:25,870

my angle on mining novelty for the

9964
03:17:25,870 --> 03:17:25,880
my angle on mining novelty for the
 

9965
03:17:25,880 --> 03:17:27,269
my angle on mining novelty for the
future will not be

9966
03:17:27,269 --> 03:17:27,279
future will not be
 

9967
03:17:27,279 --> 03:17:28,990
future will not be
captured

9968
03:17:28,990 --> 03:17:29,000
captured
 

9969
03:17:29,000 --> 03:17:30,830
captured
yeah

9970
03:17:30,830 --> 03:17:30,840
yeah
 

9971
03:17:30,840 --> 03:17:34,510
yeah
yeah so that that's what life is is just

9972
03:17:34,510 --> 03:17:34,520
yeah so that that's what life is is just
 

9973
03:17:34,520 --> 03:17:37,990
yeah so that that's what life is is just
uh some novelty generation and you're

9974
03:17:37,990 --> 03:17:38,000
uh some novelty generation and you're
 

9975
03:17:38,000 --> 03:17:40,670
uh some novelty generation and you're
done each one of us just gener a little

9976
03:17:40,670 --> 03:17:40,680
done each one of us just gener a little
 

9977
03:17:40,680 --> 03:17:43,429
done each one of us just gener a little
bit or have the capacity to at least I

9978
03:17:43,429 --> 03:17:43,439
bit or have the capacity to at least I
 

9979
03:17:43,439 --> 03:17:48,790
bit or have the capacity to at least I
think life is a selection produces life

9980
03:17:48,790 --> 03:17:48,800
think life is a selection produces life
 

9981
03:17:48,800 --> 03:17:51,469
think life is a selection produces life
and life affects Universe in the

9982
03:17:51,469 --> 03:17:51,479
and life affects Universe in the
 

9983
03:17:51,479 --> 03:17:52,990
and life affects Universe in the
universes with life in them are

9984
03:17:52,990 --> 03:17:53,000
universes with life in them are
 

9985
03:17:53,000 --> 03:17:55,269
universes with life in them are
materially physically fundamentally

9986
03:17:55,269 --> 03:17:55,279
materially physically fundamentally
 

9987
03:17:55,279 --> 03:17:57,309
materially physically fundamentally
different than universes without life

9988
03:17:57,309 --> 03:17:57,319
different than universes without life
 

9989
03:17:57,319 --> 03:17:59,790
different than universes without life
and that's super interesting and I I

9990
03:17:59,790 --> 03:17:59,800
and that's super interesting and I I
 

9991
03:17:59,800 --> 03:18:02,550
and that's super interesting and I I
have no beginnings of understanding I

9992
03:18:02,550 --> 03:18:02,560
have no beginnings of understanding I
 

9993
03:18:02,560 --> 03:18:04,030
have no beginnings of understanding I
think maybe this is like in a thousand

9994
03:18:04,030 --> 03:18:04,040
think maybe this is like in a thousand
 

9995
03:18:04,040 --> 03:18:05,389
think maybe this is like in a thousand
years there'll be a new discipline in

9996
03:18:05,389 --> 03:18:05,399
years there'll be a new discipline in
 

9997
03:18:05,399 --> 03:18:07,550
years there'll be a new discipline in
the humans we yeah of course this is how

9998
03:18:07,550 --> 03:18:07,560
the humans we yeah of course this is how
 

9999
03:18:07,560 --> 03:18:10,830
the humans we yeah of course this is how
it all works right and um in retrospect

10000
03:18:10,830 --> 03:18:10,840
it all works right and um in retrospect
 

10001
03:18:10,840 --> 03:18:13,510
it all works right and um in retrospect
it will all be obvious I

10002
03:18:13,510 --> 03:18:13,520
it will all be obvious I
 

10003
03:18:13,520 --> 03:18:14,830
it will all be obvious I
I think assembly theory is obvious

10004
03:18:14,830 --> 03:18:14,840
I think assembly theory is obvious
 

10005
03:18:14,840 --> 03:18:16,110
I think assembly theory is obvious
that's why a lot of people got angry

10006
03:18:16,110 --> 03:18:16,120
that's why a lot of people got angry
 

10007
03:18:16,120 --> 03:18:17,590
that's why a lot of people got angry
right they were like oh my God this is

10008
03:18:17,590 --> 03:18:17,600
right they were like oh my God this is
 

10009
03:18:17,600 --> 03:18:20,870
right they were like oh my God this is
such nonsense yeah you know like oh yeah

10010
03:18:20,870 --> 03:18:20,880
such nonsense yeah you know like oh yeah
 

10011
03:18:20,880 --> 03:18:23,030
such nonsense yeah you know like oh yeah
no actually it's not quite but the the

10012
03:18:23,030 --> 03:18:23,040
no actually it's not quite but the the
 

10013
03:18:23,040 --> 03:18:24,670
no actually it's not quite but the the
writing is really

10014
03:18:24,670 --> 03:18:24,680
writing is really
 

10015
03:18:24,680 --> 03:18:27,150
writing is really
bad well I can't wait to see where it

10016
03:18:27,150 --> 03:18:27,160
bad well I can't wait to see where it
 

10017
03:18:27,160 --> 03:18:31,229
bad well I can't wait to see where it
evolves uh Le and I I'm glad I get to
