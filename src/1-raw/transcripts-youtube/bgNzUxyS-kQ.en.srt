repeating i know i now understand what
it means without re-listening to it but

418
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:37,840
it means without re-listening to it but
 

419
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,510
it means without re-listening to it but
just with re-repeating it was like oh

00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:42,960
again michael jackson's man in the
 

423
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,469
again michael jackson's man in the
mirror is uh teaching you that it's your

424
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:46,479
mirror is uh teaching you that it's your
 

425
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,110
mirror is uh teaching you that it's your
responsibility to just improve yourself

426
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,120
responsibility to just improve yourself
 

427
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,390
responsibility to just improve yourself
you know if you want to make the world a

428
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:50,400
you know if you want to make the world a
 

429
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,909
you know if you want to make the world a
better place take a look at yourself and

430
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:51,919
better place take a look at yourself and
 

431
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,230
better place take a look at yourself and
make the change this whole concept of

432
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:54,240
make the change this whole concept of
 

433
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,749
make the change this whole concept of
again i mean all of these songs you can

434
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:55,759
again i mean all of these songs you can
 

435
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,270
again i mean all of these songs you can
listen to them shallowly or you can just

436
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,280
listen to them shallowly or you can just
 

437
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,790
listen to them shallowly or you can just
listen to them and say

438
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:58,800
listen to them and say
 

439
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,790
listen to them and say
oh there's deeper meaning here and i

440
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:00,800
oh there's deeper meaning here and i
 

441
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,270
oh there's deeper meaning here and i
think there's a certain philosophy of of

442
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:03,280
think there's a certain philosophy of of
 

443
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,790
think there's a certain philosophy of of
song as a way of touching the psyche so

444
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:06,800
song as a way of touching the psyche so
 

445
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,230
song as a way of touching the psyche so
if you look at regions of the brain

446
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:08,240
if you look at regions of the brain
 

447
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,990
if you look at regions of the brain
people have lost their language ability

448
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,000
people have lost their language ability
 

449
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,189
people have lost their language ability
because they have an accident in that

450
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:11,199
because they have an accident in that
 

451
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,430
because they have an accident in that
region of the brain can actually

452
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:13,440
region of the brain can actually
 

453
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,869
region of the brain can actually
sing

454
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879
sing
 

455
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,469
sing
because it's exactly the symmetric

456
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:16,479
because it's exactly the symmetric
 

457
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,230
because it's exactly the symmetric
region of the brain

458
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,240
region of the brain
 

459
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,670
region of the brain
and that again teaches you so much about

460
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:19,680
and that again teaches you so much about
 

461
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,350
and that again teaches you so much about
language evolution

462
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:21,360
language evolution
 

463
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,830
language evolution
and sort of the the duality of

464
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:24,840
and sort of the the duality of
 

465
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,670
and sort of the the duality of
musicality and you know rhythmic

466
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:27,680
musicality and you know rhythmic
 

467
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,270
musicality and you know rhythmic
patterns and

468
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:29,280
patterns and
 

469
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,670
patterns and
eventually language do you have a sense

470
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:31,680
eventually language do you have a sense
 

471
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,790
eventually language do you have a sense
of why songs developed so you're kind of

472
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:34,800
of why songs developed so you're kind of
 

473
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,110
of why songs developed so you're kind of
suggesting that it's possible that

474
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,120
suggesting that it's possible that
 

475
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,870
suggesting that it's possible that
there is something important about our

476
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:40,880
there is something important about our
 

477
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,269
there is something important about our
connection with song and with music on

478
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:43,279
connection with song and with music on
 

479
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,710
connection with song and with music on
the level of

480
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:44,720
the level of
 

481
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,230
the level of
the importance of language is it

482
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,240
the importance of language is it
 

483
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,350
the importance of language is it
possible

484
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:47,360
possible
 

485
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,269
possible
it's not just possible in my view

486
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:49,279
it's not just possible in my view
 

487
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,430
it's not just possible in my view
language comes after music language

488
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:51,440
language comes after music language
 

489
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,430
language comes after music language
comes after song no seriously like

490
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:53,440
comes after song no seriously like
 

491
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,509
comes after song no seriously like
basically my view of human cognitive

492
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:55,519
basically my view of human cognitive
 

493
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,710
basically my view of human cognitive
evolution

494
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:56,720
evolution
 

495
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,590
evolution
is

496
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:57,600
is
 

497
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,710
is
rituals

498
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:58,720
rituals
 

499
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,269
rituals
if you look at many early cultures

500
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:01,279
if you look at many early cultures
 

501
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,509
if you look at many early cultures
there's rituals around every stage of

502
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:03,519
there's rituals around every stage of
 

503
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,470
there's rituals around every stage of
life

504
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:04,480
life
 

505
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,150
life
there's organized dance performances

506
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,160
there's organized dance performances
 

507
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,910
there's organized dance performances
around mating

508
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:09,920
around mating
 

509
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,590
around mating
and if you look at mate selection i mean

510
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:11,600
and if you look at mate selection i mean
 

511
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,910
and if you look at mate selection i mean
that's an evolutionary drive right there

512
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:13,920
that's an evolutionary drive right there
 

513
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,350
that's an evolutionary drive right there
so basically if you're not able to

514
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360
so basically if you're not able to
 

515
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,829
so basically if you're not able to
string together a complex dance as a

516
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:17,839
string together a complex dance as a
 

517
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,150
string together a complex dance as a
bird you don't get a mate and that

518
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,160
bird you don't get a mate and that
 

519
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,509
bird you don't get a mate and that
actually forms

520
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:21,519
actually forms
 

521
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,870
actually forms
this development for many song learning

522
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:24,880
this development for many song learning
 

523
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,670
this development for many song learning
birds not every bird knows how to sing

524
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:27,680
birds not every bird knows how to sing
 

525
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,670
birds not every bird knows how to sing
and not every bird knows how to learn a

526
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:29,680
and not every bird knows how to learn a
 

527
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,310
and not every bird knows how to learn a
complicated song so basically there's

528
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:32,320
complicated song so basically there's
 

529
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,870
complicated song so basically there's
birds that simply have the same few

530
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:34,880
birds that simply have the same few
 

531
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,389
birds that simply have the same few
tunes that they know how to play and a

532
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,399
tunes that they know how to play and a
 

533
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,470
tunes that they know how to play and a
lot of that is inherent and genetically

534
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:38,480
lot of that is inherent and genetically
 

535
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,350
lot of that is inherent and genetically
encoded and others are birds that learn

536
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:41,360
encoded and others are birds that learn
 

537
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,550
encoded and others are birds that learn
how to sing

538
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:42,560
how to sing
 

539
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,949
how to sing
and the you know

540
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:44,959
and the you know
 

541
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,470
and the you know
if you look at a lot of these exotic

542
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:46,480
if you look at a lot of these exotic
 

543
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,829
if you look at a lot of these exotic
birds of paradise and stuff like that

544
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:47,839
birds of paradise and stuff like that
 

545
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,910
birds of paradise and stuff like that
like the mating rituals they have are

546
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:49,920
like the mating rituals they have are
 

547
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,150
like the mating rituals they have are
enormously amazing and i think human

548
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,160
enormously amazing and i think human
 

549
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,230
enormously amazing and i think human
mating rituals of you know ancient

550
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,240
mating rituals of you know ancient
 

551
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,630
mating rituals of you know ancient
tribes are not very far off from that

552
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:56,640
tribes are not very far off from that
 

553
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,509
tribes are not very far off from that
and in my view the sequential formation

554
00:09:59,509 --> 00:09:59,519
and in my view the sequential formation
 

555
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,910
and in my view the sequential formation
of these movements

556
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:01,920
of these movements
 

557
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,870
of these movements
is a prelude to the cognitive

558
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:04,880
is a prelude to the cognitive
 

559
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,949
is a prelude to the cognitive
capabilities that ultimately enable

560
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:06,959
capabilities that ultimately enable
 

561
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,069
capabilities that ultimately enable
language

562
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:08,079
language
 

563
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,509
language
and it's fascinating to think that

564
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:09,519
and it's fascinating to think that
 

565
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,670
and it's fascinating to think that
that's uh not just an accidental

566
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:11,680
that's uh not just an accidental
 

567
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,470
that's uh not just an accidental
precursor to intelligence yeah it's uh

568
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:14,480
precursor to intelligence yeah it's uh
 

569
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,550
precursor to intelligence yeah it's uh
sexually selected it's well sexually

570
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:16,560
sexually selected it's well sexually
 

571
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,750
sexually selected it's well sexually
selected and it's a prerequisite yeah

572
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:19,760
selected and it's a prerequisite yeah
 

573
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,670
selected and it's a prerequisite yeah
it's like it's required for intelligence

574
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:21,680
it's like it's required for intelligence
 

575
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,750
it's like it's required for intelligence
and and even as language has now

576
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:23,760
and and even as language has now
 

577
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,870
and and even as language has now
developed

578
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:24,880
developed
 

579
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,350
developed
i think the artistic expression

580
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,360
i think the artistic expression
 

581
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,269
i think the artistic expression
is needed like badly needed by our brain

582
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:31,279
is needed like badly needed by our brain
 

583
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,230
is needed like badly needed by our brain
so it's not just that oh our brain can

584
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,240
so it's not just that oh our brain can
 

585
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,069
so it's not just that oh our brain can
kind of you know take a break and go do

586
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:36,079
kind of you know take a break and go do
 

587
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,550
kind of you know take a break and go do
that stuff no i mean you know i don't

588
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:38,560
that stuff no i mean you know i don't
 

589
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,389
that stuff no i mean you know i don't
know if you remember that scene from oh

590
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:40,399
know if you remember that scene from oh
 

591
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,630
know if you remember that scene from oh
gosh we're certain technical movie in

boy boy uh the shining the shining
 

601
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,310
boy boy uh the shining the shining
so there's this amazing scene where he's

602
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:54,320
so there's this amazing scene where he's
 

603
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,230
so there's this amazing scene where he's
constantly trying to to concentrate and

604
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,240
constantly trying to to concentrate and

typewriters is gibberish
 

609
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,870
typewriters is gibberish
and i have that image as well when i'm

613
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,550
when i'm working and i'm like no
basically all of this crazy you know

614
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
basically all of this crazy you know
 

615
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,389
basically all of this crazy you know
huge number of hobbies that i have

00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:07,920
they're not just
 

619
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,030
they're not just
tolerated by my work they're required by

620
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,040
tolerated by my work they're required by
 

621
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,030
tolerated by my work they're required by
my work this ability of sort of

00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,040
my work this ability of sort of
 

623
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,150
my work this ability of sort of
stretching your brain in all these

624
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
stretching your brain in all these
 

625
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,590
stretching your brain in all these
different directions

626
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:15,600
different directions
 

627
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,790
different directions
is

628
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:16,800
is
 

629
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,550
is
connecting your emotional self and your

630
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:18,560
connecting your emotional self and your
 

631
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,069
connecting your emotional self and your
cognitive self

632
00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:20,079
cognitive self
 

633
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,389
cognitive self
and that's a prerequisite to being able

634
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:22,399
and that's a prerequisite to being able
 

635
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,110
and that's a prerequisite to being able
to be cognitively capable at least in my

636
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,120
to be cognitively capable at least in my
 

637
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,030
to be cognitively capable at least in my
view yeah i wonder if the world without

638
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,040
view yeah i wonder if the world without
 

639
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,710
view yeah i wonder if the world without
art and music

640
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:28,720
art and music
 

641
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,069
art and music
you're just making me realize that

642
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:30,079
you're just making me realize that
 

643
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,870
you're just making me realize that
perhaps that world would be not just

644
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:32,880
perhaps that world would be not just
 

645
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,150
perhaps that world would be not just
devoid of

00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,160
devoid of

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,389
devoid of
fun things to look at or listen to but

flowing so naturally this something it's

1100
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:11,120
flowing so naturally this something it's
 

1101
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,789

there's a rhythm that uh i don't know

1104
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:15,120
there's a rhythm that uh i don't know
 

1105
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,870
there's a rhythm that uh i don't know
what what that is that probably connects

1106
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:16,880
what what that is that probably connects
 

1107
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,470
what what that is that probably connects
to exactly what you're saying if you pay

1108
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:18,480
to exactly what you're saying if you pay
 

1109
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,630

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,430
close attention you will notice that the
more obvious words sometimes are the

1112
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:23,440
more obvious words sometimes are the
 

1113
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,110
more obvious words sometimes are the
second verse

1114
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:25,120
second verse
 

1115
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,110
second verse
and the less obvious are often the first

1116
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,120
and the less obvious are often the first
 

1117
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,070
and the less obvious are often the first
verse

1118
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:28,080
verse
 

1119
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,909
verse
because it makes the second verse flow

1120
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:29,919
because it makes the second verse flow
 

1121
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,590
because it makes the second verse flow
much more naturally

1122
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:31,600
much more naturally
 

1123
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,830
much more naturally
because otherwise it feels contrived oh

1124
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:33,840

2255
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,950
music perspective
let's uh

2256
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:52,960
let's uh
 

2257
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,270
let's uh
talk about life from human life from

2258
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:55,280
talk about life from human life from
 

2259
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,870
talk about life from human life from
perhaps other perspective and it's

2260
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:56,880
perhaps other perspective and it's
 

2261
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,510
perhaps other perspective and it's
meaning so this is episode

2262
00:41:59,510 --> 00:41:59,520
meaning so this is episode
 

2263
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,589
meaning so this is episode
142.

2264
00:42:01,589 --> 00:42:01,599
142.
 

2265
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,390
142.
uh

2266
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:02,400
uh
 

2267
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,550
uh
there is perhaps uh

2268
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:04,560
there is perhaps uh
 

2269
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,430
there is perhaps uh
an absurdly uh

2270
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:07,440
an absurdly uh
 

2271
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,390
an absurdly uh
deep

2272
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:08,400
deep
 

2273
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,510
deep
meaning to the number 42 that uh

2274
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:11,520
meaning to the number 42 that uh
 

2275
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,910
meaning to the number 42 that uh
the our culture has has elevated so this

2276
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:13,920
the our culture has has elevated so this
 

2277
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,670
the our culture has has elevated so this
is a perfect time to talk about the

2278
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:15,680
is a perfect time to talk about the
 

2279
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,510
is a perfect time to talk about the
meaning of life we've talked about it

2280
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:17,520
meaning of life we've talked about it
 

2281
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,190
meaning of life we've talked about it
already but do you think this question

2282
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:21,200
already but do you think this question
 

2283
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,829
already but do you think this question
that's so simple

2284
00:42:23,829 --> 00:42:23,839
that's so simple
 

2285
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,230
that's so simple
and so seemingly absurd

2286
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:26,240
and so seemingly absurd
 

2287
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,109
and so seemingly absurd
has value of what is the meaning of life

2288
00:42:29,109 --> 00:42:29,119
has value of what is the meaning of life
 

2289
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:30,790
has value of what is the meaning of life
is it something

2290
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:30,800
is it something
 

2291
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,309
is it something
that

2292
00:42:32,309 --> 00:42:32,319
that
 

2293
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,750
that
raising the question and trying to

2294
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:33,760
raising the question and trying to
 

2295
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,870
raising the question and trying to
answer it

2296
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:34,880
answer it
 

2297
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,870
answer it
is that a ridiculous pursuit or is this

2298
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:36,880
is that a ridiculous pursuit or is this
 

2299
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,270
is that a ridiculous pursuit or is this
some value is it answerable at all

2300
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:39,280
some value is it answerable at all
 

2301
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,510
some value is it answerable at all
so first of all i i feel that we owe it

2302
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:41,520
so first of all i i feel that we owe it
 

2303
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,910
so first of all i i feel that we owe it
to your listeners to say why 42 sure

2304
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:45,920
to your listeners to say why 42 sure
 

2305
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,430
to your listeners to say why 42 sure
so of course the hitchhiker's guide to

2306
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:47,440
so of course the hitchhiker's guide to
 

2307
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,790
so of course the hitchhiker's guide to
the galaxy came up with 42 as basically

2308
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:50,800
the galaxy came up with 42 as basically
 

2309
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,910
the galaxy came up with 42 as basically
a random number just you know

2310
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:53,920
a random number just you know
 

2311
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,430
a random number just you know
the author just pulled it out of a hat

2312
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:55,440
the author just pulled it out of a hat
 

2313
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,589
the author just pulled it out of a hat
and he's admitted so he said mile 42

2314
00:42:57,589 --> 00:42:57,599
and he's admitted so he said mile 42
 

2315
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:58,950
and he's admitted so he said mile 42
just seemed like

2316
00:42:58,950 --> 00:42:58,960
just seemed like
 

2317
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,270
just seemed like
just random numbers any

2318
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:01,280
just random numbers any
 

2319
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,430
just random numbers any
but in fact there's many numbers that

2320
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:03,440
but in fact there's many numbers that
 

2321
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,230
but in fact there's many numbers that
are linked to 42. so

2322
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:06,240
are linked to 42. so
 

2323
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,710
are linked to 42. so
42 again just just to summarize is the

2324
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:10,720
42 again just just to summarize is the
 

2325
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,750
42 again just just to summarize is the
answer that these super mega computer

2326
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:13,760
answer that these super mega computer
 

2327
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,750
answer that these super mega computer
that had computed for a million years

2328
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:15,760
that had computed for a million years
 

2329
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,190
that had computed for a million years
with the most powerful computer in the

2330
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:17,200
with the most powerful computer in the
 

2331
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,750
with the most powerful computer in the
world had come up with at some point the

2332
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:19,760
world had come up with at some point the
 

2333
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,829
world had come up with at some point the
computer says um

2334
00:43:21,829 --> 00:43:21,839
computer says um
 

2335
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:23,270
computer says um
i have an answer

2336
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:23,280
i have an answer
 

2337
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,309
i have an answer
and they're like

2338
00:43:24,309 --> 00:43:24,319
and they're like
 

2339
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:25,190
and they're like
what

2340
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:25,200
what
 

2341
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,030
what
it's like you're not going to like it

2342
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,040
it's like you're not going to like it
 

2343
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,230
it's like you're not going to like it
like what is it it's 42.

2344
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:30,240
like what is it it's 42.
 

2345
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,990
like what is it it's 42.
and then the irony is that they had

2346
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:32,000
and then the irony is that they had
 

2347
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,430
and then the irony is that they had
forgotten of course what the question

2348
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:33,440
forgotten of course what the question
 

2349
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,710
forgotten of course what the question
was yes

2350
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:34,720
was yes
 

2351
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,910
was yes
so now they have to build a bigger

2352
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:35,920
so now they have to build a bigger
 

2353
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,030
so now they have to build a bigger
computer to figure out what the question

2354
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:37,040
computer to figure out what the question
 

2355
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,470
computer to figure out what the question
was the question to which the answer is

2356
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:38,480
was the question to which the answer is
 

2357
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,069
was the question to which the answer is
42. so as i was turning 42 i basically

2358
00:43:42,069 --> 00:43:42,079
42. so as i was turning 42 i basically
 

2359
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,710
42. so as i was turning 42 i basically
sort of researched uh why 42 is such a

2360
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:44,720
sort of researched uh why 42 is such a
 

2361
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,589
sort of researched uh why 42 is such a
cool number and it turns out that and i

2362
00:43:47,589 --> 00:43:47,599
cool number and it turns out that and i
 

2363
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:48,870
cool number and it turns out that and i
put together this little passage that

2364
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:48,880
put together this little passage that
 

2365
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,910
put together this little passage that
was explaining to all those guests to my

2366
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:51,920
was explaining to all those guests to my
 

2367
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,589
was explaining to all those guests to my
42nd birthday party why we were talking

2368
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:53,599
42nd birthday party why we were talking
 

2369
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:54,870
42nd birthday party why we were talking
about the meaning of life

2370
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:54,880
about the meaning of life
 

2371
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,069
about the meaning of life
and

2372
00:43:56,069 --> 00:43:56,079
and
 

2373
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:58,950
and
basically talked about how 42 is the

2374
00:43:58,950 --> 00:43:58,960
basically talked about how 42 is the
 

2375
00:43:58,960 --> 00:43:59,910
basically talked about how 42 is the
angle

2376
00:43:59,910 --> 00:43:59,920
angle
 

2377
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,190
angle
at which light reflects off of water to

2378
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:03,200
at which light reflects off of water to
 

2379
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,589
at which light reflects off of water to
create a rainbow

2380
00:44:05,589 --> 00:44:05,599
create a rainbow
 

2381
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,109
create a rainbow
and it's so beautiful because the

2382
00:44:07,109 --> 00:44:07,119
and it's so beautiful because the
 

2383
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,430
and it's so beautiful because the
rainbow is basically the combination of

2384
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:09,440
rainbow is basically the combination of
 

2385
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,030
rainbow is basically the combination of
sort of it's been raining but there's

2386
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:11,040
sort of it's been raining but there's
 

2387
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,349
sort of it's been raining but there's
hope because the sun just came out it's

2388
00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:13,359
hope because the sun just came out it's
 

2389
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,430
hope because the sun just came out it's
a very beautiful number there so 42 is

2390
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:15,440
a very beautiful number there so 42 is
 

2391
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,829
a very beautiful number there so 42 is
also the sum of all rows and columns of

2392
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:17,839
also the sum of all rows and columns of
 

2393
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:19,829
also the sum of all rows and columns of
a magic cube that contains all

2394
00:44:19,829 --> 00:44:19,839
a magic cube that contains all
 

2395
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,550
a magic cube that contains all
consecutive integers starting at one

2396
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:22,560
consecutive integers starting at one
 

2397
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,069
consecutive integers starting at one
so basically if you if you take all

2398
00:44:24,069 --> 00:44:24,079
so basically if you if you take all
 

2399
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,069
so basically if you if you take all
integers between one and however many

2400
00:44:26,069 --> 00:44:26,079
integers between one and however many
 

2401
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,150
integers between one and however many
vertices there are the sums is always

2402
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:28,160
vertices there are the sums is always
 

2403
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,750
vertices there are the sums is always
42.

2404
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:29,760
42.
 

2405
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,790
42.
42 is the only number

2406
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:32,800
42 is the only number
 

2407
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,670
42 is the only number
left under 100 for which the equation of

2408
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:35,680
left under 100 for which the equation of
 

2409
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,750
left under 100 for which the equation of
x to the cube plus y to the q plus z to

2410
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:37,760
x to the cube plus y to the q plus z to
 

2411
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,589
x to the cube plus y to the q plus z to
the cube is n

2412
00:44:39,589 --> 00:44:39,599
the cube is n
 

2413
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,910
the cube is n

leading to the enlightenment

2576
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:29,440
leading to the enlightenment
 

2577
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,309
leading to the enlightenment
a yeast cell which is uh called a single

2578
00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:32,319
a yeast cell which is uh called a single
 

2579
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:34,230
a yeast cell which is uh called a single
cell eukaryote and the subject of my phd

2580
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:34,240
cell eukaryote and the subject of my phd
 

2581
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,990
cell eukaryote and the subject of my phd
research has exactly 42 million proteins

2582
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:38,000
research has exactly 42 million proteins
 

2583
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,309
research has exactly 42 million proteins
anyway so so there's seriously you're on

2584
00:47:40,309 --> 00:47:40,319
anyway so so there's seriously you're on
 

2585
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,030
anyway so so there's seriously you're on
fire with this these are really good so

2586
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:43,040
fire with this these are really good so
 

2587
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,150
fire with this these are really good so
i guess what you're saying is just a

2588
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:44,160
i guess what you're saying is just a
 

2589
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,589
i guess what you're saying is just a
random number

2590
00:47:45,589 --> 00:47:45,599
random number
 

2591
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:47,270
random number
yeah basically

2592
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:47,280
yeah basically
 

2593
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,670
yeah basically
so all of these are acronyms so you know

2594
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:49,680
so all of these are acronyms so you know
 

2595
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,870
so all of these are acronyms so you know
after you have the number you figure out

2596
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:50,880
after you have the number you figure out
 

2597
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,829
after you have the number you figure out
why that don't work so anyway so uh now

2598
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:53,839
why that don't work so anyway so uh now
 

2599
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:56,710
why that don't work so anyway so uh now
that we've spoken about why 42 uh why do

2600
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:56,720
that we've spoken about why 42 uh why do
 

2601
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,230
that we've spoken about why 42 uh why do
we search for meaning

2602
00:47:58,230 --> 00:47:58,240
we search for meaning
 

2603
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,470
we search for meaning
and uh you're asking you know will that

2604
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:00,480
and uh you're asking you know will that
 

2605
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,910
and uh you're asking you know will that
search ultimately lead to our

2606
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:01,920
search ultimately lead to our
 

2607
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,990
search ultimately lead to our
destruction and my my thinking is

2608
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:04,000
destruction and my my thinking is
 

2609
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,230
destruction and my my thinking is
exactly the opposite so basically that

2610
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:06,240
exactly the opposite so basically that
 

2611
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,190
exactly the opposite so basically that
asking

2612
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:07,200
asking
 

2613
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,670
asking
about meaning is something that's so

2614
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:09,680
about meaning is something that's so
 

2615
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,750
about meaning is something that's so
inherent to human nature it's something

2616
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:11,760
inherent to human nature it's something
 

2617
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,069
inherent to human nature it's something
that makes life beautiful that makes it

2618
00:48:14,069 --> 00:48:14,079
that makes life beautiful that makes it
 

2619
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,150
that makes life beautiful that makes it
worth living and that searching for

2620
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:16,160
worth living and that searching for
 

2621
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,790
worth living and that searching for
meaning is actually the point it's not

2622
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:18,800
meaning is actually the point it's not
 

2623
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,470
meaning is actually the point it's not
defining it i think when you found it

2624
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:20,480
defining it i think when you found it
 

2625
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,150
defining it i think when you found it
you're dead

2626
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:22,160
you're dead
 

2627
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:25,190
you're dead
yeah don't don't ever be satisfied that

2628
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:25,200
yeah don't don't ever be satisfied that
 

2629
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,589
yeah don't don't ever be satisfied that
you know i've got it so i like to say

2630
00:48:27,589 --> 00:48:27,599
you know i've got it so i like to say
 

2631
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,910
you know i've got it so i like to say
that life is lived forward

2632
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:29,920
that life is lived forward
 

2633
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,150
that life is lived forward
but it only makes sense backward

2634
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:32,160
but it only makes sense backward
 

2635
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,549
but it only makes sense backward
and i don't remember whose quote that is

2636
00:48:34,549 --> 00:48:34,559
and i don't remember whose quote that is
 

2637
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,349
and i don't remember whose quote that is
but

2638
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:35,359
but
 

2639
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:38,069
but
the the the whole search itself

2640
00:48:38,069 --> 00:48:38,079
the the the whole search itself
 

2641
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:39,589
the the the whole search itself
is the meaning

2642
00:48:39,589 --> 00:48:39,599
is the meaning
 

2643
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,270
is the meaning
and what i love about it is that

2644
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:43,280
and what i love about it is that
 

2645
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,109
and what i love about it is that
there's a double search going on there's

2646
00:48:45,109 --> 00:48:45,119
there's a double search going on there's
 

2647
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,230
there's a double search going on there's
a search in every one of us through our

2648
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:48,240
a search in every one of us through our
 

2649
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,630
a search in every one of us through our
own lives to find meaning

2650
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:50,640
own lives to find meaning
 

2651
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,470
own lives to find meaning
and then there's a search which is

2652
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:52,480
and then there's a search which is
 

2653
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,790
and then there's a search which is
happening for humanity itself

2654
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:54,800
happening for humanity itself
 

2655
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,790
happening for humanity itself
to find our meaning

2656
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:56,800
to find our meaning
 

2657
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,150
to find our meaning
and

2658
00:48:58,150 --> 00:48:58,160
and
 

2659
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,270
and
we as humans like to look at animals and

2660
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:01,280
we as humans like to look at animals and
 

2661
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,030
we as humans like to look at animals and
say of course they have a meaning

2662
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:03,040
say of course they have a meaning
 

2663
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,190
say of course they have a meaning
like a dog has its meaning it's just a

2664
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:05,200
like a dog has its meaning it's just a
 

2665
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,190
like a dog has its meaning it's just a
bunch of instincts you know running

2666
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:07,200
bunch of instincts you know running
 

2667
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,630
bunch of instincts you know running
around loving everything

2668
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:08,640
around loving everything
 

2669
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,710
around loving everything
um you know remember a joke with a cat

2670

so so
 

2677
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,750
so so
um and i i'm noticing the yin yang

2678
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:19,760
um and i i'm noticing the yin yang
 

2679
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,670
um and i i'm noticing the yin yang
symbol right here with this whole panda

2680
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:21,680
symbol right here with this whole panda
 

2681
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,430
symbol right here with this whole panda
black and white and the zero one zero

2682
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:23,440
black and white and the zero one zero
 

2683
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,670
black and white and the zero one zero
one five with that 42. some of those are

2684
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:25,680
one five with that 42. some of those are
 

2685
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,430
one five with that 42. some of those are
gold ascii value for uh the star symbol

2686
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:29,440
gold ascii value for uh the star symbol
 

2687
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,790
gold ascii value for uh the star symbol
damn anyway so so basically in my view

2688
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:32,800
damn anyway so so basically in my view
 

2689
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,190
damn anyway so so basically in my view
the the search for meaning and the act

2690
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:35,200
the the search for meaning and the act
 

2691
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,150
the the search for meaning and the act
of

2692
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:36,160
of
 

2693
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,750
of
uh searching for something more

2694
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:37,760
uh searching for something more
 

2695
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,270
uh searching for something more
meaningful

2696
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:39,280
meaningful
 

2697
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,790
meaningful
is

2698
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:40,800
is
 

2699
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,430
is
life's meaning by itself but the fact

2700
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:43,440
life's meaning by itself but the fact
 

2701
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,829
life's meaning by itself but the fact
that we kind of always hope that yes

2702
00:49:45,829 --> 00:49:45,839
that we kind of always hope that yes
 

2703
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:47,910
that we kind of always hope that yes
maybe for animals that's not the case

2704
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:47,920
maybe for animals that's not the case
 

2705
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,309
maybe for animals that's not the case
but maybe humans have something that we

2706
00:49:50,309 --> 00:49:50,319
but maybe humans have something that we
 

2707
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,150
but maybe humans have something that we
should be doing and something else and

2708
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:52,160
should be doing and something else and
 

2709
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,750
should be doing and something else and
it's not just about procreation it's not

2710
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:53,760
it's not just about procreation it's not
 

2711
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,790
it's not just about procreation it's not
just about

2712
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:54,800
just about
 

2713
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,710
just about
dominance it's not just about strength

2714
00:49:56,710 --> 00:49:56,720
dominance it's not just about strength
 

2715
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,109
dominance it's not just about strength
and feeding et cetera like we're the one

2716
00:49:59,109 --> 00:49:59,119
and feeding et cetera like we're the one
 

2717
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:00,950
and feeding et cetera like we're the one
species that spends such a tiny little

2718
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:00,960
species that spends such a tiny little
 

2719
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,349
species that spends such a tiny little
minority of its time feeding

2720
00:50:03,349 --> 00:50:03,359
minority of its time feeding
 

2721
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:06,309
minority of its time feeding
that we have this enormous you know huge

2722
00:50:06,309 --> 00:50:06,319
that we have this enormous you know huge
 

2723
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,630
that we have this enormous you know huge
cognitive capability

2724
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:08,640
cognitive capability
 

2725
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,990
cognitive capability
that we can just use for all kinds of

2726
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:10,000
that we can just use for all kinds of
 

2727
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,030
that we can just use for all kinds of
other stuff

2728
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:11,040
other stuff
 

2729
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,030
other stuff
and that's where art comes in that's

2730
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:13,040
and that's where art comes in that's
 

2731
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,910
and that's where art comes in that's
where you know the healthy mind comes in

2732
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:15,920
where you know the healthy mind comes in
 

2733
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,589
where you know the healthy mind comes in
with you know exploring all of these

2734
00:50:17,589 --> 00:50:17,599
with you know exploring all of these
 

2735
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:19,190
with you know exploring all of these
different aspects that are just not

2736
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:19,200
different aspects that are just not
 

2737
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,710
different aspects that are just not
directly tied

2738
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:20,720
directly tied
 

2739
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,870
directly tied
to um

2740
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:22,880
to um
 

2741
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,790
to um
to a purpose that's not directly tied to

2742
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:24,800
to a purpose that's not directly tied to
 

2743
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,950
to a purpose that's not directly tied to
a function it's really just the the

2744
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:26,960
a function it's really just the the
 

2745
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,990
a function it's really just the the
playing of life the you know

2746
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:30,000
playing of life the you know
 

2747
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,309
playing of life the you know
not not for particular reason

2748
00:50:32,309 --> 00:50:32,319
not not for particular reason
 

2749
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,790
not not for particular reason
do you think this thing we got this this

2750
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:34,800
do you think this thing we got this this
 

2751
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,230
do you think this thing we got this this
mind

2752
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:36,240
mind
 

2753
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,589
mind
is unique in the universe

2754
00:50:39,589 --> 00:50:39,599
is unique in the universe
 

2755
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,150
is unique in the universe
in terms of how difficult it is to build

2756
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:42,160
in terms of how difficult it is to build
 

2757
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,270
in terms of how difficult it is to build
so

2758
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:43,280
so
 

2759
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,990
so
is it possible that we're the

2760
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:46,000
is it possible that we're the
 

2761
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,670
is it possible that we're the
the most beautiful thing that the

2762
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:47,680
the most beautiful thing that the
 

2763
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,670
the most beautiful thing that the
universe has constructed

2764
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:49,680
universe has constructed
 

2765
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,030
universe has constructed
both the most beautiful the most ugly

2766
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:51,040
both the most beautiful the most ugly
 

2767
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,190
both the most beautiful the most ugly
but certainly the most complex so look

2768
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:53,200
but certainly the most complex so look
 

2769
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,670
but certainly the most complex so look
at evolutionary time uh the dinosaurs

2770
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:55,680
at evolutionary time uh the dinosaurs
 

2771
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,790
at evolutionary time uh the dinosaurs
ruled the earth for 135 million years

2772
00:50:58,790 --> 00:50:58,800
ruled the earth for 135 million years
 

2773
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,950
ruled the earth for 135 million years
we've been around for a million years

2774
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:02,960

 

2775
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,069

so

2776
00:51:04,069 --> 00:51:04,079
so
 

2777
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,870
so
one versus 135. so dinosaurs were

2778
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:06,880
one versus 135. so dinosaurs were
 

2779
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,470
one versus 135. so dinosaurs were
extinct you know about 60 million years

2780
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:08,480
extinct you know about 60 million years
 

2781
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,230
extinct you know about 60 million years
ago and mammals that had been happily

2782
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:10,240
ago and mammals that had been happily
 

2783
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,470
ago and mammals that had been happily
evolving as tiny little creatures for 30

2784
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:12,480
evolving as tiny little creatures for 30
 

2785
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,549
evolving as tiny little creatures for 30
million years then took over the planet

2786
00:51:14,549 --> 00:51:14,559
million years then took over the planet
 

2787
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,549
million years then took over the planet
and then you know dramatically radiated

2788
00:51:16,549 --> 00:51:16,559
and then you know dramatically radiated
 

2789
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,950
and then you know dramatically radiated
about 60 million years ago

2790
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:18,960
about 60 million years ago
 

2791
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,190
about 60 million years ago
out of these mammals came the neocortex

2792
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:23,200
out of these mammals came the neocortex
 

2793
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,510
out of these mammals came the neocortex
formation so basically the the neocortex

2794
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:25,520
formation so basically the the neocortex
 

2795
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,030
formation so basically the the neocortex
which is sort of the outer layer of our

2796
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:27,040
which is sort of the outer layer of our
 

2797
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:27,910
which is sort of the outer layer of our
brain

2798
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:27,920
brain
 

2799
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,430
brain
compared to our quote-unquote reptilian

2800
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:29,440
compared to our quote-unquote reptilian
 

2801
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,190
compared to our quote-unquote reptilian
brain which we share the structure of

2802
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:31,200
brain which we share the structure of
 

2803
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,589
brain which we share the structure of
with all of the dinosaurs they didn't

2804
00:51:33,589 --> 00:51:33,599
with all of the dinosaurs they didn't
 

2805
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:35,829
with all of the dinosaurs they didn't
have that and yet they ruled the planet

2806
00:51:35,829 --> 00:51:35,839
have that and yet they ruled the planet
 

2807
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:38,309
have that and yet they ruled the planet
so how many other planets have still you

2808
00:51:38,309 --> 00:51:38,319
so how many other planets have still you
 

2809
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:41,430
so how many other planets have still you
know mindless dinosaurs where strength

2810
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:41,440
know mindless dinosaurs where strength
 

2811
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,510
know mindless dinosaurs where strength
was the only dimension

2812
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:43,520
was the only dimension
 

2813
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,430
was the only dimension
uh ruling the planet

2814
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:45,440
uh ruling the planet
 

2815
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,470
uh ruling the planet
so

2816
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:46,480
so
 

2817
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,750
so
there was something weird that

2818
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:47,760
there was something weird that
 

2819
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,670
there was something weird that
annihilated the dinosaurs and again you

2820
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:49,680
annihilated the dinosaurs and again you
 

2821
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,430
annihilated the dinosaurs and again you
could look at biblical things of sort of

2822
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:51,440
could look at biblical things of sort of
 

2823
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,270
could look at biblical things of sort of
god coming and wiping out his creatures

2824
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:53,280
god coming and wiping out his creatures
 

2825
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,030
god coming and wiping out his creatures
and yes to make room for the next ones

2826
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:55,040
and yes to make room for the next ones
 

2827
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,470
and yes to make room for the next ones
so

2828
00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:56,480
so
 

2829
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,549
so
the mammals basically sort of took off

2830
00:51:58,549 --> 00:51:58,559
the mammals basically sort of took off
 

2831
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:00,710
the mammals basically sort of took off
the planet and then grew

2832
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:00,720
the planet and then grew
 

2833
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,069
the planet and then grew
this cognitive capability of this

2834
00:52:04,069 --> 00:52:04,079
this cognitive capability of this
 

2835
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,150
this cognitive capability of this
general-purpose machine

2836
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:06,160
general-purpose machine
 

2837
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,790
general-purpose machine
and primates

2838
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:08,800
and primates
 

2839
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,270
and primates
push that to extreme and humans among

2840
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:11,280
push that to extreme and humans among
 

2841
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,549
push that to extreme and humans among
primates have just exploded that

2842
00:52:14,549 --> 00:52:14,559
primates have just exploded that
 

2843
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:17,030
primates have just exploded that
hardware but that hardware

2844
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:17,040

2845
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,549

if you look at
human cognition

2864
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:40,720
human cognition
 

2865
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,589
human cognition
it's gone down a weird evolutionary path

2866
00:52:43,589 --> 00:52:43,599
it's gone down a weird evolutionary path
 

2867
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:45,750
it's gone down a weird evolutionary path
in the sense that

2868
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:45,760
in the sense that
 

2869
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,589
in the sense that
we are expending an enormous amount of

enormously more energy consuming
so and if you look at just the sheer

so and if you look at just the sheer

and
 

2915
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,309
and

kill the mother at every birth so
 

2917
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,870
kill the mother at every birth so
but yet the fault continued effectively

uh context in which this was made
 

2925
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,990

is enormously fascinating and it has to

00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:54,000
is enormously fascinating and it has to
 

2927
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,309
is enormously fascinating and it has to

do with
 

2929
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:58,390
do with
other humans that we have now killed off

2930
00:53:58,390 --> 00:53:58,400
other humans that we have now killed off
 

2931
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,309
other humans that we have now killed off
or that have gone extinct

2932
00:54:00,309 --> 00:54:00,319
or that have gone extinct
 

2933
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:03,109
or that have gone extinct
and that has now created this weird

2934
00:54:03,109 --> 00:54:03,119
and that has now created this weird
 

2935
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:05,670
and that has now created this weird
place of humans on the planet as the

00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:05,680
place of humans on the planet as the
 

2937

so that can basically make us think that

2942
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:10,480
so that can basically make us think that
 

2943
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,990
so that can basically make us think that
there's something very weird and unique

there's something very weird and unique
 

2945
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,349
there's something very weird and unique
that happened in human evolution that

that happened in human evolution that

may have come before i was able to

00:55:22,549 --> 00:55:22,559
may have come before i was able to

may have come before i was able to

create a

personal mental model of how do i think
 

3015
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,470
personal mental model of how do i think
so this introspection probably came

3016
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:28,480
so this introspection probably came
 

3017
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,589
so this introspection probably came
after

3018
00:55:29,589 --> 00:55:29,599
after
 

3019
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:31,430
after
this sort of

00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:31,440
this sort of
 

3021
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,510
this sort of
projection and this empathy which

3022
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:33,520
projection and this empathy which
 

3023
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,390
projection and this empathy which
basically means you know passion pathos

3024
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:36,400
basically means you know passion pathos
 

3025
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,589
basically means you know passion pathos

3027
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:39,670
suffering
but basically sensing so basically

3028
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:39,680
but basically sensing so basically
 

3029
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,589
but basically sensing so basically
empathy means feeling what you're

3030
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:41,599
empathy means feeling what you're
 

3031
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:42,549
empathy means feeling what you're

trying to project your emotional state

trying to project your emotional state

trying to project your emotional state
onto my cognitive apparatus

3036
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:47,440
onto my cognitive apparatus
 

3037
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,870
onto my cognitive apparatus
and i think that

3038
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:48,880
and i think that
 

3039
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:49,990
and i think that
is

3040
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:50,000
is
 

3041
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,230
is
what eventually led to

3042
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:52,240
what eventually led to
 

3043
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,270
what eventually led to
this enormous cognitive explosion that

3044
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:55,280
this enormous cognitive explosion that
 

3045
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,990
this enormous cognitive explosion that
happened in humanity so

3046
00:55:57,990 --> 00:55:58,000
happened in humanity so
 

3047
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,270
happened in humanity so
you know

3048
00:55:59,270 --> 00:55:59,280
you know
 

3049
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,670
you know
life itself in my view is

3050
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:01,680
life itself in my view is
 

3051
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,230
life itself in my view is
inevitable on every planet inevitable

3052
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:04,240
inevitable on every planet inevitable

inevitable
 

3055
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:07,589
inevitable
but the evolution of life to

3056
00:56:07,589 --> 00:56:07,599
but the evolution of life to
 

3057
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:10,230
but the evolution of life to
self-awareness and cognition and all the

3058
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:10,240
self-awareness and cognition and all the
 

3059
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,630
self-awareness and cognition and all the
incredible things that humans have done

3060
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:12,640
incredible things that humans have done
 

3061
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,470
incredible things that humans have done
you know that might not be as inevitable

3062
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:14,480
you know that might not be as inevitable
 

3063
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,789
you know that might not be as inevitable
that's your intuition so uh if you were

3064
00:56:16,789 --> 00:56:16,799
that's your intuition so uh if you were
 

3065
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:19,270
that's your intuition so uh if you were
to sort of uh estimate and bet some

3066
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:19,280
to sort of uh estimate and bet some
 

3067
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,430
to sort of uh estimate and bet some
money on it if we

3068
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:21,440
money on it if we
 

3069
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,430
money on it if we
re-ran earth

3070
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:23,440
re-ran earth
 

3071
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,150
re-ran earth
a million times

3072
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:26,160
a million times
 

3073
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,470
a million times
would what we got now be the most

3074
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:28,480
would what we got now be the most
 

3075
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,870
would what we got now be the most
special thing and how often would it be

3076
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:30,880
special thing and how often would it be
 

3077
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:31,670
special thing and how often would it be
so

3078
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:31,680
so
 

3079
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,670
so
scientifically speaking how repeatable

3080
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:33,680
scientifically speaking how repeatable
 

3081
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,230
scientifically speaking how repeatable
is this experiment

3082
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:36,240
is this experiment
 

3083
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:40,470
is this experiment
so this whole cognitive revolution yes

3084
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:40,480
so this whole cognitive revolution yes
 

3085
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,829
so this whole cognitive revolution yes
maybe not

3086
00:56:41,829 --> 00:56:41,839
maybe not
 

3087
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:43,430
maybe not
maybe not basically

3088
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:43,440
maybe not basically
 

3089
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:47,270
maybe not basically
i feel that the longevity of

3090
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:47,280
i feel that the longevity of
 

3091
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,430
i feel that the longevity of
you know dinosaurs

3092
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:49,440
you know dinosaurs
 

3093
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,870
you know dinosaurs
suggests that it was not quite

3094
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:50,880
suggests that it was not quite
 

3095
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,030
suggests that it was not quite
inevitable that we uh

3096
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:53,040
inevitable that we uh
 

3097
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,109
inevitable that we uh
that we humans eventually

3098
00:56:55,109 --> 00:56:55,119
that we humans eventually
 

3099
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:56,549
that we humans eventually
uh made it

3100
00:56:56,549 --> 00:56:56,559
uh made it
 

3101
00:56:56,559 --> 00:56:59,109
uh made it
what you're also implying one thing here

3102
00:56:59,109 --> 00:56:59,119
what you're also implying one thing here
 

3103
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:00,549
what you're also implying one thing here
you're saying you're implying that

3104
00:57:00,549 --> 00:57:00,559
you're saying you're implying that
 

3105
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:03,510
you're saying you're implying that
humans also don't have this longevity

3106
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:03,520
humans also don't have this longevity
 

3107
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,270
humans also don't have this longevity
this is the interesting question so with

3108
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:05,280
this is the interesting question so with
 

3109
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,710
this is the interesting question so with
the fermi paradox the idea that the

3110
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:08,720
the fermi paradox the idea that the
 

3111
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,309
the fermi paradox the idea that the
basic question is like

3112
00:57:10,309 --> 00:57:10,319
basic question is like
 

3113
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:13,430
basic question is like
if if the universe has a lot of uh alien

3114
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:13,440
if if the universe has a lot of uh alien
 

3115
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,349
if if the universe has a lot of uh alien
life forms in it why haven't we seen

3116
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:15,359
life forms in it why haven't we seen
 

3117
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:18,069
life forms in it why haven't we seen
them yeah and one thought is that there

3118
00:57:18,069 --> 00:57:18,079
them yeah and one thought is that there
 

3119
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,150
them yeah and one thought is that there
is a great filter or multiple great

3120
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:20,160
is a great filter or multiple great
 

3121
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,510
is a great filter or multiple great
filters that basically would destroy

3122
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:23,520
filters that basically would destroy
 

3123
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,750
filters that basically would destroy
intelligent civilizations like we this

3124
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:25,760
intelligent civilizations like we this
 

3125
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:26,950
intelligent civilizations like we this
thing that we you know this

3126
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:26,960
thing that we you know this
 

3127
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,510
thing that we you know this
multi-folding brain that can keeps

3128
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:29,520
multi-folding brain that can keeps
 

3129
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,069
multi-folding brain that can keeps
growing may not be such a big feature it

3130
00:57:32,069 --> 00:57:32,079
growing may not be such a big feature it
 

3131
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:34,230
growing may not be such a big feature it
might be useful for survival

3132
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:34,240
might be useful for survival
 

3133
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,470
might be useful for survival
but it like takes us

3134
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:36,480
but it like takes us
 

3135
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,750
but it like takes us
down a uh side road that is a very short

3136
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:39,760
down a uh side road that is a very short
 

3137
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,349
down a uh side road that is a very short
one with a quick dead end what do you

3138
00:57:41,349 --> 00:57:41,359
one with a quick dead end what do you
 

3139
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:43,030
one with a quick dead end what do you
think about that so

3140
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:43,040
think about that so
 

3141
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,510
think about that so
i think the universe is enormous

3142
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:45,520
i think the universe is enormous
 

3143
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:50,069
i think the universe is enormous
not just in space but also in time

3144
00:57:50,069 --> 00:57:50,079

 

3145
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,030

and

3146
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:51,040
and
 

3147
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:51,910
and
the

3148
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:51,920
the
 

3149
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,309
the
the pretense that you know the last

3150
00:57:54,309 --> 00:57:54,319
the pretense that you know the last
 

3151
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:57,270
the pretense that you know the last
blink of an instant that we've been able

3152
00:57:57,270 --> 00:57:57,280
blink of an instant that we've been able
 

3153
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,270
blink of an instant that we've been able
to send radio waves is when somebody

3154
00:57:59,270 --> 00:57:59,280
to send radio waves is when somebody
 

3155
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,470
to send radio waves is when somebody
should have been paying attention to our

3156
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:00,480
should have been paying attention to our
 

3157
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,510
should have been paying attention to our
planet

3158
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:01,520
planet
 

3159
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,829
planet
he's a little ridiculous

3160
00:58:03,829 --> 00:58:03,839
he's a little ridiculous
 

3161
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:06,069
he's a little ridiculous
so my you know what i love about star

3162
00:58:06,069 --> 00:58:06,079
so my you know what i love about star
 

3163
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:09,750
so my you know what i love about star
wars yes is a long long time ago in a

3164
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:09,760
wars yes is a long long time ago in a
 

3165
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,190
wars yes is a long long time ago in a
galaxy far far away it's not like some

3166
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:11,200
galaxy far far away it's not like some
 

3167

distant future it's a long long time ago
 

3169
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:14,950
distant future it's a long long time ago
what i love about it is that basically

3170
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:14,960
what i love about it is that basically
 

3171
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:15,910
what i love about it is that basically

you know evolution and civilization
 

3175
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:21,750
you know evolution and civilization
are just so recent

3176
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:21,760
are just so recent
 

3177
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:22,390
are just so recent

you know on earth like there's countless
 

3181
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,990
you know on earth like there's countless
other planets that have probably all

3182
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:26,000
other planets that have probably all
 

3183
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,670
other planets that have probably all
kinds of life forms

but
 

3189
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:35,349
but
the fact that humanity has only been

means that any of these
 

3197
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:43,109
means that any of these
you know alien civilizations would need

3198
00:58:43,109 --> 00:58:43,119
you know alien civilizations would need
 

3199
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:44,789
you know alien civilizations would need
to be paying attention to every single

3200
00:58:44,789 --> 00:58:44,799
to be paying attention to every single
 

3201
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:47,190
to be paying attention to every single
insignificant planet out there

3202

insignificant planet out there
 

3203
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,589
insignificant planet out there
and you know again i mean the movie

3204
00:58:49,589 --> 00:58:49,599
and you know again i mean the movie
 

3205
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:51,829
and you know again i mean the movie
contact and the book is just so

3206
00:58:51,829 --> 00:58:51,839
contact and the book is just so
 

3207
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:53,910
contact and the book is just so
beautiful this whole concept of we don't

3208
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:53,920
beautiful this whole concept of we don't
 

3209
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,430
beautiful this whole concept of we don't
need to travel

3210
00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:55,440
need to travel
 

3211
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,910
need to travel
physically we can travel as light we can

3212
00:58:57,910 --> 00:58:57,920
physically we can travel as light we can
 

3213
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,150
physically we can travel as light we can
send instructions for people to create

3214
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:00,160
send instructions for people to create
 

3215

machines that will allow us to beam down
 

3217
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,710
machines that will allow us to beam down
light and recreate ourselves

3218
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:04,720
light and recreate ourselves
 

3219
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,390
light and recreate ourselves
and in the book you know the aliens

3220
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:06,400
and in the book you know the aliens
 

3221
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,390
and in the book you know the aliens
actually take over

3222
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:08,400
actually take over
 

3223
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,829
actually take over
they're not as friendly

but
 

3227
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:12,950
but
you know this concept that we have to

3228
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:12,960
you know this concept that we have to
 

3229
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,789
you know this concept that we have to
eventually go and conquer every planet i

00:59:14,789 --> 00:59:14,799
eventually go and conquer every planet i
 

3231
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:17,349
eventually go and conquer every planet i
mean i think that yes we will become a

3232
00:59:17,349 --> 00:59:17,359
mean i think that yes we will become a
 

3233
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:20,390
mean i think that yes we will become a
galactic species so you you have um hope

3234
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:20,400
galactic species so you you have um hope
 

3235
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,710
galactic species so you you have um hope
well you said thanks oh of course of

3236
00:59:22,710 --> 00:59:22,720
well you said thanks oh of course of
 

3237
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,870
well you said thanks oh of course of
course i mean now that we've made it so

3238
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:24,880
course i mean now that we've made it so
 

3239
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,510
course i mean now that we've made it so
far you we so you think i made it oh

3240
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:27,520
far you we so you think i made it oh
 

3241
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,150
far you we so you think i made it oh
gosh i feel that you know cognition the

3242
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:30,160
gosh i feel that you know cognition the
 

3243
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,990
gosh i feel that you know cognition the
cognition as an evolutionary trait has

3244
00:59:31,990 --> 00:59:32,000
cognition as an evolutionary trait has
 

3245
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,309
cognition as an evolutionary trait has
won over in our planet there's no doubt

3246
00:59:34,309 --> 00:59:34,319
won over in our planet there's no doubt
 

3247
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:36,390
won over in our planet there's no doubt
that we've made it so basically humans

3248
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:36,400
that we've made it so basically humans
 

3249
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,349
that we've made it so basically humans
have

3250
00:59:37,349 --> 00:59:37,359
have
 

3251
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:39,190
have
won the battle for

3252
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:39,200
won the battle for
 

3253
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,670
won the battle for
you know uh dominance it wasn't

3254
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:41,680
you know uh dominance it wasn't
 

3255
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,309
you know uh dominance it wasn't
necessarily the case with dinosaurs like

3256
00:59:44,309 --> 00:59:44,319
necessarily the case with dinosaurs like
 

3257
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:45,109
necessarily the case with dinosaurs like
i mean

3258
00:59:45,109 --> 00:59:45,119
i mean
 

3259
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:47,589
i mean
yes you know there's some

3260
00:59:47,589 --> 00:59:47,599
yes you know there's some
 

3261
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:48,950
yes you know there's some
claims of

3262
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:48,960
claims of
 

3263
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,109
claims of
uh intelligence and if you look at

3264
00:59:51,109 --> 00:59:51,119
uh intelligence and if you look at
 

3265
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:53,829
uh intelligence and if you look at
jurassic park yeah sure whatever

3266
00:59:53,829 --> 00:59:53,839
jurassic park yeah sure whatever
 

3267
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:54,789
jurassic park yeah sure whatever
but

3268
00:59:54,789 --> 00:59:54,799
but
 

3269
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:55,829
but
you know they just don't have the

3270
00:59:55,829 --> 00:59:55,839
you know they just don't have the
 

3271
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:57,190
you know they just don't have the
hardware for it

3272
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:57,200
hardware for it
 

3273
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,270
hardware for it
yeah and humans have the hardware

3274
00:59:59,270 --> 00:59:59,280
yeah and humans have the hardware
 

3275
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,430
yeah and humans have the hardware
there's no doubt that mammals have a

3276
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:01,440
there's no doubt that mammals have a
 

3277
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,589
there's no doubt that mammals have a
dramatically improved hardware

3278
01:00:03,589 --> 01:00:03,599
dramatically improved hardware
 

3279
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:06,150
dramatically improved hardware
for cognition over dinosaurs like

3280
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:06,160
for cognition over dinosaurs like
 

3281
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,990
for cognition over dinosaurs like
basically there's universes where

3282
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:08,000
basically there's universes where
 

3283
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,870
basically there's universes where
strength went out and in our planet in

3284
01:00:10,870 --> 01:00:10,880
strength went out and in our planet in
 

3285
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,710
strength went out and in our planet in
our you know particular version of

3286
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:12,720
our you know particular version of
 

3287
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,430
our you know particular version of
whatever happened in this planet

3288
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:15,440
whatever happened in this planet
 

3289
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,910
whatever happened in this planet
cognition went out and it's kind of cool

3290
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:17,920
cognition went out and it's kind of cool
 

3291
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,390
cognition went out and it's kind of cool
i mean it's it's a privilege right but

3292
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:20,400
i mean it's it's a privilege right but
 

3293
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,510
i mean it's it's a privilege right but
it's kind of like living in boston

3294
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:21,520
it's kind of like living in boston
 

3295
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,829
it's kind of like living in boston
instead of i don't know some

3296
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:23,839
instead of i don't know some
 

3297
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:26,630
instead of i don't know some
middle uh middle-aged uh place where

3298
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:26,640
middle uh middle-aged uh place where
 

3299
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,069
middle uh middle-aged uh place where
everybody's like hitting each other with

3300
01:00:28,069 --> 01:00:28,079
everybody's like hitting each other with
 

3301
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:29,990
everybody's like hitting each other with
with uh you know some

3302
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:30,000
with uh you know some
 

3303
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,150
with uh you know some
weapons and sticks back to the lucky one

3304
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:32,160
weapons and sticks back to the lucky one
 

3305
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,510
weapons and sticks back to the lucky one
song

3306
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:33,520
song
 

3307
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,990
song
i mean we are the lucky ones

3308
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:36,000
i mean we are the lucky ones
 

3309
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,950
i mean we are the lucky ones
but the flip side of that uh is that

3310
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:38,960
but the flip side of that uh is that
 

3311
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,950
but the flip side of that uh is that
this hardware also allows us to develop

3312
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:40,960
this hardware also allows us to develop
 

3313
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,030
this hardware also allows us to develop
weapons and methods of destroying

3314
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:43,040
weapons and methods of destroying
 

3315
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,190
weapons and methods of destroying
ourselves

3316
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:45,200
ourselves
 

3317
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,430
ourselves
so you again i want to go back to pinker

3318
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:47,440
so you again i want to go back to pinker
 

3319
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,309
so you again i want to go back to pinker
yeah and the better angels of our nature

3320
01:00:50,309 --> 01:00:50,319
yeah and the better angels of our nature
 

3321
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:53,349
yeah and the better angels of our nature
the whole concept that

3322
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:53,359
the whole concept that
 

3323
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:55,030
the whole concept that
civilization

3324
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:55,040
civilization
 

3325
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,990
civilization
and the act of civilizing

3326
01:00:57,990 --> 01:00:58,000
and the act of civilizing
 

3327
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,150
and the act of civilizing
has dramatically reduced violence

3328
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:01,160
has dramatically reduced violence
 

3329
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,789
has dramatically reduced violence
dramatically

3330
01:01:02,789 --> 01:01:02,799
dramatically
 

3331
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:06,230
dramatically
if you look you know at every scale

3332
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:06,240
if you look you know at every scale
 

3333
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,510
if you look you know at every scale
as soon as organization comes the state

3334
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:09,520
as soon as organization comes the state
 

3335
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:10,950
as soon as organization comes the state
basically

3336
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:10,960
basically
 

3337
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,589
basically
owns the right to violence

3338
01:01:13,589 --> 01:01:13,599
owns the right to violence
 

3339
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,109
owns the right to violence
and eventually

3340
01:01:15,109 --> 01:01:15,119
and eventually
 

3341
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:17,430
and eventually
the state gives that right

3342
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:17,440
the state gives that right
 

3343
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,390
the state gives that right
of

3344
01:01:18,390 --> 01:01:18,400
of
 

3345
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,309
of
governance to the people

3346
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:20,319
governance to the people
 

3347
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:22,150
governance to the people
but but violence has been eliminated by

3348
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:22,160
but but violence has been eliminated by
 

3349
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,270
but but violence has been eliminated by
that state

3350
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:23,280
that state
 

3351
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,589
that state
so this whole concept of

3352
01:01:25,589 --> 01:01:25,599
so this whole concept of
 

3353
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,910
so this whole concept of
central governance and people agreeing

3354
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:27,920
central governance and people agreeing
 

3355
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,750
central governance and people agreeing
to live together

3356
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:29,760
to live together
 

3357
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:30,789
to live together
and

3358
01:01:30,789 --> 01:01:30,799
and
 

3359
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:31,750
and
share

3360
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:31,760
share
 

3361
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,670
share
responsibilities and duties and you know

3362
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:35,680
responsibilities and duties and you know
 

3363
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:36,710
responsibilities and duties and you know
all of that

3364
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:36,720
all of that
 

3365
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,470
all of that
is something that has led

3366
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:38,480
is something that has led
 

3367
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:39,430
is something that has led
so

3368
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:39,440
so
 

3369
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,789
so
much to less violence less death less

3370
01:01:42,789 --> 01:01:42,799
much to less violence less death less
 

3371
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:44,230
much to less violence less death less
suffering less

3372
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:44,240
suffering less
 

3373
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,789
suffering less
you know poverty less

3374
01:01:46,789 --> 01:01:46,799
you know poverty less
 

3375
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:49,910
you know poverty less
um you know war i mean

3376
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:49,920
um you know war i mean
 

3377
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:50,870
um you know war i mean
yes

3378
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:50,880
yes
 

3379
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,549
yes
we have the capability to destroy

3380
01:01:52,549 --> 01:01:52,559
we have the capability to destroy
 

3381
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:54,309
we have the capability to destroy
ourselves but

3382
01:01:54,309 --> 01:01:54,319
ourselves but
 

3383
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:57,589
ourselves but
the arc of civilization has led to much

3384
01:01:57,589 --> 01:01:57,599
the arc of civilization has led to much
 

3385
01:01:57,599 --> 01:01:59,589
the arc of civilization has led to much
much less destruction much much less war

3386
01:01:59,589 --> 01:01:59,599
much less destruction much much less war
 

3387
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:01,510
much less destruction much much less war
and much more peace and of course

3388
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:01,520
and much more peace and of course
 

3389
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,990
and much more peace and of course
there's blips back and forth

3390
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:04,000
there's blips back and forth
 

3391
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,549
there's blips back and forth
and you know there are setbacks but

3392
01:02:06,549 --> 01:02:06,559
and you know there are setbacks but
 

3393
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:07,510
and you know there are setbacks but
again

3394
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:07,520
again
 

3395
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,150
again
the moral arc of the universe

3396
01:02:10,150 --> 01:02:10,160
the moral arc of the universe
 

3397
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,230
the moral arc of the universe
but it seems to just i

3398
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:12,240
but it seems to just i
 

3399
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,589
but it seems to just i
probably imagine there were two

3400
01:02:13,589 --> 01:02:13,599
probably imagine there were two
 

3401
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:15,349
probably imagine there were two
dinosaurs back in the day having this

3402
01:02:15,349 --> 01:02:15,359
dinosaurs back in the day having this
 

3403
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:17,910
dinosaurs back in the day having this
exact conversation and they look up to

3404
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:17,920
exact conversation and they look up to
 

3405
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,829
exact conversation and they look up to
the sky and there seems to be something

3406
01:02:19,829 --> 01:02:19,839
the sky and there seems to be something
 

3407
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:22,710
the sky and there seems to be something
like an asteroid going towards earth so

3408
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:22,720
like an asteroid going towards earth so
 

3409
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,670
like an asteroid going towards earth so
it's while it's it's very true that

3410
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:25,680
it's while it's it's very true that
 

3411
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,670
it's while it's it's very true that
the the arc of our society of human

3412
01:02:27,670 --> 01:02:27,680
the the arc of our society of human
 

3413
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:30,230
the the arc of our society of human
civilization seems to be progressing

3414
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:30,240
civilization seems to be progressing
 

3415
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,589
civilization seems to be progressing
towards a better better life for

3416
01:02:31,589 --> 01:02:31,599
towards a better better life for
 

3417
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:32,789
towards a better better life for
everybody

3418
01:02:32,789 --> 01:02:32,799
everybody
 

3419
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:35,829
everybody
in in the many ways that you described

3420
01:02:35,829 --> 01:02:35,839
in in the many ways that you described
 

3421
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:36,789
in in the many ways that you described
uh

3422
01:02:36,789 --> 01:02:36,799
uh
 

3423
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:39,029
uh
things can change in a moment

3424
01:02:39,029 --> 01:02:39,039
things can change in a moment
 

3425
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:41,109
things can change in a moment
and it feels like it's not just us

3426
01:02:41,109 --> 01:02:41,119
and it feels like it's not just us
 

3427
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:44,069
and it feels like it's not just us
humans we're living through a pandemic

3428
01:02:44,069 --> 01:02:44,079
humans we're living through a pandemic
 

3429
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:45,750
humans we're living through a pandemic
you could imagine that

3430
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:45,760
you could imagine that
 

3431
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:50,309
you could imagine that
a pandemic would be more destructive or

3432
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:50,319

 

3433
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:52,069

or there could be asteroids that just

3434
01:02:52,069 --> 01:02:52,079
or there could be asteroids that just
 

3435
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:54,390
or there could be asteroids that just
appear out of the the darkness of space

3436
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:54,400
appear out of the the darkness of space
 

3437
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,710
appear out of the the darkness of space
which i would recently learned

3438
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:56,720
which i would recently learned
 

3439
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,630
which i would recently learned
it's not that easy to uh give you

3440
01:02:58,630 --> 01:02:58,640
it's not that easy to uh give you
 

3441
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:01,510
it's not that easy to uh give you
another number detect them yes so 48

3442
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:01,520
another number detect them yes so 48
 

3443
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,870
another number detect them yes so 48
what happens in 48 years

3444
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:04,880

 

3445
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,670

2068 apophis

3446
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:07,680
2068 apophis
 

3447
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,510
2068 apophis
there's an asteroid that's coming

3448
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:09,520
there's an asteroid that's coming
 

3449
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,589
there's an asteroid that's coming
in 48 years it has very high chance of

3450
01:03:11,589 --> 01:03:11,599
in 48 years it has very high chance of
 

3451
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:15,109
in 48 years it has very high chance of
actually wiping us out completely yes

3452
01:03:15,109 --> 01:03:15,119
actually wiping us out completely yes
 

3453
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:17,270
actually wiping us out completely yes
so we have 48 48 years to get our act

3454
01:03:17,270 --> 01:03:17,280
so we have 48 48 years to get our act
 

3455
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:18,470
so we have 48 48 years to get our act
together

3456
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:18,480
together
 

3457
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,150
together
it's not like some distant distant

3458
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:20,160
it's not like some distant distant
 

3459
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,390
it's not like some distant distant
hypothesis yes like yeah sure they're

3460
01:03:22,390 --> 01:03:22,400
hypothesis yes like yeah sure they're
 

3461
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,670
hypothesis yes like yeah sure they're
hard to detect but this one we know

3462
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:23,680
hard to detect but this one we know
 

3463
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,109
hard to detect but this one we know
about it's coming

3464
01:03:25,109 --> 01:03:25,119
about it's coming
 

3465
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:26,390
about it's coming
so how do you feel about that why are

3466
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:26,400
so how do you feel about that why are
 

3467
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,710
so how do you feel about that why are
you still talking oh gosh i'm so happy

3468
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:28,720
you still talking oh gosh i'm so happy
 

3469
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,150
you still talking oh gosh i'm so happy
with where we are now this is going to

3470
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:30,160
with where we are now this is going to
 

3471
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,589
with where we are now this is going to
be great seriously if you look at

3472
01:03:31,589 --> 01:03:31,599
be great seriously if you look at
 

3473
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:32,710
be great seriously if you look at
progress

3474
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:32,720
progress
 

3475
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:35,109
progress
if you look at again the speed with

3476
01:03:35,109 --> 01:03:35,119
if you look at again the speed with
 

3477
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:36,069
if you look at again the speed with
which

3478
01:03:36,069 --> 01:03:36,079
which
 

3479
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:38,390
which
knowledge has been transferred

3480
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:38,400
knowledge has been transferred
 

3481
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,190
knowledge has been transferred
what what has led to humanity making so

3482
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:41,200
what what has led to humanity making so
 

3483
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,190
what what has led to humanity making so
many advances so fast

3484
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:43,200
many advances so fast
 

3485
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:46,470
many advances so fast
okay so what has led to humanity making

3486
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:46,480
okay so what has led to humanity making
 

3487
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,230
okay so what has led to humanity making
so many advances is not just the

3488
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:48,240
so many advances is not just the
 

3489
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,230
so many advances is not just the
hardware upgrades

3490
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:50,240
hardware upgrades
 

3491
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,470
hardware upgrades
it's also the software upgrades

3492
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:52,480
it's also the software upgrades
 

3493
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,230
it's also the software upgrades
so by hardware upgrades i basically mean

3494
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:54,240
so by hardware upgrades i basically mean
 

3495
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,390
so by hardware upgrades i basically mean
our neocortex and the expansion and

3496
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:56,400
our neocortex and the expansion and
 

3497
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,870
our neocortex and the expansion and
these layers and you know folds of her

3498
01:03:58,870 --> 01:03:58,880
these layers and you know folds of her
 

3499
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,470
these layers and you know folds of her
brain and all of that that's the

3500
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:00,480
brain and all of that that's the
 

3501
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,069
brain and all of that that's the
hardware the software hasn't uh

3502
01:04:04,069 --> 01:04:04,079
hardware the software hasn't uh
 

3503
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:05,990
hardware the software hasn't uh
you know the the hardware hasn't changed

3504
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:06,000
you know the the hardware hasn't changed
 

3505
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,829
you know the the hardware hasn't changed
much in the last what seventy thousand

3506
01:04:07,829 --> 01:04:07,839
much in the last what seventy thousand
 

3507
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:10,470
much in the last what seventy thousand
years

3508
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:10,480

 

3509
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,309

as i mentioned last time if you take a

3510
01:04:12,309 --> 01:04:12,319
as i mentioned last time if you take a
 

3511
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:13,990
as i mentioned last time if you take a
person from ancient egypt and you bring

3512
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:14,000
person from ancient egypt and you bring
 

3513
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,990
person from ancient egypt and you bring
them up now they're just as equally fit

3514
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:18,000
them up now they're just as equally fit
 

3515
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:18,950
them up now they're just as equally fit
so

3516
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:18,960
so
 

3517
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,589
so
hardware hasn't changed what has changed

3518
01:04:21,589 --> 01:04:21,599
hardware hasn't changed what has changed
 

3519
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:25,029
hardware hasn't changed what has changed
is software what has changed is that

3520
01:04:25,029 --> 01:04:25,039
is software what has changed is that
 

3521
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:27,190
is software what has changed is that
we are

3522
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:27,200
we are
 

3523
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,349
we are
growing up in societies that are much

3524
01:04:29,349 --> 01:04:29,359
growing up in societies that are much
 

3525
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:30,789
growing up in societies that are much
more complex

3526
01:04:30,789 --> 01:04:30,799
more complex
 

3527
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:32,789
more complex
this whole concept of neotimi

3528
01:04:32,789 --> 01:04:32,799
this whole concept of neotimi
 

3529
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:35,750
this whole concept of neotimi
basically allows our exponential growth

3530
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:35,760
basically allows our exponential growth
 

3531
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,470
basically allows our exponential growth
the concept that our brain has not fully

3532
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:38,480
the concept that our brain has not fully
 

3533
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,710
the concept that our brain has not fully
formed has not fully

3534
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:40,720
formed has not fully
 

3535
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,710
formed has not fully
stabilized itself until after teenage

3536
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:42,720
stabilized itself until after teenage
 

3537
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,270
stabilized itself until after teenage
years so we basically have a good 16

3538
01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:45,280
years so we basically have a good 16
 

3539
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:48,390
years so we basically have a good 16
years 18 years to sort of infuse it with

3540
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:48,400
years 18 years to sort of infuse it with
 

3541
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,190
years 18 years to sort of infuse it with
the latest and greatest in software

3542
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:51,200
the latest and greatest in software
 

3543
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,549
the latest and greatest in software
if you look at what happened in ancient

3544
01:04:52,549 --> 01:04:52,559
if you look at what happened in ancient
 

3545
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:53,910
if you look at what happened in ancient
greece

3546
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:53,920
greece
 

3547
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:57,430
greece
why did everything explode at once

3548
01:04:57,430 --> 01:04:57,440
why did everything explode at once
 

3549
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,670
why did everything explode at once
my take on this is that it was the shift

3550
01:04:59,670 --> 01:04:59,680
my take on this is that it was the shift
 

3551
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:02,230
my take on this is that it was the shift
from the egyptian and hieroglyphic

3552
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:02,240
from the egyptian and hieroglyphic
 

3553
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,430
from the egyptian and hieroglyphic
software

3554
01:05:03,430 --> 01:05:03,440
software
 

3555
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,470
software
to the greek language software

has trouble getting at that
 

3593
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,670
has trouble getting at that
concept so what i'm trying to say is

have basically led to this enormous

3604
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:02,240
have basically led to this enormous
 

3605
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,870
have basically led to this enormous
explosion of knowledge

3606
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:04,880
explosion of knowledge
 

3607
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:07,270
explosion of knowledge
and eventually after the enlightenment

3608
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:07,280
and eventually after the enlightenment
 

3609
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,910
and eventually after the enlightenment
and as i was mentioning the 42 line

3610
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:09,920
and as i was mentioning the 42 line
 

3611

and the printed press the dissemination

3614
01:06:12,950 --> 01:06:12,960
and the printed press the dissemination
 

3615
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,710
and the printed press the dissemination
of knowledge you basically now have this

3616
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:14,720
of knowledge you basically now have this
 

3617
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,150
of knowledge you basically now have this
whole horizontal

3618
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:16,160
whole horizontal
 

3619
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,789
whole horizontal
dispersion of ideas in addition to the

3620
01:06:18,789 --> 01:06:18,799
dispersion of ideas in addition to the
 

3621
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:21,270
dispersion of ideas in addition to the
vertical inheritance of genes

3622
01:06:21,270 --> 01:06:21,280
vertical inheritance of genes
 

3623
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:22,870
vertical inheritance of genes
so the hardware

3624
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:22,880
so the hardware
 

3625
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,470
so the hardware
improvements happen through vertical

3626
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:24,480
improvements happen through vertical
 

3627
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,470
improvements happen through vertical
inheritance the software improvements

3628
01:06:26,470 --> 01:06:26,480
inheritance the software improvements
 

3629
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,630
inheritance the software improvements
happen through horizontal inheritance

3630
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:28,640
happen through horizontal inheritance
 

3631
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:30,390
happen through horizontal inheritance
and the reason why human civilization

3632
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:30,400
and the reason why human civilization
 

3633
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,309
and the reason why human civilization
exploded is not a hardware change

3634
01:06:32,309 --> 01:06:32,319
exploded is not a hardware change
 

3635
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:34,549
exploded is not a hardware change
anymore it's really a software change

3636
01:06:34,549 --> 01:06:34,559
anymore it's really a software change
 

3637
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:36,549
anymore it's really a software change
so if you're looking at now where we are

3638
01:06:36,549 --> 01:06:36,559
so if you're looking at now where we are
 

3639
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:38,950
so if you're looking at now where we are
today

3640
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:38,960
today
 

3641
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,510
today
look at coronavirus yes sure it could

3642
01:06:41,510 --> 01:06:41,520
look at coronavirus yes sure it could
 

3643
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,430
look at coronavirus yes sure it could
have killed us a hundred years ago it

3644
01:06:43,430 --> 01:06:43,440
have killed us a hundred years ago it
 

3645
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:44,390
have killed us a hundred years ago it
would have

3646
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:44,400
would have
 

3647
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,390
would have
but it didn't why because in january

3648
01:06:48,390 --> 01:06:48,400
but it didn't why because in january
 

3649
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,870
but it didn't why because in january
we we published the genome

3650
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:50,880
we we published the genome
 

3651
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,950
we we published the genome
a month later less than a month later

3652
01:06:52,950 --> 01:06:52,960
a month later less than a month later
 

3653
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,029
a month later less than a month later
the first vaccine designs were done and

3654
01:06:55,029 --> 01:06:55,039
the first vaccine designs were done and
 

3655
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:57,510
the first vaccine designs were done and
now less than a year later 10 months

3656
01:06:57,510 --> 01:06:57,520
now less than a year later 10 months
 

3657
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,510
now less than a year later 10 months
later we already have a working vaccine

3658
01:06:59,510 --> 01:06:59,520
later we already have a working vaccine
 

3659
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,589
later we already have a working vaccine
that's 90 efficient i mean that is

3660
01:07:01,589 --> 01:07:01,599
that's 90 efficient i mean that is
 

3661
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:04,069
that's 90 efficient i mean that is
ridiculous by any standards and the

3662
01:07:04,069 --> 01:07:04,079
ridiculous by any standards and the
 

3663
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:05,990
ridiculous by any standards and the
reason is sharing

3664
01:07:05,990 --> 01:07:06,000
reason is sharing
 

3665
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,390
reason is sharing
so you know the asteroid yes could wipe

3666
01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:08,400
so you know the asteroid yes could wipe
 

3667
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,349
so you know the asteroid yes could wipe
us out in 48 years but 48 years i mean

3668
01:07:11,349 --> 01:07:11,359
us out in 48 years but 48 years i mean
 

3669
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:14,230
us out in 48 years but 48 years i mean
look at where we were 48 years ago

3670
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:14,240
look at where we were 48 years ago
 

3671
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,990
look at where we were 48 years ago
technologically

3672
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:16,000
technologically
 

3673
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,549
technologically
i mean how much more we understand the

3674
01:07:18,549 --> 01:07:18,559
i mean how much more we understand the
 

3675
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:21,910
i mean how much more we understand the
basic foundations of space

3676
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:21,920
basic foundations of space
 

3677
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,910
basic foundations of space
is enormous the technological

3678
01:07:23,910 --> 01:07:23,920
is enormous the technological
 

3679
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,910
is enormous the technological
revolutions of

3680
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:25,920
revolutions of
 

3681
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:29,270
revolutions of
digitization the amount of compute power

3682
01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:29,280
digitization the amount of compute power
 

3683
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:33,190
digitization the amount of compute power
we can put on any like you know

3684
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:33,200

 

3685
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,829

by in nail size you know hardware is

3686
01:07:35,829 --> 01:07:35,839
by in nail size you know hardware is
 

3687
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:39,270
by in nail size you know hardware is
enormous so and this is nowhere near

3688
01:07:39,270 --> 01:07:39,280
enormous so and this is nowhere near
 

3689
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,230
enormous so and this is nowhere near
ending

3690
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:40,240
ending
 

3691
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:42,069

you know we all have our like little you
 

3693
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:43,829
you know we all have our like little you
know problems going back and forth on

3694
01:07:43,829 --> 01:07:43,839
know problems going back and forth on
 

3695
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:45,430

science has not slowed down science is
 

3705
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:58,069
science has not slowed down science is
moving at a breakneck pace ahead so you

3706
01:07:58,069 --> 01:07:58,079
moving at a breakneck pace ahead so you
 

3707
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,549
moving at a breakneck pace ahead so you
know elon is now putting rockets out

3708
01:08:00,549 --> 01:08:00,559
know elon is now putting rockets out
 

3709
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:02,950
know elon is now putting rockets out
from the private space i mean that now

3710
01:08:02,950 --> 01:08:02,960
from the private space i mean that now
 

3711
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:06,069
from the private space i mean that now
democratization of space exploration

you know gonna reveal it's gonna explode

3716
01:08:08,950 --> 01:08:08,960
you know gonna reveal it's gonna explode
 

3717

01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:10,960
continue in the same way that every
 

3719
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:13,109
continue in the same way that every
technology has exploded this is the

3720
01:08:13,109 --> 01:08:13,119
technology has exploded this is the
 

3721
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:16,070
technology has exploded this is the
shift to space technology exploding so

3722
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:16,080
shift to space technology exploding so
 

3723
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:19,669
shift to space technology exploding so
48 years is infinity from now in terms

3724
01:08:19,669 --> 01:08:19,679
48 years is infinity from now in terms
 

3725
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:21,910
48 years is infinity from now in terms
of space capabilities so i'm not worried

3726
01:08:21,910 --> 01:08:21,920
of space capabilities so i'm not worried
 

3727
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,430
of space capabilities so i'm not worried
at all are you excited by the

3728
01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:23,440
at all are you excited by the
 

3729
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,829
at all are you excited by the
possibility of a human

3730
01:08:25,829 --> 01:08:25,839
possibility of a human
 

3731
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:29,030
possibility of a human
well one human stepping foot on mars and

3732
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:29,040
well one human stepping foot on mars and
 

3733
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,550
well one human stepping foot on mars and
to

3734
01:08:30,550 --> 01:08:30,560
to
 

3735
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:32,630
to
possible colonization of not necessarily

3736
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:32,640
possible colonization of not necessarily
 

3737
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:34,390
possible colonization of not necessarily
mars but other planets and all that kind

3738
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:34,400
mars but other planets and all that kind
 

3739
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,070
mars but other planets and all that kind
of stuff for people living in space

3740
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:36,080
of stuff for people living in space
 

3741
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,390
of stuff for people living in space
inevitable and never inevitable would

3742
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:38,400
inevitable and never inevitable would
 

3743
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:41,430
inevitable and never inevitable would
you do it are you kind of like earth

3744
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:41,440
you do it are you kind of like earth
 

3745
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:43,030
you do it are you kind of like earth
you know how many how many how many

3746
01:08:43,030 --> 01:08:43,040
you know how many how many how many
 

3747
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,030
you know how many how many how many
people will you wait when you wait for i

3748
01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:45,040
people will you wait when you wait for i
 

3749
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:47,829
people will you wait when you wait for i
think it was about when um the the

3750
01:08:47,829 --> 01:08:47,839
think it was about when um the the
 

3751
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:49,910
think it was about when um the the
declaration of independence was signs

3752
01:08:49,910 --> 01:08:49,920
declaration of independence was signs
 

3753
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,990
declaration of independence was signs
about two to three million people lived

3754
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:52,000
about two to three million people lived
 

3755
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,470
about two to three million people lived
here so would you move like before would

3756
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:54,480
here so would you move like before would
 

3757
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:57,110
here so would you move like before would
you be like on the first boat would you

3758
01:08:57,110 --> 01:08:57,120
you be like on the first boat would you
 

3759
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,870
you be like on the first boat would you
be on the 10th boat would you wait until

3760
01:08:58,870 --> 01:08:58,880
be on the 10th boat would you wait until
 

3761
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,630
be on the 10th boat would you wait until
the declaration of independence i don't

3762
01:09:00,630 --> 01:09:00,640
the declaration of independence i don't
 

3763
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,229
the declaration of independence i don't
think i'll be on the shortlist because

3764
01:09:02,229 --> 01:09:02,239
think i'll be on the shortlist because
 

3765
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:03,829
think i'll be on the shortlist because
i'll be old by then

3766
01:09:03,829 --> 01:09:03,839
i'll be old by then
 

3767
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:05,269
i'll be old by then
they'll probably get a bunch of younger

3768
01:09:05,269 --> 01:09:05,279
they'll probably get a bunch of younger
 

3769
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:08,070
they'll probably get a bunch of younger
people but you're it's the

3770
01:09:08,070 --> 01:09:08,080
people but you're it's the
 

3771
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:10,309
people but you're it's the
it's the wisdom and the uh

3772
01:09:10,309 --> 01:09:10,319
it's the wisdom and the uh
 

3773
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:12,550
it's the wisdom and the uh
the wait then you are in the classroom

3774
01:09:12,550 --> 01:09:12,560
the wait then you are in the classroom
 

3775
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,470
the wait then you are in the classroom
horizontally you i gotta tell you you

3776
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:14,480
horizontally you i gotta tell you you
 

3777
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:15,749
horizontally you i gotta tell you you
are the lucky one so you might be on the

3778
01:09:15,749 --> 01:09:15,759
are the lucky one so you might be on the
 

3779
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:17,749
are the lucky one so you might be on the
list i don't know yeah i mean

3780
01:09:17,749 --> 01:09:17,759
list i don't know yeah i mean
 

3781
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:20,390
list i don't know yeah i mean
i i kind of feel like i would love to

3782
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:20,400
i i kind of feel like i would love to
 

3783
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,950
i i kind of feel like i would love to
see earth from above just to watch our

3784
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:22,960
see earth from above just to watch our
 

3785
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:25,590
see earth from above just to watch our
planet i mean just i mean you know you

3786
01:09:25,590 --> 01:09:25,600
planet i mean just i mean you know you
 

3787
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,829
planet i mean just i mean you know you
can watch a live feed of the

3788
01:09:27,829 --> 01:09:27,839
can watch a live feed of the
 

3789
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:29,349
can watch a live feed of the
space station

3790
01:09:29,349 --> 01:09:29,359
space station
 

3791
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:31,110
space station
watching earth

3792
01:09:31,110 --> 01:09:31,120
watching earth
 

3793
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:34,390
watching earth
is magnificent like this blue tiny

3794
01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:34,400
is magnificent like this blue tiny
 

3795
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:35,829
is magnificent like this blue tiny
little shield

3796
01:09:35,829 --> 01:09:35,839
little shield
 

3797
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:38,309
little shield
it's so thin our atmosphere like if you

3798
01:09:38,309 --> 01:09:38,319
it's so thin our atmosphere like if you
 

3799
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:39,829
it's so thin our atmosphere like if you
drive to new york you're basically in

3800
01:09:39,829 --> 01:09:39,839
drive to new york you're basically in
 

3801
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:41,510
drive to new york you're basically in
outer space i mean it's ridiculous it's

3802
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:41,520
outer space i mean it's ridiculous it's
 

3803
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,269
outer space i mean it's ridiculous it's
just so thin

3804
01:09:43,269 --> 01:09:43,279
just so thin
 

3805
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:45,030
just so thin
and it's just again such a privilege to

3806
01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:45,040
and it's just again such a privilege to
 

3807
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,269
and it's just again such a privilege to
be on this planet such a privilege

3808
01:09:47,269 --> 01:09:47,279
be on this planet such a privilege
 

3809
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:50,149
be on this planet such a privilege
but i think our species is

3810
01:09:50,149 --> 01:09:50,159
but i think our species is
 

3811
01:09:50,159 --> 01:09:51,349
but i think our species is
in for

3812
01:09:51,349 --> 01:09:51,359
in for
 

3813
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:54,709
in for
big good things

3814
01:09:54,709 --> 01:09:54,719

 

3815
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:55,910

i think that

3816
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:55,920
i think that
 

3817
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,990
i think that
you know we will overcome our little

3818
01:09:57,990 --> 01:09:58,000
you know we will overcome our little
 

3819
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,669
you know we will overcome our little
problems and

3820
01:09:59,669 --> 01:09:59,679
problems and
 

3821
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:01,430
problems and
eventually come together as a species i

3822
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:01,440
eventually come together as a species i
 

3823
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:03,030
eventually come together as a species i
feel that we we we're definitely on the

3824
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:03,040
feel that we we we're definitely on the
 

3825
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,310
feel that we we we're definitely on the
path to that

3826
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:04,320
path to that
 

3827
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:05,350
path to that
and

3828
01:10:05,350 --> 01:10:05,360
and
 

3829
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:07,990
and
you know it's just not permeated through

3830
01:10:07,990 --> 01:10:08,000
you know it's just not permeated through
 

3831
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:08,950
you know it's just not permeated through
the whole

3832
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:08,960
the whole
 

3833
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:10,470
the whole
universe yeah i mean through the whole

3834
01:10:10,470 --> 01:10:10,480
universe yeah i mean through the whole
 

3835
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,390
universe yeah i mean through the whole
world yet through the whole earth yet

3836
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:12,400
world yet through the whole earth yet
 

3837
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:15,270
world yet through the whole earth yet
but it's definitely permeating

3838
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:15,280
but it's definitely permeating
 

3839
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:18,790
but it's definitely permeating
so you've talked about humans as special

3840
01:10:18,790 --> 01:10:18,800
so you've talked about humans as special
 

3841
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:22,470
so you've talked about humans as special
how exactly are we special relative to

3842
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:22,480
how exactly are we special relative to
 

3843
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,229
how exactly are we special relative to
the dinosaurs

3844
01:10:24,229 --> 01:10:24,239
the dinosaurs
 

3845
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:27,430
the dinosaurs
so i mentioned that there's um you know

3846
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:27,440
so i mentioned that there's um you know
 

3847
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:29,990
so i mentioned that there's um you know
this dramatic cognitive improvement that

3848
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:30,000
this dramatic cognitive improvement that
 

3849
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,669
this dramatic cognitive improvement that
we've made

3850
01:10:31,669 --> 01:10:31,679
we've made
 

3851
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:33,669
we've made
but i think it goes much deeper than

3852
01:10:33,669 --> 01:10:33,679
but i think it goes much deeper than
 

3853
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:37,350
but i think it goes much deeper than
that so if you look at a lion attacking

3854
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:37,360
that so if you look at a lion attacking
 

3855
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:38,630
that so if you look at a lion attacking
a gazelle

3856
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:38,640
a gazelle
 

3857
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,870
a gazelle
in the middle of the serengeti

3858
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:40,880
in the middle of the serengeti
 

3859
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,709
in the middle of the serengeti
the lion is

3860
01:10:42,709 --> 01:10:42,719
the lion is
 

3861
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:44,229
the lion is
smelling the molecules in the

3862
01:10:44,229 --> 01:10:44,239
smelling the molecules in the
 

3863
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:45,590
smelling the molecules in the
environment

3864
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:45,600
environment
 

3865
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,390
environment
it's

3866
01:10:46,390 --> 01:10:46,400
it's
 

3867
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,950
it's
uh

3868
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:48,960

 

3869
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:51,750

hormones and neuroreceptors are sort of

3870
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:51,760
hormones and neuroreceptors are sort of
 

3871
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,470
hormones and neuroreceptors are sort of
getting it ready for impulse

3872
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:54,480
getting it ready for impulse
 

3873
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:57,270
getting it ready for impulse
the target is constantly looking around

3874
01:10:57,270 --> 01:10:57,280
the target is constantly looking around
 

3875
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:00,310
the target is constantly looking around
and sensing i've actually been in kenya

3876
01:11:00,310 --> 01:11:00,320
and sensing i've actually been in kenya
 

3877
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:03,270
and sensing i've actually been in kenya
and i've kind of seen the hunt yes i've

3878
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:03,280
and i've kind of seen the hunt yes i've
 

3879
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,750
and i've kind of seen the hunt yes i've
kind of seen the sort of

3880
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:05,760
kind of seen the sort of
 

3881
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,229
kind of seen the sort of
game of waiting

3882
01:11:08,229 --> 01:11:08,239
game of waiting
 

3883
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:09,669
game of waiting
and

3884
01:11:09,669 --> 01:11:09,679
and
 

3885
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:12,470
and
the mitochondria in the muscles of the

01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:12,480
the mitochondria in the muscles of the
 

3887
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:15,750
the mitochondria in the muscles of the
lion are basically ready for

lion are basically ready for
 

3889
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,430
lion are basically ready for

01:11:18,470 --> 01:11:18,480
jumping
 

3893
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,310
jumping
they're expensing an enormous amount of

the grass as it's flowing
 

3899
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,669
the grass as it's flowing
is constantly transforming

is constantly transforming
 

3901
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:27,590
is constantly transforming
solar energy

3902
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:27,600
solar energy
 

3903

into
 

3905
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,229
into
chloroplasts you know through the

3906
01:11:30,229 --> 01:11:30,239
chloroplasts you know through the
 

3907
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:32,870
chloroplasts you know through the
chloroplastin to energy which eventually

chloroplastin to energy which eventually
 

3909
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:35,990
chloroplastin to energy which eventually
feeds the gazelle and eventually feeds

3910
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:36,000
feeds the gazelle and eventually feeds
 

3911
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,950
feeds the gazelle and eventually feeds
the lions and so forth so

3912
01:11:38,950 --> 01:11:38,960
the lions and so forth so
 

3913
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,550
the lions and so forth so
as humans

3914
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:40,560
as humans
 

3915
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,229
as humans
we experience

3916
01:11:42,229 --> 01:11:42,239
we experience
 

3917
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:44,229
we experience
all of that

3918
01:11:44,229 --> 01:11:44,239
all of that
 

3919
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:47,510
all of that
but the lion only experiences

3920
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:47,520
but the lion only experiences
 

3921
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,510
but the lion only experiences
one layer

01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:49,520
one layer
 

3923
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,350

01:11:56,709 --> 01:11:56,719
the
 

3931
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:59,110
the
you know photoreceptors and the smell

3932
01:11:59,110 --> 01:11:59,120
you know photoreceptors and the smell
 

3933
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,630
you know photoreceptors and the smell
receptors the chemical receptors like

3934
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:00,640
receptors the chemical receptors like
 

3935
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,630

the lion always attacks against the wind
 

3937
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:05,110
the lion always attacks against the wind
so that it's not smelled

3938
01:12:05,110 --> 01:12:05,120
so that it's not smelled
 

3939
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:05,830
so that it's not smelled
like

like
 

3941
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,590
like
all of these things

3942
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:07,600
all of these things
 

3943
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:08,870
all of these things
are

so going back to software infrastructure

3952
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:17,040
so going back to software infrastructure
 

3953
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,870
so going back to software infrastructure
and hardware infrastructure if you

3954
01:12:18,870 --> 01:12:18,880
and hardware infrastructure if you
 

3955
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,550
and hardware infrastructure if you
design a computer

3956
01:12:20,550 --> 01:12:20,560
design a computer
 

3957
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,310
design a computer
you basically have a physical layer that

3958
01:12:22,310 --> 01:12:22,320
you basically have a physical layer that
 

3959
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,070
you basically have a physical layer that
you start with and then on top of that

3960
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:24,080
you start with and then on top of that
 

3961
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:25,830
you start with and then on top of that
physical layer you have you know the

3962
01:12:25,830 --> 01:12:25,840
physical layer you have you know the
 

3963
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,750
physical layer you have you know the
electrical layer and on top of the

3964
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:27,760
electrical layer and on top of the
 

3965
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,510
electrical layer and on top of the
electrical layer you have basically

3966
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:29,520
electrical layer you have basically
 

3967
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,550
electrical layer you have basically
gates and logic and an assembly layer

3968
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:32,560
gates and logic and an assembly layer
 

3969
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:33,750
gates and logic and an assembly layer
and on top of the assembly layer you

3970
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:33,760
and on top of the assembly layer you
 

3971
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:35,430
and on top of the assembly layer you
have your you know

3972
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:35,440
have your you know
 

3973
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:37,590
have your you know
higher order higher level programming

3974
01:12:37,590 --> 01:12:37,600
higher order higher level programming
 

3975
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:38,790
higher order higher level programming
and on top of that you have your deep

3976
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:38,800
and on top of that you have your deep
 

3977
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,870
and on top of that you have your deep
learning routine etc and on top of that

3978
01:12:40,870 --> 01:12:40,880
learning routine etc and on top of that
 

3979
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:43,910
learning routine etc and on top of that
you eventually build a cognitive system

3980
01:12:43,910 --> 01:12:43,920
you eventually build a cognitive system
 

3981
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,910
you eventually build a cognitive system
that's smart

3982
01:12:45,910 --> 01:12:45,920
that's smart
 

3983
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,669
that's smart
i want you to now picture

3984
01:12:47,669 --> 01:12:47,679
i want you to now picture
 

3985
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:50,790
i want you to now picture
this cognitive system becoming not just

3986
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:50,800
this cognitive system becoming not just
 

3987
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,270
this cognitive system becoming not just
self-aware

3988
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:53,280
self-aware
 

3989
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,910
self-aware
but also becoming aware of the hardware

3990
01:12:55,910 --> 01:12:55,920
but also becoming aware of the hardware
 

3991
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,669
but also becoming aware of the hardware
that it's made of

3992
01:12:57,669 --> 01:12:57,679
that it's made of
 

3993
01:12:57,679 --> 01:12:59,750
that it's made of
and the atoms that there that it's made

3994
01:12:59,750 --> 01:12:59,760

i can feel i'm losing my mind it's just
 

4019
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,350
i can feel i'm losing my mind it's just
so beautiful this concept of

4020
01:13:29,350 --> 01:13:29,360
so beautiful this concept of
 

4021
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,830
so beautiful this concept of
self-awareness of knowing that the

4022
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:31,840
self-awareness of knowing that the
 

4023
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:35,270
self-awareness of knowing that the
hardware is no longer there is amazing

4024
01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:35,280
hardware is no longer there is amazing
 

4025
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:38,390
hardware is no longer there is amazing
and in the same way humans who have had

4026
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:38,400
and in the same way humans who have had
 

4027
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,790
and in the same way humans who have had
accidents are aware that they've had

4028
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:40,800
accidents are aware that they've had
 

4029
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:41,990
accidents are aware that they've had
accidents

4030
01:13:41,990 --> 01:13:42,000
accidents
 

4031
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,270
accidents
so there's this self-awareness of ai

4032
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:45,280
so there's this self-awareness of ai
 

4033
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:46,790
so there's this self-awareness of ai
that

4034
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:46,800
that
 

4035
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:49,270
that
is you know this beautiful concept about

4036
01:13:49,270 --> 01:13:49,280
is you know this beautiful concept about
 

4037
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,030
is you know this beautiful concept about
you know sort of the eventual

4038
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:51,040
you know sort of the eventual
 

4039
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:54,630
you know sort of the eventual
cognitive leap to self-awareness

4040
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:54,640
cognitive leap to self-awareness
 

4041
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:55,590
cognitive leap to self-awareness
but

4042
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:55,600
but
 

4043
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,510
but
imagine now the ai system actually

4044
01:13:57,510 --> 01:13:57,520
imagine now the ai system actually
 

4045
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,790
imagine now the ai system actually
breaking through these layers and saying

4046

breaking through these layers and saying
 

4047

gold

4210
01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:44,400
gold
 

4211
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:47,750
gold
results from the fusion that happened

4212
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:47,760
results from the fusion that happened
 

4213
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,310
results from the fusion that happened
of you know increasingly large particles

4214
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:50,320
of you know increasingly large particles
 

4215
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,510
of you know increasingly large particles
before that explosion that then

4216
01:16:51,510 --> 01:16:51,520
before that explosion that then
 

4217
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:53,590
before that explosion that then
disperses it through the cosmos

4218
01:16:53,590 --> 01:16:53,600
disperses it through the cosmos
 

4219
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:56,390
disperses it through the cosmos
and it's only through understanding the

4220
01:16:56,390 --> 01:16:56,400
and it's only through understanding the
 

4221
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:57,990
and it's only through understanding the
very large that we understand very small

4222
01:16:57,990 --> 01:16:58,000
very large that we understand very small
 

4223
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,430
very large that we understand very small
and vice versa

4224
01:16:59,430 --> 01:16:59,440
and vice versa
 

4225
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:00,470
and vice versa
and that's

4226
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:00,480
and that's
 

4227
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:04,790
and that's
in space then there's the time direction

4228
01:17:04,790 --> 01:17:04,800
in space then there's the time direction
 

4229
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,070
in space then there's the time direction
as you are

4230
01:17:06,070 --> 01:17:06,080
as you are
 

4231
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,709
as you are
watching the kilimanjaro mountain you

4232
01:17:08,709 --> 01:17:08,719
watching the kilimanjaro mountain you
 

4233
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:11,590
watching the kilimanjaro mountain you
can kind of look back through time

4234
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:11,600
can kind of look back through time
 

4235
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,630
can kind of look back through time
to when that volcano was exploding and

4236
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:14,640
to when that volcano was exploding and
 

4237
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:16,709
to when that volcano was exploding and
you know growing out of the tectonic

4238
01:17:16,709 --> 01:17:16,719
you know growing out of the tectonic
 

4239
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:17,669
you know growing out of the tectonic
forces

4240
01:17:17,669 --> 01:17:17,679
forces
 

4241
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:19,270
forces
as you drive through

4242
01:17:19,270 --> 01:17:19,280
as you drive through
 

4243
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,990
as you drive through
death valley you see these mountains

4244
01:17:21,990 --> 01:17:22,000
death valley you see these mountains
 

4245
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,030
death valley you see these mountains
on their side and these layers

4246
01:17:25,030 --> 01:17:25,040
on their side and these layers
 

4247
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:28,229
on their side and these layers
of history exposed

4248
01:17:28,229 --> 01:17:28,239
of history exposed
 

4249
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:32,149
of history exposed
we are aware of the

4250
01:17:32,149 --> 01:17:32,159
we are aware of the
 

4251
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:34,470
we are aware of the
eons that have happened on earth and the

4252
01:17:34,470 --> 01:17:34,480
eons that have happened on earth and the
 

4253
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:37,189
eons that have happened on earth and the
tectonic movements on earth

4254
01:17:37,189 --> 01:17:37,199
tectonic movements on earth
 

4255
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:40,229
tectonic movements on earth
the same way that we're aware of the big

4256
01:17:40,229 --> 01:17:40,239
the same way that we're aware of the big
 

4257
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:41,189
the same way that we're aware of the big
bang

4258
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:41,199
bang
 

4259
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:42,709
bang
and the

4260
01:17:42,709 --> 01:17:42,719
and the
 

4261
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:44,550
and the
you know early evolution of the cosmos

4262
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:44,560
you know early evolution of the cosmos
 

4263
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,630
you know early evolution of the cosmos
and we can also see forward in time as

4264
01:17:46,630 --> 01:17:46,640
and we can also see forward in time as
 

4265
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:48,709
and we can also see forward in time as
to where the universe is heading we can

4266
01:17:48,709 --> 01:17:48,719
to where the universe is heading we can
 

4267
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:53,350
to where the universe is heading we can
see you know apophis in 2068 coming over

4268
01:17:53,350 --> 01:17:53,360
see you know apophis in 2068 coming over
 

4269
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:54,950
see you know apophis in 2068 coming over
looking ahead in time i mean that would

4270
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:54,960
looking ahead in time i mean that would
 

4271
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,709
looking ahead in time i mean that would
be magician stuff

4272
01:17:56,709 --> 01:17:56,719
be magician stuff
 

4273
01:17:56,719 --> 01:17:58,709
be magician stuff
you know in ancient times

4274
01:17:58,709 --> 01:17:58,719
you know in ancient times
 

4275
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:01,030
you know in ancient times
so what i love about humanity and its

4276
01:18:01,030 --> 01:18:01,040
so what i love about humanity and its
 

4277
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:03,830
so what i love about humanity and its
role in the universe is that

4278
01:18:03,830 --> 01:18:03,840
role in the universe is that
 

4279
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,910
role in the universe is that
you know if there's a god watching he's

4280
01:18:05,910 --> 01:18:05,920
you know if there's a god watching he's
 

4281
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:08,149
you know if there's a god watching he's
like finally somebody figured it out

4282
01:18:08,149 --> 01:18:08,159
like finally somebody figured it out
 

4283
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:09,990
like finally somebody figured it out
i've been building all these beautiful

4284
01:18:09,990 --> 01:18:10,000
i've been building all these beautiful
 

4285
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,590
i've been building all these beautiful
things and somebody can appreciate it

4286
01:18:11,590 --> 01:18:11,600
things and somebody can appreciate it
 

4287
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,110
things and somebody can appreciate it
and figured me out from god's

4288
01:18:13,110 --> 01:18:13,120
and figured me out from god's
 

4289
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,510
and figured me out from god's
perspective meaning like become aware of

4290
01:18:15,510 --> 01:18:15,520
perspective meaning like become aware of
 

4291
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:16,950
perspective meaning like become aware of
yeah you know

4292
01:18:16,950 --> 01:18:16,960
yeah you know
 

4293
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,030
yeah you know
yeah so it's kind of interesting so to

4294
01:18:19,030 --> 01:18:19,040
yeah so it's kind of interesting so to
 

4295
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:21,830
yeah so it's kind of interesting so to
think of the world in this way as layers

4296
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:21,840
think of the world in this way as layers
 

4297
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,350
think of the world in this way as layers
and us humans

4298
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:23,360
and us humans
 

4299
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,830
and us humans
are able to convert those layers into

4300
01:18:25,830 --> 01:18:25,840
are able to convert those layers into
 

4301
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:28,229
are able to convert those layers into
ideas that they you can then

4302
01:18:28,229 --> 01:18:28,239
ideas that they you can then
 

4303
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:29,590
ideas that they you can then
like combine

4304
01:18:29,590 --> 01:18:29,600
like combine
 

4305
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,270
like combine
right so we're doing some kind of

4306
01:18:31,270 --> 01:18:31,280
right so we're doing some kind of
 

4307
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:33,910
right so we're doing some kind of
conversion exactly exactly and last time

4308
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:33,920
conversion exactly exactly and last time
 

4309
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,830
conversion exactly exactly and last time
you asked me about whether we live in a

4310
01:18:35,830 --> 01:18:35,840
you asked me about whether we live in a
 

4311
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,590
you asked me about whether we live in a
simulation for example

4312
01:18:37,590 --> 01:18:37,600
simulation for example
 

4313
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,750
simulation for example
i mean

4314
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:39,760
i mean
 

4315
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:41,990
i mean
realize that we are

4316
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:42,000
realize that we are
 

4317
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,229
realize that we are
living in a simulation we are the

4318
01:18:44,229 --> 01:18:44,239
living in a simulation we are the
 

4319
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:46,310
living in a simulation we are the
reality that we're in without any sort

4320
01:18:46,310 --> 01:18:46,320
reality that we're in without any sort
 

4321
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,470
reality that we're in without any sort
of person programming this is a

4322
01:18:48,470 --> 01:18:48,480
of person programming this is a
 

4323
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:51,030
of person programming this is a
simulation like basically what happens

4324
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:51,040
simulation like basically what happens
 

4325
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:52,390
simulation like basically what happens
inside your skull

4326
01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:52,400
inside your skull
 

4327
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,790
inside your skull
there's this integration of sensory

4328
01:18:54,790 --> 01:18:54,800
there's this integration of sensory
 

4329
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,870
there's this integration of sensory
inputs which are translated into

4330
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:56,880
inputs which are translated into
 

4331
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:59,189
inputs which are translated into
perceptory signals which are then

4332
01:18:59,189 --> 01:18:59,199
perceptory signals which are then
 

4333
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:01,189
perceptory signals which are then
translated into a conceptual model of

4334
01:19:01,189 --> 01:19:01,199
translated into a conceptual model of
 

4335
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:03,189
translated into a conceptual model of
the world around you

4336
01:19:03,189 --> 01:19:03,199
the world around you
 

4337
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:05,830
the world around you
and that exercise

4338
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:05,840
and that exercise
 

4339
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:09,990
and that exercise
is happening seamlessly and yet

4340
01:19:09,990 --> 01:19:10,000
is happening seamlessly and yet
 

4341
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,189
is happening seamlessly and yet
you know if you if you think about sort

4342
01:19:11,189 --> 01:19:11,199
you know if you if you think about sort
 

4343
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:13,510
you know if you if you think about sort
of again this whole simulation and neo

4344
01:19:13,510 --> 01:19:13,520
of again this whole simulation and neo
 

4345
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:15,990
of again this whole simulation and neo
um analogy

4346
01:19:15,990 --> 01:19:16,000
um analogy
 

4347
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,669
um analogy
you can think of the reality that we

4348
01:19:17,669 --> 01:19:17,679
you can think of the reality that we
 

4349
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:20,550
you can think of the reality that we
live in as a matrix as the matrix but

4350
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:20,560
live in as a matrix as the matrix but
 

4351
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:22,870
live in as a matrix as the matrix but
we've actually broken through the matrix

4352
01:19:22,870 --> 01:19:22,880
we've actually broken through the matrix
 

4353
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,870
we've actually broken through the matrix
we've actually traversed the layers we

4354
01:19:24,870 --> 01:19:24,880
we've actually traversed the layers we
 

4355
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,470
we've actually traversed the layers we
didn't have to take a pill like we

4356
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:26,480
didn't have to take a pill like we
 

4357
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,310
didn't have to take a pill like we
didn't nick you know

4358
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:28,320
didn't nick you know
 

4359
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,149
didn't nick you know
morpheus didn't have to show up to

4360
01:19:30,149 --> 01:19:30,159
morpheus didn't have to show up to
 

4361
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:31,430
morpheus didn't have to show up to
basically give us the blue pill or the

4362
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:31,440
basically give us the blue pill or the
 

4363
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:32,470
basically give us the blue pill or the
red pill

4364
01:19:32,470 --> 01:19:32,480
red pill
 

4365
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,229
red pill
we were able to

4366
01:19:34,229 --> 01:19:34,239
we were able to
 

4367
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:36,709
we were able to
sufficiently evolve cognitively through

4368
01:19:36,709 --> 01:19:36,719
sufficiently evolve cognitively through
 

4369
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:38,390
sufficiently evolve cognitively through
the hardware explosion

4370
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:38,400
the hardware explosion
 

4371
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:41,110
the hardware explosion
and sufficiently involve scientifically

when do when does the spark happen that
basically sort of makes

4430
01:20:37,189 --> 01:20:37,199
basically sort of makes

01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:38,709
basically sort of makes
you you

you you
 

4433
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:40,550
you you
i mean that's you know really the next

4434
01:20:40,550 --> 01:20:40,560
i mean that's you know really the next
 

4435
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,950
i mean that's you know really the next
frontier so so in terms of these peeling

4436
01:20:42,950 --> 01:20:42,960
frontier so so in terms of these peeling
 

4437
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,950
frontier so so in terms of these peeling
off layers of complexity

4438

somewhere between the cognitive layer

01:20:47,350 --> 01:20:47,360
somewhere between the cognitive layer

01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,750

4445
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:53,430

4447
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,110
layer there's still some stuff to be
figured out there and i think that's the

4448
01:20:55,110 --> 01:20:55,120
figured out there and i think that's the
 

4449
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,430
figured out there and i think that's the
final frontier of sort of completing our

4450
01:20:57,430 --> 01:20:57,440
final frontier of sort of completing our
 

4451
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:59,669
final frontier of sort of completing our
journey through that matrix and maybe

4452
01:20:59,669 --> 01:20:59,679
journey through that matrix and maybe
 

4453
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:01,990
journey through that matrix and maybe
duplicating it in the

4454
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:02,000
duplicating it in the

01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,149
duplicating it in the

which is another very exciting uh

01:21:07,990 --> 01:21:08,000
which is another very exciting uh
 

4461
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,629
which is another very exciting uh
possibility what i love about ai and the

4462
01:21:10,629 --> 01:21:10,639
possibility what i love about ai and the
 

4463
01:21:10,639 --> 01:21:13,030
possibility what i love about ai and the
way that it operates right now is the

4464
01:21:13,030 --> 01:21:13,040
way that it operates right now is the
 

4465
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:16,070
way that it operates right now is the
fact that it is unpredictable

4466
01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:16,080
fact that it is unpredictable
 

4467
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,310
fact that it is unpredictable
there's emergent behavior

4468
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:18,320
there's emergent behavior
 

4469
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:21,669
there's emergent behavior
in our cognitively capable artificial

4470
01:21:21,669 --> 01:21:21,679
in our cognitively capable artificial
 

4471
01:21:21,679 --> 01:21:23,669
in our cognitively capable artificial
systems

4472
01:21:23,669 --> 01:21:23,679
systems
 

4473
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:24,629
systems
that

4474
01:21:24,629 --> 01:21:24,639
that
 

4475
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:27,990
that
we can certainly model but we don't

4476
01:21:27,990 --> 01:21:28,000
we can certainly model but we don't
 

4477
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,910
we can certainly model but we don't
encode directly

4478
01:21:29,910 --> 01:21:29,920
encode directly
 

4479
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:32,470
encode directly
and that's a key difference

4480
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:32,480
and that's a key difference
 

4481
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:33,189
and that's a key difference
so

4482
01:21:33,189 --> 01:21:33,199
so
 

4483
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:35,750
so
we like to say oh of course this is not

4484
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:35,760
we like to say oh of course this is not
 

4485
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,750
we like to say oh of course this is not
really intelligent because we coded it

4486
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:37,760
really intelligent because we coded it
 

4487
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:38,790
really intelligent because we coded it
up

4488
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:38,800
up
 

4489
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,629
up
and we just put in these little

4490
01:21:40,629 --> 01:21:40,639
and we just put in these little
 

4491
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:41,990
and we just put in these little
parameters there and there's like you

4492
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:42,000
parameters there and there's like you
 

4493
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:42,629
parameters there and there's like you
know

4494
01:21:42,629 --> 01:21:42,639
know
 

4495
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:44,070
know
six billion parameters and once you've

4496
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:44,080
six billion parameters and once you've
 

4497
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,910
six billion parameters and once you've
learned them you know we kind of

4498
01:21:45,910 --> 01:21:45,920
learned them you know we kind of
 

4499
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:47,990
learned them you know we kind of
understand the layers

4500
01:21:47,990 --> 01:21:48,000
understand the layers
 

4501
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,390
understand the layers
but that's an oversimplification

4502
01:21:50,390 --> 01:21:50,400
but that's an oversimplification
 

4503
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,790
but that's an oversimplification
it's it's like saying oh of course

4504
01:21:52,790 --> 01:21:52,800
it's it's like saying oh of course
 

4505
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,470

01:22:22,950 --> 01:22:22,960
you know
 

4539
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:25,270
you know
the the the cortical layers

4540
01:22:25,270 --> 01:22:25,280
the the the cortical layers
 

4541
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:26,629
the the the cortical layers
doing their thing

4542
01:22:26,629 --> 01:22:26,639
doing their thing
 

4543
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:28,629
doing their thing
in the same way that when we build you

4544
01:22:28,629 --> 01:22:28,639
in the same way that when we build you
 

4545
01:22:28,639 --> 01:22:29,350
in the same way that when we build you
know

4546
01:22:29,350 --> 01:22:29,360
know
 

4547
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:31,189
know
these conversational systems or these

4548
01:22:31,189 --> 01:22:31,199
these conversational systems or these
 

4549
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:33,270
these conversational systems or these
cognitive systems or these deep learning

4550
01:22:33,270 --> 01:22:33,280
cognitive systems or these deep learning
 

4551
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:34,550
cognitive systems or these deep learning
systems

4552
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:34,560
systems
 

4553
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,070
systems
we put the architecture in place but

4554
01:22:36,070 --> 01:22:36,080
we put the architecture in place but
 

4555
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:37,510
we put the architecture in place but
then they do their thing

4556
01:22:37,510 --> 01:22:37,520
then they do their thing
 

4557
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,510
then they do their thing
and in some ways that's creating

4558
01:22:39,510 --> 01:22:39,520
and in some ways that's creating
 

4559
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,430
and in some ways that's creating
something that has its own identity

4560
01:22:41,430 --> 01:22:41,440
something that has its own identity
 

4561
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:42,790
something that has its own identity
that's creating something that's not

4562
01:22:42,790 --> 01:22:42,800
that's creating something that's not
 

4563
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:46,070
that's creating something that's not
just oh yeah it's not the early ai where

4564
01:22:46,070 --> 01:22:46,080
just oh yeah it's not the early ai where
 

4565
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:47,669
just oh yeah it's not the early ai where
if you hadn't programmed what happens in

4566
01:22:47,669 --> 01:22:47,679
if you hadn't programmed what happens in
 

4567
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:50,070
if you hadn't programmed what happens in
the grocery bags when you have both cold

4568
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:50,080
the grocery bags when you have both cold
 

4569
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:51,830
the grocery bags when you have both cold
and hot and hard and

4570
01:22:51,830 --> 01:22:51,840
and hot and hard and
 

4571
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,030
and hot and hard and
soft

4572
01:22:53,030 --> 01:22:53,040
soft
 

4573
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,149
soft
you know the system wouldn't know what

4574
01:22:54,149 --> 01:22:54,159
you know the system wouldn't know what
 

4575
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:56,390
you know the system wouldn't know what
to do no no you basically now just

4576
01:22:56,390 --> 01:22:56,400
to do no no you basically now just
 

4577
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,149
to do no no you basically now just
program the primitives and then he

4578
01:22:58,149 --> 01:22:58,159
program the primitives and then he
 

4579
01:22:58,159 --> 01:22:59,910
program the primitives and then he
learns from that so even though the

4580
01:22:59,910 --> 01:22:59,920
learns from that so even though the
 

4581
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,910
learns from that so even though the
origins are humble just like it is for

4582
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:01,920
origins are humble just like it is for
 

4583
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:04,470
origins are humble just like it is for
our genetic code for ai even though the

4584
01:23:04,470 --> 01:23:04,480
our genetic code for ai even though the
 

4585
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:07,110
our genetic code for ai even though the
origins are humble the

4586
01:23:07,110 --> 01:23:07,120
origins are humble the
 

4587
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:08,470
origins are humble the
the uh

4588
01:23:08,470 --> 01:23:08,480
the uh
 

4589
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:10,790
the uh
the result of it being deployed into the

4590
01:23:10,790 --> 01:23:10,800
the result of it being deployed into the
 

4591
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:13,990
the result of it being deployed into the
world is infinitely complex

4592
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:14,000
world is infinitely complex
 

4593
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:14,870
world is infinitely complex
and

4594
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:14,880
and
 

4595
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,790
and
that's

4596
01:23:16,790 --> 01:23:16,800
that's
 

4597
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:20,310
that's
and yet there's not uh it's not yet able

4598
01:23:20,310 --> 01:23:20,320
and yet there's not uh it's not yet able
 

4599
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:23,189
and yet there's not uh it's not yet able
to be cognizant of all the other layers

4600
01:23:23,189 --> 01:23:23,199
to be cognizant of all the other layers
 

4601
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:24,470
to be cognizant of all the other layers
in uh

4602
01:23:24,470 --> 01:23:24,480
in uh
 

4603
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:27,669
in uh
of its you know it's not

4604
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:27,679
of its you know it's not
 

4605
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:29,990
of its you know it's not
it's not able to

4606
01:23:29,990 --> 01:23:30,000
it's not able to
 

4607
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,189
it's not able to
think about

4608
01:23:31,189 --> 01:23:31,199
think about
 

4609
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:32,870
think about
space and time

4610
01:23:32,870 --> 01:23:32,880
space and time
 

4611
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,550
space and time
it's not able to think about the

4612
01:23:34,550 --> 01:23:34,560
it's not able to think about the
 

4613
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:35,830
it's not able to think about the
hardware in which it runs the

4614
01:23:35,830 --> 01:23:35,840
hardware in which it runs the
 

4615
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:38,390
hardware in which it runs the
electricity on which it runs yet

4616
01:23:38,390 --> 01:23:38,400
electricity on which it runs yet
 

4617
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,950
electricity on which it runs yet
so so if you look at humans

4618
01:23:40,950 --> 01:23:40,960
so so if you look at humans
 

4619
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:42,709
so so if you look at humans
we basically have the same cognitive

4620
01:23:42,709 --> 01:23:42,719
we basically have the same cognitive
 

4621
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:44,790
we basically have the same cognitive
architecture as monkeys as the great

4622
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:44,800
architecture as monkeys as the great
 

4623
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,629
architecture as monkeys as the great
apes it's

4624
01:23:46,629 --> 01:23:46,639
apes it's
 

4625
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:49,030
apes it's
just a ton more of it

4626
01:23:49,030 --> 01:23:49,040
just a ton more of it
 

4627
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:53,030
just a ton more of it
if you look at um gpt3 versus gpd2

4628
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:53,040
if you look at um gpt3 versus gpd2
 

4629
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:55,030
if you look at um gpt3 versus gpd2
again it's the same architecture just

4630
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:55,040
again it's the same architecture just
 

4631
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,310
again it's the same architecture just
more of it

4632
01:23:56,310 --> 01:23:56,320
more of it
 

4633
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:58,629
more of it
and yet it's able to do so much more

4634
01:23:58,629 --> 01:23:58,639
and yet it's able to do so much more
 

4635
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:00,550
and yet it's able to do so much more
yeah so if you start thinking about sort

4636
01:24:00,550 --> 01:24:00,560
yeah so if you start thinking about sort
 

4637
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:03,990
yeah so if you start thinking about sort
of what's the future of that gpt 455 do

4638
01:24:03,990 --> 01:24:04,000
of what's the future of that gpt 455 do
 

4639
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,510
of what's the future of that gpt 455 do
you really need fundamentally different

4640
01:24:05,510 --> 01:24:05,520
you really need fundamentally different
 

4641
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:07,430
you really need fundamentally different
architectures or do you just need a ton

4642
01:24:07,430 --> 01:24:07,440
architectures or do you just need a ton
 

4643
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:10,550
architectures or do you just need a ton
more hardware and we do have a ton more

4644
01:24:10,550 --> 01:24:10,560
more hardware and we do have a ton more
 

4645
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:12,709
more hardware and we do have a ton more
hardware like these systems are nowhere

4646
01:24:12,709 --> 01:24:12,719
hardware like these systems are nowhere
 

4647
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:16,470
hardware like these systems are nowhere
near what humans have between our ears

4648
01:24:16,470 --> 01:24:16,480
near what humans have between our ears
 

4649
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:17,830
near what humans have between our ears
so

4650
01:24:17,830 --> 01:24:17,840
so
 

4651
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,910
so
you know there's something to be said

4652
01:24:19,910 --> 01:24:19,920
you know there's something to be said
 

4653
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:23,590
you know there's something to be said
about stay tuned for emergent behavior

4654
01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:23,600
about stay tuned for emergent behavior
 

4655
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,870
about stay tuned for emergent behavior
we keep thinking that general

4656
01:24:24,870 --> 01:24:24,880
we keep thinking that general
 

4657
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:26,550
we keep thinking that general
intelligence might just be

4658
01:24:26,550 --> 01:24:26,560
intelligence might just be
 

4659
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:28,390
intelligence might just be
forever away

4660
01:24:28,390 --> 01:24:28,400
forever away
 

4661
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:30,790
forever away
but it could just simply be that we just

4662
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:30,800
but it could just simply be that we just
 

4663
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,550
but it could just simply be that we just
need a ton more hardware

4664
01:24:32,550 --> 01:24:32,560
need a ton more hardware
 

4665
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:33,990
need a ton more hardware
and that humans are just not that

4666
01:24:33,990 --> 01:24:34,000
and that humans are just not that
 

4667
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,550
and that humans are just not that
different from the great apes except for

4668
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:36,560
different from the great apes except for
 

4669
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:38,629
different from the great apes except for
just a ton more of it yeah it's

4670
01:24:38,629 --> 01:24:38,639
just a ton more of it yeah it's
 

4671
01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:41,750
just a ton more of it yeah it's
interesting that in the ai community

4672
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:41,760
interesting that in the ai community
 

4673
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:44,790
interesting that in the ai community
maybe it is a human-centric fear but the

4674
01:24:44,790 --> 01:24:44,800
maybe it is a human-centric fear but the
 

4675
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,790
maybe it is a human-centric fear but the
notion that gpt

4676
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:46,800
notion that gpt
 

4677
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:48,550
notion that gpt
10 will be

4678
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:48,560
10 will be
 

4679
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:50,070
10 will be
will achieve general intelligence is

4680
01:24:50,070 --> 01:24:50,080
will achieve general intelligence is
 

4681
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:52,149
will achieve general intelligence is
something that people shy away from that

4682
01:24:52,149 --> 01:24:52,159
something that people shy away from that
 

4683
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:53,750
something that people shy away from that
there has to be something totally

4684
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:53,760
there has to be something totally
 

4685
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:56,070
there has to be something totally
different and new added to this

4686
01:24:56,070 --> 01:24:56,080
different and new added to this
 

4687
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:57,110
different and new added to this
and yet

4688
01:24:57,110 --> 01:24:57,120
and yet
 

4689
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:01,030
and yet
it's not seriously considered that um

4690
01:25:01,030 --> 01:25:01,040
it's not seriously considered that um
 

4691
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:03,189
it's not seriously considered that um
this this very simple

4692
01:25:03,189 --> 01:25:03,199
this this very simple
 

4693
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:05,270
this this very simple
thing this very simple architecture when

4694
01:25:05,270 --> 01:25:05,280
thing this very simple architecture when
 

4695
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:07,830
thing this very simple architecture when
scaled might be the thing that achieves

4696
01:25:07,830 --> 01:25:07,840
scaled might be the thing that achieves
 

4697
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:10,149
scaled might be the thing that achieves
super intelligence and people think the

4698
01:25:10,149 --> 01:25:10,159
super intelligence and people think the
 

4699
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:12,470
super intelligence and people think the
same way about humanity and human

01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:35,910
it's already getting shaped to the types

01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,390
world today
so it's not just like oh have an

4784
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:38,400
so it's not just like oh have an
 

4785
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,390
so it's not just like oh have an
egyptian be born and then ship them over

4786
01:26:40,390 --> 01:26:40,400
egyptian be born and then ship them over
 

4787
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,870
egyptian be born and then ship them over
it's like no that egyptian would be

4788
01:26:42,870 --> 01:26:42,880
it's like no that egyptian would be
 

4789
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:45,270
it's like no that egyptian would be
listening in to the complex of the world

4790
01:26:45,270 --> 01:26:45,280
listening in to the complex of the world
 

4791
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:47,750
listening in to the complex of the world
and then getting born and sort of seeing

4792
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:47,760
and then getting born and sort of seeing
 

4793
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,510
and then getting born and sort of seeing
just how much more complex the world is

4794
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:49,520
just how much more complex the world is
 

4795
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:52,550
just how much more complex the world is
so it's a combination of the underlying

4796
01:26:52,550 --> 01:26:52,560
so it's a combination of the underlying
 

4797
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:53,910
so it's a combination of the underlying
hardware

4798
01:26:53,910 --> 01:26:53,920
hardware
 

4799
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:57,350
hardware
which if you think about as a geneticist

4800
01:26:57,350 --> 01:26:57,360
which if you think about as a geneticist
 

4801
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:59,270
which if you think about as a geneticist
in my view the hardware gives you an

4802
01:26:59,270 --> 01:26:59,280
in my view the hardware gives you an
 

4803
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:02,070
in my view the hardware gives you an
upper bound of cognitive capabilities

4804
01:27:02,070 --> 01:27:02,080
upper bound of cognitive capabilities
 

4805
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:03,510
upper bound of cognitive capabilities
but it's the environment that makes

4806
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:03,520
but it's the environment that makes
 

4807
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:05,910
but it's the environment that makes
those capabilities shine and reach their

4808
01:27:05,910 --> 01:27:05,920
those capabilities shine and reach their
 

4809
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:09,669
those capabilities shine and reach their
maxima so we're a combination of nature

4810
01:27:09,669 --> 01:27:09,679
maxima so we're a combination of nature
 

4811
01:27:09,679 --> 01:27:10,870
maxima so we're a combination of nature
and nurture

4812
01:27:10,870 --> 01:27:10,880
and nurture
 

4813
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:13,030
and nurture
the nature is our genes and our

4814
01:27:13,030 --> 01:27:13,040
the nature is our genes and our
 

4815
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:16,870
the nature is our genes and our
cognitive apparatus and the nurture is

4816
01:27:16,870 --> 01:27:16,880
cognitive apparatus and the nurture is
 

4817
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:18,709
cognitive apparatus and the nurture is
the richness of the environment that

4818
01:27:18,709 --> 01:27:18,719
the richness of the environment that
 

4819
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:20,950
the richness of the environment that
makes that cognitive apparatus reach its

4820
01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:20,960
makes that cognitive apparatus reach its
 

4821
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:21,990
makes that cognitive apparatus reach its
potential

4822
01:27:21,990 --> 01:27:22,000

4823
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,870

and we are so far from reaching our full

01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:29,990
so far
i think that kids being born 100 years

4830
01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:30,000
i think that kids being born 100 years
 

4831
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,870
i think that kids being born 100 years
from now they'll be looking at us now

4832
01:27:32,870 --> 01:27:32,880
from now they'll be looking at us now
 

4833
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,870
from now they'll be looking at us now
and saying what primitive educational

4834
01:27:34,870 --> 01:27:34,880
and saying what primitive educational
 

4835
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,310
and saying what primitive educational
systems they had

4836
01:27:36,310 --> 01:27:36,320
systems they had
 

4837
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:38,070
systems they had
i can't believe people were not wired

4838
01:27:38,070 --> 01:27:38,080
i can't believe people were not wired
 

4839
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:40,790
i can't believe people were not wired
into this you know virtual reality from

4840
01:27:40,790 --> 01:27:40,800
into this you know virtual reality from
 

4841
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:41,669
into this you know virtual reality from
birth

4842
01:27:41,669 --> 01:27:41,679
birth
 

4843
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:43,510
birth
as we are now because like they're

4844
01:27:43,510 --> 01:27:43,520
as we are now because like they're
 

4845
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:45,189
as we are now because like they're
clearly inferior

4846
01:27:45,189 --> 01:27:45,199
clearly inferior
 

4847
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:47,270
clearly inferior
and so forth so i basically think that

4848
01:27:47,270 --> 01:27:47,280
and so forth so i basically think that
 

4849
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:49,590
and so forth so i basically think that
our environment will continue

4850
01:27:49,590 --> 01:27:49,600
our environment will continue
 

4851
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:50,870
our environment will continue
exploding

4852
01:27:50,870 --> 01:27:50,880
exploding
 

4853
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:53,350
exploding
and our cognitive capabilities it's not

4854
01:27:53,350 --> 01:27:53,360
and our cognitive capabilities it's not
 

4855
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:54,790
and our cognitive capabilities it's not
like oh we're only using two percent of

01:27:54,790 --> 01:27:54,800
like oh we're only using two percent of
 

4857
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:55,830
like oh we're only using two percent of
our brain that's ridiculous of course

4858
01:27:55,830 --> 01:27:55,840
our brain that's ridiculous of course
 

4859
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:58,470
our brain that's ridiculous of course
we're using 100 of our brain but it's

4860
01:27:58,470 --> 01:27:58,480
we're using 100 of our brain but it's
 

4861
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:00,709
we're using 100 of our brain but it's

you know into another twist
 

4953
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:43,750
you know into another twist
which is the horizontal transfer of

4954
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:43,760
which is the horizontal transfer of
 

4955
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:45,270
which is the horizontal transfer of
humans

with fellowships
 

4959
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:49,189
with fellowships
and the fact that

4960
01:29:49,189 --> 01:29:49,199
and the fact that
 

4961
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:51,669
and the fact that
as people apply to mit from around the

4962
01:29:51,669 --> 01:29:51,679
as people apply to mit from around the
 

4963
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:53,030
as people apply to mit from around the
world

4964
01:29:53,030 --> 01:29:53,040
world
 

4965
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:55,669
world
there's a selection that happens

4966
01:29:55,669 --> 01:29:55,679
there's a selection that happens
 

4967
01:29:55,679 --> 01:29:58,070
there's a selection that happens
not just for their ideas

4968
01:29:58,070 --> 01:29:58,080
not just for their ideas
 

4969
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:00,629
not just for their ideas
but also for the cognitive hardware

4970
01:30:00,629 --> 01:30:00,639
but also for the cognitive hardware
 

4971
01:30:00,639 --> 01:30:02,870
but also for the cognitive hardware
that came up with those ideas

4972
01:30:02,870 --> 01:30:02,880
that came up with those ideas
 

4973
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,629
that came up with those ideas
so we don't just ship ideas around

4974
01:30:04,629 --> 01:30:04,639
so we don't just ship ideas around
 

4975
01:30:04,639 --> 01:30:07,189
so we don't just ship ideas around
anymore they don't evolve in a vacuum

4976
01:30:07,189 --> 01:30:07,199
anymore they don't evolve in a vacuum
 

4977
01:30:07,199 --> 01:30:09,990
anymore they don't evolve in a vacuum
the ideas themselves influence

4978
01:30:09,990 --> 01:30:10,000
the ideas themselves influence
 

4979
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,390
the ideas themselves influence
the distribution of cognitive systems

4980
01:30:12,390 --> 01:30:12,400
the distribution of cognitive systems
 

4981
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,390
the distribution of cognitive systems
i.e humans and brains

4982
01:30:14,390 --> 01:30:14,400
i.e humans and brains
 

4983
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,229
i.e humans and brains
around the planet yeah we ship them to

4984
01:30:16,229 --> 01:30:16,239
around the planet yeah we ship them to
 

4985
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:17,750
around the planet yeah we ship them to
different locations based on their

4986
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:17,760
different locations based on their
 

4987
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:19,590
different locations based on their
properties that's exactly right

4988
01:30:19,590 --> 01:30:19,600
properties that's exactly right
 

4989
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:22,470
properties that's exactly right
so so those cognitive systems that think

4990
01:30:22,470 --> 01:30:22,480
so so those cognitive systems that think
 

4991
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:24,950
so so those cognitive systems that think
of you know physics for example might go

4992
01:30:24,950 --> 01:30:24,960
of you know physics for example might go
 

4993
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:28,229
of you know physics for example might go
to cern and those that think of genomics

4994
01:30:28,229 --> 01:30:28,239
to cern and those that think of genomics
 

4995
01:30:28,239 --> 01:30:30,310
to cern and those that think of genomics
might go to the broad institute

4996
01:30:30,310 --> 01:30:30,320
might go to the broad institute
 

4997
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:31,990
might go to the broad institute
and those that think of computer science

4998
01:30:31,990 --> 01:30:32,000
and those that think of computer science
 

4999
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,990
and those that think of computer science
might go to i don't know stanford or cmu

5000
01:30:33,990 --> 01:30:34,000
might go to i don't know stanford or cmu
 

5001
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,750
might go to i don't know stanford or cmu
or mit

5002
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:35,760
or mit
 

5003
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:37,910
or mit
and you basically have this co-evolution

5004
01:30:37,910 --> 01:30:37,920
and you basically have this co-evolution
 

5005
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:42,870
and you basically have this co-evolution
now of memes and ideas and the cognitive

5006
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:42,880
now of memes and ideas and the cognitive
 

5007
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:45,430
now of memes and ideas and the cognitive
conversational systems that

5008
01:30:45,430 --> 01:30:45,440
conversational systems that
 

5009
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,110
conversational systems that
love these ideas and feed on these ideas

5010
01:30:47,110 --> 01:30:47,120
love these ideas and feed on these ideas
 

5011
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:48,070
love these ideas and feed on these ideas
and understand these ideas and

5012
01:30:48,070 --> 01:30:48,080
and understand these ideas and
 

5013
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:50,149
and understand these ideas and
appreciate these ideas

5014
01:30:50,149 --> 01:30:50,159
appreciate these ideas
 

5015
01:30:50,159 --> 01:30:51,990
appreciate these ideas
now coming together

5016
01:30:51,990 --> 01:30:52,000
now coming together
 

5017
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,070
now coming together
so you basically have

5018
01:30:54,070 --> 01:30:54,080
so you basically have
 

5019
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,910
so you basically have
students coming to boston to study

01:30:57,430 --> 01:30:57,440
because that's the place where these
 

5023
01:30:57,440 --> 01:31:00,950
because that's the place where these
type of cognitive systems thrive

people now

5128
01:32:57,030 --> 01:32:57,040
people now
 

5129
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:59,350
people now
form groups on the internet that they

5130
01:32:59,350 --> 01:32:59,360
form groups on the internet that they
 

5131
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:01,990
form groups on the internet that they
stick together so they

5132
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:02,000
stick together so they
 

5133
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,910
stick together so they
they can sort of uh

5134
01:33:03,910 --> 01:33:03,920
they can sort of uh
 

5135
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:07,270
they can sort of uh
these cognitive systems can

5136
01:33:07,270 --> 01:33:07,280
these cognitive systems can
 

5137
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:09,910
these cognitive systems can
collect themselves and uh

5138
01:33:09,910 --> 01:33:09,920
collect themselves and uh
 

5139
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:12,790
collect themselves and uh
breed together uh on in in different

5140
01:33:12,790 --> 01:33:12,800
breed together uh on in in different
 

5141
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:15,030
breed together uh on in in different
layers of spaces it doesn't just have to

5142
01:33:15,030 --> 01:33:15,040
layers of spaces it doesn't just have to
 

5143
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:17,030
layers of spaces it doesn't just have to
be physical space absolutely absolutely

5144
01:33:17,030 --> 01:33:17,040
be physical space absolutely absolutely
 

5145
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:18,629
be physical space absolutely absolutely
so basically there's the physical

5146
01:33:18,629 --> 01:33:18,639
so basically there's the physical
 

5147
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:20,629
so basically there's the physical
rearrangement but there's also the

5148
01:33:20,629 --> 01:33:20,639
rearrangement but there's also the
 

5149
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:22,390
rearrangement but there's also the
conglomeration of

5150
01:33:22,390 --> 01:33:22,400
conglomeration of
 

5151
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,629
conglomeration of
the same cognitive system doesn't need

5152
01:33:24,629 --> 01:33:24,639
the same cognitive system doesn't need
 

5153
01:33:24,639 --> 01:33:26,550
the same cognitive system doesn't need
to be a human

5154
01:33:26,550 --> 01:33:26,560
to be a human
 

5155
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:27,910
to be a human
it doesn't need to belong to only one

5156
01:33:27,910 --> 01:33:27,920
it doesn't need to belong to only one
 

5157
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:29,910
it doesn't need to belong to only one
community yeah so yes you might be a

5158
01:33:29,910 --> 01:33:29,920
community yeah so yes you might be a
 

5159
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:30,870
community yeah so yes you might be a
member of the computer science

5160
01:33:30,870 --> 01:33:30,880
member of the computer science
 

5161
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:32,470
member of the computer science
department but you can also hang out in

5162
01:33:32,470 --> 01:33:32,480
department but you can also hang out in
 

5163
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:34,070
department but you can also hang out in
the biology department but you might

5164
01:33:34,070 --> 01:33:34,080
the biology department but you might
 

5165
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,990
the biology department but you might
also go online online into i don't know

5166
01:33:35,990 --> 01:33:36,000
also go online online into i don't know
 

5167
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,310
also go online online into i don't know
poetry department uh readings and so

5168
01:33:38,310 --> 01:33:38,320
poetry department uh readings and so
 

5169
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:39,750
poetry department uh readings and so
forth or you might be

5170
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:39,760
forth or you might be
 

5171
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:41,590
forth or you might be
part of a group that only has 12 people

5172
01:33:41,590 --> 01:33:41,600
part of a group that only has 12 people
 

5173
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:42,629
part of a group that only has 12 people
in the world

5174
01:33:42,629 --> 01:33:42,639
in the world
 

5175
01:33:42,639 --> 01:33:44,229
in the world
but that are connected through their

5176
01:33:44,229 --> 01:33:44,239
but that are connected through their
 

5177
01:33:44,239 --> 01:33:47,110
but that are connected through their
ideas and are now interbreeding these

5178
01:33:47,110 --> 01:33:47,120
ideas and are now interbreeding these
 

5179
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:49,270
ideas and are now interbreeding these
ideas in a whole other way

5180
01:33:49,270 --> 01:33:49,280
ideas in a whole other way
 

5181
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:50,709
ideas in a whole other way
so this um

5182
01:33:50,709 --> 01:33:50,719
so this um
 

5183
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:53,270
so this um
this coevolution of genes and memes is

5184
01:33:53,270 --> 01:33:53,280
this coevolution of genes and memes is
 

5185
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:55,350
this coevolution of genes and memes is
not just physically instantiated it's

5186
01:33:55,350 --> 01:33:55,360
not just physically instantiated it's
 

5187
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:57,669
not just physically instantiated it's
also sort of rearranged

5188
01:33:57,669 --> 01:33:57,679
also sort of rearranged
 

5189
01:33:57,679 --> 01:34:00,629
also sort of rearranged
you know in this cognitive uh space as

5190
01:34:00,629 --> 01:34:00,639
you know in this cognitive uh space as
 

5191
01:34:00,639 --> 01:34:01,669
you know in this cognitive uh space as
well

5192
01:34:01,669 --> 01:34:01,679
well
 

5193
01:34:01,679 --> 01:34:03,750
well
and uh and sometimes these cognitive

5194
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:03,760
and uh and sometimes these cognitive
 

5195
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:05,830
and uh and sometimes these cognitive
systems hold conferences and they all

5196
01:34:05,830 --> 01:34:05,840
systems hold conferences and they all
 

5197
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:07,669
systems hold conferences and they all
get gather around and there's like one

5198
01:34:07,669 --> 01:34:07,679
get gather around and there's like one
 

5199
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:09,350
get gather around and there's like one
of them is like talking and they're all

5200
01:34:09,350 --> 01:34:09,360
of them is like talking and they're all
 

5201
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:11,350
of them is like talking and they're all
like listening and then you discuss and

5202
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:11,360
like listening and then you discuss and
 

5203
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:13,189
like listening and then you discuss and
then they have free lunch and so on no

5204
01:34:13,189 --> 01:34:13,199
then they have free lunch and so on no
 

5205
01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:14,870
then they have free lunch and so on no
but but then that's where you find

5206
01:34:14,870 --> 01:34:14,880
but but then that's where you find
 

5207
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:17,590
but but then that's where you find
students where you know when when i go

5208
01:34:17,590 --> 01:34:17,600
students where you know when when i go
 

5209
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,350
students where you know when when i go
to a conference i go through the posters

5210
01:34:19,350 --> 01:34:19,360
to a conference i go through the posters
 

5211
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:21,510
to a conference i go through the posters
where i'm on a mission basically my

5212
01:34:21,510 --> 01:34:21,520
where i'm on a mission basically my
 

5213
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:23,669
where i'm on a mission basically my
mission is to read and understand what

5214
01:34:23,669 --> 01:34:23,679
mission is to read and understand what
 

5215
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:25,590
mission is to read and understand what
every poster is about and for a few of

5216
01:34:25,590 --> 01:34:25,600
every poster is about and for a few of
 

5217
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:26,870
every poster is about and for a few of
them i'll dive deeply and understand

5218
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:26,880
them i'll dive deeply and understand
 

5219
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:28,870
them i'll dive deeply and understand
everything but i make it a point to just

5220
01:34:28,870 --> 01:34:28,880
everything but i make it a point to just
 

5221
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:30,950
everything but i make it a point to just
go post after posting in order to read

5222
01:34:30,950 --> 01:34:30,960
go post after posting in order to read
 

5223
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:33,750
go post after posting in order to read
all of them and i find some gems and

5224
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:33,760
all of them and i find some gems and
 

5225
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:35,910
all of them and i find some gems and
students that i speak to that sometimes

5226
01:34:35,910 --> 01:34:35,920
students that i speak to that sometimes
 

5227
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:37,750
students that i speak to that sometimes
eventually join my lab

5228
01:34:37,750 --> 01:34:37,760
eventually join my lab
 

5229
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:39,669
eventually join my lab
and then sort of you're you're sort of

5230
01:34:39,669 --> 01:34:39,679
and then sort of you're you're sort of
 

5231
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:43,430
and then sort of you're you're sort of
creating this permeation of you know the

01:34:43,430 --> 01:34:43,440
creating this permeation of you know the
 

5233
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:45,189
creating this permeation of you know the

in you know uninhibited behaviors and so
 

5273
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:27,990
in you know uninhibited behaviors and so
forth so you basically can choose

forth so you basically can choose
 

5275
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,830
forth so you basically can choose
yourself to surround

5277
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:31,990
yourself to surround
you can choose to surround yourself with

01:35:31,990 --> 01:35:32,000
you can choose to surround yourself with
 

5279
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,790
you can choose to surround yourself with
people who are not only cognitively

01:35:34,790 --> 01:35:34,800
people who are not only cognitively

01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:36,070
people who are not only cognitively
compatible

compatible
 

5283
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:37,750
compatible
but also

5284
01:35:37,750 --> 01:35:37,760
but also
 

5285
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:41,270
but also
you know imperceptibly through the meta

5286

when i say compatible

5290
01:35:45,189 --> 01:35:45,199
when i say compatible
 

5291
01:35:45,199 --> 01:35:46,709
when i say compatible
not all the same

5292
01:35:46,709 --> 01:35:46,719
not all the same
 

5293
01:35:46,719 --> 01:35:48,149
not all the same
sometimes

5294
01:35:48,149 --> 01:35:48,159
sometimes
 

5295
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:48,950
sometimes
you know

5296
01:35:48,950 --> 01:35:48,960
you know
 

5297
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:50,550
you know
sometimes all the time

5298
01:35:50,550 --> 01:35:50,560
sometimes all the time
 

5299
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:52,550
sometimes all the time
the teams are made out of complementary

5300
01:35:52,550 --> 01:35:52,560
the teams are made out of complementary
 

5301
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:54,870
the teams are made out of complementary
components not just compatible but very

5302
01:35:54,870 --> 01:35:54,880
components not just compatible but very
 

5303
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,189
components not just compatible but very
often complementary so in my own team i

5304
01:35:57,189 --> 01:35:57,199
often complementary so in my own team i
 

5305
01:35:57,199 --> 01:35:59,910
often complementary so in my own team i
have a diversity of students who come

5306
01:35:59,910 --> 01:35:59,920
have a diversity of students who come
 

5307
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:01,990
have a diversity of students who come
from very different backgrounds there's

5308
01:36:01,990 --> 01:36:02,000
from very different backgrounds there's
 

5309
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,510
from very different backgrounds there's
a whole spectrum of biology to

5310
01:36:03,510 --> 01:36:03,520
a whole spectrum of biology to
 

5311
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:05,669
a whole spectrum of biology to
computation of course but within biology

5312
01:36:05,669 --> 01:36:05,679
computation of course but within biology
 

5313
01:36:05,679 --> 01:36:06,790
computation of course but within biology
there's a lot of realms within

5314
01:36:06,790 --> 01:36:06,800
there's a lot of realms within
 

5315
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:10,070
there's a lot of realms within
computation there's a lot of rounds and

5316
01:36:10,070 --> 01:36:10,080
computation there's a lot of rounds and
 

5317
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:11,510
computation there's a lot of rounds and
what makes us

5318
01:36:11,510 --> 01:36:11,520
what makes us
 

5319
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:13,270
what makes us
click so well together

5320
01:36:13,270 --> 01:36:13,280
click so well together
 

5321
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:15,669
click so well together
is the fact that not only do we have a

5322
01:36:15,669 --> 01:36:15,679
is the fact that not only do we have a
 

5323
01:36:15,679 --> 01:36:18,149
is the fact that not only do we have a
common mission a common passion and a

5324
01:36:18,149 --> 01:36:18,159
common mission a common passion and a
 

5325
01:36:18,159 --> 01:36:19,189
common mission a common passion and a
common

5326
01:36:19,189 --> 01:36:19,199
common
 

5327
01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:20,470
common
you know

5328
01:36:20,470 --> 01:36:20,480
you know
 

5329
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:22,470
you know
view of the world

5330
01:36:22,470 --> 01:36:22,480
view of the world
 

5331
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:23,189
view of the world
but

5332
01:36:23,189 --> 01:36:23,199
but
 

5333
01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:25,669
but
that were complementary in our skills in

5334
01:36:25,669 --> 01:36:25,679
that were complementary in our skills in
 

5335
01:36:25,679 --> 01:36:27,430
that were complementary in our skills in
our angles with which we accommodate and

5336
01:36:27,430 --> 01:36:27,440
our angles with which we accommodate and
 

5337
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:28,790
our angles with which we accommodate and
so so forth and that's sort of what

5338
01:36:28,790 --> 01:36:28,800
so so forth and that's sort of what
 

5339
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:30,310
so so forth and that's sort of what
makes it click yeah it's fascinating

5340
01:36:30,310 --> 01:36:30,320
makes it click yeah it's fascinating
 

5341
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:31,669
makes it click yeah it's fascinating
that the the

5342
01:36:31,669 --> 01:36:31,679
that the the
 

5343
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:33,590
that the the
the stickiness of

5344
01:36:33,590 --> 01:36:33,600
the stickiness of
 

5345
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:35,990
the stickiness of
multiple cognitive systems together

5346
01:36:35,990 --> 01:36:36,000
multiple cognitive systems together
 

5347
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,229
multiple cognitive systems together
includes both the commonality so you

5348
01:36:38,229 --> 01:36:38,239
includes both the commonality so you
 

5349
01:36:38,239 --> 01:36:40,070
includes both the commonality so you
meet because you're there's some common

5350
01:36:40,070 --> 01:36:40,080
meet because you're there's some common
 

5351
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:42,629
meet because you're there's some common
thing but you stick together

5352
01:36:42,629 --> 01:36:42,639
thing but you stick together
 

5353
01:36:42,639 --> 01:36:45,109
thing but you stick together
because you're dif different

5354
01:36:45,109 --> 01:36:45,119
because you're dif different
 

5355

questions and we were bouncing ideas of
 

5391
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:27,830
questions and we were bouncing ideas of
each other and it was just beautiful

5392

like we basically have these you know

5394
01:37:30,870 --> 01:37:30,880
like we basically have these you know
 

5395
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,070
like we basically have these you know
basically

5396
01:37:32,070 --> 01:37:32,080
basically
 

5397
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:33,430
basically
cognitive

5398
01:37:33,430 --> 01:37:33,440
cognitive
 

5399
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:36,070
cognitive
you know let it all loose kind of dates

5400
01:37:36,070 --> 01:37:36,080
you know let it all loose kind of dates
 

5401
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:38,310
you know let it all loose kind of dates
where you know we just bring papers and

5402
01:37:38,310 --> 01:37:38,320
where you know we just bring papers and
 

5403
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:40,950
where you know we just bring papers and
we're like you know bouncing ideas etc

5404
01:37:40,950 --> 01:37:40,960
we're like you know bouncing ideas etc
 

5405
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:43,669
we're like you know bouncing ideas etc
so you know we have extremely different

5406
01:37:43,669 --> 01:37:43,679
so you know we have extremely different
 

5407
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:47,270
so you know we have extremely different
perspectives but very common you know

5408
01:37:47,270 --> 01:37:47,280
perspectives but very common you know
 

5409
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:49,270
perspectives but very common you know
goals and interests and

5410
01:37:49,270 --> 01:37:49,280
goals and interests and
 

5411
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:50,790
goals and interests and
anyway what do you make of the

5412
01:37:50,790 --> 01:37:50,800
anyway what do you make of the
 

5413
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:52,870
anyway what do you make of the
communication mechanism that we humans

5414
01:37:52,870 --> 01:37:52,880
communication mechanism that we humans
 

5415
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:54,790
communication mechanism that we humans
use to share those ideas because like

5416
01:37:54,790 --> 01:37:54,800
use to share those ideas because like
 

5417
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:57,350
use to share those ideas because like
one essential element of all of this is

5418
01:37:57,350 --> 01:37:57,360
one essential element of all of this is
 

5419
01:37:57,360 --> 01:38:00,310
one essential element of all of this is
not just that we're able to

5420
01:38:00,310 --> 01:38:00,320
not just that we're able to
 

5421
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:02,629
not just that we're able to
have these ideas but we're also able to

5422
01:38:02,629 --> 01:38:02,639
have these ideas but we're also able to
 

5423
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:05,430
have these ideas but we're also able to
share them we tend to maybe you can

5424
01:38:05,430 --> 01:38:05,440
share them we tend to maybe you can
 

5425
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:08,070
share them we tend to maybe you can
correct me but we seem to use

5426
01:38:08,070 --> 01:38:08,080
correct me but we seem to use
 

5427
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:10,470
correct me but we seem to use
language to share the ideas maybe we

5428
01:38:10,470 --> 01:38:10,480
language to share the ideas maybe we
 

5429
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:12,149
language to share the ideas maybe we
share them in some much deeper way than

5430
01:38:12,149 --> 01:38:12,159
share them in some much deeper way than
 

5431
01:38:12,159 --> 01:38:13,910
share them in some much deeper way than
language i don't know but what do you

5432
01:38:13,910 --> 01:38:13,920
language i don't know but what do you
 

5433
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:15,990
language i don't know but what do you
make of this whole mechanism and how

5434
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:16,000
make of this whole mechanism and how
 

5435
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,669
make of this whole mechanism and how
fundamental it is to

5436
01:38:17,669 --> 01:38:17,679
fundamental it is to
 

5437
01:38:17,679 --> 01:38:19,590
fundamental it is to
the human condition so some people will

5438
01:38:19,590 --> 01:38:19,600
the human condition so some people will
 

5439
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:21,750
the human condition so some people will
tell you that your language

5440
01:38:21,750 --> 01:38:21,760
tell you that your language
 

5441
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:23,830
tell you that your language
dictates your thoughts and your thoughts

5442
01:38:23,830 --> 01:38:23,840
dictates your thoughts and your thoughts
 

5443
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:26,149
dictates your thoughts and your thoughts
cannot form outside language

5444
01:38:26,149 --> 01:38:26,159
cannot form outside language
 

5445
01:38:26,159 --> 01:38:27,830
cannot form outside language
i tend to disagree

i see
uh thoughts as

5450
01:38:31,830 --> 01:38:31,840
uh thoughts as
 

5451
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:34,149
uh thoughts as
much more abstract as you know basically

5452
01:38:34,149 --> 01:38:34,159
much more abstract as you know basically
 

5453
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:36,550

uh shape and dream and concept and in

5496
01:39:20,310 --> 01:39:20,320
uh shape and dream and concept and in
 

5497
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:22,390
uh shape and dream and concept and in
the same way when i'm thinking of ideas

5498
01:39:22,390 --> 01:39:22,400
the same way when i'm thinking of ideas
 

5499
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:23,990
the same way when i'm thinking of ideas
there's so many ideas i can't put two

5500
01:39:23,990 --> 01:39:24,000
there's so many ideas i can't put two
 

5501
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,189
there's so many ideas i can't put two
words

words
 

5503
01:39:25,199 --> 01:39:26,470
words
i mean i will describe him with a

5504
01:39:26,470 --> 01:39:26,480
i mean i will describe him with a
 

5505
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:28,790
i mean i will describe him with a
thousand words but the idea itself is

5506
01:39:28,790 --> 01:39:28,800
thousand words but the idea itself is
 

5507
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:30,790
thousand words but the idea itself is
much more precise or much more sort of

5508
01:39:30,790 --> 01:39:30,800
much more precise or much more sort of
 

5509
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:33,590
much more precise or much more sort of
abstract or much more something you know

5510
01:39:33,590 --> 01:39:33,600
abstract or much more something you know
 

5511
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:35,750
abstract or much more something you know
difference either less abstract or more

5512
01:39:35,750 --> 01:39:35,760
difference either less abstract or more
 

5513
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:38,470
difference either less abstract or more
abstract and it's either you know

5514
01:39:38,470 --> 01:39:38,480
abstract and it's either you know
 

5515
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:40,550
abstract and it's either you know
basically the

5516
01:39:40,550 --> 01:39:40,560
basically the
 

5517
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:42,790
basically the
there's just a projection that happens

5518
01:39:42,790 --> 01:39:42,800
there's just a projection that happens
 

5519
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:45,189
there's just a projection that happens
from the three-dimensional ideas into

5520
01:39:45,189 --> 01:39:45,199
from the three-dimensional ideas into
 

5521
01:39:45,199 --> 01:39:48,470
from the three-dimensional ideas into
let's say a one-dimensional language

5522
01:39:48,470 --> 01:39:48,480
let's say a one-dimensional language
 

5523
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:50,310
let's say a one-dimensional language
and the language certainly gives you the

5524
01:39:50,310 --> 01:39:50,320
and the language certainly gives you the
 

5525
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:52,470
and the language certainly gives you the
apparatus to think about concepts that

5526
01:39:52,470 --> 01:39:52,480
apparatus to think about concepts that
 

5527
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:54,950
apparatus to think about concepts that
you didn't realize existed before

5528
01:39:54,950 --> 01:39:54,960
you didn't realize existed before
 

5529
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:57,189
you didn't realize existed before
and with my team we often create new

5530
01:39:57,189 --> 01:39:57,199
and with my team we often create new
 

5531
01:39:57,199 --> 01:39:58,950
and with my team we often create new
words i'm like well now we're going to

5532
01:39:58,950 --> 01:39:58,960
words i'm like well now we're going to
 

5533
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:00,550
words i'm like well now we're going to
call this the regulatory plexus of a

5534
01:40:00,550 --> 01:40:00,560
call this the regulatory plexus of a
 

5535
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:01,350
call this the regulatory plexus of a
gene

5536
01:40:01,350 --> 01:40:01,360
gene
 

5537
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:03,030
gene
and that gives us now the language to

5538
01:40:03,030 --> 01:40:03,040
and that gives us now the language to
 

5539
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:05,669
and that gives us now the language to
sort of build on that as one concept

5540
01:40:05,669 --> 01:40:05,679
sort of build on that as one concept
 

5541
01:40:05,679 --> 01:40:07,350
sort of build on that as one concept
that you then build upon with all kinds

5542
01:40:07,350 --> 01:40:07,360
that you then build upon with all kinds
 

5543
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:10,709
that you then build upon with all kinds
of other other things so there's this

5544
01:40:10,709 --> 01:40:10,719
of other other things so there's this
 

5545
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:13,030
of other other things so there's this
co-evolution again of ideas and language

5546
01:40:13,030 --> 01:40:13,040
co-evolution again of ideas and language
 

5547
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:15,669
co-evolution again of ideas and language
but they're not one-to-one uh with each

5548
01:40:15,669 --> 01:40:15,679
but they're not one-to-one uh with each
 

5549
01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:17,510
but they're not one-to-one uh with each
other now let's talk about language

5550
01:40:17,510 --> 01:40:17,520
other now let's talk about language
 

5551
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:18,470
other now let's talk about language
itself

5552
01:40:18,470 --> 01:40:18,480
itself
 

5553
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:19,990

01:40:22,390 --> 01:40:22,400
this is
 

5559
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,149
this is
a very

01:40:24,149 --> 01:40:24,159
a very
 

5561
01:40:24,159 --> 01:40:25,990
a very
distant construct from where language

5562
01:40:25,990 --> 01:40:26,000
distant construct from where language
 

5563
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,510
distant construct from where language

so if you look at how we communicate

5566
01:40:30,870 --> 01:40:30,880
so if you look at how we communicate
 

5567
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:34,070
so if you look at how we communicate
as i'm speaking my eyes are shining

as i'm speaking my eyes are shining
 

5569
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:35,830
as i'm speaking my eyes are shining
and my face is changing through all

kinds of emotions
 

5573
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:40,390
kinds of emotions
and my entire body composition posture

5574
01:40:40,390 --> 01:40:40,400
and my entire body composition posture
 

5575
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:42,470
and my entire body composition posture
is reshaped

5576
01:40:42,470 --> 01:40:42,480
is reshaped
 

5577
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:45,430
is reshaped
and my intonation the pauses that i make

5578
01:40:45,430 --> 01:40:45,440
and my intonation the pauses that i make
 

5579
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:47,669
and my intonation the pauses that i make
the softer and the louder and this and

5580
01:40:47,669 --> 01:40:47,679
the softer and the louder and this and
 

5581
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:49,109
the softer and the louder and this and
that are

5582
01:40:49,109 --> 01:40:49,119
that are
 

5583
01:40:49,119 --> 01:40:51,830
that are
conveying so much more information

5584
01:40:51,830 --> 01:40:51,840
conveying so much more information
 

5585
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:52,790
conveying so much more information
and

5586
01:40:52,790 --> 01:40:52,800
and
 

5587
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:55,189
and
if you look at early human language

5588
01:40:55,189 --> 01:40:55,199
if you look at early human language
 

5589
01:40:55,199 --> 01:40:57,189
if you look at early human language
and if you look at how

5590
01:40:57,189 --> 01:40:57,199
and if you look at how
 

5591
01:40:57,199 --> 01:40:58,709
and if you look at how
you know the great apes communicate with

5592
01:40:58,709 --> 01:40:58,719
you know the great apes communicate with
 

5593
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:00,390
you know the great apes communicate with
each other there's a lot of granting

5594
01:41:00,390 --> 01:41:00,400
each other there's a lot of granting
 

5595
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:01,669
each other there's a lot of granting
there's a lot of postering there's a lot

5596
01:41:01,669 --> 01:41:01,679
there's a lot of postering there's a lot
 

5597
01:41:01,679 --> 01:41:03,189
there's a lot of postering there's a lot
of emotions there's a lot of sort of

5598
01:41:03,189 --> 01:41:03,199
of emotions there's a lot of sort of
 

5599
01:41:03,199 --> 01:41:04,709
of emotions there's a lot of sort of
shrieking etc

5600
01:41:04,709 --> 01:41:04,719
shrieking etc
 

5601
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:05,750
shrieking etc
they have

5602
01:41:05,750 --> 01:41:05,760
they have
 

5603
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:08,550
they have
a lot of components of our

5604
01:41:08,550 --> 01:41:08,560
a lot of components of our
 

5605
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:10,229
a lot of components of our
human language

5606
01:41:10,229 --> 01:41:10,239
human language
 

5607
01:41:10,239 --> 01:41:12,709
human language
just not the words

5608
01:41:12,709 --> 01:41:12,719
just not the words
 

5609
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:13,510
just not the words
so

5610
01:41:13,510 --> 01:41:13,520
so
 

5611
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:17,109
so
i think of human communication

5612
01:41:17,109 --> 01:41:17,119
i think of human communication
 

5613
01:41:17,119 --> 01:41:19,189
i think of human communication
as combining

5614
01:41:19,189 --> 01:41:19,199
as combining
 

5615
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:23,189
as combining
the ape component but also of course the

5616
01:41:23,189 --> 01:41:23,199
the ape component but also of course the
 

5617
01:41:23,199 --> 01:41:25,590
the ape component but also of course the
you know gpt3 component so basically

5618
01:41:25,590 --> 01:41:25,600
you know gpt3 component so basically
 

5619
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:27,990
you know gpt3 component so basically
there's the cognitive layer and the

5620
01:41:27,990 --> 01:41:28,000
there's the cognitive layer and the
 

5621
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,229
there's the cognitive layer and the
reasoning layer that we share with

5622
01:41:30,229 --> 01:41:30,239
reasoning layer that we share with
 

5623
01:41:30,239 --> 01:41:32,790
reasoning layer that we share with
different parts of our relatives there's

5624
01:41:32,790 --> 01:41:32,800
different parts of our relatives there's
 

5625
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:35,030
different parts of our relatives there's
the ai relatives but there's also the

5626
01:41:35,030 --> 01:41:35,040
the ai relatives but there's also the
 

5627
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:36,790
the ai relatives but there's also the
grunting relatives

5628
01:41:36,790 --> 01:41:36,800
grunting relatives
 

5629
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:37,590
grunting relatives
and

5630
01:41:37,590 --> 01:41:37,600
and
 

5631
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:39,109
and
what i love about humanity is that we

5632
01:41:39,109 --> 01:41:39,119
what i love about humanity is that we
 

5633
01:41:39,119 --> 01:41:40,709
what i love about humanity is that we
have both we're not just a

5634
01:41:40,709 --> 01:41:40,719
have both we're not just a
 

5635
01:41:40,719 --> 01:41:42,310
have both we're not just a
conversational system

5636
01:41:42,310 --> 01:41:42,320
conversational system
 

5637
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:45,910
conversational system
we're a grunting emotionally charged you

5638
01:41:45,910 --> 01:41:45,920
we're a grunting emotionally charged you
 

5639
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:47,030
we're a grunting emotionally charged you
know

5640
01:41:47,030 --> 01:41:47,040
know
 

5641
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:51,270
know
weirdly intercon connected system that

5642
01:41:51,270 --> 01:41:51,280
weirdly intercon connected system that
 

5643
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:53,510
weirdly intercon connected system that
also has the ability to reason

5644
01:41:53,510 --> 01:41:53,520
also has the ability to reason
 

5645
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:54,470
also has the ability to reason
and

5646
01:41:54,470 --> 01:41:54,480
and
 

5647
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:56,550
and
when when we communicate with each other

5648
01:41:56,550 --> 01:41:56,560
when when we communicate with each other
 

5649
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:58,870
when when we communicate with each other
there's so much more than just language

5650
01:41:58,870 --> 01:41:58,880
there's so much more than just language
 

5651
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:01,030
there's so much more than just language
there's so much more than just words

5652
01:42:01,030 --> 01:42:01,040
there's so much more than just words
 

5653
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:02,629
there's so much more than just words
it does seem like we're able to somehow

5654
01:42:02,629 --> 01:42:02,639
it does seem like we're able to somehow
 

5655
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:03,750
it does seem like we're able to somehow
transfer

5656
01:42:03,750 --> 01:42:03,760
transfer
 

5657
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:06,870
transfer
even more than the the body language it

5658
01:42:06,870 --> 01:42:06,880
even more than the the body language it
 

5659
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:09,430
even more than the the body language it
seems that in the room with us is always

5660
01:42:09,430 --> 01:42:09,440
seems that in the room with us is always
 

5661
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:11,750
seems that in the room with us is always
a giant knowledge base

5662
01:42:11,750 --> 01:42:11,760
a giant knowledge base
 

5663
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:13,030
a giant knowledge base
of like

5664
01:42:13,030 --> 01:42:13,040
of like
 

5665
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:14,870
of like

01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:17,590
shared experiences different
perspectives on those experiences but

perspectives on those experiences but
 

5669
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,430
perspectives on those experiences but
i don't know the knowledge of who the

01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:29,109
the tragedies in 911 all the all the
beautiful and uh terrible things that

5678
01:42:29,109 --> 01:42:29,119
beautiful and uh terrible things that
 

5679
01:42:29,119 --> 01:42:31,109
beautiful and uh terrible things that
happen in the world they're somehow both

5680
01:42:31,109 --> 01:42:31,119
happen in the world they're somehow both
 

5681
01:42:31,119 --> 01:42:32,709
happen in the world they're somehow both
in our minds

5682
01:42:32,709 --> 01:42:32,719
in our minds
 

5683
01:42:32,719 --> 01:42:35,109
in our minds
and somehow enrich the ability to

5684
01:42:35,109 --> 01:42:35,119
and somehow enrich the ability to
 

5685
01:42:35,119 --> 01:42:37,109
and somehow enrich the ability to
transfer information

5686
01:42:37,109 --> 01:42:37,119
transfer information
 

5687
01:42:37,119 --> 01:42:38,709
transfer information
and what i love about it is i can i can

5688
01:42:38,709 --> 01:42:38,719
and what i love about it is i can i can
 

5689
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:40,310
and what i love about it is i can i can
talk to you about 2001 audience of space

5690
01:42:40,310 --> 01:42:40,320
talk to you about 2001 audience of space
 

5691
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:41,910
talk to you about 2001 audience of space
and mention a very specific scene and

5692
01:42:41,910 --> 01:42:41,920
and mention a very specific scene and
 

5693
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:43,189
and mention a very specific scene and
that evokes

5694
01:42:43,189 --> 01:42:43,199
that evokes
 

5695
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:44,709
that evokes
all these feelings that you had when you

5696
01:42:44,709 --> 01:42:44,719
all these feelings that you had when you
 

5697
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:46,470
all these feelings that you had when you
first watched it we're both visualizing

5698
01:42:46,470 --> 01:42:46,480
first watched it we're both visualizing
 

5699
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:49,109
first watched it we're both visualizing
that maybe in different ways exactly but

5700
01:42:49,109 --> 01:42:49,119
that maybe in different ways exactly but
 

5701
01:42:49,119 --> 01:42:52,950
that maybe in different ways exactly but
in that yeah and not only that but the

5702
01:42:52,950 --> 01:42:52,960
in that yeah and not only that but the
 

5703
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:54,149
in that yeah and not only that but the
feeling

5704
01:42:54,149 --> 01:42:54,159
feeling
 

5705
01:42:54,159 --> 01:42:56,550
feeling
uh is brought back up just like you said

5706
01:42:56,550 --> 01:42:56,560
uh is brought back up just like you said
 

5707
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:58,070
uh is brought back up just like you said
with the dreams

5708
01:42:58,070 --> 01:42:58,080
with the dreams
 

5709
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:00,310
with the dreams
we both have that feeling arise in some

5710
01:43:00,310 --> 01:43:00,320
we both have that feeling arise in some
 

5711
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:03,189
we both have that feeling arise in some
form exactly as you bring up the exact

5712
01:43:03,189 --> 01:43:03,199
form exactly as you bring up the exact
 

5713
01:43:03,199 --> 01:43:06,790
form exactly as you bring up the exact
you know uh facing his own mortality

5714
01:43:06,790 --> 01:43:06,800
you know uh facing his own mortality
 

5715
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:08,709
you know uh facing his own mortality
yeah it's fascinating that we're able to

5716
01:43:08,709 --> 01:43:08,719
yeah it's fascinating that we're able to
 

5717
01:43:08,719 --> 01:43:10,470
yeah it's fascinating that we're able to
do that but i don't know

5718
01:43:10,470 --> 01:43:10,480
do that but i don't know
 

5719
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:11,830
do that but i don't know
now let's let's talk about neural link

5720
01:43:11,830 --> 01:43:11,840
now let's let's talk about neural link
 

5721
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:13,669
now let's let's talk about neural link
for a second so what's the concept of

5722
01:43:13,669 --> 01:43:13,679
for a second so what's the concept of
 

5723
01:43:13,679 --> 01:43:15,590
for a second so what's the concept of
generally the concept of neural link is

5724
01:43:15,590 --> 01:43:15,600
generally the concept of neural link is
 

5725
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:17,030
generally the concept of neural link is
that i'm going to take

5726
01:43:17,030 --> 01:43:17,040
that i'm going to take
 

5727
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:18,790
that i'm going to take
whatever knowledge is encoded in my

5728
01:43:18,790 --> 01:43:18,800
whatever knowledge is encoded in my
 

5729
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:19,750
whatever knowledge is encoded in my
brain

5730
01:43:19,750 --> 01:43:19,760
brain
 

5731
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:22,070
brain
directly transfer it into your brain

5732
01:43:22,070 --> 01:43:22,080
directly transfer it into your brain
 

5733
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:22,950
directly transfer it into your brain
so

5734
01:43:22,950 --> 01:43:22,960
so
 

5735
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:25,430
so
this is a beautiful fascinating and

5736
01:43:25,430 --> 01:43:25,440
this is a beautiful fascinating and
 

5737
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:28,070
this is a beautiful fascinating and
extremely sort of you know appealing

5738
01:43:28,070 --> 01:43:28,080
extremely sort of you know appealing
 

5739
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:30,709
extremely sort of you know appealing
concept but i see a lot of challenges

5740
01:43:30,709 --> 01:43:30,719
concept but i see a lot of challenges
 

5741
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:32,070
concept but i see a lot of challenges
surrounding that

5742
01:43:32,070 --> 01:43:32,080
surrounding that
 

5743
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:35,030
surrounding that
the first one is we have no idea how to

5744
01:43:35,030 --> 01:43:35,040
the first one is we have no idea how to
 

5745
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:37,350
the first one is we have no idea how to
even begin to understand how knowledge

5746
01:43:37,350 --> 01:43:37,360
even begin to understand how knowledge
 

5747
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:38,550
even begin to understand how knowledge
is encoded

5748
01:43:38,550 --> 01:43:38,560
is encoded
 

5749
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:39,910
is encoded
in a person's brain

5750
01:43:39,910 --> 01:43:39,920
in a person's brain
 

5751
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:41,189
in a person's brain
i mean i told you about this paper that

5752
01:43:41,189 --> 01:43:41,199
i mean i told you about this paper that
 

5753
01:43:41,199 --> 01:43:43,830
i mean i told you about this paper that
we had recently with liquitai and

5754
01:43:43,830 --> 01:43:43,840
we had recently with liquitai and
 

5755
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:45,350
we had recently with liquitai and
asaf marco

5756
01:43:45,350 --> 01:43:45,360
asaf marco
 

5757
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:47,109
asaf marco
that basically was looking at these

5758
01:43:47,109 --> 01:43:47,119
that basically was looking at these
 

5759
01:43:47,119 --> 01:43:49,350
that basically was looking at these
engrams that are formed with

5760
01:43:49,350 --> 01:43:49,360
engrams that are formed with
 

5761
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:51,430
engrams that are formed with
combinations of neurons that co-fire

5762
01:43:51,430 --> 01:43:51,440
combinations of neurons that co-fire
 

5763
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:53,590
combinations of neurons that co-fire
when a stimulus happens where we can go

5764
01:43:53,590 --> 01:43:53,600
when a stimulus happens where we can go
 

5765
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:55,189
when a stimulus happens where we can go
into a mouse and select those neurons

5766
01:43:55,189 --> 01:43:55,199
into a mouse and select those neurons
 

5767
01:43:55,199 --> 01:43:57,109
into a mouse and select those neurons
that fire by marking them and then see

5768
01:43:57,109 --> 01:43:57,119
that fire by marking them and then see
 

5769
01:43:57,119 --> 01:43:58,790
that fire by marking them and then see
what happens when they first fire and

5770
01:43:58,790 --> 01:43:58,800
what happens when they first fire and
 

5771
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:00,709
what happens when they first fire and
then select the neurons that fire again

5772
01:44:00,709 --> 01:44:00,719
then select the neurons that fire again
 

5773
01:44:00,719 --> 01:44:02,870
then select the neurons that fire again
when the experience is repeated these

5774
01:44:02,870 --> 01:44:02,880
when the experience is repeated these
 

5775
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:05,270
when the experience is repeated these
are the recall neurons and then there's

5776
01:44:05,270 --> 01:44:05,280
are the recall neurons and then there's
 

5777
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:07,990
are the recall neurons and then there's
the the memory consolidation neurons so

5778
01:44:07,990 --> 01:44:08,000
the the memory consolidation neurons so
 

5779
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,669
the the memory consolidation neurons so
we're starting to understand a little

5780
01:44:09,669 --> 01:44:09,679
we're starting to understand a little
 

5781
01:44:09,679 --> 01:44:12,870
we're starting to understand a little
bit of sort of the distributed nature of

5782
01:44:12,870 --> 01:44:12,880
bit of sort of the distributed nature of
 

5783
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:14,790
bit of sort of the distributed nature of
knowledge and coding and experience in

5784
01:44:14,790 --> 01:44:14,800
knowledge and coding and experience in
 

5785
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:16,790
knowledge and coding and experience in
coding in the human brain and in the

5786
01:44:16,790 --> 01:44:16,800
coding in the human brain and in the
 

5787
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:17,910
coding in the human brain and in the
mouse brain

5788
01:44:17,910 --> 01:44:17,920
mouse brain
 

5789
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:19,590
mouse brain
and

5790
01:44:19,590 --> 01:44:19,600
and
 

5791
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:21,590
and
the concept that we'll understand that

5792
01:44:21,590 --> 01:44:21,600
the concept that we'll understand that
 

5793
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:23,750
the concept that we'll understand that
sufficiently one day

5794
01:44:23,750 --> 01:44:23,760
sufficiently one day
 

5795
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:24,550
sufficiently one day
to

5796
01:44:24,550 --> 01:44:24,560
to
 

5797
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:27,590
to
be able to take a snapshot of

5798
01:44:27,590 --> 01:44:27,600
be able to take a snapshot of
 

5799
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:29,189
be able to take a snapshot of
what does that seem

5800
01:44:29,189 --> 01:44:29,199
what does that seem
 

5801
01:44:29,199 --> 01:44:30,310
what does that seem
from

5802
01:44:30,310 --> 01:44:30,320
from
 

5803
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:33,109
from
dave losing his mind of how losing his

5804
01:44:33,109 --> 01:44:33,119
dave losing his mind of how losing his
 

5805
01:44:33,119 --> 01:44:36,470
dave losing his mind of how losing his
mind and talking to dave um

5806
01:44:36,470 --> 01:44:36,480
mind and talking to dave um
 

5807
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:39,350
mind and talking to dave um
how is that seen encoded in your mind

5808
01:44:39,350 --> 01:44:39,360
how is that seen encoded in your mind
 

5809
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:41,669
how is that seen encoded in your mind
imagine the complexity of that but now

5810
01:44:41,669 --> 01:44:41,679
imagine the complexity of that but now
 

5811
01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:43,270
imagine the complexity of that but now
imagine

5812
01:44:43,270 --> 01:44:43,280
imagine
 

5813
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:45,750
imagine
suppose that we solve this problem

5814
01:44:45,750 --> 01:44:45,760
suppose that we solve this problem
 

5815
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:46,629
suppose that we solve this problem
and

5816
01:44:46,629 --> 01:44:46,639
and
 

5817
01:44:46,639 --> 01:44:48,550
and
the next enormous challenge is how do i

5818
01:44:48,550 --> 01:44:48,560
the next enormous challenge is how do i
 

5819
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:51,109
the next enormous challenge is how do i
go and modify the next person's brain to

5820
01:44:51,109 --> 01:44:51,119
go and modify the next person's brain to
 

5821
01:44:51,119 --> 01:44:53,109
go and modify the next person's brain to
now create the same exact neural

5822
01:44:53,109 --> 01:44:53,119
now create the same exact neural
 

5823
01:44:53,119 --> 01:44:54,149
now create the same exact neural
connections

5824
01:44:54,149 --> 01:44:54,159
connections
 

5825
01:44:54,159 --> 01:44:55,750
connections
so that's an enormous challenge right

5826
01:44:55,750 --> 01:44:55,760
so that's an enormous challenge right
 

5827
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:57,830
so that's an enormous challenge right
there so basically it's not just reading

5828
01:44:57,830 --> 01:44:57,840
there so basically it's not just reading
 

5829
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:00,070
there so basically it's not just reading
it's not writing

5830
01:45:00,070 --> 01:45:00,080
it's not writing
 

5831
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:02,149
it's not writing
and again what if something goes wrong i

5832
01:45:02,149 --> 01:45:02,159
and again what if something goes wrong i
 

5833
01:45:02,159 --> 01:45:03,910
and again what if something goes wrong i
don't want to even think about that

5834
01:45:03,910 --> 01:45:03,920
don't want to even think about that
 

5835
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:06,709
don't want to even think about that
that's number two and number three

5836
01:45:06,709 --> 01:45:06,719
that's number two and number three
 

5837
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:09,510
that's number two and number three
who says that the way that you encode

who says that the way that you encode
dave i'm losing my mind

5840
01:45:11,350 --> 01:45:11,360
dave i'm losing my mind
 

5841
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:14,709
dave i'm losing my mind
and i encode dave i'm losing my mind

5842
01:45:14,709 --> 01:45:14,719
and i encode dave i'm losing my mind
 

5843
01:45:14,719 --> 01:45:17,189
and i encode dave i'm losing my mind
is anywhere near each other

5844
01:45:17,189 --> 01:45:17,199
is anywhere near each other
 

5845
01:45:17,199 --> 01:45:18,310
is anywhere near each other
basically maybe the way that i'm

5846
01:45:18,310 --> 01:45:18,320
basically maybe the way that i'm
 

5847
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:19,990
basically maybe the way that i'm
encoding it

5848
01:45:19,990 --> 01:45:20,000
encoding it
 

5849
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:23,350
encoding it
is twisted with my childhood memories of

01:45:23,350 --> 01:45:23,360
is twisted with my childhood memories of

and
 

5861
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:34,149
and
there's no way that i can take my

there's no way that i can take my

encoding and put it into your brain
 

5865
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:37,990
encoding and put it into your brain
because it'll a mess things up

5866
01:45:37,990 --> 01:45:38,000
because it'll a mess things up
 

5867
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,510
because it'll a mess things up
and b be incompatible with your own

communication from human to humor it's
 

5873
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:48,229
communication from human to humor it's
fascinating you're you're reminding

5874
01:45:48,229 --> 01:45:48,239
fascinating you're you're reminding
 

5875
01:45:48,239 --> 01:45:50,709
fascinating you're you're reminding
us that uh there's there's uh two

5876
01:45:50,709 --> 01:45:50,719
us that uh there's there's uh two
 

5877
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:53,030
us that uh there's there's uh two
biological systems on both ends of that

5878
01:45:53,030 --> 01:45:53,040
biological systems on both ends of that
 

5879
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:55,270
biological systems on both ends of that
communication and the one the easier i

5880
01:45:55,270 --> 01:45:55,280
communication and the one the easier i
 

5881
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:56,149
communication and the one the easier i
guess

5882
01:45:56,149 --> 01:45:56,159
guess
 

5883
01:45:56,159 --> 01:45:58,790
guess
may be half as difficult

5884
01:45:58,790 --> 01:45:58,800
may be half as difficult
 

5885
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:00,390
may be half as difficult
a thing to do and the hope with neural

5886
01:46:00,390 --> 01:46:00,400
a thing to do and the hope with neural
 

5887
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:01,830
a thing to do and the hope with neural
link is that

5888
01:46:01,830 --> 01:46:01,840
link is that
 

5889
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:04,790
link is that
we can communicate with an ai system so

5890
01:46:04,790 --> 01:46:04,800
we can communicate with an ai system so
 

5891
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:06,470
we can communicate with an ai system so
yeah where one side of that is a little

5892
01:46:06,470 --> 01:46:06,480
yeah where one side of that is a little
 

5893
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:10,470
yeah where one side of that is a little
bit yeah more controllable but

5894
01:46:10,470 --> 01:46:10,480
bit yeah more controllable but
 

5895
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:12,709
bit yeah more controllable but
but even just that is is exceptionally

5896
01:46:12,709 --> 01:46:12,719
but even just that is is exceptionally
 

5897
01:46:12,719 --> 01:46:15,270
but even just that is is exceptionally
difficult let's talk about two two new

5898
01:46:15,270 --> 01:46:15,280
difficult let's talk about two two new
 

5899
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:16,709
difficult let's talk about two two new
neuronal systems talking to each other

keep talking

5932
01:46:48,070 --> 01:46:48,080
keep talking
 

5933
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:49,990
keep talking
keep talking and just re-encode it all

5934
01:46:49,990 --> 01:46:50,000
keep talking and just re-encode it all
 

5935
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,390
keep talking and just re-encode it all
together so maybe what language does is

5936
01:46:52,390 --> 01:46:52,400
together so maybe what language does is
 

5937
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:55,109
together so maybe what language does is
exactly that it's taking one generative

cognitive model

5940
01:46:56,709 --> 01:46:56,719
cognitive model
 

5941
01:46:56,719 --> 01:46:58,870
cognitive model
it's running it forward to emit

5942
01:46:58,870 --> 01:46:58,880
it's running it forward to emit
 

5943
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:00,629
it's running it forward to emit
utterances that kind of make sense in my

5944
01:47:00,629 --> 01:47:00,639
utterances that kind of make sense in my
 

5945
01:47:00,639 --> 01:47:02,629
utterances that kind of make sense in my
cognitive frame and it's re-encoding

5946
01:47:02,629 --> 01:47:02,639
cognitive frame and it's re-encoding
 

5947
01:47:02,639 --> 01:47:04,149
cognitive frame and it's re-encoding
them into yours

5948
01:47:04,149 --> 01:47:04,159
them into yours
 

5949
01:47:04,159 --> 01:47:06,629
them into yours
through the parsing of that same

5950
01:47:06,629 --> 01:47:06,639
through the parsing of that same
 

5951
01:47:06,639 --> 01:47:08,470
through the parsing of that same
language and i think the conversation

5952
01:47:08,470 --> 01:47:08,480
language and i think the conversation
 

5953
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:10,310
language and i think the conversation
might might actually be the most

5954
01:47:10,310 --> 01:47:10,320
might might actually be the most
 

5955
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:12,070
might might actually be the most
efficient way to do it so not just

5956
01:47:12,070 --> 01:47:12,080
efficient way to do it so not just
 

5957
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:14,950
efficient way to do it so not just
talking but uh interactive so talking

5958
01:47:14,950 --> 01:47:14,960
talking but uh interactive so talking
 

5959
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:17,030
talking but uh interactive so talking
back and forth yeah asking questions

5960
01:47:17,030 --> 01:47:17,040
back and forth yeah asking questions
 

5961
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:18,229
back and forth yeah asking questions
interrupting

5962
01:47:18,229 --> 01:47:18,239
interrupting
 

5963
01:47:18,239 --> 01:47:26,470
interrupting
so gpth4 will constantly be interrupted

5964
01:47:26,470 --> 01:47:26,480

 

5965
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:28,790

is also that as we're interrupting each

5966
01:47:28,790 --> 01:47:28,800
is also that as we're interrupting each
 

5967
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:29,830
is also that as we're interrupting each
other

5968
01:47:29,830 --> 01:47:29,840
other
 

5969
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:32,070
other
there's all kinds of misinterpretations

5970
01:47:32,070 --> 01:47:32,080
there's all kinds of misinterpretations
 

5971
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:33,350
there's all kinds of misinterpretations
that happen

5972
01:47:33,350 --> 01:47:33,360
that happen
 

5973
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:34,870
that happen
that you know as

5974
01:47:34,870 --> 01:47:34,880
that you know as
 

5975
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:37,189
that you know as
basically when my students speak i will

5976
01:47:37,189 --> 01:47:37,199
basically when my students speak i will
 

5977
01:47:37,199 --> 01:47:38,870
basically when my students speak i will
often know that i'm misunderstanding

5978
01:47:38,870 --> 01:47:38,880
often know that i'm misunderstanding
 

5979
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:40,149
often know that i'm misunderstanding
what they're saying

5980
01:47:40,149 --> 01:47:40,159
what they're saying
 

5981
01:47:40,159 --> 01:47:41,350
what they're saying
and i'll be like

5982
01:47:41,350 --> 01:47:41,360
and i'll be like
 

5983
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:43,350
and i'll be like
hold that thought for a second let me

5984
01:47:43,350 --> 01:47:43,360
hold that thought for a second let me
 

5985
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:44,950
hold that thought for a second let me
tell you what i think i understood which

5986
01:47:44,950 --> 01:47:44,960
tell you what i think i understood which
 

5987
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:46,870
tell you what i think i understood which
i know is different what you said then

5988
01:47:46,870 --> 01:47:46,880
i know is different what you said then
 

5989
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:49,109
i know is different what you said then
i'll say that and then someone else in

5990
01:47:49,109 --> 01:47:49,119
i'll say that and then someone else in
 

5991
01:47:49,119 --> 01:47:51,590
i'll say that and then someone else in
the same zoom meeting will basically say

5992
01:47:51,590 --> 01:47:51,600
the same zoom meeting will basically say
 

5993
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:52,550
the same zoom meeting will basically say
well

5994
01:47:52,550 --> 01:47:52,560
well
 

5995
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:53,990
well
you know here's another way to think

5996
01:47:53,990 --> 01:47:54,000
you know here's another way to think
 

5997
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,310
you know here's another way to think
about what you just said and then by the

5998
01:47:56,310 --> 01:47:56,320

thoughtful and you're connected to a
 

6079
01:49:16,719 --> 01:49:19,109
thoughtful and you're connected to a
bunch like you said students uh your

6080
01:49:19,109 --> 01:49:19,119
bunch like you said students uh your
 

6081
01:49:19,119 --> 01:49:21,189
bunch like you said students uh your
wife your kids

6082
01:49:21,189 --> 01:49:21,199
wife your kids
 

6083
01:49:21,199 --> 01:49:22,709

what do you

6084
01:49:22,709 --> 01:49:22,719
what do you
 

6085
01:49:22,719 --> 01:49:24,950
what do you
in your brief time here on earth this is

6086
01:49:24,950 --> 01:49:24,960
in your brief time here on earth this is
 

6087
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:27,189
in your brief time here on earth this is
a meaning of life episode

6088
01:49:27,189 --> 01:49:27,199
a meaning of life episode
 

6089
01:49:27,199 --> 01:49:29,990
a meaning of life episode
so uh what do you hope

6090
01:49:29,990 --> 01:49:30,000
so uh what do you hope
 

6091
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,550
so uh what do you hope
this world will remember you as

6095
01:49:36,639 --> 01:49:38,790

i don't think of legacy

6096
01:49:38,790 --> 01:49:38,800
i don't think of legacy
 

6097
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:41,350
i don't think of legacy
as much as

6098
01:49:41,350 --> 01:49:41,360
as much as
 

6099
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:43,350
as much as
maybe most people things

6100
01:49:43,350 --> 01:49:43,360
maybe most people things
 

6101
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:45,430

it's funny to be both experiencing the

6116
01:50:03,030 --> 01:50:03,040
it's funny to be both experiencing the
 

6117
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:05,430
it's funny to be both experiencing the

past and the present and the future
 

6119
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:07,270
past and the present and the future
but also consciously living in the

01:50:07,270 --> 01:50:07,280
but also consciously living in the
 

6121
01:50:07,280 --> 01:50:08,830
but also consciously living in the

6122
01:50:08,830 --> 01:50:08,840
present and
 

6123
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:11,030
present and
just you know there's a conscious

6124
01:50:11,030 --> 01:50:11,040
just you know there's a conscious
 

6125
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:12,629
just you know there's a conscious
decision we can make to not worry about

6126
01:50:12,629 --> 01:50:12,639
decision we can make to not worry about
 

6127
01:50:12,639 --> 01:50:13,910
decision we can make to not worry about
all that

6128
01:50:13,910 --> 01:50:13,920
all that
 

6129
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:15,990
all that
which again goes back to the i'm the

6130
01:50:15,990 --> 01:50:16,000
which again goes back to the i'm the
 

6131
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:17,140
which again goes back to the i'm the
lucky one kind of thing

6132
01:50:17,140 --> 01:50:17,150
lucky one kind of thing

6137
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:26,470
of living in the present and being happy
winning and being happy losing and um

6138
01:50:26,470 --> 01:50:26,480
winning and being happy losing and um
 

6139
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:27,830
winning and being happy losing and um
there's a certain freedom that comes

6140
01:50:27,830 --> 01:50:27,840
there's a certain freedom that comes
 

6141
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:30,149
there's a certain freedom that comes
with that but again a certain

6142
01:50:30,149 --> 01:50:30,159
with that but again a certain
 

6143
01:50:30,159 --> 01:50:31,910
with that but again a certain
um sort of

6144
01:50:31,910 --> 01:50:31,920
um sort of
 

6145
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:33,830
um sort of
i don't know ephemerity

6146
01:50:33,830 --> 01:50:33,840
i don't know ephemerity
 

6147
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:34,709
i don't know ephemerity
of

6148
01:50:34,709 --> 01:50:34,719
of
 

6149
01:50:34,719 --> 01:50:36,870

6150
01:50:36,870 --> 01:50:36,880
living for the present
 

6151
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:39,270
living for the present
but if you if you step back from all of

cognitive state
 

6233
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:06,550
cognitive state
that they're eventually going to snap

i i've been to conferences where

6414
01:55:00,390 --> 01:55:00,400
i i've been to conferences where
 

6415
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:02,229
i i've been to conferences where
basically people you know i'll ask them

6416
01:55:02,229 --> 01:55:02,239
basically people you know i'll ask them
 

6417
01:55:02,239 --> 01:55:04,310
basically people you know i'll ask them
a question and then they'll come back or

6418
01:55:04,310 --> 01:55:04,320
a question and then they'll come back or
 

6419
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:05,669
a question and then they'll come back or
like there was a company where i asked

6420
01:55:05,669 --> 01:55:05,679
like there was a company where i asked
 

6421
01:55:05,679 --> 01:55:07,669
like there was a company where i asked
somebody question they said oh in fact

6422
01:55:07,669 --> 01:55:07,679
somebody question they said oh in fact
 

6423
01:55:07,679 --> 01:55:09,430
somebody question they said oh in fact
this entire project was inspired by your

6424
01:55:09,430 --> 01:55:09,440
this entire project was inspired by your
 

6425
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:10,870
this entire project was inspired by your
question three years ago at the same

6426
01:55:10,870 --> 01:55:10,880
question three years ago at the same
 

6427
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:13,430
question three years ago at the same
conference yes i'm like wow

6428

conference yes i'm like wow
 

6429
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:14,790
conference yes i'm like wow
and then on top of that there's also the

6430
01:55:14,790 --> 01:55:14,800
and then on top of that there's also the
 

6431
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:16,390
and then on top of that there's also the
ripple effects of the years speaking to

6432
01:55:16,390 --> 01:55:16,400
ripple effects of the years speaking to
 

6433
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:18,550
ripple effects of the years speaking to
the direct influence of inspiration or

6434
01:55:18,550 --> 01:55:18,560
the direct influence of inspiration or
 

6435
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:20,709
the direct influence of inspiration or
education but there's also like

6436
01:55:20,709 --> 01:55:20,719
education but there's also like
 

6437
01:55:20,719 --> 01:55:22,629
education but there's also like
the follow-on things that happened to

6438
01:55:22,629 --> 01:55:22,639
the follow-on things that happened to
 

6439
01:55:22,639 --> 01:55:24,149
the follow-on things that happened to
that and there's this ripple that

6440
01:55:24,149 --> 01:55:24,159
that and there's this ripple that
 

6441
01:55:24,159 --> 01:55:25,990
that and there's this ripple that
through from you just this one

6442
01:55:25,990 --> 01:55:26,000
through from you just this one
 

6443
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,550
through from you just this one
individual and from every one of us from

6444
01:55:28,550 --> 01:55:28,560
individual and from every one of us from
 

6445
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:29,910
individual and from every one of us from
everyone that's what i love about

6446
01:55:29,910 --> 01:55:29,920
everyone that's what i love about
 

6447
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:32,550
everyone that's what i love about
humanity the fact that

6448
01:55:32,550 --> 01:55:32,560
humanity the fact that
 

6449
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:34,149
humanity the fact that
every one of us

6450
01:55:34,149 --> 01:55:34,159
every one of us
 

6451
01:55:34,159 --> 01:55:36,550
every one of us
shares genes

6452
01:55:36,550 --> 01:55:36,560
shares genes
 

6453
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:38,870
shares genes
and genetic variants with very recent

6454
01:55:38,870 --> 01:55:38,880
and genetic variants with very recent
 

6455
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:41,030
and genetic variants with very recent
ancestors with everyone else

6456
01:55:41,030 --> 01:55:41,040
ancestors with everyone else
 

6457
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:43,750
ancestors with everyone else
so even if i die tomorrow

6458
01:55:43,750 --> 01:55:43,760
so even if i die tomorrow
 

6459
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:45,990
so even if i die tomorrow
my genes are still shared through my

6460
01:55:45,990 --> 01:55:46,000
my genes are still shared through my
 

6461
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:47,430
my genes are still shared through my
cousins and through my uncles and

6462
01:55:47,430 --> 01:55:47,440
cousins and through my uncles and
 

6463
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:49,030
cousins and through my uncles and
through my you know

6464
01:55:49,030 --> 01:55:49,040
through my you know
 

6465
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:51,030
through my you know
immediate family and of course i'm lucky

6466
01:55:51,030 --> 01:55:51,040
immediate family and of course i'm lucky
 

6467
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:53,350
immediate family and of course i'm lucky
enough to have my own children but even

6468
01:55:53,350 --> 01:55:53,360
enough to have my own children but even
 

6469
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:54,950
enough to have my own children but even
if you don't your genes are still

6470
01:55:54,950 --> 01:55:54,960
if you don't your genes are still
 

6471
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:56,950
if you don't your genes are still
permeating through all of the layers of

6472
01:55:56,950 --> 01:55:56,960
permeating through all of the layers of
 

6473
01:55:56,960 --> 01:55:58,470
permeating through all of the layers of
your family so your genes will have the

6474
01:55:58,470 --> 01:55:58,480
your family so your genes will have the
 

6475
01:55:58,480 --> 01:56:01,830
your family so your genes will have the
legacy there yeah or every one of us

6476
01:56:01,830 --> 01:56:01,840
legacy there yeah or every one of us
 

6477
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:04,310
legacy there yeah or every one of us
yeah number two our ideas are constantly

6478
01:56:04,310 --> 01:56:04,320
yeah number two our ideas are constantly
 

6479
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:05,990
yeah number two our ideas are constantly
intermingling with each other so there's

6480
01:56:05,990 --> 01:56:06,000
intermingling with each other so there's
 

6481
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,629
intermingling with each other so there's
no person living in the planet

6482
01:56:08,629 --> 01:56:08,639
no person living in the planet
 

6483
01:56:08,639 --> 01:56:10,550
no person living in the planet
100 years from now who will not be

6484
01:56:10,550 --> 01:56:10,560
100 years from now who will not be
 

6485
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:12,790
100 years from now who will not be
directly impacted by everyone on the

videos on the web but the people who are
 

6521
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:50,870
videos on the web but the people who are
actually in my class who basically come

6522
01:56:50,870 --> 01:56:50,880
actually in my class who basically come
 

6523
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:52,790
actually in my class who basically come
to mit to learn

to mit to learn
 

6525
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:53,990
to mit to learn
from

6526
01:56:53,990 --> 01:56:54,000
from
 

6527
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,070
from
a bunch of us like the cognitive systems

6528
01:56:56,070 --> 01:56:56,080
a bunch of us like the cognitive systems
 

6529
01:56:56,080 --> 01:56:58,390
a bunch of us like the cognitive systems
that were shipped to this particular

6530
01:56:58,390 --> 01:56:58,400
that were shipped to this particular
 

6531
01:56:58,400 --> 01:57:00,470
that were shipped to this particular
location and who will then disperse back

6532
01:57:00,470 --> 01:57:00,480
location and who will then disperse back
 

6533
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:02,310
location and who will then disperse back
into all of their home countries yeah

6534
01:57:02,310 --> 01:57:02,320
into all of their home countries yeah
 

6535
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:03,750
into all of their home countries yeah
that's that's what makes america the

6536
01:57:03,750 --> 01:57:03,760
that's that's what makes america the
 

6537
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:05,109
that's that's what makes america the
beacon of the world

6538
01:57:05,109 --> 01:57:05,119
beacon of the world
 

6539
01:57:05,119 --> 01:57:07,589
beacon of the world
we don't just export

6540
01:57:07,589 --> 01:57:07,599
we don't just export
 

6541
01:57:07,599 --> 01:57:10,790
we don't just export
you know goods we export people

6542
01:57:10,790 --> 01:57:10,800
you know goods we export people
 

6543
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:13,510
you know goods we export people
cognitive systems we we export

6544
01:57:13,510 --> 01:57:13,520
cognitive systems we we export
 

6545
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:15,750
cognitive systems we we export
people who are born here and we also

6546
01:57:15,750 --> 01:57:15,760
people who are born here and we also
 

6547
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:17,669
people who are born here and we also
export training

6548
01:57:17,669 --> 01:57:17,679
export training
 

6549
01:57:17,679 --> 01:57:19,350
export training
that people born elsewhere will come

6550
01:57:19,350 --> 01:57:19,360
that people born elsewhere will come
 

6551
01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:21,910
that people born elsewhere will come
here to get and will then disseminate

6552
01:57:21,910 --> 01:57:21,920
here to get and will then disseminate
 

6553
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:23,990
here to get and will then disseminate
not just whatever knowledge they got but

6554
01:57:23,990 --> 01:57:24,000
not just whatever knowledge they got but
 

6555
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,990
not just whatever knowledge they got but
whatever ideals they learned

6556
01:57:25,990 --> 01:57:26,000
whatever ideals they learned
 

6557
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,270
whatever ideals they learned
and i think that's something that's a

6558
01:57:27,270 --> 01:57:27,280
and i think that's something that's a
 

6559
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:29,990
and i think that's something that's a
legacy of the us that you cannot stop

6560
01:57:29,990 --> 01:57:30,000
legacy of the us that you cannot stop
 

6561
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:31,910
legacy of the us that you cannot stop
with political isolation you cannot stop

6562
01:57:31,910 --> 01:57:31,920
with political isolation you cannot stop
 

6563
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:33,750
with political isolation you cannot stop
with economic isolation that's something

6564
01:57:33,750 --> 01:57:33,760
with economic isolation that's something
 

6565
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:35,990
with economic isolation that's something
that will continue to happen through all

6566
01:57:35,990 --> 01:57:36,000
that will continue to happen through all
 

6567
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:37,189
that will continue to happen through all
the people we've touched through our

6568
01:57:37,189 --> 01:57:37,199
the people we've touched through our
 

6569
01:57:37,199 --> 01:57:39,510
the people we've touched through our
universities so there's the students who

6570
01:57:39,510 --> 01:57:39,520
universities so there's the students who
 

6571
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:41,910
universities so there's the students who
took my classes who are basically now

6572
01:57:41,910 --> 01:57:41,920
took my classes who are basically now
 

6573
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:44,229
took my classes who are basically now
going off and teaching their classes and

6574
01:57:44,229 --> 01:57:44,239
going off and teaching their classes and
 

6575
01:57:44,239 --> 01:57:45,430
going off and teaching their classes and
i've trained generations of

6576
01:57:45,430 --> 01:57:45,440
i've trained generations of
 

6577
01:57:45,440 --> 01:57:46,709
i've trained generations of
computational biologists no one in

6578
01:57:46,709 --> 01:57:46,719
computational biologists no one in
 

6579
01:57:46,719 --> 01:57:48,790
computational biologists no one in
genomics who's gone through mit hasn't

6580
01:57:48,790 --> 01:57:48,800
genomics who's gone through mit hasn't
 

6581
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:51,350
genomics who's gone through mit hasn't
taken my class so basically there's this

6582
01:57:51,350 --> 01:57:51,360
taken my class so basically there's this
 

6583
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:52,950
taken my class so basically there's this
impact through

6584
01:57:52,950 --> 01:57:52,960
impact through
 

6585
01:57:52,960 --> 01:57:54,629
impact through
i mean there's so many people in biotech

6586
01:57:54,629 --> 01:57:54,639
i mean there's so many people in biotech
 

6587
01:57:54,639 --> 01:57:56,149
i mean there's so many people in biotech
who are like hey i took your class

6588
01:57:56,149 --> 01:57:56,159
who are like hey i took your class
 

6589
01:57:56,159 --> 01:57:57,589
who are like hey i took your class
that's what got me into the field like

6590
01:57:57,589 --> 01:57:57,599
that's what got me into the field like
 

6591
01:57:57,599 --> 01:58:00,070
that's what got me into the field like
15 years ago it's just so beautiful yes

6592
01:58:00,070 --> 01:58:00,080
15 years ago it's just so beautiful yes
 

6593
01:58:00,080 --> 01:58:02,709
15 years ago it's just so beautiful yes
and then there's the

6594
01:58:02,709 --> 01:58:02,719
and then there's the
 

6595
01:58:02,719 --> 01:58:05,350
and then there's the
academic family that i have so the

6596
01:58:05,350 --> 01:58:05,360
academic family that i have so the
 

6597
01:58:05,360 --> 01:58:07,350
academic family that i have so the
students who are actually studying with

6598
01:58:07,350 --> 01:58:07,360
students who are actually studying with
 

6599
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:10,550
students who are actually studying with
me who are my trainees so this sort of

6600
01:58:10,550 --> 01:58:10,560
me who are my trainees so this sort of
 

6601
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:14,950
me who are my trainees so this sort of
mentorship of ancient greece these

6602
01:58:14,950 --> 01:58:14,960

 

6603
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:17,669

you're part of the kelly's family so i
 

6613
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:30,229
you're part of the kelly's family so i
have a biological family at home and i

6614
01:58:30,229 --> 01:58:30,239
have a biological family at home and i
 

6615
01:58:30,239 --> 01:58:32,390
have a biological family at home and i
have an academic family on campus and

6616
01:58:32,390 --> 01:58:32,400
have an academic family on campus and
 

6617
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:35,189

and so the two the two points that we
found was this whole transcriptional

6800

found was this whole transcriptional
 

6801

6805
02:01:46,639 --> 02:01:48,550
who are schizophrenic
but whose

6806
02:01:48,550 --> 02:01:48,560
but whose
 

6807
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:50,070
but whose
they have an additional cell type or

6808
02:01:50,070 --> 02:01:50,080
they have an additional cell type or
 

6809
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:52,149
they have an additional cell type or
initial cell state which we believe is

6810
02:01:52,149 --> 02:01:52,159
initial cell state which we believe is
 

6811
02:01:52,159 --> 02:01:53,510
initial cell state which we believe is
protective

6812
02:01:53,510 --> 02:01:53,520
protective
 

6813
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:55,589
protective
and that cell state when they have it

6814
02:01:55,589 --> 02:01:55,599
and that cell state when they have it
 

6815
02:01:55,599 --> 02:01:57,350
and that cell state when they have it
will cause other cells to have normal

6816
02:01:57,350 --> 02:01:57,360
will cause other cells to have normal
 

6817
02:01:57,360 --> 02:01:59,750
will cause other cells to have normal
gene expression patterns it's beautiful

6818
02:01:59,750 --> 02:01:59,760
gene expression patterns it's beautiful
 

6819
02:01:59,760 --> 02:02:03,350
gene expression patterns it's beautiful
yeah and then that's that cell is

6820
02:02:03,350 --> 02:02:03,360
yeah and then that's that cell is
 

6821
02:02:03,360 --> 02:02:05,350
yeah and then that's that cell is
connected with some of the pv

6822
02:02:05,350 --> 02:02:05,360
connected with some of the pv
 

6823
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:07,030
connected with some of the pv
interneurons that are basically sending

6824
02:02:07,030 --> 02:02:07,040
interneurons that are basically sending
 

6825
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:09,750
interneurons that are basically sending
these inhibitory brain waves through the

6826
02:02:09,750 --> 02:02:09,760
these inhibitory brain waves through the
 

6827
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:10,790
these inhibitory brain waves through the
brain

6828
02:02:10,790 --> 02:02:10,800
brain
 

6829
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:13,109
brain
and there basically there's a there's

6830
02:02:13,109 --> 02:02:13,119
and there basically there's a there's
 

6831
02:02:13,119 --> 02:02:14,950
and there basically there's a there's
another component of

6832
02:02:14,950 --> 02:02:14,960
another component of
 

6833
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:17,109
another component of
there's a set of master regulators that

6834
02:02:17,109 --> 02:02:17,119
there's a set of master regulators that
 

6835
02:02:17,119 --> 02:02:18,390
there's a set of master regulators that
we discovered

6836
02:02:18,390 --> 02:02:18,400
we discovered
 

6837
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:20,629
we discovered
who are controlling many of the genes

6838
02:02:20,629 --> 02:02:20,639
who are controlling many of the genes
 

6839
02:02:20,639 --> 02:02:22,629
who are controlling many of the genes
that are differentially expressed and

6840
02:02:22,629 --> 02:02:22,639
that are differentially expressed and
 

6841
02:02:22,639 --> 02:02:24,390
that are differentially expressed and
these master regulators are themselves

6842
02:02:24,390 --> 02:02:24,400
these master regulators are themselves
 

6843
02:02:24,400 --> 02:02:27,030
these master regulators are themselves
genetic targets of schizophrenia

6844
02:02:27,030 --> 02:02:27,040
genetic targets of schizophrenia
 

6845
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:29,270
genetic targets of schizophrenia
and they are themselves involved in both

6846
02:02:29,270 --> 02:02:29,280
and they are themselves involved in both
 

6847
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:31,750
and they are themselves involved in both
synaptic connectivity

6848
02:02:31,750 --> 02:02:31,760
synaptic connectivity
 

6849
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:34,629
synaptic connectivity
and also in early brain development

6850
02:02:34,629 --> 02:02:34,639
and also in early brain development
 

6851
02:02:34,639 --> 02:02:35,910
and also in early brain development
so there's this sort of

6852
02:02:35,910 --> 02:02:35,920
so there's this sort of
 

6853
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:38,709
so there's this sort of
interconnectedness between synaptic

6854
02:02:38,709 --> 02:02:38,719
interconnectedness between synaptic
 

6855
02:02:38,719 --> 02:02:40,629
interconnectedness between synaptic
development axes and also this

6856
02:02:40,629 --> 02:02:40,639
development axes and also this
 

6857
02:02:40,639 --> 02:02:42,149
development axes and also this
transcription resilience so i mean we

6858
02:02:42,149 --> 02:02:42,159
transcription resilience so i mean we
 

6859
02:02:42,159 --> 02:02:43,510
transcription resilience so i mean we
basically made up a title that combines

6860
02:02:43,510 --> 02:02:43,520
basically made up a title that combines
 

6861
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:44,709
basically made up a title that combines
all these concepts

6862
02:02:44,709 --> 02:02:44,719
all these concepts
 

6863
02:02:44,719 --> 02:02:45,990
all these concepts
you have all these concepts all these

6864
02:02:45,990 --> 02:02:46,000
you have all these concepts all these
 

6865
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:47,669
you have all these concepts all these
people working together and ultimately

6866
02:02:47,669 --> 02:02:47,679
people working together and ultimately
 

6867
02:02:47,679 --> 02:02:49,830
people working together and ultimately
these minds condense it down into a

6868
02:02:49,830 --> 02:02:49,840
these minds condense it down into a
 

6869
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:51,990
these minds condense it down into a
beautifully exactly little document that

6870
02:02:51,990 --> 02:02:52,000
beautifully exactly little document that
 

6871
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,910
beautifully exactly little document that
lives on and that document now has its

6872
02:02:53,910 --> 02:02:53,920
lives on and that document now has its
 

6873
02:02:53,920 --> 02:02:56,950
lives on and that document now has its
own life yeah our work has a hundred and

6874
02:02:56,950 --> 02:02:56,960
own life yeah our work has a hundred and
 

6875
02:02:56,960 --> 02:02:58,830
own life yeah our work has a hundred and
a hundred and twenty thousand

6876
02:02:58,830 --> 02:02:58,840
a hundred and twenty thousand
 

6877
02:02:58,840 --> 02:03:01,189
a hundred and twenty thousand
citations i mean that's not just people

6878
02:03:01,189 --> 02:03:01,199
citations i mean that's not just people
 

6879
02:03:01,199 --> 02:03:03,669
citations i mean that's not just people
who read it these are people who used it

6880
02:03:03,669 --> 02:03:03,679
who read it these are people who used it
 

6881
02:03:03,679 --> 02:03:05,750
who read it these are people who used it
to write something based on it yeah i

6882
02:03:05,750 --> 02:03:05,760
to write something based on it yeah i
 

6883
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:08,149
to write something based on it yeah i
mean that to me is

6884
02:03:08,149 --> 02:03:08,159
mean that to me is
 

6885
02:03:08,159 --> 02:03:11,109
mean that to me is
is just so fulfilling to basically say

6886
02:03:11,109 --> 02:03:11,119
is just so fulfilling to basically say
 

6887
02:03:11,119 --> 02:03:12,950
is just so fulfilling to basically say
wow i've touched people

6888
02:03:12,950 --> 02:03:12,960
wow i've touched people
 

6889
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:14,870
wow i've touched people
so

6890
02:03:14,870 --> 02:03:14,880
so
 

6891
02:03:14,880 --> 02:03:17,270
so
i i don't think of my legacy as i live

6892
02:03:17,270 --> 02:03:17,280
i i don't think of my legacy as i live
 

6893
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:18,950
i i don't think of my legacy as i live
every day i just think of the beauty of

6894
02:03:18,950 --> 02:03:18,960
every day i just think of the beauty of
 

6895
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:20,229
every day i just think of the beauty of
the present

6896
02:03:20,229 --> 02:03:20,239
the present
 

6897
02:03:20,239 --> 02:03:22,550
the present
and the power of interconnectedness and

6898
02:03:22,550 --> 02:03:22,560
and the power of interconnectedness and
 

6899
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:24,950
and the power of interconnectedness and
just i feel like a kid in a candy shop

6900
02:03:24,950 --> 02:03:24,960
just i feel like a kid in a candy shop
 

6901
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:28,070
just i feel like a kid in a candy shop
where i'm just like constantly you know

6902
02:03:28,070 --> 02:03:28,080
where i'm just like constantly you know
 

6903
02:03:28,080 --> 02:03:30,229
where i'm just like constantly you know
where do i what what package do i open

6904
02:03:30,229 --> 02:03:30,239
where do i what what package do i open
 

6905
02:03:30,239 --> 02:03:31,750
where do i what what package do i open
first

6906
02:03:31,750 --> 02:03:31,760
first
 

6907
02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:35,189
first
and um you know the lucky one

6908
02:03:35,189 --> 02:03:35,199
and um you know the lucky one
 

6909
02:03:35,199 --> 02:03:37,830
and um you know the lucky one
a jack of all trades a master of none

6910
02:03:37,830 --> 02:03:37,840
a jack of all trades a master of none
 

6911
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:41,189
a jack of all trades a master of none
i think uh for a meaning of life episode

6912
02:03:41,189 --> 02:03:41,199
i think uh for a meaning of life episode
 

6913
02:03:41,199 --> 02:03:43,189
i think uh for a meaning of life episode
we would be amiss if we did not have at

6914
02:03:43,189 --> 02:03:43,199
we would be amiss if we did not have at
 

6915
02:03:43,199 --> 02:03:46,790
we would be amiss if we did not have at
least a poem or two do you mind if we

6916
02:03:46,790 --> 02:03:46,800
least a poem or two do you mind if we
 

6917
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:49,270
least a poem or two do you mind if we
uh end in a couple of poems

6918
02:03:49,270 --> 02:03:49,280
uh end in a couple of poems
 

6919
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:51,270
uh end in a couple of poems
maybe a happy maybe a sad one i would

6920
02:03:51,270 --> 02:03:51,280
maybe a happy maybe a sad one i would
 

6921
02:03:51,280 --> 02:03:53,270
maybe a happy maybe a sad one i would
love i would love that so thank you for

6922
02:03:53,270 --> 02:03:53,280
love i would love that so thank you for
 

6923
02:03:53,280 --> 02:03:55,270
love i would love that so thank you for
the luxury

6924
02:03:55,270 --> 02:03:55,280
the luxury
 

6925
02:03:55,280 --> 02:03:59,189
the luxury
the first one is kind of um

6926
02:03:59,189 --> 02:03:59,199
the first one is kind of um
 

6927
02:03:59,199 --> 02:04:01,350
the first one is kind of um
i remember uh

6928
02:04:01,350 --> 02:04:01,360
i remember uh
 

6929
02:04:01,360 --> 02:04:02,629
i remember uh
when you were talking with eric

6930
02:04:02,629 --> 02:04:02,639
when you were talking with eric
 

6931
02:04:02,639 --> 02:04:05,669
when you were talking with eric
weinstein about um

6932
02:04:05,669 --> 02:04:05,679
weinstein about um
 

6933
02:04:05,679 --> 02:04:09,030
weinstein about um
this comment of leonard cohen yes that

6934
02:04:09,030 --> 02:04:09,040
this comment of leonard cohen yes that
 

6935
02:04:09,040 --> 02:04:10,709
this comment of leonard cohen yes that
says but you don't really care for music

6936
02:04:10,709 --> 02:04:10,719
says but you don't really care for music
 

6937
02:04:10,719 --> 02:04:12,870
says but you don't really care for music
do ya yeah in hallelujah that's

6938
02:04:12,870 --> 02:04:12,880
do ya yeah in hallelujah that's
 

6939
02:04:12,880 --> 02:04:15,030
do ya yeah in hallelujah that's
basically kind of like mocking its

6940
02:04:15,030 --> 02:04:15,040
basically kind of like mocking its
 

6941
02:04:15,040 --> 02:04:17,109
basically kind of like mocking its
reader yeah so one of my poems is a

6942
02:04:17,109 --> 02:04:17,119
reader yeah so one of my poems is a
 

6943
02:04:17,119 --> 02:04:18,550
reader yeah so one of my poems is a
little like that

6944
02:04:18,550 --> 02:04:18,560
little like that
 

6945
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:19,830
little like that
so

6946
02:04:19,830 --> 02:04:19,840
so
 

6947
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:22,310
so
i had just broken up with

6948
02:04:22,310 --> 02:04:22,320
i had just broken up with
 

6949
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:24,950
i had just broken up with
you know my girlfriend and there's this

6950
02:04:24,950 --> 02:04:24,960
you know my girlfriend and there's this
 

6951
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:26,870
you know my girlfriend and there's this
other friend who was coming to visit me

6952
02:04:26,870 --> 02:04:26,880
other friend who was coming to visit me
 

6953
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:28,310
other friend who was coming to visit me
and she said

6954
02:04:28,310 --> 02:04:28,320
and she said
 

6955
02:04:28,320 --> 02:04:29,589
and she said
i will not come unless you write me a

6956
02:04:29,589 --> 02:04:29,599
i will not come unless you write me a
 

6957
02:04:29,599 --> 02:04:29,970
i will not come unless you write me a
poem

6958
02:04:29,970 --> 02:04:29,980
poem
 

6959
02:04:29,980 --> 02:04:32,950
poem
[Laughter]

6960
02:04:32,950 --> 02:04:32,960
[Laughter]
 

6961
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:34,229
[Laughter]
and uh

6962
02:04:34,229 --> 02:04:34,239
and uh
 

6963
02:04:34,239 --> 02:04:35,510
and uh
i was like

6964
02:04:35,510 --> 02:04:35,520
i was like
 

6965
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:37,350
i was like
writing a form on demand

6966
02:04:37,350 --> 02:04:37,360
writing a form on demand
 

6967
02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:39,910
