this property we call life which is the
phase we're undergoing now it solves the

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:13,120
phase we're undergoing now it solves the
 

13
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,230
phase we're undergoing now it solves the
origin of itself and then it figures out

14
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:16,240
origin of itself and then it figures out
 

15
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,470
origin of itself and then it figures out
how that process all works understands

16

how that process all works understands
 

17
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,150
how that process all works understands
how to make more life and then can copy

18
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:20,160
how to make more life and then can copy

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,750
how to make more life and then can copy
itself onto another planet so the whole

Walker you open the book life as no one

52
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:10,159
Walker you open the book life as no one
 

53
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,350
Walker you open the book life as no one
knows it the physics of life's emergence

54
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:12,360
knows it the physics of life's emergence
 

55
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,510
knows it the physics of life's emergence
with a distinction between the

56
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:14,520
with a distinction between the
 

57
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,910
with a distinction between the
materialists and the vitalists so what's

58
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:16,920
materialists and the vitalists so what's
 

59
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,789
materialists and the vitalists so what's
the difference can you maybe Define the

60
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:18,799
the difference can you maybe Define the
 

61
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,109
the difference can you maybe Define the
two I think the question there is about

62
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:23,119
two I think the question there is about
 

63
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,550
two I think the question there is about
whether life can be

64
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:25,560
whether life can be
 

65
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,469
whether life can be
described in terms of matter and you

66
00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:29,479
described in terms of matter and you
 

67
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:31,590
described in terms of matter and you
know physical physical things or whether

68
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:31,600
know physical physical things or whether
 

69
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,710
know physical physical things or whether
there is

70
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:33,720
there is
 

71
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,149
there is
some other feature that's not physical

72
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:37,159
some other feature that's not physical
 

73
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:40,789
some other feature that's not physical
that actually animates living things so

74
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:40,799
that actually animates living things so
 

75
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,350
that actually animates living things so
for a long time people maybe have called

76
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:42,360
for a long time people maybe have called
 

77
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,069
for a long time people maybe have called
that a soul it's been really hard to pin

78
00:01:45,069 --> 00:01:45,079
that a soul it's been really hard to pin
 

79
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,350
that a soul it's been really hard to pin
down what that is so I think the

80
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:46,360
down what that is so I think the
 

81
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,749
down what that is so I think the
vitalist idea is really that it's it's

82
00:01:48,749 --> 00:01:48,759
vitalist idea is really that it's it's
 

83
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:51,429
vitalist idea is really that it's it's
kind of a dualistic interpretation that

84
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:51,439
kind of a dualistic interpretation that
 

85
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,389
kind of a dualistic interpretation that
there's sort of the material properties

86
00:01:53,389 --> 00:01:53,399
there's sort of the material properties
 

87
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:55,069
there's sort of the material properties
but there's something else that animates

88
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:55,079
but there's something else that animates
 

89
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,709
but there's something else that animates
life that is there when you're alive and

90
00:01:57,709 --> 00:01:57,719
life that is there when you're alive and
 

91
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,190
life that is there when you're alive and
it's not there when you're dead and

92
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:00,200
it's not there when you're dead and
 

93
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,830
it's not there when you're dead and
materialists kind of don't think that

94
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:01,840
materialists kind of don't think that
 

95
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,029
materialists kind of don't think that
there's anything really special about

96
00:02:03,029 --> 00:02:03,039
there's anything really special about
 

97
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,709
there's anything really special about
the matter of life and the material

98
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:04,719
the matter of life and the material
 

99
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,230
the matter of life and the material
substrates that life is made out of so

100
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:07,240
substrates that life is made out of so
 

101
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,270
substrates that life is made out of so
they disagree in some really fundamental

102
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,280
they disagree in some really fundamental
 

103
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,910
they disagree in some really fundamental
points is there a gray area between the

104
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:11,920
points is there a gray area between the
 

105
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,350
points is there a gray area between the
two like maybe all there is is matter

106
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,360
two like maybe all there is is matter
 

107
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,710
two like maybe all there is is matter
but there's so much we don't know that

108
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:17,720
but there's so much we don't know that
 

109
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,670
but there's so much we don't know that
there might as well be magic that that

110
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:20,680
there might as well be magic that that
 

111
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,309
there might as well be magic that that
like whatever that magic that the

112
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:22,319
like whatever that magic that the
 

113
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,030
like whatever that magic that the
vitalists see meaning like there's just

114
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:26,040
vitalists see meaning like there's just
 

115
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,150
vitalists see meaning like there's just
so much mystery that it's really unfair

116
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,160
so much mystery that it's really unfair
 

117
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,710
so much mystery that it's really unfair
to say that it's boring and understood

118
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:32,720
to say that it's boring and understood
 

119
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,070
to say that it's boring and understood
and as simple as quote unquote physics

120
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,080
and as simple as quote unquote physics
 

121
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,470
and as simple as quote unquote physics
yeah I think the entire universe is just

122
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:38,480
yeah I think the entire universe is just
 

123
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,390
yeah I think the entire universe is just
a giant mystery um I guess that's what

124
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:40,400
a giant mystery um I guess that's what
 

125
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,949
a giant mystery um I guess that's what
motivates me as a scientist and so often

126
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:42,959
motivates me as a scientist and so often
 

127
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,550
motivates me as a scientist and so often
times when I look at open problems like

128
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:44,560
times when I look at open problems like
 

129
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,470
times when I look at open problems like
the nature of life or Consciousness or

130
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:47,480
the nature of life or Consciousness or
 

131
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,190
the nature of life or Consciousness or
you know what is intelligence or are

132
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:50,200
you know what is intelligence or are
 

133
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,309
you know what is intelligence or are
there souls or whatever whatever

134
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:52,319
there souls or whatever whatever
 

135
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,110
there souls or whatever whatever
question that we have that we feel like

136
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:54,120
question that we have that we feel like
 

137
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,470
question that we have that we feel like
we aren't even on the tip of answering

138
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,480
we aren't even on the tip of answering
 

139
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,390
we aren't even on the tip of answering
yet I think you know we have a lot more

140
00:02:59,390 --> 00:02:59,400
yet I think you know we have a lot more
 

141
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,710
yet I think you know we have a lot more
work to do to really understand the

142
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:01,720
work to do to really understand the
 

143
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,550
work to do to really understand the
answers to these questions so it's not

144
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:03,560
answers to these questions so it's not
 

145
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,149
answers to these questions so it's not
magic it's just the unknown and I think

146
00:03:06,149 --> 00:03:06,159
magic it's just the unknown and I think
 

147
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,670
magic it's just the unknown and I think
a lot of the history of humans coming to

148
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:08,680
a lot of the history of humans coming to
 

149
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,470
a lot of the history of humans coming to
understand the world around us has been

150
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:10,480
understand the world around us has been
 

151
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,509
understand the world around us has been
taking ideas that we once thought were

152
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:13,519
taking ideas that we once thought were
 

153
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,030
taking ideas that we once thought were
magic or Supernatural and really

154
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:16,040
magic or Supernatural and really
 

155
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,670
magic or Supernatural and really
understanding them in a much deeper way

156
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:18,680
understanding them in a much deeper way
 

157
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,710
understanding them in a much deeper way
um that we learn what those things are

158
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:22,720
um that we learn what those things are
 

159
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,509
um that we learn what those things are
and they still have an air of mystery

160
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:24,519
and they still have an air of mystery
 

161
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:26,390
and they still have an air of mystery
even when we understand them there's

162
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:26,400
even when we understand them there's
 

163
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,030
even when we understand them there's
there's no there's no sort of bottom to

164
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,040
there's no there's no sort of bottom to
 

165
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,429
there's no there's no sort of bottom to
our understanding

166
00:03:30,429 --> 00:03:30,439
our understanding
 

167
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:31,869
our understanding
so do you think the vitalists have a

168
00:03:31,869 --> 00:03:31,879
so do you think the vitalists have a
 

169
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:35,350
so do you think the vitalists have a
point that they're uh more eager and

170
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:35,360
point that they're uh more eager and
 

171
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,750
point that they're uh more eager and
able to notice the magic of life I think

172
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:39,760
able to notice the magic of life I think
 

173
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,710
able to notice the magic of life I think
that no tradition vitalists included is

174
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:42,720
that no tradition vitalists included is
 

175
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,910
that no tradition vitalists included is
ever fully wrong about the nature of the

176
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:44,920
ever fully wrong about the nature of the
 

177
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,429
ever fully wrong about the nature of the
things that they're describing so a lot

178
00:03:47,429 --> 00:03:47,439
things that they're describing so a lot
 

179
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:50,110
things that they're describing so a lot
of times when I look at different ways

180
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:50,120
of times when I look at different ways
 

181
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,869
of times when I look at different ways
that people have described things across

182
00:03:51,869 --> 00:03:51,879
that people have described things across
 

183
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:54,110
that people have described things across
human history across different cultures

184
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:54,120
human history across different cultures
 

185
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,830
human history across different cultures
there's always a seed of Truth in them

186
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:55,840
there's always a seed of Truth in them
 

187
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,309
there's always a seed of Truth in them
and I think it's really important to try

188
00:03:57,309 --> 00:03:57,319
and I think it's really important to try
 

189
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,789
and I think it's really important to try
to look for those because if there are

190
00:03:58,789 --> 00:03:58,799
to look for those because if there are
 

191
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,550
to look for those because if there are
narratives that humans have been telling

192
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,560
narratives that humans have been telling
 

193
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,110
narratives that humans have been telling
ourselves uh for thousands of years for

194
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,120
ourselves uh for thousands of years for
 

195
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,030
ourselves uh for thousands of years for
thousands of generations there must be

196
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,040
thousands of generations there must be
 

197
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,670
thousands of generations there must be
some truth to them you know we've been

198
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:06,680
some truth to them you know we've been
 

199
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,429
some truth to them you know we've been
learning about

200
00:04:08,429 --> 00:04:08,439
learning about
 

201
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:11,910
learning about
reality um for a really long time um and

202
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:11,920
reality um for a really long time um and
 

203
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,990
reality um for a really long time um and
we recognize the patterns that reality

204
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
we recognize the patterns that reality
 

205
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,750
we recognize the patterns that reality
presents us we don't always understand

206
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:15,760
presents us we don't always understand
 

207
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,789
presents us we don't always understand
what those patterns are and so I think

208
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:17,799
what those patterns are and so I think
 

209
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:18,949
what those patterns are and so I think
it's really important to pay attention

210
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:18,959
it's really important to pay attention
 

211
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,189
it's really important to pay attention
to that so I don't think the vitalists

212
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:20,199
to that so I don't think the vitalists
 

213
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:22,830
to that so I don't think the vitalists
were actually wrong and a lot of what I

214
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:22,840
were actually wrong and a lot of what I
 

215
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,150
were actually wrong and a lot of what I
talk about in the book but also I think

216
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:25,160
talk about in the book but also I think
 

217
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,469
talk about in the book but also I think
about a lot just professionally is the

218
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:28,479
about a lot just professionally is the
 

219
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,230
about a lot just professionally is the
nature of our definitions of what's

220
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,240
nature of our definitions of what's
 

221
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,590
nature of our definitions of what's
material and how science has come to

222
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:32,600
material and how science has come to
 

223
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,510
material and how science has come to
invent the concept of matter and that

224
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:35,520
invent the concept of matter and that
 

225
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,310
invent the concept of matter and that
some of those things actually really are

226
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,320
some of those things actually really are
 

227
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,270
some of those things actually really are
inventions that happened in a particular

228
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:40,280
inventions that happened in a particular
 

229
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,629
inventions that happened in a particular
time in a particular technology that

230
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:42,639
time in a particular technology that
 

231
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,990
time in a particular technology that
could learn about certain patterns and

232
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:45,000
could learn about certain patterns and
 

233
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,749
could learn about certain patterns and
help us understand them and that there

234
00:04:46,749 --> 00:04:46,759
help us understand them and that there
 

235
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:48,469
help us understand them and that there
are some patterns we still don't

236
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:48,479
are some patterns we still don't
 

237
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,070
are some patterns we still don't
understand and if we knew how

238
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:51,080
understand and if we knew how
 

239
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,909
understand and if we knew how
to uh measure those things or we knew

240
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:53,919
to uh measure those things or we knew
 

241
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,150
to uh measure those things or we knew
how to describe them uh in a more

242
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:57,160
how to describe them uh in a more
 

243
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,189
how to describe them uh in a more
rigorous way we would realize that the

244
00:04:59,189 --> 00:04:59,199
rigorous way we would realize that the
 

245
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,070
rigorous way we would realize that the
material World matter has more

246
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,080
material World matter has more
 

247
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,029
material World matter has more
properties than we thought that it did

248
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:04,039
properties than we thought that it did
 

249
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:05,550
properties than we thought that it did
and one of those might be associated

250
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:05,560
and one of those might be associated
 

251
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,830
and one of those might be associated
with the thing that we call life life

252
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:06,840
with the thing that we call life life
 

253
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,629
with the thing that we call life life
could be a material property and still

254
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:09,639
could be a material property and still
 

255
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:10,950
could be a material property and still
have a lot of the features that the

256
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:10,960
have a lot of the features that the
 

257
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,270
have a lot of the features that the
vitalist thought were mysterious so we

258
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,280
vitalist thought were mysterious so we
 

259
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,350
vitalist thought were mysterious so we
may still expand our understanding what

260
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:16,360
may still expand our understanding what
 

261
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,430
may still expand our understanding what
is Incorporated in the category of

262
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:18,440
is Incorporated in the category of
 

263
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,749
is Incorporated in the category of
matter that will eventually incorporate

264
00:05:20,749 --> 00:05:20,759
matter that will eventually incorporate
 

265
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,150
matter that will eventually incorporate
such magical things that the vitalists

266
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:23,160
such magical things that the vitalists
 

267
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,510
such magical things that the vitalists
have noticed like life yeah so I think

268
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:26,520
have noticed like life yeah so I think
 

269
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,510
have noticed like life yeah so I think
about um I always like to use examples

270
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:28,520
about um I always like to use examples
 

271
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,189
about um I always like to use examples
from physics so I'll

272
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:30,199
from physics so I'll
 

273
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:32,710
from physics so I'll
do that to like like it's just my it's

274
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:32,720
do that to like like it's just my it's
 

275
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,710
do that to like like it's just my it's
my go-to place um but you know in in the

276
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:36,720
my go-to place um but you know in in the
 

277
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,990
my go-to place um but you know in in the
history of gravitational physics for

278
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:39,000
history of gravitational physics for
 

279
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,629
history of gravitational physics for
example in the history of motion you

280
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:40,639
example in the history of motion you
 

281
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,309
example in the history of motion you
know like when Aristotle came up with

282
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:42,319
know like when Aristotle came up with
 

283
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,870
know like when Aristotle came up with
his theories of motion he did it by the

284
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:43,880
his theories of motion he did it by the
 

285
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,430
his theories of motion he did it by the
material properties he thought things

286
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,440
material properties he thought things
 

287
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,870
material properties he thought things
had so there was a concept of things

288
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:47,880
had so there was a concept of things
 

289
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,510
had so there was a concept of things
falling to Earth because they were solid

290
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:50,520
falling to Earth because they were solid
 

291
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,070
falling to Earth because they were solid
like and things raising to the heavens

292
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,080
like and things raising to the heavens
 

293
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,670
like and things raising to the heavens
because they were air likee and things

294
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:53,680
because they were air likee and things
 

295
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,029
because they were air likee and things
moving around the planet cuz they were

296
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:55,039
moving around the planet cuz they were
 

297
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,270
moving around the planet cuz they were
Celestial like but then we came to

298
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,280
Celestial like but then we came to
 

299
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,430
Celestial like but then we came to
realize that thousands of years later

300
00:05:59,430 --> 00:05:59,440
realize that thousands of years later
 

301
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,909
realize that thousands of years later
and after the invention of many

302
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:00,919
and after the invention of many
 

303
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:03,270
and after the invention of many
technologies that allowed us to actually

304
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,280
technologies that allowed us to actually
 

305
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,150
technologies that allowed us to actually
measure um time in a mechanistic way and

306
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:07,160
measure um time in a mechanistic way and
 

307
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,550
measure um time in a mechanistic way and
track planetary motion uh and we could

308
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:10,560
track planetary motion uh and we could
 

309
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,589
track planetary motion uh and we could
you know roll balls down incline planes

310
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:12,599
you know roll balls down incline planes
 

311
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:14,749
you know roll balls down incline planes
and track that progress we realized that

312
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:14,759
and track that progress we realized that
 

313
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,350
and track that progress we realized that
if we just talked about mass and

314
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:16,360
if we just talked about mass and
 

315
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,029
if we just talked about mass and
acceleration we could unify all Motion

316
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:19,039
acceleration we could unify all Motion
 

317
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,309
acceleration we could unify all Motion
in the universe in a really simple

318
00:06:21,309 --> 00:06:21,319
in the universe in a really simple
 

319
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:23,189
in the universe in a really simple
description um so we didn't really have

320
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199
description um so we didn't really have

description um so we didn't really have
to worry about the fact that my cup is

322
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:25,160
to worry about the fact that my cup is
 

323
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,589
to worry about the fact that my cup is
heavy and the air is light like the same

324

heavy and the air is light like the same
 

325
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:30,150

laws describe them um if we have the

326
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,160
laws describe them um if we have the
 

327
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,909
laws describe them um if we have the
right material properties to talk about

328
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:31,919
right material properties to talk about
 

329
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,390
right material properties to talk about
what those laws are actually interacting

330
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,400
what those laws are actually interacting
 

331
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,950
what those laws are actually interacting
with and so I think the issue with life

332
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:36,960
with and so I think the issue with life
 

333
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,270
with and so I think the issue with life
is we don't know how to think about

334
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:38,280
is we don't know how to think about
 

335
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,230
is we don't know how to think about
information in a material way and so we

336
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:41,240
information in a material way and so we
 

337
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,350
information in a material way and so we
haven't been able to build a unified

338
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:43,360
haven't been able to build a unified

because we haven't really invented the

00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,080
because we haven't really invented the
 

345
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,629
because we haven't really invented the
right material concept yet so when

346
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:55,639
right material concept yet so when
 

347

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,950
other kinds of matter that we might
eventually include life

00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:23,150
will tell us about the nature of life in
the universe and will allow us to

so uh Carl Sean had this wonderful essay

384
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:44,960
so uh Carl Sean had this wonderful essay
 

385
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,670
so uh Carl Sean had this wonderful essay
on definitions of life where I think he

386
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:46,680
on definitions of life where I think he
 

387
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,909
on definitions of life where I think he
talks about aliens coming from another

388
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:48,919
talks about aliens coming from another
 

389
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:50,790
talks about aliens coming from another
planet if they saw Earth they might

395
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,350

00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:56,360
our planet and like humans are inside
 

397
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,189
our planet and like humans are inside
them and you might want to exclude

398
00:07:58,189 --> 00:07:58,199
them and you might want to exclude
 

399
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,589
them and you might want to exclude
machines uh but any definition you know

400
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:00,599
machines uh but any definition you know
 

401
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:02,309
machines uh but any definition you know
like classic biology textbook

402
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:02,319
like classic biology textbook
 

403
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,110
like classic biology textbook
definitions would also include them and

404
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:04,120
definitions would also include them and
 

405
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,309
definitions would also include them and
so you know he wanted to draw a boundary

406
00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:06,319
so you know he wanted to draw a boundary
 

407
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,390
so you know he wanted to draw a boundary
between uh these kind of things by

408
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,400
between uh these kind of things by
 

409
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,830
between uh these kind of things by
trying to uh exclude them but they were

410
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:11,840
trying to uh exclude them but they were
 

411
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,430
trying to uh exclude them but they were
naturally included by the definitions

412
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:13,440
naturally included by the definitions
 

413
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,869
naturally included by the definitions
people want to give and in fact what he

414
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879
people want to give and in fact what he
 

415
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,510
people want to give and in fact what he
ended up pointing out is that all of the

416
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:16,520
ended up pointing out is that all of the
 

417
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,390
ended up pointing out is that all of the
definitions of life that we have whether

418
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:19,400
definitions of life that we have whether
 

419
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,029
definitions of life that we have whether
it's life is a self-reproducing system

420
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:22,039
it's life is a self-reproducing system
 

421
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:25,950
it's life is a self-reproducing system
or life eats to survive or life requires

422
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:25,960
or life eats to survive or life requires
 

423
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,950
or life eats to survive or life requires
compartments whatever it is there's

00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:27,960
compartments whatever it is there's
 

425
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,309
compartments whatever it is there's
always a counter example that challenges

426
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:30,319
always a counter example that challenges
 

427
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,990
always a counter example that challenges
that definition this is why viruses are

428
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,000
that definition this is why viruses are
 

429
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,509
that definition this is why viruses are
so hard or why fire is so hard and so uh

430
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:35,519
so hard or why fire is so hard and so uh
 

431
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,149
so hard or why fire is so hard and so uh
we've had a really hard time trying to

432
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:37,159
we've had a really hard time trying to
 

433
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:40,389
we've had a really hard time trying to
pin down from a definitional perspective

434
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:40,399
pin down from a definitional perspective
 

435
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,430
pin down from a definitional perspective
exactly what life is yeah you actually

436
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:43,440
exactly what life is yeah you actually
 

437
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,269
exactly what life is yeah you actually
bring up the the zombie an fungus I

438
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:46,279
bring up the the zombie an fungus I
 

439
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:48,750

enjoyed looking at this thing as an

440
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:48,760
enjoyed looking at this thing as an
 

441
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,230
enjoyed looking at this thing as an
example of one of the challenges

442
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:50,240
example of one of the challenges
 

443
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,350
example of one of the challenges
mentioned viruses but this this is a

444
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:52,360
mentioned viruses but this this is a
 

445
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,750
mentioned viruses but this this is a
parasite look at that did you see this

446
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:54,760
parasite look at that did you see this
 

447
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,750
parasite look at that did you see this
in the jungle infects ants actually one

448
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:57,760
in the jungle infects ants actually one
 

449
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,150
in the jungle infects ants actually one
of the interesting things about the

450
00:08:59,150 --> 00:08:59,160
of the interesting things about the
 

451
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,350
of the interesting things about the
jungle Jungle everything is Emeral like

452
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:02,360
jungle Jungle everything is Emeral like
 

453
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,670
jungle Jungle everything is Emeral like
everything eats everything really

454
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:03,680
everything eats everything really
 

455
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,790
everything eats everything really
quickly so if you uh if an organism dies

456
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:07,800
quickly so if you uh if an organism dies
 

457
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,230
quickly so if you uh if an organism dies
uh that organism disappears isn't yeah

458
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:11,240
uh that organism disappears isn't yeah
 

459
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,829
uh that organism disappears isn't yeah
it's a machine that doesn't have

460
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839
it's a machine that doesn't have
 

461
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,190
it's a machine that doesn't have
uh I wanted to say doesn't have a memory

462
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:16,200
uh I wanted to say doesn't have a memory
 

463
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,670
uh I wanted to say doesn't have a memory
or history which is interesting given

464
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:18,680
or history which is interesting given
 

465
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,430
or history which is interesting given
your work on history in defining a

466
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:21,440
your work on history in defining a

living being the jungle forgets very

468
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:24,680
living being the jungle forgets very
 

469
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,310
living being the jungle forgets very
quickly it wants to erase the fact that

470
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:27,320
quickly it wants to erase the fact that
 

471
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,870
quickly it wants to erase the fact that
you existed very quickly yeah but it

472
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:28,880
you existed very quickly yeah but it
 

473
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,470
you existed very quickly yeah but it
can't erase said it's just restructuring

474
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:30,480
can't erase said it's just restructuring
 

475
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,030
can't erase said it's just restructuring
it and I think the other thing that is

476
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:32,040
it and I think the other thing that is
 

477
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,829
it and I think the other thing that is
really you know Vivid to me about this

478
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:33,839
really you know Vivid to me about this
 

479
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,910
really you know Vivid to me about this
example that you're giving is how much

480
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:36,920
example that you're giving is how much
 

481
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,550
example that you're giving is how much
death is necessary for life so I I worry

482
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:40,560
death is necessary for life so I I worry
 

483
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,310
death is necessary for life so I I worry
a bit about um Notions of immortality

484
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:44,320
a bit about um Notions of immortality
 

485
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,230
a bit about um Notions of immortality
and whether immortality is a good thing

486
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240
and whether immortality is a good thing
 

487
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,509
and whether immortality is a good thing
or not um so I have sort of a broad

488
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:48,519
or not um so I have sort of a broad
 

489
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:51,269
or not um so I have sort of a broad
conception that life is the only thing

490
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:51,279
conception that life is the only thing
 

491
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,550
conception that life is the only thing
the universe uh generates that actually

492
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:53,560
the universe uh generates that actually
 

493
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,550
the universe uh generates that actually
has even the potential to be immortal

494
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:55,560
has even the potential to be immortal
 

495
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,750
has even the potential to be immortal
but that's as like this sort of process

496
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:57,760
but that's as like this sort of process
 

497
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,990
but that's as like this sort of process
that you're describing where life is

498
00:09:58,990 --> 00:09:59,000
that you're describing where life is
 

499
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,550
that you're describing where life is
about memory and historical contingency

500
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:01,560
about memory and historical contingency
 

501
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,870
about memory and historical contingency
and construction of new possibilities

502
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:03,880
and construction of new possibilities
 

503
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,430
and construction of new possibilities
but when you look at any instance of

504
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:05,440
but when you look at any instance of
 

505
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,829
but when you look at any instance of
life especially one as dynamic as what

506
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:07,839
life especially one as dynamic as what
 

507
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,750
life especially one as dynamic as what
you're describing it's a constant birth

508
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:09,760
you're describing it's a constant birth
 

509
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,829
you're describing it's a constant birth
and death process but that birth and

510
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:11,839
and death process but that birth and
 

511
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,150
and death process but that birth and
death process is like the way that the

512
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,160
death process is like the way that the
 

513
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,790
death process is like the way that the
Universe can explore what possibilities

514
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:17,800
Universe can explore what possibilities
 

515
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,630
Universe can explore what possibilities
can exist and not everything not every

516
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:21,640
can exist and not everything not every
 

517
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,910
can exist and not everything not every
possible human or every possible ant or

518
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:23,920
possible human or every possible ant or
 

519
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,509
possible human or every possible ant or
every possible zombie ant or every

520
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:27,519
every possible zombie ant or every
 

521
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,949
every possible zombie ant or every
possible tree will ever live so it's uh

522
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:30,959
possible tree will ever live so it's uh
 

523
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,790
possible tree will ever live so it's uh
you know it's an incredibly Dynamic and

524
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:32,800
you know it's an incredibly Dynamic and
 

525
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,829
you know it's an incredibly Dynamic and
creative place because of all that death

526
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:34,839
creative place because of all that death
 

527
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:37,509
creative place because of all that death
so does this thing this is a parasite

528
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:37,519
so does this thing this is a parasite
 

529
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,310
so does this thing this is a parasite
that needs the ant so is this a living

530
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:40,320
that needs the ant so is this a living
 

531
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,509
that needs the ant so is this a living
thing or is this not a living thing so

532
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:42,519
thing or is this not a living thing so
 

533
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:44,949
thing or is this not a living thing so
this is yeah so it just pierces the ant

534
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:44,959
this is yeah so it just pierces the ant
 

535
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,470
this is yeah so it just pierces the ant
I mean it it right and I've seen a lot

536
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:47,480
I mean it it right and I've seen a lot
 

537
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,310
I mean it it right and I've seen a lot
of this by the way um organisms working

538
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:50,320
of this by the way um organisms working
 

539
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,430
of this by the way um organisms working
together in the jungle like ants

540
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:52,440
together in the jungle like ants
 

541
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,350
together in the jungle like ants
protecting a delicious piece of fruit so

542
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:55,360
protecting a delicious piece of fruit so
 

543
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,430
protecting a delicious piece of fruit so
they need the fruit but like if you

544
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:57,440
they need the fruit but like if you
 

545
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,750
they need the fruit but like if you
touch that fruit they're going to

546
00:10:59,750 --> 00:10:59,760
touch that fruit they're going to
 

547
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,350
touch that fruit they're going to
like the forces emerge they're fighting

548
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:02,360
like the forces emerge they're fighting
 

549
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,509
like the forces emerge they're fighting
you they're defending that fruit right

550
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:04,519
you they're defending that fruit right
 

551
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:06,910
you they're defending that fruit right
to the death it just nature seems to

552
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:06,920
to the death it just nature seems to
 

553
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,870
to the death it just nature seems to
find mutual benefits right yeah it does

554
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:10,880
find mutual benefits right yeah it does
 

555
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,949
find mutual benefits right yeah it does
um I I think the thing that's perplexing

556
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:12,959
um I I think the thing that's perplexing
 

557
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,269
um I I think the thing that's perplexing
for me about these kind of examples is

558
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:15,279
for me about these kind of examples is
 

559
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,150
for me about these kind of examples is
you know effectively the ant's dead but

560
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:17,160
you know effectively the ant's dead but
 

561
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,829
you know effectively the ant's dead but
it's staying alive now because it's

562
00:11:18,829 --> 00:11:18,839
it's staying alive now because it's
 

563
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,470
it's staying alive now because it's
piloted by this fungus and so that gets

564
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:21,480
piloted by this fungus and so that gets
 

565
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,829
piloted by this fungus and so that gets
back to this you know thing that we were

566
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:23,839
back to this you know thing that we were
 

567
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:24,910
back to this you know thing that we were
talking about a few minutes ago about

568
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:24,920
talking about a few minutes ago about
 

569
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,150
talking about a few minutes ago about
how the boundary of life is really hard

570
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,160
how the boundary of life is really hard
 

571
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,389
how the boundary of life is really hard
to Define so you know anytime that you

572
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:29,399
to Define so you know anytime that you
 

573
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,310
to Define so you know anytime that you
want to draw a boundary around something

574
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:31,320
want to draw a boundary around something
 

575
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,470
want to draw a boundary around something
and you say this feature is the thing

576
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:33,480
and you say this feature is the thing
 

577
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,350
and you say this feature is the thing
that makes us alive or this thing is

578
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:35,360
that makes us alive or this thing is
 

579
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,829
that makes us alive or this thing is
alive on its own there's not ever really

580
00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:38,839
alive on its own there's not ever really
 

581
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:40,190
alive on its own there's not ever really
a clear boundary and these kind of

582
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:40,200
a clear boundary and these kind of
 

583
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,269
a clear boundary and these kind of
examples are really good at showing that

584
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:42,279
examples are really good at showing that
 

585
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:44,310
examples are really good at showing that
because it it's like the thing that you

586
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:44,320
because it it's like the thing that you
 

587
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,389
because it it's like the thing that you
would have thought is the living

588
00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:45,399
would have thought is the living
 

589
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:48,310
would have thought is the living
organism is now dead except that it has

590
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:48,320
organism is now dead except that it has
 

591
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,110
organism is now dead except that it has
another living organism that's piloting

592
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:50,120
another living organism that's piloting
 

593
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,110
another living organism that's piloting
it so the two of them together are alive

594
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,120
it so the two of them together are alive
 

595
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,790
it so the two of them together are alive
and some sense but they're you know now

596
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:54,800
and some sense but they're you know now
 

597
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,910
and some sense but they're you know now
in this kind of weird symbiotic

598
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:56,920
in this kind of weird symbiotic
 

599
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,350
in this kind of weird symbiotic
relationship that's taking this an to

600
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:58,360
relationship that's taking this an to
 

601
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,430
relationship that's taking this an to
its death so what do you do with that in

602
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:00,440
its death so what do you do with that in
 

603
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,910
its death so what do you do with that in
terms of when you try to Define life I

604
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:02,920
terms of when you try to Define life I
 

605
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,190
terms of when you try to Define life I
think we have to get rid of the notion

606
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:04,200
think we have to get rid of the notion
 

607
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,069
think we have to get rid of the notion
of an individual as being

608
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:06,079
of an individual as being
 

609
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,670
of an individual as being
relevant and this is really difficult

610
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:09,680
relevant and this is really difficult
 

611
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,150
relevant and this is really difficult
because you know a lot of the ways that

612
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:11,160
because you know a lot of the ways that
 

613
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,150
because you know a lot of the ways that
we think about life like the fundamental

614
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:13,160
we think about life like the fundamental
 

615
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,150
we think about life like the fundamental
unit of life is the cell individuals are

616
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:16,160
unit of life is the cell individuals are
 

617
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,829
unit of life is the cell individuals are
alive um but we don't think about how

618
00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:20,839
alive um but we don't think about how
 

619
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:23,910
alive um but we don't think about how
how gray that distinction is so for

620
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:23,920
how gray that distinction is so for
 

621
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,670
how gray that distinction is so for
example um you might consider you know

622
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:27,680
example um you might consider you know
 

623
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,350
example um you might consider you know
self- reproduction to be the most most

624
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:29,360
self- reproduction to be the most most
 

625
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,790
self- reproduction to be the most most
defining feature of Life a lot of people

626
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:30,800
defining feature of Life a lot of people
 

627
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,150
defining feature of Life a lot of people
do actually like you know one of these

628
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,160
do actually like you know one of these
 

629
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,110
do actually like you know one of these
standard different definitions that a

630
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:34,120
standard different definitions that a
 

631
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,350
standard different definitions that a
lot of people may feel like to use in

632
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:35,360
lot of people may feel like to use in
 

633
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,550
lot of people may feel like to use in
astrobiology is life is a

634
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:36,560
astrobiology is life is a
 

635
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,710
astrobiology is life is a
self-sustaining chemical system capable

636
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:38,720
self-sustaining chemical system capable
 

637
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,870
self-sustaining chemical system capable
of darwinian evolution which I was once

638
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:40,880
of darwinian evolution which I was once
 

639
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,150
of darwinian evolution which I was once
quoted as agreeing with and I was really

640
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:43,160
quoted as agreeing with and I was really
 

641
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,030
quoted as agreeing with and I was really
offended um because I hate that

642
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,040
offended um because I hate that
 

643
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,269
offended um because I hate that
definition I think it's terrible um and

644
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:47,279
definition I think it's terrible um and
 

645
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,550
definition I think it's terrible um and
I think it's terrible that people use it

646
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:48,560
I think it's terrible that people use it
 

647
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,590
I think it's terrible that people use it
I think like every word in that

648
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:49,600
I think like every word in that
 

649
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,310
I think like every word in that
definition is actually wrong as a

650
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:51,320
definition is actually wrong as a
 

651
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,150
definition is actually wrong as a
descriptor of life life is a

652
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:53,160
descriptor of life life is a
 

653
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,990
descriptor of life life is a
self-sustaining chemical system capable

654
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:55,000
self-sustaining chemical system capable
 

655
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,910
self-sustaining chemical system capable
of darwinian evolution why is that that

656
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:56,920
of darwinian evolution why is that that
 

657
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,389
of darwinian evolution why is that that
seems like a pretty good yeah I know if

658
00:12:58,389 --> 00:12:58,399
seems like a pretty good yeah I know if
 

659
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,430
seems like a pretty good yeah I know if
you want to make me angry you can

660
00:12:59,430 --> 00:12:59,440
you want to make me angry you can
 

661
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,670
you want to make me angry you can
pretend I said

662
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:00,680
pretend I said
 

663
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,949
pretend I said
that and believed it so self- sustaining

664
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:04,959
that and believed it so self- sustaining
 

665
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,550
that and believed it so self- sustaining

uh chemical system darwinian Evolution
 

667
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,949

what is self- sustaining what's what

668
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:10,959
what is self- sustaining what's what
 

669
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,189
what is self- sustaining what's what
what's so frustrating I mean which

670
00:13:12,189 --> 00:13:12,199
what's so frustrating I mean which
 

671
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:13,470
what's so frustrating I mean which
aspect is frustrating to you but it's

672
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:13,480
aspect is frustrating to you but it's
 

673
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,269
aspect is frustrating to you but it's
also those are very interesting words

674
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:15,279
also those are very interesting words
 

675
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,629
also those are very interesting words
yeah they're all interesting words um

676
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:17,639
yeah they're all interesting words um
 

677
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:19,350
yeah they're all interesting words um
and you know together they sound really

678
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:19,360
and you know together they sound really
 

679
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,870
and you know together they sound really
smart and they sound like they box in

680
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:20,880
smart and they sound like they box in
 

681
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,310
smart and they sound like they box in
what life is but you can use any of this

682
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:23,320
what life is but you can use any of this
 

683
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,550
what life is but you can use any of this
any of the words individually and you

684
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:25,560
any of the words individually and you
 

685
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,230
any of the words individually and you
can come up with counter examples that

686
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:27,240
can come up with counter examples that
 

687
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,269
can come up with counter examples that
don't fulfill that property the self

688
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:29,279
don't fulfill that property the self
 

689
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,790
don't fulfill that property the self
sustaining one is really interesting

690
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:30,800
sustaining one is really interesting
 

691
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,350
sustaining one is really interesting
thinking about um humans right like

692
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:33,360
thinking about um humans right like
 

693
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,470
thinking about um humans right like
we're not self- sustaining we're

694
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:34,480
we're not self- sustaining we're
 

695
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,389
we're not self- sustaining we're
dependent on societies and so you know I

696
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:37,399
dependent on societies and so you know I
 

697
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,389
dependent on societies and so you know I
find it paradoxical that you know it

698
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:40,399
find it paradoxical that you know it
 

699
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,030
find it paradoxical that you know it
might be that societies because their

700
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:42,040
might be that societies because their
 

701
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,269
might be that societies because their
self-sustaining units are now more alive

702
00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:44,279
self-sustaining units are now more alive
 

703
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,470
self-sustaining units are now more alive
than individuals are and that could be

704
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:46,480
than individuals are and that could be
 

705
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,790
than individuals are and that could be
the case but I still think we have some

706
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:48,800
the case but I still think we have some
 

707
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,389
the case but I still think we have some
property associated with life I mean

708
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:50,399
property associated with life I mean
 

709
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,749
property associated with life I mean
that's the thing that we're trying to

710
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:51,759
that's the thing that we're trying to
 

711
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:54,870
that's the thing that we're trying to
describe so that one's quite hard and in

712
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:54,880
describe so that one's quite hard and in
 

713
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,389
describe so that one's quite hard and in
general you know no organism is really

714
00:13:57,389 --> 00:13:57,399
general you know no organism is really
 

715
00:13:57,399 --> 00:13:59,069
general you know no organism is really
self- sustaining they always require an

716
00:13:59,069 --> 00:13:59,079
self- sustaining they always require an
 

717
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:00,990
self- sustaining they always require an
environment so being self-sustaining is

718
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:01,000
environment so being self-sustaining is
 

719
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,670
environment so being self-sustaining is
coupled in some sense to the world

720
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:02,680
coupled in some sense to the world
 

721
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,829
coupled in some sense to the world
around you uh we don't live in a vacuum

722
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:06,839
around you uh we don't live in a vacuum
 

723
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,670
around you uh we don't live in a vacuum
um so so that part's already challenging

724
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:10,680
um so so that part's already challenging
 

725
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,110
um so so that part's already challenging
and then you can go to chemical system I

726
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:14,120
and then you can go to chemical system I
 

727
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,389
and then you can go to chemical system I
don't think that's good either I think

728
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:15,399
don't think that's good either I think
 

729
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:17,550
don't think that's good either I think
there's a confusion because life emerges

730
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:17,560
there's a confusion because life emerges
 

731
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,150
there's a confusion because life emerges
in chemistry that life is chemical I

732
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:21,160
in chemistry that life is chemical I
 

733
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,150
in chemistry that life is chemical I
don't think life is chemical I think

734
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:23,160
don't think life is chemical I think
 

735
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,870
don't think life is chemical I think
life emerges in chemistry because

736
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:24,880
life emerges in chemistry because
 

737
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,910
life emerges in chemistry because
chemistry is the first thing the

738
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:26,920
chemistry is the first thing the
 

739
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,509
chemistry is the first thing the
universe builds where it cannot exhaust

740
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:29,519
universe builds where it cannot exhaust
 

741
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,310
universe builds where it cannot exhaust
all the possibilities because the

742
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:31,320
all the possibilities because the
 

743
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,030
all the possibilities because the
combinatorial space of chemistry is too

744
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,040
combinatorial space of chemistry is too
 

745
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,790
combinatorial space of chemistry is too
large well but is it possible to have a

746
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:34,800
large well but is it possible to have a
 

747
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,310
large well but is it possible to have a
life that is not a chemical system yes

748
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:37,320
life that is not a chemical system yes
 

749
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,030
life that is not a chemical system yes
well there's a guy I know named Lee

750
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,040
well there's a guy I know named Lee
 

751
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,749
well there's a guy I know named Lee
Cronin has been on a podcast a couple

752
00:14:40,749 --> 00:14:40,759
Cronin has been on a podcast a couple
 

753
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:43,230
Cronin has been on a podcast a couple
times who just got really pissed off

754
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:43,240
times who just got really pissed off
 

755
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,069
times who just got really pissed off
listen he probably got really pissed off

756
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:46,079
listen he probably got really pissed off
 

757
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,350
listen he probably got really pissed off
hearing that I for people somehow don't

758
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:48,360
hearing that I for people somehow don't
 

759
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,030
hearing that I for people somehow don't
know he's a chemist yeah but he would

760
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,040
know he's a chemist yeah but he would
 

761
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,350
know he's a chemist yeah but he would
agree with that statement would he I

762
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:52,360
agree with that statement would he I
 

763
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,189
agree with that statement would he I
don't think he would I don't think he

764
00:14:54,189 --> 00:14:54,199
don't think he would I don't think he
 

765
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:56,350
don't think he would I don't think he
would he would broaden the definition of

766
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:56,360
would he would broaden the definition of
 

767
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,749
would he would broaden the definition of
chemistry until it would include

768
00:14:57,749 --> 00:14:57,759
chemistry until it would include
 

769
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:00,269
chemistry until it would include
everything oh sure okay so you or maybe

770
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:00,279
everything oh sure okay so you or maybe
 

771
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:01,749
everything oh sure okay so you or maybe
I don't know but wait but you said that

772
00:15:01,749 --> 00:15:01,759
I don't know but wait but you said that
 

773
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:03,470
I don't know but wait but you said that
universe that's the first thing it

774
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:03,480
universe that's the first thing it
 

775
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,030
universe that's the first thing it
creates is chemistry we're the very

776
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:06,040
creates is chemistry we're the very
 

777
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,189
creates is chemistry we're the very
precisely it's not the first thing it

778
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:07,199
precisely it's not the first thing it
 

779
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,670
precisely it's not the first thing it
creates obviously like it has to make

780
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:08,680
creates obviously like it has to make
 

781
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,389
creates obviously like it has to make
atoms first but it's the first thing

782
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:10,399
atoms first but it's the first thing
 

783
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,829
atoms first but it's the first thing
like if you think about you know the

784
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:11,839
like if you think about you know the
 

785
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,110
like if you think about you know the
universe originated uh atoms were made

786
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:15,120
universe originated uh atoms were made
 

787
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,269
universe originated uh atoms were made
in you know Big Bang nuclear synthesis

788
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:17,279
in you know Big Bang nuclear synthesis
 

789
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,829
in you know Big Bang nuclear synthesis
and then later in stars and then planets

790
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:19,839
and then later in stars and then planets
 

791
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,150
and then later in stars and then planets
formed and planets become engines of

792
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:22,160
formed and planets become engines of
 

793
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,389
formed and planets become engines of
chemistry they start exploring what kind

794
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:25,399
chemistry they start exploring what kind
 

795
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:29,389
chemistry they start exploring what kind
of chemistry is possible and the

796
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:29,399
of chemistry is possible and the
 

797
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:32,910
of chemistry is possible and the
combinatorial space of chemistry is so

798
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:32,920
combinatorial space of chemistry is so
 

799
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,509
combinatorial space of chemistry is so
large that even on every planet in the

800
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:35,519
large that even on every planet in the
 

801
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,189
large that even on every planet in the
entire universe you will never express

802
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:37,199
entire universe you will never express
 

803
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,990
entire universe you will never express
every possible molecule um I I like this

804
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:41,000
every possible molecule um I I like this
 

805
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,590
every possible molecule um I I like this
example actually that that Lee gave me

806
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:42,600
example actually that that Lee gave me
 

807
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,110
example actually that that Lee gave me
which is to think about taol it has a

808
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:44,120
which is to think about taol it has a
 

809
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,870
which is to think about taol it has a
molecular weight about

810
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:45,880
molecular weight about
 

811
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,309
molecular weight about
853 it's got you know a lot of atoms but

812
00:15:48,309 --> 00:15:48,319
853 it's got you know a lot of atoms but
 

813
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:50,509
853 it's got you know a lot of atoms but
it's not astronomically large and if you

814
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:50,519
it's not astronomically large and if you
 

815
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:56,030
it's not astronomically large and if you
try to make um one molecule uh with that

816
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:56,040
try to make um one molecule uh with that
 

817
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,670
try to make um one molecule uh with that
molecular formula in every

818
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:57,680
molecular formula in every
 

819
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,110
molecular formula in every
three-dimensional shape you could make

820
00:15:59,110 --> 00:15:59,120
three-dimensional shape you could make
 

821
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,870
three-dimensional shape you could make
with that molecular formula it would

822
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:00,880
with that molecular formula it would
 

823
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,870
with that molecular formula it would
fill

824
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:01,880
fill
 

825
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,870
fill
1.5 universes in volume so that with one

826
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:06,880
1.5 universes in volume so that with one
 

827
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,710
1.5 universes in volume so that with one
unique molecule that's just one molecule

828
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:09,720
unique molecule that's just one molecule
 

829
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,189
unique molecule that's just one molecule
so chemical space is huge um and I think

830
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:13,199
so chemical space is huge um and I think
 

831
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,269
so chemical space is huge um and I think
it's really important to recognize that

832
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:15,279
it's really important to recognize that
 

833
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,710
it's really important to recognize that
because if you want to ask a question of

834
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:16,720
because if you want to ask a question of
 

835
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,790
because if you want to ask a question of
why does life emerge in chemistry well

836
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:18,800
why does life emerge in chemistry well
 

837
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,749
why does life emerge in chemistry well
life emerges in chemistry because life

838
00:16:20,749 --> 00:16:20,759
life emerges in chemistry because life
 

839
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:22,590
life emerges in chemistry because life
is the physics of how the universe

840
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:22,600
is the physics of how the universe
 

841
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,309
is the physics of how the universe
selects what gets to exist um and those

842
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:26,319
selects what gets to exist um and those
 

843
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,189
selects what gets to exist um and those
things get created along historically

844
00:16:28,189 --> 00:16:28,199
things get created along historically
 

845
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:29,550
things get created along historically
contingent pathways and memory and all

846
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:29,560
contingent pathways and memory and all
 

847
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,590
contingent pathways and memory and all
the other stuff that we can talk about

848
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:31,600
the other stuff that we can talk about
 

849
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,110
the other stuff that we can talk about
um but the universe has to actually make

850
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:34,120
um but the universe has to actually make
 

851
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,590
um but the universe has to actually make
historically contingent choices in

852
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:35,600
historically contingent choices in
 

853
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,309
historically contingent choices in
chemistry because it can't exhaust all

854
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:37,319
chemistry because it can't exhaust all
 

855
00:16:37,319 --> 00:16:39,189
chemistry because it can't exhaust all
possible molecules what kind of things

856
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:39,199
possible molecules what kind of things
 

857
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,790
possible molecules what kind of things
can you create that's outside the the

858
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:41,800
can you create that's outside the the
 

859
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,069
can you create that's outside the the
combinatorial space of chemistry that's

860
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:44,079
combinatorial space of chemistry that's
 

861
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,910
combinatorial space of chemistry that's
what I'm trying to understand oh if it's

862
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:45,920
what I'm trying to understand oh if it's
 

863
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,269
what I'm trying to understand oh if it's
not chemical so I think some of the

864
00:16:48,269 --> 00:16:48,279
not chemical so I think some of the
 

865
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,990
not chemical so I think some of the
things that have evolved on our

866
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,000
things that have evolved on our
 

867
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,389
things that have evolved on our
biosphere I would call as much alive as

868
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:53,399
biosphere I would call as much alive as
 

869
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:56,350
biosphere I would call as much alive as
chemistry as a cell um but they seem

870
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:56,360
chemistry as a cell um but they seem
 

871
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,550
chemistry as a cell um but they seem
much more abstract so for example I

872
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:58,560
much more abstract so for example I
 

873
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,430
much more abstract so for example I
think language is alive I think um or at

874
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:01,440
think language is alive I think um or at
 

875
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,990
think language is alive I think um or at
least life um I think memes are I think

876
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,000
least life um I think memes are I think
 

877
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,829
least life um I think memes are I think
you're saying language is life yes

878
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:07,839
you're saying language is life yes
 

879
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,230
you're saying language is life yes
language is alive oh boy I'm going to

880
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:10,240
language is alive oh boy I'm going to
 

881
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,870
language is alive oh boy I'm going to
have to explore that

882
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:11,880
have to explore that
 

883
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,949
have to explore that
one okay life Maybe not maybe not alive

884
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:14,959
one okay life Maybe not maybe not alive
 

885
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,549
one okay life Maybe not maybe not alive
but I don't I actually I don't know

886
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:16,559
but I don't I actually I don't know
 

887
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,669
but I don't I actually I don't know
where I stand exactly on that um I've

888
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:18,679
where I stand exactly on that um I've
 

889
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:19,590
where I stand exactly on that um I've
been thinking about that a little bit

890
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:19,600
been thinking about that a little bit
 

891
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,710
been thinking about that a little bit
more lately but mathematics too um and

892
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:22,720
more lately but mathematics too um and
 

893
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,230
more lately but mathematics too um and
it's interesting because people think

894
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,240
it's interesting because people think
 

895
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,829
it's interesting because people think
that math has this platonic reality that

896
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:26,839
that math has this platonic reality that
 

897
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,350
that math has this platonic reality that
exists outside of our universe and I

898
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:28,360
exists outside of our universe and I
 

899
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,710
exists outside of our universe and I
think it's a feature of our biosphere

900
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:30,720
think it's a feature of our biosphere
 

901
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,549
think it's a feature of our biosphere
and it's telling us something about the

902
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:33,559
and it's telling us something about the
 

903
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:34,669
and it's telling us something about the
structure of

904
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:34,679
structure of
 

905
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,990
structure of
ourselves um and I find that really

906
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:37,000
ourselves um and I find that really
 

907
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,110
ourselves um and I find that really
interesting because when you would sort

908
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:38,120
interesting because when you would sort
 

909
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,870
interesting because when you would sort
of internalize all of these things that

910
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:39,880
of internalize all of these things that
 

911
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,549
of internalize all of these things that
we notice about the world and you start

912
00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:41,559
we notice about the world and you start
 

913
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:43,110
we notice about the world and you start
asking well what do these look like if I

914
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:43,120
asking well what do these look like if I
 

915
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,470
asking well what do these look like if I
was you know something outside of myself

916
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:46,480
was you know something outside of myself
 

917
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,310
was you know something outside of myself
observing these systems that we're all

918
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:49,320
observing these systems that we're all
 

919
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,190
observing these systems that we're all
embedded in what would that structure

920
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:51,200
embedded in what would that structure
 

921
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,750
embedded in what would that structure
look like and I think we look really

922
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:52,760
look like and I think we look really
 

923
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,549
look like and I think we look really
different than the way that we talk

you're sneaking up on a different kind

954
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:35,000
you're sneaking up on a different kind
 

955
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,789
you're sneaking up on a different kind

00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:40,600
combinatorial space yeah room for
 

959
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,110
combinatorial space yeah room for
creativity definitely not chemical I

960

00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,870
creativity definitely not chemical I
mean chemistry is one subed to chem

962
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:46,880
mean chemistry is one subed to chem
 

963
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,310
mean chemistry is one subed to chem
chemical okay what about the third thing

964
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:49,320
chemical okay what about the third thing
 

965
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,950
chemical okay what about the third thing
which I think would be the the hardest

966
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:50,960
which I think would be the the hardest
 

967
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,789
which I think would be the the hardest
CU you probably like it the most is

968
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:52,799
CU you probably like it the most is
 

969
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,830
CU you probably like it the most is
evolution or selection well specifically

970
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:55,840
evolution or selection well specifically
 

971
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,789
evolution or selection well specifically
it's darwinian Evolution and I think

972
00:18:57,789 --> 00:18:57,799
it's darwinian Evolution and I think
 

973
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:00,630
it's darwinian Evolution and I think
darwinian evolution is a problem but the

974
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:00,640
darwinian evolution is a problem but the
 

975
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,230
darwinian evolution is a problem but the
reason that that definition is a problem

976
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:02,240
reason that that definition is a problem
 

977
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,870
reason that that definition is a problem
is not because evolution is in the

978
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:03,880
is not because evolution is in the
 

979
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,430
is not because evolution is in the
definition but because the implication

980
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:07,440
definition but because the implication
 

981
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,390
definition but because the implication
is that you know that PE most people

982
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:10,400
is that you know that PE most people
 

983
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,870
is that you know that PE most people
would want to make is that an individual

984
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:11,880
would want to make is that an individual
 

985
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,750
would want to make is that an individual
is alive and The evolutionary process at

986
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:14,760
is alive and The evolutionary process at
 

987
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,149
is alive and The evolutionary process at
least the darwinian evolutionary process

988
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:16,159
least the darwinian evolutionary process
 

989
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:18,230
least the darwinian evolutionary process
most evolutionary processes they don't

990
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:18,240
most evolutionary processes they don't
 

991
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,190
most evolutionary processes they don't
happen um at the level of individuals

992
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:21,200
happen um at the level of individuals
 

993
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,750
happen um at the level of individuals
they happen at the level of populations

994
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:22,760
they happen at the level of populations
 

995
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,950
they happen at the level of populations
so again you would be saying something

996
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:24,960
so again you would be saying something
 

997
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,909
so again you would be saying something
like what we saw with the self-

998
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:25,919
like what we saw with the self-
 

999
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,190
like what we saw with the self-
sustaining definition which is that

1000
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:28,200
sustaining definition which is that
 

1001
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,350
sustaining definition which is that
population are alive but individuals

1002
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:30,360
population are alive but individuals
 

1003
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,789
population are alive but individuals
aren't because populations evolve and

1004
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:31,799
aren't because populations evolve and
 

1005
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:33,470
aren't because populations evolve and
individuals don't and obviously like

1006
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:33,480
individuals don't and obviously like
 

1007
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,990
individuals don't and obviously like
maybe you're alive because you know your

1008
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,000
maybe you're alive because you know your
 

1009
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,630
maybe you're alive because you know your

explain life evolution is a much broader
thing so so in an an individual organism

1020
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:52,679
thing so so in an an individual organism
 

1021
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:55,029
thing so so in an an individual organism
can evolve under assembly theory yes

1022
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:55,039
can evolve under assembly theory yes
 

1023
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,430
can evolve under assembly theory yes
you're constructing yourself all the

00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:56,440
you're constructing yourself all the
 

1025
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,950
you're constructing yourself all the

for things to exist what if you

1030
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:01,480
for things to exist what if you
 

1031
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,350
for things to exist what if you
reformulate everything like a population

1032
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:03,360
reformulate everything like a population
 

1033
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,230
reformulate everything like a population
is a living organism so that's fine too

1034
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:06,240
is a living organism so that's fine too
 

1035
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,830
is a living organism so that's fine too
but but this again gets back to so um so

1036
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:09,840
but but this again gets back to so um so
 

1037
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,230
but but this again gets back to so um so
I think what all of the you know like we

1038
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:11,240
I think what all of the you know like we
 

1039
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,870
I think what all of the you know like we
can nitpick at definitions I don't think

1040
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:12,880
can nitpick at definitions I don't think
 

1041
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,669
can nitpick at definitions I don't think
it's like incredibly helpful to do it

1042
00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:14,679
it's like incredibly helpful to do it
 

1043
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:17,110
it's like incredibly helpful to do it
but the reason for for me fun yeah it is

1044
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,120
but the reason for for me fun yeah it is
 

1045
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,350
but the reason for for me fun yeah it is
fun it is really fun and actually do I

1046
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:19,360
fun it is really fun and actually do I
 

1047
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,430
fun it is really fun and actually do I
do think it's useful in the sense that

1048
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:21,440
do think it's useful in the sense that
 

1049
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,950
do think it's useful in the sense that
when you see the way the ways that they

1050
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:22,960
when you see the way the ways that they
 

1051
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,470
when you see the way the ways that they
all break down um you either have to

1052
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:26,480
all break down um you either have to
 

1053
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,669
all break down um you either have to
keep forcing in your like sort of

1054
00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:28,679
keep forcing in your like sort of
 

1055
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:30,390
keep forcing in your like sort of
conception of life you want to have or

1056
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:30,400
conception of life you want to have or
 

1057
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,710
conception of life you want to have or
you have to say all these definitions

1058
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:31,720
you have to say all these definitions
 

1059
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,270
you have to say all these definitions
are breaking down for a reason maybe I

1060
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:33,280
are breaking down for a reason maybe I
 

1061
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,990
are breaking down for a reason maybe I
should adopt a more expansive definition

1062
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:36,000
should adopt a more expansive definition
 

1063
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,270
should adopt a more expansive definition
that encompasses all the things that I

1064
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:38,280
that encompasses all the things that I
 

1065
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,230
that encompasses all the things that I
think and are life and so for me I think

1066
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:42,240
think and are life and so for me I think
 

1067
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,710
think and are life and so for me I think
life is the process of how information

1068
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:44,720
life is the process of how information
 

1069
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,230
life is the process of how information
structures matter over time and space

1070
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:48,240
structures matter over time and space
 

1071
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,390
structures matter over time and space
and an an example of life is what

1072
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:50,400
and an an example of life is what
 

1073
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,830
and an an example of life is what
emerges on a planet and yields an

1074
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:52,840
emerges on a planet and yields an
 

1075
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,190
emerges on a planet and yields an
open-ended Cascade of generation of

1076
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:55,200
open-ended Cascade of generation of
 

1077
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,909
open-ended Cascade of generation of
structure and increasing complexity and

1078
00:20:57,909 --> 00:20:57,919
structure and increasing complexity and
 

1079
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,470
structure and increasing complexity and
this is the thing that life is and any

1080
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:00,480
this is the thing that life is and any
 

1081
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,870
this is the thing that life is and any
individual is just a particular instance

1082
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:02,880
individual is just a particular instance
 

1083
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,750
individual is just a particular instance
of these

1084
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:03,760
of these
 

1085
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,750
of these
lineages that are you know structured

1086
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:06,760
lineages that are you know structured
 

1087
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,070
lineages that are you know structured
across time um and so we focus so much

1088
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,080
across time um and so we focus so much
 

1089
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,669
across time um and so we focus so much
on these individuals that are these

1090
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:11,679
on these individuals that are these
 

1091
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,110
on these individuals that are these
short temporal moments in this L larger

1092
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:14,120
short temporal moments in this L larger
 

1093
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,310
short temporal moments in this L larger
causal structure that actually is the

1094
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:16,320
causal structure that actually is the
 

1095
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,909
causal structure that actually is the
life on our planet um and I think that's

1096
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:19,919
life on our planet um and I think that's
 

1097
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,789
life on our planet um and I think that's
why these definitions break down because

1098
00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:21,799
why these definitions break down because
 

1099
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:23,950
why these definitions break down because
they're not General enough they're not

they're not General enough they're not

they're not abstract enough to actually

they're not abstract enough to actually
 

1105
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:29,110
they're not abstract enough to actually
capture that regularity cuz were focused

1107
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,350
capture that regularity cuz were focused
on those that little affir thing that we

00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:37,390
call human life Aristotle focusing on
you know heavy things falling because

1112
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:37,400
you know heavy things falling because
 

1113
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,430
you know heavy things falling because
they're earthlike and you know things

1114
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:40,440
they're earthlike and you know things
 

1115
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,630
they're earthlike and you know things
floating because they're air likee it's

1116
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:42,640
floating because they're air likee it's
 

1117
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,590
floating because they're air likee it's
the wrong thing to focus on so what what

1118
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:45,600
the wrong thing to focus on so what what
 

1119
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,470
the wrong thing to focus on so what what
exactly are we missing by focusing on

1120
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:47,480
exactly are we missing by focusing on
 

1121
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,909
exactly are we missing by focusing on
such a short span of time I think we're

1122
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:50,919
such a short span of time I think we're
 

1123
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:52,870
such a short span of time I think we're
missing most of what we are so one of

1124
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:52,880
missing most of what we are so one of
 

1125
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,269
missing most of what we are so one of
the issues I've been thinking about this

1126
00:21:55,269 --> 00:21:55,279
the issues I've been thinking about this
 

1127
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:57,669
the issues I've been thinking about this
all like really viscerally lately it's

1128
00:21:57,669 --> 00:21:57,679
all like really viscerally lately it's
 

1129
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,350
all like really viscerally lately it's
weird when you do theor physics cuz I

1130
00:21:59,350 --> 00:21:59,360
weird when you do theor physics cuz I
 

1131
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,669
weird when you do theor physics cuz I
think it like literally changes the

1132
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:00,679
think it like literally changes the
 

1133
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:02,909
think it like literally changes the
structure of your brain and you see the

1134
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:02,919
structure of your brain and you see the
 

1135
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:04,430
structure of your brain and you see the
world differently especially when you're

1136
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:04,440
world differently especially when you're
 

1137
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,990
world differently especially when you're
trying to build new abstractions do you

1138
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,000
trying to build new abstractions do you
 

1139
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,070
trying to build new abstractions do you
think it's possible if you're a

1140
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:07,080
think it's possible if you're a
 

1141
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,029
think it's possible if you're a
theoretical physicist that like it's

1142
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:09,039
theoretical physicist that like it's
 

1143
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,630
theoretical physicist that like it's
easy to fall off the cliff and go

1144
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:11,640
easy to fall off the cliff and go
 

1145
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,830
easy to fall off the cliff and go
descend to Madness I mean I think you're

1146
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:13,840
descend to Madness I mean I think you're
 

1147
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,549
descend to Madness I mean I think you're
always on the edge of it but I think

1148
00:22:15,549 --> 00:22:15,559
always on the edge of it but I think
 

1149
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:19,630
always on the edge of it but I think
what is amazing about being a scientist

1150
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:19,640
what is amazing about being a scientist
 

1151
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,789
what is amazing about being a scientist
um and trying to do things rigorously is

1152
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:21,799
um and trying to do things rigorously is
 

1153
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:24,630
um and trying to do things rigorously is
it keeps your sanity so I think if I

1154
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:24,640
it keeps your sanity so I think if I
 

1155
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,630
it keeps your sanity so I think if I
wasn't a theoretical physicist I would I

1156
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:26,640
wasn't a theoretical physicist I would I
 

1157
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,310
wasn't a theoretical physicist I would I
would be probably not saying

1158
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:29,320
would be probably not saying
 

1159
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,149
would be probably not saying
um but what it forces you to do is hold

1160
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:31,159
um but what it forces you to do is hold
 

1161
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:32,710
um but what it forces you to do is hold
the like you have to hold yourself to

1162
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:32,720
the like you have to hold yourself to
 

1163
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,990
the like you have to hold yourself to
the fire of like these abstractions in

1164
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:35,000
the fire of like these abstractions in
 

1165
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,789
the fire of like these abstractions in
my mind have to really correspond to

1166
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:36,799
my mind have to really correspond to
 

1167
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,510
my mind have to really correspond to
reality and I have to really test that

1168
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:38,520
reality and I have to really test that
 

1169
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,950
reality and I have to really test that
all the time and so I love building new

1170
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:40,960
all the time and so I love building new
 

1171
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,750
all the time and so I love building new
abstractions and I love going to those

1172
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:42,760
abstractions and I love going to those
 

1173
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,029
abstractions and I love going to those
like incredibly

1174
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:44,039
like incredibly
 

1175
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:46,830
like incredibly
creative uh you know spaces that people

1176
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:46,840
creative uh you know spaces that people
 

1177
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,669
creative uh you know spaces that people
don't

1178
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:47,679
don't
 

1179
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,549
don't
see um as part of the way that we

1180
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:50,559
see um as part of the way that we
 

1181
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,070
see um as part of the way that we
understand the world now but ultimately

1182
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:53,080
understand the world now but ultimately
 

1183
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,669
understand the world now but ultimately
I have to make sure that whatever I'm

1184
00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:54,679
I have to make sure that whatever I'm
 

1185
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:56,230
I have to make sure that whatever I'm
pulling from that space is something

1186
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:56,240
pulling from that space is something
 

1187
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,950
pulling from that space is something
that's really usable and really like

1188
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:57,960
that's really usable and really like
 

1189
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,630
that's really usable and really like
relates the world outside of me that's

1190
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:00,640
relates the world outside of me that's
 

1191
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,149
relates the world outside of me that's
what science is so we were talking about

1192
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:03,159
what science is so we were talking about
 

1193
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:05,110
what science is so we were talking about
what we're missing when we look at a

1194
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,120
what we're missing when we look at a
 

1195
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,390
what we're missing when we look at a
small stretch of time in a small stretch

1196
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:08,400
small stretch of time in a small stretch
 

1197
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,430
small stretch of time in a small stretch
of space yeah so the issue is um we

1198
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:13,440
of space yeah so the issue is um we
 

1199
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,630
of space yeah so the issue is um we
evolve perception to see reality a

1200
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:15,640
evolve perception to see reality a
 

1201
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,430
evolve perception to see reality a
certain way right so for us Space is

1202
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:18,440
certain way right so for us Space is
 

1203
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,750
certain way right so for us Space is
really important and time feels bleeding

1204
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:20,760
really important and time feels bleeding
 

1205
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,909
really important and time feels bleeding
and I I you know I had a really

1206
00:23:22,909 --> 00:23:22,919
and I I you know I had a really
 

1207
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:25,190
and I I you know I had a really
wonderful Mentor Paul Davies most of my

1208
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:25,200
wonderful Mentor Paul Davies most of my
 

1209
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,830
wonderful Mentor Paul Davies most of my
career and Paul's amazing because he

1210
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:26,840
career and Paul's amazing because he
 

1211
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,990
career and Paul's amazing because he
gives these like little he thought

1212
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:29,000
gives these like little he thought
 

1213
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,630
gives these like little he thought
experiments all the time like you know

1214
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:30,640
experiments all the time like you know
 

1215
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,950
experiments all the time like you know
something he used to ask me all the time

1216
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:31,960
something he used to ask me all the time
 

1217
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,549
something he used to ask me all the time
was when I was a postto this is kind of

1218
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:33,559
was when I was a postto this is kind of
 

1219
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:35,750
was when I was a postto this is kind of
a random tangent but was like you know

1220
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:35,760
a random tangent but was like you know
 

1221
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,149
a random tangent but was like you know
how much of the universe be could be

1222
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:37,159
how much of the universe be could be
 

1223
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:39,149
how much of the universe be could be
converted into technology if you were

1224
00:23:39,149 --> 00:23:39,159
converted into technology if you were
 

1225
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:40,510
converted into technology if you were
thinking about like you know long-term

1226
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:40,520
thinking about like you know long-term
 

1227
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,950
thinking about like you know long-term
Futures and stuff like that and it's

1228
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:41,960
Futures and stuff like that and it's
 

1229
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,549
Futures and stuff like that and it's
like a weird thought experiment but like

1230
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:43,559
like a weird thought experiment but like
 

1231
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:45,669
like a weird thought experiment but like
there's a lot of deep things there I do

1232
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:45,679
there's a lot of deep things there I do
 

1233
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,710
there's a lot of deep things there I do
think a lot about the fact that we're

1234
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:47,720
think a lot about the fact that we're
 

1235
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,750
think a lot about the fact that we're
really limited in our interactions with

1236
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:49,760
really limited in our interactions with
 

1237
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,269
really limited in our interactions with
reality by the particular architectures

1238
00:23:52,269 --> 00:23:52,279
reality by the particular architectures
 

1239
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:55,029
reality by the particular architectures
that we evolved um and so we're not

1240
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:55,039
that we evolved um and so we're not
 

1241
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,149
that we evolved um and so we're not
seeing everything and in fact our

1242
00:23:57,149 --> 00:23:57,159
seeing everything and in fact our
 

1243
00:23:57,159 --> 00:23:58,710
seeing everything and in fact our
technology tells us the solid time

1244
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:58,720
technology tells us the solid time
 

1245
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,990
technology tells us the solid time
because it allows us to see the world in

1246
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,000
because it allows us to see the world in
 

1247
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,390
because it allows us to see the world in
new ways um by basically allowing us to

1248
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:02,400
new ways um by basically allowing us to
 

1249
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,549
new ways um by basically allowing us to
perceive the world in ways that we

1250
00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:03,559
perceive the world in ways that we
 

1251
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:05,830
perceive the world in ways that we
couldn't otherwise and so what I'm

1252
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:05,840
couldn't otherwise and so what I'm
 

1253
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,909
couldn't otherwise and so what I'm
getting at with this is I think that

1254
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:09,919
getting at with this is I think that
 

1255
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,710
getting at with this is I think that
living objects are actually huge like

1256
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:13,720
living objects are actually huge like
 

1257
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,870
living objects are actually huge like
they're some of the biggest structures

1258
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:14,880
they're some of the biggest structures
 

1259
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,909
they're some of the biggest structures
in the universe but they are not big in

1260
00:24:16,909 --> 00:24:16,919
in the universe but they are not big in
 

1261
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:19,510
in the universe but they are not big in
space they are big in time and we

1262
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:19,520
space they are big in time and we
 

1263
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,470
space they are big in time and we
actually can't resolve that feature we

1264
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:21,480
actually can't resolve that feature we
 

1265
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,029
actually can't resolve that feature we
don't interact with it on a regular

1266
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:23,039
don't interact with it on a regular
 

1267
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,990
don't interact with it on a regular
basis so we see them as these fleeting

1268
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:25,000
basis so we see them as these fleeting
 

1269
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,549
basis so we see them as these fleeting
things that have this really short

1270
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:26,559
things that have this really short
 

1271
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,549
things that have this really short
temporal clock time without seeing how

1272
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:28,559
temporal clock time without seeing how
 

1273
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,549
temporal clock time without seeing how
large they are when I'm saying time here

1274
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:30,559
large they are when I'm saying time here
 

1275
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,269
large they are when I'm saying time here
I really like the way that people could

1276
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:33,279
I really like the way that people could
 

1277
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,830
I really like the way that people could
picture it is in terms of causal

1278
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:34,840
picture it is in terms of causal
 

1279
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,990
picture it is in terms of causal
structure so if you think about the

1280
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:37,000
structure so if you think about the
 

1281
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,389
structure so if you think about the
history of the universe to get to you

1282
00:24:39,389 --> 00:24:39,399
history of the universe to get to you
 

1283
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:41,549
history of the universe to get to you
and you imagine that that entire history

1284
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:41,559
and you imagine that that entire history
 

1285
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:46,470
and you imagine that that entire history
is you that is the I the picture I have

1286
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:46,480
is you that is the I the picture I have
 

1287
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,149
is you that is the I the picture I have
in my mind when I look at every living

1288
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:48,159
in my mind when I look at every living
 

1289
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,630
in my mind when I look at every living
thing so you have a you have a tweet for

1290
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:51,640
thing so you have a you have a tweet for
 

1291
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,630
thing so you have a you have a tweet for
everything you tweeted doesn't everyone

1292
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:54,640
everything you tweeted doesn't everyone
 

1293
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,549
everything you tweeted doesn't everyone
you have a lot of poetic profound tweets

1294
00:24:57,549 --> 00:24:57,559
you have a lot of poetic profound tweets
 

1295
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:59,230
you have a lot of poetic profound tweets
um sometimes

1296
00:24:59,230 --> 00:24:59,240
um sometimes
 

1297
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,350
um sometimes
they're

1298
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:00,360
they're
 

1299
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,669
they're
puzzles that take a long time to figure

1300
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:02,679
puzzles that take a long time to figure
 

1301
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:04,230
puzzles that take a long time to figure
out well you know what it is the trick

1302
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:04,240
out well you know what it is the trick
 

1303
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,029
out well you know what it is the trick
is the reason they're hard to write is

1304
00:25:06,029 --> 00:25:06,039
is the reason they're hard to write is
 

1305
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:08,549
is the reason they're hard to write is
because it's compressing a very deep

1306
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:08,559
because it's compressing a very deep
 

1307
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,909
because it's compressing a very deep
idea into a short amount of space and I

1308
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:10,919
idea into a short amount of space and I
 

1309
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:12,070
idea into a short amount of space and I
really like doing that intellectual

1310
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:12,080
really like doing that intellectual
 

1311
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,510
really like doing that intellectual
exercise because I find it productive

1312
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:13,520
exercise because I find it productive
 

1313
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,830
exercise because I find it productive
for me yeah it's a very interesting kind

1314
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:15,840
for me yeah it's a very interesting kind
 

1315
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,350
for me yeah it's a very interesting kind
of compression algorithm though yeah I

1316
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:18,360
of compression algorithm though yeah I
 

1317
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,710
of compression algorithm though yeah I
like language I think it's really fun to

1318
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:19,720
like language I think it's really fun to
 

1319
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,669
like language I think it's really fun to
play with yeah I wonder if AI can uh

1320
00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:22,679
play with yeah I wonder if AI can uh
 

1321
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:24,590
play with yeah I wonder if AI can uh
decompress it that' be

1322
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:24,600
decompress it that' be
 

1323
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,909
decompress it that' be
interesting I would like to try this but

1324
00:25:26,909 --> 00:25:26,919
interesting I would like to try this but
 

1325
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:29,269
interesting I would like to try this but
I think I use langu anguage in certain

1326
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:29,279
I think I use langu anguage in certain
 

1327
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,590
I think I use langu anguage in certain
ways that are non-canonical and I do it

1328
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:31,600
ways that are non-canonical and I do it
 

1329
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,310
ways that are non-canonical and I do it
very purposefully and it would be

1330
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:33,320
very purposefully and it would be
 

1331
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,549
very purposefully and it would be
interesting to me how AI would interpret

1332
00:25:35,549 --> 00:25:35,559
interesting to me how AI would interpret
 

1333
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:36,789
interesting to me how AI would interpret
it yeah your tweets would be a good

1334
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:36,799
it yeah your tweets would be a good
 

1335
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,110
it yeah your tweets would be a good
touring test for this for super

1336
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:39,120
touring test for this for super
 

1337
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,750
touring test for this for super
intelligence anyway you tweeted that

1338
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:41,760
intelligence anyway you tweeted that
 

1339
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,630
intelligence anyway you tweeted that
things only look

1340
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:43,640
things only look
 

1341
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,549
things only look
emergent because we can't see time mhm

1342
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:47,559
emergent because we can't see time mhm
 

1343
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:50,630
emergent because we can't see time mhm
so if we could see time what would the

1344
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:50,640
so if we could see time what would the
 

1345
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,110
so if we could see time what would the
world look like you're saying you'll be

1346
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:53,120
world look like you're saying you'll be
 

1347
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,149
world look like you're saying you'll be
able to see everything that an object

1348
00:25:56,149 --> 00:25:56,159
able to see everything that an object
 

1349
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,430
able to see everything that an object
has been every step of the way that led

1350
00:25:59,430 --> 00:25:59,440
has been every step of the way that led
 

1351
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,510
has been every step of the way that led
to this current

1352
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:01,520
to this current
 

1353
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,310
to this current
moment and all the interactions that

1354
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:06,320
moment and all the interactions that
 

1355
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,389
moment and all the interactions that
required to make that Evolution happen

1356
00:26:08,389 --> 00:26:08,399
required to make that Evolution happen
 

1357
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:11,190
required to make that Evolution happen
so you would see this gigantic Tale the

1358
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:11,200
so you would see this gigantic Tale the
 

1359
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,909
so you would see this gigantic Tale the
universe is far larger in time than it

1360
00:26:14,909 --> 00:26:14,919
universe is far larger in time than it
 

1361
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:19,950
universe is far larger in time than it
is in space yeah and this planet is one

1362
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:19,960
is in space yeah and this planet is one
 

1363
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,990
is in space yeah and this planet is one
of the biggest things in the universe

1364
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:22,000
of the biggest things in the universe
 

1365
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,510
of the biggest things in the universe
also the more complexity the

1366
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:24,520
also the more complexity the
 

1367
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,549
also the more complexity the
bigger yeah Tech technosphere I think

1368
00:26:27,549 --> 00:26:27,559
bigger yeah Tech technosphere I think
 

1369
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:29,710
bigger yeah Tech technosphere I think
the the modern technosphere is the

1370
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:29,720
the the modern technosphere is the
 

1371
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,590
the the modern technosphere is the
largest object in time in the universe

1372
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:31,600
largest object in time in the universe
 

1373
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,630
largest object in time in the universe
that we know about and when you say

1374
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:33,640
that we know about and when you say
 

1375
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,389
that we know about and when you say
technosphere what do you mean I mean uh

1376
00:26:36,389 --> 00:26:36,399
technosphere what do you mean I mean uh
 

1377
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:39,230
technosphere what do you mean I mean uh
the global integration of life and

1378
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:39,240
the global integration of life and
 

1379
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,269
the global integration of life and
Technology on this planet so all the

1380
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:41,279
Technology on this planet so all the
 

1381
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,230
Technology on this planet so all the
things all the technological things we

1382
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:43,240
things all the technological things we
 

1383
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,070
things all the technological things we
created but I don't think of them as

1384
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:45,080
created but I don't think of them as
 

1385
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,510
created but I don't think of them as
separate they're like very integrated

1386
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:46,520
separate they're like very integrated
 

1387
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,470
separate they're like very integrated
with the structure that generated them

1388
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:48,480
with the structure that generated them
 

1389
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,430
with the structure that generated them
so you can almost imagine it like time

1390
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:50,440
so you can almost imagine it like time
 

1391
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,590
so you can almost imagine it like time
is constantly bifurcating and it's

1392
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:52,600
is constantly bifurcating and it's
 

1393
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,830
is constantly bifurcating and it's
generating new structures and these new

1394
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:54,840
generating new structures and these new
 

1395
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:59,029
generating new structures and these new
structures are um you know locally

1396
00:26:59,029 --> 00:26:59,039
structures are um you know locally
 

1397
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,549
structures are um you know locally
constructing the future and so things

1398
00:27:01,549 --> 00:27:01,559
constructing the future and so things
 

1399
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,950
constructing the future and so things
like you and I are very close together

1400
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:03,960
like you and I are very close together
 

1401
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,029
like you and I are very close together
in time because we didn't diverge like

1402
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:06,039
in time because we didn't diverge like
 

1403
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:07,310
in time because we didn't diverge like
very early in the history of universe

1404
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:07,320
very early in the history of universe
 

1405
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,590
very early in the history of universe
it's very recent um and I think this is

1406
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:09,600
it's very recent um and I think this is
 

1407
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,870
it's very recent um and I think this is
one of the reasons that we can

1408
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:10,880
one of the reasons that we can
 

1409
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,789
one of the reasons that we can
understand each other so well and we can

1410
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:12,799
understand each other so well and we can
 

1411
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,510
understand each other so well and we can
communicate effectively um and I might

1412
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:15,520
communicate effectively um and I might
 

1413
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,669
communicate effectively um and I might
have some sense of what it feels like to

1414
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:17,679
have some sense of what it feels like to
 

1415
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,350
have some sense of what it feels like to
be you but you know other organisms um

1416
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:21,360
be you but you know other organisms um
 

1417
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,870
be you but you know other organisms um
bifurcated from us in time earlier this

1418
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:23,880
bifurcated from us in time earlier this
 

1419
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,510
bifurcated from us in time earlier this
is just the concept of philogyny right

1420
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:26,520
is just the concept of philogyny right
 

1421
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,430
is just the concept of philogyny right
um but if you take that deeper and you

1422
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:28,440
um but if you take that deeper and you
 

1423
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,990
um but if you take that deeper and you
really think about that as the structure

1424
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:31,000
really think about that as the structure
 

1425
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,510
really think about that as the structure
of the physics that generates life um

1426
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:34,520
of the physics that generates life um
 

1427
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,510
of the physics that generates life um
and you take that very seriously all of

1428
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:36,520
and you take that very seriously all of
 

1429
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,950
and you take that very seriously all of
that causation is is still bundled up in

1430
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:40,960
that causation is is still bundled up in
 

1431
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,990
that causation is is still bundled up in
the objects we observe today and so um

1432
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:45,000
the objects we observe today and so um
 

1433
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,269
the objects we observe today and so um
so you and I are are close in this

1434
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:48,279
so you and I are are close in this
 

1435
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:51,470
so you and I are are close in this
temporal structure but we're also um

1436
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:51,480
temporal structure but we're also um
 

1437
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,430
temporal structure but we're also um
we're so close because we're really big

1438
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:53,440
we're so close because we're really big
 

1439
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,430
we're so close because we're really big
and we only are very different in sort

1440
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:55,440
and we only are very different in sort
 

1441
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,230
and we only are very different in sort
of like the most recent moments in the

1442
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:57,240
of like the most recent moments in the
 

1443
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,549
of like the most recent moments in the
time that's like Ed in

1444
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:00,559
time that's like Ed in
 

1445
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,310
time that's like Ed in
us uh it's hard to use words to

1446
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:03,320
us uh it's hard to use words to
 

1447
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,269
us uh it's hard to use words to
visualize what's in

1448
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:06,279
visualize what's in
 

1449
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:08,509
visualize what's in
Minds I have such a hard time with this

1450
00:28:08,509 --> 00:28:08,519
Minds I have such a hard time with this
 

1451
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:09,870
Minds I have such a hard time with this
sometimes I'm like I like I actually I

1452
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:09,880
sometimes I'm like I like I actually I
 

1453
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,190
sometimes I'm like I like I actually I
was thinking on the way over here I was

1454
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:11,200
was thinking on the way over here I was
 

1455
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,990
was thinking on the way over here I was
like I like you know you have pictures

1456
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:13,000
like I like you know you have pictures
 

1457
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,350
like I like you know you have pictures
in your brain and then they're hard to

1458
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:15,360
in your brain and then they're hard to
 

1459
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,269
in your brain and then they're hard to
put into words but I realized I always

1460
00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:17,279
put into words but I realized I always
 

1461
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,230
put into words but I realized I always
say I have a visual but it's not

1462
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:19,240
say I have a visual but it's not
 

1463
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,710
say I have a visual but it's not
actually I have a visual it's I have a

1464
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:20,720
actually I have a visual it's I have a
 

1465
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,549
actually I have a visual it's I have a
feeling because oftentimes I cannot

1466
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:22,559
feeling because oftentimes I cannot
 

1467
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,669
feeling because oftentimes I cannot
actually draw a picture in my mind for

1468
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:25,679
actually draw a picture in my mind for
 

1469
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,509
actually draw a picture in my mind for
the things that I say but times they go

1470
00:28:28,509 --> 00:28:28,519
the things that I say but times they go
 

1471
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:29,590
the things that I say but times they go
through a picture before they get to

1472
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:29,600
through a picture before they get to
 

1473
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,230
through a picture before they get to
words but I like experimenting with

1474
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:31,240
words but I like experimenting with
 

1475
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,070
words but I like experimenting with
words because I think they help paint

1476
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:33,080
words because I think they help paint
 

1477
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,630
words because I think they help paint
pictures yeah it's again some kind of

1478
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:35,640
pictures yeah it's again some kind of
 

1479
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,029
pictures yeah it's again some kind of
compressed feeling that you can query to

1480
00:28:39,029 --> 00:28:39,039
compressed feeling that you can query to
 

1481
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,470
compressed feeling that you can query to
get a a sense of the bigger

1482
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:41,480
get a a sense of the bigger
 

1483
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,990
get a a sense of the bigger
visualization that you have in mind it's

1484
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:44,000
visualization that you have in mind it's
 

1485
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,630
visualization that you have in mind it's
just a really nice

1486
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:45,640
just a really nice
 

1487
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,950
just a really nice
compression but I think the idea of this

1488
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:48,960
compression but I think the idea of this
 

1489
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,269
compression but I think the idea of this
object that in it contains all the

1490
00:28:52,269 --> 00:28:52,279
object that in it contains all the
 

1491
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:54,149
object that in it contains all the
information about the history of an

1492
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:54,159
information about the history of an
 

1493
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,509
information about the history of an
entity that you see now just trying to

1494
00:28:56,509 --> 00:28:56,519
entity that you see now just trying to
 

1495
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:59,230
entity that you see now just trying to
visualize that is pretty cool yeah it's

1496
00:28:59,230 --> 00:28:59,240
visualize that is pretty cool yeah it's
 

1497
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,190
visualize that is pretty cool yeah it's
I mean obviously the Mind breaks

1498
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:01,200
I mean obviously the Mind breaks
 

1499
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,269
I mean obviously the Mind breaks
down quickly as you step seconds and

1500
00:29:04,269 --> 00:29:04,279
down quickly as you step seconds and
 

1501
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:07,269
down quickly as you step seconds and
minutes back in time but for

1502
00:29:07,269 --> 00:29:07,279
minutes back in time but for
 

1503
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:11,630
minutes back in time but for
sure I guess it's just a

1504
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:11,640
sure I guess it's just a
 

1505
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,430
sure I guess it's just a
gigantic object yeah supposed to be

1506
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:14,440
gigantic object yeah supposed to be
 

1507
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,070
gigantic object yeah supposed to be
thinking about yeah I think so and I

1508
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:16,080
thinking about yeah I think so and I
 

1509
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,470
thinking about yeah I think so and I
think this is one of the reasons that we

1510
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:17,480
think this is one of the reasons that we
 

1511
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,630
think this is one of the reasons that we
have such an ability to abstract um as

1512
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:20,640
have such an ability to abstract um as
 

1513
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,149
have such an ability to abstract um as
humans because we are so gigantic that

1514
00:29:23,149 --> 00:29:23,159
humans because we are so gigantic that
 

1515
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:25,029
humans because we are so gigantic that
like the space that we can go back into

1516
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:25,039
like the space that we can go back into
 

1517
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,750
like the space that we can go back into
is really large so like the more

1518
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:26,760
is really large so like the more
 

1519
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,389
is really large so like the more
abstract you're going like the you're

1520
00:29:28,389 --> 00:29:28,399
abstract you're going like the you're
 

1521
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,389
abstract you're going like the you're
going in that space But in that sense

1522
00:29:30,389 --> 00:29:30,399
going in that space But in that sense
 

1523
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,389
going in that space But in that sense
aren't we fundamentally all connected

1524
00:29:33,389 --> 00:29:33,399
aren't we fundamentally all connected
 

1525
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:35,509
aren't we fundamentally all connected
yes and this is why the the definition

1526
00:29:35,509 --> 00:29:35,519
yes and this is why the the definition
 

1527
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:37,190
yes and this is why the the definition
of Life cannot be the individual it has

1528
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:37,200
of Life cannot be the individual it has
 

1529
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,789
of Life cannot be the individual it has
to be these lineages because they're all

1530
00:29:38,789 --> 00:29:38,799
to be these lineages because they're all
 

1531
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,149
to be these lineages because they're all
connected they're interwoven and they're

1532
00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:40,159
connected they're interwoven and they're
 

1533
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,509
connected they're interwoven and they're
exchanging Parts all the time yeah so

1534
00:29:42,509 --> 00:29:42,519
exchanging Parts all the time yeah so
 

1535
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:44,230
exchanging Parts all the time yeah so
maybe there's certain aspects of those

1536
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:44,240
maybe there's certain aspects of those
 

1537
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,470
maybe there's certain aspects of those
lineages that can be lifelike they can

1538
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:47,480
lineages that can be lifelike they can
 

1539
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,990
lineages that can be lifelike they can
be characteristics that can be measured

1540
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:49,000
be characteristics that can be measured
 

1541
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,310
be characteristics that can be measured
like with the sun theory that have more

1542
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:51,320
like with the sun theory that have more
 

1543
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,990
like with the sun theory that have more
or less life but they're all just

1544
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:53,000
or less life but they're all just
 

1545
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,470
or less life but they're all just
fingertips of

1546
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:54,480
fingertips of
 

1547
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,149
fingertips of
a of a much bigger object yeah I think

1548
00:29:58,149 --> 00:29:58,159
a of a much bigger object yeah I think
 

1549
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,230
a of a much bigger object yeah I think
is very high dimensional and in fact I

1550
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:00,240
is very high dimensional and in fact I
 

1551
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,750
is very high dimensional and in fact I
think you can be alive in some

1552
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:01,760
think you can be alive in some
 

1553
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,669
think you can be alive in some
dimensions and and not in others like if

1554
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:04,679
dimensions and and not in others like if
 

1555
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:06,630
dimensions and and not in others like if
you could if you could project all the

1556
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:06,640
you could if you could project all the
 

1557
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,190
you could if you could project all the
causation that's in you in some in some

1558
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:09,200
causation that's in you in some in some
 

1559
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,230
causation that's in you in some in some
features of you you know very little

1560
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:11,240
features of you you know very little
 

1561
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,149
features of you you know very little
causation is required and like very

1562
00:30:13,149 --> 00:30:13,159
causation is required and like very
 

1563
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:15,549
causation is required and like very
little history and in some features a

1564
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:15,559
little history and in some features a
 

1565
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:18,990
little history and in some features a
lot is so it's quite difficult to take

1566
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:19,000
lot is so it's quite difficult to take
 

1567
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,350
lot is so it's quite difficult to take
this really

1568
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:20,360
this really
 

1569
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,509
this really
high-dimensional uh very deep structure

1570
00:30:23,509 --> 00:30:23,519
high-dimensional uh very deep structure
 

1571
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:25,669
high-dimensional uh very deep structure
and project it into things that we

1572
00:30:25,669 --> 00:30:25,679
and project it into things that we
 

1573
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,430
and project it into things that we
really can understand and say like this

1574
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:27,440
really can understand and say like this
 

1575
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,430
really can understand and say like this
is the one thing um that we're seeing

1576
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:31,440
is the one thing um that we're seeing
 

1577
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,870
is the one thing um that we're seeing
because it's not one thing it's funny

1578
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:33,880
because it's not one thing it's funny
 

1579
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,470
because it's not one thing it's funny
we're talking about this now and I'm

1580
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:35,480
we're talking about this now and I'm
 

1581
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,549
we're talking about this now and I'm
slowly starting to realize one of the

1582
00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:37,559
slowly starting to realize one of the
 

1583
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:40,070
slowly starting to realize one of the
things I saw when I took

1584
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:40,080
things I saw when I took
 

1585
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,070
things I saw when I took
iwasa afterwards actually so the actual

1586
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:43,080
iwasa afterwards actually so the actual
 

1587
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,630
iwasa afterwards actually so the actual
ceremony is 4 five hours but afterwards

1588
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:45,640
ceremony is 4 five hours but afterwards
 

1589
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,470
ceremony is 4 five hours but afterwards
you're still riding whatever the thing

1590
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:48,480
you're still riding whatever the thing
 

1591
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,549
you're still riding whatever the thing
that you're riding and I got a chance to

1592
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:52,559
that you're riding and I got a chance to
 

1593
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,669
that you're riding and I got a chance to
um afterwards hang out with some friends

1594
00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:54,679
um afterwards hang out with some friends
 

1595
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:56,830
um afterwards hang out with some friends
and just shoot the shit in the you know

1596
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:56,840
and just shoot the shit in the you know
 

1597
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,549
and just shoot the shit in the you know
in the forest

1598
00:30:58,549 --> 00:30:58,559
in the forest
 

1599
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,750
in the forest
and I get to see their

1600
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:00,760
and I get to see their
 

1601
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,509
and I get to see their
faces and what was happening with their

1602
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:03,519
faces and what was happening with their
 

1603
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,269
faces and what was happening with their
faces and their hair is I would get this

1604
00:31:06,269 --> 00:31:06,279
faces and their hair is I would get this
 

1605
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:07,549
faces and their hair is I would get this
interesting effect first of all

1606
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:07,559
interesting effect first of all
 

1607
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:10,110
interesting effect first of all
everything was beautiful and and I just

1608
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:10,120
everything was beautiful and and I just
 

1609
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,389
everything was beautiful and and I just
had so much love for everybody

1610
00:31:13,389 --> 00:31:13,399
had so much love for everybody
 

1611
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:17,029
had so much love for everybody
but I could see their past selves like

1612
00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:17,039
but I could see their past selves like
 

1613
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,830
but I could see their past selves like
behind them it was this effect where um

1614
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:20,840
behind them it was this effect where um
 

1615
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,789
behind them it was this effect where um
I guess it's a blurring effect of where

1616
00:31:23,789 --> 00:31:23,799
I guess it's a blurring effect of where
 

1617
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:27,269
I guess it's a blurring effect of where
like if I move like this the faces that

1618
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:27,279
like if I move like this the faces that
 

1619
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,430
like if I move like this the faces that
were just there are still there and it

1620
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:29,440
were just there are still there and it
 

1621
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,389
were just there are still there and it
would just float like this these uh

1622
00:31:33,389 --> 00:31:33,399
would just float like this these uh
 

1623
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:35,230
would just float like this these uh
behind them which will create this

1624
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:35,240
behind them which will create this
 

1625
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,990
behind them which will create this
incredible effect but it's also another

1626
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:37,000
incredible effect but it's also another
 

1627
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,509
incredible effect but it's also another
way to think about that is I'm

1628
00:31:39,509 --> 00:31:39,519
way to think about that is I'm
 

1629
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,870
way to think about that is I'm
visualizing a little bit of that object

1630
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:42,880
visualizing a little bit of that object
 

1631
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,389
visualizing a little bit of that object
of the thing they wore just a few

1632
00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:44,399
of the thing they wore just a few
 

1633
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,149
of the thing they wore just a few
seconds ago it's a cool little effect

1634
00:31:47,149 --> 00:31:47,159
seconds ago it's a cool little effect
 

1635
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:49,389
seconds ago it's a cool little effect
very cool and now it's like uh giving it

1636
00:31:49,389 --> 00:31:49,399
very cool and now it's like uh giving it
 

1637
00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:52,029
very cool and now it's like uh giving it
a bit more profundity to to the effect

1638
00:31:52,029 --> 00:31:52,039
a bit more profundity to to the effect
 

1639
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:54,310
a bit more profundity to to the effect
that was just beautiful aesthetically

1640
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:54,320
that was just beautiful aesthetically
 

1641
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,990
that was just beautiful aesthetically
but it's

1642
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:56,000
but it's
 

1643
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,509
but it's
also beautiful from from a physics

1644
00:31:58,509 --> 00:31:58,519
also beautiful from from a physics
 

1645
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:00,710
also beautiful from from a physics
perspective because that is a past self

1646
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:00,720
perspective because that is a past self
 

1647
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,549
perspective because that is a past self
I get a little Glimpse at the past self

1648
00:32:03,549 --> 00:32:03,559
I get a little Glimpse at the past self
 

1649
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:06,629
I get a little Glimpse at the past self
that they they were but then you take

1650
00:32:06,629 --> 00:32:06,639
that they they were but then you take
 

1651
00:32:06,639 --> 00:32:10,110
that they they were but then you take
that to its natural conclusion not just

1652
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:10,120
that to its natural conclusion not just
 

1653
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,470
that to its natural conclusion not just
a few seconds ago but just to the

1654
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:12,480
a few seconds ago but just to the
 

1655
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,990
a few seconds ago but just to the
beginning of the universe and you can

1656
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:14,000
beginning of the universe and you can
 

1657
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,509
beginning of the universe and you can
probably years get down that lineage

1658
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:17,519
probably years get down that lineage
 

1659
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,909
probably years get down that lineage
it's crazy that there's billions of

1660
00:32:18,909 --> 00:32:18,919
it's crazy that there's billions of
 

1661
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:21,789
it's crazy that there's billions of
years inside all of us all of us yeah

1662
00:32:21,789 --> 00:32:21,799
years inside all of us all of us yeah
 

1663
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:24,389
years inside all of us all of us yeah
and then we connect obviously not too uh

1664
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:24,399
and then we connect obviously not too uh
 

1665
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,389
and then we connect obviously not too uh
not too long ago yeah uh you you

1666
00:32:27,389 --> 00:32:27,399
not too long ago yeah uh you you
 

1667
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:29,509
not too long ago yeah uh you you
mentioned the technosphere and you also

1668
00:32:29,509 --> 00:32:29,519
mentioned the technosphere and you also
 

1669
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,430
mentioned the technosphere and you also
wrote that the most alive thing on this

1670
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:31,440
wrote that the most alive thing on this
 

1671
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,430
wrote that the most alive thing on this
planet is our technosphere yeah why is

1672
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:34,440
planet is our technosphere yeah why is
 

1673
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,389
planet is our technosphere yeah why is
the technology we create a kind of life

1674
00:32:36,389 --> 00:32:36,399
the technology we create a kind of life
 

1675
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,549
the technology we create a kind of life
form why do you why are you seeing it as

1676
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:38,559
form why do you why are you seeing it as
 

1677
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,750
form why do you why are you seeing it as
life because it's creative but with us

1678
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:41,760
life because it's creative but with us
 

1679
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,590
life because it's creative but with us
obviously like not independently of us

1680
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:43,600
obviously like not independently of us
 

1681
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,629
obviously like not independently of us
and also because of this sort of lineage

1682
00:32:45,629 --> 00:32:45,639
and also because of this sort of lineage
 

1683
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:48,149
and also because of this sort of lineage
view of life and I I think about life

1684
00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:48,159
view of life and I I think about life
 

1685
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,629
view of life and I I think about life
often as a planetary scale phenomena

1686
00:32:50,629 --> 00:32:50,639
often as a planetary scale phenomena
 

1687
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:51,590
often as a planetary scale phenomena
because that's sort of the natural

1688
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:51,600
because that's sort of the natural
 

1689
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,029
because that's sort of the natural
boundary for all of this causation

1690
00:32:54,029 --> 00:32:54,039
boundary for all of this causation
 

1691
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:56,549
boundary for all of this causation
that's bundled in every object in our

1692
00:32:56,549 --> 00:32:56,559
that's bundled in every object in our
 

1693
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,310
that's bundled in every object in our
biosphere

1694
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:58,320
biosphere
 

1695
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,629
biosphere
and so for me it's just sort of the

1696
00:33:01,629 --> 00:33:01,639
and so for me it's just sort of the
 

1697
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:05,149
and so for me it's just sort of the
current boundary of how far life on our

1698
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:05,159
current boundary of how far life on our
 

1699
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:08,029
current boundary of how far life on our
planet has pushed into the things that

1700
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:08,039
planet has pushed into the things that
 

1701
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:09,350
planet has pushed into the things that
our universe can

1702
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:09,360
our universe can
 

1703
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,389
our universe can
generate and so it's the furthest thing

1704
00:33:12,389 --> 00:33:12,399
generate and so it's the furthest thing
 

1705
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,549
generate and so it's the furthest thing
it's the biggest thing um and I think a

1706
00:33:14,549 --> 00:33:14,559
it's the biggest thing um and I think a
 

1707
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,070
it's the biggest thing um and I think a
lot about the nature of Life across

1708
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:17,080
lot about the nature of Life across
 

1709
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,950
lot about the nature of Life across
different scales and so uh you know we

1710
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:19,960
different scales and so uh you know we
 

1711
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,029
different scales and so uh you know we
have cells inside of us that are alive

1712
00:33:23,029 --> 00:33:23,039
have cells inside of us that are alive
 

1713
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,909
have cells inside of us that are alive
and we feel like we're alive but we

1714
00:33:24,909 --> 00:33:24,919
and we feel like we're alive but we
 

1715
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:26,750
and we feel like we're alive but we
don't often think about the societies

1716
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:26,760
don't often think about the societies
 

1717
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,350
don't often think about the societies
that we're embedded in

1718
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:28,360
that we're embedded in
 

1719
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,430
that we're embedded in
as alive or a global scale organization

1720
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:32,440
as alive or a global scale organization
 

1721
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,389
as alive or a global scale organization
of us and our technology on the planet

1722
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:34,399
of us and our technology on the planet
 

1723
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:38,750
of us and our technology on the planet
as alive um but I think if you have this

1724
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:38,760
as alive um but I think if you have this
 

1725
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,870
as alive um but I think if you have this
uh deeper view into the nature of Life

1726
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:41,880
uh deeper view into the nature of Life
 

1727
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,310
uh deeper view into the nature of Life
uh which I think is necessary also to

1728
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:43,320
uh which I think is necessary also to
 

1729
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,470
uh which I think is necessary also to
solve the original life then you have to

1730
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:45,480
solve the original life then you have to
 

1731
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,230
solve the original life then you have to
include those things all of them you

1732
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:48,240
include those things all of them you
 

1733
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,950
include those things all of them you
have to simultaneously think about life

1734
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:50,960
have to simultaneously think about life
 

1735
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,470
have to simultaneously think about life
at every single scale the planetary and

1736
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:53,480
at every single scale the planetary and
 

1737
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,029
at every single scale the planetary and
the bacteria level yeah this is the hard

1738
00:33:57,029 --> 00:33:57,039
the bacteria level yeah this is the hard
 

1739
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,629
the bacteria level yeah this is the hard
thing about solving the problem of life

1740
00:33:58,629 --> 00:33:58,639
thing about solving the problem of life
 

1741
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:00,789
thing about solving the problem of life
I think is how many things you have to

1742
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:00,799
I think is how many things you have to
 

1743
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,269
I think is how many things you have to
integrate into building a sort of a a a

1744
00:34:04,269 --> 00:34:04,279
integrate into building a sort of a a a
 

1745
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:06,149
integrate into building a sort of a a a
unified picture of this thing that we

1746
00:34:06,149 --> 00:34:06,159
unified picture of this thing that we
 

1747
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:07,830
unified picture of this thing that we
want to call life and and a lot of our

1748
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:07,840
want to call life and and a lot of our
 

1749
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,909
want to call life and and a lot of our
theories of physics are built on um

1750
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:11,919
theories of physics are built on um
 

1751
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:14,750
theories of physics are built on um
building deep regularities that explain

1752
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:14,760
building deep regularities that explain
 

1753
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,750
building deep regularities that explain
a really broad class of phenomena and I

1754
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:16,760
a really broad class of phenomena and I
 

1755
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,909
a really broad class of phenomena and I
think we haven't really traditionally

1756
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:17,919
think we haven't really traditionally
 

1757
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:20,589
think we haven't really traditionally
thought about life that way uh but I

1758
00:34:20,589 --> 00:34:20,599
thought about life that way uh but I
 

1759
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:22,510
thought about life that way uh but I
think to get it at some of these hardest

1760
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:22,520
think to get it at some of these hardest
 

1761
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,069
think to get it at some of these hardest
questions like looking for life on other

1762
00:34:24,069 --> 00:34:24,079
questions like looking for life on other
 

1763
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,669
questions like looking for life on other
planets or the original life you really

1764
00:34:25,669 --> 00:34:25,679
planets or the original life you really
 

1765
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,510
planets or the original life you really
have to think about it that way and so

1766
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:27,520
have to think about it that way and so
 

1767
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,149
have to think about it that way and so
most most of like my professional work

1768
00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:30,159
most most of like my professional work
 

1769
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,550
most most of like my professional work
is just trying to understand like every

1770
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:32,560
is just trying to understand like every
 

1771
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,149
is just trying to understand like every
single thing on this planet that might

1772
00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:34,159
single thing on this planet that might
 

1773
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,589
single thing on this planet that might
be an example of life which is pretty

1774
00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:35,599
be an example of life which is pretty
 

1775
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,030
be an example of life which is pretty
much everything and then trying to

1776
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:37,040
much everything and then trying to
 

1777
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,230
much everything and then trying to
figure out like what's the deeper

1778
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:38,240
figure out like what's the deeper
 

1779
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,829
figure out like what's the deeper
structure underlying that yeah shinger

1780
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:40,839
structure underlying that yeah shinger
 

1781
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:43,109
structure underlying that yeah shinger
wrote that living matter while not

1782
00:34:43,109 --> 00:34:43,119
wrote that living matter while not
 

1783
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,669
wrote that living matter while not
alluding the laws of physics as

1784
00:34:44,669 --> 00:34:44,679
alluding the laws of physics as
 

1785
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,990
alluding the laws of physics as
established up to date is likely to

1786
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:47,000
established up to date is likely to
 

1787
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,149
established up to date is likely to
involve other laws of physics hether to

1788
00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:51,159
involve other laws of physics hether to
 

1789
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:55,950
involve other laws of physics hether to
unknown so to him I love that quote

1790
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:55,960
unknown so to him I love that quote
 

1791
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,069
unknown so to him I love that quote
there was a

1792
00:34:58,069 --> 00:34:58,079
there was a
 

1793
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,349
there was a
that at the bottom of this are new laws

1794
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:00,359
that at the bottom of this are new laws
 

1795
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:03,230
that at the bottom of this are new laws
of physics that could explain this thing

1796
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:03,240
of physics that could explain this thing
 

1797
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,990
of physics that could explain this thing
that we call Life yeah short really

1798
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:06,000
that we call Life yeah short really
 

1799
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,150
that we call Life yeah short really
tried to do what physicists try to do uh

1800
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:10,160
tried to do what physicists try to do uh
 

1801
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,109
tried to do what physicists try to do uh
which is explain things um and he his

1802
00:35:14,109 --> 00:35:14,119
which is explain things um and he his
 

1803
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:17,510
which is explain things um and he his
attempt was to try to explain life in

1804
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:17,520
attempt was to try to explain life in
 

1805
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,030
attempt was to try to explain life in
terms of non-equilibrium physics because

1806
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:21,040
terms of non-equilibrium physics because
 

1807
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,630
terms of non-equilibrium physics because
he thought that was the best description

1808
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:23,640
he thought that was the best description
 

1809
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,109
he thought that was the best description
that we could generate at the time and

1810
00:35:26,109 --> 00:35:26,119
that we could generate at the time and
 

1811
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:27,670
that we could generate at the time and
so he did come up with something really

1812
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:27,680
so he did come up with something really
 

1813
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,030
so he did come up with something really
ightful which was to predict the

1814
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:30,040
ightful which was to predict the
 

1815
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,550
ightful which was to predict the
structure of DNA as an AP periodic

1816
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:32,560
structure of DNA as an AP periodic
 

1817
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,510
structure of DNA as an AP periodic
Crystal um and that was for a very

1818
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:34,520
Crystal um and that was for a very
 

1819
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,550
Crystal um and that was for a very
precise Reas reason that you know that

1820
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:36,560
precise Reas reason that you know that
 

1821
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,030
precise Reas reason that you know that
was the only kind of physical structure

1822
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:38,040
was the only kind of physical structure
 

1823
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,950
was the only kind of physical structure
that could encode enough information to

1824
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:39,960
that could encode enough information to
 

1825
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,230
that could encode enough information to
actually specify a cell we knew some

1826
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:42,240
actually specify a cell we knew some
 

1827
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,670
actually specify a cell we knew some
things about genes but not about DNA and

1828
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:44,680
things about genes but not about DNA and
 

1829
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,150
things about genes but not about DNA and
its actual structure when he proposed

1830
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:47,160
its actual structure when he proposed
 

1831
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,069
its actual structure when he proposed
that but in the book he tried to explain

1832
00:35:50,069 --> 00:35:50,079
that but in the book he tried to explain
 

1833
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,190
that but in the book he tried to explain
life is kind of going against entropy

1834
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:53,200
life is kind of going against entropy
 

1835
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,230
life is kind of going against entropy
and so some people have talked about it

1836
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:54,240
and so some people have talked about it
 

1837
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,870
and so some people have talked about it
as like Schrodinger's Paradox how can

1838
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:55,880
as like Schrodinger's Paradox how can
 

1839
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,069
as like Schrodinger's Paradox how can
life persist when the second law of

1840
00:35:57,069 --> 00:35:57,079
life persist when the second law of
 

1841
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:00,390
life persist when the second law of
thermodynamic is there um but in open

1842
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:00,400
thermodynamic is there um but in open
 

1843
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,470
thermodynamic is there um but in open
systems that's not so problematic and

1844
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:02,480
systems that's not so problematic and
 

1845
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,109
systems that's not so problematic and
really the question is why can life

1846
00:36:05,109 --> 00:36:05,119
really the question is why can life
 

1847
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,750
really the question is why can life
generate so much order and we don't have

1848
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:07,760
generate so much order and we don't have
 

1849
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,710
generate so much order and we don't have
a physics to describe that and it's

1850
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:10,720
a physics to describe that and it's
 

1851
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,829
a physics to describe that and it's
interesting you know generations of

1852
00:36:12,829 --> 00:36:12,839
interesting you know generations of
 

1853
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:14,270
interesting you know generations of
physicists have thought about this

1854
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:14,280
physicists have thought about this
 

1855
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,349
physicists have thought about this
problem oftentimes it's like when people

1856
00:36:16,349 --> 00:36:16,359
problem oftentimes it's like when people
 

1857
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:18,150
problem oftentimes it's like when people
are retiring they're like oh now I can

1858
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:18,160
are retiring they're like oh now I can
 

1859
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,710
are retiring they're like oh now I can
work on life uh or they're like more

1860
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:20,720
work on life uh or they're like more
 

1861
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,790
work on life uh or they're like more
senior in their career and they worked

1862
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:21,800
senior in their career and they worked
 

1863
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,630
senior in their career and they worked
on other more traditional problems and

1864
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:23,640
on other more traditional problems and
 

1865
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,390
on other more traditional problems and
there's still a lot of impetus um in the

1866
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:25,400
there's still a lot of impetus um in the
 

1867
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,589
there's still a lot of impetus um in the
physics Community to think that n

1868
00:36:27,589 --> 00:36:27,599
physics Community to think that n
 

1869
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,349
physics Community to think that n
equilibrium physics will explain life

1870
00:36:29,349 --> 00:36:29,359
equilibrium physics will explain life
 

1871
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:31,470
equilibrium physics will explain life
but I I think that's not the right

1872
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:31,480
but I I think that's not the right
 

1873
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,829
but I I think that's not the right
approach uh I don't think ultimately the

1874
00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:33,839
approach uh I don't think ultimately the
 

1875
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,550
approach uh I don't think ultimately the
solution to what life is is there and I

1876
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:35,560
solution to what life is is there and I
 

1877
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,829
solution to what life is is there and I
don't really think entropy has much to

1878
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:38,839
don't really think entropy has much to
 

1879
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:40,990
don't really think entropy has much to
do with it unless it's entirely

1880
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:41,000
do with it unless it's entirely
 

1881
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,750
do with it unless it's entirely
reformulated well because you have to

1882
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:42,760
reformulated well because you have to
 

1883
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,309
reformulated well because you have to
explain how interesting order how

1884
00:36:44,309 --> 00:36:44,319
explain how interesting order how
 

1885
00:36:44,319 --> 00:36:47,990
explain how interesting order how
complexity emerges from the soup yes

1886
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:48,000

hardly even acknowledges that the

00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:53,800
hardly even acknowledges that the

like to think we live in a deterministic

1896
00:36:58,990 --> 00:36:59,000
like to think we live in a deterministic
 

1897
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,630
like to think we live in a deterministic
universe and everything's deterministic

1898
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:00,640
universe and everything's deterministic
 

1899
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,430
universe and everything's deterministic
but I think that's probably uh you know

1900
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:03,440
but I think that's probably uh you know
 

1901
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,349
but I think that's probably uh you know
an artifact of the way that we've

1902
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:05,359
an artifact of the way that we've
 

1903
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,309
an artifact of the way that we've
written down laws of physics since

1904
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:07,319
written down laws of physics since
 

1905
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:10,670
written down laws of physics since
Newton invented modern physics uh in his

1906
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:10,680
Newton invented modern physics uh in his
 

1907
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,829
Newton invented modern physics uh in his
conception of motion and gravity which

1908
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:12,839
conception of motion and gravity which
 

1909
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:15,790
conception of motion and gravity which
you know he he formulated laws that had

1910
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:15,800
you know he he formulated laws that had
 

1911
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,670
you know he he formulated laws that had
initial conditions and um fixed

1912
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:19,680
initial conditions and um fixed
 

1913
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,710
initial conditions and um fixed
dynamical laws and that's been sort of

1914
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:22,720
dynamical laws and that's been sort of
 

1915
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,710
dynamical laws and that's been sort of
become the standard Canon of how people

1916
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:24,720
become the standard Canon of how people
 

1917
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,190
become the standard Canon of how people
think the universe works and how we need

1918
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:26,200
think the universe works and how we need
 

1919
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,030
think the universe works and how we need
to describe any physical system is with

1920
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:28,040
to describe any physical system is with
 

1921
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,630
to describe any physical system is with
an initial condition and a law of motion

1922
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:30,640
an initial condition and a law of motion
 

1923
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,030
an initial condition and a law of motion
and I think that's not actually the way

1924
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:33,040
and I think that's not actually the way
 

1925
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,910
and I think that's not actually the way
the universe really works I think it's a

1926
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:34,920
the universe really works I think it's a
 

1927
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,430
the universe really works I think it's a
good approximation for the kind of

00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:36,440
good approximation for the kind of
 

1929
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,109
good approximation for the kind of
systems that physicists have studied so

1930
00:37:38,109 --> 00:37:38,119
systems that physicists have studied so
 

1931
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:40,950
systems that physicists have studied so
far and I think it will radically fail

1932
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:40,960
far and I think it will radically fail
 

1933
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,069
far and I think it will radically fail
um in the long term at describing

1934
00:37:44,069 --> 00:37:44,079
um in the long term at describing
 

1935
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,550
um in the long term at describing
reality at its more basal levels not I'm

1936
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:48,560
reality at its more basal levels not I'm
 

1937
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,910
reality at its more basal levels not I'm
not saying there's a base I don't think

1938
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:49,920
not saying there's a base I don't think
 

1939
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,829
not saying there's a base I don't think
that reality has a ground and I don't

1940
00:37:51,829 --> 00:37:51,839
that reality has a ground and I don't
 

1941
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,790
that reality has a ground and I don't
think there's a theory of everything but

1942
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:53,800
think there's a theory of everything but
 

1943
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,510
think there's a theory of everything but
I think there are better theories and I

1944
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:55,520
I think there are better theories and I
 

1945
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,950
I think there are better theories and I
think there are more explanatory

1946
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:56,960
think there are more explanatory
 

1947
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,150
think there are more explanatory
theories and I think we can get to

1948
00:37:59,150 --> 00:37:59,160
theories and I think we can get to
 

1949
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,670
theories and I think we can get to
Something that explains much more than

1950
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:00,680
Something that explains much more than
 

1951
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,390
Something that explains much more than
the current laws of physics do when you

1952
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:02,400
the current laws of physics do when you
 

1953
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,109
the current laws of physics do when you
say Theory of Everything you mean like

1954
00:38:04,109 --> 00:38:04,119
say Theory of Everything you mean like
 

1955
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:06,349
say Theory of Everything you mean like
everything everything yeah yeah you know

1956
00:38:06,349 --> 00:38:06,359
everything everything yeah yeah you know
 

1957
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:08,109
everything everything yeah yeah you know
like in in physics right now it's really

1958
00:38:08,109 --> 00:38:08,119
like in in physics right now it's really
 

1959
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,430
like in in physics right now it's really
popular to talk about theories of

1960
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:09,440
popular to talk about theories of
 

1961
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,750
popular to talk about theories of
everything so string theory is supposed

1962
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:10,760
everything so string theory is supposed
 

1963
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,870
everything so string theory is supposed
to be a theory of everything because it

1964
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:11,880
to be a theory of everything because it
 

1965
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,910
to be a theory of everything because it
unifies quantum mechanics and gravity um

1966
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:14,920
unifies quantum mechanics and gravity um
 

1967
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,589
unifies quantum mechanics and gravity um
and you know people have their different

1968
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:17,599
and you know people have their different
 

1969
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,950
and you know people have their different
pet theories of everything and and the

1970
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:19,960
pet theories of everything and and the
 

1971
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,510
pet theories of everything and and the
challenge with a theory of everything I

1972
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:21,520
challenge with a theory of everything I
 

1973
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,950
challenge with a theory of everything I
really love this qu quote from David

1974
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:22,960
really love this qu quote from David
 

1975
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,710
really love this qu quote from David
crack hour which is a Theory of

1976
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:24,720
crack hour which is a Theory of
 

1977
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,190
crack hour which is a Theory of
Everything is a theory of everything

1978
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:26,200
Everything is a theory of everything
 

1979
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,109
Everything is a theory of everything
except those things that theorize oh you

1980
00:38:28,109 --> 00:38:28,119
except those things that theorize oh you
 

1981
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:30,030
except those things that theorize oh you
meaning removing the Observer from the

1982
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:30,040
meaning removing the Observer from the
 

1983
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,349
meaning removing the Observer from the
thing yeah but it's also it's also weird

1984
00:38:32,349 --> 00:38:32,359
thing yeah but it's also it's also weird
 

1985
00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:33,950
thing yeah but it's also it's also weird
because if a theory of everything

1986
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:33,960
because if a theory of everything
 

1987
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,309
because if a theory of everything
explained everything it should also

1988
00:38:35,309 --> 00:38:35,319
explained everything it should also
 

1989
00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:37,109
explained everything it should also
explain the theory so the theory has to

1990
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:37,119
explain the theory so the theory has to
 

1991
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,670
explain the theory so the theory has to
be recursive and none of our theories of

1992
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:39,680
be recursive and none of our theories of
 

1993
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,390
be recursive and none of our theories of
physics are recursive so it's just a

1994
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:42,400
physics are recursive so it's just a
 

1995
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,470
physics are recursive so it's just a
it's a it's a weird concept yeah but

1996
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:44,480
it's a it's a weird concept yeah but
 

1997
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,910
it's a it's a weird concept yeah but
it's very difficult to integrate The

1998
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:45,920
it's very difficult to integrate The
 

1999
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,870
it's very difficult to integrate The
Observer into a theory I don't think so

2000
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:48,880
Observer into a theory I don't think so
 

2001
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,109
Observer into a theory I don't think so
I think you can build a theory

2002
00:38:50,109 --> 00:38:50,119
I think you can build a theory
 

2003
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,510
I think you can build a theory
acknowledging that you're an observer

2004
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:51,520
acknowledging that you're an observer
 

2005
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,470
acknowledging that you're an observer
inside the universe but doesn't it

2006
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:53,480
inside the universe but doesn't it
 

2007
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,030
inside the universe but doesn't it
become recursive in that way and that's

2008
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:56,040
become recursive in that way and that's
 

2009
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,190
become recursive in that way and that's
you're saying it's possible to make a

2010
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:58,200
you're saying it's possible to make a
 

2011
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,069
you're saying it's possible to make a
Theory that's okay with that I think so

2012
00:39:01,069 --> 00:39:01,079
Theory that's okay with that I think so
 

2013
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:02,550
Theory that's okay with that I think so
I mean I don't think there's always

2014
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:02,560
I mean I don't think there's always
 

2015
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,870
I mean I don't think there's always
going to be um the Paradox of another

2016
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:05,880
going to be um the Paradox of another
 

2017
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,510
going to be um the Paradox of another
meta level you could build on the The

2018
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:07,520
meta level you could build on the The
 

2019
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,190
meta level you could build on the The
Meta level right so like if you assume

2020
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:09,200
Meta level right so like if you assume
 

2021
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,670
Meta level right so like if you assume
this is your universe and you're the

2022
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:10,680
this is your universe and you're the
 

2023
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,589
this is your universe and you're the
Observer outside of it you have some

2024
00:39:12,589 --> 00:39:12,599
Observer outside of it you have some
 

2025
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:14,309
Observer outside of it you have some
meta description of that universe but

2026
00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:14,319
meta description of that universe but
 

2027
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:15,750
meta description of that universe but
then you need a metad description of you

2028
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:15,760
then you need a metad description of you
 

2029
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,309
then you need a metad description of you
describing that Universe right so uh you

2030
00:39:18,309 --> 00:39:18,319
describing that Universe right so uh you
 

2031
00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:20,550
describing that Universe right so uh you
know this is one of the biggest

2032
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:20,560
know this is one of the biggest
 

2033
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,870
know this is one of the biggest
challenges that we face um being

2034
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:22,880
challenges that we face um being
 

2035
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,150
challenges that we face um being
observers inside our universe and also

2036
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:25,160
observers inside our universe and also
 

2037
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,630
observers inside our universe and also
you know why the paradoxes and the

2038
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:26,640
you know why the paradoxes and the
 

2039
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,589
you know why the paradoxes and the
foundations of mathematics and any place

2040
00:39:28,589 --> 00:39:28,599
foundations of mathematics and any place
 

2041
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:31,150
foundations of mathematics and any place
that we try to have observers in the

2042
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:31,160
that we try to have observers in the
 

2043
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,870
that we try to have observers in the
system or a system describing itself uh

2044
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:33,880
system or a system describing itself uh
 

2045
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,750
system or a system describing itself uh
show up um but I think it is possible to

2046
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:36,760
show up um but I think it is possible to
 

2047
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,430
show up um but I think it is possible to
build a physics that builds in those

2048
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:39,440
build a physics that builds in those
 

2049
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,069
build a physics that builds in those
things intrinsically without having them

2050
00:39:41,069 --> 00:39:41,079
things intrinsically without having them
 

2051
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:44,030
things intrinsically without having them
be paradoxical or have holes in the

2052
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:44,040
be paradoxical or have holes in the
 

2053
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,829
be paradoxical or have holes in the
descriptions um and so one one place I

2054
00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:47,839
descriptions um and so one one place I
 

2055
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,390
descriptions um and so one one place I
think about this quite a lot which I

2056
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:49,400
think about this quite a lot which I
 

2057
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,630
think about this quite a lot which I
think can give you sort of a more

2058
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:50,640
think can give you sort of a more
 

2059
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,710
think can give you sort of a more
concrete example is is the nature of

2060
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:52,720
concrete example is is the nature of
 

2061
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,030
concrete example is is the nature of
like what we call

2062
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:54,040
like what we call
 

2063
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,589
like what we call
fundamental so uh we typically Define

2064
00:39:57,589 --> 00:39:57,599
fundamental so uh we typically Define
 

2065
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,190
fundamental so uh we typically Define
fundamental right now in terms of the

2066
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:01,200
fundamental right now in terms of the
 

2067
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,589
fundamental right now in terms of the
smallest indivisible units of matter so

2068
00:40:03,589 --> 00:40:03,599
smallest indivisible units of matter so
 

2069
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:04,670
smallest indivisible units of matter so
again you have to have a definition of

2070
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:04,680
again you have to have a definition of
 

2071
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,589
again you have to have a definition of
what you think material is and matter is

2072
00:40:06,589 --> 00:40:06,599
what you think material is and matter is
 

2073
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:08,190
what you think material is and matter is
but right now that you know what's

2074
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:08,200
but right now that you know what's
 

2075
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,109
but right now that you know what's
fundamental are Elementary particles um

2076
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:11,119
fundamental are Elementary particles um
 

2077
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,630
fundamental are Elementary particles um
and we think they're fundamental because

2078
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:12,640
and we think they're fundamental because
 

2079
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,190
and we think they're fundamental because
we can't break them apart further and

2080
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:14,200
we can't break them apart further and
 

2081
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,550
we can't break them apart further and
obviously we have theories like string

2082
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:15,560
obviously we have theories like string
 

2083
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,470
obviously we have theories like string
theory that if they're right would

2084
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:17,480
theory that if they're right would
 

2085
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,550
theory that if they're right would
replace the current description of

2086
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:19,560
replace the current description of
 

2087
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,870
replace the current description of
what's the most fundamental thing in our

2088
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:20,880
what's the most fundamental thing in our
 

2089
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,950
what's the most fundamental thing in our
universe by replacing with something

2090
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:22,960
universe by replacing with something
 

2091
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,630
universe by replacing with something
smaller um but we can't get to those

2092
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:25,640
smaller um but we can't get to those
 

2093
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,030
smaller um but we can't get to those
theories because we're technologically

2094
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:27,040
theories because we're technologically
 

2095
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,349
theories because we're technologically
Limited

2096
00:40:28,349 --> 00:40:28,359
Limited
 

2097
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:33,150
Limited
and so if you if you look at this from a

2098
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:33,160
and so if you if you look at this from a
 

2099
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,990
and so if you if you look at this from a
historical perspective and you think

2100
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:35,000
historical perspective and you think
 

2101
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,870
historical perspective and you think
about explanations

2102
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:36,880
about explanations
 

2103
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,190
about explanations
changing as physical systems like us

2104
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:41,200
changing as physical systems like us
 

2105
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,790
changing as physical systems like us
learn more about the reality in which

2106
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:42,800
learn more about the reality in which
 

2107
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,430
learn more about the reality in which
they live we once considered Adams to be

2108
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:45,440
they live we once considered Adams to be
 

2109
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,510
they live we once considered Adams to be
the most fundamental thing um and you

2110
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:48,520
the most fundamental thing um and you
 

2111
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,870
the most fundamental thing um and you
know it literally comes from the word

2112
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:49,880
know it literally comes from the word
 

2113
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,589
know it literally comes from the word
indivisible and then we realized Adams

2114
00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:51,599
indivisible and then we realized Adams
 

2115
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,470
indivisible and then we realized Adams
had substructure because we built better

2116
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:53,480
had substructure because we built better
 

2117
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,950
had substructure because we built better
technology which allowed us to quote

2118
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:54,960
technology which allowed us to quote
 

2119
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,309
technology which allowed us to quote
unquote see the world better and resolve

2120
00:40:57,309 --> 00:40:57,319
unquote see the world better and resolve
 

2121
00:40:57,319 --> 00:40:59,870
unquote see the world better and resolve
smaller features of it and then we built

2122
00:40:59,870 --> 00:40:59,880
smaller features of it and then we built
 

2123
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,950
smaller features of it and then we built
even better technology which allowed us

2124
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:01,960
even better technology which allowed us
 

2125
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,750
even better technology which allowed us
to see even smaller structure and get

2126
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:03,760
to see even smaller structure and get
 

2127
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,349
to see even smaller structure and get
down to the standard model particles and

2128
00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:06,359
down to the standard model particles and
 

2129
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:08,190
down to the standard model particles and
we think that there's might be structure

2130
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:08,200
we think that there's might be structure
 

2131
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,589
we think that there's might be structure
below that but we can't get there yet

2132
00:41:09,589 --> 00:41:09,599
below that but we can't get there yet
 

2133
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,109
below that but we can't get there yet
with our technology so what's

2134
00:41:12,109 --> 00:41:12,119
with our technology so what's
 

2135
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:15,870
with our technology so what's
fundamental the way we talk about it in

2136
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:15,880
fundamental the way we talk about it in
 

2137
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,790
fundamental the way we talk about it in
um current physics is not actually

2138
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:18,800
um current physics is not actually
 

2139
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,190
um current physics is not actually
fundamental it's the boundaries of what

2140
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:21,200
fundamental it's the boundaries of what
 

2141
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,790
fundamental it's the boundaries of what
we can observe in our universe what we

2142
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:22,800
we can observe in our universe what we
 

2143
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,109
we can observe in our universe what we
can see with our technology and so if

2144
00:41:25,109 --> 00:41:25,119
can see with our technology and so if
 

2145
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,030
can see with our technology and so if
you want to build a theory that's about

2146
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:27,040
you want to build a theory that's about
 

2147
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,109
you want to build a theory that's about
us

2148
00:41:28,109 --> 00:41:28,119
us
 

2149
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:28,870
us
and

2150
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:28,880
and
 

2151
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,950
and
about what what's inside the universe

2152
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:32,960
about what what's inside the universe
 

2153
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,390
about what what's inside the universe
that we can observe not what's at the

2154
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:34,400
that we can observe not what's at the
 

2155
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,150
that we can observe not what's at the
boundary of it um you need to talk about

2156
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:38,160
boundary of it um you need to talk about
 

2157
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,309
boundary of it um you need to talk about
objects that are in the universe that

2158
00:41:40,309 --> 00:41:40,319
objects that are in the universe that
 

2159
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,069
objects that are in the universe that
you can actually break apart to smaller

2160
00:41:42,069 --> 00:41:42,079
you can actually break apart to smaller
 

2161
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:43,670
you can actually break apart to smaller
things so I think the things that are

2162
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:43,680
things so I think the things that are
 

2163
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,270
things so I think the things that are
fundamental are actually the constructed

2164
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:45,280
fundamental are actually the constructed
 

2165
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,589
fundamental are actually the constructed
objects they're the ones that really

2166
00:41:46,589 --> 00:41:46,599
objects they're the ones that really
 

2167
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:47,950
objects they're the ones that really
exist and you really understand their

2168
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:47,960
exist and you really understand their
 

2169
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,190
exist and you really understand their
properties because you know how the

2170
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:49,200
properties because you know how the
 

2171
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,510
properties because you know how the
universe constructed them because you

2172
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:50,520
universe constructed them because you
 

2173
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,349
universe constructed them because you
can actually take them apart you can

2174
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:52,359
can actually take them apart you can
 

2175
00:41:52,359 --> 00:41:53,829
can actually take them apart you can
understand the intrinsic laws that built

2176
00:41:53,829 --> 00:41:53,839
understand the intrinsic laws that built
 

2177
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:55,750
understand the intrinsic laws that built
them but the things at the boundary are

2178
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:55,760
them but the things at the boundary are
 

2179
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,550
them but the things at the boundary are
just at the boundary they're Evol in

2180
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:57,560
just at the boundary they're Evol in
 

2181
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,990
just at the boundary they're Evol in
with us and we'll learn more about that

2182
00:41:58,990 --> 00:41:59,000
with us and we'll learn more about that
 

2183
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,270
with us and we'll learn more about that
structure as we go along but really if

2184
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:01,280
structure as we go along but really if
 

2185
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,670
structure as we go along but really if
we want to talk about what's fundamental

2186
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:02,680
we want to talk about what's fundamental
 

2187
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,030
we want to talk about what's fundamental
inside our universe we have to talk

2188
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:04,040
inside our universe we have to talk
 

2189
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,670
inside our universe we have to talk
about all these things that are

2190
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:05,680
about all these things that are
 

2191
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,750
about all these things that are
traditionally considered emergent but

2192
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:07,760
traditionally considered emergent but
 

2193
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,829
traditionally considered emergent but
really just structures in time that have

2194
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:10,839
really just structures in time that have
 

2195
00:42:10,839 --> 00:42:13,390
really just structures in time that have
causal histories that constructed them

2196
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:13,400
causal histories that constructed them
 

2197
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,030
causal histories that constructed them
and um you know are really actually what

2198
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:16,040
and um you know are really actually what
 

2199
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,710
and um you know are really actually what
our universe is about so we should focus

2200
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:18,720
our universe is about so we should focus
 

2201
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,829
our universe is about so we should focus
on the construction methodology as the

2202
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:20,839
on the construction methodology as the
 

2203
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:23,670
on the construction methodology as the
fundamental thing do you think there's a

2204
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:23,680
fundamental thing do you think there's a
 

2205
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,150
fundamental thing do you think there's a
bottom to the the smallest possible

2206
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:26,160
bottom to the the smallest possible
 

2207
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,109
bottom to the the smallest possible
thing that makes something un I don't

2208
00:42:28,109 --> 00:42:28,119
thing that makes something un I don't
 

2209
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:31,030
thing that makes something un I don't
see one and it'll take way too long

2210
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:31,040
see one and it'll take way too long
 

2211
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,230
see one and it'll take way too long
it'll take longer to find that than it

2212
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:33,240
it'll take longer to find that than it
 

2213
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,870
it'll take longer to find that than it
will to understand the mechanism that

2214
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:34,880
will to understand the mechanism that
 

2215
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,829
will to understand the mechanism that
created life I think so yeah I I think

2216
00:42:37,829 --> 00:42:37,839
created life I think so yeah I I think
 

2217
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,829
created life I think so yeah I I think
for me the frontier in modern physics

2218
00:42:40,829 --> 00:42:40,839
for me the frontier in modern physics
 

2219
00:42:40,839 --> 00:42:43,150
for me the frontier in modern physics
where the new physics lies is not in

2220
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:43,160
where the new physics lies is not in
 

2221
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,829
where the new physics lies is not in
high energy particle physics it's not in

2222
00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:44,839
high energy particle physics it's not in
 

2223
00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:47,790
high energy particle physics it's not in
quantum gravity it's not in any of these

2224
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:47,800
quantum gravity it's not in any of these
 

2225
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,150
quantum gravity it's not in any of these
sort of traditionally sold this is going

2226
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:49,160
sort of traditionally sold this is going
 

2227
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,750
sort of traditionally sold this is going
to be the newest deepest Insight we have

2228
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:50,760
to be the newest deepest Insight we have
 

2229
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,670
to be the newest deepest Insight we have
into the nature reality it is going to

2230
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:52,680
into the nature reality it is going to
 

2231
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,030
into the nature reality it is going to
be in studying the problems of life and

2232
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:55,040
be in studying the problems of life and
 

2233
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,790
be in studying the problems of life and
intelligence and the things that are

2234
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:56,800
intelligence and the things that are
 

2235
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,870
intelligence and the things that are
sort of

2236
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:57,880
sort of
 

2237
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,950
sort of
also our current existential crisis as a

2238
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:00,960
also our current existential crisis as a
 

2239
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,870
also our current existential crisis as a
civilization or a culture that's going

2240
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:03,880
civilization or a culture that's going
 

2241
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,150
civilization or a culture that's going
through uh you know an existential

2242
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:06,160
through uh you know an existential
 

2243
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,309
through uh you know an existential
trauma of inventing technologies that we

2244
00:43:08,309 --> 00:43:08,319
trauma of inventing technologies that we
 

2245
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:09,829
trauma of inventing technologies that we
don't understand right now the

2246
00:43:09,829 --> 00:43:09,839
don't understand right now the
 

2247
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:12,150
don't understand right now the
existential trauma and the terror we

2248
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:12,160
existential trauma and the terror we
 

2249
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,030
existential trauma and the terror we
feel that that technology might somehow

2250
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:14,040
feel that that technology might somehow
 

2251
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,069
feel that that technology might somehow
destroy us us meaning living intelligent

2252
00:43:17,069 --> 00:43:17,079
destroy us us meaning living intelligent
 

2253
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:19,430
destroy us us meaning living intelligent
living organisms yet we don't understand

2254
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:19,440
living organisms yet we don't understand
 

2255
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,510
living organisms yet we don't understand
what that even means well humans have

2256
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:21,520
what that even means well humans have
 

2257
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,870
what that even means well humans have
always been afraid of our Technologies

2258
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:22,880
always been afraid of our Technologies
 

2259
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,670
always been afraid of our Technologies
though right so it's kind of a

2260
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:24,680
though right so it's kind of a
 

2261
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,430
though right so it's kind of a
fascinating thing that every time we

2262
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:26,440
fascinating thing that every time we
 

2263
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,910
fascinating thing that every time we
invent something we don't understand it

2264
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:27,920
invent something we don't understand it
 

2265
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,230
invent something we don't understand it
takes us a little while to catch up with

2266
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:29,240
takes us a little while to catch up with
 

2267
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,270
takes us a little while to catch up with
it I think also in part humans kind of

2268
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:31,280
it I think also in part humans kind of
 

2269
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,670
it I think also in part humans kind of
love being afraid yeah we love being

2270
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:33,680
love being afraid yeah we love being
 

2271
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,670
love being afraid yeah we love being
traumatized it's weird we want to learn

2272
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:36,680
traumatized it's weird we want to learn
 

2273
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,910
traumatized it's weird we want to learn
more and then when we learn more it

2274
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:37,920
more and then when we learn more it
 

2275
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,990
more and then when we learn more it
traumatizes

2276
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:40,000
traumatizes
 

2277
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,069
traumatizes
us you know I never thought about it

2278
00:43:42,069 --> 00:43:42,079
us you know I never thought about it
 

2279
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,309
us you know I never thought about it
this before but I think this one of the

2280
00:43:43,309 --> 00:43:43,319
this before but I think this one of the
 

2281
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:45,069
this before but I think this one of the
reasons I love what I do is because it

2282
00:43:45,069 --> 00:43:45,079
reasons I love what I do is because it
 

2283
00:43:45,079 --> 00:43:47,710
reasons I love what I do is because it
traumatizes me all the time that sounds

2284
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:47,720
traumatizes me all the time that sounds
 

2285
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,790
traumatizes me all the time that sounds
really bad but what I mean is like I

2286
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:49,800
really bad but what I mean is like I
 

2287
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,630
really bad but what I mean is like I
love the shock of like realizing that

2288
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:52,640
love the shock of like realizing that
 

2289
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,309
love the shock of like realizing that
like coming to understand something in a

2290
00:43:54,309 --> 00:43:54,319
like coming to understand something in a
 

2291
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:56,630
like coming to understand something in a
way that you never understood it before

2292
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:56,640
way that you never understood it before
 

2293
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,829
way that you never understood it before
uh I think

2294
00:43:57,829 --> 00:43:57,839
uh I think
 

2295
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,109
uh I think
it seems to me when when I see a lot of

2296
00:44:00,109 --> 00:44:00,119
it seems to me when when I see a lot of
 

2297
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:01,750
it seems to me when when I see a lot of
the ways other people react to new ideas

2298
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:01,760
the ways other people react to new ideas
 

2299
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,670
the ways other people react to new ideas
that they don't feel that way

2300
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:02,680
that they don't feel that way
 

2301
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,710
that they don't feel that way
intrinsically but for me that's like

2302
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:04,720
intrinsically but for me that's like
 

2303
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,710
intrinsically but for me that's like
that's why I do what I do I I love I

2304
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:07,720
that's why I do what I do I I love I
 

2305
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,390
that's why I do what I do I I love I
love that feeling but you're also

2306
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:09,400
love that feeling but you're also
 

2307
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,150
love that feeling but you're also
working on a topic where it's

2308
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:12,160
working on a topic where it's
 

2309
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,670
working on a topic where it's
fundamentally ego destroying CU you're

2310
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:14,680
fundamentally ego destroying CU you're
 

2311
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:18,829
fundamentally ego destroying CU you're
talking about like life it's humbling to

2312
00:44:18,829 --> 00:44:18,839
talking about like life it's humbling to
 

2313
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:21,069
talking about like life it's humbling to
think that we're not the individual

2314
00:44:21,069 --> 00:44:21,079
think that we're not the individual
 

2315
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:24,190
think that we're not the individual
human is not special yeah and you're

2316
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:24,200
human is not special yeah and you're
 

2317
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,430
human is not special yeah and you're
like very viscerally exploring that yeah

2318
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:28,440
like very viscerally exploring that yeah
 

2319
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,230
like very viscerally exploring that yeah
I'm trying to embody that uh because you

2320
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:32,240
I'm trying to embody that uh because you
 

2321
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,870
I'm trying to embody that uh because you
I think you have to live the physics to

2322
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:33,880
I think you have to live the physics to
 

2323
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,910
I think you have to live the physics to
understand it but uh there's a great

2324
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:35,920
understand it but uh there's a great
 

2325
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,430
understand it but uh there's a great
quote about Einstein I don't know if

2326
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:37,440
quote about Einstein I don't know if
 

2327
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,710
quote about Einstein I don't know if
this is true or not that he once said

2328
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:38,720
this is true or not that he once said
 

2329
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,430
this is true or not that he once said
that he could feel light beam in his

2330
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:40,440
that he could feel light beam in his
 

2331
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:43,470
that he could feel light beam in his
belly uh and I

2332
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:43,480
belly uh and I
 

2333
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,589
belly uh and I
think but I think like you got to think

2334
00:44:45,589 --> 00:44:45,599
think but I think like you got to think
 

2335
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:46,829
think but I think like you got to think
about it though right like you're if

2336
00:44:46,829 --> 00:44:46,839
about it though right like you're if
 

2337
00:44:46,839 --> 00:44:48,230
about it though right like you're if
you're a really deep thinker and you're

2338
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:48,240
you're a really deep thinker and you're
 

2339
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,390
you're a really deep thinker and you're
really thinking about reality that

2340
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:49,400
really thinking about reality that
 

2341
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,270
really thinking about reality that
deeply and you are part of the reality

2342
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:51,280
deeply and you are part of the reality
 

2343
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,470
deeply and you are part of the reality
that you're trying to describe like you

2344
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:52,480
that you're trying to describe like you
 

2345
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,870
that you're trying to describe like you
feel it you really feel it that's what I

2346
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:54,880
feel it you really feel it that's what I
 

2347
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,390
feel it you really feel it that's what I
was saying about you always is like

2348
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:57,400
was saying about you always is like
 

2349
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,030
was saying about you always is like
walking along the cliff if you fall off

2350
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:00,040
walking along the cliff if you fall off
 

2351
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,589
walking along the cliff if you fall off
you're falling into madness yes it's a

2352
00:45:02,589 --> 00:45:02,599
you're falling into madness yes it's a
 

2353
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:05,349
you're falling into madness yes it's a
constant constant descent in Madness the

2354
00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:05,359
constant constant descent in Madness the
 

2355
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:06,990
constant constant descent in Madness the
fascinating thing about physicists and

2356
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:07,000
fascinating thing about physicists and
 

2357
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,990
fascinating thing about physicists and
Madness is that you don't know if you've

2358
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:09,000
Madness is that you don't know if you've
 

2359
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,870
Madness is that you don't know if you've
uh fallen off the cliff yeah I know you

2360
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:10,880
uh fallen off the cliff yeah I know you
 

2361
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,589
uh fallen off the cliff yeah I know you
don't know that's that's the cool thing

2362
00:45:12,589 --> 00:45:12,599
don't know that's that's the cool thing
 

2363
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:14,510
don't know that's that's the cool thing
about I rely on other people to tell me

2364
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:14,520
about I rely on other people to tell me
 

2365
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,030
about I rely on other people to tell me
actually this is very funny cuz like I

2366
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:16,040
actually this is very funny cuz like I
 

2367
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:16,990
actually this is very funny cuz like I
have these conversations with my

2368
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:17,000
have these conversations with my
 

2369
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,670
have these conversations with my
students often like they're worried

2370
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:18,680
students often like they're worried
 

2371
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,510
students often like they're worried
about going crazy and I have to

2372
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:21,520
about going crazy and I have to
 

2373
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,790
about going crazy and I have to
like reassure them that like one of the

2374
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:23,800
like reassure them that like one of the
 

2375
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,470
like reassure them that like one of the
reasons they'll stay sane is by trying

2376
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:25,480
reasons they'll stay sane is by trying
 

2377
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,430
reasons they'll stay sane is by trying
to work on concrete problems

2378
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:28,440
to work on concrete problems
 

2379
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,589
to work on concrete problems
going crazy or waking up I don't know

2380
00:45:30,589 --> 00:45:30,599
going crazy or waking up I don't know
 

2381
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:33,670
going crazy or waking up I don't know
which one which one it is yeah uh so

2382
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:33,680
which one which one it is yeah uh so
 

2383
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,750
which one which one it is yeah uh so
what do you think is the origin of life

2384
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:35,760
what do you think is the origin of life
 

2385
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,870
what do you think is the origin of life
on Earth and how can we talk about it in

2386
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:38,880
on Earth and how can we talk about it in
 

2387
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,630
on Earth and how can we talk about it in
a productive way the origin of life is

2388
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:41,640
a productive way the origin of life is
 

2389
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,829
a productive way the origin of life is
like this

2390
00:45:42,829 --> 00:45:42,839
like this
 

2391
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:46,510
like this
boundary um that the Universe can only

2392
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:46,520
boundary um that the Universe can only
 

2393
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:50,109
boundary um that the Universe can only
cross if a structure that emerges can

2394
00:45:50,109 --> 00:45:50,119
cross if a structure that emerges can
 

2395
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:52,510
cross if a structure that emerges can
reinforce its own existence which is

2396
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:52,520
reinforce its own existence which is
 

2397
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,430
reinforce its own existence which is
self- reproduction autocatalysis things

2398
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:54,440
self- reproduction autocatalysis things
 

2399
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,470
self- reproduction autocatalysis things
people traditionally talk about but it

2400
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:56,480
people traditionally talk about but it
 

2401
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,630
people traditionally talk about but it
has to be able to maintain its own

2402
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:58,640
has to be able to maintain its own
 

2403
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,270
has to be able to maintain its own
existence against this sort of

2404
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:01,280
existence against this sort of
 

2405
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,150
existence against this sort of
Randomness that happens in chemistry and

2406
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:03,160
Randomness that happens in chemistry and
 

2407
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,190
Randomness that happens in chemistry and
this Randomness that happens in the

2408
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:05,200
this Randomness that happens in the
 

2409
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,349
this Randomness that happens in the
quantum world and like it's in some

2410
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:07,359
quantum world and like it's in some
 

2411
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,630
quantum world and like it's in some
sense the emergence of like a

2412
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:08,640
sense the emergence of like a
 

2413
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,829
sense the emergence of like a
deterministic structure that says you

2414
00:46:10,829 --> 00:46:10,839
deterministic structure that says you
 

2415
00:46:10,839 --> 00:46:12,549
deterministic structure that says you
know I'm going to exist and I'm going to

2416
00:46:12,549 --> 00:46:12,559
know I'm going to exist and I'm going to
 

2417
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:15,790
know I'm going to exist and I'm going to
keep going um but uh you know pinning

2418
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:15,800
keep going um but uh you know pinning
 

2419
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,349
keep going um but uh you know pinning
that down is really hard we have ways of

2420
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:17,359
that down is really hard we have ways of
 

2421
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:18,710
that down is really hard we have ways of
thinking about it in assembly theory

2422
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:18,720
thinking about it in assembly theory
 

2423
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,109
thinking about it in assembly theory
that I think are pretty rigorous and one

2424
00:46:20,109 --> 00:46:20,119
that I think are pretty rigorous and one
 

2425
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:21,750
that I think are pretty rigorous and one
of the things I'm really excited about

2426
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:21,760
of the things I'm really excited about
 

2427
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,270
of the things I'm really excited about
is trying to actually quantify uh in an

2428
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:25,280
is trying to actually quantify uh in an
 

2429
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,030
is trying to actually quantify uh in an
assembly theoretic way when the original

2430
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:27,040
assembly theoretic way when the original
 

2431
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,230
assembly theoretic way when the original
life happens but the basic process I

2432
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:30,240
life happens but the basic process I
 

2433
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:35,270
life happens but the basic process I
have in mind is like a system that has

2434
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:35,280
have in mind is like a system that has
 

2435
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,150
have in mind is like a system that has
no causal contingency no constraints of

2436
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:38,160
no causal contingency no constraints of
 

2437
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,589
no causal contingency no constraints of
objects basically constraining the

2438
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:39,599
objects basically constraining the
 

2439
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,630
objects basically constraining the
existence of other objects or forming or

2440
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:41,640
existence of other objects or forming or
 

2441
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,230
existence of other objects or forming or
are allowing the existence of other

2442
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:44,240
are allowing the existence of other
 

2443
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,790
are allowing the existence of other
objects um and so that sounds very

2444
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:46,800
objects um and so that sounds very
 

2445
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,109
objects um and so that sounds very
abstract but like you can just think of

2446
00:46:48,109 --> 00:46:48,119
abstract but like you can just think of
 

2447
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:50,349
abstract but like you can just think of
like a chemical reaction can't happen if

2448
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:50,359
like a chemical reaction can't happen if
 

2449
00:46:50,359 --> 00:46:53,190
like a chemical reaction can't happen if
there's not a catalyst for example or a

2450
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:53,200
there's not a catalyst for example or a
 

2451
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,670
there's not a catalyst for example or a
baby can't be born if there wasn't a

2452
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:54,680
baby can't be born if there wasn't a
 

2453
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,910
baby can't be born if there wasn't a
parent um so there's a lot of causal

2454
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:56,920
parent um so there's a lot of causal
 

2455
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,510
parent um so there's a lot of causal
contingency that's necessary for certain

2456
00:46:59,510 --> 00:46:59,520
contingency that's necessary for certain
 

2457
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,349
contingency that's necessary for certain
things to happen so um you think about

2458
00:47:02,349 --> 00:47:02,359
things to happen so um you think about
 

2459
00:47:02,359 --> 00:47:05,670
things to happen so um you think about
this sort of unconstrained random system

2460
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:05,680
this sort of unconstrained random system
 

2461
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,670
this sort of unconstrained random system
there's nothing that reinforces the

2462
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:07,680
there's nothing that reinforces the
 

2463
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,589
there's nothing that reinforces the
existence of other things so so the sort

2464
00:47:10,589 --> 00:47:10,599
existence of other things so so the sort
 

2465
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:12,470
existence of other things so so the sort
of resources just get washed out in all

2466
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:12,480
of resources just get washed out in all
 

2467
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,790
of resources just get washed out in all
of these different structures and none

2468
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:13,800
of these different structures and none
 

2469
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,190
of these different structures and none
of them exist again um or they just you

2470
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:17,200
of them exist again um or they just you
 

2471
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,549
of them exist again um or they just you
know they're they're not very

2472
00:47:18,549 --> 00:47:18,559
know they're they're not very
 

2473
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:21,109
know they're they're not very
complicated if they're in high abundance

2474
00:47:21,109 --> 00:47:21,119
complicated if they're in high abundance
 

2475
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:23,670
complicated if they're in high abundance
and some random events allow some things

2476
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:23,680
and some random events allow some things
 

2477
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,790
and some random events allow some things
to start

2478
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:24,800
to start
 

2479
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,670
to start
reinforcing the existence of a small

2480
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:27,680
reinforcing the existence of a small
 

2481
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,109
reinforcing the existence of a small
subset of objects and if they can do

2482
00:47:30,109 --> 00:47:30,119
subset of objects and if they can do
 

2483
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:32,870
subset of objects and if they can do
that um you know like just molecules

2484
00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:32,880
that um you know like just molecules
 

2485
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,870
that um you know like just molecules
basically recognizing each other and

2486
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:34,880
basically recognizing each other and
 

2487
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,829
basically recognizing each other and
being able to catalyze certain

00:47:36,829 --> 00:47:36,839
being able to catalyze certain
 

2489
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:40,270
being able to catalyze certain
reactions uh there's this kind of uh

2490
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:40,280
reactions uh there's this kind of uh
 

2491
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:43,470
reactions uh there's this kind of uh
transition point that happens

2492
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:43,480
transition point that happens
 

2493
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:47,470
transition point that happens
where unless you get a self reinforcing

2501
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:58,589

point where objects can't exist unless
they have this selection and history in

2512
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:07,920
they have this selection and history in
 

2513
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,790
they have this selection and history in
them is what we call the original life

2514
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:09,800
them is what we call the original life
 

2515
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,030
them is what we call the original life
and pretty much everything beyond that

2516
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:12,040
and pretty much everything beyond that
 

2517
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,990
and pretty much everything beyond that
boundary um is holding on for dear life

2518
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:15,000
boundary um is holding on for dear life
 

2519
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,630
boundary um is holding on for dear life
to all of the causation and causal

2520
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:16,640
to all of the causation and causal
 

2521
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,030
to all of the causation and causal
structure that's basically put it there

2522
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:19,040
structure that's basically put it there
 

2523
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,589
structure that's basically put it there
um and it's carving its way through this

2524
00:48:21,589 --> 00:48:21,599
um and it's carving its way through this
 

2525
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,829
um and it's carving its way through this
possibility space um into generating

2526
00:48:25,829 --> 00:48:25,839
possibility space um into generating
 

2527
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:27,230
possibility space um into generating
more and more structure and that's when

2528
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:27,240
more and more structure and that's when
 

2529
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,910
more and more structure and that's when
you get the open-ended Cascade of

2530
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:28,920
you get the open-ended Cascade of
 

2531
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,630
you get the open-ended Cascade of
evolution but that boundary point is

2532
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:30,640
evolution but that boundary point is
 

2533
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,750
evolution but that boundary point is
really hard to cross and then what

2534
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:31,760
really hard to cross and then what
 

2535
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,910
really hard to cross and then what
happens when you cross that boundary

2536
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:32,920
happens when you cross that boundary
 

2537
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,670
happens when you cross that boundary
point and the way objects come into

2538
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:34,680
point and the way objects come into
 

2539
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:35,990
point and the way objects come into
existence is also like really

2540
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:36,000
existence is also like really

00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:40,040
like as Things become more complex the

00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:41,960
assembly index increases I can explain
 

2547
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,270

00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,510
what you want to explain uh me to

hear um this uh sorry I have like a very

2554
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:52,160
hear um this uh sorry I have like a very
 

2555
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,109
hear um this uh sorry I have like a very
Vivid visual in my brain and it's really

2556
00:48:54,109 --> 00:48:54,119
Vivid visual in my brain and it's really
 

2557
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:55,670
Vivid visual in my brain and it's really
hard to articulate it got to convert it

2558
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:55,680
hard to articulate it got to convert it
 

2559
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,990
hard to articulate it got to convert it
to language I know

2560
00:48:57,990 --> 00:48:58,000
to language I know
 

2561
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,109
to language I know
so hard it's not it's like it's going

2562
00:49:00,109 --> 00:49:00,119
so hard it's not it's like it's going
 

2563
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:02,069
so hard it's not it's like it's going
from like a feeling to a visual to

2564
00:49:02,069 --> 00:49:02,079
from like a feeling to a visual to
 

2565
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:04,190
from like a feeling to a visual to
language is so stifling sometimes I have

2566
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:04,200
language is so stifling sometimes I have
 

2567
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,030
language is so stifling sometimes I have
to convert it yeah from language to to a

2568
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:07,040
to convert it yeah from language to to a
 

2569
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,230
to convert it yeah from language to to a
visual to a feeling yeah I think it's

2570
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:10,240
visual to a feeling yeah I think it's
 

2571
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,270
visual to a feeling yeah I think it's
working I hope so I really like the

2572
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:13,280
working I hope so I really like the
 

2573
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,750
working I hope so I really like the
self-reinforcing objects I

2574
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:15,760
self-reinforcing objects I
 

2575
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,630
self-reinforcing objects I
mean just so I understand one way to

2576
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:19,640
mean just so I understand one way to
 

2577
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,750
mean just so I understand one way to
create a lot of the same kind of object

2578
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:21,760
create a lot of the same kind of object
 

2579
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,630
create a lot of the same kind of object
is make them self

2580
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:23,640
is make them self
 

2581
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:27,349
is make them self
reinforcing yes so self- reproduction

2582
00:49:27,349 --> 00:49:27,359
reinforcing yes so self- reproduction
 

2583
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:29,030
reinforcing yes so self- reproduction
has its property right like if a system

2584
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:29,040
has its property right like if a system
 

2585
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,750
has its property right like if a system
can make itself then it can it can

2586
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:31,760
can make itself then it can it can
 

2587
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,510
can make itself then it can it can
persist in time right cuz all objects

2588
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:33,520
persist in time right cuz all objects
 

2589
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,030
persist in time right cuz all objects
Decay they all have a finite lifetime so

2590
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:36,040
Decay they all have a finite lifetime so
 

2591
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,630
Decay they all have a finite lifetime so
if you're able to make a copy of

2592
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:37,640
if you're able to make a copy of
 

2593
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:41,230
if you're able to make a copy of
yourself before you die before the

2594
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:41,240
yourself before you die before the
 

2595
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,870
yourself before you die before the
second law eats you or whatever people

2596
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:42,880
second law eats you or whatever people
 

2597
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,230
second law eats you or whatever people
think happens um then that structure can

2598
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:46,240
think happens um then that structure can
 

2599
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,349
think happens um then that structure can
persist in time so that's a way to sort

2600
00:49:48,349 --> 00:49:48,359
persist in time so that's a way to sort
 

2601
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:51,549
persist in time so that's a way to sort
of emerge out of a random soup out of

2602
00:49:51,549 --> 00:49:51,559
of emerge out of a random soup out of
 

2603
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:53,589
of emerge out of a random soup out of
randomness of soup right but things that

2604
00:49:53,589 --> 00:49:53,599
randomness of soup right but things that
 

2605
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,829
randomness of soup right but things that
can copy themselves are very rare yeah

2606
00:49:55,829 --> 00:49:55,839
can copy themselves are very rare yeah
 

2607
00:49:55,839 --> 00:50:00,510
can copy themselves are very rare yeah
um and so what ends up happening is that

2608
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:00,520
um and so what ends up happening is that
 

2609
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,390
um and so what ends up happening is that
you get structures that enable the

2610
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:03,400
you get structures that enable the
 

2611
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:08,069
you get structures that enable the
existence of other things and then

2612
00:50:08,069 --> 00:50:08,079
existence of other things and then
 

2613
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:11,190
existence of other things and then
somehow only for some sets of objects

2614
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:11,200
somehow only for some sets of objects
 

2615
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,990
somehow only for some sets of objects
you get closed structures that are

2616
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:13,000
you get closed structures that are
 

2617
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,190
you get closed structures that are
self-reinforcing and allow that entire

2618
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:15,200
self-reinforcing and allow that entire
 

2619
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,430
self-reinforcing and allow that entire
structure to persist right so the one

2620
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:18,440
structure to persist right so the one
 

2621
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,630
structure to persist right so the one
object a reinforces the existence of

2622
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:21,640
object a reinforces the existence of
 

2623
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:24,950
object a reinforces the existence of
object B but you know object a can die

2624
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:24,960
object B but you know object a can die
 

2625
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,549
object B but you know object a can die
yeah so you have to like close that Loop

2626
00:50:27,549 --> 00:50:27,559
yeah so you have to like close that Loop
 

2627
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:29,349
yeah so you have to like close that Loop
right so this is the class all very

2628
00:50:29,349 --> 00:50:29,359
right so this is the class all very
 

2629
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,069
right so this is the class all very
unlikely statistically but you know

2630
00:50:32,069 --> 00:50:32,079
unlikely statistically but you know
 

2631
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:36,309
unlikely statistically but you know
that's sufficiently um it's so you're

2632
00:50:36,309 --> 00:50:36,319
that's sufficiently um it's so you're
 

2633
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:38,670
that's sufficiently um it's so you're
saying there's a chance there is a

2634
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:38,680
saying there's a chance there is a
 

2635
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:41,510
saying there's a chance there is a
probability and then but once you solve

2636
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:41,520
probability and then but once you solve
 

2637
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,990
probability and then but once you solve
that once you close the loop you can

2638
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:43,000
that once you close the loop you can
 

2639
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,750
that once you close the loop you can
create a lot of those objects and that's

2640
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:44,760
create a lot of those objects and that's
 

2641
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:45,910
create a lot of those objects and that's
what we're trying to figure out is what

2642
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:45,920
what we're trying to figure out is what
 

2643
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,309
what we're trying to figure out is what
are the causal constraints that close

2644
00:50:47,309 --> 00:50:47,319
are the causal constraints that close
 

2645
00:50:47,319 --> 00:50:48,789
are the causal constraints that close
the loop so there is this idea that's

2646
00:50:48,789 --> 00:50:48,799
the loop so there is this idea that's
 

2647
00:50:48,799 --> 00:50:50,230
the loop so there is this idea that's
been in the literature for a really long

2648
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:50,240
been in the literature for a really long
 

2649
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,549
been in the literature for a really long
time that was originally proposed by

2650
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:51,559
time that was originally proposed by
 

2651
00:50:51,559 --> 00:50:53,030
time that was originally proposed by
Stuart Kaufman as really critical to the

2652
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:53,040
Stuart Kaufman as really critical to the
 

2653
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,710
Stuart Kaufman as really critical to the
origin life called autoc cic set so

2654
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:54,720
origin life called autoc cic set so
 

2655
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,710
origin life called autoc cic set so
autoc set is exactly this property we

2656
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:56,720
autoc set is exactly this property we
 

2657
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,710
autoc set is exactly this property we
have a makes b b makes c c makes a and

2658
00:50:59,710 --> 00:50:59,720
have a makes b b makes c c makes a and
 

2659
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,349
have a makes b b makes c c makes a and
you get a closed system but the problem

2660
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:01,359
you get a closed system but the problem
 

2661
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:03,710
you get a closed system but the problem
with the theory of autoc cataly sets is

2662
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:03,720
with the theory of autoc cataly sets is
 

2663
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,630
with the theory of autoc cataly sets is
incredibly brittle as a theory and it

2664
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:06,640
incredibly brittle as a theory and it
 

2665
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,870
incredibly brittle as a theory and it
requires a lot of ad hoc assumptions

2666
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:08,880
requires a lot of ad hoc assumptions
 

2667
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,829
requires a lot of ad hoc assumptions
like you have to assume function you

2668
00:51:11,829 --> 00:51:11,839
like you have to assume function you
 

2669
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:14,430
like you have to assume function you
have to say this thing makes B it's not

2670
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:14,440
have to say this thing makes B it's not
 

2671
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,270
have to say this thing makes B it's not
an emergent property the association

2672
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:16,280
an emergent property the association
 

2673
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,430
an emergent property the association
between a and b and so the way I think

2674
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:19,440
between a and b and so the way I think
 

2675
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,510
between a and b and so the way I think
about it is much more General if you

2676
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:21,520
about it is much more General if you
 

2677
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,349
about it is much more General if you
think

2678
00:51:22,349 --> 00:51:22,359
think
 

2679
00:51:22,359 --> 00:51:25,309
think
about um these histories that make

2680
00:51:25,309 --> 00:51:25,319
about um these histories that make
 

2681
00:51:25,319 --> 00:51:27,230
about um these histories that make
objects it's it's kind of like the

2682
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:27,240
objects it's it's kind of like the
 

2683
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,030
objects it's it's kind of like the
structure of the histories

2684
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:29,040
structure of the histories
 

2685
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,870
structure of the histories
becomes um collapses in such a way that

2686
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:32,880
becomes um collapses in such a way that
 

2687
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,270
becomes um collapses in such a way that
these things are all in the same sort of

2688
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:35,280
these things are all in the same sort of
 

2689
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,910
these things are all in the same sort of
causal structure and that causal

2690
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:36,920
causal structure and that causal
 

2691
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,750
causal structure and that causal
structure actually Loops back on itself

2692
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:38,760
structure actually Loops back on itself
 

2693
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,190
structure actually Loops back on itself
to be able to generate some of the

2694
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:40,200
to be able to generate some of the
 

2695
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,190
to be able to generate some of the
things that make the higher level

2696
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:42,200
things that make the higher level
 

2697
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,549
things that make the higher level
structures Lee has a beautiful example

2698
00:51:44,549 --> 00:51:44,559
structures Lee has a beautiful example
 

2699
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,549
structures Lee has a beautiful example
of this actually in malinam it's like

2700
00:51:46,549 --> 00:51:46,559
of this actually in malinam it's like
 

2701
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,630
of this actually in malinam it's like
the first

2702
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:48,640
the first
 

2703
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,670
the first
nonorganic autocatalytic set it's a

2704
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:51,680
nonorganic autocatalytic set it's a
 

2705
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:55,510
nonorganic autocatalytic set it's a
self-reproducing malum ring uh but it's

2706
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:55,520
self-reproducing malum ring uh but it's
 

2707
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:59,069
self-reproducing malum ring uh but it's
like like ium and and basically like if

2708
00:51:59,069 --> 00:51:59,079
like like ium and and basically like if
 

2709
00:51:59,079 --> 00:52:00,990
like like ium and and basically like if
you look at the malum it makes a huge

2710
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:01,000
you look at the malum it makes a huge
 

2711
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,910
you look at the malum it makes a huge
malum ring I don't remember exactly how

2712
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:02,920
malum ring I don't remember exactly how
 

2713
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,230
malum ring I don't remember exactly how
big it is it might be like 150 malum

2714
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:05,240
big it is it might be like 150 malum
 

2715
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,829
big it is it might be like 150 malum
atoms or something but if you think

2716
00:52:06,829 --> 00:52:06,839
atoms or something but if you think
 

2717
00:52:06,839 --> 00:52:08,510
atoms or something but if you think
about the configuration space of that

2718
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:08,520
about the configuration space of that
 

2719
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,349
about the configuration space of that
object you know it's exponentially large

2720
00:52:10,349 --> 00:52:10,359
object you know it's exponentially large
 

2721
00:52:10,359 --> 00:52:12,150
object you know it's exponentially large
how many possible molecules so like why

2722
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:12,160
how many possible molecules so like why
 

2723
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,829
how many possible molecules so like why
does the entire system collaps on just

2724
00:52:13,829 --> 00:52:13,839
does the entire system collaps on just
 

2725
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,870
does the entire system collaps on just
making that one structure if you start

2726
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:15,880
making that one structure if you start
 

2727
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,910
making that one structure if you start
from like you know malum atoms that are

2728
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:17,920
from like you know malum atoms that are
 

2729
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,589
from like you know malum atoms that are
maybe just like a couple of them stuck

2730
00:52:19,589 --> 00:52:19,599
maybe just like a couple of them stuck
 

2731
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:22,510
maybe just like a couple of them stuck
together and so what they see in this

2732
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:22,520
together and so what they see in this
 

2733
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,309
together and so what they see in this
system is there's a few intermediate

2734
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:24,319
system is there's a few intermediate
 

2735
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:25,870
system is there's a few intermediate
stages so there's like some random

2736
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:25,880
stages so there's like some random
 

2737
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,150
stages so there's like some random
events where the chemistry comes

2738
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:27,160
events where the chemistry comes
 

2739
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,109
events where the chemistry comes
together makes these structures and then

2740
00:52:29,109 --> 00:52:29,119
together makes these structures and then
 

2741
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:30,630
together makes these structures and then
once you get to this very large one it

2742
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:30,640
once you get to this very large one it
 

2743
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,230
once you get to this very large one it
becomes a template for the smaller ones

2744
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:32,240
becomes a template for the smaller ones
 

2745
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,230
becomes a template for the smaller ones
and then the whole system just

2746
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:33,240
and then the whole system just
 

2747
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,190
and then the whole system just
reinforces its own production how did

2748
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:35,200
reinforces its own production how did
 

2749
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:40,549
reinforces its own production how did
Lee find this malib

2750
00:52:40,549 --> 00:52:40,559

 

2751
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:43,549

denum close loop if I knew how Le's

2752
00:52:43,549 --> 00:52:43,559
denum close loop if I knew how Le's
 

2753
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:45,430
denum close loop if I knew how Le's
brain work I think I would understand a

2754
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:45,440
brain work I think I would understand a
 

2755
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,309
brain work I think I would understand a
more about the universe but I this is

2756
00:52:47,309 --> 00:52:47,319
more about the universe but I this is
 

2757
00:52:47,319 --> 00:52:49,789
more about the universe but I this is
not an algorithmic Discovery it's a like

2758
00:52:49,789 --> 00:52:49,799
not an algorithmic Discovery it's a like
 

2759
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:51,950
not an algorithmic Discovery it's a like
no but um but you I think it goes to the

2760
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:51,960
no but um but you I think it goes to the
 

2761
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,470
no but um but you I think it goes to the
deepest roots of like when he started

2762
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:53,480
deepest roots of like when he started
 

2763
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,230
deepest roots of like when he started
thinking about origins of life so I like

2764
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:55,240
thinking about origins of life so I like
 

2765
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,950
thinking about origins of life so I like
I I mean I don't know all his but like

2766
00:52:56,950 --> 00:52:56,960
I I mean I don't know all his but like
 

2767
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,190
I I mean I don't know all his but like
what he's told me is um he started out

2768
00:52:59,190 --> 00:52:59,200
what he's told me is um he started out
 

2769
00:52:59,200 --> 00:52:59,990
what he's told me is um he started out
in

2770
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:00,000
in
 

2771
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,190
in
crystallography um and you know there's

2772
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:02,200
crystallography um and you know there's
 

2773
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,910
crystallography um and you know there's
some things that he would just you know

2774
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:03,920
some things that he would just you know
 

2775
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,349
some things that he would just you know
like people would just take for granted

2776
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:06,359
like people would just take for granted
 

2777
00:53:06,359 --> 00:53:09,390
like people would just take for granted
about chemical structures um that he was

2778
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:09,400
about chemical structures um that he was
 

2779
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,150
about chemical structures um that he was
like deeply perplexed about like just

2780
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:11,160
like deeply perplexed about like just
 

2781
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,870
like deeply perplexed about like just
like why are these like really intricate

2782
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:13,880
like why are these like really intricate
 

2783
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,589
like why are these like really intricate
really complex structures forming so

2784
00:53:15,589 --> 00:53:15,599
really complex structures forming so
 

2785
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:19,230
really complex structures forming so
easily under these conditions and he was

2786
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:19,240
easily under these conditions and he was
 

2787
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:22,150
easily under these conditions and he was
really interested in life um but he

2788
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:22,160
really interested in life um but he
 

2789
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,870
really interested in life um but he
started in that field so he's just

2790
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:23,880
started in that field so he's just
 

2791
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,390
started in that field so he's just
carried with him these sort of deep

2792
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:25,400
carried with him these sort of deep
 

2793
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,910
carried with him these sort of deep
insights from these systems that seem

2794
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:26,920
insights from these systems that seem
 

2795
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,589
insights from these systems that seem
like they're totally not alive and just

2796
00:53:28,589 --> 00:53:28,599
like they're totally not alive and just
 

2797
00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:30,549
like they're totally not alive and just
like these metallic

2798
00:53:30,549 --> 00:53:30,559
like these metallic
 

2799
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:33,750
like these metallic
chemistries um into actually thinking

2800
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:33,760
chemistries um into actually thinking
 

2801
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,349
chemistries um into actually thinking
about the Deep principles of life so I

2802
00:53:35,349 --> 00:53:35,359
about the Deep principles of life so I
 

2803
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,430
about the Deep principles of life so I
think he

2804
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:36,440
think he
 

2805
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,990
think he
already uh he already knew a lot about

2806
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:40,000
already uh he already knew a lot about
 

2807
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,069
already uh he already knew a lot about
that chemistry and he

2808
00:53:42,069 --> 00:53:42,079
that chemistry and he
 

2809
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:45,589
that chemistry and he
also um you know assembly Theory came

2810
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:45,599
also um you know assembly Theory came
 

2811
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,069
also um you know assembly Theory came
from him thinking about how these

2812
00:53:47,069 --> 00:53:47,079
from him thinking about how these
 

2813
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:49,750
from him thinking about how these
systems work uh so he had some intuition

2814
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:49,760
systems work uh so he had some intuition
 

2815
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,829
systems work uh so he had some intuition
about what was going on with this mum

2816
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:52,839
about what was going on with this mum
 

2817
00:53:52,839 --> 00:53:55,950
about what was going on with this mum
ring the malib might be able to be the

2818
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:55,960
ring the malib might be able to be the
 

2819
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:58,150
ring the malib might be able to be the
thing that makes a ring they knew about

2820
00:53:58,150 --> 00:53:58,160
thing that makes a ring they knew about
 

2821
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,430
thing that makes a ring they knew about
them for a long time but they didn't

2822
00:53:59,430 --> 00:53:59,440
them for a long time but they didn't
 

2823
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,030
them for a long time but they didn't
know that the mechanism of why that

2824
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:01,040
know that the mechanism of why that
 

2825
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,270
know that the mechanism of why that
particular structure form was autoc

2826
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:02,280
particular structure form was autoc
 

2827
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,870
particular structure form was autoc
catalic feedback um and so that's what

2828
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:04,880
catalic feedback um and so that's what
 

2829
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,829
catalic feedback um and so that's what
they they figured out in this this paper

2830
00:54:06,829 --> 00:54:06,839
they they figured out in this this paper
 

2831
00:54:06,839 --> 00:54:08,670
they they figured out in this this paper
and I actually think that paper is

2832
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:08,680
and I actually think that paper is
 

2833
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,309
and I actually think that paper is
revealing some of the mechanism of the

2834
00:54:10,309 --> 00:54:10,319
revealing some of the mechanism of the
 

2835
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:12,030
revealing some of the mechanism of the
origin life transition because really

2836
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:12,040
origin life transition because really
 

2837
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,710
origin life transition because really
what you see like the origin of life is

2838
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:14,720
what you see like the origin of life is
 

2839
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,309
what you see like the origin of life is
basically like you should have a comori

2840
00:54:17,309 --> 00:54:17,319
basically like you should have a comori
 

2841
00:54:17,319 --> 00:54:20,630
basically like you should have a comori
explosion of the space of possible

2842
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:20,640
explosion of the space of possible
 

2843
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,910
explosion of the space of possible
structures um that are too large to

2844
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:22,920
structures um that are too large to
 

2845
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,349
structures um that are too large to
exhaust and yet you see it collapse on

2846
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:25,359
exhaust and yet you see it collapse on
 

2847
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:28,230
exhaust and yet you see it collapse on
this you know really small space of

2848
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:28,240
this you know really small space of
 

2849
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,990
this you know really small space of
possibilities that's mutually

2850
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:30,000
possibilities that's mutually
 

2851
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,150
possibilities that's mutually
reinforcing itself to keep

2852
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:32,160
reinforcing itself to keep
 

2853
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,870
reinforcing itself to keep
existing that is the origin of life

2854
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:34,880
existing that is the origin of life
 

2855
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,270
existing that is the origin of life
there's some set of structures that

2856
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:37,280
there's some set of structures that
 

2857
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,589
there's some set of structures that
result in this autoc catalytic feedback

2858
00:54:40,589 --> 00:54:40,599
result in this autoc catalytic feedback
 

2859
00:54:40,599 --> 00:54:43,710
result in this autoc catalytic feedback
yeah and this what is it tiny tiny tiny

2860
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:43,720
yeah and this what is it tiny tiny tiny
 

2861
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:47,710
yeah and this what is it tiny tiny tiny
tiny percent I think it's a small space

2862
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:47,720
tiny percent I think it's a small space
 

2863
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:51,190
tiny percent I think it's a small space
but chemistry is very large so so like U

2864
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:51,200
but chemistry is very large so so like U
 

2865
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,510
but chemistry is very large so so like U
there might be a lot of them out there

2866
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:52,520
there might be a lot of them out there
 

2867
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,750
there might be a lot of them out there
but we don't know and one of them is the

2868
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:54,760
but we don't know and one of them is the
 

2869
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,109
but we don't know and one of them is the
thing that probably started life on

2870
00:54:56,109 --> 00:54:56,119
thing that probably started life on
 

2871
00:54:56,119 --> 00:54:58,910
thing that probably started life on
Earth that's right or many many starts

2872
00:54:58,910 --> 00:54:58,920
Earth that's right or many many starts
 

2873
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,349
Earth that's right or many many starts
yes and it keeps starting maybe yeah I

2874
00:55:01,349 --> 00:55:01,359
yes and it keeps starting maybe yeah I
 

2875
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:02,710
yes and it keeps starting maybe yeah I
mean there's also all kinds of other

2876
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:02,720
mean there's also all kinds of other
 

2877
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,470
mean there's also all kinds of other
weird properties that happen around this

2878
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:05,480
weird properties that happen around this
 

2879
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,349
weird properties that happen around this
kind of um phase

2880
00:55:08,349 --> 00:55:08,359
kind of um phase
 

2881
00:55:08,359 --> 00:55:11,230
kind of um phase
boundary um so this other project that I

2882
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:11,240
boundary um so this other project that I
 

2883
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,789
boundary um so this other project that I
have in my lab is focused on the origin

2884
00:55:12,789 --> 00:55:12,799
have in my lab is focused on the origin
 

2885
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:13,470
have in my lab is focused on the origin
of

2886
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:13,480
of
 

2887
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:16,270
of
chirality um which is uh you know

2888
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:16,280
chirality um which is uh you know
 

2889
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,510
chirality um which is uh you know
thinking about so so chirality is this

2890
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:18,520
thinking about so so chirality is this
 

2891
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:19,670
thinking about so so chirality is this
property of molecules that they can come

2892
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:19,680
property of molecules that they can come
 

2893
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,029
property of molecules that they can come
in Mirror Image forms so like just like

2894
00:55:22,029 --> 00:55:22,039
in Mirror Image forms so like just like
 

2895
00:55:22,039 --> 00:55:24,109
in Mirror Image forms so like just like
chyro literally means hand so your your

2896
00:55:24,109 --> 00:55:24,119
chyro literally means hand so your your
 

2897
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:26,430
chyro literally means hand so your your
left and right hand are what's called

2898
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:26,440
left and right hand are what's called
 

2899
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,230
left and right hand are what's called
nons superimposable because if you try

2900
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:28,240
nons superimposable because if you try
 

2901
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,630
nons superimposable because if you try
to lay one on the other you can't

2902
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:29,640
to lay one on the other you can't
 

2903
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,069
to lay one on the other you can't
actually lay them directly on top of

2904
00:55:31,069 --> 00:55:31,079
actually lay them directly on top of
 

2905
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:33,390
actually lay them directly on top of
each other um and that's the property

2906
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:33,400
each other um and that's the property
 

2907
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,430
each other um and that's the property
being a mirror image so there's a sort

2908
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:35,440
being a mirror image so there's a sort
 

2909
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,029
being a mirror image so there's a sort
of perplexing property of the chemistry

2910
00:55:37,029 --> 00:55:37,039
of perplexing property of the chemistry
 

2911
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:38,390
of perplexing property of the chemistry
life that no one's been able to really

2912
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:38,400
life that no one's been able to really
 

2913
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,589
life that no one's been able to really
adequately explain that all of the amino

2914
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:41,599
adequately explain that all of the amino
 

2915
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:44,630
adequately explain that all of the amino
acids in proteins are left-handed and

2916
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:44,640
acids in proteins are left-handed and
 

2917
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:49,069
acids in proteins are left-handed and
all of the uh bases in RNA and DNA are

2918
00:55:49,069 --> 00:55:49,079
all of the uh bases in RNA and DNA are
 

2919
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:51,470
all of the uh bases in RNA and DNA are
right-handed and yet the chemistry of

2920
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:51,480
right-handed and yet the chemistry of
 

2921
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:54,029
right-handed and yet the chemistry of
these these building block units the

2922
00:55:54,029 --> 00:55:54,039
these these building block units the
 

2923
00:55:54,039 --> 00:55:55,710
these these building block units the
amino acids and nuclear bases is the

2924
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:55,720
amino acids and nuclear bases is the
 

2925
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,109
amino acids and nuclear bases is the
same for left and right-handed so you

2926
00:55:57,109 --> 00:55:57,119
same for left and right-handed so you
 

2927
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:58,470
same for left and right-handed so you
have to have like some kind of symmetry

2928
00:55:58,470 --> 00:55:58,480
have to have like some kind of symmetry
 

2929
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,349
have to have like some kind of symmetry
breaking where you go from these

2930
00:56:00,349 --> 00:56:00,359
breaking where you go from these
 

2931
00:56:00,359 --> 00:56:01,670
breaking where you go from these
chemistries that seem entirely

2932
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:01,680
chemistries that seem entirely
 

2933
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:05,029
chemistries that seem entirely
equivalent to only having uh one

2934
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:05,039
equivalent to only having uh one
 

2935
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:07,349
equivalent to only having uh one
chemistry takeover as the dominant form

2936
00:56:07,349 --> 00:56:07,359
chemistry takeover as the dominant form
 

2937
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:10,390
chemistry takeover as the dominant form
and for a long time I had been really I

2938
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:10,400
and for a long time I had been really I
 

2939
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,510
and for a long time I had been really I
actually did my PhD on the origin of

2940
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:12,520
actually did my PhD on the origin of
 

2941
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:15,069
actually did my PhD on the origin of
chirality I was working on it as like a

2942
00:56:15,069 --> 00:56:15,079
chirality I was working on it as like a
 

2943
00:56:15,079 --> 00:56:16,750
chirality I was working on it as like a
symmetry breaking problem in physics

2944
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:16,760
symmetry breaking problem in physics
 

2945
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:17,670
symmetry breaking problem in physics
this is how I got started in the

2946
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:17,680
this is how I got started in the
 

2947
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,510
this is how I got started in the
original life and then I left it for a

2948
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:19,520
original life and then I left it for a
 

2949
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:20,549
original life and then I left it for a
long time because I thought it was like

2950
00:56:20,549 --> 00:56:20,559
long time because I thought it was like
 

2951
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:21,750
long time because I thought it was like
one of the most boring problems in the

2952
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:21,760
one of the most boring problems in the
 

2953
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,190
one of the most boring problems in the
original life but I've come back to it

2954
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:23,200
original life but I've come back to it
 

2955
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,230
original life but I've come back to it
cuz I think there's something really

2956
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:24,240
cuz I think there's something really
 

2957
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,910
cuz I think there's something really
deep going on here related to this like

2958
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:25,920
deep going on here related to this like
 

2959
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,750
deep going on here related to this like
common torial explosion of the space of

2960
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:28,760
common torial explosion of the space of
 

2961
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:32,069
common torial explosion of the space of
possibilities um but just to to to get

2962
00:56:32,069 --> 00:56:32,079
possibilities um but just to to to get
 

2963
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:33,910
possibilities um but just to to to get
to that point like this feature of this

2964
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:33,920
to that point like this feature of this
 

2965
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,029
to that point like this feature of this
handedness has been the main focus but

2966
00:56:37,029 --> 00:56:37,039
handedness has been the main focus but
 

2967
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:39,549
handedness has been the main focus but
people take for granted um the existence

2968
00:56:39,549 --> 00:56:39,559
people take for granted um the existence
 

2969
00:56:39,559 --> 00:56:42,150
people take for granted um the existence
of chyro molecules at all that this

2970
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:42,160
of chyro molecules at all that this
 

2971
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:45,750
of chyro molecules at all that this
property of of having a handedness um

2972
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:45,760
property of of having a handedness um
 

2973
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,190
property of of having a handedness um
and they just assume that you know like

2974
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:48,200
and they just assume that you know like
 

2975
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,390
and they just assume that you know like
it's just a generic feature of chemistry

2976
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:50,400
it's just a generic feature of chemistry
 

2977
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,150
it's just a generic feature of chemistry
but if you actually look at molecules if

2978
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:53,160
but if you actually look at molecules if
 

2979
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,029
but if you actually look at molecules if
you look at chemical space which is like

2980
00:56:55,029 --> 00:56:55,039
you look at chemical space which is like
 

2981
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,589
you look at chemical space which is like
the space of all possible mole ules that

2982
00:56:56,589 --> 00:56:56,599
the space of all possible mole ules that
 

2983
00:56:56,599 --> 00:56:58,630
the space of all possible mole ules that
people can generate and you look at

2984
00:56:58,630 --> 00:56:58,640
people can generate and you look at
 

2985
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,069
people can generate and you look at
small molecules things that have less

2986
00:57:01,069 --> 00:57:01,079
small molecules things that have less
 

2987
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:04,349
small molecules things that have less
than about 7 to 11 heavy atoms so things

2988
00:57:04,349 --> 00:57:04,359
than about 7 to 11 heavy atoms so things
 

2989
00:57:04,359 --> 00:57:06,670
than about 7 to 11 heavy atoms so things
that are not hydrogen almost every

2990
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:06,680
that are not hydrogen almost every
 

2991
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,870
that are not hydrogen almost every
single molecule in that space is a chyal

2992
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:08,880
single molecule in that space is a chyal
 

2993
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,549
single molecule in that space is a chyal
like doesn't have a chyal center so it

2994
00:57:10,549 --> 00:57:10,559
like doesn't have a chyal center so it
 

2995
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:12,829
like doesn't have a chyal center so it
would be like a spoon a spoon doesn't

2996
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:12,839
would be like a spoon a spoon doesn't
 

2997
00:57:12,839 --> 00:57:14,510
would be like a spoon a spoon doesn't
have a like it's the same as its Mirror

2998
00:57:14,510 --> 00:57:14,520
have a like it's the same as its Mirror
 

2999
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,230
have a like it's the same as its Mirror
Image it's not like a hand that's

3000
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:16,240
Image it's not like a hand that's
 

3001
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,069
Image it's not like a hand that's
different than its Mirror Image but if

3002
00:57:18,069 --> 00:57:18,079
different than its Mirror Image but if
 

3003
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:21,150
different than its Mirror Image but if
you get to like this threshold um

3004
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:21,160
you get to like this threshold um
 

3005
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:24,230
you get to like this threshold um
boundary above that boundary almost

3006
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:24,240
boundary above that boundary almost
 

3007
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,710
boundary above that boundary almost
every single molecule is chyal so you go

3008
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:26,720
every single molecule is chyal so you go
 

3009
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,029
every single molecule is chyal so you go
from a universe where almost nothing has

3010
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:29,039
from a universe where almost nothing has
 

3011
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:30,870
from a universe where almost nothing has
a mirror image form there's no mirror

3012
00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:30,880
a mirror image form there's no mirror
 

3013
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,109
a mirror image form there's no mirror
image Universe of possibilities to this

3014
00:57:33,109 --> 00:57:33,119
image Universe of possibilities to this
 

3015
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:35,309
image Universe of possibilities to this
one where every single structure has

3016
00:57:35,309 --> 00:57:35,319
one where every single structure has
 

3017
00:57:35,319 --> 00:57:38,950
one where every single structure has
pretty much a mirror image version and

3018
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:38,960
pretty much a mirror image version and
 

3019
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,630
pretty much a mirror image version and
what we've been looking at in my lab is

3020
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:41,640
what we've been looking at in my lab is
 

3021
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:44,270
what we've been looking at in my lab is
that it seems to be the case that the

3022
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:44,280
that it seems to be the case that the
 

3023
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:46,589
that it seems to be the case that the
original life transition happens around

3024
00:57:46,589 --> 00:57:46,599
original life transition happens around
 

3025
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:49,230
original life transition happens around
the time when you start accumulating you

3026
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:49,240
the time when you start accumulating you
 

3027
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:51,870
the time when you start accumulating you
you push your molecules to a large

3028
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:51,880
you push your molecules to a large
 

3029
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:54,230
you push your molecules to a large
enough complexity that KY chyal

3030
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:54,240
enough complexity that KY chyal
 

3031
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:57,430
enough complexity that KY chyal
molecules become very likely to form and

3032
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:57,440
molecules become very likely to form and
 

3033
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,510
molecules become very likely to form and
then there's a Cascade of molecular

3034
00:57:59,510 --> 00:57:59,520
then there's a Cascade of molecular
 

3035
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,510
then there's a Cascade of molecular
recognition where where chyal molecules

3036
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:01,520
recognition where where chyal molecules
 

3037
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,349
recognition where where chyal molecules
can recognize each other and then you

3038
00:58:03,349 --> 00:58:03,359
can recognize each other and then you
 

3039
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:05,029
can recognize each other and then you
get this sort of autoc catalic feedback

3040
00:58:05,029 --> 00:58:05,039
get this sort of autoc catalic feedback
 

3041
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:07,230
get this sort of autoc catalic feedback
and things self-reinforcing so is

3042
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:07,240
and things self-reinforcing so is
 

3043
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,829
and things self-reinforcing so is
chirality in

3044
00:58:08,829 --> 00:58:08,839
chirality in
 

3045
00:58:08,839 --> 00:58:11,029
chirality in
itself interesting feature is just an

3046
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:11,039
itself interesting feature is just an
 

3047
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:13,029
itself interesting feature is just an
accident of no it's a super interesting

3048
00:58:13,029 --> 00:58:13,039
accident of no it's a super interesting
 

3049
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:14,510
accident of no it's a super interesting
feature I think chirality breaks

3050
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:14,520
feature I think chirality breaks
 

3051
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,230
feature I think chirality breaks
Symmetry and time not space so we think

3052
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:16,240
Symmetry and time not space so we think
 

3053
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,710
Symmetry and time not space so we think
of it as a space spatial property uh

3054
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:18,720
of it as a space spatial property uh
 

3055
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,470
of it as a space spatial property uh
like a left and right hand but if I

3056
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:20,480
like a left and right hand but if I
 

3057
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,230
like a left and right hand but if I
choose the left hand I'm basically

3058
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:22,240
choose the left hand I'm basically
 

3059
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,549
choose the left hand I'm basically
choosing the future of that system for

3060
00:58:24,549 --> 00:58:24,559
choosing the future of that system for
 

3061
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:26,710
choosing the future of that system for
all time because I've basically made a

3062
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:26,720
all time because I've basically made a
 

3063
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,549
all time because I've basically made a
choice between the ways that that

3064
00:58:28,549 --> 00:58:28,559
choice between the ways that that
 

3065
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:30,349
choice between the ways that that
molecule can now react with every other

3066
00:58:30,349 --> 00:58:30,359
molecule can now react with every other
 

3067
00:58:30,359 --> 00:58:32,990
molecule can now react with every other
object in its chemical Universe oh I see

3068
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:33,000
object in its chemical Universe oh I see
 

3069
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,670
object in its chemical Universe oh I see
and so you've you're actually like when

3070
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:34,680
and so you've you're actually like when
 

3071
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,950
and so you've you're actually like when
you have this splitting of making a

3072
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:36,960
you have this splitting of making a
 

3073
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,150
you have this splitting of making a
molecule that now has another form it

3074
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:39,160
molecule that now has another form it
 

3075
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,670
molecule that now has another form it
could have had uh by the same exact

3076
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:41,680
could have had uh by the same exact
 

3077
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,349
could have had uh by the same exact
Atomic composition but now it's just a

3078
00:58:43,349 --> 00:58:43,359
Atomic composition but now it's just a
 

3079
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:45,190
Atomic composition but now it's just a
mirror image isometry you're basically

3080
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:45,200
mirror image isometry you're basically
 

3081
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,829
mirror image isometry you're basically
splitting the universe of possibilities

3082
00:58:46,829 --> 00:58:46,839
splitting the universe of possibilities
 

3083
00:58:46,839 --> 00:58:50,470
splitting the universe of possibilities
every time yeah in two in two but

3084
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:50,480
every time yeah in two in two but
 

3085
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:51,750
every time yeah in two in two but
molecules can have more than one chyro

3086
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:51,760
molecules can have more than one chyro
 

3087
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:52,870
molecules can have more than one chyro
Center and that's not the only

3088
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:52,880
Center and that's not the only
 

3089
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,109
Center and that's not the only
stereometry that they can have so this

3090
00:58:55,109 --> 00:58:55,119
stereometry that they can have so this
 

3091
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:57,349
stereometry that they can have so this
is one of the reasons that all fills 1.5

3092
00:58:57,349 --> 00:58:57,359
is one of the reasons that all fills 1.5
 

3093
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:59,510
is one of the reasons that all fills 1.5
universes of space it's all of these

3094
00:58:59,510 --> 00:58:59,520
universes of space it's all of these
 

3095
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,270
universes of space it's all of these
spatial permutations that you do on

3096
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:01,280
spatial permutations that you do on
 

3097
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,510
spatial permutations that you do on
these objects that actually makes the

3098
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:02,520
these objects that actually makes the
 

3099
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:05,309
these objects that actually makes the
space so huge so the point of this this

3100
00:59:05,309 --> 00:59:05,319
space so huge so the point of this this
 

3101
00:59:05,319 --> 00:59:07,190
space so huge so the point of this this
sort of chyal transition that I'm I'm

3102
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:07,200
sort of chyal transition that I'm I'm
 

3103
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,270
sort of chyal transition that I'm I'm
pointing out is is chirality is actually

3104
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:09,280
pointing out is is chirality is actually
 

3105
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,870
pointing out is is chirality is actually
signature of being in a complex chemical

3106
00:59:11,870 --> 00:59:11,880
signature of being in a complex chemical
 

3107
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:14,470
signature of being in a complex chemical
space um and the fact that we we think

3108
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:14,480
space um and the fact that we we think
 

3109
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,990
space um and the fact that we we think
it's a really generic feature of

3110
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:16,000
it's a really generic feature of
 

3111
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,670
it's a really generic feature of
chemistry and it's really prevalent is

3112
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:17,680
chemistry and it's really prevalent is
 

3113
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,190
chemistry and it's really prevalent is
because most of the chemistry we study

3114
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:19,200
because most of the chemistry we study
 

3115
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,510
because most of the chemistry we study
on Earth is a product already of life

3116
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:21,520
on Earth is a product already of life
 

3117
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,270
on Earth is a product already of life
and it also has to do with this

3118
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:23,280
and it also has to do with this
 

3119
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,870
and it also has to do with this
transition and assembly this transition

3120
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:24,880
transition and assembly this transition
 

3121
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,549
transition and assembly this transition
and possibility space is because I I

3122
00:59:27,549 --> 00:59:27,559
and possibility space is because I I
 

3123
00:59:27,559 --> 00:59:28,470
and possibility space is because I I
think there's something really

3124
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:28,480
think there's something really
 

3125
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,990
think there's something really
fundamental going on at this boundary um

3126
00:59:31,990 --> 00:59:32,000
fundamental going on at this boundary um
 

3127
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,549
fundamental going on at this boundary um
that you don't really need to go that

3128
00:59:33,549 --> 00:59:33,559
that you don't really need to go that
 

3129
00:59:33,559 --> 00:59:36,549
that you don't really need to go that
far into chemical space if you can to

3130
00:59:36,549 --> 00:59:36,559
far into chemical space if you can to
 

3131
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:38,750
far into chemical space if you can to
actually see life in terms of this depth

3132
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:38,760
actually see life in terms of this depth
 

3133
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:41,589
actually see life in terms of this depth
in time this depth in in symmetries of

but but getting past this boundary

3140
00:59:50,069 --> 00:59:50,079
but but getting past this boundary
 

3141
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:51,750
but but getting past this boundary
that's that's not very deep in that

3142
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:51,760
that's that's not very deep in that
 

3143
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:55,589
that's that's not very deep in that
space requires life it's a it's a really

3144
00:59:55,589 --> 00:59:55,599
space requires life it's a it's a really
 

3145
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:58,470

it's a really weird property and it's

3146
00:59:58,470 --> 00:59:58,480
it's a really weird property and it's
 

3147
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,190
it's a really weird property and it's
really weird that so many abrupt things

3148
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:00,200
really weird that so many abrupt things
 

3149
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,349
really weird that so many abrupt things
happen in chemistry at that same scale

3150
01:00:02,349 --> 01:00:02,359
happen in chemistry at that same scale
 

3151
01:00:02,359 --> 01:00:05,109
happen in chemistry at that same scale
so would that be the the greatest

3152
01:00:05,109 --> 01:00:05,119
so would that be the the greatest
 

3153
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:08,910
so would that be the the greatest
invention ever made on Earth in its

01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:08,920
invention ever made on Earth in its
 

3155
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,710

01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:10,720
evolutionary history so I really like
 

3157
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,829

01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:45,680
reproduction movement so just the
 

3185
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,470
reproduction movement so just the
ability to move under which you have the

3186

but a movement includes a lot of
 

3193
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,670
but a movement includes a lot of
interesting stuff in there like Predator

dangers against which you're trying to
 

3227
01:01:34,839 --> 01:01:38,670
dangers against which you're trying to
survive are also evolving this so just

3228
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:38,680
survive are also evolving this so just
 

3229
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:41,390
survive are also evolving this so just
much faster way to uh explore the space

3230
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:41,400
much faster way to uh explore the space
 

3231
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,589
much faster way to uh explore the space
of possibilities I actually think it's a

of possibilities I actually think it's a
 

3233
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:46,710
of possibilities I actually think it's a
gift that we don't have much time yes uh

3234
01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:46,720
gift that we don't have much time yes uh
 

3235
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,589

these are
 

3247
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:03,190
these are
all inventions yeah along the line I

3248
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:03,200
all inventions yeah along the line I
 

3249
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,789
all inventions yeah along the line I
like invention as a word for them I

3250
01:02:04,789 --> 01:02:04,799
like invention as a word for them I
 

3251
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:06,190
like invention as a word for them I
think that's good which are the more

3252
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:06,200
think that's good which are the more
 

3253
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,829
think that's good which are the more
interesting inventions to you what

3254
01:02:07,829 --> 01:02:07,839
interesting inventions to you what
 

3255
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:10,910
interesting inventions to you what
origin of life because you kind of are

3256
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:10,920
origin of life because you kind of are
 

3257
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:13,269
origin of life because you kind of are
not glorifying the origin of life and

3258
01:02:13,269 --> 01:02:13,279
not glorifying the origin of life and
 

3259
01:02:13,279 --> 01:02:15,109
not glorifying the origin of life and
self there's a there's a process no I

3260
01:02:15,109 --> 01:02:15,119
self there's a there's a process no I
 

3261
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:16,510
self there's a there's a process no I
think the origin of life is a continual

3262
01:02:16,510 --> 01:02:16,520
think the origin of life is a continual
 

3263
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,470
think the origin of life is a continual
process that's why I'm interested in the

3264
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:18,480
process that's why I'm interested in the
 

3265
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,870
process that's why I'm interested in the
first transition and solving that

3266
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:19,880
first transition and solving that
 

3267
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:21,150
first transition and solving that
problem because I think it's the hardest

3268
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:21,160
problem because I think it's the hardest
 

3269
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:22,910
problem because I think it's the hardest
but I think I think I think it's

3270
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:22,920
but I think I think I think it's
 

3271
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:24,670
but I think I think I think it's
happening all the time when you look

3272
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:24,680
happening all the time when you look
 

3273
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,549
happening all the time when you look
back at the history of Earth like what

3274
01:02:26,549 --> 01:02:26,559
back at the history of Earth like what
 

3275
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:31,510
back at the history of Earth like what
are you impressed to happen I like sight

3276
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:31,520
are you impressed to happen I like sight
 

3277
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:35,789
are you impressed to happen I like sight
um as an invention uh cuz I think having

3278
01:02:35,789 --> 01:02:35,799
um as an invention uh cuz I think having
 

3279
01:02:35,799 --> 01:02:38,910
um as an invention uh cuz I think having
sensory perception and trying to

3280
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:38,920
sensory perception and trying to
 

3281
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,109
sensory perception and trying to
comprehend the world to use

3282
01:02:40,109 --> 01:02:40,119
comprehend the world to use
 

3283
01:02:40,119 --> 01:02:43,470
comprehend the world to use
anthropocentric terms is like a really

3284
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:43,480
anthropocentric terms is like a really
 

3285
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:46,589
anthropocentric terms is like a really
critical feature of life and I also it's

3286
01:02:46,589 --> 01:02:46,599
critical feature of life and I also it's
 

3287
01:02:46,599 --> 01:02:49,510
critical feature of life and I also it's
interesting the way that site has

3288
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:49,520
interesting the way that site has
 

3289
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,549
interesting the way that site has
complexified over time right so like if

3290
01:02:51,549 --> 01:02:51,559
complexified over time right so like if
 

3291
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:54,109
complexified over time right so like if
you think at the original life uh

3292
01:02:54,109 --> 01:02:54,119
you think at the original life uh
 

3293
01:02:54,119 --> 01:02:56,390
you think at the original life uh
nothing on the planet could see

3294
01:02:56,390 --> 01:02:56,400
nothing on the planet could see
 

3295
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,269
nothing on the planet could see
mhm right so like for a long time life

3296
01:02:59,269 --> 01:02:59,279
mhm right so like for a long time life
 

3297
01:02:59,279 --> 01:03:01,670
mhm right so like for a long time life
had no sight um and then you know like

3298
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:01,680
had no sight um and then you know like
 

3299
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:05,510
had no sight um and then you know like
Photon receptors were invented and then

3300
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:05,520
Photon receptors were invented and then
 

3301
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,029
Photon receptors were invented and then
when multicellularity evolved those

3302
01:03:08,029 --> 01:03:08,039
when multicellularity evolved those
 

3303
01:03:08,039 --> 01:03:12,710
when multicellularity evolved those
cells eventually grew into eyes and we

3304
01:03:12,710 --> 01:03:12,720
cells eventually grew into eyes and we
 

3305
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,870
cells eventually grew into eyes and we
had the multicellular eye and then it's

3306
01:03:14,870 --> 01:03:14,880
had the multicellular eye and then it's
 

3307
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,430
had the multicellular eye and then it's
interesting when you get to societies

3308
01:03:16,430 --> 01:03:16,440
interesting when you get to societies
 

3309
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,910
interesting when you get to societies
like human societies that we invent even

3310
01:03:18,910 --> 01:03:18,920
like human societies that we invent even
 

3311
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,470
like human societies that we invent even
better Technologies of seeing like

3312
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:20,480
better Technologies of seeing like
 

3313
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,710
better Technologies of seeing like
telescopes and microscopes uh which

3314
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:22,720
telescopes and microscopes uh which
 

3315
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,549
telescopes and microscopes uh which
allow us to see deeper into the universe

3316
01:03:24,549 --> 01:03:24,559
allow us to see deeper into the universe
 

3317
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:27,950
allow us to see deeper into the universe
or at smaller scales um so I think I

3318
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:27,960
or at smaller scales um so I think I
 

3319
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:30,910
or at smaller scales um so I think I
think that's pretty profound the way

3320
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:30,920
think that's pretty profound the way
 

3321
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,950
think that's pretty profound the way
that site has

3322
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:32,960
that site has
 

3323
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:36,990
that site has
transformed the ability of life to

3324
01:03:36,990 --> 01:03:37,000
transformed the ability of life to
 

3325
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,710
transformed the ability of life to
literally see uh the reality in which

3326
01:03:39,710 --> 01:03:39,720
literally see uh the reality in which
 

3327
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:42,470
literally see uh the reality in which
it's existing in

3328
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:42,480
it's existing in
 

3329
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:46,109
it's existing in
um I think Consciousness is

3330
01:03:46,109 --> 01:03:46,119
um I think Consciousness is
 

3331
01:03:46,119 --> 01:03:49,549
um I think Consciousness is
also obviously deeply interesting I've

3332
01:03:49,549 --> 01:03:49,559
also obviously deeply interesting I've
 

3333
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:51,029
also obviously deeply interesting I've
gotten kind of obsessed with like

3334
01:03:51,029 --> 01:03:51,039
gotten kind of obsessed with like
 

3335
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,670
gotten kind of obsessed with like
octopus I don't like I they're just so

3336
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:53,680
octopus I don't like I they're just so
 

3337
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,870
octopus I don't like I they're just so
weird and the fact that like they

3338
01:03:55,870 --> 01:03:55,880
weird and the fact that like they
 

3339
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:58,069
weird and the fact that like they
evolved complex nervous systems kind of

3340
01:03:58,069 --> 01:03:58,079
evolved complex nervous systems kind of
 

3341
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:00,950
evolved complex nervous systems kind of
independently is like seems very alien

3342
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:00,960
independently is like seems very alien
 

3343
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,309
independently is like seems very alien
yeah there's a lot of alien like

3344
01:04:02,309 --> 01:04:02,319
yeah there's a lot of alien like
 

3345
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:05,029
yeah there's a lot of alien like
organisms that's another thing I saw in

3346
01:04:05,029 --> 01:04:05,039
organisms that's another thing I saw in
 

3347
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:06,190
organisms that's another thing I saw in
the

3348
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:06,200
the
 

3349
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:09,230
the
jungle yeah just things that are like oh

3350
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:09,240
jungle yeah just things that are like oh
 

3351
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:11,670
jungle yeah just things that are like oh
okay they make one of those huh they

3352
01:04:11,670 --> 01:04:11,680
okay they make one of those huh they
 

3353
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:13,109
okay they make one of those huh they
just feels like any

3354
01:04:13,109 --> 01:04:13,119
just feels like any
 

3355
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:16,430
just feels like any
examples there's a frog that's as as

3356
01:04:16,430 --> 01:04:16,440
examples there's a frog that's as as
 

3357
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:19,269
examples there's a frog that's as as
thin as a sheet of paper and I was like

3358
01:04:19,269 --> 01:04:19,279
thin as a sheet of paper and I was like
 

3359
01:04:19,279 --> 01:04:21,029
thin as a sheet of paper and I was like
what and it gives birth through like

3360
01:04:21,029 --> 01:04:21,039
what and it gives birth through like
 

3361
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:24,029
what and it gives birth through like
pores like oh I've seen videos of that

3362
01:04:24,029 --> 01:04:24,039
pores like oh I've seen videos of that
 

3363
01:04:24,039 --> 01:04:26,190
pores like oh I've seen videos of that
so gross when the babies come out did

3364
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:26,200
so gross when the babies come out did
 

3365
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,269
so gross when the babies come out did
you see that like like in person like

3366
01:04:28,269 --> 01:04:28,279
you see that like like in person like
 

3367
01:04:28,279 --> 01:04:31,430
you see that like like in person like
the babies coming out no I saw the uh

3368
01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:31,440
the babies coming out no I saw the uh
 

3369
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,950
the babies coming out no I saw the uh
without the have you seen videos of that

3370
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:32,960
without the have you seen videos of that
 

3371
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,990
without the have you seen videos of that
it's so gross it's one of the grossest

3372
01:04:34,990 --> 01:04:35,000
it's so gross it's one of the grossest
 

3373
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,750
it's so gross it's one of the grossest
things I've ever seen well so gross is

3374
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:38,760
things I've ever seen well so gross is
 

3375
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:41,670
things I've ever seen well so gross is
just the other side of beautiful I think

3376
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:41,680
just the other side of beautiful I think
 

3377
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,950
just the other side of beautiful I think
it's like oh wow that that's that's

3378
01:04:43,950 --> 01:04:43,960
it's like oh wow that that's that's
 

3379
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:45,470
it's like oh wow that that's that's
possible I guess if I was one of those

3380
01:04:45,470 --> 01:04:45,480
possible I guess if I was one of those
 

3381
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:46,710
possible I guess if I was one of those
frogs I would think that was the most

3382
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:46,720
frogs I would think that was the most
 

3383
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,670
frogs I would think that was the most
beautiful event I'd ever seen although

3384
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:48,680
beautiful event I'd ever seen although
 

3385
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:50,069
beautiful event I'd ever seen although
like human child birth is not that

3386
01:04:50,069 --> 01:04:50,079
like human child birth is not that
 

3387
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:53,109
like human child birth is not that
beautiful either yeah it's all a matter

3388
01:04:53,109 --> 01:04:53,119
beautiful either yeah it's all a matter
 

3389
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:55,150
beautiful either yeah it's all a matter
of perspective well we come to the world

3390
01:04:55,150 --> 01:04:55,160
of perspective well we come to the world
 

3391
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,269
of perspective well we come to the world
so vient

3392
01:04:56,269 --> 01:04:56,279
so vient
 

3393
01:04:56,279 --> 01:04:59,069
so vient
it's just like it's amazing well I mean

3394
01:04:59,069 --> 01:04:59,079
it's just like it's amazing well I mean
 

3395
01:04:59,079 --> 01:05:01,230
it's just like it's amazing well I mean
the world is a violent place yeah so

3396
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:01,240
the world is a violent place yeah so
 

3397
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:02,390
the world is a violent place yeah so
again

3398
01:05:02,390 --> 01:05:02,400
again
 

3399
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,430
again
another it's just another side of the

3400
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:04,440
another it's just another side of the
 

3401
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:06,069
another it's just another side of the
coin you know what this actually makes

3402
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:06,079
coin you know what this actually makes
 

3403
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:07,510
coin you know what this actually makes
me think of one that's not up there

3404
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:07,520
me think of one that's not up there
 

3405
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,029
me think of one that's not up there
which I do find really incredibly

3406
01:05:10,029 --> 01:05:10,039
which I do find really incredibly
 

3407
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:12,710
which I do find really incredibly
amazing is

3408
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:12,720
amazing is
 

3409
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:16,549
amazing is
um is the process of like the germline

3410
01:05:16,549 --> 01:05:16,559
um is the process of like the germline
 

3411
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:18,349
um is the process of like the germline
cell

3412
01:05:18,349 --> 01:05:18,359
cell
 

3413
01:05:18,359 --> 01:05:21,430
cell
in you know in organisms like basically

3414
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:21,440
in you know in organisms like basically
 

3415
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,309
in you know in organisms like basically
like every living thing on this planet

3416
01:05:23,309 --> 01:05:23,319
like every living thing on this planet
 

3417
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:24,789
like every living thing on this planet
at some point in its life has to go

3418
01:05:24,789 --> 01:05:24,799
at some point in its life has to go
 

3419
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:26,269
at some point in its life has to go
through a single cell

3420
01:05:26,269 --> 01:05:26,279
through a single cell
 

3421
01:05:26,279 --> 01:05:28,150
through a single cell
and this whole issue of like development

3422
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:28,160
and this whole issue of like development
 

3423
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:29,710
and this whole issue of like development
like the developmental program is kind

3424
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:29,720
like the developmental program is kind
 

3425
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:31,309
like the developmental program is kind
of crazy like how do you build you out

3426
01:05:31,309 --> 01:05:31,319
of crazy like how do you build you out
 

3427
01:05:31,319 --> 01:05:33,430
of crazy like how do you build you out
of a single cell how does a single cell

3428
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:33,440
of a single cell how does a single cell
 

3429
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,990
of a single cell how does a single cell
know how to do that like you know

3430
01:05:35,990 --> 01:05:36,000
know how to do that like you know
 

3431
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,710
know how to do that like you know
pattern formation of a multicellular

3432
01:05:37,710 --> 01:05:37,720
pattern formation of a multicellular
 

3433
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:40,269
pattern formation of a multicellular
organism obviously like evolves with DNA

3434
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:40,279
organism obviously like evolves with DNA
 

3435
01:05:40,279 --> 01:05:41,670
organism obviously like evolves with DNA
but there's a lot of stuff happening

3436
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:41,680
but there's a lot of stuff happening
 

3437
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,510
but there's a lot of stuff happening
there about when cells take on certain

3438
01:05:44,510 --> 01:05:44,520
there about when cells take on certain
 

3439
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:45,910
there about when cells take on certain
morphologies and things that people

3440
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:45,920
morphologies and things that people
 

3441
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,390
morphologies and things that people
don't understand like the actual shape

3442
01:05:47,390 --> 01:05:47,400
don't understand like the actual shape
 

3443
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,109
don't understand like the actual shape
formation mechanism and a lot of people

3444
01:05:49,109 --> 01:05:49,119
formation mechanism and a lot of people
 

3445
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:51,309
formation mechanism and a lot of people
study that and it's um and there's a lot

3446
01:05:51,309 --> 01:05:51,319
study that and it's um and there's a lot
 

3447
01:05:51,319 --> 01:05:53,789
study that and it's um and there's a lot
of advances being made now in that field

3448
01:05:53,789 --> 01:05:53,799
of advances being made now in that field
 

3449
01:05:53,799 --> 01:05:55,230
of advances being made now in that field
I think it's pretty shocking though that

3450
01:05:55,230 --> 01:05:55,240
I think it's pretty shocking though that
 

3451
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:57,150
I think it's pretty shocking though that
like how little we know about that

3452
01:05:57,150 --> 01:05:57,160
like how little we know about that
 

3453
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,349
like how little we know about that
process uh and often it's left off of

3454
01:05:59,349 --> 01:05:59,359
process uh and often it's left off of
 

3455
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:00,670
process uh and often it's left off of
people's list it's just kind of

3456
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:00,680
people's list it's just kind of
 

3457
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:03,430
people's list it's just kind of
interesting embryogenesis is fascinating

3458
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:03,440
interesting embryogenesis is fascinating
 

3459
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:05,269
interesting embryogenesis is fascinating
yeah because it you start from just one

3460
01:06:05,269 --> 01:06:05,279
yeah because it you start from just one
 

3461
01:06:05,279 --> 01:06:07,430
yeah because it you start from just one
cell yeah and the genes and all the

3462
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:07,440
cell yeah and the genes and all the
 

3463
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,630
cell yeah and the genes and all the
cells are the same right so like the

3464
01:06:09,630 --> 01:06:09,640
cells are the same right so like the
 

3465
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:11,870
cells are the same right so like the
differentiation has to

3466
01:06:11,870 --> 01:06:11,880
differentiation has to
 

3467
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:14,789
differentiation has to
be something that's like much more about

3468
01:06:14,789 --> 01:06:14,799
be something that's like much more about
 

3469
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:16,870
be something that's like much more about
like the actual

3470
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:16,880
like the actual
 

3471
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:20,069
like the actual
like you know expression of genes over

3472
01:06:20,069 --> 01:06:20,079
like you know expression of genes over
 

3473
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:22,150
like you know expression of genes over
time and like how they get switched on

3474
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:22,160
time and like how they get switched on
 

3475
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:23,390
time and like how they get switched on
and off and also the physical

3476
01:06:23,390 --> 01:06:23,400
and off and also the physical
 

3477
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,150
and off and also the physical
environment of like the cell interacting

3478
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:25,160
environment of like the cell interacting
 

3479
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:27,470
environment of like the cell interacting
with others cells and there there's just

3480
01:06:27,470 --> 01:06:27,480
with others cells and there there's just
 

3481
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:29,029
with others cells and there there's just
a lot of stuff going on yeah the

3482
01:06:29,029 --> 01:06:29,039
a lot of stuff going on yeah the
 

3483
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:31,390
a lot of stuff going on yeah the
computation the intelligence of that

3484
01:06:31,390 --> 01:06:31,400
computation the intelligence of that
 

3485
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:35,109
computation the intelligence of that
process yes might be like the most

3486
01:06:35,109 --> 01:06:35,119
process yes might be like the most
 

3487
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:36,510
process yes might be like the most
important thing to understand and we

3488
01:06:36,510 --> 01:06:36,520
important thing to understand and we
 

3489
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:38,309
important thing to understand and we
just kind of don't really think about it

3490
01:06:38,309 --> 01:06:38,319
just kind of don't really think about it
 

3491
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:40,670
just kind of don't really think about it
right we think about the final product

3492
01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:40,680
right we think about the final product
 

3493
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:44,190
right we think about the final product
yeah maybe the the key to understanding

3494
01:06:44,190 --> 01:06:44,200
yeah maybe the the key to understanding
 

3495
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,190
yeah maybe the the key to understanding
the organism is understanding that

3496
01:06:46,190 --> 01:06:46,200
the organism is understanding that
 

3497
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:49,430
the organism is understanding that
process not the final product probably

3498
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:49,440
process not the final product probably
 

3499
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,670
process not the final product probably
yes I think most of the things about

3500
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:51,680
yes I think most of the things about
 

3501
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:52,829
yes I think most of the things about
understanding anything about what we are

3502
01:06:52,829 --> 01:06:52,839
understanding anything about what we are
 

3503
01:06:52,839 --> 01:06:54,750
understanding anything about what we are
are embedded in time well of course you

3504
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:54,760
are embedded in time well of course you
 

3505
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,520
are embedded in time well of course you
would say that I know so

3506
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:56,530
would say that I know so
 

3507
01:06:56,530 --> 01:06:58,390
would say that I know so
[Laughter]

3508
01:06:58,390 --> 01:06:58,400
[Laughter]
 

3509
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,150
[Laughter]
predictable it's turning into a

3510
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:00,160
predictable it's turning into a
 

3511
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,589
predictable it's turning into a
deterministic universe it always has

3512
01:07:02,589 --> 01:07:02,599
deterministic universe it always has
 

3513
01:07:02,599 --> 01:07:05,430
deterministic universe it always has
been always was like the meme yeah

3514
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:05,440
been always was like the meme yeah
 

3515
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,630
been always was like the meme yeah
always was but it won't be in the future

3516
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:07,640
always was but it won't be in the future
 

3517
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:09,230
always was but it won't be in the future
well that's before we talk about the

3518
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:09,240
well that's before we talk about the
 

3519
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:10,710
well that's before we talk about the
future let's talk about the past the

3520
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:10,720
future let's talk about the past the
 

3521
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:13,670
future let's talk about the past the
assembly theory yes can you uh explain

3522
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:13,680
assembly theory yes can you uh explain
 

3523
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,910
assembly theory yes can you uh explain
assembly Theory to me I listened to Lee

3524
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:15,920
assembly Theory to me I listened to Lee
 

3525
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:17,630
assembly Theory to me I listened to Lee
talk about it for many hours and I

3526
01:07:17,630 --> 01:07:17,640
talk about it for many hours and I
 

3527
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,269
talk about it for many hours and I
understood nothing no I'm just kidding

3528
01:07:19,269 --> 01:07:19,279
understood nothing no I'm just kidding
 

3529
01:07:19,279 --> 01:07:22,029
understood nothing no I'm just kidding
uh I just wanted to take another you've

3530
01:07:22,029 --> 01:07:22,039
uh I just wanted to take another you've
 

3531
01:07:22,039 --> 01:07:24,109
uh I just wanted to take another you've
been already talking about it but just

3532
01:07:24,109 --> 01:07:24,119
been already talking about it but just
 

3533
01:07:24,119 --> 01:07:26,710
been already talking about it but just
just just another

3534
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:26,720
just just another
 

3535
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:30,589
just just another
just what from a big picture

3536
01:07:30,589 --> 01:07:30,599
just what from a big picture
 

3537
01:07:30,599 --> 01:07:34,670
just what from a big picture
view is the assembly Theory way of

3538
01:07:34,670 --> 01:07:34,680
view is the assembly Theory way of
 

3539
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:38,150
view is the assembly Theory way of
thinking about our world about our

3540
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:38,160
thinking about our world about our
 

3541
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:42,710
thinking about our world about our
universe yeah I think the uh first thing

3542
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:42,720
universe yeah I think the uh first thing
 

3543
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:46,269
universe yeah I think the uh first thing
is you know that like the observation

3544
01:07:46,269 --> 01:07:46,279
is you know that like the observation
 

3545
01:07:46,279 --> 01:07:49,190
is you know that like the observation
that uh life seems to be the only thing

3546
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:49,200
that uh life seems to be the only thing
 

3547
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,029
that uh life seems to be the only thing
the universe that builds complexity in

3548
01:07:51,029 --> 01:07:51,039
the universe that builds complexity in
 

3549
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:52,670
the universe that builds complexity in
the way that we see it here and

3550
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:52,680
the way that we see it here and
 

3551
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:54,630
the way that we see it here and
complexity is obviously like a loaded

3552
01:07:54,630 --> 01:07:54,640
complexity is obviously like a loaded
 

3553
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:57,589
complexity is obviously like a loaded
term so I'll just use assembly instead

3554
01:07:57,589 --> 01:07:57,599
term so I'll just use assembly instead
 

3555
01:07:57,599 --> 01:07:59,230
term so I'll just use assembly instead
uh because I think assembly is more

3556
01:07:59,230 --> 01:07:59,240
uh because I think assembly is more
 

3557
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:03,069
uh because I think assembly is more
precise um but the idea that like you

3558
01:08:03,069 --> 01:08:03,079
precise um but the idea that like you
 

3559
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:05,150
precise um but the idea that like you
know all the things on your desk here

3560
01:08:05,150 --> 01:08:05,160
know all the things on your desk here
 

3561
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:09,349
know all the things on your desk here
from your computer to the pen to uh you

3562
01:08:09,349 --> 01:08:09,359
from your computer to the pen to uh you
 

3563
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:10,950
from your computer to the pen to uh you
know us sitting here don't exist

3564
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:10,960
know us sitting here don't exist
 

3565
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,309
know us sitting here don't exist
anywhere else in the universe as far as

3566
01:08:12,309 --> 01:08:12,319
anywhere else in the universe as far as
 

3567
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:14,549
anywhere else in the universe as far as
we know they only exist on this planet

3568
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:14,559
we know they only exist on this planet
 

3569
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:16,070
we know they only exist on this planet
and it took a long evolutionary history

3570
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:16,080
and it took a long evolutionary history
 

3571
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:20,110
and it took a long evolutionary history
to get to us um is a real feature that

3572
01:08:20,110 --> 01:08:20,120
to get to us um is a real feature that
 

3573
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:22,510
to get to us um is a real feature that
we should take seriously as one that's

3574
01:08:22,510 --> 01:08:22,520
we should take seriously as one that's
 

3575
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,829
we should take seriously as one that's
deeply embedded in the laws of physics

3576
01:08:24,829 --> 01:08:24,839
deeply embedded in the laws of physics
 

3577
01:08:24,839 --> 01:08:26,309
deeply embedded in the laws of physics
and the structure the universe that we

3578
01:08:26,309 --> 01:08:26,319
and the structure the universe that we
 

3579
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:28,870
and the structure the universe that we
live in uh standard physics would say

3580
01:08:28,870 --> 01:08:28,880
live in uh standard physics would say
 

3581
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,349
live in uh standard physics would say
that you know all of that complexity

3582
01:08:30,349 --> 01:08:30,359
that you know all of that complexity
 

3583
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:32,550
that you know all of that complexity
traces back to

3584
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:32,560
traces back to
 

3585
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,269
traces back to
the

3586
01:08:34,269 --> 01:08:34,279
the
 

3587
01:08:34,279 --> 01:08:36,550
the
infinitesimal uh deviations and like the

3588
01:08:36,550 --> 01:08:36,560
infinitesimal uh deviations and like the
 

3589
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:37,789
infinitesimal uh deviations and like the
initial state of the universe that there

3590
01:08:37,789 --> 01:08:37,799
initial state of the universe that there
 

3591
01:08:37,799 --> 01:08:39,950
initial state of the universe that there
was some order there um I find that

3592
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:39,960
was some order there um I find that
 

3593
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:42,829
was some order there um I find that
deeply unsatisfactory and uh what

3594
01:08:42,829 --> 01:08:42,839
deeply unsatisfactory and uh what
 

3595
01:08:42,839 --> 01:08:45,789
deeply unsatisfactory and uh what
assembly Theory says uh that's very

3596
01:08:45,789 --> 01:08:45,799
assembly Theory says uh that's very
 

3597
01:08:45,799 --> 01:08:47,870
assembly Theory says uh that's very
different is

3598
01:08:47,870 --> 01:08:47,880
different is
 

3599
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:51,030
different is
that the universe is basically

3600
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:51,040
that the universe is basically
 

3601
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:54,829
that the universe is basically
constructing itself and when you get to

3602
01:08:54,829 --> 01:08:54,839
constructing itself and when you get to
 

3603
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:57,430
constructing itself and when you get to
these common torial spaces like

3604
01:08:57,430 --> 01:08:57,440
these common torial spaces like
 

3605
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:59,470
these common torial spaces like
chemistry uh where the space of

01:08:59,470 --> 01:08:59,480
chemistry uh where the space of
 

3607
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:01,550
chemistry uh where the space of
possibilities is too large to exhaust

3609
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:05,430
possibilities is too large to exhaust
them all um you can only construct

3610
01:09:05,430 --> 01:09:05,440
them all um you can only construct
 

3611
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:08,390
them all um you can only construct

01:09:19,070 --> 01:09:19,080
uh and that this is the way that complex
 

3621
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:20,829
uh and that this is the way that complex

01:09:35,149 --> 01:09:35,159
implications as far as what you think um
 

3635
01:09:35,159 --> 01:09:37,070
implications as far as what you think um
is the nature of the physics that would

3636
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:37,080
is the nature of the physics that would
 

3637
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:40,030
is the nature of the physics that would
describe life and so what a assembly

3638
01:09:40,030 --> 01:09:40,040
describe life and so what a assembly

the object Did You observe and the
 

3663
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:08,470

of recursive steps to make it so if you
 

3667
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:14,870
of recursive steps to make it so if you
start from elementary building blocks

01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:14,880
start from elementary building blocks
 

3669
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,750
start from elementary building blocks
like bonds for molecules and you put

3670
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:17,760
like bonds for molecules and you put
 

3671
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,350
like bonds for molecules and you put
them together and then you take things

3672
01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:19,360
them together and then you take things
 

3673
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:21,070
them together and then you take things
you've made already and build up to the

01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:31,470
Lee's been able to show in the lab with
his team is that for organic

01:10:31,470 --> 01:10:31,480
his team is that for organic
 

3683
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:34,550

chemistry uh it's about 15 Steps and

3684
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:34,560
chemistry uh it's about 15 Steps and
 

3685
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:38,110
chemistry uh it's about 15 Steps and
then you only see molecules uh that you

3686
01:10:38,110 --> 01:10:38,120
then you only see molecules uh that you
 

3687
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:40,750
then you only see molecules uh that you
know the only molecules that we observe

01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:40,760
know the only molecules that we observe
 

3689
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,590

that are past that threshold are ones

3690
01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:42,600
that are past that threshold are ones
 

3691
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:45,750
that are past that threshold are ones
that are are in life and in fact one of

that are are in life and in fact one of
 

3693
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:46,790
that are are in life and in fact one of
the things I'm trying to do with this

01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:46,800
the things I'm trying to do with this
 

3695
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,430
the things I'm trying to do with this
idea of like trying to actually quantify

3696
01:10:48,430 --> 01:10:48,440
idea of like trying to actually quantify
 

3697
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:51,189
idea of like trying to actually quantify
the origin of Life as a transition in

3698
01:10:51,189 --> 01:10:51,199
the origin of Life as a transition in
 

3699
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:53,189
the origin of Life as a transition in
like a phase transition assembly theory

3700
01:10:53,189 --> 01:10:53,199
like a phase transition assembly theory
 

3701
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:56,350
like a phase transition assembly theory
is actually be able to um explain why

3702
01:10:56,350 --> 01:10:56,360
is actually be able to um explain why
 

3703
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:58,189
is actually be able to um explain why
that boundary is where it is because I

3704
01:10:58,189 --> 01:10:58,199
that boundary is where it is because I
 

3705
01:10:58,199 --> 01:10:59,830
that boundary is where it is because I
think that's actually the boundary that

3706
01:10:59,830 --> 01:10:59,840
think that's actually the boundary that
 

3707
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:02,070
think that's actually the boundary that
life must cross so the idea of going

3708
01:11:02,070 --> 01:11:02,080
life must cross so the idea of going
 

3709
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,430
life must cross so the idea of going
back to this thing we're talking about

3710
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:03,440
back to this thing we're talking about
 

3711
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,470
back to this thing we're talking about
before about these these structures that

3712
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:05,480
before about these these structures that
 

3713
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:07,070
before about these these structures that
can reinforce their own existence and

3714
01:11:07,070 --> 01:11:07,080
can reinforce their own existence and
 

3715
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:09,669
can reinforce their own existence and
move past that boundary uh 15 seems to

3716
01:11:09,669 --> 01:11:09,679
move past that boundary uh 15 seems to
 

3717
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:12,070
move past that boundary uh 15 seems to
be that boundary in chemical space uh

3718
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:12,080
be that boundary in chemical space uh
 

3719
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,590
be that boundary in chemical space uh
it's not a universal number it will be

3720
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:13,600
it's not a universal number it will be
 

3721
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:16,110
it's not a universal number it will be
different for different assembly spaces

3722
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:16,120
different for different assembly spaces
 

3723
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:17,750
different for different assembly spaces
um but that's what we've experimentally

3724
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:17,760
um but that's what we've experimentally
 

3725
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:20,350
um but that's what we've experimentally
validated so far and then so literally

3726
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:20,360
validated so far and then so literally
 

3727
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:23,189
validated so far and then so literally
15 like the assembly index is 15 it's 15

3728
01:11:23,189 --> 01:11:23,199
15 like the assembly index is 15 it's 15
 

3729
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:25,870
15 like the assembly index is 15 it's 15
or so for the experimental data yeah so

3730
01:11:25,870 --> 01:11:25,880
or so for the experimental data yeah so
 

3731
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:28,110
or so for the experimental data yeah so
that's when you start getting the

3732
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:28,120
that's when you start getting the
 

3733
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,430
that's when you start getting the
self-reinforcing that's when you have to

3734
01:11:30,430 --> 01:11:30,440
self-reinforcing that's when you have to
 

3735
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:32,630
self-reinforcing that's when you have to
have that feature in order for to

3736
01:11:32,630 --> 01:11:32,640
have that feature in order for to
 

3737
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,990
have that feature in order for to
observe molecules in high abundance in

3738
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:35,000
observe molecules in high abundance in
 

3739
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,629
observe molecules in high abundance in
that space so the copy number is the the

3740
01:11:37,629 --> 01:11:37,639
that space so the copy number is the the
 

3741
01:11:37,639 --> 01:11:39,390
that space so the copy number is the the
number of exact copies that's what you

3742
01:11:39,390 --> 01:11:39,400
number of exact copies that's what you
 

3743
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:41,830
number of exact copies that's what you
mean by high abundance and assembly

3744
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:41,840
mean by high abundance and assembly
 

3745
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,750
mean by high abundance and assembly
index or the complexity of the object is

3746
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:44,760
index or the complexity of the object is
 

3747
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:46,510
index or the complexity of the object is
how many steps it took to create it

3748
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:46,520
how many steps it took to create it
 

3749
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:49,709
how many steps it took to create it
recursive recursive yeah so you can

3750
01:11:49,709 --> 01:11:49,719
recursive recursive yeah so you can
 

3751
01:11:49,719 --> 01:11:51,310
recursive recursive yeah so you can
think of objects in assembly theory is

3752
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:51,320
think of objects in assembly theory is
 

3753
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:54,149
think of objects in assembly theory is
basically recursive stacks of the the

3754
01:11:54,149 --> 01:11:54,159
basically recursive stacks of the the
 

3755
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:56,709
basically recursive stacks of the the
construction steps to build them so

3756
01:11:56,709 --> 01:11:56,719
construction steps to build them so
 

3757
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:58,709
construction steps to build them so
they're like it's like I you take this

3758
01:11:58,709 --> 01:11:58,719
they're like it's like I you take this
 

3759
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:00,070
they're like it's like I you take this
step and then you make this object and

3760
01:12:00,070 --> 01:12:00,080
step and then you make this object and
 

3761
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,390
step and then you make this object and
you make it this object and make this

3762
01:12:01,390 --> 01:12:01,400
you make it this object and make this
 

3763
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:02,830
you make it this object and make this
object and then you get up to the final

3764
01:12:02,830 --> 01:12:02,840
object and then you get up to the final
 

3765
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:04,470
object and then you get up to the final
object but that object is all of that

3766
01:12:04,470 --> 01:12:04,480
object but that object is all of that
 

3767
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,229
object but that object is all of that
history rolled up into the current

3768
01:12:06,229 --> 01:12:06,239
history rolled up into the current
 

3769
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:07,950
history rolled up into the current
structure what if you took the long way

3770
01:12:07,950 --> 01:12:07,960
structure what if you took the long way
 

3771
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:10,750
structure what if you took the long way
home the you can't take the long way why

3772
01:12:10,750 --> 01:12:10,760
home the you can't take the long way why
 

3773
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:13,030
home the you can't take the long way why
not the long way doesn't exist it's a

3774
01:12:13,030 --> 01:12:13,040
not the long way doesn't exist it's a
 

3775
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,750
not the long way doesn't exist it's a
good song though uh what do you mean the

3776
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:15,760
good song though uh what do you mean the
 

3777
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,990
good song though uh what do you mean the
long way doesn't exist if I do if I do a

3778
01:12:17,990 --> 01:12:18,000
long way doesn't exist if I do if I do a
 

3779
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,669
long way doesn't exist if I do if I do a
random walk from A to B I'll eventually

3780
01:12:21,669 --> 01:12:21,679
random walk from A to B I'll eventually
 

3781
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:23,270
random walk from A to B I'll eventually
if I start at a I'll eventually end up

3782
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:23,280
if I start at a I'll eventually end up
 

3783
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:26,390
if I start at a I'll eventually end up
at B and that random walk be

3784
01:12:26,390 --> 01:12:26,400
at B and that random walk be
 

3785
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,590
at B and that random walk be
longer than the no if you look at

3786
01:12:28,590 --> 01:12:28,600
longer than the no if you look at
 

3787
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:31,750
longer than the no if you look at
objects and you so the we we Define

3788
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:31,760
objects and you so the we we Define
 

3789
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:33,270
objects and you so the we we Define
something we call the assembly universe

3790
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:33,280
something we call the assembly universe
 

3791
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:35,189
something we call the assembly universe
and the assembly universe is ordered in

3792
01:12:35,189 --> 01:12:35,199
and the assembly universe is ordered in
 

3793
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:36,750
and the assembly universe is ordered in
time it's actually ordered in in the

3794
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:36,760
time it's actually ordered in in the
 

3795
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:38,470
time it's actually ordered in in the
causation the number of steps to produce

3796
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:38,480
causation the number of steps to produce
 

3797
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,750
causation the number of steps to produce
an object and so all objects in the

3798
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:40,760
an object and so all objects in the
 

3799
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:44,470
an object and so all objects in the
universe are in some sense um existed a

3800
01:12:44,470 --> 01:12:44,480
universe are in some sense um existed a
 

3801
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:46,750
universe are in some sense um existed a
layer that's defined by their assembly

3802
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:46,760
layer that's defined by their assembly
 

3803
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:49,990
layer that's defined by their assembly
index um and the size of each layer is

3804
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:50,000
index um and the size of each layer is
 

3805
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,629
index um and the size of each layer is
growing

3806
01:12:51,629 --> 01:12:51,639
growing
 

3807
01:12:51,639 --> 01:12:53,750
growing
exponentially so what you're talking

3808
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:53,760
exponentially so what you're talking
 

3809
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,430
exponentially so what you're talking
about if you want to look at the long

3810
01:12:55,430 --> 01:12:55,440
about if you want to look at the long
 

3811
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,350
about if you want to look at the long
way of getting to an object as I'm

3812
01:12:57,350 --> 01:12:57,360
way of getting to an object as I'm
 

3813
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:58,910
way of getting to an object as I'm
increasing the assembly index of an

3814
01:12:58,910 --> 01:12:58,920
increasing the assembly index of an
 

3815
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,709
increasing the assembly index of an
object I'm moving deeper and deeper into

3816
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:00,719
object I'm moving deeper and deeper into
 

3817
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:03,470
object I'm moving deeper and deeper into
an exponentially growing space and it's

3818
01:13:03,470 --> 01:13:03,480
an exponentially growing space and it's
 

3819
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:05,709
an exponentially growing space and it's
actually also the case that the sort of

3820
01:13:05,709 --> 01:13:05,719
actually also the case that the sort of
 

3821
01:13:05,719 --> 01:13:08,270
actually also the case that the sort of
typical path to get to that object is

3822
01:13:08,270 --> 01:13:08,280
typical path to get to that object is
 

3823
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:09,990
typical path to get to that object is
also exponentially growing with respect

3824
01:13:09,990 --> 01:13:10,000
also exponentially growing with respect
 

3825
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,189
also exponentially growing with respect
to the assembly index and so if you want

3826
01:13:13,189 --> 01:13:13,199
to the assembly index and so if you want
 

3827
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:14,870
to the assembly index and so if you want
to try to make a more and more complex

3828
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:14,880
to try to make a more and more complex
 

3829
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,669
to try to make a more and more complex
object and you want to do it by a a a

3830
01:13:17,669 --> 01:13:17,679
object and you want to do it by a a a
 

3831
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:19,350
object and you want to do it by a a a
typical path that's actually an

3832
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:19,360
typical path that's actually an
 

3833
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:21,910
typical path that's actually an
exponentially receding Horizon and so

3834
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:21,920
exponentially receding Horizon and so
 

3835
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:23,590
exponentially receding Horizon and so
most objects that come into existence

3836
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:23,600
most objects that come into existence
 

3837
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,470
most objects that come into existence
have to be causally very similar to the

3838
01:13:25,470 --> 01:13:25,480
have to be causally very similar to the
 

3839
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:26,870
have to be causally very similar to the
things that exist cuz they're close by

3840
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:26,880
things that exist cuz they're close by
 

3841
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,310
things that exist cuz they're close by
in that space and they can actually get

3842
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:28,320
in that space and they can actually get
 

3843
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,189
in that space and they can actually get
to it by an almost shortest path for

3844
01:13:30,189 --> 01:13:30,199
to it by an almost shortest path for
 

3845
01:13:30,199 --> 01:13:31,750
to it by an almost shortest path for
that object yeah the the almost shortest

3846
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:31,760
that object yeah the the almost shortest
 

3847
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:35,189
that object yeah the the almost shortest
path is the most likely and like by a

3848
01:13:35,189 --> 01:13:35,199
path is the most likely and like by a
 

3849
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:38,830
path is the most likely and like by a
lot by a lot okay so if you see a high

3850
01:13:38,830 --> 01:13:38,840
lot by a lot okay so if you see a high
 

3851
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:41,709
lot by a lot okay so if you see a high
copy number yeah imagine greater than

3852
01:13:41,709 --> 01:13:41,719
copy number yeah imagine greater than
 

3853
01:13:41,719 --> 01:13:44,110
copy number yeah imagine greater than
one yeah I mean basically we live the

3854
01:13:44,110 --> 01:13:44,120
one yeah I mean basically we live the
 

3855
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:47,149
one yeah I mean basically we live the
more complex we get we live in a a space

3856
01:13:47,149 --> 01:13:47,159
more complex we get we live in a a space
 

3857
01:13:47,159 --> 01:13:50,750
more complex we get we live in a a space
that is growing exponentially large and

3858
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:50,760
that is growing exponentially large and
 

3859
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,590
that is growing exponentially large and
the the ways of getting to objects in

3860
01:13:52,590 --> 01:13:52,600
the the ways of getting to objects in
 

3861
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:54,430
the the ways of getting to objects in
the space are also growing exponentially

3862
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:54,440
the space are also growing exponentially
 

3863
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:58,629
the space are also growing exponentially
large and so we're this kind of uh

3864
01:13:58,629 --> 01:13:58,639
large and so we're this kind of uh
 

3865
01:13:58,639 --> 01:14:01,790
large and so we're this kind of uh
recursively like stacked structure of

3866
01:14:01,790 --> 01:14:01,800
recursively like stacked structure of
 

3867
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,750
recursively like stacked structure of
like all of these objects that are

3868
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:03,760
like all of these objects that are
 

3869
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:06,390
like all of these objects that are
Clinging On to each other for existence

3870
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:06,400
Clinging On to each other for existence
 

3871
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,030
Clinging On to each other for existence
and then they like grab something else

3872
01:14:08,030 --> 01:14:08,040
and then they like grab something else
 

3873
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:09,590
and then they like grab something else
and are allow like able to bring that

3874
01:14:09,590 --> 01:14:09,600
and are allow like able to bring that
 

3875
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:10,790
and are allow like able to bring that
thing into existence because it's kind

3876
01:14:10,790 --> 01:14:10,800
thing into existence because it's kind
 

3877
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:13,070
thing into existence because it's kind
of similar to them but there is a face

3878
01:14:13,070 --> 01:14:13,080
of similar to them but there is a face
 

3879
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,590
of similar to them but there is a face
transition there is a there is a

3880
01:14:14,590 --> 01:14:14,600
transition there is a there is a
 

3881
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,310
transition there is a there is a
transition there is a place where you

3882
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:16,320
transition there is a place where you
 

3883
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:17,790
transition there is a place where you
would say oh that's I think it's

3884
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:17,800
would say oh that's I think it's
 

3885
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:19,189
would say oh that's I think it's
actually abrupt I've never been able to

3886
01:14:19,189 --> 01:14:19,199
actually abrupt I've never been able to
 

3887
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:20,910
actually abrupt I've never been able to
say that in in my entire career before

3888
01:14:20,910 --> 01:14:20,920
say that in in my entire career before
 

3889
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:22,229
say that in in my entire career before
I've always gone back and forth about

3890
01:14:22,229 --> 01:14:22,239
I've always gone back and forth about
 

3891
01:14:22,239 --> 01:14:23,470
I've always gone back and forth about
whether the original life was kind of

3892
01:14:23,470 --> 01:14:23,480
whether the original life was kind of
 

3893
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:24,669
whether the original life was kind of
gradual or abrupt I think it's very

3894
01:14:24,669 --> 01:14:24,679
gradual or abrupt I think it's very
 

3895
01:14:24,679 --> 01:14:25,910
gradual or abrupt I think it's very
abrupt

3896
01:14:25,910 --> 01:14:25,920
abrupt
 

3897
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:29,149
abrupt
uh poetically literally with snaps okay

3898
01:14:29,149 --> 01:14:29,159
uh poetically literally with snaps okay
 

3899
01:14:29,159 --> 01:14:31,870
uh poetically literally with snaps okay
that's very snaps okay we'll be poetic

3900
01:14:31,870 --> 01:14:31,880
that's very snaps okay we'll be poetic
 

3901
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:33,950
that's very snaps okay we'll be poetic
today but no I think there's like a lot

3902
01:14:33,950 --> 01:14:33,960
today but no I think there's like a lot
 

3903
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:36,310
today but no I think there's like a lot
of random exploration and then there's

3904
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:36,320
of random exploration and then there's
 

3905
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:37,669
of random exploration and then there's
like and then the structure the

3906
01:14:37,669 --> 01:14:37,679
like and then the structure the
 

3907
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:39,910
like and then the structure the
possibility space just collapses on the

3908
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:39,920
possibility space just collapses on the
 

3909
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:42,430
possibility space just collapses on the
structure kind of really fast um that

3910
01:14:42,430 --> 01:14:42,440
structure kind of really fast um that
 

3911
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,149
structure kind of really fast um that
can reinforce its own existence because

3912
01:14:44,149 --> 01:14:44,159
can reinforce its own existence because
 

3913
01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:46,149
can reinforce its own existence because
it's basically fighting against

3914
01:14:46,149 --> 01:14:46,159
it's basically fighting against
 

3915
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:49,790
it's basically fighting against
non-existence yeah you uh tweeted the

3916
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:49,800
non-existence yeah you uh tweeted the
 

3917
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:52,390
non-existence yeah you uh tweeted the
most significant struggle for existence

3918
01:14:52,390 --> 01:14:52,400
most significant struggle for existence
 

3919
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,390
most significant struggle for existence
in The evolutionary process is not among

3920
01:14:54,390 --> 01:14:54,400
in The evolutionary process is not among
 

3921
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,990
in The evolutionary process is not among
the objects that do exist but between

3922
01:14:56,990 --> 01:14:57,000
the objects that do exist but between
 

3923
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,510
the objects that do exist but between
the ones that do and those that never

3924
01:14:59,510 --> 01:14:59,520
the ones that do and those that never
 

3925
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,709
the ones that do and those that never
have the chance to this is where

3926
01:15:01,709 --> 01:15:01,719
have the chance to this is where
 

3927
01:15:01,719 --> 01:15:05,350
have the chance to this is where
selection does most of its C cause of

3928
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:05,360
selection does most of its C cause of
 

3929
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:08,830
selection does most of its C cause of
work the the objects that never get a

3930
01:15:08,830 --> 01:15:08,840
work the the objects that never get a
 

3931
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,310
work the the objects that never get a
chance to exist yeah the struggle

3932
01:15:11,310 --> 01:15:11,320
chance to exist yeah the struggle
 

3933
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:12,590
chance to exist yeah the struggle
between the ones that never get a chance

3934
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:12,600
between the ones that never get a chance
 

3935
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:14,830
between the ones that never get a chance
to exist and the ones that okay what

3936
01:15:14,830 --> 01:15:14,840
to exist and the ones that okay what
 

3937
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,910
to exist and the ones that okay what
what's that line exactly I don't know we

3938
01:15:16,910 --> 01:15:16,920
what's that line exactly I don't know we
 

3939
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,629
what's that line exactly I don't know we
can make songs out of all of these what

3940
01:15:18,629 --> 01:15:18,639
can make songs out of all of these what
 

3941
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:20,149
can make songs out of all of these what
are the objects that never get a chance

3942
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:20,159
are the objects that never get a chance
 

3943
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:21,830
are the objects that never get a chance
to exist what does that mean so there

3944
01:15:21,830 --> 01:15:21,840
to exist what does that mean so there
 

3945
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:24,390
to exist what does that mean so there
was there was this uh website I forgot

3946
01:15:24,390 --> 01:15:24,400
was there was this uh website I forgot
 

3947
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,870
was there was this uh website I forgot
what it was but it's like it's like a a

3948
01:15:26,870 --> 01:15:26,880
what it was but it's like it's like a a
 

3949
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,390
what it was but it's like it's like a a
neural network that just generates a

3950
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:28,400
neural network that just generates a
 

3951
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,270
neural network that just generates a
human face and it's like this person

3952
01:15:30,270 --> 01:15:30,280
human face and it's like this person
 

3953
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:31,590
human face and it's like this person
does not exist I think that's what it's

3954
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:31,600
does not exist I think that's what it's
 

3955
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:32,790
does not exist I think that's what it's
called right so you can just click on

3956
01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:32,800
called right so you can just click on
 

3957
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,310
called right so you can just click on
that all day and you can look at people

3958
01:15:34,310 --> 01:15:34,320
that all day and you can look at people
 

3959
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,430
that all day and you can look at people
all day that don't exist yeah all of

3960
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:36,440
all day that don't exist yeah all of
 

3961
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:38,070
all day that don't exist yeah all of
those people exist in that space of

3962
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:38,080
those people exist in that space of
 

3963
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:39,390
those people exist in that space of
things that don't

3964
01:15:39,390 --> 01:15:39,400
things that don't
 

3965
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:43,390
things that don't
exist yeah but there's uh the real

3966
01:15:43,390 --> 01:15:43,400
exist yeah but there's uh the real
 

3967
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:46,110
exist yeah but there's uh the real
struggle yeah so the struggle of of the

3968
01:15:46,110 --> 01:15:46,120
struggle yeah so the struggle of of the
 

3969
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:48,270
struggle yeah so the struggle of of the
quote the struggle of for existence is

3970
01:15:48,270 --> 01:15:48,280
quote the struggle of for existence is
 

3971
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:49,390
quote the struggle of for existence is
you know that goes all the way back to

3972
01:15:49,390 --> 01:15:49,400
you know that goes all the way back to
 

3973
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:51,470
you know that goes all the way back to
Darwin's writing about natural selection

3974
01:15:51,470 --> 01:15:51,480
Darwin's writing about natural selection
 

3975
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:52,990
Darwin's writing about natural selection
right so like the whole idea of survival

3976
01:15:52,990 --> 01:15:53,000
right so like the whole idea of survival
 

3977
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,550
right so like the whole idea of survival
of the fittest is everything struggling

3978
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:54,560
of the fittest is everything struggling
 

3979
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:57,430
of the fittest is everything struggling
to exist this Predator prey Dynamic um

3980
01:15:57,430 --> 01:15:57,440
to exist this Predator prey Dynamic um
 

3981
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:00,750
to exist this Predator prey Dynamic um
and and the fittest survive and so the

3982
01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:00,760
and and the fittest survive and so the
 

3983
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:02,510
and and the fittest survive and so the
struggle for existence is really what

3984
01:16:02,510 --> 01:16:02,520
struggle for existence is really what
 

3985
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:05,629
struggle for existence is really what
selection is all about but you're and

3986
01:16:05,629 --> 01:16:05,639
selection is all about but you're and
 

3987
01:16:05,639 --> 01:16:10,110
selection is all about but you're and
that's true uh we do see things that do

3988
01:16:10,110 --> 01:16:10,120
that's true uh we do see things that do
 

3989
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:13,910
that's true uh we do see things that do
exist competing to continue to exist um

3990
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:13,920
exist competing to continue to exist um
 

3991
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,390
exist competing to continue to exist um
but each time that like if you think

3992
01:16:16,390 --> 01:16:16,400
but each time that like if you think
 

3993
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:19,590
but each time that like if you think
about this space of possibilities and

3994
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:19,600
about this space of possibilities and
 

3995
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,189
about this space of possibilities and
you know each time the universe you know

3996
01:16:22,189 --> 01:16:22,199
you know each time the universe you know
 

3997
01:16:22,199 --> 01:16:24,590
you know each time the universe you know
generates a new structure like a an an

3998
01:16:24,590 --> 01:16:24,600
generates a new structure like a an an
 

3999
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:25,430
generates a new structure like a an an
object

4000
01:16:25,430 --> 01:16:25,440
object
 

4001
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:27,870
object
that exists generates a new structure

4002
01:16:27,870 --> 01:16:27,880
that exists generates a new structure
 

4003
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:31,030
that exists generates a new structure
along this causal chain it's generating

4004
01:16:31,030 --> 01:16:31,040
along this causal chain it's generating
 

4005
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:33,669
along this causal chain it's generating
something that exists that never existed

4006
01:16:33,669 --> 01:16:33,679
something that exists that never existed
 

4007
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:36,709
something that exists that never existed
before and each time that we make that

4008
01:16:36,709 --> 01:16:36,719
before and each time that we make that
 

4009
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:38,870
before and each time that we make that
kind of decision we're excluding a huge

4010
01:16:38,870 --> 01:16:38,880
kind of decision we're excluding a huge
 

4011
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:41,149
kind of decision we're excluding a huge
space of possibilities and so actually

4012
01:16:41,149 --> 01:16:41,159
space of possibilities and so actually
 

4013
01:16:41,159 --> 01:16:42,669
space of possibilities and so actually
like as this process of increasing

4014
01:16:42,669 --> 01:16:42,679
like as this process of increasing
 

4015
01:16:42,679 --> 01:16:45,390
like as this process of increasing
assembly index it's not just that like

4016
01:16:45,390 --> 01:16:45,400
assembly index it's not just that like
 

4017
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:47,790
assembly index it's not just that like
the space that these objects exist in is

4018
01:16:47,790 --> 01:16:47,800
the space that these objects exist in is
 

4019
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,470
the space that these objects exist in is
exponentially growing but there are

4020
01:16:49,470 --> 01:16:49,480
exponentially growing but there are
 

4021
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:52,629
exponentially growing but there are
there are objects in that space that are

4022
01:16:52,629 --> 01:16:52,639
there are objects in that space that are
 

4023
01:16:52,639 --> 01:16:55,070
there are objects in that space that are
exponentially receding away from us so

4024
01:16:55,070 --> 01:16:55,080
exponentially receding away from us so
 

4025
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:56,950
exponentially receding away from us so
they're becoming exponentially less and

4026
01:16:56,950 --> 01:16:56,960
they're becoming exponentially less and
 

4027
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:59,830
they're becoming exponentially less and
less likely to ever exist and so

4028
01:16:59,830 --> 01:16:59,840
less likely to ever exist and so
 

4029
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:02,790
less likely to ever exist and so
existence excludes a huge number of

4030
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:02,800
existence excludes a huge number of
 

4031
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,270
existence excludes a huge number of
things just because of the accident of

4032
01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:05,280
things just because of the accident of
 

4033
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:08,390
things just because of the accident of
History how it ended up yeah it's it it

4034
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:08,400
History how it ended up yeah it's it it
 

4035
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,350
History how it ended up yeah it's it it
is in part an accident because I think I

4036
01:17:10,350 --> 01:17:10,360
is in part an accident because I think I
 

4037
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:11,830
is in part an accident because I think I
think some of the the structure that

4038
01:17:11,830 --> 01:17:11,840
think some of the the structure that
 

4039
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:15,709
think some of the the structure that
gets generated is is driven a bit by

4040
01:17:15,709 --> 01:17:15,719
gets generated is is driven a bit by
 

4041
01:17:15,719 --> 01:17:18,030
gets generated is is driven a bit by
Randomness um I think a lot of it you

4042
01:17:18,030 --> 01:17:18,040
Randomness um I think a lot of it you
 

4043
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:19,870
Randomness um I think a lot of it you
know so uh you know one of the

4044
01:17:19,870 --> 01:17:19,880
know so uh you know one of the
 

4045
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:21,390
know so uh you know one of the
conceptions that we have in assembly

4046
01:17:21,390 --> 01:17:21,400
conceptions that we have in assembly
 

4047
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,510
conceptions that we have in assembly
theory is you know the universe is

4048
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:23,520
theory is you know the universe is
 

4049
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,149
theory is you know the universe is
random at its base you can see in

4050
01:17:25,149 --> 01:17:25,159
random at its base you can see in
 

4051
01:17:25,159 --> 01:17:26,750
random at its base you can see in
chemistry like unconstrained chemical

4052
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:26,760
chemistry like unconstrained chemical
 

4053
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:30,110
chemistry like unconstrained chemical
reactions are pretty random uh and then

4054
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:30,120
reactions are pretty random uh and then
 

4055
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:33,149
reactions are pretty random uh and then
and also quantum mechanics you know like

4056
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:33,159
and also quantum mechanics you know like
 

4057
01:17:33,159 --> 01:17:34,390
and also quantum mechanics you know like
there's less places that that give

4058
01:17:34,390 --> 01:17:34,400
there's less places that that give
 

4059
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,390
there's less places that that give
evidence for that um and deterministic

4060
01:17:37,390 --> 01:17:37,400
evidence for that um and deterministic
 

4061
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,070
evidence for that um and deterministic
structures emerge by things that can

4062
01:17:39,070 --> 01:17:39,080
structures emerge by things that can
 

4063
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:41,270
structures emerge by things that can
causally reinforce themselves and

4064
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:41,280
causally reinforce themselves and
 

4065
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:45,790
causally reinforce themselves and
maintain persistence over time and so we

4066
01:17:45,790 --> 01:17:45,800
maintain persistence over time and so we
 

4067
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,229
maintain persistence over time and so we
are some of the most deterministic

4068
01:17:47,229 --> 01:17:47,239
are some of the most deterministic
 

4069
01:17:47,239 --> 01:17:49,790
are some of the most deterministic
things in the universe and so like we

4070
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:49,800
things in the universe and so like we
 

4071
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:51,750
things in the universe and so like we
can generate very regular structure and

4072
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:51,760
can generate very regular structure and
 

4073
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:54,110
can generate very regular structure and
we can generate new structure along a

4074
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:54,120
we can generate new structure along a
 

4075
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:56,070
we can generate new structure along a
particular linear aged but the

4076
01:17:56,070 --> 01:17:56,080
particular linear aged but the
 

4077
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,270
particular linear aged but the
possibility space at the sort of tips

4078
01:17:58,270 --> 01:17:58,280
possibility space at the sort of tips
 

4079
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:00,030
possibility space at the sort of tips
like the things we can generate next is

4080
01:18:00,030 --> 01:18:00,040
like the things we can generate next is
 

4081
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:01,830
like the things we can generate next is
really huge so there's some

4082
01:18:01,830 --> 01:18:01,840
really huge so there's some
 

4083
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:04,430
really huge so there's some
stochasticity and what we actually you

4084
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:04,440
stochasticity and what we actually you
 

4085
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:07,750
stochasticity and what we actually you
know instantiate as like the next

4086
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:07,760
know instantiate as like the next
 

4087
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,990
know instantiate as like the next
structures that get built in in the

4088
01:18:09,990 --> 01:18:10,000
structures that get built in in the
 

4089
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,629
structures that get built in in the
biosphere um it's not completely

4090
01:18:12,629 --> 01:18:12,639
biosphere um it's not completely
 

4091
01:18:12,639 --> 01:18:14,070
biosphere um it's not completely
deterministic because the space of

4092
01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:14,080
deterministic because the space of
 

4093
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,950
deterministic because the space of
future possibilities is always larger

4094
01:18:15,950 --> 01:18:15,960
future possibilities is always larger
 

4095
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:17,790
future possibilities is always larger
than the space of things that exist now

4096
01:18:17,790 --> 01:18:17,800
than the space of things that exist now
 

4097
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:19,310
than the space of things that exist now
so how many

4098
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:19,320
so how many
 

4099
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:21,669
so how many
instantiations of life is out there do

4100
01:18:21,669 --> 01:18:21,679
instantiations of life is out there do
 

4101
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:22,430
instantiations of life is out there do
you

4102
01:18:22,430 --> 01:18:22,440
you
 

4103
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:26,030
you
think uh so how how often does this

4104
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:26,040
think uh so how how often does this
 

4105
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:28,750
think uh so how how often does this
happen what we see happen here on Earth

4106
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:28,760
happen what we see happen here on Earth
 

4107
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:30,709
happen what we see happen here on Earth
how often is this process repeated

4108
01:18:30,709 --> 01:18:30,719
how often is this process repeated
 

4109
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:32,229
how often is this process repeated
throughout our galaxy throughout the

4110
01:18:32,229 --> 01:18:32,239
throughout our galaxy throughout the
 

4111
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:34,790
throughout our galaxy throughout the
universe so I I said before like right

4112
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:34,800
universe so I I said before like right
 

4113
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,110
universe so I I said before like right
now I think the original life is a

4114
01:18:36,110 --> 01:18:36,120
now I think the original life is a
 

4115
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:38,110
now I think the original life is a
continuous process on earth like I think

4116
01:18:38,110 --> 01:18:38,120
continuous process on earth like I think
 

4117
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:40,229
continuous process on earth like I think
this this idea of like combinatorial

4118
01:18:40,229 --> 01:18:40,239
this this idea of like combinatorial
 

4119
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:42,110
this this idea of like combinatorial
spaces that our biosphere generates not

4120
01:18:42,110 --> 01:18:42,120
spaces that our biosphere generates not
 

4121
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:45,470
spaces that our biosphere generates not
just chemistry but other spaces um often

4122
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:45,480
just chemistry but other spaces um often
 

4123
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:47,950
just chemistry but other spaces um often
cross this threshold where they then

4124
01:18:47,950 --> 01:18:47,960
cross this threshold where they then
 

4125
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:50,189
cross this threshold where they then
allow themselves to persist with

4126
01:18:50,189 --> 01:18:50,199
allow themselves to persist with
 

4127
01:18:50,199 --> 01:18:51,430
allow themselves to persist with
particular regular structure over time

4128
01:18:51,430 --> 01:18:51,440
particular regular structure over time
 

4129
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:53,590
particular regular structure over time
so language is is another one where you

4130
01:18:53,590 --> 01:18:53,600
so language is is another one where you
 

4131
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,350
so language is is another one where you
know like the space of

4132
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:55,360
know like the space of
 

4133
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,910
know like the space of
you know possible configurations of the

4134
01:18:57,910 --> 01:18:57,920
you know possible configurations of the
 

4135
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:00,149
you know possible configurations of the
26 letters of the English alphabet is

4136
01:19:00,149 --> 01:19:00,159
26 letters of the English alphabet is
 

4137
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:01,950
26 letters of the English alphabet is
astronomically large but we use with

4138
01:19:01,950 --> 01:19:01,960
astronomically large but we use with
 

4139
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:04,790
astronomically large but we use with
very high regularity certain structures

4140
01:19:04,790 --> 01:19:04,800
very high regularity certain structures
 

4141
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,510
very high regularity certain structures
um and then we associate meaning to them

4142
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:07,520
um and then we associate meaning to them
 

4143
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,229
um and then we associate meaning to them
because of the regularity of like how

4144
01:19:09,229 --> 01:19:09,239
because of the regularity of like how
 

4145
01:19:09,239 --> 01:19:10,830
because of the regularity of like how
much we use them right so meaning is an

4146
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:10,840
much we use them right so meaning is an
 

4147
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,790
much we use them right so meaning is an
emergent property of the causation and

4148
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:12,800
emergent property of the causation and
 

4149
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,350
emergent property of the causation and
the objects and like how often they

4150
01:19:14,350 --> 01:19:14,360
the objects and like how often they
 

4151
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:16,189
the objects and like how often they
recur and and what the relationship of

4152
01:19:16,189 --> 01:19:16,199
recur and and what the relationship of
 

4153
01:19:16,199 --> 01:19:18,110
recur and and what the relationship of
the recurrence is to other objects

4154
01:19:18,110 --> 01:19:18,120
the recurrence is to other objects
 

4155
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:19,910
the recurrence is to other objects
meaning is the emerging property okay

4156
01:19:19,910 --> 01:19:19,920
meaning is the emerging property okay
 

4157
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,310
meaning is the emerging property okay
got it well this is why you can play

4158
01:19:21,310 --> 01:19:21,320
got it well this is why you can play
 

4159
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:23,430
got it well this is why you can play
with language so much actually so words

4160
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:23,440
with language so much actually so words
 

4161
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:24,830
with language so much actually so words
don't really carry meaning it's it's

4162
01:19:24,830 --> 01:19:24,840
don't really carry meaning it's it's
 

4163
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:27,350
don't really carry meaning it's it's
just about how you lace them together

4164
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:27,360
just about how you lace them together
 

4165
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,629
just about how you lace them together
yeah but from from where does but you

4166
01:19:29,629 --> 01:19:29,639
yeah but from from where does but you
 

4167
01:19:29,639 --> 01:19:32,189
yeah but from from where does but you
don't have a lot of room obviously as as

4168
01:19:32,189 --> 01:19:32,199
don't have a lot of room obviously as as
 

4169
01:19:32,199 --> 01:19:33,629
don't have a lot of room obviously as as
a speaker of a given language you don't

4170
01:19:33,629 --> 01:19:33,639
a speaker of a given language you don't
 

4171
01:19:33,639 --> 01:19:35,229
a speaker of a given language you don't
have a lot of room with a given word to

4172
01:19:35,229 --> 01:19:35,239
have a lot of room with a given word to
 

4173
01:19:35,239 --> 01:19:38,189
have a lot of room with a given word to
wiggle but you do have you do have you

4174
01:19:38,189 --> 01:19:38,199
wiggle but you do have you do have you
 

4175
01:19:38,199 --> 01:19:40,669
wiggle but you do have you do have you
have a certain amount of room to push

4176
01:19:40,669 --> 01:19:40,679
have a certain amount of room to push
 

4177
01:19:40,679 --> 01:19:43,750
have a certain amount of room to push
the meanings of words yeah and um and I

4178
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:43,760
the meanings of words yeah and um and I
 

4179
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:45,310
the meanings of words yeah and um and I
do this all the time and you have to do

4180
01:19:45,310 --> 01:19:45,320
do this all the time and you have to do
 

4181
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:48,229
do this all the time and you have to do
it uh with the kind of work that I do

4182
01:19:48,229 --> 01:19:48,239
it uh with the kind of work that I do
 

4183
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:50,310
it uh with the kind of work that I do
because if you want

4184
01:19:50,310 --> 01:19:50,320
because if you want
 

4185
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:54,189
because if you want
to uh discover an abstraction like some

4186
01:19:54,189 --> 01:19:54,199
to uh discover an abstraction like some
 

4187
01:19:54,199 --> 01:19:56,550
to uh discover an abstraction like some
kind of concept that we don't understand

4188
01:19:56,550 --> 01:19:56,560
kind of concept that we don't understand
 

4189
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,030
kind of concept that we don't understand
yet we it means we don't have the

4190
01:19:58,030 --> 01:19:58,040
yet we it means we don't have the
 

4191
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:01,149
yet we it means we don't have the
language and so the words that we have

4192
01:20:01,149 --> 01:20:01,159
language and so the words that we have
 

4193
01:20:01,159 --> 01:20:02,790
language and so the words that we have
are inadequate to describe the things

4194
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:02,800
are inadequate to describe the things
 

4195
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:03,709
are inadequate to describe the things
this is why we're having a hard time

4196
01:20:03,709 --> 01:20:03,719
this is why we're having a hard time
 

4197
01:20:03,719 --> 01:20:05,030
this is why we're having a hard time
talking about assembly Theory because

4198
01:20:05,030 --> 01:20:05,040
talking about assembly Theory because
 

4199
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:09,830
talking about assembly Theory because
it's a newly emerging idea um and so um

4200
01:20:09,830 --> 01:20:09,840
it's a newly emerging idea um and so um
 

4201
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,750
it's a newly emerging idea um and so um
so I'm constantly playing with words in

4202
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:11,760
so I'm constantly playing with words in
 

4203
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,229
so I'm constantly playing with words in
different ways to try to convey the

4204
01:20:13,229 --> 01:20:13,239
different ways to try to convey the
 

4205
01:20:13,239 --> 01:20:14,910
different ways to try to convey the
meaning that is actually behind the

4206
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:14,920
meaning that is actually behind the
 

4207
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:18,669
meaning that is actually behind the
words but it's hard to do so you have to

4208
01:20:18,669 --> 01:20:18,679
words but it's hard to do so you have to
 

4209
01:20:18,679 --> 01:20:21,229
words but it's hard to do so you have to
wiggle within the constraints yes lots

4210
01:20:21,229 --> 01:20:21,239
wiggle within the constraints yes lots
 

4211
01:20:21,239 --> 01:20:25,070
wiggle within the constraints yes lots
of Wiggle the uh the Great orators are

4212
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:25,080
of Wiggle the uh the Great orators are
 

4213
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:26,350
of Wiggle the uh the Great orators are
are just good at

4214
01:20:26,350 --> 01:20:26,360
are just good at
 

4215
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:28,830
are just good at
wiggling do you

4216
01:20:28,830 --> 01:20:28,840
wiggling do you
 

4217
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:32,270
wiggling do you
wiggle I'm not a very good wiggler no

4218
01:20:32,270 --> 01:20:32,280
wiggle I'm not a very good wiggler no
 

4219
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:34,070
wiggle I'm not a very good wiggler no
this is the problem this is part of the

4220
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:34,080
this is the problem this is part of the
 

4221
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,550
this is the problem this is part of the
problem no I like playing with words a

4222
01:20:35,550 --> 01:20:35,560
problem no I like playing with words a
 

4223
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:38,270
problem no I like playing with words a
lot um you know it's very funny because

4224
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:38,280
lot um you know it's very funny because
 

4225
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:40,149
lot um you know it's very funny because
you know like I I know you talked about

4226
01:20:40,149 --> 01:20:40,159
you know like I I know you talked about
 

4227
01:20:40,159 --> 01:20:41,350
you know like I I know you talked about
this with Lee but like people are so

4228
01:20:41,350 --> 01:20:41,360
this with Lee but like people are so
 

4229
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:43,590
this with Lee but like people are so
offended by the writing of uh the paper

4230
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:43,600
offended by the writing of uh the paper
 

4231
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,830
offended by the writing of uh the paper
that came out last fall and it was it

4232
01:20:45,830 --> 01:20:45,840
that came out last fall and it was it
 

4233
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,629
that came out last fall and it was it
was interesting because the ways that we

4234
01:20:47,629 --> 01:20:47,639
was interesting because the ways that we
 

4235
01:20:47,639 --> 01:20:49,550
was interesting because the ways that we
use words were not the way that people

4236
01:20:49,550 --> 01:20:49,560
use words were not the way that people
 

4237
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:52,270
use words were not the way that people
were interacting with the words um and I

4238
01:20:52,270 --> 01:20:52,280
were interacting with the words um and I
 

4239
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:54,229
were interacting with the words um and I
think that was part of the mismatch

4240
01:20:54,229 --> 01:20:54,239
think that was part of the mismatch
 

4241
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:55,950
think that was part of the mismatch
where we were trying to use words in a

4242
01:20:55,950 --> 01:20:55,960
where we were trying to use words in a
 

4243
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:57,189
where we were trying to use words in a
new way because we were trying to

4244
01:20:57,189 --> 01:20:57,199
new way because we were trying to
 

4245
01:20:57,199 --> 01:21:00,470
new way because we were trying to
describe something that uh you know

4246
01:21:00,470 --> 01:21:00,480
describe something that uh you know
 

4247
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,350
describe something that uh you know
hadn't been described adequately before

4248
01:21:02,350 --> 01:21:02,360
hadn't been described adequately before
 

4249
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,590
hadn't been described adequately before
but we had to use the words that

4250
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:03,600
but we had to use the words that
 

4251
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,270
but we had to use the words that
everyone else uses for things that are

4252
01:21:05,270 --> 01:21:05,280
everyone else uses for things that are
 

4253
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,750
everyone else uses for things that are
related and so it was really interesting

4254
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:07,760
related and so it was really interesting
 

4255
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:09,709
related and so it was really interesting
to watch that Clash play out in real

4256
01:21:09,709 --> 01:21:09,719
to watch that Clash play out in real
 

4257
01:21:09,719 --> 01:21:11,950
to watch that Clash play out in real
time for me being someone that tries to

4258
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:11,960
time for me being someone that tries to
 

4259
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:14,870
time for me being someone that tries to
be so precise with my word usage knowing

4260
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:14,880
be so precise with my word usage knowing
 

4261
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:17,430
be so precise with my word usage knowing
that it's always going to be vague boy

4262
01:21:17,430 --> 01:21:17,440
that it's always going to be vague boy
 

4263
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:20,110
that it's always going to be vague boy
can I relate it's like

4264
01:21:20,110 --> 01:21:20,120
can I relate it's like
 

4265
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:22,870
can I relate it's like
uh what is truth is truth the thing you

4266
01:21:22,870 --> 01:21:22,880
uh what is truth is truth the thing you
 

4267
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:25,110
uh what is truth is truth the thing you
meant when you wrote the words or is

4268
01:21:25,110 --> 01:21:25,120
meant when you wrote the words or is
 

4269
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:27,390
meant when you wrote the words or is
truth the thing that people understood

4270
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:27,400
truth the thing that people understood
 

4271
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:29,870
truth the thing that people understood
when they read the words oh yeah I I

4272
01:21:29,870 --> 01:21:29,880
when they read the words oh yeah I I
 

4273
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:31,750
when they read the words oh yeah I I
think that compression mechanism into

4274
01:21:31,750 --> 01:21:31,760
think that compression mechanism into
 

4275
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:33,390
think that compression mechanism into
language is really interesting one and

4276
01:21:33,390 --> 01:21:33,400
language is really interesting one and
 

4277
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:36,590
language is really interesting one and
that's why Twitter is a nice exercise I

4278
01:21:36,590 --> 01:21:36,600
that's why Twitter is a nice exercise I
 

4279
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,110
that's why Twitter is a nice exercise I
love Twitter you get to write a thing

4280
01:21:39,110 --> 01:21:39,120
love Twitter you get to write a thing
 

4281
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,830
love Twitter you get to write a thing
and you think a certain thing when you

4282
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:41,840
and you think a certain thing when you
 

4283
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:44,070
and you think a certain thing when you
write it and then you get to see all

4284
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:44,080
write it and then you get to see all
 

4285
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,590
write it and then you get to see all
these other people interpret it in all

4286
01:21:45,590 --> 01:21:45,600
these other people interpret it in all
 

4287
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,430
these other people interpret it in all
kinds of different ways I use it as an

4288
01:21:47,430 --> 01:21:47,440
kinds of different ways I use it as an
 

4289
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:49,790
kinds of different ways I use it as an
experimental platform for that reason I

4290
01:21:49,790 --> 01:21:49,800
experimental platform for that reason I
 

4291
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:52,830
experimental platform for that reason I
wish there was a higher diversity of

4292
01:21:52,830 --> 01:21:52,840
wish there was a higher diversity of
 

4293
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:55,470
wish there was a higher diversity of
interpretation mechanisms of applied to

4294
01:21:55,470 --> 01:21:55,480
interpretation mechanisms of applied to
 

4295
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:58,669
interpretation mechanisms of applied to
tweets meaning like oh all kinds of

4296
01:21:58,669 --> 01:21:58,679
tweets meaning like oh all kinds of
 

4297
01:21:58,679 --> 01:22:00,830
tweets meaning like oh all kinds of
different people would come to it like

4298
01:22:00,830 --> 01:22:00,840
different people would come to it like
 

4299
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:02,669
different people would come to it like
some people that see the good in

4300
01:22:02,669 --> 01:22:02,679
some people that see the good in
 

4301
01:22:02,679 --> 01:22:04,070
some people that see the good in
everything and some people that are

4302
01:22:04,070 --> 01:22:04,080
everything and some people that are
 

4303
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:06,390
everything and some people that are
Ultra cynical a bunch of haters and a

4304
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:06,400
Ultra cynical a bunch of haters and a
 

4305
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,790
Ultra cynical a bunch of haters and a
bunch of lovers and a bunch of maybe

4306
01:22:07,790 --> 01:22:07,800
bunch of lovers and a bunch of maybe
 

4307
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,110
bunch of lovers and a bunch of maybe
they could do better jobs with

4308
01:22:09,110 --> 01:22:09,120
they could do better jobs with
 

4309
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,910
they could do better jobs with
presenting material to people like you

4310
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:11,920
presenting material to people like you
 

4311
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:13,830
presenting material to people like you
know the the Rand like like how things

4312
01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:13,840
know the the Rand like like how things
 

4313
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:15,030
know the the Rand like like how things
you know it's like usually based on

4314
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:15,040
you know it's like usually based on
 

4315
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,310
you know it's like usually based on
interest but I think it would be really

4316
01:22:16,310 --> 01:22:16,320
interest but I think it would be really
 

4317
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:18,750
interest but I think it would be really
nice if you got like 10% of your Twitter

4318
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:18,760
nice if you got like 10% of your Twitter
 

4319
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:20,629
nice if you got like 10% of your Twitter
feed was random stuff sampled from other

4320
01:22:20,629 --> 01:22:20,639
feed was random stuff sampled from other
 

4321
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:23,629
feed was random stuff sampled from other
places that'd be kind of fun true I also

4322
01:22:23,629 --> 01:22:23,639
places that'd be kind of fun true I also
 

4323
01:22:23,639 --> 01:22:26,390
places that'd be kind of fun true I also
would love to filter just like

4324
01:22:26,390 --> 01:22:26,400
would love to filter just like
 

4325
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:31,070
would love to filter just like
been uh the response to tweets by like

4326
01:22:31,070 --> 01:22:31,080
been uh the response to tweets by like
 

4327
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:33,709
been uh the response to tweets by like
the people that hate on everything yes

4328
01:22:33,709 --> 01:22:33,719
the people that hate on everything yes
 

4329
01:22:33,719 --> 01:22:34,910
the people that hate on everything yes
the people that are oh that would be

4330
01:22:34,910 --> 01:22:34,920
the people that are oh that would be
 

4331
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:36,990
the people that are oh that would be
fantastic the people that are like super

4332
01:22:36,990 --> 01:22:37,000
fantastic the people that are like super
 

4333
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,070
fantastic the people that are like super
positive about everything and that

4334
01:22:39,070 --> 01:22:39,080
positive about everything and that
 

4335
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:41,950
positive about everything and that
they'll just kind of I guess normalize

4336
01:22:41,950 --> 01:22:41,960
they'll just kind of I guess normalize
 

4337
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:44,149
they'll just kind of I guess normalize
the response cuz then it'd be cool to

4338
01:22:44,149 --> 01:22:44,159
the response cuz then it'd be cool to
 

4339
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:45,470
the response cuz then it'd be cool to
see if the people that you're usually

4340
01:22:45,470 --> 01:22:45,480
see if the people that you're usually
 

4341
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:47,030
see if the people that you're usually
positive about everything are hating on

4342
01:22:47,030 --> 01:22:47,040
positive about everything are hating on
 

4343
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:49,550
positive about everything are hating on
you or like totally don't understand or

4344
01:22:49,550 --> 01:22:49,560
you or like totally don't understand or
 

4345
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:51,990
you or like totally don't understand or
completely misunderstood yeah usually

4346
01:22:51,990 --> 01:22:52,000
completely misunderstood yeah usually
 

4347
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,310
completely misunderstood yeah usually
takes a lot of clicking to find that out

4348
01:22:54,310 --> 01:22:54,320
takes a lot of clicking to find that out
 

4349
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,070
takes a lot of clicking to find that out
yeah yeah so be better if it was sorted

4350
01:22:56,070 --> 01:22:56,080
yeah yeah so be better if it was sorted
 

4351
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:58,229
yeah yeah so be better if it was sorted
Yeah the more clicking you

4352
01:22:58,229 --> 01:22:58,239
Yeah the more clicking you
 

4353
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:01,310
Yeah the more clicking you
do the more damaging it is to the soul

4354
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:01,320
do the more damaging it is to the soul
 

4355
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:02,830
do the more damaging it is to the soul
yeah it's like instead of like like you

4356
01:23:02,830 --> 01:23:02,840
yeah it's like instead of like like you
 

4357
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:03,990
yeah it's like instead of like like you
could have the blue check but you should

4358
01:23:03,990 --> 01:23:04,000
could have the blue check but you should
 

4359
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,510
could have the blue check but you should
have like are you a pessimist an

4360
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:05,520
have like are you a pessimist an
 

4361
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:09,750
have like are you a pessimist an
optimist yeah there a neutral

4362
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:09,760
optimist yeah there a neutral
 

4363
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:12,070
optimist yeah there a neutral
what rainbow of

4364
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:12,080
what rainbow of
 

4365
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:14,950
what rainbow of
checks and then you realize there's more

4366
01:23:14,950 --> 01:23:14,960
checks and then you realize there's more
 

4367
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,590
checks and then you realize there's more
categories than we can possibly Express

4368
01:23:16,590 --> 01:23:16,600
categories than we can possibly Express
 

4369
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:21,310
categories than we can possibly Express
in colors yeah of course uh people are

4370
01:23:21,310 --> 01:23:21,320
in colors yeah of course uh people are
 

4371
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:24,950
in colors yeah of course uh people are
complex that's our best feature I don't

4372
01:23:24,950 --> 01:23:24,960
complex that's our best feature I don't
 

4373
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:29,070
complex that's our best feature I don't
know how we got to the wiggling required

4374
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:29,080
know how we got to the wiggling required
 

4375
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:31,550
know how we got to the wiggling required
given the constraints of language

4376
01:23:31,550 --> 01:23:31,560
given the constraints of language
 

4377
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:33,390
given the constraints of language
because I think we started about me

4378
01:23:33,390 --> 01:23:33,400
because I think we started about me
 

4379
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:37,390
because I think we started about me
asking about alien life which which is

4380
01:23:37,390 --> 01:23:37,400
asking about alien life which which is
 

4381
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:38,350
asking about alien life which which is
uh how

4382
01:23:38,350 --> 01:23:38,360
uh how
 

4383
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:43,470
uh how
many different times that the uh face

4384
01:23:43,470 --> 01:23:43,480
many different times that the uh face
 

4385
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:46,149
many different times that the uh face
transition happen elsewhere do you think

4386
01:23:46,149 --> 01:23:46,159
transition happen elsewhere do you think
 

4387
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:47,910
transition happen elsewhere do you think
there's other alien civilizations out

4388
01:23:47,910 --> 01:23:47,920
there's other alien civilizations out
 

4389
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:50,350
there's other alien civilizations out
there this goes into like the you know

4390
01:23:50,350 --> 01:23:50,360
there this goes into like the you know
 

4391
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:51,870
there this goes into like the you know
like are you on the boundary of insane

4392
01:23:51,870 --> 01:23:51,880
like are you on the boundary of insane
 

4393
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:53,990
like are you on the boundary of insane
or not um but you know when you think

4394
01:23:53,990 --> 01:23:54,000
or not um but you know when you think
 

4395
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,510
or not um but you know when you think
about the the structure of the physics

4396
01:23:56,510 --> 01:23:56,520
about the the structure of the physics
 

4397
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:58,189
about the the structure of the physics
of what we are that deeply it really

4398
01:23:58,189 --> 01:23:58,199
of what we are that deeply it really
 

4399
01:23:58,199 --> 01:24:01,350
of what we are that deeply it really
changes your conception of things and um

4400
01:24:01,350 --> 01:24:01,360
changes your conception of things and um
 

4401
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:05,270
changes your conception of things and um
you know going to this idea of the

4402
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:05,280
you know going to this idea of the
 

4403
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:06,870
you know going to this idea of the
Universe

4404
01:24:06,870 --> 01:24:06,880
Universe
 

4405
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:09,270
Universe
um you know being kind of small in

4406
01:24:09,270 --> 01:24:09,280
um you know being kind of small in
 

4407
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,149
um you know being kind of small in
physical space compared to how big it is

4408
01:24:11,149 --> 01:24:11,159
physical space compared to how big it is
 

4409
01:24:11,159 --> 01:24:13,830
physical space compared to how big it is
in time and like how large we are it

4410
01:24:13,830 --> 01:24:13,840
in time and like how large we are it
 

4411
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,790
in time and like how large we are it
really makes me question about whether

4412
01:24:15,790 --> 01:24:15,800
really makes me question about whether
 

4413
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:18,590
really makes me question about whether
there's any other structure that's like

4414
01:24:18,590 --> 01:24:18,600
there's any other structure that's like
 

4415
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:21,070
there's any other structure that's like
this giant crystal in time this giant

4416
01:24:21,070 --> 01:24:21,080
this giant crystal in time this giant
 

4417
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:23,990
this giant crystal in time this giant
causal structure like our biosphere

4418
01:24:23,990 --> 01:24:24,000
causal structure like our biosphere
 

4419
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,070
causal structure like our biosphere
techn spere is anywhere else in the

4420
01:24:27,070 --> 01:24:27,080
techn spere is anywhere else in the
 

4421
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:32,070
techn spere is anywhere else in the
universe um why not I don't I don't just

4422
01:24:32,070 --> 01:24:32,080
universe um why not I don't I don't just
 

4423
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:33,709
universe um why not I don't I don't just
because this one is gigantic doesn't

4424
01:24:33,709 --> 01:24:33,719
because this one is gigantic doesn't
 

4425
01:24:33,719 --> 01:24:35,590
because this one is gigantic doesn't
mean there's other G there's other

4426
01:24:35,590 --> 01:24:35,600
mean there's other G there's other
 

4427
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,709
mean there's other G there's other
gigantic but I think when the universe

4428
01:24:37,709 --> 01:24:37,719
gigantic but I think when the universe
 

4429
01:24:37,719 --> 01:24:39,590
gigantic but I think when the universe
is expanding right it's expanding in

4430
01:24:39,590 --> 01:24:39,600
is expanding right it's expanding in
 

4431
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,390
is expanding right it's expanding in
space but in assembly Theory it's also

4432
01:24:41,390 --> 01:24:41,400
space but in assembly Theory it's also
 

4433
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:44,550
space but in assembly Theory it's also
expanding in time um and actually that's

4434
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:44,560
expanding in time um and actually that's
 

4435
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:46,950
expanding in time um and actually that's
driving the expansion in space and the

4436
01:24:46,950 --> 01:24:46,960
driving the expansion in space and the
 

4437
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:49,229
driving the expansion in space and the
expansion in time is also driving the

4438
01:24:49,229 --> 01:24:49,239
expansion in time is also driving the
 

4439
01:24:49,239 --> 01:24:51,470
expansion in time is also driving the
the expansion in the sort of

4440
01:24:51,470 --> 01:24:51,480
the expansion in the sort of
 

4441
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:53,430
the expansion in the sort of
combinatorial space of things on our

4442
01:24:53,430 --> 01:24:53,440
combinatorial space of things on our
 

4443
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:55,709
combinatorial space of things on our
planet so that's driving the sort of you

4444
01:24:55,709 --> 01:24:55,719
planet so that's driving the sort of you
 

4445
01:24:55,719 --> 01:24:57,229
planet so that's driving the sort of you
know pace of technology and all the

4446
01:24:57,229 --> 01:24:57,239
know pace of technology and all the
 

4447
01:24:57,239 --> 01:24:58,950
know pace of technology and all the
other things so time is driving all of

4448
01:24:58,950 --> 01:24:58,960
other things so time is driving all of
 

4449
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,990
other things so time is driving all of
these things uh which is a little bit

4450
01:25:00,990 --> 01:25:01,000
these things uh which is a little bit
 

4451
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,510
these things uh which is a little bit
crazy to think that the universe is just

4452
01:25:02,510 --> 01:25:02,520
crazy to think that the universe is just
 

4453
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:04,590
crazy to think that the universe is just
getting bigger because time is getting

4454
01:25:04,590 --> 01:25:04,600
getting bigger because time is getting
 

4455
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:09,109
getting bigger because time is getting
bigger um but like the sort of visual

4456
01:25:09,109 --> 01:25:09,119
bigger um but like the sort of visual
 

4457
01:25:09,119 --> 01:25:10,990
bigger um but like the sort of visual
that gets built in my brain about that

4458
01:25:10,990 --> 01:25:11,000
that gets built in my brain about that
 

4459
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,629
that gets built in my brain about that
is like the structure that we're

4460
01:25:12,629 --> 01:25:12,639
is like the structure that we're
 

4461
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:14,790
is like the structure that we're
building on this planet is packing more

4462
01:25:14,790 --> 01:25:14,800
building on this planet is packing more
 

4463
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:17,910
building on this planet is packing more
and more time in this very small volume

4464
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:17,920
and more time in this very small volume
 

4465
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:19,669
and more time in this very small volume
of space right cuz our planet hasn't

4466
01:25:19,669 --> 01:25:19,679
of space right cuz our planet hasn't
 

4467
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:21,629
of space right cuz our planet hasn't
changed its physical size in 4 billion

4468
01:25:21,629 --> 01:25:21,639
changed its physical size in 4 billion
 

4469
01:25:21,639 --> 01:25:23,669
changed its physical size in 4 billion
years but there's like a ton of

4470
01:25:23,669 --> 01:25:23,679
years but there's like a ton of
 

4471
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:25,550
years but there's like a ton of
causation

4472
01:25:25,550 --> 01:25:25,560
causation
 

4473
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:27,870
causation
uh and recursion and time whatever word

4474
01:25:27,870 --> 01:25:27,880
uh and recursion and time whatever word
 

4475
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:30,629
uh and recursion and time whatever word
you want to use information packed into

4476
01:25:30,629 --> 01:25:30,639
you want to use information packed into
 

4477
01:25:30,639 --> 01:25:34,030
you want to use information packed into
this and I think this is also you know

4478
01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:34,040
this and I think this is also you know
 

4479
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:36,990
this and I think this is also you know
embedded in sort of the virtualization

4480
01:25:36,990 --> 01:25:37,000
embedded in sort of the virtualization
 

4481
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,629
embedded in sort of the virtualization
of our Technologies or the abstraction

4482
01:25:39,629 --> 01:25:39,639
of our Technologies or the abstraction
 

4483
01:25:39,639 --> 01:25:41,109
of our Technologies or the abstraction
of language and all of these things

4484
01:25:41,109 --> 01:25:41,119
of language and all of these things
 

4485
01:25:41,119 --> 01:25:42,709
of language and all of these things
these these these things that seem

4486
01:25:42,709 --> 01:25:42,719
these these these things that seem
 

4487
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:44,950
these these these things that seem
really abstract are just really deep in

4488
01:25:44,950 --> 01:25:44,960
really abstract are just really deep in
 

4489
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:49,070
really abstract are just really deep in
time um and so uh so what that looks

4490
01:25:49,070 --> 01:25:49,080
time um and so uh so what that looks
 

4491
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:51,910
time um and so uh so what that looks
like is you have a a planet that becomes

4492
01:25:51,910 --> 01:25:51,920
like is you have a a planet that becomes
 

4493
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:54,310
like is you have a a planet that becomes
increasingly virtualized and so it's

4494
01:25:54,310 --> 01:25:54,320
increasingly virtualized and so it's
 

4495
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:55,790
increasingly virtualized and so it's
getting bigger and bigger in time but

4496
01:25:55,790 --> 01:25:55,800
getting bigger and bigger in time but
 

4497
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,350
getting bigger and bigger in time but
not really expanding out in space and

4498
01:25:57,350 --> 01:25:57,360
not really expanding out in space and
 

4499
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,070
not really expanding out in space and
the rest of space is like kind of moving

4500
01:25:59,070 --> 01:25:59,080
the rest of space is like kind of moving
 

4501
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:00,590
the rest of space is like kind of moving
away from it it's again it's a sort of

4502
01:26:00,590 --> 01:26:00,600
away from it it's again it's a sort of
 

4503
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:02,750
away from it it's again it's a sort of
exponentially receding Horizon and I'm

4504
01:26:02,750 --> 01:26:02,760
exponentially receding Horizon and I'm
 

4505
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:04,669
exponentially receding Horizon and I'm
just not sure how far into this

4506
01:26:04,669 --> 01:26:04,679
just not sure how far into this
 

4507
01:26:04,679 --> 01:26:07,790
just not sure how far into this
evolutionary process something gets if

4508
01:26:07,790 --> 01:26:07,800
evolutionary process something gets if
 

4509
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:09,510
evolutionary process something gets if
it can ever see that there's another

4510
01:26:09,510 --> 01:26:09,520
it can ever see that there's another
 

4511
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:11,030
it can ever see that there's another
such structure out there what do you

4512
01:26:11,030 --> 01:26:11,040
such structure out there what do you
 

4513
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:13,510
such structure out there what do you
mean by virtualized in that context

4514
01:26:13,510 --> 01:26:13,520
mean by virtualized in that context
 

4515
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:15,390
mean by virtualized in that context
virtual as sort of a play on virtual

4516
01:26:15,390 --> 01:26:15,400
virtual as sort of a play on virtual
 

4517
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:18,390
virtual as sort of a play on virtual
reality and like simulation theories um

4518
01:26:18,390 --> 01:26:18,400
reality and like simulation theories um
 

4519
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:21,430
reality and like simulation theories um
but virtual also in a sense of uh you

4520
01:26:21,430 --> 01:26:21,440
but virtual also in a sense of uh you
 

4521
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:24,390
but virtual also in a sense of uh you
know we talk about virtual particles in

4522
01:26:24,390 --> 01:26:24,400
know we talk about virtual particles in
 

4523
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:26,709
know we talk about virtual particles in
um in particle physics which you know

4524
01:26:26,709 --> 01:26:26,719
um in particle physics which you know
 

4525
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:28,390
um in particle physics which you know
they they are very critical to doing

4526
01:26:28,390 --> 01:26:28,400
they they are very critical to doing
 

4527
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:29,669
they they are very critical to doing
calculations about predicting the

4528
01:26:29,669 --> 01:26:29,679
calculations about predicting the
 

4529
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:31,070
calculations about predicting the
properties of real particles but we

4530
01:26:31,070 --> 01:26:31,080
properties of real particles but we
 

4531
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:33,910
properties of real particles but we
don't observe them directly so what I

4532
01:26:33,910 --> 01:26:33,920
don't observe them directly so what I
 

4533
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:38,350
don't observe them directly so what I
mean by virtual here is virtual reality

4534
01:26:38,350 --> 01:26:38,360
mean by virtual here is virtual reality
 

4535
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:41,830
mean by virtual here is virtual reality
for me things that appear virtual appear

4536
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:41,840
for me things that appear virtual appear
 

4537
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,430
for me things that appear virtual appear
abstract are just things that are very

4538
01:26:43,430 --> 01:26:43,440
abstract are just things that are very
 

4539
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:45,870
abstract are just things that are very
deep in time in the in the structure of

4540
01:26:45,870 --> 01:26:45,880
deep in time in the in the structure of
 

4541
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:49,070
deep in time in the in the structure of
the things that we are so if you think

4542
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:49,080
the things that we are so if you think
 

4543
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:52,030
the things that we are so if you think
about you as a 4 billion year old object

4544
01:26:52,030 --> 01:26:52,040
about you as a 4 billion year old object
 

4545
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:53,830
about you as a 4 billion year old object
uh the things that are part of you like

4546
01:26:53,830 --> 01:26:53,840
uh the things that are part of you like
 

4547
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,910
uh the things that are part of you like
your Capac to use language or think

4548
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:55,920
your Capac to use language or think
 

4549
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:58,070
your Capac to use language or think
abstractly or have mathematics are just

4550
01:26:58,070 --> 01:26:58,080
abstractly or have mathematics are just
 

4551
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:00,629
abstractly or have mathematics are just
very you know like deep temporal

4552
01:27:00,629 --> 01:27:00,639
very you know like deep temporal
 

4553
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:02,709
very you know like deep temporal
structures that's why they look like

4554
01:27:02,709 --> 01:27:02,719
structures that's why they look like
 

4555
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:05,310
structures that's why they look like
they're informational and Abstract is

4556
01:27:05,310 --> 01:27:05,320
they're informational and Abstract is
 

4557
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:07,270
they're informational and Abstract is
because they're like they're existing in

4558
01:27:07,270 --> 01:27:07,280
because they're like they're existing in
 

4559
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:08,830
because they're like they're existing in
this temporal part of you but not

4560
01:27:08,830 --> 01:27:08,840
this temporal part of you but not
 

4561
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:10,590
this temporal part of you but not
necessarily spatial part just because I

4562
01:27:10,590 --> 01:27:10,600
necessarily spatial part just because I
 

4563
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:12,070
necessarily spatial part just because I
have a 4 billion year old history why

4564
01:27:12,070 --> 01:27:12,080
have a 4 billion year old history why
 

4565
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:14,109
have a 4 billion year old history why
does that mean I can't hang out with

4566
01:27:14,109 --> 01:27:14,119
does that mean I can't hang out with
 

4567
01:27:14,119 --> 01:27:16,189
does that mean I can't hang out with
aliens there's a couple ideas that are

4568
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:16,199
aliens there's a couple ideas that are
 

4569
01:27:16,199 --> 01:27:18,590
aliens there's a couple ideas that are
embedded here so one of them comes again

4570
01:27:18,590 --> 01:27:18,600
embedded here so one of them comes again
 

4571
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:20,550
embedded here so one of them comes again
from Paul he wrote this book years ago

01:27:20,550 --> 01:27:20,560
from Paul he wrote this book years ago
 

4573
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:21,870
from Paul he wrote this book years ago
about

4574
01:27:21,870 --> 01:27:21,880
about
 

4575
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:24,390
about
um you know like the Eerie silence and

4576
01:27:24,390 --> 01:27:24,400
um you know like the Eerie silence and
 

4577
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:26,390
um you know like the Eerie silence and
why we're alone and he concluded the

4578
01:27:26,390 --> 01:27:26,400
why we're alone and he concluded the
 

4579
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:27,510
why we're alone and he concluded the
book with this idea of Quint

4580
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:27,520
book with this idea of Quint
 

4581

book with this idea of Quint
intelligence or something but like this

4582
01:27:29,109 --> 01:27:29,119
intelligence or something but like this
 

4583
01:27:29,119 --> 01:27:31,590
intelligence or something but like this
idea that like really advanced

4584
01:27:31,590 --> 01:27:31,600
idea that like really advanced
 

4585
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:34,270
idea that like really advanced
intelligence would basically just um

4586
01:27:34,270 --> 01:27:34,280
intelligence would basically just um
 

4587
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:36,149
intelligence would basically just um
build itself into a quantum computer and

4588
01:27:36,149 --> 01:27:36,159
build itself into a quantum computer and
 

4589
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:38,430
build itself into a quantum computer and
it would want to operate in the vacuum

4590
01:27:38,430 --> 01:27:38,440
it would want to operate in the vacuum
 

4591
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:39,669
it would want to operate in the vacuum
of space because that's the best place

4592
01:27:39,669 --> 01:27:39,679
of space because that's the best place
 

4593
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:41,229
of space because that's the best place
to do Quantum computation and it would

4594
01:27:41,229 --> 01:27:41,239
to do Quantum computation and it would
 

4595
01:27:41,239 --> 01:27:42,350
to do Quantum computation and it would
just like run out all of its

4596
01:27:42,350 --> 01:27:42,360
just like run out all of its
 

4597
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:43,950
just like run out all of its
computations indefinitely but it would

4598
01:27:43,950 --> 01:27:43,960
computations indefinitely but it would
 

4599
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:45,270
computations indefinitely but it would
look completely dark to the rest of the

4600
01:27:45,270 --> 01:27:45,280
look completely dark to the rest of the
 

4601
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:47,950
look completely dark to the rest of the
universe and I don't think as as typical

4602
01:27:47,950 --> 01:27:47,960
universe and I don't think as as typical
 

4603
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:49,310
universe and I don't think as as typical
like I don't think that's actually like

4604
01:27:49,310 --> 01:27:49,320
like I don't think that's actually like
 

4605
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:50,990
like I don't think that's actually like
the right physics but I think something

4606
01:27:50,990 --> 01:27:51,000
the right physics but I think something
 

4607
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,030
the right physics but I think something
about that idea as I do with all ideas

4608
01:27:53,030 --> 01:27:53,040
about that idea as I do with all ideas
 

4609
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,709
about that idea as I do with all ideas
is partially correct and frean Dyson

4610
01:27:54,709 --> 01:27:54,719
is partially correct and frean Dyson
 

4611
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:57,390
is partially correct and frean Dyson
also had this amazing paper about how

4612
01:27:57,390 --> 01:27:57,400
also had this amazing paper about how
 

4613
01:27:57,400 --> 01:27:59,830
also had this amazing paper about how
long life could persist in a universe

4614
01:27:59,830 --> 01:27:59,840
long life could persist in a universe
 

4615
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:02,030
long life could persist in a universe
that was exponentially expanding and his

4616
01:28:02,030 --> 01:28:02,040
that was exponentially expanding and his
 

4617
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:03,629
that was exponentially expanding and his
conception was like if you imagine an

4618
01:28:03,629 --> 01:28:03,639
conception was like if you imagine an
 

4619
01:28:03,639 --> 01:28:06,950
conception was like if you imagine an
analog life form uh it could run slower

4620
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:06,960
analog life form uh it could run slower
 

4621
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:10,149
analog life form uh it could run slower
and slower and slower and slower and

4622
01:28:10,149 --> 01:28:10,159
and slower and slower and slower and
 

4623
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:12,550
and slower and slower and slower and
slower as a function of time and so it

4624
01:28:12,550 --> 01:28:12,560
slower as a function of time and so it
 

4625
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:14,350
slower as a function of time and so it
would um it would be able to run

4626
01:28:14,350 --> 01:28:14,360
would um it would be able to run
 

4627
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:16,030
would um it would be able to run
indefinitely even against an

4628
01:28:16,030 --> 01:28:16,040
indefinitely even against an
 

4629
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:18,149
indefinitely even against an
exponentially expanding Universe because

4630
01:28:18,149 --> 01:28:18,159
exponentially expanding Universe because
 

4631
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:20,390
exponentially expanding Universe because
it would just run exponentially slower

4632
01:28:20,390 --> 01:28:20,400
it would just run exponentially slower
 

4633
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:23,070
it would just run exponentially slower
and so I guess part of what I'm doing in

4634
01:28:23,070 --> 01:28:23,080
and so I guess part of what I'm doing in
 

4635
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:24,430
and so I guess part of what I'm doing in
my brain is putting those those two

4636
01:28:24,430 --> 01:28:24,440
my brain is putting those those two
 

4637
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:26,590
my brain is putting those those two
things together along with this idea

4638
01:28:26,590 --> 01:28:26,600
things together along with this idea
 

4639
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:30,430
things together along with this idea
that we are building um you know like if

4640
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:30,440
that we are building um you know like if
 

4641
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:32,270
that we are building um you know like if
if you imagine with our technology we're

4642
01:28:32,270 --> 01:28:32,280
if you imagine with our technology we're
 

4643
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:34,430
if you imagine with our technology we're
now building virtual realities right

4644
01:28:34,430 --> 01:28:34,440
now building virtual realities right
 

4645
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:36,229
now building virtual realities right
like things we actually call virtual

4646
01:28:36,229 --> 01:28:36,239
like things we actually call virtual
 

4647
01:28:36,239 --> 01:28:38,510
like things we actually call virtual
reality which required you know four

4648
01:28:38,510 --> 01:28:38,520
reality which required you know four
 

4649
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:40,470
reality which required you know four
billions of years of history and a whole

4650
01:28:40,470 --> 01:28:40,480
billions of years of history and a whole
 

4651
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:42,310
billions of years of history and a whole
bunch of data to basically embed them in

4652
01:28:42,310 --> 01:28:42,320
bunch of data to basically embed them in
 

4653
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:43,790
bunch of data to basically embed them in
a computer architecture so now you can

4654
01:28:43,790 --> 01:28:43,800
a computer architecture so now you can
 

4655
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:45,750
a computer architecture so now you can
put like you know an Oculus headset on

4656
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:45,760
put like you know an Oculus headset on
 

4657
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:47,229
put like you know an Oculus headset on
and think that you're in this world

4658
01:28:47,229 --> 01:28:47,239
and think that you're in this world
 

4659
01:28:47,239 --> 01:28:49,669
and think that you're in this world
right and what you really are embedded

4660
01:28:49,669 --> 01:28:49,679
right and what you really are embedded
 

4661
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:52,470
right and what you really are embedded
in is in a very deep temporal structure

4662
01:28:52,470 --> 01:28:52,480
in is in a very deep temporal structure
 

4663
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:55,149
in is in a very deep temporal structure
and so it's huge in time but it's very

4664
01:28:55,149 --> 01:28:55,159
and so it's huge in time but it's very
 

4665
01:28:55,159 --> 01:28:57,030
and so it's huge in time but it's very
small in space and you can go lots of

4666
01:28:57,030 --> 01:28:57,040
small in space and you can go lots of
 

4667
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:59,510
small in space and you can go lots of
places in the virtual space right but

4668
01:28:59,510 --> 01:28:59,520
places in the virtual space right but
 

4669
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,229
places in the virtual space right but
you're still stuck in like your physical

4670
01:29:01,229 --> 01:29:01,239
you're still stuck in like your physical
 

4671
01:29:01,239 --> 01:29:03,470
you're still stuck in like your physical
body and like sitting in the chair and

4672
01:29:03,470 --> 01:29:03,480
body and like sitting in the chair and
 

4673
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:05,750
body and like sitting in the chair and
so you know part of it is it might be

4674
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:05,760
so you know part of it is it might be
 

4675
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:07,550
so you know part of it is it might be
the case that sufficiently

4676
01:29:07,550 --> 01:29:07,560
the case that sufficiently
 

4677
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:12,430
the case that sufficiently
evolved uh biospheres kind of virtualize

4678
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:12,440
evolved uh biospheres kind of virtualize
 

4679
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:14,470
evolved uh biospheres kind of virtualize
themselves and they internalize their

4680
01:29:14,470 --> 01:29:14,480
themselves and they internalize their
 

4681
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:16,430
themselves and they internalize their
Universe in their sort of temporal

4682
01:29:16,430 --> 01:29:16,440
Universe in their sort of temporal
 

4683
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:17,990
Universe in their sort of temporal
causal structure and they close

4684
01:29:17,990 --> 01:29:18,000
causal structure and they close
 

4685
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:18,990
causal structure and they close
themselves off from the rest of the

4686
01:29:18,990 --> 01:29:19,000
themselves off from the rest of the
 

4687
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,870
themselves off from the rest of the
Universe I just don't know if a deep

4688
01:29:20,870 --> 01:29:20,880
Universe I just don't know if a deep
 

4689
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:23,070
Universe I just don't know if a deep
temporal structure necessarily means

4690
01:29:23,070 --> 01:29:23,080
temporal structure necessarily means
 

4691
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:25,430
temporal structure necessarily means
that you're closed off no I don't either

4692
01:29:25,430 --> 01:29:25,440
that you're closed off no I don't either
 

4693
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:27,669
that you're closed off no I don't either
so that's kind of my fear so I'm not I'm

4694
01:29:27,669 --> 01:29:27,679
so that's kind of my fear so I'm not I'm
 

4695
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:29,950
so that's kind of my fear so I'm not I'm
not sure I'm agreeing with what I say

4696
01:29:29,950 --> 01:29:29,960
not sure I'm agreeing with what I say
 

4697
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:31,629
not sure I'm agreeing with what I say
I'm just saying like this is one sort of

4698
01:29:31,629 --> 01:29:31,639
I'm just saying like this is one sort of
 

4699
01:29:31,639 --> 01:29:33,430
I'm just saying like this is one sort of
conclusion and you know like in my most

4700
01:29:33,430 --> 01:29:33,440
conclusion and you know like in my most
 

4701
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,430
conclusion and you know like in my most
sort of like it's interesting because I

4702
01:29:35,430 --> 01:29:35,440
sort of like it's interesting because I
 

4703
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:38,189
sort of like it's interesting because I
I don't do psychedelic drugs uh but when

4704
01:29:38,189 --> 01:29:38,199
I don't do psychedelic drugs uh but when
 

4705
01:29:38,199 --> 01:29:39,390
I don't do psychedelic drugs uh but when
people describe to me like your thing

4706
01:29:39,390 --> 01:29:39,400
people describe to me like your thing
 

4707
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:41,070
people describe to me like your thing
with the faces and stuff and like I have

4708
01:29:41,070 --> 01:29:41,080
with the faces and stuff and like I have
 

4709
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:42,629
with the faces and stuff and like I have
you know had a lot of deep conversations

4710
01:29:42,629 --> 01:29:42,639
you know had a lot of deep conversations
 

4711
01:29:42,639 --> 01:29:44,189
you know had a lot of deep conversations
with friends that have done psychedelic

4712
01:29:44,189 --> 01:29:44,199
with friends that have done psychedelic
 

4713
01:29:44,199 --> 01:29:45,750
with friends that have done psychedelic
drugs for intellectual reasons and

4714
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:45,760
drugs for intellectual reasons and
 

4715
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:48,310
drugs for intellectual reasons and
otherwise um but I'm always like oh it

4716
01:29:48,310 --> 01:29:48,320
otherwise um but I'm always like oh it
 

4717
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:49,229
otherwise um but I'm always like oh it
sounds like you're just doing

4718
01:29:49,229 --> 01:29:49,239
sounds like you're just doing
 

4719
01:29:49,239 --> 01:29:50,590
sounds like you're just doing
theoretical physics like that's what

4720
01:29:50,590 --> 01:29:50,600
theoretical physics like that's what
 

4721
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:54,030
theoretical physics like that's what
brains do on theoretical physics um so I

4722
01:29:54,030 --> 01:29:54,040
brains do on theoretical physics um so I
 

4723
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:55,430
brains do on theoretical physics um so I
I live in these like really abstract

4724
01:29:55,430 --> 01:29:55,440
I live in these like really abstract
 

4725
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:58,870
I live in these like really abstract
spaces uh most of the time but um

4726
01:29:58,870 --> 01:29:58,880
spaces uh most of the time but um
 

4727
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:00,270
spaces uh most of the time but um
there's also this this issue of

4728
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:00,280
there's also this this issue of
 

4729
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:02,070
there's also this this issue of
Extinction right like Extinction events

4730
01:30:02,070 --> 01:30:02,080
Extinction right like Extinction events
 

4731
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:04,430
Extinction right like Extinction events
are basically pinching off an entire

4732
01:30:04,430 --> 01:30:04,440
are basically pinching off an entire
 

4733
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:06,109
are basically pinching off an entire
like causal structure the one of these

4734
01:30:06,109 --> 01:30:06,119
like causal structure the one of these
 

4735
01:30:06,119 --> 01:30:07,950
like causal structure the one of these
like I'm going to call them time Crystal

4736
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:07,960
like I'm going to call them time Crystal
 

4737
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:09,189
like I'm going to call them time Crystal
I don't like know what but they're like

4738
01:30:09,189 --> 01:30:09,199
I don't like know what but they're like
 

4739
01:30:09,199 --> 01:30:10,870
I don't like know what but they're like
these very large objects in time

4740
01:30:10,870 --> 01:30:10,880
these very large objects in time
 

4741
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:12,550
these very large objects in time
pinching off that whole structure from

4742
01:30:12,550 --> 01:30:12,560
pinching off that whole structure from
 

4743
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:14,550
pinching off that whole structure from
the rest of it and so it's like if you

4744
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:14,560
the rest of it and so it's like if you
 

4745
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:16,990
the rest of it and so it's like if you
imagine that sort of same thing uh in

4746
01:30:16,990 --> 01:30:17,000
imagine that sort of same thing uh in
 

4747
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,030
imagine that sort of same thing uh in
the universe I you know I once thought

4748
01:30:19,030 --> 01:30:19,040
the universe I you know I once thought
 

4749
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:20,830
the universe I you know I once thought
that sufficiently Advanced Technologies

4750
01:30:20,830 --> 01:30:20,840
that sufficiently Advanced Technologies
 

4751
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:22,310
that sufficiently Advanced Technologies
would look like black holes that would

4752
01:30:22,310 --> 01:30:22,320
would look like black holes that would
 

4753
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:24,470
would look like black holes that would
be just completely imperceptible to them

4754
01:30:24,470 --> 01:30:24,480
be just completely imperceptible to them
 

4755
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:27,270
be just completely imperceptible to them
yeah um so so there might be lots of

4756
01:30:27,270 --> 01:30:27,280
yeah um so so there might be lots of
 

4757
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:28,510
yeah um so so there might be lots of
aliens out there maybe that's

4758
01:30:28,510 --> 01:30:28,520
aliens out there maybe that's
 

4759
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:30,350
aliens out there maybe that's
explanation for all the singularities

4760
01:30:30,350 --> 01:30:30,360
explanation for all the singularities
 

4761
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:31,470
explanation for all the singularities
they're all pinched off causal

4762
01:30:31,470 --> 01:30:31,480
they're all pinched off causal
 

4763
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:32,669
they're all pinched off causal
structures that virtualized their

4764
01:30:32,669 --> 01:30:32,679
structures that virtualized their
 

4765
01:30:32,679 --> 01:30:34,350
structures that virtualized their
reality and kind of broke off from us

4766
01:30:34,350 --> 01:30:34,360
reality and kind of broke off from us
 

4767
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:37,950
reality and kind of broke off from us
black holes in every way so like um

4768
01:30:37,950 --> 01:30:37,960
black holes in every way so like um
 

4769
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:41,189
black holes in every way so like um
Untouchable to us or unlikely be

4770
01:30:41,189 --> 01:30:41,199
Untouchable to us or unlikely be
 

4771
01:30:41,199 --> 01:30:43,750
Untouchable to us or unlikely be
detectable by us right with whatever

4772
01:30:43,750 --> 01:30:43,760
detectable by us right with whatever
 

4773
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:46,149
detectable by us right with whatever
sensory mechanisms we have yeah but the

4774
01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:46,159
sensory mechanisms we have yeah but the
 

4775
01:30:46,159 --> 01:30:49,189
sensory mechanisms we have yeah but the
other way I think about it is um is

4776
01:30:49,189 --> 01:30:49,199
other way I think about it is um is
 

4777
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:51,030
other way I think about it is um is
there is probably hopefully life out

4778
01:30:51,030 --> 01:30:51,040
there is probably hopefully life out
 

4779
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:52,669
there is probably hopefully life out
there so like I do work on life

4780
01:30:52,669 --> 01:30:52,679
there so like I do work on life
 

4781
01:30:52,679 --> 01:30:55,270
there so like I do work on life
detection uh efforts in the solar system

4782
01:30:55,270 --> 01:30:55,280
detection uh efforts in the solar system
 

4783
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:56,229
detection uh efforts in the solar system
and I'm trying to help with the

4784
01:30:56,229 --> 01:30:56,239
and I'm trying to help with the
 

4785
01:30:56,239 --> 01:30:58,590
and I'm trying to help with the
habitable worlds Observatory Mission

4786
01:30:58,590 --> 01:30:58,600
habitable worlds Observatory Mission
 

4787
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:00,870
habitable worlds Observatory Mission
planning right now um and working with

4788
01:31:00,870 --> 01:31:00,880
planning right now um and working with
 

4789
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:02,270
planning right now um and working with
like the BIOS signatures team for that

4790
01:31:02,270 --> 01:31:02,280
like the BIOS signatures team for that
 

4791
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:03,750
like the BIOS signatures team for that
like to think about exoplanet bio

4792
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:03,760
like to think about exoplanet bio
 

4793
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:06,310
like to think about exoplanet bio
signature so like I have some optimism

4794
01:31:06,310 --> 01:31:06,320
signature so like I have some optimism
 

4795
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:10,229
signature so like I have some optimism
that we might find things um but there

4796
01:31:10,229 --> 01:31:10,239
that we might find things um but there
 

4797
01:31:10,239 --> 01:31:12,550
that we might find things um but there
are the challenges that we don't know

4798
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:12,560
are the challenges that we don't know
 

4799
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:14,430
are the challenges that we don't know
the likelihood for life like which is

4800
01:31:14,430 --> 01:31:14,440
the likelihood for life like which is
 

4801
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:16,390
the likelihood for life like which is
what you were talking about so if I get

4802
01:31:16,390 --> 01:31:16,400
what you were talking about so if I get
 

4803
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:18,950
what you were talking about so if I get
to a more grounded discussion what I'm

4804
01:31:18,950 --> 01:31:18,960
to a more grounded discussion what I'm
 

4805
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:22,510
to a more grounded discussion what I'm
really interested in doing is trying to

4806
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:22,520
really interested in doing is trying to
 

4807
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:25,590
really interested in doing is trying to
solve the origin of life so we can

4808
01:31:25,590 --> 01:31:25,600
solve the origin of life so we can
 

4809
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:27,229
solve the origin of life so we can
understand How likely life is out there

4810
01:31:27,229 --> 01:31:27,239
understand How likely life is out there
 

4811
01:31:27,239 --> 01:31:29,430
understand How likely life is out there
so I don't think that the I think that

4812
01:31:29,430 --> 01:31:29,440
so I don't think that the I think that
 

4813
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:32,270
so I don't think that the I think that
the problem of discovering alien life

4814
01:31:32,270 --> 01:31:32,280
the problem of discovering alien life
 

4815
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:34,470
the problem of discovering alien life
and solving the original life are deeply

4816
01:31:34,470 --> 01:31:34,480
and solving the original life are deeply
 

4817
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:36,470
and solving the original life are deeply
coupled and in fact are one in the same

4818
01:31:36,470 --> 01:31:36,480
coupled and in fact are one in the same
 

4819
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:39,669
coupled and in fact are one in the same
problem um and that the first contact

4820
01:31:39,669 --> 01:31:39,679
problem um and that the first contact
 

4821
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:41,149
problem um and that the first contact
with alien life will actually be an An

4822
01:31:41,149 --> 01:31:41,159
with alien life will actually be an An
 

4823
01:31:41,159 --> 01:31:43,950
with alien life will actually be an An
Origin life experiment um but but that

4824
01:31:43,950 --> 01:31:43,960
Origin life experiment um but but that
 

4825
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:45,550
Origin life experiment um but but that
part I'm super interested in and then

4826
01:31:45,550 --> 01:31:45,560
part I'm super interested in and then
 

4827
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:47,390
part I'm super interested in and then
there's this other feature that I think

4828
01:31:47,390 --> 01:31:47,400
there's this other feature that I think
 

4829
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:50,310
there's this other feature that I think
about a lot which is um our own

4830
01:31:50,310 --> 01:31:50,320
about a lot which is um our own
 

4831
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:52,709
about a lot which is um our own
technological phase of development as

4832
01:31:52,709 --> 01:31:52,719
technological phase of development as
 

4833
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:54,510
technological phase of development as
sort of like what is this phase in the

4834
01:31:54,510 --> 01:31:54,520
sort of like what is this phase in the
 

4835
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:58,189
sort of like what is this phase in the
evolution of uh life on a planet if you

4836
01:31:58,189 --> 01:31:58,199
evolution of uh life on a planet if you
 

4837
01:31:58,199 --> 01:32:00,310
evolution of uh life on a planet if you
think about a a biosphere emerging on a

4838
01:32:00,310 --> 01:32:00,320
think about a a biosphere emerging on a
 

4839
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:02,030
think about a a biosphere emerging on a
planet and evolving over billions of

4840
01:32:02,030 --> 01:32:02,040
planet and evolving over billions of
 

4841
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:03,950
planet and evolving over billions of
years and evolving into a

4842
01:32:03,950 --> 01:32:03,960
years and evolving into a
 

4843
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:07,310
years and evolving into a
technosphere um when a technosphere can

4844
01:32:07,310 --> 01:32:07,320
technosphere um when a technosphere can
 

4845
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:10,270
technosphere um when a technosphere can
move off planet and basically reproduce

4846
01:32:10,270 --> 01:32:10,280
move off planet and basically reproduce
 

4847
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:13,910
move off planet and basically reproduce
itself on another planet now you have uh

4848
01:32:13,910 --> 01:32:13,920
itself on another planet now you have uh
 

4849
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:16,070
itself on another planet now you have uh
biospheres reproducing

4850
01:32:16,070 --> 01:32:16,080
biospheres reproducing
 

4851
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:17,990
biospheres reproducing
themselves basically they have to go

4852
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:18,000
themselves basically they have to go
 

4853
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,229
themselves basically they have to go
through technology to do that um and so

4854
01:32:21,229 --> 01:32:21,239
through technology to do that um and so
 

4855
01:32:21,239 --> 01:32:24,070
through technology to do that um and so
there are ways of thinking about sort of

4856
01:32:24,070 --> 01:32:24,080
there are ways of thinking about sort of
 

4857
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,790
there are ways of thinking about sort of
the nature of intelligent life and how

4858
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:25,800
the nature of intelligent life and how
 

4859
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:27,709
the nature of intelligent life and how
it spreads in that capacity that I'm

4860
01:32:27,709 --> 01:32:27,719
it spreads in that capacity that I'm
 

4861
01:32:27,719 --> 01:32:29,830
it spreads in that capacity that I'm
also really excited about and thinking

4862
01:32:29,830 --> 01:32:29,840
also really excited about and thinking
 

4863
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:33,149
also really excited about and thinking
about um and all of those things for me

4864
01:32:33,149 --> 01:32:33,159
about um and all of those things for me
 

4865
01:32:33,159 --> 01:32:34,510
about um and all of those things for me
are connected like we have to solve the

4866
01:32:34,510 --> 01:32:34,520
are connected like we have to solve the
 

4867
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:36,910
are connected like we have to solve the
origin of life in order for us to get

4868
01:32:36,910 --> 01:32:36,920
origin of life in order for us to get
 

4869
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:38,550
origin of life in order for us to get
off Planet because we basically have to

4870
01:32:38,550 --> 01:32:38,560
off Planet because we basically have to
 

4871
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,790
off Planet because we basically have to
start life on another planet and we also

4872
01:32:40,790 --> 01:32:40,800
start life on another planet and we also
 

4873
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,149
start life on another planet and we also
have to solve the original life in order

4874
01:32:42,149 --> 01:32:42,159
have to solve the original life in order
 

4875
01:32:42,159 --> 01:32:44,030
have to solve the original life in order
to recognize other alien intelligence

4876
01:32:44,030 --> 01:32:44,040
to recognize other alien intelligence
 

4877
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:45,550
to recognize other alien intelligence
like all of these things are like

4878
01:32:45,550 --> 01:32:45,560
like all of these things are like
 

4879
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:47,430
like all of these things are like
literally the same problem right

4880
01:32:47,430 --> 01:32:47,440
literally the same problem right
 

4881
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:49,189
literally the same problem right
understanding the origin of life here on

4882
01:32:49,189 --> 01:32:49,199
understanding the origin of life here on
 

4883
01:32:49,199 --> 01:32:51,310
understanding the origin of life here on
Earth is a way to understand ourselves

4884
01:32:51,310 --> 01:32:51,320
Earth is a way to understand ourselves
 

4885
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:53,950
Earth is a way to understand ourselves
and to uh understanding ourselves as a a

4886
01:32:53,950 --> 01:32:53,960
and to uh understanding ourselves as a a
 

4887
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:55,790
and to uh understanding ourselves as a a
prerequisite for being able to detect

4888
01:32:55,790 --> 01:32:55,800
prerequisite for being able to detect
 

4889
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:57,910
prerequisite for being able to detect
other

4890
01:32:57,910 --> 01:32:57,920
other
 

4891
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:01,790
other
intelligent civilizations I for one take

4892
01:33:01,790 --> 01:33:01,800
intelligent civilizations I for one take
 

4893
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:03,950
intelligent civilizations I for one take
it for what it's worth

4894
01:33:03,950 --> 01:33:03,960
it for what it's worth
 

4895
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:07,229
it for what it's worth
anasa one of the things I did is zoom

4896
01:33:07,229 --> 01:33:07,239
anasa one of the things I did is zoom
 

4897
01:33:07,239 --> 01:33:10,350
anasa one of the things I did is zoom
out like aggressively like like a

4898
01:33:10,350 --> 01:33:10,360
out like aggressively like like a
 

4899
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:13,030
out like aggressively like like a
spaceship and it it would always go

4900
01:33:13,030 --> 01:33:13,040
spaceship and it it would always go
 

4901
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:14,629
spaceship and it it would always go
quickly to the Galaxy and from the

4902
01:33:14,629 --> 01:33:14,639
quickly to the Galaxy and from the
 

4903
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:16,510
quickly to the Galaxy and from the
Galaxy to

4904
01:33:16,510 --> 01:33:16,520
Galaxy to
 

4905
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:19,709
Galaxy to
this uh representation of the universe

4906
01:33:19,709 --> 01:33:19,719
this uh representation of the universe
 

4907
01:33:19,719 --> 01:33:21,629
this uh representation of the universe
and at least for me from that

4908
01:33:21,629 --> 01:33:21,639
and at least for me from that
 

4909
01:33:21,639 --> 01:33:23,510
and at least for me from that
perspective it seemed like it was full

4910
01:33:23,510 --> 01:33:23,520
perspective it seemed like it was full
 

4911
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:26,669
perspective it seemed like it was full
of alien life uh not just alien life but

4912
01:33:26,669 --> 01:33:26,679
of alien life uh not just alien life but
 

4913
01:33:26,679 --> 01:33:30,270
of alien life uh not just alien life but
uh intelligent life I like that and

4914
01:33:30,270 --> 01:33:30,280
uh intelligent life I like that and
 

4915
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:33,229
uh intelligent life I like that and
conscious life so like I don't know how

4916
01:33:33,229 --> 01:33:33,239
conscious life so like I don't know how
 

4917
01:33:33,239 --> 01:33:35,430
conscious life so like I don't know how
to convert it into words is more like a

4918
01:33:35,430 --> 01:33:35,440
to convert it into words is more like a
 

4919
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:37,229
to convert it into words is more like a
feeling like you were saying a feeling

4920
01:33:37,229 --> 01:33:37,239
feeling like you were saying a feeling
 

4921
01:33:37,239 --> 01:33:39,629
feeling like you were saying a feeling
converted to a visual to uh converted to

4922
01:33:39,629 --> 01:33:39,639
converted to a visual to uh converted to
 

4923
01:33:39,639 --> 01:33:43,070
converted to a visual to uh converted to
words so I had a visual with it but

4924
01:33:43,070 --> 01:33:43,080
words so I had a visual with it but
 

4925
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:46,109
words so I had a visual with it but
really was a feeling that it was just

4926
01:33:46,109 --> 01:33:46,119
really was a feeling that it was just
 

4927
01:33:46,119 --> 01:33:50,590
really was a feeling that it was just
full of this vibrant energy that I was

4928
01:33:50,590 --> 01:33:50,600
full of this vibrant energy that I was
 

4929
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:52,750
full of this vibrant energy that I was
feeling when I'm looking at the people

4930
01:33:52,750 --> 01:33:52,760
feeling when I'm looking at the people
 

4931
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:55,990
feeling when I'm looking at the people
in my life yeah and full of gratitude

4932
01:33:55,990 --> 01:33:56,000
in my life yeah and full of gratitude
 

4933
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,830
in my life yeah and full of gratitude
but that same exact thing is everywhere

4934
01:33:58,830 --> 01:33:58,840
but that same exact thing is everywhere
 

4935
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:01,990
but that same exact thing is everywhere
in the universe right so I totally agree

4936
01:34:01,990 --> 01:34:02,000
in the universe right so I totally agree
 

4937
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,390
in the universe right so I totally agree
with this like that visual I really love

4938
01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:04,400
with this like that visual I really love
 

4939
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,950
with this like that visual I really love
and I think we live in a universe that

4940
01:34:06,950 --> 01:34:06,960
and I think we live in a universe that
 

4941
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:10,669
and I think we live in a universe that
like generates life and purpose and like

4942
01:34:10,669 --> 01:34:10,679
like generates life and purpose and like
 

4943
01:34:10,679 --> 01:34:13,669
like generates life and purpose and like
it's it's part of the structure of just

4944
01:34:13,669 --> 01:34:13,679
it's it's part of the structure of just
 

4945
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:16,590
it's it's part of the structure of just
the world um and so maybe like this sort

4946
01:34:16,590 --> 01:34:16,600
the world um and so maybe like this sort
 

4947
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:19,430
the world um and so maybe like this sort
of lonely view I have is uh I never

4948
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:19,440
of lonely view I have is uh I never
 

4949
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:20,270
of lonely view I have is uh I never
thought about it this way till you're

4950
01:34:20,270 --> 01:34:20,280
thought about it this way till you're
 

4951
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:21,189
thought about it this way till you're
describing that I was like I want to

4952
01:34:21,189 --> 01:34:21,199
describing that I was like I want to
 

4953
01:34:21,199 --> 01:34:22,350
describing that I was like I want to
live in that universe and I'm like a

4954
01:34:22,350 --> 01:34:22,360
live in that universe and I'm like a
 

4955
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:24,270
live in that universe and I'm like a
very optimistic person and I

4956
01:34:24,270 --> 01:34:24,280
very optimistic person and I
 

4957
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:27,030
very optimistic person and I
love uh I love building visions of

4958
01:34:27,030 --> 01:34:27,040
love uh I love building visions of
 

4959
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:28,510
love uh I love building visions of
reality that are positive but I think

4960
01:34:28,510 --> 01:34:28,520
reality that are positive but I think
 

4961
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:30,350
reality that are positive but I think
for me right now in the intellectual

4962
01:34:30,350 --> 01:34:30,360
for me right now in the intellectual
 

4963
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:32,430
for me right now in the intellectual
process I have to Tunnel through this

4964
01:34:32,430 --> 01:34:32,440
process I have to Tunnel through this
 

4965
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:35,350
process I have to Tunnel through this
this particular way of thinking about

4966
01:34:35,350 --> 01:34:35,360
this particular way of thinking about
 

4967
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:38,669
this particular way of thinking about
the loneliness of being like separated

4968
01:34:38,669 --> 01:34:38,679
the loneliness of being like separated
 

4969
01:34:38,679 --> 01:34:40,390
the loneliness of being like separated
in time from everything else which I

4970
01:34:40,390 --> 01:34:40,400
in time from everything else which I
 

4971
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:42,669
in time from everything else which I
think like we also all are because time

4972
01:34:42,669 --> 01:34:42,679
think like we also all are because time
 

4973
01:34:42,679 --> 01:34:44,750
think like we also all are because time
is what defines us as individuals so

4974
01:34:44,750 --> 01:34:44,760
is what defines us as individuals so
 

4975
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:46,590
is what defines us as individuals so
part of you is drawn to the trauma of

4976
01:34:46,590 --> 01:34:46,600
part of you is drawn to the trauma of
 

4977
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:49,950
part of you is drawn to the trauma of
being alone deeply in a

4978
01:34:49,950 --> 01:34:49,960
being alone deeply in a
 

4979
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:52,270
being alone deeply in a
physics also part part of what I mean is

4980
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:52,280
physics also part part of what I mean is
 

4981
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:54,430
physics also part part of what I mean is
like you have to go through ideas you

4982
01:34:54,430 --> 01:34:54,440
like you have to go through ideas you
 

4983
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:57,590
like you have to go through ideas you
don't necessarily agree with to work out

4984
01:34:57,590 --> 01:34:57,600
don't necessarily agree with to work out
 

4985
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:59,629
don't necessarily agree with to work out
what you're trying to understand and I'm

4986
01:34:59,629 --> 01:34:59,639
what you're trying to understand and I'm
 

4987
01:34:59,639 --> 01:35:01,669
what you're trying to understand and I'm
trying to be inside the structure so I

4988
01:35:01,669 --> 01:35:01,679
trying to be inside the structure so I
 

4989
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:03,149
trying to be inside the structure so I
can really understand it and I don't

4990
01:35:03,149 --> 01:35:03,159
can really understand it and I don't
 

4991
01:35:03,159 --> 01:35:05,390
can really understand it and I don't
think I've been able to like like I'm so

4992
01:35:05,390 --> 01:35:05,400
think I've been able to like like I'm so
 

4993
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:07,669
think I've been able to like like I'm so
deeply embedded in what we are uh

4994
01:35:07,669 --> 01:35:07,679
deeply embedded in what we are uh
 

4995
01:35:07,679 --> 01:35:09,870
deeply embedded in what we are uh
intellectually right now that I I don't

4996
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:09,880
intellectually right now that I I don't
 

4997
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:11,870
intellectually right now that I I don't
have an ability to see these other these

4998
01:35:11,870 --> 01:35:11,880
have an ability to see these other these
 

4999
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:14,229
have an ability to see these other these
other ones that you're describing if

5000
01:35:14,229 --> 01:35:14,239
other ones that you're describing if
 

5001
01:35:14,239 --> 01:35:15,870
other ones that you're describing if
they're there well one of the things you

5002
01:35:15,870 --> 01:35:15,880
they're there well one of the things you
 

5003
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:17,310
they're there well one of the things you
kind of described that you already spoke

5004
01:35:17,310 --> 01:35:17,320
kind of described that you already spoke
 

5005
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:19,629
kind of described that you already spoke
to you call it the great perceptual

5006
01:35:19,629 --> 01:35:19,639
to you call it the great perceptual
 

5007
01:35:19,639 --> 01:35:22,229
to you call it the great perceptual
filter yeah so there's the the famous

5008
01:35:22,229 --> 01:35:22,239
filter yeah so there's the the famous
 

5009
01:35:22,239 --> 01:35:25,149
filter yeah so there's the the famous
great filter which is B

5010
01:35:25,149 --> 01:35:25,159
great filter which is B
 

5011
01:35:25,159 --> 01:35:28,189
great filter which is B
basically the idea that there's some

5012
01:35:28,189 --> 01:35:28,199
basically the idea that there's some
 

5013
01:35:28,199 --> 01:35:31,910
basically the idea that there's some
really powerful moment in every

5014
01:35:31,910 --> 01:35:31,920
really powerful moment in every
 

5015
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:33,950
really powerful moment in every
intelligent civilization that where they

5016
01:35:33,950 --> 01:35:33,960
intelligent civilization that where they
 

5017
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:35,189
intelligent civilization that where they
destroy

5018
01:35:35,189 --> 01:35:35,199
destroy
 

5019
01:35:35,199 --> 01:35:38,149
destroy
themselves yeah that explains why we

5020
01:35:38,149 --> 01:35:38,159
themselves yeah that explains why we
 

5021
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:40,149
themselves yeah that explains why we
have not seen aliens and you're saying

5022
01:35:40,149 --> 01:35:40,159
have not seen aliens and you're saying
 

5023
01:35:40,159 --> 01:35:42,470
have not seen aliens and you're saying
that there's something like that in the

5024
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:42,480
that there's something like that in the
 

5025
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:44,149
that there's something like that in the
temporal history of the creation of

5026
01:35:44,149 --> 01:35:44,159
temporal history of the creation of
 

5027
01:35:44,159 --> 01:35:47,470
temporal history of the creation of
complex objects that at a certain point

5028
01:35:47,470 --> 01:35:47,480
complex objects that at a certain point
 

5029
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:50,189
complex objects that at a certain point
they become an Island an island too far

5030
01:35:50,189 --> 01:35:50,199
they become an Island an island too far
 

5031
01:35:50,199 --> 01:35:53,910
they become an Island an island too far
to reach based on the perceptions I not

5032
01:35:53,910 --> 01:35:53,920
to reach based on the perceptions I not
 

5033
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:55,790
to reach based on the perceptions I not
yeah I worry about it yeah but that's

5034
01:35:55,790 --> 01:35:55,800
yeah I worry about it yeah but that's
 

5035
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:58,350
yeah I worry about it yeah but that's
basically meaning there's something

5036
01:35:58,350 --> 01:35:58,360
basically meaning there's something
 

5037
01:35:58,360 --> 01:36:00,390
basically meaning there's something
fundamental about the universe where if

5038
01:36:00,390 --> 01:36:00,400
fundamental about the universe where if
 

5039
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:02,870
fundamental about the universe where if
the more complex you become the the

5040
01:36:02,870 --> 01:36:02,880
the more complex you become the the
 

5041
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:04,590
the more complex you become the the
harder it will be to perceive other

5042
01:36:04,590 --> 01:36:04,600
harder it will be to perceive other
 

5043
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:06,510
harder it will be to perceive other
complex I mean just think about us with

5044
01:36:06,510 --> 01:36:06,520
complex I mean just think about us with
 

5045
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:08,229
complex I mean just think about us with
microbial life right like we used to

5046
01:36:08,229 --> 01:36:08,239
microbial life right like we used to
 

5047
01:36:08,239 --> 01:36:10,950
microbial life right like we used to
once be cells and for most of human

5048
01:36:10,950 --> 01:36:10,960
once be cells and for most of human
 

5049
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:12,189
once be cells and for most of human
history we didn't even recognize

5050
01:36:12,189 --> 01:36:12,199
history we didn't even recognize
 

5051
01:36:12,199 --> 01:36:13,709
history we didn't even recognize
cellular life was there until we built a

5052
01:36:13,709 --> 01:36:13,719
cellular life was there until we built a
 

5053
01:36:13,719 --> 01:36:15,790
cellular life was there until we built a
new technology microscopes that allowed

5054
01:36:15,790 --> 01:36:15,800
new technology microscopes that allowed
 

5055
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:19,189
new technology microscopes that allowed
us to see them right so that's kind of

5056
01:36:19,189 --> 01:36:19,199
us to see them right so that's kind of
 

5057
01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:21,109
us to see them right so that's kind of
it's kind of weird right like like

5058
01:36:21,109 --> 01:36:21,119
it's kind of weird right like like
 

5059
01:36:21,119 --> 01:36:22,669
it's kind of weird right like like
things that and they're close to us

5060
01:36:22,669 --> 01:36:22,679
things that and they're close to us
 

5061
01:36:22,679 --> 01:36:24,470
things that and they're close to us
they're close they're everywhere but

5062
01:36:24,470 --> 01:36:24,480
they're close they're everywhere but
 

5063
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:26,430
they're close they're everywhere but
also in the history of the development

5064
01:36:26,430 --> 01:36:26,440
also in the history of the development
 

5065
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:28,390
also in the history of the development
of complex objects they're pretty close

5066
01:36:28,390 --> 01:36:28,400
of complex objects they're pretty close
 

5067
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:31,870
of complex objects they're pretty close
yeah super close super close like yeah I

5068
01:36:31,870 --> 01:36:31,880
yeah super close super close like yeah I
 

5069
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:33,750
yeah super close super close like yeah I
mean all everything on this planet is

5070
01:36:33,750 --> 01:36:33,760
mean all everything on this planet is
 

5071
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:35,910
mean all everything on this planet is
like it's like pretty much the same

5072
01:36:35,910 --> 01:36:35,920
like it's like pretty much the same
 

5073
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:38,030
like it's like pretty much the same
thing like like the space of

5074
01:36:38,030 --> 01:36:38,040
thing like like the space of
 

5075
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:41,070
thing like like the space of
possibilities is so huge it's like we're

5076
01:36:41,070 --> 01:36:41,080
possibilities is so huge it's like we're
 

5077
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:43,830
possibilities is so huge it's like we're
virtually identical so how many

5078
01:36:43,830 --> 01:36:43,840
virtually identical so how many
 

5079
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:46,229
virtually identical so how many
flavors or kinds of Life do you think

5080
01:36:46,229 --> 01:36:46,239
flavors or kinds of Life do you think
 

5081
01:36:46,239 --> 01:36:48,910
flavors or kinds of Life do you think
are possible I'm like trying to imagine

5082
01:36:48,910 --> 01:36:48,920
are possible I'm like trying to imagine
 

5083
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:50,229
are possible I'm like trying to imagine
all the little flickering lights in the

5084
01:36:50,229 --> 01:36:50,239
all the little flickering lights in the
 

5085
01:36:50,239 --> 01:36:51,629
all the little flickering lights in the
universe like in the way that you were

5086
01:36:51,629 --> 01:36:51,639
universe like in the way that you were
 

5087
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:52,870
universe like in the way that you were
describing that was kind of cool it was

5088
01:36:52,870 --> 01:36:52,880
describing that was kind of cool it was
 

5089
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:54,590
describing that was kind of cool it was
so I mean it was

5090
01:36:54,590 --> 01:36:54,600
so I mean it was
 

5091
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:57,229
so I mean it was
it was exactly that it was like lights

5092
01:36:57,229 --> 01:36:57,239
it was exactly that it was like lights
 

5093
01:36:57,239 --> 01:36:59,390
it was exactly that it was like lights
yeah the the way you maybe see a city

5094
01:36:59,390 --> 01:36:59,400
yeah the the way you maybe see a city
 

5095
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:03,870
yeah the the way you maybe see a city
but a city from like up above you see a

5096
01:37:03,870 --> 01:37:03,880
but a city from like up above you see a
 

5097
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:05,229
but a city from like up above you see a
city with the flickering lights but

5098
01:37:05,229 --> 01:37:05,239
city with the flickering lights but
 

5099
01:37:05,239 --> 01:37:07,750
city with the flickering lights but
there's a coldness to the city uh

5100
01:37:07,750 --> 01:37:07,760
there's a coldness to the city uh
 

5101
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:09,390
there's a coldness to the city uh
there's some you know that you know

5102
01:37:09,390 --> 01:37:09,400
there's some you know that you know
 

5103
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:11,109
there's some you know that you know
humans are capable of Good and Evil and

5104
01:37:11,109 --> 01:37:11,119
humans are capable of Good and Evil and
 

5105
01:37:11,119 --> 01:37:12,830
humans are capable of Good and Evil and
you could see like there's a complex

5106
01:37:12,830 --> 01:37:12,840
you could see like there's a complex
 

5107
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:14,790
you could see like there's a complex
feeling to the city I had no such

5108
01:37:14,790 --> 01:37:14,800
feeling to the city I had no such
 

5109
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:17,870
feeling to the city I had no such
complex feeling about seeing the

5110
01:37:17,870 --> 01:37:17,880
complex feeling about seeing the
 

5111
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:20,750
complex feeling about seeing the
lights of uh all the galaxies whatever

5112
01:37:20,750 --> 01:37:20,760
lights of uh all the galaxies whatever
 

5113
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:22,750
lights of uh all the galaxies whatever
the billions of galaxies yeah this is

5114
01:37:22,750 --> 01:37:22,760
the billions of galaxies yeah this is
 

5115
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:24,310
the billions of galaxies yeah this is
kind of cool a question a second but I

5116
01:37:24,310 --> 01:37:24,320
kind of cool a question a second but I
 

5117
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:26,070
kind of cool a question a second but I
just maybe like this idea of flickering

5118
01:37:26,070 --> 01:37:26,080
just maybe like this idea of flickering
 

5119
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:28,030
just maybe like this idea of flickering
lights and intelligence is interesting

5120
01:37:28,030 --> 01:37:28,040
lights and intelligence is interesting
 

5121
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:29,870
lights and intelligence is interesting
to me because I you know like we have

5122
01:37:29,870 --> 01:37:29,880
to me because I you know like we have
 

5123
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:32,870
to me because I you know like we have
such a human Centric view of alien

5124
01:37:32,870 --> 01:37:32,880
such a human Centric view of alien
 

5125
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:34,870
such a human Centric view of alien
intelligences that a lot of the work

5126
01:37:34,870 --> 01:37:34,880
intelligences that a lot of the work
 

5127
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:36,189
intelligences that a lot of the work
that I've been doing with my lab is just

5128
01:37:36,189 --> 01:37:36,199
that I've been doing with my lab is just
 

5129
01:37:36,199 --> 01:37:40,030
that I've been doing with my lab is just
trying to take inspiration from uh

5130
01:37:40,030 --> 01:37:40,040
trying to take inspiration from uh
 

5131
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:43,430
trying to take inspiration from uh
non-human life on Earth and so I have

5132
01:37:43,430 --> 01:37:43,440
non-human life on Earth and so I have
 

5133
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:45,470
non-human life on Earth and so I have
this really talented undergrad student

5134
01:37:45,470 --> 01:37:45,480
this really talented undergrad student
 

5135
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:48,270
this really talented undergrad student
that's basically building a model of

5136
01:37:48,270 --> 01:37:48,280
that's basically building a model of
 

5137
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:50,950
that's basically building a model of
alien communication based on fireflies

5138
01:37:50,950 --> 01:37:50,960
alien communication based on fireflies
 

5139
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:53,589
alien communication based on fireflies
so one of my colleagues or at pel is

5140
01:37:53,589 --> 01:37:53,599
so one of my colleagues or at pel is
 

5141
01:37:53,599 --> 01:37:55,430
so one of my colleagues or at pel is
she's totally brilliant but she she goes

5142
01:37:55,430 --> 01:37:55,440
she's totally brilliant but she she goes
 

5143
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:57,350
she's totally brilliant but she she goes
out with like GoPro cameras and like you

5144
01:37:57,350 --> 01:37:57,360
out with like GoPro cameras and like you
 

5145
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:59,070
out with like GoPro cameras and like you
know films in high resolution all these

5146
01:37:59,070 --> 01:37:59,080
know films in high resolution all these
 

5147
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:01,109
know films in high resolution all these
Firefly flickering and she has like this

5148
01:38:01,109 --> 01:38:01,119
Firefly flickering and she has like this
 

5149
01:38:01,119 --> 01:38:03,310
Firefly flickering and she has like this
theory about how their signaling evolve

5150
01:38:03,310 --> 01:38:03,320
theory about how their signaling evolve
 

5151
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:05,149
theory about how their signaling evolve
to like maximally

5152
01:38:05,149 --> 01:38:05,159
to like maximally
 

5153
01:38:05,159 --> 01:38:08,109
to like maximally
differentiate um the flickering pattern

5154
01:38:08,109 --> 01:38:08,119
differentiate um the flickering pattern
 

5155
01:38:08,119 --> 01:38:10,589
differentiate um the flickering pattern
so like she has a theory basically that

5156
01:38:10,589 --> 01:38:10,599
so like she has a theory basically that
 

5157
01:38:10,599 --> 01:38:12,030
so like she has a theory basically that
predicts you know like this species

5158
01:38:12,030 --> 01:38:12,040
predicts you know like this species
 

5159
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:14,030
predicts you know like this species
should flash like this if this one's

5160
01:38:14,030 --> 01:38:14,040
should flash like this if this one's
 

5161
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:15,189
should flash like this if this one's
flashing like this this other one's

5162
01:38:15,189 --> 01:38:15,199
flashing like this this other one's
 

5163
01:38:15,199 --> 01:38:16,950
flashing like this this other one's
going to do it at a slower rate so that

5164
01:38:16,950 --> 01:38:16,960
going to do it at a slower rate so that
 

5165
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,750
going to do it at a slower rate so that
they you know like they can distinguish

5166
01:38:18,750 --> 01:38:18,760
they you know like they can distinguish
 

5167
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:20,030
they you know like they can distinguish
each other living in the same

5168
01:38:20,030 --> 01:38:20,040
each other living in the same
 

5169
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:21,990
each other living in the same
environment and so this undergrad is

5170
01:38:21,990 --> 01:38:22,000
environment and so this undergrad is
 

5171
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,589
environment and so this undergrad is
building this model where you have like

5172
01:38:23,589 --> 01:38:23,599
building this model where you have like
 

5173
01:38:23,599 --> 01:38:25,350
building this model where you have like
a pulsar background of all these like

5174
01:38:25,350 --> 01:38:25,360
a pulsar background of all these like
 

5175
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:27,070
a pulsar background of all these like
giant flashing sources in the universe

5176
01:38:27,070 --> 01:38:27,080
giant flashing sources in the universe
 

5177
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:29,149
giant flashing sources in the universe
and an alien intelligence you know wants

5178
01:38:29,149 --> 01:38:29,159
and an alien intelligence you know wants
 

5179
01:38:29,159 --> 01:38:30,990
and an alien intelligence you know wants
to Signal it's there so it's flashing

5180
01:38:30,990 --> 01:38:31,000
to Signal it's there so it's flashing
 

5181
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:34,149
to Signal it's there so it's flashing
like a firly uh and I just like I like

5182
01:38:34,149 --> 01:38:34,159
like a firly uh and I just like I like
 

5183
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:36,189
like a firly uh and I just like I like
the idea of thinking about non-human

5184
01:38:36,189 --> 01:38:36,199
the idea of thinking about non-human
 

5185
01:38:36,199 --> 01:38:37,870
the idea of thinking about non-human
aliens so that was really fun the

5186
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:37,880
aliens so that was really fun the
 

5187
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:39,950
aliens so that was really fun the
mechanism of the flashing unfortunately

5188
01:38:39,950 --> 01:38:39,960
mechanism of the flashing unfortunately
 

5189
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:41,950
mechanism of the flashing unfortunately
is like the diversity of that is very

5190
01:38:41,950 --> 01:38:41,960
is like the diversity of that is very
 

5191
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:43,669
is like the diversity of that is very
high and we might not be able to see it

5192
01:38:43,669 --> 01:38:43,679
high and we might not be able to see it
 

5193
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:45,350
high and we might not be able to see it
that's what yeah well I think there's

5194
01:38:45,350 --> 01:38:45,360
that's what yeah well I think there's
 

5195
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:46,390
that's what yeah well I think there's
some ways we might be able to

5196
01:38:46,390 --> 01:38:46,400
some ways we might be able to
 

5197
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,790
some ways we might be able to
differentiate that signal I'm still

5198
01:38:47,790 --> 01:38:47,800
differentiate that signal I'm still
 

5199
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:49,709
differentiate that signal I'm still
thinking about this part of it so one is

5200
01:38:49,709 --> 01:38:49,719
thinking about this part of it so one is
 

5201
01:38:49,719 --> 01:38:52,229
thinking about this part of it so one is
like like if you have pulsars and they

5202
01:38:52,229 --> 01:38:52,239
like like if you have pulsars and they
 

5203
01:38:52,239 --> 01:38:54,070
like like if you have pulsars and they
all have a certain Spectrum to their

5204
01:38:54,070 --> 01:38:54,080
all have a certain Spectrum to their
 

5205
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:56,629
all have a certain Spectrum to their
pulsing patterns and you have this one

5206
01:38:56,629 --> 01:38:56,639
pulsing patterns and you have this one
 

5207
01:38:56,639 --> 01:38:58,149
pulsing patterns and you have this one
signal that's in there that's basically

5208
01:38:58,149 --> 01:38:58,159
signal that's in there that's basically
 

5209
01:38:58,159 --> 01:39:00,109
signal that's in there that's basically
tried to maximally differentiate itself

5210
01:39:00,109 --> 01:39:00,119
tried to maximally differentiate itself
 

5211
01:39:00,119 --> 01:39:01,189
tried to maximally differentiate itself
from all the other sources in the

5212
01:39:01,189 --> 01:39:01,199
from all the other sources in the
 

5213
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:03,189
from all the other sources in the
universe it might stick out in the

5214
01:39:03,189 --> 01:39:03,199
universe it might stick out in the
 

5215
01:39:03,199 --> 01:39:04,629
universe it might stick out in the
distribution like there might be ways of

5216
01:39:04,629 --> 01:39:04,639
distribution like there might be ways of
 

5217
01:39:04,639 --> 01:39:06,109
distribution like there might be ways of
actually being able to tell if it's it's

5218
01:39:06,109 --> 01:39:06,119
actually being able to tell if it's it's
 

5219
01:39:06,119 --> 01:39:09,229
actually being able to tell if it's it's
an anomalous Pulsar basically um but I

5220
01:39:09,229 --> 01:39:09,239
an anomalous Pulsar basically um but I
 

5221
01:39:09,239 --> 01:39:10,510
an anomalous Pulsar basically um but I
don't know if that would really work or

5222
01:39:10,510 --> 01:39:10,520
don't know if that would really work or
 

5223
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:12,950
don't know if that would really work or
not so still thinking about it you

5224
01:39:12,950 --> 01:39:12,960
not so still thinking about it you
 

5225
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:15,070
not so still thinking about it you
tweeted if one wants to understand how

5226
01:39:15,070 --> 01:39:15,080
tweeted if one wants to understand how
 

5227
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:16,430
tweeted if one wants to understand how
truly combinatorially and

5228
01:39:16,430 --> 01:39:16,440
truly combinatorially and
 

5229
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:19,350
truly combinatorially and
compositionally complex our universe is

5230
01:39:19,350 --> 01:39:19,360
compositionally complex our universe is
 

5231
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:21,669
compositionally complex our universe is

they only need step into the world of

they only need step into the world of
fashion yeah it's B unkers how big the

5234
01:39:25,550 --> 01:39:25,560
fashion yeah it's B unkers how big the
 

5235
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:27,990
fashion yeah it's B unkers how big the
construct constructible space of human

5236
01:39:27,990 --> 01:39:28,000
construct constructible space of human
 

5237
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,950
construct constructible space of human
Aesthetics is uh can you explain can can

5238
01:39:30,950 --> 01:39:30,960
Aesthetics is uh can you explain can can
 

5239
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:33,350
Aesthetics is uh can you explain can can
we explore the space of human

5240
01:39:33,350 --> 01:39:33,360
we explore the space of human
 

5241
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:35,910
we explore the space of human
Aesthetics yeah I don't know um I've

5242
01:39:35,910 --> 01:39:35,920
Aesthetics yeah I don't know um I've
 

5243
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:38,310
Aesthetics yeah I don't know um I've
been kind of obsessed with the uh I

5244
01:39:38,310 --> 01:39:38,320
been kind of obsessed with the uh I
 

5245
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:40,070
been kind of obsessed with the uh I
never know how to pronounce it chappelli

5246
01:39:40,070 --> 01:39:40,080
never know how to pronounce it chappelli
 

5247
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:41,589
never know how to pronounce it chappelli
like you know like like they they have

5248
01:39:41,589 --> 01:39:41,599
like you know like like they they have
 

5249
01:39:41,599 --> 01:39:43,510
like you know like like they they have
ears and things like it's such like a

5250
01:39:43,510 --> 01:39:43,520
ears and things like it's such like a
 

5251
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:45,470
ears and things like it's such like a
like a weird grotesque aesthetic but

5252
01:39:45,470 --> 01:39:45,480
like a weird grotesque aesthetic but
 

5253
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:48,709
like a weird grotesque aesthetic but
like it's it's totally bizarre um but

5254
01:39:48,709 --> 01:39:48,719
like it's it's totally bizarre um but
 

5255
01:39:48,719 --> 01:39:50,149
like it's it's totally bizarre um but
what I meant like I like I have a

5256
01:39:50,149 --> 01:39:50,159
what I meant like I like I have a
 

5257
01:39:50,159 --> 01:39:52,030
what I meant like I like I have a
visceral experience when I walk into my

5258
01:39:52,030 --> 01:39:52,040
visceral experience when I walk into my
 

5259
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:55,310
visceral experience when I walk into my
closet I have like a lot of how big is

5260
01:39:55,310 --> 01:39:55,320
closet I have like a lot of how big is
 

5261
01:39:55,320 --> 01:39:58,470
closet I have like a lot of how big is
your closet it's pretty big uh it's like

5262
01:39:58,470 --> 01:39:58,480
your closet it's pretty big uh it's like
 

5263
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:00,189
your closet it's pretty big uh it's like
I do assembly Theory every morning when

5264
01:40:00,189 --> 01:40:00,199
I do assembly Theory every morning when
 

5265
01:40:00,199 --> 01:40:02,390
I do assembly Theory every morning when
I walk in my closet because I have I

5266
01:40:02,390 --> 01:40:02,400
I walk in my closet because I have I
 

5267
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:04,790
I walk in my closet because I have I
like I really like a very large Comon

5268
01:40:04,790 --> 01:40:04,800
like I really like a very large Comon
 

5269
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:06,350
like I really like a very large Comon
tutorial diverse palette but I never

5270
01:40:06,350 --> 01:40:06,360
tutorial diverse palette but I never
 

5271
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:07,470
tutorial diverse palette but I never
know what I'm going to build in the

5272
01:40:07,470 --> 01:40:07,480
know what I'm going to build in the
 

5273
01:40:07,480 --> 01:40:09,750
know what I'm going to build in the
morning do you get rid of stuff

5274
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:09,760
morning do you get rid of stuff
 

5275
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:11,750
morning do you get rid of stuff
sometimes or do you have trouble getting

5276
01:40:11,750 --> 01:40:11,760
sometimes or do you have trouble getting
 

5277
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:13,229
sometimes or do you have trouble getting
rid of St like I have trouble getting

5278
01:40:13,229 --> 01:40:13,239
rid of St like I have trouble getting
 

5279
01:40:13,239 --> 01:40:14,990
rid of St like I have trouble getting
rid of some stuff it depends on what it

5280
01:40:14,990 --> 01:40:15,000
rid of some stuff it depends on what it
 

5281
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,750
rid of some stuff it depends on what it
is if it's very if it's vintage it's

5282
01:40:16,750 --> 01:40:16,760
is if it's very if it's vintage it's
 

5283
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:17,910
is if it's very if it's vintage it's
hard to get rid of because it's kind of

5284
01:40:17,910 --> 01:40:17,920
hard to get rid of because it's kind of
 

5285
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:20,629
hard to get rid of because it's kind of
hard to replace um it depends on the

5286
01:40:20,629 --> 01:40:20,639
hard to replace um it depends on the
 

5287
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:24,149
hard to replace um it depends on the
piece yeah so you have your closet is is

5288
01:40:24,149 --> 01:40:24,159
piece yeah so you have your closet is is
 

5289
01:40:24,159 --> 01:40:26,470
piece yeah so you have your closet is is
the one of those temporal time crystals

5290
01:40:26,470 --> 01:40:26,480
the one of those temporal time crystals
 

5291
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:29,270
the one of those temporal time crystals
that yeah they just you get to visualize

5292
01:40:29,270 --> 01:40:29,280
that yeah they just you get to visualize
 

5293
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:31,030
that yeah they just you get to visualize
the entire history it's a physical

5294
01:40:31,030 --> 01:40:31,040
the entire history it's a physical
 

5295
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:34,589
the entire history it's a physical
manifestation of my personality right uh

5296
01:40:34,589 --> 01:40:34,599
manifestation of my personality right uh
 

5297
01:40:34,599 --> 01:40:37,229
manifestation of my personality right uh
so so why is that a good visualization

5298
01:40:37,229 --> 01:40:37,239
so so why is that a good visualization
 

5299
01:40:37,239 --> 01:40:39,270
so so why is that a good visualization
of the the the

5300
01:40:39,270 --> 01:40:39,280
of the the the
 

5301
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:41,870
of the the the
combinatorial and uh compositionally

5302
01:40:41,870 --> 01:40:41,880
combinatorial and uh compositionally
 

5303
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:43,589
combinatorial and uh compositionally
complex I think it's an interesting

5304
01:40:43,589 --> 01:40:43,599
complex I think it's an interesting
 

5305
01:40:43,599 --> 01:40:46,430
complex I think it's an interesting
feature of our species that we allow we

5306
01:40:46,430 --> 01:40:46,440
feature of our species that we allow we
 

5307
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:48,070
feature of our species that we allow we
get to express ourselves through what we

5308
01:40:48,070 --> 01:40:48,080
get to express ourselves through what we
 

5309
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:50,270
get to express ourselves through what we
wear right like if you think about all

5310
01:40:50,270 --> 01:40:50,280
wear right like if you think about all
 

5311
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:52,470
wear right like if you think about all
those animals in the jungle you saw like

5312
01:40:52,470 --> 01:40:52,480
those animals in the jungle you saw like
 

5313
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:54,350
those animals in the jungle you saw like
they're born looking the way they look

5314
01:40:54,350 --> 01:40:54,360

it's not um so this is like very highly
 

5621
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:40,510
it's not um so this is like very highly
intellectual and I think it's a lot like

5622
01:46:40,510 --> 01:46:40,520
intellectual and I think it's a lot like
 

5623
01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:42,109
intellectual and I think it's a lot like
how I play with language is the same way

5624
01:46:42,109 --> 01:46:42,119
how I play with language is the same way
 

5625
01:46:42,119 --> 01:46:43,750
how I play with language is the same way
that I play with fashion or the same way

5626
01:46:43,750 --> 01:46:43,760
that I play with fashion or the same way
 

5627
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:45,270
that I play with fashion or the same way
that I play with ideas in theoretical

5628
01:46:45,270 --> 01:46:45,280
that I play with ideas in theoretical
 

5629
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:47,390
that I play with ideas in theoretical
physics like there's always this space

5630
01:46:47,390 --> 01:46:47,400
physics like there's always this space
 

5631
01:46:47,400 --> 01:46:49,030
physics like there's always this space
that you can just push things just

5632
01:46:49,030 --> 01:46:49,040
that you can just push things just
 

5633
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:51,390
that you can just push things just
enough so they're like they look like

5634
01:46:51,390 --> 01:46:51,400
enough so they're like they look like
 

5635
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:53,149
enough so they're like they look like
something someone thinks is familiar but

5636
01:46:53,149 --> 01:46:53,159
something someone thinks is familiar but
 

5637
01:46:53,159 --> 01:46:57,109
something someone thinks is familiar but
they're not familiar um and yeah and I

5638
01:46:57,109 --> 01:46:57,119
they're not familiar um and yeah and I
 

5639
01:46:57,119 --> 01:46:59,629
they're not familiar um and yeah and I
think that's really cool it seems like

5640
01:46:59,629 --> 01:46:59,639
think that's really cool it seems like
 

5641
01:46:59,639 --> 01:47:01,750
think that's really cool it seems like
beauty doesn't have much function right

5642
01:47:01,750 --> 01:47:01,760
beauty doesn't have much function right
 

5643
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:05,669
beauty doesn't have much function right
but but it seems to also

5644
01:47:05,669 --> 01:47:05,679
but but it seems to also
 

5645
01:47:05,679 --> 01:47:08,790
but but it seems to also
have a lot of influence on the way we it

5646
01:47:08,790 --> 01:47:08,800
have a lot of influence on the way we it
 

5647
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:10,510
have a lot of influence on the way we it
has tons of what do you mean it doesn't

5648
01:47:10,510 --> 01:47:10,520
has tons of what do you mean it doesn't
 

5649
01:47:10,520 --> 01:47:12,669
has tons of what do you mean it doesn't
have function I guess sexual selection

5650
01:47:12,669 --> 01:47:12,679
have function I guess sexual selection
 

5651
01:47:12,679 --> 01:47:15,669
have function I guess sexual selection
incorporates Beauty somehow but why

5652
01:47:15,669 --> 01:47:15,679
incorporates Beauty somehow but why
 

5653
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:17,870
incorporates Beauty somehow but why
because beauty is a sign of health or

5654
01:47:17,870 --> 01:47:17,880
because beauty is a sign of health or
 

5655
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:21,270
because beauty is a sign of health or
something I don't even oh evolutionarily

5656
01:47:21,270 --> 01:47:21,280
something I don't even oh evolutionarily
 

5657
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:23,270
something I don't even oh evolutionarily
maybe but then Beauty becomes a signal

5658
01:47:23,270 --> 01:47:23,280
maybe but then Beauty becomes a signal
 

5659
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:25,430
maybe but then Beauty becomes a signal
of other things right so it's really not

5660
01:47:25,430 --> 01:47:25,440
of other things right so it's really not
 

5661
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:27,910
of other things right so it's really not
like and then Beauty becomes an Adaptive

5662
01:47:27,910 --> 01:47:27,920
like and then Beauty becomes an Adaptive
 

5663
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:29,589
like and then Beauty becomes an Adaptive
trait so it can change with different

5664
01:47:29,589 --> 01:47:29,599
trait so it can change with different
 

5665
01:47:29,599 --> 01:47:31,669
trait so it can change with different
spe like you know maybe some PE some

5666
01:47:31,669 --> 01:47:31,679
spe like you know maybe some PE some
 

5667
01:47:31,679 --> 01:47:33,270
spe like you know maybe some PE some
species would think well you thought the

5668
01:47:33,270 --> 01:47:33,280
species would think well you thought the

Frog having babies come out of its back

5670
01:47:35,149 --> 01:47:35,159
Frog having babies come out of its back
 

5671
01:47:35,159 --> 01:47:36,470
Frog having babies come out of its back
was beautiful and I thought it was

5672
01:47:36,470 --> 01:47:36,480
was beautiful and I thought it was
 

5673
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:38,910
was beautiful and I thought it was
grotesque like there's not a universal

5674
01:47:38,910 --> 01:47:38,920
grotesque like there's not a universal
 

5675
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:41,550
grotesque like there's not a universal
definition of what's beautiful it is

5676
01:47:41,550 --> 01:47:41,560
definition of what's beautiful it is
 

5677
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:43,910
definition of what's beautiful it is
something that is dependent on your

5678
01:47:43,910 --> 01:47:43,920
something that is dependent on your
 

5679
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:46,070
something that is dependent on your
history and how you interact with the

5680
01:47:46,070 --> 01:47:46,080
history and how you interact with the
 

5681
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:49,030
history and how you interact with the
world and I guess what I like about

5682
01:47:49,030 --> 01:47:49,040
world and I guess what I like about
 

5683
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:50,910
world and I guess what I like about
beauty like any other concept is when

5684
01:47:50,910 --> 01:47:50,920
beauty like any other concept is when
 

5685
01:47:50,920 --> 01:47:53,910
beauty like any other concept is when
you turn it on its head so um you know

5686
01:47:53,910 --> 01:47:53,920
you turn it on its head so um you know
 

5687
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:57,910
you turn it on its head so um you know
maybe the traditional uh conception of

5688
01:47:57,910 --> 01:47:57,920
maybe the traditional uh conception of
 

5689
01:47:57,920 --> 01:48:00,790
maybe the traditional uh conception of
you know why women wear makeup and they

5690
01:48:00,790 --> 01:48:00,800
you know why women wear makeup and they
 

5691
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:02,790
you know why women wear makeup and they
dress certain ways is because they want

5692
01:48:02,790 --> 01:48:02,800
dress certain ways is because they want
 

5693
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:06,109
dress certain ways is because they want
to look beautiful and you know pleasing

5694
01:48:06,109 --> 01:48:06,119
to look beautiful and you know pleasing
 

5695
01:48:06,119 --> 01:48:09,470
to look beautiful and you know pleasing
to people and I just like to do it cuz

5696
01:48:09,470 --> 01:48:09,480
to people and I just like to do it cuz
 

5697
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:12,310
to people and I just like to do it cuz
it's a confidence thing it's about

5698
01:48:12,310 --> 01:48:12,320
it's a confidence thing it's about
 

5699
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:14,990
it's a confidence thing it's about
embodying uh the person that I want to

5700
01:48:14,990 --> 01:48:15,000
embodying uh the person that I want to
 

5701
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:19,270
embodying uh the person that I want to
be and about owning that person and then

5702
01:48:19,270 --> 01:48:19,280
be and about owning that person and then
 

5703
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:20,589
be and about owning that person and then
that the way that people interact with

5704
01:48:20,589 --> 01:48:20,599
that the way that people interact with
 

5705
01:48:20,599 --> 01:48:22,350
that the way that people interact with
that person is very different than if I

5706
01:48:22,350 --> 01:48:22,360
that person is very different than if I
 

5707
01:48:22,360 --> 01:48:24,550
that person is very different than if I
didn't have the like if I wasn't using

5708
01:48:24,550 --> 01:48:24,560
didn't have the like if I wasn't using
 

5709
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:27,350
didn't have the like if I wasn't using
that attribute as part of and obviously

5710
01:48:27,350 --> 01:48:27,360
that attribute as part of and obviously
 

5711
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:29,550
that attribute as part of and obviously
that that's influenced by the society I

5712
01:48:29,550 --> 01:48:29,560
that that's influenced by the society I
 

5713
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:30,910
that that's influenced by the society I
live and like what's aesthetically

5714
01:48:30,910 --> 01:48:30,920
live and like what's aesthetically
 

5715
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:32,470
live and like what's aesthetically
pleasing things but it's interesting to

5716
01:48:32,470 --> 01:48:32,480
pleasing things but it's interesting to
 

5717
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:33,910
pleasing things but it's interesting to
be able to turn that around and not have

5718
01:48:33,910 --> 01:48:33,920
be able to turn that around and not have
 

5719
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:35,950
be able to turn that around and not have
it necessarily be about the Aesthetics

5720
01:48:35,950 --> 01:48:35,960
it necessarily be about the Aesthetics
 

5721
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:37,510
it necessarily be about the Aesthetics
but about the power dynamics that the

5722
01:48:37,510 --> 01:48:37,520
but about the power dynamics that the
 

5723
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:39,070
but about the power dynamics that the
Aesthetics create but you're saying

5724
01:48:39,070 --> 01:48:39,080
Aesthetics create but you're saying
 

5725
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:41,229
Aesthetics create but you're saying
there's some function to Beauty in that

5726
01:48:41,229 --> 01:48:41,239
there's some function to Beauty in that
 

5727
01:48:41,239 --> 01:48:42,790
there's some function to Beauty in that
way in the way you're describing in the

5728
01:48:42,790 --> 01:48:42,800
way in the way you're describing in the
 

5729
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:44,189
way in the way you're describing in the
dynamic it creates in the social

5730
01:48:44,189 --> 01:48:44,199
dynamic it creates in the social
 

5731
01:48:44,199 --> 01:48:45,750
dynamic it creates in the social
interaction well well the point is

5732
01:48:45,750 --> 01:48:45,760
interaction well well the point is
 

5733
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:47,629
interaction well well the point is
you're saying it's an Adaptive trait for

5734
01:48:47,629 --> 01:48:47,639
you're saying it's an Adaptive trait for
 

5735
01:48:47,639 --> 01:48:49,350
you're saying it's an Adaptive trait for
like sexual selection or something and

5736
01:48:49,350 --> 01:48:49,360
like sexual selection or something and
 

5737
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:50,990
like sexual selection or something and
I'm saying that the adaptation that

5738
01:48:50,990 --> 01:48:51,000
I'm saying that the adaptation that
 

5739
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,870
I'm saying that the adaptation that
beauty confers is far richer than that

5740
01:48:53,870 --> 01:48:53,880
beauty confers is far richer than that
 

5741
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:56,270
beauty confers is far richer than that
and some of the adaptation is about

5742
01:48:56,270 --> 01:48:56,280
and some of the adaptation is about
 

5743
01:48:56,280 --> 01:48:59,229
and some of the adaptation is about
social hierarchy and social Mobility um

5744
01:48:59,229 --> 01:48:59,239
social hierarchy and social Mobility um
 

5745
01:48:59,239 --> 01:49:01,310
social hierarchy and social Mobility um
and just plain social dynamics like why

5746
01:49:01,310 --> 01:49:01,320
and just plain social dynamics like why
 

5747
01:49:01,320 --> 01:49:03,709
and just plain social dynamics like why
do some people dress goth it's because

5748
01:49:03,709 --> 01:49:03,719
do some people dress goth it's because
 

5749
01:49:03,719 --> 01:49:05,470
do some people dress goth it's because
they identify with a community and a

5750
01:49:05,470 --> 01:49:05,480
they identify with a community and a
 

5751
01:49:05,480 --> 01:49:07,149
they identify with a community and a
culture associated with that and they

5752
01:49:07,149 --> 01:49:07,159
culture associated with that and they
 

5753
01:49:07,159 --> 01:49:09,189
culture associated with that and they
get you know and that's a beautiful

5754
01:49:09,189 --> 01:49:09,199
get you know and that's a beautiful
 

5755
01:49:09,199 --> 01:49:10,910
get you know and that's a beautiful
aesthetic uh it's it's a different

5756
01:49:10,910 --> 01:49:10,920
aesthetic uh it's it's a different
 

5757
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:13,070
aesthetic uh it's it's a different
aesthetic some people don't like it um

5758
01:49:13,070 --> 01:49:13,080
aesthetic some people don't like it um
 

5759
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:15,229
aesthetic some people don't like it um
so it has the same richness as does

5760
01:49:15,229 --> 01:49:15,239
so it has the same richness as does
 

5761
01:49:15,239 --> 01:49:18,229
so it has the same richness as does
language yes it's the same kind of yes

5762
01:49:18,229 --> 01:49:18,239
language yes it's the same kind of yes
 

5763
01:49:18,239 --> 01:49:21,350
language yes it's the same kind of yes
and I think I think too few people think

5764
01:49:21,350 --> 01:49:21,360
and I think I think too few people think
 

5765
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:24,390
and I think I think too few people think
about the way way that they the

5766
01:49:24,390 --> 01:49:24,400
about the way way that they the
 

5767
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:25,990
about the way way that they the
Aesthetics they build for themselves in

5768
01:49:25,990 --> 01:49:26,000
Aesthetics they build for themselves in
 

5769
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:27,350
Aesthetics they build for themselves in
the morning and how they carry it in the

5770
01:49:27,350 --> 01:49:27,360
the morning and how they carry it in the
 

5771
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:29,709
the morning and how they carry it in the
world and and the way that other people

5772
01:49:29,709 --> 01:49:29,719
world and and the way that other people
 

5773
01:49:29,719 --> 01:49:31,910
world and and the way that other people
interact with that because they put

our mind and the way that we use

girdle did but also this idea of signs

5834
01:50:43,510 --> 01:50:43,520
girdle did but also this idea of signs
 

5835
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:45,149
girdle did but also this idea of signs
and symbols and and all kinds of ways of

5836
01:50:45,149 --> 01:50:45,159
and symbols and and all kinds of ways of
 

5837
01:50:45,159 --> 01:50:47,870
and symbols and and all kinds of ways of
separating them there's like the word

5838
01:50:47,870 --> 01:50:47,880
separating them there's like the word
 

5839
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:49,229
separating them there's like the word
right and then there's like what the

5840
01:50:49,229 --> 01:50:49,239
right and then there's like what the
 

5841
01:50:49,239 --> 01:50:52,189
right and then there's like what the
word means about the world and we often

5842
01:50:52,189 --> 01:50:52,199
word means about the world and we often
 

5843
01:50:52,199 --> 01:50:57,510
word means about the world and we often
confuse those things and what I I feel

5844
01:50:57,510 --> 01:50:57,520
confuse those things and what I I feel
 

5845
01:50:57,520 --> 01:50:59,149
confuse those things and what I I feel
very viscerally I almost sometimes think

5846
01:50:59,149 --> 01:50:59,159
very viscerally I almost sometimes think
 

5847
01:50:59,159 --> 01:51:00,830
very viscerally I almost sometimes think
I have some kind of like synesthesia for

5848
01:51:00,830 --> 01:51:00,840
I have some kind of like synesthesia for
 

5849
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:02,189
I have some kind of like synesthesia for
language or something and I just like

5850
01:51:02,189 --> 01:51:02,199
language or something and I just like
 

5851
01:51:02,199 --> 01:51:03,750
language or something and I just like
don't interact with it like the way that

5852
01:51:03,750 --> 01:51:03,760
don't interact with it like the way that
 

5853
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:06,750
don't interact with it like the way that
other people do um but for me words are

5854
01:51:06,750 --> 01:51:06,760
other people do um but for me words are
 

5855
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:08,350
other people do um but for me words are
objects and the objects are not the

5856
01:51:08,350 --> 01:51:08,360
objects and the objects are not the
 

5857
01:51:08,360 --> 01:51:09,709
objects and the objects are not the
things that they describe they have like

5858
01:51:09,709 --> 01:51:09,719
things that they describe they have like
 

5859
01:51:09,719 --> 01:51:12,310
things that they describe they have like
a different ontology to them uh like

5860
01:51:12,310 --> 01:51:12,320
a different ontology to them uh like
 

5861
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:14,510
a different ontology to them uh like
they're physical things um and they

5862
01:51:14,510 --> 01:51:14,520
they're physical things um and they
 

5863
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:16,870
they're physical things um and they
carry causation and they can create

5864
01:51:16,870 --> 01:51:16,880
carry causation and they can create
 

5865
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:19,390
carry causation and they can create
meaning um but they're

5866
01:51:19,390 --> 01:51:19,400
meaning um but they're
 

5867
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:22,310
meaning um but they're
not they're not they're not what we

5868
01:51:22,310 --> 01:51:22,320
not they're not they're not what we
 

5869
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:24,510
not they're not they're not what we
think they are and and also like the

5870
01:51:24,510 --> 01:51:24,520
think they are and and also like the
 

5871
01:51:24,520 --> 01:51:26,229
think they are and and also like the
internal representations in our mind

5872
01:51:26,229 --> 01:51:26,239
internal representations in our mind
 

5873
01:51:26,239 --> 01:51:27,550
internal representations in our mind
like the things I'm seeing about this

5874
01:51:27,550 --> 01:51:27,560
like the things I'm seeing about this
 

5875
01:51:27,560 --> 01:51:29,430
like the things I'm seeing about this
room are probably you know like they

5876
01:51:29,430 --> 01:51:29,440
room are probably you know like they
 

5877
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:31,310
room are probably you know like they
small projection of the things that are

5878
01:51:31,310 --> 01:51:31,320
small projection of the things that are
 

5879
01:51:31,320 --> 01:51:33,069
small projection of the things that are
actually in this room and I think we

5880
01:51:33,069 --> 01:51:33,079
actually in this room and I think we
 

5881
01:51:33,079 --> 01:51:36,629
actually in this room and I think we
have such a difficult time moving past

5882
01:51:36,629 --> 01:51:36,639
have such a difficult time moving past
 

5883
01:51:36,639 --> 01:51:38,629
have such a difficult time moving past
the way that we build representations in

5884
01:51:38,629 --> 01:51:38,639
the way that we build representations in
 

5885
01:51:38,639 --> 01:51:39,950
the way that we build representations in
the mind and the way that we structure

5886
01:51:39,950 --> 01:51:39,960
the mind and the way that we structure
 

5887
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:41,669
the mind and the way that we structure
our language to realize that those are

5888
01:51:41,669 --> 01:51:41,679
our language to realize that those are
 

5889
01:51:41,679 --> 01:51:43,270
our language to realize that those are
approximations to what's out there and

5890
01:51:43,270 --> 01:51:43,280
approximations to what's out there and
 

5891
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:44,629
approximations to what's out there and
they're fluid and we can play around

5892
01:51:44,629 --> 01:51:44,639
they're fluid and we can play around
 

5893
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:45,709
they're fluid and we can play around
with them and we can see deeper

5894
01:51:45,709 --> 01:51:45,719
with them and we can see deeper
 

5895
01:51:45,719 --> 01:51:48,629
with them and we can see deeper
structure underneath them that um I

5896
01:51:48,629 --> 01:51:48,639
structure underneath them that um I
 

5897
01:51:48,639 --> 01:51:51,390
structure underneath them that um I
think like we're missing a lot yeah but

5898
01:51:51,390 --> 01:51:51,400
think like we're missing a lot yeah but
 

5899
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:53,149
think like we're missing a lot yeah but
also the life of the mind is

5900
01:51:53,149 --> 01:51:53,159
also the life of the mind is
 

5901
01:51:53,159 --> 01:51:55,589
also the life of the mind is
in some ways richer than the physical

5902
01:51:55,589 --> 01:51:55,599
in some ways richer than the physical
 

5903
01:51:55,599 --> 01:51:57,990
in some ways richer than the physical
reality what's going on in your

5904
01:51:57,990 --> 01:51:58,000
reality what's going on in your
 

5905
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:01,550
reality what's going on in your
mind might be a projection actually here

5906
01:52:01,550 --> 01:52:01,560
mind might be a projection actually here
 

5907
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:03,750
mind might be a projection actually here
but there's all also all kinds of other

5908
01:52:03,750 --> 01:52:03,760
but there's all also all kinds of other
 

5909
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:05,950
but there's all also all kinds of other
stuff going on there yeah for sure I

5910
01:52:05,950 --> 01:52:05,960
stuff going on there yeah for sure I
 

5911
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:09,109
stuff going on there yeah for sure I
love this um essay by Pan about like

5912
01:52:09,109 --> 01:52:09,119
love this um essay by Pan about like
 

5913
01:52:09,119 --> 01:52:10,870
love this um essay by Pan about like
mathematical creativity where he talks

5914
01:52:10,870 --> 01:52:10,880
mathematical creativity where he talks
 

5915
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:12,390
mathematical creativity where he talks
about this sort of like frothing of all

5916
01:52:12,390 --> 01:52:12,400
about this sort of like frothing of all
 

5917
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:13,669
about this sort of like frothing of all
these things and then like somehow you

5918
01:52:13,669 --> 01:52:13,679
these things and then like somehow you
 

5919
01:52:13,679 --> 01:52:15,189
these things and then like somehow you
build theorems on top of it and they

5920
01:52:15,189 --> 01:52:15,199
build theorems on top of it and they
 

5921
01:52:15,199 --> 01:52:17,629
build theorems on top of it and they
become kind of concrete but like and I

5922
01:52:17,629 --> 01:52:17,639
become kind of concrete but like and I
 

5923
01:52:17,639 --> 01:52:19,030
become kind of concrete but like and I
also think about this with language it's

5924
01:52:19,030 --> 01:52:19,040
also think about this with language it's
 

5925
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:20,470
also think about this with language it's
like there's a lot of stuff happening in

5926
01:52:20,470 --> 01:52:20,480
like there's a lot of stuff happening in
 

5927
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:22,550
like there's a lot of stuff happening in
your mind but you have to compress it

5928
01:52:22,550 --> 01:52:22,560
your mind but you have to compress it
 

5929
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:24,189
your mind but you have to compress it
and this few sets of words to try to

5930
01:52:24,189 --> 01:52:24,199
and this few sets of words to try to
 

5931
01:52:24,199 --> 01:52:27,669
and this few sets of words to try to
convey it to someone so it's it's a

5932
01:52:27,669 --> 01:52:27,679
convey it to someone so it's it's a
 

5933
01:52:27,679 --> 01:52:30,669
convey it to someone so it's it's a
compactification of the space um and

5934
01:52:30,669 --> 01:52:30,679
compactification of the space um and
 

5935
01:52:30,679 --> 01:52:33,629
compactification of the space um and
it's not a very efficient one uh and I

5936
01:52:33,629 --> 01:52:33,639
it's not a very efficient one uh and I
 

5937
01:52:33,639 --> 01:52:35,669
it's not a very efficient one uh and I
think just recognizing that there's a

5938
01:52:35,669 --> 01:52:35,679
think just recognizing that there's a
 

5939
01:52:35,679 --> 01:52:37,510
think just recognizing that there's a
lot that's happening behind language is

5940
01:52:37,510 --> 01:52:37,520
lot that's happening behind language is
 

5941
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:39,310
lot that's happening behind language is
really important I think this is this is

5942
01:52:39,310 --> 01:52:39,320
really important I think this is this is
 

5943
01:52:39,320 --> 01:52:41,870
really important I think this is this is
one of the the great things about the

5944
01:52:41,870 --> 01:52:41,880
one of the the great things about the
 

5945
01:52:41,880 --> 01:52:43,750
one of the the great things about the
existential trauma of large language

5946
01:52:43,750 --> 01:52:43,760
existential trauma of large language
 

5947
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:46,550
existential trauma of large language
models I think is the recognition that

5948
01:52:46,550 --> 01:52:46,560
models I think is the recognition that
 

5949
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:48,390
models I think is the recognition that
language is not the only thing

5950
01:52:48,390 --> 01:52:48,400
language is not the only thing
 

5951
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:50,510
language is not the only thing
required uh like there's something

5952
01:52:50,510 --> 01:52:50,520
required uh like there's something
 

5953
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:53,189
required uh like there's something
underneath it uh not

5954
01:52:53,189 --> 01:52:53,199
underneath it uh not
 

5955
01:52:53,199 --> 01:52:56,709
underneath it uh not
everybody can you just speak

5956
01:52:56,709 --> 01:52:56,719
everybody can you just speak
 

5957
01:52:56,719 --> 01:52:59,589
everybody can you just speak
to the feeling you have when you think

5958
01:52:59,589 --> 01:52:59,599
to the feeling you have when you think
 

5959
01:52:59,599 --> 01:53:02,510
to the feeling you have when you think
about words so is there like what's the

5960
01:53:02,510 --> 01:53:02,520
about words so is there like what's the
 

5961
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:04,310
about words so is there like what's the
magic of words to you is it like do you

5962
01:53:04,310 --> 01:53:04,320
magic of words to you is it like do you
 

5963
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:07,189
magic of words to you is it like do you
feel that it almost sometimes feels like

5964
01:53:07,189 --> 01:53:07,199
feel that it almost sometimes feels like
 

5965
01:53:07,199 --> 01:53:09,830
feel that it almost sometimes feels like
you're playing with it like yeah I was

5966
01:53:09,830 --> 01:53:09,840
you're playing with it like yeah I was
 

5967
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:11,550
you're playing with it like yeah I was
just going to say it's like a playground

5968
01:53:11,550 --> 01:53:11,560
just going to say it's like a playground
 

5969
01:53:11,560 --> 01:53:13,310
just going to say it's like a playground
but but you're almost like uh I think

5970
01:53:13,310 --> 01:53:13,320
but but you're almost like uh I think
 

5971
01:53:13,320 --> 01:53:15,310
but but you're almost like uh I think
one of the things you enjoy maybe I'm

5972
01:53:15,310 --> 01:53:15,320
one of the things you enjoy maybe I'm
 

5973
01:53:15,320 --> 01:53:18,550
one of the things you enjoy maybe I'm
projecting is deviating like using words

5974
01:53:18,550 --> 01:53:18,560
projecting is deviating like using words
 

5975
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:21,069
projecting is deviating like using words
in ways that not everyone uses them like

5976
01:53:21,069 --> 01:53:21,079
in ways that not everyone uses them like
 

5977
01:53:21,079 --> 01:53:22,790
in ways that not everyone uses them like
slightly

5978
01:53:22,790 --> 01:53:22,800
slightly
 

5979
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:25,189
slightly
sort of deviating from the norm a little

5980
01:53:25,189 --> 01:53:25,199
sort of deviating from the norm a little
 

5981
01:53:25,199 --> 01:53:26,990
sort of deviating from the norm a little
bit I love doing that in everything I do

5982
01:53:26,990 --> 01:53:27,000
bit I love doing that in everything I do
 

5983
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,350
bit I love doing that in everything I do
but especially with language but not so

5984
01:53:29,350 --> 01:53:29,360
but especially with language but not so
 

5985
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:31,990
but especially with language but not so
far that it doesn't make sense exactly

5986
01:53:31,990 --> 01:53:32,000
far that it doesn't make sense exactly
 

5987
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:35,189
far that it doesn't make sense exactly
so you're always like Tethered to

5988
01:53:35,189 --> 01:53:35,199
so you're always like Tethered to
 

5989
01:53:35,199 --> 01:53:37,910
so you're always like Tethered to
reality to the norm but like are playing

5990
01:53:37,910 --> 01:53:37,920
reality to the norm but like are playing
 

5991
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:40,390
reality to the norm but like are playing
with it like basically fucking with

5992
01:53:40,390 --> 01:53:40,400
with it like basically fucking with
 

5993
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:42,790
with it like basically fucking with
people's minds a little bit I mean like

5994
01:53:42,790 --> 01:53:42,800
people's minds a little bit I mean like
 

5995
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:46,510
people's minds a little bit I mean like
you know and in so doing creating um a

5996
01:53:46,510 --> 01:53:46,520
you know and in so doing creating um a
 

5997
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:47,790
you know and in so doing creating um a
different perspective on the thing

5998
01:53:47,790 --> 01:53:47,800
different perspective on the thing
 

5999
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:50,270
different perspective on the thing
that's been previous exploring in a

6000
01:53:50,270 --> 01:53:50,280
that's been previous exploring in a
 

6001
01:53:50,280 --> 01:53:52,109
that's been previous exploring in a
different way yeah it's literally my

6002
01:53:52,109 --> 01:53:52,119
different way yeah it's literally my
 

6003
01:53:52,119 --> 01:53:55,830
different way yeah it's literally my
favorite thing to do yeah like use words

6004
01:53:55,830 --> 01:53:55,840
favorite thing to do yeah like use words
 

6005
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:58,830
favorite thing to do yeah like use words
as one way to make people think yeah so

6006
01:53:58,830 --> 01:53:58,840
as one way to make people think yeah so
 

6007
01:53:58,840 --> 01:54:02,790
as one way to make people think yeah so
I you know a lot of my sort of like what

6008
01:54:02,790 --> 01:54:02,800
I you know a lot of my sort of like what
 

6009
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:04,910
I you know a lot of my sort of like what
happens in my mind when I'm thinking

6010
01:54:04,910 --> 01:54:04,920
happens in my mind when I'm thinking
 

6011
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:06,990
happens in my mind when I'm thinking
about ideas is I've been presented with

6012
01:54:06,990 --> 01:54:07,000
about ideas is I've been presented with
 

6013
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:08,550
about ideas is I've been presented with
this information about how people think

6014
01:54:08,550 --> 01:54:08,560
this information about how people think
 

6015
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:11,910
this information about how people think
about things and I try to go around to

6016
01:54:11,910 --> 01:54:11,920
about things and I try to go around to
 

6017
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:13,510
about things and I try to go around to
different communities and hear the ways

6018
01:54:13,510 --> 01:54:13,520
different communities and hear the ways
 

6019
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:15,910
different communities and hear the ways
that different whether it's like you

6020
01:54:15,910 --> 01:54:15,920
that different whether it's like you
 

6021
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:17,550
that different whether it's like you
know hanging out with a bunch of artists

6022
01:54:17,550 --> 01:54:17,560
know hanging out with a bunch of artists
 

6023
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:19,669
know hanging out with a bunch of artists
or philosophers or scientists thinking

6024
01:54:19,669 --> 01:54:19,679
or philosophers or scientists thinking
 

6025
01:54:19,679 --> 01:54:21,550
or philosophers or scientists thinking
about things like they all think about

6026
01:54:21,550 --> 01:54:21,560
about things like they all think about
 

6027
01:54:21,560 --> 01:54:23,470
about things like they all think about
it different ways and then I just try to

6028
01:54:23,470 --> 01:54:23,480
it different ways and then I just try to
 

6029
01:54:23,480 --> 01:54:24,669
it different ways and then I just try to
figure out

6030
01:54:24,669 --> 01:54:24,679
figure out
 

6031
01:54:24,679 --> 01:54:27,149
figure out
like how do you take the structure of

6032
01:54:27,149 --> 01:54:27,159
like how do you take the structure of
 

6033
01:54:27,159 --> 01:54:29,350
like how do you take the structure of
the way that we're talking about it and

6034
01:54:29,350 --> 01:54:29,360
the way that we're talking about it and
 

6035
01:54:29,360 --> 01:54:30,790
the way that we're talking about it and
turn it

6036
01:54:30,790 --> 01:54:30,800
turn it
 

6037
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:33,470
turn it
slightly uh so you have all the same

6038
01:54:33,470 --> 01:54:33,480
slightly uh so you have all the same
 

6039
01:54:33,480 --> 01:54:35,390
slightly uh so you have all the same
pieces that everybody sees are there but

6040
01:54:35,390 --> 01:54:35,400
pieces that everybody sees are there but
 

6041
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:36,910
pieces that everybody sees are there but
the description that you've come up with

6042
01:54:36,910 --> 01:54:36,920
the description that you've come up with
 

6043
01:54:36,920 --> 01:54:38,870
the description that you've come up with
seems totally different so they can

6044
01:54:38,870 --> 01:54:38,880
seems totally different so they can
 

6045
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:40,950
seems totally different so they can
understand that there's like they

6046
01:54:40,950 --> 01:54:40,960
understand that there's like they
 

6047
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:42,390
understand that there's like they
understand the pattern you're describing

6048
01:54:42,390 --> 01:54:42,400
understand the pattern you're describing
 

6049
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:43,790
understand the pattern you're describing
but they never heard the structure

6050
01:54:43,790 --> 01:54:43,800
but they never heard the structure
 

6051
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:45,510
but they never heard the structure
underlying it described the way that you

6052
01:54:45,510 --> 01:54:45,520
underlying it described the way that you
 

6053
01:54:45,520 --> 01:54:49,470
underlying it described the way that you
describe it is there words or terms you

6054
01:54:49,470 --> 01:54:49,480
describe it is there words or terms you
 

6055
01:54:49,480 --> 01:54:50,669
describe it is there words or terms you
remember

6056
01:54:50,669 --> 01:54:50,679
remember
 

6057
01:54:50,679 --> 01:54:55,189
remember
that uh Disturbed people the most maybe

6058
01:54:55,189 --> 01:54:55,199
that uh Disturbed people the most maybe
 

6059
01:54:55,199 --> 01:54:58,109
that uh Disturbed people the most maybe
the positive sense of disturbed his

6060
01:54:58,109 --> 01:54:58,119
the positive sense of disturbed his
 

6061
01:54:58,119 --> 01:55:01,069
the positive sense of disturbed his
assembly Theory I suppose is one yeah I

6062
01:55:01,069 --> 01:55:01,079
assembly Theory I suppose is one yeah I
 

6063
01:55:01,079 --> 01:55:03,189
assembly Theory I suppose is one yeah I
mean the the first couple sentences of

6064
01:55:03,189 --> 01:55:03,199
mean the the first couple sentences of
 

6065
01:55:03,199 --> 01:55:05,189
mean the the first couple sentences of
that paper Disturbed people a lot and I

6066
01:55:05,189 --> 01:55:05,199
that paper Disturbed people a lot and I
 

6067
01:55:05,199 --> 01:55:06,350
that paper Disturbed people a lot and I
think they were really carefully

6068
01:55:06,350 --> 01:55:06,360
think they were really carefully
 

6069
01:55:06,360 --> 01:55:08,430
think they were really carefully
constructed in exactly this kind of way

6070
01:55:08,430 --> 01:55:08,440
constructed in exactly this kind of way
 

6071
01:55:08,440 --> 01:55:09,950
constructed in exactly this kind of way
what was that let me look it up oh it

6072
01:55:09,950 --> 01:55:09,960
what was that let me look it up oh it
 

6073
01:55:09,960 --> 01:55:13,790
what was that let me look it up oh it
was really fun um but I think uh it's

6074
01:55:13,790 --> 01:55:13,800
was really fun um but I think uh it's
 

6075
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:17,629
was really fun um but I think uh it's
interesting cuz I do uh you know

6076
01:55:17,629 --> 01:55:17,639
interesting cuz I do uh you know
 

6077
01:55:17,639 --> 01:55:19,109
interesting cuz I do uh you know
sometimes I'm very upfront about it I

6078
01:55:19,109 --> 01:55:19,119
sometimes I'm very upfront about it I
 

6079
01:55:19,119 --> 01:55:20,709
sometimes I'm very upfront about it I
say I'm going to use the same word in

6080
01:55:20,709 --> 01:55:20,719
say I'm going to use the same word in
 

6081
01:55:20,719 --> 01:55:22,910
say I'm going to use the same word in
probably six different ways

6082
01:55:22,910 --> 01:55:22,920
probably six different ways
 

6083
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:25,990
probably six different ways
uh in a lecture um and I will you're

6084
01:55:25,990 --> 01:55:26,000
uh in a lecture um and I will you're
 

6085
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,870
uh in a lecture um and I will you're
right scientists have grappled with

6086
01:55:27,870 --> 01:55:27,880
right scientists have grappled with
 

6087
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:29,830
right scientists have grappled with
reconciling biological evolution with

6088
01:55:29,830 --> 01:55:29,840
reconciling biological evolution with
 

6089
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:32,069
reconciling biological evolution with
immutable laws of the universe defined

6090
01:55:32,069 --> 01:55:32,079
immutable laws of the universe defined
 

6091
01:55:32,079 --> 01:55:34,390
immutable laws of the universe defined
by physics these laws underpin life's

6092
01:55:34,390 --> 01:55:34,400
by physics these laws underpin life's
 

6093
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:37,550
by physics these laws underpin life's
origin Evolution and this with Lee when

6094
01:55:37,550 --> 01:55:37,560
origin Evolution and this with Lee when
 

6095
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:40,910
origin Evolution and this with Lee when
he was here too the development of human

6096
01:55:40,910 --> 01:55:40,920
he was here too the development of human
 

6097
01:55:40,920 --> 01:55:43,310
he was here too the development of human
culture well he was I think your love

6098
01:55:43,310 --> 01:55:43,320
culture well he was I think your love
 

6099
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:46,629
culture well he was I think your love
for Words runs deeper than Le yeah for

6100
01:55:46,629 --> 01:55:46,639
for Words runs deeper than Le yeah for
 

6101
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:48,830
for Words runs deeper than Le yeah for
sure um I mean this is part of the the

6102
01:55:48,830 --> 01:55:48,840
sure um I mean this is part of the the
 

6103
01:55:48,840 --> 01:55:51,229
sure um I mean this is part of the the
sort of um brilliant thing about our

6104
01:55:51,229 --> 01:55:51,239
sort of um brilliant thing about our
 

6105
01:55:51,239 --> 01:55:55,109
sort of um brilliant thing about our
collaboration is um uh you know

6106
01:55:55,109 --> 01:55:55,119
collaboration is um uh you know
 

6107
01:55:55,119 --> 01:55:58,189
collaboration is um uh you know
complimentary skill set so I love

6108
01:55:58,189 --> 01:55:58,199
complimentary skill set so I love
 

6109
01:55:58,199 --> 01:55:59,830
complimentary skill set so I love
playing with the abstract space of

6110
01:55:59,830 --> 01:55:59,840
playing with the abstract space of
 

6111
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:03,709
playing with the abstract space of
language and it's a really interesting

6112
01:56:03,709 --> 01:56:03,719
language and it's a really interesting
 

6113
01:56:03,719 --> 01:56:06,069
language and it's a really interesting
uh playground when I'm working with Lee

6114
01:56:06,069 --> 01:56:06,079
uh playground when I'm working with Lee
 

6115
01:56:06,079 --> 01:56:09,270
uh playground when I'm working with Lee
because uh he thinks that a much deeper

6116
01:56:09,270 --> 01:56:09,280
because uh he thinks that a much deeper
 

6117
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:10,629
because uh he thinks that a much deeper
level of abstraction than can be

6118
01:56:10,629 --> 01:56:10,639
level of abstraction than can be
 

6119
01:56:10,639 --> 01:56:13,270
level of abstraction than can be
expressed by language and the ideas we

6120
01:56:13,270 --> 01:56:13,280
expressed by language and the ideas we
 

6121
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:15,830
expressed by language and the ideas we
work on are hard to talk about for that

6122
01:56:15,830 --> 01:56:15,840
work on are hard to talk about for that
 

6123
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:17,550
work on are hard to talk about for that
reason what do you think about

6124
01:56:17,550 --> 01:56:17,560
reason what do you think about
 

6125
01:56:17,560 --> 01:56:19,709
reason what do you think about
computation as a language I think it's a

6126
01:56:19,709 --> 01:56:19,719
computation as a language I think it's a
 

6127
01:56:19,719 --> 01:56:21,270
computation as a language I think it's a
very poor language a lot of people think

6128
01:56:21,270 --> 01:56:21,280
very poor language a lot of people think
 

6129
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:22,950
very poor language a lot of people think
it's a really great one but I I think it

6130
01:56:22,950 --> 01:56:22,960
it's a really great one but I I think it
 

6131
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:25,669
it's a really great one but I I think it
has some nice properties um but I I

6132
01:56:25,669 --> 01:56:25,679
has some nice properties um but I I
 

6133
01:56:25,679 --> 01:56:27,790
has some nice properties um but I I
think the the feature of it that you

6134
01:56:27,790 --> 01:56:27,800
think the the feature of it that you
 

6135
01:56:27,800 --> 01:56:29,629
think the the feature of it that you
know is is compelling is this kind of

6136
01:56:29,629 --> 01:56:29,639
know is is compelling is this kind of
 

6137
01:56:29,639 --> 01:56:32,790
know is is compelling is this kind of
idea of universality that like you can

6138
01:56:32,790 --> 01:56:32,800
idea of universality that like you can
 

6139
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:34,950
idea of universality that like you can
if you if you if you have a language you

6140
01:56:34,950 --> 01:56:34,960
if you if you if you have a language you
 

6141
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:36,709
if you if you if you have a language you
can describe things in any other

6142
01:56:36,709 --> 01:56:36,719
can describe things in any other
 

6143
01:56:36,719 --> 01:56:38,830
can describe things in any other
language well for me one of the people

6144
01:56:38,830 --> 01:56:38,840
language well for me one of the people
 

6145
01:56:38,840 --> 01:56:40,830
language well for me one of the people
who kind of

6146
01:56:40,830 --> 01:56:40,840
who kind of
 

6147
01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:43,030
who kind of
revealed the expressive power of

6148
01:56:43,030 --> 01:56:43,040
revealed the expressive power of
 

6149
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:45,149
revealed the expressive power of
computation aside from alen touring is

6150
01:56:45,149 --> 01:56:45,159
computation aside from alen touring is

Steven Wolfram through all the
 

6153
01:56:46,639 --> 01:56:48,950
Steven Wolfram through all the
explorations of like cell aoma type of

6154
01:56:48,950 --> 01:56:48,960
explorations of like cell aoma type of
 

6155
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:51,629
explorations of like cell aoma type of
objects that uh he did in a new kind of

01:56:53,990 --> 01:56:54,000
Science and after afterwards so what
 

6159
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:57,030
Science and after afterwards so what
what do you get from that like

6160
01:56:57,030 --> 01:56:57,040
what do you get from that like
 

6161
01:56:57,040 --> 01:57:00,629
what do you get from that like
the the kind of computational Worlds

6162
01:57:00,629 --> 01:57:00,639
the the kind of computational Worlds
 

6163
01:57:00,639 --> 01:57:02,229
the the kind of computational Worlds
that are revealed through even something

6164
01:57:02,229 --> 01:57:02,239
that are revealed through even something
 

6165
01:57:02,239 --> 01:57:05,270
that are revealed through even something
as simple cellular aoma like it seems

6166
01:57:05,270 --> 01:57:05,280
as simple cellular aoma like it seems
 

6167
01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:07,510
as simple cellular aoma like it seems
like that's a really nice way to explore

6168
01:57:07,510 --> 01:57:07,520
like that's a really nice way to explore
 

6169
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:12,109
like that's a really nice way to explore
languages that are far outside our human

6170
01:57:12,109 --> 01:57:12,119
languages that are far outside our human
 

6171
01:57:12,119 --> 01:57:17,069
languages that are far outside our human
languages and do so rigorously and

6172
01:57:17,069 --> 01:57:17,079
languages and do so rigorously and
 

6173
01:57:17,079 --> 01:57:19,830
languages and do so rigorously and
understand how those kinds of complex

emerge all that kind of stuff um I don't

6178
01:57:26,189 --> 01:57:26,199
emerge all that kind of stuff um I don't
 

6179
01:57:26,199 --> 01:57:27,790
emerge all that kind of stuff um I don't
think that they're outside our human

6180
01:57:27,790 --> 01:57:27,800
think that they're outside our human
 

6181
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:29,270
think that they're outside our human
languages I think they Define the

6182
01:57:29,270 --> 01:57:29,280
languages I think they Define the
 

6183
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:32,430
languages I think they Define the
boundary of the space of human languages

6184
01:57:32,430 --> 01:57:32,440
boundary of the space of human languages
 

6185
01:57:32,440 --> 01:57:34,189
boundary of the space of human languages
they allow us to explore things within

6186
01:57:34,189 --> 01:57:34,199
they allow us to explore things within
 

6187
01:57:34,199 --> 01:57:36,350
they allow us to explore things within
that space which is also fantastic but I

6188
01:57:36,350 --> 01:57:36,360
that space which is also fantastic but I
 

6189
01:57:36,360 --> 01:57:38,589
that space which is also fantastic but I
think there is a set of ideas that takes

6190
01:57:38,589 --> 01:57:38,599
think there is a set of ideas that takes

01:57:38,599 --> 01:57:41,030
think there is a set of ideas that takes
and and Steven Wolfram has worked on

6192
01:57:41,030 --> 01:57:41,040
and and Steven Wolfram has worked on
 

6193
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:43,910
and and Steven Wolfram has worked on
this quite a lot um and contributed very

6194
01:57:43,910 --> 01:57:43,920
this quite a lot um and contributed very
 

6195
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:46,629
this quite a lot um and contributed very
significantly to it and um you know I

6196
01:57:46,629 --> 01:57:46,639
significantly to it and um you know I
 

6197
01:57:46,639 --> 01:57:47,750
significantly to it and um you know I
really like some of the stuff that

6198
01:57:47,750 --> 01:57:47,760
really like some of the stuff that
 

6199
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:49,629
really like some of the stuff that
Stephen's doing with like his physics

6200
01:57:49,629 --> 01:57:49,639
Stephen's doing with like his physics
 

6201
01:57:49,639 --> 01:57:51,510
Stephen's doing with like his physics
project but don't agree with a lot of

6202
01:57:51,510 --> 01:57:51,520
project but don't agree with a lot of
 

6203
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:53,550
project but don't agree with a lot of
the foundations of it but I I think the

6204
01:57:53,550 --> 01:57:53,560
the foundations of it but I I think the
 

6205
01:57:53,560 --> 01:57:56,229
the foundations of it but I I think the
Space is really fun that he's exploring

6206
01:57:56,229 --> 01:57:56,239
Space is really fun that he's exploring
 

6207
01:57:56,239 --> 01:57:58,510
Space is really fun that he's exploring
um you know there's this assumption that

6208
01:57:58,510 --> 01:57:58,520
um you know there's this assumption that
 

6209
01:57:58,520 --> 01:58:01,229
um you know there's this assumption that
computation is at the base of reality

6210
01:58:01,229 --> 01:58:01,239
computation is at the base of reality
 

6211
01:58:01,239 --> 01:58:03,550
computation is at the base of reality
and I kind of see it at the top of

6212
01:58:03,550 --> 01:58:03,560
and I kind of see it at the top of
 

6213
01:58:03,560 --> 01:58:06,350
and I kind of see it at the top of
reality um not at the base um because I

6214
01:58:06,350 --> 01:58:06,360
reality um not at the base um because I
 

6215
01:58:06,360 --> 01:58:08,149
reality um not at the base um because I
think computation was built by our

6216
01:58:08,149 --> 01:58:08,159
think computation was built by our
 

6217
01:58:08,159 --> 01:58:09,790
think computation was built by our
biosphere it's a it's something that

6218
01:58:09,790 --> 01:58:09,800
biosphere it's a it's something that
 

6219
01:58:09,800 --> 01:58:11,910
biosphere it's a it's something that
happened after many billion years of

6220
01:58:11,910 --> 01:58:11,920
happened after many billion years of
 

6221
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:14,790
happened after many billion years of
evolution um and it doesn't happen in

6222
01:58:14,790 --> 01:58:14,800
evolution um and it doesn't happen in
 

6223
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:17,629
evolution um and it doesn't happen in
every physical object it only happens in

6224
01:58:17,629 --> 01:58:17,639
every physical object it only happens in
 

6225
01:58:17,639 --> 01:58:19,470
every physical object it only happens in
some of them and I think one of the

6226
01:58:19,470 --> 01:58:19,480
some of them and I think one of the
 

6227
01:58:19,480 --> 01:58:22,990
some of them and I think one of the
reasons that we feel like the universe

6228
01:58:22,990 --> 01:58:23,000
reasons that we feel like the universe
 

6229
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,830
reasons that we feel like the universe
is computational is because it's so easy

6230
01:58:25,830 --> 01:58:25,840
is computational is because it's so easy
 

6231
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:30,390
is computational is because it's so easy
for us as things that have the theory of

6232
01:58:30,390 --> 01:58:30,400
for us as things that have the theory of
 

6233
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:33,470
for us as things that have the theory of
computation um in our minds and actually

6234
01:58:33,470 --> 01:58:33,480
computation um in our minds and actually
 

6235
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:35,510
computation um in our minds and actually
in some sense it it might be related to

6236
01:58:35,510 --> 01:58:35,520
in some sense it it might be related to
 

6237
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:37,350
in some sense it it might be related to
the functioning of our minds and how we

6238
01:58:37,350 --> 01:58:37,360
the functioning of our minds and how we
 

6239
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:39,870
the functioning of our minds and how we
build uh languages to describe the world

01:58:39,880 --> 01:58:41,550
build uh languages to describe the world
and sets of relations to describe the

but it's easy for us to go out into the
 

6247
01:58:47,159 --> 01:58:50,229
but it's easy for us to go out into the
world and build computers and then we

6248
01:58:50,229 --> 01:58:50,239
world and build computers and then we
 

6249
01:58:50,239 --> 01:58:52,629
world and build computers and then we
mistake our ability to do that with

6250
01:58:52,629 --> 01:58:52,639
mistake our ability to do that with
 

6251
01:58:52,639 --> 01:58:55,189
mistake our ability to do that with
assuming that the world is computational

one time had a conversation with him um

6258
01:59:02,430 --> 01:59:02,440
one time had a conversation with him um
 

6259
01:59:02,440 --> 01:59:03,669
one time had a conversation with him um
which was really delightful he was

6260
01:59:03,669 --> 01:59:03,679
which was really delightful he was
 

6261
01:59:03,679 --> 01:59:06,669
which was really delightful he was
really fun um but he was pointing out

6262
01:59:06,669 --> 01:59:06,679
really fun um but he was pointing out
 

6263
01:59:06,679 --> 01:59:09,830
really fun um but he was pointing out
that if you um you know string lights in

01:59:09,830 --> 01:59:09,840
that if you um you know string lights in
 

6265
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:12,790
that if you um you know string lights in

01:59:17,270 --> 01:59:17,280
one-dimensional CA uh and you might even
 

6271
01:59:17,280 --> 01:59:19,270

6279
01:59:28,280 --> 01:59:29,790

not it's a feature of the fact that you
 

6281
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:32,550
not it's a feature of the fact that you
as a programmer had a theory that you

01:59:32,550 --> 01:59:32,560
as a programmer had a theory that you

01:59:38,589 --> 01:59:38,599
though is we get confused by this kind
 

6289
01:59:38,599 --> 01:59:40,589

anytime that you want to do that you

6312
02:00:03,109 --> 02:00:03,119
anytime that you want to do that you
 

6313
02:00:03,119 --> 02:00:05,030
anytime that you want to do that you
always have to prepare an initial State

6314
02:00:05,030 --> 02:00:05,040
always have to prepare an initial State
 

6315
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:06,910
always have to prepare an initial State
you have to uh you know you have to

02:00:06,910 --> 02:00:06,920
you have to uh you know you have to
 

6317
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:08,870
you have to uh you know you have to
constrain the rule space and then you

6318
02:00:08,870 --> 02:00:08,880
constrain the rule space and then you
 

6319
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:10,830
constrain the rule space and then you
have to actually be able to demonstrate

6320
02:00:10,830 --> 02:00:10,840
have to actually be able to demonstrate
 

6321
02:00:10,840 --> 02:00:13,229
have to actually be able to demonstrate
the properties of computation and all of

the properties of computation and all of
 

6323
02:00:13,239 --> 02:00:15,109
the properties of computation and all of
that requires an agent or a designer to

6324
02:00:15,109 --> 02:00:15,119
that requires an agent or a designer to
 

6325
02:00:15,119 --> 02:00:18,550
that requires an agent or a designer to
be able to do that but it gives you an

6326
02:00:18,550 --> 02:00:18,560
be able to do that but it gives you an
 

6327
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:21,069
be able to do that but it gives you an
intuition if you look at a 1D or 2D

cellular autometer
it gives you uh it allows you to build

it gives you uh it allows you to build
 

6333
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:27,310
it gives you uh it allows you to build
an intuition of how you can have

02:00:27,310 --> 02:00:27,320
an intuition of how you can have

complexity emerge from very simple

6336
02:00:29,229 --> 02:00:29,239

6337
02:00:29,239 --> 02:00:31,709
complexity emerge from very simple
Beginnings very simple condition I think

6338
02:00:31,709 --> 02:00:31,719
Beginnings very simple condition I think
 

6339
02:00:31,719 --> 02:00:33,430
Beginnings very simple condition I think
that's the intuition that people have

6340
02:00:33,430 --> 02:00:33,440
that's the intuition that people have
 

6341
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:36,270
that's the intuition that people have
derived from it the intuition I get from

6342
02:00:36,270 --> 02:00:36,280
derived from it the intuition I get from
 

6343
02:00:36,280 --> 02:00:39,310
derived from it the intuition I get from
cellular aoma is that the flat space of

6344
02:00:39,310 --> 02:00:39,320
cellular aoma is that the flat space of
 

6345
02:00:39,320 --> 02:00:40,629
cellular aoma is that the flat space of
an initial condition in a fixed

6346
02:00:40,629 --> 02:00:40,639
an initial condition in a fixed
 

6347
02:00:40,639 --> 02:00:42,470
an initial condition in a fixed
dynamical law is not rich enough to

6348
02:00:42,470 --> 02:00:42,480
dynamical law is not rich enough to
 

6349
02:00:42,480 --> 02:00:44,550
dynamical law is not rich enough to
describe an open-ended generation

6350
02:00:44,550 --> 02:00:44,560
describe an open-ended generation
 

6351
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:46,310
describe an open-ended generation
process and so the way I see cellular

6352
02:00:46,310 --> 02:00:46,320
process and so the way I see cellular
 

6353
02:00:46,320 --> 02:00:48,669
process and so the way I see cellular
aoma is they're embedded slices in a

6354
02:00:48,669 --> 02:00:48,679
aoma is they're embedded slices in a
 

6355
02:00:48,679 --> 02:00:50,229
aoma is they're embedded slices in a
much larger causal structure and if you

6356
02:00:50,229 --> 02:00:50,239
much larger causal structure and if you
 

6357
02:00:50,239 --> 02:00:52,109
much larger causal structure and if you
want to look at a deterministic slice of

6358
02:00:52,109 --> 02:00:52,119
want to look at a deterministic slice of
 

6359
02:00:52,119 --> 02:00:53,350
want to look at a deterministic slice of
that causal structure you might be able

6360
02:00:53,350 --> 02:00:53,360
that causal structure you might be able
 

6361
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:55,669
that causal structure you might be able
to extract a set of consistent rules

6362
02:00:55,669 --> 02:00:55,679
to extract a set of consistent rules
 

6363
02:00:55,679 --> 02:00:57,350
to extract a set of consistent rules
that you might call a cellular automa

6364
02:00:57,350 --> 02:00:57,360
that you might call a cellular automa
 

6365
02:00:57,360 --> 02:00:58,629
that you might call a cellular automa
but you could embed them in this much

6366
02:00:58,629 --> 02:00:58,639
but you could embed them in this much
 

6367
02:00:58,639 --> 02:01:01,910
but you could embed them in this much
larger space that's not dynamical and is

6368
02:01:01,910 --> 02:01:01,920
larger space that's not dynamical and is
 

6369
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:03,629
larger space that's not dynamical and is
about the causal structure and relations

6370
02:01:03,629 --> 02:01:03,639
about the causal structure and relations
 

6371
02:01:03,639 --> 02:01:05,629
about the causal structure and relations
between all of those computations and

6372
02:01:05,629 --> 02:01:05,639
between all of those computations and
 

6373
02:01:05,639 --> 02:01:08,149
between all of those computations and
that would be the space uh Cell tomama

6374
02:01:08,149 --> 02:01:08,159
that would be the space uh Cell tomama
 

6375
02:01:08,159 --> 02:01:09,790
that would be the space uh Cell tomama
live in and I think that's the space

6376
02:01:09,790 --> 02:01:09,800
live in and I think that's the space
 

6377
02:01:09,800 --> 02:01:12,149
live in and I think that's the space
that uh Stephen is talking about when he

6378
02:01:12,149 --> 02:01:12,159
that uh Stephen is talking about when he
 

6379
02:01:12,159 --> 02:01:13,589
that uh Stephen is talking about when he
talks about his ruad and these

6380
02:01:13,589 --> 02:01:13,599
talks about his ruad and these
 

6381
02:01:13,599 --> 02:01:15,750
talks about his ruad and these
hypergraphs of all these possible

6382
02:01:15,750 --> 02:01:15,760
hypergraphs of all these possible
 

6383
02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:17,910
hypergraphs of all these possible
computations but I wouldn't take that as

6384
02:01:17,910 --> 02:01:17,920
computations but I wouldn't take that as
 

6385
02:01:17,920 --> 02:01:19,870
computations but I wouldn't take that as
my base reality because I think again

6386
02:01:19,870 --> 02:01:19,880
my base reality because I think again
 

6387
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:21,910
my base reality because I think again
computation itself this abstract

6388
02:01:21,910 --> 02:01:21,920
computation itself this abstract
 

6389
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:24,189
computation itself this abstract
property computation is not at the base

6390
02:01:24,189 --> 02:01:24,199
property computation is not at the base
 

6391
02:01:24,199 --> 02:01:26,950
property computation is not at the base
of reality so can we just uh Ling on

6392
02:01:26,950 --> 02:01:26,960
of reality so can we just uh Ling on
 

6393
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:31,069
of reality so can we just uh Ling on
that ruad this uh one ruad to rule them

6394
02:01:31,069 --> 02:01:31,079
that ruad this uh one ruad to rule them
 

6395
02:01:31,079 --> 02:01:34,709
that ruad this uh one ruad to rule them
all yeah so what this is part of uh wol

6396
02:01:34,709 --> 02:01:34,719
all yeah so what this is part of uh wol
 

6397
02:01:34,719 --> 02:01:37,910
all yeah so what this is part of uh wol
from physics project it's what he calls

6398
02:01:37,910 --> 02:01:37,920
from physics project it's what he calls
 

6399
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:39,830
from physics project it's what he calls
the entangled limit of everything that

6400
02:01:39,830 --> 02:01:39,840
the entangled limit of everything that
 

6401
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:43,589
the entangled limit of everything that
is computationally possible so what

6402
02:01:43,589 --> 02:01:43,599
is computationally possible so what
 

6403
02:01:43,599 --> 02:01:46,069
is computationally possible so what
what's your problem with the rad well

6404
02:01:46,069 --> 02:01:46,079
what's your problem with the rad well
 

6405
02:01:46,079 --> 02:01:48,830
what's your problem with the rad well
it's interesting so so Stephen came to a

6406
02:01:48,830 --> 02:01:48,840
it's interesting so so Stephen came to a
 

6407
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:50,430
it's interesting so so Stephen came to a
workshop we had in the Beyond Center in

6408
02:01:50,430 --> 02:01:50,440
workshop we had in the Beyond Center in
 

6409
02:01:50,440 --> 02:01:52,910
workshop we had in the Beyond Center in
the fall and the workshop theme was

6410
02:01:52,910 --> 02:01:52,920
the fall and the workshop theme was
 

6411
02:01:52,920 --> 02:01:55,030
the fall and the workshop theme was
mathematics is it evolved or Eternal and

6412
02:01:55,030 --> 02:01:55,040
mathematics is it evolved or Eternal and
 

6413
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:57,350
mathematics is it evolved or Eternal and
he gave a talk about the ruad and he was

6414
02:01:57,350 --> 02:01:57,360
he gave a talk about the ruad and he was
 

6415
02:01:57,360 --> 02:02:00,030
he gave a talk about the ruad and he was
talking about how uh you know a lot of

6416
02:02:00,030 --> 02:02:00,040
talking about how uh you know a lot of
 

6417
02:02:00,040 --> 02:02:00,910
talking about how uh you know a lot of
the things that we talk about in the

6418
02:02:00,910 --> 02:02:00,920
the things that we talk about in the
 

6419
02:02:00,920 --> 02:02:03,229
the things that we talk about in the
Beyond Center like does reality have a

6420
02:02:03,229 --> 02:02:03,239
Beyond Center like does reality have a
 

6421
02:02:03,239 --> 02:02:05,149
Beyond Center like does reality have a
bottom you know if it has a bottom what

6422
02:02:05,149 --> 02:02:05,159
bottom you know if it has a bottom what
 

6423
02:02:05,159 --> 02:02:08,709
bottom you know if it has a bottom what
is it um you know like I need to I need

6424
02:02:08,709 --> 02:02:08,719
is it um you know like I need to I need
 

6425
02:02:08,719 --> 02:02:11,510
is it um you know like I need to I need
to go we'll have you to one sometime

6426
02:02:11,510 --> 02:02:11,520
to go we'll have you to one sometime
 

6427
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:14,149
to go we'll have you to one sometime
this is great um but this reality have a

6428
02:02:14,149 --> 02:02:14,159
this is great um but this reality have a
 

6429
02:02:14,159 --> 02:02:16,629
this is great um but this reality have a
bottom yeah so we had one that was um it

6430
02:02:16,629 --> 02:02:16,639
bottom yeah so we had one that was um it
 

6431
02:02:16,639 --> 02:02:19,270
bottom yeah so we had one that was um it
was called um infinite turtles or ground

6432
02:02:19,270 --> 02:02:19,280
was called um infinite turtles or ground
 

6433
02:02:19,280 --> 02:02:21,550
was called um infinite turtles or ground
truth and it was really just about this

6434
02:02:21,550 --> 02:02:21,560
truth and it was really just about this
 

6435
02:02:21,560 --> 02:02:23,709
truth and it was really just about this
this this issue but the but the thing

6436
02:02:23,709 --> 02:02:23,719
this this issue but the but the thing
 

6437
02:02:23,719 --> 02:02:25,270
this this issue but the but the thing
that was interesting I think I think

6438
02:02:25,270 --> 02:02:25,280
that was interesting I think I think
 

6439
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:27,510
that was interesting I think I think
Stephen was trying to make the argument

6440
02:02:27,510 --> 02:02:27,520
Stephen was trying to make the argument
 

6441
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:28,870
Stephen was trying to make the argument
that you know fundamental particles

6442
02:02:28,870 --> 02:02:28,880
that you know fundamental particles
 

6443
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:31,310
that you know fundamental particles
aren't fundamental gravitation is not

6444
02:02:31,310 --> 02:02:31,320
aren't fundamental gravitation is not
 

6445
02:02:31,320 --> 02:02:34,069
aren't fundamental gravitation is not
fundamental uh you know these are just

6446
02:02:34,069 --> 02:02:34,079
fundamental uh you know these are just
 

6447
02:02:34,079 --> 02:02:36,709
fundamental uh you know these are just
uh turtles and computation is

6448
02:02:36,709 --> 02:02:36,719
uh turtles and computation is
 

6449
02:02:36,719 --> 02:02:38,750
uh turtles and computation is
fundamental and I just I I remember

6450
02:02:38,750 --> 02:02:38,760
fundamental and I just I I remember
 

6451
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:40,030
fundamental and I just I I remember
pointing out to him I was like well

6452
02:02:40,030 --> 02:02:40,040
pointing out to him I was like well
 

6453
02:02:40,040 --> 02:02:43,229
pointing out to him I was like well
computation is your turtle and I think

6454
02:02:43,229 --> 02:02:43,239
computation is your turtle and I think
 

6455
02:02:43,239 --> 02:02:45,990
computation is your turtle and I think
it's a weird Turtle to have first of all

6456
02:02:45,990 --> 02:02:46,000
it's a weird Turtle to have first of all
 

6457
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:47,589
it's a weird Turtle to have first of all
isn't it okay to have a turtle it's

6458
02:02:47,589 --> 02:02:47,599
isn't it okay to have a turtle it's
 

6459
02:02:47,599 --> 02:02:49,430
isn't it okay to have a turtle it's
totally fine to have a turtle everyone

6460
02:02:49,430 --> 02:02:49,440
totally fine to have a turtle everyone
 

6461
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:51,390
totally fine to have a turtle everyone
has a turtle you can't build a theory

6462
02:02:51,390 --> 02:02:51,400
has a turtle you can't build a theory
 

6463
02:02:51,400 --> 02:02:52,790
has a turtle you can't build a theory
without a turtle

6464
02:02:52,790 --> 02:02:52,800
without a turtle
 

6465
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:54,709
without a turtle
um it's just um so it depends on the

6466
02:02:54,709 --> 02:02:54,719
um it's just um so it depends on the
 

6467
02:02:54,719 --> 02:02:56,310
um it's just um so it depends on the
problem you want to describe and I

6468
02:02:56,310 --> 02:02:56,320
problem you want to describe and I
 

6469
02:02:56,320 --> 02:02:58,270
problem you want to describe and I
actually the the reason I can't get

6470
02:02:58,270 --> 02:02:58,280
actually the the reason I can't get
 

6471
02:02:58,280 --> 02:03:01,669
actually the the reason I can't get
behind Steven's ontology is I don't know

6472
02:03:01,669 --> 02:03:01,679
behind Steven's ontology is I don't know
 

6473
02:03:01,679 --> 02:03:03,910
behind Steven's ontology is I don't know
what question he's trying to answer and

6474
02:03:03,910 --> 02:03:03,920
what question he's trying to answer and
 

6475
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:05,629
what question he's trying to answer and
without a question to answer I don't

6476
02:03:05,629 --> 02:03:05,639
without a question to answer I don't
 

6477
02:03:05,639 --> 02:03:06,629
without a question to answer I don't
understand why you're building a theory

6478
02:03:06,629 --> 02:03:06,639
understand why you're building a theory
 

6479
02:03:06,639 --> 02:03:08,229
understand why you're building a theory
of reality and the question you're

6480
02:03:08,229 --> 02:03:08,239
of reality and the question you're
 

6481
02:03:08,239 --> 02:03:11,750
of reality and the question you're
trying to answer is uh what life is what

6482
02:03:11,750 --> 02:03:11,760
trying to answer is uh what life is what
 

6483
02:03:11,760 --> 02:03:14,990
trying to answer is uh what life is what
life is which another simpler way of

6484
02:03:14,990 --> 02:03:15,000
life is which another simpler way of
 

6485
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,510
life is which another simpler way of
phrasing that is how did life originate

6486
02:03:17,510 --> 02:03:17,520
phrasing that is how did life originate
 

6487
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:19,069
phrasing that is how did life originate
well I started working on the original

6488
02:03:19,069 --> 02:03:19,079
well I started working on the original
 

6489
02:03:19,079 --> 02:03:22,229
well I started working on the original
life um and I think what my challenge

6490
02:03:22,229 --> 02:03:22,239
life um and I think what my challenge
 

6491
02:03:22,239 --> 02:03:24,430
life um and I think what my challenge
was there was no one knew what life was

6492
02:03:24,430 --> 02:03:24,440
was there was no one knew what life was
 

6493
02:03:24,440 --> 02:03:25,709
was there was no one knew what life was
and so you can't really talk about the

6494
02:03:25,709 --> 02:03:25,719
and so you can't really talk about the
 

6495
02:03:25,719 --> 02:03:27,069
and so you can't really talk about the
origination of something if you don't

6496
02:03:27,069 --> 02:03:27,079
origination of something if you don't
 

6497
02:03:27,079 --> 02:03:30,189
origination of something if you don't
know what it is and so the way I would

6498
02:03:30,189 --> 02:03:30,199
know what it is and so the way I would
 

6499
02:03:30,199 --> 02:03:32,550
know what it is and so the way I would
approach it is if you want to understand

6500
02:03:32,550 --> 02:03:32,560
approach it is if you want to understand
 

6501
02:03:32,560 --> 02:03:35,830
approach it is if you want to understand
what life is then proving that physics

6502
02:03:35,830 --> 02:03:35,840
what life is then proving that physics
 

6503
02:03:35,840 --> 02:03:38,709
what life is then proving that physics
is solving the original life so there's

6504
02:03:38,709 --> 02:03:38,719
is solving the original life so there's
 

6505
02:03:38,719 --> 02:03:40,589
is solving the original life so there's
the theory of what life is but there's

6506
02:03:40,589 --> 02:03:40,599
the theory of what life is but there's
 

6507
02:03:40,599 --> 02:03:42,189
the theory of what life is but there's
the actual demonstration that that

6508
02:03:42,189 --> 02:03:42,199
the actual demonstration that that
 

6509
02:03:42,199 --> 02:03:43,990
the actual demonstration that that
theory is an accurate description of the

6510
02:03:43,990 --> 02:03:44,000
theory is an accurate description of the
 

6511
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,149
theory is an accurate description of the
phenomena you aim to describe so again

6512
02:03:46,149 --> 02:03:46,159
phenomena you aim to describe so again
 

6513
02:03:46,159 --> 02:03:48,189
phenomena you aim to describe so again
they're the same problem it's not like I

6514
02:03:48,189 --> 02:03:48,199
they're the same problem it's not like I
 

6515
02:03:48,199 --> 02:03:49,870
they're the same problem it's not like I
can decouple original life from what

6516
02:03:49,870 --> 02:03:49,880
can decouple original life from what
 

6517
02:03:49,880 --> 02:03:51,950
can decouple original life from what
life is it's it's like that is the

6518
02:03:51,950 --> 02:03:51,960
life is it's it's like that is the
 

6519
02:03:51,960 --> 02:03:55,390
life is it's it's like that is the
problem um and I the the point I guess

6520
02:03:55,390 --> 02:03:55,400
problem um and I the the point I guess
 

6521
02:03:55,400 --> 02:03:58,950
problem um and I the the point I guess
I'm making about having a question is no

6522
02:03:58,950 --> 02:03:58,960
I'm making about having a question is no
 

6523
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:00,830
I'm making about having a question is no
matter what slice of reality you take

6524
02:04:00,830 --> 02:04:00,840
matter what slice of reality you take
 

6525
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:02,430
matter what slice of reality you take
what regularity of nature you're going

6526
02:04:02,430 --> 02:04:02,440
what regularity of nature you're going
 

6527
02:04:02,440 --> 02:04:05,470
what regularity of nature you're going
to try to describe there will be there

6528
02:04:05,470 --> 02:04:05,480
to try to describe there will be there
 

6529
02:04:05,480 --> 02:04:06,990
to try to describe there will be there
there will be an abstraction that

6530
02:04:06,990 --> 02:04:07,000
there will be an abstraction that
 

6531
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,870
there will be an abstraction that
unifies that structure of reality um

6532
02:04:09,870 --> 02:04:09,880
unifies that structure of reality um
 

6533
02:04:09,880 --> 02:04:14,430
unifies that structure of reality um
hopefully um and and that will have a

6534
02:04:14,430 --> 02:04:14,440
hopefully um and and that will have a
 

6535
02:04:14,440 --> 02:04:16,430
hopefully um and and that will have a
fundamental layer to it right because

6536
02:04:16,430 --> 02:04:16,440
fundamental layer to it right because
 

6537
02:04:16,440 --> 02:04:19,030
fundamental layer to it right because
you have to explain something in terms

6538
02:04:19,030 --> 02:04:19,040
you have to explain something in terms
 

6539
02:04:19,040 --> 02:04:21,430
you have to explain something in terms
of something else but so if I want to

6540
02:04:21,430 --> 02:04:21,440
of something else but so if I want to
 

6541
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:23,390
of something else but so if I want to
EXP explain life for example then my

6542
02:04:23,390 --> 02:04:23,400
EXP explain life for example then my
 

6543
02:04:23,400 --> 02:04:25,189
EXP explain life for example then my
fundamental description of Nature has to

6544
02:04:25,189 --> 02:04:25,199
fundamental description of Nature has to
 

6545
02:04:25,199 --> 02:04:26,990
fundamental description of Nature has to
be something I think that has to do with

6546
02:04:26,990 --> 02:04:27,000
be something I think that has to do with
 

6547
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,430
be something I think that has to do with
time being fundamental but if I wanted

6548
02:04:29,430 --> 02:04:29,440
time being fundamental but if I wanted
 

6549
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:30,510
time being fundamental but if I wanted
to

6550
02:04:30,510 --> 02:04:30,520
to
 

6551
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:33,870
to
describe um I don't know the sort of

6552
02:04:33,870 --> 02:04:33,880
describe um I don't know the sort of
 

6553
02:04:33,880 --> 02:04:37,470
describe um I don't know the sort of
interactions of uh matter and light you

6554
02:04:37,470 --> 02:04:37,480
interactions of uh matter and light you
 

6555
02:04:37,480 --> 02:04:39,149
interactions of uh matter and light you
know I have Elementary particles be

6556
02:04:39,149 --> 02:04:39,159
know I have Elementary particles be
 

6557
02:04:39,159 --> 02:04:41,350
know I have Elementary particles be
fundamental um if I want to describe

6558
02:04:41,350 --> 02:04:41,360
fundamental um if I want to describe
 

6559
02:04:41,360 --> 02:04:43,750
fundamental um if I want to describe
electricity and magnetism in the 1800s I

6560
02:04:43,750 --> 02:04:43,760
electricity and magnetism in the 1800s I
 

6561
02:04:43,760 --> 02:04:47,069
electricity and magnetism in the 1800s I
have to have waves um be fundamental

6562
02:04:47,069 --> 02:04:47,079
have to have waves um be fundamental
 

6563
02:04:47,079 --> 02:04:49,549
have to have waves um be fundamental
right so like you you or in quantum

6564
02:04:49,549 --> 02:04:49,559
right so like you you or in quantum
 

6565
02:04:49,559 --> 02:04:51,270
right so like you you or in quantum
mechanics like it's a wave function

6566
02:04:51,270 --> 02:04:51,280
mechanics like it's a wave function
 

6567
02:04:51,280 --> 02:04:53,030
mechanics like it's a wave function
that's fundamental cuz that's the the

6568
02:04:53,030 --> 02:04:53,040
that's fundamental cuz that's the the
 

6569
02:04:53,040 --> 02:04:55,510
that's fundamental cuz that's the the
sort of explanatory Paradigm of your

6570
02:04:55,510 --> 02:04:55,520
sort of explanatory Paradigm of your
 

6571
02:04:55,520 --> 02:04:57,109
sort of explanatory Paradigm of your
theory

6572
02:04:57,109 --> 02:04:57,119
theory
 

6573
02:04:57,119 --> 02:05:02,990
theory
um so I guess I don't know what problem

6574
02:05:02,990 --> 02:05:03,000
um so I guess I don't know what problem
 

6575
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:06,109
um so I guess I don't know what problem
saying computation is fundamental

6576
02:05:06,109 --> 02:05:06,119
saying computation is fundamental
 

6577
02:05:06,119 --> 02:05:09,870
saying computation is fundamental
solves doesn't he want to understand how

6578
02:05:09,870 --> 02:05:09,880
solves doesn't he want to understand how
 

6579
02:05:09,880 --> 02:05:12,229
solves doesn't he want to understand how
does the basic quantum mechanics and

6580
02:05:12,229 --> 02:05:12,239
does the basic quantum mechanics and
 

6581
02:05:12,239 --> 02:05:13,790
does the basic quantum mechanics and
general relativity

6582
02:05:13,790 --> 02:05:13,800
general relativity
 

6583
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:16,629
general relativity
emerge yeah but and howest time right so

6584
02:05:16,629 --> 02:05:16,639
emerge yeah but and howest time right so
 

6585
02:05:16,639 --> 02:05:17,990
emerge yeah but and howest time right so
I think then that doesn't really answer

6586
02:05:17,990 --> 02:05:18,000
I think then that doesn't really answer
 

6587
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:19,510
I think then that doesn't really answer
an important question for us well I

6588
02:05:19,510 --> 02:05:19,520
an important question for us well I
 

6589
02:05:19,520 --> 02:05:21,910
an important question for us well I
think the the issue is general

6590
02:05:21,910 --> 02:05:21,920
think the the issue is general
 

6591
02:05:21,920 --> 02:05:23,470
think the the issue is general
relativity and quantum mechanics are

6592
02:05:23,470 --> 02:05:23,480
relativity and quantum mechanics are
 

6593
02:05:23,480 --> 02:05:25,030
relativity and quantum mechanics are
expressed in mathematical

6594
02:05:25,030 --> 02:05:25,040
expressed in mathematical
 

6595
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:27,750
expressed in mathematical
languages and then computation is a

6596
02:05:27,750 --> 02:05:27,760
languages and then computation is a
 

6597
02:05:27,760 --> 02:05:29,430
languages and then computation is a
mathematical language so you're

6598
02:05:29,430 --> 02:05:29,440
mathematical language so you're
 

6599
02:05:29,440 --> 02:05:31,069
mathematical language so you're
basically saying that maybe there's a

6600
02:05:31,069 --> 02:05:31,079
basically saying that maybe there's a
 

6601
02:05:31,079 --> 02:05:32,990
basically saying that maybe there's a
more Universal mathematical language for

6602
02:05:32,990 --> 02:05:33,000
more Universal mathematical language for
 

6603
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:34,390
more Universal mathematical language for
describing theories of physics that we

6604
02:05:34,390 --> 02:05:34,400
describing theories of physics that we
 

6605
02:05:34,400 --> 02:05:35,990
describing theories of physics that we
already know that's an important

6606
02:05:35,990 --> 02:05:36,000
already know that's an important
 

6607
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:37,229
already know that's an important
question and I do think that's what

6608
02:05:37,229 --> 02:05:37,239
question and I do think that's what
 

6609
02:05:37,239 --> 02:05:39,950
question and I do think that's what
Steven's trying to do and do well um but

6610
02:05:39,950 --> 02:05:39,960
Steven's trying to do and do well um but
 

6611
02:05:39,960 --> 02:05:42,149
Steven's trying to do and do well um but
it's then the question becomes does that

6612
02:05:42,149 --> 02:05:42,159
it's then the question becomes does that
 

6613
02:05:42,159 --> 02:05:45,470
it's then the question becomes does that
formulation of a more universal language

6614
02:05:45,470 --> 02:05:45,480
formulation of a more universal language
 

6615
02:05:45,480 --> 02:05:47,830
formulation of a more universal language
for describing the laws of physics that

6616
02:05:47,830 --> 02:05:47,840
for describing the laws of physics that
 

6617
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:49,790
for describing the laws of physics that
we know now tell us anything new about

6618
02:05:49,790 --> 02:05:49,800
we know now tell us anything new about
 

6619
02:05:49,800 --> 02:05:52,030
we know now tell us anything new about
the nature of reality

6620
02:05:52,030 --> 02:05:52,040
the nature of reality
 

6621
02:05:52,040 --> 02:05:53,549
the nature of reality
or is it a

6622
02:05:53,549 --> 02:05:53,559
or is it a
 

6623
02:05:53,559 --> 02:05:55,990
or is it a
language and to You languages are

6624
02:05:55,990 --> 02:05:56,000
language and to You languages are
 

6625
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:57,830
language and to You languages are
fundament can be

6626
02:05:57,830 --> 02:05:57,840
fundament can be
 

6627
02:05:57,840 --> 02:06:00,270
fundament can be
fundamental the language itself self is

6628
02:06:00,270 --> 02:06:00,280
fundamental the language itself self is
 

6629
02:06:00,280 --> 02:06:02,229
fundamental the language itself self is
never the fundamental thing it's

6630
02:06:02,229 --> 02:06:02,239
never the fundamental thing it's
 

6631
02:06:02,239 --> 02:06:04,510
never the fundamental thing it's
whatever it's describing so one of the

6632
02:06:04,510 --> 02:06:04,520
whatever it's describing so one of the
 

6633
02:06:04,520 --> 02:06:06,390
whatever it's describing so one of the
possible titles you were thinking about

6634
02:06:06,390 --> 02:06:06,400
possible titles you were thinking about
 

6635
02:06:06,400 --> 02:06:08,790
possible titles you were thinking about
originally for the book is the hard

6636
02:06:08,790 --> 02:06:08,800
originally for the book is the hard
 

6637
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:12,109
originally for the book is the hard
problem of Life sort of reminiscent of

6638
02:06:12,109 --> 02:06:12,119
problem of Life sort of reminiscent of
 

6639
02:06:12,119 --> 02:06:14,069
problem of Life sort of reminiscent of
the hard problem of Consciousness so

6640
02:06:14,069 --> 02:06:14,079
the hard problem of Consciousness so
 

6641
02:06:14,079 --> 02:06:15,950
the hard problem of Consciousness so
you're saying that assembly theory is

6642
02:06:15,950 --> 02:06:15,960
you're saying that assembly theory is
 

6643
02:06:15,960 --> 02:06:18,430
you're saying that assembly theory is
supposed to be answering the question

6644
02:06:18,430 --> 02:06:18,440
supposed to be answering the question
 

6645
02:06:18,440 --> 02:06:20,669
supposed to be answering the question
about what is life so let's go to the

6646
02:06:20,669 --> 02:06:20,679
about what is life so let's go to the
 

6647
02:06:20,679 --> 02:06:23,470
about what is life so let's go to the
other hard problems you also say that's

6648
02:06:23,470 --> 02:06:23,480
other hard problems you also say that's
 

6649
02:06:23,480 --> 02:06:26,189
other hard problems you also say that's
the easiest of the hard problems is the

6650
02:06:26,189 --> 02:06:26,199
the easiest of the hard problems is the
 

6651
02:06:26,199 --> 02:06:28,189
the easiest of the hard problems is the
is the hard problem of

6652
02:06:28,189 --> 02:06:28,199
is the hard problem of
 

6653
02:06:28,199 --> 02:06:32,229
is the hard problem of
Life uh so what do you

6654
02:06:32,229 --> 02:06:32,239
Life uh so what do you
 

6655
02:06:32,239 --> 02:06:36,470
Life uh so what do you
think is the nature of intelligence and

6656
02:06:36,470 --> 02:06:36,480
think is the nature of intelligence and
 

6657
02:06:36,480 --> 02:06:40,270
think is the nature of intelligence and
Consciousness you think something like

6658
02:06:40,270 --> 02:06:40,280
Consciousness you think something like
 

6659
02:06:40,280 --> 02:06:45,270
Consciousness you think something like
assembly Theory can help us understand

6660
02:06:45,270 --> 02:06:45,280
assembly Theory can help us understand
 

6661
02:06:45,280 --> 02:06:49,669
assembly Theory can help us understand
that I think if assembly theory is an

6662
02:06:49,669 --> 02:06:49,679
that I think if assembly theory is an
 

6663
02:06:49,679 --> 02:06:53,510
that I think if assembly theory is an
accurate depiction of the physics of

6664
02:06:53,510 --> 02:06:53,520
accurate depiction of the physics of
 

6665
02:06:53,520 --> 02:06:57,510
accurate depiction of the physics of
Life uh it should shed a lot of light on

6666
02:06:57,510 --> 02:06:57,520
Life uh it should shed a lot of light on
 

6667
02:06:57,520 --> 02:06:59,709
Life uh it should shed a lot of light on
those problems and in fact I sometimes

6668
02:06:59,709 --> 02:06:59,719
those problems and in fact I sometimes
 

6669
02:06:59,719 --> 02:07:01,189
those problems and in fact I sometimes
wonder if the problems of Consciousness

6670
02:07:01,189 --> 02:07:01,199
wonder if the problems of Consciousness
 

6671
02:07:01,199 --> 02:07:03,350
wonder if the problems of Consciousness
and intelligence are at all different

6672
02:07:03,350 --> 02:07:03,360
and intelligence are at all different
 

6673
02:07:03,360 --> 02:07:05,310
and intelligence are at all different
than the problem of Life

6674
02:07:05,310 --> 02:07:05,320
than the problem of Life
 

6675
02:07:05,320 --> 02:07:09,350
than the problem of Life
generally um and I'm not I'm I I'm of

6676
02:07:09,350 --> 02:07:09,360
generally um and I'm not I'm I I'm of
 

6677
02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:12,069
generally um and I'm not I'm I I'm of
two minds of it but I I in general try

6678
02:07:12,069 --> 02:07:12,079
two minds of it but I I in general try
 

6679
02:07:12,079 --> 02:07:15,310
two minds of it but I I in general try
to you know like the process of my

6680
02:07:15,310 --> 02:07:15,320
to you know like the process of my
 

6681
02:07:15,320 --> 02:07:16,950
to you know like the process of my
thinking is trying to regularize

6682
02:07:16,950 --> 02:07:16,960
thinking is trying to regularize
 

6683
02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:18,750
thinking is trying to regularize
everything into one Theory so pretty

6684
02:07:18,750 --> 02:07:18,760
everything into one Theory so pretty
 

6685
02:07:18,760 --> 02:07:21,229
everything into one Theory so pretty
much every interaction I have is like oh

6686
02:07:21,229 --> 02:07:21,239
much every interaction I have is like oh
 

6687
02:07:21,239 --> 02:07:23,270
much every interaction I have is like oh
how do I fold that into and like so I'm

6688
02:07:23,270 --> 02:07:23,280
how do I fold that into and like so I'm
 

6689
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:24,830
how do I fold that into and like so I'm
just building this giant abstraction

6690
02:07:24,830 --> 02:07:24,840
just building this giant abstraction
 

6691
02:07:24,840 --> 02:07:26,310
just building this giant abstraction
that's basically trying to take every

6692
02:07:26,310 --> 02:07:26,320
that's basically trying to take every
 

6693
02:07:26,320 --> 02:07:28,750
that's basically trying to take every
piece of data I've ever gotten in my in

6694
02:07:28,750 --> 02:07:28,760
piece of data I've ever gotten in my in
 

6695
02:07:28,760 --> 02:07:32,030
piece of data I've ever gotten in my in
my brain into a theory of what life is

6696
02:07:32,030 --> 02:07:32,040
my brain into a theory of what life is
 

6697
02:07:32,040 --> 02:07:34,629
my brain into a theory of what life is
um and Consciousness and intelligence

6698
02:07:34,629 --> 02:07:34,639
um and Consciousness and intelligence
 

6699
02:07:34,639 --> 02:07:35,950
um and Consciousness and intelligence
are obviously some of the most

6700
02:07:35,950 --> 02:07:35,960
are obviously some of the most
 

6701
02:07:35,960 --> 02:07:37,510
are obviously some of the most
interesting things that life has

6702
02:07:37,510 --> 02:07:37,520
interesting things that life has
 

6703
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:40,109
interesting things that life has
manifest and so I think they're very

6704
02:07:40,109 --> 02:07:40,119
manifest and so I think they're very
 

6705
02:07:40,119 --> 02:07:42,830
manifest and so I think they're very
telling about some of the deeper

6706
02:07:42,830 --> 02:07:42,840
telling about some of the deeper
 

6707
02:07:42,840 --> 02:07:45,350
telling about some of the deeper
features about the nature of life it do

6708
02:07:45,350 --> 02:07:45,360
features about the nature of life it do
 

6709
02:07:45,360 --> 02:07:48,030
features about the nature of life it do
seem like they're all flavors of the

6710
02:07:48,030 --> 02:07:48,040
seem like they're all flavors of the
 

6711
02:07:48,040 --> 02:07:49,950
seem like they're all flavors of the
same thing but it's interesting to

6712
02:07:49,950 --> 02:07:49,960
same thing but it's interesting to
 

6713
02:07:49,960 --> 02:07:52,310
same thing but it's interesting to
wonder like at which stage

6714
02:07:52,310 --> 02:07:52,320
wonder like at which stage
 

6715
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:53,830
wonder like at which stage
that's something that we we would

6716
02:07:53,830 --> 02:07:53,840
that's something that we we would
 

6717
02:07:53,840 --> 02:07:57,669
that's something that we we would
recognize as life in a sort of canonical

6718
02:07:57,669 --> 02:07:57,679
recognize as life in a sort of canonical
 

6719
02:07:57,679 --> 02:08:00,030
recognize as life in a sort of canonical
silly human way and something that we

6720
02:08:00,030 --> 02:08:00,040
silly human way and something that we
 

6721
02:08:00,040 --> 02:08:01,589
silly human way and something that we
would recognize as

6722
02:08:01,589 --> 02:08:01,599
would recognize as
 

6723
02:08:01,599 --> 02:08:03,549
would recognize as
intelligence at which stage does that

6724
02:08:03,549 --> 02:08:03,559
intelligence at which stage does that
 

6725
02:08:03,559 --> 02:08:05,629
intelligence at which stage does that
emerge like at which assembly index does

6726
02:08:05,629 --> 02:08:05,639
emerge like at which assembly index does
 

6727
02:08:05,639 --> 02:08:07,950
emerge like at which assembly index does
that emerge and which assembly index is

6728
02:08:07,950 --> 02:08:07,960
that emerge and which assembly index is
 

6729
02:08:07,960 --> 02:08:10,750
that emerge and which assembly index is
a Consciousness something that we would

6730
02:08:10,750 --> 02:08:10,760
a Consciousness something that we would
 

6731
02:08:10,760 --> 02:08:12,669
a Consciousness something that we would
canonically recognize as Consciousness

6732
02:08:12,669 --> 02:08:12,679
canonically recognize as Consciousness
 

6733
02:08:12,679 --> 02:08:14,669
canonically recognize as Consciousness
is this the use like this use of flavors

6734
02:08:14,669 --> 02:08:14,679
is this the use like this use of flavors
 

6735
02:08:14,679 --> 02:08:15,709
is this the use like this use of flavors
the same as you meant when you're

6736
02:08:15,709 --> 02:08:15,719
the same as you meant when you're
 

6737
02:08:15,719 --> 02:08:17,750
the same as you meant when you're
talking about flavors of alien int like

6738
02:08:17,750 --> 02:08:17,760
talking about flavors of alien int like
 

6739
02:08:17,760 --> 02:08:21,589
talking about flavors of alien int like
alien life yeah sure yeah I mean it's

6740
02:08:21,589 --> 02:08:21,599
alien life yeah sure yeah I mean it's
 

6741
02:08:21,599 --> 02:08:23,030
alien life yeah sure yeah I mean it's
same as the flavors of ice cream and the

6742
02:08:23,030 --> 02:08:23,040
same as the flavors of ice cream and the
 

6743
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:25,629
same as the flavors of ice cream and the
flavors of fashion yeah like but we were

6744
02:08:25,629 --> 02:08:25,639
flavors of fashion yeah like but we were
 

6745
02:08:25,639 --> 02:08:27,030
flavors of fashion yeah like but we were
talking about in terms of colors and

6746
02:08:27,030 --> 02:08:27,040
talking about in terms of colors and
 

6747
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:28,629
talking about in terms of colors and
like very non-descript but the way that

6748
02:08:28,629 --> 02:08:28,639
like very non-descript but the way that
 

6749
02:08:28,639 --> 02:08:30,149
like very non-descript but the way that
you just talked about flavors now was

6750
02:08:30,149 --> 02:08:30,159
you just talked about flavors now was
 

6751
02:08:30,159 --> 02:08:31,589
you just talked about flavors now was
more in like the space of Consciousness

6752
02:08:31,589 --> 02:08:31,599
more in like the space of Consciousness
 

6753
02:08:31,599 --> 02:08:33,189
more in like the space of Consciousness
and intelligence it was kind of like

6754
02:08:33,189 --> 02:08:33,199
and intelligence it was kind of like
 

6755
02:08:33,199 --> 02:08:35,109
and intelligence it was kind of like
much more specific it'd be nice if there

6756
02:08:35,109 --> 02:08:35,119
much more specific it'd be nice if there
 

6757
02:08:35,119 --> 02:08:38,510
much more specific it'd be nice if there
was a formal way of of expressing

6758
02:08:38,510 --> 02:08:38,520
was a formal way of of expressing
 

6759
02:08:38,520 --> 02:08:41,270
was a formal way of of expressing
quantifying flavors quantifying flavors

6760
02:08:41,270 --> 02:08:41,280
quantifying flavors quantifying flavors
 

6761
02:08:41,280 --> 02:08:44,189
quantifying flavors quantifying flavors
yeah it it seems

6762
02:08:44,189 --> 02:08:44,199
yeah it it seems
 

6763
02:08:44,199 --> 02:08:46,589
yeah it it seems
like um I would order it life

6764
02:08:46,589 --> 02:08:46,599
like um I would order it life
 

6765
02:08:46,599 --> 02:08:49,430
like um I would order it life
Consciousness intelligence probably as

6766
02:08:49,430 --> 02:08:49,440
Consciousness intelligence probably as
 

6767
02:08:49,440 --> 02:08:51,950
Consciousness intelligence probably as
like uh the order in which things emerge

6768
02:08:51,950 --> 02:08:51,960
like uh the order in which things emerge
 

6769
02:08:51,960 --> 02:08:53,510
like uh the order in which things emerge
and they're all just it's a part the

6770
02:08:53,510 --> 02:08:53,520
and they're all just it's a part the
 

6771
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:56,870
and they're all just it's a part the
same they're the same we're using the

6772
02:08:56,870 --> 02:08:56,880
same they're the same we're using the
 

6773
02:08:56,880 --> 02:09:00,229
same they're the same we're using the
word life differently here I mean life

6774
02:09:00,229 --> 02:09:00,239
word life differently here I mean life
 

6775
02:09:00,239 --> 02:09:02,589
word life differently here I mean life
sort of when I'm talking about what is a

6776
02:09:02,589 --> 02:09:02,599
sort of when I'm talking about what is a
 

6777
02:09:02,599 --> 02:09:04,350
sort of when I'm talking about what is a
living versus a non-living thing at a

6778
02:09:04,350 --> 02:09:04,360
living versus a non-living thing at a
 

6779
02:09:04,360 --> 02:09:06,390
living versus a non-living thing at a
bar with a person I'm already

6780
02:09:06,390 --> 02:09:06,400
bar with a person I'm already
 

6781
02:09:06,400 --> 02:09:09,229
bar with a person I'm already
like four or five drinks in that kind of

6782
02:09:09,229 --> 02:09:09,239
like four or five drinks in that kind of
 

6783
02:09:09,239 --> 02:09:12,310
like four or five drinks in that kind of
thing just that like we're not we're not

6784
02:09:12,310 --> 02:09:12,320
thing just that like we're not we're not
 

6785
02:09:12,320 --> 02:09:14,109
thing just that like we're not we're not
being too philosophical like here's the

6786
02:09:14,109 --> 02:09:14,119
being too philosophical like here's the
 

6787
02:09:14,119 --> 02:09:15,149
being too philosophical like here's the
thing that moves and here's the thing

6788
02:09:15,149 --> 02:09:15,159
thing that moves and here's the thing
 

6789
02:09:15,159 --> 02:09:19,149
thing that moves and here's the thing
that doesn't move and uh but maybe

6790
02:09:19,149 --> 02:09:19,159
that doesn't move and uh but maybe
 

6791
02:09:19,159 --> 02:09:22,950
that doesn't move and uh but maybe
Consciousness precedes that it's a weird

6792
02:09:22,950 --> 02:09:22,960
Consciousness precedes that it's a weird
 

6793
02:09:22,960 --> 02:09:26,350
Consciousness precedes that it's a weird
dance there like is life precede

6794
02:09:26,350 --> 02:09:26,360
dance there like is life precede
 

6795
02:09:26,360 --> 02:09:28,910
dance there like is life precede
Consciousness or Consciousness precede

6796
02:09:28,910 --> 02:09:28,920
Consciousness or Consciousness precede
 

6797
02:09:28,920 --> 02:09:32,629
Consciousness or Consciousness precede
life and I think that understanding of

6798
02:09:32,629 --> 02:09:32,639
life and I think that understanding of
 

6799
02:09:32,639 --> 02:09:35,109
life and I think that understanding of
what life is in the way you're doing

6800
02:09:35,109 --> 02:09:35,119
what life is in the way you're doing
 

6801
02:09:35,119 --> 02:09:37,790
what life is in the way you're doing
will help us disentangle that depending

6802
02:09:37,790 --> 02:09:37,800
will help us disentangle that depending
 

6803
02:09:37,800 --> 02:09:39,189
will help us disentangle that depending
on what you want to explain as I was

6804
02:09:39,189 --> 02:09:39,199
on what you want to explain as I was
 

6805
02:09:39,199 --> 02:09:40,510
on what you want to explain as I was
saying before you have to assume

6806
02:09:40,510 --> 02:09:40,520
saying before you have to assume
 

6807
02:09:40,520 --> 02:09:42,709
saying before you have to assume
something's fundamental and so because

6808
02:09:42,709 --> 02:09:42,719
something's fundamental and so because
 

6809
02:09:42,719 --> 02:09:45,229
something's fundamental and so because
people can't explain Consciousness uh

6810
02:09:45,229 --> 02:09:45,239
people can't explain Consciousness uh
 

6811
02:09:45,239 --> 02:09:46,950
people can't explain Consciousness uh
there's a Temptation for some people to

6812
02:09:46,950 --> 02:09:46,960
there's a Temptation for some people to
 

6813
02:09:46,960 --> 02:09:48,109
there's a Temptation for some people to
want to take Consciousness as

6814
02:09:48,109 --> 02:09:48,119
want to take Consciousness as
 

6815
02:09:48,119 --> 02:09:49,470
want to take Consciousness as
fundamental and assume everything else

6816
02:09:49,470 --> 02:09:49,480
fundamental and assume everything else
 

6817
02:09:49,480 --> 02:09:51,589
fundamental and assume everything else
is derived out of that and then you get

6818
02:09:51,589 --> 02:09:51,599
is derived out of that and then you get
 

6819
02:09:51,599 --> 02:09:54,310
is derived out of that and then you get
some people um that want to assume

6820
02:09:54,310 --> 02:09:54,320
some people um that want to assume
 

6821
02:09:54,320 --> 02:09:56,990
some people um that want to assume
Consciousness preceded life and I don't

6822
02:09:56,990 --> 02:09:57,000
Consciousness preceded life and I don't
 

6823
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:58,950
Consciousness preceded life and I don't
I don't find either of those views

6824
02:09:58,950 --> 02:09:58,960
I don't find either of those views
 

6825
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:00,270
I don't find either of those views
particularly

6826
02:10:00,270 --> 02:10:00,280
particularly
 

6827
02:10:00,280 --> 02:10:03,390
particularly
Illuminating um I think because I don't

6828
02:10:03,390 --> 02:10:03,400
Illuminating um I think because I don't
 

6829
02:10:03,400 --> 02:10:04,950
Illuminating um I think because I don't
I don't want to assume a feminology

6830
02:10:04,950 --> 02:10:04,960
I don't want to assume a feminology
 

6831
02:10:04,960 --> 02:10:07,109
I don't want to assume a feminology
before I explain a thing and so what

6832
02:10:07,109 --> 02:10:07,119
before I explain a thing and so what
 

6833
02:10:07,119 --> 02:10:09,870
before I explain a thing and so what
I've tried really hard to do is is not

6834
02:10:09,870 --> 02:10:09,880
I've tried really hard to do is is not
 

6835
02:10:09,880 --> 02:10:13,310
I've tried really hard to do is is not
assume that I think life is anything um

6836
02:10:13,310 --> 02:10:13,320
assume that I think life is anything um
 

6837
02:10:13,320 --> 02:10:15,629
assume that I think life is anything um
except hold on to sort of the patterns

6838
02:10:15,629 --> 02:10:15,639
except hold on to sort of the patterns
 

6839
02:10:15,639 --> 02:10:17,470
except hold on to sort of the patterns
and structures that seem to be the sort

6840
02:10:17,470 --> 02:10:17,480
and structures that seem to be the sort
 

6841
02:10:17,480 --> 02:10:19,189
and structures that seem to be the sort
of consistent ways that we talk about

6842
02:10:19,189 --> 02:10:19,199
of consistent ways that we talk about
 

6843
02:10:19,199 --> 02:10:20,350
of consistent ways that we talk about
this thing and then try to build a

6844
02:10:20,350 --> 02:10:20,360
this thing and then try to build a
 

6845
02:10:20,360 --> 02:10:22,990
this thing and then try to build a
physics that describes that um and I

6846
02:10:22,990 --> 02:10:23,000
physics that describes that um and I
 

6847
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:24,310
physics that describes that um and I
think that's a really different approach

6848
02:10:24,310 --> 02:10:24,320
think that's a really different approach
 

6849
02:10:24,320 --> 02:10:26,910
think that's a really different approach
than saying you know Consciousness is

6850
02:10:26,910 --> 02:10:26,920
than saying you know Consciousness is
 

6851
02:10:26,920 --> 02:10:29,350
than saying you know Consciousness is
this thing you know we all feel and

6852
02:10:29,350 --> 02:10:29,360
this thing you know we all feel and
 

6853
02:10:29,360 --> 02:10:32,270
this thing you know we all feel and
experience about things um I would want

6854
02:10:32,270 --> 02:10:32,280
experience about things um I would want
 

6855
02:10:32,280 --> 02:10:33,549
experience about things um I would want
to understand the regularities

6856
02:10:33,549 --> 02:10:33,559
to understand the regularities
 

6857
02:10:33,559 --> 02:10:35,069
to understand the regularities
associated with that and build a deeper

6858
02:10:35,069 --> 02:10:35,079
associated with that and build a deeper
 

6859
02:10:35,079 --> 02:10:36,750
associated with that and build a deeper
structure underneath that and build into

6860
02:10:36,750 --> 02:10:36,760
structure underneath that and build into
 

6861
02:10:36,760 --> 02:10:39,350
structure underneath that and build into
it I wouldn't want to assume that thing

6862
02:10:39,350 --> 02:10:39,360
it I wouldn't want to assume that thing
 

6863
02:10:39,360 --> 02:10:40,870
it I wouldn't want to assume that thing
and that I understand that thing which

6864
02:10:40,870 --> 02:10:40,880
and that I understand that thing which
 

6865
02:10:40,880 --> 02:10:42,470
and that I understand that thing which
is usually how I see people talk about

6866
02:10:42,470 --> 02:10:42,480
is usually how I see people talk about
 

6867
02:10:42,480 --> 02:10:45,270
is usually how I see people talk about
it the difference between uh life and

6868
02:10:45,270 --> 02:10:45,280
it the difference between uh life and
 

6869
02:10:45,280 --> 02:10:47,390
it the difference between uh life and
Consciousness yeah which which comes

6870
02:10:47,390 --> 02:10:47,400
Consciousness yeah which which comes
 

6871
02:10:47,400 --> 02:10:50,950
Consciousness yeah which which comes
first yeah so I think if you're thinking

6872
02:10:50,950 --> 02:10:50,960
first yeah so I think if you're thinking
 

6873
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:52,030
first yeah so I think if you're thinking
about

6874
02:10:52,030 --> 02:10:52,040
about
 

6875
02:10:52,040 --> 02:10:54,910
about
um this sort of thinking about living

6876
02:10:54,910 --> 02:10:54,920
um this sort of thinking about living
 

6877
02:10:54,920 --> 02:10:57,709
um this sort of thinking about living
things as these giant causal structures

6878
02:10:57,709 --> 02:10:57,719
things as these giant causal structures
 

6879
02:10:57,719 --> 02:10:59,350
things as these giant causal structures
or these objects that are deep in time

6880
02:10:59,350 --> 02:10:59,360
or these objects that are deep in time
 

6881
02:10:59,360 --> 02:11:01,149
or these objects that are deep in time
or whatever language we end up using to

6882
02:11:01,149 --> 02:11:01,159
or whatever language we end up using to
 

6883
02:11:01,159 --> 02:11:03,750
or whatever language we end up using to
describe it

6884
02:11:03,750 --> 02:11:03,760
describe it
 

6885
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:08,030
describe it
um it seems to me that

6886
02:11:08,030 --> 02:11:08,040
um it seems to me that
 

6887
02:11:08,040 --> 02:11:12,069
um it seems to me that
Consciousness is about the fact that we

6888
02:11:12,069 --> 02:11:12,079
Consciousness is about the fact that we
 

6889
02:11:12,079 --> 02:11:14,109
Consciousness is about the fact that we
have a conscious experience is because

6890
02:11:14,109 --> 02:11:14,119
have a conscious experience is because
 

6891
02:11:14,119 --> 02:11:16,430
have a conscious experience is because
we are these temporally extended objects

6892
02:11:16,430 --> 02:11:16,440
we are these temporally extended objects
 

6893
02:11:16,440 --> 02:11:18,109
we are these temporally extended objects
so Consciousness and the abstraction

6894
02:11:18,109 --> 02:11:18,119
so Consciousness and the abstraction
 

6895
02:11:18,119 --> 02:11:20,549
so Consciousness and the abstraction
that we have in our minds is actually a

6896
02:11:20,549 --> 02:11:20,559
that we have in our minds is actually a
 

6897
02:11:20,559 --> 02:11:22,069
that we have in our minds is actually a
manifestation of all the time that's

6898
02:11:22,069 --> 02:11:22,079
manifestation of all the time that's
 

6899
02:11:22,079 --> 02:11:23,549
manifestation of all the time that's
rolled up in us and it's just because

6900
02:11:23,549 --> 02:11:23,559
rolled up in us and it's just because
 

6901
02:11:23,559 --> 02:11:25,750
rolled up in us and it's just because
we're so huge that we have this very

6902
02:11:25,750 --> 02:11:25,760
we're so huge that we have this very
 

6903
02:11:25,760 --> 02:11:27,549
we're so huge that we have this very
large Inner Space that we're

6904
02:11:27,549 --> 02:11:27,559
large Inner Space that we're
 

6905
02:11:27,559 --> 02:11:29,629
large Inner Space that we're
experiencing that's not and it's also

6906
02:11:29,629 --> 02:11:29,639
experiencing that's not and it's also
 

6907
02:11:29,639 --> 02:11:31,270
experiencing that's not and it's also
separated off from the rest of the world

6908
02:11:31,270 --> 02:11:31,280
separated off from the rest of the world
 

6909
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:32,790
separated off from the rest of the world
because we're the separate thread in

6910
02:11:32,790 --> 02:11:32,800
because we're the separate thread in
 

6911
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:35,390
because we're the separate thread in
time um and so our Consciousness is not

6912
02:11:35,390 --> 02:11:35,400
time um and so our Consciousness is not
 

6913
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:36,990
time um and so our Consciousness is not
exactly shared with anything else

6914
02:11:36,990 --> 02:11:37,000
exactly shared with anything else
 

6915
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,870
exactly shared with anything else
because nothing else occupies the same

6916
02:11:39,870 --> 02:11:39,880
because nothing else occupies the same
 

6917
02:11:39,880 --> 02:11:43,189
because nothing else occupies the same
uh part of time that we occupy but I can

6918
02:11:43,189 --> 02:11:43,199
uh part of time that we occupy but I can
 

6919
02:11:43,199 --> 02:11:44,750
uh part of time that we occupy but I can
understand something about you may be

6920
02:11:44,750 --> 02:11:44,760
understand something about you may be
 

6921
02:11:44,760 --> 02:11:47,470
understand something about you may be
being conscious because you and I didn't

6922
02:11:47,470 --> 02:11:47,480
being conscious because you and I didn't
 

6923
02:11:47,480 --> 02:11:51,270
being conscious because you and I didn't
separate that far in the past um in in

6924
02:11:51,270 --> 02:11:51,280
separate that far in the past um in in
 

6925
02:11:51,280 --> 02:11:53,549
separate that far in the past um in in
terms of our causal history so in some

6926
02:11:53,549 --> 02:11:53,559
terms of our causal history so in some
 

6927
02:11:53,559 --> 02:11:55,350
terms of our causal history so in some
sense we can even share experiences with

6928
02:11:55,350 --> 02:11:55,360
sense we can even share experiences with
 

6929
02:11:55,360 --> 02:11:57,589
sense we can even share experiences with
each other through language because of

6930
02:11:57,589 --> 02:11:57,599
each other through language because of
 

6931
02:11:57,599 --> 02:12:00,549
each other through language because of
that sort of overlap in our structure

6932
02:12:00,549 --> 02:12:00,559
that sort of overlap in our structure
 

6933
02:12:00,559 --> 02:12:03,629
that sort of overlap in our structure
well then if uh Consciousness is merely

6934
02:12:03,629 --> 02:12:03,639
well then if uh Consciousness is merely
 

6935
02:12:03,639 --> 02:12:06,430
well then if uh Consciousness is merely
temporal separateness then that comes

6936
02:12:06,430 --> 02:12:06,440
temporal separateness then that comes
 

6937
02:12:06,440 --> 02:12:09,149
temporal separateness then that comes
before life it's not merely temporal

6938
02:12:09,149 --> 02:12:09,159
before life it's not merely temporal
 

6939
02:12:09,159 --> 02:12:10,790
before life it's not merely temporal
separateness it's about the depth in

6940
02:12:10,790 --> 02:12:10,800
separateness it's about the depth in
 

6941
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:13,669
separateness it's about the depth in
that time so it's the reason that my

6942
02:12:13,669 --> 02:12:13,679
that time so it's the reason that my
 

6943
02:12:13,679 --> 02:12:15,430
that time so it's the reason that my
conscious experience is not the same as

6944
02:12:15,430 --> 02:12:15,440
conscious experience is not the same as
 

6945
02:12:15,440 --> 02:12:17,229
conscious experience is not the same as
yours is because we're separated in time

6946
02:12:17,229 --> 02:12:17,239
yours is because we're separated in time
 

6947
02:12:17,239 --> 02:12:18,510
yours is because we're separated in time
the fact that I have a conscious

6948
02:12:18,510 --> 02:12:18,520
the fact that I have a conscious
 

6949
02:12:18,520 --> 02:12:19,830
the fact that I have a conscious
experience is because I'm an object

6950
02:12:19,830 --> 02:12:19,840
experience is because I'm an object
 

6951
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:22,870
experience is because I'm an object
that's super deep in time so I'm huge in

6952
02:12:22,870 --> 02:12:22,880
that's super deep in time so I'm huge in
 

6953
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:25,510
that's super deep in time so I'm huge in
time and that means that there's a lot

6954
02:12:25,510 --> 02:12:25,520
time and that means that there's a lot
 

6955
02:12:25,520 --> 02:12:27,870
time and that means that there's a lot
there that I am basically in some sense

6956
02:12:27,870 --> 02:12:27,880
there that I am basically in some sense
 

6957
02:12:27,880 --> 02:12:29,910
there that I am basically in some sense
a Universe on to myself because my

6958
02:12:29,910 --> 02:12:29,920
a Universe on to myself because my
 

6959
02:12:29,920 --> 02:12:31,589
a Universe on to myself because my
structure is so large relative to the

6960
02:12:31,589 --> 02:12:31,599
structure is so large relative to the
 

6961
02:12:31,599 --> 02:12:34,430
structure is so large relative to the
amount of space that I occupy um but it

6962
02:12:34,430 --> 02:12:34,440
amount of space that I occupy um but it
 

6963
02:12:34,440 --> 02:12:37,549
amount of space that I occupy um but it
feels like that's possible to do before

6964
02:12:37,549 --> 02:12:37,559
feels like that's possible to do before
 

6965
02:12:37,559 --> 02:12:40,669
feels like that's possible to do before
you get anything like bacteria I think

6966
02:12:40,669 --> 02:12:40,679
you get anything like bacteria I think
 

6967
02:12:40,679 --> 02:12:42,910
you get anything like bacteria I think
there's a horizon and I don't know how

6968
02:12:42,910 --> 02:12:42,920
there's a horizon and I don't know how
 

6969
02:12:42,920 --> 02:12:44,589
there's a horizon and I don't know how
to articulate this yet it's a little bit

6970
02:12:44,589 --> 02:12:44,599
to articulate this yet it's a little bit
 

6971
02:12:44,599 --> 02:12:46,229
to articulate this yet it's a little bit
like the Horizon at the original life

6972
02:12:46,229 --> 02:12:46,239
like the Horizon at the original life
 

6973
02:12:46,239 --> 02:12:49,669
like the Horizon at the original life
where the space inside a particular

6974
02:12:49,669 --> 02:12:49,679
where the space inside a particular
 

6975
02:12:49,679 --> 02:12:52,030
where the space inside a particular
structure becomes so large that it has

6976
02:12:52,030 --> 02:12:52,040
structure becomes so large that it has
 

6977
02:12:52,040 --> 02:12:55,790
structure becomes so large that it has
some access to a space that's not um

6978
02:12:55,790 --> 02:12:55,800
some access to a space that's not um
 

6979
02:12:55,800 --> 02:12:57,870
some access to a space that's not um
that doesn't feel as physical it's

6980
02:12:57,870 --> 02:12:57,880
that doesn't feel as physical it's
 

6981
02:12:57,880 --> 02:12:59,790
that doesn't feel as physical it's
almost like this idea of

6982
02:12:59,790 --> 02:12:59,800
almost like this idea of
 

6983
02:12:59,800 --> 02:13:03,229
almost like this idea of
counterfactuals um so I think like the

6984
02:13:03,229 --> 02:13:03,239
counterfactuals um so I think like the
 

6985
02:13:03,239 --> 02:13:06,229
counterfactuals um so I think like the
the past history of your horizon is just

6986
02:13:06,229 --> 02:13:06,239
the past history of your horizon is just
 

6987
02:13:06,239 --> 02:13:08,990
the past history of your horizon is just
much larger than can be encompassed in

6988
02:13:08,990 --> 02:13:09,000
much larger than can be encompassed in
 

6989
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,350
much larger than can be encompassed in
like a small configuration of matter so

6990
02:13:11,350 --> 02:13:11,360
like a small configuration of matter so
 

6991
02:13:11,360 --> 02:13:13,390
like a small configuration of matter so
you you can like pull this stuff into

6992
02:13:13,390 --> 02:13:13,400
you you can like pull this stuff into
 

6993
02:13:13,400 --> 02:13:16,149
you you can like pull this stuff into
existence this property is maybe a

6994
02:13:16,149 --> 02:13:16,159
existence this property is maybe a
 

6995
02:13:16,159 --> 02:13:17,629
existence this property is maybe a
continuous property but there's

6996
02:13:17,629 --> 02:13:17,639
continuous property but there's
 

6997
02:13:17,639 --> 02:13:21,109
continuous property but there's
something really different about um

6998
02:13:21,109 --> 02:13:21,119
something really different about um
 

6999
02:13:21,119 --> 02:13:23,830
something really different about um
human level physical systems and human

7000
02:13:23,830 --> 02:13:23,840
human level physical systems and human
 

7001
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:27,669
human level physical systems and human
level ability to understand reality I

7002
02:13:27,669 --> 02:13:27,679
level ability to understand reality I
 

7003
02:13:27,679 --> 02:13:29,510
level ability to understand reality I
really love David Deutsch's conception

7004
02:13:29,510 --> 02:13:29,520
really love David Deutsch's conception
 

7005
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:32,109
really love David Deutsch's conception
of universal explainers and like and

7006
02:13:32,109 --> 02:13:32,119
of universal explainers and like and
 

7007
02:13:32,119 --> 02:13:34,310
of universal explainers and like and
that's related to theory of universal

7008
02:13:34,310 --> 02:13:34,320
that's related to theory of universal
 

7009
02:13:34,320 --> 02:13:38,270
that's related to theory of universal
computation um and I think there's some

7010
02:13:38,270 --> 02:13:38,280
computation um and I think there's some
 

7011
02:13:38,280 --> 02:13:41,709
computation um and I think there's some
transition that happens there um but

7012
02:13:41,709 --> 02:13:41,719
transition that happens there um but
 

7013
02:13:41,719 --> 02:13:43,310
transition that happens there um but
maybe maybe to describe that a little

7014
02:13:43,310 --> 02:13:43,320
maybe maybe to describe that a little
 

7015
02:13:43,320 --> 02:13:45,270
maybe maybe to describe that a little
bit better what I can also say is like

7016
02:13:45,270 --> 02:13:45,280
bit better what I can also say is like
 

7017
02:13:45,280 --> 02:13:46,750
bit better what I can also say is like
what intelligence is in this this

7018
02:13:46,750 --> 02:13:46,760
what intelligence is in this this
 

7019
02:13:46,760 --> 02:13:48,390
what intelligence is in this this
framework so you have these these these

7020
02:13:48,390 --> 02:13:48,400
framework so you have these these these
 

7021
02:13:48,400 --> 02:13:51,149
framework so you have these these these
objects that are uh you know large and

7022
02:13:51,149 --> 02:13:51,159
objects that are uh you know large and
 

7023
02:13:51,159 --> 02:13:53,990
objects that are uh you know large and
time they were selected to Exist by

7024
02:13:53,990 --> 02:13:54,000
time they were selected to Exist by
 

7025
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:57,149
time they were selected to Exist by
constraining the possible um space of

7026
02:13:57,149 --> 02:13:57,159
constraining the possible um space of
 

7027
02:13:57,159 --> 02:13:58,910
constraining the possible um space of
objects to this particular like all of

7028
02:13:58,910 --> 02:13:58,920
objects to this particular like all of
 

7029
02:13:58,920 --> 02:14:00,830
objects to this particular like all of
the matter is funneled into this this

7030
02:14:00,830 --> 02:14:00,840
the matter is funneled into this this
 

7031
02:14:00,840 --> 02:14:03,430
the matter is funneled into this this
particular configuration of object um

7032
02:14:03,430 --> 02:14:03,440
particular configuration of object um
 

7033
02:14:03,440 --> 02:14:05,950
particular configuration of object um
over time and so these objects arise

7034
02:14:05,950 --> 02:14:05,960
over time and so these objects arise
 

7035
02:14:05,960 --> 02:14:08,229
over time and so these objects arise
through selection but the more selection

7036
02:14:08,229 --> 02:14:08,239
through selection but the more selection
 

7037
02:14:08,239 --> 02:14:10,310
through selection but the more selection
that you have embedded in you the more

7038
02:14:10,310 --> 02:14:10,320
that you have embedded in you the more
 

7039
02:14:10,320 --> 02:14:11,870
that you have embedded in you the more
possible selection you have on your

7040
02:14:11,870 --> 02:14:11,880
possible selection you have on your
 

7041
02:14:11,880 --> 02:14:16,149
possible selection you have on your
future and so um so selection and

7042
02:14:16,149 --> 02:14:16,159
future and so um so selection and
 

7043
02:14:16,159 --> 02:14:17,830
future and so um so selection and
evolution we usually think about in the

7044
02:14:17,830 --> 02:14:17,840
evolution we usually think about in the
 

7045
02:14:17,840 --> 02:14:20,109
evolution we usually think about in the
past sense where selection happened in

7046
02:14:20,109 --> 02:14:20,119
past sense where selection happened in
 

7047
02:14:20,119 --> 02:14:21,549
past sense where selection happened in
the past

7048
02:14:21,549 --> 02:14:21,559
the past
 

7049
02:14:21,559 --> 02:14:25,790
the past
um but objects that are high density

7050
02:14:25,790 --> 02:14:25,800
um but objects that are high density
 

7051
02:14:25,800 --> 02:14:27,350
um but objects that are high density
configurations of matter that have a lot

7052
02:14:27,350 --> 02:14:27,360
configurations of matter that have a lot
 

7053
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:30,109
configurations of matter that have a lot
of selection in them are also selecting

7054
02:14:30,109 --> 02:14:30,119
of selection in them are also selecting
 

7055
02:14:30,119 --> 02:14:31,830
of selection in them are also selecting
agents in the universe so they actually

7056
02:14:31,830 --> 02:14:31,840
agents in the universe so they actually
 

7057
02:14:31,840 --> 02:14:33,510
agents in the universe so they actually
embody the physics of selection and they

7058
02:14:33,510 --> 02:14:33,520
embody the physics of selection and they
 

7059
02:14:33,520 --> 02:14:35,709
embody the physics of selection and they
can select on possible Futures and I

7060
02:14:35,709 --> 02:14:35,719
can select on possible Futures and I
 

7061
02:14:35,719 --> 02:14:37,589
can select on possible Futures and I
guess what I'm saying with respect to

7062
02:14:37,589 --> 02:14:37,599
guess what I'm saying with respect to
 

7063
02:14:37,599 --> 02:14:40,629
guess what I'm saying with respect to
Consciousness and the experience we have

7064
02:14:40,629 --> 02:14:40,639
Consciousness and the experience we have
 

7065
02:14:40,639 --> 02:14:42,189
Consciousness and the experience we have
is that there's something very deep

7066
02:14:42,189 --> 02:14:42,199
is that there's something very deep
 

7067
02:14:42,199 --> 02:14:44,109
is that there's something very deep
about that structure and the nature of

7068
02:14:44,109 --> 02:14:44,119
about that structure and the nature of
 

7069
02:14:44,119 --> 02:14:46,430
about that structure and the nature of
how we exist in that structure that has

7070
02:14:46,430 --> 02:14:46,440
how we exist in that structure that has
 

7071
02:14:46,440 --> 02:14:49,830
how we exist in that structure that has
to do with how how we're navigating that

7072
02:14:49,830 --> 02:14:49,840
to do with how how we're navigating that
 

7073
02:14:49,840 --> 02:14:52,189
to do with how how we're navigating that
space and how we generate that space and

7074
02:14:52,189 --> 02:14:52,199
space and how we generate that space and
 

7075
02:14:52,199 --> 02:14:54,589
space and how we generate that space and
how we continue to persist in that

7076
02:14:54,589 --> 02:14:54,599
how we continue to persist in that
 

7077
02:14:54,599 --> 02:14:58,270
how we continue to persist in that
space is there shortcuts we can take to

7078
02:14:58,270 --> 02:14:58,280
space is there shortcuts we can take to
 

7079
02:14:58,280 --> 02:15:01,069
space is there shortcuts we can take to

Consciousness artificial intelligence so

7084
02:15:07,549 --> 02:15:07,559
Consciousness artificial intelligence so
 

7085
02:15:07,559 --> 02:15:10,149
Consciousness artificial intelligence so
maybe just looking

7086
02:15:10,149 --> 02:15:10,159
maybe just looking
 

7087
02:15:10,159 --> 02:15:14,310
maybe just looking
pragmatically at the uh llms we have

7088
02:15:14,310 --> 02:15:14,320
pragmatically at the uh llms we have
 

7089
02:15:14,320 --> 02:15:16,790
pragmatically at the uh llms we have
now do you think those can

7090
02:15:16,790 --> 02:15:16,800
now do you think those can
 

7091
02:15:16,800 --> 02:15:19,950
now do you think those can
exhibit qualities of Life qualities of

7092
02:15:19,950 --> 02:15:19,960
exhibit qualities of Life qualities of

02:15:19,960 --> 02:15:22,229
exhibit qualities of Life qualities of
consciousness qualities of intelligence

7094
02:15:22,229 --> 02:15:22,239
consciousness qualities of intelligence
 

7095
02:15:22,239 --> 02:15:24,270
consciousness qualities of intelligence
in the way we think of intelligence I

7096
02:15:24,270 --> 02:15:24,280
in the way we think of intelligence I
 

7097
02:15:24,280 --> 02:15:25,870
in the way we think of intelligence I
mean I think they already do but not in

7098
02:15:25,870 --> 02:15:25,880
mean I think they already do but not in
 

7099
02:15:25,880 --> 02:15:27,950
mean I think they already do but not in
the way I hear popularly discussed so

7100
02:15:27,950 --> 02:15:27,960
the way I hear popularly discussed so
 

7101
02:15:27,960 --> 02:15:30,510
the way I hear popularly discussed so
they're obviously signatures of

7102
02:15:30,510 --> 02:15:30,520
they're obviously signatures of
 

7103
02:15:30,520 --> 02:15:32,870
they're obviously signatures of
intelligence and

7104
02:15:32,870 --> 02:15:32,880
intelligence and
 

7105
02:15:32,880 --> 02:15:36,990
intelligence and
um and and a part of a ecosystem of

7106
02:15:36,990 --> 02:15:37,000
um and and a part of a ecosystem of
 

7107
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,030
um and and a part of a ecosystem of
intelligent systems but I don't know

7108
02:15:39,030 --> 02:15:39,040
intelligent systems but I don't know
 

7109
02:15:39,040 --> 02:15:40,229
intelligent systems but I don't know
that

7110
02:15:40,229 --> 02:15:40,239
that
 

7111
02:15:40,239 --> 02:15:42,270
that
individually uh you know I would assign

7112
02:15:42,270 --> 02:15:42,280
individually uh you know I would assign
 

7113
02:15:42,280 --> 02:15:44,589
individually uh you know I would assign
all the properties to them that people

7114
02:15:44,589 --> 02:15:44,599
all the properties to them that people
 

7115
02:15:44,599 --> 02:15:47,109
all the properties to them that people
have it's a little like uh so you know

7116
02:15:47,109 --> 02:15:47,119
have it's a little like uh so you know
 

7117
02:15:47,119 --> 02:15:48,510
have it's a little like uh so you know
we talked about the history of eyes

7118
02:15:48,510 --> 02:15:48,520
we talked about the history of eyes
 

7119
02:15:48,520 --> 02:15:51,030
we talked about the history of eyes
before and like how eyes scaled up into

7120
02:15:51,030 --> 02:15:51,040
before and like how eyes scaled up into
 

7121
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:53,510
before and like how eyes scaled up into
technological forms and language has

7122
02:15:53,510 --> 02:15:53,520
technological forms and language has
 

7123
02:15:53,520 --> 02:15:55,669
technological forms and language has
also had a really interesting history

7124
02:15:55,669 --> 02:15:55,679
also had a really interesting history
 

7125
02:15:55,679 --> 02:15:57,510
also had a really interesting history
and got much more interesting I think

7126
02:15:57,510 --> 02:15:57,520
and got much more interesting I think
 

7127
02:15:57,520 --> 02:16:00,189
and got much more interesting I think
once we started writing it down um and

7128
02:16:00,189 --> 02:16:00,199
once we started writing it down um and
 

7129
02:16:00,199 --> 02:16:02,149
once we started writing it down um and
then you know in inventing books and

7130
02:16:02,149 --> 02:16:02,159
then you know in inventing books and
 

7131
02:16:02,159 --> 02:16:03,950
then you know in inventing books and
things but like you know every time that

7132
02:16:03,950 --> 02:16:03,960
things but like you know every time that
 

7133
02:16:03,960 --> 02:16:07,750
things but like you know every time that
we started uh storing language in a new

7134
02:16:07,750 --> 02:16:07,760
we started uh storing language in a new
 

7135
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:10,229
we started uh storing language in a new
way uh you know we were kind of EX

7136
02:16:10,229 --> 02:16:10,239
way uh you know we were kind of EX
 

7137
02:16:10,239 --> 02:16:12,390
way uh you know we were kind of EX
existentially traumatized by it so like

7138
02:16:12,390 --> 02:16:12,400
existentially traumatized by it so like
 

7139
02:16:12,400 --> 02:16:13,910
existentially traumatized by it so like
you know the idea of written language

7140
02:16:13,910 --> 02:16:13,920
you know the idea of written language
 

7141
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:15,669
you know the idea of written language
was traumatic because it seemed like the

7142
02:16:15,669 --> 02:16:15,679
was traumatic because it seemed like the
 

7143
02:16:15,679 --> 02:16:17,629
was traumatic because it seemed like the
dead were speaking to us even though

7144
02:16:17,629 --> 02:16:17,639
dead were speaking to us even though
 

7145
02:16:17,639 --> 02:16:18,990
dead were speaking to us even though
they were deceased and books were

7146
02:16:18,990 --> 02:16:19,000
they were deceased and books were
 

7147
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,790
they were deceased and books were
traumatic because um you know like

7148
02:16:21,790 --> 02:16:21,800
traumatic because um you know like
 

7149
02:16:21,800 --> 02:16:23,830
traumatic because um you know like
suddenly there were lots of copies of

7150
02:16:23,830 --> 02:16:23,840
suddenly there were lots of copies of
 

7151
02:16:23,840 --> 02:16:25,510
suddenly there were lots of copies of
this information available to everyone

7152
02:16:25,510 --> 02:16:25,520
this information available to everyone
 

7153
02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:27,189
this information available to everyone
and it was going to somehow dilute

7154
02:16:27,189 --> 02:16:27,199
and it was going to somehow dilute
 

7155
02:16:27,199 --> 02:16:29,990
and it was going to somehow dilute
dilute it and large language models are

7156
02:16:29,990 --> 02:16:30,000
dilute it and large language models are
 

7157
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:31,549
dilute it and large language models are
kind of interesting because they don't

7158
02:16:31,549 --> 02:16:31,559
kind of interesting because they don't
 

7159
02:16:31,559 --> 02:16:33,990
kind of interesting because they don't
feel as static they're very Dynamic but

7160
02:16:33,990 --> 02:16:34,000
feel as static they're very Dynamic but
 

7161
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:35,709
feel as static they're very Dynamic but
if you think about language in the way I

7162
02:16:35,709 --> 02:16:35,719
if you think about language in the way I
 

7163
02:16:35,719 --> 02:16:37,270
if you think about language in the way I
was describing before as language is

7164
02:16:37,270 --> 02:16:37,280
was describing before as language is
 

7165
02:16:37,280 --> 02:16:39,709
was describing before as language is
this very large in time structure and

7166
02:16:39,709 --> 02:16:39,719
this very large in time structure and
 

7167
02:16:39,719 --> 02:16:41,669
this very large in time structure and
before it had been something that was

7168
02:16:41,669 --> 02:16:41,679
before it had been something that was
 

7169
02:16:41,679 --> 02:16:44,230
before it had been something that was
distributed over human brains as a

7170
02:16:44,230 --> 02:16:44,240
distributed over human brains as a
 

7171
02:16:44,240 --> 02:16:46,509
distributed over human brains as a
dynamic structure and occasionally we

7172
02:16:46,509 --> 02:16:46,519
dynamic structure and occasionally we
 

7173
02:16:46,519 --> 02:16:49,349
dynamic structure and occasionally we
store components of that very large

7174
02:16:49,349 --> 02:16:49,359
store components of that very large
 

7175
02:16:49,359 --> 02:16:51,910
store components of that very large
dynamic structure in books or in written

7176
02:16:51,910 --> 02:16:51,920
dynamic structure in books or in written
 

7177
02:16:51,920 --> 02:16:54,589
dynamic structure in books or in written
language now we can actually store the

7178
02:16:54,589 --> 02:16:54,599
language now we can actually store the
 

7179
02:16:54,599 --> 02:16:57,230
language now we can actually store the
Dynamics of that structure in a physical

7180
02:16:57,230 --> 02:16:57,240
Dynamics of that structure in a physical
 

7181
02:16:57,240 --> 02:17:00,110
Dynamics of that structure in a physical
artifact which is a large language model

7182
02:17:00,110 --> 02:17:00,120
artifact which is a large language model
 

7183
02:17:00,120 --> 02:17:02,349
artifact which is a large language model
um and so I think about it almost like

7184
02:17:02,349 --> 02:17:02,359
um and so I think about it almost like
 

7185
02:17:02,359 --> 02:17:04,669
um and so I think about it almost like
the evolution of genomes in some sense

7186
02:17:04,669 --> 02:17:04,679
the evolution of genomes in some sense
 

7187
02:17:04,679 --> 02:17:05,950
the evolution of genomes in some sense
where you know there might have been

7188
02:17:05,950 --> 02:17:05,960
where you know there might have been
 

7189
02:17:05,960 --> 02:17:07,589
where you know there might have been
like really primitive genes in the first

7190
02:17:07,589 --> 02:17:07,599
like really primitive genes in the first
 

7191
02:17:07,599 --> 02:17:08,950
like really primitive genes in the first
living things and they could they didn't

7192
02:17:08,950 --> 02:17:08,960
living things and they could they didn't
 

7193
02:17:08,960 --> 02:17:10,549
living things and they could they didn't
store a lot of information or they were

7194
02:17:10,549 --> 02:17:10,559
store a lot of information or they were
 

7195
02:17:10,559 --> 02:17:12,750
store a lot of information or they were
like really messy um and then we you

7196
02:17:12,750 --> 02:17:12,760
like really messy um and then we you
 

7197
02:17:12,760 --> 02:17:13,830
like really messy um and then we you
know like you by the time you get to the

7198
02:17:13,830 --> 02:17:13,840
know like you by the time you get to the
 

7199
02:17:13,840 --> 02:17:15,669
know like you by the time you get to the
ukar cell you have this really Dynamic

7200
02:17:15,669 --> 02:17:15,679
ukar cell you have this really Dynamic
 

7201
02:17:15,679 --> 02:17:17,990
ukar cell you have this really Dynamic
genetic architecture that's rewritable

7202
02:17:17,990 --> 02:17:18,000
genetic architecture that's rewritable
 

7203
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:19,549
genetic architecture that's rewritable
right and like and has all of these

7204
02:17:19,549 --> 02:17:19,559
right and like and has all of these
 

7205
02:17:19,559 --> 02:17:21,389
right and like and has all of these
different properties and

7206
02:17:21,389 --> 02:17:21,399
different properties and
 

7207
02:17:21,399 --> 02:17:22,950
different properties and
I think large language models are kind

7208
02:17:22,950 --> 02:17:22,960
I think large language models are kind
 

7209
02:17:22,960 --> 02:17:25,750
I think large language models are kind
of like the genetic system for language

7210
02:17:25,750 --> 02:17:25,760
of like the genetic system for language
 

7211
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:28,910
of like the genetic system for language
um in some sense where it's it's

7212
02:17:28,910 --> 02:17:28,920
um in some sense where it's it's
 

7213
02:17:28,920 --> 02:17:31,349
um in some sense where it's it's
allowing and a sort of archiving that's

7214
02:17:31,349 --> 02:17:31,359
allowing and a sort of archiving that's
 

7215
02:17:31,359 --> 02:17:33,870
allowing and a sort of archiving that's
highly Dynamic um and I think it's very

7216
02:17:33,870 --> 02:17:33,880
highly Dynamic um and I think it's very
 

7217
02:17:33,880 --> 02:17:36,349
highly Dynamic um and I think it's very
paradoxical to us because obviously in

7218
02:17:36,349 --> 02:17:36,359
paradoxical to us because obviously in
 

7219
02:17:36,359 --> 02:17:38,389
paradoxical to us because obviously in
human history we haven't been used to

7220
02:17:38,389 --> 02:17:38,399
human history we haven't been used to
 

7221
02:17:38,399 --> 02:17:40,150
human history we haven't been used to
conversing with anything that's not

7222
02:17:40,150 --> 02:17:40,160
conversing with anything that's not
 

7223
02:17:40,160 --> 02:17:45,030
conversing with anything that's not
human um but now we can converse uh

7224
02:17:45,030 --> 02:17:45,040
human um but now we can converse uh
 

7225
02:17:45,040 --> 02:17:47,629
human um but now we can converse uh
basically with a crystallization of

7226
02:17:47,629 --> 02:17:47,639
basically with a crystallization of
 

7227
02:17:47,639 --> 02:17:51,110
basically with a crystallization of
human language in a computer uh that's a

7228
02:17:51,110 --> 02:17:51,120
human language in a computer uh that's a
 

7229
02:17:51,120 --> 02:17:52,830
human language in a computer uh that's a
highly Dynamic Crystal because it's a

7230
02:17:52,830 --> 02:17:52,840
highly Dynamic Crystal because it's a
 

7231
02:17:52,840 --> 02:17:55,469
highly Dynamic Crystal because it's a
crystallization in time of this massive

7232
02:17:55,469 --> 02:17:55,479
crystallization in time of this massive
 

7233
02:17:55,479 --> 02:17:57,230
crystallization in time of this massive
abstract structure that's evolved over

7234
02:17:57,230 --> 02:17:57,240
abstract structure that's evolved over
 

7235
02:17:57,240 --> 02:18:00,070
abstract structure that's evolved over
human history and is now put into a

7236
02:18:00,070 --> 02:18:00,080
human history and is now put into a
 

7237
02:18:00,080 --> 02:18:02,469
human history and is now put into a
small device I think crystallization

7238
02:18:02,469 --> 02:18:02,479
small device I think crystallization
 

7239
02:18:02,479 --> 02:18:06,549
small device I think crystallization
kind of implies that a limit on its

7240
02:18:06,549 --> 02:18:06,559
kind of implies that a limit on its
 

7241
02:18:06,559 --> 02:18:09,190
kind of implies that a limit on its
capabilities I think there's not uh I

7242
02:18:09,190 --> 02:18:09,200
capabilities I think there's not uh I
 

7243
02:18:09,200 --> 02:18:11,150
capabilities I think there's not uh I
mean it very purposefully because a

7244
02:18:11,150 --> 02:18:11,160
mean it very purposefully because a
 

7245
02:18:11,160 --> 02:18:12,709
mean it very purposefully because a
particular instantiation of a language

7246
02:18:12,709 --> 02:18:12,719
particular instantiation of a language
 

7247
02:18:12,719 --> 02:18:14,870
particular instantiation of a language
model trained on a particular data set

7248
02:18:14,870 --> 02:18:14,880
model trained on a particular data set
 

7249
02:18:14,880 --> 02:18:16,469
model trained on a particular data set
becomes a crystal of the language at

7250
02:18:16,469 --> 02:18:16,479
becomes a crystal of the language at
 

7251
02:18:16,479 --> 02:18:17,870
becomes a crystal of the language at
that time it was trained but obviously

7252
02:18:17,870 --> 02:18:17,880
that time it was trained but obviously
 

7253
02:18:17,880 --> 02:18:19,429
that time it was trained but obviously
we're iterating with the technology and

7254
02:18:19,429 --> 02:18:19,439
we're iterating with the technology and
 

7255
02:18:19,439 --> 02:18:22,270
we're iterating with the technology and
evolving it I guess question is when you

7256
02:18:22,270 --> 02:18:22,280
evolving it I guess question is when you
 

7257
02:18:22,280 --> 02:18:23,950
evolving it I guess question is when you
crystallize it when you compress it when

7258
02:18:23,950 --> 02:18:23,960
crystallize it when you compress it when
 

7259
02:18:23,960 --> 02:18:26,429
crystallize it when you compress it when
you archive it you're

7260
02:18:26,429 --> 02:18:26,439
you archive it you're
 

7261
02:18:26,439 --> 02:18:29,509
you archive it you're
archiving some slice of the collective

7262
02:18:29,509 --> 02:18:29,519
archiving some slice of the collective
 

7263
02:18:29,519 --> 02:18:31,629
archiving some slice of the collective
intelligence of the human species that's

7264
02:18:31,629 --> 02:18:31,639
intelligence of the human species that's
 

7265
02:18:31,639 --> 02:18:34,669
intelligence of the human species that's
right and the question is like how

7266
02:18:34,669 --> 02:18:34,679
right and the question is like how
 

7267
02:18:34,679 --> 02:18:37,150
right and the question is like how
powerful is that right it's a societal

7268
02:18:37,150 --> 02:18:37,160
powerful is that right it's a societal
 

7269
02:18:37,160 --> 02:18:38,910
powerful is that right it's a societal
level technology right we've actually

7270
02:18:38,910 --> 02:18:38,920
level technology right we've actually
 

7271
02:18:38,920 --> 02:18:40,790
level technology right we've actually
put collective intelligence in a box

7272
02:18:40,790 --> 02:18:40,800
put collective intelligence in a box
 

7273
02:18:40,800 --> 02:18:43,629
put collective intelligence in a box
yeah I mean how much smarter is the

7274
02:18:43,629 --> 02:18:43,639
yeah I mean how much smarter is the
 

7275
02:18:43,639 --> 02:18:46,070
yeah I mean how much smarter is the
collective intelligence of humans versus

7276
02:18:46,070 --> 02:18:46,080
collective intelligence of humans versus
 

7277
02:18:46,080 --> 02:18:49,910
collective intelligence of humans versus
a single human and that's that's the

7278
02:18:49,910 --> 02:18:49,920
a single human and that's that's the
 

7279
02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:51,309
a single human and that's that's the
question of AGI

7280
02:18:51,309 --> 02:18:51,319
question of AGI
 

7281
02:18:51,319 --> 02:18:53,950
question of AGI
versus uh human level intelligence

7282
02:18:53,950 --> 02:18:53,960
versus uh human level intelligence
 

7283
02:18:53,960 --> 02:18:55,709
versus uh human level intelligence
superhuman level intelligence versus

7284
02:18:55,709 --> 02:18:55,719
superhuman level intelligence versus
 

7285
02:18:55,719 --> 02:18:58,150
superhuman level intelligence versus
human level intelligence like how much

7286
02:18:58,150 --> 02:18:58,160
human level intelligence like how much
 

7287
02:18:58,160 --> 02:19:00,190
human level intelligence like how much
smarter can this thing when done well

7288
02:19:00,190 --> 02:19:00,200
smarter can this thing when done well
 

7289
02:19:00,200 --> 02:19:03,509
smarter can this thing when done well
when we solve a lot of the uh complexity

7290
02:19:03,509 --> 02:19:03,519
when we solve a lot of the uh complexity
 

7291
02:19:03,519 --> 02:19:05,230
when we solve a lot of the uh complexity
computation complexities maybe there's

7292
02:19:05,230 --> 02:19:05,240
computation complexities maybe there's
 

7293
02:19:05,240 --> 02:19:08,469
computation complexities maybe there's
some data complexities and how to really

7294
02:19:08,469 --> 02:19:08,479
some data complexities and how to really
 

7295
02:19:08,479 --> 02:19:10,110
some data complexities and how to really
archive this thing crystallize this

7296
02:19:10,110 --> 02:19:10,120
archive this thing crystallize this
 

7297
02:19:10,120 --> 02:19:12,469
archive this thing crystallize this
thing really well yeah how powerful is

7298
02:19:12,469 --> 02:19:12,479
thing really well yeah how powerful is
 

7299
02:19:12,479 --> 02:19:13,950
thing really well yeah how powerful is
this thing going to be like what's your

7300
02:19:13,950 --> 02:19:13,960
this thing going to be like what's your
 

7301
02:19:13,960 --> 02:19:17,790
this thing going to be like what's your
I I think I I actually I don't like the

7302
02:19:17,790 --> 02:19:17,800
I I think I I actually I don't like the
 

7303
02:19:17,800 --> 02:19:19,870
I I think I I actually I don't like the
sort of language we use around that and

7304
02:19:19,870 --> 02:19:19,880
sort of language we use around that and
 

7305
02:19:19,880 --> 02:19:22,389
sort of language we use around that and
I think the language really matters um

7306
02:19:22,389 --> 02:19:22,399
I think the language really matters um
 

7307
02:19:22,399 --> 02:19:24,110
I think the language really matters um
so I don't know how to talk about how

7308
02:19:24,110 --> 02:19:24,120
so I don't know how to talk about how
 

7309
02:19:24,120 --> 02:19:27,070
so I don't know how to talk about how
much smarter one human is than another

7310
02:19:27,070 --> 02:19:27,080
much smarter one human is than another
 

7311
02:19:27,080 --> 02:19:29,509
much smarter one human is than another
right like usually we talk

7312
02:19:29,509 --> 02:19:29,519
right like usually we talk
 

7313
02:19:29,519 --> 02:19:33,629
right like usually we talk
about abilities or particular talents

7314
02:19:33,629 --> 02:19:33,639
about abilities or particular talents
 

7315
02:19:33,639 --> 02:19:38,270
about abilities or particular talents
someone has um and you know going back

7316
02:19:38,270 --> 02:19:38,280
someone has um and you know going back
 

7317
02:19:38,280 --> 02:19:40,469
someone has um and you know going back
to you know David D's idea of universal

7318
02:19:40,469 --> 02:19:40,479
to you know David D's idea of universal
 

7319
02:19:40,479 --> 02:19:42,910
to you know David D's idea of universal
explainers it like you know adopting The

7320
02:19:42,910 --> 02:19:42,920
explainers it like you know adopting The
 

7321
02:19:42,920 --> 02:19:46,429
explainers it like you know adopting The
View that uh you know we're the first

7322
02:19:46,429 --> 02:19:46,439
View that uh you know we're the first
 

7323
02:19:46,439 --> 02:19:47,830
View that uh you know we're the first
you know kinds of structures our

7324
02:19:47,830 --> 02:19:47,840
you know kinds of structures our
 

7325
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:50,710
you know kinds of structures our
biosphere has built that can understand

7326
02:19:50,710 --> 02:19:50,720
biosphere has built that can understand
 

7327
02:19:50,720 --> 02:19:52,230
biosphere has built that can understand
the rest of reality we have this

7328
02:19:52,230 --> 02:19:52,240
the rest of reality we have this
 

7329
02:19:52,240 --> 02:19:55,590
the rest of reality we have this
Universal comprehension capability um

7330
02:19:55,590 --> 02:19:55,600
Universal comprehension capability um
 

7331
02:19:55,600 --> 02:19:58,469
Universal comprehension capability um
you know he makes an argument that uh

7332
02:19:58,469 --> 02:19:58,479
you know he makes an argument that uh
 

7333
02:19:58,479 --> 02:20:00,389
you know he makes an argument that uh
basically we're the first things that

7334
02:20:00,389 --> 02:20:00,399
basically we're the first things that
 

7335
02:20:00,399 --> 02:20:01,990
basically we're the first things that
actually are capable of understanding

7336
02:20:01,990 --> 02:20:02,000
actually are capable of understanding
 

7337
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:03,510
actually are capable of understanding
anything it doesn't matter it doesn't

7338
02:20:03,510 --> 02:20:03,520
anything it doesn't matter it doesn't
 

7339
02:20:03,520 --> 02:20:05,389
anything it doesn't matter it doesn't
mean an individual understands

7340
02:20:05,389 --> 02:20:05,399
mean an individual understands
 

7341
02:20:05,399 --> 02:20:06,910
mean an individual understands
everything but like we have that

7342
02:20:06,910 --> 02:20:06,920
everything but like we have that
 

7343
02:20:06,920 --> 02:20:09,070
everything but like we have that
capability and so there's not a

7344
02:20:09,070 --> 02:20:09,080
capability and so there's not a
 

7345
02:20:09,080 --> 02:20:10,429
capability and so there's not a
difference between that and what people

7346
02:20:10,429 --> 02:20:10,439
difference between that and what people
 

7347
02:20:10,439 --> 02:20:13,670
difference between that and what people
talk about with AGI in some sense AGI is

7348
02:20:13,670 --> 02:20:13,680
talk about with AGI in some sense AGI is
 

7349
02:20:13,680 --> 02:20:16,590
talk about with AGI in some sense AGI is
a universal explainer but you know like

7350
02:20:16,590 --> 02:20:16,600
a universal explainer but you know like
 

7351
02:20:16,600 --> 02:20:19,190
a universal explainer but you know like
it might be that a computer is much more

7352
02:20:19,190 --> 02:20:19,200
it might be that a computer is much more
 

7353
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:22,309
it might be that a computer is much more
efficient at doing um you know uh I

7354
02:20:22,309 --> 02:20:22,319
efficient at doing um you know uh I
 

7355
02:20:22,319 --> 02:20:23,710
efficient at doing um you know uh I
don't know prime factorization or

7356
02:20:23,710 --> 02:20:23,720
don't know prime factorization or
 

7357
02:20:23,720 --> 02:20:26,670
don't know prime factorization or
something than a human is but it doesn't

7358
02:20:26,670 --> 02:20:26,680
something than a human is but it doesn't
 

7359
02:20:26,680 --> 02:20:28,790
something than a human is but it doesn't
mean that it's

7360
02:20:28,790 --> 02:20:28,800
mean that it's
 

7361
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:31,510
mean that it's
necessarily smarter or has a broader

7362
02:20:31,510 --> 02:20:31,520
necessarily smarter or has a broader
 

7363
02:20:31,520 --> 02:20:33,270
necessarily smarter or has a broader
reach of the kind of things that can

7364
02:20:33,270 --> 02:20:33,280
reach of the kind of things that can
 

7365
02:20:33,280 --> 02:20:36,030
reach of the kind of things that can
understand than a human does and so I

7366
02:20:36,030 --> 02:20:36,040
understand than a human does and so I
 

7367
02:20:36,040 --> 02:20:38,070
understand than a human does and so I
think we really have to think about is

7368
02:20:38,070 --> 02:20:38,080
think we really have to think about is
 

7369
02:20:38,080 --> 02:20:40,750
think we really have to think about is
it a level shift or is it we're

7370
02:20:40,750 --> 02:20:40,760
it a level shift or is it we're
 

7371
02:20:40,760 --> 02:20:43,550
it a level shift or is it we're
enhancing certain kinds of capabilities

7372
02:20:43,550 --> 02:20:43,560
enhancing certain kinds of capabilities
 

7373
02:20:43,560 --> 02:20:45,349
enhancing certain kinds of capabilities
humans have in the same way that we can

7374
02:20:45,349 --> 02:20:45,359
humans have in the same way that we can
 

7375
02:20:45,359 --> 02:20:47,830
humans have in the same way that we can
enhanced eyesight by making telescopes

7376
02:20:47,830 --> 02:20:47,840
enhanced eyesight by making telescopes
 

7377
02:20:47,840 --> 02:20:49,670
enhanced eyesight by making telescopes
and microscopes are we enhancing

7378
02:20:49,670 --> 02:20:49,680
and microscopes are we enhancing
 

7379
02:20:49,680 --> 02:20:52,190
and microscopes are we enhancing
capabilities we have into Technologies

7380
02:20:52,190 --> 02:20:52,200
capabilities we have into Technologies
 

7381
02:20:52,200 --> 02:20:54,389
capabilities we have into Technologies
and the entire Global ecosystem is

7382
02:20:54,389 --> 02:20:54,399
and the entire Global ecosystem is
 

7383
02:20:54,399 --> 02:20:56,429

getting more intelligent or is it really

7384
02:20:56,429 --> 02:20:56,439
getting more intelligent or is it really
 

7385
02:20:56,439 --> 02:20:58,150
getting more intelligent or is it really
that we're building some super machine

7386
02:20:58,150 --> 02:20:58,160
that we're building some super machine
 

7387
02:20:58,160 --> 02:20:59,550
that we're building some super machine
in a box that's going to be smart and

7388
02:20:59,550 --> 02:20:59,560
in a box that's going to be smart and
 

7389
02:20:59,560 --> 02:21:01,429
in a box that's going to be smart and
kill everybody like I like that sounds

7390
02:21:01,429 --> 02:21:01,439
kill everybody like I like that sounds
 

7391
02:21:01,439 --> 02:21:02,950

like a scci like it's not it's not even

7392
02:21:02,950 --> 02:21:02,960
like a scci like it's not it's not even
 

7393

don't think it's actually accurate to

7398
02:21:07,750 --> 02:21:07,760
don't think it's actually accurate to
 

7399
02:21:07,760 --> 02:21:09,110
don't think it's actually accurate to
any of the Technologies we're building

7400
02:21:09,110 --> 02:21:09,120
any of the Technologies we're building
 

7401
02:21:09,120 --> 02:21:10,429
any of the Technologies we're building
or the way that we should be describing

7402
02:21:10,429 --> 02:21:10,439
or the way that we should be describing
 

7403
02:21:10,439 --> 02:21:11,469
or the way that we should be describing
them it's not even how we should be

7404
02:21:11,469 --> 02:21:11,479
them it's not even how we should be
 

7405
02:21:11,479 --> 02:21:14,190
them it's not even how we should be
describing ourselves so the benevolence

describing ourselves so the benevolence
 

7407
02:21:14,200 --> 02:21:16,309

story is there's a benevolent system

7408
02:21:16,309 --> 02:21:16,319
story is there's a benevolent system
 

7409
02:21:16,319 --> 02:21:19,389

questions right I don't think they're
 

7417
02:21:28,280 --> 02:21:30,389
questions right I don't think they're
necessarily questions that we're going

02:21:34,630 --> 02:21:34,640
intelligence I think what is happening
 

7423
02:21:34,640 --> 02:21:36,550
intelligence I think what is happening
and will continue to happen is there's a

7424
02:21:36,550 --> 02:21:36,560
and will continue to happen is there's a
 

7425
02:21:36,560 --> 02:21:39,389
and will continue to happen is there's a
co-evolution between humans and

7426
02:21:39,389 --> 02:21:39,399
co-evolution between humans and
 

7427
02:21:39,399 --> 02:21:42,429
co-evolution between humans and

and we're maintaining a lot of the
 

7433
02:21:46,160 --> 02:21:48,830
and we're maintaining a lot of the

balance and for the balance to shift to
the technology would require some very

7436
02:21:50,870 --> 02:21:50,880
the technology would require some very
 

7437
02:21:50,880 --> 02:21:54,349
the technology would require some very
bad human actors which is a real risk or

7438
02:21:54,349 --> 02:21:54,359
bad human actors which is a real risk or
 

7439
02:21:54,359 --> 02:21:56,510
bad human actors which is a real risk or
some sort

7440
02:21:56,510 --> 02:21:56,520
some sort
 

7441
02:21:56,520 --> 02:21:58,790
some sort
of

7442
02:21:58,790 --> 02:21:58,800
of
 

7443
02:21:58,800 --> 02:22:01,670
of
um I don't know some sort of dynamic

7444
02:22:01,670 --> 02:22:01,680
um I don't know some sort of dynamic
 

7445
02:22:01,680 --> 02:22:02,550
um I don't know some sort of dynamic
that

7446
02:22:02,550 --> 02:22:02,560
that
 

7447
02:22:02,560 --> 02:22:05,110
that
favors like I I just don't know how that

7448
02:22:05,110 --> 02:22:05,120
favors like I I just don't know how that
 

7449
02:22:05,120 --> 02:22:07,510
favors like I I just don't know how that
plays out without human agency actually

7450
02:22:07,510 --> 02:22:07,520
plays out without human agency actually
 

7451
02:22:07,520 --> 02:22:09,670
plays out without human agency actually
trying to put it in that direction it

7452
02:22:09,670 --> 02:22:09,680
trying to put it in that direction it
 

7453
02:22:09,680 --> 02:22:12,429
trying to put it in that direction it
could also be how rapid the rate the

7454
02:22:12,429 --> 02:22:12,439
could also be how rapid the rate the
 

7455
02:22:12,439 --> 02:22:14,469
could also be how rapid the rate the
rapid rate is scary so like I think the

7456
02:22:14,469 --> 02:22:14,479
rapid rate is scary so like I think the
 

7457
02:22:14,479 --> 02:22:17,870
rapid rate is scary so like I think the
things that are you know terrifying are

7458
02:22:17,870 --> 02:22:17,880
things that are you know terrifying are
 

7459
02:22:17,880 --> 02:22:21,110
things that are you know terrifying are
um you know the ideas of deep fakes or

7460
02:22:21,110 --> 02:22:21,120
um you know the ideas of deep fakes or
 

7461
02:22:21,120 --> 02:22:23,910
um you know the ideas of deep fakes or
um you know like you know all the the

7462
02:22:23,910 --> 02:22:23,920
um you know like you know all the the
 

7463
02:22:23,920 --> 02:22:26,550
um you know like you know all the the
kinds of issues that become legal issues

7464
02:22:26,550 --> 02:22:26,560
kinds of issues that become legal issues
 

7465
02:22:26,560 --> 02:22:28,830
kinds of issues that become legal issues
about artificial intelligence

7466

02:22:58,550 --> 02:22:58,560
need to be built and that needs to
 

7493
02:22:58,560 --> 02:23:00,510
need to be built and that needs to
happen and I think one function of sort

7494
02:23:00,510 --> 02:23:00,520
happen and I think one function of sort
 

7495
02:23:00,520 --> 02:23:05,190
happen and I think one function of sort
of the artificial intelligence uh

7496
02:23:05,190 --> 02:23:05,200
of the artificial intelligence uh
 

7497
02:23:05,200 --> 02:23:08,469
of the artificial intelligence uh
doomsday uh sort of part of our culture

7498
02:23:08,469 --> 02:23:08,479
doomsday uh sort of part of our culture
 

7499
02:23:08,479 --> 02:23:10,590
doomsday uh sort of part of our culture
right now is it's sort of our immune

7500
02:23:10,590 --> 02:23:10,600
right now is it's sort of our immune
 

7501
02:23:10,600 --> 02:23:13,830
right now is it's sort of our immune
response to knowing that's coming um and

7502
02:23:13,830 --> 02:23:13,840
response to knowing that's coming um and
 

7503
02:23:13,840 --> 02:23:15,910
response to knowing that's coming um and
we're over scaring ourselves so we try

7504
02:23:15,910 --> 02:23:15,920
we're over scaring ourselves so we try
 

7505
02:23:15,920 --> 02:23:19,269
we're over scaring ourselves so we try
to act more quickly which is good um but

7506
02:23:19,269 --> 02:23:19,279
to act more quickly which is good um but
 

7507
02:23:19,279 --> 02:23:22,070
to act more quickly which is good um but
I I I just you know it's it's about the

7508
02:23:22,070 --> 02:23:22,080
I I I just you know it's it's about the
 

7509
02:23:22,080 --> 02:23:24,630
I I I just you know it's it's about the
words that we use versus the actual

7510
02:23:24,630 --> 02:23:24,640
words that we use versus the actual
 

7511
02:23:24,640 --> 02:23:26,510
words that we use versus the actual
things happening behind the words I

7512
02:23:26,510 --> 02:23:26,520
things happening behind the words I
 

7513
02:23:26,520 --> 02:23:28,030
things happening behind the words I
think one thing that's good is when

7514
02:23:28,030 --> 02:23:28,040
think one thing that's good is when
 

7515
02:23:28,040 --> 02:23:28,950
think one thing that's good is when
people are talking about things

7516
02:23:28,950 --> 02:23:28,960
people are talking about things
 

7517
02:23:28,960 --> 02:23:30,750
people are talking about things
different ways it makes us think about

7518
02:23:30,750 --> 02:23:30,760
different ways it makes us think about
 

7519
02:23:30,760 --> 02:23:32,750
different ways it makes us think about
them and also when things are

7520
02:23:32,750 --> 02:23:32,760
them and also when things are
 

7521
02:23:32,760 --> 02:23:35,429
them and also when things are
existentially threatening we want to pay

7522
02:23:35,429 --> 02:23:35,439
existentially threatening we want to pay
 

7523
02:23:35,439 --> 02:23:37,269
existentially threatening we want to pay
attention to those but the ways that

7524
02:23:37,269 --> 02:23:37,279
attention to those but the ways that
 

7525
02:23:37,279 --> 02:23:38,710
attention to those but the ways that
they're existentially threatening and

7526
02:23:38,710 --> 02:23:38,720
they're existentially threatening and
 

7527
02:23:38,720 --> 02:23:39,990
they're existentially threatening and
the ways that we're experiencing

7528
02:23:39,990 --> 02:23:40,000
the ways that we're experiencing
 

7529
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:41,630
the ways that we're experiencing
existential trauma I don't think that

7530
02:23:41,630 --> 02:23:41,640
existential trauma I don't think that
 

7531
02:23:41,640 --> 02:23:42,750
existential trauma I don't think that
we're really going to understand for

7532
02:23:42,750 --> 02:23:42,760
we're really going to understand for
 

7533
02:23:42,760 --> 02:23:46,030
we're really going to understand for
another Century or two if ever um and I

7534
02:23:46,030 --> 02:23:46,040
another Century or two if ever um and I
 

7535
02:23:46,040 --> 02:23:47,190
another Century or two if ever um and I
certainly think they're not the way that

7536
02:23:47,190 --> 02:23:47,200
certainly think they're not the way that
 

7537
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:48,870
certainly think they're not the way that
we're describing them

7538
02:23:48,870 --> 02:23:48,880
we're describing them
 

7539
02:23:48,880 --> 02:23:53,110
we're describing them
now well creating existential trauma is

7540
02:23:53,110 --> 02:23:53,120
now well creating existential trauma is
 

7541
02:23:53,120 --> 02:23:55,070
now well creating existential trauma is
one of the things that makes life fun I

7542
02:23:55,070 --> 02:23:55,080
one of the things that makes life fun I
 

7543
02:23:55,080 --> 02:23:56,750
one of the things that makes life fun I
guess yeah it's just what we do to

7544
02:23:56,750 --> 02:23:56,760
guess yeah it's just what we do to
 

7545
02:23:56,760 --> 02:23:59,550
guess yeah it's just what we do to
ourselves it gives us really exciting

7546
02:23:59,550 --> 02:23:59,560
ourselves it gives us really exciting
 

7547
02:23:59,560 --> 02:24:01,830
ourselves it gives us really exciting
big problems to solve yeah for sure do

7548
02:24:01,830 --> 02:24:01,840
big problems to solve yeah for sure do
 

7549
02:24:01,840 --> 02:24:05,670
big problems to solve yeah for sure do
you think we will see these AI systems

7550
02:24:05,670 --> 02:24:05,680
you think we will see these AI systems
 

7551
02:24:05,680 --> 02:24:08,230
you think we will see these AI systems
become conscious or convince us that

7552
02:24:08,230 --> 02:24:08,240
become conscious or convince us that
 

7553
02:24:08,240 --> 02:24:10,870
become conscious or convince us that
they're conscious and then maybe we'll

7554
02:24:10,870 --> 02:24:10,880
they're conscious and then maybe we'll
 

7555
02:24:10,880 --> 02:24:13,550
they're conscious and then maybe we'll
have relationships with them romantic

7556
02:24:13,550 --> 02:24:13,560
have relationships with them romantic
 

7557
02:24:13,560 --> 02:24:15,110
have relationships with them romantic
relationships well I think people are

7558
02:24:15,110 --> 02:24:15,120
relationships well I think people are
 

7559
02:24:15,120 --> 02:24:16,790
relationships well I think people are
going to have romantic relationships

7560
02:24:16,790 --> 02:24:16,800
going to have romantic relationships
 

7561
02:24:16,800 --> 02:24:19,510
going to have romantic relationships
with them and I also think that some

7562
02:24:19,510 --> 02:24:19,520
with them and I also think that some
 

7563
02:24:19,520 --> 02:24:20,830
with them and I also think that some
people would be convinced already that

7564
02:24:20,830 --> 02:24:20,840
people would be convinced already that
 

7565
02:24:20,840 --> 02:24:23,710
people would be convinced already that
they're conscious but I think in order

7566
02:24:23,710 --> 02:24:23,720
they're conscious but I think in order
 

7567
02:24:23,720 --> 02:24:26,590
they're conscious but I think in order
you know what does it take to convince

7568
02:24:26,590 --> 02:24:26,600
you know what does it take to convince
 

7569
02:24:26,600 --> 02:24:31,150
you know what does it take to convince
um convince people that something is

7570
02:24:31,150 --> 02:24:31,160
um convince people that something is
 

7571
02:24:31,160 --> 02:24:32,550
um convince people that something is
conscious I think that we actually have

7572
02:24:32,550 --> 02:24:32,560
conscious I think that we actually have
 

7573
02:24:32,560 --> 02:24:34,590
conscious I think that we actually have
to have an idea of what we're talking

7574
02:24:34,590 --> 02:24:34,600
to have an idea of what we're talking
 

7575
02:24:34,600 --> 02:24:36,510
to have an idea of what we're talking
about that it's like it's like we have

7576
02:24:36,510 --> 02:24:36,520
about that it's like it's like we have
 

7577
02:24:36,520 --> 02:24:38,750
about that it's like it's like we have
to have a theory that explains when

7578
02:24:38,750 --> 02:24:38,760
to have a theory that explains when
 

7579
02:24:38,760 --> 02:24:40,230
to have a theory that explains when
things are conscious or not that's

7580
02:24:40,230 --> 02:24:40,240
things are conscious or not that's
 

7581
02:24:40,240 --> 02:24:42,510
things are conscious or not that's
testable right and we don't have one

7582
02:24:42,510 --> 02:24:42,520
testable right and we don't have one
 

7583
02:24:42,520 --> 02:24:44,630
testable right and we don't have one
right now so I think until we we have

7584
02:24:44,630 --> 02:24:44,640
right now so I think until we we have
 

7585
02:24:44,640 --> 02:24:46,110
right now so I think until we we have
that it's always going to be this sort

7586
02:24:46,110 --> 02:24:46,120
that it's always going to be this sort
 

7587
02:24:46,120 --> 02:24:47,670
that it's always going to be this sort
of gray area where some people think it

7588
02:24:47,670 --> 02:24:47,680
of gray area where some people think it
 

7589
02:24:47,680 --> 02:24:49,349
of gray area where some people think it
hasn't and some people think it doesn't

7590
02:24:49,349 --> 02:24:49,359
hasn't and some people think it doesn't
 

7591
02:24:49,359 --> 02:24:50,630
hasn't and some people think it doesn't
because we don't actually know what

7592
02:24:50,630 --> 02:24:50,640
because we don't actually know what
 

7593
02:24:50,640 --> 02:24:52,429
because we don't actually know what
we're talking about that we think it has

7594
02:24:52,429 --> 02:24:52,439
we're talking about that we think it has
 

7595
02:24:52,439 --> 02:24:54,030
we're talking about that we think it has
so you think it's possible to get out of

7596
02:24:54,030 --> 02:24:54,040
so you think it's possible to get out of
 

7597
02:24:54,040 --> 02:24:56,150
so you think it's possible to get out of
the gray area and really have a formal

7598
02:24:56,150 --> 02:24:56,160
the gray area and really have a formal
 

7599
02:24:56,160 --> 02:24:58,630
the gray area and really have a formal
test for Consciousness for sure and and

7600
02:24:58,630 --> 02:24:58,640
test for Consciousness for sure and and
 

7601
02:24:58,640 --> 02:25:01,230
test for Consciousness for sure and and
for life as you were for sure as we've

7602
02:25:01,230 --> 02:25:01,240
for life as you were for sure as we've
 

7603
02:25:01,240 --> 02:25:03,190
for life as you were for sure as we've
been talking about for somebody

7604
02:25:03,190 --> 02:25:03,200
been talking about for somebody
 

7605
02:25:03,200 --> 02:25:05,269
been talking about for somebody
Consciousness is a tricky one it is a

7606
02:25:05,269 --> 02:25:05,279
Consciousness is a tricky one it is a
 

7607
02:25:05,279 --> 02:25:06,469
Consciousness is a tricky one it is a
tricky one I mean that's why it's called

7608
02:25:06,469 --> 02:25:06,479
tricky one I mean that's why it's called
 

7609
02:25:06,479 --> 02:25:08,190
tricky one I mean that's why it's called
the hard problem of Consciousness um

7610
02:25:08,190 --> 02:25:08,200
the hard problem of Consciousness um
 

7611
02:25:08,200 --> 02:25:10,670
the hard problem of Consciousness um
because it's hard and you know it might

7612
02:25:10,670 --> 02:25:10,680
because it's hard and you know it might
 

7613
02:25:10,680 --> 02:25:12,110
because it's hard and you know it might
even be outside of the purview of

7614
02:25:12,110 --> 02:25:12,120
even be outside of the purview of
 

7615
02:25:12,120 --> 02:25:13,750
even be outside of the purview of
science which means that we can't

7616
02:25:13,750 --> 02:25:13,760
science which means that we can't
 

7617
02:25:13,760 --> 02:25:15,510
science which means that we can't
understand it in a scientific way there

7618
02:25:15,510 --> 02:25:15,520
understand it in a scientific way there
 

7619
02:25:15,520 --> 02:25:16,870
understand it in a scientific way there
might be other ways of coming to

7620
02:25:16,870 --> 02:25:16,880
might be other ways of coming to
 

7621
02:25:16,880 --> 02:25:18,790
might be other ways of coming to
understand it but that those may not be

7622
02:25:18,790 --> 02:25:18,800
understand it but that those may not be
 

7623
02:25:18,800 --> 02:25:21,030
understand it but that those may not be
the ones that we necessarily want for

7624
02:25:21,030 --> 02:25:21,040
the ones that we necessarily want for
 

7625
02:25:21,040 --> 02:25:23,830
the ones that we necessarily want for
technological utility um or for

7626
02:25:23,830 --> 02:25:23,840
technological utility um or for
 

7627
02:25:23,840 --> 02:25:26,070
technological utility um or for
developing laws with respect to because

7628
02:25:26,070 --> 02:25:26,080
developing laws with respect to because
 

7629
02:25:26,080 --> 02:25:28,349
developing laws with respect to because
the laws are are you know the things

7630
02:25:28,349 --> 02:25:28,359
the laws are are you know the things
 

7631
02:25:28,359 --> 02:25:30,269
the laws are are you know the things
that are going to govern the technology

7632
02:25:30,269 --> 02:25:30,279
that are going to govern the technology
 

7633
02:25:30,279 --> 02:25:32,150
that are going to govern the technology
um well I think that's actually where

7634
02:25:32,150 --> 02:25:32,160
um well I think that's actually where
 

7635
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:35,790
um well I think that's actually where
the the hard problem of Consciousness a

7636
02:25:35,790 --> 02:25:35,800
the the hard problem of Consciousness a
 

7637
02:25:35,800 --> 02:25:37,630
the the hard problem of Consciousness a
different hard problem of Consciousness

7638
02:25:37,630 --> 02:25:37,640
different hard problem of Consciousness
 

7639
02:25:37,640 --> 02:25:38,950
different hard problem of Consciousness
is

7640
02:25:38,950 --> 02:25:38,960
is
 

7641
02:25:38,960 --> 02:25:43,269
is
that I fear that humans will

7642
02:25:43,269 --> 02:25:43,279
that I fear that humans will
 

7643
02:25:43,279 --> 02:25:45,550
that I fear that humans will
resist that's the last thing they will

7644
02:25:45,550 --> 02:25:45,560
resist that's the last thing they will
 

7645
02:25:45,560 --> 02:25:47,750
resist that's the last thing they will
resist is calling something else

7646
02:25:47,750 --> 02:25:47,760
resist is calling something else
 

7647

Consciousness Laden in a thing that was
 

7685
02:26:31,319 --> 02:26:33,790
Consciousness Laden in a thing that was
created by as humans and so what do you

7686
02:26:33,790 --> 02:26:33,800
created by as humans and so what do you
 

7687
02:26:33,800 --> 02:26:35,309
created by as humans and so what do you
think the risks are there that the

sense uh you know being alive requires
 

7711
02:27:01,600 --> 02:27:03,230
sense uh you know being alive requires
eating other things that are alive and

eating other things that are alive and
 

7713

still eating living things I yeah so

7718
02:27:09,469 --> 02:27:09,479
still eating living things I yeah so
 

7719
02:27:09,479 --> 02:27:11,469
still eating living things I yeah so
maybe part of the the story of Earth

7720
02:27:11,469 --> 02:27:11,479
maybe part of the the story of Earth
 

7721
02:27:11,479 --> 02:27:15,590
maybe part of the the story of Earth
will involve a predator pre dynamic

7722
02:27:15,590 --> 02:27:15,600
will involve a predator pre dynamic
 

7723
02:27:15,600 --> 02:27:18,990
will involve a predator pre dynamic
between humans that's Str forist

7724
02:27:18,990 --> 02:27:19,000
between humans that's Str forist
 

7725
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:20,990
between humans that's Str forist
Creations yeah

7726
02:27:20,990 --> 02:27:21,000
Creations yeah
 

7727
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:22,389
Creations yeah
that is part of the but I don't like

7728
02:27:22,389 --> 02:27:22,399
that is part of the but I don't like
 

7729
02:27:22,399 --> 02:27:24,349
that is part of the but I don't like
thinking about them as like our

7730
02:27:24,349 --> 02:27:24,359
thinking about them as like our
 

7731
02:27:24,359 --> 02:27:26,110
thinking about them as like our
Technologies as a separate species

7732
02:27:26,110 --> 02:27:26,120
Technologies as a separate species
 

7733
02:27:26,120 --> 02:27:27,550
Technologies as a separate species
because this again goes back to this

7734
02:27:27,550 --> 02:27:27,560
because this again goes back to this
 

7735
02:27:27,560 --> 02:27:31,070
because this again goes back to this
sort of levels of selection issue um and

7736
02:27:31,070 --> 02:27:31,080
sort of levels of selection issue um and
 

7737
02:27:31,080 --> 02:27:32,790
sort of levels of selection issue um and
you know if you think about humans

7738
02:27:32,790 --> 02:27:32,800
you know if you think about humans
 

7739
02:27:32,800 --> 02:27:35,150
you know if you think about humans
individually alive you miss the fact

7740
02:27:35,150 --> 02:27:35,160
individually alive you miss the fact
 

7741
02:27:35,160 --> 02:27:38,510
individually alive you miss the fact
that societies are also alive and so I

7742
02:27:38,510 --> 02:27:38,520
that societies are also alive and so I
 

7743
02:27:38,520 --> 02:27:42,510
that societies are also alive and so I
think about it much more in the sense of

7744
02:27:42,510 --> 02:27:42,520
think about it much more in the sense of
 

7745
02:27:42,520 --> 02:27:44,790
think about it much more in the sense of
I an ecosystem is not the right word but

7746
02:27:44,790 --> 02:27:44,800
I an ecosystem is not the right word but
 

7747
02:27:44,800 --> 02:27:46,030
I an ecosystem is not the right word but
we don't have the right words for these

7748
02:27:46,030 --> 02:27:46,040
we don't have the right words for these
 

7749
02:27:46,040 --> 02:27:48,349
we don't have the right words for these
things of like and this why I talk about

7750
02:27:48,349 --> 02:27:48,359
things of like and this why I talk about
 

7751
02:27:48,359 --> 02:27:50,750
things of like and this why I talk about
the technosphere it's a system that is

7752
02:27:50,750 --> 02:27:50,760
the technosphere it's a system that is
 

7753
02:27:50,760 --> 02:27:53,389
the technosphere it's a system that is
both human and technological it's not

7754
02:27:53,389 --> 02:27:53,399
both human and technological it's not
 

7755
02:27:53,399 --> 02:27:54,990
both human and technological it's not
human or

7756
02:27:54,990 --> 02:27:55,000
human or
 

7757
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:59,510
human or
technological um and so this is the part

7758
02:27:59,510 --> 02:27:59,520
technological um and so this is the part
 

7759
02:27:59,520 --> 02:28:02,389
technological um and so this is the part
that I think we're really good for the

7760
02:28:02,389 --> 02:28:02,399
that I think we're really good for the
 

7761
02:28:02,399 --> 02:28:04,349
that I think we're really good for the
like and this is driving in part A lot

7762
02:28:04,349 --> 02:28:04,359
like and this is driving in part A lot
 

7763
02:28:04,359 --> 02:28:07,030
like and this is driving in part A lot
of the sort of attitude of like I'll

7764
02:28:07,030 --> 02:28:07,040
of the sort of attitude of like I'll
 

7765
02:28:07,040 --> 02:28:10,590
of the sort of attitude of like I'll
kill you first with my nuclear weapons

7766
02:28:10,590 --> 02:28:10,600
kill you first with my nuclear weapons
 

7767
02:28:10,600 --> 02:28:12,630
kill you first with my nuclear weapons
um we're really good at identifying

7768
02:28:12,630 --> 02:28:12,640
um we're really good at identifying
 

7769
02:28:12,640 --> 02:28:15,110
um we're really good at identifying
things as other we're not really good at

7770
02:28:15,110 --> 02:28:15,120
things as other we're not really good at
 

7771
02:28:15,120 --> 02:28:16,830
things as other we're not really good at
understanding when we're the same or

7772
02:28:16,830 --> 02:28:16,840
understanding when we're the same or
 

7773
02:28:16,840 --> 02:28:18,389
understanding when we're the same or
when we're part of an integrated system

7774
02:28:18,389 --> 02:28:18,399
when we're part of an integrated system
 

7775
02:28:18,399 --> 02:28:19,790
when we're part of an integrated system
that's actually functioning together in

7776
02:28:19,790 --> 02:28:19,800
that's actually functioning together in
 

7777
02:28:19,800 --> 02:28:21,710
that's actually functioning together in
some kind kind of cohesive way so even

7778
02:28:21,710 --> 02:28:21,720
some kind kind of cohesive way so even
 

7779
02:28:21,720 --> 02:28:23,269
some kind kind of cohesive way so even
if you look at like you know the

7780
02:28:23,269 --> 02:28:23,279
if you look at like you know the
 

7781
02:28:23,279 --> 02:28:25,030
if you look at like you know the
division in American politics or

7782
02:28:25,030 --> 02:28:25,040
division in American politics or
 

7783
02:28:25,040 --> 02:28:26,670
division in American politics or
something for example it's important

7784
02:28:26,670 --> 02:28:26,680
something for example it's important
 

7785
02:28:26,680 --> 02:28:28,070
something for example it's important
that there's multiple sides that are

7786
02:28:28,070 --> 02:28:28,080
that there's multiple sides that are
 

7787
02:28:28,080 --> 02:28:29,550
that there's multiple sides that are
arguing with each other because that's

7788
02:28:29,550 --> 02:28:29,560
arguing with each other because that's
 

7789
02:28:29,560 --> 02:28:31,070
arguing with each other because that's
actually how you resolve society's

7790
02:28:31,070 --> 02:28:31,080
actually how you resolve society's
 

7791
02:28:31,080 --> 02:28:33,030
actually how you resolve society's
issues it's not like a bad feature I

7792
02:28:33,030 --> 02:28:33,040
issues it's not like a bad feature I
 

7793
02:28:33,040 --> 02:28:35,150
issues it's not like a bad feature I
think like some of the sort of extreme

7794
02:28:35,150 --> 02:28:35,160
think like some of the sort of extreme
 

7795
02:28:35,160 --> 02:28:36,510
think like some of the sort of extreme
positions and like the way people talk

7796
02:28:36,510 --> 02:28:36,520
positions and like the way people talk
 

7797
02:28:36,520 --> 02:28:40,750
positions and like the way people talk
about are maybe not ideal um but uh but

7798
02:28:40,750 --> 02:28:40,760
about are maybe not ideal um but uh but
 

7799
02:28:40,760 --> 02:28:42,870
about are maybe not ideal um but uh but
that's how societies solve problems what

7800
02:28:42,870 --> 02:28:42,880
that's how societies solve problems what
 

7801
02:28:42,880 --> 02:28:44,309
that's how societies solve problems what
it looks like for an individual is

7802
02:28:44,309 --> 02:28:44,319
it looks like for an individual is
 

7803
02:28:44,319 --> 02:28:45,870
it looks like for an individual is
really different than the societal level

7804
02:28:45,870 --> 02:28:45,880
really different than the societal level
 

7805
02:28:45,880 --> 02:28:48,830
really different than the societal level
outcomes and the fact that like there is

7806
02:28:48,830 --> 02:28:48,840
outcomes and the fact that like there is
 

7807
02:28:48,840 --> 02:28:50,469
outcomes and the fact that like there is
uh I don't want to call it cognition or

7808
02:28:50,469 --> 02:28:50,479
uh I don't want to call it cognition or
 

7809
02:28:50,479 --> 02:28:52,070
uh I don't want to call it cognition or
computation I don't know what you call

7810
02:28:52,070 --> 02:28:52,080
computation I don't know what you call
 

7811
02:28:52,080 --> 02:28:53,870
computation I don't know what you call
it but like there is a process playing

7812
02:28:53,870 --> 02:28:53,880
it but like there is a process playing
 

7813
02:28:53,880 --> 02:28:56,070
it but like there is a process playing
out in the Dynamics of societies that we

7814
02:28:56,070 --> 02:28:56,080
out in the Dynamics of societies that we
 

7815
02:28:56,080 --> 02:28:58,870
out in the Dynamics of societies that we
are all individual actors in and like

7816
02:28:58,870 --> 02:28:58,880
are all individual actors in and like
 

7817
02:28:58,880 --> 02:29:00,790
are all individual actors in and like
we're not part of that you know like it

7818
02:29:00,790 --> 02:29:00,800
we're not part of that you know like it
 

7819
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:02,750
we're not part of that you know like it
requires all of us acting individually

7820
02:29:02,750 --> 02:29:02,760
requires all of us acting individually
 

7821
02:29:02,760 --> 02:29:05,269
requires all of us acting individually
but like this higher level structure is

7822
02:29:05,269 --> 02:29:05,279
but like this higher level structure is
 

7823
02:29:05,279 --> 02:29:07,030
but like this higher level structure is
playing out some things and like things

7824
02:29:07,030 --> 02:29:07,040
playing out some things and like things
 

7825
02:29:07,040 --> 02:29:08,510
playing out some things and like things
are getting solved for it to be able to

7826
02:29:08,510 --> 02:29:08,520
are getting solved for it to be able to
 

7827
02:29:08,520 --> 02:29:11,710
are getting solved for it to be able to
maintain itself um and that's the level

7828
02:29:11,710 --> 02:29:11,720
maintain itself um and that's the level
 

7829
02:29:11,720 --> 02:29:13,469
maintain itself um and that's the level
that our Technologies live at they don't

7830
02:29:13,469 --> 02:29:13,479
that our Technologies live at they don't
 

7831
02:29:13,479 --> 02:29:15,030
that our Technologies live at they don't
live at our level they live at the

7832
02:29:15,030 --> 02:29:15,040
live at our level they live at the
 

7833
02:29:15,040 --> 02:29:16,429
live at our level they live at the
societal level and they're deeply

7834
02:29:16,429 --> 02:29:16,439
societal level and they're deeply
 

7835
02:29:16,439 --> 02:29:18,710
societal level and they're deeply
integrated with the social organism if

7836
02:29:18,710 --> 02:29:18,720
integrated with the social organism if
 

7837
02:29:18,720 --> 02:29:21,910
integrated with the social organism if
you want to call it that um and so I

7838
02:29:21,910 --> 02:29:21,920
you want to call it that um and so I
 

7839
02:29:21,920 --> 02:29:24,230
you want to call it that um and so I
really get upset when people talk about

7840
02:29:24,230 --> 02:29:24,240
really get upset when people talk about
 

7841
02:29:24,240 --> 02:29:26,990
really get upset when people talk about
the species of artificial intelligence

7842
02:29:26,990 --> 02:29:27,000
the species of artificial intelligence
 

7843
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:28,750
the species of artificial intelligence
I'm like you mean we live in an

7844
02:29:28,750 --> 02:29:28,760
I'm like you mean we live in an
 

7845
02:29:28,760 --> 02:29:30,070
I'm like you mean we live in an
ecosystem of all these kind of

7846
02:29:30,070 --> 02:29:30,080
ecosystem of all these kind of
 

7847
02:29:30,080 --> 02:29:31,750
ecosystem of all these kind of
intelligent things and these animating

7848
02:29:31,750 --> 02:29:31,760
intelligent things and these animating
 

7849
02:29:31,760 --> 02:29:34,550
intelligent things and these animating
technologies that were uh you know in

7850
02:29:34,550 --> 02:29:34,560
technologies that were uh you know in
 

7851
02:29:34,560 --> 02:29:36,710
technologies that were uh you know in
some sense helping to come alive we are

7852
02:29:36,710 --> 02:29:36,720
some sense helping to come alive we are
 

7853
02:29:36,720 --> 02:29:38,429
some sense helping to come alive we are
we are generating them but it's not like

7854
02:29:38,429 --> 02:29:38,439
we are generating them but it's not like
 

7855
02:29:38,439 --> 02:29:40,630
we are generating them but it's not like
the biosphere eliminated all of its past

7856
02:29:40,630 --> 02:29:40,640
the biosphere eliminated all of its past
 

7857
02:29:40,640 --> 02:29:42,870
the biosphere eliminated all of its past
history when it invented a new species

7858
02:29:42,870 --> 02:29:42,880
history when it invented a new species
 

7859
02:29:42,880 --> 02:29:44,950
history when it invented a new species
all of these things get scaffolded and

7860
02:29:44,950 --> 02:29:44,960
all of these things get scaffolded and
 

7861
02:29:44,960 --> 02:29:46,790
all of these things get scaffolded and
we're also augmenting ourselves at the

7862
02:29:46,790 --> 02:29:46,800
we're also augmenting ourselves at the
 

7863
02:29:46,800 --> 02:29:47,750
we're also augmenting ourselves at the
same time that we're building

7864
02:29:47,750 --> 02:29:47,760
same time that we're building
 

7865
02:29:47,760 --> 02:29:48,990
same time that we're building
Technologies I don't think we can

7866
02:29:48,990 --> 02:29:49,000
Technologies I don't think we can
 

7867
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:50,710
Technologies I don't think we can
anticipate what thatst is going to look

7868
02:29:50,710 --> 02:29:50,720
anticipate what thatst is going to look
 

7869
02:29:50,720 --> 02:29:52,590
anticipate what thatst is going to look
like so in some fundamental way you

7870
02:29:52,590 --> 02:29:52,600
like so in some fundamental way you
 

7871
02:29:52,600 --> 02:29:54,269
like so in some fundamental way you
always want to be thinking about the

7872
02:29:54,269 --> 02:29:54,279
always want to be thinking about the
 

7873
02:29:54,279 --> 02:29:56,710
always want to be thinking about the
planet as one organism the planet is one

7874
02:29:56,710 --> 02:29:56,720
planet as one organism the planet is one
 

7875
02:29:56,720 --> 02:29:58,670
planet as one organism the planet is one
living thing what happens when it

7876
02:29:58,670 --> 02:29:58,680
living thing what happens when it
 

7877
02:29:58,680 --> 02:30:01,550
living thing what happens when it
becomes multiplanetary is it still just

7878
02:30:01,550 --> 02:30:01,560
becomes multiplanetary is it still just
 

7879
02:30:01,560 --> 02:30:03,870
becomes multiplanetary is it still just
a still the same causal chain same

7880
02:30:03,870 --> 02:30:03,880
a still the same causal chain same
 

7881
02:30:03,880 --> 02:30:05,230
a still the same causal chain same
causal chain it's like when the first

7882
02:30:05,230 --> 02:30:05,240
causal chain it's like when the first
 

7883
02:30:05,240 --> 02:30:06,790
causal chain it's like when the first
cell split into two that's what I was

7884
02:30:06,790 --> 02:30:06,800
cell split into two that's what I was
 

7885
02:30:06,800 --> 02:30:08,269
cell split into two that's what I was
talking about when the when a planet

7886
02:30:08,269 --> 02:30:08,279
talking about when the when a planet
 

7887
02:30:08,279 --> 02:30:10,110
talking about when the when a planet
reproduces itself the technosphere

7888
02:30:10,110 --> 02:30:10,120
reproduces itself the technosphere
 

7889
02:30:10,120 --> 02:30:13,030
reproduces itself the technosphere
emerges enough understanding it's it's

7890
02:30:13,030 --> 02:30:13,040
emerges enough understanding it's it's
 

7891
02:30:13,040 --> 02:30:15,030
emerges enough understanding it's it's
it's like this recursive like the entire

7892
02:30:15,030 --> 02:30:15,040
it's like this recursive like the entire
 

7893
02:30:15,040 --> 02:30:17,190
it's like this recursive like the entire
history of life is just recursion right

7894
02:30:17,190 --> 02:30:17,200
history of life is just recursion right
 

7895
02:30:17,200 --> 02:30:19,190
history of life is just recursion right
so you have an original life event it

7896
02:30:19,190 --> 02:30:19,200
so you have an original life event it
 

7897
02:30:19,200 --> 02:30:20,910
so you have an original life event it
evolves for 4 billion years at least on

7898
02:30:20,910 --> 02:30:20,920
evolves for 4 billion years at least on
 

7899
02:30:20,920 --> 02:30:23,670
evolves for 4 billion years at least on
our planet it evolves a technosphere the

7900
02:30:23,670 --> 02:30:23,680
our planet it evolves a technosphere the
 

7901
02:30:23,680 --> 02:30:26,309
our planet it evolves a technosphere the
Technologies themselves start to

7902
02:30:26,309 --> 02:30:26,319
Technologies themselves start to
 

7903
02:30:26,319 --> 02:30:29,030
Technologies themselves start to
become having this property we call life

7904
02:30:29,030 --> 02:30:29,040
become having this property we call life
 

7905
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:31,070
become having this property we call life
which is the phase we're undergoing now

7906
02:30:31,070 --> 02:30:31,080
which is the phase we're undergoing now
 

7907
02:30:31,080 --> 02:30:34,469
which is the phase we're undergoing now
it solves the origin of itself and then

7908
02:30:34,469 --> 02:30:34,479
it solves the origin of itself and then
 

7909
02:30:34,479 --> 02:30:36,269
it solves the origin of itself and then
it figures out how that process all

7910
02:30:36,269 --> 02:30:36,279
it figures out how that process all
 

7911
02:30:36,279 --> 02:30:38,389
it figures out how that process all
works understands how to make more life

7912
02:30:38,389 --> 02:30:38,399
works understands how to make more life
 

7913
02:30:38,399 --> 02:30:39,990
works understands how to make more life
and then can copy itself onto another

7914
02:30:39,990 --> 02:30:40,000
and then can copy itself onto another
 

7915
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:41,230
and then can copy itself onto another
planet so the whole structure can

7916
02:30:41,230 --> 02:30:41,240
planet so the whole structure can
 

7917
02:30:41,240 --> 02:30:43,230
planet so the whole structure can
reproduce

7918
02:30:43,230 --> 02:30:43,240
reproduce
 

7919
02:30:43,240 --> 02:30:45,269
reproduce
itself and so the original life is

7920
02:30:45,269 --> 02:30:45,279
itself and so the original life is
 

7921
02:30:45,279 --> 02:30:47,910
itself and so the original life is
happening again right now on this planet

7922
02:30:47,910 --> 02:30:47,920
happening again right now on this planet
 

7923
02:30:47,920 --> 02:30:49,670
happening again right now on this planet
in the technosphere with the way that

7924
02:30:49,670 --> 02:30:49,680
in the technosphere with the way that
 

7925
02:30:49,680 --> 02:30:51,349
in the technosphere with the way that
our planet is undergoing another

7926
02:30:51,349 --> 02:30:51,359
our planet is undergoing another
 

7927
02:30:51,359 --> 02:30:52,910
our planet is undergoing another
transition just like at the original

7928
02:30:52,910 --> 02:30:52,920
transition just like at the original
 

7929
02:30:52,920 --> 02:30:54,990
transition just like at the original
life when geochemistry transitioned to

7930
02:30:54,990 --> 02:30:55,000
life when geochemistry transitioned to
 

7931
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:56,990
life when geochemistry transitioned to
biology which is the global for me it

7932
02:30:56,990 --> 02:30:57,000
biology which is the global for me it
 

7933
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:58,590
biology which is the global for me it
was a planetary scale transition it was

7934
02:30:58,590 --> 02:30:58,600
was a planetary scale transition it was
 

7935
02:30:58,600 --> 02:31:00,349
was a planetary scale transition it was
a multiscale thing that happened from

7936
02:31:00,349 --> 02:31:00,359
a multiscale thing that happened from
 

7937
02:31:00,359 --> 02:31:01,710
a multiscale thing that happened from
the scale of chemistry all the way to

7938
02:31:01,710 --> 02:31:01,720
the scale of chemistry all the way to
 

7939
02:31:01,720 --> 02:31:05,070
the scale of chemistry all the way to
Planetary Cycles um it's happening now

7940
02:31:05,070 --> 02:31:05,080
Planetary Cycles um it's happening now
 

7941
02:31:05,080 --> 02:31:07,830
Planetary Cycles um it's happening now
all the way from Individual humans to

7942
02:31:07,830 --> 02:31:07,840
all the way from Individual humans to
 

7943
02:31:07,840 --> 02:31:09,110
all the way from Individual humans to
the internet which is a global

7944
02:31:09,110 --> 02:31:09,120
the internet which is a global
 

7945
02:31:09,120 --> 02:31:11,110
the internet which is a global
technology and all the other things like

7946
02:31:11,110 --> 02:31:11,120
technology and all the other things like
 

7947
02:31:11,120 --> 02:31:12,550
technology and all the other things like
there's this multiscale process that's

7948
02:31:12,550 --> 02:31:12,560
there's this multiscale process that's
 

7949
02:31:12,560 --> 02:31:14,349
there's this multiscale process that's
happening and transitioning us globally

7950
02:31:14,349 --> 02:31:14,359
happening and transitioning us globally
 

7951
02:31:14,359 --> 02:31:15,990
happening and transitioning us globally
and it is really like it's a dramatic

7952
02:31:15,990 --> 02:31:16,000
and it is really like it's a dramatic
 

7953
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:19,070
and it is really like it's a dramatic
transition it's happening really fast um

7954
02:31:19,070 --> 02:31:19,080
transition it's happening really fast um
 

7955
02:31:19,080 --> 02:31:21,150
transition it's happening really fast um
and you we're living in it you think

7956
02:31:21,150 --> 02:31:21,160
and you we're living in it you think
 

7957
02:31:21,160 --> 02:31:22,750
and you we're living in it you think
this technosphere that we created this

7958
02:31:22,750 --> 02:31:22,760
this technosphere that we created this
 

7959
02:31:22,760 --> 02:31:24,630
this technosphere that we created this
increasingly complex technosphere will

7960
02:31:24,630 --> 02:31:24,640
increasingly complex technosphere will
 

7961
02:31:24,640 --> 02:31:27,910
increasingly complex technosphere will
spread to other planets it I hope so I

7962
02:31:27,910 --> 02:31:27,920
spread to other planets it I hope so I
 

7963
02:31:27,920 --> 02:31:29,590
spread to other planets it I hope so I
think so do you think we'll become a

7964
02:31:29,590 --> 02:31:29,600
think so do you think we'll become a
 

7965
02:31:29,600 --> 02:31:32,190
think so do you think we'll become a
type two kardashev civilization I don't

7966
02:31:32,190 --> 02:31:32,200
type two kardashev civilization I don't
 

7967
02:31:32,200 --> 02:31:35,469
type two kardashev civilization I don't
really like the kardashev scale uh and I

7968
02:31:35,469 --> 02:31:35,479
really like the kardashev scale uh and I
 

7969
02:31:35,479 --> 02:31:37,030
really like the kardashev scale uh and I
it goes back to like I don't like a lot

7970
02:31:37,030 --> 02:31:37,040
it goes back to like I don't like a lot
 

7971
02:31:37,040 --> 02:31:38,309
it goes back to like I don't like a lot
of the narratives about life because

7972
02:31:38,309 --> 02:31:38,319
of the narratives about life because
 

7973
02:31:38,319 --> 02:31:40,910
of the narratives about life because
they're very like um you know survival

7974
02:31:40,910 --> 02:31:40,920
they're very like um you know survival
 

7975
02:31:40,920 --> 02:31:43,030
they're very like um you know survival
of the fittest energy consuming this

7976
02:31:43,030 --> 02:31:43,040
of the fittest energy consuming this
 

7977
02:31:43,040 --> 02:31:44,790
of the fittest energy consuming this
that the other thing it's very like I

7978
02:31:44,790 --> 02:31:44,800
that the other thing it's very like I
 

7979
02:31:44,800 --> 02:31:46,790
that the other thing it's very like I
don't know sort of oldw world you know

7980
02:31:46,790 --> 02:31:46,800
don't know sort of oldw world you know
 

7981
02:31:46,800 --> 02:31:49,429
don't know sort of oldw world you know
like conqueror mentality um what's the

7982
02:31:49,429 --> 02:31:49,439
like conqueror mentality um what's the
 

7983
02:31:49,439 --> 02:31:51,550
like conqueror mentality um what's the
alternative to that exactly I mean I

7984
02:31:51,550 --> 02:31:51,560
alternative to that exactly I mean I
 

7985
02:31:51,560 --> 02:31:55,150
alternative to that exactly I mean I
think it does require life to use new

7986
02:31:55,150 --> 02:31:55,160
think it does require life to use new
 

7987
02:31:55,160 --> 02:31:56,990
think it does require life to use new
energy sources in order to expand the

7988
02:31:56,990 --> 02:31:57,000
energy sources in order to expand the
 

7989
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,710
energy sources in order to expand the
way it is so that part's accurate but I

7990
02:31:59,710 --> 02:31:59,720
way it is so that part's accurate but I
 

7991
02:31:59,720 --> 02:32:03,190
way it is so that part's accurate but I
think this sort of process of Life uh

7992
02:32:03,190 --> 02:32:03,200
think this sort of process of Life uh
 

7993
02:32:03,200 --> 02:32:05,950
think this sort of process of Life uh
gener like being the the mechanism that

7994
02:32:05,950 --> 02:32:05,960
gener like being the the mechanism that
 

7995
02:32:05,960 --> 02:32:08,389
gener like being the the mechanism that
the Universe creatively expresses itself

7996
02:32:08,389 --> 02:32:08,399
the Universe creatively expresses itself
 

7997
02:32:08,399 --> 02:32:10,950
the Universe creatively expresses itself
generates novelty explores the space of

02:32:10,950 --> 02:32:10,960
generates novelty explores the space of
 

7999
02:32:10,960 --> 02:32:12,670

the possible is really the thing that's

8000
02:32:12,670 --> 02:32:12,680
the possible is really the thing that's
 

8001
02:32:12,680 --> 02:32:15,950
the possible is really the thing that's
most deeply intrinsic to life and so you

8002
02:32:15,950 --> 02:32:15,960
most deeply intrinsic to life and so you
 

8003
02:32:15,960 --> 02:32:19,190
most deeply intrinsic to life and so you
know these sort of um energy consuming

8004
02:32:19,190 --> 02:32:19,200
know these sort of um energy consuming
 

8005
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:21,349
know these sort of um energy consuming
scales of technology I think is missing

8006
02:32:21,349 --> 02:32:21,359
scales of technology I think is missing
 

8007
02:32:21,359 --> 02:32:22,830
scales of technology I think is missing
the sort of

02:32:22,830 --> 02:32:22,840
the sort of

02:32:22,840 --> 02:32:25,389
the sort of
actual feature that's most prominent

8010
02:32:25,389 --> 02:32:25,399
actual feature that's most prominent
 

8011
02:32:25,399 --> 02:32:27,790
actual feature that's most prominent
about any alien life that we might in

8012
02:32:27,790 --> 02:32:27,800
about any alien life that we might in
 

8013
02:32:27,800 --> 02:32:30,710
about any alien life that we might in
find which is that it's literally our

8014
02:32:30,710 --> 02:32:30,720
find which is that it's literally our
 

8015
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:32,349
find which is that it's literally our

02:32:32,349 --> 02:32:32,359
universe our reality trying to
 

8017
02:32:32,359 --> 02:32:34,110
universe our reality trying to
creatively Express itself and trying to

8018
02:32:34,110 --> 02:32:34,120
creatively Express itself and trying to
 

8019
02:32:34,120 --> 02:32:35,670
creatively Express itself and trying to
find out what can exist and trying to

8020
02:32:35,670 --> 02:32:35,680
find out what can exist and trying to
 

8021
02:32:35,680 --> 02:32:37,469
find out what can exist and trying to
make it exists see but past a certain

8022
02:32:37,469 --> 02:32:37,479
make it exists see but past a certain
 

8023
02:32:37,479 --> 02:32:39,550
make it exists see but past a certain
level of complexity unfortunately maybe

8024
02:32:39,550 --> 02:32:39,560
level of complexity unfortunately maybe
 

8025
02:32:39,560 --> 02:32:42,070
level of complexity unfortunately maybe
you can correct me but we're built all

8026
02:32:42,070 --> 02:32:42,080
you can correct me but we're built all
 

8027
02:32:42,080 --> 02:32:43,710
you can correct me but we're built all
complex life on Earth is built on a

8028
02:32:43,710 --> 02:32:43,720
complex life on Earth is built on a
 

8029
02:32:43,720 --> 02:32:46,110
complex life on Earth is built on a
foundation of that Predator pre Dynamic

8030
02:32:46,110 --> 02:32:46,120
foundation of that Predator pre Dynamic
 

8031
02:32:46,120 --> 02:32:47,990
foundation of that Predator pre Dynamic
yes and so like I don't know if we can

8032
02:32:47,990 --> 02:32:48,000
yes and so like I don't know if we can
 

8033
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,230
yes and so like I don't know if we can
escape that I don't know we can't but

8034
02:32:50,230 --> 02:32:50,240
escape that I don't know we can't but
 

8035
02:32:50,240 --> 02:32:51,630
escape that I don't know we can't but
but this is why I'm okay with having a

8036
02:32:51,630 --> 02:32:51,640
but this is why I'm okay with having a
 

8037
02:32:51,640 --> 02:32:53,670
but this is why I'm okay with having a
finite Lifetime and you know one of the

8038
02:32:53,670 --> 02:32:53,680
finite Lifetime and you know one of the
 

8039
02:32:53,680 --> 02:32:56,429
finite Lifetime and you know one of the
reasons I'm okay with that actually yeah

8040
02:32:56,429 --> 02:32:56,439
reasons I'm okay with that actually yeah
 

8041
02:32:56,439 --> 02:32:59,030
reasons I'm okay with that actually yeah
goes back to this issue of the fact that

8042
02:32:59,030 --> 02:32:59,040
goes back to this issue of the fact that
 

8043
02:32:59,040 --> 02:33:01,630
goes back to this issue of the fact that
we're resource bound we live in a you

8044
02:33:01,630 --> 02:33:01,640
we're resource bound we live in a you
 

8045
02:33:01,640 --> 02:33:03,349
we're resource bound we live in a you
know like we have a finite amount of

8046
02:33:03,349 --> 02:33:03,359
know like we have a finite amount of
 

8047
02:33:03,359 --> 02:33:05,389
know like we have a finite amount of
material whatever way you want to Define

8048
02:33:05,389 --> 02:33:05,399
material whatever way you want to Define
 

8049
02:33:05,399 --> 02:33:07,429
material whatever way you want to Define
material I think like for me you know

8050
02:33:07,429 --> 02:33:07,439
material I think like for me you know
 

8051
02:33:07,439 --> 02:33:10,670
material I think like for me you know
material is time material is information

8052
02:33:10,670 --> 02:33:10,680
material is time material is information
 

8053
02:33:10,680 --> 02:33:12,710
material is time material is information
but we have a finite amount of material

8054
02:33:12,710 --> 02:33:12,720
but we have a finite amount of material
 

8055
02:33:12,720 --> 02:33:14,870
but we have a finite amount of material
um if time is a generating mechanism

8056
02:33:14,870 --> 02:33:14,880
um if time is a generating mechanism
 

8057
02:33:14,880 --> 02:33:16,750
um if time is a generating mechanism
it's always going to be finite because

8058
02:33:16,750 --> 02:33:16,760
it's always going to be finite because
 

8059
02:33:16,760 --> 02:33:19,150
it's always going to be finite because
the universe is you know like it's it's

8060
02:33:19,150 --> 02:33:19,160
the universe is you know like it's it's
 

8061
02:33:19,160 --> 02:33:20,830
the universe is you know like it's it's
it's a resource that's getting generated

8062
02:33:20,830 --> 02:33:20,840
it's a resource that's getting generated
 

8063
02:33:20,840 --> 02:33:25,230
it's a resource that's getting generated
but it has a size um which means that

8064
02:33:25,230 --> 02:33:25,240
but it has a size um which means that
 

8065
02:33:25,240 --> 02:33:27,269
but it has a size um which means that
all the things that could exist don't

8066
02:33:27,269 --> 02:33:27,279
all the things that could exist don't
 

8067
02:33:27,279 --> 02:33:28,870
all the things that could exist don't
exist and in fact most of them never

8068
02:33:28,870 --> 02:33:28,880
exist and in fact most of them never
 

8069
02:33:28,880 --> 02:33:31,469
exist and in fact most of them never
will so death is a way to make room in

8070
02:33:31,469 --> 02:33:31,479
will so death is a way to make room in
 

8071
02:33:31,479 --> 02:33:32,950
will so death is a way to make room in
the universe for other things to exist

8072
02:33:32,950 --> 02:33:32,960
the universe for other things to exist
 

8073
02:33:32,960 --> 02:33:34,670
the universe for other things to exist
that wouldn't be able to exist otherwise

8074
02:33:34,670 --> 02:33:34,680
that wouldn't be able to exist otherwise
 

8075
02:33:34,680 --> 02:33:36,510
that wouldn't be able to exist otherwise
so if the universe over its entire

8076
02:33:36,510 --> 02:33:36,520
so if the universe over its entire
 

8077
02:33:36,520 --> 02:33:38,349
so if the universe over its entire
temporal history wants to maximize the

8078
02:33:38,349 --> 02:33:38,359
temporal history wants to maximize the
 

8079
02:33:38,359 --> 02:33:40,190
temporal history wants to maximize the
number of things want is a hard word

8080
02:33:40,190 --> 02:33:40,200
number of things want is a hard word
 

8081
02:33:40,200 --> 02:33:41,550
number of things want is a hard word
maximize a hard word all these things

8082
02:33:41,550 --> 02:33:41,560
maximize a hard word all these things
 

8083
02:33:41,560 --> 02:33:44,030
maximize a hard word all these things
are approximate but wants to maximize

8084
02:33:44,030 --> 02:33:44,040
are approximate but wants to maximize
 

8085
02:33:44,040 --> 02:33:45,910
are approximate but wants to maximize
the number of things that can exist the

8086
02:33:45,910 --> 02:33:45,920
the number of things that can exist the
 

8087
02:33:45,920 --> 02:33:47,950
the number of things that can exist the
best way to do it is to make recursively

8088
02:33:47,950 --> 02:33:47,960
best way to do it is to make recursively
 

8089
02:33:47,960 --> 02:33:49,990
best way to do it is to make recursively

02:34:14,640 --> 02:34:16,349
much like there's mystery all around us
yes if you had to like bet money on it

8114
02:34:16,349 --> 02:34:16,359
yes if you had to like bet money on it
 

8115
02:34:16,359 --> 02:34:19,710
yes if you had to like bet money on it
like what percent so like say aill

8116
02:34:19,710 --> 02:34:19,720
like what percent so like say aill
 

8117
02:34:19,720 --> 02:34:22,309
like what percent so like say aill
million years from now the story of

8118
02:34:22,309 --> 02:34:22,319
million years from now the story of
 

8119
02:34:22,319 --> 02:34:23,830
million years from now the story of
science

8120
02:34:23,830 --> 02:34:23,840

8121
02:34:23,840 --> 02:34:27,550

M and uh human understanding

8122
02:34:27,550 --> 02:34:27,560
M and uh human understanding
 

8123
02:34:27,560 --> 02:34:31,550
M and uh human understanding
understanding that uh started on Earth

8124
02:34:31,550 --> 02:34:31,560
understanding that uh started on Earth
 

8125
02:34:31,560 --> 02:34:34,550
understanding that uh started on Earth
is written like what chapter are we on

8126
02:34:34,550 --> 02:34:34,560
is written like what chapter are we on
 

8127
02:34:34,560 --> 02:34:37,870
is written like what chapter are we on
are We like is this like 1% 10%

8128
02:34:37,870 --> 02:34:37,880
are We like is this like 1% 10%
 

8129
02:34:37,880 --> 02:34:42,510
are We like is this like 1% 10%
20% um 50% 90% how much do we understand

8130
02:34:42,510 --> 02:34:42,520
20% um 50% 90% how much do we understand
 

8131
02:34:42,520 --> 02:34:45,469
20% um 50% 90% how much do we understand
like the big stuff not not like the

8132
02:34:45,469 --> 02:34:45,479
like the big stuff not not like the
 

8133
02:34:45,479 --> 02:34:48,790
like the big stuff not not like the
details of like like big important

8134
02:34:48,790 --> 02:34:48,800
details of like like big important
 

8135
02:34:48,800 --> 02:34:52,790
details of like like big important
questions yeah and ideas I think we're

8136
02:34:52,790 --> 02:34:52,800
questions yeah and ideas I think we're
 

8137
02:34:52,800 --> 02:34:53,910
questions yeah and ideas I think we're
in our

8138
02:34:53,910 --> 02:34:53,920
in our
 

8139
02:34:53,920 --> 02:34:58,349
in our
20s and 20% 20 no like agewise let's say

8140
02:34:58,349 --> 02:34:58,359
20s and 20% 20 no like agewise let's say
 

8141
02:34:58,359 --> 02:35:00,110
20s and 20% 20 no like agewise let's say
we're in our 20s but the lifespan is

8142
02:35:00,110 --> 02:35:00,120
we're in our 20s but the lifespan is
 

8143
02:35:00,120 --> 02:35:02,469
we're in our 20s but the lifespan is
going to keep getting longer you can't

8144
02:35:02,469 --> 02:35:02,479
going to keep getting longer you can't
 

8145
02:35:02,479 --> 02:35:04,910
going to keep getting longer you can't
do that I can you know why I use that

8146
02:35:04,910 --> 02:35:04,920
do that I can you know why I use that
 

8147
02:35:04,920 --> 02:35:07,349
do that I can you know why I use that
though I'll tell you why uh why my brain

8148
02:35:07,349 --> 02:35:07,359
though I'll tell you why uh why my brain
 

8149
02:35:07,359 --> 02:35:09,469
though I'll tell you why uh why my brain
went there is because uh you know

8150
02:35:09,469 --> 02:35:09,479
went there is because uh you know
 

8151
02:35:09,479 --> 02:35:11,269
went there is because uh you know
anybody that gets an education in

8152
02:35:11,269 --> 02:35:11,279
anybody that gets an education in
 

8153
02:35:11,279 --> 02:35:13,990
anybody that gets an education in
physics you know has this sort of Trope

8154
02:35:13,990 --> 02:35:14,000
physics you know has this sort of Trope
 

8155
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:15,670
physics you know has this sort of Trope
about how all the great physicists did

8156
02:35:15,670 --> 02:35:15,680
about how all the great physicists did
 

8157
02:35:15,680 --> 02:35:18,830
about how all the great physicists did
their best work in their 20s uh and then

8158
02:35:18,830 --> 02:35:18,840
their best work in their 20s uh and then
 

8159
02:35:18,840 --> 02:35:20,349
their best work in their 20s uh and then
you don't do any good work after that

8160
02:35:20,349 --> 02:35:20,359
you don't do any good work after that
 

8161
02:35:20,359 --> 02:35:21,429
you don't do any good work after that
and I always thought it was kind of

8162
02:35:21,429 --> 02:35:21,439
and I always thought it was kind of
 

8163
02:35:21,439 --> 02:35:26,750
and I always thought it was kind of
funny because for me physics uh is

8164
02:35:26,750 --> 02:35:26,760
funny because for me physics uh is
 

8165
02:35:26,760 --> 02:35:29,790
funny because for me physics uh is
um is not complete it's not nearly

8166
02:35:29,790 --> 02:35:29,800
um is not complete it's not nearly
 

8167
02:35:29,800 --> 02:35:31,830
um is not complete it's not nearly
complete but most physicists think that

8168
02:35:31,830 --> 02:35:31,840
complete but most physicists think that
 

8169
02:35:31,840 --> 02:35:33,550
complete but most physicists think that
we understand most of the structure of

8170
02:35:33,550 --> 02:35:33,560
we understand most of the structure of
 

8171
02:35:33,560 --> 02:35:37,510
we understand most of the structure of
reality and so I I think I I actually I

8172
02:35:37,510 --> 02:35:37,520
reality and so I I think I I actually I
 

8173
02:35:37,520 --> 02:35:39,389
reality and so I I think I I actually I
think I put this in the book somewhere

8174
02:35:39,389 --> 02:35:39,399
think I put this in the book somewhere
 

8175
02:35:39,399 --> 02:35:42,910
think I put this in the book somewhere
but like this idea to me that societies

8176
02:35:42,910 --> 02:35:42,920
but like this idea to me that societies
 

8177
02:35:42,920 --> 02:35:44,389
but like this idea to me that societies
would discover everything while they're

8178
02:35:44,389 --> 02:35:44,399
would discover everything while they're
 

8179
02:35:44,399 --> 02:35:46,389
would discover everything while they're
young is very consistent with the way we

8180
02:35:46,389 --> 02:35:46,399
young is very consistent with the way we
 

8181
02:35:46,399 --> 02:35:49,070
young is very consistent with the way we
talk about physics right now um but I

8182
02:35:49,070 --> 02:35:49,080
talk about physics right now um but I
 

8183
02:35:49,080 --> 02:35:50,950
talk about physics right now um but I
don't think that's actually the way that

8184
02:35:50,950 --> 02:35:50,960
don't think that's actually the way that
 

8185
02:35:50,960 --> 02:35:52,670
don't think that's actually the way that
things are going to go and you're you're

8186
02:35:52,670 --> 02:35:52,680
things are going to go and you're you're
 

8187
02:35:52,680 --> 02:35:55,630
things are going to go and you're you're
finding that people that are making

8188
02:35:55,630 --> 02:35:55,640
finding that people that are making
 

8189
02:35:55,640 --> 02:35:58,110
finding that people that are making
major discoveries are getting older in

8190
02:35:58,110 --> 02:35:58,120
major discoveries are getting older in
 

8191
02:35:58,120 --> 02:35:59,550
major discoveries are getting older in
some sense than they were and our

8192
02:35:59,550 --> 02:35:59,560
some sense than they were and our
 

8193
02:35:59,560 --> 02:36:02,670
some sense than they were and our
lifespan is also increasing so I think

8194
02:36:02,670 --> 02:36:02,680
lifespan is also increasing so I think
 

8195
02:36:02,680 --> 02:36:04,990
lifespan is also increasing so I think
there is something about age and your

8196
02:36:04,990 --> 02:36:05,000
there is something about age and your
 

8197
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:06,670
there is something about age and your
ability to learn and how much of the

8198
02:36:06,670 --> 02:36:06,680
ability to learn and how much of the
 

8199
02:36:06,680 --> 02:36:08,630
ability to learn and how much of the
world you can see that's really

8200
02:36:08,630 --> 02:36:08,640
world you can see that's really
 

8201
02:36:08,640 --> 02:36:11,269
world you can see that's really
important over a human lifespan but also

8202
02:36:11,269 --> 02:36:11,279
important over a human lifespan but also
 

8203
02:36:11,279 --> 02:36:14,150
important over a human lifespan but also
over the lifespan of societies and so I

8204
02:36:14,150 --> 02:36:14,160
over the lifespan of societies and so I
 

8205
02:36:14,160 --> 02:36:16,150
over the lifespan of societies and so I
don't know how big the frontier is I

8206
02:36:16,150 --> 02:36:16,160
don't know how big the frontier is I
 

8207
02:36:16,160 --> 02:36:19,750
don't know how big the frontier is I
don't actually think it has a limit I I

8208
02:36:19,750 --> 02:36:19,760
don't actually think it has a limit I I
 

8209
02:36:19,760 --> 02:36:21,950
don't actually think it has a limit I I
don't believe in Infinity as a physical

8210
02:36:21,950 --> 02:36:21,960
don't believe in Infinity as a physical
 

8211
02:36:21,960 --> 02:36:24,790
don't believe in Infinity as a physical
thing but I think as a a receding

8212
02:36:24,790 --> 02:36:24,800
thing but I think as a a receding
 

8213
02:36:24,800 --> 02:36:26,630
thing but I think as a a receding
Horizon I think because the universe is

8214
02:36:26,630 --> 02:36:26,640
Horizon I think because the universe is
 

8215
02:36:26,640 --> 02:36:28,750
Horizon I think because the universe is
getting bigger you can never know all of

8216
02:36:28,750 --> 02:36:28,760
getting bigger you can never know all of
 

8217
02:36:28,760 --> 02:36:30,870
getting bigger you can never know all of
it well I think it's

8218
02:36:30,870 --> 02:36:30,880
it well I think it's
 

8219
02:36:30,880 --> 02:36:33,309
it well I think it's
about

8220
02:36:33,309 --> 02:36:33,319
about
 

8221
02:36:33,319 --> 02:36:36,309
about
1.7% 1.7 where is that come from it's a

8222
02:36:36,309 --> 02:36:36,319
1.7% 1.7 where is that come from it's a
 

8223
02:36:36,319 --> 02:36:38,349
1.7% 1.7 where is that come from it's a
finite I don't know I just made it up

8224
02:36:38,349 --> 02:36:38,359
finite I don't know I just made it up
 

8225
02:36:38,359 --> 02:36:39,389
finite I don't know I just made it up
but it's like that number had to come

8226
02:36:39,389 --> 02:36:39,399
but it's like that number had to come
 

8227
02:36:39,399 --> 02:36:42,230
but it's like that number had to come
from somewhere it certainly I think

8228
02:36:42,230 --> 02:36:42,240
from somewhere it certainly I think
 

8229
02:36:42,240 --> 02:36:44,070
from somewhere it certainly I think
seven is the thing that people usually

8230
02:36:44,070 --> 02:36:44,080
seven is the thing that people usually
 

8231
02:36:44,080 --> 02:36:47,630
seven is the thing that people usually
pick 7% so I I wanted to say 1% but I

8232
02:36:47,630 --> 02:36:47,640
pick 7% so I I wanted to say 1% but I
 

8233
02:36:47,640 --> 02:36:50,429
pick 7% so I I wanted to say 1% but I
thought it would be funnier yeah a point

8234
02:36:50,429 --> 02:36:50,439
thought it would be funnier yeah a point
 

8235
02:36:50,439 --> 02:36:52,790
thought it would be funnier yeah a point
you know soor inject a little humor in

8236
02:36:52,790 --> 02:36:52,800
you know soor inject a little humor in
 

8237
02:36:52,800 --> 02:36:54,910
you know soor inject a little humor in
there so the seven is for the humor one

8238
02:36:54,910 --> 02:36:54,920
there so the seven is for the humor one
 

8239
02:36:54,920 --> 02:36:58,429
there so the seven is for the humor one
is for how much mystery I think there is

8240
02:36:58,429 --> 02:36:58,439
is for how much mystery I think there is
 

8241
02:36:58,439 --> 02:37:02,110
is for how much mystery I think there is
out there 99% mystery 1% known in terms

8242
02:37:02,110 --> 02:37:02,120
out there 99% mystery 1% known in terms
 

8243
02:37:02,120 --> 02:37:04,790
out there 99% mystery 1% known in terms
of like really big important questions

8244
02:37:04,790 --> 02:37:04,800
of like really big important questions
 

8245
02:37:04,800 --> 02:37:06,790
of like really big important questions
yeah it's like the list say there's

8246
02:37:06,790 --> 02:37:06,800
yeah it's like the list say there's
 

8247
02:37:06,800 --> 02:37:08,750
yeah it's like the list say there's
going to be like 200 chapters like the

8248
02:37:08,750 --> 02:37:08,760
going to be like 200 chapters like the
 

8249
02:37:08,760 --> 02:37:11,429
going to be like 200 chapters like the
stuff that's going to remain

8250
02:37:11,429 --> 02:37:11,439
stuff that's going to remain
 

8251
02:37:11,439 --> 02:37:13,910
stuff that's going to remain
true but you think the book has a finite

8252
02:37:13,910 --> 02:37:13,920
true but you think the book has a finite
 

8253
02:37:13,920 --> 02:37:16,590
true but you think the book has a finite
size yeah yeah and I

8254
02:37:16,590 --> 02:37:16,600
size yeah yeah and I
 

8255
02:37:16,600 --> 02:37:18,990
size yeah yeah and I
don't I mean not that I believe in

8256
02:37:18,990 --> 02:37:19,000
don't I mean not that I believe in
 

8257
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:20,910
don't I mean not that I believe in
infinities but I don't I think the size

8258
02:37:20,910 --> 02:37:20,920
infinities but I don't I think the size
 

8259
02:37:20,920 --> 02:37:22,510
infinities but I don't I think the size
of the book is

8260
02:37:22,510 --> 02:37:22,520
of the book is
 

8261
02:37:22,520 --> 02:37:24,790
of the book is
growing well the fact that the size of

8262
02:37:24,790 --> 02:37:24,800
growing well the fact that the size of
 

8263
02:37:24,800 --> 02:37:26,710
growing well the fact that the size of
the book is growing is one of the

8264
02:37:26,710 --> 02:37:26,720
the book is growing is one of the
 

8265
02:37:26,720 --> 02:37:29,990
the book is growing is one of the
chapters in the book oh there you go oh

8266
02:37:29,990 --> 02:37:30,000
chapters in the book oh there you go oh
 

8267
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:31,990
chapters in the book oh there you go oh
we're we're being

8268
02:37:31,990 --> 02:37:32,000
we're we're being
 

8269
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,349
we're we're being
recursive I think you have to you can't

8270
02:37:34,349 --> 02:37:34,359
recursive I think you have to you can't
 

8271
02:37:34,359 --> 02:37:36,750
recursive I think you have to you can't
you can't have an Ever growing book yes

8272
02:37:36,750 --> 02:37:36,760
you can't have an Ever growing book yes
 

8273
02:37:36,760 --> 02:37:39,790
you can't have an Ever growing book yes
you can I mean you just I mean I don't

8274
02:37:39,790 --> 02:37:39,800
you can I mean you just I mean I don't
 

8275
02:37:39,800 --> 02:37:41,870
you can I mean you just I mean I don't
even because then well you couldn't have

8276
02:37:41,870 --> 02:37:41,880
even because then well you couldn't have
 

8277
02:37:41,880 --> 02:37:43,630
even because then well you couldn't have
been asking this at the original life

8278
02:37:43,630 --> 02:37:43,640
been asking this at the original life
 

8279
02:37:43,640 --> 02:37:44,670
been asking this at the original life
right because obviously like you

8280
02:37:44,670 --> 02:37:44,680
right because obviously like you
 

8281
02:37:44,680 --> 02:37:46,630
right because obviously like you
wouldn't have existed the original life

8282
02:37:46,630 --> 02:37:46,640
wouldn't have existed the original life
 

8283
02:37:46,640 --> 02:37:48,630
wouldn't have existed the original life
but like the question of intelligence

8284
02:37:48,630 --> 02:37:48,640
but like the question of intelligence
 

8285
02:37:48,640 --> 02:37:51,030
but like the question of intelligence
and icial General like those questions

8286
02:37:51,030 --> 02:37:51,040
and icial General like those questions
 

8287
02:37:51,040 --> 02:37:55,269
and icial General like those questions
did not exist then and so and they in

8288
02:37:55,269 --> 02:37:55,279
did not exist then and so and they in
 

8289
02:37:55,279 --> 02:37:56,670
did not exist then and so and they in
part existed because the universe

8290
02:37:56,670 --> 02:37:56,680
part existed because the universe
 

8291
02:37:56,680 --> 02:37:58,790
part existed because the universe
invented a space for those questions to

8292
02:37:58,790 --> 02:37:58,800
invented a space for those questions to
 

8293
02:37:58,800 --> 02:38:00,990
invented a space for those questions to
exist through

8294
02:38:00,990 --> 02:38:01,000
exist through
 

8295
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,429
exist through
Evolution but like I think that question

8296
02:38:03,429 --> 02:38:03,439
Evolution but like I think that question
 

8297
02:38:03,439 --> 02:38:05,630
Evolution but like I think that question
will still stand a thousand years from

8298
02:38:05,630 --> 02:38:05,640
will still stand a thousand years from
 

8299
02:38:05,640 --> 02:38:07,309
will still stand a thousand years from
now it will but there will be other

8300
02:38:07,309 --> 02:38:07,319
now it will but there will be other
 

8301
02:38:07,319 --> 02:38:09,110
now it will but there will be other
questions we can't anticipate now that

8302
02:38:09,110 --> 02:38:09,120
questions we can't anticipate now that
 

8303
02:38:09,120 --> 02:38:10,910
questions we can't anticipate now that
we'll be asking yeah and maybe we'll

8304
02:38:10,910 --> 02:38:10,920
we'll be asking yeah and maybe we'll
 

8305
02:38:10,920 --> 02:38:12,670
we'll be asking yeah and maybe we'll
develop the kinds of

8306
02:38:12,670 --> 02:38:12,680
develop the kinds of
 

8307
02:38:12,680 --> 02:38:14,750
develop the kinds of
languages that would be able to ask much

8308
02:38:14,750 --> 02:38:14,760
languages that would be able to ask much
 

8309
02:38:14,760 --> 02:38:16,550
languages that would be able to ask much
better questions right or like like the

8310
02:38:16,550 --> 02:38:16,560
better questions right or like like the
 

8311
02:38:16,560 --> 02:38:18,750
better questions right or like like the
theory of like gravitation for example

8312
02:38:18,750 --> 02:38:18,760
theory of like gravitation for example
 

8313
02:38:18,760 --> 02:38:20,269
theory of like gravitation for example
like when we invented to that theory

8314
02:38:20,269 --> 02:38:20,279
like when we invented to that theory
 

8315
02:38:20,279 --> 02:38:21,429
like when we invented to that theory
like we only knew about the planets in

8316
02:38:21,429 --> 02:38:21,439
like we only knew about the planets in
 

8317
02:38:21,439 --> 02:38:23,990
like we only knew about the planets in
our solar system right and now you know

8318
02:38:23,990 --> 02:38:24,000
our solar system right and now you know
 

8319
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:25,469
our solar system right and now you know
many centuries later we know about all

8320
02:38:25,469 --> 02:38:25,479
many centuries later we know about all
 

8321
02:38:25,479 --> 02:38:26,750
many centuries later we know about all
these planets around other stars and

8322
02:38:26,750 --> 02:38:26,760
these planets around other stars and
 

8323
02:38:26,760 --> 02:38:28,070
these planets around other stars and
black holes and other things that we

8324
02:38:28,070 --> 02:38:28,080
black holes and other things that we
 

8325
02:38:28,080 --> 02:38:30,630
black holes and other things that we
could never have anticipated so and then

8326
02:38:30,630 --> 02:38:30,640
could never have anticipated so and then
 

8327
02:38:30,640 --> 02:38:33,070
could never have anticipated so and then
we can ask questions about them um you

8328
02:38:33,070 --> 02:38:33,080
we can ask questions about them um you
 

8329
02:38:33,080 --> 02:38:34,190
we can ask questions about them um you
know like we wouldn't have been asking

8330
02:38:34,190 --> 02:38:34,200
know like we wouldn't have been asking
 

8331
02:38:34,200 --> 02:38:36,630
know like we wouldn't have been asking
about singularities and like can they

8332
02:38:36,630 --> 02:38:36,640
about singularities and like can they
 

8333
02:38:36,640 --> 02:38:37,790
about singularities and like can they
really be physical things in the

8334
02:38:37,790 --> 02:38:37,800
really be physical things in the
 

8335
02:38:37,800 --> 02:38:39,269
really be physical things in the
universe several hundred years ago that

8336
02:38:39,269 --> 02:38:39,279
universe several hundred years ago that
 

8337
02:38:39,279 --> 02:38:41,670
universe several hundred years ago that
question couldn't

8338
02:38:41,670 --> 02:38:41,680
question couldn't
 

8339
02:38:41,680 --> 02:38:44,750
question couldn't
exist yeah but it's not I still think

8340
02:38:44,750 --> 02:38:44,760
exist yeah but it's not I still think
 

8341
02:38:44,760 --> 02:38:47,269
exist yeah but it's not I still think
those are chapters in a book like I

8342
02:38:47,269 --> 02:38:47,279
those are chapters in a book like I
 

8343
02:38:47,279 --> 02:38:49,110
those are chapters in a book like I
don't get a sense from that so do you

8344
02:38:49,110 --> 02:38:49,120
don't get a sense from that so do you
 

8345
02:38:49,120 --> 02:38:50,710
don't get a sense from that so do you
think that Universe has an

8346
02:38:50,710 --> 02:38:50,720
think that Universe has an
 

8347
02:38:50,720 --> 02:38:54,309
think that Universe has an
end if you think it's a book with an end

8348
02:38:54,309 --> 02:38:54,319
end if you think it's a book with an end
 

8349
02:38:54,319 --> 02:38:57,550
end if you think it's a book with an end
I think the number of words required to

8350
02:38:57,550 --> 02:38:57,560
I think the number of words required to
 

8351
02:38:57,560 --> 02:38:59,309
I think the number of words required to
describe how the universe works as an

8352
02:38:59,309 --> 02:38:59,319
describe how the universe works as an
 

8353
02:38:59,319 --> 02:39:01,990
describe how the universe works as an
end

8354
02:39:01,990 --> 02:39:02,000

 

8355
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,950

yes meaning like I don't care if it's

8356
02:39:04,950 --> 02:39:04,960
yes meaning like I don't care if it's
 

8357
02:39:04,960 --> 02:39:07,030
yes meaning like I don't care if it's
infinite or not right as long as the

8358
02:39:07,030 --> 02:39:07,040
infinite or not right as long as the
 

8359
02:39:07,040 --> 02:39:10,550
infinite or not right as long as the
explanation is simple and it exists oh I

8360
02:39:10,550 --> 02:39:10,560
explanation is simple and it exists oh I
 

8361
02:39:10,560 --> 02:39:12,910
explanation is simple and it exists oh I
see and I think there is a finite

8362
02:39:12,910 --> 02:39:12,920
see and I think there is a finite
 

8363
02:39:12,920 --> 02:39:16,230
see and I think there is a finite
explanation for each aspect of it the

8364
02:39:16,230 --> 02:39:16,240
explanation for each aspect of it the
 

8365
02:39:16,240 --> 02:39:20,630
explanation for each aspect of it the
Consciousness the life yeah um I mean

8366
02:39:20,630 --> 02:39:20,640
Consciousness the life yeah um I mean
 

8367
02:39:20,640 --> 02:39:23,070
Consciousness the life yeah um I mean
very probably there's like

8368
02:39:23,070 --> 02:39:23,080
very probably there's like
 

8369
02:39:23,080 --> 02:39:25,790
very probably there's like
some the black hole thing is like what's

8370
02:39:25,790 --> 02:39:25,800
some the black hole thing is like what's
 

8371
02:39:25,800 --> 02:39:28,150
some the black hole thing is like what's
going on there where's that going like

8372
02:39:28,150 --> 02:39:28,160
going on there where's that going like
 

8373
02:39:28,160 --> 02:39:31,469
going on there where's that going like
where do they what and then you know why

8374
02:39:31,469 --> 02:39:31,479
where do they what and then you know why
 

8375
02:39:31,479 --> 02:39:34,990
where do they what and then you know why
the Big Bang like what right it's

8376
02:39:34,990 --> 02:39:35,000
the Big Bang like what right it's
 

8377
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:36,830
the Big Bang like what right it's
probably there's just a huge number of

8378
02:39:36,830 --> 02:39:36,840
probably there's just a huge number of
 

8379
02:39:36,840 --> 02:39:39,230
probably there's just a huge number of
universes and it's like universes inside

8380
02:39:39,230 --> 02:39:39,240
universes and it's like universes inside
 

8381
02:39:39,240 --> 02:39:41,230
universes and it's like universes inside
univers I think universes inside

8382
02:39:41,230 --> 02:39:41,240
univers I think universes inside
 

8383
02:39:41,240 --> 02:39:44,630
univers I think universes inside
universes is maybe possible I just think

8384
02:39:44,630 --> 02:39:44,640
universes is maybe possible I just think
 

8385
02:39:44,640 --> 02:39:48,950
universes is maybe possible I just think
it's it um every time we assume this is

8386
02:39:48,950 --> 02:39:48,960
it's it um every time we assume this is
 

8387
02:39:48,960 --> 02:39:51,870
it's it um every time we assume this is
all the is it turns out there's much

8388
02:39:51,870 --> 02:39:51,880
all the is it turns out there's much
 

8389
02:39:51,880 --> 02:39:54,750
all the is it turns out there's much
more the universe is a huge place and we

8390
02:39:54,750 --> 02:39:54,760
more the universe is a huge place and we
 

8391
02:39:54,760 --> 02:39:56,070
more the universe is a huge place and we
mostly talked about the past and the

8392
02:39:56,070 --> 02:39:56,080
mostly talked about the past and the
 

8393
02:39:56,080 --> 02:39:57,750
mostly talked about the past and the
richness of the past but the future I

8394
02:39:57,750 --> 02:39:57,760
richness of the past but the future I
 

8395
02:39:57,760 --> 02:39:59,510
richness of the past but the future I
mean with with many worlds

8396
02:39:59,510 --> 02:39:59,520
mean with with many worlds
 

8397
02:39:59,520 --> 02:40:01,190
mean with with many worlds
interpretation of quantum

8398
02:40:01,190 --> 02:40:01,200
interpretation of quantum
 

8399
02:40:01,200 --> 02:40:03,950
interpretation of quantum
mechanics so oh I'm not a many worlds

8400
02:40:03,950 --> 02:40:03,960
mechanics so oh I'm not a many worlds
 

8401
02:40:03,960 --> 02:40:07,110
mechanics so oh I'm not a many worlds
person you're not no are you how many

8402
02:40:07,110 --> 02:40:07,120
person you're not no are you how many
 

8403
02:40:07,120 --> 02:40:09,510
person you're not no are you how many
lexes are there depending on the day

8404
02:40:09,510 --> 02:40:09,520
lexes are there depending on the day
 

8405
02:40:09,520 --> 02:40:11,630
lexes are there depending on the day
well do some of them wear yellow jackets

8406
02:40:11,630 --> 02:40:11,640
well do some of them wear yellow jackets
 

8407
02:40:11,640 --> 02:40:13,030
well do some of them wear yellow jackets
at the m at the moment we asked the

8408
02:40:13,030 --> 02:40:13,040
at the m at the moment we asked the
 

8409
02:40:13,040 --> 02:40:15,469
at the m at the moment we asked the
question there was one at the moment I'm

8410
02:40:15,469 --> 02:40:15,479
question there was one at the moment I'm
 

8411
02:40:15,479 --> 02:40:17,469
question there was one at the moment I'm
answering it there's now in near

8412
02:40:17,469 --> 02:40:17,479
answering it there's now in near
 

8413
02:40:17,479 --> 02:40:19,710
answering it there's now in near
Infinity apparently

8414
02:40:19,710 --> 02:40:19,720
Infinity apparently
 

8415
02:40:19,720 --> 02:40:22,190
Infinity apparently
um I mean the future

8416
02:40:22,190 --> 02:40:22,200
um I mean the future
 

8417
02:40:22,200 --> 02:40:24,590
um I mean the future
is the future is bigger than the past

8418
02:40:24,590 --> 02:40:24,600
is the future is bigger than the past
 

8419
02:40:24,600 --> 02:40:26,630
is the future is bigger than the past
yes yes okay well there you go but in

8420
02:40:26,630 --> 02:40:26,640
yes yes okay well there you go but in
 

8421
02:40:26,640 --> 02:40:29,110
yes yes okay well there you go but in
the past according to already gigantic

8422
02:40:29,110 --> 02:40:29,120
the past according to already gigantic
 

8423
02:40:29,120 --> 02:40:30,990
the past according to already gigantic
yeah but yeah I mean that's consistent

8424
02:40:30,990 --> 02:40:31,000
yeah but yeah I mean that's consistent
 

8425
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:32,070
yeah but yeah I mean that's consistent
with many worlds right because like

8426
02:40:32,070 --> 02:40:32,080
with many worlds right because like
 

8427
02:40:32,080 --> 02:40:34,389
with many worlds right because like
there's this constant branching so but

8428
02:40:34,389 --> 02:40:34,399
there's this constant branching so but
 

8429
02:40:34,399 --> 02:40:36,309
there's this constant branching so but
it doesn't really have a directionality

8430
02:40:36,309 --> 02:40:36,319
it doesn't really have a directionality
 

8431
02:40:36,319 --> 02:40:38,469
it doesn't really have a directionality
to it it's it's a I don't know many

8432
02:40:38,469 --> 02:40:38,479
to it it's it's a I don't know many
 

8433
02:40:38,479 --> 02:40:40,870
to it it's it's a I don't know many
worlds is weird so my interpretation of

8434
02:40:40,870 --> 02:40:40,880
worlds is weird so my interpretation of
 

8435
02:40:40,880 --> 02:40:42,910
worlds is weird so my interpretation of
reality is like if you fold it up like

8436
02:40:42,910 --> 02:40:42,920
reality is like if you fold it up like
 

8437
02:40:42,920 --> 02:40:44,790
reality is like if you fold it up like
all that bifurcation of many worlds and

8438
02:40:44,790 --> 02:40:44,800
all that bifurcation of many worlds and
 

8439
02:40:44,800 --> 02:40:46,510
all that bifurcation of many worlds and
you just fold it into the structure that

8440
02:40:46,510 --> 02:40:46,520
you just fold it into the structure that
 

8441
02:40:46,520 --> 02:40:48,469
you just fold it into the structure that
is you and you just said you are all of

8442
02:40:48,469 --> 02:40:48,479
is you and you just said you are all of
 

8443
02:40:48,479 --> 02:40:49,990
is you and you just said you are all of
those many worlds

8444
02:40:49,990 --> 02:40:50,000
those many worlds
 

8445
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,349
those many worlds
and like that sort of you know like like

8446
02:40:52,349 --> 02:40:52,359
and like that sort of you know like like
 

8447
02:40:52,359 --> 02:40:54,950
and like that sort of you know like like
your history like converged on you but

8448
02:40:54,950 --> 02:40:54,960
your history like converged on you but
 

8449
02:40:54,960 --> 02:40:56,469
your history like converged on you but
like you're you're actually an object

8450
02:40:56,469 --> 02:40:56,479
like you're you're actually an object
 

8451
02:40:56,479 --> 02:40:59,030
like you're you're actually an object
exists that's like that you know was

8452
02:40:59,030 --> 02:40:59,040
exists that's like that you know was
 

8453
02:40:59,040 --> 02:41:01,110
exists that's like that you know was
selected to exist and you're

8454
02:41:01,110 --> 02:41:01,120
selected to exist and you're
 

8455
02:41:01,120 --> 02:41:02,309
selected to exist and you're
self-consistent with the other

8456
02:41:02,309 --> 02:41:02,319
self-consistent with the other
 

8457
02:41:02,319 --> 02:41:03,670
self-consistent with the other
structures so like the quantum

8458
02:41:03,670 --> 02:41:03,680
structures so like the quantum
 

8459
02:41:03,680 --> 02:41:05,630
structures so like the quantum
mechanical reality is is not the one

8460
02:41:05,630 --> 02:41:05,640
mechanical reality is is not the one
 

8461
02:41:05,640 --> 02:41:08,150
mechanical reality is is not the one
that you live in it's this very

8462
02:41:08,150 --> 02:41:08,160
that you live in it's this very
 

8463
02:41:08,160 --> 02:41:11,230
that you live in it's this very
deterministic uh classical world and

8464
02:41:11,230 --> 02:41:11,240
deterministic uh classical world and
 

8465
02:41:11,240 --> 02:41:14,309
deterministic uh classical world and
you're carving a path through that space

8466
02:41:14,309 --> 02:41:14,319
you're carving a path through that space
 

8467
02:41:14,319 --> 02:41:16,790
you're carving a path through that space
But I don't think that you're constantly

8468
02:41:16,790 --> 02:41:16,800
But I don't think that you're constantly
 

8469
02:41:16,800 --> 02:41:18,670
But I don't think that you're constantly
branching into new spaces I think you

8470
02:41:18,670 --> 02:41:18,680
branching into new spaces I think you
 

8471
02:41:18,680 --> 02:41:21,030
branching into new spaces I think you
are that face wait so to you at at the

8472
02:41:21,030 --> 02:41:21,040
are that face wait so to you at at the
 

8473
02:41:21,040 --> 02:41:23,590
are that face wait so to you at at the
bottom it's deterministic I thought you

8474
02:41:23,590 --> 02:41:23,600
bottom it's deterministic I thought you
 

8475
02:41:23,600 --> 02:41:25,550
bottom it's deterministic I thought you
said the universe no it's random at the

8476
02:41:25,550 --> 02:41:25,560
said the universe no it's random at the
 

8477
02:41:25,560 --> 02:41:27,510
said the universe no it's random at the
bottom right but like this Randomness

8478
02:41:27,510 --> 02:41:27,520
bottom right but like this Randomness
 

8479
02:41:27,520 --> 02:41:29,510
bottom right but like this Randomness
that we see at the bottom of reality

8480
02:41:29,510 --> 02:41:29,520
that we see at the bottom of reality
 

8481
02:41:29,520 --> 02:41:31,750
that we see at the bottom of reality
that is quantum mechanics I think like

8482
02:41:31,750 --> 02:41:31,760
that is quantum mechanics I think like
 

8483
02:41:31,760 --> 02:41:34,110
that is quantum mechanics I think like
people have assumed that is reality and

8484
02:41:34,110 --> 02:41:34,120
people have assumed that is reality and
 

8485
02:41:34,120 --> 02:41:36,670
people have assumed that is reality and
what I'm saying is like all those things

8486
02:41:36,670 --> 02:41:36,680
what I'm saying is like all those things
 

8487
02:41:36,680 --> 02:41:38,110
what I'm saying is like all those things
you see in many worlds all those

8488
02:41:38,110 --> 02:41:38,120
you see in many worlds all those
 

8489
02:41:38,120 --> 02:41:40,630
you see in many worlds all those
versions of you just collect them up and

8490
02:41:40,630 --> 02:41:40,640
versions of you just collect them up and
 

8491
02:41:40,640 --> 02:41:43,910
versions of you just collect them up and
bundle them up and like they're all you

8492
02:41:43,910 --> 02:41:43,920
bundle them up and like they're all you
 

8493
02:41:43,920 --> 02:41:46,750
bundle them up and like they're all you
and what has happened is you know like

8494
02:41:46,750 --> 02:41:46,760
and what has happened is you know like
 

8495
02:41:46,760 --> 02:41:48,630
and what has happened is you know like
Elementary particles don't have they

8496
02:41:48,630 --> 02:41:48,640
Elementary particles don't have they
 

8497
02:41:48,640 --> 02:41:50,070
Elementary particles don't have they
don't live in in a deterministic

8498
02:41:50,070 --> 02:41:50,080
don't live in in a deterministic
 

8499
02:41:50,080 --> 02:41:51,429
don't live in in a deterministic
universe the things that we study in

8500
02:41:51,429 --> 02:41:51,439
universe the things that we study in
 

8501
02:41:51,439 --> 02:41:53,349
universe the things that we study in
Quantum experiments they live in this

8502
02:41:53,349 --> 02:41:53,359
Quantum experiments they live in this
 

8503
02:41:53,359 --> 02:41:56,309
Quantum experiments they live in this
fuzzy random space But as that structure

8504
02:41:56,309 --> 02:41:56,319
fuzzy random space But as that structure
 

8505
02:41:56,319 --> 02:41:57,990
fuzzy random space But as that structure
collapsed and started to build

8506
02:41:57,990 --> 02:41:58,000
collapsed and started to build
 

8507
02:41:58,000 --> 02:41:59,710
collapsed and started to build
structures that were deterministic and

8508
02:41:59,710 --> 02:41:59,720
structures that were deterministic and
 

8509
02:41:59,720 --> 02:42:01,990
structures that were deterministic and
evolved into you you are a very

8510
02:42:01,990 --> 02:42:02,000
evolved into you you are a very
 

8511
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,349
evolved into you you are a very
deterministic microscopic macroscopic

8512
02:42:04,349 --> 02:42:04,359
deterministic microscopic macroscopic
 

8513
02:42:04,359 --> 02:42:05,950
deterministic microscopic macroscopic
object and you can look down on that

8514
02:42:05,950 --> 02:42:05,960
object and you can look down on that
 

8515
02:42:05,960 --> 02:42:07,429
object and you can look down on that
universe that doesn't have time in it

8516
02:42:07,429 --> 02:42:07,439
universe that doesn't have time in it
 

8517
02:42:07,439 --> 02:42:10,429
universe that doesn't have time in it
that random structure um and you can see

8518
02:42:10,429 --> 02:42:10,439
that random structure um and you can see
 

8519
02:42:10,439 --> 02:42:12,830
that random structure um and you can see
that all of these possibilities look

8520
02:42:12,830 --> 02:42:12,840
that all of these possibilities look
 

8521
02:42:12,840 --> 02:42:14,590
that all of these possibilities look
possible but they don't look they're not

8522
02:42:14,590 --> 02:42:14,600
possible but they don't look they're not
 

8523
02:42:14,600 --> 02:42:15,910
possible but they don't look they're not
possible for you because you're

8524
02:42:15,910 --> 02:42:15,920
possible for you because you're
 

8525
02:42:15,920 --> 02:42:18,070
possible for you because you're
constrained by this giant like causal

8526
02:42:18,070 --> 02:42:18,080
constrained by this giant like causal
 

8527

structural history

8528
02:42:20,150 --> 02:42:20,160
structural history
 

8529
02:42:20,160 --> 02:42:22,990
structural history
um so you can't live in all those

8530
02:42:22,990 --> 02:42:23,000
um so you can't live in all those
 

8531
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,269
um so you can't live in all those
universes you'd have to go all the way

8532
02:42:25,269 --> 02:42:25,279
universes you'd have to go all the way
 

8533
02:42:25,279 --> 02:42:27,230
universes you'd have to go all the way
back to the very beginning of the

8534
02:42:27,230 --> 02:42:27,240
back to the very beginning of the
 

8535
02:42:27,240 --> 02:42:29,070
back to the very beginning of the
universe and retrace everything again to

8536
02:42:29,070 --> 02:42:29,080
universe and retrace everything again to
 

8537
02:42:29,080 --> 02:42:30,469
universe and retrace everything again to
be a different you so where's the source

8538
02:42:30,469 --> 02:42:30,479
be a different you so where's the source
 

8539
02:42:30,479 --> 02:42:33,910
be a different you so where's the source
of the Free Will for the macro object um

8540
02:42:33,910 --> 02:42:33,920
of the Free Will for the macro object um
 

8541
02:42:33,920 --> 02:42:36,269
of the Free Will for the macro object um
it's the fact that your deterministic

8542
02:42:36,269 --> 02:42:36,279
it's the fact that your deterministic
 

8543
02:42:36,279 --> 02:42:38,830
it's the fact that your deterministic
structure living in a random background

8544
02:42:38,830 --> 02:42:38,840
structure living in a random background
 

8545
02:42:38,840 --> 02:42:40,750
structure living in a random background
and also all of that selection bundled

8546
02:42:40,750 --> 02:42:40,760
and also all of that selection bundled
 

8547
02:42:40,760 --> 02:42:42,630
and also all of that selection bundled
in you allows you to select on possible

8548
02:42:42,630 --> 02:42:42,640
in you allows you to select on possible
 

8549
02:42:42,640 --> 02:42:44,269
in you allows you to select on possible
Futures so that's where your will comes

8550
02:42:44,269 --> 02:42:44,279
Futures so that's where your will comes
 

8551
02:42:44,279 --> 02:42:45,910
Futures so that's where your will comes
from and there's just always a little

8552
02:42:45,910 --> 02:42:45,920
from and there's just always a little
 

8553
02:42:45,920 --> 02:42:47,389
from and there's just always a little
bit of Randomness because the universe

8554
02:42:47,389 --> 02:42:47,399
bit of Randomness because the universe
 

8555
02:42:47,399 --> 02:42:50,950
bit of Randomness because the universe
is getting bigger and you know like uh

8556
02:42:50,950 --> 02:42:50,960
is getting bigger and you know like uh
 

8557
02:42:50,960 --> 02:42:53,230
is getting bigger and you know like uh
this idea that the past is in the

8558
02:42:53,230 --> 02:42:53,240
this idea that the past is in the
 

8559
02:42:53,240 --> 02:42:55,590
this idea that the past is in the
present is not large enough yet to

02:42:55,590 --> 02:42:55,600
present is not large enough yet to
 

8561
02:42:55,600 --> 02:42:58,269
present is not large enough yet to
contain the future the extra structure

8562
02:42:58,269 --> 02:42:58,279
contain the future the extra structure
 

8563
02:42:58,279 --> 02:43:00,790
contain the future the extra structure
has to come from somewhere um and some

8564
02:43:00,790 --> 02:43:00,800
has to come from somewhere um and some
 

8565
02:43:00,800 --> 02:43:03,110
has to come from somewhere um and some
of that is because outside of those

8566
02:43:03,110 --> 02:43:03,120
of that is because outside of those
 

8567
02:43:03,120 --> 02:43:05,670
of that is because outside of those
giant causal structures that are things

8568
02:43:05,670 --> 02:43:05,680
giant causal structures that are things
 

8569
02:43:05,680 --> 02:43:09,349
giant causal structures that are things
like us it's fucking random out

8570
02:43:09,349 --> 02:43:09,359
like us it's fucking random out
 

8571
02:43:09,359 --> 02:43:11,590
like us it's fucking random out
there and it's scary and we're all

8572
02:43:11,590 --> 02:43:11,600
there and it's scary and we're all
 

8573
02:43:11,600 --> 02:43:12,830
there and it's scary and we're all
hanging on to each other because the

hanging on to each other because the
only way to hang on to each other like

8576
02:43:14,670 --> 02:43:14,680
only way to hang on to each other like
 

8577
02:43:14,680 --> 02:43:16,590
only way to hang on to each other like
the only way to exist is to like cling

8578
02:43:16,590 --> 02:43:16,600
the only way to exist is to like cling
 

8579
02:43:16,600 --> 02:43:18,710
the only way to exist is to like cling
on to all of these causal structures

02:43:18,720 --> 02:43:20,590
on to all of these causal structures
that we have happen to co-inhabit

8582
02:43:20,590 --> 02:43:20,600
that we have happen to co-inhabit
 

8583
02:43:20,600 --> 02:43:22,550
that we have happen to co-inhabit

02:43:24,439 --> 02:43:27,550
reinforcing each other's
existence all the selection bundled in

consistent with that I don't know what I

8592
02:43:31,030 --> 02:43:31,040
consistent with that I don't know what I
 

8593
02:43:31,040 --> 02:43:32,950
consistent with that I don't know what I
think about that that's complicated to

8594
02:43:32,950 --> 02:43:32,960
think about that that's complicated to
 

8595
02:43:32,960 --> 02:43:34,790
think about that that's complicated to
imagine just that little bit of

8596
02:43:34,790 --> 02:43:34,800
imagine just that little bit of
 

8597
02:43:34,800 --> 02:43:38,389
imagine just that little bit of
Randomness is enough okay well it's also

8598
02:43:38,389 --> 02:43:38,399
Randomness is enough okay well it's also
 

8599
02:43:38,399 --> 02:43:39,910
Randomness is enough okay well it's also
it's not just the randomness there's two

8600
02:43:39,910 --> 02:43:39,920
it's not just the randomness there's two
 

8601
02:43:39,920 --> 02:43:41,429
it's not just the randomness there's two
features one is the randomness helps

8602
02:43:41,429 --> 02:43:41,439
features one is the randomness helps
 

8603
02:43:41,439 --> 02:43:43,030
features one is the randomness helps
generate some novelty and some

8604
02:43:43,030 --> 02:43:43,040
generate some novelty and some
 

8605
02:43:43,040 --> 02:43:45,670
generate some novelty and some
flexibility but it's also that like

8606
02:43:45,670 --> 02:43:45,680
flexibility but it's also that like
 

8607
02:43:45,680 --> 02:43:47,150
flexibility but it's also that like
because you you're you're the structure

8608
02:43:47,150 --> 02:43:47,160
because you you're you're the structure
 

8609
02:43:47,160 --> 02:43:49,349
because you you're you're the structure
that's deep in time you have this common

8610
02:43:49,349 --> 02:43:49,359
that's deep in time you have this common
 

8611
02:43:49,359 --> 02:43:53,030
that's deep in time you have this common
tutorial history that's you and uh I

8612
02:43:53,030 --> 02:43:53,040
tutorial history that's you and uh I
 

8613
02:43:53,040 --> 02:43:55,590
tutorial history that's you and uh I
think about time and assembly Theory not

8614
02:43:55,590 --> 02:43:55,600
think about time and assembly Theory not
 

8615
02:43:55,600 --> 02:43:58,230
think about time and assembly Theory not
as linear time but as comori time so if

8616
02:43:58,230 --> 02:43:58,240
as linear time but as comori time so if
 

8617
02:43:58,240 --> 02:44:00,190
as linear time but as comori time so if
you have all of the structure that

8618
02:44:00,190 --> 02:44:00,200
you have all of the structure that
 

8619
02:44:00,200 --> 02:44:04,590
you have all of the structure that
you're built out of you in principle you

8620
02:44:04,590 --> 02:44:04,600
you're built out of you in principle you
 

8621
02:44:04,600 --> 02:44:06,990
you're built out of you in principle you
know your future can be combinations of

8622
02:44:06,990 --> 02:44:07,000
know your future can be combinations of
 

8623
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:08,309
know your future can be combinations of
that structure you obviously need to

8624
02:44:08,309 --> 02:44:08,319
that structure you obviously need to
 

8625
02:44:08,319 --> 02:44:10,269
that structure you obviously need to
persist yourself as a coherent you so

8626
02:44:10,269 --> 02:44:10,279
persist yourself as a coherent you so
 

8627
02:44:10,279 --> 02:44:13,110
persist yourself as a coherent you so
you want to optimize for a Comin like a

8628
02:44:13,110 --> 02:44:13,120
you want to optimize for a Comin like a
 

8629
02:44:13,120 --> 02:44:15,990
you want to optimize for a Comin like a
a a future in that combinatorial space

8630
02:44:15,990 --> 02:44:16,000
a a future in that combinatorial space
 

8631
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:19,590
a a future in that combinatorial space
that still includes you um most of the

8632
02:44:19,590 --> 02:44:19,600
that still includes you um most of the
 

8633
02:44:19,600 --> 02:44:21,630
that still includes you um most of the
time for most of us

8634
02:44:21,630 --> 02:44:21,640
time for most of us
 

8635
02:44:21,640 --> 02:44:25,349
time for most of us
um and um and when you make those kinds

8636
02:44:25,349 --> 02:44:25,359
um and um and when you make those kinds
 

8637
02:44:25,359 --> 02:44:26,950
um and um and when you make those kinds
and then that gives you a space to

8638
02:44:26,950 --> 02:44:26,960
and then that gives you a space to
 

8639
02:44:26,960 --> 02:44:29,910
and then that gives you a space to
operate in uh and that's your sort of

8640
02:44:29,910 --> 02:44:29,920
operate in uh and that's your sort of
 

8641
02:44:29,920 --> 02:44:32,830
operate in uh and that's your sort of
horizon where your free will can operate

8642
02:44:32,830 --> 02:44:32,840
horizon where your free will can operate
 

8643
02:44:32,840 --> 02:44:33,830
horizon where your free will can operate
and your free will can't be

8644
02:44:33,830 --> 02:44:33,840
and your free will can't be
 

8645
02:44:33,840 --> 02:44:35,870
and your free will can't be
instantaneous so for like ex example

8646
02:44:35,870 --> 02:44:35,880
instantaneous so for like ex example
 

8647
02:44:35,880 --> 02:44:37,710
instantaneous so for like ex example
like I'm sitting here talking to you

8648
02:44:37,710 --> 02:44:37,720
like I'm sitting here talking to you
 

8649
02:44:37,720 --> 02:44:40,070
like I'm sitting here talking to you
right now I can't be in the UK and I

8650
02:44:40,070 --> 02:44:40,080
right now I can't be in the UK and I
 

8651
02:44:40,080 --> 02:44:42,790
right now I can't be in the UK and I
can't be in Arizona but I could plan I

8652
02:44:42,790 --> 02:44:42,800
can't be in Arizona but I could plan I
 

8653
02:44:42,800 --> 02:44:44,550
can't be in Arizona but I could plan I
could execute My Free Will over time

8654
02:44:44,550 --> 02:44:44,560
could execute My Free Will over time
 

8655
02:44:44,560 --> 02:44:46,269
could execute My Free Will over time
because Free Will is a temporal feature

8656
02:44:46,269 --> 02:44:46,279
because Free Will is a temporal feature
 

8657
02:44:46,279 --> 02:44:49,030
because Free Will is a temporal feature
of Life uh to be there you know to

8658
02:44:49,030 --> 02:44:49,040
of Life uh to be there you know to
 

8659
02:44:49,040 --> 02:44:50,790
of Life uh to be there you know to
tomorrow or the or the next day if I

8660
02:44:50,790 --> 02:44:50,800
tomorrow or the or the next day if I
 

8661
02:44:50,800 --> 02:44:52,710
tomorrow or the or the next day if I
wanted to but what about like the

8662
02:44:52,710 --> 02:44:52,720
wanted to but what about like the
 

8663
02:44:52,720 --> 02:44:54,550
wanted to but what about like the
instantaneous decisions you're making

8664
02:44:54,550 --> 02:44:54,560
instantaneous decisions you're making
 

8665
02:44:54,560 --> 02:44:57,150
instantaneous decisions you're making
like to I don't know to put your hand on

8666
02:44:57,150 --> 02:44:57,160
like to I don't know to put your hand on
 

8667
02:44:57,160 --> 02:44:59,309
like to I don't know to put your hand on
the table that's I think those were

8668
02:44:59,309 --> 02:44:59,319
the table that's I think those were
 

8669
02:44:59,319 --> 02:45:01,750
the table that's I think those were
already decided a while ago I don't

8670
02:45:01,750 --> 02:45:01,760
already decided a while ago I don't
 

8671
02:45:01,760 --> 02:45:03,309
already decided a while ago I don't
think that that I don't think Free Will

8672
02:45:03,309 --> 02:45:03,319
think that that I don't think Free Will
 

8673
02:45:03,319 --> 02:45:06,110
think that that I don't think Free Will
is ever instantaneous but on a longer

8674
02:45:06,110 --> 02:45:06,120
is ever instantaneous but on a longer
 

8675
02:45:06,120 --> 02:45:09,110
is ever instantaneous but on a longer
time Horizon yep there's some kind of

8676
02:45:09,110 --> 02:45:09,120
time Horizon yep there's some kind of
 

8677
02:45:09,120 --> 02:45:12,070
time Horizon yep there's some kind of
steering going on

8678
02:45:12,070 --> 02:45:12,080
steering going on
 

8679
02:45:12,080 --> 02:45:15,150
steering going on
mhm and who's doing the steering you

8680
02:45:15,150 --> 02:45:15,160
mhm and who's doing the steering you
 

8681
02:45:15,160 --> 02:45:17,790
mhm and who's doing the steering you
are and you being this macro object

8682
02:45:17,790 --> 02:45:17,800
are and you being this macro object
 

8683
02:45:17,800 --> 02:45:19,790
are and you being this macro object
that's

8684
02:45:19,790 --> 02:45:19,800
that's
 

8685
02:45:19,800 --> 02:45:22,950
that's
encompasses or you being

8686
02:45:22,950 --> 02:45:22,960
encompasses or you being
 

8687
02:45:22,960 --> 02:45:26,150

Lex whatever you want to call

8688
02:45:26,150 --> 02:45:26,160
Lex whatever you want to call
 

8689
02:45:26,160 --> 02:45:29,870
Lex whatever you want to call
it there there you are assigning words

8690
02:45:29,870 --> 02:45:29,880
it there there you are assigning words
 

8691
02:45:29,880 --> 02:45:32,870
it there there you are assigning words
to things once again I know why does

8692
02:45:32,870 --> 02:45:32,880
to things once again I know why does
 

8693
02:45:32,880 --> 02:45:34,630
to things once again I know why does
anything exist at

8694
02:45:34,630 --> 02:45:34,640
anything exist at
 

8695
02:45:34,640 --> 02:45:37,990
anything exist at
all you've kind of taken that as a

8696
02:45:37,990 --> 02:45:38,000
all you've kind of taken that as a
 

8697
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,750
all you've kind of taken that as a
starting point yeah it exists I think

8698
02:45:40,750 --> 02:45:40,760
starting point yeah it exists I think
 

8699
02:45:40,760 --> 02:45:43,150
starting point yeah it exists I think
that's the hardest question isn't it

8700
02:45:43,150 --> 02:45:43,160
that's the hardest question isn't it
 

8701
02:45:43,160 --> 02:45:45,190
that's the hardest question isn't it
just hard questions stack on top of each

8702
02:45:45,190 --> 02:45:45,200
just hard questions stack on top of each
 

8703
02:45:45,200 --> 02:45:47,269
just hard questions stack on top of each
other wouldn't it be the same kind of

8704
02:45:47,269 --> 02:45:47,279
other wouldn't it be the same kind of
 

8705
02:45:47,279 --> 02:45:50,070
other wouldn't it be the same kind of
question of what is life it is the same

8706
02:45:50,070 --> 02:45:50,080
question of what is life it is the same
 

8707
02:45:50,080 --> 02:45:51,510
question of what is life it is the same
well that's that's sort of like I try to

8708
02:45:51,510 --> 02:45:51,520
well that's that's sort of like I try to
 

8709
02:45:51,520 --> 02:45:53,230
well that's that's sort of like I try to
fold all of the questions into that

8710
02:45:53,230 --> 02:45:53,240
fold all of the questions into that
 

8711
02:45:53,240 --> 02:45:54,349
fold all of the questions into that
question because I think that one's

8712
02:45:54,349 --> 02:45:54,359
question because I think that one's
 

8713
02:45:54,359 --> 02:45:56,150
question because I think that one's
really hard and I think the nature of

8714
02:45:56,150 --> 02:45:56,160
really hard and I think the nature of
 

8715
02:45:56,160 --> 02:45:57,990
really hard and I think the nature of
existence is really hard you think

8716
02:45:57,990 --> 02:45:58,000
existence is really hard you think
 

8717
02:45:58,000 --> 02:45:59,710
existence is really hard you think
actually like answering what is life

8718
02:45:59,710 --> 02:45:59,720
actually like answering what is life
 

8719
02:45:59,720 --> 02:46:01,710
actually like answering what is life
will help us understand existence maybe

8720
02:46:01,710 --> 02:46:01,720
will help us understand existence maybe
 

8721
02:46:01,720 --> 02:46:02,830
will help us understand existence maybe
maybe

8722
02:46:02,830 --> 02:46:02,840
maybe
 

8723
02:46:02,840 --> 02:46:05,030
maybe
there's it's it's Turtles all the way

8724
02:46:05,030 --> 02:46:05,040
there's it's it's Turtles all the way
 

8725
02:46:05,040 --> 02:46:06,469
there's it's it's Turtles all the way
down it it'll

8726
02:46:06,469 --> 02:46:06,479
down it it'll
 

8727
02:46:06,479 --> 02:46:08,630
down it it'll
just understanding the nature of turtles

8728
02:46:08,630 --> 02:46:08,640
just understanding the nature of turtles
 

8729
02:46:08,640 --> 02:46:11,269
just understanding the nature of turtles
will help us kind of March down even if

8730
02:46:11,269 --> 02:46:11,279
will help us kind of March down even if
 

8731
02:46:11,279 --> 02:46:13,190
will help us kind of March down even if
we don't have the experimental

8732
02:46:13,190 --> 02:46:13,200
we don't have the experimental
 

8733
02:46:13,200 --> 02:46:15,110
we don't have the experimental
methodology of reaching before the bang

8734
02:46:15,110 --> 02:46:15,120
methodology of reaching before the bang
 

8735
02:46:15,120 --> 02:46:18,389
methodology of reaching before the bang
bang right so well I think there's

8736
02:46:18,389 --> 02:46:18,399
bang right so well I think there's
 

8737
02:46:18,399 --> 02:46:20,110
bang right so well I think there's
there's sort of two questions embedded

8738
02:46:20,110 --> 02:46:20,120
there's sort of two questions embedded
 

8739
02:46:20,120 --> 02:46:21,630
there's sort of two questions embedded
here I think the one that we can answer

8740
02:46:21,630 --> 02:46:21,640
here I think the one that we can answer
 

8741
02:46:21,640 --> 02:46:25,269
here I think the one that we can answer
by answering life is why certain things

8742
02:46:25,269 --> 02:46:25,279
by answering life is why certain things
 

8743
02:46:25,279 --> 02:46:28,670
by answering life is why certain things
exist and others don't um but I think

8744
02:46:28,670 --> 02:46:28,680
exist and others don't um but I think
 

8745
02:46:28,680 --> 02:46:30,550
exist and others don't um but I think
the sort of ultimate question the sort

8746
02:46:30,550 --> 02:46:30,560
the sort of ultimate question the sort
 

8747
02:46:30,560 --> 02:46:33,349
the sort of ultimate question the sort
of like prime mover question of why

8748
02:46:33,349 --> 02:46:33,359
of like prime mover question of why
 

8749
02:46:33,359 --> 02:46:35,190
of like prime mover question of why
anything exists we will not be able to

8750
02:46:35,190 --> 02:46:35,200
anything exists we will not be able to
 

8751
02:46:35,200 --> 02:46:38,510
anything exists we will not be able to
answer what's outside the universe oh

8752
02:46:38,510 --> 02:46:38,520
answer what's outside the universe oh
 

8753
02:46:38,520 --> 02:46:40,910
answer what's outside the universe oh
there's nothing outside the universe so

8754
02:46:40,910 --> 02:46:40,920
there's nothing outside the universe so
 

8755
02:46:40,920 --> 02:46:45,870
there's nothing outside the universe so
I I have a very um I am a very like I am

8756
02:46:45,870 --> 02:46:45,880
I I have a very um I am a very like I am
 

8757
02:46:45,880 --> 02:46:48,190
I I have a very um I am a very like I am
like the most physicalist that like

8758
02:46:48,190 --> 02:46:48,200
like the most physicalist that like
 

8759
02:46:48,200 --> 02:46:50,710
like the most physicalist that like
anyone could be so like for me

8760
02:46:50,710 --> 02:46:50,720
anyone could be so like for me
 

8761
02:46:50,720 --> 02:46:54,630
anyone could be so like for me
everything exists in our universe and

8762
02:46:54,630 --> 02:46:54,640
everything exists in our universe and
 

8763
02:46:54,640 --> 02:46:56,830
everything exists in our universe and
and like I like to like think like

8764
02:46:56,830 --> 02:46:56,840
and like I like to like think like
 

8765
02:46:56,840 --> 02:46:59,230
and like I like to like think like
everything exists here so even when we

8766
02:46:59,230 --> 02:46:59,240
everything exists here so even when we
 

8767
02:46:59,240 --> 02:47:01,389
everything exists here so even when we
talk about the Multiverse I don't like

8768
02:47:01,389 --> 02:47:01,399
talk about the Multiverse I don't like
 

8769
02:47:01,399 --> 02:47:02,670
talk about the Multiverse I don't like
to me it's not like there's all these

8770
02:47:02,670 --> 02:47:02,680
to me it's not like there's all these
 

8771
02:47:02,680 --> 02:47:04,469
to me it's not like there's all these
other universes outside of our universe

8772
02:47:04,469 --> 02:47:04,479
other universes outside of our universe
 

8773
02:47:04,479 --> 02:47:06,990
other universes outside of our universe
that exist the Multiverse is a concept

8774
02:47:06,990 --> 02:47:07,000
that exist the Multiverse is a concept
 

8775
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,670
that exist the Multiverse is a concept
that exists in human Minds here and it

8776
02:47:09,670 --> 02:47:09,680
that exists in human Minds here and it
 

8777
02:47:09,680 --> 02:47:11,910
that exists in human Minds here and it
allows us to have some counterfactual

8778
02:47:11,910 --> 02:47:11,920
allows us to have some counterfactual
 

8779
02:47:11,920 --> 02:47:13,830
allows us to have some counterfactual
reasoning to reason about our own

8780
02:47:13,830 --> 02:47:13,840
reasoning to reason about our own
 

8781
02:47:13,840 --> 02:47:16,230
reasoning to reason about our own
cosmology and therefore it's causal in

8782
02:47:16,230 --> 02:47:16,240
cosmology and therefore it's causal in
 

8783
02:47:16,240 --> 02:47:17,950
cosmology and therefore it's causal in
our biosphere to understanding the

8784
02:47:17,950 --> 02:47:17,960
our biosphere to understanding the
 

8785
02:47:17,960 --> 02:47:20,269
our biosphere to understanding the
reality that live in and building better

8786
02:47:20,269 --> 02:47:20,279
reality that live in and building better
 

8787
02:47:20,279 --> 02:47:21,990
reality that live in and building better
theories but I don't think that the

8788
02:47:21,990 --> 02:47:22,000
theories but I don't think that the
 

8789
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,510
theories but I don't think that the
Multiverse is something like and and

8790
02:47:24,510 --> 02:47:24,520
Multiverse is something like and and
 

8791
02:47:24,520 --> 02:47:26,070
Multiverse is something like and and
also math like I don't think there's a

8792
02:47:26,070 --> 02:47:26,080
also math like I don't think there's a
 

8793
02:47:26,080 --> 02:47:28,269
also math like I don't think there's a
platonic world that mathematical things

8794
02:47:28,269 --> 02:47:28,279
platonic world that mathematical things
 

8795
02:47:28,279 --> 02:47:30,910
platonic world that mathematical things
live in I think mathematical things are

8796
02:47:30,910 --> 02:47:30,920
live in I think mathematical things are
 

8797
02:47:30,920 --> 02:47:33,190
live in I think mathematical things are
here on this planet like I don't think

8798
02:47:33,190 --> 02:47:33,200
here on this planet like I don't think
 

8799
02:47:33,200 --> 02:47:35,309
here on this planet like I don't think
it makes sense to talk about things that

8800
02:47:35,309 --> 02:47:35,319
it makes sense to talk about things that
 

8801
02:47:35,319 --> 02:47:37,070
it makes sense to talk about things that
exist outside of the universe if you're

8802
02:47:37,070 --> 02:47:37,080
exist outside of the universe if you're
 

8803
02:47:37,080 --> 02:47:38,870
exist outside of the universe if you're
talking about them you're already

8804
02:47:38,870 --> 02:47:38,880
talking about them you're already
 

8805
02:47:38,880 --> 02:47:40,150
talking about them you're already
talking about something that exists

8806
02:47:40,150 --> 02:47:40,160
talking about something that exists
 

8807
02:47:40,160 --> 02:47:41,670
talking about something that exists
inside the universe and is part of the

8808
02:47:41,670 --> 02:47:41,680
inside the universe and is part of the
 

8809
02:47:41,680 --> 02:47:42,990
inside the universe and is part of the
universe and is part of like what the

8810
02:47:42,990 --> 02:47:43,000
universe and is part of like what the
 

8811
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,590
universe and is part of like what the
universe is building it all originates

8812
02:47:45,590 --> 02:47:45,600
universe is building it all originates
 

8813
02:47:45,600 --> 02:47:47,469
universe is building it all originates
here it all exists here in some I mean

8814
02:47:47,469 --> 02:47:47,479
here it all exists here in some I mean
 

8815
02:47:47,479 --> 02:47:49,469
here it all exists here in some I mean
what else would there be

8816
02:47:49,469 --> 02:47:49,479
what else would there be
 

8817
02:47:49,479 --> 02:47:52,070
what else would there be
there could be things you can't possibly

8818
02:47:52,070 --> 02:47:52,080
there could be things you can't possibly
 

8819
02:47:52,080 --> 02:47:53,750
there could be things you can't possibly
understand outside of all of this that

8820
02:47:53,750 --> 02:47:53,760
understand outside of all of this that
 

8821
02:47:53,760 --> 02:47:55,670
understand outside of all of this that
we call the universe and you can say

8822
02:47:55,670 --> 02:47:55,680
we call the universe and you can say
 

8823
02:47:55,680 --> 02:47:56,710
we call the universe and you can say
that and that's an interesting

8824
02:47:56,710 --> 02:47:56,720
that and that's an interesting
 

8825
02:47:56,720 --> 02:47:58,510
that and that's an interesting
philosophy but again this is sort of

8826
02:47:58,510 --> 02:47:58,520
philosophy but again this is sort of
 

8827
02:47:58,520 --> 02:48:00,070
philosophy but again this is sort of
like pushing on the boundaries of like

8828
02:48:00,070 --> 02:48:00,080
like pushing on the boundaries of like
 

8829
02:48:00,080 --> 02:48:01,910
like pushing on the boundaries of like
the way that we understand things I

8830
02:48:01,910 --> 02:48:01,920
the way that we understand things I
 

8831
02:48:01,920 --> 02:48:04,389
the way that we understand things I
think it's more constructive to say the

8832
02:48:04,389 --> 02:48:04,399
think it's more constructive to say the
 

8833
02:48:04,399 --> 02:48:05,830
think it's more constructive to say the
fact that I can talk about those things

8834
02:48:05,830 --> 02:48:05,840
fact that I can talk about those things
 

8835
02:48:05,840 --> 02:48:07,150
fact that I can talk about those things
is telling me something about the

8836
02:48:07,150 --> 02:48:07,160
is telling me something about the
 

8837
02:48:07,160 --> 02:48:08,790
is telling me something about the
structure of where I actually live and

8838
02:48:08,790 --> 02:48:08,800
structure of where I actually live and
 

8839
02:48:08,800 --> 02:48:10,230
structure of where I actually live and
where I exist just because it's more

8840
02:48:10,230 --> 02:48:10,240
where I exist just because it's more
 

8841
02:48:10,240 --> 02:48:12,150
where I exist just because it's more
constructive doesn't mean it's

8842
02:48:12,150 --> 02:48:12,160
constructive doesn't mean it's
 

8843
02:48:12,160 --> 02:48:16,349
constructive doesn't mean it's
true well it may not be true it may be

8844
02:48:16,349 --> 02:48:16,359
true well it may not be true it may be
 

8845
02:48:16,359 --> 02:48:18,070
true well it may not be true it may be
something that allows me to build better

8846
02:48:18,070 --> 02:48:18,080
something that allows me to build better
 

8847
02:48:18,080 --> 02:48:20,269
something that allows me to build better
theories I can test to try to understand

8848
02:48:20,269 --> 02:48:20,279
theories I can test to try to understand
 

8849
02:48:20,279 --> 02:48:22,230
theories I can test to try to understand
something objective and in the end

8850
02:48:22,230 --> 02:48:22,240
something objective and in the end
 

8851
02:48:22,240 --> 02:48:25,150
something objective and in the end
that's a good way to get to the truth

8852
02:48:25,150 --> 02:48:25,160
that's a good way to get to the truth
 

8853
02:48:25,160 --> 02:48:27,790
that's a good way to get to the truth
exactly even if you realiz I can't do

8854
02:48:27,790 --> 02:48:27,800
exactly even if you realiz I can't do
 

8855
02:48:27,800 --> 02:48:30,230
exactly even if you realiz I can't do
experiment yeah so there's no such thing

8856
02:48:30,230 --> 02:48:30,240
experiment yeah so there's no such thing
 

8857
02:48:30,240 --> 02:48:33,110
experiment yeah so there's no such thing
as experimental platonism but if you

8858
02:48:33,110 --> 02:48:33,120
as experimental platonism but if you
 

8859
02:48:33,120 --> 02:48:35,030
as experimental platonism but if you
think math is an object that emerg in

8860
02:48:35,030 --> 02:48:35,040
think math is an object that emerg in
 

8861
02:48:35,040 --> 02:48:36,389
think math is an object that emerg in
our biosphere you can start

8862
02:48:36,389 --> 02:48:36,399
our biosphere you can start
 

8863
02:48:36,399 --> 02:48:38,870
our biosphere you can start
experimenting with that

8864
02:48:38,870 --> 02:48:38,880
experimenting with that
 

8865
02:48:38,880 --> 02:48:40,830
experimenting with that
idea and that to me is really

8866
02:48:40,830 --> 02:48:40,840
idea and that to me is really
 

8867
02:48:40,840 --> 02:48:43,030
idea and that to me is really
interesting like to think about well

8868
02:48:43,030 --> 02:48:43,040
interesting like to think about well
 

8869
02:48:43,040 --> 02:48:44,550
interesting like to think about well
people I mean mathematicians do think

8870
02:48:44,550 --> 02:48:44,560
people I mean mathematicians do think
 

8871
02:48:44,560 --> 02:48:46,070
people I mean mathematicians do think
about math sometimes as an experimental

8872
02:48:46,070 --> 02:48:46,080
about math sometimes as an experimental
 

8873
02:48:46,080 --> 02:48:48,870
about math sometimes as an experimental
science but to think about math itself

8874
02:48:48,870 --> 02:48:48,880
science but to think about math itself
 

8875
02:48:48,880 --> 02:48:54,510
science but to think about math itself
as a a a object for study by physicists

8876
02:48:54,510 --> 02:48:54,520
as a a a object for study by physicists
 

8877
02:48:54,520 --> 02:48:56,190
as a a a object for study by physicists
rather than a tool physicists use to

8878
02:48:56,190 --> 02:48:56,200
rather than a tool physicists use to
 

8879
02:48:56,200 --> 02:48:58,630
rather than a tool physicists use to
describe reality it becomes the part of

8880
02:48:58,630 --> 02:48:58,640
describe reality it becomes the part of
 

8881
02:48:58,640 --> 02:49:00,469
describe reality it becomes the part of
reality they're trying to describe to me

8882
02:49:00,469 --> 02:49:00,479
reality they're trying to describe to me
 

8883
02:49:00,479 --> 02:49:02,349
reality they're trying to describe to me
is a deeply interesting inversion what

8884
02:49:02,349 --> 02:49:02,359
is a deeply interesting inversion what
 

8885
02:49:02,359 --> 02:49:04,269
is a deeply interesting inversion what
to you is most beautiful

8886
02:49:04,269 --> 02:49:04,279
to you is most beautiful
 

8887
02:49:04,279 --> 02:49:06,830
to you is most beautiful
about this kind of exploration of the

8888
02:49:06,830 --> 02:49:06,840
about this kind of exploration of the
 

8889
02:49:06,840 --> 02:49:10,070
about this kind of exploration of the
physics of life that you've been doing

8890
02:49:10,070 --> 02:49:10,080
physics of life that you've been doing
 

8891
02:49:10,080 --> 02:49:14,190
physics of life that you've been doing
um I love the way it makes me

8892
02:49:14,190 --> 02:49:14,200

 

8893
02:49:14,200 --> 02:49:17,590

feel and then you have to try to convert

8894
02:49:17,590 --> 02:49:17,600
feel and then you have to try to convert
 

8895
02:49:17,600 --> 02:49:19,670
feel and then you have to try to convert
the feelings into visuals and the

8896
02:49:19,670 --> 02:49:19,680
the feelings into visuals and the
 

8897
02:49:19,680 --> 02:49:21,870
the feelings into visuals and the
visuals into words yeah so I think I

8898
02:49:21,870 --> 02:49:21,880
visuals into words yeah so I think I
 

8899
02:49:21,880 --> 02:49:24,309
visuals into words yeah so I think I
love um yeah I love the way it makes me

8900
02:49:24,309 --> 02:49:24,319
love um yeah I love the way it makes me
 

8901
02:49:24,319 --> 02:49:26,309
love um yeah I love the way it makes me
feel to have

8902
02:49:26,309 --> 02:49:26,319
feel to have
 

8903
02:49:26,319 --> 02:49:28,950
feel to have
ideas um that I think are

8904
02:49:28,950 --> 02:49:28,960
ideas um that I think are
 

8905
02:49:28,960 --> 02:49:31,950
ideas um that I think are
novel and I think the the Dual side of

8906
02:49:31,950 --> 02:49:31,960
novel and I think the the Dual side of
 

8907
02:49:31,960 --> 02:49:33,950
novel and I think the the Dual side of
that is the painful process of trying to

8908
02:49:33,950 --> 02:49:33,960
that is the painful process of trying to
 

8909
02:49:33,960 --> 02:49:35,790
that is the painful process of trying to
communicate that with other human beings

8910
02:49:35,790 --> 02:49:35,800
communicate that with other human beings
 

8911
02:49:35,800 --> 02:49:37,830
communicate that with other human beings
to test if they have any kind of reality

8912
02:49:37,830 --> 02:49:37,840
to test if they have any kind of reality
 

8913
02:49:37,840 --> 02:49:41,670
to test if they have any kind of reality
to them uh and I also love that process

8914
02:49:41,670 --> 02:49:41,680
to them uh and I also love that process
 

8915
02:49:41,680 --> 02:49:44,110
to them uh and I also love that process
I love trying to figure out how to

8916
02:49:44,110 --> 02:49:44,120
I love trying to figure out how to
 

8917
02:49:44,120 --> 02:49:47,190
I love trying to figure out how to
explain really deep abstract things that

8918
02:49:47,190 --> 02:49:47,200
explain really deep abstract things that
 

8919
02:49:47,200 --> 02:49:49,389
explain really deep abstract things that
I don't think that we understand

8920
02:49:49,389 --> 02:49:49,399
I don't think that we understand
 

8921
02:49:49,399 --> 02:49:51,070
I don't think that we understand
and trying to understand them with other

8922
02:49:51,070 --> 02:49:51,080
and trying to understand them with other
 

8923
02:49:51,080 --> 02:49:53,990
and trying to understand them with other
people and I also love the shock value

8924
02:49:53,990 --> 02:49:54,000
people and I also love the shock value
 

8925
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:57,670
people and I also love the shock value
of uh you like this kind of idea we were

8926
02:49:57,670 --> 02:49:57,680
of uh you like this kind of idea we were
 

8927
02:49:57,680 --> 02:49:59,030
of uh you like this kind of idea we were
talking about before of like being on

8928
02:49:59,030 --> 02:49:59,040
talking about before of like being on
 

8929
02:49:59,040 --> 02:50:01,590
talking about before of like being on
the boundary of like what we understand

8930
02:50:01,590 --> 02:50:01,600
the boundary of like what we understand
 

8931
02:50:01,600 --> 02:50:03,229
the boundary of like what we understand
and so people can kind of see what

8932
02:50:03,229 --> 02:50:03,239
and so people can kind of see what
 

8933
02:50:03,239 --> 02:50:04,990
and so people can kind of see what
you're seeing but they haven't ever saw

8934
02:50:04,990 --> 02:50:05,000
you're seeing but they haven't ever saw
 

8935
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:08,590
you're seeing but they haven't ever saw
it that way before and I I I love the

8936
02:50:08,590 --> 02:50:08,600
it that way before and I I I love the
 

8937
02:50:08,600 --> 02:50:10,630
it that way before and I I I love the
shock value that like people have like

8938
02:50:10,630 --> 02:50:10,640
shock value that like people have like
 

8939
02:50:10,640 --> 02:50:12,269
shock value that like people have like
that immediate moment of recognizing

8940
02:50:12,269 --> 02:50:12,279
that immediate moment of recognizing
 

8941
02:50:12,279 --> 02:50:13,630
that immediate moment of recognizing
that there's something beyond the way

8942
02:50:13,630 --> 02:50:13,640
that there's something beyond the way
 

8943
02:50:13,640 --> 02:50:15,429
that there's something beyond the way
that they thought about things before

8944
02:50:15,429 --> 02:50:15,439
that they thought about things before
 

8945
02:50:15,439 --> 02:50:17,309
that they thought about things before
and being able to deliver that to people

8946
02:50:17,309 --> 02:50:17,319
and being able to deliver that to people
 

8947
02:50:17,319 --> 02:50:19,150
and being able to deliver that to people
I think is one of the biggest Jo that I

8948
02:50:19,150 --> 02:50:19,160
I think is one of the biggest Jo that I
 

8949
02:50:19,160 --> 02:50:21,229
I think is one of the biggest Jo that I
have is just like and maybe it's that

8950
02:50:21,229 --> 02:50:21,239
have is just like and maybe it's that
 

8951
02:50:21,239 --> 02:50:23,510
have is just like and maybe it's that
sense of mystery like to share that

8952
02:50:23,510 --> 02:50:23,520
sense of mystery like to share that
 

8953
02:50:23,520 --> 02:50:24,950
sense of mystery like to share that
there's something beyond the frontier of

8954
02:50:24,950 --> 02:50:24,960
there's something beyond the frontier of
 

8955
02:50:24,960 --> 02:50:26,309
there's something beyond the frontier of
how we understand and we might be able

8956
02:50:26,309 --> 02:50:26,319
how we understand and we might be able
 

8957
02:50:26,319 --> 02:50:29,150
how we understand and we might be able
to see it and you get to see the humans

8958
02:50:29,150 --> 02:50:29,160
to see it and you get to see the humans
 

8959
02:50:29,160 --> 02:50:33,030
to see it and you get to see the humans
transformed by a new idea yes and I

transforms the way that we think like
 

8969
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:44,469
transforms the way that we think like
you know I have my problem I want to

8970
02:50:44,469 --> 02:50:44,479
you know I have my problem I want to
 

8971
