1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,983
- The whole point

2
00:00:00,983 --> 00:00:03,660
of relativity is to say there's
no such thing as right now

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,520
when you're far away.

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,520
And that is doubly true for
what's inside a black hole.

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,920
And you might think, well,
the galaxy is very big.

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,000
It's really not.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,110
It's some tens of thousands
of light years across

8
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,420
and billions of years old.

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,840
So you don't need to
move at a high fraction

10
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,310
of the speed of light to fill the galaxy.

11
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,070
- The number of worlds is-

12
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:26,903
- [Sean] Very big.

13
00:00:26,903 --> 00:00:29,820
- Very, very, very big.

14
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,790
Where do those worlds fit?

15
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,050
Where they go?

16
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,403
- The short answer is,

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,473
the worlds don't exist in space.

18
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,633
Space exists separately in each world.

19
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,240
- The following is a
conversation with Sean Carroll,

20
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,310
his third time in this podcast.

21
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,940
He is a theoretical
physicist at John Hopkins,

22
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,240
host of the Mindscape Podcast
that I personally love

23
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,440
and highly recommend,

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,030
and author of many books,

25
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,620
including the most recent book series

26
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,830
called "The Biggest
Ideas in the Universe,"

27
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,190
the first book of which is
titled "Space, Time, and Motion,"

28
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,857
and it's on the topic
of general relativity.

29
00:01:13,857 --> 00:01:17,267
And the second coming out on May 14th,

30
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:19,590
so you should definitely pre-order it,

31
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,960
is titled "Quanta and Fields."

32
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,750
And that one is on the
topic of quantum mechanics.

33
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,200
Sean is a legit, active,
theoretical physicist,

34
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,650
and at the same time is one
of the greatest communicators

35
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,063
of physics ever.

36
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,300
I highly encourage you
listen to his podcast,

37
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,500
read his books,

38
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,650
and pre-order the new
book to support his work.

39
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,530
This was, as always, a big honor

40
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,240
and a pleasure for me.

41
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,130
This is Lex Fridman Podcast.

42
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:47,963
To support it,

43
00:01:47,963 --> 00:01:50,490
please check out our
sponsors in the description.

44
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,200
And now, dear friends,

45
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,123
here's Sean Carroll.

46
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,647
In book one of the series,

47
00:01:56,647 --> 00:01:58,230
"The Biggest Ideas in the Universe,"

48
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,120
called "Space, Time and Motion,"

49
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,490
you take on classical mechanics,

50
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,510
general relativity by
taking on the main equation

51
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,440
of general relativity

52
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,260
and making it accessible,
easy to understand.

53
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,410
So maybe at the high level,

54
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,510
what is general relativity?

55
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,810
What's a good way to start
to try to explain it?

56
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,070
- Probably the best way to start to try

57
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,140
to explain it is special relativity,

58
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,183
which came first, 1905.

59
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,690
It was the culmination of many decades

60
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:28,890
of people putting things together.

61
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,710
But it was Einstein in 1905.

62
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,850
In fact, it wasn't even Einstein.

63
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:36,540
I should give more credit
to Minkowski in 1907.

64
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,340
So Einstein in 1905 figured out

65
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,520
that you could get rid of the ether,

66
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,860
the idea of a rest frame for the universe,

67
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,040
and all the equations of
physics would make sense

68
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,980
with the speed of light being a maximum.

69
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,420
But then it was Minkowski,

70
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,760
who used to be Einstein's
professor in 1907,

71
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,440
who realized the most elegant way

72
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,090
of thinking about this idea of
Einstein's was to blend space

73
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,670
and time together into spacetime

74
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,940
to really imagine that there is no hard

75
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,820
and fast division of the
four dimensional world

76
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,880
in which we live into
space and time separately.

77
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,180
Einstein was at first dismissive of this.

78
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,013
He thought it was just like,

79
00:03:16,013 --> 00:03:19,080
oh, the mathematicians
are overformalizing again.

80
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,970
But then he later realized
that if spacetime is a thing,

81
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,650
it can have properties

82
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,480
and in particular it can have a geometry.

83
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,580
It can be curved from place to place.

84
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,400
And that was what let him
solve the problem of gravity.

85
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,690
He had previously been
trying to fit in what we knew

86
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,840
about gravity from Newtonian mechanics,

87
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,030
the inverse square law of gravity

88
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,710
to his new relativistic theory.

89
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,880
It didn't work.

90
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,920
So the final leap was to say,

91
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,310
gravity is the curvature of spacetime.

92
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,010
And that statement is
basically general relativity.

93
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,760
- And the tension with Minkowski
was he was a mathematician.

94
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,666
- [Sean] Yes.

95
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,430
- So it's the tension between
physics and mathematics.

96
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,400
In fact, in your lecture
about this equation,

97
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,050
one of them,

98
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:08,160
you say that Einstein
is a better physicist

99
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,690
than he gets credit for.

100
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:10,523
- Yep.

101
00:04:10,523 --> 00:04:11,910
(Sean laughs)

102
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,743
- I know that's hard.

103
00:04:12,743 --> 00:04:14,436
That's a little bit of
a joke there, right?

104
00:04:14,436 --> 00:04:15,269
- [Lex] Yeah.

105
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:17,160
- Because we all give
Einstein a lot of credit.

106
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,790
But then we also, partly based on fact

107
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,860
but partly to make ourselves feel better,

108
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,090
tell ourselves a story about

109
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,600
how later in life
Einstein couldn't keep up.

110
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,580
There were younger people
doing quantum mechanics

111
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,320
and quantum field theory
and particle physics,

112
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,270
and he was just sort of unable

113
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,960
to really philosophically get
over his objections to that.

114
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,120
And I think that that story

115
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,520
about the latter part is completely wrong,

116
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,380
like almost 180 degrees wrong.

117
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,920
I think that Einstein
understood quantum mechanics

118
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,600
as well as anyone,

119
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,520
at least up through the 1930s.

120
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,820
I think that his philosophical
objections to it are correct.

121
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,340
So he should actually
have been taken much more

122
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,050
seriously about that.

123
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,820
And what he did,

124
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,680
what he achieved in trying

125
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,510
to think these problems through,

126
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,180
is to really basically understand the idea

127
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,740
of quantum entanglement,

128
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,290
which is kind of important
these days when it comes

129
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,240
to understanding quantum mechanics.

130
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,210
Now, it's true that in
the forties and fifties,

131
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,330
he placed his efforts in hopes

132
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,910
for unifying electricity
and magnetism with gravity.

133
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,310
That didn't really work out very well.

134
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,010
All of us try things that don't work out.

135
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,150
I don't hold that against him.

136
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,070
But in terms of IQ points,

137
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,560
in terms of trying to be a
clear thinking physicist,

138
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,300
he was really, really great.

139
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,700
- What does greatness
look like for a physicist?

140
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,690
So how difficult is it

141
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,550
to take the leap from special relativity

142
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,300
to general relativity?

143
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,500
How difficult is it to imagine that

144
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,390
to consider spacetime together

145
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:52,143
and to imagine that there's a
curvature to this whole thing?

146
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,230
- Yeah, that's a great question.

147
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,250
I think that if you want

148
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,080
to make the case Einstein's greatness,

149
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,700
which is not hard to do,

150
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,810
there's two things you point at.

151
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,270
One is in 1905,

152
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,880
his famous miracle year,

153
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,390
he writes three different papers

154
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,700
on three wildly different subjects,

155
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,090
all of which would make you famous

156
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,690
just for writing that one paper.

157
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,100
Special relativity is one of them.

158
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,080
Brownian motion is another one,

159
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,120
which is just the little vibrations

160
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,520
of tiny little dust specs in the air.

161
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,690
But who cares about that?

162
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,330
What matters is it proves
the existence of atoms.

163
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,980
He explains Brownian motion

164
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,540
by imagining there are
molecules in the air

165
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,740
and deriving their properties.

166
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,760
Brilliant.

167
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,670
And then he basically starts the world

168
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,610
on the road to quantum
mechanics with his paper on...

169
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,890
Which, again, is given a boring label

170
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,780
of the photoelectric effect.

171
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,570
What it really was is he invented photons.

172
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,390
He showed that light should
be thought of as particles,

173
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,860
as well as waves.

174
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,960
And he did all three of
those very different things

175
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,793
in one year.

176
00:06:55,793 --> 00:06:56,626
Okay.

177
00:06:56,626 --> 00:06:59,190
But the other thing that
gets him genius status is,

178
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,470
like you say, general relativity.

179
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,290
So this takes 10 years from 1905 to 1915.

180
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,850
He wasn't only doing general relativity.

181
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:06,683
He was working on other things.

182
00:07:06,683 --> 00:07:07,516
He wrote...

183
00:07:07,516 --> 00:07:09,180
He invented refrigerator.

184
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,610
He did various interesting things.

185
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,710
and he wasn't even the only
one working on the problem.

186
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:14,580
There were other people

187
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,880
who suggested relativistic
theories of gravity,

188
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,300
but he really applied himself to it.

189
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,080
And I think as your question suggests,

190
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,430
the solution was not a
matter of turning a crank.

191
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,553
It was something fundamentally creative.

192
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,880
In his own telling of the story,

193
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,530
his greatest moment,

194
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,450
his happiest moment was when he realized

195
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,990
that if the way that we would
modern, say, in modern terms,

196
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:46,950
if you were in a rocket
ship accelerating at 1 g

197
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,440
at one acceleration due to gravity,

198
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,820
if the rocket ship were very quiet,

199
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,470
you wouldn't be able
to know the difference

200
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,790
between being in a rocket ship

201
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,680
and being on the surface of the earth.

202
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,190
Gravity is sort of not detectable

203
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,190
or at least not distinguishable
from acceleration.

204
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,023
So number one,

205
00:08:03,023 --> 00:08:04,800
that's a pretty clever thing to think.

206
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,633
But number two,

207
00:08:05,633 --> 00:08:06,510
if you or I had that thought,

208
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,343
we would've gone, "Huh?

209
00:08:07,343 --> 00:08:08,490
We're pretty clever."

210
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:12,000
Heath reasons from there to say,

211
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,880
okay, if gravity is not detectable,

212
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,910
then it can't be like an ordinary force.

213
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,530
The electromagnetic force is detectable.

214
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,600
We can put charge particles around.

215
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,920
Positively charged particles

216
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,860
and negatively charged
particles respond differently

217
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,320
to an electric field
or to a magnetic field.

218
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,140
He realizes that what his
thought experiment showed,

219
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,190
or at least suggested,

220
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,780
is that gravity isn't like that.

221
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:37,590
Everything responds in
the same way to gravity.

222
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,330
How could that be the case?

223
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,250
And then this other leap he makes is, oh,

224
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,440
it's 'cause it's the
curvature of spacetime.

225
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,970
It's a feature of spacetime.

226
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,550
It's not a force on top of it.

227
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,230
And the feature that it is, is curvature.

228
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,070
And then finally,

229
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,570
he says, "Okay.

230
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:55,350
Clearly, I'm gonna need the
mathematical tools necessary

231
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,270
to describe curvature.

232
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,800
I don't know them,

233
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,970
so I will learn them."

234
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:04,110
And they didn't have MOOCs or
AI helpers back in those days.

235
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,270
He had to sit down and
read the math papers,

236
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,430
and he taught himself
differential geometry

237
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,840
and invented general relativity.

238
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,120
- What about the step of including time

239
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,860
as just another dimension?

240
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,070
So combining space and time.

241
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:21,070
Is that a simple mathematical
leap as Minkowski suggested?

242
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:24,180
- It's certainly not simple, actually.

243
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,691
It's a profound insight.

244
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:28,120
That's why I said I think we should give

245
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,170
Minkowski more credit than we do.

246
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,480
He's the one who really
put the finishing touches

247
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,250
on special relativity.

248
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,040
Again, many people had talked about

249
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,540
how things change when you move
close to the speed of light,

250
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,010
what Maxwell's equations

251
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,440
of electromagnetism predict and so forth,

252
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,430
what their symmetries are.

253
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,250
So people like Lorentz, and
FitzGerald, and Lorentz,

254
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,170
there's a story that goes there

255
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,330
and in the usual telling Einstein sort

256
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,100
of puts the capstone on it.

257
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,340
He's the one who says all of
this makes much more sense.

258
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,840
If there just is no ether,

259
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,950
it is undetectable.

260
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,170
We don't know how fast
everything is relative,

261
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,850
thus, the name relativity.

262
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,520
But he didn't take the actual final step,

263
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,340
which was to realize that
the underlying structure

264
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,520
that he had invented is best thought of

265
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,590
as unifying space and time together.

266
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,090
I honestly don't know what was going

267
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,390
through Minkowski's mind
when he thought that.

268
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:25,200
I'm not sure if he was
so mathematically adept

269
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,480
that it was just clear to him,

270
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,770
or he was really struggling it

271
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,000
and he did trial and error for a while.

272
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,930
I'm not sure.

273
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,390
- I mean, do you, for him or Einstein,

274
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,310
visualize the four dimensional space?

275
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:38,580
Try to play with the idea of
time is just another dimension.

276
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,413
- Oh yeah.

277
00:10:39,413 --> 00:10:40,246
All the time.

278
00:10:40,246 --> 00:10:43,110
I mean, we, of course, make
our lives easy by ignoring two

279
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,420
of the dimensions of space.

280
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,920
So instead of four dimensional spacetime,

281
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,070
we just draw pictures of
one dimension of space,

282
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:50,967
one dimension of time,

283
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:53,313
the so-called spacetime diagram.

284
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,890
I mean, maybe this is lurking

285
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:56,723
underneath your question,

286
00:10:56,723 --> 00:11:01,723
but even the best physicists
will draw a vertical axis

287
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:02,970
and a horizontal axis

288
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,880
and we'll go space, time.

289
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,560
But deep down that's wrong

290
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,977
because you're sort of
preferring one direction of space

291
00:11:10,977 --> 00:11:12,810
and one direction of time.

292
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,180
And it's really the whole
two dimensional thing

293
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,260
that is spacetime.

294
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,270
The more legitimate thing

295
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,870
to draw on that picture are rays of light,

296
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,940
are light cones from every point.

297
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,700
There is a fixed direction
at which the speed

298
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,680
of light would represent.

299
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,950
And that is actually
inherent in the structure.

300
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,830
The division into space and
time is something that's easy

301
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,300
for us human beings.

302
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,307
- What is the difference between space

303
00:11:38,307 --> 00:11:41,850
and time from the perspective
of general relativity?

304
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,530
- It's the difference between X and Y

305
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,860
when you draw axis on a piece of paper.

306
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,640
- [Lex] So there's really no difference.

307
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,530
- There's almost no difference.

308
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,690
There's one difference
that is kind of important,

309
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,340
which is the following.

310
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,830
You have a curve in space.

311
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,120
I'm gonna draw it horizontally

312
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,430
'cause that's usually what
we do in spacetime diagrams.

313
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,690
If you have a curve in space,

314
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,700
you've heard the motto before

315
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,810
that the shortest distance

316
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,300
between two points is a straight line.

317
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,550
If you have a curve in time,

318
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,383
which is, by the way,

319
00:12:09,383 --> 00:12:10,980
literally all of our lives.

320
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,480
We all evolve in time.

321
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,580
So you can start with
one event in spacetime

322
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,830
and another event in spacetime.

323
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:19,290
What Minkowski points out is

324
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:22,860
that the time you measure
along your trajectory

325
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,160
in the universe is precisely analogous

326
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,760
to the distance you travel
on a curve through space.

327
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,630
And by precisely,

328
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,970
I mean, it is also true

329
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,680
that the actual distance you travel

330
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,480
through depends on your path.

331
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,070
You can go a straight line,

332
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,500
shortest distance and
curvy line would be longer.

333
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,050
The time you measure in spacetime,

334
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:43,883
the literal time

335
00:12:43,883 --> 00:12:46,380
that takes off on your clock
also depends on your path,

336
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,230
but it depends on it the other way.

337
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,690
So that the longest time

338
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,760
between two points is a straight line.

339
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,652
And if you zig back
and forth in spacetime,

340
00:12:55,652 --> 00:12:57,330
you take less and less time

341
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,830
to go from point A to point B.

342
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,730
- How do we make sense of that?

343
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:05,400
The difference between
the observed reality

344
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,690
and the objective reality
are underneath it,

345
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:12,600
or is objective reality a silly notion

346
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,860
given general relativity?

347
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,480
- I'm a huge believer
in objective reality.

348
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,928
I think that objective
reality, objectivity-

349
00:13:16,928 --> 00:13:17,761
- [Lex] You're a fan.

350
00:13:17,761 --> 00:13:18,594
- Is real.

351
00:13:18,594 --> 00:13:19,427
- [Lex] Yeah.

352
00:13:19,427 --> 00:13:23,010
- But I do think that people kind

353
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,850
of are a little overly
casual about the relationship

354
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,790
between what we observe
and objective reality

355
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,860
in the following sense.

356
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,890
Of course, in order to explain the world,

357
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,000
our starting point

358
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,430
and our ending point is our observations,

359
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,500
our experimental input,

360
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,090
the phenomena we experience

361
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,800
and see around us in the world.

362
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,870
But in between,

363
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,550
there's a theory,

364
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,460
there's a mathematical formalization

365
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,160
of our ideas about what is going on.

366
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,630
And if a theory fits the
data and is very simple

367
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,790
and makes sense in its own terms,

368
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,713
then we say that the theory is right.

369
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:06,090
And that means that we
should attribute some reality

370
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:10,410
to the entities that play an
important role in that theory,

371
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:11,280
at least provisionally

372
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,350
until we can come up with a
better theory down the road.

373
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,330
- I think a nice way
to test the difference

374
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,100
between objective reality

375
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,600
and the observed reality
is what happens at the edge

376
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,150
of the horizon of a black hole.

377
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:29,340
So, technically, as you
get closer to that horizon,

378
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,110
time stands still,

379
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,040
- Yes and no.

380
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,550
It depends on exactly
how careful we are being.

381
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:40,233
So here is a bunch of
things I think are correct.

382
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:45,030
If you imagine there is
a black hole spacetime,

383
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,100
so like the whole solution,
Einstein's equation,

384
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,900
and you treat you and me as
what we call test particles.

385
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,640
So we don't have any
gravitational fields ourselves.

386
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,770
We just move around in
the gravitational field.

387
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,180
And that's obviously an approximation.

388
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,013
Okay?

389
00:14:58,013 --> 00:14:59,430
But let's imagine that.

390
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:03,300
And you stand outside the
black hole and I fall in.

391
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,860
And as I'm falling in,

392
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,180
I'm waving to you

393
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,400
'cause I'm going into the black hole,

394
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,840
you will see me move more and more slowly.

395
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,120
And also the light for me is redshift.

396
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,470
So I kind of look embarrassed

397
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,360
'cause I'm falling into a black hole.

398
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,100
And there is a limit.

399
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,030
There's a last moment that
light will be emitted from me

400
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,790
from your perspective forever.

401
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,623
Okay?

402
00:15:27,623 --> 00:15:29,460
Now, you don't literally see it

403
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:34,140
because I'm emitting photons
more and more slowly, right?

404
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,000
Because from your point of view.

405
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,430
So it's not like I'm equally bright.

406
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:41,460
I basically fade from
view in that picture.

407
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,293
Okay?

408
00:15:42,293 --> 00:15:43,500
So that's one approximation.

409
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,920
The other approximation is I
do have a gravitational field

410
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,753
of my own.

411
00:15:47,753 --> 00:15:50,340
And therefore as I
approach the black hole,

412
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,260
the black hole doesn't just sit there

413
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,460
and let me pass through.

414
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:56,430
It kind of moves out to eat me up

415
00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:01,170
because its net energy mass
is going to be mine plus its.

416
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,670
But roughly speaking,

417
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,503
yes, I think so.

418
00:16:03,503 --> 00:16:05,160
I don't like to go to
the dramatic extremes

419
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,960
because that's where the
approximations break down.

420
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,480
But if you see something
falling into a black hole,

421
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,180
you see it's clock ticking
more and more slowly.

422
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,950
- How do we know it fell in?

423
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,330
- We don't.

424
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,230
I mean, how would we?

425
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,240
Because it's always possible

426
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,260
that right at the last minute,

427
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,520
it had a change of heart

428
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,010
and starts accelerating away.

429
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,720
If you don't see it pass in,

430
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,070
you don't know.

431
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:28,110
And let's point out that
as smart as Einstein was,

432
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,790
he never figured out black holes.

433
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,170
And he could have.

434
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,310
It's kind of embarrassing.

435
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:36,420
It took decades for people
thinking about general relativity

436
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,420
to understand that there are
such things as black holes

437
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,670
because, basically, Einstein comes up

438
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,070
with general relativity in 1915.

439
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,690
Two years later,

440
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:50,690
Schwarzschild, Karl Schwarzschild
derives the solution

441
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,337
to Einstein's equation that
represents a black hole,

442
00:16:53,337 --> 00:16:55,020
the Schwarzschild solution.

443
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,110
No one recognized it for what
it was until the fifties,

444
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:00,240
David Finkelstein and other people.

445
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,070
And that's just one of these examples

446
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:04,680
of physicists not being as
clever as they should have been.

447
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,180
- Well, that's the singularity,

448
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,180
that's the kind of the edge
of the theory, the limit.

449
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,090
So it's understandable that it's difficult

450
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,550
to imagine the limit of things.

451
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,020
- It is absolutely hard to imagine.

452
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,210
And a black hole is very different

453
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:19,705
in many ways from what we're used to.

454
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,560
I mean, the real reason,
of course, is that

455
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,830
between 1915 and 1955,

456
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:26,700
there's a bunch of other things

457
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,860
that are really interesting
going on in physics,

458
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,020
all of particle physics
and quantum field theory.

459
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,630
So many of the greatest
minds were focused on that.

460
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:36,690
But still, if the universe
hands you a solution

461
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,030
to general relativity in
terms of curve spacetime,

462
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:42,120
and it's kind of mysterious
certain features of it,

463
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,340
I would put some effort in
trying to figure it out.

464
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,160
- So how does a black hole work?

465
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,410
Put yourself in the shoes of Einstein

466
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,580
and take general relativity

467
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,790
to its natural conclusion
about these massive things.

468
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:57,000
- It's best to think of a
black hole as not an object

469
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,610
so much as a region of spacetime.

470
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,510
Okay?

471
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,880
It's a region with the property,

472
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,380
at least in classical general relativity,

473
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,970
quantum mechanics makes everything harder.

474
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:08,880
But let's imagine we're being
classical for the moment.

475
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,710
It's a region of spacetime
with the property

476
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:11,610
that if you enter,

477
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:12,603
you can't leave.

478
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,810
Literally, the equivalent

479
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:18,330
of escaping a black hole
would be moving faster

480
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,200
than the speed of light.

481
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,540
They're both precisely equally difficult.

482
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,860
You would have to move faster
than the speed of light

483
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,540
to escape from the black hole.

484
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,400
So once you're in,

485
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,270
that's fine.

486
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,410
In principle,

487
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,243
you don't even notice

488
00:18:29,243 --> 00:18:31,020
when you cross the event horizon,

489
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:31,853
as we call it,

490
00:18:31,853 --> 00:18:33,960
the event horizon is
that point of no return,

491
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,793
where once you're inside,

492
00:18:34,793 --> 00:18:36,000
you can't leave.

493
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,630
But meanwhile, the spacetime
is sort of collapsing

494
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:43,920
around you to ultimately a
singularity in your future,

495
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,610
which means that the gravitational
forces are so strong,

496
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,380
they tear your body apart

497
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,750
and you will die in a
finite amount of time.

498
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,583
The time it takes,

499
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:56,580
if the black hole is
about the mass of the sun

500
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,370
to go from the event
horizon to the singularity,

501
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,143
takes about 1000000th of a second.

502
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,300
- And what happens to you if
you fall into the black hole?

503
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:09,300
If we think of an object as information,

504
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,100
that information gets destroyed.

505
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:16,100
- Well, you've raised a
crucially difficult point.

506
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,260
So that's why I keep
needing to distinguish

507
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,060
between black holes according

508
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,220
to Einstein's theory general relativity,

509
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,530
which is book one of
"Spacetime and Geometry,"

510
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,960
which is perfectly classical.

511
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,720
And then come the 1970s,

512
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,610
we start asking about quantum mechanics

513
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,590
and what happens in quantum mechanics.

514
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,600
According to classical general relativity,

515
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,030
the information that makes up you,

516
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,940
when you fall into the black hole is lost

517
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,110
to the outside world.

518
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,970
It's there, it's inside the black hole,

519
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:47,490
but we can't get it anymore.

520
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,450
In the 1970s,

521
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,040
Stephen Hawking comes along

522
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,800
and points out that black holes radiate.

523
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,630
They give off photons

524
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,970
and other particles to
the universe around them.

525
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,560
And as they radiate,

526
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,430
they lose mass

527
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,840
and eventually, they evaporate,

528
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,190
they disappear.

529
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,770
So once that happens,

530
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,860
I can no longer say the
information about you

531
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,210
or a book that I threw in a black hole

532
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,890
or whatever is still there.

533
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:11,899
It's hidden behind the black hole

534
00:20:11,899 --> 00:20:14,190
'cause the black hole has gone away.

535
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,880
So either that information
is destroyed, like you said,

536
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,970
or it is somehow
transferred to the radiation

537
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,730
that is coming out to
the Hawking radiation.

538
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:26,550
The large majority of people
who think about this believe

539
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:30,270
that the information is somehow
transferred to the radiation

540
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,160
and information is conserved.

541
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,330
That is a feature both of
general relativity by itself

542
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:37,980
and of quantum mechanics by itself.

543
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,450
So when you put them together,

544
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:40,470
that should still be a feature.

545
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,880
We don't know that for sure.

546
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,140
There are people who have doubted it,

547
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,600
including Stephen Hawking for a long time.

548
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,550
But that's what most people think.

549
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:51,150
And so what we're trying
to do now in a topic

550
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,010
which has generated many, many hundreds

551
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:56,760
of papers called the black
hole information loss puzzle,

552
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,280
is figure out how to get
the information from you

553
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,350
or the book into the radiation

554
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:03,570
that is escaping the black hole.

555
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:08,220
- Is there any way to observe
Hawking radiation to a degree

556
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,110
where you can start gaining insight?

557
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:12,780
Or is this all just in the
space of theory right now?

558
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,940
- Right now, we are nowhere close

559
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,860
to observing Hawking radiation.

560
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,060
Here's the sad fact.

561
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,910
The larger the black hole is,

562
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:23,700
the lower its temperature is.

563
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,590
So a small black hole,

564
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,150
like a microscopically small black hole

565
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:27,990
might be very visible.

566
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,220
It's given off light.

567
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,207
But something like the black hole,

568
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:32,970
the center of our galaxy, 3

569
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:34,080
million times the mass

570
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,400
of the sun or something like that,

571
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,470
Sagittarius, a star,

572
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,470
that is so cold and low temperature

573
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:43,560
that it's radiation will
never be observable.

574
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,150
Black holes are hard to make.

575
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,500
We don't have any nearby.

576
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,430
The ones we have out there

577
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,960
in the universe are very, very faint.

578
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,980
So there's no immediate hope

579
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,600
for detecting Hawking radiation.

580
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,700
- Allegedly, we don't have any nearby.

581
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,840
- As far as we know,

582
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,800
we don't have any nearby.

583
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,910
- Could tiny ones be hard

584
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:00,000
to detect at the edges of
the solar system maybe?

585
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,150
- So you don't want them to be too tiny

586
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,470
or they're exploding,

587
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,550
or they're very bright

588
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,840
and then they'll be visible.

589
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,400
But there's an absolutely a regime

590
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,890
where black holes are large
enough not to be visible

591
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,450
because the larger ones are fainter,

592
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:13,950
not giving off radiation,

593
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,600
but small enough to not been detected

594
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,890
through their gravitational effect.

595
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:17,790
Yeah.

596
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,620
- Psychologically, just emotionally,

597
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,910
how do you feel about black holes?

598
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:21,743
They scare you.

599
00:22:21,743 --> 00:22:22,576
- I love them.

600
00:22:22,576 --> 00:22:23,409
I love black holes.

601
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:26,460
But the universe weirdly makes it hard

602
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,320
to make a black hole

603
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,500
because you really need to
squeeze an enormous amount

604
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,220
of matter energy into a very,
very small region of space.

605
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,490
So we know how to make
stellar black holes,

606
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:42,180
a super massive star can
collapse to make a black hole.

607
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,880
We know we also have these
super massive black holes,

608
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,020
the center of a galaxies.

609
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:49,050
We're a little unclear
where they came from.

610
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,520
I mean, maybe stellar black holes

611
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,730
that got together and combined.

612
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:57,090
But that's one of the exciting things

613
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:00,060
about new data from the
James Webb Space Telescope is

614
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,430
that quite large black holes seem

615
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:05,220
to exist relatively early in
the history of the universe.

616
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,900
So it was already difficult

617
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,250
to figure out where they came from.

618
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,900
Now, it's an even tougher puzzle.

619
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,870
- So these super massive
black holes are formed

620
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,823
somewhere early on in the universe.

621
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,530
I mean, that's a feature,

622
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,363
not a bug, right?

623
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:18,630
That we don't have too many of them.

624
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:23,370
Otherwise, we wouldn't
have the time or the space

625
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:26,790
to form the little pockets of complexity

626
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,050
that we'll call humans.

627
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:28,883
- I think that's fair.

628
00:23:28,883 --> 00:23:29,716
Yeah.

629
00:23:29,716 --> 00:23:34,170
It's always interesting
when something is difficult,

630
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:35,160
but happens anyway.

631
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,510
I mean, the probability

632
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,610
of making a black hole
could have been zero;

633
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:39,810
it could have been one.

634
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:41,550
But it's this interesting
number in between,

635
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,480
which is kind of fun.

636
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,850
- Are there more intelligent
alien civilization

637
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,770
than there are super massive black holes?

638
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:49,440
- Yeah, I have no idea.

639
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,870
But I think your intuition is right,

640
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:54,990
that it would've been easy

641
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,030
for there to be lots of civilizations

642
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,820
and then we would've noticed
them already and we haven't.

643
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,430
So, absolutely, the simplest explanation

644
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:04,380
for why we haven't is
that they're not there.

645
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,460
- Yeah.

646
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,313
I just think it's so easy
to make them, though.

647
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,450
I understand that's the
simplest explanation.

648
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,283
but also-

649
00:24:13,283 --> 00:24:14,430
- How easy is it to make life

650
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:17,310
or you carry other life
or multicellular life?

651
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:20,160
- It seems like life finds a way.

652
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,780
Intelligent alien civilizations,

653
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:25,350
sure, maybe there is
somewhere along that chain,

654
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,300
a really, really hard leap.

655
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,940
But once you start life,

656
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,590
once you get the origin of life,

657
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:34,620
it seems like life just
finds a way everywhere

658
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,790
in every condition.

659
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,680
It just figures it out.

660
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,513
- I mean, I get it.

661
00:24:38,513 --> 00:24:39,540
I get exactly what you're thinking,

662
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:44,190
I think is a perfectly
reasonable attitude to have

663
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,930
before you confront the data.

664
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:48,030
I would not have expected
earth to be special in any way.

665
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,410
I would've expected there to be plenty

666
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:53,793
of very noticeable extraterrestrial
civilizations out there.

667
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,630
But even if life finds a way,

668
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,970
even if we buy everything you say,

669
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:03,000
how long does it take
for life to find a way?

670
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,640
What if it typically takes
a hundred billion years?

671
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,770
Then we'd be alone.

672
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,180
- So it's a time thing.

673
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,650
So to you, really,

674
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:14,130
most likely, there's no alien
civilizations out there.

675
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:15,510
I can't see it.

676
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,040
I believe there's a ton of them.

677
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,620
And there's another explanation
why we can't see them.

678
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,820
- I don't believe that very strongly.

679
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,373
Look, I'm not gonna
place a lot of bets here.

680
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,030
I'm both pretty up in
the air about whether

681
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,523
or not life itself is all over the place.

682
00:25:29,523 --> 00:25:30,810
It's possible.

683
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:32,640
When we visit other worlds,

684
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,630
other solar systems,

685
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:37,950
there's very tiny
microscopic life ubiquitous,

686
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:41,250
but none of it has
reached some complex form.

687
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:44,070
It's also possible just there isn't any.

688
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:47,130
It's also possible that there
are intelligent civilizations

689
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,290
that have better things to
do than knock on our doors.

690
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,600
So I think we should be very humble

691
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,250
about these things we
know so little about.

692
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,230
- And it's also possible
there's a great filter

693
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,300
where there's something fundamental

694
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,900
about once the civilization develops

695
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,760
complex enough technology,

696
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,880
that technology is more
statistically likely

697
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,110
to destroy everybody versus
to continue being creative.

698
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,150
- That is absolutely possible.

699
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:14,190
I'm actually putting less
credence on that one just

700
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:17,160
because you need it to
happen every single time.

701
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,390
If even one...

702
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:21,480
I mean, this goes back to
John von Neumann pointed out

703
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,950
that you don't need to send
the aliens around the galaxy.

704
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:28,560
You can build self-reproducing probes

705
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,510
and send them around the galaxy.

706
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,940
And you might think, well,
the galaxy's very big.

707
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,020
It's really not.

708
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:38,130
It's some tens of thousands
of light years across

709
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,440
and billions of years old.

710
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,440
So you don't need to move
at a high fraction the speed

711
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,780
of light to fill the galaxy.

712
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:48,570
- So if you were an
intelligent alien civilization,

713
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,890
the dictator of one,

714
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:51,270
you would just send out a lot of probes,

715
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,170
self-replicating probes-

716
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,003
- A hundred percent.

717
00:26:53,003 --> 00:26:54,210
- And just spread out.

718
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:55,043
- Yes.

719
00:26:55,043 --> 00:26:56,220
And what you should do?

720
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,690
So if you want the optimistic spin,

721
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,790
here's the optimistic spin.

722
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:03,570
People looking for intelligent
life elsewhere often tune in

723
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:05,490
with their radio telescopes, right?

724
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:09,003
At least we did before our
cebo was decommissioned.

725
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:12,330
That's not a very promising way

726
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,910
to find intelligent life elsewhere.

727
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:15,960
Because why in the world would

728
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,570
a super intelligent alien
civilization waste all

729
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,820
of its energy by beaming
it in random directions

730
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,813
into the sky?

731
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,210
For one thing,

732
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,400
it just passes you by.

733
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,750
So if we are here on earth,

734
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,580
we've only been listening to radio waves

735
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:33,120
for a hundred or a couple
hundred years, okay?

736
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,090
So if intelligent alien
civilization exists

737
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:38,460
for a billion years,

738
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,710
they have to pinpoint
exactly the right time

739
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:41,790
to send us this signal.

740
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:46,230
It is much, much more
efficient to send probes

741
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:49,920
and to park to go to
the other solar systems,

742
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:54,120
just sit there and wait for
an intelligent civilization

743
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,650
to arise in that solar system.

744
00:27:55,650 --> 00:28:00,317
This is kind of the 2001
monolith hypothesis.

745
00:28:00,317 --> 00:28:05,250
I would be less surprised to find sort

746
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:09,450
of quiescent alien artifact in
our solar system than I would

747
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:13,350
to catch a radio signal from
an intelligence civilization.

748
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,430
- So you're a sucker

749
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:17,640
for in-person conversations versus remote.

750
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,280
- I just want to integrate over time.

751
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,460
A probe can just sit there and wait,

752
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,650
whereas a radio wave goes right by you.

753
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,300
- Hmm.

754
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,130
How hard is it for an alien civilization,

755
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:31,170
again you have the dictator of one,

756
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,840
to figure out a probe

757
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,560
that is most likely to
find a common language

758
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,910
with whatever it finds?

759
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:40,620
- Couldn't I be like
the elected leader of-

760
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,350
- Elected leader, democratic leader,

761
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:47,040
elected leader of a democratic
alien civilization, yes.

762
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,880
- I think we would figure out

763
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,860
that language thing pretty quickly.

764
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,290
I mean, maybe not as quickly

765
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:55,680
as we do when different
human tribes find each other

766
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,360
because, obviously, there's
a lot of commonalities

767
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,010
in humanity.

768
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:01,230
But there is logic in math

769
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,520
and there is the physical world.

770
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,533
You can point to a rock and go rock.

771
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,790
I don't think it would take that long.

772
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:11,850
I know that "Arrival" movie

773
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:15,060
based on a Ted Chiang story
suggested that the way

774
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,250
that aliens communicate is going

775
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:19,140
to be fundamentally different,

776
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,640
but also they had recognition

777
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,990
and other things I don't believe in.

778
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:26,010
So I think that if we
actually find aliens,

779
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:28,113
that will not be our long-term problem.

780
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,560
- One of the places you're
affiliated with is Santa Fe,

781
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,060
and they approach the question

782
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,950
of complexity in many different ways

783
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,840
and ask the question
in many different ways

784
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,230
of what is life thinking broadly.

785
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:42,960
So to you would be able to find it,

786
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,640
you'll think you show up,

787
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,430
a probe shows up to a planet,

788
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:48,263
we'll see a thing

789
00:29:48,263 --> 00:29:51,090
and be like, "Yeah,
that's a living thing."

790
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:54,030
- Well, again, if it's intelligent

791
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:56,010
and technologically advanced,

792
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:59,730
the more short-term question

793
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:04,730
of if we get some spectroscopic
data from an exoplanet,

794
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,860
so we know a little bit about
what is in its atmosphere,

795
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,510
how can we judge whether

796
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,670
or not that atmosphere
is giving us a signature

797
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:12,990
of life existing?

798
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:15,690
That's a very hard question
the people are debating about.

799
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,280
I mean, one very simple-minded,

800
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:21,300
but perhaps interesting
approach is to say,

801
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,630
small molecules don't tell you anything

802
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,040
because even if life could make them,

803
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,750
something else could also make them.

804
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,550
But long molecules,

805
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:32,100
that's the kind of thing
that life would produce.

806
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,050
- So, signs of complexity.

807
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:34,883
- [Sean] Mm-hmm.

808
00:30:35,757 --> 00:30:36,590
- I don't know.

809
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:39,210
I just have this nervous feeling

810
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,680
that we won't be able to detect.

811
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,210
We'll show up to a planet.

812
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:44,040
They have a bunch of liquid on it.

813
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,000
We dip,

814
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,130
we take a swim in the liquid,

815
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:49,950
and we won't be able to
see the intelligence in it.

816
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:53,940
But whether that intelligence looks

817
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,920
like something like ants,

818
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,660
or we'll see movement
perhaps, strange movement,

819
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:05,250
but we won't be able to
see the intelligence in it

820
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,810
or communicate with it.

821
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:10,140
I guess if we have nearly
infinite amount of time

822
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,790
to play with different ideas,

823
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,350
we might be able to.

824
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:16,800
- I mean, I'm in favor
of this kind of humility,

825
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,480
this intellectual humility
that we won't know

826
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,810
because we should be
prepared for surprises.

827
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,970
But I do always keep
coming back to the idea

828
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:26,643
that we all live in the
same physical universe.

829
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:31,380
Well, let's put it this way.

830
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,213
The development

831
00:31:32,213 --> 00:31:35,850
of our intelligence has
certainly been connected

832
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:40,050
to our ability to manipulate
the physical world around us.

833
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:42,420
And so I would guess

834
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,310
without a hundred percent
credence by any means,

835
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:48,210
but my guess would be
that any advanced kind

836
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:51,780
of life would also have that capability.

837
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,710
Both dolphins

838
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:56,970
and octopuses are potential
counter examples to that.

839
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:59,760
But I think in the details,

840
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,200
there would be enough similarities

841
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,824
that we would recognize it.

842
00:32:02,824 --> 00:32:04,246
- I don't know how we got on this topic,

843
00:32:04,246 --> 00:32:06,630
but I think it was from
super massive black holes.

844
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,820
So if we return to black holes

845
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:12,240
and talk about the holographic
principle more broadly.

846
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,910
You have a recent paper on the topic.

847
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,170
You've been thinking about the topic

848
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:19,770
in terms of rigorous research perspective

849
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:23,137
and just as a popular book writer.

850
00:32:23,137 --> 00:32:25,770
So what is the holographic principle?

851
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:27,330
- Well, it goes back to this question

852
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:29,490
that we were talking
about with the information

853
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,320
and how it gets out.

854
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,710
In quantum mechanics, certainly,

855
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:37,850
arguably, even before
quantum mechanics comes along

856
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:40,380
in classical statistical mechanics,

857
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:44,550
there's a relationship between
information and entropy.

858
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,813
Entropy is my favorite
thing to talk about,

859
00:32:45,813 --> 00:32:47,280
that I've written books about

860
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,990
and we'll continue to write books about.

861
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:52,320
So Hawking tells us that
black holes have entropy

862
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,540
and it's a finite amount of entropy.

863
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,430
It's not an infinite amount.

864
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,230
But the belief is,

865
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,390
and now we're already
getting quite speculative,

866
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:02,280
the belief is that the entropy

867
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,630
of a black hole is the
largest amount of entropy

868
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,883
that you can have in
a region of spacetime.

869
00:33:08,883 --> 00:33:13,230
It's sort of the most densely
packed that entropy can be.

870
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,420
And what that means is there's
sort of a maximum amount

871
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,120
of information that you can
fit into that region of space

872
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,220
and you call it a black hole.

873
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:23,790
And interestingly, you
might expect if I have a box

874
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:26,190
and I'm gonna put information in it.

875
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:28,710
and I don't tell you how I'm
gonna put the information in,

876
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,760
but I ask,

877
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,040
how does the information
I can put in scale

878
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,290
with the size of the box?

879
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:36,810
You might think, well, it
goes as the volume of the box

880
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:38,820
because the information
takes up some volume

881
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,040
and I can only fit in a certain amount.

882
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,380
And that is what you might
guess for the black hole,

883
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,730
but it's not what the answer is.

884
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:48,000
The answer is that the maximum information

885
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,620
as reflected in the black hole
entropy scales as the area

886
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,840
of the black holes event horizon,

887
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,613
not the volume inside.

888
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,480
So people thought about that in both deep

889
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,820
and superficial ways for a long time.

890
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,690
And they proposed

891
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:06,090
what we now call the
holographic principle,

892
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,580
that the way that spacetime

893
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,040
and quantum gravity convey information

894
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:16,040
or hold information is not different bits

895
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,210
or qubits for quantum information

896
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:20,310
at every point in spacetime.

897
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,500
It is something holographic,

898
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,340
which means it's sort of
embedded in or located in,

899
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:29,390
or can be thought of as pertaining to,

900
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:32,520
or one dimension less
of the three dimensions

901
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,570
of space that we live in.

902
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:34,560
So in the case of the black hole,

903
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,750
the event horizon is
two dimensional embedded

904
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,430
in a three dimensional universe.

905
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:40,220
And the holographic
principle would say all

906
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,580
of the information contained

907
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,620
in the black hole can
be thought of as living

908
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,420
on the event horizon

909
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:49,830
rather than in the
interior of the black hole.

910
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,210
I need to say one more thing about that,

911
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,890
which is that this was an idea.

912
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:53,940
What the idea I just told you was

913
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,940
the original holographic
principle put forward

914
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,310
by people like Gerard't
Hooft and Leonard Susskind,

915
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:01,920
the super famous physicist.

916
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,250
Leonard Susskind was on my
podcast and gave a great talk.

917
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:08,100
He's very, very good at
explaining these things.

918
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:08,933
- Mindscape Podcast.

919
00:35:08,933 --> 00:35:09,869
- Mindset Podcast.

920
00:35:09,869 --> 00:35:10,702
- Everyone should listen my podcast.

921
00:35:10,702 --> 00:35:11,550
- [Sean] That's right, yes.

922
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,290
- [Lex] And you don't
just have physicists on .

923
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:14,280
- [Sean] I don't.

924
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,270
- [Lex] I love Mindscape.

925
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:16,320
- [Sean] Oh, thank you very much.

926
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,580
- [Lex] Curiosity-driven.

927
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,413
- [Sean] Yeah, ideas-

928
00:35:18,413 --> 00:35:19,740
- Exploration of ideas.
- Ideas from smart people.

929
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,573
Yeah.

930
00:35:20,573 --> 00:35:22,260
But anyway, what I was
trying to get at was Susskind

931
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,093
and also at Hooft,

932
00:35:23,093 --> 00:35:24,420
we're a little vague.

933
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,222
They were a little hand
wavy about holography

934
00:35:26,222 --> 00:35:27,300
and what it meant,

935
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,890
where holography,

936
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:31,470
the idea that information
is sort of encoded

937
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:34,560
on a boundary really came into its own was

938
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,115
with Juan Maldacena in the 1990s

939
00:35:39,115 --> 00:35:41,100
and the AdS/CFT correspondence,

940
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,960
which we don't have to get
into that into any detail,

941
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,500
but it's a whole full blown theory of...

942
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,180
It's two different theories.

943
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:53,160
One theory N dimensions of
spacetime without gravity.

944
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,290
And another theory in N+1 dimensions

945
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:57,390
of spacetime with gravity.

946
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,223
And the idea is

947
00:35:58,223 --> 00:36:02,160
that this N dimensional
theory is casting a hologram

948
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,620
into the N+1 dimensional universe

949
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,780
to make it look like it has gravity.

950
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,807
And that's holography with a vengeance.

951
00:36:09,807 --> 00:36:13,560
That's an enormous source of interest

952
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,110
for theoretical physicists these days.

953
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:19,653
- How should we picture
what impact that has?

954
00:36:20,565 --> 00:36:22,890
The fact that you can
store all the information,

955
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,600
you could think of as all the information

956
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,190
that goes into a black hole can be stored

957
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,690
at the event horizon.

958
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:29,540
- Yeah, I mean, it's a good question.

959
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:31,800
One of the things

960
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,660
that quantum field theory
indirectly suggests is

961
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,360
that there's not that
much information in you

962
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,840
and me compared to the volume
of spacetime we take up.

963
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,250
As far as quantum field
theory is concerned,

964
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,900
you and I are mostly empty space.

965
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:51,240
And so we are not
information-dense, right?

966
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,250
The density of information in us

967
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,620
or in a book or a CD or whatever,

968
00:36:55,620 --> 00:37:00,060
computer RAM is indeed encoded by volume.

969
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,370
There's different bits located
different points in space,

970
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:04,920
but that density of
information is super duper low.

971
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,560
Just like the speed of light

972
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,300
or just like the big bang,

973
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,980
for the information in a black hole,

974
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:15,000
we are far away in our everyday
experience from the regime

975
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,950
where these questions become relevant.

976
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,960
So it's very far away from our intuition.

977
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,670
We don't really know how to
think about these things.

978
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,870
We can do the math,

979
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:23,610
but we don't feel it in our bones.

980
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:27,120
- So you can just write off
that weird stuff happens

981
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:27,953
in a black hole.
- Well, we'd like

982
00:37:27,953 --> 00:37:28,786
to do better,

983
00:37:28,786 --> 00:37:29,619
but we're trying.

984
00:37:29,619 --> 00:37:31,770
I mean, that's why we have
a information loss puzzle

985
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:34,320
because we haven't completely solved it.

986
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,380
So here, just one thing to keep in mind.

987
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,640
Once spacetime becomes flexible,

988
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,070
which it does according
to general relativity

989
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:46,080
and you have quantum mechanics

990
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,300
which has fluctuations
in virtual particles

991
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,950
and things like that,

992
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,660
the very idea of a location

993
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,570
in spacetime becomes a little bit fuzzy

994
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:55,710
'cause it's flexible

995
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:58,080
and quantum mechanic says
you can't even pin it down.

996
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:02,400
So information can propagate in ways

997
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,930
that you might not have expected.

998
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,820
And that's easy to say and it's true,

999
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,170
but we haven't yet come up

1000
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,850
with the right way to talk about it

1001
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:10,470
that is perfectly rigorous.

1002
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:14,280
- But it's crazy how dense with
information a black hole is,

1003
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,680
and then plus like
quantum mechanics starts

1004
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,513
to come into play.

1005
00:38:17,513 --> 00:38:20,400
So you almost want to romanticize the kind

1006
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,260
of interesting computation type things

1007
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,940
that are going on inside the black hole.

1008
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,560
- You do, you do.

1009
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,330
I'll point out one other thing.

1010
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,640
It's information-dense,

1011
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,070
but it's also very, very high entropy.

1012
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,960
So a black hole is kind

1013
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,503
of like a very, very, very
specific random number.

1014
00:38:39,158 --> 00:38:41,520
It takes a lot of digits to specify it,

1015
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,410
but the digits don't tell you anything.

1016
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:46,260
They don't give you
anything useful to work on.

1017
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,450
So it takes a lot of information,

1018
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:52,410
but it's not of a form that
we can learn a lot from.

1019
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,243
- But hypothetically,

1020
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:56,910
I guess as you mentioned,

1021
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,860
the information might be preserved,

1022
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,620
the information that
goes into a black hole,

1023
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,890
it doesn't get destroyed.

1024
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:02,940
So what does that mean

1025
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,310
when the entropy is really high?

1026
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,600
- Well, the black hole...

1027
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,750
I said that the black hole
is the highest density

1028
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,160
of information,

1029
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,200
but it's not the highest
amount of information

1030
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,970
because the black hole can evaporate.

1031
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,080
And when it evaporates

1032
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,870
and people have done
the equations for this,

1033
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,310
when it evaporates,

1034
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:23,160
the entropy that it turns
into is actually higher

1035
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,660
than the entropy of the black hole was,

1036
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,493
which is good

1037
00:39:25,493 --> 00:39:26,940
because entropy is supposed to go up,

1038
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,190
but it's much more dilute.

1039
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:32,640
It's spread across a
huge volume of spacetime.

1040
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,980
So in principle,

1041
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,410
all that you made the black hole out of,

1042
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:40,950
the information that it took
is still there, we think,

1043
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:41,940
in that information,

1044
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:44,280
but it's scattered to the four winds.

1045
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,200
- We just talked about the
event horizon of black hole.

1046
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,460
What's on the inside?

1047
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,660
What's at the center of it?

1048
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,833
- No one's been there.

1049
00:39:50,956 --> 00:39:51,789
- [Lex] It came back to tell.

1050
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:53,430
- Again, this is a theoretical prediction,

1051
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:55,876
But I'll say one super crucial feature

1052
00:39:55,876 --> 00:39:57,393
of the black holes that we know and love,

1053
00:39:57,393 --> 00:40:00,990
that the kind that short
shield first invented,

1054
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,130
there's a singularity,

1055
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:05,670
but it's not at the
middle of the black hole.

1056
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:06,810
Remember space and time

1057
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:11,810
or parts of one unified spacetime.

1058
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,440
The location of the singularity

1059
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,570
in the black hole is
not the middle of space,

1060
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:17,220
but our future.

1061
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,900
It is a moment of time.

1062
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,550
It is like a Big Crunch.

1063
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,590
The Big Bang was an
expansion from a singularity

1064
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,820
in the past.

1065
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,260
Big Crunch probably doesn't exist,

1066
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,093
but if it did,

1067
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:29,160
it would be a collapse to a
singularity in the future.

1068
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,100
That's what the interiors
of black holes are like.

1069
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,320
You can be fine in the interior,

1070
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,630
but things are becoming
more and more crowded.

1071
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:38,610
Spacetime is becoming more and more warped

1072
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:40,200
and eventually you hit a limit

1073
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,180
and that's the singularity in your future.

1074
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:46,080
- I wonder what time is like
on the inside of a black hole.

1075
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,390
- Time always ticks by
at one second per second.

1076
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:50,070
That's all it can ever do.

1077
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:52,710
Time can tick by differently
for different people.

1078
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:55,380
And so you have things
like the twin paradox

1079
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,660
where two people initially
are the same age,

1080
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,493
one goes off,

1081
00:40:58,493 --> 00:40:59,910
the speed of light and comes back,

1082
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:01,320
now they're not.

1083
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,360
You can even work out
that the one who goes out

1084
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,010
and comes back will be younger

1085
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:08,850
because they did not take
the shortest distance path.

1086
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:10,947
But locally, as far as you

1087
00:41:10,947 --> 00:41:13,380
and your wristwatch are concerned,

1088
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,583
time is not funny.

1089
00:41:15,518 --> 00:41:19,230
Your neurological signals in your brain,

1090
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:21,750
and your heartbeat, and your wristwatch,

1091
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:23,850
whatever's happening to them is happening

1092
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,800
to all of them at the same time.

1093
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,830
So time always seems to be
ticking along at the same rate.

1094
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:31,590
- Well, if you fall into a black hole

1095
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,843
and then I'm an observer just watching it,

1096
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,640
and then you come out

1097
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:41,910
once it evaporates a million years later,

1098
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:44,640
I guess you'd be exactly the same age.

1099
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,660
Have you aged at all?

1100
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,480
- You would be converted into photons.

1101
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,890
You would not be you anymore.

1102
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:50,723
- Right.

1103
00:41:50,723 --> 00:41:52,110
So it's not at all possible

1104
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:55,640
that information is preserved
exactly as it went in.

1105
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,720
- It depends on what
you mean by preserved.

1106
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,870
It's there in the microscopic
configuration of the universe.

1107
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:03,480
It's exactly as if I took a regular book,

1108
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,043
made a paper and I burned it.

1109
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,350
The laws of physics say

1110
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:09,420
that all the information
in the book is still there

1111
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,220
in the heat, and light, and ashes.

1112
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,963
You're never going to get it.

1113
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:14,370
It's a matter of practice,

1114
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:15,960
but in principle it's still there.

1115
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,820
- But what about the age

1116
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:19,560
of things from the observer perspective

1117
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,690
from outside the black hole?

1118
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:25,080
- From outside the black
hole doesn't matter

1119
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,580
because they're inside the black hole.

1120
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,435
- No.

1121
00:42:27,435 --> 00:42:30,540
Okay, there's no way to
escape the black hole

1122
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:33,090
except to let it evaporate,

1123
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:34,080
to let it evaporate.

1124
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,700
- But also, by the way,

1125
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,830
just in relativity, special relativity,

1126
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:40,050
forget about general relativity,

1127
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:43,140
it's enormously tempting to say, okay,

1128
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:46,080
here's what's happening to me right now.

1129
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,900
I wanna know what's
happening far away right now.

1130
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,040
The whole point of relativity is

1131
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,410
to say there's no such thing as right now

1132
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:54,270
when you're far away.

1133
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:57,840
And that is doubly true for
what's inside a black hole.

1134
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,800
So you're tempted to say,

1135
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,390
well, how fast is their clock ticking?

1136
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:02,400
Or how old are they now?

1137
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,160
Not allowed to say that
according to relativity.

1138
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,500
- 'Cause space and time
is treated the same

1139
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,210
and so it doesn't even make sense.

1140
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:12,750
What happens to Tom in
the holographic principle?

1141
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:13,980
- As far as we know,

1142
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,800
nothing dramatic happens.

1143
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,110
We're not anywhere
close to being confident

1144
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:21,000
that we know what's going on here yet.

1145
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,340
So there are good unanswered questions

1146
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,740
about whether time is fundamental,

1147
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:27,870
whether time is emergent,

1148
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:30,600
whether it has something to
do with quantum entanglement,

1149
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,960
whether time really exists at all,

1150
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:34,793
different theories,

1151
00:43:34,793 --> 00:43:37,170
different proponents of different things.

1152
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:39,900
But there's nothing
specifically about holography

1153
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,730
that would make us change
our opinions about time,

1154
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:42,630
whatever they happen to be.

1155
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:44,430
- But holography is fundamentally about...

1156
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:46,004
It's a question of space.

1157
00:43:46,004 --> 00:43:46,934
- It really is, yeah.

1158
00:43:46,934 --> 00:43:47,767
- Okay.

1159
00:43:47,767 --> 00:43:48,963
So time is just like a-

1160
00:43:48,963 --> 00:43:50,791
- Time just goes along for
the ride as far as we know.

1161
00:43:50,791 --> 00:43:51,624
Yeah.

1162
00:43:51,624 --> 00:43:52,457
- So all the questions

1163
00:43:52,457 --> 00:43:54,510
about time is just almost
like separate questions,

1164
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:56,310
whether it's emergent and
all that kind of stuff.

1165
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:58,020
- Yeah, I mean that might be a reflection

1166
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:01,200
of our ignorance right now, but yes.

1167
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,900
- If we figure out a lot millions of years

1168
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,610
from now about black holes,

1169
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:06,960
how surprised would you be?

1170
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,130
If they traveled back in time

1171
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:11,670
and told you everything you
wanna know about black holes,

1172
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:15,990
how much do you think
there is still to know

1173
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:18,250
and how mind blowing would it be?

1174
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:20,910
- Mm.

1175
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:22,740
It does depend on what they would say.

1176
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:27,000
I think that there are colleagues of mine

1177
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,830
who think that we're pretty
close to figuring out

1178
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:32,610
how information gets out of black holes,

1179
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:34,860
how to quantize gravity, things like that.

1180
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:37,440
I'm more skeptical that
we are pretty close.

1181
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,980
I think that there's room for
a bunch of surprises to come.

1182
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:41,850
So in that sense,

1183
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:44,520
I suspect I would be surprised.

1184
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,180
The biggest and most interesting
surprise to me would be

1185
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:53,180
if quantum mechanics itself
were somehow superseded

1186
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,600
by something better.

1187
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,253
As far as I know,

1188
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,493
there's no empirical
evidence-based reason to think

1189
00:44:59,493 --> 00:45:02,730
that quantum mechanics is not
a hundred percent correct,

1190
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:03,660
but it might not be.

1191
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,582
That's always possible.

1192
00:45:05,582 --> 00:45:08,850
And there are again
respectable friends of mine

1193
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,323
who speculate about it.

1194
00:45:11,755 --> 00:45:15,090
That's the first thing I'd wanna know.

1195
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:16,860
- Oh, so like the black hole would be

1196
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,570
the most clear illustration-

1197
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:20,205
- [Sean] Yeah, that's
where it would show up.

1198
00:45:20,205 --> 00:45:21,987
- If there's something
it would show up there.

1199
00:45:21,987 --> 00:45:23,340
- So, I mean, maybe the point is

1200
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,710
that black holes are
mysterious for various reasons.

1201
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:29,250
So, yeah, if our best theory
of the universe is wrong,

1202
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:30,355
that might help explain why.

1203
00:45:30,355 --> 00:45:31,260
- But do you think it's possible

1204
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,600
we'll find something interesting,

1205
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:37,590
like black holes sometimes
create new universes

1206
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:41,910
or black holes are a kind
of portal through spacetime

1207
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:44,070
to another place or something like this?

1208
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:46,110
And then our whole conception

1209
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:49,260
of what is the fabric of
spacetime changes completely

1210
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:50,160
'cause black holes,

1211
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,500
it's like Swiss cheese type of situation.

1212
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:56,460
- Yeah, that would be
less surprising to me

1213
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,403
'cause I've already
written papers about that.

1214
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:03,450
We don't have, again,
strong reason to think

1215
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:06,270
that the interior of black
hole leads to another universe.

1216
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:07,260
But it is possible

1217
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,400
and it's also very possible that

1218
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,400
that's true for some black
holes and not others.

1219
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,020
This is stuff we don't know.

1220
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,910
It's easy to ask questions
we don't know the answer to.

1221
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:16,140
The problem is,

1222
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,700
the questions that are easy to ask

1223
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:18,720
that we don't know the answer to,

1224
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,670
are super hard to answer.

1225
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:22,500
- Because these objects are very difficult

1226
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,850
to test and to explore for us.

1227
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:25,010
- The regimes are just very far away.

1228
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:26,700
So either literally far away in space,

1229
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:30,060
but also in energy, or
mass, or time or whatever.

1230
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:33,450
- You've published a paper
on the holographic principle

1231
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:35,217
or that involves the
holographic principle,

1232
00:46:35,217 --> 00:46:38,070
but can you explain the details of that?

1233
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:41,580
- Yeah, I'm always interested in,

1234
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,050
since my first published paper,

1235
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,970
taking these wild speculative ideas

1236
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:47,460
and trying to test them against data.

1237
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:48,300
And the problem is,

1238
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,430
when you're dealing with
wild speculative ideas,

1239
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:54,300
they're usually not well-defined enough

1240
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,503
to make a prediction.

1241
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:58,350
I know it's gonna happen in some cases.

1242
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:00,270
I don't know what's gonna
happen in other cases.

1243
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:03,060
So we did the following thing.

1244
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:05,070
As I've already mentioned,

1245
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:06,330
the holographic principle,

1246
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:09,600
which is meant to reflect
the information contained

1247
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:13,470
in black holes seems to be
telling us that information.

1248
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:14,910
There's less information,

1249
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:19,200
less stuff that can go on
than you might naively expect.

1250
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,370
So let's upgrade,

1251
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:24,780
naively expect to predict
using quantum field theory.

1252
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,760
Quantum field theory is our best theory

1253
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,620
of fundamental physics right now.

1254
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:30,630
Unlike this holographic black hole stuff,

1255
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:33,420
quantum field theory is entirely local.

1256
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,710
In every point of space,

1257
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:36,297
something can go on.

1258
00:47:36,297 --> 00:47:37,890
And then you add up all the
different points in space.

1259
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:40,140
Okay, not holographic at all.

1260
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:42,540
So there's a mismatch
between the expectation

1261
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:43,530
for what is happening

1262
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:46,080
even in empty space in
quantum field theory

1263
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,930
versus what the holographic
principle would predict.

1264
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:51,630
How do you reconcile these two things?

1265
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:53,455
So there's one way of doing it

1266
00:47:53,455 --> 00:47:55,710
that had been suggested pre previously,

1267
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:57,060
which is to say that

1268
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:00,300
in the quantum field
theory way of talking,

1269
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:03,720
it implies there's a
whole bunch more states,

1270
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,540
a whole bunch more ways
the system could be

1271
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:07,653
than there really are.

1272
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:11,147
I'll do a little bit of math just

1273
00:48:11,147 --> 00:48:13,050
'cause there might be some
people in the audience

1274
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:14,580
who like the math.

1275
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:19,580
If I draw two axes on a
two dimensional geometry,

1276
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:21,990
like the surface of the table,

1277
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:23,160
you know that the whole point

1278
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,770
of it being two dimensional
is I can draw two vectors

1279
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:27,720
that are perpendicular to each other.

1280
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,490
I can't draw three vectors

1281
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:31,560
that are all perpendicular to each other.

1282
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,450
They need to overlap a little bit.

1283
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:35,850
That's true for any numbers of dimensions.

1284
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:37,740
But I can ask, okay,

1285
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:40,530
how much do they have to overlap?

1286
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:44,310
If I try to put more
vectors into a vector space,

1287
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:47,250
than the dimensionality
of the vector space,

1288
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:50,880
can I make them almost
perpendicular to each other?

1289
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,650
And the mathematical answer is,

1290
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:55,500
as the number of dimensions
gets very, very large,

1291
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,440
you can fit a huge extra
number of vectors in

1292
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:01,530
that are almost
perpendicular to each other.

1293
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:03,720
So in this case,

1294
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,250
what we're suggesting is,

1295
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:08,910
the number of things that
can happen in a region

1296
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:13,170
of space is correctly
described by holography.

1297
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:17,550
It is somewhat over counted
by quantum field theory,

1298
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:19,590
but that's because the quantum
field theory states are

1299
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:22,620
not exactly perpendicular to each other.

1300
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,420
I should have mentioned
that in quantum mechanics,

1301
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:25,620
states are given by vectors

1302
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,150
in some huge dimensional vector space,

1303
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:30,450
very, very, very, very large
dimensional vector space.

1304
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:33,420
So maybe the quantum
field theory states are

1305
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:36,570
not quite perpendicular to each other.

1306
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:37,860
If that is true,

1307
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:39,360
that's a speculation already.

1308
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,710
But if that's true,

1309
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:41,880
how would you know?

1310
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,970
What is the experimental deviation?

1311
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:47,340
And it would've been
completely respectable

1312
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:49,530
if we had gone through
and made some guesses

1313
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:51,390
and found that there is no noticeable

1314
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:52,770
experimental difference

1315
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:54,570
because, again, these things are

1316
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:56,610
in regimes very, very far away.

1317
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:58,440
We stuck our necks out.

1318
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:01,350
We made some very, very specific guesses

1319
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:04,410
as to how this weird overlap

1320
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:09,180
of states would show up
in the equations of motion

1321
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:11,760
for particles like neutrinos.

1322
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,740
And then we made predictions

1323
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:16,020
on how the neutrinos
would behave on the basis

1324
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:17,550
of those wild guesses.

1325
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,230
And then we compared them with data.

1326
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:20,970
And what we found is,

1327
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:22,590
we're pretty close,

1328
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:26,840
but haven't yet reached the detectability

1329
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,460
of the effect that we are predicting.

1330
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:30,360
In other words,

1331
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,250
well, basically, one way of
saying what we predict is

1332
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:33,083
if a neutrino,

1333
00:50:33,083 --> 00:50:34,290
and there's reasons why it's neutrinos,

1334
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:35,490
we can go into if you want,

1335
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:36,840
but it's not that interesting.

1336
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:39,840
If a neutrino comes to us
from across the universe,

1337
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,300
from some galaxy very, very far away,

1338
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,880
there is a probability as it's traveling

1339
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,190
that it will dissolve into other neutrinos

1340
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:50,130
because they're not really
perpendicular to each other

1341
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,690
as vectors as they would ordinarily be

1342
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:53,130
in quantum field theory.

1343
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:53,970
And that means that

1344
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:57,600
if you look at neutrinos
coming from far enough away

1345
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,520
with high enough energies,

1346
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,470
they should disappear.

1347
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:05,010
Like if you see a whole
bunch of nearby neutrinos,

1348
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:06,780
but then further away,

1349
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:08,430
you should see fewer.

1350
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:11,490
And there is an experiment called IceCube,

1351
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:15,540
which is this amazing
testament to the ingenuity

1352
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:18,930
of human beings where
they go to Antarctica.

1353
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:20,820
And they drill holes

1354
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:23,940
and they put photo detectors on a string,

1355
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:26,370
a mile deep in these holes.

1356
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:30,480
And they basically use
all of the ice in a cube.

1357
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,160
I don't know whether it's a a mile or not,

1358
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,570
but it's like a kilometer
or something like that,

1359
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:35,130
some big region.

1360
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:37,983
That much ice is their detector.

1361
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:41,160
And they're looking for
flashes when a cosmic ray

1362
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:45,360
or a neutrino or whatever
hits ice molecule,

1363
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,890
water molecule in the ice.

1364
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:48,768
- Makes it with flashes in the ice.

1365
00:51:48,768 --> 00:51:49,601
They're looking for-

1366
00:51:49,601 --> 00:51:50,634
- They're looking for flashes in the ice.

1367
00:51:50,634 --> 00:51:51,630
- But isn't there some crazy...

1368
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:54,273
I mean, what does the
detector of that look like?

1369
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,820
- It's a bunch of strings,

1370
00:51:56,820 --> 00:52:01,820
many, many, many strings with
360 degree photo detectors.

1371
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:02,963
- Yeah.

1372
00:52:02,963 --> 00:52:03,909
- And you'll-

1373
00:52:03,909 --> 00:52:04,742
- That's really cool.

1374
00:52:04,742 --> 00:52:05,580
- It's extremely cool.

1375
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,860
And they've done amazing work.

1376
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:09,660
And they find neutrinos.

1377
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:10,800
- They're looking for neutrinos.

1378
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,841
- Yeah, so the whole point is

1379
00:52:12,841 --> 00:52:15,690
most cosmic rays are protons because why?

1380
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:18,120
Because protons exist

1381
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,890
and they're massive enough

1382
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:21,210
that you can accelerate them

1383
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:22,440
to very high energies.

1384
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:25,410
So high energy cosmic
rays tend to be protons.

1385
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:28,350
They also tend to hit
the earth's atmosphere

1386
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:30,240
and decay into other particles.

1387
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,940
So neutrinos, on the other hand,

1388
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:33,930
punch right through,

1389
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:35,880
at least usually to a great extent.

1390
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,200
So not just Antarctica,

1391
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,880
but the whole earth.

1392
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,880
Occasionally, a neutrino will interact

1393
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,530
with a particle here on earth

1394
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:45,450
and his neutrino is going
through your body all the time

1395
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:47,847
from the sun, from the
universe, et cetera.

1396
00:52:47,847 --> 00:52:49,410
And so if you're patient enough

1397
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:52,920
and you have a big enough part
of the Antarctic ice sheet

1398
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:53,823
to look at,

1399
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:57,600
the nice thing about
ice is it's transparent.

1400
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,680
So you've built yourself,

1401
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,170
nature has built you a neutrino detector.

1402
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:02,156
IceCube does.

1403
00:53:02,156 --> 00:53:04,016
- So why ice?

1404
00:53:04,016 --> 00:53:05,820
So is it just because of the low noise

1405
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:08,902
and you get to watch this thing and it's-

1406
00:53:08,902 --> 00:53:11,490
- It's much more dense than air,

1407
00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:12,990
but it's transparent.

1408
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:14,070
- So yeah, much more dense.

1409
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:14,940
So higher probability

1410
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:16,290
and then it's transparency

1411
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:18,307
and then it's also in
the middle of nowhere

1412
00:53:18,307 --> 00:53:19,682
so you can...

1413
00:53:19,682 --> 00:53:21,198
Humans are great.
- No, that's all you need.

1414
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:22,031
There's not that much ice, right?

1415
00:53:22,031 --> 00:53:22,864
- Yeah.

1416
00:53:22,864 --> 00:53:24,264
- So humans are the best.
- There's more ice

1417
00:53:24,264 --> 00:53:25,650
in Arctic than anywhere else.

1418
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:27,750
So anyway, you can go

1419
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:30,480
and you can get a plot from
the IceCube experiment.

1420
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,150
How many neutrinos there
are that they've detected

1421
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:35,430
with very high energies?

1422
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:39,480
And we predict in our weird
little holographic guessing game

1423
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,040
that there should be a cutoff.

1424
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,420
You should see neutrinos as you get

1425
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:43,560
to higher and higher energies

1426
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,330
and then they should disappear.

1427
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:46,800
If you look at the data,

1428
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:51,390
their data gives out
exactly where our cutoff is.

1429
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:53,460
That doesn't mean that
our cutoff is right.

1430
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:56,130
It means they lose the
ability to do the experiment

1431
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:58,710
exactly where we predict
the cutoff should be.

1432
00:53:58,710 --> 00:53:59,913
- Oh boy, okay.

1433
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,480
But why is there a limit?

1434
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,430
- Oh, just because there are fewer, fewer

1435
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:06,660
high energy neutrinos.

1436
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,570
So there's a spectrum and it goes down,

1437
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:11,880
but that what we're
plotting here is got number

1438
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,620
of neutrinos versus energy.

1439
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:15,660
It's fading away

1440
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:16,980
and they just get very, very few.

1441
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:19,680
- And you need the high energy neutrinos

1442
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:20,977
for your prediction.

1443
00:54:20,977 --> 00:54:22,498
- Our effect is a little bit
bigger for higher energies.

1444
00:54:22,498 --> 00:54:23,331
Yeah.

1445
00:54:23,331 --> 00:54:24,164
- Got it.

1446
00:54:24,164 --> 00:54:24,997
And that effect has to do

1447
00:54:24,997 --> 00:54:26,520
with this almost perpendicular thing.

1448
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,470
- And let me just mention
the name of Oliver Friedrich,

1449
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:30,210
who was a postdoc who led this.

1450
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:32,250
He deserves the credit for doing this.

1451
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:34,050
I was a co-author and a collaborator.

1452
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:34,883
I did some work,

1453
00:54:34,883 --> 00:54:36,330
but he really gets the lion's share.

1454
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:37,163
- Thank you, Oliver.

1455
00:54:37,163 --> 00:54:40,500
Thank you for pushing
this wild science forward.

1456
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:45,390
Just to speak to the meta process of it.

1457
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:48,330
How do you approach
asking these big questions

1458
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:51,210
and trying to formulate as a paper,

1459
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:54,030
as an experiment to that
could make a prediction,

1460
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:54,863
all that kind of stuff?

1461
00:54:54,863 --> 00:54:56,430
What's your process?

1462
00:54:56,430 --> 00:54:57,660
- There's a very interesting things

1463
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,880
that happens once you're
a theoretical physicist.

1464
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:00,870
Once you become trained,

1465
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:01,830
you're a graduate student,

1466
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:04,440
you've written some papers and whatever,

1467
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,940
suddenly you are the world's expert

1468
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:09,090
in a really infinitesimally
tiny area of knowledge

1469
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:12,000
and you know not that
much about other areas.

1470
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,590
There's an overwhelming temptation

1471
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:15,420
to just drill deep.

1472
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:18,780
Just keep doing basically the
thing that you started doing.

1473
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:21,630
But maybe that thing
you started doing is not

1474
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:23,250
the most interesting thing

1475
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:25,620
to the world or to you or whatever.

1476
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:28,860
So you need to separately
develop the capability

1477
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:31,110
of stepping back and going, okay,

1478
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:33,990
now that I can write papers in that area,

1479
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:35,400
now that I'm sort of trained enough

1480
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,963
in the general procedure,

1481
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:42,330
what is the best match between
my interests, my abilities,

1482
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:44,220
and what is actually interesting?

1483
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:47,070
And honestly, I've not
been very good at that

1484
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:48,723
over my career.

1485
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:54,630
My process traditionally was I was working

1486
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:58,650
in this general area of
particle physics, field theory,

1487
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:00,810
general relativity, cosmology.

1488
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:04,740
And I would sort of try

1489
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:07,050
to take things other
people were talking about

1490
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:10,143
and ask myself whether or
not it really fit together.

1491
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:15,780
So I guess I have three
papers that I've ever written

1492
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,400
that have done super well

1493
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,440
in terms of getting cited
and things like that.

1494
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,943
One was my first ever paper

1495
00:56:20,943 --> 00:56:22,560
that I get very little credit for.

1496
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,880
That was my advisor

1497
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,280
and his collaborator set that up.

1498
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,050
The other two were basically my idea,.

1499
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:31,020
One was right after we discovered

1500
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,670
that the universe was accelerating.

1501
00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:33,810
So in 1998,

1502
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:36,210
observation showed that not
only is the universe expanding,

1503
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:38,670
but it's expanding faster and faster.

1504
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:39,630
So that's attributed

1505
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:42,930
to either Einstein's cosmological constant

1506
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:44,910
or some more complicated
form of dark energy,

1507
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:47,550
some mysterious thing
that fills the universe.

1508
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:49,320
And people were throwing around ideas

1509
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:50,490
about this dark energy stuff,

1510
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,950
what could it be and so forth.

1511
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:54,000
Most of the people throwing

1512
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,680
around these ideas were cosmologists.

1513
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:56,850
They work on cosmology.

1514
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:58,950
They think about the universe all at once.

1515
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:04,350
Since I like to talk to
people in different areas,

1516
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:08,340
I was sort of more familiar than average

1517
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:11,190
with what a respectable working
particle physicist would

1518
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:12,450
think about these things.

1519
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:14,754
And what I immediately thought was

1520
00:57:14,754 --> 00:57:16,920
you guys are throwing
around these theories.

1521
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,690
These theories are wildly unnatural.

1522
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:19,890
They're super finely tuned.

1523
00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:22,110
Like any particle physicist
would just be embarrassed

1524
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:23,730
to be talking about this.

1525
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:27,690
But rather than just scoffing at them,

1526
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:29,190
I sat down and asked myself,

1527
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:31,530
okay, is there a respectable version?

1528
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:34,710
Is there a way to keep the
particle physicist happy,

1529
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:36,390
but also make the universe accelerate?

1530
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:40,620
And I realized that there
is some very specific set

1531
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:42,990
of models that is relatively natural.

1532
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:44,250
And guess what?

1533
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:46,560
You can make a new experimental prediction

1534
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,030
on the basis of those.

1535
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:48,863
And so I did that.

1536
00:57:48,863 --> 00:57:50,490
People were very happy about that.

1537
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:53,070
- What was the thing that
would make physicists happy

1538
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:57,930
that would make sense
of this fragile thing

1539
00:57:57,930 --> 00:57:59,880
that the people call dark energy?

1540
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:04,880
- So the fact that dark energy
pervades the whole universe

1541
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:07,140
and is slowly changing,

1542
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:09,000
that should immediately
set off alarm bells

1543
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,440
because particle physics
is a story of length scales

1544
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,893
and time scales that are
generally, guess what, small.

1545
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,320
Particles are small.

1546
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,850
They vibrate quickly.

1547
00:58:20,850 --> 00:58:22,740
And you're telling me
now I have a new field

1548
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,060
and its typical rate

1549
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:26,790
of change is once every billion years.

1550
00:58:26,790 --> 00:58:29,760
Like that's just not natural.

1551
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,100
And indeed, you can formalize that

1552
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:35,610
and say, look, even if
you wrote down a particle

1553
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:38,880
that evolved slowly
over billions of years,

1554
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,480
if you let it interact with
other particles at all,

1555
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,510
that would make it move faster

1556
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:46,530
as dynamics would be faster

1557
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:48,270
as mass would be higher,
et cetera, et cetera.

1558
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:50,070
So there's a whole story.

1559
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:51,120
Things need to be robust,

1560
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:53,070
and they all talk to each
other in quantum field theory.

1561
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:54,870
So how do you stop that from happening?

1562
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:56,820
And the answer is symmetry.

1563
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:58,830
You can impose a symmetry

1564
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:01,560
that protects your new field from talking

1565
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:02,850
to any other fields.

1566
00:59:02,850 --> 00:59:03,780
Okay?

1567
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:05,790
And this is good for two reasons.

1568
00:59:05,790 --> 00:59:08,613
Number one, it can keep the dynamics slow.

1569
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,220
You can't tell me why it's slow.

1570
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:12,060
You just made that up.

1571
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:14,640
But at least it can
protect it from speeding up

1572
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:17,010
because it's not talking
to any other particles.

1573
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:17,843
And the other is,

1574
00:59:17,843 --> 00:59:19,120
it makes it harder to detect.

1575
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:23,940
Naively, experiments
looking for fifth forces

1576
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:28,350
or time changes of fundamental
constants of nature,

1577
00:59:28,350 --> 00:59:30,330
like the charge of the electron,

1578
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:32,310
these experiments should have been able

1579
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:35,400
to detect these dark energy fields.

1580
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:39,120
And I was able to propose a way
to stop that from happening.

1581
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,020
- The detection.

1582
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:41,160
- The detection, yeah.

1583
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,260
Because a symmetry could stop it

1584
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:44,940
from interacting with
all these other fields

1585
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:46,860
and therefore it makes
it harder to detect.

1586
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:48,420
And just by luck,

1587
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:49,253
I realized,

1588
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:51,930
'cause it was actually based
on my first ever paper,

1589
00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:53,850
there's one loophole.

1590
00:59:53,850 --> 00:59:56,520
If you impose these symmetries,

1591
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,140
so you protect the dark energy field

1592
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:00,420
from interacting with any other fields,

1593
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:02,040
there's one interaction

1594
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:04,830
that is still allowed
that you can't rule out.

1595
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:06,690
And it is a very specific interaction

1596
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:09,810
between your dark energy
field and photons,

1597
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:12,000
which are very common,

1598
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,740
and it has the following effect.

1599
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:16,770
As a photon travels
through the dark energy,

1600
01:00:16,770 --> 01:00:20,130
the photon has a polarization
up, down, left, right,

1601
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:21,450
whatever it happens to be.

1602
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:23,130
And as it travels through the dark energy,

1603
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:25,170
that photon will rotate its polarization.

1604
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:26,883
This is called birefringence.

1605
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:30,690
And you can kind of run the numbers

1606
01:00:30,690 --> 01:00:33,013
and say you can't make a
very precise prediction

1607
01:00:33,013 --> 01:00:34,260
because we're just making up this model.

1608
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:37,140
But if you want to roughly fit the data,

1609
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:39,270
you can predict how much polarization,

1610
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:40,650
rotation there should be,

1611
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:41,970
a couple of degrees.

1612
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:42,803
Okay?

1613
01:00:42,803 --> 01:00:43,950
Not that much.

1614
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:46,200
So that's very hard to detect.

1615
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,700
People have been trying to do it.

1616
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:49,830
Right now, literally,

1617
01:00:49,830 --> 01:00:52,490
we are on the edge of either
being able to detect it

1618
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:55,320
or rule it out using the
cosmic microwave background.

1619
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:58,350
And there is just truth in advertising.

1620
01:00:58,350 --> 01:01:01,440
There is a claim on the market

1621
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,410
that it's been detected that it's there.

1622
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:07,260
It's not very statistically significant.

1623
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:09,690
If I were to bet,

1624
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:11,010
I think it would probably go away.

1625
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:12,930
It's very hard thing to observe.

1626
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:15,960
But maybe as you get
better and better data,

1627
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:17,220
cleaner and cleaner analysis,

1628
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:18,053
it will persist

1629
01:01:18,053 --> 01:01:21,150
and we will have directly
detected the dark energy.

1630
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:23,600
- So if we just take this
tangent of dark energy,

1631
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:28,620
people will sometimes bring up dark energy

1632
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:33,620
and dark matter as an example
why physicists have lost it,

1633
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:36,060
lost their mind.

1634
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:39,210
We're just going to say
that there's this field

1635
01:01:39,210 --> 01:01:40,320
that permeates everything.

1636
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:43,410
It's unlike any other
field and it's invisible,

1637
01:01:43,410 --> 01:01:46,353
and it helps us work out some of the math.

1638
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,530
How do you respond to that?

1639
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:50,700
Those kinds of suggestions.

1640
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,320
- Well, two ways.

1641
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,690
One way is those people would've had

1642
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:58,380
to say the same thing when we
discovered the planet Neptune

1643
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:00,630
because it's exactly analogous

1644
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:02,730
where we have a very good theory.

1645
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:03,563
In that case,

1646
01:02:03,563 --> 01:02:05,970
Newtonian gravity in the solar system.

1647
01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:07,110
We made predictions.

1648
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:09,480
The predictions were
slightly off for the motion

1649
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,280
of the outer planets.

1650
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,920
You found that you could
explain that motion

1651
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,660
by positing something very simple,

1652
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:19,320
one more planet in a very,
very particular place.

1653
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,153
And you went and looked for it

1654
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:21,690
and there it was.

1655
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:23,730
That was the first successful example

1656
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:25,590
of finding dark matter in the universe.

1657
01:02:25,590 --> 01:02:26,700
- It's a matter.

1658
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:27,533
though we can't see.

1659
01:02:27,533 --> 01:02:28,366
- A dune was dark.

1660
01:02:28,366 --> 01:02:29,199
- Yeah.

1661
01:02:29,199 --> 01:02:31,560
- There's a difference between
dark matter and dark energy.

1662
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:35,223
Dark matter, as far as
we are hypothesizing it,

1663
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:37,710
is a particle of some sort.

1664
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:40,380
It's just a particle that
interacts with us very weekly.

1665
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:42,150
So we know how much of it there is.

1666
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:43,890
We know more or less where it is.

1667
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:45,630
We know some of its properties.

1668
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:48,033
We don't know specifically what it is.

1669
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:52,410
It's not anything
fundamentally mysterious.

1670
01:02:52,410 --> 01:02:53,700
It's a particle.

1671
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:55,980
Dark energy is a different story.

1672
01:02:55,980 --> 01:03:00,900
So dark energy is, indeed,
uniformly spread throughout space

1673
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:03,720
and has this very weird
property that it doesn't seem

1674
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:05,523
to evolve as far as we can tell.

1675
01:03:05,523 --> 01:03:07,860
It's the same amount of energy

1676
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:09,600
in every cubic centimeter of space

1677
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,400
from moment to moment in time.

1678
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,200
That's why far and away,

1679
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,033
the leading candidate

1680
01:03:14,033 --> 01:03:16,710
for dark energy is Einstein's
cosmological constant.

1681
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:19,650
The cosmological constant
is strictly constant,

1682
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:21,120
a hundred percent constant.

1683
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:24,720
The data say it had better
be 98% constant or better.

1684
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:27,060
So a hundred percent
constant works, right?

1685
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:28,710
And it's also very robust.

1686
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:29,543
It's just there.

1687
01:03:29,543 --> 01:03:30,510
It's not doing anything.

1688
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:32,610
It doesn't interact with
any other particles.

1689
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:33,443
It makes perfect sense.

1690
01:03:33,443 --> 01:03:36,840
Probably the dark energy is
the cosmological constant.

1691
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:40,170
The dark matter, super
important to emphasize here.

1692
01:03:40,170 --> 01:03:43,170
it was hypothesized at first

1693
01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:45,570
in the seventies and eighties,

1694
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:48,903
mostly to explain the
rotation of galaxies.

1695
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:55,220
Today, the evidence for dark
matter is both much better

1696
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:59,160
than it was in the 1980s
and from different sources.

1697
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,960
It is mostly from observations

1698
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,670
of the cosmic background radiation

1699
01:04:02,670 --> 01:04:04,560
or of large scale structure.

1700
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:08,460
So we have multiple
independent lines of evidence,

1701
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:10,530
also gravitational lensing
and things like that.

1702
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:12,330
Many, many pieces of evidence

1703
01:04:12,330 --> 01:04:14,580
that say that dark matter is there

1704
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:17,250
and also that say that the effects

1705
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:21,780
of dark matter are different
than if we modified gravity.

1706
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:24,810
So that was my first
answer to your question is,

1707
01:04:24,810 --> 01:04:26,760
dark matter we have a lot of evidence for.

1708
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:29,520
But the other one is, of course,

1709
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:33,270
we would love it if it
weren't dark matter.

1710
01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:36,510
Our vested interest is a
hundred percent aligned

1711
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:37,980
with it being something more cool

1712
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:39,420
and interesting than dark matter

1713
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:41,550
because dark matter's just a particle.

1714
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:43,050
That's the most boring thing in the world.

1715
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:46,860
- And it's non-uniformly
distributed to space, dark matter.

1716
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:47,693
- Absolutely.

1717
01:04:47,693 --> 01:04:48,526
Yeah.

1718
01:04:48,526 --> 01:04:49,359
You can even see maps of it

1719
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:51,450
that we've constructed
from gravitational lensing.

1720
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:55,080
- So verifiable sort of clumps
of dark matter in the galaxy

1721
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:56,100
that explains stuff.

1722
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,900
- Bigger than the galaxy, sadly.

1723
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:59,490
We think that in the galaxy,

1724
01:04:59,490 --> 01:05:00,930
dark matter is lumpy,

1725
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:03,690
but it's weaker.

1726
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:04,650
It's effects are weaker.

1727
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:07,110
But of the scale of large scale structure

1728
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:08,910
and clusters of galaxies
and things like that,

1729
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:10,133
yes, we can show you
where the dark matter is.

1730
01:05:10,133 --> 01:05:14,460
- Could there be a super cool
explanation for dark matter

1731
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:16,470
that would be interesting as opposed

1732
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:19,770
to just another particle that
that sits there and clumps?

1733
01:05:19,770 --> 01:05:22,830
- The super cool explanation
would be modifying gravity

1734
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:25,350
rather than inventing a new particle.

1735
01:05:25,350 --> 01:05:27,180
Sadly, that doesn't really work.

1736
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:28,950
We've tried, I've tried.

1737
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:32,100
That's my third paper
that was very successful.

1738
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:34,410
I tried to unify dark matter

1739
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:36,210
and dark energy together.

1740
01:05:36,210 --> 01:05:38,010
That was my idea.

1741
01:05:38,010 --> 01:05:40,110
That was my aspiration, not even idea.

1742
01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:40,943
I tried to do it.

1743
01:05:40,943 --> 01:05:42,480
It failed even before we wrote the paper.

1744
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,150
I realized that my idea did not help.

1745
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:45,983
It helps...

1746
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:49,860
It could possibly explain
away the dark energy,

1747
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:51,870
but it would not explain
away the dark matter.

1748
01:05:51,870 --> 01:05:54,420
And so I thought it was not
that interesting, actually.

1749
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:56,827
And then two different
collaborators of mine said,

1750
01:05:56,827 --> 01:05:57,960
"Has anyone thought of this idea?"

1751
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:59,790
Like they thought of exactly the same idea

1752
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:01,500
completely independently of me.

1753
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,840
I said, "Well, if three
different people found

1754
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:04,673
the same idea,

1755
01:06:04,673 --> 01:06:05,506
maybe it is interesting,"

1756
01:06:05,506 --> 01:06:07,320
and so we wrote the paper

1757
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:08,910
And yeah, it was very interesting.

1758
01:06:08,910 --> 01:06:09,743
People are very interested in it.

1759
01:06:09,743 --> 01:06:12,093
- Can you describe this
paper a little bit?

1760
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:14,880
It's fascinating how much

1761
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,797
of a thing there is dark
energy and dark matter

1762
01:06:16,797 --> 01:06:18,180
and we don't quite understand it.

1763
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:22,230
So what was your dive into
exploring how to unify the two?

1764
01:06:22,230 --> 01:06:25,713
- So here is what we know about
dark matter and dark energy.

1765
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:30,960
They become important in regimes

1766
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:33,843
where gravity is very, very, very weak.

1767
01:06:34,770 --> 01:06:36,930
That's kind of the opposite

1768
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:38,340
from what you would expect

1769
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:40,590
if you actually were modifying gravity.

1770
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:44,100
There's a rule of thumb in
quantum field theory, et cetera.

1771
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:45,420
That new effects show up

1772
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:48,321
when the effects are strong.

1773
01:06:48,321 --> 01:06:49,860
We understand weak fields.

1774
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:51,090
We don't understand strong fields.

1775
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:54,360
But okay, maybe this is different, right?

1776
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:56,520
So what do I mean by when gravity is weak?

1777
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:58,680
The dark energy shows up late

1778
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:00,180
in the history of the universe.

1779
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:01,380
Early in the history of the universe,

1780
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:03,150
the dark energy is irrelevant.

1781
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:07,410
But remember the density of
dark energy stays constant.

1782
01:07:07,410 --> 01:07:10,050
The density of matter
and radiation go down.

1783
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:11,130
So at early times,

1784
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:13,020
the dark energy was completely irrelevant

1785
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:14,760
compared to matter and radiation.

1786
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:15,593
At late times,

1787
01:07:15,593 --> 01:07:16,590
it becomes important.

1788
01:07:16,590 --> 01:07:18,810
That's also when the universe is dilute

1789
01:07:18,810 --> 01:07:20,970
and gravity is relatively weak.

1790
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:22,260
Now, think about galaxies.

1791
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:23,093
Okay?

1792
01:07:23,093 --> 01:07:24,840
A galaxy is more dense in the middle,

1793
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,250
less dense on the outside.

1794
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:28,920
And there is a phenomenological
fact about galaxies

1795
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,660
that in the interior of galaxies,

1796
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:32,010
you don't need dark matter.

1797
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,020
That's not so surprising

1798
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:36,720
'cause the density of stars
and gas is very high there

1799
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,370
and the dark matter is just subdominant.

1800
01:07:38,370 --> 01:07:42,780
But then there's generally a radius inside

1801
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:45,540
of which you don't need dark
matter to fit the data outside

1802
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:47,550
of which you do need dark
matter with the data.

1803
01:07:47,550 --> 01:07:51,510
So that's, again, when
gravity is weak, right?

1804
01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:52,953
So I asked myself,

1805
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:56,910
of course, we know in field theory,

1806
01:07:56,910 --> 01:07:59,460
new effects should show up when
fields are strong, not weak,

1807
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:01,920
but let's throw that out of the window.

1808
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,500
Can I write down a theory

1809
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:07,743
where gravity alters when it is weak?

1810
01:08:08,670 --> 01:08:10,440
And we've already said what gravity is.

1811
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:11,273
What is gravity?

1812
01:08:11,273 --> 01:08:12,870
It's the curvature of spacetime.

1813
01:08:12,870 --> 01:08:16,050
So there are mathematical

1814
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:18,780
that measure the curvature of spacetime.

1815
01:08:18,780 --> 01:08:20,880
And generally, you would say like,

1816
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,010
I have an understanding
Einstein's equation,

1817
01:08:23,010 --> 01:08:25,980
which I explained to
the readers in the book,

1818
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:28,950
relates the curvature of
spacetime to matter and energy.

1819
01:08:28,950 --> 01:08:30,210
The more matter and energy,

1820
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:31,620
the more curvature.

1821
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:34,380
So I'm saying what if you
add a new term in there

1822
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:37,530
that says the less matter and energy,

1823
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:38,793
the more curvature.

1824
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,510
No reason to do that

1825
01:08:42,510 --> 01:08:44,670
except to fit the data.

1826
01:08:44,670 --> 01:08:47,457
So I tried to unify the
need for dark matter

1827
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:48,390
and the need for dark.

1828
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:50,340
- That would be really
cool if that was the case.

1829
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:51,510
- Super cool, right?

1830
01:08:51,510 --> 01:08:52,343
It'd be the best.

1831
01:08:52,343 --> 01:08:53,176
It'd be great.

1832
01:08:53,176 --> 01:08:54,313
Well, it didn't work.

1833
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:59,036
- It'd be really interesting
if gravity did something funky

1834
01:08:59,036 --> 01:09:01,410
when there's not much of it.

1835
01:09:01,410 --> 01:09:02,720
Like almost like at the edges of it,

1836
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:03,930
it gets noisy.

1837
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:05,703
- That was exactly the hope.

1838
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:11,910
But the great thing about
physics is there are equations.

1839
01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:13,290
I mean, you can come up with words

1840
01:09:13,290 --> 01:09:14,520
and you can wave your hands,

1841
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:17,520
but then you gotta write
down the equations and I did.

1842
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,400
And I figured out that it could help

1843
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:21,233
with the dark energy.

1844
01:09:21,233 --> 01:09:22,066
The acceleration of the universe,

1845
01:09:22,066 --> 01:09:23,970
it doesn't help with dark matter at all.

1846
01:09:23,970 --> 01:09:24,803
- Yeah.

1847
01:09:24,803 --> 01:09:27,000
It just sucks that the scale of galaxies

1848
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,453
and scale of solar systems,

1849
01:09:31,770 --> 01:09:33,510
the physics is kind of boring.

1850
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:34,710
- Yeah, it does.

1851
01:09:34,710 --> 01:09:35,910
I agree.

1852
01:09:35,910 --> 01:09:38,550
And again, that's why
it is a little bit...

1853
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:40,140
I tear my hair out

1854
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:43,380
when people who are not physicists think,

1855
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:45,600
accuse physicists, like you say,

1856
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,160
of sort of losing the plot

1857
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:49,320
because they need dark
matter and dark energy.

1858
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:51,570
I don't want dark matter and dark energy.

1859
01:09:51,570 --> 01:09:53,640
I want something much cooler than that.

1860
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:55,140
I've tried.

1861
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:58,440
But you gotta listen to the
equations and to the data.

1862
01:09:58,440 --> 01:09:59,520
- You mentioned three papers,

1863
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:00,930
your first ever,

1864
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:03,240
your first awesome paper ever

1865
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:05,820
and your second awesome paper ever.

1866
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:07,470
Of course, you wrote many papers.

1867
01:10:08,610 --> 01:10:10,740
You're being very harsh on the others.

1868
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:12,690
- Well, by the way,
this is not awesomeness.

1869
01:10:12,690 --> 01:10:14,370
This is impact, right?
- Impact.

1870
01:10:14,370 --> 01:10:15,420
Sure.

1871
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:17,993
- There's no correlation
between awesomeness and impact.

1872
01:10:17,993 --> 01:10:20,640
Some of my best papers
fell without a stone-

1873
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:22,290
- [Lex] Tree falls, the force.

1874
01:10:22,290 --> 01:10:23,580
Yeah.

1875
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:25,770
The first paper was called
"Limits on a Lorentz

1876
01:10:25,770 --> 01:10:27,720
and Parity Violating Modification

1877
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:29,940
of Electromagnetism or Electrodynamics."

1878
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:33,030
So we figured out how to
violate Lorentz variants,

1879
01:10:33,030 --> 01:10:35,550
which is the symmetry
underlying relativity.

1880
01:10:35,550 --> 01:10:38,670
And the important thing is
we figured out a way to do it

1881
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:41,130
that didn't violate anything else

1882
01:10:41,130 --> 01:10:43,050
and was experimentally testable.

1883
01:10:43,050 --> 01:10:45,600
So people love that.

1884
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,867
The second paper was called

1885
01:10:46,867 --> 01:10:49,110
"Quintessence and the Rest of the World."

1886
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:52,260
So quintessence is this
dynamical dark energy field.

1887
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:53,130
The rest of the world is

1888
01:10:53,130 --> 01:10:54,330
because I was talking about

1889
01:10:54,330 --> 01:10:56,280
how the quintessence field would interact

1890
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:57,630
with other particles and fields

1891
01:10:57,630 --> 01:11:01,260
and how to avoid the
interactions you don't want.

1892
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:04,477
And the third paper was called

1893
01:11:04,477 --> 01:11:09,420
"Is Cosmic Speed Up Due
to Gravitational Physics?"

1894
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:10,770
Something like that.

1895
01:11:10,770 --> 01:11:12,510
So you see the common theme,

1896
01:11:12,510 --> 01:11:14,220
I'm taking what we know,

1897
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:16,740
the standard model of particle
physics, general relativity,

1898
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:18,780
tweaking them in some way

1899
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:20,010
and then trying to fit the data.

1900
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:20,843
- And trying to make it

1901
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:22,590
so it's experimentally validated.

1902
01:11:22,590 --> 01:11:24,360
- Ideally, yes, that's right.

1903
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:25,650
That's the goal.

1904
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:27,780
- You wrote the book
"Something Deeply Hidden

1905
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:29,340
on the Mysteries of Quantum Mechanics"

1906
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:33,157
and a new book coming
out soon, part of that,

1907
01:11:33,157 --> 01:11:35,820
"Biggest Ideas in the
Universe" series we mentioned

1908
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:38,610
called "Quanta and Fields."

1909
01:11:38,610 --> 01:11:40,623
So that's focusing on quantum mechanics.

1910
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:43,830
Big question first,

1911
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:46,170
biggest ideas in the universe.

1912
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:48,780
What to you is most beautiful

1913
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:52,110
or perhaps most mysterious
about quantum mechanics?

1914
01:11:52,110 --> 01:11:54,480
- Quantum mechanics is a harder one.

1915
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,250
I wrote a textbook on general relativity

1916
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:58,110
and I started it by saying,

1917
01:11:58,110 --> 01:12:00,660
general relativity is most
beautiful physical theory

1918
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:01,493
ever invented.

1919
01:12:01,493 --> 01:12:03,080
And I will stand by that.

1920
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:06,300
It is less fundamental
than quantum mechanics,

1921
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:08,800
but quantum mechanics is
a little more mysterious.

1922
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,420
It's a little bit kludgy right now.

1923
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:15,840
If you think about how we
teach quantum mechanics

1924
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,360
to our students, the
Copenhagen interpretation,

1925
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:19,740
it's a god awful mess.

1926
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:23,220
No one's gonna accuse that
of being very beautiful.

1927
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:25,200
I'm a fan of the many
world's interpretation

1928
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:26,100
of quantum mechanics

1929
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:27,630
and that is very beautiful

1930
01:12:27,630 --> 01:12:30,810
in the sense that fewer ingredients,

1931
01:12:30,810 --> 01:12:31,950
just one equation,

1932
01:12:31,950 --> 01:12:34,100
and it could cover
everything in the world.

1933
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:36,780
It depends what you mean by beauty.

1934
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:38,910
But I think that the
answer to your question is,

1935
01:12:38,910 --> 01:12:40,080
quantum mechanics can start

1936
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:45,080
with extraordinarily
austere tiny ingredients

1937
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:47,433
and in principle lead to the world.

1938
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:51,577
That boggles my mind.

1939
01:12:51,577 --> 01:12:54,300
It's like much more comprehensive
general relativity is

1940
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:55,920
about gravity and that's great,

1941
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,200
quantum mechanics about everything

1942
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:00,660
and seems to be up to the task.

1943
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:01,493
And so I don't know,

1944
01:13:01,493 --> 01:13:02,490
is that beauty or not?

1945
01:13:02,490 --> 01:13:03,540
But it's certainly impressive.

1946
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:04,620
- So both for the theory,

1947
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:06,090
the predictive power of the theory

1948
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:08,700
and the fact that the theory
describes tiny things,

1949
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:10,770
creating everything we see around us.

1950
01:13:10,770 --> 01:13:15,770
- It's a monist theory
in classical mechanics.

1951
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,410
I have a particle here, particle there.

1952
01:13:19,410 --> 01:13:20,490
I describe them separately.

1953
01:13:20,490 --> 01:13:21,840
I can tell you what this particle's doing,

1954
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:22,770
what that particle's doing.

1955
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:23,603
In quantum mechanics,

1956
01:13:23,603 --> 01:13:24,870
we have entanglement,

1957
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:27,930
as Einstein pointed out to us in 1935.

1958
01:13:27,930 --> 01:13:28,770
And what that means is,

1959
01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:33,330
there is a single state
for these two particles.

1960
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:35,010
There's not one state for this particle,

1961
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:36,270
one state for the other particle.

1962
01:13:36,270 --> 01:13:38,160
And indeed, there's a single state

1963
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:40,410
for the whole universe
called the wave function

1964
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:41,243
of the universe,

1965
01:13:41,243 --> 01:13:42,450
if you wanna call it that.

1966
01:13:42,450 --> 01:13:45,510
And it obeys one equation

1967
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:49,230
and is our job then to sort of chop it up,

1968
01:13:49,230 --> 01:13:50,063
to carve it up,

1969
01:13:50,063 --> 01:13:51,750
to figure out how to get tables

1970
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:53,610
and chairs and things like that out of it.

1971
01:13:53,610 --> 01:13:56,130
- You mentioned the many
world's interpretation

1972
01:13:56,130 --> 01:13:58,770
and it is, in fact, beautiful,

1973
01:13:58,770 --> 01:14:02,220
but it's one of your
more controversial things

1974
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:03,720
you stand behind.

1975
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:05,550
You've probably gotten
a bunch of flack for it.

1976
01:14:05,550 --> 01:14:06,383
- I'm a big boy.

1977
01:14:06,383 --> 01:14:07,380
I can take it.

1978
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:09,190
- Well, can you first explain it

1979
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,120
and then maybe speak the
flag you may have gotten?

1980
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:12,960
- Sure.

1981
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:16,020
The classic experiment

1982
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:17,280
to explain quantum mechanics

1983
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:20,910
to people is called the
Stern-Gerlach experiment.

1984
01:14:20,910 --> 01:14:22,710
You're measuring the spin of a particle.

1985
01:14:22,710 --> 01:14:23,790
Okay?

1986
01:14:23,790 --> 01:14:26,700
And in quantum mechanics,

1987
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:28,440
the spin is just a spin.

1988
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:30,510
It's the rate at which
something is rotating around

1989
01:14:30,510 --> 01:14:32,040
in a very down to earth sense.

1990
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,530
The difference being
is that it's quantized.

1991
01:14:34,530 --> 01:14:36,870
So for something like a single electron

1992
01:14:36,870 --> 01:14:38,520
or a single neutron,

1993
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:41,850
it's either spinning
clockwise or counterclockwise.

1994
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:42,683
Those are the only two,

1995
01:14:42,683 --> 01:14:43,516
let's put it this way.

1996
01:14:43,516 --> 01:14:45,000
Those are the only two
measurement outcomes

1997
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,260
you will ever get.

1998
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:48,150
There's no it's spinning faster or slower,

1999
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,650
is either spinning one
direction or the other.

2000
01:14:49,650 --> 01:14:50,483
That's it.

2001
01:14:50,483 --> 01:14:51,316
Two choices.

2002
01:14:51,316 --> 01:14:52,350
Okay?

2003
01:14:52,350 --> 01:14:54,330
According to the rules
of quantum mechanics,

2004
01:14:54,330 --> 01:14:57,450
I can set up an electron, let's say,

2005
01:14:57,450 --> 01:15:01,710
in a state where it is
neither purely clockwise

2006
01:15:01,710 --> 01:15:02,820
or counterclockwise,

2007
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:05,370
but a super position of both.

2008
01:15:05,370 --> 01:15:06,270
And that's not just

2009
01:15:06,270 --> 01:15:07,500
because we don't know the answer.

2010
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:10,950
It's because it truly is
both until we measure it.

2011
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:11,820
And then when we measure it,

2012
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:13,230
we see one or the other.

2013
01:15:13,230 --> 01:15:15,390
So this is the fundamental
mystery of quantum mechanics,

2014
01:15:15,390 --> 01:15:17,130
is that how we describe the system

2015
01:15:17,130 --> 01:15:18,090
when we're not looking at it,

2016
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:21,000
is different from what we
see when we look at it.

2017
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,190
So we teach our students
in the Copenhagen way

2018
01:15:23,190 --> 01:15:27,330
of thinking is that the
act of measuring the spin

2019
01:15:27,330 --> 01:15:30,750
of the electron causes a radical change

2020
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:32,220
in the physical state.

2021
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:37,220
It spontaneously collapses
from being a super position

2022
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,240
of clockwise and counterclockwise

2023
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,650
to being one or the other.

2024
01:15:40,650 --> 01:15:43,230
And you can tell me the
probability that that happens,

2025
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:44,820
but that's all you can tell me.

2026
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:47,670
And I can't be very specific
about when it happens,

2027
01:15:47,670 --> 01:15:48,930
what caused it to happen,

2028
01:15:48,930 --> 01:15:50,400
why it's happening, none of that.

2029
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:52,590
That's all called the measurement problem

2030
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:53,793
of quantum mechanics.

2031
01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:57,750
So many worlds just says, look,

2032
01:15:57,750 --> 01:16:00,120
I just told you a minute ago

2033
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:03,240
that there's only one way
function for the whole universe.

2034
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:06,300
And that means that you
can't take too seriously

2035
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:08,070
just describing the electron.

2036
01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:10,170
You have to include everything
else in the universe.

2037
01:16:10,170 --> 01:16:11,490
In particular,

2038
01:16:11,490 --> 01:16:13,860
you clearly have to
interact with the electron

2039
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:15,630
in order to measure it.

2040
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:17,010
So whatever is interacting

2041
01:16:17,010 --> 01:16:20,340
with the electron should be
included in the wave function

2042
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:21,630
that you're describing.

2043
01:16:21,630 --> 01:16:22,980
And look, maybe it's just you,

2044
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:24,840
maybe your eyeballs are
able to perceive it.

2045
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:28,740
But, okay, I'm gonna include
you in the wave function.

2046
01:16:28,740 --> 01:16:30,063
And if you do that,

2047
01:16:31,410 --> 01:16:33,300
since you have a very
sophisticated listenership,

2048
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:35,673
I'll be a little bit more
careful than average.

2049
01:16:36,570 --> 01:16:39,840
What does it mean to measure
the spin of the electron?

2050
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,190
We don't need to go into details,

2051
01:16:41,190 --> 01:16:43,770
but we want the following
thing to be true.

2052
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:46,650
If the electron were in a state

2053
01:16:46,650 --> 01:16:49,740
that was a hundred percent
spinning clockwise,

2054
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:51,780
then we want the measurement

2055
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:53,580
to tell us it was spinning clockwise.

2056
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:55,110
We want your brain to go, yes,

2057
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:57,510
the electron was spinning clockwise.

2058
01:16:57,510 --> 01:16:59,850
Likewise, if it was a hundred
percent counterclockwise,

2059
01:16:59,850 --> 01:17:03,240
we want to to see that, to measure that.

2060
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:04,770
The rules of quantum mechanics,

2061
01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:05,880
the Schrödinger equation

2062
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:09,240
of quantum mechanics is a
hundred percent clear that if you

2063
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:12,360
to measure it clockwise
when it's clockwise

2064
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:15,570
and measure it counterclockwise
when it's counterclockwise,

2065
01:17:15,570 --> 01:17:18,783
then when it starts out
in a super position,

2066
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:21,387
what will happen is that you

2067
01:17:21,387 --> 01:17:26,190
and the electron will
entangle with each other.

2068
01:17:26,190 --> 01:17:27,023
And by that,

2069
01:17:27,023 --> 01:17:29,430
I mean that the state
of the universe evolves

2070
01:17:29,430 --> 01:17:32,850
into part saying the electron
was spinning clockwise

2071
01:17:32,850 --> 01:17:34,710
and I saw it clockwise.

2072
01:17:34,710 --> 01:17:36,900
And part of the state is
it's in a super position

2073
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:37,980
with the part

2074
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:39,990
that says the electron was
spinning counterclockwise,

2075
01:17:39,990 --> 01:17:42,270
and I saw it counterclockwise.

2076
01:17:42,270 --> 01:17:43,530
Everyone agrees with this.

2077
01:17:43,530 --> 01:17:45,120
Entirely uncontroversial,

2078
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:49,170
straightforward consequence
of the Schrödinger equation.

2079
01:17:49,170 --> 01:17:51,780
And then Niels Bohr would say,

2080
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:54,930
and then part of that
wave function disappears,

2081
01:17:54,930 --> 01:17:55,830
and we're in the other part.

2082
01:17:55,830 --> 01:17:57,210
And you can't predict which part it'll be,

2083
01:17:57,210 --> 01:17:58,263
only the probability.

2084
01:17:59,130 --> 01:18:01,650
Hugh Everett, who was a
graduate student in the 1950s,

2085
01:18:01,650 --> 01:18:02,767
was thinking about this, says,

2086
01:18:02,767 --> 01:18:04,740
"I have a better idea.

2087
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:07,230
Part of the wave function
does not magically disappear.

2088
01:18:07,230 --> 01:18:08,490
It stays there."

2089
01:18:08,490 --> 01:18:10,710
The reason why that idea,

2090
01:18:10,710 --> 01:18:13,170
Everett's idea that
the whole wave function

2091
01:18:13,170 --> 01:18:14,040
always sticks around

2092
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:16,950
and just obeys the Schrödinger
equation was not thought

2093
01:18:16,950 --> 01:18:19,080
of years before,

2094
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:20,430
is because naively,

2095
01:18:20,430 --> 01:18:21,263
you look at it

2096
01:18:21,263 --> 01:18:23,520
and you go, okay, this is predicting

2097
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:26,700
that I will be in a super position,

2098
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:28,830
that I will be in a super position

2099
01:18:28,830 --> 01:18:32,040
of having seen the electron be clockwise

2100
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,170
and having seen it be counterclockwise.

2101
01:18:34,170 --> 01:18:36,002
No experimenter has
ever felt like they were

2102
01:18:36,002 --> 01:18:37,320
in a super position.

2103
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:39,180
You always see an outcome.

2104
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:40,013
Okay.

2105
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:42,870
Everett's move,

2106
01:18:42,870 --> 01:18:44,010
which was kind of genius,

2107
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:47,160
was to say the problem is
not the Schrödinger equation.

2108
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:50,700
The problem is you have
misidentified yourself

2109
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:51,960
in the Schrödinger equation.

2110
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:52,980
You have said, oh look,

2111
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:55,650
there's a person who saw counterclockwise,

2112
01:18:55,650 --> 01:18:58,530
there's a person who saw clockwise.

2113
01:18:58,530 --> 01:19:01,800
I should be that super position of both

2114
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,690
and Everett says, no, no, no, you're not.

2115
01:19:03,690 --> 01:19:05,540
Because the part of the wave function

2116
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:09,270
in which the spin was clockwise,

2117
01:19:09,270 --> 01:19:10,920
once that exists,

2118
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:13,860
it is completely unaffected

2119
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:15,153
by the part of the wave function

2120
01:19:15,153 --> 01:19:17,670
that says the spin was counterclockwise.

2121
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:20,040
They are apart from each other.

2122
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:21,595
They're uninteracting.

2123
01:19:21,595 --> 01:19:23,040
They have no influence.

2124
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:25,350
What happens in one part has
no influence in the other part.

2125
01:19:25,350 --> 01:19:28,140
So Everett says the simple resolution is

2126
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:31,980
to identify yourself as either the one

2127
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:33,600
who saw spin clockwise

2128
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:36,540
or the one who saw spin counterclockwise.

2129
01:19:36,540 --> 01:19:38,520
There are now two people.

2130
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,230
Once you've done that experiment,

2131
01:19:40,230 --> 01:19:42,570
the Schrödinger equation
doesn't have to be messed with.

2132
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:45,120
All you have to do is
locate yourself correctly

2133
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,260
in the wave function.

2134
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:47,640
That's many worlds.

2135
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:50,340
- The number of worlds is-

2136
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:51,173
- [Sean] Very big.

2137
01:19:51,173 --> 01:19:54,120
- [Lex] Very, very, very big.

2138
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:57,090
Where do those worlds fit?

2139
01:19:57,090 --> 01:19:58,200
Where they go?

2140
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,583
- The short answer is,

2141
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:04,653
the worlds don't exist in space.

2142
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:10,470
Space exists separately in each world.

2143
01:20:10,470 --> 01:20:12,510
So, I mean, there's a technical
answer to your question,

2144
01:20:12,510 --> 01:20:13,530
which is Hilbert space,

2145
01:20:13,530 --> 01:20:16,470
the space of all possible
quantum mechanical states.

2146
01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:18,120
But physically,

2147
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:20,160
we want to put these worlds somewhere.

2148
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:24,060
That's just a wrong
intuition that we have.

2149
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:27,000
There is no such thing as
the physical spatial location

2150
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:27,833
of the worlds

2151
01:20:27,833 --> 01:20:29,220
'cause space is inside the worlds.

2152
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:30,390
- One of the properties

2153
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:33,330
of this interpretation
is that you can't travel

2154
01:20:33,330 --> 01:20:34,800
from one world to the other-

2155
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:35,633
- [Sean] That's right.

2156
01:20:35,633 --> 01:20:37,960
- [Lex] Which kind of makes you feel

2157
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,230
that they're existing separately.

2158
01:20:43,230 --> 01:20:45,660
- They are existing
separately and simultaneously.

2159
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:46,920
- [Lex] And simultaneously.

2160
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:48,330
- Without locations in space.

2161
01:20:48,330 --> 01:20:50,490
- Without locations in space.

2162
01:20:50,490 --> 01:20:51,750
How is it possible

2163
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:55,050
to visualize them existing
without a location in space?

2164
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:56,220
- The real answer to that,

2165
01:20:56,220 --> 01:21:00,390
the honest answer is
the equations predicted.

2166
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:01,650
- [Lex] Yeah, yeah.

2167
01:21:01,650 --> 01:21:04,140
- If you can't visualize it,

2168
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:05,220
so much worse for you,

2169
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:06,690
the equations are crystal clear

2170
01:21:06,690 --> 01:21:07,770
about what they're predicting.

2171
01:21:07,770 --> 01:21:11,730
- Is there a way to get to
the closer to understanding

2172
01:21:11,730 --> 01:21:15,093
and visualizing the weirdness
of the implications of this?

2173
01:21:16,230 --> 01:21:17,063
- I don't think it's that hard.

2174
01:21:17,063 --> 01:21:19,170
It wasn't that hard for me.

2175
01:21:19,170 --> 01:21:22,050
I don't mind the idea

2176
01:21:22,050 --> 01:21:25,560
that when I make a quantum
mechanical measurement,

2177
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:28,050
there is later on in the universe,

2178
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:30,420
multiple descendants of my present self

2179
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:32,910
who got different answers
for that measurement.

2180
01:21:32,910 --> 01:21:34,653
I can't interact with them.

2181
01:21:36,150 --> 01:21:37,650
Hilbert space, the space ball,

2182
01:21:37,650 --> 01:21:39,690
quantum wave functions
was always big enough

2183
01:21:39,690 --> 01:21:41,433
to include all of them.

2184
01:21:42,510 --> 01:21:44,760
I'm gonna worry about the parts

2185
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:46,320
of the universe I can observe.

2186
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,483
So let's put it this way.

2187
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,090
Many worlds comes about

2188
01:21:51,090 --> 01:21:53,670
by taking the Schrödinger
equation seriously.

2189
01:21:53,670 --> 01:21:56,730
The Schrödinger equation was
invented to fit the data,

2190
01:21:56,730 --> 01:21:58,650
to fit the spectrum of different atoms

2191
01:21:58,650 --> 01:22:02,220
and different emission and
absorption experiments.

2192
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:04,890
And it's perfectly legitimate

2193
01:22:04,890 --> 01:22:08,580
to say, well, okay, you're
taking the Schrödinger equation,

2194
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:12,330
you're extrapolating
it, you're trusting it,

2195
01:22:12,330 --> 01:22:16,080
believing it beyond what we can observe.

2196
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,850
I don't wanna do that, right?

2197
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:18,750
That's perfectly legit.

2198
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:21,723
Except, okay, then what do you believe?

2199
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:24,750
Come up with a better theory.

2200
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:27,330
You're saying you don't believe
the Schrödinger equation.

2201
01:22:27,330 --> 01:22:29,883
Tell me the equation that you believe in.

2202
01:22:30,750 --> 01:22:32,160
And people have done that.

2203
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:34,050
Turns out it's super hard

2204
01:22:34,050 --> 01:22:36,960
to do that in a legitimate
way that fits the data.

2205
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:40,020
- And many worlds is a really clean.

2206
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:42,660
- Absolutely, the most austere, clean,

2207
01:22:42,660 --> 01:22:45,450
no extra baggage theory
of quantum mechanics.

2208
01:22:45,450 --> 01:22:48,810
- If it in fact is correct,

2209
01:22:48,810 --> 01:22:53,810
isn't this the weirdest
thing of anything we know?

2210
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:56,310
- Yes.

2211
01:22:56,310 --> 01:22:58,170
Let me put it this way.

2212
01:22:58,170 --> 01:23:01,980
The single best reason in my mind

2213
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:04,410
to be skeptical about many worlds is not

2214
01:23:04,410 --> 01:23:06,750
because it doesn't make sense

2215
01:23:06,750 --> 01:23:07,980
or it doesn't fit the data,

2216
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:10,980
or I don't know where the
worlds are going or whatever.

2217
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:14,820
It's because to make that extrapolation,

2218
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:16,350
to take seriously the equation

2219
01:23:16,350 --> 01:23:17,340
that we know is correct

2220
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:21,510
in other regimes requires new philosophy,

2221
01:23:21,510 --> 01:23:24,450
requires a new way of
thinking about identity,

2222
01:23:24,450 --> 01:23:26,880
about probability, about prediction,

2223
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,143
a whole bunch of things.

2224
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:30,720
It's work to do that philosophy

2225
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:31,553
and I've been doing it

2226
01:23:31,553 --> 01:23:32,386
and others have done it.

2227
01:23:32,386 --> 01:23:34,710
And I think it's very, very doable.

2228
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:37,830
But it's not straightforward.

2229
01:23:37,830 --> 01:23:40,290
It's not a simple extrapolation

2230
01:23:40,290 --> 01:23:41,340
from what we already know.

2231
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:44,490
It's a grand extrapolation very far away.

2232
01:23:44,490 --> 01:23:46,380
And if you just wanted to be sort

2233
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:48,840
of methodologically conservative

2234
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:51,090
and say that's a step too far,

2235
01:23:51,090 --> 01:23:52,560
I don't wanna buy it,

2236
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:53,790
I'm sympathetic to that.

2237
01:23:53,790 --> 01:23:56,040
I think that you're just wimping out.

2238
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:58,200
I think that you should have more courage.

2239
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:00,210
But I get the impulse.

2240
01:24:00,210 --> 01:24:03,840
- And there is, under many worlds,

2241
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:08,840
an arrow of time where
if you rewind it back,

2242
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:13,410
there's going to be one initial state.

2243
01:24:13,410 --> 01:24:14,243
- That's right.

2244
01:24:14,243 --> 01:24:15,076
All of quantum mechanics,

2245
01:24:15,076 --> 01:24:17,660
all different versions require
a kind of arrow of time.

2246
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:19,770
It might be different in every kind.

2247
01:24:19,770 --> 01:24:24,770
But the quantum measurement
process is irreversible.

2248
01:24:25,470 --> 01:24:26,310
You can measure something,

2249
01:24:26,310 --> 01:24:27,143
it collapses.

2250
01:24:27,143 --> 01:24:27,976
You can't go backwards.

2251
01:24:27,976 --> 01:24:29,160
If someone tells you the outcome,

2252
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:31,470
if I say I've measured an electron,

2253
01:24:31,470 --> 01:24:33,900
spin is clockwise and they say,

2254
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:36,330
what was it before I measured it?

2255
01:24:36,330 --> 01:24:38,250
There was some part of
it that was clockwise,

2256
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:40,350
but you don't know how much.

2257
01:24:40,350 --> 01:24:42,150
And many worlds is no different.

2258
01:24:42,150 --> 01:24:43,680
But the nice thing is,

2259
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:45,200
that the kind of arrow of time you need

2260
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:47,510
in many worlds is
exactly the kind of arrow

2261
01:24:47,510 --> 01:24:50,310
of time you need anyway for entropy

2262
01:24:50,310 --> 01:24:51,780
and thermodynamics and so forth.

2263
01:24:51,780 --> 01:24:54,630
You need a simple, low
entropy initial state.

2264
01:24:54,630 --> 01:24:56,250
That's what you need in both cases.

2265
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:59,340
- So if you actually
look at under many worlds

2266
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:02,370
into the entire history of the universe,

2267
01:25:02,370 --> 01:25:03,420
correct me if I'm wrong,

2268
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:06,150
but it looks very deterministic.

2269
01:25:06,150 --> 01:25:06,983
- Yes.

2270
01:25:06,983 --> 01:25:08,010
- In each moment,

2271
01:25:08,010 --> 01:25:09,690
does the moment contain the memory

2272
01:25:09,690 --> 01:25:11,580
of the entire history of the universe?

2273
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:15,210
To you, does the moment contain the memory

2274
01:25:15,210 --> 01:25:17,220
of everything that preceded it?

2275
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:18,840
- As far as we know,

2276
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:21,210
so according to many worlds,

2277
01:25:21,210 --> 01:25:23,220
the way function of the universe,

2278
01:25:23,220 --> 01:25:24,870
all the branches of the universe at once,

2279
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:27,513
all the worlds does contain
all the information.

2280
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:31,983
Calling it a memory is
a little bit dangerous

2281
01:25:34,230 --> 01:25:35,350
'cause it's not the same
kind of memory that you

2282
01:25:35,350 --> 01:25:37,380
and I have in our brains

2283
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:40,980
because our memories rely
on the arrow of time.

2284
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:42,870
And the whole point

2285
01:25:42,870 --> 01:25:45,720
of the Schrödinger equation
or Newton's laws is

2286
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:48,090
they don't have an arrow of time built in.

2287
01:25:48,090 --> 01:25:49,290
They're reversible.

2288
01:25:49,290 --> 01:25:52,830
The state of the universe
not only remembers

2289
01:25:52,830 --> 01:25:53,663
where it came from,

2290
01:25:53,663 --> 01:25:55,380
but also determines where it's going to go

2291
01:25:55,380 --> 01:25:57,720
in a way that our memories don't do that.

2292
01:25:57,720 --> 01:25:58,590
- But our memories,

2293
01:25:58,590 --> 01:26:00,360
we can do replay.

2294
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:01,193
Can you do this?

2295
01:26:01,193 --> 01:26:02,026
- We can,

2296
01:26:02,026 --> 01:26:03,958
but the act of forming a
memory increases the entropy

2297
01:26:03,958 --> 01:26:05,190
of the universe.

2298
01:26:05,190 --> 01:26:07,443
It is an irreversible process also.

2299
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:11,850
You can walk on a beach and
leave your footprints there.

2300
01:26:11,850 --> 01:26:13,473
That's a record of your passing.

2301
01:26:14,310 --> 01:26:15,600
It will eventually be erased

2302
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:18,090
by the ever increasing
entropy of the universe.

2303
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:20,670
Well, but you can imperfectly replay it.

2304
01:26:20,670 --> 01:26:25,670
I guess, can we return travel
back in time imperfectly?

2305
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:29,100
- Oh, it depends on the level

2306
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:31,470
of precision you're trying
to ask that question.

2307
01:26:31,470 --> 01:26:35,160
The universe contains the information

2308
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:36,720
about where the universe was,

2309
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:37,860
but you and I don't,

2310
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:39,090
we're nowhere close.

2311
01:26:39,090 --> 01:26:43,230
- And it's what computationally
very costly to try

2312
01:26:43,230 --> 01:26:45,540
to consult the universe.

2313
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:46,980
- Well, it depends on, again,

2314
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:47,910
exactly what you're asking.

2315
01:26:47,910 --> 01:26:50,910
Like there are some simple questions.

2316
01:26:50,910 --> 01:26:54,150
What was the temperature
of the universe 30 seconds

2317
01:26:54,150 --> 01:26:55,590
after the Big Bang?

2318
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:56,583
We can answer that.

2319
01:26:57,810 --> 01:27:00,240
That's kind of amazing
that we can answer that

2320
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:02,280
to pretty high precision.

2321
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:04,440
But if you wanna know
where every atom was,

2322
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:05,820
then no.

2323
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:08,673
- What to you is the Big Bang?

2324
01:27:10,830 --> 01:27:11,790
Why?

2325
01:27:11,790 --> 01:27:13,110
why did it happen?

2326
01:27:13,110 --> 01:27:14,280
- We have no idea.

2327
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:17,430
I think that's a super important question

2328
01:27:17,430 --> 01:27:19,920
that I can imagine making progress on.

2329
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:20,753
But right now,

2330
01:27:20,753 --> 01:27:23,130
I'm more or less maximally uncertain

2331
01:27:23,130 --> 01:27:23,963
about what the answer is.

2332
01:27:23,963 --> 01:27:25,770
- You think black holes will help?

2333
01:27:25,770 --> 01:27:26,970
- No, potentially.

2334
01:27:26,970 --> 01:27:27,963
Not that much.

2335
01:27:28,860 --> 01:27:30,180
Quantum gravity will help

2336
01:27:30,180 --> 01:27:31,710
and maybe black holes
will help us figure out

2337
01:27:31,710 --> 01:27:34,620
quantum gravity so indirectly, yes.

2338
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:38,250
But we have this situation
where general relativity,

2339
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:40,770
Einstein's theory unambiguously predicts

2340
01:27:40,770 --> 01:27:42,570
there was a singularity in the past.

2341
01:27:42,570 --> 01:27:44,230
There was a moment of time

2342
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:48,300
when the universe had infinite
curvature, infinite energy,

2343
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:50,490
infinite expansion rate, the whole bit.

2344
01:27:50,490 --> 01:27:55,490
That's just a fancy way of
saying the theory has broken down

2345
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:57,870
and classical general
relativity is not up to the task

2346
01:27:57,870 --> 01:28:00,570
of what's saying what really
happened at that moment.

2347
01:28:00,570 --> 01:28:02,130
So it is completely possible.

2348
01:28:02,130 --> 01:28:05,820
There was in some sense a moment of time

2349
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:08,340
before which there were no other moments.

2350
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:09,480
And that would be the Big Bang.

2351
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:11,220
Even if it's not a
classical general relativity

2352
01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:12,053
kind of thing,

2353
01:28:12,053 --> 01:28:13,650
even if quantum mechanics is involved,

2354
01:28:13,650 --> 01:28:14,970
maybe that's what happened.

2355
01:28:14,970 --> 01:28:16,710
It's also completely possible.

2356
01:28:16,710 --> 01:28:19,590
There was time before that space and time

2357
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:22,890
and they evolved into our hot
Big Bang by some procedure

2358
01:28:22,890 --> 01:28:24,390
that we don't really understand.

2359
01:28:24,390 --> 01:28:26,010
- And if time and space are emergent,

2360
01:28:26,010 --> 01:28:29,940
then the before even
starts getting real weird.

2361
01:28:29,940 --> 01:28:34,320
- Well, I think that if there
is a first moment of time,

2362
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:36,570
that would be very good evidence

2363
01:28:36,570 --> 01:28:37,890
or that would fit hand in glove

2364
01:28:37,890 --> 01:28:40,110
with the idea that time is emergent.

2365
01:28:40,110 --> 01:28:40,983
If time is fundamental,

2366
01:28:40,983 --> 01:28:42,780
then it tends to go forever

2367
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:44,340
because it's fundamental.

2368
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:46,920
- Well, yeah, I mean,
the general formulation

2369
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:48,660
of this question is what's outside of it.

2370
01:28:48,660 --> 01:28:50,850
Well, what's outside of our universe?

2371
01:28:50,850 --> 01:28:53,100
So in time and in space.

2372
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:55,140
I know it's a pothead question, Sean.

2373
01:28:55,140 --> 01:28:56,148
I understand.

2374
01:28:56,148 --> 01:28:57,360
(Sean laughs)

2375
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:58,770
- I apologize.
- That's my life.

2376
01:28:58,770 --> 01:29:00,210
My life is asking pothead questions.

2377
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:01,043
- [Lex] Okay.

2378
01:29:01,043 --> 01:29:01,885
- Some of them,

2379
01:29:01,885 --> 01:29:03,330
the answer is that's not the
right way to think about it.

2380
01:29:03,330 --> 01:29:04,163
- Okay.

2381
01:29:04,163 --> 01:29:06,870
But is it possible to think at all

2382
01:29:06,870 --> 01:29:09,660
about what's outside our universe?

2383
01:29:09,660 --> 01:29:12,390
- It's absolutely legit to ask questions,

2384
01:29:12,390 --> 01:29:14,580
but you have to be comfortable
with the possibility

2385
01:29:14,580 --> 01:29:16,080
that the answer is there's no such thing

2386
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:17,550
as outside our universe.

2387
01:29:17,550 --> 01:29:18,810
That's absolutely on the table.

2388
01:29:18,810 --> 01:29:20,583
In fact, that is the simplest,

2389
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:24,090
most likely to be correct
answer that we know of.

2390
01:29:24,090 --> 01:29:28,140
- But it's the only thing in the universe

2391
01:29:28,140 --> 01:29:29,793
that wouldn't have an outside.

2392
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:32,033
- Yeah.

2393
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:33,390
If the universe is the
totality of everything,

2394
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:34,560
it would not have an outside.

2395
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:37,653
- That's so weird to think
that there's not an outside.

2396
01:29:40,538 --> 01:29:45,300
We want there to be sort
of a a creative force

2397
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:48,900
that led to this and an
outside like this is our town,

2398
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:50,370
and then there's a bigger world

2399
01:29:50,370 --> 01:29:51,819
and there's always a bigger world-

2400
01:29:51,819 --> 01:29:54,090
- Because that is our experience,

2401
01:29:54,090 --> 01:29:56,460
that's the world we grew up in, right?

2402
01:29:56,460 --> 01:30:00,600
The universe doesn't
need to obey those rules.

2403
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:02,520
- Such a weird thing.

2404
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:03,353
- When I was a kid,

2405
01:30:03,353 --> 01:30:04,290
that used to keep me up at night,

2406
01:30:04,290 --> 01:30:06,840
like, what if the
universe had not existed?

2407
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:07,860
- Right.

2408
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:11,130
And it feels like a lot of pressure

2409
01:30:11,130 --> 01:30:16,080
that if this is the only
universe and we're here,

2410
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:18,960
one of the few intelligent civilizations,

2411
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:21,150
maybe the only one,

2412
01:30:21,150 --> 01:30:23,390
it's the old theories that
we're the center of everything.

2413
01:30:23,390 --> 01:30:25,260
It just feels suspicious.

2414
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:27,660
That's why many worlds
is kind of exciting to me

2415
01:30:27,660 --> 01:30:31,650
because it's humbling in
all the right kinds of ways.

2416
01:30:31,650 --> 01:30:36,650
It feels like infinity is the
way this whole thing runs.

2417
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:40,380
- There's one pitfall
that I'll just mention

2418
01:30:40,380 --> 01:30:41,880
because there's a move

2419
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:44,760
that is made in these
theoretical edges of cosmology

2420
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:45,960
that I think is a little bit mistaken,

2421
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:47,280
which is to say,

2422
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:51,210
I'm going to think about
the universe on the basis

2423
01:30:51,210 --> 01:30:55,200
of imagining that I am a typical observer.

2424
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,035
This is called the
principle of typicality,

2425
01:30:57,035 --> 01:30:58,320
or the principle of mediocrity,

2426
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:00,120
or even the Copernican principle.

2427
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:01,470
Nothing special about me.

2428
01:31:01,470 --> 01:31:03,930
I'm just typical in the universe.

2429
01:31:03,930 --> 01:31:06,630
But then you draw some
conclusions from this

2430
01:31:06,630 --> 01:31:08,670
and what you end up realizing is

2431
01:31:08,670 --> 01:31:11,160
you've been hilariously presumptuous

2432
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:13,860
because by saying I'm a typical
observer in the universe,

2433
01:31:13,860 --> 01:31:15,360
you're saying typical observers

2434
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:16,760
in the universe are like me.

2435
01:31:17,670 --> 01:31:20,700
And that is completely
unjustified by anything.

2436
01:31:20,700 --> 01:31:23,400
So I'm not telling you what
the right way to do it is,

2437
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:24,780
but these kinds of questions

2438
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:29,070
that are not quite grounded
in experimental verification

2439
01:31:29,070 --> 01:31:33,600
or falsification are ones you
have to be very careful about.

2440
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:36,333
- That to me is one of the
most interesting questions.

2441
01:31:37,250 --> 01:31:39,150
There's different ways to approach it,

2442
01:31:39,150 --> 01:31:40,950
but like what's outside of this?

2443
01:31:40,950 --> 01:31:42,720
How did the big mess start?

2444
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:44,570
How do we get something from nothing?

2445
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:48,190
That's always the thing
you're sneaking up to

2446
01:31:49,710 --> 01:31:51,600
when you're studying
all of these questions.

2447
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:52,680
You're always sneaking.

2448
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:54,510
That's where the black
hole and the unifying,

2449
01:31:54,510 --> 01:31:55,470
getting quantum gravity,

2450
01:31:55,470 --> 01:31:56,303
all this kind of stuff.

2451
01:31:56,303 --> 01:31:58,383
You're always sneaking
up to that question,

2452
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:01,383
where did all of this come from?

2453
01:32:02,970 --> 01:32:07,473
And I think that's probably
an answerable question, right?

2454
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:10,230
- No.

2455
01:32:10,230 --> 01:32:11,250
- It doesn't have to be.

2456
01:32:11,250 --> 01:32:13,260
So you think there could
be a turtle at the bottom

2457
01:32:13,260 --> 01:32:17,477
of this that refuses
to reveal its identity.

2458
01:32:17,477 --> 01:32:20,460
- Yes.

2459
01:32:20,460 --> 01:32:21,750
Specifically, the question,

2460
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:23,250
why is there something
rather than nothing?

2461
01:32:23,250 --> 01:32:24,450
- [Lex] Yeah.

2462
01:32:24,450 --> 01:32:26,670
- Does not have the kind of answer

2463
01:32:26,670 --> 01:32:29,763
that we would ordinarily
attribute to why questions.

2464
01:32:33,270 --> 01:32:35,400
Because the typical why
questions are embedded

2465
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:36,690
in the universe.

2466
01:32:36,690 --> 01:32:37,830
And when we answer them,

2467
01:32:37,830 --> 01:32:39,240
we take advantage of the features

2468
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:40,830
of the universe that we know and love.

2469
01:32:40,830 --> 01:32:42,630
But the universe itself,
as far as we know,

2470
01:32:42,630 --> 01:32:45,600
is not embedded in
anything bigger or stronger

2471
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,760
and therefore it can just be.

2472
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:51,660
- Do you think it's possible
this whole place is simulated?

2473
01:32:51,660 --> 01:32:52,493
- [Sean] Sure.

2474
01:32:52,493 --> 01:32:55,860
- It's a really interesting
dark twisted video game

2475
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:57,420
we're all existing in.

2476
01:32:57,420 --> 01:32:59,160
- My own podcast listeners,

2477
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:01,530
Mindscape listeners tease me

2478
01:33:01,530 --> 01:33:04,200
because they know from my MA episodes

2479
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:08,010
that if you ever start
a question by asking,

2480
01:33:08,010 --> 01:33:10,380
do you think it's possible that...

2481
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:11,680
The answer's gonna be yes.

2482
01:33:12,990 --> 01:33:15,840
That might not be the
answer that you care about,

2483
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,130
but it's possible, sure,

2484
01:33:17,130 --> 01:33:20,490
as long as you're not adding
two even numbers together

2485
01:33:20,490 --> 01:33:21,840
and getting an odd number.

2486
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:23,370
- When you say it's possible,

2487
01:33:23,370 --> 01:33:24,720
there's a mathematically yes

2488
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:26,790
and then there's more of like intuitive.

2489
01:33:26,790 --> 01:33:27,623
- Yeah.

2490
01:33:27,623 --> 01:33:29,160
You wanna know whether it's plausible.

2491
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:29,993
You wanna know,

2492
01:33:29,993 --> 01:33:33,480
is there reasonable non-zero
credence to attach to this?

2493
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:34,650
I don't think

2494
01:33:34,650 --> 01:33:39,650
that there's any philosophical
knockout objection

2495
01:33:40,110 --> 01:33:42,180
to the simulation hypothesis.

2496
01:33:42,180 --> 01:33:43,950
I also think that there's
absolutely no reason

2497
01:33:43,950 --> 01:33:45,780
to take it seriously.

2498
01:33:45,780 --> 01:33:47,850
- Do you think humans
will try to create one?

2499
01:33:47,850 --> 01:33:50,223
I guess that's how I
always think about it.

2500
01:33:52,530 --> 01:33:56,580
I've spent quite a bit of
time over the past few years

2501
01:33:56,580 --> 01:33:59,080
and a lot more recently in virtual worlds

2502
01:34:00,210 --> 01:34:04,200
and just am always
captivated by the possibility

2503
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:06,750
of creating higher and
higher resolution worlds.

2504
01:34:06,750 --> 01:34:08,640
And as we'll talk a little bit

2505
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:10,500
about artificial intelligence,

2506
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:13,203
sort of the advancement on the SOA front,

2507
01:34:14,340 --> 01:34:16,960
that you can automatically
generate those worlds

2508
01:34:18,210 --> 01:34:19,770
and the possibility of existing

2509
01:34:19,770 --> 01:34:22,980
in those automatically generated
worlds is pretty exciting

2510
01:34:22,980 --> 01:34:25,857
as long as there's a consistent
physics, quantum mechanics,

2511
01:34:25,857 --> 01:34:27,060
and general relativity

2512
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:29,100
that governs the
generation of those worlds.

2513
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:30,540
- [Sean] Yep.

2514
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:33,300
- So it just seems like
humans will, for sure,

2515
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:34,710
try to create this.

2516
01:34:34,710 --> 01:34:36,780
- Yeah, I think they will create better

2517
01:34:36,780 --> 01:34:37,830
and better simulations.

2518
01:34:37,830 --> 01:34:40,710
I think the philosopher
David Chalmers has done

2519
01:34:40,710 --> 01:34:42,780
what I consider to be
a good job of arguing

2520
01:34:42,780 --> 01:34:45,570
that we should treat things
that happen in virtual reality

2521
01:34:45,570 --> 01:34:48,630
and in simulated realities as just as real

2522
01:34:48,630 --> 01:34:50,910
as the reality that we experience.

2523
01:34:50,910 --> 01:34:53,310
I also think that as a practical matter,

2524
01:34:53,310 --> 01:34:55,650
people will realize how much harder it is

2525
01:34:55,650 --> 01:34:59,430
to simulate a realistic
than we naively believe.

2526
01:34:59,430 --> 01:35:02,070
So this is not a my
lifetime kind of worry.

2527
01:35:02,070 --> 01:35:02,903
- Yeah.

2528
01:35:02,903 --> 01:35:05,880
The practical matter of going
from a sort of a prototype

2529
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:09,003
that's impressive to a thing
that governs everything.

2530
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:13,233
Similar question on this front is in AGI.

2531
01:35:14,430 --> 01:35:17,910
You said that we're
very far away from AGI.

2532
01:35:17,910 --> 01:35:20,133
- I want to eliminate the phrase AGI.

2533
01:35:21,450 --> 01:35:25,590
- So, basically, when you're
analyzing large language models

2534
01:35:25,590 --> 01:35:28,620
and seeing how far are
they from whatever AGI is,

2535
01:35:28,620 --> 01:35:30,840
and we can talk about
different right notions

2536
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:33,270
of intelligence that we're not as close

2537
01:35:33,270 --> 01:35:38,270
as kind of some people in
public view are talking about.

2538
01:35:39,450 --> 01:35:41,250
So what's your intuition behind that?

2539
01:35:41,250 --> 01:35:42,690
- My intuition is basically

2540
01:35:42,690 --> 01:35:46,470
that artificial intelligence is different

2541
01:35:46,470 --> 01:35:48,120
than human intelligence.

2542
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:51,840
And so the mistake that is
being made by focusing on a GI

2543
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:56,400
among those who do is an artificial agent

2544
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:57,780
that as we can make them now

2545
01:35:57,780 --> 01:36:01,800
or in the near future might be
way better than human beings

2546
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:03,060
at some things,

2547
01:36:03,060 --> 01:36:05,940
way worse than human
beings at other things.

2548
01:36:05,940 --> 01:36:08,250
And rather than trying
to ask how close is it

2549
01:36:08,250 --> 01:36:10,290
to being a human-like intelligent,

2550
01:36:10,290 --> 01:36:13,500
we should appreciate it for
what its capabilities are

2551
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:15,870
and that will both be more accurate

2552
01:36:15,870 --> 01:36:17,940
and help us put it to work

2553
01:36:17,940 --> 01:36:19,980
and protect us from the dangers better

2554
01:36:19,980 --> 01:36:22,710
rather than always anthropomorphizing it.

2555
01:36:22,710 --> 01:36:27,120
- I think the underlying idea
there under the definition

2556
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:32,120
of AGI is that the capabilities
are extremely impressive.

2557
01:36:35,130 --> 01:36:36,180
That's not a precise statement,

2558
01:36:36,180 --> 01:36:37,013
but meaning-
- Sure.

2559
01:36:37,013 --> 01:36:37,846
No, I get that.

2560
01:36:37,846 --> 01:36:38,679
I completely agree .

2561
01:36:38,679 --> 01:36:40,440
- And then the underlying question

2562
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:41,850
where a lot of the debate is,

2563
01:36:41,850 --> 01:36:43,860
is how impressive is it?

2564
01:36:43,860 --> 01:36:46,050
What are the limits of
large language models?

2565
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:49,410
Can they really do things
like common sense reasoning?

2566
01:36:49,410 --> 01:36:52,290
How much do they really
understand about the world?

2567
01:36:52,290 --> 01:36:54,963
Or are they just fancy mimicry machines?

2568
01:36:57,420 --> 01:36:59,020
Where do you fall on that

2569
01:36:59,020 --> 01:37:02,820
as to the limits of large language models?

2570
01:37:02,820 --> 01:37:07,770
- I don't think that there
are many limits in principle.

2571
01:37:07,770 --> 01:37:10,470
I'm a physicalist about consciousness

2572
01:37:10,470 --> 01:37:11,730
and awareness and things like that.

2573
01:37:11,730 --> 01:37:13,260
I see no obstacle

2574
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:16,590
in principle building
an artificial machine

2575
01:37:16,590 --> 01:37:18,420
that is indistinguishable in thought

2576
01:37:18,420 --> 01:37:20,460
and cognition from a human being.

2577
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:23,430
But we're not trying to do that, right?

2578
01:37:23,430 --> 01:37:25,080
What a large language model is trying

2579
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:27,540
to do is to predict text.

2580
01:37:27,540 --> 01:37:29,010
That's what it does.

2581
01:37:29,010 --> 01:37:32,820
And it is leveraging the
fact that we human beings

2582
01:37:32,820 --> 01:37:37,560
for very good evolutionary
biology reasons,

2583
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:40,530
attribute intentionality and intelligence

2584
01:37:40,530 --> 01:37:44,250
and agency to things that
act like human beings.

2585
01:37:44,250 --> 01:37:48,900
As I was driving here to
get to this podcast space,

2586
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:51,000
I was using Google Maps

2587
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,950
and Google Maps was talking to me,

2588
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:55,800
but I wanted to stop
to get a cup of coffee.

2589
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:58,290
So I didn't do what
Google Maps told me to do.

2590
01:37:58,290 --> 01:38:01,020
I went around a block that it didn't like.

2591
01:38:01,020 --> 01:38:03,810
And so it gets annoyed.

2592
01:38:03,810 --> 01:38:05,670
It says like, no, why are you doing it?

2593
01:38:05,670 --> 01:38:06,810
It doesn't say exactly in this,

2594
01:38:06,810 --> 01:38:07,740
but you know what I mean.

2595
01:38:07,740 --> 01:38:09,210
It's like no turn left, turn left,

2596
01:38:09,210 --> 01:38:10,560
and you turn right.

2597
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:13,710
It is impossible as a human being not

2598
01:38:13,710 --> 01:38:15,000
to feel a little bit sad

2599
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,950
that Google Maps is getting mad at you.

2600
01:38:17,850 --> 01:38:19,400
It's not even trying to.

2601
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:21,510
It's not a large language model.

2602
01:38:21,510 --> 01:38:23,490
No aspirations to intentionality,

2603
01:38:23,490 --> 01:38:26,370
but we attribute that all the time.

2604
01:38:26,370 --> 01:38:27,840
Dan Dennett, the philosopher,

2605
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:32,840
wrote a very influential paper,
"The Intentional Stance,"

2606
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:35,970
the fact that it's the most
natural thing in the world

2607
01:38:35,970 --> 01:38:39,660
for we human beings to
attribute more intentionality

2608
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:42,270
to artificial things
than are really there,

2609
01:38:42,270 --> 01:38:44,700
which is not to say it
can't be really there.

2610
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:47,070
But if you're trying to be rational

2611
01:38:47,070 --> 01:38:48,840
and clear thinking about this,

2612
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:53,250
the first step is to
recognize our huge bias

2613
01:38:53,250 --> 01:38:56,100
towards attributing
things below the surface

2614
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:59,340
to systems that are able to,

2615
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:01,650
at the surface level, act human.

2616
01:39:01,650 --> 01:39:03,390
- So if that huge bias

2617
01:39:03,390 --> 01:39:06,720
of intentionality is there in
the data and the human data

2618
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:09,870
and the vast landscape of human data

2619
01:39:09,870 --> 01:39:12,180
that AI models, large language models,

2620
01:39:12,180 --> 01:39:15,783
and video models in the
future are trained on,

2621
01:39:17,070 --> 01:39:20,190
don't you think that that
intentionality will emerge

2622
01:39:20,190 --> 01:39:24,720
as fundamental to the behavior
of these systems naturally?

2623
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:26,250
- Well, I don't think it
will happen naturally.

2624
01:39:26,250 --> 01:39:27,750
I think it could happen again.

2625
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:30,630
I'm not against the principle.

2626
01:39:30,630 --> 01:39:35,630
But, again, the way that large
language models came to be

2627
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:40,200
and what they're optimized
for is wildly different

2628
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:41,457
than the way that human beings came to be

2629
01:39:41,457 --> 01:39:43,740
and what they're optimized for.

2630
01:39:43,740 --> 01:39:48,540
So I think we're missing a chance

2631
01:39:48,540 --> 01:39:50,640
to be much more clearheaded

2632
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:53,100
about what large language models are

2633
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:54,840
by judging them against human beings,

2634
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:57,030
again, both in positive
ways and negative ways.

2635
01:39:57,030 --> 01:39:58,650
- Well, I think it sort of to push back

2636
01:39:58,650 --> 01:40:00,990
on what they're optimized
for is different to describe

2637
01:40:00,990 --> 01:40:03,750
how they're trained versus
what they're optimized for.

2638
01:40:03,750 --> 01:40:05,940
So they're trained is very trivial way

2639
01:40:05,940 --> 01:40:07,533
of predicting text tokens,

2640
01:40:08,550 --> 01:40:10,560
but you can describe what
they're optimized for

2641
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:12,930
and what the actual task in hand is,

2642
01:40:12,930 --> 01:40:15,210
is to construct a world model,

2643
01:40:15,210 --> 01:40:17,310
meaning an understanding of the world.

2644
01:40:17,310 --> 01:40:19,770
And that's where it starts getting closer

2645
01:40:19,770 --> 01:40:21,870
to what humans are kind of doing,

2646
01:40:21,870 --> 01:40:24,570
or just in the case of
large language models,

2647
01:40:24,570 --> 01:40:25,770
know how the sausage is made

2648
01:40:25,770 --> 01:40:28,470
and we don't know how
it's made for us humans.

2649
01:40:28,470 --> 01:40:29,760
- But they're not optimized for that.

2650
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:31,230
They're optimized to sound human.

2651
01:40:31,230 --> 01:40:32,790
- That's the fine-tuning.

2652
01:40:32,790 --> 01:40:37,263
But the actual training is
optimized for understanding,

2653
01:40:38,188 --> 01:40:41,760
creating a compressed representation

2654
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:44,520
of all the stuff that humans
have created on the internet.

2655
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:46,770
And the hope is that

2656
01:40:46,770 --> 01:40:50,160
that gives you a deep
understanding of the world.

2657
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:50,993
- Yeah.

2658
01:40:50,993 --> 01:40:52,650
So that's why I think that there's a set

2659
01:40:52,650 --> 01:40:54,060
of interesting questions

2660
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:56,580
to be asked about the ways

2661
01:40:56,580 --> 01:40:58,140
in which large language models

2662
01:40:58,140 --> 01:41:00,780
actually do represent the world

2663
01:41:00,780 --> 01:41:02,490
because what is clear is

2664
01:41:02,490 --> 01:41:05,043
that they're very good at acting human.

2665
01:41:05,940 --> 01:41:08,640
The open question in my mind is,

2666
01:41:08,640 --> 01:41:10,560
is the easiest, most efficient,

2667
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:13,860
best way to act human
to do the same things

2668
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:15,240
that human beings do?

2669
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:16,920
Or are there other ways?

2670
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:18,930
And I think that's an open question.

2671
01:41:18,930 --> 01:41:20,700
I just heard a talk by Melanie Mitchell

2672
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:21,810
at Santa Fe Institute,

2673
01:41:21,810 --> 01:41:24,090
an artificial intelligence researcher.

2674
01:41:24,090 --> 01:41:26,820
And she told two stories
about two different papers.

2675
01:41:26,820 --> 01:41:27,810
One that someone else wrote

2676
01:41:27,810 --> 01:41:29,850
and one that her group is following up on.

2677
01:41:29,850 --> 01:41:31,920
And they were modeling Othello.

2678
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:34,380
Othello the game with a
little rectangular board,

2679
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:35,580
white and black squares.

2680
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:37,620
So the experiment was the following.

2681
01:41:37,620 --> 01:41:40,680
They fed a neural network,

2682
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:45,270
the moves that were being made
in the most symbolic form.

2683
01:41:45,270 --> 01:41:47,190
Like E5 just means that, okay,

2684
01:41:47,190 --> 01:41:48,750
you put a token down E5,

2685
01:41:48,750 --> 01:41:50,100
so it gives a long string.

2686
01:41:50,100 --> 01:41:51,930
It does this for millions of games,

2687
01:41:51,930 --> 01:41:53,700
real legitimate games.

2688
01:41:53,700 --> 01:41:54,960
And then it asks the question,

2689
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:56,160
the paper asks the question,

2690
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:58,380
okay, you you've trained it

2691
01:41:58,380 --> 01:42:01,710
to tell what would be
a legitimate next move

2692
01:42:01,710 --> 01:42:03,543
from not a legitimate next move.

2693
01:42:05,070 --> 01:42:06,900
Did it in its brain

2694
01:42:06,900 --> 01:42:07,943
and it's a little large
language model brain.

2695
01:42:07,943 --> 01:42:09,090
I don't even know

2696
01:42:09,090 --> 01:42:10,380
if it's technically a
large language model,

2697
01:42:10,380 --> 01:42:12,150
but a deep learning network.

2698
01:42:12,150 --> 01:42:15,840
Did it come up with a
representation of the Othello board?

2699
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:16,710
Well, how do you know?

2700
01:42:16,710 --> 01:42:19,410
And so they construct
a little probe network

2701
01:42:19,410 --> 01:42:20,400
that they insert

2702
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:23,200
and ask it what is it doing
right at this moment, right?

2703
01:42:24,939 --> 01:42:28,440
The little probe network can ask,

2704
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:29,580
would this be legitimate

2705
01:42:29,580 --> 01:42:32,640
or is this token white
or black or whatever?

2706
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:36,150
Things that in practice would amount to...

2707
01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:39,060
It's invented the Othello board.

2708
01:42:39,060 --> 01:42:43,140
And it found that the
probe got the right answer,

2709
01:42:43,140 --> 01:42:44,790
not a hundred percent of the time,

2710
01:42:44,790 --> 01:42:46,440
but more than by chance,

2711
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:48,603
substantially more than by chance.

2712
01:42:49,590 --> 01:42:52,560
So they said there's
some tentative evidence

2713
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:56,340
that this neural network has
discovered the Othello board

2714
01:42:56,340 --> 01:42:58,113
just out of data, raw data.

2715
01:42:59,220 --> 01:43:01,470
But then Melanie's group
asked the question,

2716
01:43:01,470 --> 01:43:05,106
okay, are you sure that that understanding

2717
01:43:05,106 --> 01:43:08,583
of the Othello board wasn't
built into your probe?

2718
01:43:10,170 --> 01:43:11,850
And what they found was like at least half

2719
01:43:11,850 --> 01:43:13,980
of the improvement was
built into the probe.

2720
01:43:13,980 --> 01:43:14,883
Not all of it.

2721
01:43:15,990 --> 01:43:20,643
And look, a Othello board is
way simpler than the world.

2722
01:43:24,090 --> 01:43:26,400
I just think it's an open question,

2723
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:28,740
whether or not the...

2724
01:43:28,740 --> 01:43:31,290
I mean, it would be remarkable either way

2725
01:43:31,290 --> 01:43:33,600
to learn that large language models

2726
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:37,350
that are good at doing what
we train them to do are good

2727
01:43:37,350 --> 01:43:39,840
because they've built the same
kind of model of the world

2728
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:41,490
that we have in our minds,

2729
01:43:41,490 --> 01:43:44,820
or that they're good despite
not having that model.

2730
01:43:44,820 --> 01:43:46,470
Either one of these is an amazing thing.

2731
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:49,110
I just don't think the data
are clear on which one is true.

2732
01:43:49,110 --> 01:43:51,030
- I think I have some sort

2733
01:43:51,030 --> 01:43:52,860
of intellectual humility
about the whole thing

2734
01:43:52,860 --> 01:43:55,740
because I was humbled by several stages

2735
01:43:55,740 --> 01:43:58,983
in the machine learning
development over the past 20 years.

2736
01:44:00,690 --> 01:44:03,520
And I was just would never have predicted

2737
01:44:04,380 --> 01:44:08,100
that LLMs the way they're trained

2738
01:44:08,100 --> 01:44:10,710
on the scale of data they're
trained would be as impressive

2739
01:44:10,710 --> 01:44:11,700
as they are.

2740
01:44:11,700 --> 01:44:14,440
And there, that's where
intellectual humility steps in

2741
01:44:15,300 --> 01:44:18,180
where my intuition would say
something like with Melanie,

2742
01:44:18,180 --> 01:44:21,180
where you need to be
able to have very sort

2743
01:44:21,180 --> 01:44:23,280
of concrete common sense reasoning,

2744
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:26,880
symbolic reasoning type things in a system

2745
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:30,180
in order for it to be very intelligent.

2746
01:44:30,180 --> 01:44:34,560
But here, I'm so impressed
by what it's capable to do,

2747
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:37,263
train on the next token
prediction essentially.

2748
01:44:38,970 --> 01:44:42,600
My conception of the nature

2749
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:45,210
of intelligence is just completely,

2750
01:44:45,210 --> 01:44:48,630
not completely but humbled, I should say.

2751
01:44:48,630 --> 01:44:49,980
- Look, and I think that's perfectly fair.

2752
01:44:49,980 --> 01:44:54,120
I also was, I will say pleasantly,

2753
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:55,590
but I don't know whether it's
pleasantly or unpleasantly,

2754
01:44:55,590 --> 01:44:58,830
but factually surprised by
the recent rate of progress.

2755
01:44:58,830 --> 01:44:59,880
Clearly, some kind

2756
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:02,880
of phase transition
percolation has happened

2757
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:04,710
and the improvement has been remarkable.

2758
01:45:04,710 --> 01:45:06,240
Absolutely amazing,

2759
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:09,570
that I have no arguments with.

2760
01:45:09,570 --> 01:45:13,740
That doesn't yet tell me the mechanism

2761
01:45:13,740 --> 01:45:16,350
by which that improvement happened.

2762
01:45:16,350 --> 01:45:17,520
Constructing a model,

2763
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:19,710
much like a human being
would have is clearly

2764
01:45:19,710 --> 01:45:21,090
one possible mechanism,

2765
01:45:21,090 --> 01:45:22,770
but part of the intellectual humility is

2766
01:45:22,770 --> 01:45:24,930
to say maybe there are others.

2767
01:45:24,930 --> 01:45:25,815
- I was chatting with the CEO
of Anthropic, Dario Amodei,

2768
01:45:25,815 --> 01:45:30,815
so behind (indistinct) and that company.

2769
01:45:32,490 --> 01:45:35,760
But a lot of the AI
companies are really focused

2770
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:38,160
on expanding the scale of compute,

2771
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:42,990
sort of if we assume that
AI is not data-limited

2772
01:45:42,990 --> 01:45:44,793
but is compute-limited,

2773
01:45:46,470 --> 01:45:48,360
you can make the system
much more intelligence

2774
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:49,983
by using more compute.

2775
01:45:51,210 --> 01:45:55,920
So let me ask you on almost
on the physics level.

2776
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:59,460
Do you think physics can help
expand the scale of compute

2777
01:45:59,460 --> 01:46:01,290
and maybe the scale of energy required

2778
01:46:01,290 --> 01:46:02,760
to make that compute happen?

2779
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:03,593
- Yeah, a hundred percent.

2780
01:46:03,593 --> 01:46:04,560
I think this is like one

2781
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:08,280
of the biggest things that
physics can help with.

2782
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:11,610
And it's an obvious kind of
low-hanging fruit situation

2783
01:46:11,610 --> 01:46:16,610
where the heat generation,
the inefficiency,

2784
01:46:17,580 --> 01:46:22,580
the waste of existing
high level computers is

2785
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:26,250
nowhere near the efficiency of our brains.

2786
01:46:26,250 --> 01:46:27,810
It's hilariously worse.

2787
01:46:27,810 --> 01:46:29,550
And we kind of haven't tried to optimize

2788
01:46:29,550 --> 01:46:30,900
that hard on that frontier.

2789
01:46:30,900 --> 01:46:32,220
I mean, your laptop heats up

2790
01:46:32,220 --> 01:46:33,810
when you're sitting on your lap, right?

2791
01:46:33,810 --> 01:46:34,643
It doesn't need to.

2792
01:46:34,643 --> 01:46:36,260
Your brain doesn't heat up like that.

2793
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:40,350
So, clearly, there exists
in the world of physics,

2794
01:46:40,350 --> 01:46:43,260
the capability of doing these computations

2795
01:46:43,260 --> 01:46:45,930
with much less waste heat being generated.

2796
01:46:45,930 --> 01:46:48,090
And I look forward to people doing that.

2797
01:46:48,090 --> 01:46:48,923
Yeah.

2798
01:46:48,923 --> 01:46:51,290
- Are you excited for the
possibility of a nuclear fusion?

2799
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:53,820
- I am cautiously optimistic.

2800
01:46:53,820 --> 01:46:55,200
Excited it'll be too strong.

2801
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:56,313
I mean, it'd be great.

2802
01:46:57,270 --> 01:46:59,790
But if we really tried solar power,

2803
01:46:59,790 --> 01:47:01,150
it would also be great.

2804
01:47:01,150 --> 01:47:02,010
(Lex laughs)

2805
01:47:02,010 --> 01:47:04,020
- I think Ilya Sutskever said this,

2806
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:06,780
that the future of humanity

2807
01:47:06,780 --> 01:47:09,750
on earth will be just, the entire surface

2808
01:47:09,750 --> 01:47:12,990
of earth is covered in solar
panels and data centers.

2809
01:47:12,990 --> 01:47:14,160
- Why would you waste the surface of the

2810
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:15,180
earth with solar panels?

2811
01:47:15,180 --> 01:47:16,140
Put them in space.

2812
01:47:16,140 --> 01:47:17,550
- Sure, you can go in space.

2813
01:47:17,550 --> 01:47:18,383
Yeah.

2814
01:47:18,383 --> 01:47:20,070
- Space is bigger than the earth.

2815
01:47:20,070 --> 01:47:20,903
- Yeah.

2816
01:47:20,903 --> 01:47:21,736
Just solar panels everywhere.

2817
01:47:21,736 --> 01:47:22,569
- [Sean] Yeah.

2818
01:47:23,670 --> 01:47:24,503
I like it.

2819
01:47:24,503 --> 01:47:25,830
- We already have fusion.

2820
01:47:25,830 --> 01:47:26,910
It's called the sun.

2821
01:47:26,910 --> 01:47:28,617
- [Lex] Yeah, that's true.

2822
01:47:28,617 --> 01:47:31,380
And there's probably more
and more efficient ways

2823
01:47:31,380 --> 01:47:33,180
of catching that energy.

2824
01:47:33,180 --> 01:47:35,460
- Sending it down is the
hard part, absolutely.

2825
01:47:35,460 --> 01:47:37,350
But that's an engineering problem.

2826
01:47:37,350 --> 01:47:38,183
Yeah.

2827
01:47:38,183 --> 01:47:41,370
- So I just wonder where the data centers,

2828
01:47:41,370 --> 01:47:43,740
the compute centers can expand to.

2829
01:47:43,740 --> 01:47:44,670
If that's the future,

2830
01:47:44,670 --> 01:47:49,200
if AI is as effective
as it possibly could be,

2831
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:53,370
then it's the scale of
computation will keep increasing,

2832
01:47:53,370 --> 01:47:56,790
but perhaps it's a race
between efficiency and scale.

2833
01:47:56,790 --> 01:47:57,750
- There are constraints.

2834
01:47:57,750 --> 01:47:58,583
- [Lex] Yeah.

2835
01:47:58,583 --> 01:47:59,788
- There's a certain amount of energy,

2836
01:47:59,788 --> 01:48:01,410
a certain amount of damage
we can do to the environment

2837
01:48:01,410 --> 01:48:03,390
before it does not worth it anymore.

2838
01:48:03,390 --> 01:48:05,640
So, yeah, I think that's a new question.

2839
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:07,260
In fact, it's kind of frustrating

2840
01:48:07,260 --> 01:48:09,540
because we get better and better

2841
01:48:09,540 --> 01:48:11,190
at doing things efficiently,

2842
01:48:11,190 --> 01:48:13,683
but we invent more
things we wanna do faster

2843
01:48:13,683 --> 01:48:16,200
than we get good at
doing them efficiently.

2844
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:19,830
So we're continuing to make
things worse in various ways.

2845
01:48:19,830 --> 01:48:21,858
- I mean, that's the dance of humanity.

2846
01:48:21,858 --> 01:48:24,047
We're constantly creating better, better,

2847
01:48:24,047 --> 01:48:26,370
better technologies that
are potentially causing

2848
01:48:26,370 --> 01:48:27,930
a lot more harm.

2849
01:48:27,930 --> 01:48:29,310
And that includes for weapons.

2850
01:48:29,310 --> 01:48:31,110
It includes AI used as weapons.

2851
01:48:31,110 --> 01:48:33,090
That includes nuclear weapons, of course.

2852
01:48:33,090 --> 01:48:35,010
Which is surprising to me

2853
01:48:35,010 --> 01:48:38,610
that we haven't destroyed
human civilization yet

2854
01:48:38,610 --> 01:48:41,550
given how many nuclear
warheads are out there.

2855
01:48:41,550 --> 01:48:42,510
- Look, I'm with you.

2856
01:48:42,510 --> 01:48:45,990
Between nuclear and bio weapons,

2857
01:48:45,990 --> 01:48:47,250
it is a little bit surprising

2858
01:48:47,250 --> 01:48:49,440
that we haven't caused
enormous devastation.

2859
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:51,690
Of course, we did drop
two atomic bombs on Japan,

2860
01:48:51,690 --> 01:48:53,490
but compared to what could have happened

2861
01:48:53,490 --> 01:48:55,083
or could happen tomorrow,

2862
01:48:56,250 --> 01:48:57,270
it could be much worse.

2863
01:48:57,270 --> 01:48:58,103
- Yeah.

2864
01:48:58,103 --> 01:49:00,030
It does seem like there's a underlying,

2865
01:49:00,030 --> 01:49:01,980
speaking of quantum fields,

2866
01:49:01,980 --> 01:49:04,470
there's like a field

2867
01:49:04,470 --> 01:49:08,310
of goodness within the human heart

2868
01:49:08,310 --> 01:49:11,310
that like in some kind
of game theoretic way,

2869
01:49:11,310 --> 01:49:12,870
we create really powerful things

2870
01:49:12,870 --> 01:49:13,980
that could destroy each other.

2871
01:49:13,980 --> 01:49:15,240
And there's greed and ego

2872
01:49:15,240 --> 01:49:18,510
and all this kind power hungry dictators

2873
01:49:18,510 --> 01:49:22,440
that are at play here in all
the geopolitical landscape,

2874
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:25,620
but we somehow always,
like, don't go too far.

2875
01:49:25,620 --> 01:49:26,453
- Yeah.

2876
01:49:26,453 --> 01:49:27,286
But that's exactly what
you would say right

2877
01:49:27,286 --> 01:49:28,119
before we went too far.

2878
01:49:28,119 --> 01:49:30,150
- Right before we went too far.

2879
01:49:30,150 --> 01:49:32,193
And that's why we don't see aliens.

2880
01:49:33,570 --> 01:49:35,220
So you're, like I mentioned,

2881
01:49:35,220 --> 01:49:36,960
associated with Santa Fe Institute.

2882
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:41,960
I just would love to take
a stroll down the landscape

2883
01:49:41,970 --> 01:49:44,190
of ideas explored there.

2884
01:49:44,190 --> 01:49:47,370
So they look at complexity
in all kinds of ways.

2885
01:49:47,370 --> 01:49:48,960
What do you think about the emergence

2886
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:52,740
of complexity from simple
things interacting simply?

2887
01:49:52,740 --> 01:49:54,270
- I think it's a fascinating topic.

2888
01:49:54,270 --> 01:49:55,410
I mean, that's why I'm thinking

2889
01:49:55,410 --> 01:49:57,690
about these things these
days rather than the papers

2890
01:49:57,690 --> 01:49:59,490
that I was describing to you before.

2891
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:04,380
All of those papers I described
to you before are guesses.

2892
01:50:04,380 --> 01:50:05,520
What if the laws of physics are different

2893
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:06,360
in the following way

2894
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:08,190
and then you can work
out the consequences?

2895
01:50:08,190 --> 01:50:09,450
At some point in my life,

2896
01:50:09,450 --> 01:50:11,490
I said like, what is the
chance I'm gonna guess right?

2897
01:50:11,490 --> 01:50:12,390
Einstein guessed right.

2898
01:50:12,390 --> 01:50:13,500
Steven Weinberg guessed right.

2899
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:15,210
But there's a very small number

2900
01:50:15,210 --> 01:50:17,400
of times that people guess right.

2901
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:21,240
Whereas with this emergence
of complexity from simplicity,

2902
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:22,380
I really do think

2903
01:50:22,380 --> 01:50:25,650
that we haven't understood the basics yet.

2904
01:50:25,650 --> 01:50:27,450
I think we're still kind of paradigmatic.

2905
01:50:27,450 --> 01:50:31,980
There've been some
spectacular discoveries.

2906
01:50:31,980 --> 01:50:33,750
People like Geoffrey West at Santa Fe

2907
01:50:33,750 --> 01:50:37,050
and others have really
given us true insights

2908
01:50:37,050 --> 01:50:38,280
into important systems.

2909
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:39,810
But still there's a lot
of the basics, I think,

2910
01:50:39,810 --> 01:50:40,920
are not understood.

2911
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:42,870
And so searching

2912
01:50:42,870 --> 01:50:45,177
for the general principles
is what I like to do.

2913
01:50:45,177 --> 01:50:47,610
And I think it's
absolutely possible that...

2914
01:50:47,610 --> 01:50:50,490
I mean, to be a little bit
more substantive than that.

2915
01:50:50,490 --> 01:50:52,320
I think this is kind of a cliché.

2916
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:55,350
I think the key is information.

2917
01:50:55,350 --> 01:50:57,870
And I think that what we
see through the history

2918
01:50:57,870 --> 01:51:00,690
of the universe as you go from simple

2919
01:51:00,690 --> 01:51:03,690
to more and more complex
is really subsystems

2920
01:51:03,690 --> 01:51:07,350
of the universe figuring
out how to use information

2921
01:51:07,350 --> 01:51:10,470
to do whatever to survive or
to thrive or to reproduce.

2922
01:51:10,470 --> 01:51:13,350
I mean, that's the sort
of fuel, the leverage,

2923
01:51:13,350 --> 01:51:15,660
the resource that we have

2924
01:51:15,660 --> 01:51:17,430
for a while anyway until the heat death.

2925
01:51:17,430 --> 01:51:20,397
But that's where the
complexity is really driven by.

2926
01:51:20,397 --> 01:51:22,230
- But the mechanism of it.

2927
01:51:22,230 --> 01:51:23,520
I mean, you mentioned Geoffrey West.

2928
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:27,030
What are interesting inklings
of progress in this realm?

2929
01:51:27,030 --> 01:51:29,340
And what are systems that interest you

2930
01:51:29,340 --> 01:51:30,330
in terms of information?

2931
01:51:30,330 --> 01:51:31,290
So, I mean, for me,

2932
01:51:31,290 --> 01:51:34,440
just as a fan of complexity,

2933
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:37,170
just even looking at simple
cellular automata is always

2934
01:51:37,170 --> 01:51:41,640
just fascinating way to
illustrate the emergence

2935
01:51:41,640 --> 01:51:42,600
of complexity.

2936
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:45,870
- So for those of the listeners
who don't know, viewers,

2937
01:51:45,870 --> 01:51:47,880
cellular automata come

2938
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:51,510
from imagining a very
simple configuration,

2939
01:51:51,510 --> 01:51:55,290
for example, a set of ones
and zeros along a line.

2940
01:51:55,290 --> 01:51:57,210
And then you met a rule that says, okay,

2941
01:51:57,210 --> 01:51:59,820
I'm gonna evolve this in time.

2942
01:51:59,820 --> 01:52:01,590
And generally, the simplest ones start

2943
01:52:01,590 --> 01:52:06,590
with just each block of three
ones and zeros have a rule

2944
01:52:06,660 --> 01:52:09,180
that they will determine
go to either one or a zero.

2945
01:52:09,180 --> 01:52:10,710
And you can actually classify

2946
01:52:10,710 --> 01:52:11,670
all the different possibilities,

2947
01:52:11,670 --> 01:52:15,330
a small number of possible
cellular automata of that form.

2948
01:52:15,330 --> 01:52:18,150
And what was discovered by various people,

2949
01:52:18,150 --> 01:52:19,320
including Stephen Wolfram,

2950
01:52:19,320 --> 01:52:22,470
is some of these cellular
automata have the feature

2951
01:52:22,470 --> 01:52:24,150
that you start from almost nothing,

2952
01:52:24,150 --> 01:52:29,150
like 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0,
0, 0 and you let it rip,

2953
01:52:29,580 --> 01:52:31,860
and it becomes wildly complex.

2954
01:52:31,860 --> 01:52:32,693
Okay?

2955
01:52:32,693 --> 01:52:35,520
So this is very provocative,
very interesting.

2956
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:38,610
It's also not how physics works at all

2957
01:52:38,610 --> 01:52:40,500
because, as we said,

2958
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:43,110
physics conserves information.

2959
01:52:43,110 --> 01:52:44,550
You can go forward or backwards.

2960
01:52:44,550 --> 01:52:46,530
The cellular automata do not.

2961
01:52:46,530 --> 01:52:48,900
They're not reversible in any sense.

2962
01:52:48,900 --> 01:52:50,700
You've built in an arrow of time.

2963
01:52:50,700 --> 01:52:53,880
You have a starting point
and then you evolve.

2964
01:52:53,880 --> 01:52:55,740
So what I'm interested in is seeing

2965
01:52:55,740 --> 01:52:58,200
how in the real world with
the real laws of physics

2966
01:52:58,200 --> 01:53:00,210
and underlying reversibility,

2967
01:53:00,210 --> 01:53:03,390
but macroscopic
irreversibility from entropy

2968
01:53:03,390 --> 01:53:04,650
in the arrow time, et cetera,

2969
01:53:04,650 --> 01:53:07,020
how does that lead to complexity?

2970
01:53:07,020 --> 01:53:08,790
I think that that's an
answerable question.

2971
01:53:08,790 --> 01:53:10,680
I don't think that cellular
automata are really helping us

2972
01:53:10,680 --> 01:53:11,513
in that one.

2973
01:53:14,336 --> 01:53:16,440
- What is the landscape of entropy

2974
01:53:16,440 --> 01:53:18,780
in the universe look like?

2975
01:53:18,780 --> 01:53:21,270
- Well, entropy is hard to localize.

2976
01:53:21,270 --> 01:53:22,380
It's a property of systems,

2977
01:53:22,380 --> 01:53:24,393
not of parts of systems.

2978
01:53:26,185 --> 01:53:27,450
Having said that,

2979
01:53:27,450 --> 01:53:29,700
we can do approximate
answers to the question.

2980
01:53:29,700 --> 01:53:32,430
The answer is black holes
are huge in entropy.

2981
01:53:32,430 --> 01:53:34,083
Let's put it this way.

2982
01:53:35,250 --> 01:53:37,590
The whole observable universe

2983
01:53:37,590 --> 01:53:41,130
that we are in had a
certain amount of entropy

2984
01:53:41,130 --> 01:53:46,051
before stars and planets and
black holes started to form.

2985
01:53:46,051 --> 01:53:47,370
10 to the 88th,

2986
01:53:47,370 --> 01:53:48,570
I can even tell you the number.

2987
01:53:48,570 --> 01:53:49,560
Okay?

2988
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:50,700
The single black hole,

2989
01:53:50,700 --> 01:53:53,040
the center of our galaxy has entropy.

2990
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:53,943
10 to the 90.

2991
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:55,793
Single black hole center

2992
01:53:55,793 --> 01:53:56,850
of our galaxy is more entropy

2993
01:53:56,850 --> 01:54:00,660
than the whole universe used
to have not too long ago.

2994
01:54:00,660 --> 01:54:02,940
So most of the entropy
in the universe today is

2995
01:54:02,940 --> 01:54:04,320
in the form of black holes.

2996
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:05,153
- Okay.

2997
01:54:05,153 --> 01:54:06,243
That's fascinating, first of all.

2998
01:54:07,230 --> 01:54:08,063
But second of all,

2999
01:54:08,063 --> 01:54:10,380
if we take black holes away,

3000
01:54:10,380 --> 01:54:12,570
what are the different
interesting perturbations

3001
01:54:12,570 --> 01:54:15,063
in entropy across space?

3002
01:54:15,930 --> 01:54:18,540
Where do we earth links fit into that?

3003
01:54:18,540 --> 01:54:22,080
- The interesting thing
to me is that if you start

3004
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:25,080
with a system that is isolated

3005
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:26,670
from the rest of the universe

3006
01:54:26,670 --> 01:54:29,580
and you start it at low entropy,

3007
01:54:29,580 --> 01:54:31,230
there's almost a theorem

3008
01:54:31,230 --> 01:54:33,873
that says if you're very,
very, very low entropy,

3009
01:54:33,873 --> 01:54:36,390
then the system looks pretty simple

3010
01:54:36,390 --> 01:54:37,980
'cause there's low entropy means

3011
01:54:37,980 --> 01:54:38,970
there's only a small number

3012
01:54:38,970 --> 01:54:42,660
of ways that you can rearrange
the parts to look like that.

3013
01:54:42,660 --> 01:54:44,100
So there's if there's not that many ways,

3014
01:54:44,100 --> 01:54:46,050
the answer's gonna look simple.

3015
01:54:46,050 --> 01:54:47,550
But there's also almost a theorem

3016
01:54:47,550 --> 01:54:50,100
that says when you're at maximum entropy,

3017
01:54:50,100 --> 01:54:51,450
the system is gonna look simple

3018
01:54:51,450 --> 01:54:52,470
because it's all smeared out.

3019
01:54:52,470 --> 01:54:54,480
If it had like interesting structure,

3020
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:56,700
then it would be complicated.

3021
01:54:56,700 --> 01:55:00,210
So entropy in this isolated
system only goes up.

3022
01:55:00,210 --> 01:55:02,220
That's the second law of thermodynamics.

3023
01:55:02,220 --> 01:55:06,090
But complexity starts low, goes up,

3024
01:55:06,090 --> 01:55:07,503
and then goes down again.

3025
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:13,290
Sometimes people mistakenly
think that complexity or life

3026
01:55:13,290 --> 01:55:16,620
or whatever is fighting
against the second law

3027
01:55:16,620 --> 01:55:17,490
of thermodynamics,

3028
01:55:17,490 --> 01:55:19,350
fighting against the increase of entropy.

3029
01:55:19,350 --> 01:55:21,840
That is precisely the wrong
way to think about it.

3030
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:26,840
We are surfers riding the
wave of increasing entropy.

3031
01:55:26,850 --> 01:55:30,270
We rely on increasing entropy to survive.

3032
01:55:30,270 --> 01:55:32,100
That is part of what makes us special.

3033
01:55:32,100 --> 01:55:37,100
This table maintains its
stability mechanically,

3034
01:55:37,110 --> 01:55:38,850
which, I mean, there's molecules,

3035
01:55:38,850 --> 01:55:41,400
there have forces on each other,

3036
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:42,720
and it holds up.

3037
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:44,370
You and I aren't like that.

3038
01:55:44,370 --> 01:55:48,060
We maintain our stability dynamically

3039
01:55:48,060 --> 01:55:51,120
by ingesting food, fuel,

3040
01:55:51,120 --> 01:55:53,430
food, and water, and air and so forth,

3041
01:55:53,430 --> 01:55:55,980
burning it, increasing its entropy.

3042
01:55:55,980 --> 01:56:00,000
We are non-equilibrium
quasi study state systems.

3043
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,790
We are using the fuel the
universe gives us in the form

3044
01:56:02,790 --> 01:56:06,420
of low entropy energy to
maintain our stability.

3045
01:56:06,420 --> 01:56:09,483
- I just wonder what that
mechanism of surfing looks like.

3046
01:56:11,970 --> 01:56:12,803
First of all,

3047
01:56:12,803 --> 01:56:13,950
I mean, one question to ask,

3048
01:56:13,950 --> 01:56:16,230
do you think it's possible
to have a kind of size

3049
01:56:16,230 --> 01:56:21,230
of complexity where you
have very precise ways

3050
01:56:21,480 --> 01:56:24,543
or clearly defined ways
of measuring complexity?

3051
01:56:25,620 --> 01:56:26,453
- I think it is

3052
01:56:26,453 --> 01:56:28,020
and I think we don't.

3053
01:56:28,020 --> 01:56:28,920
It's possible to have it.

3054
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:30,320
I don't think we yet have it

3055
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:34,500
in part because complexity
is not a univalent thing.

3056
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:35,820
There's different ideas

3057
01:56:35,820 --> 01:56:38,250
that go under the rubric of complexity.

3058
01:56:38,250 --> 01:56:41,820
One version is just Kolmogorov complexity.

3059
01:56:41,820 --> 01:56:43,260
If you have a configuration

3060
01:56:43,260 --> 01:56:45,420
or a string of numbers or whatever,

3061
01:56:45,420 --> 01:56:47,370
can you compress it

3062
01:56:47,370 --> 01:56:50,460
so that you have a small
program that will output that?

3063
01:56:50,460 --> 01:56:52,200
That's Kolmogorov complexity.

3064
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:55,440
But that's the complexity
of a string of numbers.

3065
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:56,310
Okay?

3066
01:56:56,310 --> 01:56:59,220
It's not like the complexity of a problem.

3067
01:56:59,220 --> 01:57:00,720
Computational complexity,

3068
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:02,310
the traveling salesman problem

3069
01:57:02,310 --> 01:57:03,690
or factoring large numbers.

3070
01:57:03,690 --> 01:57:05,820
That's a whole different kind of question

3071
01:57:05,820 --> 01:57:07,200
that is also about complexity.

3072
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:09,960
So we don't have a sort
of unified view of it.

3073
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:12,450
- So you think it's possible
to have a complexity

3074
01:57:12,450 --> 01:57:13,920
of a physical system-

3075
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:14,753
- Yeah, absolutely.
- In the same way

3076
01:57:14,753 --> 01:57:15,990
we do entropy.

3077
01:57:15,990 --> 01:57:17,370
- Yeah.

3078
01:57:17,370 --> 01:57:20,100
- You think that's a Sean
Carroll paper or what?

3079
01:57:20,100 --> 01:57:21,981
- We are working on various things.

3080
01:57:21,981 --> 01:57:25,560
The glib thing that I'm
trying to work on right now

3081
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:28,740
with a student is complex agenesis.

3082
01:57:28,740 --> 01:57:29,940
How does complexity come

3083
01:57:29,940 --> 01:57:31,683
to be if all the universes doing is moving

3084
01:57:31,683 --> 01:57:33,240
from low entropy to high entropy?

3085
01:57:33,240 --> 01:57:34,650
- It's sexy name.

3086
01:57:34,650 --> 01:57:35,483
- It's a good name.

3087
01:57:35,483 --> 01:57:36,316
Yeah, I like the name.

3088
01:57:36,316 --> 01:57:37,600
I just gotta write the paper.

3089
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:41,343
- Sometimes a name
arose by any other name.

3090
01:57:42,747 --> 01:57:46,686
In which context the birth

3091
01:57:46,686 --> 01:57:49,920
of complexity are you most interested in?

3092
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:52,260
- Well, I think it comes in stages.

3093
01:57:52,260 --> 01:57:54,540
So I think that if you go from the...

3094
01:57:54,540 --> 01:57:56,790
I'm, again, a physicist.

3095
01:57:56,790 --> 01:58:00,060
So biologists studying evolution will talk

3096
01:58:00,060 --> 01:58:02,310
about how complexity evolves all the time,

3097
01:58:02,310 --> 01:58:03,420
the complexity of the genome,

3098
01:58:03,420 --> 01:58:05,910
the complexity of our physiology.

3099
01:58:05,910 --> 01:58:09,930
But they take for granted
that life already existed

3100
01:58:09,930 --> 01:58:12,600
and entropy is increasing and so forth.

3101
01:58:12,600 --> 01:58:14,580
I wanna go back to the beginning

3102
01:58:14,580 --> 01:58:17,280
and say the early universe
was simple and low entropy

3103
01:58:17,280 --> 01:58:19,110
and entropy increases with time.

3104
01:58:19,110 --> 01:58:20,760
And the universe sort of differentiates

3105
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:22,740
and becomes more complex.

3106
01:58:22,740 --> 01:58:24,840
But that statement,

3107
01:58:24,840 --> 01:58:27,030
which is indisputably true,

3108
01:58:27,030 --> 01:58:28,290
has different meanings.

3109
01:58:28,290 --> 01:58:30,030
'cause complexity has different meanings.

3110
01:58:30,030 --> 01:58:34,500
So sort of the most basic primal version

3111
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:36,420
of complexity is what you might think of

3112
01:58:36,420 --> 01:58:38,550
as configurational complexity.

3113
01:58:38,550 --> 01:58:40,110
That's what Kolmogorov gets at.

3114
01:58:40,110 --> 01:58:41,640
How much information do you need

3115
01:58:41,640 --> 01:58:44,550
to specify the
configuration of the system?

3116
01:58:44,550 --> 01:58:48,630
Then there's a whole another
step where subsystems

3117
01:58:48,630 --> 01:58:52,020
of the universe start burning fuel.

3118
01:58:52,020 --> 01:58:53,430
So in many ways,

3119
01:58:53,430 --> 01:58:55,830
a planet and a star are not

3120
01:58:55,830 --> 01:58:57,990
that different in
configurational complexity.

3121
01:58:57,990 --> 01:59:00,000
They're both spheres with density,

3122
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,820
high at the middle and
getting less as you go out.

3123
01:59:02,820 --> 01:59:04,290
But there's something
fundamentally different

3124
01:59:04,290 --> 01:59:06,000
because the star only survives

3125
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:07,500
as long as it has fuel.

3126
01:59:07,500 --> 01:59:08,730
I mean, then it turns into a brown dwarf

3127
01:59:08,730 --> 01:59:09,660
for a white dwarf for whatever.

3128
01:59:09,660 --> 01:59:13,050
But as a star, as a main sequence star,

3129
01:59:13,050 --> 01:59:15,780
it is an out of equilibrium system,

3130
01:59:15,780 --> 01:59:17,460
but it's more or less static.

3131
01:59:17,460 --> 01:59:19,680
Like if I spill the coffee mug

3132
01:59:19,680 --> 01:59:21,480
and it falls in the process of falling,

3133
01:59:21,480 --> 01:59:22,440
it's out of equilibrium,

3134
01:59:22,440 --> 01:59:24,540
but it's also changing all the time.

3135
01:59:24,540 --> 01:59:29,280
A specific kind of system
is where it's looks sort

3136
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:32,730
of macroscopically
stationary, like a star,

3137
01:59:32,730 --> 01:59:34,320
but underneath the hood,

3138
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:35,730
it's burning fuel to beat the band

3139
01:59:35,730 --> 01:59:38,520
in order to maintain that stability.

3140
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:40,410
So as stars form that,

3141
01:59:40,410 --> 01:59:43,680
that's a different kind of
complexity that comes to be.

3142
01:59:43,680 --> 01:59:46,320
Then there's another kind of
complexity that comes to be

3143
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:49,110
roughly speaking at the origin of life

3144
01:59:49,110 --> 01:59:52,110
because that's where you have information

3145
01:59:52,110 --> 01:59:54,210
really being gathered and utilized

3146
01:59:54,210 --> 01:59:56,760
by subsystems of the universe.

3147
01:59:56,760 --> 01:59:57,660
And then, arguably,

3148
01:59:57,660 --> 01:59:59,893
there's any number of stages past that.

3149
01:59:59,893 --> 02:00:01,860
I mean, one of the most obvious ones

3150
02:00:01,860 --> 02:00:05,190
to me is we talk about simulation theory,

3151
02:00:05,190 --> 02:00:07,230
but you and I run
simulations in our heads.

3152
02:00:07,230 --> 02:00:09,030
They're just not that good.

3153
02:00:09,030 --> 02:00:12,150
But we imagine different
hypothetical futures.

3154
02:00:12,150 --> 02:00:13,950
Bacteria don't do that.

3155
02:00:13,950 --> 02:00:15,840
So that's the kind of
information processing

3156
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:16,947
that is a form of complexity.

3157
02:00:16,947 --> 02:00:19,140
And so I would like to
understand all these stages

3158
02:00:19,140 --> 02:00:20,460
and how they fit together.

3159
02:00:20,460 --> 02:00:21,870
- Yeah, imagination.

3160
02:00:21,870 --> 02:00:22,703
- Yep.

3161
02:00:22,703 --> 02:00:24,180
Mental time travel.

3162
02:00:24,180 --> 02:00:25,013
- Yeah.

3163
02:00:25,013 --> 02:00:26,460
The things going on in my head

3164
02:00:26,460 --> 02:00:29,940
when I'm imagining worlds
are super compressed

3165
02:00:29,940 --> 02:00:31,410
representations of those worlds.

3166
02:00:31,410 --> 02:00:33,270
But to get to the essence of them,

3167
02:00:33,270 --> 02:00:34,290
and maybe it's possible

3168
02:00:34,290 --> 02:00:38,220
with non-human computing type devices

3169
02:00:38,220 --> 02:00:39,720
to do those kinds of simulations

3170
02:00:39,720 --> 02:00:41,400
in more and more compressed ways.

3171
02:00:41,400 --> 02:00:43,620
- There's an argument to be made

3172
02:00:43,620 --> 02:00:45,600
that literally what separates human beings

3173
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:48,210
from other species on earth is

3174
02:00:48,210 --> 02:00:50,820
our ability to imagine counterfactual,

3175
02:00:50,820 --> 02:00:52,053
hypothetical features.

3176
02:00:55,620 --> 02:00:56,460
- Yeah.

3177
02:00:56,460 --> 02:00:58,920
I mean, that's one of the big features.

3178
02:00:58,920 --> 02:00:59,753
I don't know if-

3179
02:00:59,753 --> 02:01:01,224
- Everyone has their own
favorite little feature.

3180
02:01:01,224 --> 02:01:03,330
That's why I said there's
an argument to be made.

3181
02:01:03,330 --> 02:01:06,570
I did a podcast episode
on it with Adam Bulley.

3182
02:01:06,570 --> 02:01:07,620
It developed slowly.

3183
02:01:07,620 --> 02:01:08,940
I did different podcast.

3184
02:01:08,940 --> 02:01:10,770
Sorry to keep mentioning
podcast episodes I did.

3185
02:01:10,770 --> 02:01:11,790
But Malcolm Mciver,

3186
02:01:11,790 --> 02:01:13,920
who is an engineer at Northwestern,

3187
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:16,860
has a theory about one of the major stages

3188
02:01:16,860 --> 02:01:20,610
in evolution is when fish
first climbed on the land.

3189
02:01:20,610 --> 02:01:21,443
I mean, of course,

3190
02:01:21,443 --> 02:01:22,530
that is a major stage in evolution,

3191
02:01:22,530 --> 02:01:23,363
but in particular,

3192
02:01:23,363 --> 02:01:25,320
there's a cognitive shift.

3193
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:29,310
Because when you're a fish
swimming under the water,

3194
02:01:29,310 --> 02:01:33,570
the attenuation length of light
in water is not that long.

3195
02:01:33,570 --> 02:01:35,220
You can't see kilometers away.

3196
02:01:35,220 --> 02:01:37,050
You can see meters away,

3197
02:01:37,050 --> 02:01:39,600
and you're moving at meters per second.

3198
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:43,650
So all of the evolutionary
optimization is make all

3199
02:01:43,650 --> 02:01:46,380
of your decisions on a
timescale of less than a second.

3200
02:01:46,380 --> 02:01:47,880
When you see something new,

3201
02:01:47,880 --> 02:01:51,000
you have to make a rapid fire
decision what to do about it.

3202
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,070
As soon as you climb onto land,

3203
02:01:53,070 --> 02:01:55,140
you can essentially see forever.

3204
02:01:55,140 --> 02:01:57,213
You can see stars in the sky.

3205
02:01:58,260 --> 02:02:02,250
So now a whole new mode
of reasoning opens up

3206
02:02:02,250 --> 02:02:03,960
where you see something far away.

3207
02:02:03,960 --> 02:02:05,400
And rather than saying,

3208
02:02:05,400 --> 02:02:07,799
lookup table, I see this, I react.

3209
02:02:07,799 --> 02:02:08,940
You can say, okay,

3210
02:02:08,940 --> 02:02:10,380
I see that thing.

3211
02:02:10,380 --> 02:02:11,490
What if I did this?

3212
02:02:11,490 --> 02:02:12,450
What if I did that?

3213
02:02:12,450 --> 02:02:13,740
What if I did something different?

3214
02:02:13,740 --> 02:02:17,100
And that's the birth of
imagination, eventually

3215
02:02:17,100 --> 02:02:19,173
- You've been critical on panpsychism.

3216
02:02:20,460 --> 02:02:22,230
- [Sean] Yes, you've noticed that, right.

3217
02:02:22,230 --> 02:02:25,293
- Can you make the case for
panpsychism and against it?

3218
02:02:26,157 --> 02:02:27,450
So panpsychism is the idea

3219
02:02:27,450 --> 02:02:30,000
that consciousness permeates all matter.

3220
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:34,800
Maybe it's the fundamental force

3221
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:39,800
or a physics of the way of
the fabric of the universe.

3222
02:02:39,810 --> 02:02:42,360
- And psychism taught everywhere,

3223
02:02:42,360 --> 02:02:43,960
consciousness everywhere, right?

3224
02:02:45,039 --> 02:02:47,430
- to a point of entertainment,

3225
02:02:47,430 --> 02:02:48,693
the idea frustrates you,

3226
02:02:49,710 --> 02:02:52,170
which sort of as a fan
is wonderful to watch.

3227
02:02:52,170 --> 02:02:56,460
And you've had great
episodes with panpsychism

3228
02:02:56,460 --> 02:02:58,663
That's right on your
podcast where you go at it.

3229
02:02:58,663 --> 02:02:59,820
- I had David Chalmers,

3230
02:02:59,820 --> 02:03:01,470
who's one of the world's
great philosophers.

3231
02:03:01,470 --> 02:03:05,253
And he is panpsychism curious.

3232
02:03:06,300 --> 02:03:07,650
He doesn't commit to anything,

3233
02:03:07,650 --> 02:03:09,570
but he's certainly
willing to entertain it.

3234
02:03:09,570 --> 02:03:11,490
Philip Goff, who I've had,

3235
02:03:11,490 --> 02:03:12,720
who's a great guy,

3236
02:03:12,720 --> 02:03:14,360
but he's devoted to panpsych.

3237
02:03:14,360 --> 02:03:17,970
In fact, he's almost
single handedly responsible

3238
02:03:17,970 --> 02:03:20,450
for the upsurge of interest in panpsychism

3239
02:03:20,450 --> 02:03:22,830
in the popular imagination.

3240
02:03:22,830 --> 02:03:25,560
And the argument for it is supposed to be

3241
02:03:25,560 --> 02:03:29,160
that there is something
fundamentally uncapturable

3242
02:03:29,160 --> 02:03:32,850
about conscious awareness
by physical behavior

3243
02:03:32,850 --> 02:03:34,410
of atoms and molecules.

3244
02:03:34,410 --> 02:03:35,850
So the panpsychism will say, look,

3245
02:03:35,850 --> 02:03:39,000
you can tell me maybe
someday through advances

3246
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,310
of neuroscience and what have you,

3247
02:03:41,310 --> 02:03:43,980
exactly what happens in your brain

3248
02:03:43,980 --> 02:03:45,540
and how that translates

3249
02:03:45,540 --> 02:03:49,200
into thought, and speech, and action.

3250
02:03:49,200 --> 02:03:54,060
What you can't tell me is
what it is like to be me.

3251
02:03:54,060 --> 02:03:57,420
You can't tell me what I am experiencing

3252
02:03:57,420 --> 02:03:59,880
when I see something that is red

3253
02:03:59,880 --> 02:04:02,250
or that taste something that is sweet.

3254
02:04:02,250 --> 02:04:04,350
You can tell me what neurons fire,

3255
02:04:04,350 --> 02:04:06,240
but you can't tell me
what I'm experiencing.

3256
02:04:06,240 --> 02:04:07,440
That first person,

3257
02:04:07,440 --> 02:04:12,090
inner subjective experience
is simply not capturable

3258
02:04:12,090 --> 02:04:13,383
by physics.

3259
02:04:14,760 --> 02:04:17,940
And therefore, this is an
old argument, of course,

3260
02:04:17,940 --> 02:04:21,360
but then therefore is supposed
to be I need something

3261
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:23,520
that is not contained within physics

3262
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:25,080
to account for that.

3263
02:04:25,080 --> 02:04:27,330
And I'm just gonna call it mind.

3264
02:04:27,330 --> 02:04:28,410
We don't know what it is yet.

3265
02:04:28,410 --> 02:04:29,700
We're gonna call it mind.

3266
02:04:29,700 --> 02:04:31,950
And it has to be separate from physics.

3267
02:04:31,950 --> 02:04:33,270
And then there's two ways to go.

3268
02:04:33,270 --> 02:04:35,670
If you buy that much,

3269
02:04:35,670 --> 02:04:38,460
you can either say, okay,
I'm gonna a dualist,

3270
02:04:38,460 --> 02:04:40,410
I'm gonna believe that
there's matter and mind

3271
02:04:40,410 --> 02:04:41,790
and they're separate from each other

3272
02:04:41,790 --> 02:04:44,250
and they're interacting somehow.

3273
02:04:44,250 --> 02:04:46,740
Or that's a little bit complicated

3274
02:04:46,740 --> 02:04:48,720
and sketchy as far as physics is gonna go.

3275
02:04:48,720 --> 02:04:49,830
So I'm gonna believe in mind,

3276
02:04:49,830 --> 02:04:52,440
but I'm gonna put it prior to matter.

3277
02:04:52,440 --> 02:04:55,080
I'm gonna believe that mind comes first

3278
02:04:55,080 --> 02:04:58,260
and that consciousness is the
fundamental aspect of reality

3279
02:04:58,260 --> 02:04:59,310
and everything else,

3280
02:04:59,310 --> 02:05:02,730
including matter and
physics comes from it.

3281
02:05:02,730 --> 02:05:06,543
That would be at least as
simple as physics comes first.

3282
02:05:07,650 --> 02:05:12,030
Now, the physicalist,
such as myself will say,

3283
02:05:12,030 --> 02:05:15,930
I don't have any problem
explaining what it's like to be you

3284
02:05:15,930 --> 02:05:18,120
or what you experience when you see red.

3285
02:05:18,120 --> 02:05:22,020
It's a certain way of
talking about the atoms

3286
02:05:22,020 --> 02:05:23,460
and the neurons, et cetera,

3287
02:05:23,460 --> 02:05:25,020
that make up you.

3288
02:05:25,020 --> 02:05:29,280
Just like the hardness or
the brownness of this table,

3289
02:05:29,280 --> 02:05:31,620
these are words that we attach

3290
02:05:31,620 --> 02:05:33,570
to certain underlying configurations

3291
02:05:33,570 --> 02:05:35,520
of ordinary physical matter.

3292
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:38,070
Likewise, sadness and redness

3293
02:05:38,070 --> 02:05:40,770
or whatever are words
that we attach to you

3294
02:05:40,770 --> 02:05:43,050
to describe what you're doing.

3295
02:05:43,050 --> 02:05:46,860
And when it comes to
consciousness in general,

3296
02:05:46,860 --> 02:05:48,120
I'm very quick to say,

3297
02:05:48,120 --> 02:05:52,620
I do not claim to have any special insight

3298
02:05:52,620 --> 02:05:56,010
on how consciousness works
other than I see no reason

3299
02:05:56,010 --> 02:05:58,440
to change the laws of
physics to account for it.

3300
02:05:58,440 --> 02:05:59,940
- If you don't have to
change the laws of physics,

3301
02:05:59,940 --> 02:06:01,830
where do you think it emerges from?

3302
02:06:01,830 --> 02:06:05,010
Is consciousness an illusion

3303
02:06:05,010 --> 02:06:06,930
that's almost like a
shorthand that we humans used

3304
02:06:06,930 --> 02:06:08,040
to describe a certain kind

3305
02:06:08,040 --> 02:06:11,220
of feeling we have when
interacting with the world?

3306
02:06:11,220 --> 02:06:13,530
Or is there some big leap

3307
02:06:13,530 --> 02:06:15,960
that happens at some stage?

3308
02:06:15,960 --> 02:06:17,580
- I almost never use the word illusion.

3309
02:06:17,580 --> 02:06:19,590
Illusion means that there's something

3310
02:06:19,590 --> 02:06:22,920
that you think you're perceiving
that is actually not there.

3311
02:06:22,920 --> 02:06:25,770
Like an oasis in the
desert is an illusion.

3312
02:06:25,770 --> 02:06:28,410
It has no causal efficacy.

3313
02:06:28,410 --> 02:06:30,390
If you walk up to where the
oasis is supposed to be,

3314
02:06:30,390 --> 02:06:33,270
you'll say you were wrong
about it being there.

3315
02:06:33,270 --> 02:06:35,310
That's different than
something being emergent

3316
02:06:35,310 --> 02:06:37,380
or non-fundamental, but also real.

3317
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:38,460
This table is real,

3318
02:06:38,460 --> 02:06:40,620
even though I know it's made of atoms.

3319
02:06:40,620 --> 02:06:43,230
That doesn't remove the
realness from the table.

3320
02:06:43,230 --> 02:06:44,820
I think the consciousness and free will

3321
02:06:44,820 --> 02:06:47,550
and things like that are just
as real in tables and chairs.

3322
02:06:47,550 --> 02:06:50,190
- Oasis in the desert
does have causal efficacy

3323
02:06:50,190 --> 02:06:53,137
and that you're thirsty-
- Incorrect causal efficacy.

3324
02:06:53,137 --> 02:06:53,970
- [Lex] Well, you mean-

3325
02:06:53,970 --> 02:06:55,260
- At least you draw incorrect conclusions

3326
02:06:55,260 --> 02:06:56,880
about the world.

3327
02:06:56,880 --> 02:06:57,750
- Sure.

3328
02:06:57,750 --> 02:07:01,020
But imagining a thing
can sometimes bring it

3329
02:07:01,020 --> 02:07:02,940
to reality as we've seen.

3330
02:07:02,940 --> 02:07:07,410
And that has a kind of a causal efficacy.

3331
02:07:07,410 --> 02:07:08,243
- Sure.

3332
02:07:08,243 --> 02:07:10,680
But your understanding
of the world in a way

3333
02:07:10,680 --> 02:07:12,420
that gives you power over it

3334
02:07:12,420 --> 02:07:15,300
and influence over it is
decreased rather than increased

3335
02:07:15,300 --> 02:07:18,330
by believing in that
oasis that is not true

3336
02:07:18,330 --> 02:07:20,340
about consciousness or this table.

3337
02:07:20,340 --> 02:07:23,100
- You don't think it
can increase the chance

3338
02:07:23,100 --> 02:07:27,513
of a thing existing by
imagining it existing?

3339
02:07:30,060 --> 02:07:31,980
- Unless you build it or make it.

3340
02:07:31,980 --> 02:07:32,813
- No, that's what I mean.

3341
02:07:32,813 --> 02:07:35,610
Like imagining humans can fly

3342
02:07:35,610 --> 02:07:36,633
if you have the right brothers.

3343
02:07:36,633 --> 02:07:39,180
- That's better to imagine
that humans are flying.

3344
02:07:39,180 --> 02:07:40,013
- [Lex] Right.

3345
02:07:40,013 --> 02:07:42,300
- In terms of counterfactuals
in the future,

3346
02:07:42,300 --> 02:07:43,200
absolutely.

3347
02:07:43,200 --> 02:07:44,730
Imagination is crucially important,

3348
02:07:44,730 --> 02:07:46,410
but that's not an illusion.

3349
02:07:46,410 --> 02:07:47,430
That's just a-

3350
02:07:47,430 --> 02:07:48,660
- Oh, okay.
- Imagination.

3351
02:07:48,660 --> 02:07:52,323
- So the possibility of the
future versus what reality is.

3352
02:07:53,970 --> 02:07:55,980
I mean, the future is a concept

3353
02:07:55,980 --> 02:07:56,990
so you can...

3354
02:07:58,311 --> 02:08:01,074
Time.

3355
02:08:01,074 --> 02:08:02,880
Time is just a concept

3356
02:08:02,880 --> 02:08:04,410
so you can play with that.

3357
02:08:04,410 --> 02:08:06,633
But yes, reality.

3358
02:08:08,940 --> 02:08:09,773
So to you,

3359
02:08:09,773 --> 02:08:10,923
so, for example,

3360
02:08:12,258 --> 02:08:13,680
I'll ask is this,

3361
02:08:13,680 --> 02:08:18,680
so Donald Hoffman thinks that the entirety

3362
02:08:19,860 --> 02:08:21,450
of the conversation we've been having

3363
02:08:21,450 --> 02:08:24,090
about spacetime is an illusion.

3364
02:08:24,090 --> 02:08:27,300
Is it possible for you to
steel man the case for that?

3365
02:08:27,300 --> 02:08:30,570
Can you make the case
for and against reality

3366
02:08:30,570 --> 02:08:35,570
as I think he writes
that the laws of physics,

3367
02:08:35,730 --> 02:08:37,380
as we know them was based on,

3368
02:08:37,380 --> 02:08:39,870
is a kind of interface
to a much deeper thing

3369
02:08:39,870 --> 02:08:41,910
that we don't at all understand

3370
02:08:41,910 --> 02:08:44,970
and that we're fooling ourselves
by constructing this world?

3371
02:08:44,970 --> 02:08:47,430
- Well, I think there's
like part of that idea

3372
02:08:47,430 --> 02:08:48,600
that is perfectly respectable

3373
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:50,580
and part of it that is
perfectly nonsensical.

3374
02:08:50,580 --> 02:08:52,140
And I'm not even gonna try to steel man,

3375
02:08:52,140 --> 02:08:53,790
the nonsensical part.

3376
02:08:53,790 --> 02:08:58,740
The real part to me is what
is called structural realism.

3377
02:08:58,740 --> 02:09:02,940
So we don't know what the world is

3378
02:09:02,940 --> 02:09:04,593
at a deep fundamental level.

3379
02:09:05,430 --> 02:09:08,460
Let's put ourselves in the minds

3380
02:09:08,460 --> 02:09:09,994
of people living 200 years ago.

3381
02:09:09,994 --> 02:09:11,640
They didn't know about quantum mechanics.

3382
02:09:11,640 --> 02:09:13,530
They didn't know about relativity.

3383
02:09:13,530 --> 02:09:16,410
That doesn't mean they were
wrong about the universe,

3384
02:09:16,410 --> 02:09:17,370
that they understood.

3385
02:09:17,370 --> 02:09:19,230
They had Newton's laws, right?

3386
02:09:19,230 --> 02:09:20,063
They could predict

3387
02:09:20,063 --> 02:09:23,490
what time the sun was
gonna rise perfectly well.

3388
02:09:23,490 --> 02:09:25,440
In the progress of science,

3389
02:09:25,440 --> 02:09:28,170
the words that would be used

3390
02:09:28,170 --> 02:09:31,860
to give the most fundamental description

3391
02:09:31,860 --> 02:09:35,850
of how you were predicting
the sun would rise changed

3392
02:09:35,850 --> 02:09:37,440
because now you have curved spacetime

3393
02:09:37,440 --> 02:09:38,610
and things like that, right?

3394
02:09:38,610 --> 02:09:41,010
And you didn't have any of
those words 200 years ago,

3395
02:09:41,010 --> 02:09:42,660
but the prediction is the same.

3396
02:09:42,660 --> 02:09:43,493
Why?

3397
02:09:43,493 --> 02:09:45,480
Because that prediction,

3398
02:09:45,480 --> 02:09:49,350
independent of what we thought
the fundamental ontology was,

3399
02:09:49,350 --> 02:09:53,160
the prediction pointed to something true

3400
02:09:53,160 --> 02:09:56,280
about our understanding of reality.

3401
02:09:56,280 --> 02:09:59,430
To call it an illusion
is just wrong, I think.

3402
02:09:59,430 --> 02:10:01,470
We might not know what the best,

3403
02:10:01,470 --> 02:10:04,440
most comprehensive way of stating it is,

3404
02:10:04,440 --> 02:10:06,150
but it's still true.

3405
02:10:06,150 --> 02:10:10,170
- Is it true in the way, for
example, belief in God is true?

3406
02:10:10,170 --> 02:10:13,560
Because for most of human history,

3407
02:10:13,560 --> 02:10:16,990
people have believed in
a God or multiple gods

3408
02:10:17,850 --> 02:10:22,030
and that seemed very true to them

3409
02:10:24,030 --> 02:10:27,900
as an explanation for
the way the world is.

3410
02:10:27,900 --> 02:10:30,060
Some of the deeper
questions about life itself

3411
02:10:30,060 --> 02:10:31,020
with the human condition

3412
02:10:31,020 --> 02:10:33,240
and why certain things happen,

3413
02:10:33,240 --> 02:10:34,653
that was a good explainer.

3414
02:10:36,150 --> 02:10:37,083
So to you,

3415
02:10:38,610 --> 02:10:40,500
that's not an illusion.

3416
02:10:40,500 --> 02:10:42,240
- No, I think that was
completely an illusion.

3417
02:10:42,240 --> 02:10:44,610
I think it was a very, very
reasonable illusion to be under.

3418
02:10:44,610 --> 02:10:45,690
There are illusions.

3419
02:10:45,690 --> 02:10:49,320
There are substantive
claims about the world

3420
02:10:49,320 --> 02:10:53,670
that go beyond predictions
that we can make and verify,

3421
02:10:53,670 --> 02:10:55,050
which later are found to be wrong.

3422
02:10:55,050 --> 02:10:57,573
And the existence of God was one of them.

3423
02:10:58,440 --> 02:10:59,790
If those people at

3424
02:10:59,790 --> 02:11:02,040
that time had abandoned
their belief in God

3425
02:11:02,040 --> 02:11:04,380
and replaced it with a
mechanistic universe,

3426
02:11:04,380 --> 02:11:07,830
they would've done just as
well at understanding things.

3427
02:11:07,830 --> 02:11:10,260
Again, because there are so many things

3428
02:11:10,260 --> 02:11:11,520
they didn't understand,

3429
02:11:11,520 --> 02:11:13,920
it was very reasonable for
them to have that belief.

3430
02:11:13,920 --> 02:11:16,590
It wasn't that they were
dummies or anything like that.

3431
02:11:16,590 --> 02:11:18,150
But that is,

3432
02:11:18,150 --> 02:11:20,160
as we understand the
universe better and better,

3433
02:11:20,160 --> 02:11:21,660
some things stick with us,

3434
02:11:21,660 --> 02:11:23,490
some things get replaced.

3435
02:11:23,490 --> 02:11:24,935
- So like you said,

3436
02:11:24,935 --> 02:11:29,403
you're a believer of the
mechanistic universe.

3437
02:11:30,270 --> 02:11:31,290
You're a naturalist

3438
02:11:31,290 --> 02:11:32,670
and as you've described,

3439
02:11:32,670 --> 02:11:35,010
a poetic naturalist.

3440
02:11:35,010 --> 02:11:35,843
- [Sean] That's right.

3441
02:11:35,843 --> 02:11:37,290
- What's the word poetic?

3442
02:11:37,290 --> 02:11:39,990
What is naturalism and
what is poetic naturalism?

3443
02:11:39,990 --> 02:11:41,790
- Naturalism is just the idea that all

3444
02:11:41,790 --> 02:11:43,710
that exists is the natural world.

3445
02:11:43,710 --> 02:11:46,080
There's no supernatural world.

3446
02:11:46,080 --> 02:11:48,360
You can have arguments
about what that means,

3447
02:11:48,360 --> 02:11:51,270
but I would claim that
the argument should be

3448
02:11:51,270 --> 02:11:53,190
about what the word supernatural means,

3449
02:11:53,190 --> 02:11:54,330
not the word natural.

3450
02:11:54,330 --> 02:11:55,680
The natural world is
the world that we learn

3451
02:11:55,680 --> 02:11:56,943
about by doing science.

3452
02:11:58,020 --> 02:12:01,383
The poetic part means
that you shouldn't be too,

3453
02:12:03,090 --> 02:12:04,650
I wanna say, fundamentalist

3454
02:12:04,650 --> 02:12:06,900
about what the natural world is.

3455
02:12:06,900 --> 02:12:10,440
As we went from Newtonian spacetime

3456
02:12:10,440 --> 02:12:12,303
to Einsteinian spacetime,

3457
02:12:13,500 --> 02:12:15,870
something is maintained there.

3458
02:12:15,870 --> 02:12:19,710
There is a different story that
we can tell about the world.

3459
02:12:19,710 --> 02:12:22,410
And that story in the Newtonian regime,

3460
02:12:22,410 --> 02:12:23,850
if you wanna fly a rocket to the moon,

3461
02:12:23,850 --> 02:12:25,320
you don't use general relativity,

3462
02:12:25,320 --> 02:12:27,090
you use Newtonian mechanics.

3463
02:12:27,090 --> 02:12:28,620
That story works perfectly well.

3464
02:12:28,620 --> 02:12:31,770
The poetic aspect of the story
is that there are many ways

3465
02:12:31,770 --> 02:12:34,470
of talking about the natural world.

3466
02:12:34,470 --> 02:12:38,610
And as long as those ways
latch onto something real

3467
02:12:38,610 --> 02:12:40,110
and causally efficacious

3468
02:12:40,110 --> 02:12:41,910
about the functioning of the world,

3469
02:12:41,910 --> 02:12:44,490
then we attribute some
reality and truth to them.

3470
02:12:44,490 --> 02:12:45,930
- So the poetic really looks

3471
02:12:45,930 --> 02:12:49,920
at the, let's say, the
pothead questions at the edge

3472
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:52,530
of science is more open to them.

3473
02:12:52,530 --> 02:12:54,230
It's doing double duty a little bit,

3474
02:12:54,230 --> 02:12:55,920
so that's why it's confusing.

3475
02:12:55,920 --> 02:12:58,470
The more obvious
respectable duty is doing is

3476
02:12:58,470 --> 02:12:59,733
that tables are real.

3477
02:13:01,140 --> 02:13:02,580
Even though you know

3478
02:13:02,580 --> 02:13:06,090
that it's really a quantum
field theory wave function,

3479
02:13:06,090 --> 02:13:07,170
tables are still real.

3480
02:13:07,170 --> 02:13:08,340
They're a different way of talking

3481
02:13:08,340 --> 02:13:12,240
about the underlying deeper reality of it.

3482
02:13:12,240 --> 02:13:14,070
The other duty is doing is that we move

3483
02:13:14,070 --> 02:13:17,040
beyond purely descriptive vocabularies

3484
02:13:17,040 --> 02:13:20,970
for discussing the universe
onto normative and prescriptive

3485
02:13:20,970 --> 02:13:23,880
and judgmental ways of
talking about the universe.

3486
02:13:23,880 --> 02:13:25,590
This painting is beautiful.

3487
02:13:25,590 --> 02:13:26,430
That one is ugly.

3488
02:13:26,430 --> 02:13:27,840
This action is morally right,

3489
02:13:27,840 --> 02:13:29,580
that one is morally wrong.

3490
02:13:29,580 --> 02:13:33,030
These are also ways of about the universe.

3491
02:13:33,030 --> 02:13:35,970
They are not fixed by the phenomena.

3492
02:13:35,970 --> 02:13:38,310
They're not determined
by our observations.

3493
02:13:38,310 --> 02:13:41,070
They cannot be ruled out
by a crucial experiment.

3494
02:13:41,070 --> 02:13:42,300
But they're still valid.

3495
02:13:42,300 --> 02:13:43,950
They might not be universal,

3496
02:13:43,950 --> 02:13:45,390
they might be subjective,

3497
02:13:45,390 --> 02:13:46,620
but they're not arbitrary.

3498
02:13:46,620 --> 02:13:50,280
And they do have a role in
describing how the world works.

3499
02:13:50,280 --> 02:13:52,770
- So you don't think it's
possible to construct experiments

3500
02:13:52,770 --> 02:13:57,770
that explore the realms of
morality and even meaning.

3501
02:13:59,010 --> 02:14:02,100
So those are subjective.

3502
02:14:02,100 --> 02:14:03,120
- Yeah.

3503
02:14:03,120 --> 02:14:03,953
They're human.

3504
02:14:03,953 --> 02:14:04,860
They're personal.

3505
02:14:04,860 --> 02:14:05,910
- But do you think that's just

3506
02:14:05,910 --> 02:14:09,180
because we don't have the tools

3507
02:14:09,180 --> 02:14:10,830
of science have not expanded enough

3508
02:14:10,830 --> 02:14:13,140
to incorporate the human experience?

3509
02:14:13,140 --> 02:14:14,370
- No, I don't think that's what it is.

3510
02:14:14,370 --> 02:14:16,920
I think that what we mean by aesthetics

3511
02:14:16,920 --> 02:14:20,850
or morality are we're
attaching categories,

3512
02:14:20,850 --> 02:14:24,510
properties to things that
happen in the physical world.

3513
02:14:24,510 --> 02:14:26,730
And there is always gonna
be some subjectivity

3514
02:14:26,730 --> 02:14:28,380
to our attachment and how we do that.

3515
02:14:28,380 --> 02:14:29,213
And that's okay.

3516
02:14:29,213 --> 02:14:30,870
And the faster we recognize
that and deal with it,

3517
02:14:30,870 --> 02:14:32,010
the better off we'll be.

3518
02:14:32,010 --> 02:14:36,660
- But if we deeply and fully
understand the functioning

3519
02:14:36,660 --> 02:14:37,493
of the human mind,

3520
02:14:37,493 --> 02:14:39,390
won't be able to incorporate that?

3521
02:14:39,390 --> 02:14:41,790
- No, that will absolutely be helpful

3522
02:14:41,790 --> 02:14:45,360
in explaining why certain people
have certain moral beliefs.

3523
02:14:45,360 --> 02:14:48,000
It won't justify those
beliefs that's right or wrong.

3524
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:48,833
- Do you think it's possible

3525
02:14:48,833 --> 02:14:51,030
to have a kind of general relativity,

3526
02:14:51,030 --> 02:14:54,120
but that includes the observer effect

3527
02:14:54,120 --> 02:14:56,160
where the human mind is the observer?

3528
02:14:56,160 --> 02:14:56,993
- [Sean] Sure.

3529
02:14:56,993 --> 02:14:58,780
- So sort of like how we morph

3530
02:15:00,690 --> 02:15:03,720
in the same way gravity morphs spacetime.

3531
02:15:03,720 --> 02:15:07,020
How does the human mind morph reality

3532
02:15:07,020 --> 02:15:12,020
and have a very thorough theory

3533
02:15:12,210 --> 02:15:14,760
of how that morphing actually happens?

3534
02:15:14,760 --> 02:15:16,410
- That's a very pothead question, Lex.

3535
02:15:16,410 --> 02:15:17,243
- I'm sorry.

3536
02:15:17,243 --> 02:15:18,076
(Sean laughs)

3537
02:15:18,076 --> 02:15:19,623
Well, you think it's possible.

3538
02:15:19,623 --> 02:15:20,460
(Lex laughs)

3539
02:15:20,460 --> 02:15:21,570
- The answer is yes.

3540
02:15:21,570 --> 02:15:22,894
I think that there's no...

3541
02:15:22,894 --> 02:15:25,197
I think that we are part
of the physical world

3542
02:15:25,197 --> 02:15:26,943
and the natural world.

3543
02:15:28,500 --> 02:15:30,450
Physicalism would've
been just as good a word

3544
02:15:30,450 --> 02:15:31,350
to use as naturalism,

3545
02:15:31,350 --> 02:15:32,670
maybe even a more accurate word.

3546
02:15:32,670 --> 02:15:33,960
But it's a little bit more off-putting.

3547
02:15:33,960 --> 02:15:38,700
So I do wanna snap your
more attractive label

3548
02:15:38,700 --> 02:15:40,380
than physicalism.

3549
02:15:40,380 --> 02:15:42,360
- Are there limits to science?

3550
02:15:42,360 --> 02:15:43,193
- Sure.

3551
02:15:43,193 --> 02:15:44,100
We just talked about one, right?

3552
02:15:44,100 --> 02:15:46,000
Science can tell you right from wrong.

3553
02:15:47,280 --> 02:15:48,870
You need science

3554
02:15:48,870 --> 02:15:51,720
to implement your ideas
about right and wrong.

3555
02:15:51,720 --> 02:15:53,070
If you are functioning

3556
02:15:53,070 --> 02:15:56,250
on the basis of an incorrect
view of how the world works,

3557
02:15:56,250 --> 02:15:57,870
you might very well
think you're doing right,

3558
02:15:57,870 --> 02:15:59,730
but actually be doing wrong.

3559
02:15:59,730 --> 02:16:01,890
But all the science in
the world won't tell you

3560
02:16:01,890 --> 02:16:04,290
which action is right and
which action is wrong.

3561
02:16:05,130 --> 02:16:08,980
- Dictators and people in
power sometimes use science

3562
02:16:10,050 --> 02:16:13,800
as an authority to convince
you what's right and wrong.

3563
02:16:13,800 --> 02:16:16,200
Studying Nazi science is fascinating.

3564
02:16:16,200 --> 02:16:17,033
- Yeah.

3565
02:16:17,033 --> 02:16:18,600
But there's an instrumentalist view here.

3566
02:16:18,600 --> 02:16:21,030
You have to first decide
what your goals are

3567
02:16:21,030 --> 02:16:23,430
and then science can help
you achieve those goals.

3568
02:16:23,430 --> 02:16:25,230
If your goals are horrible,

3569
02:16:25,230 --> 02:16:28,020
science has no problem
helping you achieve them.

3570
02:16:28,020 --> 02:16:29,970
Science is happy to help out.

3571
02:16:29,970 --> 02:16:31,050
- Let me ask you about the method

3572
02:16:31,050 --> 02:16:33,930
behind the madness on
several aspects of your life.

3573
02:16:33,930 --> 02:16:37,950
So you mentioned that your
approach to writing for research

3574
02:16:37,950 --> 02:16:40,020
and writing popular books.

3575
02:16:40,020 --> 02:16:41,820
How do you find the time of the day?

3576
02:16:41,820 --> 02:16:44,272
What's the day in the
life of Sean Carroll?

3577
02:16:44,272 --> 02:16:45,840
(indistinct)

3578
02:16:45,840 --> 02:16:48,090
- So you don't have a
thing where in the morning,

3579
02:16:48,090 --> 02:16:51,178
you try to fight for two hours somewhere?

3580
02:16:51,178 --> 02:16:53,640
- I'm really terrible at that.

3581
02:16:53,640 --> 02:16:55,680
My strategy for finding time is just

3582
02:16:55,680 --> 02:16:58,230
to ignore interruptions and emails.

3583
02:16:58,230 --> 02:17:00,960
But it's a different time every day.

3584
02:17:00,960 --> 02:17:02,700
Some days it never happens.

3585
02:17:02,700 --> 02:17:03,533
Some weeks it never happens.

3586
02:17:03,533 --> 02:17:04,560
- You're able to pull it off

3587
02:17:04,560 --> 02:17:06,300
'cause you're extremely prolific.

3588
02:17:06,300 --> 02:17:07,890
So like you're able to have days

3589
02:17:07,890 --> 02:17:09,000
where you don't write-

3590
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:09,833
- Oh my God.

3591
02:17:09,833 --> 02:17:11,550
- And still write the next day.

3592
02:17:11,550 --> 02:17:12,480
- Right.

3593
02:17:12,480 --> 02:17:13,470
- Oh wow.

3594
02:17:13,470 --> 02:17:14,880
That's a rare thing.

3595
02:17:14,880 --> 02:17:16,830
A lot of prolific writers will-

3596
02:17:16,830 --> 02:17:18,190
- [Sean] Yes, it's true.

3597
02:17:18,190 --> 02:17:19,890
- Carve out two hours

3598
02:17:19,890 --> 02:17:21,630
because otherwise it just disappears.

3599
02:17:21,630 --> 02:17:22,463
- Right.

3600
02:17:22,463 --> 02:17:23,296
No, I get that.

3601
02:17:23,296 --> 02:17:24,630
Yeah, I do.

3602
02:17:24,630 --> 02:17:28,050
And yeah, it's just like I...

3603
02:17:28,050 --> 02:17:30,930
Everyone is has their foibles or whatever,

3604
02:17:30,930 --> 02:17:33,480
so I'm not able to do that,

3605
02:17:33,480 --> 02:17:37,770
therefore I have to just
figure it out on the fly.

3606
02:17:37,770 --> 02:17:39,180
- And what's the actual process look like

3607
02:17:39,180 --> 02:17:41,310
when you're writing popular stuff?

3608
02:17:41,310 --> 02:17:42,900
You get behind a computer?

3609
02:17:42,900 --> 02:17:43,980
- Yeah, get behind a computer.

3610
02:17:43,980 --> 02:17:45,480
And my way of doing it...

3611
02:17:45,480 --> 02:17:48,210
So my wife Jennifer is a science writer.

3612
02:17:48,210 --> 02:17:49,497
But it's interesting

3613
02:17:49,497 --> 02:17:52,140
'cause our techniques
are entirely different.

3614
02:17:52,140 --> 02:17:53,310
She will think about something,

3615
02:17:53,310 --> 02:17:54,630
but then she'll free write.

3616
02:17:54,630 --> 02:17:56,490
She'll just sit at a computer and write,

3617
02:17:56,490 --> 02:17:57,330
like, yeah, I think this,

3618
02:17:57,330 --> 02:17:58,260
I think this, something.

3619
02:17:58,260 --> 02:18:01,740
And then that will be
vastly compressed, edited,

3620
02:18:01,740 --> 02:18:03,480
and rewritten or whatever

3621
02:18:03,480 --> 02:18:05,760
until the final thing happens.

3622
02:18:05,760 --> 02:18:07,890
I will just like sit
there silently thinking

3623
02:18:07,890 --> 02:18:09,270
for a very long time.

3624
02:18:09,270 --> 02:18:12,000
And then I'll write what
is almost the final draft.

3625
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:13,260
So a lot of it happens.

3626
02:18:13,260 --> 02:18:14,760
There might be some
scribbles for an outline

3627
02:18:14,760 --> 02:18:16,140
or something like that,

3628
02:18:16,140 --> 02:18:18,230
but a lot of it is in my
brain before it's on the page.

3629
02:18:18,230 --> 02:18:19,080
- So that's the case

3630
02:18:19,080 --> 02:18:20,910
for "The Biggest Ideas in the Universe,"

3631
02:18:20,910 --> 02:18:23,520
the "Quantum" book and the
"Space, Time, and Motion" book.

3632
02:18:23,520 --> 02:18:24,660
- Yeah, "Quanta and Fields,"

3633
02:18:24,660 --> 02:18:26,760
which is actually mostly
about quantum field theory

3634
02:18:26,760 --> 02:18:28,470
and particle physics.

3635
02:18:28,470 --> 02:18:29,913
That's coming out in May.

3636
02:18:32,970 --> 02:18:35,340
I'm letting people in on things

3637
02:18:35,340 --> 02:18:36,630
that no other book lets them in on.

3638
02:18:36,630 --> 02:18:38,010
So I hope it's worth it.

3639
02:18:38,010 --> 02:18:39,240
It's a challenge

3640
02:18:39,240 --> 02:18:40,260
'cause there's a lot of equations.

3641
02:18:40,260 --> 02:18:41,250
- I mean, you did the same thing

3642
02:18:41,250 --> 02:18:42,600
with "Space, Time, and Motion."

3643
02:18:42,600 --> 02:18:44,460
You did something quite interesting,

3644
02:18:44,460 --> 02:18:47,970
which is like you made the
equation the centerpiece

3645
02:18:47,970 --> 02:18:48,803
of a book.

3646
02:18:48,803 --> 02:18:49,636
- Right.

3647
02:18:49,636 --> 02:18:50,550
There's a lot of equations.

3648
02:18:50,550 --> 02:18:55,550
Book two goes further in those directions

3649
02:18:55,650 --> 02:18:57,120
than book one did.

3650
02:18:57,120 --> 02:19:00,120
So it's more cool stuff.

3651
02:19:00,120 --> 02:19:02,490
It's also more mind-bending.

3652
02:19:02,490 --> 02:19:03,630
It's more of a challenge.

3653
02:19:03,630 --> 02:19:07,387
Book three that I'm
writing right now is called

3654
02:19:07,387 --> 02:19:09,000
"Complexity and Emergence."

3655
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:09,900
- [Lex] Oh wow.

3656
02:19:09,900 --> 02:19:11,610
- And that'll be the
final part of the trilogy.

3657
02:19:11,610 --> 02:19:13,560
- Oh, that's fascinating.

3658
02:19:13,560 --> 02:19:15,023
So there's a lot of probably
ideas that are there.

3659
02:19:15,023 --> 02:19:17,460
I mean, that's a real cutting edge.

3660
02:19:17,460 --> 02:19:20,970
- Well, but you know, I'm not
trying to be cutting edge.

3661
02:19:20,970 --> 02:19:21,803
In other words,

3662
02:19:21,803 --> 02:19:24,240
I'm not trying to
speculate in these books.

3663
02:19:24,240 --> 02:19:25,230
Obviously, in other books,

3664
02:19:25,230 --> 02:19:27,690
I've been very free about speculating.

3665
02:19:27,690 --> 02:19:29,313
The point of these books is to say things

3666
02:19:29,313 --> 02:19:32,220
that 500 years from
now will still be true.

3667
02:19:32,220 --> 02:19:34,770
And so there are some things we know

3668
02:19:34,770 --> 02:19:35,727
about complexity immersions,

3669
02:19:35,727 --> 02:19:37,170
and I wanna focus on those.

3670
02:19:37,170 --> 02:19:38,790
And I will mention,

3671
02:19:38,790 --> 02:19:40,800
I'm happy to say this
is something that needs

3672
02:19:40,800 --> 02:19:42,060
to be speculated about,

3673
02:19:42,060 --> 02:19:43,530
but I won't pretend to be telling you

3674
02:19:43,530 --> 02:19:44,460
what one is the right one.

3675
02:19:44,460 --> 02:19:46,830
- You somehow found the
balance between the rigor

3676
02:19:46,830 --> 02:19:49,260
of mathematics and still accessible,

3677
02:19:49,260 --> 02:19:50,190
which is interesting.

3678
02:19:50,190 --> 02:19:51,023
- I try.

3679
02:19:51,023 --> 02:19:52,650
I mean, look, these three books,

3680
02:19:52,650 --> 02:19:56,370
the biggest ideas books are
absolutely an experiment.

3681
02:19:56,370 --> 02:19:58,080
They're gonna appeal

3682
02:19:58,080 --> 02:20:01,380
to a smaller audience
than other books will.

3683
02:20:01,380 --> 02:20:03,360
But that audience should love them.

3684
02:20:03,360 --> 02:20:06,150
Like my 16-year-old self
would've been so happy

3685
02:20:06,150 --> 02:20:06,983
to get these books.

3686
02:20:06,983 --> 02:20:07,816
I can't tell you.

3687
02:20:07,816 --> 02:20:08,649
- Yeah.

3688
02:20:08,649 --> 02:20:09,510
In terms of looking back in history,

3689
02:20:09,510 --> 02:20:10,890
those are books,

3690
02:20:10,890 --> 02:20:13,440
the trilogy would be
truly special in that way.

3691
02:20:13,440 --> 02:20:14,670
- Work for "Lord of the Rings."

3692
02:20:14,670 --> 02:20:16,890
So I figured why not me?

3693
02:20:16,890 --> 02:20:19,710
- You and Token are just different styles,

3694
02:20:19,710 --> 02:20:20,670
different topics.

3695
02:20:20,670 --> 02:20:21,993
- Same ultimate reality.

3696
02:20:23,850 --> 02:20:27,180
- Like we mentioned, Mindscape Podcast,

3697
02:20:27,180 --> 02:20:28,380
I love it.

3698
02:20:28,380 --> 02:20:31,470
You interview a huge variety of experts

3699
02:20:31,470 --> 02:20:32,490
from all kinds of fields.

3700
02:20:32,490 --> 02:20:35,730
So just several questions I want to ask.

3701
02:20:35,730 --> 02:20:36,813
How do you prepare?

3702
02:20:37,830 --> 02:20:40,500
How do you prepare to
have a good conversation?

3703
02:20:40,500 --> 02:20:42,930
How do you prepare in
a way that satisfies,

3704
02:20:42,930 --> 02:20:45,630
makes your own curious mind happy,

3705
02:20:45,630 --> 02:20:46,470
all that kind of stuff?

3706
02:20:46,470 --> 02:20:47,580
- Yeah, no, these are great questions.

3707
02:20:47,580 --> 02:20:48,690
And I've sort of struggled

3708
02:20:48,690 --> 02:20:51,960
and changed my techniques over the years.

3709
02:20:51,960 --> 02:20:53,610
It's over 5-year-old podcast,

3710
02:20:53,610 --> 02:20:55,560
might be approaching six years old now.

3711
02:20:57,030 --> 02:21:01,230
I started out overpreparing
when I first started.

3712
02:21:01,230 --> 02:21:03,540
Like I had a journey
that I was gonna go down.

3713
02:21:03,540 --> 02:21:05,730
Many of the people I
talked to are academics

3714
02:21:05,730 --> 02:21:07,560
or thinkers who write books,

3715
02:21:07,560 --> 02:21:10,140
so they have a story to tell.

3716
02:21:10,140 --> 02:21:12,480
I could just say, okay,
give me your lecture

3717
02:21:12,480 --> 02:21:14,613
and then an hour later, stop.

3718
02:21:15,480 --> 02:21:18,090
So the mistake is to sort

3719
02:21:18,090 --> 02:21:19,153
of anticipate what the lecture would be

3720
02:21:19,153 --> 02:21:20,940
and to ask the leading questions

3721
02:21:20,940 --> 02:21:22,650
that would pull it out of them.

3722
02:21:22,650 --> 02:21:25,440
What I do now is much more,

3723
02:21:25,440 --> 02:21:26,610
here are the points,

3724
02:21:26,610 --> 02:21:29,607
here are like the big questions
that I am interested in

3725
02:21:29,607 --> 02:21:33,600
and so I have a much
sketchier outline to start,

3726
02:21:33,600 --> 02:21:37,293
and then try to make it
more of a real conversation.

3727
02:21:38,220 --> 02:21:41,460
I'm helped by the fact
that it is not my day job.

3728
02:21:41,460 --> 02:21:46,320
So I strictly limit myself to one day

3729
02:21:46,320 --> 02:21:49,830
of my life per podcast episode on average.

3730
02:21:49,830 --> 02:21:50,910
Some days take more.

3731
02:21:50,910 --> 02:21:53,550
And that includes not
just doing the research,

3732
02:21:53,550 --> 02:21:55,290
but inviting the guest, recording it,

3733
02:21:55,290 --> 02:21:57,030
editing it, publishing it.

3734
02:21:57,030 --> 02:21:59,640
So I need to be very,
very efficient at that.

3735
02:21:59,640 --> 02:22:00,473
Yeah.

3736
02:22:00,473 --> 02:22:01,950
- You enforce constraints for yourself

3737
02:22:01,950 --> 02:22:03,690
in which creativity can emerge.

3738
02:22:03,690 --> 02:22:04,770
- That's right.

3739
02:22:04,770 --> 02:22:05,603
That's right.

3740
02:22:06,540 --> 02:22:07,373
- And you know, look,

3741
02:22:07,373 --> 02:22:10,110
sometimes if I'm interviewing
a theoretical physicist,

3742
02:22:10,110 --> 02:22:10,943
I can just go in

3743
02:22:10,943 --> 02:22:14,880
and where interviewing an
economist or a historian,

3744
02:22:14,880 --> 02:22:16,110
I have to do a lot of work.

3745
02:22:16,110 --> 02:22:19,770
- Do you ever find yourself
getting lost in rabbit holes

3746
02:22:19,770 --> 02:22:23,670
that serve no purpose except
satisfying your own curiosity

3747
02:22:23,670 --> 02:22:27,690
and then potentially expanding
the range of things you know

3748
02:22:27,690 --> 02:22:29,340
that can help your actual work

3749
02:22:29,340 --> 02:22:31,110
and research and writing?

3750
02:22:31,110 --> 02:22:33,063
- Yes, on both counts.

3751
02:22:34,710 --> 02:22:37,140
Some people have so many
things to talk about

3752
02:22:37,140 --> 02:22:40,170
that you don't know
where to start or finish.

3753
02:22:40,170 --> 02:22:41,553
Others have a message.

3754
02:22:42,630 --> 02:22:44,550
One of the thing I
discovered over the course

3755
02:22:44,550 --> 02:22:48,660
of these years is the
correlation with age.

3756
02:22:48,660 --> 02:22:49,493
There are brilliant people.

3757
02:22:49,493 --> 02:22:51,810
And I try very hard on the podcast

3758
02:22:51,810 --> 02:22:53,580
to sort of get all sorts of people,

3759
02:22:53,580 --> 02:22:56,013
different ages and things like that.

3760
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:58,080
And bless their hearts,

3761
02:22:58,080 --> 02:23:00,360
the most brilliant young people are not

3762
02:23:00,360 --> 02:23:05,360
as practiced at wandering
past their literal research.

3763
02:23:06,300 --> 02:23:09,600
They are less mastery
over the field as a whole,

3764
02:23:09,600 --> 02:23:10,980
much less how to talk about it.

3765
02:23:10,980 --> 02:23:13,260
Whereas certain older people

3766
02:23:13,260 --> 02:23:14,580
just like have their patent answers

3767
02:23:14,580 --> 02:23:15,720
and that's kind of boring.

3768
02:23:15,720 --> 02:23:17,730
So you want somewhere in between,

3769
02:23:17,730 --> 02:23:21,720
the ideal person who has
a broad enough of a scope

3770
02:23:21,720 --> 02:23:22,920
that they can wander

3771
02:23:22,920 --> 02:23:25,560
outside their specific
papers they've written,

3772
02:23:25,560 --> 02:23:27,360
but they're not overly practiced

3773
02:23:27,360 --> 02:23:28,980
so they're just giving
you their canned answers.

3774
02:23:28,980 --> 02:23:31,230
- I feel like there's like
a connection to the metaphor

3775
02:23:31,230 --> 02:23:34,376
of entropy and complexity,
as you said, there.

3776
02:23:34,376 --> 02:23:35,680
- Edge of chaos.

3777
02:23:35,680 --> 02:23:36,660
Yeah.

3778
02:23:36,660 --> 02:23:38,160
- You also do incredible AMAs

3779
02:23:38,160 --> 02:23:40,067
and people should sign up to your Patreon

3780
02:23:40,067 --> 02:23:43,740
'cause you can get to ask
questions Sean Carroll.

3781
02:23:43,740 --> 02:23:45,480
Well, for several hours,

3782
02:23:45,480 --> 02:23:50,140
you just answer in fascinating ways

3783
02:23:51,420 --> 02:23:52,740
some really interesting questions.

3784
02:23:52,740 --> 02:23:54,870
Is there something you
could say about the process

3785
02:23:54,870 --> 02:23:57,300
of finding the answers to those?

3786
02:23:57,300 --> 02:23:58,133
- That's a great one.

3787
02:23:58,133 --> 02:24:00,900
Again, it's evolved over time.

3788
02:24:00,900 --> 02:24:04,470
So the Ask Me Anything
episodes were first,

3789
02:24:04,470 --> 02:24:05,700
when I started doing them,

3790
02:24:05,700 --> 02:24:08,820
they were only for Patreon
subscribers to both listen to

3791
02:24:08,820 --> 02:24:10,560
and to ask the questions.

3792
02:24:10,560 --> 02:24:13,980
But then I actually asked
my Patreon subscribers,

3793
02:24:13,980 --> 02:24:15,780
would you like me to
release them publicly?

3794
02:24:15,780 --> 02:24:17,580
And they overwhelmingly voted yes,

3795
02:24:17,580 --> 02:24:18,450
so I do that.

3796
02:24:18,450 --> 02:24:20,820
So the Patreon supporters
ask the questions,

3797
02:24:20,820 --> 02:24:22,530
everyone can listen.

3798
02:24:22,530 --> 02:24:24,240
And also at some point,

3799
02:24:24,240 --> 02:24:26,430
I really used to try to
answer every question,

3800
02:24:26,430 --> 02:24:27,630
but now there's just too many.

3801
02:24:27,630 --> 02:24:28,463
So I have to pick

3802
02:24:28,463 --> 02:24:30,930
and that's fraught with peril.

3803
02:24:30,930 --> 02:24:33,480
And my personal standard

3804
02:24:33,480 --> 02:24:35,160
for picking questions to answer is,

3805
02:24:35,160 --> 02:24:36,180
what are the ones I think

3806
02:24:36,180 --> 02:24:39,390
I have interesting answers to give for?

3807
02:24:39,390 --> 02:24:41,430
So that both means if it's kind

3808
02:24:41,430 --> 02:24:44,280
of the same old question
about special relativity

3809
02:24:44,280 --> 02:24:46,071
that I've gotten a hundred times before,

3810
02:24:46,071 --> 02:24:47,460
I'm not gonna answer it

3811
02:24:47,460 --> 02:24:48,690
because you can just Google that.

3812
02:24:48,690 --> 02:24:49,593
It's easier.

3813
02:24:51,120 --> 02:24:55,200
There are some very clear attempts

3814
02:24:55,200 --> 02:24:57,930
to ask an interesting question

3815
02:24:57,930 --> 02:24:59,730
that honestly just I
don't have an answer to.

3816
02:24:59,730 --> 02:25:01,920
Like, I read this science fiction novel,

3817
02:25:01,920 --> 02:25:02,753
what do you think about it?

3818
02:25:02,753 --> 02:25:03,810
I'm like, "Well, I haven't read it

3819
02:25:03,810 --> 02:25:06,540
so I can't help you there."

3820
02:25:06,540 --> 02:25:08,070
What's your favorite color?

3821
02:25:08,070 --> 02:25:08,903
I could tell you what it is,

3822
02:25:08,903 --> 02:25:10,683
but it is not that interesting.

3823
02:25:12,510 --> 02:25:14,223
I try to make it a mix.

3824
02:25:15,242 --> 02:25:16,950
It's not all physics questions,

3825
02:25:16,950 --> 02:25:18,300
not all philosophy questions.

3826
02:25:18,300 --> 02:25:21,510
I will talk about food,
or movies, or politics,

3827
02:25:21,510 --> 02:25:22,800
or religion if that's what people want.

3828
02:25:22,800 --> 02:25:24,930
I keep suggesting that people ask me

3829
02:25:24,930 --> 02:25:25,980
for relationship advice,

3830
02:25:25,980 --> 02:25:26,970
but they never do.

3831
02:25:26,970 --> 02:25:27,923
Yeah. I don't think I've heard,

3832
02:25:27,923 --> 02:25:29,493
I don't think I've heard one.

3833
02:25:30,420 --> 02:25:31,570
- I'm willing to do it,

3834
02:25:33,090 --> 02:25:34,050
but I'm a little reluctant

3835
02:25:34,050 --> 02:25:36,270
'cause I don't actually
like giving advice.

3836
02:25:36,270 --> 02:25:39,480
But I'm happy to talk about those topics.

3837
02:25:39,480 --> 02:25:43,620
I want to give several hours of talking,

3838
02:25:43,620 --> 02:25:47,490
and I wanna try to say things
that I haven't said before

3839
02:25:47,490 --> 02:25:48,323
and keep it interesting,

3840
02:25:48,323 --> 02:25:49,156
keep it rolling.

3841
02:25:49,156 --> 02:25:49,989
If you don't like this question,

3842
02:25:49,989 --> 02:25:50,822
wait for the next one.

3843
02:25:50,822 --> 02:25:52,680
- What are some of the harder
questions you've gotten?

3844
02:25:52,680 --> 02:25:53,513
Do you remember?

3845
02:25:53,513 --> 02:25:55,773
What kinds of questions
are difficult for you?

3846
02:25:57,210 --> 02:25:59,040
- Rarely, but occasionally,

3847
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:02,100
people will ask me a super
insightful philosophy question.

3848
02:26:02,100 --> 02:26:03,420
Like I hadn't thought of it,

3849
02:26:03,420 --> 02:26:04,980
things in exactly that way.

3850
02:26:04,980 --> 02:26:09,980
I try to recognize that a lot of times,

3851
02:26:13,477 --> 02:26:15,540
it is the opposite where it's like, okay,

3852
02:26:15,540 --> 02:26:16,740
you're clearly confused

3853
02:26:16,740 --> 02:26:17,573
and I'm gonna try

3854
02:26:17,573 --> 02:26:20,130
to explain the question
you should have asked.

3855
02:26:20,130 --> 02:26:20,963
- Well, I love those.

3856
02:26:20,963 --> 02:26:23,280
Yeah, why that's the wrong
question or that kind of stuff.

3857
02:26:23,280 --> 02:26:24,113
- Right.
- That's great.

3858
02:26:24,113 --> 02:26:24,946
- Right.

3859
02:26:24,946 --> 02:26:25,779
- [Lex] That's great.

3860
02:26:25,779 --> 02:26:26,970
- But the hard questions, I don't know,

3861
02:26:26,970 --> 02:26:30,870
I don't actually answer
personal questions very much.

3862
02:26:30,870 --> 02:26:33,210
The most personal I will
get are questions, like,

3863
02:26:33,210 --> 02:26:35,010
what do you think of Baltimore?

3864
02:26:35,010 --> 02:26:36,240
That much I can talk about are,

3865
02:26:36,240 --> 02:26:37,140
how are your cats doing?

3866
02:26:37,140 --> 02:26:40,110
Happy to talk about the
cats in infinite detail,

3867
02:26:40,110 --> 02:26:42,930
but very personal
questions I don't get into,

3868
02:26:42,930 --> 02:26:45,690
- But you even touched like
politics and stuff like this.

3869
02:26:45,690 --> 02:26:47,990
- Yeah, no, very happy
to talk about politics.

3870
02:26:48,870 --> 02:26:52,860
I try to be clear on what
is professional expertise,

3871
02:26:52,860 --> 02:26:54,210
what is just me babbling,

3872
02:26:54,210 --> 02:26:56,040
what is my level of
credence in different things

3873
02:26:56,040 --> 02:26:57,420
where you're allowed to disagree,

3874
02:26:57,420 --> 02:26:58,650
whether if you would disagree,

3875
02:26:58,650 --> 02:26:59,733
you're just wrong.

3876
02:27:00,960 --> 02:27:03,213
And people can disagree with that also.

3877
02:27:05,160 --> 02:27:08,730
I'm happy to go out on
a limb a little bit.

3878
02:27:08,730 --> 02:27:10,230
I'm happy to say, look, I don't know,

3879
02:27:10,230 --> 02:27:11,820
but here's my guess.

3880
02:27:11,820 --> 02:27:13,290
I just did a whole solo podcast,

3881
02:27:13,290 --> 02:27:15,000
which was exactly that.

3882
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:16,290
And it's interesting,

3883
02:27:16,290 --> 02:27:17,730
like some people are like,
"Oh, this was great."

3884
02:27:17,730 --> 02:27:19,177
And there's a whole
bunch of people are like,

3885
02:27:19,177 --> 02:27:20,010
"Why are you talking about this thing

3886
02:27:20,010 --> 02:27:22,437
that you are not the world's expert in?"

3887
02:27:23,490 --> 02:27:26,340
- Well, I love the actual
dance between humility

3888
02:27:26,340 --> 02:27:28,800
and having a strong opinion on stuff,

3889
02:27:28,800 --> 02:27:30,480
which is a great.

3890
02:27:30,480 --> 02:27:33,000
It's a fascinating dance to pull off.

3891
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:34,650
And I guess the way to do that is

3892
02:27:34,650 --> 02:27:38,880
to just expand into all kinds
of topics and play with ideas

3893
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:40,950
and then change your mind
and all that kind of stuff.

3894
02:27:40,950 --> 02:27:42,030
- Yeah, it's interesting

3895
02:27:42,030 --> 02:27:46,530
because when people react against you

3896
02:27:46,530 --> 02:27:50,193
by saying you are being
arrogant about this,

3897
02:27:51,330 --> 02:27:53,550
99.999% of the time,

3898
02:27:53,550 --> 02:27:55,740
all they mean is I disagree.

3899
02:27:55,740 --> 02:27:57,490
That's all they really mean, right?

3900
02:27:59,142 --> 02:27:59,975
- [Lex] Yeah.

3901
02:27:59,975 --> 02:28:01,950
- Like at a very basic level,

3902
02:28:01,950 --> 02:28:05,520
people will accuse
atheists of being arrogant.

3903
02:28:05,520 --> 02:28:08,370
And I'm like, "You think
God exists and loves you?

3904
02:28:08,370 --> 02:28:10,470
And you're telling me that I'm arrogant?"

3905
02:28:10,470 --> 02:28:15,470
I think that all all of
this is to say just advice.

3906
02:28:16,650 --> 02:28:18,450
When you disagree with somebody,

3907
02:28:18,450 --> 02:28:21,180
try to specify the
substantive disagreement.

3908
02:28:21,180 --> 02:28:22,936
Try not to psychologize them.

3909
02:28:22,936 --> 02:28:23,850
You know, trying to say,

3910
02:28:23,850 --> 02:28:26,130
oh, you're saying this because of this.

3911
02:28:26,130 --> 02:28:26,963
Maybe it's true,

3912
02:28:26,963 --> 02:28:27,870
maybe you're right.

3913
02:28:27,870 --> 02:28:30,060
But if you had an actual response

3914
02:28:30,060 --> 02:28:30,900
to what they were saying,

3915
02:28:30,900 --> 02:28:32,610
that would be much more interesting.

3916
02:28:32,610 --> 02:28:33,894
- Yeah.

3917
02:28:33,894 --> 02:28:38,010
I wonder why it's difficult
for people to say or to imply,

3918
02:28:38,010 --> 02:28:40,830
I respect you, I like you,

3919
02:28:40,830 --> 02:28:42,750
but I disagree on this

3920
02:28:42,750 --> 02:28:45,660
and here's why I disagree.

3921
02:28:45,660 --> 02:28:48,840
I wonder they go to this place

3922
02:28:48,840 --> 02:28:50,970
of, like, well, you're an idiot,

3923
02:28:50,970 --> 02:28:53,150
or you're egoistical,

3924
02:28:55,980 --> 02:28:59,880
or you're confused, or you're naive,

3925
02:28:59,880 --> 02:29:01,410
all the kinds of words

3926
02:29:01,410 --> 02:29:03,000
as opposed to, like, I respect you

3927
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:04,140
as a fellow human being,

3928
02:29:04,140 --> 02:29:07,480
exploring the world of
mysteries all around us

3929
02:29:07,480 --> 02:29:09,120
and I disagree.

3930
02:29:09,120 --> 02:29:11,040
- I will complicate the question even more

3931
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:13,640
because there's some people
I don't respect or like.

3932
02:29:15,087 --> 02:29:17,100
And I once wrote a blog post,

3933
02:29:17,100 --> 02:29:19,770
I think it was called
"The Grid of Disputation."

3934
02:29:19,770 --> 02:29:21,660
And I had a two by two grid

3935
02:29:21,660 --> 02:29:24,987
and it's, are you someone I
agree with or disagree with?

3936
02:29:24,987 --> 02:29:28,443
Are you someone who I respect or don't?

3937
02:29:29,460 --> 02:29:33,570
And all four quadrants are very populated.

3938
02:29:33,570 --> 02:29:37,382
So what that means is there
are people who I'd like

3939
02:29:37,382 --> 02:29:39,000
and I disagree with,

3940
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:40,737
and there are people who agree with me.

3941
02:29:40,737 --> 02:29:41,810
And I have no respect for

3942
02:29:41,810 --> 02:29:43,680
at all the embarrassing allies quadrant.

3943
02:29:43,680 --> 02:29:45,600
That was everyone's favorite.

3944
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:49,440
And I just think that's
great being honest, right?

3945
02:29:49,440 --> 02:29:51,750
Like trying to be honest
about where people are.

3946
02:29:51,750 --> 02:29:54,540
But if you actually want to
move a conversation forward,

3947
02:29:54,540 --> 02:29:57,300
forget about whether you
like or don't like somebody.

3948
02:29:57,300 --> 02:29:58,440
Explain the disagreement,

3949
02:29:58,440 --> 02:29:59,940
explain the agreement.

3950
02:29:59,940 --> 02:30:01,140
But you're absolutely right.

3951
02:30:01,140 --> 02:30:01,980
I completely agree.

3952
02:30:01,980 --> 02:30:03,090
Like as a society,

3953
02:30:03,090 --> 02:30:04,680
we are not very good at disagreeing.

3954
02:30:04,680 --> 02:30:06,480
We instantly go to the insults.

3955
02:30:06,480 --> 02:30:07,313
- Yeah.

3956
02:30:07,313 --> 02:30:08,580
And I mean, even on a deeper level,

3957
02:30:08,580 --> 02:30:10,773
I think at some deep level,

3958
02:30:11,700 --> 02:30:16,700
I respect and love the
humanity and the other person.

3959
02:30:19,080 --> 02:30:19,913
- Yep.

3960
02:30:21,270 --> 02:30:22,770
- You said

3961
02:30:22,770 --> 02:30:26,820
that general relativity is the
most beautiful theory ever.

3962
02:30:26,820 --> 02:30:28,140
- So far.

3963
02:30:28,140 --> 02:30:30,870
- [Lex] What do you
find beautiful about it?

3964
02:30:30,870 --> 02:30:31,710
- Let's put it this way.

3965
02:30:31,710 --> 02:30:33,513
When I teach courses,

3966
02:30:34,620 --> 02:30:37,830
there's no more satisfying subject

3967
02:30:37,830 --> 02:30:39,510
to teach than general relativity.

3968
02:30:39,510 --> 02:30:40,500
And the reason why is

3969
02:30:40,500 --> 02:30:44,160
because it starts from very clear,

3970
02:30:44,160 --> 02:30:47,190
precisely articulated assumptions,

3971
02:30:47,190 --> 02:30:48,483
and it goes so far.

3972
02:30:49,980 --> 02:30:51,060
When I give my talk,

3973
02:30:51,060 --> 02:30:51,893
you can find it online.

3974
02:30:51,893 --> 02:30:53,310
I'm probably not gonna give it again.

3975
02:30:53,310 --> 02:30:54,143
The book one

3976
02:30:54,143 --> 02:30:57,720
of The Biggest Ideas talk was building up

3977
02:30:57,720 --> 02:31:00,840
from you don't know any math or physics;

3978
02:31:00,840 --> 02:31:01,740
an hour later,

3979
02:31:01,740 --> 02:31:04,350
Einstein's equation
for general relativity.

3980
02:31:04,350 --> 02:31:09,350
And the punchline is the
equation is much smarter

3981
02:31:09,780 --> 02:31:10,780
than Albert Einstein

3982
02:31:11,730 --> 02:31:14,130
because Albert Einstein did
not know about the Big Bang.

3983
02:31:14,130 --> 02:31:16,320
He didn't know about gravitational waves;

3984
02:31:16,320 --> 02:31:17,640
he didn't know about black holes;

3985
02:31:17,640 --> 02:31:18,843
but his equation did.

3986
02:31:21,990 --> 02:31:24,480
I mean, that's a miraculous aspect

3987
02:31:24,480 --> 02:31:26,130
of science more generally,

3988
02:31:26,130 --> 02:31:28,380
but general relativity is
where it manifests itself

3989
02:31:28,380 --> 02:31:30,363
in the most absolutely obvious way.

3990
02:31:31,980 --> 02:31:33,273
- A human question,

3991
02:31:34,470 --> 02:31:35,700
what do you think of the fact

3992
02:31:35,700 --> 02:31:39,000
that Einstein didn't get the Nobel Prize

3993
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:40,260
for general relativity

3994
02:31:40,260 --> 02:31:41,730
- Tragedy.

3995
02:31:41,730 --> 02:31:46,560
He should have gotten maybe
four Nobel prizes, honestly.

3996
02:31:46,560 --> 02:31:48,300
That certainly should have got...

3997
02:31:48,300 --> 02:31:50,310
The photoelectric effect
was a hundred percent

3998
02:31:50,310 --> 02:31:51,870
worth the Nobel Prize because...

3999
02:31:51,870 --> 02:31:54,030
And people don't quite get this.

4000
02:31:54,030 --> 02:31:55,410
Who cares about the photoelectric effect?

4001
02:31:55,410 --> 02:31:57,390
That's like this very minor effect.

4002
02:31:57,390 --> 02:31:59,490
The point is his explanation

4003
02:31:59,490 --> 02:32:02,070
for the photoelectric
effect invented something

4004
02:32:02,070 --> 02:32:04,350
called the photon.

4005
02:32:04,350 --> 02:32:07,020
That's worth the Nobel Prize.

4006
02:32:07,020 --> 02:32:10,080
Max Planck gets credit for this in 1900,

4007
02:32:10,080 --> 02:32:12,360
explaining black body radiation

4008
02:32:12,360 --> 02:32:15,690
by saying that when a
little electron is jiggling

4009
02:32:15,690 --> 02:32:20,640
and object at some temperature
gives off radiation

4010
02:32:20,640 --> 02:32:24,210
in discrete chunks
rather than continuously.

4011
02:32:24,210 --> 02:32:26,460
He didn't quite say

4012
02:32:26,460 --> 02:32:30,240
that's because radiation
is discrete chunks.

4013
02:32:30,240 --> 02:32:31,860
It's like having a coffee maker

4014
02:32:31,860 --> 02:32:33,270
that makes one cup of coffee at a time.

4015
02:32:33,270 --> 02:32:36,750
It doesn't mean that liquid
comes in one cup quanta.

4016
02:32:36,750 --> 02:32:39,030
Just that you are dispensing it like that.

4017
02:32:39,030 --> 02:32:42,930
It was Einstein in 1905
who said light is quanta

4018
02:32:42,930 --> 02:32:44,970
and that was a radical thing.

4019
02:32:44,970 --> 02:32:47,160
So that, clearly, that was not a mistake.

4020
02:32:47,160 --> 02:32:49,530
But also special
relativity clearly deserved

4021
02:32:49,530 --> 02:32:50,363
the Nobel Prize.

4022
02:32:50,363 --> 02:32:53,190
And general relativity clearly
deserved the Nobel Prize.

4023
02:32:53,190 --> 02:32:54,750
Not only were they brilliant,

4024
02:32:54,750 --> 02:32:56,130
but they were experimentally verified

4025
02:32:56,130 --> 02:32:57,270
like everything you want.

4026
02:32:57,270 --> 02:32:58,710
- So separately, you think.

4027
02:32:58,710 --> 02:33:00,213
- Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

4028
02:33:01,830 --> 02:33:03,420
- Oh humans, yeah.

4029
02:33:03,420 --> 02:33:05,130
Whatever the explanation there.

4030
02:33:05,130 --> 02:33:06,900
- Edwin Hubble never won the Nobel Prize

4031
02:33:06,900 --> 02:33:10,260
for finding this universe was expanding.

4032
02:33:10,260 --> 02:33:11,093
- Yeah.

4033
02:33:11,093 --> 02:33:12,300
And even the fact

4034
02:33:12,300 --> 02:33:14,280
that we give prizes is
almost kind of silly,

4035
02:33:14,280 --> 02:33:15,570
and we limit the number of people

4036
02:33:15,570 --> 02:33:16,707
that get the prize and all that.

4037
02:33:16,707 --> 02:33:20,310
- I think that Nobel Prize
has enormous problems.

4038
02:33:20,310 --> 02:33:23,850
I think it's probably a
net good for the world

4039
02:33:23,850 --> 02:33:27,150
because it brings
attention to good science.

4040
02:33:27,150 --> 02:33:30,480
I think it's probably negative for science

4041
02:33:30,480 --> 02:33:33,300
because it makes people
wanna win the Nobel Prize.

4042
02:33:33,300 --> 02:33:34,133
- Yeah.

4043
02:33:34,133 --> 02:33:36,600
There's a lot of fascinating human stories

4044
02:33:36,600 --> 02:33:37,433
underneath it all.

4045
02:33:37,433 --> 02:33:39,570
Science is its own thing,

4046
02:33:39,570 --> 02:33:41,940
but it's also a collection of humans

4047
02:33:41,940 --> 02:33:43,230
and it's a beautiful collection.

4048
02:33:43,230 --> 02:33:44,063
There's tension.

4049
02:33:44,063 --> 02:33:44,896
There's competition.

4050
02:33:44,896 --> 02:33:47,130
There's jealousy.

4051
02:33:47,130 --> 02:33:49,590
But there's also great collaborations

4052
02:33:49,590 --> 02:33:50,940
and all that kind of stuff.

4053
02:33:52,230 --> 02:33:54,660
Danielle Kahneman, who recently passed is,

4054
02:33:54,660 --> 02:33:59,660
is one of the great stories
of collaboration in science.

4055
02:34:02,370 --> 02:34:03,960
So all of it, all of it,

4056
02:34:03,960 --> 02:34:05,460
that's what humans do.

4057
02:34:05,460 --> 02:34:07,500
And, Sean, thank you for being the person

4058
02:34:07,500 --> 02:34:10,710
that makes us celebrate science

4059
02:34:10,710 --> 02:34:11,640
and fall in love

4060
02:34:11,640 --> 02:34:13,830
with all of these
beautiful ideas in science

4061
02:34:13,830 --> 02:34:15,750
for writing amazing books,

4062
02:34:15,750 --> 02:34:19,800
for being legit and still
pushing forward the research,

4063
02:34:19,800 --> 02:34:21,330
science side of it,

4064
02:34:21,330 --> 02:34:26,330
and for allowing me and
these pothead questions

4065
02:34:27,990 --> 02:34:31,683
and also for educating everybody
through your own podcast.

4066
02:34:32,910 --> 02:34:36,120
Everybody should stop
everything and subscribe

4067
02:34:36,120 --> 02:34:37,410
and listen to every single
episode of Mindscape.

4068

So thank you.

4069
02:34:39,060 --> 02:34:40,470
I've been a huge fan forever.

4070
02:34:40,470 --> 02:34:42,510
I'm really honored that you would speak

4071
02:34:42,510 --> 02:34:43,560
with me in the early days

4072
02:34:43,560 --> 02:34:45,450
when I was still starting this podcast

4073
02:34:45,450 --> 02:34:46,470
It means the world.

4074
02:34:46,470 --> 02:34:47,303
- I appreciate it.

4075
02:34:47,303 --> 02:34:48,136
Thanks very much for having me on.

4076
02:34:48,136 --> 02:34:49,380
Now that you're a big deal,

4077
02:34:49,380 --> 02:34:50,433
still having me on.

4078
02:34:51,360 --> 02:34:52,260
- Thank you, Sean.

4079
02:34:53,100 --> 02:34:55,680

conversation with Sean Carroll.

with some words from Richard Feynman.

4084
02:35:03,660 --> 02:35:06,480
Study hard what interests you the most

4085
02:35:06,480 --> 02:35:09,990
in the most undisciplined, irreverent

4086
02:35:09,990 --> 02:35:12,120
