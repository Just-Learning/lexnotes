Patrick first science podcast out there
so you know it eventually the baton

320
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:26,280
so you know it eventually the baton
 

321

about the healthy way to do it but
 

329
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,830
about the healthy way to do it but
there's

330
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:34,840
there's
 

331
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,909
there's

mathematicians and he just walked away
 

343
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,670
mathematicians and he just walked away
from mathematics and rejected the fields

344
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:49,680
from mathematics and rejected the fields
 

345
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,670

credit rapid eye movement sleep with
 

443
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,630
credit rapid eye movement sleep with
some of the more elaborate emotion

444
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:43,640
some of the more elaborate emotion
 

445
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,070
some of the more elaborate emotion
filled dreams and the source of many

filled dreams and the source of many
 

447
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,509

Einstein people described him as taking

450
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:53,240
Einstein people described him as taking
 

451

Einstein people described him as taking
walks around the Princeton campus then

452
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:55,640
walks around the Princeton campus then
 

453
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,670
walks around the Princeton campus then
pausing and would ask him what was going

454
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:58,680
pausing and would ask him what was going
 

455
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,310
pausing and would ask him what was going
on and the the idea that his mind was

456
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,320
on and the the idea that his mind was
 

457
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,949
on and the the idea that his mind was
continuing to churn forward at a high

458
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:02,959
continuing to churn forward at a high
 

459

um so you know this is far from
 

463
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,350
um so you know this is far from
controlled studies but we're talking

464
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:09,360
controlled studies but we're talking
 

465
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,030
controlled studies but we're talking
about some incredible minds and

466
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,040
about some incredible minds and
 

467
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,470
about some incredible minds and
creatives who have a practice of steing

468
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:14,480
creatives who have a practice of steing
 

469
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,829
creatives who have a practice of steing
the body while keeping the Mind

470
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:15,839

I've been looking at what the circuitry
is and it's it's beautiful so I'll draw

1412
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:07,720
is and it's it's beautiful so I'll draw
 

1413
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,269
is and it's it's beautiful so I'll draw
the circuitry that we know underlies

1414
00:28:10,269 --> 00:28:10,279
the circuitry that we know underlies
 

1415
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:11,950
the circuitry that we know underlies
autonomic function and as I'm doing that

1416
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:11,960
autonomic function and as I'm doing that
 

1417
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,029
autonomic function and as I'm doing that
I'm thinking oh like what about

1418
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:13,039
I'm thinking oh like what about
 

1419
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,710
I'm thinking oh like what about
autonomic control and those people that

1420
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:14,720
autonomic control and those people that
 

1421
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,310
autonomic control and those people that
supposedly can control their pupil size

1422
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:16,320
supposedly can control their pupil size
 

1423
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,310
supposedly can control their pupil size
then you go in and there's a paper

1424
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:17,320
then you go in and there's a paper
 

1425
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,110
then you go in and there's a paper
published in nature press one of the

1426
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:19,120
published in nature press one of the
 

1427
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,430
published in nature press one of the
nature journals and there's a recent

1428
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:20,440
nature journals and there's a recent
 

1429
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,990
nature journals and there's a recent
paper on this like oh cool and then we

1430
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,000
paper on this like oh cool and then we
 

1431
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,630
paper on this like oh cool and then we
talk about this and then how could this

1432
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:23,640
talk about this and then how could this
 

1433
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,110
talk about this and then how could this
be put into kind of a post or how could

1434
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:26,120
be put into kind of a post or how could
 

1435
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,149
be put into kind of a post or how could
this you know so doing things that are

1436
00:28:28,149 --> 00:28:28,159
this you know so doing things that are
 

1437
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:29,990
this you know so doing things that are
about 15° off center from your main

1438
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,000
about 15° off center from your main

00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,149
you might find interesting this is just
a little bit of

1564
00:30:46,149 --> 00:30:46,159
a little bit of
 

1565
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,389
a little bit of
coffee with a scoop of Brian Johnson

1566
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:49,399
coffee with a scoop of Brian Johnson
 

1567
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:51,950
coffee with a scoop of Brian Johnson
gave me cocoa just like pure unsweetened

1568
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:51,960
gave me cocoa just like pure unsweetened
 

1569
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,110
gave me cocoa just like pure unsweetened
Coco so I put that in chocolate I like

1570
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:54,120
Coco so I put that in chocolate I like
 

1571
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,750
Coco so I put that in chocolate I like
it just for the taste well actually

1572
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:55,760
it just for the taste well actually
 

1573
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,669
it just for the taste well actually
nukes my appetite and since I'm we're

1574
00:30:57,669 --> 00:30:57,679
nukes my appetite and since I'm we're
 

1575
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,029
nukes my appetite and since I'm we're
not going out to dinner tonight until

1576
00:30:59,029 --> 00:30:59,039
not going out to dinner tonight until
 

1577
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,789
not going out to dinner tonight until
later I figure that's good yeah Brian's

1578
00:31:01,789 --> 00:31:01,799
later I figure that's good yeah Brian's
 

1579
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:03,029
later I figure that's good yeah Brian's
an interesting one right he's really

1580
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:03,039
an interesting one right he's really
 

1581
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,269
an interesting one right he's really
pushing this this thing the optimization

1582
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:05,279
pushing this this thing the optimization
 

1583
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,870
pushing this this thing the optimization
of everything yeah although he just hurt

1584
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:06,880
of everything yeah although he just hurt
 

1585
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,310
of everything yeah although he just hurt
his ankle he posted a photo that he hurt

1586
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:08,320
his ankle he posted a photo that he hurt
 

1587
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,350
his ankle he posted a photo that he hurt
his ankle so now he's injecting bpc body

1588
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:10,360
his ankle so now he's injecting bpc body
 

1589
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,950
his ankle so now he's injecting bpc body
protection compound 157 which many many

1590
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:12,960
protection compound 157 which many many
 

1591
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,470
protection compound 157 which many many
people are taking by the way I did an

1592
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:14,480
people are taking by the way I did an
 

1593
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,149
people are taking by the way I did an
episode on peptides I should just say

1594
00:31:17,149 --> 00:31:17,159
episode on peptides I should just say
 

1595
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:19,269
episode on peptides I should just say
you know bpc 157 one of the known

1596
00:31:19,269 --> 00:31:19,279
you know bpc 157 one of the known
 

1597
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,629
you know bpc 157 one of the known
effects in animal models is angiogenesis

1598
00:31:22,629 --> 00:31:22,639
effects in animal models is angiogenesis
 

1599
00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:25,029
effects in animal models is angiogenesis
like development of new vasculature

1600
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:25,039
like development of new vasculature
 

1601
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,950
like development of new vasculature
which can be great in some context but

1602
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:27,960
which can be great in some context but
 

1603
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,110
which can be great in some context but
also if you have a tumor you don't

1604
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,120
also if you have a tumor you don't
 

1605
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,669
also if you have a tumor you don't
really want to vascularize that tumor

1606
00:31:30,669 --> 00:31:30,679
really want to vascularize that tumor
 

1607
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:32,629
really want to vascularize that tumor
anymore so I worry about people taking

1608
00:31:32,629 --> 00:31:32,639
anymore so I worry about people taking
 

1609
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:34,190
anymore so I worry about people taking
bpc157

1610
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:34,200
bpc157
 

1611
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,830
bpc157
continually but um and there's very

1612
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:37,840
continually but um and there's very
 

1613
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,629
continually but um and there's very
little human data I think there's like

1614
00:31:39,629 --> 00:31:39,639
little human data I think there's like
 

1615
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:41,710
little human data I think there's like
one study and it's a lousy one so a lot

1616
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:41,720
one study and it's a lousy one so a lot
 

1617
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,470
one study and it's a lousy one so a lot
of animal data some of the peptides are

1618
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:45,480
of animal data some of the peptides are
 

1619
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,710
of animal data some of the peptides are
interesting however there's one that

1620
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:46,720
interesting however there's one that
 

1621
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,149
interesting however there's one that
I've experimented with a little bit

1622
00:31:48,149 --> 00:31:48,159
I've experimented with a little bit
 

1623
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,870
I've experimented with a little bit
called pineline which um I find even if

1624
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:51,880
called pineline which um I find even if
 

1625
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,710
called pineline which um I find even if
I've just taken it twice a week before

1626
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:53,720
I've just taken it twice a week before
 

1627
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,590
I've just taken it twice a week before
sleep then it times you it seems to do

1628
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:56,600
sleep then it times you it seems to do
 

1629
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,310
sleep then it times you it seems to do
something to the circadian timekeeping

1630
00:31:59,310 --> 00:31:59,320
something to the circadian timekeeping
 

1631
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,230
something to the circadian timekeeping
mechanism because then on other days

1632
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:01,240
mechanism because then on other days
 

1633
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,789
mechanism because then on other days
when I don't take it I get unbelievably

1634
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:03,799
when I don't take it I get unbelievably
 

1635
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:05,990
when I don't take it I get unbelievably
tired at that time that normally I would

1636
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:06,000
tired at that time that normally I would
 

1637
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,590
tired at that time that normally I would
do the injection these are things that

1638
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:07,600
do the injection these are things that
 

1639
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,870
do the injection these are things that
I'll experiment with for a couple weeks

1640
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:08,880
I'll experiment with for a couple weeks
 

1641
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,590
I'll experiment with for a couple weeks
and then typically stop maybe try

1642
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:10,600
and then typically stop maybe try
 

1643
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,669
and then typically stop maybe try
something else but I stay out of um

1644
00:32:13,669 --> 00:32:13,679
something else but I stay out of um
 

1645
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,549
something else but I stay out of um
things that really stimulate any of like

1646
00:32:15,549 --> 00:32:15,559
things that really stimulate any of like
 

1647
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:17,750
things that really stimulate any of like
major hormone Pathways um when it comes

1648
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:17,760
major hormone Pathways um when it comes
 

1649
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,389
major hormone Pathways um when it comes
to peptides that's actually a really

1650
00:32:19,389 --> 00:32:19,399
to peptides that's actually a really
 

1651
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:21,990
to peptides that's actually a really
good question of how do you experiment

1652
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:22,000
good question of how do you experiment
 

1653
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,310
good question of how do you experiment
like how long do you try a thing to

1654
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:23,320
like how long do you try a thing to
 

1655
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,149
like how long do you try a thing to
figure out if it works for you well I'm

1656
00:32:25,149 --> 00:32:25,159
figure out if it works for you well I'm
 

1657
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:27,190
figure out if it works for you well I'm
very sensitive to these things so I and

1658
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:27,200
very sensitive to these things so I and
 

1659
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,149
very sensitive to these things so I and
I been doing a lot of things for a long

1660
00:32:29,149 --> 00:32:29,159
I been doing a lot of things for a long
 

1661
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:30,350
I been doing a lot of things for a long
time so if I add something in it's

1662
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:30,360
time so if I add something in it's
 

1663
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,590
time so if I add something in it's
always one thing at a time and I notice

1664
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:32,600
always one thing at a time and I notice
 

1665
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,269
always one thing at a time and I notice
right away if it does not make me feel

1666
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:34,279
right away if it does not make me feel
 

1667
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:35,789
right away if it does not make me feel
good like there's a lot of excitement

1668
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:35,799
good like there's a lot of excitement
 

1669
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:37,750
good like there's a lot of excitement
about some of the so-called growth

1670
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:37,760
about some of the so-called growth
 

1671
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,590
about some of the so-called growth
hormone

1672
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:38,600
hormone
 

1673
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,470

Calin um I've experimented a little bit

1676
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:44,120
Calin um I've experimented a little bit
 

1677
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,190
Calin um I've experimented a little bit
with those in the past and they've nuked

1678
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:46,200
with those in the past and they've nuked
 

1679
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,549
with those in the past and they've nuked
my rap and eye movement sleep but given

1680
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:48,559
my rap and eye movement sleep but given
 

1681
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:49,870
my rap and eye movement sleep but given
me a lot of Deep Sleep which doesn't

1682
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:49,880
me a lot of Deep Sleep which doesn't
 

1683
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,950
me a lot of Deep Sleep which doesn't
feel good to me but other people like

1684
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:51,960
feel good to me but other people like
 

1685
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:57,070
feel good to me but other people like
them I also just generally try and avoid

1686
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:57,080
them I also just generally try and avoid
 

1687
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,710
them I also just generally try and avoid
taking peptide that tap into these

1688
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:58,720
taking peptide that tap into these
 

1689
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,190
taking peptide that tap into these
hormone Pathways because you can run

1690
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:00,200
hormone Pathways because you can run
 

1691
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,629
hormone Pathways because you can run
into all sorts of issues but some people

1692
00:33:01,629 --> 00:33:01,639
into all sorts of issues but some people
 

1693
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:03,870
into all sorts of issues but some people
take them safely but usually after about

1694
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:03,880
take them safely but usually after about
 

1695
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,190
take them safely but usually after about
four five days I know if I like

1696
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:05,200
four five days I know if I like
 

1697
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,389
four five days I know if I like
something or I don't and then I move on

1698
00:33:07,389 --> 00:33:07,399
something or I don't and then I move on
 

1699
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:09,789
something or I don't and then I move on
but I am not super adventurous with

1700
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:09,799
but I am not super adventurous with
 

1701
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:10,950
but I am not super adventurous with
these things I know people that will

1702
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:10,960
these things I know people that will
 

1703
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,909
these things I know people that will
take cocktails of peptides with multiple

1704
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:12,919
take cocktails of peptides with multiple
 

1705
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:15,629
take cocktails of peptides with multiple
things they'll try anything that's not

1706
00:33:15,629 --> 00:33:15,639
things they'll try anything that's not
 

1707

1868
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:16,880
a way that was a little bit scary cuz
 

1869
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,069
a way that was a little bit scary cuz
the nucleus balis is in the you know

1870
00:36:20,069 --> 00:36:20,079
the nucleus balis is in the you know
 

1871
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,950
the nucleus balis is in the you know
basil 4brain nucleus has col energic

1872
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:22,960
basil 4brain nucleus has col energic
 

1873
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,829
basil 4brain nucleus has col energic
neurons that radiate out axons little

1874
00:36:26,829 --> 00:36:26,839
neurons that radiate out axons little
 

1875
00:36:26,839 --> 00:36:28,550

wires that release acetylcholine into

1876
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:28,560
wires that release acetylcholine into
 

1877
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,630
wires that release acetylcholine into
the neocortex and elsewhere and when you

1878
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:31,640
the neocortex and elsewhere and when you
 

1879
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,630
the neocortex and elsewhere and when you
focus on one particular topic matter or

1880
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:34,640
focus on one particular topic matter or
 

1881
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,630
focus on one particular topic matter or
one particular area of your visual field

1882
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:36,640
one particular area of your visual field
 

1883
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,390
one particular area of your visual field
or listening to something and focusing

1884
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:38,400
or listening to something and focusing
 

1885
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,829
or listening to something and focusing
visually we know that there's a an

1886
00:36:40,829 --> 00:36:40,839
visually we know that there's a an
 

1887
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:41,950
visually we know that there's a an
elaboration of the amount of

1888
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:41,960
elaboration of the amount of
 

1889
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,990
elaboration of the amount of
acetylcholine released there and it

1890
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:44,000
acetylcholine released there and it
 

1891
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,910
acetylcholine released there and it
binds to nicotinic acetylcholine

1892
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:45,920
binds to nicotinic acetylcholine
 

1893
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,069
binds to nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor sites there so it's a kind of

1894
00:36:48,069 --> 00:36:48,079
receptor sites there so it's a kind of
 

1895
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,910
receptor sites there so it's a kind of
intentional modulation um by

1896
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:50,920
intentional modulation um by
 

1897
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,630
intentional modulation um by
acetycholine so you're getting an with

1898
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:52,640
acetycholine so you're getting an with
 

1899
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,390
acetycholine so you're getting an with
nicotine you're getting a exogenous or

1900
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:55,400
nicotine you're getting a exogenous or
 

1901
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,510
nicotine you're getting a exogenous or
artificial heightening of that circuitry

1902
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:58,520

2024
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:22,440
get energy that lasts all day if I wait
 

2025
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,750
get energy that lasts all day if I wait
until my peak of energy which is midm

2026
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:24,760
until my peak of energy which is midm
 

2027
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,630
until my peak of energy which is midm
morning 10:00 a.m. 11:00 a.m. and I

2028
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:26,640
morning 10:00 a.m. 11:00 a.m. and I
 

2029
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,589
morning 10:00 a.m. 11:00 a.m. and I
start exercising then I'm basically

2030
00:39:28,589 --> 00:39:28,599
start exercising then I'm basically
 

2031
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:30,870
start exercising then I'm basically
exhausted all afternoon and I don't

2032
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:30,880
exhausted all afternoon and I don't
 

2033
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,950
exhausted all afternoon and I don't
understand why I mean it depends on the

2034
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:31,960
understand why I mean it depends on the
 

2035
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,150
understand why I mean it depends on the
intensity of the workout but so I like

2036
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:34,160
intensity of the workout but so I like
 

2037
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,390
intensity of the workout but so I like
to be done

2038
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:35,400
to be done
 

2039
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,510

so you're saying it doesn't affect your

2044
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:42,560
so you're saying it doesn't affect your
 

2045
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,309
so you're saying it doesn't affect your
energy if you start out with exercising

2046
00:39:45,309 --> 00:39:45,319
energy if you start out with exercising
 

2047
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:47,069
energy if you start out with exercising
I think you can get energy and wake

2048
00:39:47,069 --> 00:39:47,079
I think you can get energy and wake
 

2049
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:49,030
I think you can get energy and wake
yourself up with exercise if you start

2050
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:49,040
yourself up with exercise if you start
 

2051
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,390
yourself up with exercise if you start
early and it and then that fuels you all

2052
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:51,400
early and it and then that fuels you all
 

2053
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,309
early and it and then that fuels you all
day long I think that if you wait until

2054
00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:53,319
day long I think that if you wait until
 

2055
00:39:53,319 --> 00:39:55,630

it talks about frequency of pregnancy as

2190
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:19,680
it talks about frequency of pregnancy as
 

2191
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,150
it talks about frequency of pregnancy as
a function of age

2192

a function of age
 

2193
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,069
a function of age
Etc um but there's this one portion

2194
00:42:25,069 --> 00:42:25,079
Etc um but there's this one portion
 

2195
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:27,349
Etc um but there's this one portion
there in the podcast where I'm talking

2196
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:27,359
there in the podcast where I'm talking
 

2197
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,230
there in the podcast where I'm talking
about the uh probability of a successful

00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:30,240
about the uh probability of a successful
 

2199
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:35,349
about the uh probability of a successful
pregnancy as a function of age and so

2200
00:42:35,349 --> 00:42:35,359
pregnancy as a function of age and so
 

2201
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,790
pregnancy as a function of age and so
there was a clip that was cut in which I

2202
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:37,800
there was a clip that was cut in which I
 

2203
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,790
there was a clip that was cut in which I
was describing cumulative probability

2204
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:40,800
was describing cumulative probability
 

2205
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,510
was describing cumulative probability
and by the way we published cumulative

2206
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:42,520
and by the way we published cumulative
 

2207
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,270
and by the way we published cumulative
probability histograms in many of my

2208
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:44,280
probability histograms in many of my
 

2209
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,829
probability histograms in many of my
Laboratories papers including one that

2210
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:45,839
Laboratories papers including one that
 

2211
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,270
Laboratories papers including one that
was a nature article in 2018 so we run

2212
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:48,280
was a nature article in 2018 so we run
 

2213
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,549
was a nature article in 2018 so we run
these all the time and yes I know the

2214
00:42:49,549 --> 00:42:49,559
these all the time and yes I know the
 

2215
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:50,670
these all the time and yes I know the
difference between independent and

2216
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:50,680
difference between independent and
 

2217
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:54,910
difference between independent and
cumulative probability just like I do um

2218
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:54,920
cumulative probability just like I do um
 

2219
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,230
cumulative probability just like I do um
the way the clip was cut and what I

2220
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:58,240
the way the clip was cut and what I
 

2221
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,190
the way the clip was cut and what I
stated unfortunately combined to a like

2222
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:01,200
stated unfortunately combined to a like
 

2223
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,270
stated unfortunately combined to a like
a pretty great Gaff where I say you just

2224
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:05,280
a pretty great Gaff where I say you just
 

2225
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,950
a pretty great Gaff where I say you just
adding I said you're just adding

2226
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:06,960
adding I said you're just adding
 

2227
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,790
adding I said you're just adding
percentages 20 20 20 to 120% and then I

2228
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:09,800
percentages 20 20 20 to 120% and then I
 

2229
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,109
percentages 20 20 20 to 120% and then I
made us kind of unfortunately my humor

2230
00:43:12,109 --> 00:43:12,119
made us kind of unfortunately my humor
 

2231
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:14,309
made us kind of unfortunately my humor
isn't always so good and I made a joke I

2232
00:43:14,309 --> 00:43:14,319
isn't always so good and I made a joke I
 

2233
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,030
isn't always so good and I made a joke I
said um 120% but that's a different

2234
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:17,040
said um 120% but that's a different
 

2235
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,109
said um 120% but that's a different
thing alog together what I should have

2236
00:43:19,109 --> 00:43:19,119
thing alog together what I should have
 

2237
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:23,950
thing alog together what I should have
said was um that's impossible you know

2238
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:23,960
said was um that's impossible you know
 

2239
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,549
said was um that's impossible you know
and here here's how it actually works

2240
00:43:25,549 --> 00:43:25,559
and here here's how it actually works
 

2241
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:27,549
and here here's how it actually works
but then the the it continues where I

2242
00:43:27,549 --> 00:43:27,559
but then the the it continues where I
 

2243
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:29,349
but then the the it continues where I
then describe the cumulative probability

2244
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:29,359
then describe the cumulative probability
 

2245
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:33,589
then describe the cumulative probability
histogram for um successful pregnancy

2246
00:43:33,589 --> 00:43:33,599
histogram for um successful pregnancy
 

2247
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,069
histogram for um successful pregnancy
but somewhere in the early portion I I

2248
00:43:36,069 --> 00:43:36,079
but somewhere in the early portion I I
 

2249
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,030
but somewhere in the early portion I I
misstated something right I made a math

2250
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:38,040
misstated something right I made a math
 

2251
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,390
misstated something right I made a math
error um which implied I didn't

2252
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:40,400
error um which implied I didn't
 

2253
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,309
error um which implied I didn't
understand the difference between

2254
00:43:41,309 --> 00:43:41,319
understand the difference between
 

2255
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:43,630
understand the difference between
independent and cumulative probability

2256
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:43,640
independent and cumulative probability
 

2257
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,349
independent and cumulative probability
which I do and it got picked up and and

2258
00:43:46,349 --> 00:43:46,359
which I do and it got picked up and and
 

2259
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:48,750
which I do and it got picked up and and
run and people had a really good laugh

2260
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:48,760
run and people had a really good laugh
 

2261
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,589
run and people had a really good laugh
with that one at my expense and so what

2262
00:43:51,589 --> 00:43:51,599
with that one at my expense and so what
 

2263
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,710
with that one at my expense and so what
I did in response to it was rather than

2264
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:54,720
I did in response to it was rather than
 

2265
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,790
I did in response to it was rather than
just say everything I just said now I

00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:56,800
just say everything I just said now I
 

2267

offered it as a teaching moment in two

2282
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:14,640
offered it as a teaching moment in two
 

2283

cumulative probability it was sort of
 

2287
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,109
cumulative probability it was sort of
interesting too a number of people that

2288
00:44:19,109 --> 00:44:19,119
interesting too a number of people that
 

2289
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,870
interesting too a number of people that
had come out critiquing the Gaff also um

2290
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:22,880
had come out critiquing the Gaff also um
 

2291
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,630
had come out critiquing the Gaff also um
like bology and folks came out pointing

2292
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:24,640
like bology and folks came out pointing
 

2293
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,950
like bology and folks came out pointing
out that they didn't understand

2294
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:25,960
out that they didn't understand
 

2295
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,510
out that they didn't understand
cumulative probability there was a lot

2296
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:27,520
cumulative probability there was a lot
 

2297
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,549
cumulative probability there was a lot
of posturing you know the dog pile

2298
00:44:29,549 --> 00:44:29,559
of posturing you know the dog pile
 

2299
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:31,309
of posturing you know the dog pile
oftentimes people are quick to dog pile

2300
00:44:31,309 --> 00:44:31,319
oftentimes people are quick to dog pile
 

2301
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:32,270
oftentimes people are quick to dog pile
they didn't understand but a lot of

2302
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:32,280
they didn't understand but a lot of
 

2303
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,069
they didn't understand but a lot of
people did understand some smart people

2304
00:44:34,069 --> 00:44:34,079
people did understand some smart people
 

2305
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,630
people did understand some smart people
out there obviously I called my dad and

2306
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:36,640
out there obviously I called my dad and
 

2307
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,270
out there obviously I called my dad and
he was just laughing he goes oh this is

2308
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:38,280
he was just laughing he goes oh this is
 

2309
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,190
he was just laughing he goes oh this is
good this is like the old school way of

2310
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:40,200
good this is like the old school way of
 

2311
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,549
good this is like the old school way of
of hammering academics um but the point

2312
00:44:43,549 --> 00:44:43,559
of hammering academics um but the point
 

2313
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:46,150
of hammering academics um but the point
being there's a teaching moment um gave

2314
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:46,160
being there's a teaching moment um gave
 

2315
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,670
being there's a teaching moment um gave
me an opportunity to say hey I made a

2316
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:48,680
me an opportunity to say hey I made a
 

2317
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,750
me an opportunity to say hey I made a
mistake I also made a mistake in another

2318
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:50,760
mistake I also made a mistake in another
 

2319
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,630
mistake I also made a mistake in another
podcast where I um did a micron to

2320
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:53,640
podcast where I um did a micron to
 

2321
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,710
podcast where I um did a micron to
millimeter conversion and or centimeter

2322
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:55,720
millimeter conversion and or centimeter
 

2323
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,150
millimeter conversion and or centimeter
conversion but and we always always

2324
00:44:57,150 --> 00:44:57,160
conversion but and we always always
 

2325
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,430
conversion but and we always always
correct these in the show note captions

2326
00:44:58,430 --> 00:44:58,440
correct these in the show note captions
 

2327
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,109
correct these in the show note captions
we correct them in the audio now um

2328
00:45:01,109 --> 00:45:01,119
we correct them in the audio now um
 

2329
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:02,670
we correct them in the audio now um
unfortunately on YouTube it's harder to

2330
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:02,680
unfortunately on YouTube it's harder to
 

2331
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,870
unfortunately on YouTube it's harder to
correct you can't go and edit and

2332
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:03,880
correct you can't go and edit and

is when like I see claims that I'm like
 

2641
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:10,630
is when like I see claims that I'm like
against fluidization of water which I'm

2642
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:10,640
against fluidization of water which I'm
 

2643
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,230
against fluidization of water which I'm
not right like we talked about the

2644
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:12,240
not right like we talked about the
 

2645
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,349
not right like we talked about the
benefits of fluoride it builds hyper

2646
00:51:14,349 --> 00:51:14,359
benefits of fluoride it builds hyper
 

2647

strong bonds within the teeth I went and

2648
00:51:16,309 --> 00:51:16,319
strong bonds within the teeth I went and
 

2649
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,750
strong bonds within the teeth I went and
looked at some of the the literally the

2650
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:18,760
looked at some of the the literally the
 

2651
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,109
looked at some of the the literally the
crystal struct not excuse me not the

2652
00:51:20,109 --> 00:51:20,119
crystal struct not excuse me not the
 

2653
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:23,190
crystal struct not excuse me not the
crystal stru structure but the the

2654
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:23,200
crystal stru structure but the the
 

2655
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,030
crystal stru structure but the the
essentially the like Micron and

2656
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:25,040
essentially the like Micron and
 

2657
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,190
essentially the like Micron and
submicron structure of teeth it's like

2658
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:27,200
submicron structure of teeth it's like
 

2659
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,829
submicron structure of teeth it's like
incredible and a where fluoride can get

2660
00:51:28,829 --> 00:51:28,839
incredible and a where fluoride can get
 

2661
00:51:28,839 --> 00:51:30,430
incredible and a where fluoride can get
in there and form these super strong

2662
00:51:30,430 --> 00:51:30,440
in there and form these super strong
 

2663
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,870
in there and form these super strong
bonds and you can also form them with

2664
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:32,880
bonds and you can also form them with
 

2665
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,589
bonds and you can also form them with
things like hydroxy appetite and why is

2666
00:51:34,589 --> 00:51:34,599
things like hydroxy appetite and why is
 

2667
00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:35,870
things like hydroxy appetite and why is
there fluoride in water well it's the

2668
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:35,880
there fluoride in water well it's the
 

2669
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,670
there fluoride in water well it's the
best okay you get you say some things

2670

are certain sunscreens that are
 

2697
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,190
are certain sunscreens that are
problematic so what and Ronda Patrick's

2698
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:05,200
problematic so what and Ronda Patrick's
 

2699
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,109

now starting to get vocal about this and
so there's certain topics that's

2702
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:08,480
so there's certain topics that's
 

2703

which you have to listen carefully to

2706
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:14,720
which you have to listen carefully to
 

2707
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,470

say and so it just seems like like with

2714
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:24,000
say and so it just seems like like with
 

2715

you worry too much about
 

2737
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,789
you worry too much about
it um then you aren't going to get the

it um then you aren't going to get the
 

2739
00:52:52,799 --> 00:52:54,510
it um then you aren't going to get the
newest information out there like

2740
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:54,520
newest information out there like
 

2741
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,069
newest information out there like
peptides there's very little human data

2742
00:52:56,069 --> 00:52:56,079
peptides there's very little human data
 

2743
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:59,150

want to get the information out do you
 

2765
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,109
want to get the information out do you
try to not just look at the science but

2766
00:53:20,109 --> 00:53:20,119
try to not just look at the science but
 

2767
00:53:20,119 --> 00:53:21,750
try to not just look at the science but
research what the communities are

2768

like to know what the extremes are but I

2796
00:53:50,789 --> 00:53:50,799
like to know what the extremes are but I
 

2797
00:53:50,799 --> 00:53:52,510
like to know what the extremes are but I
also like to know what the standard

2798

conversation is but there's generally
 

2801
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:57,069
conversation is but there's generally
more agreement than disagreement I think

00:54:06,549 --> 00:54:06,559
supplements like a protein powder which
 

2815
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:08,670
supplements like a protein powder which
is different than a vitamin and then

2816
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:08,680
is different than a vitamin and then
 

2817
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,430
is different than a vitamin and then
they are compounds there are compounds

very nervous about the fact that they're
 

2823
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:16,670
very nervous about the fact that they're
not regulated but some of them are are

how people who take care of themselves
 

2833
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,470
how people who take care of themselves
and put a lot of work into that are

2834
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:32,480
and put a lot of work into that are
 

2835
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,230
and put a lot of work into that are
often attacked that's been interesting

2836

Wellness Community is so against these

2846
00:54:45,829 --> 00:54:45,839
Wellness Community is so against these
 

2847
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:47,870
Wellness Community is so against these
things I also don't understand why they

2848
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:47,880
things I also don't understand why they
 

2849
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,710
things I also don't understand why they
have to be looked at as the only route

2850
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:49,720
have to be looked at as the only route
 

2851
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,109
have to be looked at as the only route
for some people they've really helped

2852
00:54:51,109 --> 00:54:51,119
for some people they've really helped
 

2853
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:53,109
for some people they've really helped
them lose weight and yes there can be

2854
00:54:53,109 --> 00:54:53,119
them lose weight and yes there can be
 

2855
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:54,990
them lose weight and yes there can be
some muscle loss and other lean lean

2856
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:55,000
some muscle loss and other lean lean
 

2857
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,109
some muscle loss and other lean lean
body loss but can be offset with

2858
00:54:57,109 --> 00:54:57,119
body loss but can be offset with
 

2859
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:58,750
body loss but can be offset with
resistance training they've helped a lot

2860
00:54:58,750 --> 00:54:58,760
resistance training they've helped a lot
 

2861
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:01,510
resistance training they've helped a lot
of people and other people are like no

2862
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:01,520
of people and other people are like no
 

2863
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:02,829
of people and other people are like no
this stuff is terrible I think the most

2864
00:55:02,829 --> 00:55:02,839
this stuff is terrible I think the most
 

2865
00:55:02,839 --> 00:55:04,670
this stuff is terrible I think the most
interesting thing about OIC monjaro is

2866
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:04,680
interesting thing about OIC monjaro is
 

2867
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,190
interesting thing about OIC monjaro is
that they are glp1 they're in the gp1

2868
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:07,200
that they are glp1 they're in the gp1
 

2869
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,270
that they are glp1 they're in the gp1
pathway gagon like peptide 1 and it was

2870
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:10,280
pathway gagon like peptide 1 and it was
 

2871
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:14,750
pathway gagon like peptide 1 and it was
discovered in hila monsters which is a

2872
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:14,760
discovered in hila monsters which is a
 

2873
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:18,349
discovered in hila monsters which is a
uh lizard basically and someone the now

2874
00:55:18,349 --> 00:55:18,359
uh lizard basically and someone the now
 

2875
00:55:18,359 --> 00:55:20,670
uh lizard basically and someone the now
the now the entomologist will dive on me

2876
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:20,680
the now the entomologist will dive on me
 

2877
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,510
the now the entomologist will dive on me
it's a big big lizard looking thing that

2878
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:22,520
it's a big big lizard looking thing that
 

2879
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,589
it's a big big lizard looking thing that
doesn't eat very often and they figured

2880
00:55:24,589 --> 00:55:24,599
doesn't eat very often and they figured
 

2881
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:25,750
doesn't eat very often and they figured
out that there's this peptide that

2882
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:25,760
out that there's this peptide that
 

2883
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,190
out that there's this peptide that
allows it to curb its own

2884
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:29,200
allows it to curb its own
 

2885
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,150
allows it to curb its own
appetite at the level of the brain and

2886
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:31,160
appetite at the level of the brain and
 

2887
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,829
appetite at the level of the brain and
the gut and it has a lot of homology to

2888
00:55:33,829 --> 00:55:33,839
the gut and it has a lot of homology to
 

2889
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:35,510
the gut and it has a lot of homology to
sequence homology to what we now call

2890
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:35,520
sequence homology to what we now call
 

2891
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,990
sequence homology to what we now call
gp1 so I love anytime there's animal

2892
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:38,000
gp1 so I love anytime there's animal

then hopefully they're also doing
 

2927
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,150
then hopefully they're also doing
resistance training and eating better

2928

it's bad yeah and then or if it's a

2944
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:29,240
it's bad yeah and then or if it's a
 

2945
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,710
it's bad yeah and then or if it's a
supplement it's bad depending on which

2946
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:30,720
supplement it's bad depending on which
 

2947
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,670
supplement it's bad depending on which
camp they're in and and wouldn't it be

2948
00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:32,680
camp they're in and and wouldn't it be

3407
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:37,349
um with some other divers and it turns
out with these great white sharks in

3408
01:05:37,349 --> 01:05:37,359
out with these great white sharks in
 

3409
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:38,910
out with these great white sharks in
gual Lupe that the water's very clear

3410
01:05:38,910 --> 01:05:38,920
gual Lupe that the water's very clear
 

3411
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:40,430
gual Lupe that the water's very clear
and you can swim toward them and then

3412
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:40,440
and you can swim toward them and then
 

3413
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,029
and you can swim toward them and then
they'll they'll Veer off you if you swim

3414
01:05:42,029 --> 01:05:42,039
they'll they'll Veer off you if you swim
 

3415
01:05:42,039 --> 01:05:43,470
they'll they'll Veer off you if you swim
toward them otherwise they see you as

3416
01:05:43,470 --> 01:05:43,480
toward them otherwise they see you as
 

3417
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:46,470
toward them otherwise they see you as
prey well in the evening you've brought

prey well in the evening you've brought
 

3419
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,549
prey well in the evening you've brought
all the cages up and you're hopefully

3420
01:05:48,549 --> 01:05:48,559
all the cages up and you're hopefully
 

3421
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:52,870
all the cages up and you're hopefully
all alive and we were hanging out

3422
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:52,880
all alive and we were hanging out
 

3423
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:55,430
all alive and we were hanging out
fishing for a tuna uh we had a one of

dinner and a shark took the tuna off the
 

3431
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:07,230
dinner and a shark took the tuna off the
line and it's a it's a very dramatic

3432
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:07,240
line and it's a it's a very dramatic
 

3433
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,510
line and it's a it's a very dramatic
take and you can see the the just

take and you can see the the just
 

3435
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,670
take and you can see the the just
absolute size of these great white

3436
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:11,680
absolute size of these great white
 

3437
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,269
absolute size of these great white
sharks the the waters there are filled

3438
01:06:13,269 --> 01:06:13,279
sharks the the waters there are filled
 

3439
01:06:13,279 --> 01:06:15,710
sharks the the waters there are filled
with them that's the one but so this

3440
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:15,720
with them that's the one but so this
 

3441
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:19,309
with them that's the one but so this
video just the neural Link Link was shot

01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:19,319
video just the neural Link Link was shot
 

3443
01:06:19,319 --> 01:06:22,589

3447
01:06:24,039 --> 01:06:25,150
neurosurgeon at neurolink there it is
takes it now believe it or not looks

3448
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:25,160
takes it now believe it or not looks
 

3449

like a band saw so I'm up on the deck

3454
01:06:31,069 --> 01:06:31,079
like a band saw so I'm up on the deck
 

3455
01:06:31,079 --> 01:06:34,230
like a band saw so I'm up on the deck
with Matt yeah and so when you look at

3456
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:34,240
with Matt yeah and so when you look at
 

3457
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,150
with Matt yeah and so when you look at
it from the side you you really get a

3458
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:36,160
it from the side you you really get a
 

3459
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:39,230
it from the side you you really get a
sense of this of the the girth of this

3460
01:06:39,230 --> 01:06:39,240
sense of this of the the girth of this
 

3461
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:43,309
sense of this of the the girth of this
freaking thing so as it comes up if you

3462
01:06:43,309 --> 01:06:43,319
freaking thing so as it comes up if you
 

3463
01:06:43,319 --> 01:06:44,990
freaking thing so as it comes up if you
look at the size of that thing and they

3464
01:06:44,990 --> 01:06:45,000
look at the size of that thing and they
 

3465
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,349
look at the size of that thing and they
move through the water with such speed

3466
01:06:47,349 --> 01:06:47,359
move through the water with such speed
 

3467
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:49,309
move through the water with such speed
just a couple so when you're in the cage

3468
01:06:49,309 --> 01:06:49,319
just a couple so when you're in the cage
 

3469
01:06:49,319 --> 01:06:50,950
just a couple so when you're in the cage
and the cage is lowered down below the

3470
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:50,960
and the cage is lowered down below the
 

3471
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:53,190
and the cage is lowered down below the
surface they're they're going around

3472
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:53,200
surface they're they're going around
 

3473
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,470
surface they're they're going around
you're not allowed to Chum the water

3474
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:54,480
you're not allowed to Chum the water
 

3475
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,150
you're not allowed to Chum the water
there some people do it

3476
01:06:56,150 --> 01:06:56,160
there some people do it
 

3477
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,510
there some people do it
um but and then when you kjag sit

3478
01:06:58,510 --> 01:06:58,520
um but and then when you kjag sit
 

3479
01:06:58,520 --> 01:06:59,870
um but and then when you kjag sit
they're like what are you doing out here

3480
01:06:59,870 --> 01:06:59,880
they're like what are you doing out here
 

3481
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:02,269
they're like what are you doing out here
and then you know they you swim toward

3482
01:07:02,269 --> 01:07:02,279
and then you know they you swim toward
 

3483
01:07:02,279 --> 01:07:03,870
and then you know they you swim toward
them they Veer off but what's

3484
01:07:03,870 --> 01:07:03,880
them they Veer off but what's
 

3485
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:05,950
them they Veer off but what's
interesting is that if you look at how

3486
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:05,960
interesting is that if you look at how
 

3487
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:08,069
interesting is that if you look at how
they move through the water all it takes

3488
01:07:08,069 --> 01:07:08,079
they move through the water all it takes
 

3489
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:09,549
they move through the water all it takes
for one of these great white sharks when

3490
01:07:09,549 --> 01:07:09,559
for one of these great white sharks when
 

3491
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:11,870
for one of these great white sharks when
it sees a tuna or something it wants eat

3492
01:07:11,870 --> 01:07:11,880
it sees a tuna or something it wants eat
 

3493
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:15,430
it sees a tuna or something it wants eat
is like two flicks of the tail and

3494
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:15,440
is like two flicks of the tail and
 

3495
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,309
is like two flicks of the tail and
becomes like a missile it's just

3496
01:07:17,309 --> 01:07:17,319
becomes like a missile it's just
 

3497
01:07:17,319 --> 01:07:20,750
becomes like a missile it's just
unbelievable economy of effort and ocean

3498
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:20,760
unbelievable economy of effort and ocean
 

3499
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:23,109
unbelievable economy of effort and ocean
Ramsay who is in my opinion the greatest

sharks we were down there basically like
 

3519
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,670
sharks we were down there basically like
not understanding any of this we never

3520

not understanding any of this we never
 

3521
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,109
not understanding any of this we never
should have been there and actually the

3522
01:07:43,109 --> 01:07:43,119
should have been there and actually the
 

3523
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:45,349
should have been there and actually the
air failure of the day before plus K

3524
01:07:45,349 --> 01:07:45,359
air failure of the day before plus K
 

3525

coming up from the K exit that's it I'm

3528
01:07:49,829 --> 01:07:49,839
coming up from the K exit that's it I'm

you're
 

3681
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:45,070
you're
not and you're swimming and you get hit

3682
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:45,080

by by a shark you're not I was going to
 

3685
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:49,910
by by a shark you're not I was going to
talk shit and say that a salty has way

3686
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:49,920
talk shit and say that a salty has way
 

3687
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,110
talk shit and say that a salty has way
more bite force but according to the

3688
01:10:52,110 --> 01:10:52,120
more bite force but according to the
 

3689
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,669
more bite force but according to the
internet recently data indicates that

3690
01:10:54,669 --> 01:10:54,679
internet recently data indicates that
 

3691
01:10:54,679 --> 01:10:57,590
internet recently data indicates that
the shark has a stronger bite so I I was

3692
01:10:57,590 --> 01:10:57,600
the shark has a stronger bite so I I was
 

3693
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,390
the shark has a stronger bite so I I was
I was assuming that a crocodile would

3694
01:10:59,390 --> 01:10:59,400
I was assuming that a crocodile would
 

3695
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,350
I was assuming that a crocodile would
have a a stronger bite force and

3696
01:11:01,350 --> 01:11:01,360
have a a stronger bite force and
 

3697
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:03,030
have a a stronger bite force and
therefore agility doesn't matter but

3698
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:03,040
therefore agility doesn't matter but
 

3699
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,709
therefore agility doesn't matter but
apparently a shark yeah and turning one

3703
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:09,709
of those big salties is is probably not
that you know turning around it's like a

01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:07,669
civilization exists I forgot time
because like when you don't have your

3862
01:14:07,669 --> 01:14:07,679
because like when you don't have your
 

3863
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:10,030
because like when you don't have your
phone you don't have meetings or calls

3864
01:14:10,030 --> 01:14:10,040
phone you don't have meetings or calls
 

3865
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:12,390
phone you don't have meetings or calls
or whatever you you lose a sense of time

3866
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:12,400
or whatever you you lose a sense of time
 

3867
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:14,550
or whatever you you lose a sense of time
the sun comes up the sun comes down

3868
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:14,560
the sun comes up the sun comes down
 

3869
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,950
the sun comes up the sun comes down
that's the the fundamental biological

3870
01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:16,960
that's the the fundamental biological
 

3871
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:20,550
that's the the fundamental biological
timer you know every Mamon species has a

3872
01:14:20,550 --> 01:14:20,560
timer you know every Mamon species has a
 

3873
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:22,510
timer you know every Mamon species has a
short wavelength so you think like blue

3874
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:22,520
short wavelength so you think like blue
 

3875
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:25,669
short wavelength so you think like blue
UV type but like absorbing cone and a

3876
01:14:25,669 --> 01:14:25,679
UV type but like absorbing cone and a
 

3877
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:27,830
UV type but like absorbing cone and a
longer wavelength absorbing cone and the

3878
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:27,840
longer wavelength absorbing cone and the
 

3879
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:30,030
longer wavelength absorbing cone and the
and it does this interesting subtraction

3880
01:14:30,030 --> 01:14:30,040
and it does this interesting subtraction
 

3881
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:31,550
and it does this interesting subtraction
to designate when it's morning and

3882
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:31,560
to designate when it's morning and
 

3883
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:32,830
to designate when it's morning and
evening because when the sun is low in

3884
01:14:32,830 --> 01:14:32,840
evening because when the sun is low in
 

3885
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:34,310
evening because when the sun is low in
the sky you've got short wavelength and

3886
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:34,320
the sky you've got short wavelength and
 

3887
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,390
the sky you've got short wavelength and
long wavelength light like if you look

3888
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:36,400
long wavelength light like if you look
 

3889
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:38,070
long wavelength light like if you look
at a Sunrise it's got blues and yellows

3890
01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:38,080
at a Sunrise it's got blues and yellows
 

3891
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:39,070
at a Sunrise it's got blues and yellows
orange and yellows you look in the

3892
01:14:39,070 --> 01:14:39,080
orange and yellows you look in the
 

3893
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:41,629
orange and yellows you look in the
evening Reds orange and and blues and in

3894
01:14:41,629 --> 01:14:41,639
evening Reds orange and and blues and in
 

3895
01:14:41,639 --> 01:14:43,430
evening Reds orange and and blues and in
the middle of the day it's like full

3896
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:43,440
the middle of the day it's like full
 

3897
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:44,669
the middle of the day it's like full
spectrum light now it's always full

3898
01:14:44,669 --> 01:14:44,679
spectrum light now it's always full
 

3899
01:14:44,679 --> 01:14:47,709
spectrum light now it's always full
spectrum light but because of some

3900
01:14:47,709 --> 01:14:47,719
spectrum light but because of some
 

3901
01:14:47,719 --> 01:14:49,910
spectrum light but because of some
atmospheric elements and because of the

3902
01:14:49,910 --> 01:14:49,920
atmospheric elements and because of the
 

3903
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,510
atmospheric elements and because of the
low solar angle you like that difference

3904
01:14:52,510 --> 01:14:52,520
low solar angle you like that difference
 

3905
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:54,669
low solar angle you like that difference
between the the different wavelengths of

3906
01:14:54,669 --> 01:14:54,679
between the the different wavelengths of
 

3907
01:14:54,679 --> 01:14:56,550
between the the different wavelengths of
light is is the fundamental signal that

3908
01:14:56,550 --> 01:14:56,560
light is is the fundamental signal that
 

3909
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,550
light is is the fundamental signal that
the neurons in your eye pay attention to

3910
01:14:58,550 --> 01:14:58,560
the neurons in your eye pay attention to
 

3911
01:14:58,560 --> 01:14:59,750
the neurons in your eye pay attention to
and and signal to your circadian

3912
01:14:59,750 --> 01:14:59,760
and and signal to your circadian
 

3913
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,629
and and signal to your circadian
timekeeping mechanism like we are at the

3914
01:15:01,629 --> 01:15:01,639
timekeeping mechanism like we are at the
 

3915
01:15:01,639 --> 01:15:03,350
timekeeping mechanism like we are at the
core of our brain in the supermatic

3916
01:15:03,350 --> 01:15:03,360
core of our brain in the supermatic
 

3917
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:08,390
core of our brain in the supermatic
nucleus we are we are like wired to be

3918
01:15:08,390 --> 01:15:08,400
nucleus we are we are like wired to be
 

3919
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,229
nucleus we are we are like wired to be
entrained to the rising and setting of

3920
01:15:10,229 --> 01:15:10,239
entrained to the rising and setting of
 

3921
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:12,430
entrained to the rising and setting of
the sun like that's the biological timer

3922
01:15:12,430 --> 01:15:12,440
the sun like that's the biological timer
 

3923
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:13,990
the sun like that's the biological timer
which makes perfect sense because you

3924
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:14,000
which makes perfect sense because you
 

3925
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,550
which makes perfect sense because you
know obviously as the planets um as the

3926
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:16,560
know obviously as the planets um as the
 

3927
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,070
know obviously as the planets um as the
planets spin and revolve I also wonder

3928
01:15:19,070 --> 01:15:19,080
planets spin and revolve I also wonder
 

3929
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,790
planets spin and revolve I also wonder
like how that is affected by you know in

3930
01:15:20,790 --> 01:15:20,800
like how that is affected by you know in
 

3931
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,669
like how that is affected by you know in
the rainforest the sun is not visible

3932
01:15:23,669 --> 01:15:23,679
the rainforest the sun is not visible
 

3933
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:26,149
the rainforest the sun is not visible
often so you're under the cover of of

3934
01:15:26,149 --> 01:15:26,159
often so you're under the cover of of
 

3935
01:15:26,159 --> 01:15:28,790
often so you're under the cover of of
the trees so maybe that affects well

3936
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:28,800
the trees so maybe that affects well
 

3937
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,950
the trees so maybe that affects well
there are social rhythms their feeding

3938
01:15:30,950 --> 01:15:30,960
there are social rhythms their feeding
 

3939
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,629
there are social rhythms their feeding
rhythms sometimes in in terms of some

3940
01:15:33,629 --> 01:15:33,639
rhythms sometimes in in terms of some
 

3941
01:15:33,639 --> 01:15:35,470
rhythms sometimes in in terms of some
species will signal the timing of

3942
01:15:35,470 --> 01:15:35,480
species will signal the timing of
 

3943
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:38,669
species will signal the timing of
activity of other species and um but

3944
01:15:38,669 --> 01:15:38,679
activity of other species and um but
 

3945
01:15:38,679 --> 01:15:41,070
activity of other species and um but
yeah getting out from the canopy is is

3946
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:41,080
yeah getting out from the canopy is is
 

3947
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:43,310
yeah getting out from the canopy is is
critical of course even Under The Canopy

3948
01:15:43,310 --> 01:15:43,320
critical of course even Under The Canopy
 

3949
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:45,030
critical of course even Under The Canopy
during the daytime there's far more

3950
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:45,040
during the daytime there's far more
 

3951
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,510
during the daytime there's far more
photons than at night you know this

3952
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:47,520
photons than at night you know this
 

3953
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:48,790
photons than at night you know this
always when I'm telling people to get

3954
01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:48,800
always when I'm telling people to get
 

3955
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,149
always when I'm telling people to get
sunlight in their eyes in the morning

3956
01:15:50,149 --> 01:15:50,159
sunlight in their eyes in the morning
 

3957
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:51,870
sunlight in their eyes in the morning
and in the evening people say there's no

3958
01:15:51,870 --> 01:15:51,880
and in the evening people say there's no
 

3959
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,350
and in the evening people say there's no
light no sunlight this time here I'm

3960
01:15:53,350 --> 01:15:53,360
light no sunlight this time here I'm
 

3961
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:55,470
light no sunlight this time here I'm
like it go outside on a really cast day

3962
01:15:55,470 --> 01:15:55,480
like it go outside on a really cast day
 

3963
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:57,470
like it go outside on a really cast day
it's far brighter than it is at night

3964
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:57,480
it's far brighter than it is at night
 

3965
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,070
it's far brighter than it is at night
right so um there's still lots of

3966
01:15:59,070 --> 01:15:59,080
right so um there's still lots of
 

3967
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:00,629
right so um there's still lots of
sunlight even if you can't see the Sun

3968
01:16:00,629 --> 01:16:00,639
sunlight even if you can't see the Sun
 

3969
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:04,830
sunlight even if you can't see the Sun
as an object but I I love um time

3970
01:16:04,830 --> 01:16:04,840
as an object but I I love um time
 

3971
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:07,510
as an object but I I love um time
perception shifts and you mentioned that

3972
01:16:07,510 --> 01:16:07,520
perception shifts and you mentioned that
 

3973
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:09,070
perception shifts and you mentioned that
in the jungle it's linked to the rising

3974
01:16:09,070 --> 01:16:09,080
in the jungle it's linked to the rising
 

3975
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:10,790
in the jungle it's linked to the rising
and setting of the sun you also mention

3976
01:16:10,790 --> 01:16:10,800
and setting of the sun you also mention
 

3977
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,390
and setting of the sun you also mention
that on iasa you zoomed out from from

3978
01:16:13,390 --> 01:16:13,400
that on iasa you zoomed out from from
 

3979
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:14,910
that on iasa you zoomed out from from
the earth the these are like to me the

3980
01:16:14,910 --> 01:16:14,920
the earth the these are like to me the
 

3981
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:17,030
the earth the these are like to me the
most interesting aspects of having a

3982
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:17,040
most interesting aspects of having a
 

3983
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:18,990
most interesting aspects of having a
human brain as opposed to another brain

3984
01:16:18,990 --> 01:16:19,000
human brain as opposed to another brain
 

3985
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,790
human brain as opposed to another brain
course have only ever had a human brain

3986
01:16:20,790 --> 01:16:20,800
course have only ever had a human brain
 

3987
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:24,110
course have only ever had a human brain
but which is that you can consciously

3988
01:16:24,110 --> 01:16:24,120
but which is that you can consciously
 

3989
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:25,470
but which is that you can consciously
set your

01:16:25,470 --> 01:16:25,480
set your
 

3991
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:28,470
set your
uh time domain window like you can we

3992
01:16:28,470 --> 01:16:28,480
uh time domain window like you can we
 

3993
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,229
uh time domain window like you can we
can be focused here we can be focused on

can be focused here we can be focused on
 

3995
01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:31,669
can be focused here we can be focused on
all of Austin or we can be focused on

the entire planet you can make those

3998
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:34,000
the entire planet you can make those
 

3999
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,149
the entire planet you can make those
choices consciously but in the time

4000
01:16:36,149 --> 01:16:36,159
choices consciously but in the time
 

4001
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:37,669
choices consciously but in the time
domain it's it's hard like different

4002
01:16:37,669 --> 01:16:37,679
domain it's it's hard like different
 

4003
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:39,669
domain it's it's hard like different
activities bring us into fine slicing or

4004
01:16:39,669 --> 01:16:39,679
activities bring us into fine slicing or
 

4005
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:41,790
activities bring us into fine slicing or

unbelievably um fluid the human brain is

4014
01:16:52,030 --> 01:16:52,040
unbelievably um fluid the human brain is
 

4015
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:54,550
unbelievably um fluid the human brain is
