00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,349
would like do things in bursts like even
in that half an hour I would just go

2334
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:42,359
in that half an hour I would just go
 

2335
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:43,829
in that half an hour I would just go
like play for a couple minutes and then

2336
00:51:43,829 --> 00:51:43,839
like play for a couple minutes and then
 

2337
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:46,230
like play for a couple minutes and then
I'd stop for like a minute and then I'd

2338
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:46,240
I'd stop for like a minute and then I'd
 

2339
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,190
I'd stop for like a minute and then I'd
do it again and I noticed there was like

2340
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:48,200
do it again and I noticed there was like
 

2341
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:51,109
do it again and I noticed there was like
a huge difference between the first time

2342
00:51:51,109 --> 00:51:51,119
a huge difference between the first time
 

2343
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:52,390
a huge difference between the first time
and the second time whereas if I just

2344
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:52,400
and the second time whereas if I just
 

2345
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,589
and the second time whereas if I just
kept repeating stuff it would be like

2346
00:51:54,589 --> 00:51:54,599
kept repeating stuff it would be like
 

2347
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:56,150
kept repeating stuff it would be like
much slower

2348
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:56,160
much slower
 

2349
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,549
much slower

well what did you do in the in that
 

2351
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:01,630
well what did you do in the in that
minute just hang out just integrate like

2352
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:01,640
minute just hang out just integrate like
 

2353
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,309
minute just hang out just integrate like
yeah I just like my brain it's like my

2354
00:52:03,309 --> 00:52:03,319

2359
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,109
for a sec that's enough information let
me let me take a second to integrate

2360
00:52:09,109 --> 00:52:09,119
me let me take a second to integrate
 

2361
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:10,670
me let me take a second to integrate
that yeah that's what at least what it

2362
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:10,680
that yeah that's what at least what it

seconds or a minute your brain does the
 

2387
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:50,390
seconds or a minute your brain does the
repetition 20 to 30 times faster and in

2388
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:50,400
repetition 20 to 30 times faster and in

was a kid like now there's science that

2394
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:56,680
was a kid like now there's science that
 

2395
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:59,069
was a kid like now there's science that
proves that which is really cool from

2396

narrowed it down to like four and it
 

2467
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,990
narrowed it down to like four and it
took him like 15 years to write that

you know you got to go through the the

2726
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:05,160
you know you got to go through the the
 

2727
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:07,510
you know you got to go through the the
physical the physical aspect of it the

2728
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:07,520
physical the physical aspect of it the
 

2729
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,230
physical the physical aspect of it the
motor skills and all of that and

2730
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:09,240
motor skills and all of that and
 

2731
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,670
motor skills and all of that and
hopefully you get through that really

2732
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:10,680
hopefully you get through that really
 

2733
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,789
hopefully you get through that really
quickly so you can get to the

2734

quickly so you can get to the
 

2735
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:15,630
quickly so you can get to the
expression quickly because if you get

2736
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:15,640
expression quickly because if you get
 

2737
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:18,029
expression quickly because if you get
stuck in just that first phase that's be

2738
01:00:18,029 --> 01:00:18,039
stuck in just that first phase that's be
 

2739
01:00:18,039 --> 01:00:20,150
stuck in just that first phase that's be
really boring yeah but that's a that's a

2740
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:20,160
really boring yeah but that's a that's a
 

2741

01:00:21,549 --> 01:00:21,559
pretty long phase the
 

2743
01:00:21,559 --> 01:00:23,950
pretty long phase the
technical the the the technical skill

2744
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:23,960

strengths in learning like more oral or
 

2759
01:00:44,039 --> 01:00:48,270
strengths in learning like more oral or
more like is it more like K like what's

2760
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:48,280
more like is it more like K like what's
 

2761
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,510
more like is it more like K like what's
what's your strength and playing off of

what's your strength and playing off of
 

2763
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:54,750
what's your strength and playing off of
those strengths so for me like it was

2764
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:54,760
those strengths so for me like it was
 

2765
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,349
those strengths so for me like it was
like like I was saying earlier it was

2766
01:00:56,349 --> 01:00:56,359
like like I was saying earlier it was
 

2767
01:00:56,359 --> 01:00:58,470
like like I was saying earlier it was
just an intuitive thing that I knew I

2768
01:00:58,470 --> 01:00:58,480
just an intuitive thing that I knew I
 

2769
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,990
just an intuitive thing that I knew I
can feel when my brain is full like that

2770
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:02,000
can feel when my brain is full like that
 

2771
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,710
can feel when my brain is full like that
it needs processing time and so I listen

2772
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:04,720
it needs processing time and so I listen
 

2773
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:07,349
it needs processing time and so I listen
to that I don't push past it uh even if

2774
01:01:07,349 --> 01:01:07,359
to that I don't push past it uh even if

that humans can create yeah there'll be
 

3819
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:20,790
that humans can create yeah there'll be
a greater valuation of imperfections

a greater valuation of imperfections
 

3821

that's also very sad but then you get
 

3827
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:30,350
that's also very sad but then you get
closer and closer to what it means to be

not my path that might be your path so
I'm not really again otherwise it feels

4026
01:27:58,830 --> 01:27:58,840
I'm not really again otherwise it feels
 

4027
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:01,390
I'm not really again otherwise it feels
like a sport like who can run the

4028
01:28:01,390 --> 01:28:01,400
like a sport like who can run the
 

4029
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:02,910
like a sport like who can run the
fastest race and it's like well okay

4030
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:02,920
fastest race and it's like well okay
 

4031
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:05,790
fastest race and it's like well okay
well I get that for that for sport maybe

4032
01:28:05,790 --> 01:28:05,800
well I get that for that for sport maybe
 

4033
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:07,950
well I get that for that for sport maybe
it makes sense to have someone a bit

4034
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:07,960
it makes sense to have someone a bit
 

4035
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:10,629
it makes sense to have someone a bit
more hardcore but still like I would say

4036
01:28:10,629 --> 01:28:10,639
more hardcore but still like I would say
 

4037
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:12,310
more hardcore but still like I would say
athletes have the same mentality they've

4038
01:28:12,310 --> 01:28:12,320
athletes have the same mentality they've
 

4039
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:14,390
athletes have the same mentality they've
got they've got that in them already too

4040
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:14,400
got they've got that in them already too
 

4041
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:17,629
got they've got that in them already too
like so I think more like of a strategic

4042
01:28:17,629 --> 01:28:17,639
like so I think more like of a strategic
 

4043
01:28:17,639 --> 01:28:20,189
like so I think more like of a strategic
