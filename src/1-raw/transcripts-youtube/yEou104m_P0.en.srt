00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:53,240
to fire into the sky every morning yeah
 

939
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,030
to fire into the sky every morning yeah
there's no way and he didn't do anything

940
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,040
there's no way and he didn't do anything
 

941
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,069
there's no way and he didn't do anything
creative in those in those final years

942
00:16:57,069 --> 00:16:57,079
creative in those in those final years
 

943
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:59,309
creative in those in those final years
yeah but so the creativity goes away and

944
00:16:59,309 --> 00:16:59,319
yeah but so the creativity goes away and
 

945
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:00,829
yeah but so the creativity goes away and

on earth to Inuit it that is really

1038
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:53,240
on earth to Inuit it that is really
 

1039
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,390
on earth to Inuit it that is really
really really difficult and it's really

sad uh to me that he didn't get a Nobel

1042
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:57,840
sad uh to me that he didn't get a Nobel
 

1043
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,430
sad uh to me that he didn't get a Nobel
Prize for that was was there people

1044
00:18:59,430 --> 00:18:59,440
Prize for that was was there people
 

1045
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,070
Prize for that was was there people
saying he was crazy when he was around

1046
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,080
saying he was crazy when he was around
 

1047
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,990
saying he was crazy when he was around
or was was he universally recognized

1048
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:04,000
or was was he universally recognized
 

1049
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,190
or was was he universally recognized
it's like an OG of no I think once the

1050
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:06,200
it's like an OG of no I think once the
 

1051
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,750
it's like an OG of no I think once the
papers came out he was widely recognized

1052
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:08,760
papers came out he was widely recognized
 

1053
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,789
papers came out he was widely recognized
as as a true genius but before that he

1054
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:11,799
as as a true genius but before that he
 

1055
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:13,750
as as a true genius but before that he
wasn't recognized he had a really

1056
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:13,760
wasn't recognized he had a really
 

1057
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,870
wasn't recognized he had a really
difficult so back up where does a black

1058
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:15,880
difficult so back up where does a black
 

1059
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,710
difficult so back up where does a black
hole go like after something gets sucked

1060
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:17,720
hole go like after something gets sucked
 

1061
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,710
hole go like after something gets sucked
into it you mean is it a portal to

1062
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:19,720
into it you mean is it a portal to
 

1063
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,029
into it you mean is it a portal to
another place that kind of thing yeah no

1064
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:22,039
another place that kind of thing yeah no
 

1065
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:23,549
another place that kind of thing yeah no
h well we don't we don't know it could

1066
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:23,559
h well we don't we don't know it could
 

1067
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:25,270
h well we don't we don't know it could
be like it could be uh that the universe

1068
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:25,280
be like it could be uh that the universe
 

1069
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,870
be like it could be uh that the universe
is kind of like swiss cheese full of

1070
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:26,880
is kind of like swiss cheese full of
 

1071
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,710
is kind of like swiss cheese full of
black holes there's something called

1072
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:28,720
black holes there's something called
 

1073
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,789
black holes there's something called
Hawking radiation where the because of

1074
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:30,799
Hawking radiation where the because of
 

1075
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,390
Hawking radiation where the because of
quantum mechanics the information leaks

1076
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:33,400
quantum mechanics the information leaks
 

1077
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,190
quantum mechanics the information leaks
out of a black hole so it is possible to

1078
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:35,200
out of a black hole so it is possible to
 

1079
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,029
out of a black hole so it is possible to
escape a black hole there's a lot of

1080
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:37,039
escape a black hole there's a lot of
 

1081
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,390
escape a black hole there's a lot of
interesting questions there I hope we

1082
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:38,400
interesting questions there I hope we
 

1083
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,950
interesting questions there I hope we
get to the bottom of that and there's a

1084
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:39,960
get to the bottom of that and there's a
 

1085
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,390
get to the bottom of that and there's a
super massive black hole at the center

1086
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:41,400
super massive black hole at the center
 

1087
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,990
super massive black hole at the center
of our galaxy which doesn't seem to

1088
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,000
of our galaxy which doesn't seem to
 

1089
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,190
of our galaxy which doesn't seem to
scare physicist but it terrifies me oh

1090
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:46,200
scare physicist but it terrifies me oh
 

1091
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,630
scare physicist but it terrifies me oh
yeah for sure astronomy can be

1092

kind of picked out it made you look

2775
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,670
ridiculous but in the best kind of way
the tough part about quarter confessions

2776
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:35,680
the tough part about quarter confessions
 

2777
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,109
the tough part about quarter confessions
for me is that everybody that was

2778
00:49:38,109 --> 00:49:38,119
for me is that everybody that was
 

2779
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:40,750
for me is that everybody that was
featured for the most part would more or

2780
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:40,760
featured for the most part would more or
 

2781
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,510
featured for the most part would more or
less regret being a part of the show

2782
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:43,520
less regret being a part of the show
 

2783
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,270
less regret being a part of the show
yeah and that over time just gave me a

2784
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:46,280
yeah and that over time just gave me a
 

2785
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,750
yeah and that over time just gave me a
bad feeling where I was like you know

2786
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:47,760
bad feeling where I was like you know

2789
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,390
what I kind of feel like I'm doing an
ambush interview especially cuz I'm

2790
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:52,400

00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,270
presenting as so agreeable yet the
intention is to make something funny

2794
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:57,280
intention is to make something funny
 

2795
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,910
intention is to make something funny
yeah and I get that that's what people

00:49:58,910 --> 00:49:58,920
yeah and I get that that's what people
 

2797
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,309
yeah and I get that that's what people
do in the satire sphere I'm sure Al and

2798
00:50:02,309 --> 00:50:02,319
do in the satire sphere I'm sure Al and
 

2799
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:04,910

Bruno and Borat did the same thing and I

2800
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:04,920
Bruno and Borat did the same thing and I
 

2801
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,510
Bruno and Borat did the same thing and I
don't think it's unethical cuz that's

2802
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:06,520
don't think it's unethical cuz that's
 

2803
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,069
don't think it's unethical cuz that's
all for the purposes of Comedy it is

2804
00:50:08,069 --> 00:50:08,079
all for the purposes of Comedy it is
 

2805
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:10,910
all for the purposes of Comedy it is
what it is but for me I wanted to do

2806
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:10,920
what it is but for me I wanted to do
 

2807
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,870
what it is but for me I wanted to do
something different yeah because there's

2808
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:13,880
something different yeah because there's
 

2809
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,309
something different yeah because there's
an intimacy to confessing a thing right

2810
00:50:16,309 --> 00:50:16,319
an intimacy to confessing a thing right
 

2811
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:18,789
an intimacy to confessing a thing right
and then you just don't really realize

2812
00:50:18,789 --> 00:50:18,799
and then you just don't really realize
 

2813
00:50:18,799 --> 00:50:20,190
and then you just don't really realize
the implications of that and the

2814
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:20,200
the implications of that and the
 

2815
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,549
the implications of that and the
atmosphere of Bourbon Street is like

2816
00:50:21,549 --> 00:50:21,559
atmosphere of Bourbon Street is like
 

2817
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:23,510
atmosphere of Bourbon Street is like
anything goes like it's a free-spirited

2818
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:23,520
anything goes like it's a free-spirited
 

2819
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,150
anything goes like it's a free-spirited
place but if you transport that energy

2820
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:26,160
place but if you transport that energy
 

2821
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,510
place but if you transport that energy
digitally to a different place like

syndrome like when people are kind of a

5120
01:33:34,790 --> 01:33:34,800
syndrome like when people are kind of a
 

5121
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:36,149
syndrome like when people are kind of a
part of the production but they're not

part of the production but they're not

actually the people on the periphery and
 

5131
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:45,669
actually the people on the periphery and
so they start to believe that they can

5132
01:33:45,669 --> 01:33:45,679
so they start to believe that they can
 

5133
01:33:45,679 --> 01:33:47,070
so they start to believe that they can
just shift things around and the

just shift things around and the

for me and when I interviewed him you
know I didn't necessarily portray him in

wasn't too bad of trouble but definitely
 

6283
01:55:45,719 --> 01:55:46,990
wasn't too bad of trouble but definitely
I do think

6284
01:55:46,990 --> 01:55:47,000
I do think
 

6285
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,310
I do think
sometimes what the film would have been

6286
01:55:49,310 --> 01:55:49,320
sometimes what the film would have been
 

6287
01:55:49,320 --> 01:55:51,030
sometimes what the film would have been
like without him and I think that it was

6288
01:55:51,030 --> 01:55:51,040
like without him and I think that it was
 

6289
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:52,910
like without him and I think that it was
worth it because his scene is so funny

6290
01:55:52,910 --> 01:55:52,920
worth it because his scene is so funny
 

6291
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:54,510
worth it because his scene is so funny
to me and it brings me back to a

6292
01:55:54,510 --> 01:55:54,520
to me and it brings me back to a
 

6293
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:55,870
to me and it brings me back to a
different time in my life and I'm happy

01:55:55,880 --> 01:55:57,669
different time in my life and I'm happy
that that scene's out there I think it

6296
01:55:57,669 --> 01:55:57,679
that that scene's out there I think it
 

6297
01:55:57,679 --> 01:55:59,990
that that scene's out there I think it
it was it was really well done it show

100% you think Alex believes what he
 

6351
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:03,350
100% you think Alex believes what he

on infow Wars like how much of it is
real he's right about like big Tech

6356
01:57:07,589 --> 01:57:07,599
real he's right about like big Tech
 

6357
01:57:07,599 --> 01:57:09,430
real he's right about like big Tech
censorship me I think if he's right

6358
01:57:09,430 --> 01:57:09,440
censorship me I think if he's right
 

6359
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:10,950
censorship me I think if he's right
about anything it would probably be the

6360
01:57:10,950 --> 01:57:10,960
about anything it would probably be the
 

6361
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:13,109
about anything it would probably be the
heads of big Tech colluding together

6362
01:57:13,109 --> 01:57:13,119
heads of big Tech colluding together
 

6363
01:57:13,119 --> 01:57:15,109
heads of big Tech colluding together
across company lines to deplatform

6364
01:57:15,109 --> 01:57:15,119
across company lines to deplatform
 

6365
01:57:15,119 --> 01:57:17,589
across company lines to deplatform
certain people he's right about that uh

6366
01:57:17,589 --> 01:57:17,599
certain people he's right about that uh
 

6367
01:57:17,599 --> 01:57:19,830
certain people he's right about that uh
I think most of the things that he says

6368
01:57:19,830 --> 01:57:19,840
I think most of the things that he says
 

6369
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:21,709
I think most of the things that he says
follow the question everything narrative

6370
01:57:21,709 --> 01:57:21,719
follow the question everything narrative
 

6371
01:57:21,719 --> 01:57:23,870
follow the question everything narrative
and everything is kind of like a

6372
01:57:23,870 --> 01:57:23,880
and everything is kind of like a
 

6373
01:57:23,880 --> 01:57:25,790
and everything is kind of like a
conspiracy or like a plot or a false

6374
01:57:25,790 --> 01:57:25,800
conspiracy or like a plot or a false
 

6375
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:28,069
conspiracy or like a plot or a false
flag I think that he's built up a

6376
01:57:28,069 --> 01:57:28,079
flag I think that he's built up a
 

6377
01:57:28,079 --> 01:57:31,109
flag I think that he's built up a
following for so long that wants him to

6378
01:57:31,109 --> 01:57:31,119
following for so long that wants him to
 

6379
01:57:31,119 --> 01:57:32,990
following for so long that wants him to
do that you know so I think he'll

6380
01:57:32,990 --> 01:57:33,000
do that you know so I think he'll
 

6381
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:34,430
do that you know so I think he'll
question things that he probably thinks

6382
01:57:34,430 --> 01:57:34,440
question things that he probably thinks
 

6383
01:57:34,440 --> 01:57:36,830
question things that he probably thinks
are relatively straightforward because

6384
01:57:36,830 --> 01:57:36,840
are relatively straightforward because
 

6385
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:38,669
are relatively straightforward because
that's the Stick of the show I mean the

6386
01:57:38,669 --> 01:57:38,679
that's the Stick of the show I mean the
 

6387
01:57:38,679 --> 01:57:41,189
that's the Stick of the show I mean the
infowar is fighting misinformation and

6388
01:57:41,189 --> 01:57:41,199
infowar is fighting misinformation and
 

6389
01:57:41,199 --> 01:57:43,910
infowar is fighting misinformation and
people want to see him be that guy to so

6390
01:57:43,910 --> 01:57:43,920
people want to see him be that guy to so
 

6391
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:45,669
people want to see him be that guy to so
to a certain extent if you're a Creator

6392
01:57:45,669 --> 01:57:45,679
to a certain extent if you're a Creator
 

6393
01:57:45,679 --> 01:57:48,430
to a certain extent if you're a Creator
who supports your family you do follow

6394
01:57:48,430 --> 01:57:48,440
who supports your family you do follow
 

6395
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:50,589
who supports your family you do follow
economic incentives and people want you

6396
01:57:50,589 --> 01:57:50,599
economic incentives and people want you
 

6397
01:57:50,599 --> 01:57:52,510
economic incentives and people want you
to be the character and so you're going

6398
01:57:52,510 --> 01:57:52,520
to be the character and so you're going
 

6399
01:57:52,520 --> 01:57:54,350
to be the character and so you're going
to naturally gravitate toward being it

6400
01:57:54,350 --> 01:57:54,360
to naturally gravitate toward being it
 

6401

the
 

7811
02:24:48,479 --> 02:24:50,990
the
suicide so I tried to think of what's

suicide so I tried to think of what's
the way I can do it to get the least

02:24:53,309 --> 02:24:53,319
the way I can do it to get the least

02:24:54,309 --> 02:24:54,319
amount of
 

7817
02:24:54,319 --> 02:24:57,269
amount of
anger on behalf of the people who would

7818
02:24:57,269 --> 02:24:57,279

7823
02:25:02,160 --> 02:25:03,750
you so I figured drinking myself to
death would be the way to do

7824
02:25:03,750 --> 02:25:03,760
death would be the way to do
 

7825

02:27:53,590 --> 02:27:53,600
prior because even though it might sound
 

7965
02:27:53,600 --> 02:27:56,150
prior because even though it might sound
like a Vibe killer it's not and if you

7966
02:27:56,150 --> 02:27:56,160
like a Vibe killer it's not and if you
 

7967
02:27:56,160 --> 02:27:57,790
like a Vibe killer it's not and if you
think that that conversation is a Vibe

7968

think that that conversation is a Vibe
 

7969
02:27:57,800 --> 02:27:59,230
think that that conversation is a Vibe

killer you probably shouldn't be in that
situation in the first place especially

7972
02:28:01,429 --> 02:28:01,439
situation in the first place especially
 

7973
02:28:01,439 --> 02:28:03,870
situation in the first place especially
now how hypersexualized things are and

now how hypersexualized things are and
 

7975

02:28:06,309 --> 02:28:06,319
how common that type of violence is you
 

7977
02:28:06,319 --> 02:28:07,349
how common that type of violence is you
need to be able to have those

7978
02:28:07,349 --> 02:28:07,359
need to be able to have those

partner to you and I'm sure that college

7988
02:28:15,870 --> 02:28:15,880
partner to you and I'm sure that college
 

7989
02:28:15,880 --> 02:28:17,110
partner to you and I'm sure that college
age people are not having those

7990
02:28:17,110 --> 02:28:17,120
age people are not having those
 

7991
02:28:17,120 --> 02:28:18,990
age people are not having those
conversations but I'm sure that it would

7992
02:28:18,990 --> 02:28:19,000
conversations but I'm sure that it would
 

7993
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,429
conversations but I'm sure that it would
go a long way

7994
02:28:21,429 --> 02:28:21,439
go a long way
 

7995
02:28:21,439 --> 02:28:23,790
go a long way
so especially when you're young college

7996
02:28:23,790 --> 02:28:23,800
so especially when you're young college
 

7997
02:28:23,800 --> 02:28:25,950
so especially when you're young college
aged you don't have enough experience to

7998
02:28:25,950 --> 02:28:25,960
aged you don't have enough experience to
 

7999
02:28:25,960 --> 02:28:27,550
aged you don't have enough experience to
be able to read a person without having

8000
02:28:27,550 --> 02:28:27,560
be able to read a person without having
 

8001
02:28:27,560 --> 02:28:29,389
be able to read a person without having
that conversation cuz a lot of times you

8002
02:28:29,389 --> 02:28:29,399
that conversation cuz a lot of times you
 

8003
02:28:29,399 --> 02:28:31,670
that conversation cuz a lot of times you
can see the trauma without explicitly

8004
02:28:31,670 --> 02:28:31,680
can see the trauma without explicitly
 

8005
02:28:31,680 --> 02:28:32,990
can see the trauma without explicitly
talking about it but that takes

8006
02:28:32,990 --> 02:28:33,000
talking about it but that takes
 

8007
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:34,790
talking about it but that takes
experience and knowledge and seeing the

8008
02:28:34,790 --> 02:28:34,800
experience and knowledge and seeing the
 

8009
02:28:34,800 --> 02:28:36,429
experience and knowledge and seeing the
world when you're young and you don't

8010
02:28:36,429 --> 02:28:36,439
world when you're young and you don't
 

8011
02:28:36,439 --> 02:28:38,870
world when you're young and you don't
know you really don't know shit making

8012
02:28:38,870 --> 02:28:38,880
know you really don't know shit making
 

8013
02:28:38,880 --> 02:28:41,309
know you really don't know shit making
things a bit more explicit is probably

8014
02:28:41,309 --> 02:28:41,319
things a bit more explicit is probably
 

8015
02:28:41,319 --> 02:28:43,830
things a bit more explicit is probably
better yeah and also like as men were

8016
02:28:43,830 --> 02:28:43,840
better yeah and also like as men were
 

8017
02:28:43,840 --> 02:28:46,269
better yeah and also like as men were
trained to believe that it's our duty to

8018
02:28:46,269 --> 02:28:46,279
trained to believe that it's our duty to
 

8019
02:28:46,279 --> 02:28:48,630
trained to believe that it's our duty to
be the initiatory party in any type of

8020
02:28:48,630 --> 02:28:48,640
be the initiatory party in any type of
 

8021
02:28:48,640 --> 02:28:50,990
be the initiatory party in any type of
like sexual encounter like oh like man

8022
02:28:50,990 --> 02:28:51,000
like sexual encounter like oh like man
 

8023
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:52,910
like sexual encounter like oh like man
chases woman you know what I mean like

8024
02:28:52,910 --> 02:28:52,920
chases woman you know what I mean like
 

8025
02:28:52,920 --> 02:28:54,389
chases woman you know what I mean like
you know you have to be the one to make

8026
02:28:54,389 --> 02:28:54,399
you know you have to be the one to make
 

8027
02:28:54,399 --> 02:28:55,990
you know you have to be the one to make
the move and or like she's playing hard

8028
02:28:55,990 --> 02:28:56,000
the move and or like she's playing hard
 

8029
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,230
the move and or like she's playing hard
to get if you know she's resistant to

8030
02:28:58,230 --> 02:28:58,240
to get if you know she's resistant to
 

8031
02:28:58,240 --> 02:29:00,990
to get if you know she's resistant to
your first like compliment or something

8032
02:29:00,990 --> 02:29:01,000
your first like compliment or something
 

8033
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,389
your first like compliment or something
I think that that's not always how it

8034
02:29:03,389 --> 02:29:03,399
I think that that's not always how it
 

8035
02:29:03,399 --> 02:29:05,790
I think that that's not always how it
has to be and that extra caution needs

8036
02:29:05,790 --> 02:29:05,800
has to be and that extra caution needs
 

8037
02:29:05,800 --> 02:29:07,030
has to be and that extra caution needs
to be placed if you're taking the

8038
02:29:07,030 --> 02:29:07,040
to be placed if you're taking the
 

8039
02:29:07,040 --> 02:29:08,670
to be placed if you're taking the
initiatory role in an interaction

8040
02:29:08,670 --> 02:29:08,680
initiatory role in an interaction
 

8041
02:29:08,680 --> 02:29:10,070
initiatory role in an interaction
especially if someone has a traumatic

8042
02:29:10,070 --> 02:29:10,080
especially if someone has a traumatic
 

8043
02:29:10,080 --> 02:29:12,630
especially if someone has a traumatic
background they might agree to do

8044
02:29:12,630 --> 02:29:12,640
background they might agree to do
 

8045
02:29:12,640 --> 02:29:13,790
background they might agree to do
something with you because they're

8046
02:29:13,790 --> 02:29:13,800
something with you because they're
 

8047
02:29:13,800 --> 02:29:15,469
something with you because they're
scared and you might not realize that's

8048
02:29:15,469 --> 02:29:15,479
scared and you might not realize that's
 

8049
02:29:15,479 --> 02:29:17,110
scared and you might not realize that's
what's going on but because you don't

8050
02:29:17,110 --> 02:29:17,120
what's going on but because you don't
 

8051

what's going on but because you don't
you don't see yourself as a predatory

8052
02:29:18,670 --> 02:29:18,680
you don't see yourself as a predatory
 

8053
02:29:18,680 --> 02:29:20,190
you don't see yourself as a predatory
person you don't see yourself as someone

intelligent alien civilization in our
 

8867

02:45:19,070 --> 02:45:19,080
likely um to the degree it's real it's
 

8881
02:45:19,080 --> 02:45:21,630
likely um to the degree it's real it's
much more likely government projects so

02:45:26,190 --> 02:45:26,200
so you think that they have knowledge of
 

8887
02:45:26,200 --> 02:45:29,190
so you think that they have knowledge of
it yeah yeah one thing I think about

8888
02:45:29,190 --> 02:45:29,200
it yeah yeah one thing I think about
 

8889
02:45:29,200 --> 02:45:31,670
it yeah yeah one thing I think about
with aliens is scale so we have this

8890
02:45:31,670 --> 02:45:31,680
with aliens is scale so we have this
 

8891
02:45:31,680 --> 02:45:34,349
with aliens is scale so we have this
idea that uh an alien would be a gray

8892
02:45:34,349 --> 02:45:34,359
idea that uh an alien would be a gray
 

8893
02:45:34,359 --> 02:45:36,550
idea that uh an alien would be a gray
alien or a almost humanoid lookalike

8894
02:45:36,550 --> 02:45:36,560
alien or a almost humanoid lookalike
 

8895
02:45:36,560 --> 02:45:38,950
alien or a almost humanoid lookalike
that would visit us in human form arms

8896
02:45:38,950 --> 02:45:38,960
that would visit us in human form arms
 

8897
02:45:38,960 --> 02:45:41,190
that would visit us in human form arms
legs head but who's to say that they're

8898
02:45:41,190 --> 02:45:41,200
legs head but who's to say that they're
 

8899
02:45:41,200 --> 02:45:42,990
legs head but who's to say that they're
not able to shrink down to microscopic

8900
02:45:42,990 --> 02:45:43,000
not able to shrink down to microscopic
 

8901
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,870
not able to shrink down to microscopic
size with the same neural capacity yeah

8902
02:45:45,870 --> 02:45:45,880
size with the same neural capacity yeah
 

8903
02:45:45,880 --> 02:45:47,670
size with the same neural capacity yeah
or just have a very difficult to

8904
02:45:47,670 --> 02:45:47,680
or just have a very difficult to
 

8905
02:45:47,680 --> 02:45:50,070
or just have a very difficult to
perceive form but I mean that they would

8906
02:45:50,070 --> 02:45:50,080
perceive form but I mean that they would
 

8907
02:45:50,080 --> 02:45:52,910
perceive form but I mean that they would
go small not big no I think that would

8908
02:45:52,910 --> 02:45:52,920
go small not big no I think that would
 

8909
02:45:52,920 --> 02:45:54,710
go small not big no I think that would
take a humanoid like form just to be

8910
02:45:54,710 --> 02:45:54,720
take a humanoid like form just to be
 

8911
02:45:54,720 --> 02:45:56,469
take a humanoid like form just to be
able to communicate with humans I think

8912
02:45:56,469 --> 02:45:56,479
able to communicate with humans I think
 

8913
02:45:56,479 --> 02:45:57,870
able to communicate with humans I think
that the the the big challenge with

8914
02:45:57,870 --> 02:45:57,880
that the the the big challenge with
 

8915
02:45:57,880 --> 02:45:59,590
that the the the big challenge with
aliens is to be able to find a Common

8916
02:45:59,590 --> 02:45:59,600
aliens is to be able to find a Common
 

8917
02:45:59,600 --> 02:46:01,630
aliens is to be able to find a Common
Language so if you come to another

8918
02:46:01,630 --> 02:46:01,640
Language so if you come to another
 

8919
02:46:01,640 --> 02:46:03,590
Language so if you come to another
planet and you suspect that there's some

8920
02:46:03,590 --> 02:46:03,600
planet and you suspect that there's some
 

8921
02:46:03,600 --> 02:46:05,870
planet and you suspect that there's some
kind of complexity going on but it looks

8922
02:46:05,870 --> 02:46:05,880
kind of complexity going on but it looks
 

8923
02:46:05,880 --> 02:46:08,030
kind of complexity going on but it looks
nothing like humans you have to find a

8924
02:46:08,030 --> 02:46:08,040
nothing like humans you have to find a
 

8925
02:46:08,040 --> 02:46:10,990
nothing like humans you have to find a
Common Language mhm and I think aliens

8926
02:46:10,990 --> 02:46:11,000

Common Language mhm and I think aliens
would try to take physical form that's

8928
