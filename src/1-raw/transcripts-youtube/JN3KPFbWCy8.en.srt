interesting strategy
 

181
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,830
interesting strategy
for interaction some it's happened to

182
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:02,840
for interaction some it's happened to
 

183

for interaction some it's happened to
people it's un unfortunate like that's I

people it's un unfortunate like that's I
 

185
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:07,270
people it's un unfortunate like that's I
guess a one way to ensure that the other

186
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,280
guess a one way to ensure that the other

answer
 

239
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,870
answer
um what my this strictly my opinion of

240
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:14,880
um what my this strictly my opinion of
 

241
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,510
um what my this strictly my opinion of
you know is that

242
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:18,520

 

243
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,350

uh the the goal of Hamas was to provoke

244
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:22,360
uh the the goal of Hamas was to provoke
 

245
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,870
uh the the goal of Hamas was to provoke
an overreaction from Israel um they

an overreaction from Israel um they
 

247
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,350
an overreaction from Israel um they
obviously did not expect to uh you know

248
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:27,360
obviously did not expect to uh you know
 

249
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,990
obviously did not expect to uh you know
have a military Victory um but they

250
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,000
have a military Victory um but they
 

251
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,870
have a military Victory um but they
they expect they really wanted

252
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:31,880
they expect they really wanted
 

253
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,270
they expect they really wanted
to commit the worst atrocities that they

254
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:34,280
to commit the worst atrocities that they
 

255
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,550
to commit the worst atrocities that they
could in order to provoke the the most

256
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:38,560
could in order to provoke the the most
 

257
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,110
could in order to provoke the the most
aggressive response possible from Israel

258
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,120
aggressive response possible from Israel
 

259
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,749
aggressive response possible from Israel
um and then leverage that aggressive

260
00:05:44,749 --> 00:05:44,759
um and then leverage that aggressive
 

261
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:50,749
um and then leverage that aggressive
response to um rally Muslims worldwide

262
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:50,759
response to um rally Muslims worldwide
 

263

Palestine which they have succeeded in
doing um so the this the the

268
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:01,639
doing um so the this the the
 

269
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:03,230
doing um so the this the the
counterintuitive thing here I think that

270
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:03,240
counterintuitive thing here I think that
 

271
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,510
counterintuitive thing here I think that
the the thing that I think should be

272
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:04,520
the the thing that I think should be
 

273
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,830
the the thing that I think should be
done even though it is very difficult uh

274
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:06,840
done even though it is very difficult uh
 

275
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,550
done even though it is very difficult uh
is that um I I would recommend that

276
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:09,560
is that um I I would recommend that
 

277
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,550
is that um I I would recommend that
Israel engage in the most cons

278
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:11,560
Israel engage in the most cons
 

279
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,110
Israel engage in the most cons
conspicuous acts of kindness possible

280

every everything that is the actual
 

283
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,230
every everything that is the actual
thing that would th the goal ofas so in

284
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:20,240
thing that would th the goal ofas so in
 

285
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,950
thing that would th the goal ofas so in
some sense the degree that makes sense

286
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:22,960
some sense the degree that makes sense
 

287
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,309
some sense the degree that makes sense
in geopolitics turn the other cheek

288
00:06:25,309 --> 00:06:25,319
in geopolitics turn the other cheek
 

289
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,469
in geopolitics turn the other cheek
implemented it's not exactly turn the

290
00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:27,479
implemented it's not exactly turn the
 

291
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:29,029
implemented it's not exactly turn the
other cheek um because I do think that

292
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:29,039
other cheek um because I do think that
 

293
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,390
other cheek um because I do think that
there's

294
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:31,400
there's
 

295
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,390
there's
um you know I think it is appropriate

296
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,400
um you know I think it is appropriate
 

297
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,469
um you know I think it is appropriate
for Israel

298
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:36,479
for Israel
 

299
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,150
for Israel
to find the Hamas members and you know

how many did you create mhm and if you
create more than you killed you've not

386
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:36,120
create more than you killed you've not
 

387

389
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,709
succeeded that's the you know the real
situation there um and it's safe to say

390
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:40,719
situation there um and it's safe to say
 

391
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:46,310
situation there um and it's safe to say
that if you know

392
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:46,320

 

393
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,630

Israeli that's the situation
 

405
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,269
Israeli that's the situation
so but but I mean this is one of the

406
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:09,279
so but but I mean this is one of the
 

407
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,750
so but but I mean this is one of the
most contentious subjects one could

408
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:11,760
most contentious subjects one could
 

409
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,990
most contentious subjects one could
possibly discuss but but I think if if

410
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,000
possibly discuss but but I think if if
 

411
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,069
possibly discuss but but I think if if
the if the goal ultimate is some sort of

412
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:16,079
the if the goal ultimate is some sort of
 

413
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:18,590
the if the goal ultimate is some sort of
long-term piece one has to be look at

414
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:18,600
long-term piece one has to be look at
 

415
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,949
long-term piece one has to be look at
this from standpoint of over time are

416
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:21,959
this from standpoint of over time are
 

417
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:25,670
this from standpoint of over time are
there more or fewer um terrorists being

War this question of just how much war

434
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:43,519
War this question of just how much war
 

435
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,269
War this question of just how much war
and and um you know what you know

436
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:46,279
and and um you know what you know
 

437
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:48,110
and and um you know what you know
there's this there's sort of the scope

438
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:48,120
there's this there's sort of the scope
 

439
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,590
there's this there's sort of the scope
and scale of War but to to imagine that

440
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:51,600
and scale of War but to to imagine that
 

441
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,710
and scale of War but to to imagine that
there would not be any war in the future

442
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:52,720
there would not be any war in the future
 

443
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,630
there would not be any war in the future
I think would be very unlikely outcome

444
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:55,640
I think would be very unlikely outcome
 

445
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,110
I think would be very unlikely outcome
yeah you talked about the culture series

446
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
yeah you talked about the culture series
 

447
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,710
yeah you talked about the culture series

War the first book starts off with a

450
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:02,519
War the first book starts off with a
 

451
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,590
War the first book starts off with a
gigantic Galactic War where trillions

452
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:05,600
gigantic Galactic War where trillions
 

453
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,150
gigantic Galactic War where trillions
die trillions but it still nevertheless

454
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,160
die trillions but it still nevertheless
 

455
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,230
die trillions but it still nevertheless
protects these pockets of of

456
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:11,240
protects these pockets of of
 

457
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,509
protects these pockets of of
flourishing some somehow you can have

458
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:13,519
flourishing some somehow you can have
 

459
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,949
flourishing some somehow you can have
Galactic war and still have pockets of

460
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:16,959
Galactic war and still have pockets of
 

461
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,190
Galactic war and still have pockets of
flourishing yeah I mean it's I guess if

462
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:20,200
flourishing yeah I mean it's I guess if
 

463
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,430
flourishing yeah I mean it's I guess if
we are able to one day expand to you

464
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:23,440
we are able to one day expand to you
 

465
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,630
we are able to one day expand to you

know full the Galaxy or whatever there
 

467
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,710

will be a galactic War at some point ah

468
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:30,720
will be a galactic War at some point ah

been increasing increasing increasing
it's like a race between the scale of

474
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:36,880
it's like a race between the scale of
 

475
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,670
it's like a race between the scale of
suffering in the scale of flourishing

and uh he would have died too um except
 

521
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,269
and uh he would have died too um except
they randomly gave some I guess IQ tests

522
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:35,279
they randomly gave some I guess IQ tests
 

523
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,069
they randomly gave some I guess IQ tests
or something and uh he scored very high

524
00:11:39,069 --> 00:11:39,079
or something and uh he scored very high
 

525
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:40,949
or something and uh he scored very high
um now he was not an officer he was a I

think a Corporal or a sergeant or
 

529
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,949
think a Corporal or a sergeant or
something like that um because he didn't

530
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:43,959
something like that um because he didn't
 

531
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:46,069
something like that um because he didn't
finish High School um he had to drop out

539
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,829
um siblings um so because he didn't
graduate high school he was not eligible

581
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:49,670
died you know 20 years ago or longer
actually 30 years ago

582
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:49,680
actually 30 years ago
 

583
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,590
actually 30 years ago
um how many people are alive that

584

remember World War II not many and the
 

587
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,230
remember World War II not many and the
same perhaps applies to the threat of

588
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:57,240
same perhaps applies to the threat of
 

589
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,150
same perhaps applies to the threat of
nuclear war

590
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:01,160

 

591
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,389

yeah I mean there are enough nuclear

592
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:02,399
yeah I mean there are enough nuclear
 

593
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,710
yeah I mean there are enough nuclear
bombs pointed at United States to make

594
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:05,720
bombs pointed at United States to make
 

595
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,990

the reubel the radio active Revel bounce

596
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,000
the reubel the radio active Revel bounce
 

597
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,509
the reubel the radio active Revel bounce
many

598
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:09,519
many
 

599
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,829
many
times there's two major Wars going on

600
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:12,839
times there's two major Wars going on
 

601
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:15,629
times there's two major Wars going on
right now so you talked about the threat

602
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:15,639
right now so you talked about the threat
 

603
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:19,670
right now so you talked about the threat
of AGI quite a bit but now as we sit

604
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:19,680
of AGI quite a bit but now as we sit
 

605
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,310
of AGI quite a bit but now as we sit
here with the intensity of conflict

606
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:21,320
here with the intensity of conflict
 

607
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,509
here with the intensity of conflict
going on do you worry about nuclear

608
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:24,519
going on do you worry about nuclear
 

609
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:26,710
going on do you worry about nuclear
war I think we shouldn't discount the

610
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:26,720
war I think we shouldn't discount the
 

611
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,629
war I think we shouldn't discount the
possibility of nuclear war um it is a

612
00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:29,639
possibility of nuclear war um it is a
 

613
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:30,990
possibility of nuclear war um it is a
civilizational

614
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:31,000
civilizational
 

615
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,189
civilizational
threat

616
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:35,199

 

617
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:38,350

um right now I could be wrong but I

618
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:38,360
um right now I could be wrong but I
 

619
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,550
um right now I could be wrong but I
think the the current probability of

620
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:40,560
think the the current probability of
 

621
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,949
think the the current probability of
nuclear war is quite low um but there

622
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:43,959
nuclear war is quite low um but there
 

623
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:47,350
nuclear war is quite low um but there
are a lot of nukes pointed at us so and

624
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:47,360
are a lot of nukes pointed at us so and
 

625
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,150
are a lot of nukes pointed at us so and
we have a lot of nukes pointed at other

626
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:49,160
we have a lot of nukes pointed at other
 

627
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,110
we have a lot of nukes pointed at other
people they're still there nobody's put

628
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:52,120
people they're still there nobody's put
 

629
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,350
people they're still there nobody's put
their uh their guns

630
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:54,360
their uh their guns
 

631
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,590
their uh their guns
away the missiles are still in the silos

632
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:57,600
away the missiles are still in the silos
 

633
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,710
away the missiles are still in the silos
and uh the leaders don't seem to be the

634
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:00,720
and uh the leaders don't seem to be the
 

635
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,230
and uh the leaders don't seem to be the
ones with the nukes talking to each

636
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:02,240
ones with the nukes talking to each
 

637
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,310
ones with the nukes talking to each
other no there are Wars which are tragic

638
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:06,320
other no there are Wars which are tragic
 

639
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,550
other no there are Wars which are tragic
and difficult on a on a local basis and

640
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:08,560

won't be super popular after that as

well they're like you got to into this

00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:45,079
well they're like you got to into this

how do you hope the war in Ukraine comes

684
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:01,800
how do you hope the war in Ukraine comes
 

685
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,990
how do you hope the war in Ukraine comes
to an end and what's the path once again

686
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:04,000
to an end and what's the path once again
 

687
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,629
to an end and what's the path once again
to minimizing human suffering

688
00:15:07,629 --> 00:15:07,639

 

689
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:09,870

there uh well I think

690
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:09,880
there uh well I think
 

691
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,350
there uh well I think
that what what is likely to happen uh

692
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:13,360
that what what is likely to happen uh
 

693
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,550
that what what is likely to happen uh
which is really pretty much the the way

694
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:16,560
which is really pretty much the the way
 

695
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,430
which is really pretty much the the way
it is is that um something very close to

696
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:20,440
it is is that um something very close to
 

697
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,350
it is is that um something very close to
the

698
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:21,360
the
 

699
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,629
the
current lines uh will

700
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:24,639
current lines uh will
 

701
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,430
current lines uh will
be how a ceasefire or truce

702
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:29,440
be how a ceasefire or truce
 

703
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,949
be how a ceasefire or truce
happens

704
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:30,959
happens
 

705
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,509
happens
but you know you just have a situation

706
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:33,519
but you know you just have a situation
 

707
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,590
but you know you just have a situation
right now where whoever goes on the

708
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:34,600
right now where whoever goes on the
 

709
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,910
right now where whoever goes on the
offensive um will suffer casualties at

710
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:37,920
offensive um will suffer casualties at
 

711
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,389
offensive um will suffer casualties at
several times the rate of whoever's on

712
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:39,399
several times the rate of whoever's on
 

713
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:42,790
several times the rate of whoever's on
the defense um because you've got uh

714
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:42,800
the defense um because you've got uh
 

715
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,990
the defense um because you've got uh
defense and depth you got minefields uh

716
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:45,000
defense and depth you got minefields uh
 

717
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,269
defense and depth you got minefields uh
trenches anti-tank defenses um nobody

718
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:48,279
trenches anti-tank defenses um nobody
 

719
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:51,110
trenches anti-tank defenses um nobody
has air superiority um because the the

720
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:51,120
has air superiority um because the the
 

721
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,990
has air superiority um because the the
anti-aircraft missiles are really far

722
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,000
anti-aircraft missiles are really far
 

723
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,749
anti-aircraft missiles are really far
better than the the aircraft like they

724
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:55,759
better than the the aircraft like they
 

725
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,110
better than the the aircraft like they
far more of them um and and uh so

726
00:15:59,110 --> 00:15:59,120
far more of them um and and uh so
 

727
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,990
far more of them um and and uh so
neither side has air superiority um

728
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,000
neither side has air superiority um
 

729
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,269
neither side has air superiority um
tanks are basically death drafts um just

730
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:05,279
tanks are basically death drafts um just
 

731
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,030
tanks are basically death drafts um just
slow moving and they're not immune to

732
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:08,040
slow moving and they're not immune to
 

733
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,829
slow moving and they're not immune to
anti-tank weapons so you you really just

734
00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:10,839
anti-tank weapons so you you really just
 

735
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:13,990
anti-tank weapons so you you really just
have longrange artillery um

736
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:14,000
have longrange artillery um
 

737
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,910
have longrange artillery um
and uh infantry trenches it's World War

738
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:17,920
and uh infantry trenches it's World War
 

739
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,069
and uh infantry trenches it's World War
One all over again

740
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:20,079
One all over again
 

741
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,629
One all over again
mhm with drones you know throwing little

742
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:22,639
mhm with drones you know throwing little
 

743
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,309
mhm with drones you know throwing little
drone some some drones there um which

744
00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:25,319
drone some some drones there um which
 

745
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:26,990
drone some some drones there um which
makes the long range artillery just that

746
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:27,000
makes the long range artillery just that
 

747
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,350
makes the long range artillery just that
much more accurate and better and so

748
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:29,360
much more accurate and better and so
 

749
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,829
much more accurate and better and so
more efficient murdering people on both

750
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:31,839
more efficient murdering people on both
 

751
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:37,030
more efficient murdering people on both
sides mhm yeah so it's whoever is you

752
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,040
sides mhm yeah so it's whoever is you
 

753
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,030
sides mhm yeah so it's whoever is you
don't you don't you don't want to be

754
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:38,040
don't you don't you don't want to be
 

755
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,790
don't you don't you don't want to be
trying to advance from either side

756
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:39,800
trying to advance from either side
 

757
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,230
trying to advance from either side
because the probability of dying is

758
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:41,240
because the probability of dying is
 

759
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,470
because the probability of dying is
incredibly High um so in order to

760
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:45,480
incredibly High um so in order to
 

761
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,150
incredibly High um so in order to
overcome

762
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,160
overcome
 

763
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,069
overcome
uh defense and depth trenches and

764
00:16:51,069 --> 00:16:51,079
uh defense and depth trenches and
 

765
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:53,309
uh defense and depth trenches and
minefields you really need uh

766
00:16:53,309 --> 00:16:53,319
minefields you really need uh
 

767
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:57,749
minefields you really need uh
significant local superiority numbers um

768
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:57,759
significant local superiority numbers um
 

769
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,990

um and a lot of people that's the only

778
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:10,360
um and a lot of people that's the only
 

779
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,270
um and a lot of people that's the only
way you're going to punch through a line

780
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:12,280
way you're going to punch through a line
 

781
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,270
way you're going to punch through a line
and then you got to punch through and

782
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:14,280
and then you got to punch through and
 

783
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,710
and then you got to punch through and
and and then not have reinforcements

784
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:17,720
and and then not have reinforcements
 

785
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,870
and and then not have reinforcements
just kick you right out again I mean I I

rough
 

795
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,990
rough
um I mean the sheer number of people

796
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,000
um I mean the sheer number of people
 

797
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,190
um I mean the sheer number of people
that died there was

798
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:36,200
that died there was
 

799
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,230
that died there was
mindboggling and it's almost impossible

800
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:38,240
mindboggling and it's almost impossible
 

801
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,029
mindboggling and it's almost impossible
to um imagine the end of it that doesn't

803
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,669

grew stronger and stronger with each
passing

990
00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:36,919
passing
 

991
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:39,909
passing
year and um and everyone's like well

992
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:39,919
year and um and everyone's like well
 

993
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,230
year and um and everyone's like well
that's inevitable that there's going to

994
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:41,240
that's inevitable that there's going to
 

995
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,870
that's inevitable that there's going to
be a clash between Athens and

996
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:43,880
be a clash between Athens and
 

997

they couldn't they couldn't they

1000
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:47,880
they couldn't they couldn't they
 

1001
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,590
they couldn't they couldn't they
actually they saw it coming and they

1002
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:49,600
actually they saw it coming and they
 

1003
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,149
actually they saw it coming and they
still could not avoid

1004
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:52,159
still could not avoid
 

1005
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,070
still could not avoid
it so you know at some point if there's

1006
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,080
it so you know at some point if there's
 

1007
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,830
it so you know at some point if there's
if if one uh

1008
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:58,840
if if one uh
 

1009
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,269
if if one uh
group one civilization or or country or

1010
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:01,279
group one civilization or or country or
 

1011
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:03,510
group one civilization or or country or
whatever

1012
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:03,520
whatever
 

1013
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,190
whatever
um exceeds another sort of like if you

1014
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:07,200
um exceeds another sort of like if you
 

1015
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,110
um exceeds another sort of like if you
know the United States has been the

1016
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:08,120
know the United States has been the
 

1017
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,430
know the United States has been the
biggest kid on the Block for since I

1018
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:10,440
biggest kid on the Block for since I
 

1019
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,549
biggest kid on the Block for since I
think around 1890 from an economic

1020
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:13,559
think around 1890 from an economic
 

1021
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:16,510
think around 1890 from an economic
standpoint so the United States has been

1022
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:16,520
standpoint so the United States has been
 

1023
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,950
standpoint so the United States has been
the economic most powerful economic

1024
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:19,960
the economic most powerful economic
 

1025
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,110
the economic most powerful economic
engine in the world longer than anyone's

1026
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,120
engine in the world longer than anyone's
 

1027
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,430
engine in the world longer than anyone's
been

1028
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:24,440
been
 

1029
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,950
been
alive

1030
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:26,960
alive
 

1031
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,590
alive
um and the foundation of war is

1032
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:30,600
um and the foundation of war is
 

1033
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,630
um and the foundation of war is
economics

1034
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:33,640

 

1035
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,510

so now we have a situation in the case

1036
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:36,520
so now we have a situation in the case
 

1037
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:40,430
so now we have a situation in the case
of china where the um the economy is

1038
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:40,440
of china where the um the economy is
 

1039
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,990
of china where the um the economy is
likely to be two perhaps three times

1040
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:44,000
likely to be two perhaps three times
 

1041
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,310
likely to be two perhaps three times
larger than that of the US so imagine

1042
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:46,320
larger than that of the US so imagine
 

1043
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,029
larger than that of the US so imagine
you're the biggest kid on the Block for

1044
00:22:48,029 --> 00:22:48,039
you're the biggest kid on the Block for
 

1045
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:49,630
you're the biggest kid on the Block for
as long as anyone can remember and

1046
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:49,640
as long as anyone can remember and
 

1047
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,149
as long as anyone can remember and
suddenly a kid comes along who's twice

1048
00:22:51,149 --> 00:22:51,159
suddenly a kid comes along who's twice
 

1049
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:54,669
suddenly a kid comes along who's twice
your

1050
00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:54,679

 

1051
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:58,230

size so we see it coming yeah how's the

1052
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:58,240
size so we see it coming yeah how's the
 

1053
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,669
size so we see it coming yeah how's the
possible to stop is there some let me

1054
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:01,679
possible to stop is there some let me
 

1055
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:02,909
possible to stop is there some let me
throw something out there just

1056
00:23:02,909 --> 00:23:02,919
throw something out there just
 

1057
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:06,029
throw something out there just
intermixing of cultures understanding

1058
00:23:06,029 --> 00:23:06,039
intermixing of cultures understanding
 

1059
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:07,710
intermixing of cultures understanding
there does seem to be a giant cultural

1060
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:07,720
there does seem to be a giant cultural
 

1061
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,830
there does seem to be a giant cultural
Gap in understanding of each other and

1062
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:09,840
Gap in understanding of each other and
 

1063
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,630
Gap in understanding of each other and
you're an interesting case study because

1064
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:11,640
you're an interesting case study because
 

1065
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,190
you're an interesting case study because
you are an American obviously you've

1066

internally focused um they've not been

1148
00:25:01,549 --> 00:25:01,559
internally focused um they've not been
 

1149
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:04,470
internally focused um they've not been
acquisitive uh they've they fought each

1150
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:04,480
acquisitive uh they've they fought each
 

1151
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,110

other they've been many many Civil Wars
 

1153
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,630

um in the Three Kingdoms War I believe

1154
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:09,640
um in the Three Kingdoms War I believe
 

1155
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,909
um in the Three Kingdoms War I believe
they lost about 70% of their

1156
00:25:12,909 --> 00:25:12,919
they lost about 70% of their
 

1157
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:17,070
they lost about 70% of their
population so and so the they've had

1158
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:17,080
population so and so the they've had
 

1159
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,269
population so and so the they've had
brutal internal Wars like civil wars

1160
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:20,279
brutal internal Wars like civil wars
 

1161
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:22,549
brutal internal Wars like civil wars
that make the US Civil War

1162
00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:22,559
that make the US Civil War
 

1163
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,389
that make the US Civil War
look small by

00:25:25,389 --> 00:25:25,399
look small by
 

1165
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:28,789
look small by
comparison um

1166
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:28,799
comparison um
 

1167
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,909
comparison um
so I think it's important to appreciate

1168
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:30,919
so I think it's important to appreciate
 

1169
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:33,470
so I think it's important to appreciate
that China is not

1170
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:33,480
that China is not
 

1171
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,830
that China is not
monolithic um we sort think of like

1172
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:35,840
monolithic um we sort think of like
 

1173
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,149

1177
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,149
mind and this is definitely not the case
um from what I've seen and I think most

1178
00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:46,159

1179
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,110
um from what I've seen and I think most

that people in China think about China
 

1183
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,630
that people in China think about China
10 times more than they think about

00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:48,480
Sherlock they I think his brother found
 

1329
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,029
Sherlock they I think his brother found
like a a bicycle or something and um and

1330
00:28:52,029 --> 00:28:52,039
like a a bicycle or something and um and
 

1331
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:54,230
like a a bicycle or something and um and
then just cycled West as fast as he

1332
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:54,240
then just cycled West as fast as he
 

1333

then just cycled West as fast as he
could and found found a US Patrol um so

1334

could and found found a US Patrol um so
 

1335
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,310
could and found found a US Patrol um so
anyway that's that's one that's one way

1336
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:01,320
anyway that's that's one that's one way
 

1337
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,070
anyway that's that's one that's one way
you can

1338
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:02,080
you can
 

1339
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,789
you can
tell morality is who who where do you

1340
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:04,799
tell morality is who who where do you
 

1341
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:05,950
tell morality is who who where do you
want to be a

1342
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:05,960
want to be a
 

1343
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,590
want to be a
PW it's not fun anywhere but some places

1344
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:08,600
PW it's not fun anywhere but some places
 

1345
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,990
PW it's not fun anywhere but some places
are much worse than others

1346
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:11,000
are much worse than others
 

1347
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,750
are much worse than others
so um anyway so so so like America has

1348
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:13,760
so um anyway so so so like America has
 

1349
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,549
so um anyway so so so like America has
been uh while far from perfect uh

1350
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:17,559
been uh while far from perfect uh
 

1351
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:22,630
been uh while far from perfect uh
generally a benevolent Force um and uh

1352
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:22,640
generally a benevolent Force um and uh
 

1353
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,149
generally a benevolent Force um and uh
we should always be self-critical and uh

1354
00:29:25,149 --> 00:29:25,159
we should always be self-critical and uh
 

1355
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:29,549
we should always be self-critical and uh
try to be better um but um anyone with

1356
00:29:29,549 --> 00:29:29,559
try to be better um but um anyone with
 

1357
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:32,950
try to be better um but um anyone with
half right knows that so so I think

1358
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:32,960
half right knows that so so I think
 

1359
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,269
half right knows that so so I think
there are in this way China and uh the

1360
00:29:36,269 --> 00:29:36,279
there are in this way China and uh the
 

1361
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:38,110
there are in this way China and uh the
United States are similar NE neither

1362
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:38,120
United States are similar NE neither
 

1363
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,789
United States are similar NE neither
country has been

1364
00:29:39,789 --> 00:29:39,799
country has been
 

1365
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:42,870
country has been
inquisitive um in a significant way so

1366
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:42,880
inquisitive um in a significant way so
 

1367
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,029
inquisitive um in a significant way so
that's like a you know a shared

1368
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:45,039
that's like a you know a shared
 

1369
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,830
that's like a you know a shared
principle I guess um now now China does

1370
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:47,840
principle I guess um now now China does
 

1371
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,750
principle I guess um now now China does
feel very strongly about

1372
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:50,760
feel very strongly about
 

1373
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,590
feel very strongly about
Taiwan they've been very clear about

1374
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:53,600
Taiwan they've been very clear about
 

1375
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,230
Taiwan they've been very clear about
that for a long time um you know from

1376
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:56,240
that for a long time um you know from
 

1377
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,870
that for a long time um you know from
their standpoint it's it's it would be

1378
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:57,880
their standpoint it's it's it would be
 

1379
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:02,269
their standpoint it's it's it would be
like one of the states is is is you know

1380
00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:02,279
like one of the states is is is you know
 

1381
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:04,430
like one of the states is is is you know
not there like like Hawaii or something

1382
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:04,440
not there like like Hawaii or something
 

1383
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,269
not there like like Hawaii or something
like that but but more significant than

1384
00:30:06,269 --> 00:30:06,279
like that but but more significant than
 

1385
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:08,990
like that but but more significant than
Hawaii you know

1386
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:09,000
Hawaii you know
 

1387
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,190
Hawaii you know
um and Hawaii is pretty significant for

1388
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:11,200
um and Hawaii is pretty significant for
 

1389
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,509
um and Hawaii is pretty significant for
us so um they view it as as as really

1390
00:30:16,509 --> 00:30:16,519
us so um they view it as as as really
 

1391
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:19,509
us so um they view it as as as really
the there's a fundamental part of

1392
00:30:19,509 --> 00:30:19,519
the there's a fundamental part of
 

1393
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:23,389
the there's a fundamental part of
China the island of fosa not not Taiwan

1394
00:30:23,389 --> 00:30:23,399
China the island of fosa not not Taiwan
 

1395
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:26,710
China the island of fosa not not Taiwan
that is um not part of China but should

1396
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:26,720
that is um not part of China but should
 

1397
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,389
that is um not part of China but should
be uh and the only reason it hasn't been

1398
00:30:29,389 --> 00:30:29,399
be uh and the only reason it hasn't been
 

1399
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:31,350
be uh and the only reason it hasn't been
is because of the US Pacific

yes China has been very clear that um

1414
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:51,200
yes China has been very clear that um
 

1415
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,269
yes China has been very clear that um
they will incorporate Taiwan uh

1416
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:54,279
they will incorporate Taiwan uh
 

1417
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:57,909
they will incorporate Taiwan uh
peacefully or uh militarily

1418
00:30:57,909 --> 00:30:57,919
peacefully or uh militarily
 

1419
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,470
peacefully or uh militarily
but that they will incorporate it from

1420
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:00,480
but that they will incorporate it from
 

1421
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,029
but that they will incorporate it from
their standpoint is 100%

1422
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:03,039
their standpoint is 100%
 

1423
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,070
their standpoint is 100%
likely you know something you said about

1424
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:05,080
likely you know something you said about
 

1425
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,070
likely you know something you said about
conspicuous acts of kindness as a

1426
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:07,080
conspicuous acts of kindness as a
 

1427
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,269
conspicuous acts of kindness as a
geopolitical policy it almost seems

1428
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:11,279
geopolitical policy it almost seems
 

1429
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,669
geopolitical policy it almost seems
naive but I'd venture to say that this

1430
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:14,679
naive but I'd venture to say that this
 

1431
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:18,230
naive but I'd venture to say that this
is probably the path forward how you

1432
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:18,240
is probably the path forward how you
 

1433
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,629
is probably the path forward how you
avoid most wars just as you say it it

1434
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:21,639
avoid most wars just as you say it it
 

1435
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:24,389
avoid most wars just as you say it it
sounds naive but it's kind of

1436
00:31:24,389 --> 00:31:24,399
sounds naive but it's kind of
 

1437
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,870
sounds naive but it's kind of
brilliant if you believe in the goodness

1438

1573
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,430
a large language model I'm not sure
exactly what it is cuz I only had a

basis of My Philosophy uh which is that

1596
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:13,760
basis of My Philosophy uh which is that
 

1597
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,750
basis of My Philosophy uh which is that
we don't know the meaning of life but

1598
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:16,760
we don't know the meaning of life but
 

1599
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,310
we don't know the meaning of life but
the more we can expand the scope and

1600
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:18,320
the more we can expand the scope and
 

1601
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,670
the more we can expand the scope and
scale of

1602
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:21,680

 

1603
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,950

Consciousness digital and

1604
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:23,960
Consciousness digital and
 

1605
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,109
Consciousness digital and
biological the more we are able to

1606
00:35:26,109 --> 00:35:26,119
biological the more we are able to
 

1607
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:27,430
biological the more we are able to
understand what questions to ask about

1608
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:27,440
understand what questions to ask about
 

1609
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,150
understand what questions to ask about
the angel that is the

1610
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:29,160
the angel that is the
 

1611
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,190
the angel that is the
universe so I have a philosophy of

1612
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:33,200
universe so I have a philosophy of
 

1613
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,870
universe so I have a philosophy of
curiosity there is generally a feeling

1614
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:35,880
curiosity there is generally a feeling
 

1615
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,670
curiosity there is generally a feeling

1618
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:43,000
outward looking like the way you are
 

1619
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,390
outward looking like the way you are
like sitting with a good friend looking

1620
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:44,400
like sitting with a good friend looking
 

1621
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,190
like sitting with a good friend looking
up at the stars like the asking pad like

1622
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:48,200
up at the stars like the asking pad like
 

1623
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,950
up at the stars like the asking pad like
questions about the universe wondering

1624
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:49,960
questions about the universe wondering
 

1625
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,630
questions about the universe wondering
what it's all about the Curiosity you

1626
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:51,640
what it's all about the Curiosity you
 

1627
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,309
what it's all about the Curiosity you
talk about there there's a sense no

1628
00:35:53,309 --> 00:35:53,319
talk about there there's a sense no
 

1629
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:55,670
talk about there there's a sense no
matter how mundane the question I ask it

1630
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:55,680
matter how mundane the question I ask it
 

1631
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,150
matter how mundane the question I ask it
there there's a sense of Cosmic Grandeur

1632
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:58,160
there there's a sense of Cosmic Grandeur
 

1633
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,430
there there's a sense of Cosmic Grandeur
to the whole thing well we are actually

00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:00,440
to the whole thing well we are actually

00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,309
to the whole thing well we are actually
working hard to have uh engineering math

1636
00:36:04,309 --> 00:36:04,319
working hard to have uh engineering math
 

1637
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:06,589
working hard to have uh engineering math
and physics answers that you can count

1638
00:36:06,589 --> 00:36:06,599
and physics answers that you can count
 

1639
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:07,670
and physics answers that you can count

1643
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,430

there

1644
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:13,440
there
 

1645
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,950
there
the these so-called large language

1646
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:15,960
the these so-called large language
 

1647
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,990
the these so-called large language
models um I've not found the uh

1648
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:20,000
models um I've not found the uh
 

1649
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,150
models um I've not found the uh
engineering to be reliable um and the

1650
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:24,160
engineering to be reliable um and the
 

1651
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,589
engineering to be reliable um and the
hallucination it it unfortunately

1652
00:36:25,589 --> 00:36:25,599
hallucination it it unfortunately
 

1653
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,430
hallucination it it unfortunately
hallucinates Mo most when you least

1654
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:27,440
hallucinates Mo most when you least
 

1655
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,910
hallucinates Mo most when you least
wanted to hallucinate yeah so when you

1656
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:29,920
wanted to hallucinate yeah so when you
 

1657
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,710
wanted to hallucinate yeah so when you
ask important diffic difficult questions

1658
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:31,720
ask important diffic difficult questions
 

1659
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,750
ask important diffic difficult questions
it that's when it tends to be

1660
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:33,760
it that's when it tends to be
 

1661
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,910
it that's when it tends to be
confidently wrong um so we're we're

1662
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:37,920
confidently wrong um so we're we're
 

1663
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,750
confidently wrong um so we're we're
really trying hard to say okay how do we

1664
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:40,760
really trying hard to say okay how do we
 

1665
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,309
really trying hard to say okay how do we
be as grounded as possible so you can

1666
00:36:42,309 --> 00:36:42,319
be as grounded as possible so you can
 

1667
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:44,670
be as grounded as possible so you can
count on the results

1668
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:44,680
count on the results
 

1669
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,630
count on the results
um Trace things back to physics first

1670
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:47,640
um Trace things back to physics first
 

1671
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:52,190
um Trace things back to physics first
principles U mathematical logic um so

1672
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:52,200
principles U mathematical logic um so
 

1673
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,670
principles U mathematical logic um so
underlying the humor is an aspiration

1674
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:55,680
underlying the humor is an aspiration
 

1675
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,550
underlying the humor is an aspiration
to

1676
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:57,560
to
 

1677
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,990
to
adhere to the truth of the universe as

1678
00:36:58,990 --> 00:36:59,000
adhere to the truth of the universe as
 

1679
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,470
adhere to the truth of the universe as
closely as

1680
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:00,480
closely as
 

1681
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,069
closely as
possible that's really tricky it is

1682
00:37:03,069 --> 00:37:03,079
possible that's really tricky it is
 

1683
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:04,910
possible that's really tricky it is
tricky

1684
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:04,920
tricky
 

1685
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,829
tricky
so that's why you know you there's

1686
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:07,839
so that's why you know you there's
 

1687
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:09,550
so that's why you know you there's
always going to be some amount of error

1688
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:09,560
always going to be some amount of error
 

1689
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,670
always going to be some amount of error
but we want to um aspire

1690
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:12,680
but we want to um aspire
 

1691
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:17,349
but we want to um aspire
to be as truthful as possible about the

1692
00:37:17,349 --> 00:37:17,359
to be as truthful as possible about the
 

1693
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,349
to be as truthful as possible about the
answers uh with acknowledged error and

1694
00:37:20,349 --> 00:37:20,359
answers uh with acknowledged error and
 

1695
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:22,030
answers uh with acknowledged error and
so that there was always you don't want

1696
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:22,040
so that there was always you don't want
 

1697
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,270
so that there was always you don't want
to be confidently wrong so you're not

1698
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:25,280
to be confidently wrong so you're not
 

1699
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,870
to be confidently wrong so you're not
going to be right every time but you

1700
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:26,880
going to be right every time but you
 

1701
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,990
going to be right every time but you
don't you want to minimize how often

1702
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:29,000
don't you want to minimize how often
 

1703
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,670
don't you want to minimize how often
you're confidently uh wrong and then

1704
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:31,680
you're confidently uh wrong and then
 

1705
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,230
you're confidently uh wrong and then
like I said once you can count on the

1706
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:34,240
like I said once you can count on the
 

1707
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,910
like I said once you can count on the
logic as being

1708
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:36,920
logic as being
 

1709
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,630
logic as being
um not violating physics then you can

1710
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:40,640
um not violating physics then you can
 

1711
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,030
um not violating physics then you can
start to build on that to create uh

1712
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:43,040
start to build on that to create uh
 

1713
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,230
start to build on that to create uh
inventions like invent new

1714
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:45,240
inventions like invent new
 

1715
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,190
inventions like invent new
technologies but if if you can't if you

1716
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:48,200
technologies but if if you can't if you
 

1717
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,390
technologies but if if you can't if you
if you

1718
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:49,400
if you
 

1719
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,790
if you
cannot count on the foundational physics

1720
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:51,800
cannot count on the foundational physics
 

1721
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,190
cannot count on the foundational physics
being correct obviously the inventions

1722
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:53,200
being correct obviously the inventions
 

1723
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,589
being correct obviously the inventions
are simply wishful

1724
00:37:55,589 --> 00:37:55,599
are simply wishful
 

1725
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,349
are simply wishful
thinking you know imagination

1726

1729
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,230
land magic
basically well as you said I think one

1730
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:03,240
basically well as you said I think one
 

1731
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,190
basically well as you said I think one
of the big goals of XI is to understand

Mission um if you look out far into the

1738
00:38:15,109 --> 00:38:15,119
Mission um if you look out far into the
 

1739
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,270
Mission um if you look out far into the
future do you think on this level of

1740
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:17,280
future do you think on this level of
 

1741
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,829
future do you think on this level of
physics the very edge of what we

1742
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:18,839
physics the very edge of what we
 

1743
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,670
physics the very edge of what we
understand about physics do you think it

1744
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:20,680
understand about physics do you think it
 

1745
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,190
understand about physics do you think it
will make discoveries sort of the

1746
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:23,200
will make discoveries sort of the
 

1747
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,750
will make discoveries sort of the
sexiest discovery of them is as we know

1748
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:25,760
sexiest discovery of them is as we know

00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,589
now sort of uh unifying general
relativity and quantum mechanics so

1752
00:38:30,589 --> 00:38:30,599
relativity and quantum mechanics so
 

1753
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,550
relativity and quantum mechanics so
coming up with The Theory of Everything

1754
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:32,560

coming up with The Theory of Everything
do you think it could push towards that

1756
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:34,920
do you think it could push towards that
 

1757
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,470
do you think it could push towards that
direction almost like theoretical

1758
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:36,480
direction almost like theoretical
 

1759
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,910

00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,910
physics discoveries if an AI cannot
figure out new physics um it's clearly

1762
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:41,920
figure out new physics um it's clearly
 

1763
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,190
figure out new physics um it's clearly
not equal to humans let Al nor has

00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:45,200
not equal to humans let Al nor has
 

1765
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,390

figured out new physics they just you

1768
00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:48,359
figured out new physics they just you
 

1769
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,710
figured out new physics they just you
know physics is just understanding you

1770
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:50,720
know physics is just understanding you
 

1771
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,069
know physics is just understanding you
know deing one's insight into how

00:38:53,069 --> 00:38:53,079
know deing one's insight into how
 

1773
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:57,349
know deing one's insight into how
reality works and then um

1774
00:38:57,349 --> 00:38:57,359
reality works and then um
 

1775
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:58,870
reality works and then um
then then than this engineering which is

1776
00:38:58,870 --> 00:38:58,880
then then than this engineering which is
 

1777
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,030
then then than this engineering which is

00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:06,280
physics because you know once you figure
 

1785
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,150
physics because you know once you figure
out the rules of the universe uh that

00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:09,160
out the rules of the universe uh that
 

1787
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,349
out the rules of the universe uh that
that's that's it you've discovered

1788
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:10,359
that's that's it you've discovered
 

1789
00:39:10,359 --> 00:39:12,750
that's that's it you've discovered
things that already existed but from

things that already existed but from
 

1791
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,710

rules of the game properly and we do
 

1801
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:29,190

physics is very difficult yeah you have

1828
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:01,560
physics is very difficult yeah you have
 

1829
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,030
physics is very difficult yeah you have
to test any any conclusions against the

00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:04,040
to test any any conclusions against the
 

1831
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,550
to test any any conclusions against the
ground truth of reality reality is the

ground truth of reality reality is the
 

1833
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,470

00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:12,720
people break the break the laws made by
 

1841
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,910
people break the break the laws made by
man but none break the laws made by

1842
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:14,920
man but none break the laws made by
 

1843
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,109
man but none break the laws made by
physics it's a good test actually if

00:40:17,109 --> 00:40:17,119
physics it's a good test actually if
 

1845
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,829
physics it's a good test actually if
this

1846
00:40:18,829 --> 00:40:18,839
this
 

1847
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:21,790

LM uh understands and matches physics

1848
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:21,800
LM uh understands and matches physics
 

1849
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,870
LM uh understands and matches physics
then you can more reliably trust

1850
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:23,880
then you can more reliably trust
 

1851
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,510
then you can more reliably trust
whatever it thinks about the current

00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:40,079
um with these with the approach of like
 

1863
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,230

just predicting a token predict token

1864
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:42,240
just predicting a token predict token
 

1865
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,230
just predicting a token predict token
predict token it's like a vector sum you

1866
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:45,240
predict token it's like a vector sum you
 

1867
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,630
predict token it's like a vector sum you
know you you're summing up a bunch of

1868
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:46,640
know you you're summing up a bunch of
 

1869
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,510
know you you're summing up a bunch of
vectors but you can get drift um so as

1870
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:49,520
vectors but you can get drift um so as
 

1871
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,510
vectors but you can get drift um so as
those a little bit of error a little bit

1872
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:51,520
those a little bit of error a little bit
 

1873
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,870
those a little bit of error a little bit
of error adds up and by the time you are

1874
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:53,880
of error adds up and by the time you are
 

1875
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,430
of error adds up and by the time you are
many tokens down the path uh you're

1876
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:57,440
many tokens down the path uh you're
 

1877
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,109
many tokens down the path uh you're
it doesn't make any sense MH so it has

1878
00:41:00,109 --> 00:41:00,119
it doesn't make any sense MH so it has
 

1879
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:02,630
it doesn't make any sense MH so it has
to be somehow self-aware about the drift

1880
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:02,640
to be somehow self-aware about the drift
 

1881
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,150
to be somehow self-aware about the drift
it has to be self-aware about the drift

1882
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:04,160
it has to be self-aware about the drift
 

1883
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,589
it has to be self-aware about the drift
and then look at the thing as a gal as a

1884
00:41:07,589 --> 00:41:07,599
and then look at the thing as a gal as a
 

1885
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:11,030
and then look at the thing as a gal as a
whole and and say it does it have

1886
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:11,040
whole and and say it does it have
 

1887
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,349
whole and and say it does it have
coherence as a whole mhm

1888
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:14,359
coherence as a whole mhm
 

1889

coherence as a whole mhm
so you know when when authors write

1890
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:18,040
so you know when when authors write
 

1891
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,870
so you know when when authors write
books that they they will write the book

1892
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:19,880
books that they they will write the book
 

1893
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,230
books that they they will write the book
and then they'll go and revise it you

1894
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:22,240
and then they'll go and revise it you
 

1895
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,230
and then they'll go and revise it you
know taking into account you know all

1896
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:25,240
know taking into account you know all
 

1897
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,710
know taking into account you know all
the end and the beginning and the midal

1898
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:26,720
the end and the beginning and the midal
 

1899
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,470
the end and the beginning and the midal
and and uh rewrite it to achieve

1900
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:29,480
and and uh rewrite it to achieve
 

1901
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,910
and and uh rewrite it to achieve
coherence so that it doesn't end end up

1902
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:31,920
coherence so that it doesn't end end up
 

1903
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,109

in a nonsensical Place mhm maybe the

1904
00:41:34,109 --> 00:41:34,119
in a nonsensical Place mhm maybe the
 

1905
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:37,069
in a nonsensical Place mhm maybe the
process of revising is what yeah

1906
00:41:37,069 --> 00:41:37,079
process of revising is what yeah
 

1907
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:39,069
process of revising is what yeah
reasoning is and then that's the process

1908
00:41:39,069 --> 00:41:39,079
reasoning is and then that's the process
 

1909
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,430
reasoning is and then that's the process
of revising is how you get closer and

1910
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:40,440
of revising is how you get closer and
 

1911
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,390
of revising is how you get closer and
closer to truth maybe you like uh at

1912
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:43,400
closer to truth maybe you like uh at
 

1913
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,550
closer to truth maybe you like uh at
least I approach that way you just say a

1914
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:45,560
least I approach that way you just say a
 

1915
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,990
least I approach that way you just say a
bunch of first and then you get

1916
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:47,000
bunch of first and then you get
 

1917
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,030
bunch of first and then you get
it better you start a and then

1918
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:49,040
it better you start a and then
 

1919
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,589
it better you start a and then
you get you create a draft and then and

1920
00:41:50,589 --> 00:41:50,599
you get you create a draft and then and
 

1921
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:52,030
you get you create a draft and then and
then you and then you iterate on that

1922
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:52,040
then you and then you iterate on that
 

1923
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,390
then you and then you iterate on that
draft um until it has has coherence

1924
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:55,400
draft um until it has has coherence
 

1925
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,829
draft um until it has has coherence
until it's it it all adds up basically

1926
00:41:58,829 --> 00:41:58,839
until it's it it all adds up basically
 

1927
00:41:58,839 --> 00:42:00,430
until it's it it all adds up basically
so another question about Theory of

1928
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:00,440
so another question about Theory of
 

1929
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,829
so another question about Theory of
Everything But for intelligence do you

1930
00:42:02,829 --> 00:42:02,839
Everything But for intelligence do you
 

1931
00:42:02,839 --> 00:42:05,190
Everything But for intelligence do you
think there exists as you're exploring

1932
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:05,200
think there exists as you're exploring
 

1933
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,950
think there exists as you're exploring
this with xai creating this intelligence

1934
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:06,960
this with xai creating this intelligence
 

1935
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,190
this with xai creating this intelligence
system do you think there is a theory of

1936
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:09,200
system do you think there is a theory of
 

1937
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,710
system do you think there is a theory of
intelligence where you get to understand

1938
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:12,720
intelligence where you get to understand
 

1939
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,309
intelligence where you get to understand
what

1940
00:42:14,309 --> 00:42:14,319
what
 

1941
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:18,230
what
like what is the ey in AGI and what is

1942
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:18,240
like what is the ey in AGI and what is
 

1943
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:22,470
like what is the ey in AGI and what is
the ey in um human intelligence there's

1944
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:22,480
the ey in um human intelligence there's
 

1945
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,150
the ey in um human intelligence there's
no ey in Team America oh wait there

1946
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:25,160
no ey in Team America oh wait there
 

1947
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,670
no ey in Team America oh wait there
is

1948
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:26,680
is
 

1949
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:30,390
is
H that's going to be stuck in my head

1950
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:30,400
H that's going to be stuck in my head
 

1951
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,069
H that's going to be stuck in my head
now uh yeah there's no me and

1952
00:42:35,069 --> 00:42:35,079
now uh yeah there's no me and
 

1953
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:39,910
now uh yeah there's no me and
whatever uh in quantum mechanics oh

1954
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:39,920

 

1955
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,750

wait uh I mean is that part of the

1956
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:42,760
wait uh I mean is that part of the
 

1957
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,790
wait uh I mean is that part of the
process of discovering understanding the

1958
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:44,800
process of discovering understanding the
 

1959
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,069
process of discovering understanding the
universe is understanding

1960
00:42:47,069 --> 00:42:47,079
universe is understanding
 

1961
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:49,349
universe is understanding
intelligence

1962
00:42:49,349 --> 00:42:49,359
intelligence
 

1963
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,589
intelligence
yeah yeah I think we need to understand

1964
00:42:51,589 --> 00:42:51,599
yeah yeah I think we need to understand
 

1965
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:54,030
yeah yeah I think we need to understand
intelligence understand Consciousness I

1966
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:54,040
intelligence understand Consciousness I
 

1967
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,150
intelligence understand Consciousness I
mean there I mean there are some sort of

1968
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:56,160
mean there I mean there are some sort of
 

1969
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,670
mean there I mean there are some sort of
fundamental questions of like what is

1970
00:42:59,670 --> 00:42:59,680
fundamental questions of like what is
 

1971
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,430
fundamental questions of like what is
thought what is emotion yeah um is it

1972
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:03,440
thought what is emotion yeah um is it
 

1973
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,990
thought what is emotion yeah um is it
really just one atom bumping into

1974
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:05,000
really just one atom bumping into
 

1975
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,670
really just one atom bumping into
another atom it feels like something

1976
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:06,680
another atom it feels like something
 

1977
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,750
another atom it feels like something
more than

1978
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:07,760
more than
 

1979
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,910
more than
that uh so I I I I I think we're

1980
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:10,920
that uh so I I I I I think we're
 

1981
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,950
that uh so I I I I I think we're
probably missing some really big things

1982
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:14,960
probably missing some really big things
 

1983
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,870
probably missing some really big things
um like some really big things something

1984
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:18,880
um like some really big things something
 

1985
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,069
um like some really big things something
that'll be obvious in retrospect yes

1986
00:43:21,069 --> 00:43:21,079
that'll be obvious in retrospect yes
 

1987
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:23,710
that'll be obvious in retrospect yes
like there's a giant like you put the

1988
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:23,720
like there's a giant like you put the
 

1989
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,710
like there's a giant like you put the
whole Consciousness emotion

1990
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:26,720
whole Consciousness emotion
 

1991
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,950
whole Consciousness emotion
well some people would callot like a

1992
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:27,960
well some people would callot like a
 

1993
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:31,309
well some people would callot like a
like a soul you know religion a soul um

1994
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:31,319
like a soul you know religion a soul um
 

1995
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:33,950
like a soul you know religion a soul um
like you feel like you're you right I

1996
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:33,960
like you feel like you're you right I
 

1997
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:37,069
like you feel like you're you right I
mean you don't feel like you're just a

1998
00:43:37,069 --> 00:43:37,079
mean you don't feel like you're just a
 

1999
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:39,470
mean you don't feel like you're just a
collection of atoms but on what

2000
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:39,480
collection of atoms but on what
 

2001
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,430
collection of atoms but on what
dimension does thought exist what dimens

2002
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:42,440
dimension does thought exist what dimens
 

2003
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,190
dimension does thought exist what dimens
does do emotions exist we feel them very

2004
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:45,200
does do emotions exist we feel them very
 

2005
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,630
does do emotions exist we feel them very
strongly um I suspect there's more to it

2006
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:47,640
strongly um I suspect there's more to it
 

2007
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:51,270
strongly um I suspect there's more to it
than atoms bump into

2008
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:51,280

 

2009
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,030

atoms and maybe AI can pave the path to

2010
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:55,040
atoms and maybe AI can pave the path to
 

2011
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,710
atoms and maybe AI can pave the path to
the Discovery what whatever the hell

2012
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:56,720
the Discovery what whatever the hell
 

2013
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,630
the Discovery what whatever the hell
that thing is yeah what is consciousness

2014
00:43:59,630 --> 00:43:59,640
that thing is yeah what is consciousness
 

2015
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,390
that thing is yeah what is consciousness
like what when you put the atoms in a

2016
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:01,400
like what when you put the atoms in a
 

2017
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,510
like what when you put the atoms in a
particular shape why are they able to

2018
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:03,520
particular shape why are they able to
 

2019
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:08,390
particular shape why are they able to
form thoughts and take actions that and

2020
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:08,400
form thoughts and take actions that and
 

2021
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,109
form thoughts and take actions that and
and

2022
00:44:09,109 --> 00:44:09,119
and
 

2023
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,710
and
feelings and even if it is an illusion

2024
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:11,720
feelings and even if it is an illusion
 

2025
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,589
feelings and even if it is an illusion
why is this illusion so compelling yeah

2026
00:44:14,589 --> 00:44:14,599
why is this illusion so compelling yeah
 

2027
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:16,309
why is this illusion so compelling yeah
like how do why does this illusion

2028
00:44:16,309 --> 00:44:16,319
like how do why does this illusion
 

2029
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:20,670
like how do why does this illusion
exist yeah on what plane does this the

2030
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:20,680
exist yeah on what plane does this the
 

2031
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:23,589
exist yeah on what plane does this the
solution exists yeah um and sometimes I

2032
00:44:23,589 --> 00:44:23,599
solution exists yeah um and sometimes I
 

2033
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:24,750
solution exists yeah um and sometimes I
wonder

2034
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:24,760
wonder
 

2035
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,630
wonder
is is know either perhaps everything's

2036
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:27,640
is is know either perhaps everything's
 

2037
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,309
is is know either perhaps everything's
conscious or nothing is

2038
00:44:29,309 --> 00:44:29,319
conscious or nothing is
 

2039
00:44:29,319 --> 00:44:33,710
conscious or nothing is
conscious um one of the two I like the

2040
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:33,720
conscious um one of the two I like the
 

2041
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,430
conscious um one of the two I like the
former everything conscious just seems

2042
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:36,440
former everything conscious just seems
 

2043
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:40,390
former everything conscious just seems
more fun it just seem more more fun yes

2044
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:40,400
more fun it just seem more more fun yes
 

2045
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,109
more fun it just seem more more fun yes
um but we're composed of atoms and those

2046
00:44:43,109 --> 00:44:43,119
um but we're composed of atoms and those
 

2047
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,630
um but we're composed of atoms and those
atoms are composed of quarks and leptons

2048
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:45,640
atoms are composed of quarks and leptons
 

2049
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,190
atoms are composed of quarks and leptons
and those quarks and leptons have been

2050
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:47,200
and those quarks and leptons have been
 

2051
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,069
and those quarks and leptons have been
around since the beginning of the

2052
00:44:49,069 --> 00:44:49,079
around since the beginning of the
 

2053
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:53,190
around since the beginning of the
universe the beginning of the universe

2054
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:53,200
universe the beginning of the universe
 

2055
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,309
universe the beginning of the universe
right what what seems to be the

2056
00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:54,319
right what what seems to be the
 

2057
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,109
right what what seems to be the
beginning of the universe the first time

2058
00:44:56,109 --> 00:44:56,119
beginning of the universe the first time
 

2059
00:44:56,119 --> 00:44:57,630
beginning of the universe the first time
we talked you said what you would which

2060
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:57,640
we talked you said what you would which
 

2061
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,309
we talked you said what you would which
is surreal to think that this discussion

2062
00:45:00,309 --> 00:45:00,319
is surreal to think that this discussion
 

2063
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:02,790
is surreal to think that this discussion
was happening is becoming a reality I

2064
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:02,800
was happening is becoming a reality I
 

2065
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,990
was happening is becoming a reality I
asked you what question would you ask an

2066
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:05,000
asked you what question would you ask an
 

2067
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,069
asked you what question would you ask an
AGI system once you create it and you

2068
00:45:07,069 --> 00:45:07,079
AGI system once you create it and you
 

2069
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,309
AGI system once you create it and you
said what's outside the simulation is

2070
00:45:09,309 --> 00:45:09,319
said what's outside the simulation is
 

2071
00:45:09,319 --> 00:45:13,630
said what's outside the simulation is
the question and good question yeah but

2072
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:13,640
the question and good question yeah but
 

2073
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,349
the question and good question yeah but
it seems like with Gro you started to

2074
00:45:16,349 --> 00:45:16,359
it seems like with Gro you started to
 

2075
00:45:16,359 --> 00:45:19,549
it seems like with Gro you started to
literally uh the system's goal is to be

2076
00:45:19,549 --> 00:45:19,559
literally uh the system's goal is to be
 

2077
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:21,750
literally uh the system's goal is to be
able to ask such questions to answer

2078
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:21,760
able to ask such questions to answer
 

2079
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,990
able to ask such questions to answer
such questions and to ask such questions

2080
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:24,000
such questions and to ask such questions
 

2081
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,510
such questions and to ask such questions
where are the aliens where are the

2082
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:25,520
where are the aliens where are the
 

2083
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,549
where are the aliens where are the
aliens that's one of the like the FY

2084
00:45:27,549 --> 00:45:27,559
aliens that's one of the like the FY
 

2085
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:31,390

Paradox question um a lot of people have

2086
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:31,400
Paradox question um a lot of people have
 

2087
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,069
Paradox question um a lot of people have
asked me if I've seen any evidence of

2088
00:45:33,069 --> 00:45:33,079
asked me if I've seen any evidence of
 

2089
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:36,069
asked me if I've seen any evidence of
aliens and I've I haven't which is kind

2090
00:45:36,069 --> 00:45:36,079
aliens and I've I haven't which is kind
 

2091
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:37,829
aliens and I've I haven't which is kind
of concerning because

2092
00:45:37,829 --> 00:45:37,839
of concerning because
 

2093
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:40,549
of concerning because
then I think would I probably prefer at

2094
00:45:40,549 --> 00:45:40,559
then I think would I probably prefer at
 

2095
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:42,430
then I think would I probably prefer at
least have seen some orological evidence

2096
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:42,440
least have seen some orological evidence
 

2097
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,390
least have seen some orological evidence
of aliens um to the best of my knowledge

2098
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:45,400
of aliens um to the best of my knowledge
 

2099
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,030

2121
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,950

will heat heat the Earth up it's some

2180
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:37,000
will heat heat the Earth up it's some
 

2181
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,030
will heat heat the Earth up it's some
point in the future um boil the oceans

2182
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:40,040
point in the future um boil the oceans
 

2183
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,470
point in the future um boil the oceans
and and Earth will become like Venus

2184
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:42,480
and and Earth will become like Venus
 

2185
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,069
and and Earth will become like Venus
where no life Life as we know it is

unless we destroy we need to do it I

2230
00:48:46,829 --> 00:48:46,839
unless we destroy we need to do it I
 

2231
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:51,109
unless we destroy we need to do it I
mean it's it's not I mean I suspect that

2232
00:48:51,109 --> 00:48:51,119
mean it's it's not I mean I suspect that
 

2233
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:51,910
mean it's it's not I mean I suspect that
there

2234
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:51,920
there
 

2235
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,190
there
there if we are able to go out there and

2236
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:54,200
there if we are able to go out there and
 

2237
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,390
there if we are able to go out there and
explore other star system that we

2238
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:56,400
explore other star system that we
 

2239
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,270
explore other star system that we
there's a good chance we find a whole

2240
00:48:58,270 --> 00:48:58,280
there's a good chance we find a whole
 

2241
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,109
there's a good chance we find a whole
bunch of long Dead one planet

2242
00:49:00,109 --> 00:49:00,119
bunch of long Dead one planet
 

2243
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:02,109
bunch of long Dead one planet
civilizations yeah they never made it

2244
00:49:02,109 --> 00:49:02,119
civilizations yeah they never made it
 

2245
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:04,870
civilizations yeah they never made it
past to their home planet that's so sad

2246
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:04,880
past to their home planet that's so sad
 

2247
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,230
past to their home planet that's so sad
yeah sad also fascinating I mean there

2248
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:08,240
yeah sad also fascinating I mean there
 

2249
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,990
yeah sad also fascinating I mean there
are very explanations for those for me

2250
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:10,000
are very explanations for those for me
 

2251
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,589
are very explanations for those for me
Paradox and one is is the sort of

2252
00:49:12,589 --> 00:49:12,599
Paradox and one is is the sort of
 

2253
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:14,750
Paradox and one is is the sort of
they're these great filters which

2254
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:14,760
they're these great filters which
 

2255
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,190
they're these great filters which
civilizations don't pass through and one

2256
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:17,200
civilizations don't pass through and one
 

2257
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,470
civilizations don't pass through and one
of those great filters is do you become

2258
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:19,480
of those great filters is do you become
 

2259
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:22,030
of those great filters is do you become
a multiplet civilization or not and if

2260
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:22,040
a multiplet civilization or not and if
 

2261
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,270
a multiplet civilization or not and if
you don't it's simply a matter of time

2262
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:24,280
you don't it's simply a matter of time
 

2263
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,230
you don't it's simply a matter of time
before something happens on your

2264
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:26,240
before something happens on your
 

2265
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:30,710
before something happens on your
planet um you know either natural or

2266
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:30,720
planet um you know either natural or
 

2267
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,349
planet um you know either natural or
man-made that causes us to die out like

2268
00:49:34,349 --> 00:49:34,359
man-made that causes us to die out like
 

2269
00:49:34,359 --> 00:49:35,030
man-made that causes us to die out like
the

2270
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:35,040
the
 

2271
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,349
the
dinosaurs where are they

2272
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:37,359
dinosaurs where are they
 

2273
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:39,950
dinosaurs where are they
now they didn't have

2274
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:39,960
now they didn't have
 

2275
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,309
now they didn't have
spaceships so I think the more likely

2276
00:49:43,309 --> 00:49:43,319
spaceships so I think the more likely
 

2277
00:49:43,319 --> 00:49:45,150
spaceships so I think the more likely
thing is cuz just

2278
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:45,160
thing is cuz just
 

2279
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:48,430
thing is cuz just
uh uh empathize with the aliens that

they they found us in their protecting
 

2283
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,430
they they found us in their protecting
us and letting us be I hope so nice

2284
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:52,440

cynical take I I have a he could be just
 

2349
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,150
cynical take I I have a he could be just
a brave Explorer and there'll be great

2350
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:14,160
a brave Explorer and there'll be great
 

2351
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,390
a brave Explorer and there'll be great
stories told about him amongst the

00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:17,400
stories told about him amongst the
 

2353
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:20,990
stories told about him amongst the
penguin population for many centuries to

2354
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:21,000
penguin population for many centuries to
 

2355
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,030
penguin population for many centuries to
come

2356
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:23,040
come
 

2357
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:28,670

um what we talking about okay

2358
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:28,680

 

2359
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,829

yeah so aliens I mean I don't know look

2360
00:51:31,829 --> 00:51:31,839
yeah so aliens I mean I don't know look
 

2361
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:35,109
yeah so aliens I mean I don't know look
I think it's the smart move uh is just

2362
00:51:35,109 --> 00:51:35,119
I think it's the smart move uh is just
 

2363
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,109
I think it's the smart move uh is just
you know this is the first time in the

2364
00:51:38,109 --> 00:51:38,119
you know this is the first time in the
 

2365
00:51:38,119 --> 00:51:39,549
you know this is the first time in the
history of Earth that it's been possible

2366
00:51:39,549 --> 00:51:39,559
history of Earth that it's been possible
 

2367
00:51:39,559 --> 00:51:43,069
history of Earth that it's been possible
for life to extend beyond Earth um that

2368
00:51:43,069 --> 00:51:43,079
for life to extend beyond Earth um that
 

2369
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:47,950
for life to extend beyond Earth um that
window is open um now it may be open for

2370
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:47,960
window is open um now it may be open for
 

2371
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,030
window is open um now it may be open for
a long time or it may be open for a

2372
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:50,040
a long time or it may be open for a
 

2373
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,190
a long time or it may be open for a
short

2374
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:51,200
short
 

2375
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,829
short
time and it may be open now and then

2376
00:51:53,829 --> 00:51:53,839
time and it may be open now and then
 

2377
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:56,549
time and it may be open now and then
never open again so I I think the smart

2378
00:51:56,549 --> 00:51:56,559
never open again so I I think the smart
 

2379
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:59,510
never open again so I I think the smart
move here is to make life multiplanetary

2380
00:51:59,510 --> 00:51:59,520
move here is to make life multiplanetary
 

2381
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,630
move here is to make life multiplanetary
while it is possible to do so we don't

2382
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:01,640
while it is possible to do so we don't
 

2383
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:02,870
while it is possible to do so we don't
want to be one of those lame One Planet

2384
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:02,880
want to be one of those lame One Planet
 

2385
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,030
want to be one of those lame One Planet
civilizations that just dies out no

2386
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:05,040
civilizations that just dies out no
 

2387
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,150
civilizations that just dies out no
those are lame

2388
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:07,160
those are lame
 

2389
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:10,150
those are lame
lame um self-respecting civilization

2390
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:10,160
lame um self-respecting civilization
 

2391
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,910
lame um self-respecting civilization
would be one planet there's not going to

2392
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:11,920
would be one planet there's not going to
 

2393
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,829
would be one planet there's not going to
be a Wikipedia entry for one of

2394
00:52:14,829 --> 00:52:14,839
be a Wikipedia entry for one of
 

2395
00:52:14,839 --> 00:52:19,390
be a Wikipedia entry for one of
those and uh pause uh do SpaceX have an

2396
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:19,400
those and uh pause uh do SpaceX have an
 

2397
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,789
those and uh pause uh do SpaceX have an
official uh policy for when we meet

2398
00:52:22,789 --> 00:52:22,799
official uh policy for when we meet
 

2399
00:52:22,799 --> 00:52:27,630
official uh policy for when we meet
Aliens no okay that seems

2400
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:27,640
Aliens no okay that seems
 

2401
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,829
Aliens no okay that seems
irresponsible

2402
00:52:29,829 --> 00:52:29,839
irresponsible
 

2403
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:33,630
irresponsible
um I mean look if I see the slightest

2404
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:33,640
um I mean look if I see the slightest
 

2405
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,230
um I mean look if I see the slightest
indication that there are aliens I will

2406
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:35,240
indication that there are aliens I will
 

2407
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,430
indication that there are aliens I will
immediately post on next platform yeah

2408
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:37,440
immediately post on next platform yeah
 

2409
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,349
immediately post on next platform yeah
anything I know it could be the most

2410
00:52:39,349 --> 00:52:39,359
anything I know it could be the most
 

2411
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:42,910
anything I know it could be the most
liked reposted post of all time yeah I

2412
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:42,920
liked reposted post of all time yeah I
 

2413
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,349
liked reposted post of all time yeah I
mean look we have more satellites up

2414
00:52:45,349 --> 00:52:45,359
mean look we have more satellites up
 

2415
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:47,150
mean look we have more satellites up
there right now than everyone else

2416
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:47,160
there right now than everyone else
 

2417
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,349
there right now than everyone else
combined so you know we' know we know if

2418
00:52:50,349 --> 00:52:50,359
combined so you know we' know we know if
 

2419
00:52:50,359 --> 00:52:52,270
combined so you know we' know we know if
we've got to maneuver around something

2420
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:52,280
we've got to maneuver around something
 

2421
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:53,789
we've got to maneuver around something
and we not I don't have to maneuver

2422
00:52:53,789 --> 00:52:53,799
and we not I don't have to maneuver
 

2423
00:52:53,799 --> 00:52:56,710
and we not I don't have to maneuver
around anything if you go to the big

2424
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:56,720
around anything if you go to the big
 

2425
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,390
around anything if you go to the big
questions once again you said you've um

2426
00:52:59,390 --> 00:52:59,400
questions once again you said you've um
 

2427
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,470
questions once again you said you've um
you're with Einstein that you believe in

2428
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:01,480
you're with Einstein that you believe in
 

2429
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,510
you're with Einstein that you believe in
the god of

2430
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:03,520
the god of
 

2431
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:07,309
the god of
Spinosa yes uh so you know that's a view

2432
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:07,319
Spinosa yes uh so you know that's a view
 

2433
00:53:07,319 --> 00:53:10,150
Spinosa yes uh so you know that's a view
that God is like the universe and is

2434
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:10,160
that God is like the universe and is
 

2435
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,630
that God is like the universe and is
reveals himself through the laws of

2436
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:11,640
reveals himself through the laws of
 

2437
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,789
reveals himself through the laws of
physics or as Einstein said through the

2438
00:53:13,789 --> 00:53:13,799
physics or as Einstein said through the
 

2439
00:53:13,799 --> 00:53:16,630
physics or as Einstein said through the
lawful Harmony of the world yeah I would

2440
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:16,640
lawful Harmony of the world yeah I would
 

2441
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,789
lawful Harmony of the world yeah I would
agree that that God of the simulator or

2442
00:53:19,789 --> 00:53:19,799
agree that that God of the simulator or
 

2443
00:53:19,799 --> 00:53:23,630
agree that that God of the simulator or
whatever the the Supreme Being or beings

2444
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:23,640
whatever the the Supreme Being or beings
 

2445
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:26,150
whatever the the Supreme Being or beings
um um

2446
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:26,160
um um
 

2447
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,270
um um
reveal themselves through the physics

2448
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:28,280
reveal themselves through the physics
 

2449
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:31,150
reveal themselves through the physics
you know they creators of this existence

2450
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:31,160
you know they creators of this existence
 

2451
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,630
you know they creators of this existence
and it's incom upon us to try to

2452
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:33,640
and it's incom upon us to try to
 

2453
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,950
and it's incom upon us to try to
understand more about this wondrous

2454
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:36,960
understand more about this wondrous
 

2455
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,349
understand more about this wondrous
creation like who created this thing

2456
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:39,359
creation like who created this thing
 

2457
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:41,750
creation like who created this thing
who's running this thing like embodying

2458
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:41,760
who's running this thing like embodying
 

2459
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,390
who's running this thing like embodying
it into a singular question with a sexy

2460
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:44,400
it into a singular question with a sexy
 

2461
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,670
it into a singular question with a sexy
word on top of it is like focusing the

2462
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:46,680
word on top of it is like focusing the
 

2463
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,549
word on top of it is like focusing the
mind to understand it it does seem like

2464
00:53:48,549 --> 00:53:48,559
mind to understand it it does seem like
 

2465
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,109
mind to understand it it does seem like
there's a um again it could be an

2466
00:53:51,109 --> 00:53:51,119
there's a um again it could be an
 

2467
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:53,349
there's a um again it could be an
illusion it seemed like there's a

2468
00:53:53,349 --> 00:53:53,359
illusion it seemed like there's a
 

2469
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:56,030
illusion it seemed like there's a
purpose that there's under L master plan

2470
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:56,040
purpose that there's under L master plan
 

2471
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:59,230
purpose that there's under L master plan
of some kind it seems like there may not

2472
00:53:59,230 --> 00:53:59,240
of some kind it seems like there may not
 

2473
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:02,910
of some kind it seems like there may not
be a master plan in the sense so this

2474
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:02,920
be a master plan in the sense so this
 

2475
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,109
be a master plan in the sense so this
like maybe an interesting answer to the

2476
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:05,119
like maybe an interesting answer to the
 

2477
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:07,150
like maybe an interesting answer to the
question of determinism versus free will

2478
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:07,160
question of determinism versus free will
 

2479
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,589
question of determinism versus free will
is that if we are in a

2480
00:54:09,589 --> 00:54:09,599
is that if we are in a
 

2481
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:12,270
is that if we are in a
simulation the reason that the the these

2482
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:12,280
simulation the reason that the the these
 

2483
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,349
simulation the reason that the the these
higher beings would hold a simulation is

2484
00:54:14,349 --> 00:54:14,359
higher beings would hold a simulation is
 

2485
00:54:14,359 --> 00:54:19,589
higher beings would hold a simulation is
to see what happens mhm so it's not um

2486
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:19,599
to see what happens mhm so it's not um
 

2487
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:21,030
to see what happens mhm so it's not um
they don't know what

2488
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:21,040
they don't know what
 

2489
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,990
they don't know what
happens uh otherwise they wouldn't hold

2490
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:23,000
happens uh otherwise they wouldn't hold
 

2491
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,589
happens uh otherwise they wouldn't hold
the simulation mhm so when when humans

2492
00:54:26,589 --> 00:54:26,599
the simulation mhm so when when humans
 

2493
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:28,230
the simulation mhm so when when humans
create a simulation so it's basx and

2494
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:28,240
create a simulation so it's basx and
 

2495
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,190
create a simulation so it's basx and
Tesla we create simulations all the time

2496
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:31,200
Tesla we create simulations all the time
 

2497
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:35,470
Tesla we create simulations all the time
um especially for the rocket you you uh

2498
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:35,480
um especially for the rocket you you uh
 

2499
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,990
um especially for the rocket you you uh
you know you have to run a lot of

2500
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:37,000
you know you have to run a lot of
 

2501
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,030
you know you have to run a lot of
simulations to understand what's going

2502
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:39,040
simulations to understand what's going
 

2503
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,589
simulations to understand what's going
to happen because you can't really test

2504
00:54:40,589 --> 00:54:40,599
to happen because you can't really test
 

2505
00:54:40,599 --> 00:54:43,510
to happen because you can't really test
the rocket until it goes to space and

2506
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:43,520
the rocket until it goes to space and
 

2507
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,430
the rocket until it goes to space and
you want it to work so you have to you

2508
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:45,440
you want it to work so you have to you
 

2509
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,309
you want it to work so you have to you
have to

2510
00:54:46,309 --> 00:54:46,319
have to
 

2511
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:49,750
have to
simulate subsonic transonic hyper

2512
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:49,760
simulate subsonic transonic hyper
 

2513
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:50,870
simulate subsonic transonic hyper
supersonic

2514
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:50,880
supersonic
 

2515
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,510
supersonic
Hypersonic um ascent and then coming

2516
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:54,520
Hypersonic um ascent and then coming
 

2517
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:58,430
Hypersonic um ascent and then coming
back super high Heating and um overal

2518
00:54:58,430 --> 00:54:58,440
back super high Heating and um overal
 

2519
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,750
back super high Heating and um overal
Dynamics all this is going to be

2520
00:54:59,750 --> 00:54:59,760
Dynamics all this is going to be
 

2521
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,030
Dynamics all this is going to be
simulated

2522
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:01,040
simulated
 

2523
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,309
simulated
so uh you don't get very many kicks at

2524
00:55:03,309 --> 00:55:03,319
so uh you don't get very many kicks at
 

2525
00:55:03,319 --> 00:55:05,630
so uh you don't get very many kicks at
the can but we run the simulations to

2526
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:05,640
the can but we run the simulations to
 

2527
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,309
the can but we run the simulations to
see what happens not if we knew what

2528
00:55:07,309 --> 00:55:07,319
see what happens not if we knew what
 

2529
00:55:07,319 --> 00:55:09,069
see what happens not if we knew what
happens we wouldn't run the simulation

2530
00:55:09,069 --> 00:55:09,079
happens we wouldn't run the simulation
 

2531
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:12,109
happens we wouldn't run the simulation
mhm so if if there's so whoever created

2532
00:55:12,109 --> 00:55:12,119
mhm so if if there's so whoever created
 

2533
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:13,069
mhm so if if there's so whoever created
this

2534
00:55:13,069 --> 00:55:13,079
this
 

2535
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:15,430
this
existence um

2536
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:15,440
existence um
 

2537
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,670
existence um
is they're running it because they don't

2538
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:17,680
is they're running it because they don't
 

2539
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,950
is they're running it because they don't
know what's going to happen not because

2540
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:19,960
know what's going to happen not because

four on I I'm not sure it's possible but

2860
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:27,400
four on I I'm not sure it's possible but
 

2861
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,029
four on I I'm not sure it's possible but
it's I do make progress so then I'm like

2862
01:02:30,029 --> 01:02:30,039
it's I do make progress so then I'm like
 

2863
01:02:30,039 --> 01:02:32,309
it's I do make progress so then I'm like
okay I'm making progress

2864
01:02:32,309 --> 01:02:32,319
okay I'm making progress
 

2865
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:34,990
okay I'm making progress
maybe if I just tweak that Paragon board

2866
01:02:34,990 --> 01:02:35,000
maybe if I just tweak that Paragon board
 

2867
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,069
maybe if I just tweak that Paragon board
a little

2868
01:02:36,069 --> 01:02:36,079
a little
 

2869
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:39,309
a little
more I can do it could just dodge a few

2870
01:02:39,309 --> 01:02:39,319
more I can do it could just dodge a few
 

2871
01:02:39,319 --> 01:02:40,710
more I can do it could just dodge a few
more

2872
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:40,720
more
 

2873
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,990
more
waves I can do it well the simulation is

2874
01:02:43,990 --> 01:02:44,000
waves I can do it well the simulation is
 

2875
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,069
waves I can do it well the simulation is
created for the purpose of figuring out

2876
01:02:46,069 --> 01:02:46,079
created for the purpose of figuring out
 

2877
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:49,029
created for the purpose of figuring out
if it can be done and you're just a cog

2878
01:02:49,029 --> 01:02:49,039
if it can be done and you're just a cog
 

2879
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:50,990
if it can be done and you're just a cog
in that simulation in the machine of the

2880
01:02:50,990 --> 01:02:51,000
in that simulation in the machine of the
 

2881
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,230
in that simulation in the machine of the
simulation yeah it might

2882
01:02:53,230 --> 01:02:53,240
simulation yeah it might
 

2883
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:58,470
simulation yeah it might
be I I I I I have a feeling that at

2884
01:02:58,470 --> 01:02:58,480
be I I I I I have a feeling that at

least I
 

2887
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:05,910
least I
think it's doable it's doable yes mhm

2888
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:05,920
think it's doable it's doable yes mhm
 

2889

well that's the human Spirit right there
 

2891
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,789
well that's the human Spirit right there
to believe yeah I mean it did prompt me

2892
01:03:10,789 --> 01:03:10,799
to believe yeah I mean it did prompt me
 

2893
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:13,870
to believe yeah I mean it did prompt me
to think about just hate in general

2894
01:03:13,870 --> 01:03:13,880
to think about just hate in general
 

2895
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:17,309
to think about just hate in general
which is you know want to be careful of

2896
01:03:17,309 --> 01:03:17,319
which is you know want to be careful of
 

2897
01:03:17,319 --> 01:03:20,390
which is you know want to be careful of
one of those things where you wish for

something that sounds
 

2901
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,150
something that sounds
good but in but if you get it it's

2902
01:03:25,150 --> 01:03:25,160
good but in but if you get it it's
 

2903
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:26,710
good but in but if you get it it's
actually a dystopian

2904
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:26,720
actually a dystopian
 

2905
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,430
actually a dystopian
situation so you know you could sort of

2906

01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:33,349
situation so you know you could sort of
run a sort of uh hesis of like if you

2908
01:03:33,349 --> 01:03:33,359
run a sort of uh hesis of like if you

wish for World Peace sounds goodh but
 

2911
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:38,510
wish for World Peace sounds goodh but
how is it

2912
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:38,520
how is it
 

2913
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:42,789
how is it
enforced and and at what cost is is what

2914
01:03:42,789 --> 01:03:42,799
enforced and and at what cost is is what
 

2915
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:45,510
enforced and and at what cost is is what
at what cost Eternal peace it might

2916
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:45,520
at what cost Eternal peace it might
 

2917
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,309
at what cost Eternal peace it might
actually be worse to have eternal peace

2918
01:03:47,309 --> 01:03:47,319
actually be worse to have eternal peace
 

2919
01:03:47,319 --> 01:03:50,109
actually be worse to have eternal peace
because of what that would entail the

2920
01:03:50,109 --> 01:03:50,119
because of what that would entail the
 

2921
01:03:50,119 --> 01:03:51,870
because of what that would entail the
suppression of

Experience you know there's actually a
 

2971
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:55,710
Experience you know there's actually a
real drug called soma there is

go to Brave New World we could ask it
 

2979
01:05:03,559 --> 01:05:06,150
go to Brave New World we could ask it
what what would be the question tell us

2980
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:06,160
what what would be the question tell us
 

2981
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:09,789
what what would be the question tell us
about the drug called soma tell us about

2982
01:05:09,789 --> 01:05:09,799
about the drug called soma tell us about
 

2983
01:05:09,799 --> 01:05:11,870
about the drug called soma tell us about
the drug called

2984

the drug called
 

2985
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:14,349
the drug called
Som it's going to go to Brave New World

2986

Som it's going to go to Brave New World
I think well there's a real drug as well

2988
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:17,799
I think well there's a real drug as well
 

2989
01:05:17,799 --> 01:05:21,549
I think well there's a real drug as well
searching for so much drug

2990
01:05:21,549 --> 01:05:21,559

 

2991
01:05:21,559 --> 01:05:25,829

information oh boy ah s the wonder drug

2992
01:05:25,829 --> 01:05:25,839
information oh boy ah s the wonder drug
 

2993
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:29,630
information oh boy ah s the wonder drug
by the way I'm in fun mode oh okay F yes

2994
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:29,640
by the way I'm in fun mode oh okay F yes
 

2995

it's a muscle relaxment that's been

2998
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:33,200
it's a muscle relaxment that's been
 

2999
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,269
it's a muscle relaxment that's been
around since the 1950s it's used to

3000
01:05:35,269 --> 01:05:35,279
around since the 1950s it's used to
 

3001
01:05:35,279 --> 01:05:37,150
around since the 1950s it's used to
treat muscle pain and discomfort and it

3002
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:37,160
treat muscle pain and discomfort and it
 

3003
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,950
treat muscle pain and discomfort and it
does this by altering the activity

3004
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:38,960
does this by altering the activity
 

3005
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:41,549
does this by altering the activity

it and the crazy thing is like you know
 

3177
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:06,110
it and the crazy thing is like you know
we do have a real drug called soma which

3178
01:09:06,110 --> 01:09:06,120
we do have a real drug called soma which
 

3179
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:08,550
we do have a real drug called soma which
kind of does is kind of like the drug in

3180
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:08,560
kind of does is kind of like the drug in
 

3181
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,910
kind of does is kind of like the drug in
the book and I'm like did they they must

3182
01:09:10,910 --> 01:09:10,920
the book and I'm like did they they must
 

3183
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:12,950
the book and I'm like did they they must
have name they must have named it after

3184
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:12,960
have name they must have named it after
 

3185
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:15,229
have name they must have named it after
probably probably some of the real drug

3186
01:09:15,229 --> 01:09:15,239
probably probably some of the real drug
 

3187
01:09:15,239 --> 01:09:18,030
probably probably some of the real drug
is quite effective on back pain so you

3188
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:18,040
is quite effective on back pain so you
 

3189
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:20,189
is quite effective on back pain so you
know about this drug this is

3190
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:20,199
know about this drug this is
 

3191
01:09:20,199 --> 01:09:22,630
know about this drug this is
fascinating okay cuz I had like a you

3192
01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:22,640
fascinating okay cuz I had like a you
 

3193
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:26,430
fascinating okay cuz I had like a you
know squashed uh dis in my C5 C6 so it

3194
01:09:26,430 --> 01:09:26,440
know squashed uh dis in my C5 C6 so it
 

3195
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:28,749
know squashed uh dis in my C5 C6 so it
takes the physical pain away but s here

3196
01:09:28,749 --> 01:09:28,759
takes the physical pain away but s here
 

3197
01:09:28,759 --> 01:09:30,550
takes the physical pain away but s here
it doesn't completely it it it reduces

3198
01:09:30,550 --> 01:09:30,560
it doesn't completely it it it reduces
 

3199
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,349
it doesn't completely it it it reduces
the amount of pain you feel but at the

3200
01:09:32,349 --> 01:09:32,359
the amount of pain you feel but at the
 

3201
01:09:32,359 --> 01:09:34,870
the amount of pain you feel but at the
expense of mental

3202
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:34,880
expense of mental
 

3203
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:38,829
expense of mental
acuity it DS your

3204
01:09:38,829 --> 01:09:38,839

 

3205
01:09:38,839 --> 01:09:41,309

mind just like just like the drug in the

3206
01:09:41,309 --> 01:09:41,319
mind just like just like the drug in the
 

3207
01:09:41,319 --> 01:09:43,749
mind just like just like the drug in the
book just like the drug in the book and

3208
01:09:43,749 --> 01:09:43,759
book just like the drug in the book and
 

3209
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:44,709
book just like the drug in the book and
hence the

3210
01:09:44,709 --> 01:09:44,719
hence the
 

3211
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:46,669
hence the
trade-off uh the thing that seems like

3212
01:09:46,669 --> 01:09:46,679
trade-off uh the thing that seems like
 

3213
01:09:46,679 --> 01:09:49,149
trade-off uh the thing that seems like
Utopia could be a distopia after all

3214
01:09:49,149 --> 01:09:49,159
Utopia could be a distopia after all
 

3215
01:09:49,159 --> 01:09:50,470
Utopia could be a distopia after all
yeah actually I was talking to a friend

3216
01:09:50,470 --> 01:09:50,480
yeah actually I was talking to a friend
 

3217
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:52,709
yeah actually I was talking to a friend
of mine

3218
01:09:52,709 --> 01:09:52,719
of mine
 

3219
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:55,709
of mine
um saying like would you really want

3220
01:09:55,709 --> 01:09:55,719
um saying like would you really want
 

3221
01:09:55,719 --> 01:09:57,870
um saying like would you really want
there to be no hate in the world like

3222
01:09:57,870 --> 01:09:57,880
there to be no hate in the world like
 

3223
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:01,630
there to be no hate in the world like
really none like I wonder why hate

3224
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:01,640
really none like I wonder why hate
 

3225
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:03,590
really none like I wonder why hate
evolved um I'm not saying we should

3226
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:03,600
evolved um I'm not saying we should
 

3227
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,310
evolved um I'm not saying we should
amplify ha it of course I think we

3228
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:05,320
amplify ha it of course I think we
 

3229
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,709
amplify ha it of course I think we
should try to minimize it but but none

3230
01:10:07,709 --> 01:10:07,719
should try to minimize it but but none
 

3231
01:10:07,719 --> 01:10:09,310
should try to minimize it but but none

3233
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:12,189
at
all there might be a reason for

01:10:12,189 --> 01:10:12,199
all there might be a reason for
 

3235
01:10:12,199 --> 01:10:15,189
all there might be a reason for
hate and suffering it's really

3236
01:10:15,189 --> 01:10:15,199
hate and suffering it's really
 

3237
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:17,750
hate and suffering it's really
complicated to consider that uh some

3238
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:17,760
complicated to consider that uh some
 

3239
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,510
complicated to consider that uh some
amount of human suffering is necessary

3240
01:10:19,510 --> 01:10:19,520
amount of human suffering is necessary
 

3241
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,270
amount of human suffering is necessary
for human

01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:24,149
flourishing is it possible to appreciate
the highest

3251
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,110

summarized there in a single statement
 

3253
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:36,709
summarized there in a single statement
from grock okay no highs no lows who

3254
01:10:36,709 --> 01:10:36,719
from grock okay no highs no lows who
 

3255
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:39,229
from grock okay no highs no lows who
knows that's almost the

01:10:45,470 --> 01:10:45,480
efficiently is a big Focus for xai
 

3261
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:48,910
efficiently is a big Focus for xai
uh what's the uh first of all what's the

3262
01:10:48,910 --> 01:10:48,920
uh what's the uh first of all what's the
 

3263
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:50,669
uh what's the uh first of all what's the
limit of what's possible in terms of

3264
01:10:50,669 --> 01:10:50,679
limit of what's possible in terms of
 

3265
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:53,270
limit of what's possible in terms of
efficiency there's this uh terminology

3266
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:53,280
efficiency there's this uh terminology
 

3267
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:57,110
efficiency there's this uh terminology
of useful productivity per watt like

3268
01:10:57,110 --> 01:10:57,120
of useful productivity per watt like
 

3269
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,669
of useful productivity per watt like
what have you learned from pushing the

3270
01:10:58,669 --> 01:10:58,679
what have you learned from pushing the
 

3271
01:10:58,679 --> 01:10:59,950
what have you learned from pushing the
limits of that well I I think it's

3272
01:10:59,950 --> 01:10:59,960
limits of that well I I think it's
 

3273
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:02,709
limits of that well I I think it's
helpful the tools of physics are very

3274
01:11:02,709 --> 01:11:02,719
helpful the tools of physics are very
 

3275
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:04,590
helpful the tools of physics are very
powerful and can be applied I think to

3276
01:11:04,590 --> 01:11:04,600
powerful and can be applied I think to
 

3277
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:07,590
powerful and can be applied I think to
almost any really any arena in life this

3278
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:07,600
almost any really any arena in life this
 

3279
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,510
almost any really any arena in life this
it's really just a critical thinking for

3280
01:11:10,510 --> 01:11:10,520
it's really just a critical thinking for
 

3281
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:13,030
it's really just a critical thinking for
something important you need to reason

3282
01:11:13,030 --> 01:11:13,040
something important you need to reason
 

3283
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,390
something important you need to reason
with from first principles and think

3284
01:11:14,390 --> 01:11:14,400
with from first principles and think
 

3285
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,310
with from first principles and think
about things in the limit One Direction

3286
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:16,320
about things in the limit One Direction
 

3287
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,790
about things in the limit One Direction
or the

3288
01:11:17,790 --> 01:11:17,800
or the
 

3289
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:22,350
or the
other so um in the limit even at the CF

3290
01:11:22,350 --> 01:11:22,360
other so um in the limit even at the CF
 

3291
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:24,070
other so um in the limit even at the CF
scale meaning even if you haest the

3292
01:11:24,070 --> 01:11:24,080
scale meaning even if you haest the
 

3293
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,950
scale meaning even if you haest the
entire power of the sun you will still

3294
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:25,960
entire power of the sun you will still
 

3295
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:28,990
entire power of the sun you will still
care about useful compute per

3296
01:11:28,990 --> 01:11:29,000
care about useful compute per
 

3297
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,630
care about useful compute per
wat so that's where I I think probably

3298
01:11:32,630 --> 01:11:32,640
wat so that's where I I think probably
 

3299
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,350
wat so that's where I I think probably
where things are headed from uh the

3300
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:34,360
where things are headed from uh the
 

3301
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:38,470
where things are headed from uh the
standpoint of AI is that we have a

3302
01:11:38,470 --> 01:11:38,480
standpoint of AI is that we have a
 

3303
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,669
standpoint of AI is that we have a
silicon shortage now that will

3304
01:11:40,669 --> 01:11:40,679
silicon shortage now that will
 

3305
01:11:40,679 --> 01:11:43,709
silicon shortage now that will
transition to a voltage Transformer

voltage Step Down Transformer shortage

3334
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:21,360
voltage Step Down Transformer shortage
 

3335
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,709
voltage Step Down Transformer shortage
probably in about a year and then just

3336
01:12:23,709 --> 01:12:23,719
probably in about a year and then just
 

3337
01:12:23,719 --> 01:12:25,629

electricity shortages in general in

3338
01:12:25,629 --> 01:12:25,639
electricity shortages in general in
 

3339
01:12:25,639 --> 01:12:27,830
electricity shortages in general in
about two years I I gave a speech for

3340
01:12:27,830 --> 01:12:27,840
about two years I I gave a speech for
 

3341
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,189
about two years I I gave a speech for
the sort of world Gathering of utility

3342
01:12:30,189 --> 01:12:30,199
the sort of world Gathering of utility
 

3343
01:12:30,199 --> 01:12:33,390
the sort of world Gathering of utility
companies electricity companies um and I

3344
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:33,400
companies electricity companies um and I
 

3345
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,629
companies electricity companies um and I
I said look you really need to prepare

3346
01:12:34,629 --> 01:12:34,639
I said look you really need to prepare
 

3347
01:12:34,639 --> 01:12:37,669
I said look you really need to prepare
for tribling of electricity demand um

3348
01:12:37,669 --> 01:12:37,679
for tribling of electricity demand um
 

3349
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:39,590
for tribling of electricity demand um
because all transport is going to go

3350
01:12:39,590 --> 01:12:39,600
because all transport is going to go
 

3351
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:42,030
because all transport is going to go
electric with the ironic exception of

3352
01:12:42,030 --> 01:12:42,040
electric with the ironic exception of
 

3353
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:46,830
electric with the ironic exception of
rockets and uh and and heating um will

3354
01:12:46,830 --> 01:12:46,840
rockets and uh and and heating um will
 

3355
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:47,870
rockets and uh and and heating um will
also go

3356
01:12:47,870 --> 01:12:47,880
also go
 

3357
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:51,629
also go
electric um so energy usage right now is

3358
01:12:51,629 --> 01:12:51,639
electric um so energy usage right now is
 

3359
01:12:51,639 --> 01:12:54,830
electric um so energy usage right now is
roughly 1/3 if very rough terms 1/3

3360
01:12:54,830 --> 01:12:54,840
roughly 1/3 if very rough terms 1/3
 

3361
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:59,709
roughly 1/3 if very rough terms 1/3
electricity 1/3 transport 1/3 heating um

3362
01:12:59,709 --> 01:12:59,719
electricity 1/3 transport 1/3 heating um
 

3363
01:12:59,719 --> 01:13:02,430
electricity 1/3 transport 1/3 heating um
and so in order for everything to go

3364
01:13:02,430 --> 01:13:02,440
and so in order for everything to go
 

3365
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:06,470
and so in order for everything to go
sustainable to go electric um you uh

3366
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:06,480
sustainable to go electric um you uh
 

3367
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:09,430
sustainable to go electric um you uh
need to Triple electricity output so I

3368
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:09,440
need to Triple electricity output so I
 

3369
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:11,709
need to Triple electricity output so I
encourage the utilities

3370
01:13:11,709 --> 01:13:11,719
encourage the utilities
 

3371
01:13:11,719 --> 01:13:16,270
encourage the utilities
to uh build more power plants and and

3372
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:16,280
to uh build more power plants and and
 

3373
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:19,790
to uh build more power plants and and
also to probably have well well not

3374
01:13:19,790 --> 01:13:19,800
also to probably have well well not
 

3375
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:21,350
also to probably have well well not
probably they should definitely buy more

3376
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:21,360
probably they should definitely buy more
 

3377
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:23,790
probably they should definitely buy more
batteries because the the grid current a

3378
01:13:23,790 --> 01:13:23,800
batteries because the the grid current a
 

3379
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:26,070
batteries because the the grid current a
size for Real Time load which is kind of

3380
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:26,080
size for Real Time load which is kind of
 

3381
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,310
size for Real Time load which is kind of
crazy cuz you know that means you got a

3382
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:28,320
crazy cuz you know that means you got a
 

3383
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,990
crazy cuz you know that means you got a
size for whatever the the peak

3384
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:30,000
size for whatever the the peak
 

3385
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,629
size for whatever the the peak
electricity demand is like the worst

3386
01:13:31,629 --> 01:13:31,639
electricity demand is like the worst
 

3387
01:13:31,639 --> 01:13:33,550
electricity demand is like the worst
second or the worst day of the year or

3388
01:13:33,550 --> 01:13:33,560
second or the worst day of the year or
 

3389
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:35,350
second or the worst day of the year or
you can have a brown out or

3390
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:35,360
you can have a brown out or
 

3391
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,470
you can have a brown out or
blackout and you we had that crazy

3392
01:13:37,470 --> 01:13:37,480
blackout and you we had that crazy
 

3393
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:39,350
blackout and you we had that crazy
blackout for several days in in in

3394
01:13:39,350 --> 01:13:39,360
blackout for several days in in in
 

3395
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,110
blackout for several days in in in
Austin

3396
01:13:41,110 --> 01:13:41,120
Austin
 

3397
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:45,350
Austin
um so uh because there's almost no

3398
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:45,360
um so uh because there's almost no
 

3399
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:48,350
um so uh because there's almost no
buffering of energy in the grid like if

3400
01:13:48,350 --> 01:13:48,360
buffering of energy in the grid like if
 

3401
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,390
buffering of energy in the grid like if
you've got a Hydro power plant you can

3402
01:13:50,390 --> 01:13:50,400
you've got a Hydro power plant you can
 

3403
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:53,910
you've got a Hydro power plant you can
buffer energy but otherwise um

3404
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:53,920
buffer energy but otherwise um
 

3405
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:55,189
buffer energy but otherwise um
it's all real

3406
01:13:55,189 --> 01:13:55,199
it's all real
 

3407
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:58,470
it's all real
time so with batteries you

3408
01:13:58,470 --> 01:13:58,480
time so with batteries you
 

3409
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:02,310
time so with batteries you
can you can produce energy at night and

3410
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:02,320
can you can produce energy at night and
 

3411
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,830
can you can produce energy at night and
use it during the day so you can

3412
01:14:04,830 --> 01:14:04,840
use it during the day so you can
 

3413
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:07,350
use it during the day so you can
buffer so I I I expect that there will

3414
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:07,360
buffer so I I I expect that there will
 

3415
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,590
buffer so I I I expect that there will
be very heavy usage of of batteries in

3416
01:14:09,590 --> 01:14:09,600
be very heavy usage of of batteries in
 

3417
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:10,870
be very heavy usage of of batteries in
the

3418
01:14:10,870 --> 01:14:10,880
the
 

3419
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,510
the
future because the peak to trough ratio

3420
01:14:13,510 --> 01:14:13,520
future because the peak to trough ratio
 

3421
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:17,430
future because the peak to trough ratio
for power plants is anywhere from 2 to 5

3422
01:14:17,430 --> 01:14:17,440
for power plants is anywhere from 2 to 5
 

3423
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:19,070
for power plants is anywhere from 2 to 5
you know so it's like lowest point to

3424
01:14:19,070 --> 01:14:19,080
you know so it's like lowest point to
 

3425
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,110
you know so it's like lowest point to
highest point so like batter is

3426
01:14:21,110 --> 01:14:21,120
highest point so like batter is
 

3427
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:22,910
highest point so like batter is
necessary to balance it out and then but

3428
01:14:22,910 --> 01:14:22,920
necessary to balance it out and then but
 

3429
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,590
necessary to balance it out and then but
the as you're saying is going to grow

3430
01:14:24,590 --> 01:14:24,600
the as you're saying is going to grow
 

3431
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,590
the as you're saying is going to grow
grow grow grow yeah and part of that is

3432
01:14:26,590 --> 01:14:26,600
grow grow grow yeah and part of that is
 

3433
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,629
grow grow grow yeah and part of that is
the

3434
01:14:28,629 --> 01:14:28,639
the
 

3435
01:14:28,639 --> 01:14:32,510
the
compute yes yes I mean electrification I

3436
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:32,520
compute yes yes I mean electrification I
 

3437
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:36,550
compute yes yes I mean electrification I
mean electrification of Transport uh and

3438
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:36,560
mean electrification of Transport uh and
 

3439
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,910
mean electrification of Transport uh and
and electric heating will be much bigger

3440
01:14:38,910 --> 01:14:38,920
and electric heating will be much bigger
 

3441
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:40,750
and electric heating will be much bigger
than AI at least in the short term in

3442
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:40,760
than AI at least in the short term in
 

3443
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:43,830
than AI at least in the short term in
the short term um but but even for for

3444
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:43,840
the short term um but but even for for
 

3445
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,830
the short term um but but even for for
AI you you really have a growing demand

3446
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:45,840
AI you you really have a growing demand
 

3447
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:48,629
AI you you really have a growing demand
for electricity for electric vehicles

3448
01:14:48,629 --> 01:14:48,639
for electricity for electric vehicles
 

3449
01:14:48,639 --> 01:14:51,149
for electricity for electric vehicles
and a growing demand for electricity for

3450
01:14:51,149 --> 01:14:51,159
and a growing demand for electricity for
 

3451
01:14:51,159 --> 01:14:54,070
and a growing demand for electricity for
to run the computers for AI mhm

3452
01:14:54,070 --> 01:14:54,080
to run the computers for AI mhm
 

3453
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,629
to run the computers for AI mhm
and so this is obviously leading going

3454
01:14:55,629 --> 01:14:55,639
and so this is obviously leading going
 

3455
01:14:55,639 --> 01:14:58,350
and so this is obviously leading going
lead to a electricity shortage how

3456
01:14:58,350 --> 01:14:58,360
lead to a electricity shortage how
 

3457
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,830
lead to a electricity shortage how

problem it will get solved just the
 

3481
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:31,910
problem it will get solved just the
question of how long it takes to solve

3482
01:15:31,910 --> 01:15:31,920
question of how long it takes to solve
 

3483
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:34,350
question of how long it takes to solve
it so at various points there's a limit

3484
01:15:34,350 --> 01:15:34,360
it so at various points there's a limit
 

3485
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:35,950
it so at various points there's a limit
some some kind of limiting factor to

3486
01:15:35,950 --> 01:15:35,960
some some kind of limiting factor to
 

3487
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:39,270
some some kind of limiting factor to
progress um and when with regard to

3488
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:39,280
progress um and when with regard to
 

3489
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,229
progress um and when with regard to
saying right now the limiting factor is

3490
01:15:41,229 --> 01:15:41,239
saying right now the limiting factor is
 

3491
01:15:41,239 --> 01:15:45,669
saying right now the limiting factor is
uh silicon chips um and that will we're

3492
01:15:45,669 --> 01:15:45,679
uh silicon chips um and that will we're
 

3493
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:48,470
uh silicon chips um and that will we're
going to then have more chips than we

3494
01:15:48,470 --> 01:15:48,480
going to then have more chips than we
 

3495
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:51,189
going to then have more chips than we
can actually plug in and turn on um

3496
01:15:51,189 --> 01:15:51,199
can actually plug in and turn on um
 

3497
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:54,110
can actually plug in and turn on um
probably in about a year um

3498
01:15:54,110 --> 01:15:54,120
probably in about a year um
 

3499
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:55,790
probably in about a year um
the the initial constraint being

3500
01:15:55,790 --> 01:15:55,800
the the initial constraint being
 

3501
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:58,189
the the initial constraint being
literally voltage step down Transformers

3502
01:15:58,189 --> 01:15:58,199
literally voltage step down Transformers
 

3503
01:15:58,199 --> 01:16:01,990
literally voltage step down Transformers
because you've got um power coming in at

3504
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:02,000
because you've got um power coming in at
 

3505
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,030
because you've got um power coming in at
three 300,000 volts and it's got to step

3506
01:16:05,030 --> 01:16:05,040
three 300,000 volts and it's got to step
 

3507
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:08,149
three 300,000 volts and it's got to step
all the way down eventually to around 7

3508
01:16:08,149 --> 01:16:08,159
all the way down eventually to around 7
 

3509
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:12,310
all the way down eventually to around 7
volts so it's a very big amount

3510
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:12,320
volts so it's a very big amount
 

3511
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:14,950
volts so it's a very big amount
of you know the voltage St down is

3512
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:14,960
of you know the voltage St down is
 

3513
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:18,430
of you know the voltage St down is
gigantic um so and and the industry is

3514
01:16:18,430 --> 01:16:18,440
gigantic um so and and the industry is
 

3515
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:21,830
gigantic um so and and the industry is
not used to Rapid

3516
01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:21,840
not used to Rapid
 

3517
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,709
not used to Rapid
growth okay let's talk about the

3518
01:16:23,709 --> 01:16:23,719
growth okay let's talk about the
 

3519
01:16:23,719 --> 01:16:25,189
growth okay let's talk about the
competition here you've shown concern

3520
01:16:25,189 --> 01:16:25,199
competition here you've shown concern
 

3521
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:27,870
competition here you've shown concern
about Google and Microsoft with open AI

3522
01:16:27,870 --> 01:16:27,880
about Google and Microsoft with open AI
 

3523
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:30,669
about Google and Microsoft with open AI
developing uh AGI how can you help

3524
01:16:30,669 --> 01:16:30,679
developing uh AGI how can you help
 

3525
01:16:30,679 --> 01:16:35,070
developing uh AGI how can you help
ensure with xai and uh Tesla AI work

3526
01:16:35,070 --> 01:16:35,080
ensure with xai and uh Tesla AI work
 

3527
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:36,350
ensure with xai and uh Tesla AI work
that it doesn't become a competitive

3528
01:16:36,350 --> 01:16:36,360
that it doesn't become a competitive
 

3529
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:38,470
that it doesn't become a competitive
race to AGI but it that is a

3530
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:38,480
race to AGI but it that is a
 

3531
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:41,189
race to AGI but it that is a
collaborative development of safe

3532
01:16:41,189 --> 01:16:41,199
collaborative development of safe
 

3533
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:44,550
collaborative development of safe
AGI well I mean I've been pushing for

3534
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:44,560
AGI well I mean I've been pushing for
 

3535
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,030
AGI well I mean I've been pushing for
some kind of regulatory oversight for a

3536
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:46,040
some kind of regulatory oversight for a
 

3537
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:47,470
some kind of regulatory oversight for a
long time I've been a somewhat of a

3538
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:47,480
long time I've been a somewhat of a
 

3539
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:49,910
long time I've been a somewhat of a
Cassandra on the subject for over a

3540
01:16:49,910 --> 01:16:49,920
Cassandra on the subject for over a
 

3541
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:54,149
Cassandra on the subject for over a
decade um I think we want to be be very

3542
01:16:54,149 --> 01:16:54,159
decade um I think we want to be be very
 

3543
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:58,669
decade um I think we want to be be very
careful in how we develop AI

3544
01:16:58,669 --> 01:16:58,679

 

3545
01:16:58,679 --> 01:17:02,110

um it's it's a it's a great power and

3546
01:17:02,110 --> 01:17:02,120
um it's it's a it's a great power and
 

3547
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:03,910
um it's it's a it's a great power and
with great power comes great

3548
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:03,920
with great power comes great
 

3549
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,470
with great power comes great
responsibility um I think it it would be

3550
01:17:06,470 --> 01:17:06,480
responsibility um I think it it would be
 

3551
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:09,790
responsibility um I think it it would be
wise for us to have at least um an

3552
01:17:09,790 --> 01:17:09,800
wise for us to have at least um an
 

3553
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:13,750
wise for us to have at least um an
objective third party who can be like a

3554
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:13,760
objective third party who can be like a
 

3555
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:16,350
objective third party who can be like a
referee that can go in and understand

3556
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:16,360
referee that can go in and understand
 

3557
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:18,310
referee that can go in and understand
what the various leading players are

3558
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:18,320
what the various leading players are
 

3559
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:21,830
what the various leading players are
doing with AI and even if there's no

3560
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:21,840
doing with AI and even if there's no
 

3561
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,870
doing with AI and even if there's no
enforcement ability they should they can

3562
01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:23,880
enforcement ability they should they can
 

3563
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:24,709
enforcement ability they should they can

3567
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:32,629
least voice concerns mhm um
publicly um you know Jeff Hinton for

3568
01:17:32,629 --> 01:17:32,639
publicly um you know Jeff Hinton for
 

3569
01:17:32,639 --> 01:17:36,070
publicly um you know Jeff Hinton for
example left Google and he voiced strong

3570
01:17:36,070 --> 01:17:36,080
example left Google and he voiced strong
 

3571
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:38,110
example left Google and he voiced strong
concerns but now he's not at Google

3572
01:17:38,110 --> 01:17:38,120
concerns but now he's not at Google
 

3573
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:41,229
concerns but now he's not at Google
anymore so who's going to voice the

3574
01:17:41,229 --> 01:17:41,239
anymore so who's going to voice the
 

3575
01:17:41,239 --> 01:17:44,830
anymore so who's going to voice the
concerns so I think I think there's I I

3576
01:17:44,830 --> 01:17:44,840
concerns so I think I think there's I I
 

3577
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:46,590
concerns so I think I think there's I I
I like I know Tesla gets a lot of

3578
01:17:46,590 --> 01:17:46,600
I like I know Tesla gets a lot of
 

3579
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:48,189
I like I know Tesla gets a lot of
regulatory oversight on the automotive

3580
01:17:48,189 --> 01:17:48,199
regulatory oversight on the automotive
 

3581
01:17:48,199 --> 01:17:51,430
regulatory oversight on the automotive
front I we're subject to I think over

3582
01:17:51,430 --> 01:17:51,440
front I we're subject to I think over
 

3583
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,189
front I we're subject to I think over
100 regulatory agencies Domestic Bally

3584
01:17:53,189 --> 01:17:53,199
100 regulatory agencies Domestic Bally
 

3585
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:56,229
100 regulatory agencies Domestic Bally
and internationally it's it's a lot you

3586
01:17:56,229 --> 01:17:56,239
and internationally it's it's a lot you
 

3587
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:58,149
and internationally it's it's a lot you
could fill this room with the all the

3588
01:17:58,149 --> 01:17:58,159
could fill this room with the all the
 

3589
01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:00,110
could fill this room with the all the
regulations that Tesla has to adhere to

3590
01:18:00,110 --> 01:18:00,120
regulations that Tesla has to adhere to
 

3591
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:01,070
regulations that Tesla has to adhere to
for

3592
01:18:01,070 --> 01:18:01,080
for
 

3593
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:04,990
for
automotive um same is true in you know

3594
01:18:04,990 --> 01:18:05,000
automotive um same is true in you know
 

3595
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,470
automotive um same is true in you know
for rockets and for you

3596
01:18:07,470 --> 01:18:07,480
for rockets and for you
 

3597
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:09,950
for rockets and for you
know um currently the limiting factor

3598
01:18:09,950 --> 01:18:09,960
know um currently the limiting factor
 

3599
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:12,310
know um currently the limiting factor
for SpaceX for Starship launch is

3600
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:12,320
for SpaceX for Starship launch is
 

3601
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,270
for SpaceX for Starship launch is
regulatory approval uh the fa has

3602
01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:14,280
regulatory approval uh the fa has
 

3603
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:15,669
regulatory approval uh the fa has
actually given their approval but we're

3604
01:18:15,669 --> 01:18:15,679
actually given their approval but we're
 

3605
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:18,709
actually given their approval but we're
waiting for fish and wildlife to uh

3606
01:18:18,709 --> 01:18:18,719
waiting for fish and wildlife to uh
 

3607
01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:20,110
waiting for fish and wildlife to uh
finish their analysis and give their

3608
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:20,120
finish their analysis and give their
 

3609
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:22,390
finish their analysis and give their
approval that's why I posted I want to

3610
01:18:22,390 --> 01:18:22,400
approval that's why I posted I want to
 

3611
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,310
approval that's why I posted I want to
buy a fish life

3612
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:25,320

yeah like why do you need a license for

3618
01:18:31,270 --> 01:18:31,280
yeah like why do you need a license for
 

3619
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:33,310
yeah like why do you need a license for
your fish I I don't

3620
01:18:33,310 --> 01:18:33,320
your fish I I don't
 

3621
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:35,590
your fish I I don't
know according to the rules I'm told you

3622
01:18:35,590 --> 01:18:35,600
know according to the rules I'm told you
 

3623
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,070
know according to the rules I'm told you
need some sort of fish license or

3624
01:18:38,070 --> 01:18:38,080
need some sort of fish license or
 

3625
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:40,229
need some sort of fish license or
something we effectively need a fish

3626
01:18:40,229 --> 01:18:40,239
something we effectively need a fish
 

3627
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:43,270
something we effectively need a fish
license go to

3628
01:18:43,270 --> 01:18:43,280
license go to
 

3629
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:45,750
license go to
Rocket and I'm like wait a second how

3630
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:45,760
Rocket and I'm like wait a second how
 

3631
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:48,110
Rocket and I'm like wait a second how
did the fish come into this picture yeah

3632
01:18:48,110 --> 01:18:48,120
did the fish come into this picture yeah
 

3633
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:50,790
did the fish come into this picture yeah
um I mean so some of the things like

3634
01:18:50,790 --> 01:18:50,800
um I mean so some of the things like
 

3635
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:54,110
um I mean so some of the things like
that that it's I feel like are so absurd

3636
01:18:54,110 --> 01:18:54,120
that that it's I feel like are so absurd
 

3637
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:55,990
that that it's I feel like are so absurd
that I want to do like a comedy sketch

3638
01:18:55,990 --> 01:18:56,000
that I want to do like a comedy sketch
 

3639
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,110
that I want to do like a comedy sketch
and Flash at the bottom this is all real

3640
01:18:59,110 --> 01:18:59,120
and Flash at the bottom this is all real
 

3641
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:02,189
and Flash at the bottom this is all real
this is actually what happened um you

3642
01:19:02,189 --> 01:19:02,199
this is actually what happened um you
 

3643
01:19:02,199 --> 01:19:03,550
this is actually what happened um you
know one of the things that was a bit of

3644
01:19:03,550 --> 01:19:03,560
know one of the things that was a bit of
 

3645
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:05,830
know one of the things that was a bit of
a challenge at one point is that they

3646
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:05,840
a challenge at one point is that they
 

3647
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:08,310
a challenge at one point is that they
were worried about uh a rocket hitting a

3648
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:08,320
were worried about uh a rocket hitting a
 

3649
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:12,910
were worried about uh a rocket hitting a
shock MH and um now the ocean's very big

3650
01:19:12,910 --> 01:19:12,920
shock MH and um now the ocean's very big
 

3651
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:15,910
shock MH and um now the ocean's very big
and uh how often do you see shars uh not

3652
01:19:15,910 --> 01:19:15,920
and uh how often do you see shars uh not
 

3653
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:18,149
and uh how often do you see shars uh not
that often you know as a percentage of

3654
01:19:18,149 --> 01:19:18,159
that often you know as a percentage of
 

3655
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:20,270
that often you know as a percentage of
ocean surface area shocks basically are

3656
01:19:20,270 --> 01:19:20,280
ocean surface area shocks basically are
 

3657
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:23,510
ocean surface area shocks basically are
zero and and and so then we will then we

3658
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:23,520
zero and and and so then we will then we
 

3659
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,550
zero and and and so then we will then we
said well how will we calculate the

3660
01:19:25,550 --> 01:19:25,560
said well how will we calculate the
 

3661
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,229
said well how will we calculate the
probability of telling a shark and

3662
01:19:27,229 --> 01:19:27,239
probability of telling a shark and
 

3663
01:19:27,239 --> 01:19:28,189
probability of telling a shark and
they're like well we can't give you that

3664
01:19:28,189 --> 01:19:28,199
they're like well we can't give you that
 

3665
01:19:28,199 --> 01:19:30,030
they're like well we can't give you that
information because they're worried

3666
01:19:30,030 --> 01:19:30,040
information because they're worried
 

3667
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:33,350
information because they're worried
about shark hunt shark fin Hunters uh

3668
01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:33,360
about shark hunt shark fin Hunters uh
 

3669
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,070
about shark hunt shark fin Hunters uh
going in hunting sharks I said well how

3670
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:35,080
going in hunting sharks I said well how
 

3671
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:37,149
going in hunting sharks I said well how
are we supposed to we're on the horns of

3672
01:19:37,149 --> 01:19:37,159
are we supposed to we're on the horns of
 

3673
01:19:37,159 --> 01:19:39,070
are we supposed to we're on the horns of
a dilemma then

3674
01:19:39,070 --> 01:19:39,080
a dilemma then
 

3675
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:41,590
a dilemma then
um then they said well there's another

3676
01:19:41,590 --> 01:19:41,600
um then they said well there's another
 

3677
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,990
um then they said well there's another
part of fishing Wildlife that can can do

3678
01:19:43,990 --> 01:19:44,000
part of fishing Wildlife that can can do
 

3679
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,189
part of fishing Wildlife that can can do
this analysis I'm like well why don't

3680
01:19:45,189 --> 01:19:45,199
this analysis I'm like well why don't
 

3681
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:46,910
this analysis I'm like well why don't
you give them the data like we don't

3682
01:19:46,910 --> 01:19:46,920
you give them the data like we don't
 

3683
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:48,470
you give them the data like we don't
they don't we don't trust them like

3684
01:19:48,470 --> 01:19:48,480
they don't we don't trust them like
 

3685
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,070
they don't we don't trust them like
excuse me you know they're literally in

3686
01:19:50,070 --> 01:19:50,080
excuse me you know they're literally in
 

3687
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,070
excuse me you know they're literally in
your department again this is actually

3688
01:19:52,070 --> 01:19:52,080
your department again this is actually
 

3689
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:55,590
your department again this is actually
what happened um and uh and and and can

3690
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:55,600
what happened um and uh and and and can
 

3691
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:58,070
what happened um and uh and and and can
you do an NDA or

3692
01:19:58,070 --> 01:19:58,080
you do an NDA or
 

3693
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,229
you do an NDA or
something eventually they managed to

3694
01:20:00,229 --> 01:20:00,239
something eventually they managed to
 

3695
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:02,430
something eventually they managed to
solve the internal quander and indeed uh

3696
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:02,440
solve the internal quander and indeed uh
 

3697
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:04,390
solve the internal quander and indeed uh
the probability of ofing a shock is

3698
01:20:04,390 --> 01:20:04,400
the probability of ofing a shock is
 

3699
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,830
the probability of ofing a shock is
essentially zero um then there's another

3700
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:07,840
essentially zero um then there's another
 

3701
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,750
essentially zero um then there's another
organization that I didn't realize

3702
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:09,760
organization that I didn't realize
 

3703
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:10,790
organization that I didn't realize
existed

3704
01:20:10,790 --> 01:20:10,800
existed
 

3705
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,870
existed
until you know a few months ago uh that

3706
01:20:13,870 --> 01:20:13,880
until you know a few months ago uh that
 

3707
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:15,229
until you know a few months ago uh that
cares about whether you we would

3708
01:20:15,229 --> 01:20:15,239
cares about whether you we would
 

3709
01:20:15,239 --> 01:20:17,750
cares about whether you we would
potentially hit a whale in international

3710
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:17,760
potentially hit a whale in international
 

3711
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:20,110
potentially hit a whale in international
waters now again you look at the surface

3712
01:20:20,110 --> 01:20:20,120
waters now again you look at the surface
 

3713
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:22,070
waters now again you look at the surface
of the look at the look at the Pacific

3714
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:22,080
of the look at the look at the Pacific
 

3715
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,390
of the look at the look at the Pacific
and say

3716
01:20:23,390 --> 01:20:23,400
and say
 

3717
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:25,629
and say
what percentage of the Pacific consists

3718
01:20:25,629 --> 01:20:25,639
what percentage of the Pacific consists
 

3719
01:20:25,639 --> 01:20:27,870
what percentage of the Pacific consists
of whale like he'll give you a big

3720
01:20:27,870 --> 01:20:27,880
of whale like he'll give you a big
 

3721
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:28,910
of whale like he'll give you a big
picture and like point out all the

3722
01:20:28,910 --> 01:20:28,920
picture and like point out all the
 

3723
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:30,310
picture and like point out all the
whales in this picture like I don't see

3724
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:30,320
whales in this picture like I don't see
 

3725
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:31,110
whales in this picture like I don't see
any

3726
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:31,120
any
 

3727
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:35,590
any
whales like basically 0% um and if our

3728
01:20:35,590 --> 01:20:35,600
whales like basically 0% um and if our
 

3729
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:36,990
whales like basically 0% um and if our
rocket does hit a whale which is

3730
01:20:36,990 --> 01:20:37,000
rocket does hit a whale which is
 

3731
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,270
rocket does hit a whale which is
extremely unlikely beyond all belief um

3732
01:20:40,270 --> 01:20:40,280
extremely unlikely beyond all belief um
 

3733
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:44,510
extremely unlikely beyond all belief um
that is the the Fate haded that's a well

3734
01:20:44,510 --> 01:20:44,520
that is the the Fate haded that's a well
 

3735
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:46,430
that is the the Fate haded that's a well
has some seriously bad luck you know

3736
01:20:46,430 --> 01:20:46,440
has some seriously bad luck you know
 

3737
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:50,149
has some seriously bad luck you know
that's like least lucky well ever um and

3738
01:20:50,149 --> 01:20:50,159
that's like least lucky well ever um and
 

3739
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:53,189
that's like least lucky well ever um and
um I mean this is quite absurd

3740
01:20:53,189 --> 01:20:53,199
um I mean this is quite absurd
 

3741
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:55,350
um I mean this is quite absurd
bureaucracy the bureaucracy of this

3742
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:55,360
bureaucracy the bureaucracy of this
 

3743
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:58,390
bureaucracy the bureaucracy of this
however it emerged yes well I mean one

3744
01:20:58,390 --> 01:20:58,400
however it emerged yes well I mean one
 

3745
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,510
however it emerged yes well I mean one
one of the things that's pretty wild is

3746
01:21:00,510 --> 01:21:00,520
one of the things that's pretty wild is
 

3747
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:03,870
one of the things that's pretty wild is
um for launching out of vanur in

3748
01:21:03,870 --> 01:21:03,880
um for launching out of vanur in
 

3749
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:06,510
um for launching out of vanur in
California we had to they were worried

3750
01:21:06,510 --> 01:21:06,520
California we had to they were worried
 

3751
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:09,430
California we had to they were worried
about uh seal procreation whether the

3752
01:21:09,430 --> 01:21:09,440
about uh seal procreation whether the
 

3753
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,629
about uh seal procreation whether the
seals would be dismayed by the Sonic

3754
01:21:11,629 --> 01:21:11,639
seals would be dismayed by the Sonic
 

3755
01:21:11,639 --> 01:21:13,910
seals would be dismayed by the Sonic
booms um now there have been a lot of

3756
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:13,920
booms um now there have been a lot of
 

3757
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:15,669
booms um now there have been a lot of
rockets launched out of vur and the seal

3758
01:21:15,669 --> 01:21:15,679
rockets launched out of vur and the seal
 

3759
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:18,430
rockets launched out of vur and the seal
population has uh steadily increased um

3760
01:21:18,430 --> 01:21:18,440
population has uh steadily increased um
 

3761
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:21,110
population has uh steadily increased um
so if anything rocket booms are an eord

3762
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:21,120
so if anything rocket booms are an eord
 

3763
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:23,229
so if anything rocket booms are an eord
eiac um based on the evidence if you

3764
01:21:23,229 --> 01:21:23,239
eiac um based on the evidence if you
 

3765
01:21:23,239 --> 01:21:25,870
eiac um based on the evidence if you
were to correlate rocket launchers with

3766
01:21:25,870 --> 01:21:25,880
were to correlate rocket launchers with
 

3767
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:28,310
were to correlate rocket launchers with
uh sealed population um nonetheless we

3768
01:21:28,310 --> 01:21:28,320
uh sealed population um nonetheless we
 

3769
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:32,470
uh sealed population um nonetheless we
were forced to kidnap a seal strap it to

3770
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:32,480
were forced to kidnap a seal strap it to
 

3771
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:33,350
were forced to kidnap a seal strap it to
a

3772
01:21:33,350 --> 01:21:33,360
a
 

3773
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:36,350
a
board put it headphones on the seal and

3774
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:36,360
board put it headphones on the seal and
 

3775
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:38,510
board put it headphones on the seal and
play Sonic Boom sounds to it to see if

3776
01:21:38,510 --> 01:21:38,520
play Sonic Boom sounds to it to see if
 

3777
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:40,229
play Sonic Boom sounds to it to see if
it would be

3778
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:40,239
it would be
 

3779
01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:42,430
it would be
distressed this is an actual thing that

3780
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:42,440
distressed this is an actual thing that
 

3781
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:47,350
distressed this is an actual thing that
happened this is actually real I have

3782
01:21:47,350 --> 01:21:47,360
happened this is actually real I have
 

3783
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:50,550
happened this is actually real I have
pictures I would love to see this yeah

3784
01:21:50,550 --> 01:21:50,560
pictures I would love to see this yeah
 

3785
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:52,310
pictures I would love to see this yeah
there I mean sorry there's a seal with

3786
01:21:52,310 --> 01:21:52,320
there I mean sorry there's a seal with
 

3787
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,950
there I mean sorry there's a seal with
headphones

3788
01:21:54,950 --> 01:21:54,960

 

3789
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:58,990

yes it's a seal with headphones strapped

3790
01:21:58,990 --> 01:21:59,000
yes it's a seal with headphones strapped
 

3791
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,590
yes it's a seal with headphones strapped
to a board and and like okay now the

3792
01:22:01,590 --> 01:22:01,600
to a board and and like okay now the
 

3793
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:04,350
to a board and and like okay now the
amazing part is how calm the seal was

3794
01:22:04,350 --> 01:22:04,360
amazing part is how calm the seal was
 

3795
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:06,070
amazing part is how calm the seal was
yeah because if I was a seal i' be like

3796
01:22:06,070 --> 01:22:06,080
yeah because if I was a seal i' be like
 

3797
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,629
yeah because if I was a seal i' be like
this is the

3798
01:22:07,629 --> 01:22:07,639
this is the
 

3799
01:22:07,639 --> 01:22:09,950
this is the
end they're definitely going to eat me

3800
01:22:09,950 --> 01:22:09,960
end they're definitely going to eat me
 

3801
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:13,310
end they're definitely going to eat me
yeah um how will the seal when seal goes

3802
01:22:13,310 --> 01:22:13,320
yeah um how will the seal when seal goes
 

3803
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:16,229
yeah um how will the seal when seal goes
back to other you know seal friends

3804
01:22:16,229 --> 01:22:16,239
back to other you know seal friends
 

3805
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:17,550
back to other you know seal friends
how's it going to explain that they

3806
01:22:17,550 --> 01:22:17,560
how's it going to explain that they
 

3807
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:18,830
how's it going to explain that they
never going to believe him never going

never going to believe him never going
to believe him that's why I'm like well

3810
01:22:20,390 --> 01:22:20,400
to believe him that's why I'm like well
 

3811
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:21,590
to believe him that's why I'm like well
you know it's sort of like it's like

3812
01:22:21,590 --> 01:22:21,600
you know it's sort of like it's like
 

3813
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:23,030
you know it's sort of like it's like
getting kidnapped by aliens get an anal

3828
01:22:37,390 --> 01:22:37,400
him that he gets St to a board and they
 

3829
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:39,310

put headphones on his

3830
01:22:39,310 --> 01:22:39,320
put headphones on his
 

3831
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:42,270
put headphones on his
ears and then let him

3832
01:22:42,270 --> 01:22:42,280
ears and then let him
 

3833
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:45,870
ears and then let him
go twice by the way we had do it

go twice by the way we had do it
 

3835
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:48,390
go twice by the way we had do it
twice they let him go twice we had to

twice they let him go twice we had to
 

3837
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,229
twice they let him go twice we had to
Capt the same seal well no different

3838
01:22:50,229 --> 01:22:50,239
Capt the same seal well no different
 

3839
01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:51,310

okay did did you uh did you get a seal

3842
01:22:53,590 --> 01:22:53,600
okay did did you uh did you get a seal
 

3843
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,870
okay did did you uh did you get a seal
of approval yeah exactly a seal of

3844
01:22:55,870 --> 01:22:55,880
of approval yeah exactly a seal of
 

3845
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:58,350
of approval yeah exactly a seal of
approval no I mean this is this is like

3846
01:22:58,350 --> 01:22:58,360
approval no I mean this is this is like
 

3847
01:22:58,360 --> 01:22:59,590
approval no I mean this is this is like
I don't think the public is quite aware

3848
01:22:59,590 --> 01:22:59,600
I don't think the public is quite aware
 

3849
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,030
I don't think the public is quite aware
of the the madness that goes

3850
01:23:02,030 --> 01:23:02,040
of the the madness that goes
 

3851
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:05,390
of the the madness that goes
on yeah it's yeah it's absurd freaking

seals with freaking headphones I mean
 

3855
01:23:07,639 --> 01:23:10,629
seals with freaking headphones I mean
this is the it's a good encapsulation of

3856
01:23:10,629 --> 01:23:10,639
this is the it's a good encapsulation of
 

3857
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:12,350
this is the it's a good encapsulation of
of the absurdity of human civilization

3858
01:23:12,350 --> 01:23:12,360
of the absurdity of human civilization
 

3859
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:15,790
of the absurdity of human civilization
seals and headphones yes uh what are the

3860
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:15,800
seals and headphones yes uh what are the
 

3861
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:18,390
seals and headphones yes uh what are the
pros and cons of open sourcing AI to you

3862
01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:18,400
pros and cons of open sourcing AI to you
 

3863
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,310
pros and cons of open sourcing AI to you
as another way to

3864
01:23:20,310 --> 01:23:20,320
as another way to
 

3865
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:23,510
as another way to
combat um you you know a company running

3866
01:23:23,510 --> 01:23:23,520
combat um you you know a company running
 

3867
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:27,550
combat um you you know a company running
away with

3868
01:23:27,550 --> 01:23:27,560

 

3869
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:32,310

AGI in order to run uh like really deep

3870
01:23:32,310 --> 01:23:32,320
AGI in order to run uh like really deep
 

3871
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:34,270
AGI in order to run uh like really deep
intelligence you need a lot of compute

3872
01:23:34,270 --> 01:23:34,280
intelligence you need a lot of compute
 

3873
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:36,030
intelligence you need a lot of compute
so it's not like you know you can just

3874
01:23:36,030 --> 01:23:36,040
so it's not like you know you can just
 

3875
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:39,870
so it's not like you know you can just
fire up a PC in your basement and be

3876
01:23:39,870 --> 01:23:39,880
fire up a PC in your basement and be
 

3877
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:44,870
fire up a PC in your basement and be
running AGI at least not yet

3878
01:23:44,870 --> 01:23:44,880

 

3879
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,750

um you know Gro was trained on

3880
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:47,760
um you know Gro was trained on
 

3881
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:51,350
um you know Gro was trained on
8,000 A1 100s running at Peak

3882
01:23:51,350 --> 01:23:51,360
8,000 A1 100s running at Peak
 

3883
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:53,830
8,000 A1 100s running at Peak
efficiency um

3884
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:53,840
efficiency um
 

3885
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:55,950
efficiency um
um and Rock's going to get a lot better

3886
01:23:55,950 --> 01:23:55,960
um and Rock's going to get a lot better
 

3887
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:57,790
um and Rock's going to get a lot better
by the way we we'll be more than

3888
01:23:57,790 --> 01:23:57,800
by the way we we'll be more than
 

3889
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:00,270
by the way we we'll be more than
doubling our compute every couple months

3890
01:24:00,270 --> 01:24:00,280
doubling our compute every couple months
 

3891
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:02,590
doubling our compute every couple months
for the next several months there's a

3892
01:24:02,590 --> 01:24:02,600
for the next several months there's a
 

3893
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:04,270
for the next several months there's a
nice write up of how it went from grock

3894
01:24:04,270 --> 01:24:04,280
nice write up of how it went from grock
 

3895
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:06,709
nice write up of how it went from grock
zero to grock one by

3896
01:24:06,709 --> 01:24:06,719
zero to grock one by
 

3897
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:09,910
zero to grock one by
Gro yeah like Gro just bragging making

3898
01:24:09,910 --> 01:24:09,920
Gro yeah like Gro just bragging making
 

3899
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:11,270
Gro yeah like Gro just bragging making
 up about

3900
01:24:11,270 --> 01:24:11,280
up about
 

3901
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:16,709
up about
itself just Gro Gro Gro

3902
01:24:16,709 --> 01:24:16,719

 

3903
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:19,669

yeah it's like a weird AI dating s

3904
01:24:19,669 --> 01:24:19,679
yeah it's like a weird AI dating s
 

3905
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:21,910
yeah it's like a weird AI dating s
exaggerates about itself no there's a

3906
01:24:21,910 --> 01:24:21,920
exaggerates about itself no there's a
 

3907
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:23,750
exaggerates about itself no there's a
there's a wrer of you know like where

3908
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:23,760
there's a wrer of you know like where
 

3909
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,510
there's a wrer of you know like where
where it stands now the history of its

3910
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:25,520
where it stands now the history of its
 

3911
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:29,590
where it stands now the history of its
development um and where it stands on on

3912
01:24:29,590 --> 01:24:29,600
development um and where it stands on on
 

3913
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,950
development um and where it stands on on
some benchmarks compared to the

3914
01:24:31,950 --> 01:24:31,960
some benchmarks compared to the
 

3915
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:34,950
some benchmarks compared to the
state-ofthe-art GPT 35 and so I mean

3916
01:24:34,950 --> 01:24:34,960
state-ofthe-art GPT 35 and so I mean
 

3917
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:37,950
state-ofthe-art GPT 35 and so I mean
there's uh you know there's a llama you

3918
01:24:37,950 --> 01:24:37,960
there's uh you know there's a llama you
 

3919
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:39,550
there's uh you know there's a llama you
you can open source once it's trained

3920
01:24:39,550 --> 01:24:39,560
you can open source once it's trained
 

3921
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:41,870
you can open source once it's trained
you can open source a model yeah for

3922
01:24:41,870 --> 01:24:41,880
you can open source a model yeah for
 

3923
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:43,270
you can open source a model yeah for
fine-tuning and all that kind of stuff

3924
01:24:43,270 --> 01:24:43,280
fine-tuning and all that kind of stuff
 

3925
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:45,109
fine-tuning and all that kind of stuff
like what do you is the pros and cons of

3926
01:24:45,109 --> 01:24:45,119
like what do you is the pros and cons of
 

3927
01:24:45,119 --> 01:24:50,430
like what do you is the pros and cons of
that of open sourcing based

3928
01:24:50,430 --> 01:24:50,440

 

3929
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:52,870

models um

3930
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:52,880
models um
 

3931
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:54,709
models um
I think the sammer to open

3932
01:24:54,709 --> 01:24:54,719
I think the sammer to open
 

3933
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:57,189
I think the sammer to open
sourcing I think perhaps with a slight

3934
01:24:57,189 --> 01:24:57,199
sourcing I think perhaps with a slight
 

3935
01:24:57,199 --> 01:24:59,629
sourcing I think perhaps with a slight
time delay you know I don't know six six

3936
01:24:59,629 --> 01:24:59,639
time delay you know I don't know six six
 

3937
01:24:59,639 --> 01:25:01,950
time delay you know I don't know six six
months even

3938
01:25:01,950 --> 01:25:01,960
months even
 

3939
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:05,030
months even
um I think I'm I'm generally in favor of

3940
01:25:05,030 --> 01:25:05,040
um I think I'm I'm generally in favor of
 

3941
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:07,629
um I think I'm I'm generally in favor of
open sourcing like bias towards open

3942
01:25:07,629 --> 01:25:07,639
open sourcing like bias towards open
 

3943
01:25:07,639 --> 01:25:09,550
open sourcing like bias towards open
sourcing

3944
01:25:09,550 --> 01:25:09,560
sourcing
 

3945
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:13,070
sourcing
um I mean it it is a concern to me that

3946
01:25:13,070 --> 01:25:13,080
um I mean it it is a concern to me that
 

3947

01:28:36,470 --> 01:28:36,480
years A lot has happened insan but
 

4101
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:38,270
years A lot has happened insan but
you're seeing the tension there like

4102
01:28:38,270 --> 01:28:38,280
you're seeing the tension there like
 

4103
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:42,070
you're seeing the tension there like
maybe delayed open source delayed I yeah

4104
01:28:42,070 --> 01:28:42,080
maybe delayed open source delayed I yeah
 

4105
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:45,229
maybe delayed open source delayed I yeah
like what is the source that is opening

4106
01:28:45,229 --> 01:28:45,239
like what is the source that is opening
 

4107
01:28:45,239 --> 01:28:46,550
like what is the source that is opening
you know what I mean like it there's

4108
01:28:46,550 --> 01:28:46,560
you know what I mean like it there's
 

4109
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:49,910
you know what I mean like it there's
basically it's a giant CSV

4110
01:28:49,910 --> 01:28:49,920
basically it's a giant CSV
 

4111
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:53,270
basically it's a giant CSV
file yeah yeah with a bunch of numbers

4112
01:28:53,270 --> 01:28:53,280
file yeah yeah with a bunch of numbers
 

4113
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:56,350
file yeah yeah with a bunch of numbers
yep um what do you do with that giant

4114
01:28:56,350 --> 01:28:56,360
yep um what do you do with that giant
 

4115
01:28:56,360 --> 01:29:01,149
yep um what do you do with that giant
file of numbers you know how do you

4116
01:29:01,149 --> 01:29:01,159
file of numbers you know how do you
 

4117
01:29:01,159 --> 01:29:04,229
file of numbers you know how do you
run like the amount of actual the lines

4118
01:29:04,229 --> 01:29:04,239
run like the amount of actual the lines
 

4119
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:07,390
run like the amount of actual the lines
of code is very small MH

4120
01:29:07,390 --> 01:29:07,400
of code is very small MH
 

4121
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:11,830
of code is very small MH
um and and most of the work um the

4122
01:29:11,830 --> 01:29:11,840
um and and most of the work um the
 

4123
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:15,109
um and and most of the work um the
software work is in the in the curation

4124
01:29:15,109 --> 01:29:15,119
software work is in the in the curation
 

4125
01:29:15,119 --> 01:29:17,030
software work is in the in the curation
of the data so it's like trying to

4126
01:29:17,030 --> 01:29:17,040
of the data so it's like trying to
 

4127
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:20,189
of the data so it's like trying to
figure out what data is separating good

4128
01:29:20,189 --> 01:29:20,199
figure out what data is separating good
 

4129
01:29:20,199 --> 01:29:22,590
figure out what data is separating good
data from Bad data like um like you

4130
01:29:22,590 --> 01:29:22,600
data from Bad data like um like you
 

4131
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:23,669
data from Bad data like um like you
can't just crawl the internet because

4132
01:29:23,669 --> 01:29:23,679
can't just crawl the internet because
 

4133
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:26,270
can't just crawl the internet because
there's a lot of junk out there m um a

4134
01:29:26,270 --> 01:29:26,280
there's a lot of junk out there m um a
 

4135
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:28,189
there's a lot of junk out there m um a
huge percentage of websites have more

4136
01:29:28,189 --> 01:29:28,199
huge percentage of websites have more
 

4137
01:29:28,199 --> 01:29:30,709
huge percentage of websites have more
noise than signal you know they're

4138
01:29:30,709 --> 01:29:30,719
noise than signal you know they're
 

4139
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:32,870
noise than signal you know they're
because they're just used for search

4140
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:32,880
because they're just used for search
 

4141
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:34,310
because they're just used for search
engine optimization they're literally

4142
01:29:34,310 --> 01:29:34,320
engine optimization they're literally
 

4143
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:37,430
engine optimization they're literally
just scam websites

4144
01:29:37,430 --> 01:29:37,440
just scam websites
 

4145
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:40,229
just scam websites
so um how do you by the way Ser to

4146
01:29:40,229 --> 01:29:40,239
so um how do you by the way Ser to
 

4147
01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:42,270
so um how do you by the way Ser to
interrupt get the signal separate the

4148
01:29:42,270 --> 01:29:42,280
interrupt get the signal separate the
 

4149
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:44,430
interrupt get the signal separate the
signal and noise on X it's such a

4150
01:29:44,430 --> 01:29:44,440
signal and noise on X it's such a
 

4151
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:46,030
signal and noise on X it's such a
fascinating source of

4152
01:29:46,030 --> 01:29:46,040
fascinating source of
 

4153
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:48,590
fascinating source of
data uh you know no offense to people

4154
01:29:48,590 --> 01:29:48,600
data uh you know no offense to people
 

4155
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:50,350
data uh you know no offense to people
posting on X but sometimes there's a

4156
01:29:50,350 --> 01:29:50,360
posting on X but sometimes there's a
 

4157
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:52,510
posting on X but sometimes there's a
little bit of noise yeah I think the

4158
01:29:52,510 --> 01:29:52,520
little bit of noise yeah I think the
 

4159
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:54,510
little bit of noise yeah I think the
signal noise could be greatly improved I

4160
01:29:54,510 --> 01:29:54,520
signal noise could be greatly improved I
 

4161
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:59,030
signal noise could be greatly improved I
me really all of the posts on the

4162
01:29:59,030 --> 01:29:59,040
me really all of the posts on the
 

4163
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,709
me really all of the posts on the
xplatform uh should be AI recommended

4164
01:30:01,709 --> 01:30:01,719
xplatform uh should be AI recommended
 

4165
01:30:01,719 --> 01:30:03,229
xplatform uh should be AI recommended
meaning like we should populate a vector

4166
01:30:03,229 --> 01:30:03,239
meaning like we should populate a vector
 

4167
01:30:03,239 --> 01:30:05,590
meaning like we should populate a vector
space around any given post uh compare

4168
01:30:05,590 --> 01:30:05,600
space around any given post uh compare
 

4169
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,709
space around any given post uh compare
that to the vector space around any user

4170
01:30:07,709 --> 01:30:07,719
that to the vector space around any user
 

4171
01:30:07,719 --> 01:30:10,430
that to the vector space around any user
and match the two MH

4172
01:30:10,430 --> 01:30:10,440
and match the two MH
 

4173
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:12,709
and match the two MH
um right now there is a little bit of AI

4174
01:30:12,709 --> 01:30:12,719
um right now there is a little bit of AI
 

4175
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:14,790
um right now there is a little bit of AI
used for

4176
01:30:14,790 --> 01:30:14,800
used for
 

4177
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:18,470
used for
the the the recommended posts but it's

4178
01:30:18,470 --> 01:30:18,480
the the the recommended posts but it's
 

4179
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:19,310
the the the recommended posts but it's
mostly

4180
01:30:19,310 --> 01:30:19,320
mostly
 

4181
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:22,270
mostly
heris um and if there's a reply where

4182
01:30:22,270 --> 01:30:22,280
heris um and if there's a reply where
 

4183
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:24,629
heris um and if there's a reply where
the the reply to a post could be much

4184
01:30:24,629 --> 01:30:24,639
the the reply to a post could be much
 

4185
01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:26,430
the the reply to a post could be much
better than the original post but it

4186
01:30:26,430 --> 01:30:26,440
better than the original post but it
 

4187
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:28,350
better than the original post but it
will according to the current rules of

4188
01:30:28,350 --> 01:30:28,360
will according to the current rules of
 

4189
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:30,149
will according to the current rules of
the system get almost no attention

4190
01:30:30,149 --> 01:30:30,159
the system get almost no attention
 

4191
01:30:30,159 --> 01:30:31,990
the system get almost no attention
compared to a primary

4192
01:30:31,990 --> 01:30:32,000
compared to a primary
 

4193
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,310
compared to a primary
post oh so a lot of that I I got the

4194
01:30:35,310 --> 01:30:35,320
post oh so a lot of that I I got the
 

4195
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:37,990
post oh so a lot of that I I got the
sense so a lot of the uh X algorithm has

4196
01:30:37,990 --> 01:30:38,000
sense so a lot of the uh X algorithm has
 

4197
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,990
sense so a lot of the uh X algorithm has
been open source and been written up

4198
01:30:39,990 --> 01:30:40,000
been open source and been written up
 

4199
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,310
been open source and been written up
about and it seems that there to be some

4200
01:30:42,310 --> 01:30:42,320
about and it seems that there to be some
 

4201
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:43,950
about and it seems that there to be some
machine learning it's disparate but

4202
01:30:43,950 --> 01:30:43,960
machine learning it's disparate but
 

4203
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:45,470
machine learning it's disparate but
there's some a little there's a little

4204
01:30:45,470 --> 01:30:45,480
there's some a little there's a little
 

4205
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:48,149
there's some a little there's a little
bit um but it needs to be entirely that

4206
01:30:48,149 --> 01:30:48,159
bit um but it needs to be entirely that
 

4207
01:30:48,159 --> 01:30:50,030
bit um but it needs to be entirely that
like at least in the like if if you

4208
01:30:50,030 --> 01:30:50,040
like at least in the like if if you
 

4209
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:51,229
like at least in the like if if you
explicitly follow someone that's one

4210
01:30:51,229 --> 01:30:51,239
explicitly follow someone that's one
 

4211
01:30:51,239 --> 01:30:53,830
explicitly follow someone that's one
thing but if you in terms of what is

4212
01:30:53,830 --> 01:30:53,840
thing but if you in terms of what is
 

4213
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:55,550
thing but if you in terms of what is
recommended uh from people that you

4214
01:30:55,550 --> 01:30:55,560
recommended uh from people that you
 

4215
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:58,149
recommended uh from people that you
don't follow that should all be AI I

4216
01:30:58,149 --> 01:30:58,159
don't follow that should all be AI I
 

4217
01:30:58,159 --> 01:31:00,270
don't follow that should all be AI I
mean it's a fascinating problem yeah so

4218
01:31:00,270 --> 01:31:00,280
mean it's a fascinating problem yeah so
 

4219
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:01,390
mean it's a fascinating problem yeah so
there's several aspects of it that's

4220
01:31:01,390 --> 01:31:01,400
there's several aspects of it that's
 

4221
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:03,470
there's several aspects of it that's
fascinating first so as the write up

4222
01:31:03,470 --> 01:31:03,480
fascinating first so as the write up
 

4223
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:06,109
fascinating first so as the write up
goes it first picks 1500 tweets from a

4224
01:31:06,109 --> 01:31:06,119
goes it first picks 1500 tweets from a
 

4225
01:31:06,119 --> 01:31:08,189
goes it first picks 1500 tweets from a
pool of hundreds of millions first all

4226
01:31:08,189 --> 01:31:08,199
pool of hundreds of millions first all
 

4227
01:31:08,199 --> 01:31:10,950
pool of hundreds of millions first all
that's fascinating because you have

4228
01:31:10,950 --> 01:31:10,960
that's fascinating because you have
 

4229
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:12,189
that's fascinating because you have
hundreds of millions of posts every

4230
01:31:12,189 --> 01:31:12,199
hundreds of millions of posts every
 

4231
01:31:12,199 --> 01:31:15,030
hundreds of millions of posts every
single day and it has to pick 1500 from

4232
01:31:15,030 --> 01:31:15,040
single day and it has to pick 1500 from
 

4233
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:17,990
single day and it has to pick 1500 from
which it then does obviously people you

4234
01:31:17,990 --> 01:31:18,000
which it then does obviously people you
 

4235
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,510
which it then does obviously people you
follow but then there's also like some

4236
01:31:19,510 --> 01:31:19,520
follow but then there's also like some
 

4237
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:21,430
follow but then there's also like some
kind of clustering it has to do to

4238
01:31:21,430 --> 01:31:21,440
kind of clustering it has to do to
 

4239
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:23,830
kind of clustering it has to do to
figure out what kind of human are you

4240
01:31:23,830 --> 01:31:23,840
figure out what kind of human are you
 

4241
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:25,229
figure out what kind of human are you
what kind of new clusters might be

4242
01:31:25,229 --> 01:31:25,239
what kind of new clusters might be
 

4243
01:31:25,239 --> 01:31:27,790
what kind of new clusters might be
relevant to you people like you this

4244
01:31:27,790 --> 01:31:27,800
relevant to you people like you this
 

4245
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:29,270
relevant to you people like you this
this kind of this kind of problem is

4246
01:31:29,270 --> 01:31:29,280
this kind of this kind of problem is
 

4247
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:30,390
this kind of this kind of problem is
just fascinating because it has to then

4248
01:31:30,390 --> 01:31:30,400
just fascinating because it has to then
 

4249
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:34,870
just fascinating because it has to then
rank those 1500 MH with some with some

4250
01:31:34,870 --> 01:31:34,880
rank those 1500 MH with some with some
 

4251
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:37,830
rank those 1500 MH with some with some
filtering yeah and then recommend you

4252
01:31:37,830 --> 01:31:37,840
filtering yeah and then recommend you
 

4253
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:41,109
filtering yeah and then recommend you
just a handful and um to me what's

4254
01:31:41,109 --> 01:31:41,119
just a handful and um to me what's
 

4255
01:31:41,119 --> 01:31:42,910
just a handful and um to me what's
really fascinating is how fast I to do

4256
01:31:42,910 --> 01:31:42,920
really fascinating is how fast I to do
 

4257
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:45,149
really fascinating is how fast I to do
that so currently that entire pipeline

4258
01:31:45,149 --> 01:31:45,159
that so currently that entire pipeline
 

4259
01:31:45,159 --> 01:31:47,990
that so currently that entire pipeline
to go from several hundreds million to a

4260
01:31:47,990 --> 01:31:48,000
to go from several hundreds million to a
 

4261
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,990
to go from several hundreds million to a
handful is takes 220 seconds of CPU time

4262
01:31:51,990 --> 01:31:52,000
handful is takes 220 seconds of CPU time
 

4263
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,990
handful is takes 220 seconds of CPU time
single CPU time yeah and then it has to

4264
01:31:54,990 --> 01:31:55,000
single CPU time yeah and then it has to
 

4265
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,590
single CPU time yeah and then it has to
do that in like a second so it has to be

4266
01:31:57,590 --> 01:31:57,600
do that in like a second so it has to be
 

4267
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:00,390
do that in like a second so it has to be
like super distributed in fascinating

4268
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:00,400
like super distributed in fascinating
 

4269
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:03,669
like super distributed in fascinating
ways like there's just a lot of tweets

4270
01:32:03,669 --> 01:32:03,679
ways like there's just a lot of tweets
 

4271
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:05,310
ways like there's just a lot of tweets
there's a lot there's a lot of stuff on

4272
01:32:05,310 --> 01:32:05,320
there's a lot there's a lot of stuff on
 

4273
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:07,470
there's a lot there's a lot of stuff on
the system and and I think but I think

4274
01:32:07,470 --> 01:32:07,480
the system and and I think but I think
 

4275
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:09,430
the system and and I think but I think
it right now it's it's not currently

4276
01:32:09,430 --> 01:32:09,440
it right now it's it's not currently
 

4277
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:12,669
it right now it's it's not currently
good at recommending things that from

4278
01:32:12,669 --> 01:32:12,679
good at recommending things that from
 

4279
01:32:12,679 --> 01:32:16,310
good at recommending things that from
accounts you don't follow yeah um or or

4280
01:32:16,310 --> 01:32:16,320
accounts you don't follow yeah um or or
 

4281
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:19,390
accounts you don't follow yeah um or or
where there's more than one degree of

4282
01:32:19,390 --> 01:32:19,400
where there's more than one degree of
 

4283
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:21,709
where there's more than one degree of
separation so you know it's it's pretty

4284
01:32:21,709 --> 01:32:21,719
separation so you know it's it's pretty
 

4285
01:32:21,719 --> 01:32:23,709
separation so you know it's it's pretty
Prett good if if there's at least like

4286
01:32:23,709 --> 01:32:23,719
Prett good if if there's at least like
 

4287
01:32:23,719 --> 01:32:25,629
Prett good if if there's at least like
some commonality between someone you

4288
01:32:25,629 --> 01:32:25,639
some commonality between someone you
 

4289
01:32:25,639 --> 01:32:29,590
some commonality between someone you
follow liked something um or reposted it

4290
01:32:29,590 --> 01:32:29,600
follow liked something um or reposted it

net yeah yeah that's what it should be

4320
01:33:06,830 --> 01:33:06,840
net yeah yeah that's what it should be
 

4321
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:08,310
net yeah yeah that's what it should be
so you you for the

4322
01:33:08,310 --> 01:33:08,320
so you you for the
 

4323
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:12,070

vector correlation
 

4327
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:16,910
vector correlation
like there's a series of vectors you

4328
01:33:16,910 --> 01:33:16,920
like there's a series of vectors you
 

4329
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:19,430
like there's a series of vectors you
know basically parameters vectors

4330
01:33:19,430 --> 01:33:19,440
know basically parameters vectors
 

4331
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:21,669
know basically parameters vectors
whatever you want to call them um but

01:33:21,669 --> 01:33:21,679
whatever you want to call them um but
 

4333
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:23,950
whatever you want to call them um but
but sort of things that the system knows

4334
01:33:23,950 --> 01:33:23,960
but sort of things that the system knows
 

4335
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:26,229
but sort of things that the system knows
that you like

4336
01:33:26,229 --> 01:33:26,239
that you like
 

4337
01:33:26,239 --> 01:33:28,189
that you like
um like maybe there's like several

4338
01:33:28,189 --> 01:33:28,199
um like maybe there's like several
 

4339
01:33:28,199 --> 01:33:30,350
um like maybe there's like several
hundred sort of vectors associated with

4340
01:33:30,350 --> 01:33:30,360
hundred sort of vectors associated with
 

4341
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:34,189
hundred sort of vectors associated with
each user account and then uh any post

4342
01:33:34,189 --> 01:33:34,199
each user account and then uh any post
 

4343
01:33:34,199 --> 01:33:38,790
each user account and then uh any post
in the system um whether it's video

4344
01:33:38,790 --> 01:33:38,800
in the system um whether it's video
 

4345
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:41,750
in the system um whether it's video

reason I by the way want to move away

4348
01:33:43,510 --> 01:33:43,520
reason I by the way want to move away
 

4349
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:46,109
reason I by the way want to move away
from tweet is that you know people are

4350
01:33:46,109 --> 01:33:46,119
from tweet is that you know people are
 

4351
01:33:46,119 --> 01:33:48,189
from tweet is that you know people are
posting like two three hour videos on

4352
01:33:48,189 --> 01:33:48,199
posting like two three hour videos on
 

4353
01:33:48,199 --> 01:33:50,830
posting like two three hour videos on
the site that's not a tweet like they be

4354
01:33:50,830 --> 01:33:50,840
the site that's not a tweet like they be
 

4355
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:53,910
the site that's not a tweet like they be
like tweet for 2 hours come on tweet

4356
01:33:53,910 --> 01:33:53,920
like tweet for 2 hours come on tweet
 

4357
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,870
like tweet for 2 hours come on tweet
made sense when it was like 140

4358
01:33:55,870 --> 01:33:55,880
made sense when it was like 140
 

4359
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:59,149
made sense when it was like 140
characters of text mm cuz it's like a

4360
01:33:59,149 --> 01:33:59,159
characters of text mm cuz it's like a
 

4361
01:33:59,159 --> 01:34:01,790
characters of text mm cuz it's like a
bunch of TW like little birds tweeting

4362
01:34:01,790 --> 01:34:01,800
bunch of TW like little birds tweeting
 

4363
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:03,750
bunch of TW like little birds tweeting
um but when you've got long form content

4364
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:03,760
um but when you've got long form content
 

4365
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:07,030
um but when you've got long form content
it's no longer a tweet yeah um so a

4366
01:34:07,030 --> 01:34:07,040
it's no longer a tweet yeah um so a
 

4367
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:09,310
it's no longer a tweet yeah um so a
movie is not a tweet and like you know

4368
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:09,320
movie is not a tweet and like you know
 

4369
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:11,950
movie is not a tweet and like you know
Apple for example posted like the entire

4370
01:34:11,950 --> 01:34:11,960
Apple for example posted like the entire
 

4371
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:15,070
Apple for example posted like the entire
episode of The Silo the entire thing on

4372
01:34:15,070 --> 01:34:15,080
episode of The Silo the entire thing on
 

4373
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:17,070
episode of The Silo the entire thing on
our platform and by the way was it was

4374
01:34:17,070 --> 01:34:17,080
our platform and by the way was it was
 

4375
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:19,669
our platform and by the way was it was
their number one social media thing ever

4376
01:34:19,669 --> 01:34:19,679
their number one social media thing ever
 

4377
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:22,350
their number one social media thing ever
in engagement of anything on any

4378
01:34:22,350 --> 01:34:22,360
in engagement of anything on any
 

4379
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:24,830
in engagement of anything on any
platform ever so it was a great idea and

4380
01:34:24,830 --> 01:34:24,840
platform ever so it was a great idea and
 

4381
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:26,109
platform ever so it was a great idea and
by the way I done I just learned about

4382
01:34:26,109 --> 01:34:26,119
by the way I done I just learned about
 

4383
01:34:26,119 --> 01:34:27,910
by the way I done I just learned about
it afterwards I was like Hey wow they

4384
01:34:27,910 --> 01:34:27,920
it afterwards I was like Hey wow they
 

4385
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:30,430
it afterwards I was like Hey wow they

clever sort of joke dad joke is in the

4398
01:34:45,270 --> 01:34:45,280
clever sort of joke dad joke is in the
 

4399
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:48,149
clever sort of joke dad joke is in the
same pool as a three-hour video yeah I

4400
01:34:48,149 --> 01:34:48,159
same pool as a three-hour video yeah I
 

4401
01:34:48,159 --> 01:34:50,310
same pool as a three-hour video yeah I
mean right now it's it's a hodg Podge

4402
01:34:50,310 --> 01:34:50,320
mean right now it's it's a hodg Podge
 

4403
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:52,390
mean right now it's it's a hodg Podge
for that reason it's it's

4404
01:34:52,390 --> 01:34:52,400
for that reason it's it's
 

4405
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:55,790
for that reason it's it's
um but you know like if let's say in the

4406
01:34:55,790 --> 01:34:55,800
um but you know like if let's say in the
 

4407
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:57,550
um but you know like if let's say in the
case of Apple posting like an entire

4408
01:34:57,550 --> 01:34:57,560
case of Apple posting like an entire
 

4409
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:59,430
case of Apple posting like an entire
episode of of their series pretty good

4410
01:34:59,430 --> 01:34:59,440
episode of of their series pretty good
 

4411
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:03,550
episode of of their series pretty good
series by the way thiso um I watched it

4412
01:35:03,550 --> 01:35:03,560
series by the way thiso um I watched it
 

4413
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:07,070
series by the way thiso um I watched it
um so um there's going to be a lot of

4414
01:35:07,070 --> 01:35:07,080
um so um there's going to be a lot of
 

4415
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:09,070
um so um there's going to be a lot of
discussion around it so you you've got a

4416
01:35:09,070 --> 01:35:09,080
discussion around it so you you've got a
 

4417
01:35:09,080 --> 01:35:10,750
discussion around it so you you've got a
lot of context people commenting they

4418
01:35:10,750 --> 01:35:10,760
lot of context people commenting they
 

4419
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:11,990
lot of context people commenting they
like it they don't like it or they like

4420
01:35:11,990 --> 01:35:12,000
like it they don't like it or they like
 

4421
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,189
like it they don't like it or they like
this or you know and and you can then

4422
01:35:14,189 --> 01:35:14,199
this or you know and and you can then
 

4423
01:35:14,199 --> 01:35:15,830
this or you know and and you can then
populate the vector space based on the

4424
01:35:15,830 --> 01:35:15,840
populate the vector space based on the
 

4425
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:17,750
populate the vector space based on the
context of of all the comments around it

4426
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:17,760
context of of all the comments around it
 

4427
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,709
context of of all the comments around it
so even though it's a video uh there's a

4428
01:35:19,709 --> 01:35:19,719
so even though it's a video uh there's a
 

4429
01:35:19,719 --> 01:35:22,070
so even though it's a video uh there's a
lot of information around it that that

4430
01:35:22,070 --> 01:35:22,080
lot of information around it that that
 

4431
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:24,590
lot of information around it that that
allows you to popul back to the space of

4432
01:35:24,590 --> 01:35:24,600
allows you to popul back to the space of
 

4433
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:27,750
allows you to popul back to the space of
that that hourong video um and you can

4434
01:35:27,750 --> 01:35:27,760
that that hourong video um and you can
 

4435
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:29,550
that that hourong video um and you can
obviously get more sophisticated by

4436
01:35:29,550 --> 01:35:29,560
obviously get more sophisticated by
 

4437
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:32,270
obviously get more sophisticated by
having the AI actually watch the movie

4438
01:35:32,270 --> 01:35:32,280
having the AI actually watch the movie
 

4439
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:33,870
having the AI actually watch the movie
yeah right and tell you if you're going

4440
01:35:33,870 --> 01:35:33,880
yeah right and tell you if you're going
 

4441
01:35:33,880 --> 01:35:36,070
yeah right and tell you if you're going
to like the movie MH convert the movie

4443
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:38,510
to like the movie MH convert the movie
into like yeah into a language

4444
01:35:38,510 --> 01:35:38,520

recommend a movie and with high
 

4459
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:03,070
recommend a movie and with high
probability that you like it but this is

4460
01:36:03,070 --> 01:36:03,080
probability that you like it but this is
 

4461
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:05,870
probability that you like it but this is
like a a friend that's analyzing

like a a friend that's analyzing
 

4463
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:09,350
like a a friend that's analyzing
whatever hundred of millions yeah I mean

4464
01:36:09,350 --> 01:36:09,360
whatever hundred of millions yeah I mean
 

4465
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:10,910
whatever hundred of millions yeah I mean
actually frankly the AI will be better

4466
01:36:10,910 --> 01:36:10,920
actually frankly the AI will be better
 

4467
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:12,430
actually frankly the AI will be better
than will know you better than your

4468

Sayes too and and uh you know so so they
 

4511
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:02,870
Sayes too and and uh you know so so they
can do you can do something that's like

basically the question is do you regret
 

4519
01:37:11,679 --> 01:37:13,750
basically the question is do you regret
seeing it or not and if you don't regret

4520

seeing it or not and if you don't regret
 

4521

seeing it or not and if you don't regret
seeing it it's a

seeing it it's a
 

4523
01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:17,830
seeing it it's a
win how do you so there's a bunch of

4524
01:37:17,830 --> 01:37:17,840
win how do you so there's a bunch of
 

4525
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:21,830
win how do you so there's a bunch of
signals that are Incorporated hearts and

4526
01:37:21,830 --> 01:37:21,840
signals that are Incorporated hearts and
 

4527
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:24,310
signals that are Incorporated hearts and
reposts and maybe number of seconds you

4528
01:37:24,310 --> 01:37:24,320
reposts and maybe number of seconds you
 

4529
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:26,030
reposts and maybe number of seconds you
Linger on a post or something like this

4530
01:37:26,030 --> 01:37:26,040
Linger on a post or something like this
 

4531
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:28,270
Linger on a post or something like this
yeah attention is big a big factor

4532
01:37:28,270 --> 01:37:28,280
yeah attention is big a big factor
 

4533
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:29,950
yeah attention is big a big factor
attention so that's that's why it's like

4534
01:37:29,950 --> 01:37:29,960
attention so that's that's why it's like
 

4535
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:32,550
attention so that's that's why it's like
it's it's it is actually better to do

4536
01:37:32,550 --> 01:37:32,560
it's it's it is actually better to do
 

4537
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:35,590
it's it's it is actually better to do
things that are uh long form on the

4538
01:37:35,590 --> 01:37:35,600
things that are uh long form on the
 

4539
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:38,030
things that are uh long form on the
system because it's it's basically

4540
01:37:38,030 --> 01:37:38,040
system because it's it's basically
 

4541
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:40,430
system because it's it's basically
telling up how many user

4542
01:37:40,430 --> 01:37:40,440
telling up how many user
 

4543
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:43,350
telling up how many user
seconds you know users were interested

4544
01:37:43,350 --> 01:37:43,360
seconds you know users were interested
 

4545
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:45,229
seconds you know users were interested
in this thing for how many seconds so if

4546
01:37:45,229 --> 01:37:45,239
in this thing for how many seconds so if
 

4547
01:37:45,239 --> 01:37:48,790
in this thing for how many seconds so if
it's a really short thing well they will

4548
01:37:48,790 --> 01:37:48,800
it's a really short thing well they will
 

4549
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,430
it's a really short thing well they will
be less like if it's a link leading out

4550
01:37:50,430 --> 01:37:50,440
be less like if it's a link leading out
 

4551
01:37:50,440 --> 01:37:52,189
be less like if it's a link leading out
of the system which we're not opposed to

4552
01:37:52,189 --> 01:37:52,199
of the system which we're not opposed to
 

4553
01:37:52,199 --> 01:37:54,070
of the system which we're not opposed to
at all it just is going to have fewer

4554
01:37:54,070 --> 01:37:54,080
at all it just is going to have fewer
 

4555
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:56,589
at all it just is going to have fewer
user seconds than if that article was

4556
01:37:56,589 --> 01:37:56,599
user seconds than if that article was
 

4557
01:37:56,599 --> 01:37:59,350
user seconds than if that article was
posted on the xplatform how hard is it

4558
01:37:59,350 --> 01:37:59,360
posted on the xplatform how hard is it

president candidate to post on our
platform Community notes might be really

4874
01:44:24,790 --> 01:44:24,800
platform Community notes might be really
 

4875
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:26,189
platform Community notes might be really
fascinating there the interaction

4876
01:44:26,189 --> 01:44:26,199
fascinating there the interaction
 

4877
01:44:26,199 --> 01:44:28,709
fascinating there the interaction
Community notes is awesome that's hope

4878
01:44:28,709 --> 01:44:28,719
Community notes is awesome that's hope
 

4879
01:44:28,719 --> 01:44:29,790
Community notes is awesome that's hope
it holds

4880
01:44:29,790 --> 01:44:29,800
it holds
 

4881
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:32,950
it holds
up yeah again in in in a political

4882
01:44:32,950 --> 01:44:32,960
up yeah again in in in a political
 

4883
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:35,470
up yeah again in in in a political
climate where it's so divisive and so

4884
01:44:35,470 --> 01:44:35,480
climate where it's so divisive and so
 

4885
01:44:35,480 --> 01:44:38,310
climate where it's so divisive and so
there so many intensely viral posts yes

4886
01:44:38,310 --> 01:44:38,320
there so many intensely viral posts yes
 

4887
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:41,629
there so many intensely viral posts yes
Community notes it's like it seems like

4888
01:44:41,629 --> 01:44:41,639
Community notes it's like it seems like
 

4889
01:44:41,639 --> 01:44:43,470
Community notes it's like it seems like
a essential breath of fresh air yeah

4890
01:44:43,470 --> 01:44:43,480
a essential breath of fresh air yeah
 

4891
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:47,830
a essential breath of fresh air yeah
it's great um in fact the I no no system

4892
01:44:47,830 --> 01:44:47,840
it's great um in fact the I no no system
 

4893
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:49,270
it's great um in fact the I no no system
is going to be perfect but the the

4894
01:44:49,270 --> 01:44:49,280
is going to be perfect but the the
 

4895
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:50,629
is going to be perfect but the the
batting average of community notes is

4896
01:44:50,629 --> 01:44:50,639
batting average of community notes is
 

4897
01:44:50,639 --> 01:44:52,950
batting average of community notes is
incredibly good

4898
01:44:52,950 --> 01:44:52,960
incredibly good
 

4899
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:55,470
incredibly good
I've I I've actually frankly yet to see

4900
01:44:55,470 --> 01:44:55,480
I've I I've actually frankly yet to see
 

4901
01:44:55,480 --> 01:44:57,109
I've I I've actually frankly yet to see
an incorrect note that survived for more

4902
01:44:57,109 --> 01:44:57,119
an incorrect note that survived for more
 

4903
01:44:57,119 --> 01:44:58,910
an incorrect note that survived for more
than a few hours how do you explain why

4904
01:44:58,910 --> 01:44:58,920
than a few hours how do you explain why
 

4905
01:44:58,920 --> 01:45:02,669
than a few hours how do you explain why
it works yeah so the the the magic of

4906
01:45:02,669 --> 01:45:02,679
it works yeah so the the the magic of
 

4907
01:45:02,679 --> 01:45:05,030
it works yeah so the the the magic of
community notes is it requires people

4908
01:45:05,030 --> 01:45:05,040
community notes is it requires people
 

4909
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:07,669
community notes is it requires people
who have historically disagreed in how

4910
01:45:07,669 --> 01:45:07,679
who have historically disagreed in how
 

4911
01:45:07,679 --> 01:45:11,629
who have historically disagreed in how
they've rated notes so in order to um

4912
01:45:11,629 --> 01:45:11,639
they've rated notes so in order to um
 

4913
01:45:11,639 --> 01:45:14,550
they've rated notes so in order to um
write a note or rate you know and you

4914
01:45:14,550 --> 01:45:14,560
write a note or rate you know and you
 

4915
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:17,830
write a note or rate you know and you
have to rate many notes mhm um and

4916
01:45:17,830 --> 01:45:17,840
have to rate many notes mhm um and
 

4917
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:21,030
have to rate many notes mhm um and
so we could we actually do use

4918
01:45:21,030 --> 01:45:21,040
so we could we actually do use
 

4919
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:23,109
so we could we actually do use
AI here so we populated a vector space

4920
01:45:23,109 --> 01:45:23,119
AI here so we populated a vector space
 

4921
01:45:23,119 --> 01:45:26,750
AI here so we populated a vector space
around um how somebody has has rated

4922
01:45:26,750 --> 01:45:26,760
around um how somebody has has rated
 

4923
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:28,109
around um how somebody has has rated
notes in the past so it's not as simple

4924
01:45:28,109 --> 01:45:28,119
notes in the past so it's not as simple
 

4925
01:45:28,119 --> 01:45:29,270
notes in the past so it's not as simple
as left or right because there are many

4926
01:45:29,270 --> 01:45:29,280
as left or right because there are many
 

4927
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:31,310
as left or right because there are many
more life is much more complex than left

4928
01:45:31,310 --> 01:45:31,320
more life is much more complex than left
 

4929
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:34,870
more life is much more complex than left
or right um so there's a bunch of

4930
01:45:34,870 --> 01:45:34,880
or right um so there's a bunch of
 

4931
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:37,350
or right um so there's a bunch of
correlations in how you would how you

4932
01:45:37,350 --> 01:45:37,360
correlations in how you would how you
 

4933
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:40,189
correlations in how you would how you
rate Community notes post um Community

4934
01:45:40,189 --> 01:45:40,199
rate Community notes post um Community
 

4935
01:45:40,199 --> 01:45:41,629
rate Community notes post um Community
notes

4936
01:45:41,629 --> 01:45:41,639
notes
 

4937
01:45:41,639 --> 01:45:45,550
notes
so um then uh in order for a community

4938
01:45:45,550 --> 01:45:45,560
so um then uh in order for a community
 

4939
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:48,550
so um then uh in order for a community
note to actually be shown um people who

4940
01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:48,560
note to actually be shown um people who
 

4941
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:51,149
note to actually be shown um people who
historically have disagreed on a subject

4942
01:45:51,149 --> 01:45:51,159
historically have disagreed on a subject
 

4943
01:45:51,159 --> 01:45:54,109
historically have disagreed on a subject
must agree in order for a note to be

4944
01:45:54,109 --> 01:45:54,119
must agree in order for a note to be
 

4945
01:45:54,119 --> 01:45:56,990
must agree in order for a note to be
shown um that's the essential magic of

4946
01:45:56,990 --> 01:45:57,000
shown um that's the essential magic of
 

4947
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,350
shown um that's the essential magic of
it I mean but it's fascinating because

4948
01:45:59,350 --> 01:45:59,360
it I mean but it's fascinating because
 

4949
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:01,830
it I mean but it's fascinating because
there's a there's a pool of people that

4950
01:46:01,830 --> 01:46:01,840
there's a there's a pool of people that
 

4951
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:04,229
there's a there's a pool of people that
have disagreements and somehow they

4952
01:46:04,229 --> 01:46:04,239
have disagreements and somehow they
 

4953
01:46:04,239 --> 01:46:05,790
have disagreements and somehow they
collaborate through that process of

4954
01:46:05,790 --> 01:46:05,800
collaborate through that process of
 

4955
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:08,990
collaborate through that process of
disagreement to come up with context for

4956
01:46:08,990 --> 01:46:09,000
disagreement to come up with context for
 

4957
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,589
disagreement to come up with context for
to I mean fascinating it works yeah it

4958
01:46:11,589 --> 01:46:11,599
to I mean fascinating it works yeah it
 

4959
01:46:11,599 --> 01:46:14,589
to I mean fascinating it works yeah it
it kind of makes sense that that if

4960
01:46:14,589 --> 01:46:14,599
it kind of makes sense that that if
 

4961
01:46:14,599 --> 01:46:15,709
it kind of makes sense that that if
people who who in the past have

4962
01:46:15,709 --> 01:46:15,719
people who who in the past have
 

4963
01:46:15,719 --> 01:46:18,390
people who who in the past have
disagreed agree about something um it's

4964
01:46:18,390 --> 01:46:18,400
disagreed agree about something um it's
 

4965
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:19,189
disagreed agree about something um it's
probably

4966
01:46:19,189 --> 01:46:19,199
probably
 

4967
01:46:19,199 --> 01:46:21,149
probably
true yeah

4968
01:46:21,149 --> 01:46:21,159
true yeah
 

4969
01:46:21,159 --> 01:46:23,950
true yeah
I wonder is there is there possible

4970
01:46:23,950 --> 01:46:23,960
I wonder is there is there possible
 

4971
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:26,830
I wonder is there is there possible
somehow emergent thing there that could

4972
01:46:26,830 --> 01:46:26,840
somehow emergent thing there that could
 

4973
01:46:26,840 --> 01:46:29,830
somehow emergent thing there that could
challenge Wikipedia which Wikipedia is a

4974
01:46:29,830 --> 01:46:29,840
challenge Wikipedia which Wikipedia is a
 

4975
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:31,629
challenge Wikipedia which Wikipedia is a
different kind of thing which is more

4976
01:46:31,629 --> 01:46:31,639
different kind of thing which is more
 

4977
01:46:31,639 --> 01:46:33,790
different kind of thing which is more
like permanent articles about things

4978
01:46:33,790 --> 01:46:33,800
like permanent articles about things
 

4979
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:36,629
like permanent articles about things
well Wikipedia is very hierarchical uh

4980
01:46:36,629 --> 01:46:36,639
well Wikipedia is very hierarchical uh
 

4981
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:39,589
well Wikipedia is very hierarchical uh
whereas um Community notes is inherently

4982
01:46:39,589 --> 01:46:39,599
whereas um Community notes is inherently
 

4983
01:46:39,599 --> 01:46:43,589
whereas um Community notes is inherently
not uh there is no hierarchy like I the

4984
01:46:43,589 --> 01:46:43,599
not uh there is no hierarchy like I the
 

4985
01:46:43,599 --> 01:46:46,430
not uh there is no hierarchy like I the
ASD test is um I can't change a

4986
01:46:46,430 --> 01:46:46,440
ASD test is um I can't change a
 

4987
01:46:46,440 --> 01:46:47,709
ASD test is um I can't change a
community note if somebody put a gun to

4988
01:46:47,709 --> 01:46:47,719
community note if somebody put a gun to
 

4989
01:46:47,719 --> 01:46:48,629
community note if somebody put a gun to
my

4990
01:46:48,629 --> 01:46:48,639
my
 

4991
01:46:48,639 --> 01:46:51,189
my
head so

4992
01:46:51,189 --> 01:46:51,199
head so
 

4993
01:46:51,199 --> 01:46:53,870
head so
um and and any and community community

4994
01:46:53,870 --> 01:46:53,880
um and and any and community community
 

4995
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:57,910
um and and any and community community
notes uh has all the code is open source

4996
01:46:57,910 --> 01:46:57,920
notes uh has all the code is open source
 

4997
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:02,229
notes uh has all the code is open source
100% all the data is open source 100% so

4998
01:47:02,229 --> 01:47:02,239
100% all the data is open source 100% so
 

4999
01:47:02,239 --> 01:47:04,470
100% all the data is open source 100% so
you can completely recreate any note in

5000
01:47:04,470 --> 01:47:04,480
you can completely recreate any note in
 

5001
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:06,750
you can completely recreate any note in
the system

5002
01:47:06,750 --> 01:47:06,760
the system
 

5003
01:47:06,760 --> 01:47:09,070
the system
independently um so if there was any

5004
01:47:09,070 --> 01:47:09,080
independently um so if there was any
 

5005
01:47:09,080 --> 01:47:11,550
independently um so if there was any
interference you'd notice immediately by

5006
01:47:11,550 --> 01:47:11,560
interference you'd notice immediately by
 

5007
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:14,030
interference you'd notice immediately by
the way on on the on the topic of Gro

5008
01:47:14,030 --> 01:47:14,040
the way on on the on the topic of Gro
 

5009
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:15,550
the way on on the on the topic of Gro
it's actually pretty good at criticizing

5010
01:47:15,550 --> 01:47:15,560
it's actually pretty good at criticizing
 

5011
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:17,910
it's actually pretty good at criticizing
you which is great okay I asked what

5012
01:47:17,910 --> 01:47:17,920
you which is great okay I asked what
 

5013
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:20,550
you which is great okay I asked what
what has Elon Musk been wrong about I

5014
01:47:20,550 --> 01:47:20,560
what has Elon Musk been wrong about I
 

5015
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:22,950
what has Elon Musk been wrong about I
just it's actually yeah what does it say

5016
01:47:22,950 --> 01:47:22,960
just it's actually yeah what does it say
 

5017
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:26,870
just it's actually yeah what does it say
so it says mostly lists rigorously all

5018
01:47:26,870 --> 01:47:26,880
so it says mostly lists rigorously all
 

5019
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:28,390
so it says mostly lists rigorously all
the times you

5020
01:47:28,390 --> 01:47:28,400
the times you
 

5021
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:30,830
the times you
predicted like promised when something

5022
01:47:30,830 --> 01:47:30,840
predicted like promised when something
 

5023
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:32,870
predicted like promised when something
will be released and it wasn't released

5024
01:47:32,870 --> 01:47:32,880
will be released and it wasn't released
 

5025
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:34,189
will be released and it wasn't released
a strong word okay

5026
01:47:34,189 --> 01:47:34,199
a strong word okay
 

5027
01:47:34,199 --> 01:47:36,669
a strong word okay
predicted uh but the the opener is

5028
01:47:36,669 --> 01:47:36,679

important point that I think people who
 

5671
02:01:00,639 --> 02:01:03,149
important point that I think people who
are listening should bear in mind if if

now it's better than mainstream media

5744
02:02:37,390 --> 02:02:37,400
now it's better than mainstream media
 

5745
02:02:37,400 --> 02:02:40,069
now it's better than mainstream media
but it's still yeah mainstream media is

5746
02:02:40,069 --> 02:02:40,079
but it's still yeah mainstream media is
 

5747
02:02:40,079 --> 02:02:41,669
but it's still yeah mainstream media is
almost relentlessly negative about

almost relentlessly negative about
 

5749
02:02:41,679 --> 02:02:44,390
almost relentlessly negative about
everything um it's I mean really the

02:02:44,390 --> 02:02:44,400
everything um it's I mean really the
 

5751
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:45,910
everything um it's I mean really the
conventional news tries to answer the

5752
02:02:45,910 --> 02:02:45,920
conventional news tries to answer the
 

5753
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:47,310
conventional news tries to answer the
question what is the worst thing that I

5754
02:02:47,310 --> 02:02:47,320
question what is the worst thing that I
 

5755
02:02:47,320 --> 02:02:49,790
question what is the worst thing that I
happen on Earth today mhm and it's a big

5756
02:02:49,790 --> 02:02:49,800
happen on Earth today mhm and it's a big
 

5757
02:02:49,800 --> 02:02:52,589
happen on Earth today mhm and it's a big
world so on any given day something bad

5758
02:02:52,589 --> 02:02:52,599
world so on any given day something bad
 

5759
02:02:52,599 --> 02:02:55,229
world so on any given day something bad
has happened and a generalization of

5760
02:02:55,229 --> 02:02:55,239
has happened and a generalization of
 

5761
02:02:55,239 --> 02:02:56,910
has happened and a generalization of
that what is the worst perspective I can

5762
02:02:56,910 --> 02:02:56,920
that what is the worst perspective I can
 

5763
02:02:56,920 --> 02:03:00,310
that what is the worst perspective I can
take on a thing that happened so yeah

5764
02:03:00,310 --> 02:03:00,320
take on a thing that happened so yeah
 

5765
02:03:00,320 --> 02:03:01,790
take on a thing that happened so yeah
it's I don't know there's just a strong

5766
02:03:01,790 --> 02:03:01,800
it's I don't know there's just a strong
 

5767
02:03:01,800 --> 02:03:05,149
it's I don't know there's just a strong
negative bias in the news

5768
02:03:05,149 --> 02:03:05,159
negative bias in the news
 

5769
02:03:05,159 --> 02:03:08,030
negative bias in the news
um I mean I think there what a possible

5770
02:03:08,030 --> 02:03:08,040
um I mean I think there what a possible
 

5771
02:03:08,040 --> 02:03:11,950
um I mean I think there what a possible
explanation for this is evolutionary

5772
02:03:11,950 --> 02:03:11,960
explanation for this is evolutionary
 

5773
02:03:11,960 --> 02:03:15,189
explanation for this is evolutionary
um where you know bad news historically

5774
02:03:15,189 --> 02:03:15,199
um where you know bad news historically
 

5775
02:03:15,199 --> 02:03:18,430
um where you know bad news historically
would be potentially fatal like this

5776
02:03:18,430 --> 02:03:18,440
would be potentially fatal like this
 

5777
02:03:18,440 --> 02:03:19,910
would be potentially fatal like this
Lion of there or there's some other

02:03:25,510 --> 02:03:25,520
news you know like we found a patch of
 

5783
02:03:25,520 --> 02:03:27,669

berries is nice to have but not

5784
02:03:27,669 --> 02:03:27,679
berries is nice to have but not
 

5785
02:03:27,679 --> 02:03:29,790

so our old friend Tesla autopilot it's

5788
02:03:34,390 --> 02:03:34,400
so our old friend Tesla autopilot it's
 

5789
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:35,550
so our old friend Tesla autopilot it's
probably one of the most intelligent

5790
02:03:35,550 --> 02:03:35,560
probably one of the most intelligent
 

5791
02:03:35,560 --> 02:03:38,189
probably one of the most intelligent
real world AI systems in the world right

5792
02:03:38,189 --> 02:03:38,199
real world AI systems in the world right
 

5793
02:03:38,199 --> 02:03:39,750
real world AI systems in the world right
you followed it from the

5794
02:03:39,750 --> 02:03:39,760
you followed it from the
 

5795
02:03:39,760 --> 02:03:41,589
you followed it from the
beginning yeah it was one of the most

5796
02:03:41,589 --> 02:03:41,599
beginning yeah it was one of the most
 

5797
02:03:41,599 --> 02:03:43,069
beginning yeah it was one of the most
incredible robots in the world and

5798
02:03:43,069 --> 02:03:43,079
incredible robots in the world and
 

5799
02:03:43,079 --> 02:03:44,790
incredible robots in the world and
continues to be yeah and it was really

5800
02:03:44,790 --> 02:03:44,800
continues to be yeah and it was really
 

5801
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:47,510
continues to be yeah and it was really
exciting and it was super exciting when

5802
02:03:47,510 --> 02:03:47,520
exciting and it was super exciting when
 

5803
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:49,830
exciting and it was super exciting when
it generalized

5804
02:03:49,830 --> 02:03:49,840
it generalized
 

5805
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:52,390
it generalized
became more than a robot on four wheels

5806
02:03:52,390 --> 02:03:52,400
became more than a robot on four wheels
 

5807
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:55,549
became more than a robot on four wheels
but uh a real world AI system that

5808
02:03:55,549 --> 02:03:55,559
but uh a real world AI system that
 

5809
02:03:55,559 --> 02:03:59,069
but uh a real world AI system that
perceives the world yeah and has can

5810
02:03:59,069 --> 02:03:59,079
perceives the world yeah and has can
 

5811
02:03:59,079 --> 02:04:01,030
perceives the world yeah and has can
have potentially different

02:04:01,030 --> 02:04:01,040
have potentially different
 

5813
02:04:01,040 --> 02:04:03,149
have potentially different
embodiments well I mean the really wild

5814
02:04:03,149 --> 02:04:03,159
embodiments well I mean the really wild
 

5815
02:04:03,159 --> 02:04:05,589
embodiments well I mean the really wild
thing about the anti- training is that

5816
02:04:05,589 --> 02:04:05,599
thing about the anti- training is that
 

5817
02:04:05,599 --> 02:04:07,470
thing about the anti- training is that
it like it learns to read like you can

5818
02:04:07,470 --> 02:04:07,480
it like it learns to read like you can
 

5819
02:04:07,480 --> 02:04:11,470
it like it learns to read like you can
read science but we never taught it to

5820
02:04:11,470 --> 02:04:11,480
read science but we never taught it to
 

5821
02:04:11,480 --> 02:04:13,870
read science but we never taught it to
read

5822
02:04:13,870 --> 02:04:13,880
read
 

5823
02:04:13,880 --> 02:04:16,910
read
so yeah we never Tau it what we never

5824
02:04:16,910 --> 02:04:16,920
so yeah we never Tau it what we never
 

5825
02:04:16,920 --> 02:04:19,109
so yeah we never Tau it what we never
Tau it what a car was or what a person

5826
02:04:19,109 --> 02:04:19,119
Tau it what a car was or what a person
 

5827
02:04:19,119 --> 02:04:21,669
Tau it what a car was or what a person
was or VI

5828
02:04:21,669 --> 02:04:21,679

02:04:23,510 --> 02:04:23,520
cyclist uh it
 

5831
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:26,629

leared what what all those things are

5832
02:04:26,629 --> 02:04:26,639
leared what what all those things are
 

5833
02:04:26,639 --> 02:04:28,470
leared what what all those things are
what all the objects are on the

02:04:28,470 --> 02:04:28,480
what all the objects are on the
 

5835
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:31,669
what all the objects are on the
road um from video just from watching

reaching our brain is from our eyes um
 

5845
02:04:44,199 --> 02:04:45,549
reaching our brain is from our eyes um
and you say well what's the output the

5846
02:04:45,549 --> 02:04:45,559
and you say well what's the output the
 

5847
02:04:45,559 --> 02:04:49,189
and you say well what's the output the
output is our motor signals to our sort

02:05:03,189 --> 02:05:03,199
car but by looking at the sequence of
 

5859
02:05:03,199 --> 02:05:06,830
car but by looking at the sequence of

recently where he talked about llm

5864
02:05:10,030 --> 02:05:10,040
recently where he talked about llm
 

5865
02:05:10,040 --> 02:05:12,069
recently where he talked about llm
forming a world model and basically

5866
02:05:12,069 --> 02:05:12,079
forming a world model and basically
 

5867
02:05:12,079 --> 02:05:13,790
forming a world model and basically
language is a projection of that world

5868
02:05:13,790 --> 02:05:13,800
language is a projection of that world
 

5869
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:17,109
language is a projection of that world
model onto the sequence of yeah letters

5870
02:05:17,109 --> 02:05:17,119
model onto the sequence of yeah letters
 

5871
02:05:17,119 --> 02:05:19,870
model onto the sequence of yeah letters
and and you saying order in in these

5872
02:05:19,870 --> 02:05:19,880
and and you saying order in in these
 

5873
02:05:19,880 --> 02:05:22,990
and and you saying order in in these
things uhh it

5874
02:05:22,990 --> 02:05:23,000
things uhh it
 

5875
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:26,390
things uhh it
finds correlative

5876
02:05:26,390 --> 02:05:26,400
finds correlative
 

5877
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:28,910
finds correlative
clusters in so doing it's like

5878
02:05:28,910 --> 02:05:28,920
clusters in so doing it's like
 

5879
02:05:28,920 --> 02:05:30,189
clusters in so doing it's like
understanding something deep about the

5880
02:05:30,189 --> 02:05:30,199
understanding something deep about the
 

5881
02:05:30,199 --> 02:05:33,390
understanding something deep about the
world yeah which is

5882
02:05:33,390 --> 02:05:33,400
world yeah which is
 

5883
02:05:33,400 --> 02:05:37,229
world yeah which is
like it's beautiful that's how our brain

5884
02:05:37,229 --> 02:05:37,239
like it's beautiful that's how our brain
 

5885
02:05:37,239 --> 02:05:40,109
like it's beautiful that's how our brain
works yeah but it's it's beautiful in

5886
02:05:40,109 --> 02:05:40,119
works yeah but it's it's beautiful in
 

5887
02:05:40,119 --> 02:05:41,990
works yeah but it's it's beautiful in
controls out neur all Nets are able to

5888
02:05:41,990 --> 02:05:42,000
controls out neur all Nets are able to
 

5889
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:43,030
controls out neur all Nets are able to
understand that deep meaning in the

5890
02:05:43,030 --> 02:05:43,040
understand that deep meaning in the
 

5891
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:45,510
understand that deep meaning in the
world and so the question is how far can

5892
02:05:45,510 --> 02:05:45,520
world and so the question is how far can
 

5893
02:05:45,520 --> 02:05:48,790
world and so the question is how far can
it go and it does seem everybody's

5894
02:05:48,790 --> 02:05:48,800
it go and it does seem everybody's
 

5895
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:51,390
it go and it does seem everybody's
excited about llms so in the space of

5896
02:05:51,390 --> 02:05:51,400
excited about llms so in the space of
 

5897
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:53,430
excited about llms so in the space of
self-supervised learning in the space of

5898
02:05:53,430 --> 02:05:53,440
self-supervised learning in the space of
 

5899
02:05:53,440 --> 02:05:59,109
self-supervised learning in the space of
text yeah um it it seems like there's a

5900
02:05:59,109 --> 02:05:59,119
text yeah um it it seems like there's a
 

5901
02:05:59,119 --> 02:06:01,870
text yeah um it it seems like there's a
deep similarity between that and what

5902
02:06:01,870 --> 02:06:01,880
deep similarity between that and what
 

5903
02:06:01,880 --> 02:06:05,030
deep similarity between that and what
Tesla autopal is doing is it to you

5904
02:06:05,030 --> 02:06:05,040
Tesla autopal is doing is it to you
 

5905
02:06:05,040 --> 02:06:07,709
Tesla autopal is doing is it to you
basically the same but

5906
02:06:07,709 --> 02:06:07,719
basically the same but
 

5907
02:06:07,719 --> 02:06:09,629
basically the same but
con they

5908
02:06:09,629 --> 02:06:09,639
con they
 

5909
02:06:09,639 --> 02:06:11,589
con they
converging I wonder who gets their

5910
02:06:11,589 --> 02:06:11,599
converging I wonder who gets their
 

5911
02:06:11,599 --> 02:06:13,470
converging I wonder who gets their
faster understand having a deep

5912
02:06:13,470 --> 02:06:13,480
faster understand having a deep
 

5913
02:06:13,480 --> 02:06:15,669

converge

5918
02:06:19,390 --> 02:06:19,400

5919
02:06:19,400 --> 02:06:21,470

they're both headed towards

5920
02:06:21,470 --> 02:06:21,480
they're both headed towards
 

5921
02:06:21,480 --> 02:06:25,629
they're both headed towards
AGI um the TA approach is much more

5922
02:06:25,629 --> 02:06:25,639
AGI um the TA approach is much more
 

5923
02:06:25,639 --> 02:06:28,109
AGI um the TA approach is much more
computer efficient it had to be because

5924
02:06:28,109 --> 02:06:28,119
computer efficient it had to be because
 

5925
02:06:28,119 --> 02:06:31,270
computer efficient it had to be because
we were constrained on this this you

5926
02:06:31,270 --> 02:06:31,280
we were constrained on this this you
 

5927
02:06:31,280 --> 02:06:34,870
we were constrained on this this you
know we only have 100 Watts

5928
02:06:34,870 --> 02:06:34,880
know we only have 100 Watts
 

5929
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:38,310
know we only have 100 Watts
um and an in 8

5930
02:06:38,310 --> 02:06:38,320
um and an in 8
 

5931
02:06:38,320 --> 02:06:41,910

02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:44,030
computer 144 trillion operations per
second which sounds like a lot but is

5934
02:06:44,030 --> 02:06:44,040
second which sounds like a lot but is
 

5935
02:06:44,040 --> 02:06:47,229
second which sounds like a lot but is
kind of small potatoes these

5936
02:06:47,229 --> 02:06:47,239
kind of small potatoes these
 

5937
02:06:47,239 --> 02:06:49,310
kind of small potatoes these
days I didn't

5938
02:06:49,310 --> 02:06:49,320
days I didn't
 

5939
02:06:49,320 --> 02:06:51,549
days I didn't
but it's understanding the world at

5940
02:06:51,549 --> 02:06:51,559
but it's understanding the world at
 

5941
02:06:51,559 --> 02:06:54,830
but it's understanding the world at
itage it's only 256

5942
02:06:54,830 --> 02:06:54,840
itage it's only 256
 

5943
02:06:54,840 --> 02:06:57,470
itage it's only 256
values but there the path to AGI might

5944
02:06:57,470 --> 02:06:57,480
values but there the path to AGI might
 

5945
02:06:57,480 --> 02:06:59,669
values but there the path to AGI might
have much more significant impact

5946
02:06:59,669 --> 02:06:59,679
have much more significant impact
 

5947
02:06:59,679 --> 02:07:01,910
have much more significant impact
because it's

5948
02:07:01,910 --> 02:07:01,920
because it's
 

5949
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:04,189
because it's
understanding it'll it'll faster

5950
02:07:04,189 --> 02:07:04,199
understanding it'll it'll faster
 

5951
02:07:04,199 --> 02:07:07,149
understanding it'll it'll faster
understand the real world than will llms

5952
02:07:07,149 --> 02:07:07,159
understand the real world than will llms
 

5953
02:07:07,159 --> 02:07:09,750
understand the real world than will llms
and there for be able to integrate with

5954
02:07:09,750 --> 02:07:09,760
and there for be able to integrate with
 

5955
02:07:09,760 --> 02:07:12,030
and there for be able to integrate with
with the real humans in the real world

5956
02:07:12,030 --> 02:07:12,040
with the real humans in the real world
 

5957
02:07:12,040 --> 02:07:15,310
with the real humans in the real world
faster they're both um going to

5958
02:07:15,310 --> 02:07:15,320
faster they're both um going to
 

5959
02:07:15,320 --> 02:07:17,709
faster they're both um going to
understand the world but I think Tesla's

5960
02:07:17,709 --> 02:07:17,719
understand the world but I think Tesla's
 

5961
02:07:17,719 --> 02:07:20,310
understand the world but I think Tesla's
approach is fundamentally more computer

5962
02:07:20,310 --> 02:07:20,320
approach is fundamentally more computer
 

5963
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:22,709
approach is fundamentally more computer
efficient it had to be there was no

5964
02:07:22,709 --> 02:07:22,719
efficient it had to be there was no
 

5965
02:07:22,719 --> 02:07:25,030
efficient it had to be there was no
choice like our brain is very computer

5966
02:07:25,030 --> 02:07:25,040
choice like our brain is very computer
 

5967
02:07:25,040 --> 02:07:28,109
choice like our brain is very computer
efficient very very energy efficient so

5968
02:07:28,109 --> 02:07:28,119
efficient very very energy efficient so
 

5969
02:07:28,119 --> 02:07:29,270
efficient very very energy efficient so
think of like what what is our brain

5970
02:07:29,270 --> 02:07:29,280
think of like what what is our brain
 

5971
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:32,910
think of like what what is our brain
able to do um you know there's only

5972
02:07:32,910 --> 02:07:32,920
able to do um you know there's only
 

5973
02:07:32,920 --> 02:07:35,510
able to do um you know there's only
about 10 watts of higher brain function

5974
02:07:35,510 --> 02:07:35,520
about 10 watts of higher brain function
 

5975
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:37,390
about 10 watts of higher brain function
not counting stuff that's just used to

5976
02:07:37,390 --> 02:07:37,400
not counting stuff that's just used to
 

5977
02:07:37,400 --> 02:07:39,950
not counting stuff that's just used to
control our body um the thinking part of

5978
02:07:39,950 --> 02:07:39,960
control our body um the thinking part of
 

5979
02:07:39,960 --> 02:07:43,229
control our body um the thinking part of
our brain is less than 10 watts um and

5980
02:07:43,229 --> 02:07:43,239
our brain is less than 10 watts um and
 

5981
02:07:43,239 --> 02:07:46,390
our brain is less than 10 watts um and
that 10 those 10 watts can still produce

5982
02:07:46,390 --> 02:07:46,400
that 10 those 10 watts can still produce
 

5983
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:48,990
that 10 those 10 watts can still produce
a much better novel than a 10 megawatt

5984
02:07:48,990 --> 02:07:49,000
a much better novel than a 10 megawatt
 

5985
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,470
a much better novel than a 10 megawatt
GPU cluster so there's a six order of

5986
02:07:51,470 --> 02:07:51,480
GPU cluster so there's a six order of
 

5987
02:07:51,480 --> 02:07:53,750
GPU cluster so there's a six order of
magnitude difference

5988
02:07:53,750 --> 02:07:53,760
magnitude difference
 

5989
02:07:53,760 --> 02:07:58,709
magnitude difference
there um I mean the the AI is thus far

5990
02:07:58,709 --> 02:07:58,719
there um I mean the the AI is thus far
 

5991
02:07:58,719 --> 02:08:02,430
there um I mean the the AI is thus far
gotten to where it is via Brute Force

5992
02:08:02,430 --> 02:08:02,440
gotten to where it is via Brute Force
 

5993
02:08:02,440 --> 02:08:04,830
gotten to where it is via Brute Force
just throwing massive amounts of compute

5994
02:08:04,830 --> 02:08:04,840
just throwing massive amounts of compute
 

5995
02:08:04,840 --> 02:08:09,229
just throwing massive amounts of compute
and and massive amounts of power at it

5996
02:08:09,229 --> 02:08:09,239
and and massive amounts of power at it
 

5997
02:08:09,239 --> 02:08:12,830
and and massive amounts of power at it
so this is not where where it will end

5998
02:08:12,830 --> 02:08:12,840
so this is not where where it will end
 

5999
02:08:12,840 --> 02:08:16,149
so this is not where where it will end

02:08:23,109 --> 02:08:23,119
so I think we'll find over time that
 

6007

02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:06,990
manufactured in the same way that would
make a car and I think ultimately we can

6132
02:11:06,990 --> 02:11:07,000
make a car and I think ultimately we can
 

6133
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:10,390
make a car and I think ultimately we can
make Optimus for less than the cost of a

6134
02:11:10,390 --> 02:11:10,400
make Optimus for less than the cost of a
 

6135
02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:13,270
make Optimus for less than the cost of a
car it should be CU if you look at

6136
02:11:13,270 --> 02:11:13,280
car it should be CU if you look at
 

6137
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:15,990
car it should be CU if you look at
the mass of the robot is much

6138
02:11:15,990 --> 02:11:16,000
the mass of the robot is much
 

6139
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,870
the mass of the robot is much
smaller and the car has many actuators

6140
02:11:18,870 --> 02:11:18,880
smaller and the car has many actuators
 

6141
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:20,109
smaller and the car has many actuators
in

6142
02:11:20,109 --> 02:11:20,119
in
 

6143
02:11:20,119 --> 02:11:22,350
in
it the car has more actuators than the

6144
02:11:22,350 --> 02:11:22,360
it the car has more actuators than the
 

6145
02:11:22,360 --> 02:11:25,229
it the car has more actuators than the
robot but there is uh the actuators are

6146
02:11:25,229 --> 02:11:25,239
robot but there is uh the actuators are
 

6147
02:11:25,239 --> 02:11:27,549
robot but there is uh the actuators are
kind of interesting in a humanoid robot

6148
02:11:27,549 --> 02:11:27,559
kind of interesting in a humanoid robot
 

6149
02:11:27,559 --> 02:11:29,830
kind of interesting in a humanoid robot
with fingers so Optimus has really nice

6150
02:11:29,830 --> 02:11:29,840
with fingers so Optimus has really nice
 

6151
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:30,750
with fingers so Optimus has really nice
hands and

6152
02:11:30,750 --> 02:11:30,760
hands and
 

6153
02:11:30,760 --> 02:11:34,310
hands and
fingers you know yeah and they could do

6154
02:11:34,310 --> 02:11:34,320
fingers you know yeah and they could do
 

6155
02:11:34,320 --> 02:11:37,030
fingers you know yeah and they could do
some interesting manipulation soft soft

6156
02:11:37,030 --> 02:11:37,040
some interesting manipulation soft soft
 

6157
02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:40,669

touch robotics I mean one of the tests I

6158
02:11:40,669 --> 02:11:40,679
touch robotics I mean one of the tests I
 

6159
02:11:40,679 --> 02:11:43,109
touch robotics I mean one of the tests I
goals I have is can can of pick up a

6160
02:11:43,109 --> 02:11:43,119
goals I have is can can of pick up a
 

6161
02:11:43,119 --> 02:11:45,589
goals I have is can can of pick up a
needle and a thread and thread the

6162
02:11:45,589 --> 02:11:45,599
needle and a thread and thread the
 

6163
02:11:45,599 --> 02:11:48,950
needle and a thread and thread the
needle just by looking how far way away

6164
02:11:48,950 --> 02:11:48,960
needle just by looking how far way away
 

6165
02:11:48,960 --> 02:11:50,830

02:11:50,840 --> 02:11:52,470
from that just by looking just by
looking uh maybe a

optimistic on time the work that we're

6172
02:11:56,669 --> 02:11:56,679
optimistic on time the work that we're
 

6173
02:11:56,679 --> 02:11:58,430
optimistic on time the work that we're
doing in the car will translate to the

6174
02:11:58,430 --> 02:11:58,440
doing in the car will translate to the
 

6175
02:11:58,440 --> 02:12:01,030
doing in the car will translate to the
robot the perception or the also the

6176
02:12:01,030 --> 02:12:01,040
robot the perception or the also the
 

6177
02:12:01,040 --> 02:12:02,830
robot the perception or the also the

control the no the controls are
 

6179
02:12:02,840 --> 02:12:05,669
control the no the controls are
different but the the video in controls

02:12:05,669 --> 02:12:05,679
different but the the video in controls
 

6181
02:12:05,679 --> 02:12:08,830
different but the the video in controls
out um the the car is robot and four

with hands and legs so you they're
 

6187
02:12:16,320 --> 02:12:18,109
with hands and legs so you they're
they're very they're very similar so the

yeah and to end is just you just have a
 

6193
02:12:22,360 --> 02:12:24,310
yeah and to end is just you just have a
different set of controls often us we'll

6194
02:12:24,310 --> 02:12:24,320
different set of controls often us we'll
 

6195
02:12:24,320 --> 02:12:27,069
different set of controls often us we'll
figure out how to do things by watching

6196
02:12:27,069 --> 02:12:27,079
figure out how to do things by watching
 

6197
02:12:27,079 --> 02:12:29,709
figure out how to do things by watching
