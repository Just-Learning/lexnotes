00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:31,710
time so if the universe is accelerating
now it will forever continue to do so

164
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:31,720
now it will forever continue to do so
 

165
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,470
now it will forever continue to do so
and yet I mean you're so effortlessly

00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,789
the evolution of the universe and we've
been measuring the evolution of the

been measuring the evolution of the

what it is because one would have to

00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:09,760
what it is because one would have to
 

195
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,750
what it is because one would have to
show that the numbers that the measured

of course even if you've got 8 9 10 12

of course even if you've got 8 9 10 12

of course even if you've got 8 9 10 12

205
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,550

00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:25,560
the measurements significantly differ
 

207
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,670
the measurements significantly differ
from the prediction then the dark energy

208
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:28,680
from the prediction then the dark energy
 

209
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,710
from the prediction then the dark energy
isn't this vacuum State uh ground state

00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:32,720
isn't this vacuum State uh ground state
 

211
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,710
isn't this vacuum State uh ground state
energy of the of the vacuum and so then

212
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:35,720
energy of the of the vacuum and so then
 

213
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,510
energy of the of the vacuum and so then
it could be some sort of a a field some

214
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:38,520
it could be some sort of a a field some
 

215
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,790
it could be some sort of a a field some
sort of a new energy a little bit like

216
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:40,800
sort of a new energy a little bit like
 

217
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,990
sort of a new energy a little bit like
like light like electromagnetism but

218
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:43,000
like light like electromagnetism but
 

219
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,310
like light like electromagnetism but
very different from light that fills

00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:46,320
very different from light that fills
 

221
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,310
very different from light that fills
space and that type of energy could in

222
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:49,320
space and that type of energy could in
 

223
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,550
space and that type of energy could in
principle change in the distant future

224
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:52,560
principle change in the distant future
 

225
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,510
principle change in the distant future
it could become gravitationally

00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:54,520
it could become gravitationally
 

227
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,790
it could become gravitationally

00:04:58,749 --> 00:04:58,759
historical precedent to that and that is
 

231
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:00,950
historical precedent to that and that is
that the inflation with which the

00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:25,240
gravitationally attractive matter so the

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,670
universe did transition to a
deceleration which then dominated the

deceleration which then dominated the
 

259
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,230
deceleration which then dominated the
universe for about 9 billion years and

universe for about 9 billion years and
 

261
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,830
universe for about 9 billion years and
now this small amount of dark

262
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:38,840
now this small amount of dark

energy started causing an acceleration
 

265
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,870
energy started causing an acceleration
about five billion years ago and whether

266
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:43,880
about five billion years ago and whether
 

267
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,550
about five billion years ago and whether
that will continue or not is something

268
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
that will continue or not is something
 

269
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,189
that will continue or not is something
that we'd like to answer but I don't

270
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:48,199
that we'd like to answer but I don't
 

271
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:51,230
that we'd like to answer but I don't
know that we will anytime soon so there

272
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:51,240
know that we will anytime soon so there
 

273
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,590
know that we will anytime soon so there
could be this interesting field that we

274
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:53,600
could be this interesting field that we
 

275
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,110
could be this interesting field that we
don't yet understand that's morphing

276
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:56,120
don't yet understand that's morphing
 

277
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,990
don't yet understand that's morphing
over time that's changing the way the

278
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,000
over time that's changing the way the
 

279
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,070
over time that's changing the way the
universe is is expanding I mean it it's

280
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:01,080
universe is is expanding I mean it it's
 

281
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,469
universe is is expanding I mean it it's
funny that you were thinking through

282
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:03,479
funny that you were thinking through
 

283
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,350
funny that you were thinking through
this rigorously like an

284
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:05,360
this rigorously like an
 

285
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,309
this rigorously like an
experimentalist yeah but the what about

286
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:08,319
experimentalist yeah but the what about
 

287
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,510
experimentalist yeah but the what about
like the fundamental physics of dark

288
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:10,520
like the fundamental physics of dark
 

289
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,909
like the fundamental physics of dark
energy is there any

290
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:12,919
energy is there any
 

291
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:16,270
energy is there any
understanding of uh what the heck it is

292
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:16,280
understanding of uh what the heck it is
 

293
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,150
understanding of uh what the heck it is
or is or is this the kind of uh the the

294
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
or is or is this the kind of uh the the
 

295
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,670
or is or is this the kind of uh the the
god of the gaps or the field of the gaps

296
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:22,680
god of the gaps or the field of the gaps
 

297
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,870
god of the gaps or the field of the gaps
uh so like it there must be something

298
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:24,880
uh so like it there must be something
 

299
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,070
uh so like it there must be something
there because of what we're observing

300
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:27,080
there because of what we're observing
 

301
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,150
there because of what we're observing
I'm very much a person who believes that

302
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:29,160
I'm very much a person who believes that
 

303
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,990
I'm very much a person who believes that
there's all always a cause you know

304
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:31,000
there's all always a cause you know
 

305
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,309
there's all always a cause you know
there there are no um

306
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:34,319
there there are no um
 

307
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,390
there there are no um
miracles of a supernatural nature okay

308
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:38,400
miracles of a supernatural nature okay
 

309
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,350
miracles of a supernatural nature okay
uh so I mean there are two broad

310
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:41,360
uh so I mean there are two broad
 

311
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,150
uh so I mean there are two broad
categories either it's the vacuum Zero

312
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,160
categories either it's the vacuum Zero
 

313
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,790
categories either it's the vacuum Zero
Point Energy or it's some sort of a a

314
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:46,800
Point Energy or it's some sort of a a
 

315
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,390
Point Energy or it's some sort of a a
new energy field that pervades the

316
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:49,400
new energy field that pervades the
 

317
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,510
new energy field that pervades the
Universe the latter could change with

318
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:52,520
Universe the latter could change with
 

319
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,589
Universe the latter could change with
time the former the vacuum energy cannot

320
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:55,599
time the former the vacuum energy cannot
 

321
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,189
time the former the vacuum energy cannot
right so if it turns out that it's one

322
00:06:58,189 --> 00:06:58,199
right so if it turns out that it's one
 

323
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,189
right so if it turns out that it's one
of these new fields and there many many

324
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:00,199
of these new fields and there many many
 

325
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,950
of these new fields and there many many
possibilities they go by the name of you

326
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:01,960
possibilities they go by the name of you
 

327
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,350
possibilities they go by the name of you
know quintessence and things like that

328
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:04,360
know quintessence and things like that
 

329
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,710
know quintessence and things like that
but there are many categories of those

330
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:06,720
but there are many categories of those
 

331
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,990
but there are many categories of those
sorts of fields we try with data to rule

332
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:11,000
sorts of fields we try with data to rule
 

333
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,309
sorts of fields we try with data to rule
them out by comparing the actual

334
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:14,319
them out by comparing the actual
 

335
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,550
them out by comparing the actual
measurements with the predictions and

336
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:16,560
measurements with the predictions and
 

337
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,950
measurements with the predictions and
some have been ruled out but many many

338
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:18,960
some have been ruled out but many many
 

339
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,430
some have been ruled out but many many
others remain to be tested and the data

340
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:22,440
others remain to be tested and the data
 

341
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,710
others remain to be tested and the data
just have to become a lot better before

342
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:24,720
just have to become a lot better before
 

343
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,270
just have to become a lot better before
we can rule out most of them and become

344
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:28,280
we can rule out most of them and become
 

345
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,270
we can rule out most of them and become
reasonably convinced

346
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:30,280
reasonably convinced
 

347
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,430
reasonably convinced
that this is a vacuum energy so there is

348
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:32,440
that this is a vacuum energy so there is
 

349
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,589
that this is a vacuum energy so there is
hypotheses for different fields like

00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:34,599
hypotheses for different fields like
 

351
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:35,909
hypotheses for different fields like

with names and stuff like that yeah yeah
 

353
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,749
with names and stuff like that yeah yeah
you know generically quintessence like

00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:37,759
you know generically quintessence like
 

355
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,110
you know generically quintessence like
the Aristotelian fifth Essence but there

356
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:40,120
the Aristotelian fifth Essence but there
 

357
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,670
the Aristotelian fifth Essence but there
are many many versions of quintessence

are many many versions of quintessence

there's K Essence there's even ideas

there's K Essence there's even ideas
 

361
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,110
there's K Essence there's even ideas

seriously considering this possibility
 

377
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,950
seriously considering this possibility
of a Multiverse and some types of

of a Multiverse and some types of
 

379
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,869
of a Multiverse and some types of
multiverses could have you know a bunch

multiverses could have you know a bunch
 

381
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,110
multiverses could have you know a bunch
of bubbles on the outside which

00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:11,120
of bubbles on the outside which
 

383
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,149
of bubbles on the outside which
gravitationally act outward on our

the bulk the space between these

392
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:25,280
the bulk the space between these
 

393
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,869
the bulk the space between these
different little bubble membranes and

different little bubble membranes and
 

395
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,990
different little bubble membranes and
stuff and so it's conceivable that these

396
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:29,000
stuff and so it's conceivable that these
 

397
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,430
stuff and so it's conceivable that these
other verus are pulling outward on us

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,430
other verus are pulling outward on us

that's not a favored explanation right
 

401
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,909
that's not a favored explanation right
now but but really nothing has been

within classes of models have been ruled
 

409
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,509

analysis right any periodic function can

484
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:26,640
analysis right any periodic function can
 

485
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,470
analysis right any periodic function can
be represented by a sum of signs and Co

486
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:29,480
be represented by a sum of signs and Co
 

487
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,310
be represented by a sum of signs and Co
signs of different periods amplitudes

488
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:32,320
signs of different periods amplitudes
 

489
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,590
signs of different periods amplitudes
and phases so it could have worked

490
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:34,600
and phases so it could have worked
 

491
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,470
and phases so it could have worked
arbitrarily well but other data you know

492
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:38,480
arbitrarily well but other data you know
 

493
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,829
arbitrarily well but other data you know
show that in fact Earth is going around

494
00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:40,839
show that in fact Earth is going around
 

495
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:44,870
show that in fact Earth is going around
the Sun um so are dark energy and dark

496
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:44,880
the Sun um so are dark energy and dark
 

497
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,069
the Sun um so are dark energy and dark
matter just these Band-Aids that we now

498
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:48,079
matter just these Band-Aids that we now
 

499
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,870
matter just these Band-Aids that we now
have to try to explain the data but

500
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:50,880
have to try to explain the data but
 

501
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,949
have to try to explain the data but
they're just completely wrong that

502
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:52,959
they're just completely wrong that
 

503
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,069
they're just completely wrong that
that's a possibility as well and as a

00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:55,079
that's a possibility as well and as a
 

505
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:57,430
that's a possibility as well and as a
scientist I have to be open to that

506
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:57,440
scientist I have to be open to that
 

507
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,750

Earth how do you put yourself in that
 

521

Earth how do you put yourself in that
mindset and then take a leap to uh

522
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:18,279
mindset and then take a leap to uh

00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:23,190
mindset and then take a leap to uh
propose a model that the sun is in fact

00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:23,200
propose a model that the sun is in fact
 

525
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,910

sure I mean so that puts us back in the

00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:27,720
sure I mean so that puts us back in the
 

529
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,750
sure I mean so that puts us back in the
shoes of cernus right 500 years ago

530
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:31,760
shoes of cernus right 500 years ago
 

531
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,790
shoes of cernus right 500 years ago
where he had this philosophical

00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:34,800
where he had this philosophical
 

533
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,629
where he had this philosophical
preference for the sun being the

in terms of the measured positions of
planets was not better explained by the

542
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:50,079
planets was not better explained by the
 

543
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,550
planets was not better explained by the
heliocentric Sun centered system it's

544
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:53,560
heliocentric Sun centered system it's
 

545
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,470
heliocentric Sun centered system it's
just that you know cernus saw that the

546
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:55,480
just that you know cernus saw that the
 

547
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,870
just that you know cernus saw that the
sun is the source of all our light and

548
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:57,880
sun is the source of all our light and
 

549
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,949
sun is the source of all our light and
heat oh wow

550
00:11:59,949 --> 00:11:59,959
heat oh wow
 

551
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:01,910
heat oh wow
and he had you know he he knew from

552
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:01,920
and he had you know he he knew from
 

553
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,990
and he had you know he he knew from
other studies that it's it's far away so

554
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,000
other studies that it's it's far away so
 

555
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,949
other studies that it's it's far away so
the fact that it appears as big as the

556
00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:05,959
the fact that it appears as big as the
 

557
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:08,190
the fact that it appears as big as the
moon means it's actually way way bigger

558
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:08,200
moon means it's actually way way bigger
 

559
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,910
moon means it's actually way way bigger
because even at that time it was known

560
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:09,920
because even at that time it was known
 

561
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,470
because even at that time it was known
that the sun is much farther away than

562
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:11,480
that the sun is much farther away than
 

563
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,670
that the sun is much farther away than
the moon so um you know he just felt wow

564
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:14,680
the moon so um you know he just felt wow
 

565
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,590
the moon so um you know he just felt wow
it's big it's bright what if it's the

566
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:17,600
it's big it's bright what if it's the
 

567
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,590
it's big it's bright what if it's the
central thing but the observed positions

568
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:20,600
central thing but the observed positions
 

569
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,269
central thing but the observed positions
of planets at the time in the early to

570
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:24,279
of planets at the time in the early to
 

571
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:27,710
of planets at the time in the early to
mid 16th century under the heliocentric

572
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:27,720
mid 16th century under the heliocentric
 

573
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,269
mid 16th century under the heliocentric
system was not a better match at least

574
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:30,279
system was not a better match at least
 

575
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:32,470
system was not a better match at least
not a significantly better match than

576
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:32,480
not a significantly better match than
 

577
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,310
not a significantly better match than
tmy system which was quite accurate and

578
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:35,320
tmy system which was quite accurate and
 

579
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,590
tmy system which was quite accurate and
lasted 1500 years yeah

580
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:38,600
lasted 1500 years yeah
 

581
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,990
lasted 1500 years yeah
yeah that's so fascinating to think that

582
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,000
yeah that's so fascinating to think that
 

583
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,069
yeah that's so fascinating to think that
the philosophical predispositions that

584
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:44,079
the philosophical predispositions that
 

585
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,949
the philosophical predispositions that
you bring to the table are essent so

586
00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:45,959
you bring to the table are essent so
 

587
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:47,189
you bring to the table are essent so
like you have to have a young person

588
00:12:47,189 --> 00:12:47,199
like you have to have a young person
 

589
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:50,069
like you have to have a young person
come along that has a weird infatuation

590
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:50,079
come along that has a weird infatuation
 

591
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,150
come along that has a weird infatuation
with the son yeah that like almost

592
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:53,160
with the son yeah that like almost
 

593
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,629
with the son yeah that like almost
philosophically is like however their

594
00:12:55,629 --> 00:12:55,639
philosophically is like however their
 

595
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:58,670
philosophically is like however their
upbringing is they're more ready for

596
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:58,680
upbringing is they're more ready for
 

597
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,590
upbringing is they're more ready for
whatever the more the simpler answer is

598
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:02,600
whatever the more the simpler answer is
 

599
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,310
whatever the more the simpler answer is
right oh that's um it's kind of sad it's

600
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:07,320
right oh that's um it's kind of sad it's
 

601
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,750
right oh that's um it's kind of sad it's
uh sad from an individual descendant of

602
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:09,760
uh sad from an individual descendant of
 

603
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,710
uh sad from an individual descendant of
ape perspective because then that means

604
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:12,720
ape perspective because then that means
 

605
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,030
ape perspective because then that means
like me like you as a

606
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,040
like me like you as a
 

607
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,910
like me like you as a
scientist you're stuck with whatever the

608
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:17,920
scientist you're stuck with whatever the
 

609
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,670
scientist you're stuck with whatever the
heck philosophies you brought to the

610
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:19,680
heck philosophies you brought to the
 

611
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,910
heck philosophies you brought to the
table you might be almost completely

612
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:21,920
table you might be almost completely
 

613
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,430
table you might be almost completely
unable to to think outside this

614
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:24,440
unable to to think outside this
 

615
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,150
unable to to think outside this
particular box you've built right this

616
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160
particular box you've built right this
 

617
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,750
particular box you've built right this
is why I'm saying that you know as an

618
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:27,760
is why I'm saying that you know as an
 

619
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,430
is why I'm saying that you know as an
objective scientist one needs needs to

620
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:29,440
objective scientist one needs needs to
 

621
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,550
objective scientist one needs needs to
have an open mind to Crazy sounding new

622
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:33,560
have an open mind to Crazy sounding new
 

623
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,670
have an open mind to Crazy sounding new
ideas and you know even cernus was very

624
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:36,680
ideas and you know even cernus was very
 

625
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,829
ideas and you know even cernus was very
much a man of his time and dedicated his

626
00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:38,839
much a man of his time and dedicated his
 

627
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:42,069
much a man of his time and dedicated his
work to the pope he still used circular

628
00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:42,079
work to the pope he still used circular
 

629
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,470
work to the pope he still used circular
orbits the Sun was a little bit off

630
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:44,480
orbits the Sun was a little bit off
 

631
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,110
orbits the Sun was a little bit off
center it turns out and a slightly

632
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,120
center it turns out and a slightly
 

633
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,230
center it turns out and a slightly
off-center Circle looks like a slightly

634
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,240
off-center Circle looks like a slightly
 

635
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,710
off-center Circle looks like a slightly
eccentric elliptical orbit so then when

636
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:52,720
eccentric elliptical orbit so then when
 

637
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,870
eccentric elliptical orbit so then when
Kepler in fact showed that the orbits

638
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:55,880
Kepler in fact showed that the orbits
 

639
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,069
Kepler in fact showed that the orbits
are actually in general ellipses not

640
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:58,079
are actually in general ellipses not
 

641
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,069
are actually in general ellipses not
circles the reason that you know he

642
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:02,079
circles the reason that you know he
 

643
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,949
circles the reason that you know he
needed tuob bra's really great data to

644
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:05,959
needed tuob bra's really great data to
 

645
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:08,430
needed tuob bra's really great data to
show that distinction was that a

646
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:08,440
show that distinction was that a
 

647
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,430
show that distinction was that a
slightly off-center circle is not much

648
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:10,440
slightly off-center circle is not much
 

649
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,990
slightly off-center circle is not much
different from a slightly eccentric

650
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:13,000
different from a slightly eccentric
 

651
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,150
different from a slightly eccentric
ellipse and so there wasn't much

652
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:15,160
ellipse and so there wasn't much
 

653
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,629
ellipse and so there wasn't much
difference between Kepler's View and uh

654
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:18,639
difference between Kepler's View and uh
 

655
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,069
difference between Kepler's View and uh
kernus is View and and Kepler needed the

656
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:21,079
kernus is View and and Kepler needed the
 

657
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:24,790
kernus is View and and Kepler needed the
better data uh tuo's toob bra's data and

658
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:24,800
better data uh tuo's toob bra's data and
 

659
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,710
better data uh tuo's toob bra's data and
so that's again a great example of of of

660
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:28,720
so that's again a great example of of of
 

661
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,110
so that's again a great example of of of
science

662
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:30,120
science
 

663
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,710
science
and OBS observations and experiments

664
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:32,720
and OBS observations and experiments
 

665
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,829
and OBS observations and experiments
working together with hypotheses and

666
00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:34,839
working together with hypotheses and
 

667
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:36,949
working together with hypotheses and
they they kind of bounce off each other

668
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:36,959
they they kind of bounce off each other
 

669
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,829
they they kind of bounce off each other
they play off of each other and you

670
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:38,839
they play off of each other and you
 

671
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:40,749
they play off of each other and you
continually need more observations and

672
00:14:40,749 --> 00:14:40,759
continually need more observations and
 

673
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:45,310
continually need more observations and
it wasn't until Galileo's work uh around

674
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:45,320
it wasn't until Galileo's work uh around
 

675
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,629
it wasn't until Galileo's work uh around
1610 that actual evidence for the

676
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:48,639
1610 that actual evidence for the
 

677
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,389
1610 that actual evidence for the
heliocentric hypothesis emerged it came

678
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:51,399
heliocentric hypothesis emerged it came
 

679
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:54,030
heliocentric hypothesis emerged it came
in the form of Venus the planet Venus

680
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,040
in the form of Venus the planet Venus
 

681
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,949
in the form of Venus the planet Venus
going through all of the possible phases

682
00:14:56,949 --> 00:14:56,959
going through all of the possible phases
 

683
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,790
going through all of the possible phases
from new to Crescent to to quarter to

684
00:14:59,790 --> 00:14:59,800
from new to Crescent to to quarter to
 

685
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,430
from new to Crescent to to quarter to
gibbus to full to waning gibbus third

686
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:02,440
gibbus to full to waning gibbus third
 

687
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,389
gibbus to full to waning gibbus third
quarter waning crescent and then new

688
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:04,399
quarter waning crescent and then new
 

689
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,230
quarter waning crescent and then new
again it turns out in the toic system

690
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:07,240
again it turns out in the toic system
 

691
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,150
again it turns out in the toic system
with Venus between Earth and the Sun but

692
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,160
with Venus between Earth and the Sun but
 

693
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,030
with Venus between Earth and the Sun but
always roughly in the direction of the

694
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:12,040
always roughly in the direction of the
 

695
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,710
always roughly in the direction of the
sun you could only get the new and

696
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:14,720
sun you could only get the new and
 

697
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,870
sun you could only get the new and
Cresent phases of Venus but the

698
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:17,880
Cresent phases of Venus but the
 

699
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,509
Cresent phases of Venus but the
observations showed a full set of phases

700
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:21,519
observations showed a full set of phases
 

701
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,910
observations showed a full set of phases
and moreover when Venus was gibbus or

702
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:23,920
and moreover when Venus was gibbus or
 

703
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,990
and moreover when Venus was gibbus or
full that meant it was on the far side

704
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,000
full that meant it was on the far side
 

705
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,670
full that meant it was on the far side
of the Sun that meant it was farther

706
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:27,680
of the Sun that meant it was farther
 

707
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,990
of the Sun that meant it was farther
from Earth than when it's Crescent so it

708
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,000
from Earth than when it's Crescent so it
 

709
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,829
from Earth than when it's Crescent so it
should appear smaller and indeed it did

710
00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:32,839
should appear smaller and indeed it did
 

711
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:34,949
should appear smaller and indeed it did
so that was a that was you know the nail

712
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:34,959
so that was a that was you know the nail
 

713
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,230
so that was a that was you know the nail
and the coffin in a sense and then you

714
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:37,240
and the coffin in a sense and then you
 

715
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,150
and the coffin in a sense and then you
know Galileo's other great observation

716
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:39,160
know Galileo's other great observation
 

717
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,150
know Galileo's other great observation
was that Jupiter has moons going around

718
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,160
was that Jupiter has moons going around
 

719
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,629
was that Jupiter has moons going around
it the four Galilean satellites and even

720
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:44,639
it the four Galilean satellites and even
 

721
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,150
it the four Galilean satellites and even
though Jupiter moves through space so

722
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:47,160
though Jupiter moves through space so
 

723
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,910
though Jupiter moves through space so
too do the moons go with it so first of

724
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:49,920
too do the moons go with it so first of
 

725
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,150
too do the moons go with it so first of
all Earth is not the only thing that has

726
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:52,160
all Earth is not the only thing that has
 

727
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,309
all Earth is not the only thing that has
other things going around it and

728
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:54,319
other things going around it and
 

729
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:56,990
other things going around it and
secondly Earth could be moving as

730
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:57,000
secondly Earth could be moving as
 

731
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,870
secondly Earth could be moving as
Jupiter does and you know

732
00:15:59,870 --> 00:15:59,880
Jupiter does and you know
 

733
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,389
Jupiter does and you know
things would move with with it we we

734
00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:01,399
things would move with with it we we
 

735
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:02,910
things would move with with it we we
wouldn't fly off the surface and our

736
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:02,920
wouldn't fly off the surface and our
 

737
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,430
wouldn't fly off the surface and our
moon wouldn't be left behind and all

738
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:04,440
moon wouldn't be left behind and all
 

739
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,030
moon wouldn't be left behind and all
this kind of stuff so that was a a big

740
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,040
this kind of stuff so that was a a big
 

741
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,949
this kind of stuff so that was a a big
breakthrough as well but it wasn't as

742
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:08,959
breakthrough as well but it wasn't as
 

743
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,910
breakthrough as well but it wasn't as
definitive in my opinion as the phases

744
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:11,920
definitive in my opinion as the phases
 

745
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,509
definitive in my opinion as the phases
of Venus perhaps I'm revealing my

746
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:14,519
of Venus perhaps I'm revealing my
 

747
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,350
of Venus perhaps I'm revealing my
ignorance but I didn't realize how much

748
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:16,360
ignorance but I didn't realize how much
 

749
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,710
ignorance but I didn't realize how much
data they were working with yeah so

750
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:18,720
data they were working with yeah so
 

751
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,710
data they were working with yeah so
there's uh so it wasn't

752
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:22,720
there's uh so it wasn't
 

753
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,910
there's uh so it wasn't
Einstein or Freud thinking in theories

754
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:26,920
Einstein or Freud thinking in theories
 

755
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,389
Einstein or Freud thinking in theories
it was a lot of data and you're playing

756
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:29,399
it was a lot of data and you're playing
 

757
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:30,870
it was a lot of data and you're playing
with it and seeing how to make sense of

758
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:30,880
with it and seeing how to make sense of
 

759
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,389
with it and seeing how to make sense of
it so isn't it it isn't just coming up

760
00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:33,399
it so isn't it it isn't just coming up
 

761
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:35,470
it so isn't it it isn't just coming up
with completely abstract thought

762
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:35,480
with completely abstract thought
 

763
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,470
with completely abstract thought
experiments yeah it's looking at the

764
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:37,480
experiments yeah it's looking at the
 

765
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,150
experiments yeah it's looking at the
data sure and you Newton's great work

766
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,160
data sure and you Newton's great work
 

767
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,389
data sure and you Newton's great work
right the prinkipia it was based in part

768
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:43,399
right the prinkipia it was based in part
 

769
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:46,150
right the prinkipia it was based in part
on Galileo's observations of balls

770
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:46,160
on Galileo's observations of balls
 

771
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,030
on Galileo's observations of balls
rolling down inclined planes supposedly

772
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,040
rolling down inclined planes supposedly
 

773
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,670
rolling down inclined planes supposedly
fall falling off the Leaning Tower of

774
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:50,680
fall falling off the Leaning Tower of
 

775
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,269
fall falling off the Leaning Tower of
Pisa but that's probably apocryphal in

776
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:53,279
Pisa but that's probably apocryphal in
 

777
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,470
Pisa but that's probably apocryphal in
any case you know um the the the

778
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:56,480
any case you know um the the the
 

779
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,069
any case you know um the the the
Inquisition actually did or the R

780
00:16:59,069 --> 00:16:59,079
Inquisition actually did or the R
 

781
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:01,829
Inquisition actually did or the R
Catholic Church uh did did history a

782
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:01,839
Catholic Church uh did did history a
 

783
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,110
Catholic Church uh did did history a
favor not that I'm condoning them but

784
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:04,120
favor not that I'm condoning them but
 

785
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,470
favor not that I'm condoning them but
they placed Galileo under house arrest

786
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:06,480
they placed Galileo under house arrest
 

787
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,309
they placed Galileo under house arrest
yeah and that gave Galileo time to

788
00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:09,319
yeah and that gave Galileo time to
 

789
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,029
yeah and that gave Galileo time to
publish to assemble and publish the

790
00:17:12,029 --> 00:17:12,039
publish to assemble and publish the
 

791
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:13,789
publish to assemble and publish the
results of his experiments that he had

792
00:17:13,789 --> 00:17:13,799
results of his experiments that he had
 

793
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,270
results of his experiments that he had
done decades earlier it's not clear he

794
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:16,280
done decades earlier it's not clear he
 

795
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,510
done decades earlier it's not clear he
would have had time to do that you know

796
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:18,520
would have had time to do that you know
 

797
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,669
would have had time to do that you know
had he not been under house arrest and

798
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:21,679
had he not been under house arrest and
 

799
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,710
had he not been under house arrest and
so Newton of course Very Much used

800
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:24,720
so Newton of course Very Much used
 

801
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,390
so Newton of course Very Much used
Galileo's

802
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:26,400
Galileo's
 

803
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,909
Galileo's
observations let me ask uh the old

804
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:29,919
observations let me ask uh the old
 

805
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,950
observations let me ask uh the old
Russian overly philosophical question

806
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:31,960
Russian overly philosophical question
 

807
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,190
Russian overly philosophical question
about death so we're talking about the

808
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:35,200
about death so we're talking about the
 

809
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,110
about death so we're talking about the
expanding Universe sure how do you think

810
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:38,120
expanding Universe sure how do you think
 

811
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,150
expanding Universe sure how do you think
human civilization will come to an end

812
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:40,160
human civilization will come to an end
 

813
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,710
human civilization will come to an end
if we avoid the uh the near-term issues

814
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:42,720
if we avoid the uh the near-term issues
 

815
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,070
if we avoid the uh the near-term issues
we're

816
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:44,080
we're
 

817
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,110
we're
having uh will it be our sun burning out

818
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,120
having uh will it be our sun burning out
 

819
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,270
having uh will it be our sun burning out
will it be comets okay will it be uh

820
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:51,280
will it be comets okay will it be uh
 

821
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,750
will it be comets okay will it be uh
what is it oh do you think we we have a

822
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:53,760
what is it oh do you think we we have a
 

823
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,350
what is it oh do you think we we have a
shot at reaching the the heat death of

824
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:57,360
shot at reaching the the heat death of
 

825
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,310
shot at reaching the the heat death of
the universe yeah yeah so we're going to

826
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:00,320
the universe yeah yeah so we're going to
 

827
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,270
the universe yeah yeah so we're going to
leave out the

828
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:03,280
leave out the
 

829
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,990
leave out the
anthropogenic uhle causes of our

830
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,000
anthropogenic uhle causes of our
 

831
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,830
anthropogenic uhle causes of our
potential destruction yes which I

832
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:07,840
potential destruction yes which I
 

833
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,630
potential destruction yes which I
actually think are greater than the

834
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:11,640
actually think are greater than the
 

835
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,549
actually think are greater than the
celestial uh causes so um so if we get

836
00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:15,559
celestial uh causes so um so if we get
 

837
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:17,710
celestial uh causes so um so if we get
lucky yeah if we get and intelligent I

838
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:17,720
lucky yeah if we get and intelligent I
 

839
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,310
lucky yeah if we get and intelligent I
don't know yeah so no way will we as

840
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:20,320
don't know yeah so no way will we as
 

841
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,789
don't know yeah so no way will we as
humans reach the heat death of the

842
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:22,799
humans reach the heat death of the
 

843
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,830
humans reach the heat death of the
Universe I mean it's conceivable that uh

844
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:25,840
Universe I mean it's conceivable that uh
 

845
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,909
Universe I mean it's conceivable that uh
machines which I think will be our

846
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:27,919
machines which I think will be our
 

847
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,549
machines which I think will be our
evolutionary descendants might reach

848
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:30,559
evolutionary descendants might reach
 

849
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,710
evolutionary descendants might reach
that although even they will have less

850
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:32,720
that although even they will have less
 

851
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,909
that although even they will have less
and less energy with which to work as

852
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:34,919
and less energy with which to work as
 

853
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:37,710
and less energy with which to work as
time progresses because eventually even

854
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:37,720
time progresses because eventually even
 

855
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,390
time progresses because eventually even
the lowest mass stars burn out although

856
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:40,400
the lowest mass stars burn out although
 

857
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,270
the lowest mass stars burn out although
it takes them trillions of years to do

858
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:42,280
it takes them trillions of years to do
 

859
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,230
it takes them trillions of years to do
so um so the point is is that certainly

860
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:46,240
so um so the point is is that certainly
 

861
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,990
so um so the point is is that certainly
on Earth uh there are other Celestial

862
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,000
on Earth uh there are other Celestial
 

863
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,270
on Earth uh there are other Celestial

exploding Stars the sun burning out so

866
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:57,039
exploding Stars the sun burning out so
 

867
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,870
exploding Stars the sun burning out so
we will definitely need to move away

868
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:58,880
we will definitely need to move away
 

869
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,430
we will definitely need to move away
away from our solar system to other

away from our solar system to other
 

871
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,830
away from our solar system to other
solar systems and then you know the

872
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:03,840
solar systems and then you know the
 

873
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,149
solar systems and then you know the
question is can they keep on propagating

874
00:19:07,149 --> 00:19:07,159
question is can they keep on propagating
 

875
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:10,190
question is can they keep on propagating
to other planetary systems sufficiently

876
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:10,200
to other planetary systems sufficiently
 

877

00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,470
about you know five billion years when
it becomes a red giant although I should

886
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:25,480
it becomes a red giant although I should
 

887
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,710
it becomes a red giant although I should
hasten to add that within the next one

888
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:27,720
hasten to add that within the next one
 

889
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,590
hasten to add that within the next one
or two billion years years the sun will

890
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:29,600
or two billion years years the sun will
 

891
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,789
or two billion years years the sun will
have brightened enough that unless

892
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:32,799
have brightened enough that unless
 

893
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,350
have brightened enough that unless
they compensatory atmospheric changes

the oceans will will evaporate away you

896
00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:38,919
the oceans will will evaporate away you
 

897
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:40,830
the oceans will will evaporate away you
know and and you need much less carbon

898
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:40,840
know and and you need much less carbon
 

899
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,270
know and and you need much less carbon
dioxide for the temperatures to be

900
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:43,280
dioxide for the temperatures to be
 

901
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,029

maintained roughly at their present

902
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:45,039

903
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,990

temperature and plants wouldn't like
 

905
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,909
temperature and plants wouldn't like
that very much so you can't lower the

906
00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:48,919
that very much so you can't lower the
 

907
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:51,590
that very much so you can't lower the
carbon dioxide content too much so so

908
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:51,600
carbon dioxide content too much so so
 

909
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,830
carbon dioxide content too much so so
within one or two billion years probably

910
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:53,840
within one or two billion years probably
 

911
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,270
within one or two billion years probably
the oceans will evaporate away yeah but

912
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:56,280
the oceans will evaporate away yeah but
 

913
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,470
the oceans will evaporate away yeah but
on a sooner time scale than that

914

00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:51,000
being the goat what would you uh what
 

1057
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,669
being the goat what would you uh what
would you do

1058
00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:52,679
would you do
 

1059
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:55,990
would you do
if it seemed like in a matter of months

1060
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:56,000
if it seemed like in a matter of months
 

1061
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,909
if it seemed like in a matter of months
that there is some nonzero prob ility

that there is some nonzero prob ility
 

1063
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,870
that there is some nonzero prob ility
maybe a high probability that there will

be a collision so from a scientific

00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:03,720
be a collision so from a scientific
 

1067
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,029
be a collision so from a scientific
perspective from an engineering

1068
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:05,039
perspective from an engineering
 

1069
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,950
perspective from an engineering
perspective I imagine you would actually

1070
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:06,960
perspective I imagine you would actually
 

1071
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,269

be in the room of people deciding what

1072
00:23:09,269 --> 00:23:09,279
be in the room of people deciding what

to do what uh yeah philosophically too

1074
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:12,600
to do what uh yeah philosophically too
 

1075
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,990
to do what uh yeah philosophically too
it's a tough one right because if you

1076
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:14,000
it's a tough one right because if you
 

1077
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,830
it's a tough one right because if you
only have a few months that's not much

1078
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:16,840
only have a few months that's not much
 

1079
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,710
only have a few months that's not much
time in which to deflect it early

1080
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:20,720
time in which to deflect it early
 

1081
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,070
time in which to deflect it early
detection and and um early action or key

1082
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:25,080
detection and and um early action or key
 

1083
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,190
detection and and um early action or key
because when it's far away you only have

1084
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:27,200
because when it's far away you only have
 

1085
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,909
because when it's far away you only have
to deflect it by a tiny little angle

1086
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:29,919
to deflect it by a tiny little angle
 

1087
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,029
to deflect it by a tiny little angle
yeah and then by a time it reaches us

1088
00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:32,039
yeah and then by a time it reaches us
 

1089
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:34,510
yeah and then by a time it reaches us
the perpendicular motion is big enough

1090
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:34,520
the perpendicular motion is big enough
 

1091
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,269
the perpendicular motion is big enough
to you know to to Miss Earth all you

1092
00:23:37,269 --> 00:23:37,279
to you know to to Miss Earth all you
 

1093
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:39,390
to you know to to Miss Earth all you
need is one radius or or one diameter of

1094
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:39,400
need is one radius or or one diameter of
 

1095
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,430
need is one radius or or one diameter of
the earth

1096
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:40,440
the earth
 

1097
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,630
the earth
right that actually means that all you

1098
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:42,640
right that actually means that all you
 

1099
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,470
right that actually means that all you
would need to do is slow it down so it

1100
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:45,480
would need to do is slow it down so it
 

1101
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,789
would need to do is slow it down so it
arrives four minutes later or speed it

1102
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:48,799
arrives four minutes later or speed it
 

1103
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,870
arrives four minutes later or speed it
up so it arrives four minutes earlier

1104
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:50,880
up so it arrives four minutes earlier
 

1105
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,710
up so it arrives four minutes earlier
and Earth will have moved through one

1106
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:54,720
and Earth will have moved through one
 

1107
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,789
and Earth will have moved through one
radius in in that time so it doesn't

1108
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:56,799
radius in in that time so it doesn't
 

1109
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,590
radius in in that time so it doesn't
take much but you can imagine if a thing

1110
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:58,600
take much but you can imagine if a thing
 

1111
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,070
take much but you can imagine if a thing
is about to hit you you you have to

1112
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:01,080
is about to hit you you you have to
 

1113
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,549
is about to hit you you you have to
deflect at 90 degrees or more right you

1114
00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:03,559
deflect at 90 degrees or more right you
 

1115
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:04,789
deflect at 90 degrees or more right you
know and you don't have much time to do

1116
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:04,799
know and you don't have much time to do
 

1117
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,110
know and you don't have much time to do
so and you have to slow it down or speed

1118
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:07,120
so and you have to slow it down or speed
 

1119
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,510
so and you have to slow it down or speed
it up a lot if that's what you're trying

1120
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:08,520
it up a lot if that's what you're trying
 

1121
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,950
it up a lot if that's what you're trying
to do to it and so decades is sufficient

1122
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:11,960
to do to it and so decades is sufficient
 

1123
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,549
to do to it and so decades is sufficient
time but months is not sufficient time

1124
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:14,559
time but months is not sufficient time
 

1125
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,029
time but months is not sufficient time
so at that point I would think the the

1126
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:18,039
so at that point I would think the the
 

1127
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,470
so at that point I would think the the
name of the game would be to try to

1128
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:19,480
name of the game would be to try to
 

1129
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,430
name of the game would be to try to
predict where it would

1130
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:21,440
predict where it would
 

1131
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,590
predict where it would
hit and if it's in a heavily populated

1132
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:25,600
hit and if it's in a heavily populated
 

1133
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,669
hit and if it's in a heavily populated
region try to

1134
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:29,679
region try to
 

1135
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,269
region try to
try to start an orderly evacuation

1136
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:32,279
try to start an orderly evacuation
 

1137
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:34,789
try to start an orderly evacuation
perhaps but you know that might cause

1138
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:34,799
perhaps but you know that might cause
 

1139
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,909
perhaps but you know that might cause
just so much Panic that I'm how would

1140
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:36,919
just so much Panic that I'm how would
 

1141
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:39,470
just so much Panic that I'm how would
you do it with New York City or or Los

1142
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:39,480
you do it with New York City or or Los
 

1143
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,470
you do it with New York City or or Los
Angeles or something like that right I

1144
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:41,480
Angeles or something like that right I
 

1145
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,750
Angeles or something like that right I
might have I might have a different

1146
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:42,760
might have I might have a different
 

1147
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:46,269
might have I might have a different
opinion a year ago I'm uh a bit U

1148
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:46,279
opinion a year ago I'm uh a bit U
 

1149
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:49,510
opinion a year ago I'm uh a bit U
disheartened by you know in the movies

1150
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:49,520
disheartened by you know in the movies
 

1151
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,070
disheartened by you know in the movies
the um there's always extreme competence

1152
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,080
the um there's always extreme competence
 

1153
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,269
the um there's always extreme competence
from the

1154
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:53,279
from the
 

1155
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,190
from the
government competence yeah competence

1156
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:56,200
government competence yeah competence
 

1157
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,950
government competence yeah competence
right but we expect extreme incompetence

1158
00:24:58,950 --> 00:24:58,960
right but we expect extreme incompetence
 

1159
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,549
right but we expect extreme incompetence
if anything right yes now so I'm quite

1160
00:25:01,549 --> 00:25:01,559
if anything right yes now so I'm quite
 

1161
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:03,549
if anything right yes now so I'm quite
disappointed but sort of from a medical

1162
00:25:03,549 --> 00:25:03,559
disappointed but sort of from a medical
 

1163
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:05,990
disappointed but sort of from a medical
perspective I think you're saying there

1164
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:06,000
perspective I think you're saying there
 

1165
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,470
perspective I think you're saying there
in a scientific one it's almost better

1166
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:08,480
in a scientific one it's almost better
 

1167
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,190
in a scientific one it's almost better
to get better and better maybe

1168
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:11,200
to get better and better maybe
 

1169
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,269
to get better and better maybe
telescopes and data collection to be

1170
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:13,279
telescopes and data collection to be
 

1171
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,190
telescopes and data collection to be
able to predict the movement of these

1172
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:15,200
able to predict the movement of these
 

1173
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,070
able to predict the movement of these
things or like come up with totally new

1174
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:17,080
things or like come up with totally new
 

1175
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,430
things or like come up with totally new
technologies like you can imagine

1176
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:19,440
technologies like you can imagine
 

1177
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,909
technologies like you can imagine
actually sending out like probes out

1178
00:25:22,909 --> 00:25:22,919
actually sending out like probes out
 

1179
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:25,230
actually sending out like probes out
there to be able to sort of almost have

1180
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:25,240
there to be able to sort of almost have
 

1181
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,190
there to be able to sort of almost have
little finger sensors throughout our

1182
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:27,200
little finger sensors throughout our
 

1183
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,830
little finger sensors throughout our
solar system to be able to detect stuff

1184
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:29,840
solar system to be able to detect stuff
 

1185
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,430
solar system to be able to detect stuff
well that's right yeah monitoring the

1186
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:31,440
well that's right yeah monitoring the
 

1187
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,350
well that's right yeah monitoring the
asteroid belt is very important and 99%

1188
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:34,360
asteroid belt is very important and 99%
 

1189
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,389
asteroid belt is very important and 99%
of the so-called neear objects

1190
00:25:37,389 --> 00:25:37,399
of the so-called neear objects
 

1191
00:25:37,399 --> 00:25:39,149
of the so-called neear objects
ultimately come from the asteroid belt

1192
00:25:39,149 --> 00:25:39,159
ultimately come from the asteroid belt
 

1193
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:40,430
ultimately come from the asteroid belt
and so there we can track the

1194
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:40,440
and so there we can track the
 

1195
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,350
and so there we can track the
trajectories and even if there's you

1196
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:42,360
trajectories and even if there's you
 

1197
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,870
trajectories and even if there's you
know a close encounter between two

1198
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:43,880
know a close encounter between two
 

1199
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,070
know a close encounter between two
asteroids which deflects one of them

1200
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,080
asteroids which deflects one of them
 

1201
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,269
asteroids which deflects one of them
toward Earth it's unlikely to be on a

1202
00:25:48,269 --> 00:25:48,279
toward Earth it's unlikely to be on a
 

1203
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:50,070
toward Earth it's unlikely to be on a
collision course with Earth in the

1204
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,080
collision course with Earth in the
 

1205
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,029
collision course with Earth in the
immediate future it's more like you know

1206
00:25:52,029 --> 00:25:52,039
immediate future it's more like you know
 

1207
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:54,909
immediate future it's more like you know
tens of years so that gives us time but

1208
00:25:54,909 --> 00:25:54,919
tens of years so that gives us time but
 

1209
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:58,350
tens of years so that gives us time but
we would need to improve our ability to

1210
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:58,360
we would need to improve our ability to
 

1211
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,190
we would need to improve our ability to
detect the objects that come in from a

1212
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:00,200
detect the objects that come in from a
 

1213
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,710
detect the objects that come in from a
great distance unfortunately those are

1214
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:02,720
great distance unfortunately those are
 

1215
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,710
great distance unfortunately those are
are much rarer the the Comets come in

1216
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:05,720
are much rarer the the Comets come in
 

1217
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,549
are much rarer the the Comets come in
you know 1% of the collisions perhaps

1218
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:08,559
you know 1% of the collisions perhaps
 

1219
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,950
you know 1% of the collisions perhaps
are with comets that come in without any

1220
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:11,960
are with comets that come in without any
 

1221
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,269
are with comets that come in without any
warning hardly and

1222
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:15,279
warning hardly and
 

1223
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,870
warning hardly and
so so that might be more like you know a

1224
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:18,880
so so that might be more like you know a
 

1225
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,590
so so that might be more like you know a
billion or two billion years before one

1226
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:20,600
billion or two billion years before one
 

1227
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,190
billion or two billion years before one
of those hits us um so maybe we have to

1228
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:24,200
of those hits us um so maybe we have to
 

1229
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,110
of those hits us um so maybe we have to
worry about the sun getting brighter on

1230
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,120
worry about the sun getting brighter on
 

1231
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,269
worry about the sun getting brighter on
that time scale I mean there's the

1232
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:29,279
that time scale I mean there's the
 

1233
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,269
that time scale I mean there's the
possibility that a star will explode

1234
00:26:32,269 --> 00:26:32,279
possibility that a star will explode
 

1235
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:35,190
possibility that a star will explode
near us in the next couple of billion

1236
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:35,200
near us in the next couple of billion
 

1237
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,149
near us in the next couple of billion
years but over the course of the history

1238
00:26:39,149 --> 00:26:39,159
years but over the course of the history
 

1239
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:43,789
years but over the course of the history
of life on Earth the estimates are

1240
00:26:43,789 --> 00:26:43,799
of life on Earth the estimates are
 

1241
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:45,389
of life on Earth the estimates are
that

1242
00:26:45,389 --> 00:26:45,399
that
 

1243
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:49,909
that
maybe only one of the mass extinctions

1244
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:49,919
maybe only one of the mass extinctions
 

1245
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,510
maybe only one of the mass extinctions
you know was caused by a star blowing up

1246
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:52,520
you know was caused by a star blowing up
 

1247
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,350
you know was caused by a star blowing up
in particular a special kind called a

1248
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:55,360
in particular a special kind called a
 

1249
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,710
in particular a special kind called a
Gamay burst and the I think it's the

1250
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:57,720
Gamay burst and the I think it's the
 

1251
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,190
Gamay burst and the I think it's the
oriv I

1252
00:26:59,190 --> 00:26:59,200
oriv I
 

1253
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,350
oriv I
solarian uh saluan or divis saluan

Extinction 420 or so 440 million years

1256
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:05,600
Extinction 420 or so 440 million years
 

1257
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,110
Extinction 420 or so 440 million years
ago that is speculated to have come from

1258
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:08,120
ago that is speculated to have come from
 

1259
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,710
ago that is speculated to have come from
one of these particular types of

1260
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:09,720
one of these particular types of
 

1261
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,310
one of these particular types of
exploding Stars called Gamay bursts but

1262
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:12,320
exploding Stars called Gamay bursts but
 

1263
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,630
exploding Stars called Gamay bursts but
even there the the evidence is

1264
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:14,640
even there the the evidence is
 

1265
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,389
even there the the evidence is
circumstantial so those kinds of

1266
00:27:17,389 --> 00:27:17,399
circumstantial so those kinds of
 

1267
00:27:17,399 --> 00:27:19,710
circumstantial so those kinds of
existential threats are are reasonably

1268
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:19,720
existential threats are are reasonably
 

1269
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,590
existential threats are are reasonably

00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:38,640
threat because you have to get rid of
 

1427
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,590
threat because you have to get rid of
sort of the very last humans for that

1428
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:41,600
sort of the very last humans for that
 

1429
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,470
sort of the very last humans for that
but but at least getting rid of um you

1430
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:44,480
but but at least getting rid of um you
 

1431
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,310
but but at least getting rid of um you
know killing off so many humans truly

1432
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:46,320
know killing off so many humans truly
 

1433
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,350
know killing off so many humans truly
billions and billions of humans the one

1434
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:49,360
billions and billions of humans the one
 

1435
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,430
billions and billions of humans the one
there have been

1436
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:50,440
there have been
 

1437
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,190
there have been
ones tens of thousands of years ago

1438
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:53,200
ones tens of thousands of years ago
 

1439
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,110
ones tens of thousands of years ago
including this one um Toba I think it's

1440
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:56,120
including this one um Toba I think it's
 

1441
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,830
including this one um Toba I think it's
called where it's estimated that the

1442
00:30:58,830 --> 00:30:58,840
called where it's estimated that the
 

1443
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,269
called where it's estimated that the
human population was down to 10,000 or

1444
00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:02,279
human population was down to 10,000 or
 

1445
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,830
human population was down to 10,000 or
5,000 individuals something like that

1446
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:04,840
5,000 individuals something like that
 

1447
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,149
5,000 individuals something like that
right if you have a 15 degree drop in

1448
00:31:07,149 --> 00:31:07,159
right if you have a 15 degree drop in
 

1449
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:10,509
right if you have a 15 degree drop in
temperature over quite a short time it's

1450
00:31:10,509 --> 00:31:10,519
temperature over quite a short time it's
 

1451
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:12,190
temperature over quite a short time it's
not clear that even with today's

1452
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:12,200
not clear that even with today's
 

1453
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,549
not clear that even with today's
advanced technology we would be able to

1454
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:14,559
advanced technology we would be able to
 

1455
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,830
advanced technology we would be able to
adequately respond at least for the vast

1456
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:16,840
adequately respond at least for the vast
 

1457
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,110
adequately respond at least for the vast
majority of people maybe some would be

1458
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:19,120
majority of people maybe some would be
 

1459
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,710
majority of people maybe some would be
in these underground caves where you'd

1460
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:20,720
in these underground caves where you'd
 

1461
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,190
in these underground caves where you'd
keep the president and a bunch of other

1462
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:22,200
keep the president and a bunch of other
 

1463
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,629
keep the president and a bunch of other
important people you know but the the

1464
00:31:24,629 --> 00:31:24,639
important people you know but the the
 

1465
00:31:24,639 --> 00:31:26,509
important people you know but the the
typical person is not going to be prot

1466
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:26,519
typical person is not going to be prot
 

1467

protected when when all of Agriculture

1468
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:29,720
protected when when all of Agriculture
 

1469
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,430
protected when when all of Agriculture
is is cut off right and when it could be

1470
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:32,440
is is cut off right and when it could be
 

1471
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,070
is is cut off right and when it could be
hundreds of millions or billions of

1472
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:34,080
hundreds of millions or billions of
 

1473
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,350
hundreds of millions or billions of
people yeah starving to death exactly

1474
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:37,360
people yeah starving to death exactly
 

1475
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,310
people yeah starving to death exactly
that's right they don't all die

1476
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:39,320
that's right they don't all die
 

1477
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,750
that's right they don't all die
immediately but they use up their

1478
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:41,760
immediately but they use up their
 

1479
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,310
immediately but they use up their
supplies or again this electrical grid

1480
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:44,320
supplies or again this electrical grid
 

1481
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,950
supplies or again this electrical grid
first toilet paper there you go stash

1482
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:46,960
first toilet paper there you go stash
 

1483
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,269
first toilet paper there you go stash
that toilet paper you know um or the

1484
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:49,279
that toilet paper you know um or the
 

1485
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,190
that toilet paper you know um or the
electrical grid I mean imagine North

1486
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:51,200
electrical grid I mean imagine North
 

1487
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,509
electrical grid I mean imagine North
America without power for a year right I

1488
00:31:54,509 --> 00:31:54,519
America without power for a year right I
 

1489
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:56,710
America without power for a year right I
mean we've become so dependent we're no

1490
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:56,720
mean we've become so dependent we're no
 

1491
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,430
mean we've become so dependent we're no
longer the cave people

1492
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:58,440
longer the cave people
 

1493
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,310
longer the cave people
they would do just fine right what do

1494
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:00,320
they would do just fine right what do
 

1495
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,110
they would do just fine right what do
they care about the electrical grid

1496
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:02,120
they care about the electrical grid
 

1497
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,269
they care about the electrical grid
right what do they care about

1498
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:03,279
right what do they care about
 

1499
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,950
right what do they care about
agriculture they're hunters and

1500
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:04,960
agriculture they're hunters and
 

1501
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,629
agriculture they're hunters and
gatherers but we now have become so used

1502
00:32:08,629 --> 00:32:08,639
gatherers but we now have become so used
 

1503
00:32:08,639 --> 00:32:11,350
gatherers but we now have become so used
to our way of life that the only real

1504
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:11,360
to our way of life that the only real
 

1505
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,430
to our way of life that the only real
survivors would be those rugged

1506
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:13,440
survivors would be those rugged
 

1507
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,149
survivors would be those rugged
individualists who live somewhere out in

1508
00:32:15,149 --> 00:32:15,159
individualists who live somewhere out in
 

1509
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:17,190
individualists who live somewhere out in
the forest or in a cave somewhere

1510
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:17,200
the forest or in a cave somewhere
 

1511
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,389
the forest or in a cave somewhere
completely independent of anyone else

1512
00:32:20,389 --> 00:32:20,399
completely independent of anyone else
 

1513
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,669
completely independent of anyone else
yeah I've recently I recommend it it's

1514
00:32:22,669 --> 00:32:22,679
yeah I've recently I recommend it it's
 

1515
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:24,230
yeah I've recently I recommend it it's
totally new to me this kind of

1516
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:24,240
totally new to me this kind of
 

1517
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,029
totally new to me this kind of
survivalist uh folks but there's a a few

1518
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:27,039
survivalist uh folks but there's a a few
 

1519
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,950
survivalist uh folks but there's a a few
show there's a lot lot of shows of those

1520
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:28,960
show there's a lot lot of shows of those
 

1521
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,669
show there's a lot lot of shows of those
but I saw one on Netflix and I started

1522
00:32:31,669 --> 00:32:31,679
but I saw one on Netflix and I started
 

1523
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,389
but I saw one on Netflix and I started
watching them and

1524
00:32:33,389 --> 00:32:33,399
watching them and
 

1525
00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:37,070
watching them and
there's they make a lot of sense they

1526
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:37,080
there's they make a lot of sense they
 

1527
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,470
there's they make a lot of sense they
they reveal to you how dependent we are

1528
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:40,480
they reveal to you how dependent we are
 

1529
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,789
they reveal to you how dependent we are
on all aspects of this beautiful systems

1530
00:32:42,789 --> 00:32:42,799
on all aspects of this beautiful systems
 

1531
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,269
on all aspects of this beautiful systems
we human have built right and how

1532
00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:45,279
we human have built right and how
 

1533
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,950
we human have built right and how
fragile they are incredibly fragile and

1534
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:48,960
fragile they are incredibly fragile and
 

1535
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,230
fragile they are incredibly fragile and
yeah this this whole conversation is

1536
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:51,240
yeah this this whole conversation is
 

1537
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,310
yeah this this whole conversation is
making me realize how lucky we are oh

1538
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:53,320
making me realize how lucky we are oh
 

1539
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,389
making me realize how lucky we are oh
we're we're incredibly lucky but we've

1540
00:32:55,389 --> 00:32:55,399
we're we're incredibly lucky but we've
 

1541
00:32:55,399 --> 00:32:58,470
we're we're incredibly lucky but we've
set ourselves up to be very very fragile

1542
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:58,480
set ourselves up to be very very fragile
 

1543
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,070
set ourselves up to be very very fragile
and we are intrinsically complex

1544
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:01,080
and we are intrinsically complex
 

1545
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,629
and we are intrinsically complex
biological creatures that except for the

1546
00:33:04,629 --> 00:33:04,639
biological creatures that except for the
 

1547
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:06,629
biological creatures that except for the
fact that we have brains and Minds with

1548
00:33:06,629 --> 00:33:06,639
fact that we have brains and Minds with
 

1549
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:09,110
fact that we have brains and Minds with
which we can you know try to prevent

1550
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:09,120
which we can you know try to prevent
 

1551
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,750
which we can you know try to prevent
some of these things or respond to them

1552
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:11,760
some of these things or respond to them
 

1553
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,870
some of these things or respond to them
we as a living organism require quite a

1554
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:15,880
we as a living organism require quite a
 

1555
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,029
we as a living organism require quite a
narrow set of conditions in order to

1556
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:18,039
narrow set of conditions in order to
 

1557
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:20,149
narrow set of conditions in order to
survive you know we're not cockroaches

1558
00:33:20,149 --> 00:33:20,159
survive you know we're not cockroaches
 

1559
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,029
survive you know we're not cockroaches
we're not going to survive a nuclear war

1560
00:33:23,029 --> 00:33:23,039
we're not going to survive a nuclear war
 

1561
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,070
we're not going to survive a nuclear war
so we're kind of there's this beautiful

1562
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:25,080
so we're kind of there's this beautiful
 

1563
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,430
so we're kind of there's this beautiful
dance between um we've been talking

1564
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:27,440
dance between um we've been talking
 

1565
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,470
dance between um we've been talking
about a astronomy that astronomy the

1566
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:31,480
about a astronomy that astronomy the
 

1567
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,430
about a astronomy that astronomy the
Stars like

1568
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:33,440
Stars like
 

1569
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,269
Stars like
inspires everybody and at the same time

1570
00:33:36,269 --> 00:33:36,279
inspires everybody and at the same time
 

1571
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:38,029
inspires everybody and at the same time
there's this pragmatic aspect that we're

1572
00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:38,039
there's this pragmatic aspect that we're
 

1573
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:40,310
there's this pragmatic aspect that we're
talking about and so I see space

1574
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:40,320
talking about and so I see space
 

1575
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,190
talking about and so I see space
exploration as the same kind of way that

1576
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:43,200
exploration as the same kind of way that
 

1577
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,310
exploration as the same kind of way that
it's uh reaching out to other planets

1578
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:45,320
it's uh reaching out to other planets
 

1579
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,310
it's uh reaching out to other planets
reaching out to the stars is this really

1580
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:47,320
reaching out to the stars is this really
 

1581
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,710
reaching out to the stars is this really
beautiful idea but if you listen to

1582
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:49,720
beautiful idea but if you listen to
 

1583
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,029
beautiful idea but if you listen to
somebody like uh Elon Musk he talks

1584
00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:53,039
somebody like uh Elon Musk he talks
 

1585
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,990
somebody like uh Elon Musk he talks
about space exploration as very

1586
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:56,000
about space exploration as very
 

1587
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,750
about space exploration as very
pragmatic like we have to if we we have

1588
00:33:58,750 --> 00:33:58,760
pragmatic like we have to if we we have
 

1589
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,070
pragmatic like we have to if we we have
to

1590
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:00,080
to
 

1591
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,310
to
be he has this ridiculous way of

1592
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:02,320
be he has this ridiculous way of
 

1593
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,990
be he has this ridiculous way of
sounding like an engineer about it which

1594
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,000
sounding like an engineer about it which
 

1595
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,830
sounding like an engineer about it which
is like it's obvious we need to become a

1596
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:06,840
is like it's obvious we need to become a
 

1597
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,069
is like it's obvious we need to become a
multiplanetary species if we were to

1598
00:34:09,069 --> 00:34:09,079
multiplanetary species if we were to
 

1599
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:12,829
multiplanetary species if we were to
survive long term so maybe both

1600
00:34:12,829 --> 00:34:12,839
survive long term so maybe both
 

1601
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:15,710
survive long term so maybe both
philosophically in terms of beauty and

1602
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:15,720
philosophically in terms of beauty and
 

1603
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,190
philosophically in terms of beauty and
in terms of practical what's your

1604
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:18,200
in terms of practical what's your
 

1605
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,430
in terms of practical what's your
thoughts on um space exploration on the

1606
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:21,440
thoughts on um space exploration on the
 

1607
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,629
thoughts on um space exploration on the
challenges of it on how much we should

1608
00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:23,639
challenges of it on how much we should
 

1609
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,909
challenges of it on how much we should
be investing in it and on a personal

1610
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:25,919
be investing in it and on a personal
 

1611
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:27,909
be investing in it and on a personal
level like how excited you are about by

1612
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:27,919
level like how excited you are about by
 

1613
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:30,629
level like how excited you are about by
the possibility of going to Mars

1614
00:34:30,629 --> 00:34:30,639
the possibility of going to Mars
 

1615
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,629
the possibility of going to Mars
colonizing Mars and maybe going outside

1616
00:34:33,629 --> 00:34:33,639
colonizing Mars and maybe going outside
 

1617
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:36,109
colonizing Mars and maybe going outside
the solar system yeah you know great

1618
00:34:36,109 --> 00:34:36,119
the solar system yeah you know great
 

1619
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:38,829
the solar system yeah you know great
question uh there's a lot to unpack

1620
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:38,839
question uh there's a lot to unpack
 

1621
00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:41,629
question uh there's a lot to unpack
there of course you know humans are by

1622
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:41,639
there of course you know humans are by
 

1623
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:44,389
there of course you know humans are by

destiny to go out there and and of
 

1633
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,390
destiny to go out there and and of
course from a pragmatic perspective yes

1634
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:58,400
course from a pragmatic perspective yes

really because things could go wrong

1638
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:04,880
really because things could go wrong
 

1639
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,750
really because things could go wrong
here on Earth now some people

1640
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:06,760
here on Earth now some people
 

1641
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,109
here on Earth now some people
say that's that's an excuse to not take

1642
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:10,119
say that's that's an excuse to not take
 

1643
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:11,670
say that's that's an excuse to not take
care of our planet that well we say

1644
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:11,680
care of our planet that well we say
 

1645
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,069
care of our planet that well we say
we're elsewhere and so we don't have to

1646
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:13,079
we're elsewhere and so we don't have to
 

1647
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:14,750
we're elsewhere and so we don't have to
take good care of our planet no you know

1648
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:14,760
take good care of our planet no you know
 

1649
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,950
take good care of our planet no you know
we should take the best possible care of

1650
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:16,960
we should take the best possible care of
 

1651
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,910
we should take the best possible care of
our planet we should be cognizant of the

1652
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:19,920
our planet we should be cognizant of the
 

1653
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,910
our planet we should be cognizant of the
potential impact of what we're doing

1654
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:21,920
potential impact of what we're doing
 

1655
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,150
potential impact of what we're doing
nevertheless it's prudent to have us be

1656
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:25,160
nevertheless it's prudent to have us be
 

1657
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,190
nevertheless it's prudent to have us be
elsewhere as well so in that regard I

1658
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:28,200
elsewhere as well so in that regard I
 

1659
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,510
elsewhere as well so in that regard I
actually agree with Elon uh it'd be good

1660
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:31,520
actually agree with Elon uh it'd be good
 

1661
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,390
actually agree with Elon uh it'd be good
to be on Mars that would be yet another

1662
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:33,400
to be on Mars that would be yet another
 

1663
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,589
to be on Mars that would be yet another
place for us to from which to you know

1664
00:35:36,589 --> 00:35:36,599
place for us to from which to you know
 

1665
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:38,870
place for us to from which to you know
explore further would that be a good

1666
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:38,880
explore further would that be a good
 

1667
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,150
explore further would that be a good
Next Step would you say well that's the

1668
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:40,160
Next Step would you say well that's the
 

1669
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,190
Next Step would you say well that's the
good it's a good next step I have happen

1670
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:42,200
good it's a good next step I have happen
 

1671
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,150
good it's a good next step I have happen
I happen to disagree with him as to how

1672
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:44,160
I happen to disagree with him as to how
 

1673
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,470
I happen to disagree with him as to how
quickly it will happen right I mean I

1674
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:46,480
quickly it will happen right I mean I
 

1675
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,790
quickly it will happen right I mean I
think he's very optimistic now you need

1676
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:48,800
think he's very optimistic now you need
 

1677
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,230
think he's very optimistic now you need
Visionary people like Elon to to get

1678
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:51,240
Visionary people like Elon to to get
 

1679
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,950

1682
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:54,560
look at the success he's had with
 

1683
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,270
look at the success he's had with
multiple companies uh so maybe he gives

1684
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:58,280
multiple companies uh so maybe he gives
 

1685
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,750
multiple companies uh so maybe he gives
this very optimistic timeline in order

1686
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:00,760
this very optimistic timeline in order
 

1687
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,430
this very optimistic timeline in order
to be inspirational to those who are who

1688
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:03,440
to be inspirational to those who are who
 

1689
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,349
to be inspirational to those who are who
are going out there and certainly his

that's a GameChanger sort of like every
 

1699
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,829
that's a GameChanger sort of like every
time you flew from San Francisco to Los

Cher but nevertheless the time scale

1706
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:24,160
Cher but nevertheless the time scale
 

1707
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,270
Cher but nevertheless the time scale
over which he thinks that there could be

1708
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:26,280
over which he thinks that there could be
 

1709
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,349
over which he thinks that there could be
a real thriving colony on Mars I think

1710
00:36:28,349 --> 00:36:28,359
a real thriving colony on Mars I think
 

1711
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:31,069
a real thriving colony on Mars I think
is far too optimistic what's the biggest

1712
00:36:31,069 --> 00:36:31,079
is far too optimistic what's the biggest
 

1713
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:34,069
is far too optimistic what's the biggest
challenges to you one is just getting

1714
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:34,079
challenges to you one is just getting
 

1715
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,910
challenges to you one is just getting
Rockets not Rockets but people out there

1716
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:36,920
Rockets not Rockets but people out there

and two is the
 

1719
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,589
and two is the
colonization like what do you have

1720
00:36:40,589 --> 00:36:40,599
colonization like what do you have
 

1721
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:43,309
colonization like what do you have
thoughts about this um challenges of

1722
00:36:43,309 --> 00:36:43,319
thoughts about this um challenges of
 

1723
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:45,030
thoughts about this um challenges of
this kind of prospect yeah I haven't

1724
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:45,040
this kind of prospect yeah I haven't
 

1725
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,550
this kind of prospect yeah I haven't
thought about it in in great detail uh

1726
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:47,560
thought about it in in great detail uh
 

1727
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,230
thought about it in in great detail uh
other than recognizing that Mars is a

1728
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:50,240
other than recognizing that Mars is a
 

1729
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,870
other than recognizing that Mars is a
harsh environment yeah you don't have

1730
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:51,880
harsh environment yeah you don't have
 

1731
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,589
harsh environment yeah you don't have
much of an atmosphere there you've got

1732
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:53,599
much of an atmosphere there you've got
 

1733
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,589
much of an atmosphere there you've got
less than a percent of Earth's

1734
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:55,599
less than a percent of Earth's
 

1735
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,230
less than a percent of Earth's
atmosphere um so you you to build some

1736
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:58,240
atmosphere um so you you to build some
 

1737
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,430
atmosphere um so you you to build some
sort of a dome right away right and and

1738
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:00,440
sort of a dome right away right and and
 

1739
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,069
sort of a dome right away right and and
that that would take time you need to

1740
00:37:03,069 --> 00:37:03,079
that that would take time you need to
 

1741
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:05,470
that that would take time you need to
melt the water that's in the permafrost

1742
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:05,480
melt the water that's in the permafrost
 

1743
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,750
melt the water that's in the permafrost
or have canals dug from which you

1744
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:08,760
or have canals dug from which you
 

1745
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,349
or have canals dug from which you
transport it from the from the polar ice

1746
00:37:11,349 --> 00:37:11,359
transport it from the from the polar ice
 

1747
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,910
transport it from the from the polar ice
caps you know I I was reading recently

1748
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:13,920
caps you know I I was reading recently
 

1749
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,870
caps you know I I was reading recently
in terms of like what's the most

1750
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:15,880
in terms of like what's the most
 

1751
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,710
in terms of like what's the most
efficient source of nutrition for humans

1752
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:18,720
efficient source of nutrition for humans
 

1753
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,790
efficient source of nutrition for humans
that were to live on Mars and uh people

1754
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:20,800
that were to live on Mars and uh people
 

1755
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,230
that were to live on Mars and uh people
should look into this but it turns out

1756
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:22,240
should look into this but it turns out
 

1757
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,470
should look into this but it turns out
to be insects insects yeah yeah so you

1758
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:25,480
to be insects insects yeah yeah so you
 

1759
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,910
to be insects insects yeah yeah so you
want you want to build GI colony of

1760
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:27,920
want you want to build GI colony of
 

1761
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,030
want you want to build GI colony of
insects and just be eating insects have

1762
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:30,040
insects and just be eating insects have
 

1763
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,870
insects and just be eating insects have
a lot of protein right a lot of protein

1764
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:31,880
a lot of protein right a lot of protein
 

1765
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,190
a lot of protein right a lot of protein
and they're easy

1766
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:33,200
and they're easy
 

1767
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,430
and they're easy
to like you can think of them as farming

1768
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:36,440
to like you can think of them as farming
 

1769
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,829
to like you can think of them as farming
right but it's not going to be easy as

1770
00:37:38,829 --> 00:37:38,839
right but it's not going to be easy as
 

1771
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:41,309
right but it's not going to be easy as
easy as growing a whole plot of potatoes

1772
00:37:41,309 --> 00:37:41,319
easy as growing a whole plot of potatoes
 

1773
00:37:41,319 --> 00:37:42,829
easy as growing a whole plot of potatoes
like in the movie The Martian you know

1774
00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:42,839
like in the movie The Martian you know
 

1775
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:44,750
like in the movie The Martian you know
or something right it's not going to be

1776
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:44,760
or something right it's not going to be
 

1777
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,790
or something right it's not going to be
that easy but you know so there's

1778
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:46,800
that easy but you know so there's
 

1779
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,550
that easy but you know so there's
there's this thin atmosphere it's got

1780
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:48,560
there's this thin atmosphere it's got
 

1781
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,670
there's this thin atmosphere it's got
the wrong composition it's mostly carbon

1782
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:50,680
the wrong composition it's mostly carbon
 

1783
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,790
the wrong composition it's mostly carbon
dioxide there are these violent dust

1784
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:53,800
dioxide there are these violent dust
 

1785
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,150
dioxide there are these violent dust
storms the temperatures are generally

1786
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:56,160
storms the temperatures are generally
 

1787
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,990
storms the temperatures are generally
cold you know you'd need to do a lot of

1788
00:37:58,990 --> 00:37:59,000
cold you know you'd need to do a lot of
 

1789
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,670
cold you know you'd need to do a lot of
things you need to terraform it

1790
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:00,680
things you need to terraform it
 

1791
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,710
things you need to terraform it
basically in order to make it nicely

1792
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:02,720
basically in order to make it nicely
 

1793
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,510
basically in order to make it nicely
livable without some Dome surrounding

1794
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:05,520
livable without some Dome surrounding
 

1795
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,990
livable without some Dome surrounding
you and if you and if you insist on a

1796
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:08,000
you and if you and if you insist on a
 

1797
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,910
you and if you and if you insist on a
dome well that's not going to house that

1798
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:09,920
dome well that's not going to house that
 

1799
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,910
dome well that's not going to house that
many people right you know well so let's

1800
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:12,920
many people right you know well so let's
 

1801
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,030
many people right you know well so let's
look let's look briefly then you know

1802
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:16,040
look let's look briefly then you know
 

1803
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,589
look let's look briefly then you know
we're looking for a new apartment to

1804
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:17,599
we're looking for a new apartment to
 

1805
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,790
we're looking for a new apartment to
move into so let's look outside the

1806
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:19,800
move into so let's look outside the
 

1807
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,430
move into so let's look outside the
solar system do you think you've you've

1808
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:22,440
solar system do you think you've you've
 

1809
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,589
solar system do you think you've you've
spoken about exoplanets as well do you

1810
00:38:25,589 --> 00:38:25,599
spoken about exoplanets as well do you
 

1811
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,550
spoken about exoplanets as well do you
think there's um possible homes out

1812
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:28,560
think there's um possible homes out
 

1813
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,710
think there's um possible homes out
there for us uh outside of our solar

1814
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:30,720
there for us uh outside of our solar
 

1815
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,630
there for us uh outside of our solar
system there are lots and lots of homes

1816
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:33,640
system there are lots and lots of homes
 

1817
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,630
system there are lots and lots of homes
possible homes I mean they're there's a

1818
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:36,640
possible homes I mean they're there's a
 

1819
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,470
possible homes I mean they're there's a
planetary system around nearly every

1820
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:38,480
planetary system around nearly every
 

1821
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,309
planetary system around nearly every
Star you see in the sky and one in five

1822
00:38:41,309 --> 00:38:41,319
Star you see in the sky and one in five
 

1823
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,710
Star you see in the sky and one in five
of those is thought to have a roughly

1824
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:43,720
of those is thought to have a roughly
 

1825
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,230
of those is thought to have a roughly
earth like Planet you know and that's a

1826
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:46,240
earth like Planet you know and that's a
 

1827
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,270
earth like Planet you know and that's a
relatively new yeah it's a new discovery

1828
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:48,280
relatively new yeah it's a new discovery
 

1829
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,069
relatively new yeah it's a new discovery
I mean that the Kepler satellite which

1830
00:38:50,069 --> 00:38:50,079
I mean that the Kepler satellite which
 

1831
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,430
I mean that the Kepler satellite which
was flying around uh above Earth's

1832
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:52,440
was flying around uh above Earth's
 

1833
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,030
was flying around uh above Earth's
atmosphere was able to monitor the

1834
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:54,040
atmosphere was able to monitor the
 

1835
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,150
atmosphere was able to monitor the
brightness of stars with exquisite

1836
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:56,160
brightness of stars with exquisite
 

1837
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,670
brightness of stars with exquisite
detail and they could detect planets

1838
00:38:59,670 --> 00:38:59,680
detail and they could detect planets
 

1839
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,390
detail and they could detect planets
crossing the line of sight between us

1840
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:02,400
crossing the line of sight between us
 

1841
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,390
crossing the line of sight between us
and the star thereby dimming its light

1842
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:05,400
and the star thereby dimming its light
 

1843
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,150
and the star thereby dimming its light
for a short time ever so slightly and

1844
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:08,160
for a short time ever so slightly and
 

1845
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,750
for a short time ever so slightly and
it's it's amazing so there are now

1846
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:09,760
it's it's amazing so there are now
 

1847
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,750
it's it's amazing so there are now
thousands and thousands of these

1848
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:11,760
thousands and thousands of these
 

1849
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,190
thousands and thousands of these
exoplanet candidates of which something

1850
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:14,200
exoplanet candidates of which something
 

1851
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,309
exoplanet candidates of which something
like 90% are probably genuine exoplanets

1852
00:39:17,309 --> 00:39:17,319
like 90% are probably genuine exoplanets
 

1853
00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:20,150
like 90% are probably genuine exoplanets
and you have to remember that only about

1854
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:20,160
and you have to remember that only about
 

1855
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,270
and you have to remember that only about
1% of stars have their planetary system

1856
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:24,280
1% of stars have their planetary system
 

1857
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,390
1% of stars have their planetary system
oriented Edge on to your line of sight

1858
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:27,400
oriented Edge on to your line of sight
 

1859
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,950
oriented Edge on to your line of sight
which is what you need for this Transit

1860
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:29,960
which is what you need for this Transit
 

1861
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,270
which is what you need for this Transit
method to work right some arbitrary

1862
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:32,280
method to work right some arbitrary
 

1863
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,150
method to work right some arbitrary
angle won't work and certainly

1864
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:34,160
angle won't work and certainly
 

1865
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,109
angle won't work and certainly
perpendicular uh to your line of sight

1866
00:39:36,109 --> 00:39:36,119
perpendicular uh to your line of sight
 

1867
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:37,710
perpendicular uh to your line of sight
that is in the plane of the sky won't

1868
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:37,720
that is in the plane of the sky won't
 

1869
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,870
that is in the plane of the sky won't
work because the the the planet is

1870
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:39,880
work because the the the planet is
 

1871
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,990
work because the the the planet is
orbiting the star and never crossing

1872
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:42,000
orbiting the star and never crossing
 

1873
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,950
orbiting the star and never crossing
your line of sight so the fact that um

1874
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:44,960
your line of sight so the fact that um
 

1875
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,270
your line of sight so the fact that um
you know they

1876
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:46,280
you know they
 

1877
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,990
you know they
found planets orbiting about 1% of the

1878
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:50,000
found planets orbiting about 1% of the
 

1879
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,950
found planets orbiting about 1% of the
stars that they looked at in this field

1880
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:51,960
stars that they looked at in this field
 

1881
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,630
stars that they looked at in this field
of 150 plus thousand

1882
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:54,640
of 150 plus thousand
 

1883
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,790
of 150 plus thousand
stars they found planets around 1% you

1884
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:57,800
stars they found planets around 1% you
 

1885
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,109
stars they found planets around 1% you
then multiply by the inverse of 1% which

1886
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:01,119
then multiply by the inverse of 1% which
 

1887
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,630
then multiply by the inverse of 1% which
is you know right 1% is about how many

1888
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:04,640
is you know right 1% is about how many
 

1889
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,829
is you know right 1% is about how many
what the fraction of the of the stars

1890
00:40:06,829 --> 00:40:06,839
what the fraction of the of the stars
 

1891
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:08,790
what the fraction of the of the stars
that have their planetary system

1892
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:08,800
that have their planetary system
 

1893
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,829
that have their planetary system
oriented the right way and that already

1894
00:40:11,829 --> 00:40:11,839
oriented the right way and that already
 

1895
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,630
oriented the right way and that already
back of the envelope calculation tells

1896
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:13,640
back of the envelope calculation tells
 

1897
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,870
back of the envelope calculation tells
you that of order 50 to 100% of all

1898
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:16,880
you that of order 50 to 100% of all
 

1899
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,950
you that of order 50 to 100% of all
stars have planets okay and then they've

1900
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:18,960
stars have planets okay and then they've
 

1901
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,950
stars have planets okay and then they've
been finding these earthlike planets etc

1902
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:20,960
been finding these earthlike planets etc
 

1903
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,790
been finding these earthlike planets etc
etc so there are many potential homes

1904
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:23,800
etc so there are many potential homes
 

1905
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,750
etc so there are many potential homes
the problem is getting there okay so

1906
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:26,760
the problem is getting there okay so
 

1907
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,390
the problem is getting there okay so
then a typical bright star serus uh the

1908
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:30,400
then a typical bright star serus uh the
 

1909
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,390
then a typical bright star serus uh the
brightest star in the sky maybe not a

1910
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:32,400
brightest star in the sky maybe not a
 

1911
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,150
brightest star in the sky maybe not a
typical bright star but it's 8.7 light

1912
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:36,160
typical bright star but it's 8.7 light
 

1913
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,150
typical bright star but it's 8.7 light
years away okay so uh that's that means

1914
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:40,160
years away okay so uh that's that means
 

1915
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,270
years away okay so uh that's that means
the light took 8.7 years to reach us

1916
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:43,280
the light took 8.7 years to reach us
 

1917
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,589
the light took 8.7 years to reach us
we're seeing it as it was about nine

1918
00:40:45,589 --> 00:40:45,599
we're seeing it as it was about nine
 

1919
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,390
we're seeing it as it was about nine
years ago okay so then you know you ask

1920
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:49,400
years ago okay so then you know you ask
 

1921
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,550
years ago okay so then you know you ask
how long would a rocket take to get

1922
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:51,560
how long would a rocket take to get
 

1923
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,710
how long would a rocket take to get
there at Earth's escape speed which is

1924
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:54,720
there at Earth's escape speed which is
 

1925
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,630
there at Earth's escape speed which is
11 kilometers per second okay and it

1926
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:57,640
11 kilometers per second okay and it
 

1927
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,790
11 kilometers per second okay and it
turns out it's about a quarter of a

1928
00:40:59,790 --> 00:40:59,800
turns out it's about a quarter of a
 

1929
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,950
turns out it's about a quarter of a
million years okay now that's 10,000

1930
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:02,960
million years okay now that's 10,000
 

1931
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,829
million years okay now that's 10,000
Generations okay let's say a generation

1932
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:04,839
Generations okay let's say a generation
 

1933
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:07,870
Generations okay let's say a generation
of humans is 25 years right so you need

1934
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:07,880
of humans is 25 years right so you need
 

1935
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:12,109
of humans is 25 years right so you need
this colony of people that is able to

1936
00:41:12,109 --> 00:41:12,119
this colony of people that is able to
 

1937
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:14,870
this colony of people that is able to
sustain itself all their food all their

1938
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:14,880
sustain itself all their food all their
 

1939
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,150
sustain itself all their food all their
waste disposal all their water all their

1940
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:17,160
waste disposal all their water all their
 

1941
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,470

Generations they have to commit

1944
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:21,560
Generations they have to commit
 

1945
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,750
Generations they have to commit
themselves to living on this vehicle

1946

themselves to living on this vehicle
 

1947
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,630
themselves to living on this vehicle
right I just see it happening what I see

1948
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:29,640
right I just see it happening what I see
 

1949
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,069
right I just see it happening what I see
potentially happening if we avoid

1950
00:41:32,069 --> 00:41:32,079
potentially happening if we avoid
 

1951
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:33,829
potentially happening if we avoid
self-destruction intentional or

1952
00:41:33,829 --> 00:41:33,839
self-destruction intentional or
 

1953
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:36,710
self-destruction intentional or
unintentional here on Earth is that

1954
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:36,720
unintentional here on Earth is that
 

1955
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,829
unintentional here on Earth is that
machines will do it robots that can

essentially hibernate they don't need to

1958
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:41,400
essentially hibernate they don't need to
 

1959
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,750
essentially hibernate they don't need to
do much of anything for a long long time

1960

00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,109
then they set up you know factories with
which to do this I mean this is very

1986
00:42:14,109 --> 00:42:14,119
which to do this I mean this is very
 

1987
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:17,710
which to do this I mean this is very
very futuristic but it's much more

1988
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:17,720
very futuristic but it's much more
 

1989
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,309
very futuristic but it's much more
feasible I think than sending Flesh and

you have to you know Shield yourself

2000
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:33,800
you have to you know Shield yourself
 

2001
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,190
you have to you know Shield yourself
really well that's by the way one of the

2002
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:35,200
really well that's by the way one of the
 

2003
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,349
really well that's by the way one of the
problems of going to Mars is that it's

2004
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:37,359
problems of going to Mars is that it's
 

2005
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:39,109
problems of going to Mars is that it's
not a three-day Journey like going to

2006
00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:39,119
not a three-day Journey like going to
 

2007
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,390
not a three-day Journey like going to
the Moon you're out there for the better

2008
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:41,400
the Moon you're out there for the better
 

2009
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,150
the Moon you're out there for the better
part of a year or two and you're exposed

2010
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:44,160
part of a year or two and you're exposed
 

2011
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,790
part of a year or two and you're exposed
to lots of radiation you know which

2012
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:47,800
to lots of radiation you know which
 

2013
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,030
to lots of radiation you know which
typically doesn't do well with living

2014
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:50,040
typically doesn't do well with living
 

2015
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,710
typically doesn't do well with living
tissue right or living tissue doesn't do

2016
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:52,720
tissue right or living tissue doesn't do
 

2017
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,950
tissue right or living tissue doesn't do
well with the radiation okay and and the

2018
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:54,960
well with the radiation okay and and the
 

2019
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,470
well with the radiation okay and and the
hope is that the robots that AI systems

2020
00:42:58,470 --> 00:42:58,480
hope is that the robots that AI systems
 

2021
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,510
hope is that the robots that AI systems
might be able to carry the carry

2022
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:01,520
might be able to carry the carry
 

2023
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,750
might be able to carry the carry
the the fire of Consciousness whatever

2024
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:05,760
the the fire of Consciousness whatever
 

2025
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,549
the the fire of Consciousness whatever
makes us humans yeah like a little drop

2026
00:43:08,549 --> 00:43:08,559
makes us humans yeah like a little drop
 

2027
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:10,950
makes us humans yeah like a little drop
of whatever makes us humans so special

2028
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:10,960
of whatever makes us humans so special
 

2029
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,069
of whatever makes us humans so special
not to be too poetic about it but no but

2030
00:43:13,069 --> 00:43:13,079
not to be too poetic about it but no but
 

2031
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:14,790
not to be too poetic about it but no but
I I like being poetic about it because

2032
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:14,800
I I like being poetic about it because
 

2033
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,349
I I like being poetic about it because
it's a it's an amazing question you know

2034
00:43:17,349 --> 00:43:17,359
it's a it's an amazing question you know
 

2035
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:20,349
it's a it's an amazing question you know
is there something Beyond just the bits

2036
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:20,359
is there something Beyond just the bits
 

2037
00:43:20,359 --> 00:43:22,349
is there something Beyond just the bits
the ones and zeros to us you know it's

2038
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:22,359
the ones and zeros to us you know it's
 

2039
00:43:22,359 --> 00:43:25,349
the ones and zeros to us you know it's
an interesting question um I like to

2040
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:25,359
an interesting question um I like to
 

2041
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:27,309
an interesting question um I like to
think that there there isn't anything

thought in some ways but others find it
 

2065
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:57,470

to be a horrific thought right exciting

2066
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:57,480
to be a horrific thought right exciting
 

2067
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,030
to be a horrific thought right exciting
to you I it is exciting to me as well

it's impossible to create like

it's impossible to create like
 

2075

it's impossible to create like
whatever systems we create that take

whatever systems we create that take
 

2077
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,109
whatever systems we create that take
over the world it's impossible for me to

over the world it's impossible for me to
 

2079
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:16,150
over the world it's impossible for me to
imagine that those systems will not

encompasses a lot of these attributes
that you just talked about yeah

Beyond and there's nothing much we can
 

2141
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,230
Beyond and there's nothing much we can
do about a supernova explosion that just

2142
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:33,240
do about a supernova explosion that just
 

2143
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,270
do about a supernova explosion that just
suddenly you know goes off and and and

00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:41,430
really if we want to move to other
planets outside our solar system I think

2148
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:41,440
planets outside our solar system I think
 

2149
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,670
planets outside our solar system I think
realistically that's a much better

2150

realistically that's a much better
 

2151
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,390
realistically that's a much better
option than thinking that humans will

2152
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:46,400
option than thinking that humans will
 

2153
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,390
option than thinking that humans will
actually make these gigantic Journeys

actually make these gigantic Journeys

00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,990
actually make these gigantic Journeys
and you know then I do this calculation

and you know then I do this calculation
 

2157
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,790
and you know then I do this calculation
from my class you know Einstein's

in your own frame of reference if you go
 

2165
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:00,950
in your own frame of reference if you go
close to the speed of light but then you

close to the speed of light but then you
 

2167
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,750
close to the speed of light but then you
bring in eal mc^2 and you figure out how

2168
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:03,760
bring in eal mc^2 and you figure out how
 

2169
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,510
bring in eal mc^2 and you figure out how
much energy it takes to get you

00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:06,520
much energy it takes to get you
 

2171
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,030
much energy it takes to get you

the rocket that would carry us the
 

2193
00:46:32,839 --> 00:46:35,950
the rocket that would carry us the
payload and you would need to either

2194
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:35,960
payload and you would need to either
 

2195
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,950
payload and you would need to either
store the fuel in the rocket which then

2196
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:38,960
store the fuel in the rocket which then
 

2197
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,349
store the fuel in the rocket which then
requires even more mass for the rocket

requires even more mass for the rocket
 

2199
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,870
requires even more mass for the rocket
or collect fuel along the way which you

2200
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:43,880
or collect fuel along the way which you
 

2201
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,510
or collect fuel along the way which you
know is difficult and so getting close

2202
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:46,520
know is difficult and so getting close
 

2203
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,349
know is difficult and so getting close
to the speed of light I think is not an

2204
00:46:48,349 --> 00:46:48,359
to the speed of light I think is not an
 

2205
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:50,349
to the speed of light I think is not an
option either other than for a little

2206
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:50,359
option either other than for a little
 

2207
00:46:50,359 --> 00:46:52,910
option either other than for a little
tiny thing like you know Yuri Milner and

2208
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:52,920
tiny thing like you know Yuri Milner and
 

2209
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,309
tiny thing like you know Yuri Milner and
others are thinking about this this star

2210
00:46:55,309 --> 00:46:55,319
others are thinking about this this star
 

2211
00:46:55,319 --> 00:46:57,589
others are thinking about this this star
shot project where they'll a little tiny

2212
00:46:57,589 --> 00:46:57,599
shot project where they'll a little tiny
 

2213
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:00,349
shot project where they'll a little tiny
camera to Alpha centuri 4.2 light years

2215
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,910

away they'll zip past it take a picture

2216
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:02,920
away they'll zip past it take a picture
 

2217
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,630
away they'll zip past it take a picture
of the exoplanets that we know orbit

2218
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:05,640
of the exoplanets that we know orbit
 

2219
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,430
of the exoplanets that we know orbit
that three or more star system and uh

2220
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:08,440
that three or more star system and uh
 

2221
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,870
that three or more star system and uh
say hello real quick say hello real

2222
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:09,880
say hello real quick say hello real
 

2223
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,630
say hello real quick say hello real
quickly and then send the images back to

2224
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:11,640
quickly and then send the images back to
 

2225
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,750
quickly and then send the images back to
us okay yeah so that that's a tiny

2226
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:13,760
us okay yeah so that that's a tiny
 

2227
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,430
us okay yeah so that that's a tiny
little thing right maybe you can

2228
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:15,440
little thing right maybe you can
 

2229
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,230
little thing right maybe you can
accelerate that to they're hoping 20% of

2230
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:18,240
accelerate that to they're hoping 20% of
 

2231
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,390
accelerate that to they're hoping 20% of
the speed of light with a whole bunch of

2232
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:20,400
the speed of light with a whole bunch of
 

2233
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,870
the speed of light with a whole bunch of
high-powered lasers aimed at it it's now

2234
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:22,880
high-powered lasers aimed at it it's now
 

2235
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,589
high-powered lasers aimed at it it's now
clear that other countries will allow us

2236
00:47:24,589 --> 00:47:24,599
clear that other countries will allow us
 

2237
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:26,470
clear that other countries will allow us
to do that by the way but that's a very

2238
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:26,480
to do that by the way but that's a very
 

2239
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,069
to do that by the way but that's a very
forward looking thought I mean I very

2240
00:47:28,069 --> 00:47:28,079
forward looking thought I mean I very
 

2241
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,630
forward looking thought I mean I very
much support the idea but there's a big

2242
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:30,640
much support the idea but there's a big
 

2243
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,270
much support the idea but there's a big
difference between sending a little tiny

2244
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:32,280
difference between sending a little tiny
 

2245
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:35,549
difference between sending a little tiny
camera and sending a payload of people

2246
00:47:35,549 --> 00:47:35,559
camera and sending a payload of people
 

2247
00:47:35,559 --> 00:47:39,950
camera and sending a payload of people
with equipment that could then mine the

2248
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:39,960
with equipment that could then mine the
 

2249
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,790
with equipment that could then mine the
um the resources on the exoplanet that

2250
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:42,800
um the resources on the exoplanet that
 

2251
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,069
um the resources on the exoplanet that
they reach and and then go forth and

2252
00:47:45,069 --> 00:47:45,079
they reach and and then go forth and
 

2253
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:47,589
they reach and and then go forth and
multiply right well let's let's talk

00:47:47,589 --> 00:47:47,599
multiply right well let's let's talk
 

2255
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,710
multiply right well let's let's talk
about the big Galactic things and how we

2256
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:50,720
about the big Galactic things and how we
 

2257
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,549
about the big Galactic things and how we
might be able to leverage them to travel

2258
00:47:52,549 --> 00:47:52,559
might be able to leverage them to travel
 

2259

but you know know uh ideas of wormholes

2264
00:47:59,829 --> 00:47:59,839
but you know know uh ideas of wormholes
 

2265
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:04,950
but you know know uh ideas of wormholes
and yeah the ideas at the edge of black

and yeah the ideas at the edge of black
 

2267
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,910
and yeah the ideas at the edge of black

00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:13,400
uh could be messed with yeah perhaps is
 

2273
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,549

00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:19,400
uh I mean in in your in looking out at
 

2277
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,990
uh I mean in in your in looking out at
the universe and studying it as you have

2278
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:22,000
the universe and studying it as you have
 

2279
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,829
the universe and studying it as you have
is that also a possible like a dream for

00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:28,030
is that also a possible like a dream for
you that we might be able to find Clues

Lord Kelvin on the other hand I think we

2322
00:49:16,589 --> 00:49:16,599
Lord Kelvin on the other hand I think we
 

2323
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:19,470
Lord Kelvin on the other hand I think we
know a lot more now about what we know

2324
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:19,480
know a lot more now about what we know
 

2325
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,910
know a lot more now about what we know
and what we don't know and what the

2326
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:20,920
and what we don't know and what the
 

2327
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:24,069
and what we don't know and what the
physical limitations are and to me most

2328
00:49:24,069 --> 00:49:24,079
physical limitations are and to me most
 

2329
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:27,589
physical limitations are and to me most
of these schemes if not all of them seem

2330
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:27,599
of these schemes if not all of them seem
 

2331
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,789
of these schemes if not all of them seem
very far-fetched if not impossible so

2332
00:49:30,789 --> 00:49:30,799
very far-fetched if not impossible so
 

2333
00:49:30,799 --> 00:49:33,510
very far-fetched if not impossible so
travel through wormholes for example you

2334
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:33,520
travel through wormholes for example you
 

2335
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,670
travel through wormholes for example you
know it appears that for a non-rotating

2336
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:36,680
know it appears that for a non-rotating
 

2337
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:39,710
know it appears that for a non-rotating
black hole that's just a complete no-o

black hole that's just a complete no-o
because the The Singularity is a

2340
00:49:41,349 --> 00:49:41,359
because the The Singularity is a
 

2341
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:43,470
because the The Singularity is a
point-like singularity and you have to

2342
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:43,480
point-like singularity and you have to
 

2343
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,150
point-like singularity and you have to
reach it to Traverse the Wormhole and

2344
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:46,160
reach it to Traverse the Wormhole and
 

2345
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,510
reach it to Traverse the Wormhole and
you get squished by The Singularity okay

2346
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:49,520
you get squished by The Singularity okay
 

2347
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,589
you get squished by The Singularity okay
now for a rotating black hole it turns

2348
00:49:51,589 --> 00:49:51,599
now for a rotating black hole it turns
 

2349
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:54,030
now for a rotating black hole it turns
out there is a way to pass through the

00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:56,200
Event Horizon the boundary of the black
 

2353
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,950
Event Horizon the boundary of the black
hole and avoid the singularity and go

2354
00:49:58,950 --> 00:49:58,960
hole and avoid the singularity and go
 

2355
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,109
hole and avoid the singularity and go
out the other side or even Traverse the

2356
00:50:02,109 --> 00:50:02,119
out the other side or even Traverse the
 

2357
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:04,190
out the other side or even Traverse the
the doughnut hole like singularity in

2358
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:04,200
the doughnut hole like singularity in
 

2359
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,630
the doughnut hole like singularity in
the case of a rotating black hole it's a

2360
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:05,640
the case of a rotating black hole it's a
 

2361
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,910
the case of a rotating black hole it's a
ring Singularity so there's actually two

2362
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:07,920
ring Singularity so there's actually two
 

2363
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,109
ring Singularity so there's actually two
theoretical ways you could get through a

2364
00:50:10,109 --> 00:50:10,119
theoretical ways you could get through a
 

2365
00:50:10,119 --> 00:50:12,349
theoretical ways you could get through a
rotating black hole or a Charged black

2366
00:50:12,349 --> 00:50:12,359
rotating black hole or a Charged black
 

2367
00:50:12,359 --> 00:50:14,430
rotating black hole or a Charged black
hole not that we expect charged black

2368
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:14,440
hole not that we expect charged black
 

2369
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,349
hole not that we expect charged black
holes to exist in nature because they

2370
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:16,359
holes to exist in nature because they
 

2371
00:50:16,359 --> 00:50:18,349
holes to exist in nature because they
would quickly bring in the opposite

2372
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:18,359
would quickly bring in the opposite
 

2373
00:50:18,359 --> 00:50:20,910
would quickly bring in the opposite
charge so as to neutralize themselves

2374
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:20,920
charge so as to neutralize themselves
 

2375
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,829
charge so as to neutralize themselves
but rotating black holes definitely

2376
00:50:22,829 --> 00:50:22,839
but rotating black holes definitely
 

2377
00:50:22,839 --> 00:50:24,870
but rotating black holes definitely
reality we we now have good evidence for

2378
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:24,880
reality we we now have good evidence for
 

2379
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,829
reality we we now have good evidence for
them do they have Travers ible wormholes

2380
00:50:28,829 --> 00:50:28,839
them do they have Travers ible wormholes
 

2381
00:50:28,839 --> 00:50:31,309
them do they have Travers ible wormholes
probably not because it's still the case

2382
00:50:31,309 --> 00:50:31,319
probably not because it's still the case
 

2383
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:34,190
probably not because it's still the case
that when you go in you go in with so

2384
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:34,200
that when you go in you go in with so
 

2385
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,630
that when you go in you go in with so
much energy that it it it either

2386
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:36,640
much energy that it it it either
 

2387
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,950
much energy that it it it either
squeezes the Wormhole shut or you

2388
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:39,960
squeezes the Wormhole shut or you
 

2389
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,670
squeezes the Wormhole shut or you
encounter a whole bunch of incoming and

2390
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:42,680
encounter a whole bunch of incoming and
 

2391
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:46,150
encounter a whole bunch of incoming and
outgoing energy that vaporizes you it's

2392
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:46,160
outgoing energy that vaporizes you it's
 

2393
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,309
outgoing energy that vaporizes you it's
called the mass inflation instability

2394
00:50:48,309 --> 00:50:48,319
called the mass inflation instability
 

2395
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:50,750
called the mass inflation instability
and it just sort of vaporizes you

2396
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:50,760
and it just sort of vaporizes you
 

2397
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,270
and it just sort of vaporizes you
nevertheless you know you could imagine

2398
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:52,280
nevertheless you know you could imagine
 

2399
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,870
nevertheless you know you could imagine
well you're in some vapor form but if

2400
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:53,880
well you're in some vapor form but if
 

2401
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,109
well you're in some vapor form but if
you make it through maybe you could you

2402
00:50:56,109 --> 00:50:56,119
you make it through maybe you could you
 

2403
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:58,630
you make it through maybe you could you
know re form or something so it's still

2404
00:50:58,630 --> 00:50:58,640
know re form or something so it's still
 

2405
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,309
know re form or something so it's still
information yeah it's still information

2406
00:51:00,309 --> 00:51:00,319
information yeah it's still information
 

2407
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:02,030
information yeah it's still information
it's scrambled information but there's a

2408
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:02,040
it's scrambled information but there's a
 

2409
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,789
it's scrambled information but there's a
way maybe of bringing it back right but

2410
00:51:04,789 --> 00:51:04,799
way maybe of bringing it back right but
 

2411
00:51:04,799 --> 00:51:07,870
way maybe of bringing it back right but
then the thing that really bothers me is

2412
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:07,880
then the thing that really bothers me is
 

2413
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,109
then the thing that really bothers me is
that as soon as you have this

2414
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:11,119
that as soon as you have this
 

2415
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:13,670
that as soon as you have this
possibility of traversal of a wormhole

2416
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:13,680
possibility of traversal of a wormhole
 

2417
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,430
possibility of traversal of a wormhole
you have to come to grips with a

2418
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:15,440
you have to come to grips with a
 

2419
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,630
you have to come to grips with a
fundamental problem and that is that you

2420
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:17,640
fundamental problem and that is that you
 

2421
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,589
fundamental problem and that is that you
could come back to your Universe At A

2422
00:51:20,589 --> 00:51:20,599
could come back to your Universe At A
 

2423
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:24,430
could come back to your Universe At A
Time prior to your leaving and you could

2424
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:24,440
Time prior to your leaving and you could
 

2425
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,150
Time prior to your leaving and you could
essentially prevent your grandparents

2426
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:26,160
essentially prevent your grandparents
 

2427
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,870
essentially prevent your grandparents
from meeting this is called the

2428
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:27,880
from meeting this is called the
 

2429
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,870
from meeting this is called the
grandfather Paradox right and if they

2430
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:29,880
grandfather Paradox right and if they
 

2431
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,510
grandfather Paradox right and if they
never met and if your parents were never

2432
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:31,520
never met and if your parents were never
 

2433
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,990
never met and if your parents were never
born and if you were never born how

2434
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:34,000
born and if you were never born how
 

2435
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,990
born and if you were never born how
would you have made the journey to

2436
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:39,000
would you have made the journey to
 

2437
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,430
would you have made the journey to
prevent the history from allowing you to

2438
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:42,440
prevent the history from allowing you to
 

2439
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,750
prevent the history from allowing you to
exist right it's it's a it's a causal

2440
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:44,760
exist right it's it's a it's a causal
 

2441
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,390
exist right it's it's a it's a causal
it's a violation of causality of cause

2442
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:47,400
it's a violation of causality of cause
 

2443
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,910
it's a violation of causality of cause
and effect now physicists such as myself

2444
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:49,920
and effect now physicists such as myself
 

2445
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:53,549
and effect now physicists such as myself
take causality violation very very

2446
00:51:53,549 --> 00:51:53,559
take causality violation very very
 

2447
00:51:53,559 --> 00:51:55,950
take causality violation very very
seriously we've never seen it you took a

2448
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:55,960
seriously we've never seen it you took a
 

2449
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,589
seriously we've never seen it you took a
stand yeah I mean you know I mean it's

2450
00:51:58,589 --> 00:51:58,599
stand yeah I mean you know I mean it's
 

2451
00:51:58,599 --> 00:52:00,349
stand yeah I mean you know I mean it's
one of these right Back to the Future

2452
00:52:00,349 --> 00:52:00,359
one of these right Back to the Future
 

2453
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:02,750
one of these right Back to the Future
type movies right and you have to work

2454
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:02,760
type movies right and you have to work
 

2455
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:05,150
type movies right and you have to work
things out in such a way that you don't

2456
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:05,160
things out in such a way that you don't
 

2457
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,230
things out in such a way that you don't
mess things up right some people say

2458
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:07,240
mess things up right some people say
 

2459
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,069
mess things up right some people say
that well you come back to the universe

2460
00:52:09,069 --> 00:52:09,079
that well you come back to the universe
 

2461
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:11,309
that well you come back to the universe
but you come back in such a way that you

2462
00:52:11,309 --> 00:52:11,319
but you come back in such a way that you
 

2463
00:52:11,319 --> 00:52:15,630
but you come back in such a way that you
cannot affect your journey um but then I

2464
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:15,640
cannot affect your journey um but then I
 

2465
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,870
cannot affect your journey um but then I
mean that that seems kind of uh

2466
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:17,880
mean that that seems kind of uh
 

2467
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,670
mean that that seems kind of uh
contrived to me or some say that you end

2468
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:20,680
contrived to me or some say that you end
 

2469
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,829
contrived to me or some say that you end
up in a different universe and this also

2470
00:52:22,829 --> 00:52:22,839
up in a different universe and this also
 

2471
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:25,309
up in a different universe and this also
goes into the the many different types

2472
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:25,319
goes into the the many different types
 

2473
00:52:25,319 --> 00:52:27,109
goes into the the many different types
of the Multiverse hypoth esis and the

2474
00:52:27,109 --> 00:52:27,119
of the Multiverse hypoth esis and the
 

2475
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:29,190
of the Multiverse hypoth esis and the
many worlds interpretation and all that

2476
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:29,200
many worlds interpretation and all that
 

2477
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,510
many worlds interpretation and all that
but again then it's not the universe

2478
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:31,520
but again then it's not the universe
 

2479
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,630
but again then it's not the universe
from which you left right and you don't

2480
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:34,640
from which you left right and you don't
 

2481
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,589
from which you left right and you don't
come back to the universe from which you

2482
00:52:36,589 --> 00:52:36,599
come back to the universe from which you
 

2483
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:39,030
come back to the universe from which you
left and so you're not really going back

2484
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:39,040
left and so you're not really going back
 

2485
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,230
left and so you're not really going back
in time to the same universe and you're

2486
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:42,240
in time to the same universe and you're
 

2487
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,309
in time to the same universe and you're
not even going forward in time

2488
00:52:44,309 --> 00:52:44,319
not even going forward in time
 

2489
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:46,230
not even going forward in time
necessarily then to the same universe

2490
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:46,240
necessarily then to the same universe
 

2491
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,870
necessarily then to the same universe
right you're ending up in some other

2492
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:47,880
right you're ending up in some other
 

2493
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:51,630
right you're ending up in some other
universe so so you've you what have you

2494
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:51,640
universe so so you've you what have you
 

2495
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:54,950
universe so so you've you what have you
achieved right you you've traveled you

2496
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:54,960
achieved right you you've traveled you
 

2497
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,630
achieved right you you've traveled you
traveled you uh you ended up in a

2498
00:52:57,630 --> 00:52:57,640
traveled you uh you ended up in a
 

2499
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,950
traveled you uh you ended up in a
different place than you started in more

2500
00:52:59,950 --> 00:52:59,960
different place than you started in more
 

2501
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,670
different place than you started in more
ways than one yeah and then then there's

2502
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:01,680
ways than one yeah and then then there's
 

2503
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,349
ways than one yeah and then then there's
this idea um the aluer drive where you

2504
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:05,359
this idea um the aluer drive where you
 

2505
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:08,789
this idea um the aluer drive where you
warp space time in front of you so as to

2506
00:53:08,789 --> 00:53:08,799
warp space time in front of you so as to
 

2507
00:53:08,799 --> 00:53:10,710
warp space time in front of you so as to
greatly reduce the distance and you can

2508
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:10,720
greatly reduce the distance and you can
 

2509
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,750
greatly reduce the distance and you can
expand the space time behind you so

2510
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:12,760
expand the space time behind you so
 

2511
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,030
expand the space time behind you so
you're sort of riding a wave through

2512
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:15,040
you're sort of riding a wave through
 

2513
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,190
you're sort of riding a wave through
SpaceTime but the problem I see with

2514
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:17,200
SpaceTime but the problem I see with
 

2515
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,069
SpaceTime but the problem I see with
that beyond the Practical difficulties

2516
00:53:19,069 --> 00:53:19,079
that beyond the Practical difficulties
 

2517
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:21,069
that beyond the Practical difficulties
and the energy requirements and by the

2518
00:53:21,069 --> 00:53:21,079
and the energy requirements and by the
 

2519
00:53:21,079 --> 00:53:23,470
and the energy requirements and by the
way how do you get out of this bubble

2520
00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:23,480
way how do you get out of this bubble
 

2521
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,309
way how do you get out of this bubble
through which you're you know riding

2522
00:53:25,309 --> 00:53:25,319
through which you're you know riding
 

2523
00:53:25,319 --> 00:53:27,109
through which you're you know riding
this wave of space time

2524
00:53:27,109 --> 00:53:27,119
this wave of space time
 

2525
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:29,150
this wave of space time
miguelier acknowledged all these things

2526
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:29,160
miguelier acknowledged all these things
 

2527
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,910
miguelier acknowledged all these things
he said this is purely theoretical

2528
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:30,920
he said this is purely theoretical
 

2529
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:33,630
he said this is purely theoretical
fanciful and all that but a fundamental

2530
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:33,640
fanciful and all that but a fundamental
 

2531
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,870
fanciful and all that but a fundamental
problem I see is that you'd have to get

2532
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:35,880
problem I see is that you'd have to get
 

2533
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,109
problem I see is that you'd have to get
to those places in front of you so as to

2534
00:53:39,109 --> 00:53:39,119
to those places in front of you so as to
 

2535
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:42,030
to those places in front of you so as to
change the shape of SpaceTime so as to

2536
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:42,040
change the shape of SpaceTime so as to
 

2537
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,750
change the shape of SpaceTime so as to
make the journey quickly but but to get

2538
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:44,760
make the journey quickly but but to get
 

2539
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,589
make the journey quickly but but to get
there you you got there in the normal

2540
00:53:46,589 --> 00:53:46,599
there you you got there in the normal
 

2541
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:49,230
there you you got there in the normal
way at a speed considerably less than

2542
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:49,240
way at a speed considerably less than
 

2543
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,990
way at a speed considerably less than
that of light so in a sense you you

2544
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:52,000
that of light so in a sense you you
 

2545
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,870
that of light so in a sense you you
haven't saved any time right you might

2546
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:53,880
haven't saved any time right you might
 

2547
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:56,430
haven't saved any time right you might
as well have just taken that journey and

2548
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:56,440
as well have just taken that journey and
 

2549
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,309
as well have just taken that journey and
and gotten to where you were

2550
00:53:58,309 --> 00:53:58,319
and gotten to where you were
 

2551
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,829
and gotten to where you were
going yeah there's a right you what have

2552
00:54:00,829 --> 00:54:00,839
going yeah there's a right you what have
 

2553
00:54:00,839 --> 00:54:02,750
going yeah there's a right you what have
you done you it's not like you snap your

2554
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:02,760
you done you it's not like you snap your
 

2555
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,430
you done you it's not like you snap your
fingers and say okay let that space

2556
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:05,440
fingers and say okay let that space
 

2557
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,990
fingers and say okay let that space
there be compressed and then I'll make

2558
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:07,000
there be compressed and then I'll make
 

2559
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,230
there be compressed and then I'll make
it over to Alpha centuri in the next

2560
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:09,240
it over to Alpha centuri in the next
 

2561
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,510
it over to Alpha centuri in the next
month you can't snap your fingers and do

2562
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:11,520
month you can't snap your fingers and do
 

2563
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,270
month you can't snap your fingers and do
that yeah and but yeah we're sort of

2564
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:15,280
that yeah and but yeah we're sort of
 

2565
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,589
that yeah and but yeah we're sort of
assuming that we can fix all the

2566
00:54:16,589 --> 00:54:16,599
assuming that we can fix all the
 

2567
00:54:16,599 --> 00:54:18,510
assuming that we can fix all the
biological stuff that requires for

2568
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:18,520
biological stuff that requires for
 

2569
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:21,030
biological stuff that requires for
humans to persist uh uh persist through

2570
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:21,040
humans to persist uh uh persist through
 

2571
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,630
humans to persist uh uh persist through
that whole process because ultimately it

2572
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:23,640
that whole process because ultimately it
 

2573
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,270
that whole process because ultimately it
might boil down to just extending the

2574
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:25,280
might boil down to just extending the
 

2575
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,950
might boil down to just extending the
life of the of the human in some form

2576
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:27,960
life of the of the human in some form
 

2577
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,270
life of the of the human in some form
whether it's through the robot through

2578
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:29,280
whether it's through the robot through
 

2579
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,349
whether it's through the robot through
the digital form or through or actually

2580
00:54:31,349 --> 00:54:31,359
the digital form or through or actually
 

2581
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:33,470
the digital form or through or actually
just figuring out genetically how to

2582
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:33,480
just figuring out genetically how to
 

2583
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,870
just figuring out genetically how to
live forever CU that Journey that you

2584
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:35,880
live forever CU that Journey that you
 

2585
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:38,190
live forever CU that Journey that you
mentioned the long journey might be

2586
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:38,200
mentioned the long journey might be
 

2587
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:41,750
mentioned the long journey might be
different if somehow our understanding

2588
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:41,760
different if somehow our understanding
 

2589
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,470
different if somehow our understanding
of genetics of our understanding of our

2590
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:43,480
of genetics of our understanding of our
 

2591
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,309
of genetics of our understanding of our
own biology all that kind of stuff would

2592
00:54:46,309 --> 00:54:46,319
own biology all that kind of stuff would
 

2593
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:48,950
own biology all that kind of stuff would
uh that's another trajectory if you

2594
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:48,960
uh that's another trajectory if you
 

2595
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,870
uh that's another trajectory if you
could put us into some sort of suspended

2596
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:50,880
could put us into some sort of suspended
 

2597
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,470
could put us into some sort of suspended
animation you know hibernation or

2598
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:52,480
animation you know hibernation or
 

2599
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,750
animation you know hibernation or
something and greatly increase the

2600
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:54,760
something and greatly increase the
 

2601
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,910
something and greatly increase the
lifetime and so these 10,000 Generations

2602
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:56,920
lifetime and so these 10,000 Generations
 

2603
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,589
lifetime and so these 10,000 Generations
I talked about what do they care it's

2604
00:54:58,589 --> 00:54:58,599
I talked about what do they care it's
 

2605
00:54:58,599 --> 00:55:00,829
I talked about what do they care it's
just one generation and they're asleep

2606
00:55:00,829 --> 00:55:00,839
just one generation and they're asleep
 

2607
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:04,510
just one generation and they're asleep
okay long nap so then you can do it it's

2608
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:04,520
okay long nap so then you can do it it's
 

2609
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:05,829
okay long nap so then you can do it it's
still not easy right because you got

2610
00:55:05,829 --> 00:55:05,839
still not easy right because you got
 

2611
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:07,910
still not easy right because you got
some big old huge colony and that just

2612
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:07,920
some big old huge colony and that just
 

2613
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,750
some big old huge colony and that just
through E equals MC squ right that's a

2614
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:09,760
through E equals MC squ right that's a
 

2615
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,349
through E equals MC squ right that's a
lot of mass that's a lot of stuff to um

2616
00:55:12,349 --> 00:55:12,359
lot of mass that's a lot of stuff to um
 

2617
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:15,789
lot of mass that's a lot of stuff to um
to accelerate the Newtonian kinetic

2618
00:55:15,789 --> 00:55:15,799
to accelerate the Newtonian kinetic
 

2619
00:55:15,799 --> 00:55:18,870
to accelerate the Newtonian kinetic
energy is gigantic right so you're still

2620
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:18,880
energy is gigantic right so you're still
 

2621
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,029
energy is gigantic right so you're still
not home free but at least you're not

2622
00:55:21,029 --> 00:55:21,039
not home free but at least you're not
 

2623
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:24,069
not home free but at least you're not
trying to do it in a short amount of

trying to do it in a short amount of
 

2625
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:27,029
trying to do it in a short amount of
clock time right which if you look at

2626
00:55:27,029 --> 00:55:27,039
clock time right which if you look at
 

2627
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:30,990
clock time right which if you look at
eal mc^2 requires truly unfathomable

eal mc^2 requires truly unfathomable
 

2629
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,589
eal mc^2 requires truly unfathomable

sort of it's it's your rest mass m c^2
 

2633
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:40,670
sort of it's it's your rest mass m c^2

2643
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,230
one that one over the root of 1us v^2
over c^2 approaches Infinity MH so if

2644
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:54,240
over c^2 approaches Infinity MH so if
 

2645
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,750
over c^2 approaches Infinity MH so if
you wanted to do it in zero time you'd

2646
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:56,760
you wanted to do it in zero time you'd
 

2647
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,630
you wanted to do it in zero time you'd
need an infinite amount of energy that's

00:55:58,630 --> 00:55:58,640
need an infinite amount of energy that's

00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:01,789
need an infinite amount of energy that's
basically why you can't reach let alone

moving through a pre-existing space it's
 

2655
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:09,510
moving through a pre-existing space it's
that it takes an infinite amount of

00:56:13,309 --> 00:56:13,319
energy to do so so that's talking about
 

2659
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:17,190
energy to do so so that's talking about
us going somewhere what

2660
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:17,200

 

2661
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,710

about one of the things that inspires a

2662
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:19,720
about one of the things that inspires a
 

2663
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,630
about one of the things that inspires a
lot of folks including myself is the

2664
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:21,640
lot of folks including myself is the
 

2665
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:24,470
lot of folks including myself is the
possibility that there's other that this

2666
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:24,480
possibility that there's other that this
 

2667
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,349
possibility that there's other that this
this conversation is happening and

2668
00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:26,359
this conversation is happening and
 

2669
00:56:26,359 --> 00:56:29,270
this conversation is happening and
another planet in different forms with

2670
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:29,280
another planet in different forms with
 

2671
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:34,230
another planet in different forms with
uh intelligent life

2672
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:34,240

 

2673
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,390

forms well first we could

2674
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:37,400
forms well first we could
 

2675
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,230
forms well first we could
start as a cosmologist what's your

2676
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:40,240
start as a cosmologist what's your
 

2677
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,349
start as a cosmologist what's your
intuition about whether there is or

2678
00:56:42,349 --> 00:56:42,359
intuition about whether there is or
 

2679
00:56:42,359 --> 00:56:45,390
intuition about whether there is or
isn't intelligent life out there outside

2680
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:45,400
isn't intelligent life out there outside
 

2681
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,829
isn't intelligent life out there outside
of our own yeah I would say I'm one of

2682
00:56:47,829 --> 00:56:47,839
of our own yeah I would say I'm one of
 

2683
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:50,309
of our own yeah I would say I'm one of
the pessimists in that I I don't

2684
00:56:50,309 --> 00:56:50,319
the pessimists in that I I don't
 

2685
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:51,750
the pessimists in that I I don't
necessarily think that we're the only

2686
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:51,760
necessarily think that we're the only
 

2687
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,029
necessarily think that we're the only
ones in the observable universe which

2688
00:56:54,029 --> 00:56:54,039
ones in the observable universe which
 

2689
00:56:54,039 --> 00:56:55,230
ones in the observable universe which
goes out you

2690
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:55,240
goes out you
 

2691
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:58,829
goes out you
know roughly 14 billion years in light

2692
00:56:58,829 --> 00:56:58,839
know roughly 14 billion years in light
 

2693
00:56:58,839 --> 00:57:01,190
know roughly 14 billion years in light
travel time and more like you know 46

2694
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:01,200
travel time and more like you know 46
 

2695
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,069
travel time and more like you know 46
billion years when you take into account

2696
00:57:03,069 --> 00:57:03,079
billion years when you take into account
 

2697
00:57:03,079 --> 00:57:05,349
billion years when you take into account
the expansion of space so the diameter

2698
00:57:05,349 --> 00:57:05,359
the expansion of space so the diameter
 

2699
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:06,990
the expansion of space so the diameter
of our observable universe is something

2700
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:07,000
of our observable universe is something
 

2701
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,710
of our observable universe is something
like you know 90 992 billion Lighty

2702
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:08,720
like you know 90 992 billion Lighty
 

2703
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,309
like you know 90 992 billion Lighty
years that

2704
00:57:10,309 --> 00:57:10,319
years that
 

2705
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:12,829
years that
encompasses you know 100 billion to a

2706
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:12,839
encompasses you know 100 billion to a
 

2707
00:57:12,839 --> 00:57:16,069
encompasses you know 100 billion to a
trillion galaxies with um you know 100

2708
00:57:16,069 --> 00:57:16,079
trillion galaxies with um you know 100
 

2709
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:17,870
trillion galaxies with um you know 100
billion stars each so now you're talking

2710
00:57:17,870 --> 00:57:17,880
billion stars each so now you're talking
 

2711
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:20,190
billion stars each so now you're talking
about something like 10 to the 22nd 10

2712
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:20,200
about something like 10 to the 22nd 10
 

2713
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:23,190
about something like 10 to the 22nd 10
to the 23rd power stars and roughly an

2714
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:23,200
to the 23rd power stars and roughly an
 

2715
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,870
to the 23rd power stars and roughly an
equal number of earthlike planets and so

2716
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:25,880
equal number of earthlike planets and so
 

2717
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:26,950
equal number of earthlike planets and so
on

2718
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:26,960
on
 

2719
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,589
on
um so there there there may well be uh

2720
00:57:30,589 --> 00:57:30,599
um so there there there may well be uh
 

2721
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:32,670
um so there there there may well be uh
other intelligent life but your your

2722
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:32,680
other intelligent life but your your
 

2723
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,789
other intelligent life but your your
sense is our Galaxy's not teaming with

2724
00:57:34,789 --> 00:57:34,799
sense is our Galaxy's not teaming with
 

2725
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:36,670
sense is our Galaxy's not teaming with
life yeah our galaxy our Milky Way

2726
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:36,680
life yeah our galaxy our Milky Way
 

2727
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:39,470
life yeah our galaxy our Milky Way
galaxy with several hundred billion

2728
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:39,480
galaxy with several hundred billion
 

2729
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,549
galaxy with several hundred billion
stars and and potentially habitable

2730
00:57:41,549 --> 00:57:41,559
stars and and potentially habitable
 

2731
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:43,510
stars and and potentially habitable
planets is not teeming with intelligent

2732
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:43,520
planets is not teeming with intelligent
 

2733
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,829
planets is not teeming with intelligent
life intelligent yeah I wouldn't well

2734
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:45,839
life intelligent yeah I wouldn't well
 

2735
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:47,390
life intelligent yeah I wouldn't well
I'll get to the Primitive life the

2736
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:47,400
I'll get to the Primitive life the
 

2737
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:51,430
I'll get to the Primitive life the
bacteria in a moment but um you know we

2738
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:51,440
bacteria in a moment but um you know we
 

2739
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,109
bacteria in a moment but um you know we
we may well be the only ones in our

2740
00:57:53,109 --> 00:57:53,119
we may well be the only ones in our
 

2741
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,470
we may well be the only ones in our
Milky Way galaxy at most a handful I'd

2742
00:57:56,470 --> 00:57:56,480
Milky Way galaxy at most a handful I'd
 

2743
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,990
Milky Way galaxy at most a handful I'd
say but I'd probably side with the

2744
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:00,000
say but I'd probably side with the
 

2745
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,630
say but I'd probably side with the
school of thought that suggests we're

2746
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:01,640
school of thought that suggests we're
 

2747
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:04,430
school of thought that suggests we're
the only ones in our own Galaxy just

2748
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:04,440
the only ones in our own Galaxy just
 

2749
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:08,549
the only ones in our own Galaxy just
because I don't see human intelligence

2750
00:58:08,549 --> 00:58:08,559
because I don't see human intelligence
 

2751
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:12,510
because I don't see human intelligence
as being a a natural evolutionary path

2752
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:12,520
as being a a natural evolutionary path
 

2753
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,870
as being a a natural evolutionary path
for life um I mean there's a there's a

2754
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:14,880
for life um I mean there's a there's a
 

2755
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,510
for life um I mean there's a there's a
number of arguments first of all there's

2756
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:16,520
number of arguments first of all there's
 

2757
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,789
number of arguments first of all there's
been more than 10 billion species of

2758
00:58:18,789 --> 00:58:18,799
been more than 10 billion species of
 

2759
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:21,710
been more than 10 billion species of
life on Earth in its history yes uh

2760
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:21,720
life on Earth in its history yes uh
 

2761
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:24,349
life on Earth in its history yes uh
nothing has approached our level of

2762
00:58:24,349 --> 00:58:24,359
nothing has approached our level of
 

2763
00:58:24,359 --> 00:58:26,390
nothing has approached our level of
intelligence and mechanical ability and

2764
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:26,400
intelligence and mechanical ability and
 

2765
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,870
intelligence and mechanical ability and
curiosity you know whales and dolphins

2766
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:28,880
curiosity you know whales and dolphins
 

2767
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,829
curiosity you know whales and dolphins
appear to be reasonably intelligent but

2768
00:58:30,829 --> 00:58:30,839
appear to be reasonably intelligent but
 

2769
00:58:30,839 --> 00:58:33,109
appear to be reasonably intelligent but
there's no evidence that they can think

2770
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:33,119
there's no evidence that they can think
 

2771
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:34,670
there's no evidence that they can think
abstract thoughts that they're curious

2772
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:34,680
abstract thoughts that they're curious
 

2773
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,309
abstract thoughts that they're curious
about the world they certainly can't

2774
00:58:36,309 --> 00:58:36,319
about the world they certainly can't
 

2775
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:38,270
about the world they certainly can't
build machines with which to study the

2776
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:38,280
build machines with which to study the
 

2777
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:41,829
build machines with which to study the
world um so that's one argument

2778
00:58:41,829 --> 00:58:41,839
world um so that's one argument
 

2779
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:45,190
world um so that's one argument
secondly we came about as early hominids

2780
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:45,200
secondly we came about as early hominids
 

2781
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,470
secondly we came about as early hominids
only four or five million years ago and

2782
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:47,480
only four or five million years ago and
 

2783
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:50,150
only four or five million years ago and
as H Homo sapiens only about a quarter

2784
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:50,160
as H Homo sapiens only about a quarter
 

2785
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,309
as H Homo sapiens only about a quarter
of a million years ago so for the vast

2786
00:58:53,309 --> 00:58:53,319
of a million years ago so for the vast
 

2787
00:58:53,319 --> 00:58:55,309
of a million years ago so for the vast
majority of the history of life on Earth

2788
00:58:55,309 --> 00:58:55,319
majority of the history of life on Earth
 

2789
00:58:55,319 --> 00:58:57,510
majority of the history of life on Earth
an intelligent alien zipping by Earth

2790
00:58:57,510 --> 00:58:57,520
an intelligent alien zipping by Earth
 

2791
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,870
an intelligent alien zipping by Earth
would have said there's nothing

2792
00:58:58,870 --> 00:58:58,880
would have said there's nothing
 

2793
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,910
would have said there's nothing
particularly intelligent or mechanically

2794
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:00,920
particularly intelligent or mechanically
 

2795
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:04,710
particularly intelligent or mechanically
able on Earth okay yeah thirdly it's not

2796
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:04,720
able on Earth okay yeah thirdly it's not
 

2797
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:08,190
able on Earth okay yeah thirdly it's not
clear that our intelligence is a

2798
00:59:08,190 --> 00:59:08,200
clear that our intelligence is a
 

2799
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,789
clear that our intelligence is a
long-term evolutionary Advantage now

2800
00:59:10,789 --> 00:59:10,799
long-term evolutionary Advantage now
 

2801
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:12,630
long-term evolutionary Advantage now
it's clear that in the last 100 years

2802
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:12,640
it's clear that in the last 100 years
 

2803
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,910
it's clear that in the last 100 years
200 years we've improved the lives of

2804
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:14,920
200 years we've improved the lives of
 

2805
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:17,309
200 years we've improved the lives of
millions hundreds of millions of people

2806
00:59:17,309 --> 00:59:17,319
millions hundreds of millions of people
 

2807
00:59:17,319 --> 00:59:19,430
millions hundreds of millions of people
but at the risk of potentially

2808
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:19,440
but at the risk of potentially
 

2809
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,190
but at the risk of potentially
destroying ourselves either

2810
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:21,200
destroying ourselves either
 

2811
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,069
destroying ourselves either
intentionally or unintentionally or

2812
00:59:23,069 --> 00:59:23,079
intentionally or unintentionally or
 

2813
00:59:23,079 --> 00:59:26,109
intentionally or unintentionally or
through neglect as we discussed before

2814
00:59:26,109 --> 00:59:26,119
through neglect as we discussed before
 

2815
00:59:26,119 --> 00:59:28,670
through neglect as we discussed before
that's a really interesting point which

2816
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:28,680
that's a really interesting point which
 

2817
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:31,990
that's a really interesting point which
is it's possible that their huge amount

2818
00:59:31,990 --> 00:59:32,000
is it's possible that their huge amount
 

2819
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,109
is it's possible that their huge amount
of intelligent civilizations have been

2820
00:59:34,109 --> 00:59:34,119
of intelligent civilizations have been
 

2821
00:59:34,119 --> 00:59:36,589
of intelligent civilizations have been
born even through our galaxy but they

2822
00:59:36,589 --> 00:59:36,599
born even through our galaxy but they
 

2823
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:39,109
born even through our galaxy but they
live very briefly and they die flash

2824
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:39,119
live very briefly and they die flash
 

2825
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:41,109
live very briefly and they die flash

fourth issue and that is the you know
 

2831
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,390
fourth issue and that is the you know
the fairy Paradox if they're common

2832
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:49,400
the fairy Paradox if they're common
 

2833
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:52,349
the fairy Paradox if they're common
where the hell are they you know yeah

2834
00:59:52,349 --> 00:59:52,359
where the hell are they you know yeah
 

2835
00:59:52,359 --> 00:59:54,390
where the hell are they you know yeah
not withstanding the various UFO reports

2836
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:54,400
not withstanding the various UFO reports
 

2837
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,029
not withstanding the various UFO reports
in Roswell and all that they just don't

00:59:56,029 --> 00:59:56,039
in Roswell and all that they just don't
 

2839
00:59:56,039 --> 00:59:58,470
in Roswell and all that they just don't
don't meet the bar they don't clear the

2840
00:59:58,470 --> 00:59:58,480
don't meet the bar they don't clear the
 

2841
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,029
don't meet the bar they don't clear the

bar of scientific scientific evidence in
 

2843
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:03,630
bar of scientific scientific evidence in
my opinion okay so you know there's

2844
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:03,640
my opinion okay so you know there's
 

2845
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,069
my opinion okay so you know there's
there's no clear evidence that they've

2846
01:00:05,069 --> 01:00:05,079
there's no clear evidence that they've
 

2847
01:00:05,079 --> 01:00:08,349
there's no clear evidence that they've
ever visited us on Earth here so and you

2848
01:00:08,349 --> 01:00:08,359
ever visited us on Earth here so and you
 

2849
01:00:08,359 --> 01:00:10,670
ever visited us on Earth here so and you
know SEI has been now the search for

01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:10,680
know SEI has been now the search for
 

2851
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,390
know SEI has been now the search for
extraterrestrial intelligence has been

2852
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:12,400
extraterrestrial intelligence has been
 

2853
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,390
extraterrestrial intelligence has been
scanning the skies and true we've only

2854
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:14,400
scanning the skies and true we've only
 

2855
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,069
scanning the skies and true we've only
looked a couple hundred light years out

2856
01:00:16,069 --> 01:00:16,079
looked a couple hundred light years out
 

2857
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:17,789
looked a couple hundred light years out
and that's a tiny fraction of the whole

2858
01:00:17,789 --> 01:00:17,799
and that's a tiny fraction of the whole
 

2859
01:00:17,799 --> 01:00:20,069
and that's a tiny fraction of the whole

right the chemical evolution of our
 

2877
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,470
right the chemical evolution of our
galaxy was such that billions of years

galaxy was such that billions of years
 

2879
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:46,309
galaxy was such that billions of years
ago nuclear processing and stars had

ago nuclear processing and stars had
 

2881
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:49,349

elements to have formed earthlike
 

2887
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:55,029
elements to have formed earthlike
planets even billions of years ago so

2888
01:00:55,029 --> 01:00:55,039
planets even billions of years ago so
 

2889
01:00:55,039 --> 01:00:56,870
planets even billions of years ago so
there could be civiliz that are billions

2890
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:56,880
there could be civiliz that are billions
 

2891
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,270
there could be civiliz that are billions
of years ahead of ours and if you look

2892
01:00:59,270 --> 01:00:59,280
of years ahead of ours and if you look
 

2893
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,150
of years ahead of ours and if you look
at the exponential growth of

2894
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:01,160
at the exponential growth of

Technology among Homo sapiens in the
 

2897
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:05,029
Technology among Homo sapiens in the
last couple 100 years and you just

2898
01:01:05,029 --> 01:01:05,039
last couple 100 years and you just
 

2899
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:06,870
last couple 100 years and you just
project that forward I mean there's no

2900
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:06,880
project that forward I mean there's no
 

2901
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,670
project that forward I mean there's no
telling what they could have achieved

2902
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:08,680
telling what they could have achieved
 

2903
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:11,789
telling what they could have achieved
even in 1,000 or 10,000 years let alone

2904
01:01:11,789 --> 01:01:11,799
even in 1,000 or 10,000 years let alone
 

2905
01:01:11,799 --> 01:01:14,150
even in 1,000 or 10,000 years let alone
a million or 10 million or a billion

2906
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:14,160
a million or 10 million or a billion
 

2907
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:17,829
a million or 10 million or a billion
years and if they reach this capability

2908
01:01:17,829 --> 01:01:17,839
years and if they reach this capability
 

2909
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:20,510
years and if they reach this capability
of interstellar travel and colonization

2910
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:20,520
of interstellar travel and colonization
 

2911
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:22,910
of interstellar travel and colonization
then you can show that within 10 million

2912
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:22,920
then you can show that within 10 million
 

2913
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:25,069
then you can show that within 10 million
years or certainly a 100 million years

2914
01:01:25,069 --> 01:01:25,079
years or certainly a 100 million years
 

2915
01:01:25,079 --> 01:01:27,549
years or certainly a 100 million years
you can populate the whole galaxy all

2916
01:01:27,549 --> 01:01:27,559
you can populate the whole galaxy all
 

2917
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:29,190
you can populate the whole galaxy all
right and they you know so then you

2918
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:29,200
right and they you know so then you
 

2919
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,109
right and they you know so then you
don't have to have tried to detect them

2920
01:01:32,109 --> 01:01:32,119
don't have to have tried to detect them
 

2921
01:01:32,119 --> 01:01:33,789
don't have to have tried to detect them
Beyond 100 or a thousand Lighty years

2922
01:01:33,789 --> 01:01:33,799
Beyond 100 or a thousand Lighty years
 

2923
01:01:33,799 --> 01:01:36,470
Beyond 100 or a thousand Lighty years
they would already be here do you think

2924
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:36,480
they would already be here do you think
 

2925
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,670
they would already be here do you think
as a thought experiment do you think it

2926
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:38,680
as a thought experiment do you think it
 

2927
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:42,190
as a thought experiment do you think it
it's possible that they are already here

2928
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:42,200
it's possible that they are already here
 

2929
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:45,349
it's possible that they are already here
but we humans are so human Centric that

2930
01:01:45,349 --> 01:01:45,359
but we humans are so human Centric that
 

2931
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:47,549
but we humans are so human Centric that
we're just not like our conception of

2932
01:01:47,549 --> 01:01:47,559
we're just not like our conception of
 

2933
01:01:47,559 --> 01:01:50,710
we're just not like our conception of
what intelligent life looks like yeah is

2934
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:50,720
what intelligent life looks like yeah is
 

2935
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,630
what intelligent life looks like yeah is
is um we don't want to acknowledge it

2936
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:53,640
is um we don't want to acknowledge it
 

2937
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,390
is um we don't want to acknowledge it
like what what if trees right right

2938
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:56,400
like what what if trees right right
 

2939
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,309
like what what if trees right right
right like okay I guess the in a form of

2940
01:01:59,309 --> 01:01:59,319
right like okay I guess the in a form of
 

2941
01:01:59,319 --> 01:02:01,109
right like okay I guess the in a form of
a question do you think we'll actually

2942
01:02:01,109 --> 01:02:01,119
a question do you think we'll actually
 

2943
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:03,950
a question do you think we'll actually
detect intelligent life if it came to

2944
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:03,960
detect intelligent life if it came to
 

2945
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,870
detect intelligent life if it came to
visit us yeah I mean it's like you know

2946
01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:05,880
visit us yeah I mean it's like you know
 

2947
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,230
visit us yeah I mean it's like you know
you're an ant crawling around on a

2948
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:07,240
you're an ant crawling around on a
 

2949
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,109
you're an ant crawling around on a
sidewalk somewhere and do you notice the

2950
01:02:09,109 --> 01:02:09,119
sidewalk somewhere and do you notice the
 

2951
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:11,109
sidewalk somewhere and do you notice the
humans wandering around exactly and and

2952
01:02:11,109 --> 01:02:11,119
humans wandering around exactly and and
 

2953
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:12,870
humans wandering around exactly and and
the Empire State Building and you know

2954
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:12,880
the Empire State Building and you know
 

2955
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,990
the Empire State Building and you know
rocket ships flying to the moon and all

2956
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:15,000
rocket ships flying to the moon and all
 

2957
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,950
rocket ships flying to the moon and all
that kind of stuff right it's

2958
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:16,960
that kind of stuff right it's
 

2959
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,510
that kind of stuff right it's
conceivable that um we haven't detected

2960
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:19,520
conceivable that um we haven't detected
 

2961
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,269
conceivable that um we haven't detected
it and that we're so primitive compared

2962
01:02:21,269 --> 01:02:21,279
it and that we're so primitive compared
 

2963
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:22,910
it and that we're so primitive compared
to them that we're just not able to do

2964
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:22,920
to them that we're just not able to do
 

2965
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:26,029
to them that we're just not able to do
so like if you look at dark energy Maybe

2966
01:02:26,029 --> 01:02:26,039
so like if you look at dark energy Maybe
 

2967
01:02:26,039 --> 01:02:28,710
so like if you look at dark energy Maybe
we call it as a field it's just that my

2968
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:28,720
we call it as a field it's just that my
 

2969
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,670
we call it as a field it's just that my
own feeling is that in science now

2970
01:02:30,670 --> 01:02:30,680
own feeling is that in science now
 

2971
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,589
own feeling is that in science now
through observations and

2972
01:02:32,589 --> 01:02:32,599
through observations and
 

2973
01:02:32,599 --> 01:02:34,950
through observations and
experiments we've measured so many

2974
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:34,960
experiments we've measured so many
 

2975
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,029
experiments we've measured so many
things

2976
01:02:36,029 --> 01:02:36,039
things
 

2977
01:02:36,039 --> 01:02:39,630
things
and basically we understand a lot of

2978
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:39,640
and basically we understand a lot of
 

2979
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:41,710
and basically we understand a lot of
stuff okay fabric of reality yeah the

2980
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:41,720
stuff okay fabric of reality yeah the
 

2981
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:43,309
stuff okay fabric of reality yeah the
fabric of reality we understand quite

2982
01:02:43,309 --> 01:02:43,319
fabric of reality we understand quite
 

2983
01:02:43,319 --> 01:02:44,510
fabric of reality we understand quite
well and there are a few little things

2984
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:44,520
well and there are a few little things
 

2985
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,430
well and there are a few little things
like dark matter and dark energy that

2986
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:46,440
like dark matter and dark energy that
 

2987
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,150
like dark matter and dark energy that
may be some sign of some super

2988
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:48,160
may be some sign of some super
 

2989
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,510
may be some sign of some super
intelligence but I doubt it okay you

2990
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:50,520
intelligence but I doubt it okay you
 

2991
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:51,950
intelligence but I doubt it okay you
know why would some super intelligence

2992
01:02:51,950 --> 01:02:51,960
know why would some super intelligence
 

2993
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:54,430
know why would some super intelligence
be holding clusters of galaxies together

2994
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:54,440
be holding clusters of galaxies together
 

2995
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,470
be holding clusters of galaxies together
why would they be responsible for

2996
01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:56,480
why would they be responsible for
 

2997
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,789
why would they be responsible for
accelerating the expansion of the

2998
01:02:57,789 --> 01:02:57,799
accelerating the expansion of the
 

2999
01:02:57,799 --> 01:03:00,589
accelerating the expansion of the
universe so the point is is that through

3000
01:03:00,589 --> 01:03:00,599
universe so the point is is that through
 

3001
01:03:00,599 --> 01:03:02,829
universe so the point is is that through
science and applied science and

3002
01:03:02,829 --> 01:03:02,839
science and applied science and
 

3003
01:03:02,839 --> 01:03:06,069
science and applied science and
engineering we understand so much now

3004
01:03:06,069 --> 01:03:06,079
engineering we understand so much now
 

3005
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:07,990
engineering we understand so much now
that I'm not saying we know everything

3006
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:08,000
that I'm not saying we know everything
 

3007
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,470
that I'm not saying we know everything
but but we know a hell of a lot okay and

3008
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:10,480
but but we know a hell of a lot okay and
 

3009
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,029
but but we know a hell of a lot okay and
so there's it's not like there are lots

3010
01:03:13,029 --> 01:03:13,039
so there's it's not like there are lots
 

3011
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,750
so there's it's not like there are lots
of mysteries flying around there that

3012
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:14,760
of mysteries flying around there that
 

3013
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:20,950
of mysteries flying around there that
are completely outside our level of um

3014
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:20,960
are completely outside our level of um
 

3015
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:24,829
are completely outside our level of um
of of exploration or understanding yeah

3016
01:03:24,829 --> 01:03:24,839
of of exploration or understanding yeah
 

3017
01:03:24,839 --> 01:03:29,069
of of exploration or understanding yeah
from a I would say from from uh the

3018
01:03:29,069 --> 01:03:29,079
from a I would say from from uh the
 

3019
01:03:29,079 --> 01:03:31,549
from a I would say from from uh the
mystery perspective it seems like the

3020
01:03:31,549 --> 01:03:31,559
mystery perspective it seems like the
 

3021
01:03:31,559 --> 01:03:33,750
mystery perspective it seems like the
mystery of our own like cognition and

3022
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:33,760
mystery of our own like cognition and
 

3023
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:37,069
mystery of our own like cognition and
Consciousness is much grander than like

3024
01:03:37,069 --> 01:03:37,079
Consciousness is much grander than like
 

3025
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:38,789
Consciousness is much grander than like
the degrees of freedom of possible

3026
01:03:38,789 --> 01:03:38,799
the degrees of freedom of possible
 

3027
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:40,190
the degrees of freedom of possible
explanations for what the heck is going

3028
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:40,200
explanations for what the heck is going
 

3029
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,710
explanations for what the heck is going
on is much greater there than in the in

3030
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:42,720
on is much greater there than in the in
 

3031
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:45,150
on is much greater there than in the in
the physics of the absor how the brain

3032
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:45,160
the physics of the absor how the brain
 

3033
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:47,390
the physics of the absor how the brain
works how did life

3034
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:47,400
works how did life
 

3035
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:50,630
works how did life
arise yeah that's big big questions but

3036
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:50,640
arise yeah that's big big questions but
 

3037
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:53,870
arise yeah that's big big questions but
they to me don't indicate uh the

3038
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:53,880
they to me don't indicate uh the
 

3039
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,950
they to me don't indicate uh the
existence of of of an alien or something

3040
01:03:56,950 --> 01:03:56,960
existence of of of an alien or something
 

3041
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,670
existence of of of an alien or something
I mean unless we are the aliens you know

3042
01:03:58,670 --> 01:03:58,680
I mean unless we are the aliens you know
 

3043
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:00,349
I mean unless we are the aliens you know
we we could have been contamination from

3044
01:04:00,349 --> 01:04:00,359
we we could have been contamination from
 

3045
01:04:00,359 --> 01:04:02,990
we we could have been contamination from
some rocket ship that that hit here a

3046
01:04:02,990 --> 01:04:03,000
some rocket ship that that hit here a
 

3047
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,950
some rocket ship that that hit here a
long long time ago and all evidence of

3048
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:04,960
long long time ago and all evidence of
 

3049
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,950
long long time ago and all evidence of
it has been destroyed but again that

3050
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:06,960
it has been destroyed but again that
 

3051
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,549
it has been destroyed but again that
alien would have started out somewhere

3052
01:04:09,549 --> 01:04:09,559
alien would have started out somewhere
 

3053
01:04:09,559 --> 01:04:13,069
alien would have started out somewhere
they're not they're not here watching us

3054
01:04:13,069 --> 01:04:13,079
they're not they're not here watching us
 

3055
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:16,390
they're not they're not here watching us
right now right they're not among us and

3056
01:04:16,390 --> 01:04:16,400
right now right they're not among us and
 

3057
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,950
right now right they're not among us and
so though there are exp potential

3058
01:04:19,950 --> 01:04:19,960
so though there are exp potential
 

3059
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:22,029
so though there are exp potential
explanations for the fmy Paradox and one

3060
01:04:22,029 --> 01:04:22,039
explanations for the fmy Paradox and one
 

3061
01:04:22,039 --> 01:04:24,190
explanations for the fmy Paradox and one
of them that I kind of like is that the

3062
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:24,200
of them that I kind of like is that the
 

3063
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,349
of them that I kind of like is that the
truly intelligent creature

3064
01:04:26,349 --> 01:04:26,359
truly intelligent creature
 

3065
01:04:26,359 --> 01:04:29,150
truly intelligent creature
are those that decided not to colonize

3066
01:04:29,150 --> 01:04:29,160
are those that decided not to colonize
 

3067
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:30,990
are those that decided not to colonize
the whole galaxy cuz they'd quickly run

3068
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:31,000
the whole galaxy cuz they'd quickly run
 

3069
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,390
the whole galaxy cuz they'd quickly run
out of room there CU it's exponential

3070
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:33,400
out of room there CU it's exponential
 

3071
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,630
out of room there CU it's exponential
right you send a probe to a planet it

3072
01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:35,640
right you send a probe to a planet it
 

3073
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:38,950
right you send a probe to a planet it
makes two copies they go out they make

3074
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:38,960
makes two copies they go out they make
 

3075
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,069
makes two copies they go out they make
two copies each and it's an exponential

3076
01:04:41,069 --> 01:04:41,079
two copies each and it's an exponential
 

3077
01:04:41,079 --> 01:04:42,630
two copies each and it's an exponential
right they quickly colonize the whole

3078
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:42,640
right they quickly colonize the whole
 

3079
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,029
right they quickly colonize the whole
galaxy but then the distance to the next

3080
01:04:45,029 --> 01:04:45,039
galaxy but then the distance to the next
 

3081
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:47,269
galaxy but then the distance to the next
galaxy the next big one like Andromeda

3082
01:04:47,269 --> 01:04:47,279
galaxy the next big one like Andromeda
 

3083
01:04:47,279 --> 01:04:49,069
galaxy the next big one like Andromeda
that's two and a half million light

3084
01:04:49,069 --> 01:04:49,079
that's two and a half million light
 

3085
01:04:49,079 --> 01:04:51,430
that's two and a half million light
years yeah that's a much grander scale

3086
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:51,440
years yeah that's a much grander scale
 

3087
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,950
years yeah that's a much grander scale
now right and so it it also could be

3088
01:04:53,950 --> 01:04:53,960
now right and so it it also could be
 

3089
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:57,510
now right and so it it also could be
that the reason they surv this long is

3090
01:04:57,510 --> 01:04:57,520
that the reason they surv this long is
 

3091
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,670
that the reason they surv this long is
that they got over this tendency that

3092
01:05:00,670 --> 01:05:00,680
that they got over this tendency that
 

3093
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:03,230
that they got over this tendency that
may well exist among sufficiently

3094
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:03,240
may well exist among sufficiently
 

3095
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,870
may well exist among sufficiently
intelligent creatures this tendency for

3096
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:05,880
intelligent creatures this tendency for
 

3097
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:09,430
intelligent creatures this tendency for
aggression and self-destruction right if

3098
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:09,440
aggression and self-destruction right if
 

3099
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,870
aggression and self-destruction right if
they bypass that and that may be one of

3100
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:11,880
they bypass that and that may be one of
 

3101
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:13,549
they bypass that and that may be one of
the great filters if there are more than

3102
01:05:13,549 --> 01:05:13,559
the great filters if there are more than
 

3103
01:05:13,559 --> 01:05:18,150
the great filters if there are more than
one right then they may not be a type of

3104
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:18,160
one right then they may not be a type of
 

3105
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,230
one right then they may not be a type of
creature that feels the need to go and

3106
01:05:21,230 --> 01:05:21,240
creature that feels the need to go and
 

3107
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:23,789
creature that feels the need to go and
say oh there's a nice looking planet um

3108
01:05:23,789 --> 01:05:23,799
say oh there's a nice looking planet um
 

3109
01:05:23,799 --> 01:05:25,870
say oh there's a nice looking planet um
and there's a bunch of you know ants on

3110
01:05:25,870 --> 01:05:25,880
and there's a bunch of you know ants on
 

3111
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,870
and there's a bunch of you know ants on
it let's go squish him and colonize it

3112
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:28,880
it let's go squish him and colonize it
 

3113
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,630
it let's go squish him and colonize it
no it could even be the kind of Star

3114
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:30,640
no it could even be the kind of Star
 

3115
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:33,029
no it could even be the kind of Star
Trek like prime directive where you go

3116
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:33,039
Trek like prime directive where you go
 

3117
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:35,069
Trek like prime directive where you go

3119
01:05:35,079 --> 01:05:39,549

01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:44,190
we call it exploration is beautiful and
everything but there is underlying this

3124
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:44,200
everything but there is underlying this
 

3125
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:47,190
everything but there is underlying this
desire to explore is a desire to

3126
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:47,200
desire to explore is a desire to
 

3127
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,309
desire to explore is a desire to
conquer yeah I I mean if we're just

3128
01:05:49,309 --> 01:05:49,319
conquer yeah I I mean if we're just
 

3129
01:05:49,319 --> 01:05:51,349
conquer yeah I I mean if we're just
being really honest about right now for

3130
01:05:51,349 --> 01:05:51,359
being really honest about right now for
 

3131
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:53,269
being really honest about right now for
us it is right and you're saying it's

3132
01:05:53,269 --> 01:05:53,279
us it is right and you're saying it's
 

3133
01:05:53,279 --> 01:05:55,349
us it is right and you're saying it's
possible to separate but I would venture

3134
01:05:55,349 --> 01:05:55,359
possible to separate but I would venture
 

3135
01:05:55,359 --> 01:05:56,549
possible to separate but I would venture
to say

3136
01:05:56,549 --> 01:05:56,559
to say
 

3137
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:00,269
to say
that you wouldn't that those are coupled

3138
01:06:00,269 --> 01:06:00,279
that you wouldn't that those are coupled
 

3139
01:06:00,279 --> 01:06:02,990
that you wouldn't that those are coupled
so I could I could imagine a

3140
01:06:02,990 --> 01:06:03,000
so I could I could imagine a
 

3141
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,829
so I could I could imagine a
civilization that lives on for billions

3142
01:06:04,829 --> 01:06:04,839
civilization that lives on for billions
 

3143
01:06:04,839 --> 01:06:07,750
civilization that lives on for billions
of years that just stays on its like

3144
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:07,760
of years that just stays on its like
 

3145
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,990
of years that just stays on its like
figures out the minimal effort way of

3146
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:11,000
figures out the minimal effort way of
 

3147
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,029
figures out the minimal effort way of
just peacefully existing it's like a

3148
01:06:13,029 --> 01:06:13,039
just peacefully existing it's like a
 

3149
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:15,510
just peacefully existing it's like a
monastery yeah and it limits itself yeah

3150
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:15,520
monastery yeah and it limits itself yeah
 

3151
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,230
monastery yeah and it limits itself yeah
it limits itself you know it's it's

3152
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:17,240
it limits itself you know it's it's
 

3153
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,430
it limits itself you know it's it's
planted its seeds in a number of places

3154
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:19,440
planted its seeds in a number of places
 

3155
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:22,430
planted its seeds in a number of places
so it's not vulnerable to a single point

3156
01:06:22,430 --> 01:06:22,440
so it's not vulnerable to a single point
 

3157
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,950
so it's not vulnerable to a single point

thrashing them to bits so they've got

3168
01:06:35,589 --> 01:06:35,599
thrashing them to bits so they've got
 

3169
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:37,230
thrashing them to bits so they've got
their seeds in a bunch of places but

3170
01:06:37,230 --> 01:06:37,240
their seeds in a bunch of places but
 

3171
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:40,549
their seeds in a bunch of places but
they chose not to colon colonize the

01:06:40,549 --> 01:06:40,559
they chose not to colon colonize the
 

3173
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:43,150
they chose not to colon colonize the

primitive organism Homo sapiens right um

3178
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:50,960
primitive organism Homo sapiens right um
 

3179
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:55,710
primitive organism Homo sapiens right um
or or they uh this is like a they enjoy

3180
01:06:55,710 --> 01:06:55,720
or or they uh this is like a they enjoy
 

3181
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:58,589
or or they uh this is like a they enjoy
this like a TV show for them yeah could

3182
01:06:58,589 --> 01:06:58,599
this like a TV show for them yeah could
 

3183
01:06:58,599 --> 01:07:01,829
this like a TV show for them yeah could
a TV show right so they just tuned in

3184
01:07:01,829 --> 01:07:01,839
a TV show right so they just tuned in
 

3185
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:04,109
a TV show right so they just tuned in
right so those are possible explanations

3186
01:07:04,109 --> 01:07:04,119
right so those are possible explanations
 

3187
01:07:04,119 --> 01:07:07,589
right so those are possible explanations
yet I I think that to me the most likely

3188
01:07:07,589 --> 01:07:07,599
yet I I think that to me the most likely
 

3189
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:10,230
yet I I think that to me the most likely
explanation for the FME Paradox is that

3190
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:10,240
explanation for the FME Paradox is that
 

3191
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:12,630
explanation for the FME Paradox is that
they really are very very rare and you

3192
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:12,640
they really are very very rare and you
 

3193
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,990
they really are very very rare and you
know Carl Sean estimated a 100,000 of

3194
01:07:14,990 --> 01:07:15,000
know Carl Sean estimated a 100,000 of
 

3195
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,510
know Carl Sean estimated a 100,000 of
them if there's that many some of them

3196
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:17,520
them if there's that many some of them
 

3197
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,549
them if there's that many some of them
would have been way ahead of us and and

3198
01:07:19,549 --> 01:07:19,559
would have been way ahead of us and and
 

3199
01:07:19,559 --> 01:07:21,990
would have been way ahead of us and and
I think we would have seen them by now

3200
01:07:21,990 --> 01:07:22,000
I think we would have seen them by now
 

3201
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,029
I think we would have seen them by now
if there were a handful maybe they're

3202
01:07:24,029 --> 01:07:24,039
if there were a handful maybe they're
 

3203
01:07:24,039 --> 01:07:26,069
if there were a handful maybe they're
there but at that point you're right on

3204
01:07:26,069 --> 01:07:26,079
there but at that point you're right on
 

3205
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,950
there but at that point you're right on
this dividing line between being a

3206
01:07:27,950 --> 01:07:27,960
this dividing line between being a
 

3207
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,269
this dividing line between being a
pessimist and an optimist yeah and and

3208
01:07:30,269 --> 01:07:30,279
pessimist and an optimist yeah and and
 

3209
01:07:30,279 --> 01:07:32,150
pessimist and an optimist yeah and and
what are the odds for that right if you

3210
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:32,160
what are the odds for that right if you
 

3211
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,990
what are the odds for that right if you
look at all the things that had to go

3212
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:34,000
look at all the things that had to go
 

3213
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,630
look at all the things that had to go
right for us yeah and the then you know

3214
01:07:36,630 --> 01:07:36,640
right for us yeah and the then you know
 

3215
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:37,750
right for us yeah and the then you know
getting back to something you said

3216
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:37,760
getting back to something you said
 

3217
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,750
getting back to something you said
earlier let's discuss you know primitive

3218
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:39,760
earlier let's discuss you know primitive
 

3219
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,349
earlier let's discuss you know primitive
life yeah that could be the thing that's

3220
01:07:43,349 --> 01:07:43,359
life yeah that could be the thing that's
 

3221
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:45,150
life yeah that could be the thing that's
difficult to achieve just getting the

3222
01:07:45,150 --> 01:07:45,160
difficult to achieve just getting the
 

3223
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,829
difficult to achieve just getting the
random molecules together to a point

3224
01:07:47,829 --> 01:07:47,839
random molecules together to a point
 

3225
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:50,430
random molecules together to a point
where they start self-replicating and

3226
01:07:50,430 --> 01:07:50,440
where they start self-replicating and
 

3227
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,589
where they start self-replicating and
evolving and becoming better and all

3228
01:07:52,589 --> 01:07:52,599
evolving and becoming better and all
 

3229
01:07:52,599 --> 01:07:55,069
evolving and becoming better and all
that that that's an inordinately

3230
01:07:55,069 --> 01:07:55,079
that that that's an inordinately
 

3231
01:07:55,079 --> 01:07:57,269
that that that's an inordinately
difficult thing I think though I'm not

3232
01:07:57,269 --> 01:07:57,279
difficult thing I think though I'm not
 

3233
01:07:57,279 --> 01:07:59,269
difficult thing I think though I'm not
you know some molecular cell biologist

3234
01:07:59,269 --> 01:07:59,279
you know some molecular cell biologist
 

3235
01:07:59,279 --> 01:08:01,470
you know some molecular cell biologist
but just it's it's it's the usual

3236
01:08:01,470 --> 01:08:01,480
but just it's it's it's the usual
 

3237
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:02,630
but just it's it's it's the usual
argument you know you're wandering

3238
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:02,640
argument you know you're wandering
 

3239
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,470
argument you know you're wandering
around in the Sahara Desert and you

3240
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:04,480
around in the Sahara Desert and you
 

3241
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:08,349
around in the Sahara Desert and you
stumble across a watch is your is your

3242
01:08:08,349 --> 01:08:08,359
stumble across a watch is your is your
 

3243
01:08:08,359 --> 01:08:11,190
stumble across a watch is your is your
initial response oh you know a bunch of

3244
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:11,200
initial response oh you know a bunch of
 

3245
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,349
initial response oh you know a bunch of
sand grains just came together randomly

3246
01:08:13,349 --> 01:08:13,359
sand grains just came together randomly
 

3247
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:15,589
sand grains just came together randomly
and formed this watch no you you think

3248
01:08:15,589 --> 01:08:15,599
and formed this watch no you you think
 

3249
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:18,349
and formed this watch no you you think
that something formed it or it came from

3250
01:08:18,349 --> 01:08:18,359
that something formed it or it came from
 

3251
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:22,070
that something formed it or it came from
some simpler structure that then became

3252
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:22,080
some simpler structure that then became
 

3253
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,309
some simpler structure that then became
you know more complex all right it

3254
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:24,319
you know more complex all right it
 

3255
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:27,990
you know more complex all right it
didn't just form well even the simplest

3256
01:08:27,990 --> 01:08:28,000
didn't just form well even the simplest
 

3257
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,870
didn't just form well even the simplest
life is is a very very complex structure

3258
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:31,880
life is is a very very complex structure
 

3259
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:34,309
life is is a very very complex structure
even the even the simplest procaryotic

3260
01:08:34,309 --> 01:08:34,319
even the even the simplest procaryotic
 

3261
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:36,430
even the even the simplest procaryotic
cells not to mention eukaryotic cells

3262
01:08:36,430 --> 01:08:36,440
cells not to mention eukaryotic cells
 

3263
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:38,550
cells not to mention eukaryotic cells
although that transition may have been

3264
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:38,560
although that transition may have been
 

3265
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,349
although that transition may have been
this so-called great filter as well

3266
01:08:40,349 --> 01:08:40,359
this so-called great filter as well
 

3267
01:08:40,359 --> 01:08:43,030
this so-called great filter as well
maybe the cells without a nucleus are

3268
01:08:43,030 --> 01:08:43,040
maybe the cells without a nucleus are
 

3269
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,990
maybe the cells without a nucleus are
relatively easy to form and then the big

3270
01:08:45,990 --> 01:08:46,000
relatively easy to form and then the big
 

3271
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,430
relatively easy to form and then the big
next step is where you have a nucleus

3272
01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:48,440
next step is where you have a nucleus
 

3273
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:50,229
next step is where you have a nucleus
which then provides a lot of energy

3274
01:08:50,229 --> 01:08:50,239
which then provides a lot of energy
 

3275
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:52,070
which then provides a lot of energy
which allows the cell to become much

3276
01:08:52,070 --> 01:08:52,080
which allows the cell to become much
 

3277
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:54,229
which allows the cell to become much
much more complex and so on

3278
01:08:54,229 --> 01:08:54,239
much more complex and so on
 

3279
01:08:54,239 --> 01:08:57,349
much more complex and so on
interestingly going from eukaryotic

3280
01:08:57,349 --> 01:08:57,359
interestingly going from eukaryotic
 

3281
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:00,390
interestingly going from eukaryotic
cells single cells to multicellular

3282
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:00,400
cells single cells to multicellular
 

3283
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,990
cells single cells to multicellular
organisms does not appear to be at least

3284
01:09:02,990 --> 01:09:03,000
organisms does not appear to be at least
 

3285
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,590
organisms does not appear to be at least
on Earth one of these great filters

3286
01:09:04,590 --> 01:09:04,600
on Earth one of these great filters
 

3287
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,030
on Earth one of these great filters
because there's evidence that it

3288
01:09:06,030 --> 01:09:06,040
because there's evidence that it
 

3289
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:08,070
because there's evidence that it
happened dozens of times independently

3290
01:09:08,070 --> 01:09:08,080
happened dozens of times independently
 

3291
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:11,990
happened dozens of times independently
on Earth so by by a really great filter

3292
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:12,000
on Earth so by by a really great filter
 

3293
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,829
on Earth so by by a really great filter
something that happens very very rarely

3294
01:09:13,829 --> 01:09:13,839
something that happens very very rarely
 

3295
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:16,870
something that happens very very rarely
I mean that we had to get

3296
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:16,880
I mean that we had to get
 

3297
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:22,149
I mean that we had to get
through um an obstacle that is just

3298
01:09:22,149 --> 01:09:22,159
through um an obstacle that is just
 

3299
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:25,749
through um an obstacle that is just
incredibly rare to get through and one

3300
01:09:25,749 --> 01:09:25,759
incredibly rare to get through and one
 

3301
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:27,550
incredibly rare to get through and one
of the really exciting scientific things

3302
01:09:27,550 --> 01:09:27,560
of the really exciting scientific things
 

3303
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:29,749
of the really exciting scientific things
is that that particular

3304
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:29,759
is that that particular
 

3305
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:32,669
is that that particular
Point U is something that we might be

3306
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:32,679
Point U is something that we might be
 

3307
01:09:32,679 --> 01:09:35,309
Point U is something that we might be
able to discover Even in our lifetimes

3308
01:09:35,309 --> 01:09:35,319
able to discover Even in our lifetimes
 

3309
01:09:35,319 --> 01:09:38,349
able to discover Even in our lifetimes
that find life elsewhere like Europa or

3310
01:09:38,349 --> 01:09:38,359
that find life elsewhere like Europa or
 

3311
01:09:38,359 --> 01:09:40,349
that find life elsewhere like Europa or
yeah be able to see that would be bad

3312
01:09:40,349 --> 01:09:40,359
yeah be able to see that would be bad
 

3313
01:09:40,359 --> 01:09:44,229
yeah be able to see that would be bad
news right because if we find lots of

3314
01:09:44,229 --> 01:09:44,239
news right because if we find lots of
 

3315
01:09:44,239 --> 01:09:47,950
news right because if we find lots of
pretty Advanced life yeah that would

3316
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:47,960
pretty Advanced life yeah that would
 

3317
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:50,149
pretty Advanced life yeah that would
suggest and and especially if we found

3318
01:09:50,149 --> 01:09:50,159
suggest and and especially if we found
 

3319
01:09:50,159 --> 01:09:51,470
suggest and and especially if we found
some you know defunct you know

3320
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:51,480
some you know defunct you know
 

3321
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:53,229
some you know defunct you know
fossilized civilization or something

3322
01:09:53,229 --> 01:09:53,239
fossilized civilization or something
 

3323
01:09:53,239 --> 01:09:56,229
fossilized civilization or something
somewhere else that would be you mean of

3324
01:09:56,229 --> 01:09:56,239
somewhere else that would be you mean of
 

3325
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:58,990
somewhere else that would be you mean of
like what's that defunct civilization of

3326
01:09:58,990 --> 01:09:59,000
like what's that defunct civilization of
 

3327
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,310
like what's that defunct civilization of
like I'm sorry I switched gear there if

3328
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:01,320
like I'm sorry I switched gear there if
 

3329
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:03,110
like I'm sorry I switched gear there if
we if we found some intelligent or

3330
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:03,120
we if we found some intelligent or
 

3331
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,910
we if we found some intelligent or
rather you know even even trilobites

3332
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:04,920
rather you know even even trilobites
 

3333
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:06,790
rather you know even even trilobites
right and stuff you know elsewhere that

3334
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:06,800
right and stuff you know elsewhere that
 

3335
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,270
right and stuff you know elsewhere that
would be bad news for us because that

3336
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:08,280
would be bad news for us because that
 

3337
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:09,630
would be bad news for us because that
would mean that the great filter is

3338
01:10:09,630 --> 01:10:09,640
would mean that the great filter is
 

3339
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:12,149
would mean that the great filter is
ahead of us you know right because it

3340
01:10:12,149 --> 01:10:12,159
ahead of us you know right because it
 

3341
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:15,470
ahead of us you know right because it
would mean that lots of lots of things

3342
01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:15,480
would mean that lots of lots of things
 

3343
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:17,990
would mean that lots of lots of things
have gotten roughly to our level yeah

3344
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:18,000
have gotten roughly to our level yeah
 

3345
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,830
have gotten roughly to our level yeah
but but given the fmy Paradox if you

3346
01:10:20,830 --> 01:10:20,840
but but given the fmy Paradox if you
 

3347
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:23,189
but but given the fmy Paradox if you
accept that the fmy Paradox means that

3348
01:10:23,189 --> 01:10:23,199
accept that the fmy Paradox means that
 

3349
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:24,830
accept that the fmy Paradox means that
there's no one else out there you don't

3350
01:10:24,830 --> 01:10:24,840
there's no one else out there you don't
 

3351
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:26,709
there's no one else out there you don't
necessarily have to accept that but if

3352
01:10:26,709 --> 01:10:26,719
necessarily have to accept that but if
 

3353
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:28,669
necessarily have to accept that but if
you accept that it means that no one

3354
01:10:28,669 --> 01:10:28,679
you accept that it means that no one
 

3355
01:10:28,679 --> 01:10:30,830
you accept that it means that no one
else is out there and yet there are lots

3356
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:30,840
else is out there and yet there are lots
 

3357
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,750
else is out there and yet there are lots
of things we found that are at or

3358
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:32,760
of things we found that are at or
 

3359
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:35,270
of things we found that are at or
roughly at our level that means that the

3360
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:35,280
roughly at our level that means that the
 

3361
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:36,950
roughly at our level that means that the
great filter is ahead of us and that

3362
01:10:36,950 --> 01:10:36,960
great filter is ahead of us and that
 

3363
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:40,750
great filter is ahead of us and that
bodess poorly for our long-term future

3364
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:40,760
bodess poorly for our long-term future
 

3365
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:43,910
bodess poorly for our long-term future
you know it's funny you said uh you

3366
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:43,920
you know it's funny you said uh you
 

3367
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:46,550
you know it's funny you said uh you
started by saying you're a little bit on

3368
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:46,560
started by saying you're a little bit on
 

3369
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:50,070
started by saying you're a little bit on
the pessimistic side but it's funny

3370
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:50,080
the pessimistic side but it's funny
 

3371
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,390
the pessimistic side but it's funny
because we're doing this kind of dance

3372
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:51,400
because we're doing this kind of dance
 

3373
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:53,070
because we're doing this kind of dance
between pessimism and optimism because

3374
01:10:53,070 --> 01:10:53,080
between pessimism and optimism because
 

3375
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:56,110
between pessimism and optimism because
I'm not sure if us being alone in the

3376
01:10:56,110 --> 01:10:56,120
I'm not sure if us being alone in the
 

3377
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:57,950
I'm not sure if us being alone in the
observable universe as intelligent

3378
01:10:57,950 --> 01:10:57,960
observable universe as intelligent
 

3379
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:59,070
observable universe as intelligent
beings is

3380
01:10:59,070 --> 01:10:59,080
beings is
 

3381
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:01,110
beings is
pessimistic well it's good news in a

3382
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:01,120
pessimistic well it's good news in a
 

3383
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:04,550
pessimistic well it's good news in a
sense for us because means that we made

3384
01:11:04,550 --> 01:11:04,560
sense for us because means that we made
 

3385
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:07,950
sense for us because means that we made
it through oh right see if we're the

3386
01:11:07,950 --> 01:11:07,960
it through oh right see if we're the
 

3387
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:10,510
it through oh right see if we're the
only ones and there are such great

3388
01:11:10,510 --> 01:11:10,520
only ones and there are such great
 

3389
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:13,189
only ones and there are such great
filters maybe more than one formation of

3390
01:11:13,189 --> 01:11:13,199
filters maybe more than one formation of
 

3391
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:15,669
filters maybe more than one formation of
life might be one of them formation of

3392
01:11:15,669 --> 01:11:15,679
life might be one of them formation of
 

3393
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:17,709
life might be one of them formation of
eukaryotic that is with the nucleus

3394
01:11:17,709 --> 01:11:17,719
eukaryotic that is with the nucleus
 

3395
01:11:17,719 --> 01:11:20,550
eukaryotic that is with the nucleus
cells be another development of

3396
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:20,560
cells be another development of
 

3397
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,750
cells be another development of
humanlike intelligence might be another

3398
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:22,760
humanlike intelligence might be another
 

3399
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:24,270
humanlike intelligence might be another
right there might be several such

3400
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:24,280
right there might be several such
 

3401
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:27,950
right there might be several such
filters and we were the lucky ones and

3402
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:27,960
filters and we were the lucky ones and
 

3403
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,390
filters and we were the lucky ones and
you know then people say well then that

3404
01:11:29,390 --> 01:11:29,400
you know then people say well then that
 

3405
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:30,990
you know then people say well then that
means you're putting yourself into a

3406
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:31,000
means you're putting yourself into a
 

3407
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,030
means you're putting yourself into a
special perspective and every time we've

3408
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:33,040
special perspective and every time we've
 

3409
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:35,110
special perspective and every time we've
done that we've been wrong and yeah yeah

3410
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:35,120
done that we've been wrong and yeah yeah
 

3411
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,550
done that we've been wrong and yeah yeah
I know all those arguments but it still

3412
01:11:37,550 --> 01:11:37,560
I know all those arguments but it still
 

3413
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:40,310
I know all those arguments but it still
could be the case that there's one of us

3414
01:11:40,310 --> 01:11:40,320
could be the case that there's one of us
 

3415
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,629
could be the case that there's one of us
at least per Galaxy or per 10 or 100 or

3416
01:11:42,629 --> 01:11:42,639
at least per Galaxy or per 10 or 100 or
 

3417
01:11:42,639 --> 01:11:45,790
at least per Galaxy or per 10 or 100 or
a thousand galaxies and we're sitting

3418
01:11:45,790 --> 01:11:45,800
a thousand galaxies and we're sitting
 

3419
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:48,510
a thousand galaxies and we're sitting
here having this conversation because we

3420
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:48,520
here having this conversation because we
 

3421
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:50,189
here having this conversation because we
exist and so there's a there's an

3422
01:11:50,189 --> 01:11:50,199
exist and so there's a there's an
 

3423
01:11:50,199 --> 01:11:52,110
exist and so there's a there's an
observational selection effect there

3424
01:11:52,110 --> 01:11:52,120
observational selection effect there
 

3425
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:54,270
observational selection effect there
right just because we're special doesn't

3426
01:11:54,270 --> 01:11:54,280
right just because we're special doesn't
 

3427
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:55,790
right just because we're special doesn't
mean that we shouldn't have these

3428
01:11:55,790 --> 01:11:55,800
mean that we shouldn't have these
 

3429
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:58,310
mean that we shouldn't have these
conversations about whether or not we're

3430
01:11:58,310 --> 01:11:58,320
conversations about whether or not we're
 

3431
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,470
conversations about whether or not we're
special

3432
01:11:59,470 --> 01:11:59,480
special
 

3433
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:01,950
special
right yeah so that's that's exciting

3434
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:01,960
right yeah so that's that's exciting
 

3435
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:04,430
right yeah so that's that's exciting
that's optimistic so that's the that's

3436
01:12:04,430 --> 01:12:04,440
that's optimistic so that's the that's
 

3437
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:06,790
that's optimistic so that's the that's
the optimistic part that if we don't

3438
01:12:06,790 --> 01:12:06,800
the optimistic part that if we don't
 

3439
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,950
the optimistic part that if we don't
find other intelligent life there it

3440
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:08,960
find other intelligent life there it
 

3441
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:11,629
find other intelligent life there it
might mean that we're the ones that made

3442
01:12:11,629 --> 01:12:11,639
might mean that we're the ones that made
 

3443
01:12:11,639 --> 01:12:14,510
might mean that we're the ones that made
it uh and and in general outside the

3444
01:12:14,510 --> 01:12:14,520
it uh and and in general outside the
 

3445
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:17,229
it uh and and in general outside the
great filter and so on you know it's not

3446
01:12:17,229 --> 01:12:17,239
great filter and so on you know it's not
 

3447
01:12:17,239 --> 01:12:20,110
great filter and so on you know it's not
obvious that uh the Stephen Hawkin thing

3448
01:12:20,110 --> 01:12:20,120
obvious that uh the Stephen Hawkin thing
 

3449
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:22,149
obvious that uh the Stephen Hawkin thing
which is it's not obvious that life out

3450
01:12:22,149 --> 01:12:22,159
which is it's not obvious that life out
 

3451
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:25,430
which is it's not obvious that life out
there is is going to be kind to us

3452
01:12:25,430 --> 01:12:25,440
there is is going to be kind to us
 

3453
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:28,750
there is is going to be kind to us
oh yeah so you know I knew Hawking and I

3454
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:28,760
oh yeah so you know I knew Hawking and I
 

3455
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:31,229
oh yeah so you know I knew Hawking and I
greatly respect his his scientific work

3456
01:12:31,229 --> 01:12:31,239
greatly respect his his scientific work
 

3457
01:12:31,239 --> 01:12:34,870
greatly respect his his scientific work
and in particular the early work on the

3458
01:12:34,870 --> 01:12:34,880
and in particular the early work on the
 

3459
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,629
and in particular the early work on the
unification of general theory of

3460
01:12:36,629 --> 01:12:36,639
unification of general theory of
 

3461
01:12:36,639 --> 01:12:38,550
unification of general theory of
relativity and quantum physics to two

3462
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:38,560
relativity and quantum physics to two
 

3463
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:40,310
relativity and quantum physics to two
great pillars of modern physics you know

3464
01:12:40,310 --> 01:12:40,320
great pillars of modern physics you know
 

3465
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,229
great pillars of modern physics you know
Hawking radiation and all that fantastic

3466
01:12:42,229 --> 01:12:42,239
Hawking radiation and all that fantastic
 

3467
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,750
Hawking radiation and all that fantastic
work you know if he were alive he should

3468
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:44,760
work you know if he were alive he should
 

3469
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,590
work you know if he were alive he should
have been a recipient of this year's

3470
01:12:46,590 --> 01:12:46,600
have been a recipient of this year's
 

3471
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:48,470
have been a recipient of this year's
physics Nobel Prize which was for the

3472
01:12:48,470 --> 01:12:48,480
physics Nobel Prize which was for the
 

3473
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:51,510
physics Nobel Prize which was for the
discovery of black holes and also uh by

3474
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:51,520
discovery of black holes and also uh by
 

3475
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,669
discovery of black holes and also uh by
Roger Penrose for the theoretical work

3476
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:53,679
Roger Penrose for the theoretical work
 

3477
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:55,629

showing that given

3478
01:12:55,629 --> 01:12:55,639
showing that given
 

3479
01:12:55,639 --> 01:12:58,430
showing that given
a star that's massive enough you you

3480
01:12:58,430 --> 01:12:58,440
a star that's massive enough you you
 

3481
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,390
a star that's massive enough you you
basically can't avoid having a black

3482
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:00,400
basically can't avoid having a black
 

3483
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:03,709
basically can't avoid having a black
hole anyway Hawking fantastic I I tip my

3484
01:13:03,709 --> 01:13:03,719
hole anyway Hawking fantastic I I tip my
 

3485
01:13:03,719 --> 01:13:05,550
hole anyway Hawking fantastic I I tip my
hat to him may he rest in peace that

3486
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:05,560
hat to him may he rest in peace that
 

3487
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:07,709
hat to him may he rest in peace that
would have been a heck of a Nobel Prize

3488
01:13:07,709 --> 01:13:07,719
would have been a heck of a Nobel Prize
 

3489
01:13:07,719 --> 01:13:10,790
would have been a heck of a Nobel Prize
black holes heck of a good group but but

3490
01:13:10,790 --> 01:13:10,800
black holes heck of a good group but but
 

3491
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,430
black holes heck of a good group but but
but going back to what he said that we

3492
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:12,440
but going back to what he said that we
 

3493
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:14,470
but going back to what he said that we
shouldn't be um broadcasting our

3494
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:14,480
shouldn't be um broadcasting our
 

3495
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:17,149
shouldn't be um broadcasting our
presence to others there I actually

3496
01:13:17,149 --> 01:13:17,159
presence to others there I actually
 

3497
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:19,550
presence to others there I actually
disagree with him respectfully

3498
01:13:19,550 --> 01:13:19,560
disagree with him respectfully
 

3499
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,390
disagree with him respectfully
because first of all we've been

3500
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:21,400
because first of all we've been
 

3501
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:23,030
because first of all we've been
unintentionally broadcasting our

3502
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:23,040
unintentionally broadcasting our
 

3503
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:24,830
unintentionally broadcasting our
presence for a 100 years since the

3504
01:13:24,830 --> 01:13:24,840
presence for a 100 years since the
 

3505
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:27,790
presence for a 100 years since the
develop velopment of radio and TV okay

3506
01:13:27,790 --> 01:13:27,800
develop velopment of radio and TV okay
 

3507
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:31,270
develop velopment of radio and TV okay
um secondly any alien that has the

3508
01:13:31,270 --> 01:13:31,280
um secondly any alien that has the
 

3509
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,709
um secondly any alien that has the
capability of coming here and squashing

3510
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:33,719
capability of coming here and squashing
 

3511
01:13:33,719 --> 01:13:37,110
capability of coming here and squashing
us uh either already knows about us and

3512
01:13:37,110 --> 01:13:37,120
us uh either already knows about us and
 

3513
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:38,830
us uh either already knows about us and
you know doesn't care because we're just

3514
01:13:38,830 --> 01:13:38,840
you know doesn't care because we're just
 

3515
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:40,950
you know doesn't care because we're just
like little ants and when they're ants

3516
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:40,960
like little ants and when they're ants
 

3517
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:42,870
like little ants and when they're ants
in your kitchen you tend to squash them

3518
01:13:42,870 --> 01:13:42,880
in your kitchen you tend to squash them
 

3519
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:45,030
in your kitchen you tend to squash them
but if they're ants on the sidewalk and

3520
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:45,040
but if they're ants on the sidewalk and
 

3521
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:47,430
but if they're ants on the sidewalk and
you're walking by do you feel some great

3522
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:47,440
you're walking by do you feel some great
 

3523
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:49,070
you're walking by do you feel some great
conviction that you have to squash any

3524
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:49,080
conviction that you have to squash any
 

3525
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:51,270
conviction that you have to squash any
of them no you you generally don't right

3526
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:51,280
of them no you you generally don't right
 

3527
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,390
of them no you you generally don't right
we're irrelevant to them all they need

3528
01:13:53,390 --> 01:13:53,400
we're irrelevant to them all they need
 

3529
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:56,350
we're irrelevant to them all they need
to do is keep an eye on on us to see

3530
01:13:56,350 --> 01:13:56,360
to do is keep an eye on on us to see
 

3531
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:57,910
to do is keep an eye on on us to see
whether we're approaching the kind of

3532
01:13:57,910 --> 01:13:57,920
whether we're approaching the kind of
 

3533
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:01,830
whether we're approaching the kind of
technological capability and know about

3534
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:01,840
technological capability and know about
 

3535
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:04,189
technological capability and know about
them and have intentions of attacking

3536
01:14:04,189 --> 01:14:04,199
them and have intentions of attacking
 

3537
01:14:04,199 --> 01:14:07,590
them and have intentions of attacking
them and then they can squash us right

3538
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:07,600
them and then they can squash us right
 

3539
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,990
them and then they can squash us right
um they you know they could have done it

3540
01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:10,000
um they you know they could have done it
 

3541
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,550
um they you know they could have done it
long ago yeah they'll do it if they want

3542
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:12,560
long ago yeah they'll do it if they want
 

3543
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:15,270
long ago yeah they'll do it if they want
to whether we advertise our presence or

3544
01:14:15,270 --> 01:14:15,280
to whether we advertise our presence or
 

3545
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:18,070
to whether we advertise our presence or
not is is irrelevant so I really think

3546
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:18,080
not is is irrelevant so I really think
 

3547
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,590
not is is irrelevant so I really think
that that's not a huge existential

3548
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:20,600
that that's not a huge existential
 

3549
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:23,750
that that's not a huge existential
threat so this is a good place to bring

3550
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:23,760
threat so this is a good place to bring
 

3551
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:26,229
threat so this is a good place to bring
up a difficult topic you mentioned um

3552
01:14:26,229 --> 01:14:26,239
up a difficult topic you mentioned um
 

3553
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:29,030
up a difficult topic you mentioned um
they're they might they would be paying

3554
01:14:29,030 --> 01:14:29,040
they're they might they would be paying
 

3555
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,270
they're they might they would be paying
attention to us to see if we come up

3556
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:31,280
attention to us to see if we come up
 

3557
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:32,870
attention to us to see if we come up
with any crazy

3558
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:32,880
with any crazy
 

3559
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:35,990
with any crazy
technology there's folks who have uh

3560
01:14:35,990 --> 01:14:36,000
technology there's folks who have uh
 

3561
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,229
technology there's folks who have uh
reported UFO sightings there's actually

3562
01:14:38,229 --> 01:14:38,239
reported UFO sightings there's actually
 

3563
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:40,430
reported UFO sightings there's actually
I've recently found out there's uh

3564
01:14:40,430 --> 01:14:40,440
I've recently found out there's uh
 

3565
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:42,830
I've recently found out there's uh
websites that track this the D the data

3566
01:14:42,830 --> 01:14:42,840
websites that track this the D the data
 

3567
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:45,629
websites that track this the D the data
of these reportings and there's millions

3568
01:14:45,629 --> 01:14:45,639
of these reportings and there's millions
 

3569
01:14:45,639 --> 01:14:49,510
of these reportings and there's millions
of them in the past uh several decades

3570
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:49,520
of them in the past uh several decades
 

3571
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,910
of them in the past uh several decades
so seven decades and so on that they've

3572
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:51,920
so seven decades and so on that they've
 

3573
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,350
so seven decades and so on that they've
been

3574
01:14:53,350 --> 01:14:53,360
been
 

3575
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:58,830
been
recorded and the yist community as they

3576
01:14:58,830 --> 01:14:58,840
recorded and the yist community as they
 

3577
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:02,070
recorded and the yist community as they
refer to themselves you know one of the

3578
01:15:02,070 --> 01:15:02,080
refer to themselves you know one of the
 

3579
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:04,750
refer to themselves you know one of the
ideas that I find compelling from an

3580
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:04,760
ideas that I find compelling from an
 

3581
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:07,590
ideas that I find compelling from an
alien perspective that they kind of

3582
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:07,600
alien perspective that they kind of
 

3583
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:10,709
alien perspective that they kind of
started showing up ever since we figured

3584
01:15:10,709 --> 01:15:10,719
started showing up ever since we figured
 

3585
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:13,669
started showing up ever since we figured
out how to build nuclear weapons MH that

3586
01:15:13,669 --> 01:15:13,679
out how to build nuclear weapons MH that
 

3587
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:17,350
out how to build nuclear weapons MH that
we should what a coincidence yeah uh so

3588
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:17,360
we should what a coincidence yeah uh so
 

3589
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,110
we should what a coincidence yeah uh so
I mean you know if I was an alien I

3590
01:15:19,110 --> 01:15:19,120
I mean you know if I was an alien I
 

3591
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:21,669
I mean you know if I was an alien I
would start showing up then as well just

3592
01:15:21,669 --> 01:15:21,679
would start showing up then as well just
 

3593
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:23,550
would start showing up then as well just
well why not just observe us from afar

3594
01:15:23,550 --> 01:15:23,560
well why not just observe us from afar
 

3595
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:25,590
well why not just observe us from afar
no I know right I would figure out

3596
01:15:25,590 --> 01:15:25,600
no I know right I would figure out
 

3597
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,270
no I know right I would figure out
but that's why I'm always uh keeping a

3598
01:15:28,270 --> 01:15:28,280
but that's why I'm always uh keeping a
 

3599
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:31,390
but that's why I'm always uh keeping a
distance and staying blurry right

3600
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:31,400
distance and staying blurry right
 

3601
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:34,550
distance and staying blurry right
but very pixelated very pixelated you

3602
01:15:34,550 --> 01:15:34,560
but very pixelated very pixelated you
 

3603

but very pixelated very pixelated you
know there there is a something in the

3604
01:15:36,470 --> 01:15:36,480
know there there is a something in the
 

3605
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:39,270
know there there is a something in the
human condition that a cognition that

3606
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:39,280
human condition that a cognition that
 

3607
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,870
human condition that a cognition that
wants to see wants to believe beautiful

3608
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:41,880
wants to see wants to believe beautiful
 

3609
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:44,590
wants to see wants to believe beautiful
things and uh some are terrifying some

3610
01:15:44,590 --> 01:15:44,600
things and uh some are terrifying some
 

3611
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:45,510
things and uh some are terrifying some
are

3612
01:15:45,510 --> 01:15:45,520
are
 

3613
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:49,270
are
exciting uh goats Bigfoot is a big

3614
01:15:49,270 --> 01:15:49,280
exciting uh goats Bigfoot is a big
 

3615

Fascination for folks yeah and uh UFO

3616
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:52,400
Fascination for folks yeah and uh UFO
 

3617
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,830
Fascination for folks yeah and uh UFO
sightings I think falls into that

3618
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:53,840
sightings I think falls into that
 

3619
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:56,110
sightings I think falls into that
there's people that look at lights in

3620
01:15:56,110 --> 01:15:56,120
there's people that look at lights in
 

3621
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:58,550

and I
mean there's it's kind of a downer to

3626
01:16:03,510 --> 01:16:03,520
mean there's it's kind of a downer to
 

3627
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:06,470
mean there's it's kind of a downer to
think in a skeptical sense to think that

3628
01:16:06,470 --> 01:16:06,480
think in a skeptical sense to think that
 

3629
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,750
think in a skeptical sense to think that
that's just a light yeah you want to

3630
01:16:08,750 --> 01:16:08,760
that's just a light yeah you want to
 

3631

feel like there's something magical
 

3633
01:16:10,679 --> 01:16:13,070
feel like there's something magical
there sure uh I mean I felt that first

3634
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:13,080
there sure uh I mean I felt that first
 

3635
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:15,870
there sure uh I mean I felt that first
when my dad my dad's a physicist when he

3636
01:16:15,870 --> 01:16:15,880
when my dad my dad's a physicist when he
 

3637
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:18,310
when my dad my dad's a physicist when he
first told me about ball lightning yeah

3638
01:16:18,310 --> 01:16:18,320
first told me about ball lightning yeah
 

3639
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,149
first told me about ball lightning yeah
when I was like a little kid very weird

3640
01:16:20,149 --> 01:16:20,159
when I was like a little kid very weird
 

3641
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:23,070
when I was like a little kid very weird
very like weird physical phenomena and

3642
01:16:23,070 --> 01:16:23,080
very like weird physical phenomena and
 

3643
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:26,750
very like weird physical phenomena and
you said his intuition was telling me

3644
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:26,760
you said his intuition was telling me
 

3645
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:29,550
you said his intuition was telling me
this as a little kid uh like I really

3646
01:16:29,550 --> 01:16:29,560
this as a little kid uh like I really
 

3647
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:31,750
this as a little kid uh like I really
like math his intuition was whoever

3648
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:31,760
like math his intuition was whoever
 

3649
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,590
like math his intuition was whoever
figures out ball lightning will get a

3650
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:33,600
figures out ball lightning will get a
 

3651
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,430

Nobel Prize mhm like he I think that was

3652
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:36,440
Nobel Prize mhm like he I think that was
 

3653
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:38,709
Nobel Prize mhm like he I think that was
a side comment he gave me and I I

3654
01:16:38,709 --> 01:16:38,719
a side comment he gave me and I I
 

3655
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,430
a side comment he gave me and I I
decided there when I was like 5 years

3656
01:16:40,430 --> 01:16:40,440
decided there when I was like 5 years
 

3657
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:42,310
decided there when I was like 5 years
old or whatever that I'm going to win a

3658
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:42,320
old or whatever that I'm going to win a
 

3659
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:45,110
old or whatever that I'm going to win a
Nobel Prize for figuring out B that was

3660
01:16:45,110 --> 01:16:45,120
Nobel Prize for figuring out B that was
 

3661
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:47,070
Nobel Prize for figuring out B that was
like one of the first sort of Sparks of

3662
01:16:47,070 --> 01:16:47,080
like one of the first sort of Sparks of
 

3663
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:49,870
like one of the first sort of Sparks of
the scientific mindset those Mysteries

3664
01:16:49,870 --> 01:16:49,880
the scientific mindset those Mysteries
 

3665
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:51,870
the scientific mindset those Mysteries
they capture your imagination I I think

3666
01:16:51,870 --> 01:16:51,880
they capture your imagination I I think
 

3667
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:55,110
they capture your imagination I I think
when I speak to people that report UFOs

3668
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:55,120
when I speak to people that report UFOs
 

3669
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:57,830
when I speak to people that report UFOs
that's that fire that's what I see that

3670
01:16:57,830 --> 01:16:57,840
that's that fire that's what I see that
 

3671
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:00,830
that's that fire that's what I see that
excitement yeah I understand that MH but

3672
01:17:00,830 --> 01:17:00,840
excitement yeah I understand that MH but
 

3673
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:03,030
excitement yeah I understand that MH but
what what do we do with that because

3674
01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:03,040
what what do we do with that because
 

3675
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:05,189
what what do we do with that because
there's hundreds of thousands if not

3676
01:17:05,189 --> 01:17:05,199
there's hundreds of thousands if not
 

3677
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:07,149
there's hundreds of thousands if not
millions and then the scientific

3678
01:17:07,149 --> 01:17:07,159
millions and then the scientific
 

3679
01:17:07,159 --> 01:17:09,390
millions and then the scientific
Community you're like the perfect person

3680
01:17:09,390 --> 01:17:09,400
Community you're like the perfect person
 

3681
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:13,870
Community you're like the perfect person
you you have an awesome Einstein sure I

3682
01:17:13,870 --> 01:17:13,880
you you have an awesome Einstein sure I
 

3683
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:16,990
you you have an awesome Einstein sure I
what what do we do with those reports

3684
01:17:16,990 --> 01:17:17,000
what what do we do with those reports
 

3685
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,070
what what do we do with those reports
it's uh most of the scientific Community

3686
01:17:19,070 --> 01:17:19,080
it's uh most of the scientific Community
 

3687
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:20,790
it's uh most of the scientific Community
kind of rolls their eyes and dismisses

3688
01:17:20,790 --> 01:17:20,800
kind of rolls their eyes and dismisses
 

3689
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:26,550
kind of rolls their eyes and dismisses
it is it is it possible that a Time % of

3690
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:26,560
it is it is it possible that a Time % of
 

3691
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:29,110
it is it is it possible that a Time % of
those folks saw something that's worth

3692
01:17:29,110 --> 01:17:29,120
those folks saw something that's worth
 

3693
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,550
those folks saw something that's worth
deeply investigating sure we should

3694
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:31,560
deeply investigating sure we should
 

3695
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:33,310
deeply investigating sure we should
investigate it it's just one of these

3696
01:17:33,310 --> 01:17:33,320
investigate it it's just one of these
 

3697
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:35,270
investigate it it's just one of these
things where you know they've not

3698
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:35,280
things where you know they've not
 

3699
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,189
things where you know they've not
brought us a hunk of kryptonite or

3700
01:17:37,189 --> 01:17:37,199
brought us a hunk of kryptonite or
 

3701
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:38,910
brought us a hunk of kryptonite or
something like that right they haven't

3702
01:17:38,910 --> 01:17:38,920
something like that right they haven't
 

3703
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:42,149
something like that right they haven't
brought us actual tangible physical

3704
01:17:42,149 --> 01:17:42,159
brought us actual tangible physical
 

3705
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:43,990
brought us actual tangible physical
evidence with which experiments can be

3706
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:44,000
evidence with which experiments can be
 

3707
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,830
evidence with which experiments can be
done in Laboratories right it's it's

3708
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:46,840
done in Laboratories right it's it's
 

3709
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:50,189
done in Laboratories right it's it's
anecdotal evidence the photographs are

3710
01:17:50,189 --> 01:17:50,199
anecdotal evidence the photographs are
 

3711
01:17:50,199 --> 01:17:52,229
anecdotal evidence the photographs are
um in some cases in most cases I would

3712
01:17:52,229 --> 01:17:52,239
um in some cases in most cases I would
 

3713
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:54,990
um in some cases in most cases I would
say quite ambiguous I don't know what to

3714
01:17:54,990 --> 01:17:55,000
say quite ambiguous I don't know what to
 

3715
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,189
say quite ambiguous I don't know what to
think about so David fraver is the first

3716
01:17:57,189 --> 01:17:57,199
think about so David fraver is the first
 

3717
01:17:57,199 --> 01:18:00,070
think about so David fraver is the first
person he's a Navy pilot Commander yeah

3718
01:18:00,070 --> 01:18:00,080
person he's a Navy pilot Commander yeah
 

3719
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,390
person he's a Navy pilot Commander yeah
and there's a bunch of them but he's

3720
01:18:01,390 --> 01:18:01,400
and there's a bunch of them but he's
 

3721
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:05,629
and there's a bunch of them but he's
sort of one of the most legit pilots in

3722
01:18:05,629 --> 01:18:05,639
sort of one of the most legit pilots in
 

3723
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:09,430
sort of one of the most legit pilots in
people I've ever met right the fact that

3724
01:18:09,430 --> 01:18:09,440
people I've ever met right the fact that
 

3725
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:11,510
people I've ever met right the fact that
he saw something weird he doesn't know

3726
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:11,520
he saw something weird he doesn't know
 

3727
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,910
he saw something weird he doesn't know
what the heck it is yeah he saw

3728
01:18:13,910 --> 01:18:13,920
what the heck it is yeah he saw
 

3729
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:16,030
what the heck it is yeah he saw
something weird I mean I don't know what

3730
01:18:16,030 --> 01:18:16,040
something weird I mean I don't know what
 

3731
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:18,350
something weird I mean I don't know what
to do with that and one on the psych

3732
01:18:18,350 --> 01:18:18,360
to do with that and one on the psych
 

3733
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,629
to do with that and one on the psych
psychological side so I'm pretty

3734
01:18:20,629 --> 01:18:20,639
psychological side so I'm pretty
 

3735
01:18:20,639 --> 01:18:24,070
psychological side so I'm pretty
confident he saw what he says he saw

01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:30,189
something weird
right one of the interesting

3742
01:18:30,189 --> 01:18:30,199
right one of the interesting
 

3743
01:18:30,199 --> 01:18:32,669
right one of the interesting
psychological things that worries me is

3744
01:18:32,669 --> 01:18:32,679
psychological things that worries me is
 

3745
01:18:32,679 --> 01:18:34,149
psychological things that worries me is
that

3746
01:18:34,149 --> 01:18:34,159
that
 

3747
01:18:34,159 --> 01:18:37,030
that
everybody in the Navy everybody in the

3748
01:18:37,030 --> 01:18:37,040
everybody in the Navy everybody in the
 

3749
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,709
everybody in the Navy everybody in the
US government everybody in the

3750
01:18:38,709 --> 01:18:38,719
US government everybody in the
 

3751
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:42,350
US government everybody in the
scientific Community just kind of like

3752
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:42,360
scientific Community just kind of like
 

3753
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:45,669
scientific Community just kind of like
uh pretended that nothing happened mhm

3754
01:18:45,669 --> 01:18:45,679
uh pretended that nothing happened mhm
 

3755
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:47,470
uh pretended that nothing happened mhm
that kind of instinct that's what makes

3756
01:18:47,470 --> 01:18:47,480
that kind of instinct that's what makes
 

3757
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:49,470
that kind of instinct that's what makes
me believe if aliens show up we would

3758
01:18:49,470 --> 01:18:49,480
me believe if aliens show up we would
 

3759
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:53,030
me believe if aliens show up we would
all like just ignore their presence

3760
01:18:53,030 --> 01:18:53,040
all like just ignore their presence
 

3761
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:56,229
all like just ignore their presence
that's what bothered me that you

3762
01:18:56,229 --> 01:18:56,239
that's what bothered me that you
 

3763
01:18:56,239 --> 01:18:58,990
that's what bothered me that you
don't you don't investigate it more

3764
01:18:58,990 --> 01:18:59,000
don't you don't investigate it more
 

3765
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,030
don't you don't investigate it more
carefully and use this opportunity to

3766
01:19:01,030 --> 01:19:01,040
carefully and use this opportunity to
 

3767
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:05,750
carefully and use this opportunity to
inspire the world like so in terms of

3768
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:05,760
inspire the world like so in terms of
 

3769
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:09,149
inspire the world like so in terms of
kryptonite I think the conspiracy theory

3770
01:19:09,149 --> 01:19:09,159
kryptonite I think the conspiracy theory
 

3771
01:19:09,159 --> 01:19:12,229
kryptonite I think the conspiracy theory
folks say that whenever there is some

3772
01:19:12,229 --> 01:19:12,239
folks say that whenever there is some
 

3773
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:14,350
folks say that whenever there is some
good hard evidence that scientists would

3774
01:19:14,350 --> 01:19:14,360
good hard evidence that scientists would
 

3775
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:16,669
good hard evidence that scientists would
be excited about the U there's this kind

3776
01:19:16,669 --> 01:19:16,679
be excited about the U there's this kind
 

3777
01:19:16,679 --> 01:19:18,910
be excited about the U there's this kind
of conspiracy that I don't like cuz it's

3778
01:19:18,910 --> 01:19:18,920
of conspiracy that I don't like cuz it's
 

3779
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,629
of conspiracy that I don't like cuz it's
ultimately negative that the US

3780
01:19:20,629 --> 01:19:20,639
ultimately negative that the US
 

3781
01:19:20,639 --> 01:19:22,910
ultimately negative that the US
government will somehow hide the good

3782
01:19:22,910 --> 01:19:22,920
government will somehow hide the good
 

3783
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:26,189
government will somehow hide the good
evidence yeah uh to uh to protect it of

3784
01:19:26,189 --> 01:19:26,199
evidence yeah uh to uh to protect it of
 

3785
01:19:26,199 --> 01:19:28,149
evidence yeah uh to uh to protect it of
course there's some legitimacy to it cuz

3786
01:19:28,149 --> 01:19:28,159
course there's some legitimacy to it cuz
 

3787
01:19:28,159 --> 01:19:31,990
course there's some legitimacy to it cuz
you want to protect military uh Secrets

3788
01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:32,000
you want to protect military uh Secrets
 

3789
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,550
you want to protect military uh Secrets
all that kind of stuff

3790
01:19:33,550 --> 01:19:33,560
all that kind of stuff
 

3791
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:36,629
all that kind of stuff
but yeah I I don't know I don't know

3792
01:19:36,629 --> 01:19:36,639
but yeah I I don't know I don't know
 

3793
01:19:36,639 --> 01:19:38,310
but yeah I I don't know I don't know
what to do with this beautiful mess

3794
01:19:38,310 --> 01:19:38,320
what to do with this beautiful mess
 

3795
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:41,270
what to do with this beautiful mess
because um I think think millions of

3796
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:41,280
because um I think think millions of
 

3797
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:44,950
because um I think think millions of
people are inspired by UFOs right and it

3798
01:19:44,950 --> 01:19:44,960
people are inspired by UFOs right and it
 

3799
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:46,750
people are inspired by UFOs right and it
feels like an opportunity to inspire

3800
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:46,760
feels like an opportunity to inspire
 

3801
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:48,350
feels like an opportunity to inspire
people about science so I would say you

3802
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:48,360
people about science so I would say you
 

3803
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:50,550
people about science so I would say you
know as Carl hean used to say

3804
01:19:50,550 --> 01:19:50,560
know as Carl hean used to say
 

3805
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,310
know as Carl hean used to say
extraordinary claims require

3806
01:19:52,310 --> 01:19:52,320
extraordinary claims require
 

3807
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:55,149
extraordinary claims require
extraordinary evidence right I've quoted

3808
01:19:55,149 --> 01:19:55,159
extraordinary evidence right I've quoted
 

3809
01:19:55,159 --> 01:19:58,110
extraordinary evidence right I've quoted
him a number of times

3810
01:19:58,110 --> 01:19:58,120
him a number of times
 

3811
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:01,470
him a number of times
uh we would we would welcome such

3812
01:20:01,470 --> 01:20:01,480
uh we would we would welcome such
 

3813
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:04,830
uh we would we would welcome such
evidence uh on the other hand you know a

3814
01:20:04,830 --> 01:20:04,840
evidence uh on the other hand you know a
 

3815
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:06,550
evidence uh on the other hand you know a
lot of the things that are seen or

3816
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:06,560
lot of the things that are seen or
 

3817
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:09,390
lot of the things that are seen or
perhaps even hidden from us you could

3818
01:20:09,390 --> 01:20:09,400
perhaps even hidden from us you could
 

3819
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:11,990
perhaps even hidden from us you could
imagine for military purposes

3820
01:20:11,990 --> 01:20:12,000
imagine for military purposes
 

3821
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,550
imagine for military purposes
surveillance purposes the US government

3822
01:20:14,550 --> 01:20:14,560
surveillance purposes the US government
 

3823
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:17,350
surveillance purposes the US government
doesn't want us to know or maybe some of

3824
01:20:17,350 --> 01:20:17,360
doesn't want us to know or maybe some of
 

3825
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:20,149
doesn't want us to know or maybe some of
these Pilots saw Soviet or Israeli or

3826
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:20,159
these Pilots saw Soviet or Israeli or
 

3827
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:23,430
these Pilots saw Soviet or Israeli or
whatever uh satellites right a lot of

3828
01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:23,440
whatever uh satellites right a lot of
 

3829
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,390
whatever uh satellites right a lot of
the or some of the crashes that have

3830
01:20:25,390 --> 01:20:25,400
the or some of the crashes that have
 

3831
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,709
the or some of the crashes that have
occurred were later found to be you know

3832
01:20:27,709 --> 01:20:27,719
occurred were later found to be you know
 

3833
01:20:27,719 --> 01:20:30,910
occurred were later found to be you know
weather balloons or whatever you know

3834
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:30,920
weather balloons or whatever you know
 

3835
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:33,390
weather balloons or whatever you know
when there are more conventional

3836
01:20:33,390 --> 01:20:33,400
when there are more conventional
 

3837
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:37,830
when there are more conventional
explanations science tends to stay away

3838
01:20:37,830 --> 01:20:37,840
explanations science tends to stay away
 

3839
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:41,110
explanations science tends to stay away
from the um from The Sensational ones

3840
01:20:41,110 --> 01:20:41,120
from the um from The Sensational ones
 

3841
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:44,750
from the um from The Sensational ones
right and so it may be that someone

3842
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:44,760
right and so it may be that someone
 

3843
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:47,910
right and so it may be that someone
else's calling in life is to investigate

3844
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:47,920
else's calling in life is to investigate
 

3845
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:50,390
else's calling in life is to investigate
these phenomena and I welcome that as a

3846
01:20:50,390 --> 01:20:50,400
these phenomena and I welcome that as a
 

3847
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:53,030
these phenomena and I welcome that as a
scientist I I don't categorically

3848
01:20:53,030 --> 01:20:53,040
scientist I I don't categorically
 

3849
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:55,830
scientist I I don't categorically
actually deny the possibility

3850
01:20:55,830 --> 01:20:55,840
actually deny the possibility
 

3851
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:58,030
actually deny the possibility
that ships of some sort could have

3852
01:20:58,030 --> 01:20:58,040
that ships of some sort could have
 

3853
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:00,709
that ships of some sort could have
visited us because as I said earlier at

3854
01:21:00,709 --> 01:21:00,719
visited us because as I said earlier at
 

3855
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:03,270
visited us because as I said earlier at
slow speeds there's no problem in

3856
01:21:03,270 --> 01:21:03,280
slow speeds there's no problem in
 

3857
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,189
slow speeds there's no problem in
reaching other stars in fact our Voyager

3858
01:21:05,189 --> 01:21:05,199
reaching other stars in fact our Voyager
 

3859
01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:07,629
reaching other stars in fact our Voyager
and Pioneer spacecraft in a few million

3860
01:21:07,629 --> 01:21:07,639
and Pioneer spacecraft in a few million
 

3861
01:21:07,639 --> 01:21:10,189
and Pioneer spacecraft in a few million
years are going to be in the vicinity of

3862
01:21:10,189 --> 01:21:10,199
years are going to be in the vicinity of
 

3863
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:11,870
years are going to be in the vicinity of
different Stars we can even calculate

3864
01:21:11,870 --> 01:21:11,880
different Stars we can even calculate
 

3865
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:13,229
different Stars we can even calculate
which ones they're going to be in the

3866
01:21:13,229 --> 01:21:13,239
which ones they're going to be in the
 

3867
01:21:13,239 --> 01:21:15,990
which ones they're going to be in the
vicinity of right uh so there's nothing

3868
01:21:15,990 --> 01:21:16,000
vicinity of right uh so there's nothing
 

3869
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,070
vicinity of right uh so there's nothing
that breaks any laws of physics if you

3870
01:21:18,070 --> 01:21:18,080
that breaks any laws of physics if you
 

3871
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,430
that breaks any laws of physics if you
do it slowly but that's different you

3872
01:21:20,430 --> 01:21:20,440
do it slowly but that's different you
 

3873
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:22,510
do it slowly but that's different you
know just having Voyager or Pioneer fly

3874
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:22,520
know just having Voyager or Pioneer fly
 

3875
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:24,750
know just having Voyager or Pioneer fly
by some star that's different from

3876
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:24,760
by some star that's different from
 

3877
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:27,110
by some star that's different from
having active aliens altering the

3878
01:21:27,110 --> 01:21:27,120
having active aliens altering the
 

3879
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:30,350
having active aliens altering the
trajectory of their vehicle in real time

3880
01:21:30,350 --> 01:21:30,360
trajectory of their vehicle in real time
 

3881
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:33,070
trajectory of their vehicle in real time
spying on us and then either zipping

3882
01:21:33,070 --> 01:21:33,080
spying on us and then either zipping
 

3883
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:36,070
spying on us and then either zipping
back to their home planet or sending

3884
01:21:36,070 --> 01:21:36,080
back to their home planet or sending
 

3885
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:39,550
back to their home planet or sending
signals that tell them about us because

3886
01:21:39,550 --> 01:21:39,560
signals that tell them about us because
 

3887
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:42,030
signals that tell them about us because
they are likely many years many light

3888
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:42,040
they are likely many years many light
 

3889
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:44,350
they are likely many years many light
years away and they're not going to have

3890
01:21:44,350 --> 01:21:44,360
years away and they're not going to have
 

3891
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:48,030
years away and they're not going to have
broken that barrier as well okay right

3892
01:21:48,030 --> 01:21:48,040
broken that barrier as well okay right
 

3893
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:51,510
broken that barrier as well okay right
so so I I just you

3894
01:21:51,510 --> 01:21:51,520
so so I I just you
 

3895
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:54,750
so so I I just you
know go ahead study them great I you

3896
01:21:54,750 --> 01:21:54,760
know go ahead study them great I you
 

3897
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:56,750
know go ahead study them great I you
know for some young kid who wants to do

3898
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:56,760
know for some young kid who wants to do
 

3899
01:21:56,760 --> 01:22:00,149
know for some young kid who wants to do
it it might be their calling and that's

3900
01:22:00,149 --> 01:22:00,159
it it might be their calling and that's
 

3901
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:01,669
it it might be their calling and that's
how they might find meaning in their

3902
01:22:01,669 --> 01:22:01,679
how they might find meaning in their
 

3903
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:04,310
how they might find meaning in their
lives is to be the scientist who really

3904
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:04,320
lives is to be the scientist who really
 

3905
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:07,390
lives is to be the scientist who really
explores these things I chose not to

3906
01:22:07,390 --> 01:22:07,400
explores these things I chose not to
 

3907
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:10,070
explores these things I chose not to
because at a very young age I found the

3908
01:22:10,070 --> 01:22:10,080
because at a very young age I found the
 

3909
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:11,669
because at a very young age I found the
evidence to the degree that I

3910
01:22:11,669 --> 01:22:11,679
evidence to the degree that I
 

3911
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:14,030
evidence to the degree that I
investigated it to be really quite

3912
01:22:14,030 --> 01:22:14,040
investigated it to be really quite
 

3913
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:16,870
investigated it to be really quite
unconvincing and I had other things that

3914
01:22:16,870 --> 01:22:16,880
unconvincing and I had other things that
 

3915
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,669
unconvincing and I had other things that
I wanted to do but I don't categorically

3916
01:22:19,669 --> 01:22:19,679
I wanted to do but I don't categorically
 

3917
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:21,830
I wanted to do but I don't categorically
deny the possibility and I think it

3918
01:22:21,830 --> 01:22:21,840
deny the possibility and I think it
 

3919
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:24,870
deny the possibility and I think it
should be investigated yep I mean this

3920
01:22:24,870 --> 01:22:24,880
should be investigated yep I mean this
 

3921
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:26,990
should be investigated yep I mean this
is uh this is one of those phenomena

3922
01:22:26,990 --> 01:22:27,000
is uh this is one of those phenomena
 

3923
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,870
is uh this is one of those phenomena
that um

3924
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:28,880
that um
 

3925
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:31,629
that um
99.9% of people are almost definitely

3926
01:22:31,629 --> 01:22:31,639
99.9% of people are almost definitely
 

3927
01:22:31,639 --> 01:22:34,310
99.9% of people are almost definitely
there's conventional explanations and

3928
01:22:34,310 --> 01:22:34,320
there's conventional explanations and
 

3929
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:37,470
there's conventional explanations and
then there's like mysterious things that

3930
01:22:37,470 --> 01:22:37,480
then there's like mysterious things that
 

3931
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:40,709
then there's like mysterious things that
probably have explanations that are a

3932
01:22:40,709 --> 01:22:40,719
probably have explanations that are a
 

3933
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:43,390
probably have explanations that are a
little bit more complicated yeah it's

3934
01:22:43,390 --> 01:22:43,400
little bit more complicated yeah it's
 

3935
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:45,550
little bit more complicated yeah it's
but there's not enough to work with I

3936
01:22:45,550 --> 01:22:45,560
but there's not enough to work with I
 

3937
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:48,950
but there's not enough to work with I
tend to believe that if aliens showed up

3938
01:22:48,950 --> 01:22:48,960
tend to believe that if aliens showed up
 

3939
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,950
tend to believe that if aliens showed up
there will be plenty of evidence uh for

3940
01:22:51,950 --> 01:22:51,960
there will be plenty of evidence uh for
 

3941
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:56,149
there will be plenty of evidence uh for
scientists to study that like it exactly

3942
01:22:56,149 --> 01:22:56,159
scientists to study that like it exactly
 

3943
01:22:56,159 --> 01:22:57,709
scientists to study that like it exactly
U as you

3944
01:22:57,709 --> 01:22:57,719
U as you
 

3945
01:22:57,719 --> 01:23:00,550
U as you
said a voyager type of spacecraft I

3946
01:23:00,550 --> 01:23:00,560
said a voyager type of spacecraft I
 

3947
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:04,110
said a voyager type of spacecraft I
could see sort of um some kind of kind

3948
01:23:04,110 --> 01:23:04,120
could see sort of um some kind of kind
 

3949
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:06,910
could see sort of um some kind of kind
of a dumb thing almost like a sensor to

3950
01:23:06,910 --> 01:23:06,920
of a dumb thing almost like a sensor to
 

3951
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:09,510
of a dumb thing almost like a sensor to
like probing like statistically speaking

3952
01:23:09,510 --> 01:23:09,520
like probing like statistically speaking
 

3953
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:12,030
like probing like statistically speaking
flying by maybe lands maybe there's some

3954
01:23:12,030 --> 01:23:12,040
flying by maybe lands maybe there's some
 

3955
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:13,750
flying by maybe lands maybe there's some
kind of robot type of thingies that just

3956
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:13,760
kind of robot type of thingies that just
 

3957
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:15,950
kind of robot type of thingies that just
like move around and so on yeah like in

3958
01:23:15,950 --> 01:23:15,960
like move around and so on yeah like in
 

3959
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:18,270
like move around and so on yeah like in
ways that we don't understand but but I

3960
01:23:18,270 --> 01:23:18,280
ways that we don't understand but but I
 

3961
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:20,270
ways that we don't understand but but I
feel like

3962
01:23:20,270 --> 01:23:20,280
feel like
 

3963
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:23,629
feel like
well I feel like there'll be plenty of

3964
01:23:23,629 --> 01:23:23,639
well I feel like there'll be plenty of
 

3965
01:23:23,639 --> 01:23:24,950
well I feel like there'll be plenty of
hard

3966
01:23:24,950 --> 01:23:24,960
hard
 

3967
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:28,470
hard
hard to dismiss evidence and I also

3968
01:23:28,470 --> 01:23:28,480
hard to dismiss evidence and I also
 

3969
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:31,669
hard to dismiss evidence and I also
especially this year believe that the US

3970
01:23:31,669 --> 01:23:31,679
especially this year believe that the US
 

3971
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:35,430
especially this year believe that the US
government is not sufficiently competent

3972
01:23:35,430 --> 01:23:35,440
government is not sufficiently competent
 

3973
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:37,229
government is not sufficiently competent
given the huge amount of evidence that

3974
01:23:37,229 --> 01:23:37,239
given the huge amount of evidence that
 

3975
01:23:37,239 --> 01:23:38,790
given the huge amount of evidence that
would be revealed from this kind of

3976
01:23:38,790 --> 01:23:38,800
would be revealed from this kind of
 

3977
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:42,030
would be revealed from this kind of
thing to conceal all of it right uh at

3978
01:23:42,030 --> 01:23:42,040
thing to conceal all of it right uh at
 

3979
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:44,030
thing to conceal all of it right uh at
least in modern times you can say maybe

3980
01:23:44,030 --> 01:23:44,040
least in modern times you can say maybe
 

3981
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:47,030
least in modern times you can say maybe
decades ago but in modern times but you

3982
01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:47,040
decades ago but in modern times but you
 

3983
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:49,229
decades ago but in modern times but you
know I uh the the people I speak to and

3984
01:23:49,229 --> 01:23:49,239
know I uh the the people I speak to and
 

3985
01:23:49,239 --> 01:23:51,030
know I uh the the people I speak to and
the reason I bring it up is because so

3986
01:23:51,030 --> 01:23:51,040
the reason I bring it up is because so
 

3987
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:53,030
the reason I bring it up is because so
many people write to me they're inspired

3988
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:53,040
many people write to me they're inspired
 

3989
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:54,750
many people write to me they're inspired
by it by the way I wanted to comment on

3990
01:23:54,750 --> 01:23:54,760
by it by the way I wanted to comment on
 

3991
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:56,790
by it by the way I wanted to comment on
something you said earlier um yeah I had

3992
01:23:56,790 --> 01:23:56,800
something you said earlier um yeah I had
 

3993
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,590
something you said earlier um yeah I had
said that I'm sort of an a pessimist in

3994
01:23:59,590 --> 01:23:59,600
said that I'm sort of an a pessimist in
 

3995
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:02,390
said that I'm sort of an a pessimist in
that I think there are very few other

3996
01:24:02,390 --> 01:24:02,400
that I think there are very few other
 

3997
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:04,750
that I think there are very few other
intelligent mechanically able creatures

3998
01:24:04,750 --> 01:24:04,760
intelligent mechanically able creatures
 

3999
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:07,790
intelligent mechanically able creatures
out there but then I said yes in a sense

4000
01:24:07,790 --> 01:24:07,800
out there but then I said yes in a sense
 

4001
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:09,750
out there but then I said yes in a sense
I'm an optimist as you pointed out

4002
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:09,760
I'm an optimist as you pointed out
 

4003
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:12,110
I'm an optimist as you pointed out
because it means that we made it through

4004
01:24:12,110 --> 01:24:12,120
because it means that we made it through
 

4005
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:14,270
because it means that we made it through
the great filter right I I meant

4006
01:24:14,270 --> 01:24:14,280
the great filter right I I meant
 

4007
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:16,470
the great filter right I I meant
originally that I'm a pessimist in that

4008
01:24:16,470 --> 01:24:16,480
originally that I'm a pessimist in that
 

4009
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:19,590
originally that I'm a pessimist in that
I'm pessimistic about the possibility

4010
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:19,600
I'm pessimistic about the possibility
 

4011
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,830
I'm pessimistic about the possibility
that there are many many of us out there

4012
01:24:21,830 --> 01:24:21,840
that there are many many of us out there
 

4013
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,910
that there are many many of us out there
you mathematically speaking in the Drake

4014
01:24:23,910 --> 01:24:23,920
you mathematically speaking in the Drake
 

4015
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:26,470
you mathematically speaking in the Drake
equation exactly right right but but it

4016
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:26,480
equation exactly right right but but it
 

4017
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,470
equation exactly right right but but it
may mean a good thing for our ultimate

4018
01:24:28,470 --> 01:24:28,480
may mean a good thing for our ultimate
 

4019
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:30,310
may mean a good thing for our ultimate
survival right so I'm glad you caught me

4020
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:30,320
survival right so I'm glad you caught me
 

4021
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:31,790
survival right so I'm glad you caught me
on that yeah I I definitely agree with

4022
01:24:31,790 --> 01:24:31,800
on that yeah I I definitely agree with
 

4023
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,669
on that yeah I I definitely agree with
you I it is ultimately an optimistic

4024
01:24:33,669 --> 01:24:33,679
you I it is ultimately an optimistic
 

4025
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:35,629
you I it is ultimately an optimistic
statement but anyway I think you know

4026
01:24:35,629 --> 01:24:35,639
statement but anyway I think you know
 

4027
01:24:35,639 --> 01:24:39,189
statement but anyway I think you know
UFO research is is interesting and I

4028
01:24:39,189 --> 01:24:39,199
UFO research is is interesting and I
 

4029
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:41,270
UFO research is is interesting and I
guess one of the reasons I've not been

4030
01:24:41,270 --> 01:24:41,280
guess one of the reasons I've not been
 

4031
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:43,109
guess one of the reasons I've not been
terribly convinced is that I think there

4032
01:24:43,109 --> 01:24:43,119
terribly convinced is that I think there
 

4033
01:24:43,119 --> 01:24:45,109
terribly convinced is that I think there
are some scientists who are

4034
01:24:45,109 --> 01:24:45,119
are some scientists who are
 

4035
01:24:45,119 --> 01:24:47,910
are some scientists who are
investigating this and they've not found

4036
01:24:47,910 --> 01:24:47,920
investigating this and they've not found
 

4037
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:50,430
investigating this and they've not found
any clear evidence now I must admit I

4038
01:24:50,430 --> 01:24:50,440
any clear evidence now I must admit I
 

4039
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:52,550
any clear evidence now I must admit I
have not looked through the literature

4040
01:24:52,550 --> 01:24:52,560
have not looked through the literature
 

4041
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:54,550
have not looked through the literature
to convince myself that there are many

4042
01:24:54,550 --> 01:24:54,560
to convince myself that there are many
 

4043
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:56,629
to convince myself that there are many
scientists doing systematic studies of

4044
01:24:56,629 --> 01:24:56,639
scientists doing systematic studies of
 

4045
01:24:56,639 --> 01:24:58,870
scientists doing systematic studies of
these various reports so I can't say for

4046
01:24:58,870 --> 01:24:58,880
these various reports so I can't say for
 

4047
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:01,430
these various reports so I can't say for
sure that there's a critical mass of

4048
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:01,440
sure that there's a critical mass of
 

4049
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:03,950
sure that there's a critical mass of
them it's just that you you never get

4050
01:25:03,950 --> 01:25:03,960
them it's just that you you never get
 

4051
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:06,390
them it's just that you you never get
these reports from Hardcore scientists

4052
01:25:06,390 --> 01:25:06,400
these reports from Hardcore scientists
 

4053
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:07,709
these reports from Hardcore scientists
that's other thing and astronomers you

4054
01:25:07,709 --> 01:25:07,719
that's other thing and astronomers you
 

4055
01:25:07,719 --> 01:25:09,750
that's other thing and astronomers you
know what do we do we spend our time

4056
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:09,760
know what do we do we spend our time
 

4057
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,189
know what do we do we spend our time
studying the heavens and you'd think

4058
01:25:11,189 --> 01:25:11,199
studying the heavens and you'd think
 

4059
01:25:11,199 --> 01:25:13,669
studying the heavens and you'd think
we'd be the ones that are most likely

4060
01:25:13,669 --> 01:25:13,679
we'd be the ones that are most likely
 

4061
01:25:13,679 --> 01:25:15,910
we'd be the ones that are most likely
aside from Pilots perhaps at seeing

4062
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:15,920
aside from Pilots perhaps at seeing
 

4063
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:18,350
aside from Pilots perhaps at seeing
weird things in the sky and we just

4064
01:25:18,350 --> 01:25:18,360
weird things in the sky and we just
 

4065
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:21,830
weird things in the sky and we just
never do of the unexplained UFO type

4066
01:25:21,830 --> 01:25:21,840
never do of the unexplained UFO type
 

4067
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:24,390
never do of the unexplained UFO type
nature yeah I definitely I I try to keep

4068
01:25:24,390 --> 01:25:24,400
nature yeah I definitely I I try to keep
 

4069
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:27,189
nature yeah I definitely I I try to keep
an open mind but for people who listen

4070
01:25:27,189 --> 01:25:27,199
an open mind but for people who listen
 

4071
01:25:27,199 --> 01:25:30,149
an open mind but for people who listen
um it's actually really difficult for a

4072
01:25:30,149 --> 01:25:30,159
um it's actually really difficult for a
 

4073
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:32,270
um it's actually really difficult for a
scientist like I get

4074
01:25:32,270 --> 01:25:32,280
scientist like I get
 

4075
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:34,310
scientist like I get
probably like this year I probably

4076
01:25:34,310 --> 01:25:34,320
probably like this year I probably
 

4077
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:37,830
probably like this year I probably
gotten over probably maybe maybe over a

4078
01:25:37,830 --> 01:25:37,840
gotten over probably maybe maybe over a
 

4079
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:41,669
gotten over probably maybe maybe over a
thousand emails on on the topic of AGI

4080
01:25:41,669 --> 01:25:41,679
thousand emails on on the topic of AGI
 

4081
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:45,550
thousand emails on on the topic of AGI
mhm it's very difficult to uh you know

4082
01:25:45,550 --> 01:25:45,560
mhm it's very difficult to uh you know
 

4083
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:47,470
mhm it's very difficult to uh you know
people write to me it's like how can you

4084
01:25:47,470 --> 01:25:47,480
people write to me it's like how can you
 

4085
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:50,550
people write to me it's like how can you
ignore this in AI side like this model

4086
01:25:50,550 --> 01:25:50,560
ignore this in AI side like this model
 

4087
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:52,149
ignore this in AI side like this model
this is obviously the model that's going

4088
01:25:52,149 --> 01:25:52,159
this is obviously the model that's going
 

4089
01:25:52,159 --> 01:25:53,950
this is obviously the model that's going
to achieve general intelligence how can

4090
01:25:53,950 --> 01:25:53,960
to achieve general intelligence how can
 

4091
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:55,350
to achieve general intelligence how can
you IGN know it I'm giving you the

4092
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:55,360
you IGN know it I'm giving you the
 

4093
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:56,950
you IGN know it I'm giving you the
answer here's my document and there

4094
01:25:56,950 --> 01:25:56,960
answer here's my document and there
 

4095
01:25:56,960 --> 01:26:00,790
answer here's my document and there
always just these large writeups the

4096
01:26:00,790 --> 01:26:00,800
always just these large writeups the
 

4097
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:04,189
always just these large writeups the
problem is it's very difficult to we

4098
01:26:04,189 --> 01:26:04,199
problem is it's very difficult to we
 

4099
01:26:04,199 --> 01:26:07,790
problem is it's very difficult to we
weed through a bunch of BS right it's

4100
01:26:07,790 --> 01:26:07,800
weed through a bunch of BS right it's
 

4101
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:11,350
weed through a bunch of BS right it's
it's very possible that you had actually

4102
01:26:11,350 --> 01:26:11,360
it's very possible that you had actually
 

4103
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:13,950
it's very possible that you had actually
saw the UFO but you have to

4104
01:26:13,950 --> 01:26:13,960
saw the UFO but you have to
 

4105
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:16,350
saw the UFO but you have to
acknowledge by UFO I mean an extr

4106
01:26:16,350 --> 01:26:16,360
acknowledge by UFO I mean an extr
 

4107
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:17,910
acknowledge by UFO I mean an extr
terrestrial life right you have to

4108
01:26:17,910 --> 01:26:17,920
terrestrial life right you have to
 

4109
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:20,910
terrestrial life right you have to
acknowledge the hundreds of thousands of

4110
01:26:20,910 --> 01:26:20,920
acknowledge the hundreds of thousands of
 

4111
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:22,629
acknowledge the hundreds of thousands of
people who

4112
01:26:22,629 --> 01:26:22,639
people who
 

4113
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:26,510
people who
are a little bit if not a lot full of BS

4114
01:26:26,510 --> 01:26:26,520
are a little bit if not a lot full of BS
 

4115
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:29,390
are a little bit if not a lot full of BS
and from a scientist perspective it just

4116
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:29,400
and from a scientist perspective it just
 

4117
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:32,550
and from a scientist perspective it just
it's really hard work and it's um when

4118
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:32,560
it's really hard work and it's um when
 

4119
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:34,109
it's really hard work and it's um when
there's amazing stuff out there it's

4120
01:26:34,109 --> 01:26:34,119
there's amazing stuff out there it's
 

4121
01:26:34,119 --> 01:26:37,270
there's amazing stuff out there it's
like why investigate Bigfoot when

4122
01:26:37,270 --> 01:26:37,280
like why investigate Bigfoot when
 

4123
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:39,709
like why investigate Bigfoot when
evolution in all of its richness is

4124
01:26:39,709 --> 01:26:39,719
evolution in all of its richness is
 

4125
01:26:39,719 --> 01:26:41,430
evolution in all of its richness is
beautiful who cares about a monkey that

4126
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:41,440
beautiful who cares about a monkey that
 

4127
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:44,149
beautiful who cares about a monkey that
walks on two feet like there's a zillion

4128
01:26:44,149 --> 01:26:44,159
walks on two feet like there's a zillion
 

4129
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:46,790
walks on two feet like there's a zillion
decoys right at

4130
01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:46,800
decoys right at
 

4131
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:49,870
decoys right at
observatories true fact we get lots and

4132
01:26:49,870 --> 01:26:49,880
observatories true fact we get lots and
 

4133
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:53,149
observatories true fact we get lots and
lots of phone calls when Venus the

4134
01:26:53,149 --> 01:26:53,159
lots of phone calls when Venus the
 

4135
01:26:53,159 --> 01:26:55,350
lots of phone calls when Venus the
evening star but just really a a bright

4136
01:26:55,350 --> 01:26:55,360
evening star but just really a a bright
 

4137
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:57,270
evening star but just really a a bright
Planet happens to be close to the

4138
01:26:57,270 --> 01:26:57,280
Planet happens to be close to the
 

4139
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,030
Planet happens to be close to the
Crescent Moon because it's such a

4140
01:26:59,030 --> 01:26:59,040
Crescent Moon because it's such a
 

4141
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:01,030
Crescent Moon because it's such a
striking pair this happens once in a

4142
01:27:01,030 --> 01:27:01,040
striking pair this happens once in a
 

4143
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:02,310
striking pair this happens once in a
while so we get these phone calls oh

4144
01:27:02,310 --> 01:27:02,320
while so we get these phone calls oh
 

4145
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:05,229
while so we get these phone calls oh
there's a UFO next to the moon and no

4146
01:27:05,229 --> 01:27:05,239
there's a UFO next to the moon and no
 

4147
01:27:05,239 --> 01:27:08,109
there's a UFO next to the moon and no
it's Venus and so they're just and I'm

4148
01:27:08,109 --> 01:27:08,119
it's Venus and so they're just and I'm
 

4149
01:27:08,119 --> 01:27:11,629
it's Venus and so they're just and I'm
not saying the the best UFO reports are

4150
01:27:11,629 --> 01:27:11,639
not saying the the best UFO reports are
 

4151
01:27:11,639 --> 01:27:13,189
not saying the the best UFO reports are
of that nature no there are some much

4152
01:27:13,189 --> 01:27:13,199
of that nature no there are some much
 

4153
01:27:13,199 --> 01:27:14,870
of that nature no there are some much
more convincing cases and I've seen some

4154
01:27:14,870 --> 01:27:14,880
more convincing cases and I've seen some
 

4155
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:17,310
more convincing cases and I've seen some
of the footage and blah blah blah um but

4156
01:27:17,310 --> 01:27:17,320
of the footage and blah blah blah um but
 

4157
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:19,390
of the footage and blah blah blah um but
it's just there's so many decoys right

4158
01:27:19,390 --> 01:27:19,400
it's just there's so many decoys right
 

4159
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,470
it's just there's so many decoys right
so much so much noise that you have to

4160
01:27:21,470 --> 01:27:21,480
so much so much noise that you have to
 

4161
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:23,390
so much so much noise that you have to
filter out Y and there's only so many

4162
01:27:23,390 --> 01:27:23,400
filter out Y and there's only so many
 

4163
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:25,990
filter out Y and there's only so many
scientists so it's there's so there's

4164
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:26,000
scientists so it's there's so there's
 

4165
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,550
scientists so it's there's so there's
only so much time as well and you have

4166
01:27:27,550 --> 01:27:27,560
only so much time as well and you have
 

4167
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:30,229
only so much time as well and you have
to choose what problems you work on you

4168
01:27:30,229 --> 01:27:30,239
to choose what problems you work on you
 

4169
01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:33,070
to choose what problems you work on you
know this might be a fun question asked

4170
01:27:33,070 --> 01:27:33,080
know this might be a fun question asked
 

4171
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:34,709
know this might be a fun question asked
to kind of

4172
01:27:34,709 --> 01:27:34,719
to kind of
 

4173
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:37,270
to kind of
explore the idea of the expanding

4174
01:27:37,270 --> 01:27:37,280
explore the idea of the expanding
 

4175
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:41,750
explore the idea of the expanding
Universe yeah so the the radius of the

4176
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:41,760
Universe yeah so the the radius of the
 

4177
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:44,550
Universe yeah so the the radius of the
observable universe is

4178
01:27:44,550 --> 01:27:44,560
observable universe is
 

4179
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:47,950
observable universe is
45.7 billion light years yeah and the

4180
01:27:47,950 --> 01:27:47,960
45.7 billion light years yeah and the
 

4181
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:52,310
45.7 billion light years yeah and the
age of the universe is

4182
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:52,320
age of the universe is
 

4183
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:56,510
age of the universe is
13.7 yeah billion years MH mhm that's

4184
01:27:56,510 --> 01:27:56,520
13.7 yeah billion years MH mhm that's
 

4185
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:59,070
13.7 yeah billion years MH mhm that's
less right than the radius of the

4186
01:27:59,070 --> 01:27:59,080
less right than the radius of the
 

4187
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:01,910
less right than the radius of the
universe yeah how's that possible so

4188
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:01,920
universe yeah how's that possible so
 

4189
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:04,510
universe yeah how's that possible so
that's a great question so the and I

4190
01:28:04,510 --> 01:28:04,520
that's a great question so the and I
 

4191
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:06,430
that's a great question so the and I
meant to bring a little a little prop I

4192
01:28:06,430 --> 01:28:06,440
meant to bring a little a little prop I
 

4193
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:08,109
meant to bring a little a little prop I
have with pingpong balls on a rubber

4194
01:28:08,109 --> 01:28:08,119
have with pingpong balls on a rubber
 

4195
01:28:08,119 --> 01:28:10,590
have with pingpong balls on a rubber
hose a rubber band I I use it in many of

4196
01:28:10,590 --> 01:28:10,600
hose a rubber band I I use it in many of
 

4197
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:13,430
hose a rubber band I I use it in many of
the lectures that one can find of me

4198
01:28:13,430 --> 01:28:13,440
the lectures that one can find of me
 

4199
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:16,070
the lectures that one can find of me
online but you have in an expanding

4200
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:16,080
online but you have in an expanding
 

4201
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:18,270
online but you have in an expanding
Universe the space itself between

4202
01:28:18,270 --> 01:28:18,280
Universe the space itself between
 

4203
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:20,590
Universe the space itself between
galaxies or more correctly clusters of

4204
01:28:20,590 --> 01:28:20,600
galaxies or more correctly clusters of
 

4205
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:24,310
galaxies or more correctly clusters of
galaxies expanding so imagine light

4206
01:28:24,310 --> 01:28:24,320
galaxies expanding so imagine light
 

4207
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:27,109
galaxies expanding so imagine light
going from one cluster to another it

4208
01:28:27,109 --> 01:28:27,119
going from one cluster to another it
 

4209
01:28:27,119 --> 01:28:30,109
going from one cluster to another it
traverses some distance and then while

4210
01:28:30,109 --> 01:28:30,119
traverses some distance and then while
 

4211
01:28:30,119 --> 01:28:33,350
traverses some distance and then while
it's traversing the rest that part that

4212
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:33,360
it's traversing the rest that part that
 

4213
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:37,390
it's traversing the rest that part that
it already traveled through continues to

4214
01:28:37,390 --> 01:28:37,400
it already traveled through continues to
 

4215
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:41,790
it already traveled through continues to
expand now 13.7 billion years might have

4216
01:28:41,790 --> 01:28:41,800
expand now 13.7 billion years might have
 

4217
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:45,270
expand now 13.7 billion years might have
gone by since the light that we are say

4218
01:28:45,270 --> 01:28:45,280
gone by since the light that we are say
 

4219
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:48,109
gone by since the light that we are say
seeing from the early stages the

4220
01:28:48,109 --> 01:28:48,119
seeing from the early stages the
 

4221
01:28:48,119 --> 01:28:49,990
seeing from the early stages the
so-called Cosmic microwave background

4222
01:28:49,990 --> 01:28:50,000
so-called Cosmic microwave background
 

4223
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,510
so-called Cosmic microwave background
radiation which is the the Afterglow of

4224
01:28:52,510 --> 01:28:52,520
radiation which is the the Afterglow of
 

4225
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:54,669
radiation which is the the Afterglow of
the Big Bang or the echo of the big Bang

4226
01:28:54,669 --> 01:28:54,679
the Big Bang or the echo of the big Bang
 

4227
01:28:54,679 --> 01:28:57,270
the Big Bang or the echo of the big Bang
Yeah 13.7 billion years have gone by

4228
01:28:57,270 --> 01:28:57,280
Yeah 13.7 billion years have gone by
 

4229
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:59,590
Yeah 13.7 billion years have gone by
that's how long it's taken that light to

4230
01:28:59,590 --> 01:28:59,600
that's how long it's taken that light to
 

4231
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:02,270
that's how long it's taken that light to
reach us but while it's been traveling

4232
01:29:02,270 --> 01:29:02,280
reach us but while it's been traveling
 

4233
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:04,669
reach us but while it's been traveling
that distance the parts that it already

4234
01:29:04,669 --> 01:29:04,679
that distance the parts that it already
 

4235
01:29:04,679 --> 01:29:08,149
that distance the parts that it already
traveled continue to expand MH so it's

4236
01:29:08,149 --> 01:29:08,159
traveled continue to expand MH so it's
 

4237
01:29:08,159 --> 01:29:10,790
traveled continue to expand MH so it's
like you're walking on at an airport you

4238
01:29:10,790 --> 01:29:10,800
like you're walking on at an airport you
 

4239
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:13,310
like you're walking on at an airport you
know on one of these walkways and you're

4240
01:29:13,310 --> 01:29:13,320
know on one of these walkways and you're
 

4241
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:14,590
know on one of these walkways and you're
walking along because you're trying to

4242
01:29:14,590 --> 01:29:14,600
walking along because you're trying to
 

4243
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:17,350
walking along because you're trying to
get to your terminal but the walkway is

4244
01:29:17,350 --> 01:29:17,360
get to your terminal but the walkway is
 

4245
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:20,629
get to your terminal but the walkway is
continuing as well you end up traveling

4246
01:29:20,629 --> 01:29:20,639
continuing as well you end up traveling
 

4247
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:22,750
continuing as well you end up traveling
a greater distance or the same distance

4248
01:29:22,750 --> 01:29:22,760
a greater distance or the same distance
 

4249
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:24,750
a greater distance or the same distance
faster is another way of putting it

4250
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:24,760
faster is another way of putting it
 

4251
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:26,390
faster is another way of putting it
right that's why you get on one of these

4252
01:29:26,390 --> 01:29:26,400
right that's why you get on one of these
 

4253
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:29,030
right that's why you get on one of these
traveling walkways but so you get a

4254
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:29,040
traveling walkways but so you get a
 

4255
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:31,629
traveling walkways but so you get a
roughly a roughly a factor of Pi you

4256
01:29:31,629 --> 01:29:31,639
roughly a roughly a factor of Pi you
 

4257
01:29:31,639 --> 01:29:33,870
roughly a roughly a factor of Pi you
know but it's more like 3.2 I think but

4258
01:29:33,870 --> 01:29:33,880
know but it's more like 3.2 I think but
 

4259
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:36,510
know but it's more like 3.2 I think but
when you work it all out you multiply

4260
01:29:36,510 --> 01:29:36,520
when you work it all out you multiply
 

4261
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:38,550
when you work it all out you multiply
the number of years the universe has

4262
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:38,560
the number of years the universe has
 

4263
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:41,229
the number of years the universe has
been in existence by you know three and

4264
01:29:41,229 --> 01:29:41,239
been in existence by you know three and
 

4265
01:29:41,239 --> 01:29:43,790
been in existence by you know three and
a quarter or so and that's how you get

4266
01:29:43,790 --> 01:29:43,800
a quarter or so and that's how you get
 

4267
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:47,669
a quarter or so and that's how you get
this 46 billion Lightyear

4268
01:29:47,669 --> 01:29:47,679
this 46 billion Lightyear
 

4269
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:49,669
this 46 billion Lightyear
radius

4270
01:29:49,669 --> 01:29:49,679
radius
 

4271
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:52,669
radius
but how is that let me ask some nice

4272
01:29:52,669 --> 01:29:52,679
but how is that let me ask some nice
 

4273
01:29:52,679 --> 01:29:55,270
but how is that let me ask some nice
dumb questions uh how is that not

4274
01:29:55,270 --> 01:29:55,280
dumb questions uh how is that not
 

4275
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:57,189
dumb questions uh how is that not
traveling faster than the speed of light

4276
01:29:57,189 --> 01:29:57,199
traveling faster than the speed of light
 

4277
01:29:57,199 --> 01:29:58,510
traveling faster than the speed of light
yeah it's not traveling faster than the

4278
01:29:58,510 --> 01:29:58,520
yeah it's not traveling faster than the
 

4279
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:00,830
yeah it's not traveling faster than the
speed of light because locally at any

4280
01:30:00,830 --> 01:30:00,840
speed of light because locally at any
 

4281
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:03,310
speed of light because locally at any
point if you were to measure the light

4282
01:30:03,310 --> 01:30:03,320
point if you were to measure the light
 

4283
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:06,189
point if you were to measure the light
the photon zipping past it would not be

4284
01:30:06,189 --> 01:30:06,199
the photon zipping past it would not be
 

4285
01:30:06,199 --> 01:30:08,270
the photon zipping past it would not be
exceeding the speed of light the speed

4286
01:30:08,270 --> 01:30:08,280
exceeding the speed of light the speed
 

4287
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:11,070
exceeding the speed of light the speed
of light is a locally measured quantity

4288
01:30:11,070 --> 01:30:11,080
of light is a locally measured quantity
 

4289
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:13,310
of light is a locally measured quantity
after light has traversed some distance

4290
01:30:13,310 --> 01:30:13,320
after light has traversed some distance
 

4291
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:16,189
after light has traversed some distance
if the rubber band keeps on stretching

4292
01:30:16,189 --> 01:30:16,199
if the rubber band keeps on stretching
 

4293
01:30:16,199 --> 01:30:18,830
if the rubber band keeps on stretching
then yes it looks like the light

4294
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:18,840
then yes it looks like the light
 

4295
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:21,310
then yes it looks like the light
traveled a greater distance than it

4296
01:30:21,310 --> 01:30:21,320
traveled a greater distance than it
 

4297
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:24,270
traveled a greater distance than it
would have had the space not been

4298
01:30:24,270 --> 01:30:24,280
would have had the space not been
 

4299
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:27,070
would have had the space not been
expanding but locally it never was

4300
01:30:27,070 --> 01:30:27,080
expanding but locally it never was
 

4301
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:28,510
expanding but locally it never was
exceeding the speed of light it's just

4302
01:30:28,510 --> 01:30:28,520
exceeding the speed of light it's just
 

4303
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:29,910
exceeding the speed of light it's just
that the distance through which it

4304
01:30:29,910 --> 01:30:29,920
that the distance through which it
 

4305
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:31,870
that the distance through which it
already traveled then went off and

4306
01:30:31,870 --> 01:30:31,880
already traveled then went off and
 

4307
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:35,990
already traveled then went off and
expanded on its own some more and if you

4308
01:30:35,990 --> 01:30:36,000
expanded on its own some more and if you
 

4309
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,870
expanded on its own some more and if you
give the light credit so to speak for

4310
01:30:38,870 --> 01:30:38,880
give the light credit so to speak for
 

4311
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:40,990
give the light credit so to speak for
having traversed that distance well then

4312
01:30:40,990 --> 01:30:41,000
having traversed that distance well then
 

4313
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,870
having traversed that distance well then
it looks like it's going faster than the

4314
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:42,880
it looks like it's going faster than the
 

4315
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:44,790
it looks like it's going faster than the
speed of light but but that's not that's

4316
01:30:44,790 --> 01:30:44,800
speed of light but but that's not that's
 

4317
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:46,550
speed of light but but that's not that's
not how spe that's happen right that's

4318
01:30:46,550 --> 01:30:46,560
not how spe that's happen right that's
 

4319
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,550
not how spe that's happen right that's
not how Speed Works speed and in

4320
01:30:48,550 --> 01:30:48,560
not how Speed Works speed and in
 

4321
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:51,669
not how Speed Works speed and in
relativity also the other thing um that

4322
01:30:51,669 --> 01:30:51,679
relativity also the other thing um that
 

4323
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:54,030
relativity also the other thing um that
is interesting is that you know if you

4324
01:30:54,030 --> 01:30:54,040
is interesting is that you know if you
 

4325
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:55,470
is interesting is that you know if you
take two ping-pong balls that are

4326
01:30:55,470 --> 01:30:55,480
take two ping-pong balls that are
 

4327
01:30:55,480 --> 01:30:57,669
take two ping-pong balls that are
sufficiently far apart especially in an

4328
01:30:57,669 --> 01:30:57,679
sufficiently far apart especially in an
 

4329
01:30:57,679 --> 01:30:59,790
sufficiently far apart especially in an
accelerating universe you can easily

4330
01:30:59,790 --> 01:30:59,800
accelerating universe you can easily
 

4331
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:01,550
accelerating universe you can easily
have them moving apart from one another

4332
01:31:01,550 --> 01:31:01,560
have them moving apart from one another
 

4333
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:03,669
have them moving apart from one another
faster than the speed of light so you

4334
01:31:03,669 --> 01:31:03,679
faster than the speed of light so you
 

4335
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:05,709
faster than the speed of light so you
know take two pingpong balls that were

4336
01:31:05,709 --> 01:31:05,719
know take two pingpong balls that were
 

4337
01:31:05,719 --> 01:31:08,430
know take two pingpong balls that were
originally 400,000 kilometers from each

4338
01:31:08,430 --> 01:31:08,440
originally 400,000 kilometers from each
 

4339
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:10,910
originally 400,000 kilometers from each
other and let every centimeter in your

4340
01:31:10,910 --> 01:31:10,920
other and let every centimeter in your
 

4341
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:14,189
other and let every centimeter in your
rubber band expand to two in one second

4342
01:31:14,189 --> 01:31:14,199
rubber band expand to two in one second
 

4343
01:31:14,199 --> 01:31:17,070
rubber band expand to two in one second
then suddenly this 400,000 kilometer

4344
01:31:17,070 --> 01:31:17,080
then suddenly this 400,000 kilometer
 

4345
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:19,629
then suddenly this 400,000 kilometer
distance is 800,000

4346
01:31:19,629 --> 01:31:19,639
distance is 800,000
 

4347
01:31:19,639 --> 01:31:24,390
distance is 800,000
km it went out by 400,000 km in 1 second

4349
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:28,070
km it went out by 400,000 km in 1 second
that exceeds the 300,000 kilom perss

4350
01:31:28,070 --> 01:31:28,080
that exceeds the 300,000 kilom perss
 

4351
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:31,669
that exceeds the 300,000 kilom perss
speed of light but that light limit that

4363
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,750

01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:47,760
from expanding faster than the speed of

light that's no problem Einstein

4366
01:31:49,590 --> 01:31:49,600
light that's no problem Einstein
 

4367
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,790
light that's no problem Einstein
wouldn't have had a problem with with a

01:31:51,790 --> 01:31:51,800
wouldn't have had a problem with with a
 

4369
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:54,709
wouldn't have had a problem with with a
with an with a universe and observed Now

4370
01:31:54,709 --> 01:31:54,719
with an with a universe and observed Now
 

4371
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:58,030
with an with a universe and observed Now
by cosmologists yeah I um I'm not sure

4372
01:31:58,030 --> 01:31:58,040
by cosmologists yeah I um I'm not sure
 

4373
01:31:58,040 --> 01:32:01,430
by cosmologists yeah I um I'm not sure
I'm yet ready to deal emotionally with

4374
01:32:01,430 --> 01:32:01,440
I'm yet ready to deal emotionally with
 

4375
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:04,669
I'm yet ready to deal emotionally with
expanding space it's like that to me is

4376
01:32:04,669 --> 01:32:04,679
expanding space it's like that to me is
 

4377
01:32:04,679 --> 01:32:07,189
expanding space it's like that to me is
one of the most a inspiring things you

4378
01:32:07,189 --> 01:32:07,199
one of the most a inspiring things you
 

4379
01:32:07,199 --> 01:32:09,629
one of the most a inspiring things you
know starting from the Big Bang it's

4380
01:32:09,629 --> 01:32:09,639
know starting from the Big Bang it's
 

4381
01:32:09,639 --> 01:32:12,709
know starting from the Big Bang it's
definit abstract it space itself is

4382
01:32:12,709 --> 01:32:12,719
definit abstract it space itself is
 

4383
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:16,870
definit abstract it space itself is
expanding right could you can we talk

4384
01:32:16,870 --> 01:32:16,880
expanding right could you can we talk
 

4385
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:19,030
expanding right could you can we talk
about the big bang a little bit sure

4386
01:32:19,030 --> 01:32:19,040
about the big bang a little bit sure
 

4387
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:22,510
about the big bang a little bit sure
yeah yeah what uh so like the entirety

4388
01:32:22,510 --> 01:32:22,520
yeah yeah what uh so like the entirety
 

4389
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:24,790
yeah yeah what uh so like the entirety
of it

4390
01:32:24,790 --> 01:32:24,800
of it
 

4391
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:28,189
of it
the universe yeah was very small right

4392
01:32:28,189 --> 01:32:28,199
the universe yeah was very small right
 

4393
01:32:28,199 --> 01:32:30,149
the universe yeah was very small right
but it was not a point it was not a

4394
01:32:30,149 --> 01:32:30,159
but it was not a point it was not a
 

4395
01:32:30,159 --> 01:32:32,310
but it was not a point it was not a
point because if if we live in what's

4396
01:32:32,310 --> 01:32:32,320
point because if if we live in what's
 

4397
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:35,310
point because if if we live in what's
called a closed Universe now a sphere or

4398
01:32:35,310 --> 01:32:35,320
called a closed Universe now a sphere or
 

4399
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:36,750
called a closed Universe now a sphere or
the three-dimensional version of that

4400
01:32:36,750 --> 01:32:36,760
the three-dimensional version of that
 

4401
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:37,790
the three-dimensional version of that
would be a

4402
01:32:37,790 --> 01:32:37,800
would be a
 

4403
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:41,189
would be a
hypersphere you know then regardless of

4404
01:32:41,189 --> 01:32:41,199
hypersphere you know then regardless of
 

4405
01:32:41,199 --> 01:32:43,390
hypersphere you know then regardless of
how far back in time you go it was

4406
01:32:43,390 --> 01:32:43,400
how far back in time you go it was
 

4407
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:46,229
how far back in time you go it was
always that topological shape you can't

4408
01:32:46,229 --> 01:32:46,239
always that topological shape you can't
 

4409
01:32:46,239 --> 01:32:49,229
always that topological shape you can't
turn a point suddenly into a shell okay

4410
01:32:49,229 --> 01:32:49,239
turn a point suddenly into a shell okay
 

4411
01:32:49,239 --> 01:32:52,470
turn a point suddenly into a shell okay
it always had to be a a shell yeah so

4412
01:32:52,470 --> 01:32:52,480
it always had to be a a shell yeah so
 

4413
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,229
it always had to be a a shell yeah so
when when people say well the universe

4414
01:32:54,229 --> 01:32:54,239
when when people say well the universe
 

4415
01:32:54,239 --> 01:32:56,270
when when people say well the universe
started out as a point that that's being

4416
01:32:56,270 --> 01:32:56,280
started out as a point that that's being
 

4417
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:58,550
started out as a point that that's being
kind of flippant kind of glib it didn't

4418
01:32:58,550 --> 01:32:58,560
kind of flippant kind of glib it didn't
 

4419
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:00,510
kind of flippant kind of glib it didn't
really it just started out a at a very

4420
01:33:00,510 --> 01:33:00,520
really it just started out a at a very
 

4421
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:03,590
really it just started out a at a very
high density and we don't know actually

4422
01:33:03,590 --> 01:33:03,600
high density and we don't know actually
 

4423
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,910
high density and we don't know actually
whether it was finite or infinite I

4424
01:33:05,910 --> 01:33:05,920
whether it was finite or infinite I
 

4425
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,910
whether it was finite or infinite I
think personally that it was finite at

4426
01:33:07,910 --> 01:33:07,920
think personally that it was finite at
 

4427
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:09,590
think personally that it was finite at
the time but it expanded very very

4428
01:33:09,590 --> 01:33:09,600
the time but it expanded very very
 

4429
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:12,990
the time but it expanded very very
quickly indeed if it exponentiated and

4430
01:33:12,990 --> 01:33:13,000
quickly indeed if it exponentiated and
 

4431
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,790
quickly indeed if it exponentiated and
continued in some places to exponentiate

4432
01:33:15,790 --> 01:33:15,800
continued in some places to exponentiate
 

4433
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:17,790
continued in some places to exponentiate
then it could in fact be infinite right

4434
01:33:17,790 --> 01:33:17,800
then it could in fact be infinite right
 

4435
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:19,629
then it could in fact be infinite right
now and most cosmologists think that it

4436
01:33:19,629 --> 01:33:19,639
now and most cosmologists think that it
 

4437
01:33:19,639 --> 01:33:22,229
now and most cosmologists think that it
is infinite wait yeah sorry what uh

4438
01:33:22,229 --> 01:33:22,239
is infinite wait yeah sorry what uh
 

4439
01:33:22,239 --> 01:33:24,590
is infinite wait yeah sorry what uh
infinite which dimension MTH

4440
01:33:24,590 --> 01:33:24,600
infinite which dimension MTH
 

4441
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:27,229
infinite which dimension MTH
si infite in space infinite in space and

4442
01:33:27,229 --> 01:33:27,239
si infite in space infinite in space and
 

4443
01:33:27,239 --> 01:33:28,870
si infite in space infinite in space and
by that I mean that if you were trying

4444
01:33:28,870 --> 01:33:28,880
by that I mean that if you were trying
 

4445
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:32,750
by that I mean that if you were trying
to meure use light to measure its size

4446
01:33:32,750 --> 01:33:32,760
to meure use light to measure its size
 

4447
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:34,669
to meure use light to measure its size
You' you'd never be able to measure its

4448
01:33:34,669 --> 01:33:34,679
You' you'd never be able to measure its
 

4449
01:33:34,679 --> 01:33:36,629
You' you'd never be able to measure its
size because it would always be bigger

4450
01:33:36,629 --> 01:33:36,639
size because it would always be bigger
 

4451
01:33:36,639 --> 01:33:39,070
size because it would always be bigger
than the distance light can travel

4452
01:33:39,070 --> 01:33:39,080
than the distance light can travel
 

4453
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:40,910
than the distance light can travel
that's what you get in a universe that's

4454
01:33:40,910 --> 01:33:40,920
that's what you get in a universe that's
 

4455
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:44,109
that's what you get in a universe that's
accelerating in its expansion okay but

4456
01:33:44,109 --> 01:33:44,119
accelerating in its expansion okay but
 

4457
01:33:44,119 --> 01:33:47,270
accelerating in its expansion okay but
if a thing was a hypersphere it's very

4458
01:33:47,270 --> 01:33:47,280
if a thing was a hypersphere it's very
 

4459
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:49,709
if a thing was a hypersphere it's very
small not a point yeah how can that

4460
01:33:49,709 --> 01:33:49,719
small not a point yeah how can that
 

4461
01:33:49,719 --> 01:33:53,030
small not a point yeah how can that
thing be infinite well it it expands

4462
01:33:53,030 --> 01:33:53,040
thing be infinite well it it expands
 

4463
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:55,030
thing be infinite well it it expands
exponentially that's what the inflation

4464
01:33:55,030 --> 01:33:55,040
exponentially that's what the inflation
 

4465
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:57,149

4493
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:31,270
amount of space remaining to be

4495
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:33,390

01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:39,310

01:34:41,910 --> 01:34:41,920
being infl INF that's one of the best
 

4505
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,430
being infl INF that's one of the best

01:34:43,430 --> 01:34:43,440
definitions of infinity by the way
 

4507
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:45,709

that's what's that that's one of the
 

4509

that's what's that that's one of the

4510
01:34:48,870 --> 01:34:48,880
best sort of uh physical manifestations
 

4511
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:50,790
best sort of uh physical manifestations
of infinity that yeah yeah because you

4512
01:34:50,790 --> 01:34:50,800
of infinity that yeah yeah because you
 

4513
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,470
of infinity that yeah yeah because you
have to ask how would you actually

4514
01:34:52,470 --> 01:34:52,480
have to ask how would you actually

01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,830
have to ask how would you actually

01:34:56,910 --> 01:34:56,920
cosmology theoretical friends well if I
 

4519
01:34:56,920 --> 01:34:58,990
cosmology theoretical friends well if I
took if I were God and I were outside

4520
01:34:58,990 --> 01:34:59,000
took if I were God and I were outside
 

4521
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,229
took if I were God and I were outside
this whole thing and I took a Godlike

01:35:01,229 --> 01:35:01,239
this whole thing and I took a Godlike
 

4523
01:35:01,239 --> 01:35:04,830
this whole thing and I took a Godlike
slice in time wouldn't it be finite no

4524
01:35:04,830 --> 01:35:04,840
slice in time wouldn't it be finite no
 

4525
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:07,070
slice in time wouldn't it be finite no
matter how big it is and they object and

4526
01:35:07,070 --> 01:35:07,080
matter how big it is and they object and
 

4527
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:10,149
matter how big it is and they object and
they say Alex you you can't be outside

4528
01:35:10,149 --> 01:35:10,159
they say Alex you you can't be outside
 

4529
01:35:10,159 --> 01:35:13,070
they say Alex you you can't be outside
and take a Godlike slice of time you

4530
01:35:13,070 --> 01:35:13,080
and take a Godlike slice of time you
 

4531
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:15,030
and take a Godlike slice of time you
know because there's nothing outside

4532
01:35:15,030 --> 01:35:15,040
know because there's nothing outside
 

4533
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:16,669
know because there's nothing outside
well I'm not you

4534
01:35:16,669 --> 01:35:16,679
well I'm not you
 

4535
01:35:16,679 --> 01:35:20,430
well I'm not you
know or also you know what slice of time

4536
01:35:20,430 --> 01:35:20,440
know or also you know what slice of time
 

4537
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:22,910
know or also you know what slice of time
you're taking depends on your motion and

4538
01:35:22,910 --> 01:35:22,920
you're taking depends on your motion and
 

4539
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:24,830
you're taking depends on your motion and
that's true even in special relativity

4540
01:35:24,830 --> 01:35:24,840
that's true even in special relativity
 

4541
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:28,030
that's true even in special relativity
that slices of time get tilted in a

4542
01:35:28,030 --> 01:35:28,040
that slices of time get tilted in a
 

4543
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:31,870
that slices of time get tilted in a
sense if you're moving quickly the axes

4544
01:35:31,870 --> 01:35:31,880
sense if you're moving quickly the axes
 

4545
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:35,510
sense if you're moving quickly the axes
x and t actually become tilted not not

01:35:35,510 --> 01:35:35,520
x and t actually become tilted not not
 

4547
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:38,510
x and t actually become tilted not not
perpendicular to one another um and you

4548
01:35:38,510 --> 01:35:38,520
perpendicular to one another um and you
 

4549
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:40,470
perpendicular to one another um and you
know you can look at Brian Green's books

4550
01:35:40,470 --> 01:35:40,480
know you can look at Brian Green's books
 

4551
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:42,709
know you can look at Brian Green's books
and lectures and other things where he

4552
01:35:42,709 --> 01:35:42,719
and lectures and other things where he
 

4553
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:45,669
and lectures and other things where he
he imagines taking a loaf loaf of bread

4554
01:35:45,669 --> 01:35:45,679
he imagines taking a loaf loaf of bread
 

4555
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:48,390
he imagines taking a loaf loaf of bread
and slicing it in units of time as you

4556
01:35:48,390 --> 01:35:48,400
and slicing it in units of time as you
 

4557
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:50,629
and slicing it in units of time as you
progress forward but then if you're

4558
01:35:50,629 --> 01:35:50,639
progress forward but then if you're
 

4559
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:53,669
progress forward but then if you're
zipping along relative to that loaf of

01:35:53,669 --> 01:35:53,679
zipping along relative to that loaf of
 

4561
01:35:53,679 --> 01:35:56,830
zipping along relative to that loaf of
bread the slices of time actually become

4562
01:35:56,830 --> 01:35:56,840
bread the slices of time actually become
 

4563
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:58,590
bread the slices of time actually become
tilted and so it's not even clear what

4564
01:35:58,590 --> 01:35:58,600
tilted and so it's not even clear what
 

4565
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:01,629
tilted and so it's not even clear what
slices of time mean but I I'm an

4566
01:36:01,629 --> 01:36:01,639
slices of time mean but I I'm an
 

4567
01:36:01,639 --> 01:36:03,310
slices of time mean but I I'm an

end of the telescope to look through and

4570
01:36:05,030 --> 01:36:05,040
end of the telescope to look through and
 

4571
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:07,030
end of the telescope to look through and
the way I understand the infinity is as

4572
01:36:07,030 --> 01:36:07,040
the way I understand the infinity is as
 

4573
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:10,149
the way I understand the infinity is as
I just told you that operationally or

4574
01:36:10,149 --> 01:36:10,159
I just told you that operationally or
 

4575
01:36:10,159 --> 01:36:12,510
I just told you that operationally or
observationally there no there'd be no

4576
01:36:12,510 --> 01:36:12,520
observationally there no there'd be no
 

4577
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:14,950
observationally there no there'd be no
way of seeing that it's a finite

4578
01:36:14,950 --> 01:36:14,960
way of seeing that it's a finite
 

4579
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:17,310
way of seeing that it's a finite
Universe of measuring a finite universe

4580
01:36:17,310 --> 01:36:17,320
Universe of measuring a finite universe
 

4581
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:20,390
Universe of measuring a finite universe
and so in that sense it's it's infinite

4582
01:36:20,390 --> 01:36:20,400
and so in that sense it's it's infinite
 

4583
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:23,189
and so in that sense it's it's infinite
even if it started out as a finite

4584
01:36:23,189 --> 01:36:23,199
even if it started out as a finite
 

4585
01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:26,109
even if it started out as a finite
little dot well you know not a DOT I'm

4586
01:36:26,109 --> 01:36:26,119
little dot well you know not a DOT I'm
 

4587
01:36:26,119 --> 01:36:28,590

sorry a finite little

4588
01:36:28,590 --> 01:36:28,600
sorry a finite little

4591
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:36,430

out there cuz what what what what

4592
01:36:36,430 --> 01:36:36,440
out there cuz what what what what
 

4593
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:38,470
out there cuz what what what what
happened before that well we don't know

4594
01:36:38,470 --> 01:36:38,480
happened before that well we don't know
 

4595
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:40,070
happened before that well we don't know
so this is where it gets into a lot of

4596
01:36:40,070 --> 01:36:40,080
so this is where it gets into a lot of
 

4597
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:42,550
so this is where it gets into a lot of
speculation and let's go I mean let's go

01:36:42,550 --> 01:36:42,560
speculation and let's go I mean let's go

01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:47,790

4606
01:36:52,310 --> 01:36:52,320
other universes out there I like to say
 

4607
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:53,550
other universes out there I like to say
that these are sort of on the bound

4615
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:00,870

well let's think about what happened

4616
01:37:00,870 --> 01:37:00,880
well let's think about what happened
 

4617
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:02,470
well let's think about what happened
before the Big Bang or let there be a

before the Big Bang or let there be a

there are these indirect ideas that stem

there are these indirect ideas that stem
forth so it's hard to prove uniqueness

forth so it's hard to prove uniqueness
 

4673
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:14,030
forth so it's hard to prove uniqueness
and it's hard to completely convince

4674
01:38:14,030 --> 01:38:14,040
and it's hard to completely convince
 

4675
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:16,990
and it's hard to completely convince
oneself that a certain hypothesis must

tests you have that it satisfies let's
say there are 50 predictions it makes

4684
01:38:24,990 --> 01:38:25,000
say there are 50 predictions it makes
 

4685
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:28,430
say there are 50 predictions it makes
and 49 of them are in are are things

4686
01:38:28,430 --> 01:38:28,440
and 49 of them are in are are things
 

4687
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:31,550
and 49 of them are in are are things
that you can measure and then the 50th

4688
01:38:31,550 --> 01:38:31,560
that you can measure and then the 50th
 

4689
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:33,550
that you can measure and then the 50th
one is the one where you you want to

4690
01:38:33,550 --> 01:38:33,560
one is the one where you you want to
 

4691
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:35,709
one is the one where you you want to
measure the actual existence of that

4692
01:38:35,709 --> 01:38:35,719
measure the actual existence of that
 

4693
01:38:35,719 --> 01:38:38,149
measure the actual existence of that
other universe or what happened before T

4694
01:38:38,149 --> 01:38:38,159
other universe or what happened before T
 

4695
01:38:38,159 --> 01:38:41,870
other universe or what happened before T
equals z and you can't do that but but

4696
01:38:41,870 --> 01:38:41,880
equals z and you can't do that but but
 

4697
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:44,830
equals z and you can't do that but but
you've satisfied 49 of the other

4698
01:38:44,830 --> 01:38:44,840
you've satisfied 49 of the other
 

4699
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:47,830
you've satisfied 49 of the other
testable predictions and so that's

4700
01:38:47,830 --> 01:38:47,840
testable predictions and so that's
 

4701
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:50,550
testable predictions and so that's

you know that's not really science

4710
01:38:57,310 --> 01:38:57,320
you know that's not really science
 

4711
01:38:57,320 --> 01:38:59,750
you know that's not really science
because it's not directly testable but I

4712
01:38:59,750 --> 01:38:59,760
because it's not directly testable but I
 

4713
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:02,550
because it's not directly testable but I
would say it's sort of testable but but

4714
01:39:02,550 --> 01:39:02,560
would say it's sort of testable but but
 

4715
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:04,189
would say it's sort of testable but but
it's not completely testable and so it's

4716
01:39:04,189 --> 01:39:04,199
it's not completely testable and so it's
 

4717
01:39:04,199 --> 01:39:05,830
it's not completely testable and so it's
at the boundary but it's not like we're

01:39:05,830 --> 01:39:05,840
at the boundary but it's not like we're
 

4719

a

yeah maybe I kind of doubt it so do you
 

4819
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:07,229
yeah maybe I kind of doubt it so do you
think it's possible to detect some like

01:41:07,229 --> 01:41:07,239
think it's possible to detect some like

01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:10,550
actually experimentally be able to
detect

4824
01:41:10,550 --> 01:41:10,560

some I don't know what it is radiation
 

4827
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:14,510
some I don't know what it is radiation
some some sort of yeah and the cosmic

01:41:14,510 --> 01:41:14,520
some some sort of yeah and the cosmic
 

4829
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:16,189
some some sort of yeah and the cosmic
microwave background radiation there may

4830
01:41:16,189 --> 01:41:16,199
microwave background radiation there may
 

4831
01:41:16,199 --> 01:41:20,390
microwave background radiation there may
be ways of doing that is but is it is it

4832
01:41:20,390 --> 01:41:20,400
be ways of doing that is but is it is it
 

4833
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:23,390
be ways of doing that is but is it is it
philosophically or practically possible

4834
01:41:23,390 --> 01:41:23,400
philosophically or practically possible

to detect signs that this was before the
 

4837
01:41:25,719 --> 01:41:28,229
to detect signs that this was before the
Big Bang or is it or is it what you said

4838
01:41:28,229 --> 01:41:28,239
Big Bang or is it or is it what you said
 

4839
01:41:28,239 --> 01:41:31,910
Big Bang or is it or is it what you said
which is like everything we observe will

4840
01:41:31,910 --> 01:41:31,920
which is like everything we observe will
 

4841
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:33,350
which is like everything we observe will
as we currently understand will have to

4842
01:41:33,350 --> 01:41:33,360
as we currently understand will have to
 

4843
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:35,149
as we currently understand will have to
be a creation of this particular

be a creation of this particular
 

4845
01:41:35,159 --> 01:41:37,030
be a creation of this particular
observable universe yeah I mean you know

4846
01:41:37,030 --> 01:41:37,040
observable universe yeah I mean you know
 

4847
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:39,470
observable universe yeah I mean you know
if you it's very difficult to answer

4848
01:41:39,470 --> 01:41:39,480
if you it's very difficult to answer
 

4849
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:42,189
if you it's very difficult to answer
right now because we don't have a single

4850
01:41:42,189 --> 01:41:42,199
right now because we don't have a single

01:41:47,990 --> 01:41:48,000
experimentally tested quantum theory of
 

4855
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,669
experimentally tested quantum theory of
gravity right and of course the

4856
01:41:49,669 --> 01:41:49,679
gravity right and of course the
 

4857
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:51,790

beginning of the universe is a large

4858
01:41:51,790 --> 01:41:51,800
beginning of the universe is a large
 

4859
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:54,270
beginning of the universe is a large
amount of stuff in a very small space so

4860
01:41:54,270 --> 01:41:54,280
amount of stuff in a very small space so
 

4861
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:55,790
amount of stuff in a very small space so
you need both quantum mechanics and

4862
01:41:55,790 --> 01:41:55,800
you need both quantum mechanics and
 

4863
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:57,750
you need both quantum mechanics and
general relativity same thing if our

4864
01:41:57,750 --> 01:41:57,760
general relativity same thing if our
 

4865
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:00,189

4867
01:42:00,199 --> 01:42:02,070

another big bang you know there's also

4868
01:42:02,070 --> 01:42:02,080
another big bang you know there's also
 

4869
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:04,270
another big bang you know there's also
ideas there that some of the information

4870
01:42:04,270 --> 01:42:04,280
ideas there that some of the information
 

4871
01:42:04,280 --> 01:42:06,790
ideas there that some of the information
leaks through or survives I don't know

4872
01:42:06,790 --> 01:42:06,800
leaks through or survives I don't know
 

4873
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:08,589
leaks through or survives I don't know
that we can answer that question right

4874
01:42:08,589 --> 01:42:08,599
that we can answer that question right
 

4875
01:42:08,599 --> 01:42:11,629
that we can answer that question right
now because we don't have a quantum

4876
01:42:11,629 --> 01:42:11,639
now because we don't have a quantum
 

4877
01:42:11,639 --> 01:42:14,709
now because we don't have a quantum
theory of gravity that most physicists

4878
01:42:14,709 --> 01:42:14,719
theory of gravity that most physicists
 

4879
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:16,550
theory of gravity that most physicists
uh believe in and belief is perhaps the

4880
01:42:16,550 --> 01:42:16,560
uh believe in and belief is perhaps the
 

4881
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:19,229
uh believe in and belief is perhaps the
wrong word that most physicists trust

4882
01:42:19,229 --> 01:42:19,239
wrong word that most physicists trust
 

4883
01:42:19,239 --> 01:42:21,990
wrong word that most physicists trust
because the experimental evidence favors

4884
01:42:21,990 --> 01:42:22,000
because the experimental evidence favors
 

4885
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,149
because the experimental evidence favors
it yeah right you know there are various

4886
01:42:24,149 --> 01:42:24,159
it yeah right you know there are various
 

4887
01:42:24,159 --> 01:42:26,070
it yeah right you know there are various
forms of string theory there's Quantum

4888
01:42:26,070 --> 01:42:26,080
forms of string theory there's Quantum
 

4889
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:29,189
forms of string theory there's Quantum
Loop gravity there are various ideas but

4890
01:42:29,189 --> 01:42:29,199
Loop gravity there are various ideas but
 

4891
01:42:29,199 --> 01:42:32,030
Loop gravity there are various ideas but
which if any will be the one that

4892
01:42:32,030 --> 01:42:32,040
which if any will be the one that
 

4893
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:34,750
which if any will be the one that
survives the test of time and more

4894
01:42:34,750 --> 01:42:34,760
survives the test of time and more
 

4895
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:37,070
survives the test of time and more
importantly within that the test of

4896
01:42:37,070 --> 01:42:37,080
importantly within that the test of
 

4897
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:40,149
importantly within that the test of
experiment and observation yeah so my

4898
01:42:40,149 --> 01:42:40,159
experiment and observation yeah so my
 

4899
01:42:40,159 --> 01:42:42,350
experiment and observation yeah so my
own feeling is probably these things

4900
01:42:42,350 --> 01:42:42,360
own feeling is probably these things
 

4901
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:44,270
own feeling is probably these things
don't survive I don't think we've seen

4902
01:42:44,270 --> 01:42:44,280
don't survive I don't think we've seen
 

4903
01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:46,149
don't survive I don't think we've seen
any evidence in the cosmic microwave

4904
01:42:46,149 --> 01:42:46,159
any evidence in the cosmic microwave

leaking through similarly um the one way

4908
01:42:52,629 --> 01:42:52,639
leaking through similarly um the one way
 

4909
01:42:52,639 --> 01:42:54,910
leaking through similarly um the one way
or one of the few ways in which we might

4910
01:42:54,910 --> 01:42:54,920
or one of the few ways in which we might
 

4911
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:56,790
or one of the few ways in which we might
test for the presence of other universes

4912
01:42:56,790 --> 01:42:56,800
test for the presence of other universes
 

4913
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:59,550
test for the presence of other universes
is if they were to collide with ours

4914
01:42:59,550 --> 01:42:59,560
is if they were to collide with ours
 

4915
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:01,790
is if they were to collide with ours
that would leave a a pattern a

4916
01:43:01,790 --> 01:43:01,800
that would leave a a pattern a
 

4917
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:03,709
that would leave a a pattern a

astrophysicists claim to have found it
 

4923
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:10,390
astrophysicists claim to have found it
but in my opinion it's not statistically

4924
01:43:10,390 --> 01:43:10,400
but in my opinion it's not statistically
 

4925
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:12,550
but in my opinion it's not statistically
significant to the level that would be

universe you know when we found it
 

4981
01:44:24,599 --> 01:44:27,629
universe you know when we found it
evidence for it in 1998 with supern noi

4982
01:44:27,629 --> 01:44:27,639
evidence for it in 1998 with supern noi
 

4983
01:44:27,639 --> 01:44:29,990
evidence for it in 1998 with supern noi
with exploding Stars it was great that

4984
01:44:29,990 --> 01:44:30,000
with exploding Stars it was great that
 

4985
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,149
with exploding Stars it was great that
there were two teams that lent some

4986
01:44:32,149 --> 01:44:32,159
there were two teams that lent some
 

4987
01:44:32,159 --> 01:44:34,510
there were two teams that lent some
credibility to the Discovery but it was

4988
01:44:34,510 --> 01:44:34,520
credibility to the Discovery but it was
 

4989
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:37,950
credibility to the Discovery but it was
not until other astrophysicists used not

4990
01:44:37,950 --> 01:44:37,960
not until other astrophysicists used not
 

4991
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:40,990
not until other astrophysicists used not
only that technique but more importantly

4992
01:44:40,990 --> 01:44:41,000
only that technique but more importantly
 

4993
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,149
only that technique but more importantly
other independent techniques that had

4994
01:44:43,149 --> 01:44:43,159
other independent techniques that had
 

4995
01:44:43,159 --> 01:44:45,830
other independent techniques that had
their own potential sources of

4996
01:44:45,830 --> 01:44:45,840
their own potential sources of
 

4997
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:48,149
their own potential sources of
systematic error or whatever but they

4998
01:44:48,149 --> 01:44:48,159
systematic error or whatever but they
 

4999
01:44:48,159 --> 01:44:50,109
systematic error or whatever but they
all came to the same conclusion and that

5000
01:44:50,109 --> 01:44:50,119
all came to the same conclusion and that
 

5001
01:44:50,119 --> 01:44:52,470
all came to the same conclusion and that
started giving a much more complete

5002
01:44:52,470 --> 01:44:52,480
started giving a much more complete
 

5003
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:53,990
started giving a much more complete
picture of what was going on in a

5004
01:44:53,990 --> 01:44:54,000
picture of what was going on in a
 

5005
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,669
picture of what was going on in a
picture in which most astrophysicists

5006
01:44:56,669 --> 01:44:56,679
picture in which most astrophysicists
 

5007
01:44:56,679 --> 01:44:59,629
picture in which most astrophysicists
quickly gained confidence that's why

5008
01:44:59,629 --> 01:44:59,639
quickly gained confidence that's why
 

5009
01:44:59,639 --> 01:45:02,070
quickly gained confidence that's why
that idea caught on so quickly is that

5010
01:45:02,070 --> 01:45:02,080
that idea caught on so quickly is that
 

5011
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:04,030
that idea caught on so quickly is that
there were other

5012
01:45:04,030 --> 01:45:04,040
there were other
 

5013
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:07,149
there were other
physicists and astronomers doing

5014
01:45:07,149 --> 01:45:07,159
physicists and astronomers doing
 

5015
01:45:07,159 --> 01:45:09,390
physicists and astronomers doing
observations completely independent of

01:45:09,390 --> 01:45:09,400
observations completely independent of
 

5017
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:11,830
observations completely independent of
supern noi that seemed to indicate the

5018
01:45:11,830 --> 01:45:11,840
supern noi that seemed to indicate the
 

5019
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:15,030
supern noi that seemed to indicate the
same thing yeah that period of

5020
01:45:15,030 --> 01:45:15,040
same thing yeah that period of
 

5021
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:18,790
same thing yeah that period of
uh of your life that work with a

5022
01:45:18,790 --> 01:45:18,800
uh of your life that work with a
 

5023
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:22,149
uh of your life that work with a
incredible team of people that um won

5024
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:22,159
incredible team of people that um won
 

5025
01:45:22,159 --> 01:45:24,390
incredible team of people that um won
the Nobel Prize

5026
01:45:24,390 --> 01:45:24,400
the Nobel Prize
 

5027
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:26,430
the Nobel Prize
is just fascinating work oh gosh you

5028
01:45:26,430 --> 01:45:26,440
is just fascinating work oh gosh you
 

5029
01:45:26,440 --> 01:45:29,310
is just fascinating work oh gosh you
know never in my wildest dreams as a kid

5030
01:45:29,310 --> 01:45:29,320
know never in my wildest dreams as a kid
 

5031
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:31,950
know never in my wildest dreams as a kid
did I think that I would be

5032
01:45:31,950 --> 01:45:31,960
did I think that I would be
 

5033
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:35,149
did I think that I would be
involved much less so heavily involved

5034
01:45:35,149 --> 01:45:35,159
involved much less so heavily involved
 

5035
01:45:35,159 --> 01:45:37,189
involved much less so heavily involved
in a discovery that's so revolutionary I

5036
01:45:37,189 --> 01:45:37,199
in a discovery that's so revolutionary I
 

5037
01:45:37,199 --> 01:45:39,070
in a discovery that's so revolutionary I
mean you know as a kid as a scientist if

5038
01:45:39,070 --> 01:45:39,080
mean you know as a kid as a scientist if
 

5039
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:41,149
mean you know as a kid as a scientist if
you're realistic once you learn a little

5040
01:45:41,149 --> 01:45:41,159
you're realistic once you learn a little
 

5041
01:45:41,159 --> 01:45:42,750
you're realistic once you learn a little
bit more about how science is done and

5042
01:45:42,750 --> 01:45:42,760
bit more about how science is done and
 

5043
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:44,070
bit more about how science is done and
you're not going to win a Nobel Prize

5044
01:45:44,070 --> 01:45:44,080
you're not going to win a Nobel Prize
 

5045
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:46,030
you're not going to win a Nobel Prize
and be the next Newton or Einstein or

5046
01:45:46,030 --> 01:45:46,040
and be the next Newton or Einstein or
 

5047
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:48,109
and be the next Newton or Einstein or
whatever you just hope that you'll

5048
01:45:48,109 --> 01:45:48,119
whatever you just hope that you'll
 

5049
01:45:48,119 --> 01:45:50,589
whatever you just hope that you'll
contribute something to humankind's

5050
01:45:50,589 --> 01:45:50,599
contribute something to humankind's
 

5051
01:45:50,599 --> 01:45:52,270
contribute something to humankind's
understanding of how nature works and

5052
01:45:52,270 --> 01:45:52,280
understanding of how nature works and
 

5053
01:45:52,280 --> 01:45:54,910
understanding of how nature works and
you'll be satis ified with that you know

5054
01:45:54,910 --> 01:45:54,920
you'll be satis ified with that you know
 

5055
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:56,709
you'll be satis ified with that you know
but here I was in the right place at the

5056
01:45:56,709 --> 01:45:56,719
but here I was in the right place at the
 

5057
01:45:56,719 --> 01:45:59,310
but here I was in the right place at the
right time a lot of luck a lot of hard

5058
01:45:59,310 --> 01:45:59,320
right time a lot of luck a lot of hard
 

5059
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:02,470
right time a lot of luck a lot of hard
work um and there it was you know we

5060
01:46:02,470 --> 01:46:02,480
work um and there it was you know we
 

5061
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:04,589
work um and there it was you know we
discovered something that was really

5062
01:46:04,589 --> 01:46:04,599
discovered something that was really
 

5063
01:46:04,599 --> 01:46:07,229
discovered something that was really
amazing and that that was the the

5064
01:46:07,229 --> 01:46:07,239
amazing and that that was the the
 

5065
01:46:07,239 --> 01:46:09,030
amazing and that that was the the
greatest thrill right I couldn't have

5066
01:46:09,030 --> 01:46:09,040
greatest thrill right I couldn't have
 

5067
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:11,950
greatest thrill right I couldn't have
asked for anything more uh than being

5068
01:46:11,950 --> 01:46:11,960
asked for anything more uh than being
 

5069
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:14,790
asked for anything more uh than being
involved in that Discovery so one so the

5070
01:46:14,790 --> 01:46:14,800
involved in that Discovery so one so the
 

5071
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:16,229
involved in that Discovery so one so the
the couple of teams of supernova

5072
01:46:16,229 --> 01:46:16,239
the couple of teams of supernova
 

5073
01:46:16,239 --> 01:46:18,589
the couple of teams of supernova
cosmology project and the high Supernova

5074
01:46:18,589 --> 01:46:18,599
cosmology project and the high Supernova
 

5075
01:46:18,599 --> 01:46:20,790
cosmology project and the high Supernova
search team so the what was the Nobel

5076
01:46:20,790 --> 01:46:20,800
search team so the what was the Nobel
 

5077
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:23,189
search team so the what was the Nobel
Prize given for it was given for the

5078
01:46:23,189 --> 01:46:23,199
Prize given for it was given for the
 

5079
01:46:23,199 --> 01:46:25,310
Prize given for it was given for the
discovery of the expansion of the

5080
01:46:25,310 --> 01:46:25,320
discovery of the expansion of the
 

5081
01:46:25,320 --> 01:46:27,669
discovery of the expansion of the
universe not for the elucidation of what

5082
01:46:27,669 --> 01:46:27,679
universe not for the elucidation of what
 

5083
01:46:27,679 --> 01:46:30,229
universe not for the elucidation of what
dark energy is or what causes that

5084
01:46:30,229 --> 01:46:30,239
dark energy is or what causes that
 

5085
01:46:30,239 --> 01:46:32,550
dark energy is or what causes that
expansion uh that acceleration be it

5086
01:46:32,550 --> 01:46:32,560
expansion uh that acceleration be it
 

5087
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:34,709
expansion uh that acceleration be it
universes on the outside or whatever it

5088
01:46:34,709 --> 01:46:34,719
universes on the outside or whatever it
 

5089
01:46:34,719 --> 01:46:36,950
universes on the outside or whatever it
was only for the observational fact so

5090
01:46:36,950 --> 01:46:36,960
was only for the observational fact so
 

5091
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:38,390
was only for the observational fact so
first of all what is the accelerating

5092
01:46:38,390 --> 01:46:38,400
first of all what is the accelerating
 

5093
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:40,510
first of all what is the accelerating
universe so the accelerating universe is

5094
01:46:40,510 --> 01:46:40,520
universe so the accelerating universe is
 

5095
01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:44,910
universe so the accelerating universe is
simply that if we look at the galaxies

5096
01:46:44,910 --> 01:46:44,920
simply that if we look at the galaxies
 

5097
01:46:44,920 --> 01:46:47,430
simply that if we look at the galaxies
moving away from us right now we would

5098
01:46:47,430 --> 01:46:47,440
moving away from us right now we would
 

5099
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:49,510
moving away from us right now we would
expect them to be moving away more

5100
01:46:49,510 --> 01:46:49,520
expect them to be moving away more
 

5101
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:52,390
expect them to be moving away more
slowly than they were billions of years

5102
01:46:52,390 --> 01:46:52,400
slowly than they were billions of years
 

5103
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:54,990
slowly than they were billions of years
ago and because Galaxies have visible

5104
01:46:54,990 --> 01:46:55,000
ago and because Galaxies have visible
 

5105
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,550
ago and because Galaxies have visible
matter which is gravitationally

5106
01:46:56,550 --> 01:46:56,560
matter which is gravitationally
 

5107
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:59,270
matter which is gravitationally
attractive and dark matter of an unknown

5108
01:46:59,270 --> 01:46:59,280
attractive and dark matter of an unknown
 

5109
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:01,830
attractive and dark matter of an unknown
sort that holds galaxies together and

5110
01:47:01,830 --> 01:47:01,840
sort that holds galaxies together and
 

5111
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:04,589
sort that holds galaxies together and
holds clusters of galaxies together and

5112
01:47:04,589 --> 01:47:04,599
holds clusters of galaxies together and
 

5113
01:47:04,599 --> 01:47:06,790
holds clusters of galaxies together and
of course they then pull on one another

5114
01:47:06,790 --> 01:47:06,800
of course they then pull on one another
 

5115
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:08,910
of course they then pull on one another
and they would tend to the

5116
01:47:08,910 --> 01:47:08,920
and they would tend to the
 

5117
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:11,030
and they would tend to the
expansion of the universe just as when I

5118
01:47:11,030 --> 01:47:11,040
expansion of the universe just as when I
 

5119
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:14,189
expansion of the universe just as when I
toss an apple up you know even ignoring

5120
01:47:14,189 --> 01:47:14,199
toss an apple up you know even ignoring
 

5121
01:47:14,199 --> 01:47:16,790
toss an apple up you know even ignoring
air resistance the mutual gravitational

5122
01:47:16,790 --> 01:47:16,800
air resistance the mutual gravitational
 

5123
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:18,629
air resistance the mutual gravitational
attraction between Earth and the Apple

5124
01:47:18,629 --> 01:47:18,639
attraction between Earth and the Apple
 

5125
01:47:18,639 --> 01:47:20,830
attraction between Earth and the Apple
slows the Apple down and if that

5126
01:47:20,830 --> 01:47:20,840
slows the Apple down and if that
 

5127
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:22,229
slows the Apple down and if that
attraction is great enough then the

5128
01:47:22,229 --> 01:47:22,239
attraction is great enough then the
 

5129
01:47:22,239 --> 01:47:24,669
attraction is great enough then the
Apple will they stop and even come back

5130
01:47:24,669 --> 01:47:24,679
Apple will they stop and even come back
 

5131
01:47:24,679 --> 01:47:26,310
Apple will they stop and even come back
the Big Crunch you could call it or the

5132
01:47:26,310 --> 01:47:26,320
the Big Crunch you could call it or the
 

5133
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:28,430
the Big Crunch you could call it or the
gnab Gibb which is Big Bang backwards

5134
01:47:28,430 --> 01:47:28,440
gnab Gibb which is Big Bang backwards
 

5135
01:47:28,440 --> 01:47:29,870
gnab Gibb which is Big Bang backwards
right that's what could have happened to

5136
01:47:29,870 --> 01:47:29,880
right that's what could have happened to
 

5137
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:32,149
right that's what could have happened to
the universe but even if the universe's

5138
01:47:32,149 --> 01:47:32,159
the universe but even if the universe's
 

5139
01:47:32,159 --> 01:47:35,510
the universe but even if the universe's
original expansion energy was so great

5140
01:47:35,510 --> 01:47:35,520
original expansion energy was so great
 

5141
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:37,470
original expansion energy was so great
that it avoids the Big Crunch that's

5142
01:47:37,470 --> 01:47:37,480
that it avoids the Big Crunch that's
 

5143
01:47:37,480 --> 01:47:39,350
that it avoids the Big Crunch that's
like an apple thrown at Earth's escape

5144
01:47:39,350 --> 01:47:39,360
like an apple thrown at Earth's escape
 

5145
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:41,550
like an apple thrown at Earth's escape
speed it's like that the the the the

5146
01:47:41,550 --> 01:47:41,560
speed it's like that the the the the
 

5147
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:43,910
speed it's like that the the the the
rockets that go to Mars someday right

5148
01:47:43,910 --> 01:47:43,920
rockets that go to Mars someday right
 

5149
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:45,870
rockets that go to Mars someday right
you know uh with

5150
01:47:45,870 --> 01:47:45,880
you know uh with
 

5151
01:47:45,880 --> 01:47:47,990
you know uh with
people even then you'd expect the

5152
01:47:47,990 --> 01:47:48,000
people even then you'd expect the
 

5153
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,669
people even then you'd expect the
universe to be slowing down with time

5154
01:47:50,669 --> 01:47:50,679
universe to be slowing down with time
 

5155
01:47:50,679 --> 01:47:53,149
universe to be slowing down with time
but we looked back through through the

5156
01:47:53,149 --> 01:47:53,159
but we looked back through through the
 

5157
01:47:53,159 --> 01:47:54,790
but we looked back through through the
history of the universe by looking at

5158
01:47:54,790 --> 01:47:54,800
history of the universe by looking at
 

5159
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:57,950
history of the universe by looking at
progressively more distant galaxies and

5160
01:47:57,950 --> 01:47:57,960
progressively more distant galaxies and
 

5161
01:47:57,960 --> 01:48:02,830
progressively more distant galaxies and
by seeing that the evolution of this

5162
01:48:02,830 --> 01:48:02,840
by seeing that the evolution of this
 

5163
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:06,310
by seeing that the evolution of this
expansion rate is that in the first N9

5164
01:48:06,310 --> 01:48:06,320
expansion rate is that in the first N9
 

5165
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:09,149
expansion rate is that in the first N9
billion years yeah it was slowing down

5166
01:48:09,149 --> 01:48:09,159
billion years yeah it was slowing down
 

5167
01:48:09,159 --> 01:48:11,790
billion years yeah it was slowing down
but in the last five billion years it's

5168
01:48:11,790 --> 01:48:11,800
but in the last five billion years it's
 

5169
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:14,990
but in the last five billion years it's
been speeding up so who asked for that

5170
01:48:14,990 --> 01:48:15,000
been speeding up so who asked for that
 

5171
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,709
been speeding up so who asked for that
right you know um I think it's

5172
01:48:17,709 --> 01:48:17,719
right you know um I think it's
 

5173
01:48:17,719 --> 01:48:19,350
right you know um I think it's
interesting to talk about a little bit

5174
01:48:19,350 --> 01:48:19,360
interesting to talk about a little bit
 

5175
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:21,669
interesting to talk about a little bit
of the human story of the Nobel Prize

5176
01:48:21,669 --> 01:48:21,679
of the human story of the Nobel Prize
 

5177
01:48:21,679 --> 01:48:23,430
of the human story of the Nobel Prize
sure which is

5178
01:48:23,430 --> 01:48:23,440
sure which is
 

5179
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:26,229
sure which is
I mean fascinating it's a really first

5180
01:48:26,229 --> 01:48:26,239
I mean fascinating it's a really first
 

5181
01:48:26,239 --> 01:48:28,229
I mean fascinating it's a really first
of all the prize itself it's kind of

5182
01:48:28,229 --> 01:48:28,239
of all the prize itself it's kind of
 

5183
01:48:28,239 --> 01:48:30,470
of all the prize itself it's kind of
fascinating in the psychological level

5184
01:48:30,470 --> 01:48:30,480
fascinating in the psychological level
 

5185
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:33,750
fascinating in the psychological level
that uh prizes uh I know we kind of

5186
01:48:33,750 --> 01:48:33,760
that uh prizes uh I know we kind of
 

5187
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:35,390
that uh prizes uh I know we kind of
think that prizes don't matter but

5188
01:48:35,390 --> 01:48:35,400
think that prizes don't matter but
 

5189
01:48:35,400 --> 01:48:37,550
think that prizes don't matter but
somehow they kind of focus the mind

5190
01:48:37,550 --> 01:48:37,560
somehow they kind of focus the mind
 

5191
01:48:37,560 --> 01:48:39,470
somehow they kind of focus the mind
about some of the most special things we

5192
01:48:39,470 --> 01:48:39,480
about some of the most special things we
 

5193
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:42,149
about some of the most special things we
have ACC the recognition the funding you

5194
01:48:42,149 --> 01:48:42,159
have ACC the recognition the funding you
 

5195
01:48:42,159 --> 01:48:45,550
have ACC the recognition the funding you
know but and also inspiration for like I

5196
01:48:45,550 --> 01:48:45,560
know but and also inspiration for like I
 

5197
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:47,149
know but and also inspiration for like I
said when I was a little kid they get

5198
01:48:47,149 --> 01:48:47,159
said when I was a little kid they get
 

5199
01:48:47,159 --> 01:48:49,709
said when I was a little kid they get
The Nobel Prize like I I didn't you know

5200
01:48:49,709 --> 01:48:49,719
The Nobel Prize like I I didn't you know
 

5201
01:48:49,719 --> 01:48:53,510
The Nobel Prize like I I didn't you know
it inspires millions of young scientists

5202
01:48:53,510 --> 01:48:53,520
it inspires millions of young scientists
 

5203
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:55,709
it inspires millions of young scientists
at the same time there's a sadness to it

5204
01:48:55,709 --> 01:48:55,719
at the same time there's a sadness to it
 

5205
01:48:55,719 --> 01:48:58,629
at the same time there's a sadness to it
a little bit that uh especially in the

5206
01:48:58,629 --> 01:48:58,639
a little bit that uh especially in the
 

5207
01:48:58,639 --> 01:49:00,750
a little bit that uh especially in the
field like depending on the field but

5208
01:49:00,750 --> 01:49:00,760
field like depending on the field but
 

5209
01:49:00,760 --> 01:49:02,709
field like depending on the field but
experimental fields that involve teams

5210
01:49:02,709 --> 01:49:02,719
experimental fields that involve teams
 

5211
01:49:02,719 --> 01:49:05,350
experimental fields that involve teams
of I don't know sometimes hundreds I

5212
01:49:05,350 --> 01:49:05,360
of I don't know sometimes hundreds I
 

5213
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:07,589
of I don't know sometimes hundreds I
mean of brilliant

5214
01:49:07,589 --> 01:49:07,599
mean of brilliant
 

5215
01:49:07,599 --> 01:49:10,270
mean of brilliant
people the Nobel Prize is only given to

5216
01:49:10,270 --> 01:49:10,280
people the Nobel Prize is only given to
 

5217
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:13,550
people the Nobel Prize is only given to
just a handful I that's right is it Ma

5218
01:49:13,550 --> 01:49:13,560
just a handful I that's right is it Ma
 

5219
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:16,229
just a handful I that's right is it Ma
Max a three yeah yeah and it's not even

5220
01:49:16,229 --> 01:49:16,239
Max a three yeah yeah and it's not even
 

5221
01:49:16,239 --> 01:49:18,510
Max a three yeah yeah and it's not even
written in Alfred nobel's will it turns

5222
01:49:18,510 --> 01:49:18,520
written in Alfred nobel's will it turns
 

5223
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:21,070
written in Alfred nobel's will it turns
out one of our teammates looked into it

5224
01:49:21,070 --> 01:49:21,080
out one of our teammates looked into it
 

5225
01:49:21,080 --> 01:49:23,189
out one of our teammates looked into it
in a museum in Stockholm when we went

5226
01:49:23,189 --> 01:49:23,199
in a museum in Stockholm when we went
 

5227
01:49:23,199 --> 01:49:26,070
in a museum in Stockholm when we went
there for Nobel week in 2011 the the

5228
01:49:26,070 --> 01:49:26,080
there for Nobel week in 2011 the the
 

5229
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:28,790
there for Nobel week in 2011 the the
leaders who got the prize formally knew

5230
01:49:28,790 --> 01:49:28,800
leaders who got the prize formally knew
 

5231
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:30,310
leaders who got the prize formally knew
that without the rest of us working hard

5232
01:49:30,310 --> 01:49:30,320
that without the rest of us working hard
 

5233
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:32,990
that without the rest of us working hard
in the trenches the result would not

5234
01:49:32,990 --> 01:49:33,000
in the trenches the result would not
 

5235
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,229
in the trenches the result would not
have you know been discovered so they

5236
01:49:35,229 --> 01:49:35,239
have you know been discovered so they
 

5237
01:49:35,239 --> 01:49:37,430
have you know been discovered so they
invited us to participate in Nobel week

5238
01:49:37,430 --> 01:49:37,440
invited us to participate in Nobel week
 

5239
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:39,229
invited us to participate in Nobel week
and so one of the team members looked in

5240
01:49:39,229 --> 01:49:39,239
and so one of the team members looked in
 

5241
01:49:39,239 --> 01:49:41,629
and so one of the team members looked in
the will and it's not there it's just

5242
01:49:41,629 --> 01:49:41,639
the will and it's not there it's just
 

5243
01:49:41,639 --> 01:49:43,990
the will and it's not there it's just
tradition that's but it's archaic you

5244
01:49:43,990 --> 01:49:44,000
tradition that's but it's archaic you
 

5245
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,870
tradition that's but it's archaic you
know that's the way science used to be

5246
01:49:45,870 --> 01:49:45,880
know that's the way science used to be
 

5247
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:48,109
know that's the way science used to be
done and it's not the way a lot of

5248
01:49:48,109 --> 01:49:48,119
done and it's not the way a lot of
 

5249
01:49:48,119 --> 01:49:50,229
done and it's not the way a lot of
science is done now and you look at

5250
01:49:50,229 --> 01:49:50,239
science is done now and you look at
 

5251
01:49:50,239 --> 01:49:53,310
science is done now and you look at
gravitational wave discovery which was

5252
01:49:53,310 --> 01:49:53,320
gravitational wave discovery which was
 

5253
01:49:53,320 --> 01:49:55,070
gravitational wave discovery which was
you know recognized with the Nobel Prize

5254
01:49:55,070 --> 01:49:55,080
you know recognized with the Nobel Prize
 

5255
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:58,910
you know recognized with the Nobel Prize
in 2017 Ray weet MIT got it and Kip

5256
01:49:58,910 --> 01:49:58,920
in 2017 Ray weet MIT got it and Kip
 

5257
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:02,629
in 2017 Ray weet MIT got it and Kip
Thorne and um and um Barry beish at

5258
01:50:02,629 --> 01:50:02,639
Thorne and um and um Barry beish at
 

5259
01:50:02,639 --> 01:50:04,830
Thorne and um and um Barry beish at
Caltech and Ron DAV one of the

5260
01:50:04,830 --> 01:50:04,840
Caltech and Ron DAV one of the
 

5261
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:07,070
Caltech and Ron DAV one of the
masterminds had passed away earlier in

5262
01:50:07,070 --> 01:50:07,080
masterminds had passed away earlier in
 

5263
01:50:07,080 --> 01:50:09,990
masterminds had passed away earlier in
the year so again one of the rules of

5264
01:50:09,990 --> 01:50:10,000
the year so again one of the rules of
 

5265
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,629
the year so again one of the rules of
Nobel is that it's not given pusle yeah

5266
01:50:12,629 --> 01:50:12,639
Nobel is that it's not given pusle yeah
 

5267
01:50:12,639 --> 01:50:14,830
Nobel is that it's not given pusle yeah
or at least the one exception might be

5268
01:50:14,830 --> 01:50:14,840
or at least the one exception might be
 

5269
01:50:14,840 --> 01:50:16,229
or at least the one exception might be
if they've made their decision and

5270
01:50:16,229 --> 01:50:16,239
if they've made their decision and
 

5271
01:50:16,239 --> 01:50:19,310
if they've made their decision and
they're busy making their press releases

5272
01:50:19,310 --> 01:50:19,320
they're busy making their press releases
 

5273
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:21,149
they're busy making their press releases
right before October the first week in

5274
01:50:21,149 --> 01:50:21,159
right before October the first week in
 

5275
01:50:21,159 --> 01:50:23,510
right before October the first week in
October or whatever and then the person

5276
01:50:23,510 --> 01:50:23,520
October or whatever and then the person
 

5277
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:24,990
October or whatever and then the person
passes away I think they don't change

5278
01:50:24,990 --> 01:50:25,000
passes away I think they don't change
 

5279
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:28,589
passes away I think they don't change
their minds then but yeah you know it it

5280
01:50:28,589 --> 01:50:28,599
their minds then but yeah you know it it
 

5281
01:50:28,599 --> 01:50:31,149
their minds then but yeah you know it it
it doesn't square with today's reality

5282
01:50:31,149 --> 01:50:31,159
it doesn't square with today's reality
 

5283
01:50:31,159 --> 01:50:33,109
it doesn't square with today's reality
that a lot of science is done by big

5284
01:50:33,109 --> 01:50:33,119
that a lot of science is done by big
 

5285
01:50:33,119 --> 01:50:34,990
that a lot of science is done by big
teams in that case a team of a thousand

5286
01:50:34,990 --> 01:50:35,000
teams in that case a team of a thousand
 

5287
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,510
teams in that case a team of a thousand
people in our case it was two teams

5288
01:50:37,510 --> 01:50:37,520
people in our case it was two teams
 

5289
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:40,390
people in our case it was two teams
consisting of about 50 people and we

5290
01:50:40,390 --> 01:50:40,400
consisting of about 50 people and we
 

5291
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:42,910
consisting of about 50 people and we
used techniques that were arguably

5292
01:50:42,910 --> 01:50:42,920
used techniques that were arguably
 

5293
01:50:42,920 --> 01:50:45,310
used techniques that were arguably
developed in part by people who

5294
01:50:45,310 --> 01:50:45,320
developed in part by people who
 

5295
01:50:45,320 --> 01:50:47,430
developed in part by people who
astrophysicists who weren't even on

5296
01:50:47,430 --> 01:50:47,440
astrophysicists who weren't even on
 

5297
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:49,510
astrophysicists who weren't even on
those two papers I mean some of them

5298
01:50:49,510 --> 01:50:49,520
those two papers I mean some of them
 

5299
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:51,910
those two papers I mean some of them
were but other papers were written by by

5300
01:50:51,910 --> 01:50:51,920
were but other papers were written by by
 

5301
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:53,750
were but other papers were written by by
other people you know know and so it's

5302
01:50:53,750 --> 01:50:53,760
other people you know know and so it's
 

5303
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:55,390
other people you know know and so it's
like we're standing on the shoulders of

5304
01:50:55,390 --> 01:50:55,400
like we're standing on the shoulders of
 

5305
01:50:55,400 --> 01:50:57,910
like we're standing on the shoulders of
giants and none of those people was

5306
01:50:57,910 --> 01:50:57,920
giants and none of those people was
 

5307
01:50:57,920 --> 01:51:01,310
giants and none of those people was
officially recognized and to me it was

5308
01:51:01,310 --> 01:51:01,320
officially recognized and to me it was
 

5309
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:03,390
officially recognized and to me it was
okay you know again it was the thrill of

5310
01:51:03,390 --> 01:51:03,400
okay you know again it was the thrill of
 

5311
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:05,870
okay you know again it was the thrill of
doing the work and ultimately the work

5312
01:51:05,870 --> 01:51:05,880
doing the work and ultimately the work
 

5313
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:07,709
doing the work and ultimately the work
the discovery was recognized with the

5314
01:51:07,709 --> 01:51:07,719
the discovery was recognized with the
 

5315
01:51:07,719 --> 01:51:09,990
the discovery was recognized with the
prize and you know we got to participate

5316
01:51:09,990 --> 01:51:10,000
prize and you know we got to participate
 

5317
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:13,430
prize and you know we got to participate
in Nobel week and you know it's okay

5318
01:51:13,430 --> 01:51:13,440
in Nobel week and you know it's okay
 

5319
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:16,390
in Nobel week and you know it's okay
with me I I've known other physicists

5320
01:51:16,390 --> 01:51:16,400
with me I I've known other physicists
 

5321
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:19,470
with me I I've known other physicists
whose lives were ruined because they did

5322
01:51:19,470 --> 01:51:19,480
whose lives were ruined because they did
 

5323
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:22,189
whose lives were ruined because they did
not get the Nobel Prize and they felt

5324
01:51:22,189 --> 01:51:22,199
not get the Nobel Prize and they felt
 

5325
01:51:22,199 --> 01:51:24,790
not get the Nobel Prize and they felt
strongly that they should have Ralph

5326
01:51:24,790 --> 01:51:24,800
strongly that they should have Ralph
 

5327
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:27,550
strongly that they should have Ralph

you well you know there were the two

5356
01:52:02,310 --> 01:52:02,320
you well you know there were the two
 

5357
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:04,430
you well you know there were the two

01:52:12,470 --> 01:52:12,480
author I guess yeah first author I was
 

5367
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:14,750
author I guess yeah first author I was
second author of that paper yeah uh so I

was his direct Mentor at the time
 

5371
01:52:16,280 --> 01:52:17,550
was his direct Mentor at the time
although he was you know one of these

5372
01:52:17,550 --> 01:52:17,560
although he was you know one of these
 

5373
01:52:17,560 --> 01:52:19,550
although he was you know one of these
people who just you know runs with

84 to 86 but you're you're you know

5386
01:52:34,030 --> 01:52:34,040
84 to 86 but you're you're you know
 

5387
01:52:34,040 --> 01:52:36,310
84 to 86 but you're you're you know
you're largely a free agent but he

5388
01:52:36,310 --> 01:52:36,320
you're largely a free agent but he
 

5389
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:38,149
you're largely a free agent but he
worked quite closely with me and he came

5390
01:52:38,149 --> 01:52:38,159
worked quite closely with me and he came
 

5391
01:52:38,159 --> 01:52:39,990
worked quite closely with me and he came
to Burkle to work with me and on

5392
01:52:39,990 --> 01:52:40,000
to Burkle to work with me and on
 

5393

Schmidt's team he was charged with

5394
01:52:42,430 --> 01:52:42,440
Schmidt's team he was charged with
 

5395
01:52:42,440 --> 01:52:44,990
Schmidt's team he was charged with
analyzing the data and he measured the

5396
01:52:44,990 --> 01:52:45,000
analyzing the data and he measured the
 

5397
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,750
analyzing the data and he measured the
brightnesses of these distant supern noi

5398
01:52:47,750 --> 01:52:47,760
brightnesses of these distant supern noi
 

5399
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:49,550
brightnesses of these distant supern noi
showing that they're fainter and thus

5400
01:52:49,550 --> 01:52:49,560
showing that they're fainter and thus
 

5401
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:51,669
showing that they're fainter and thus
more distant than anticipated and that

5402
01:52:51,669 --> 01:52:51,679
more distant than anticipated and that
 

5403
01:52:51,679 --> 01:52:54,189
more distant than anticipated and that
led to this conclusion that the Universe

5404
01:52:54,189 --> 01:52:54,199
led to this conclusion that the Universe
 

5405
01:52:54,199 --> 01:52:56,270
led to this conclusion that the Universe
had to have accelerated in order to push

5406
01:52:56,270 --> 01:52:56,280
had to have accelerated in order to push
 

5407
01:52:56,280 --> 01:52:58,669
had to have accelerated in order to push
them out to such great distances and I

5408
01:52:58,669 --> 01:52:58,679
them out to such great distances and I
 

5409
01:52:58,679 --> 01:53:01,390
them out to such great distances and I
was shocked when he showed me the data

5410
01:53:01,390 --> 01:53:01,400
was shocked when he showed me the data
 

5411
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:03,229
was shocked when he showed me the data
the results of his calculations and

5412
01:53:03,229 --> 01:53:03,239
the results of his calculations and
 

5413
01:53:03,239 --> 01:53:05,750
the results of his calculations and
measurements um but it's very you know

5414
01:53:05,750 --> 01:53:05,760
measurements um but it's very you know
 

5415
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:09,149
measurements um but it's very you know
so he deserved it but and on Sal G gon g

5416
01:53:09,149 --> 01:53:09,159
so he deserved it but and on Sal G gon g
 

5417
01:53:09,159 --> 01:53:11,030
so he deserved it but and on Sal G gon g
gold hobber deserved it but he died I

5418
01:53:11,030 --> 01:53:11,040
gold hobber deserved it but he died I
 

5419
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:13,270
gold hobber deserved it but he died I
think a year earlier in 2010 but that

5420
01:53:13,270 --> 01:53:13,280
think a year earlier in 2010 but that
 

5421
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:15,990
think a year earlier in 2010 but that
would have been four and

5422
01:53:15,990 --> 01:53:16,000
would have been four and
 

5423
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,550
would have been four and
so and me well I was on both teams but

5424
01:53:19,550 --> 01:53:19,560
so and me well I was on both teams but
 

5425
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:21,669
so and me well I was on both teams but
you know was I number four five six

5426
01:53:21,669 --> 01:53:21,679
you know was I number four five six
 

5427
01:53:21,679 --> 01:53:23,589
you know was I number four five six
seven I don't know well it's it's also

5428
01:53:23,589 --> 01:53:23,599
seven I don't know well it's it's also
 

5429
01:53:23,599 --> 01:53:26,750
seven I don't know well it's it's also
very so if I were to it's possible that

5430
01:53:26,750 --> 01:53:26,760
very so if I were to it's possible that
 

5431
01:53:26,760 --> 01:53:28,910
very so if I were to it's possible that
you're I mean I I could make a very good

5432
01:53:28,910 --> 01:53:28,920
you're I mean I I could make a very good
 

5433
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:32,790
you're I mean I I could make a very good
case for you're in in the three and does

5434
01:53:32,790 --> 01:53:32,800
case for you're in in the three and does
 

5435
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:35,189
case for you're in in the three and does
thaty kind you know so but is that

5436
01:53:35,189 --> 01:53:35,199
thaty kind you know so but is that
 

5437
01:53:35,199 --> 01:53:37,390
thaty kind you know so but is that
psychologically I mean listen it weighs

5438
01:53:37,390 --> 01:53:37,400
psychologically I mean listen it weighs
 

5439
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:40,430
psychologically I mean listen it weighs
on me a little bit because I yeah

5440
01:53:40,430 --> 01:53:40,440
on me a little bit because I yeah
 

5441
01:53:40,440 --> 01:53:43,310
on me a little bit because I yeah
I I don't know what to do with that it

5442
01:53:43,310 --> 01:53:43,320
I I don't know what to do with that it
 

5443
01:53:43,320 --> 01:53:45,830
I I don't know what to do with that it
it U perhaps it should

5444
01:53:45,830 --> 01:53:45,840
it U perhaps it should
 

5445
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:48,990
it U perhaps it should
motivate uh the rethinking like Time

5446
01:53:48,990 --> 01:53:49,000
motivate uh the rethinking like Time
 

5447
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,270
motivate uh the rethinking like Time
magazine started doing like you know

5448
01:53:51,270 --> 01:53:51,280
magazine started doing like you know
 

5449
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:53,589
magazine started doing like you know
person of the year yeah and like they

5450
01:53:53,589 --> 01:53:53,599
person of the year yeah and like they
 

5451
01:53:53,599 --> 01:53:55,709
person of the year yeah and like they
they would start doing like Concepts and

5452
01:53:55,709 --> 01:53:55,719
they would start doing like Concepts and
 

5453
01:53:55,719 --> 01:53:57,430
they would start doing like Concepts and
almost like the black hole gets the

5454
01:53:57,430 --> 01:53:57,440
almost like the black hole gets the
 

5455
01:53:57,440 --> 01:53:59,470
almost like the black hole gets the
Nobel Prize

5456
01:53:59,470 --> 01:53:59,480
Nobel Prize
 

5457
01:53:59,480 --> 01:54:01,950
Nobel Prize
or Universe gets the Nobel Prize and

5458
01:54:01,950 --> 01:54:01,960
or Universe gets the Nobel Prize and
 

5459
01:54:01,960 --> 01:54:04,589
or Universe gets the Nobel Prize and
here's the list of people so like ult or

5460
01:54:04,589 --> 01:54:04,599
here's the list of people so like ult or
 

5461
01:54:04,599 --> 01:54:08,109
here's the list of people so like ult or
like the Oscar that you could say yeah

5462
01:54:08,109 --> 01:54:08,119
like the Oscar that you could say yeah
 

5463
01:54:08,119 --> 01:54:10,830
like the Oscar that you could say yeah
because it it's a team effort now you

5464
01:54:10,830 --> 01:54:10,840
because it it's a team effort now you
 

5465
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:12,790
because it it's a team effort now you
know and it should be redone and the

5466
01:54:12,790 --> 01:54:12,800
know and it should be redone and the
 

5467
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:14,470
know and it should be redone and the

well you know uh they recogniz a larger

5474
01:54:21,270 --> 01:54:21,280
well you know uh they recogniz a larger
 

5475
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:24,430
well you know uh they recogniz a larger
team yeah they they recognized teams and

5476
01:54:24,430 --> 01:54:24,440
team yeah they they recognized teams and
 

5477
01:54:24,440 --> 01:54:25,950
team yeah they they recognized teams and
so in fact both teams in the

5478
01:54:25,950 --> 01:54:25,960
so in fact both teams in the
 

5479
01:54:25,960 --> 01:54:28,149
so in fact both teams in the
accelerating universe were recognized

5480
01:54:28,149 --> 01:54:28,159
accelerating universe were recognized
 

5481
01:54:28,159 --> 01:54:32,069
accelerating universe were recognized
with the Breakthrough prize in 2015

people argue that the Nobel Prize has

01:55:26,470 --> 01:55:26,480
people argue that the Nobel Prize has
 

5529
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:28,550
people argue that the Nobel Prize has
been deluded to because if you look at

5530
01:55:28,550 --> 01:55:28,560
been deluded to because if you look at
 

5531
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:31,030
been deluded to because if you look at
Roger Penrose you can make an argument

5532
01:55:31,030 --> 01:55:31,040
Roger Penrose you can make an argument
 

5533
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:33,550
Roger Penrose you can make an argument
that he should get the prize by himself

5534
01:55:33,550 --> 01:55:33,560
that he should get the prize by himself
 

5535
01:55:33,560 --> 01:55:36,229
that he should get the prize by himself
like it's she separate those like could

5536
01:55:36,229 --> 01:55:36,239
like it's she separate those like could
 

5537
01:55:36,239 --> 01:55:37,629
like it's she separate those like could
have and should have perhaps he should

5538
01:55:37,629 --> 01:55:37,639
have and should have perhaps he should
 

5539
01:55:37,639 --> 01:55:39,589
have and should have perhaps he should
have perhaps gotten it with Hawking

5540
01:55:39,589 --> 01:55:39,599
have perhaps gotten it with Hawking
 

5541
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:42,229
have perhaps gotten it with Hawking
before Hawking's death right the problem

5542
01:55:42,229 --> 01:55:42,239
before Hawking's death right the problem
 

5543
01:55:42,239 --> 01:55:44,270
before Hawking's death right the problem
was Hawking radiation had not been

5544
01:55:44,270 --> 01:55:44,280
was Hawking radiation had not been
 

5545
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:45,950
was Hawking radiation had not been
detected but you could argue that

5546
01:55:45,950 --> 01:55:45,960
detected but you could argue that
 

5547
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:48,550
detected but you could argue that
Hawking made enough other fundamental

01:55:56,760 --> 01:55:58,669
were already good enough at the time of
before Hawking's death okay I mean the

5556
01:55:58,669 --> 01:55:58,679
before Hawking's death okay I mean the
 

5557
01:55:58,679 --> 01:56:00,550
before Hawking's death okay I mean the
latest results by Reinhardt gel's group

latest results by Reinhardt gel's group
 

5559
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:02,750
latest results by Reinhardt gel's group
is that they see the time dilation

5560
01:56:02,750 --> 01:56:02,760
is that they see the time dilation
 

5561
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:04,910
is that they see the time dilation

5576
01:56:20,109 --> 01:56:20,119
relativistic effect and yet she got part
 

5577
01:56:20,119 --> 01:56:22,390
relativistic effect and yet she got part
of the prize as well so clearly it was

5578
01:56:22,390 --> 01:56:22,400
of the prize as well so clearly it was
 

5579
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:24,830
of the prize as well so clearly it was
given for the the original evidence that

5580
01:56:24,830 --> 01:56:24,840
given for the the original evidence that
 

5581
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:26,669
given for the the original evidence that
was really good and that evidence is at

01:56:26,669 --> 01:56:26,679
was really good and that evidence is at
 

5583
01:56:26,679 --> 01:56:29,189
was really good and that evidence is at
least a decade old you know so one could

01:56:29,189 --> 01:56:29,199
least a decade old you know so one could
 

5585
01:56:29,199 --> 01:56:32,510
least a decade old you know so one could
make the case for for Hawking um one

5586
01:56:32,510 --> 01:56:32,520
make the case for for Hawking um one
 

5587
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:35,430
make the case for for Hawking um one
could make the case that in 2016 when

1992 three years preceding 1995 found a
 

5599
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:56,229
1992 three years preceding 1995 found a
a p a planet orbiting a pulsar a very

5600
01:56:56,229 --> 01:56:56,239
a p a planet orbiting a pulsar a very
 

5601
01:56:56,239 --> 01:56:58,030
a p a planet orbiting a pulsar a very
weird kind of star a neutron star and

5602
01:56:58,030 --> 01:56:58,040
weird kind of star a neutron star and
 

5603
01:56:58,040 --> 01:57:00,270
weird kind of star a neutron star and
that wouldn't have been a normal Planet

5604
01:57:00,270 --> 01:57:00,280
that wouldn't have been a normal Planet
 

5605
01:57:00,280 --> 01:57:03,430
that wouldn't have been a normal Planet
sure and so the Nobel committee you know

5606
01:57:03,430 --> 01:57:03,440
sure and so the Nobel committee you know
 

5607
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:05,109
sure and so the Nobel committee you know
they gave it for the discovery of

5608
01:57:05,109 --> 01:57:05,119
they gave it for the discovery of
 

5609
01:57:05,119 --> 01:57:08,350
they gave it for the discovery of
planets around normal sunlike stars but

5610
01:57:08,350 --> 01:57:08,360
planets around normal sunlike stars but
 

5611
01:57:08,360 --> 01:57:10,910
planets around normal sunlike stars but
but hell you know Wan found a planet so

5612
01:57:10,910 --> 01:57:10,920
but hell you know Wan found a planet so
 

5613
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:12,350
but hell you know Wan found a planet so
they could have given it to him as the

5614
01:57:12,350 --> 01:57:12,360
they could have given it to him as the
 

5615
01:57:12,360 --> 01:57:15,390
they could have given it to him as the
third person instead of to Jim Peebles

5616
01:57:15,390 --> 01:57:15,400
third person instead of to Jim Peebles
 

5617
01:57:15,400 --> 01:57:16,830
third person instead of to Jim Peebles
for the development of what's called

5618
01:57:16,830 --> 01:57:16,840
for the development of what's called
 

5619
01:57:16,840 --> 01:57:19,270
for the development of what's called
physical cosmology he's at Princeton he

5620
01:57:19,270 --> 01:57:19,280
physical cosmology he's at Princeton he
 

5621
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:21,270
physical cosmology he's at Princeton he
deserved it but they could have given

5622
01:57:21,270 --> 01:57:21,280
deserved it but they could have given
 

5623
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:23,430
deserved it but they could have given
Nobel for the development of physical

5624
01:57:23,430 --> 01:57:23,440
Nobel for the development of physical
 

5625
01:57:23,440 --> 01:57:26,629
Nobel for the development of physical
cosmology to pees and I would claim some

5626
01:57:26,629 --> 01:57:26,639
cosmology to pees and I would claim some
 

5627
01:57:26,639 --> 01:57:28,030
cosmology to pees and I would claim some
other people were pretty important in

5628
01:57:28,030 --> 01:57:28,040
other people were pretty important in
 

5629
01:57:28,040 --> 01:57:29,669
other people were pretty important in
that development as well you know and

5630
01:57:29,669 --> 01:57:29,679
that development as well you know and
 

5631
01:57:29,679 --> 01:57:31,669
that development as well you know and
they could have given it some other year

5632
01:57:31,669 --> 01:57:31,679
they could have given it some other year
 

5633
01:57:31,679 --> 01:57:34,109
they could have given it some other year
um so there's there's a lot of

5634
01:57:34,109 --> 01:57:34,119
um so there's there's a lot of
 

5635
01:57:34,119 --> 01:57:36,589
um so there's there's a lot of
controversy I try not to dwell on it was

5636
01:57:36,589 --> 01:57:36,599
controversy I try not to dwell on it was
 

5637
01:57:36,599 --> 01:57:38,310
controversy I try not to dwell on it was
I number three probably not you know

5638
01:57:38,310 --> 01:57:38,320
I number three probably not you know
 

5639
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:41,390
I number three probably not you know
Adam Reese did the work um you know I

5640
01:57:41,390 --> 01:57:41,400
Adam Reese did the work um you know I
 

5641
01:57:41,400 --> 01:57:44,270
Adam Reese did the work um you know I
helped bounce ideas off of him but it we

5642
01:57:44,270 --> 01:57:44,280
helped bounce ideas off of him but it we
 

5643
01:57:44,280 --> 01:57:46,629
helped bounce ideas off of him but it we
wouldn't have had the result without him

5644
01:57:46,629 --> 01:57:46,639
wouldn't have had the result without him
 

5645
01:57:46,639 --> 01:57:50,310
wouldn't have had the result without him
yeah and I was on both teams for reasons

5646
01:57:50,310 --> 01:57:50,320
yeah and I was on both teams for reasons
 

5647
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:52,790
yeah and I was on both teams for reasons
I mean you know I the the St of the

5648
01:57:52,790 --> 01:57:52,800
I mean you know I the the St of the
 

5649
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:54,430
I mean you know I the the St of the
first team the Supernova cosmology

project didn't match mine they came

5652
01:57:56,669 --> 01:57:56,679
project didn't match mine they came
 

5653
01:57:56,679 --> 01:57:58,390

these hierarchical teams and stuff and

5658
01:58:02,310 --> 01:58:02,320
these hierarchical teams and stuff and
 

5659
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:04,470
these hierarchical teams and stuff and
it's hard for the little guy to to have

5660
01:58:04,470 --> 01:58:04,480
it's hard for the little guy to to have
 

5661
01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:06,109
it's hard for the little guy to to have
a say at least that's what I kind of

5662
01:58:06,109 --> 01:58:06,119
a say at least that's what I kind of
 

5663
01:58:06,119 --> 01:58:08,910
a say at least that's what I kind of
thought whereas the team of astronomers

5664
01:58:08,910 --> 01:58:08,920
thought whereas the team of astronomers
 

5665
01:58:08,920 --> 01:58:11,229
thought whereas the team of astronomers
led by Brian Schmidt was first of all a

01:58:11,229 --> 01:58:11,239
led by Brian Schmidt was first of all a
 

5667
01:58:11,239 --> 01:58:14,270

01:58:14,270 --> 01:58:14,280
bunch of my friends and they grew up as
 

5669
01:58:14,280 --> 01:58:16,149
bunch of my friends and they grew up as
astronomers making contributions on

5670
01:58:16,149 --> 01:58:16,159
astronomers making contributions on
 

5671
01:58:16,159 --> 01:58:17,910

little teams and we decided to band

5672
01:58:17,910 --> 01:58:17,920
little teams and we decided to band
 

5673
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:19,589
little teams and we decided to band
together but all of us had our voices

5674
01:58:19,589 --> 01:58:19,599
together but all of us had our voices
 

5675
01:58:19,599 --> 01:58:22,629
together but all of us had our voices
heard so it was sort of a a culture a

5676
01:58:22,629 --> 01:58:22,639
heard so it was sort of a a culture a
 

5677
01:58:22,639 --> 01:58:25,950
heard so it was sort of a a culture a

drawn out Nobel ceremony right and I got

5694
01:58:45,430 --> 01:58:45,440
drawn out Nobel ceremony right and I got
 

5695
01:58:45,440 --> 01:58:47,550
drawn out Nobel ceremony right and I got
them to be pretty talkative and then in

5696

a in a polite diplomatic way I started
 

5699
01:58:50,159 --> 01:58:52,990
a in a polite diplomatic way I started
asking them pointed questions m M and

5700
01:58:52,990 --> 01:58:53,000
asking them pointed questions m M and
 

5701
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:54,950
asking them pointed questions m M and
basically they admitted that if there

5702
01:58:54,950 --> 01:58:54,960
basically they admitted that if there
 

5703
01:58:54,960 --> 01:58:57,470
basically they admitted that if there
are four or more people M equally

01:59:02,069 --> 01:59:02,079
die or they just don't give the prize at
 

5709

01:59:11,790 --> 01:59:11,800
them it's they're not even right part of
 

5715
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:15,149
them it's they're not even right part of
the time I mean Joselyn Bell discovered

5716
01:59:15,149 --> 01:59:15,159
the time I mean Joselyn Bell discovered
 

5717
01:59:15,159 --> 01:59:19,550
the time I mean Joselyn Bell discovered

hsh conceived and built so he deserves
 

5723
01:59:26,599 --> 01:59:29,310
hsh conceived and built so he deserves
some credit but but he didn't discover

5724
01:59:29,310 --> 01:59:29,320
some credit but but he didn't discover
 

5725
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:32,350
some credit but but he didn't discover
the Pulsar she did and his initial

the Pulsar she did and his initial
 

5727
01:59:32,360 --> 01:59:35,870
the Pulsar she did and his initial
reaction to the data that she showed him

5728
01:59:35,870 --> 01:59:35,880
reaction to the data that she showed him
 

5729
01:59:35,880 --> 01:59:39,069
reaction to the data that she showed him
was a condescending rubbish my

this survey large scale survey with the
 

5765
02:00:25,639 --> 02:00:27,390
this survey large scale survey with the
Reuben telescope so she's been

5766
02:00:27,390 --> 02:00:27,400
Reuben telescope so she's been
 

5767
02:00:27,400 --> 02:00:29,589
Reuben telescope so she's been
recognized but never with the Nobel

5768
02:00:29,589 --> 02:00:29,599
recognized but never with the Nobel
 

5769
02:00:29,599 --> 02:00:32,030
recognized but never with the Nobel
Prize and I would say that to her credit

5770
02:00:32,030 --> 02:00:32,040
Prize and I would say that to her credit
 

5771
02:00:32,040 --> 02:00:35,270
Prize and I would say that to her credit
she did not let that consume her life

5772
02:00:35,270 --> 02:00:35,280
she did not let that consume her life
 

5773
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:37,350
she did not let that consume her life
either and perhaps it was a bit easier

5774
02:00:37,350 --> 02:00:37,360
either and perhaps it was a bit easier
 

5775
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:40,350
either and perhaps it was a bit easier
because there had been no no Bell given

5776
02:00:40,350 --> 02:00:40,360
because there had been no no Bell given
 

5777
02:00:40,360 --> 02:00:42,310
because there had been no no Bell given
for the discovery of Dark Matter whereas

there was a prize given for the
 

5783
02:00:47,480 --> 02:00:49,790
there was a prize given for the
discovery of the freaking pulsar and she

5784
02:00:49,790 --> 02:00:49,800
discovery of the freaking pulsar and she
 

5785
02:00:49,800 --> 02:00:52,229
discovery of the freaking pulsar and she
didn't get it what I mean what a Trav of

5803
02:01:16,199 --> 02:01:19,589
humans that result in dreams being
broken and you know like I that's why we

5804
02:01:19,589 --> 02:01:19,599
broken and you know like I that's why we
 

5805

for this particular moment and and then
 

5811
02:01:27,800 --> 02:01:30,470
for this particular moment and and then
there's referee decisions and like

5812
02:01:30,470 --> 02:01:30,480
there's referee decisions and like
 

5813
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:32,550
there's referee decisions and like
little slips of here and there like the

5814
02:01:32,550 --> 02:01:32,560
little slips of here and there like the
 

5815
02:01:32,560 --> 02:01:35,390
little slips of here and there like the
little misfortunes that destroy entire

02:01:39,069 --> 02:01:39,079
dreams and that's it's it's weird to say
 

5819

dreams and that's it's it's weird to say
but it feels like that makes the

5820

but it feels like that makes the
 

5821
02:01:41,400 --> 02:01:44,069
but it feels like that makes the
entirety of it even more special yeah if

5822
02:01:44,069 --> 02:01:44,079
entirety of it even more special yeah if
 

5823
02:01:44,079 --> 02:01:45,990
entirety of it even more special yeah if
it was perfect it wouldn't be

5824
02:01:45,990 --> 02:01:46,000
it was perfect it wouldn't be
 

5825
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:47,709

and so that's sending a message I think
 

5851
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:21,069
and so that's sending a message I think
to girls that they can do science and

5852
02:02:21,069 --> 02:02:21,079
to girls that they can do science and
 

5853
02:02:21,079 --> 02:02:24,669
to girls that they can do science and
they have um Role Models I think uh the

5854
02:02:24,669 --> 02:02:24,679
they have um Role Models I think uh the
 

5855
02:02:24,679 --> 02:02:26,870
they have um Role Models I think uh the

5908
02:03:28,470 --> 02:03:28,480
Foundation was going to cut the funding
 

5909
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:30,990
Foundation was going to cut the funding
from what I understand you know so so

5910
02:03:30,990 --> 02:03:31,000
from what I understand you know so so
 

5911
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,270
from what I understand you know so so
there's human drama involved in this

5912
02:03:33,270 --> 02:03:33,280
there's human drama involved in this
 

5913
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:34,830
there's human drama involved in this
whole thing and the Olympics yeah you

5914
02:03:34,830 --> 02:03:34,840
whole thing and the Olympics yeah you
 

5915
02:03:34,840 --> 02:03:37,750
whole thing and the Olympics yeah you
know a runner a swimmer a rummer runner

5916
02:03:37,750 --> 02:03:37,760
know a runner a swimmer a rummer runner
 

5917
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:40,589
know a runner a swimmer a rummer runner
you know they they slip just at the

5918
02:03:40,589 --> 02:03:40,599
you know they they slip just at the
 

5919
02:03:40,599 --> 02:03:42,189
you know they they slip just at the
moment that they were taking off from

5920
02:03:42,189 --> 02:03:42,199
moment that they were taking off from
 

5921
02:03:42,199 --> 02:03:44,069
moment that they were taking off from
the first thing and that costs them some

5922
02:03:44,069 --> 02:03:44,079
the first thing and that costs them some
 

5923
02:03:44,079 --> 02:03:46,430
the first thing and that costs them some
fraction of a second and that's it they

5924
02:03:46,430 --> 02:03:46,440
fraction of a second and that's it they
 

5925
02:03:46,440 --> 02:03:48,910
fraction of a second and that's it they
didn't win you know and in that case I

5926
02:03:48,910 --> 02:03:48,920
didn't win you know and in that case I
 

5927
02:03:48,920 --> 02:03:52,390
didn't win you know and in that case I
mean the the coaches the families which

5928
02:03:52,390 --> 02:03:52,400
mean the the coaches the families which
 

5929
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:54,109
mean the the coaches the families which
I've met a lot of Olympic athletes and

5930
02:03:54,109 --> 02:03:54,119
I've met a lot of Olympic athletes and
 

5931
02:03:54,119 --> 02:03:55,830
I've met a lot of Olympic athletes and
the coaches and the families of the

the coaches and the families of the
 

5933
02:03:55,840 --> 02:03:58,669
the coaches and the families of the
athletes are really the winners of the

5934
02:03:58,669 --> 02:03:58,679
athletes are really the winners of the
 

5935
02:03:58,679 --> 02:04:01,790
athletes are really the winners of the
medals I mean but they don't get the

5936
02:04:01,790 --> 02:04:01,800
medals I mean but they don't get the
 

5937

medal and it's it's you know credit
 

5939
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:06,830
medal and it's it's you know credit
assignment is a fascinating thing I mean

5940
02:04:06,830 --> 02:04:06,840
assignment is a fascinating thing I mean
 

5941
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:09,069
assignment is a fascinating thing I mean
that's the full human story we have yeah

5942
02:04:09,069 --> 02:04:09,079
that's the full human story we have yeah
 

5943
02:04:09,079 --> 02:04:11,430
that's the full human story we have yeah
we have and and uh outside of

we have and and uh outside of
 

5945
02:04:11,440 --> 02:04:14,629
we have and and uh outside of
prizes it's fascinating I mean uh just

to be in the middle of it for artificial

5948
02:04:16,310 --> 02:04:16,320
to be in the middle of it for artificial
 

5949
02:04:16,320 --> 02:04:18,350
to be in the middle of it for artificial
intelligence there's a field of deep

5950
02:04:18,350 --> 02:04:18,360
intelligence there's a field of deep
 

5951
02:04:18,360 --> 02:04:20,589
intelligence there's a field of deep
learning that's really exciting and

5952
02:04:20,589 --> 02:04:20,599
learning that's really exciting and
 

5953
02:04:20,599 --> 02:04:22,750
learning that's really exciting and
people have been there's a yet another

5954
02:04:22,750 --> 02:04:22,760
people have been there's a yet another
 

5955
02:04:22,760 --> 02:04:25,709
people have been there's a yet another
award uh the touring award given for

5956
02:04:25,709 --> 02:04:25,719
award uh the touring award given for
 

5957
02:04:25,719 --> 02:04:29,390
award uh the touring award given for
deep learning to to three folks who are

5958
02:04:29,390 --> 02:04:29,400
deep learning to to three folks who are
 

5959
02:04:29,400 --> 02:04:31,229
deep learning to to three folks who are
very much responsible for the field but

5960
02:04:31,229 --> 02:04:31,239
very much responsible for the field but
 

5961
02:04:31,239 --> 02:04:33,990
very much responsible for the field but
so are a lot of others that's right and

5962
02:04:33,990 --> 02:04:34,000
so are a lot of others that's right and
 

5963
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:38,510
so are a lot of others that's right and
there's a few there's uh uh

5964
02:04:38,510 --> 02:04:38,520
there's a few there's uh uh
 

5965
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:40,830
there's a few there's uh uh
there's a fellow by the name of Schmid

5969
02:04:45,400 --> 02:04:48,109
Huber who uh sort of symbolizes the the
Forgotten folks in in the Deep Learning

5970
02:04:48,109 --> 02:04:48,119
Forgotten folks in in the Deep Learning
 

5971

Community but you know that's that's the

5972

unfortunate set thing we
 

5975
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,790
unfortunate set thing we
remember we remember Isaac Newton we

5976
02:04:55,790 --> 02:04:55,800
remember we remember Isaac Newton we
 

5977
02:04:55,800 --> 02:04:59,109
remember we remember Isaac Newton we
remember uh these these these special

remember uh these these these special
 

5979
02:04:59,119 --> 02:05:02,790
remember uh these these these special
figures and the ones that flew close to

5980
02:05:02,790 --> 02:05:02,800
figures and the ones that flew close to
 

5981
02:05:02,800 --> 02:05:05,669
figures and the ones that flew close to
them uh we forget well that's right and

5982
02:05:05,669 --> 02:05:05,679
them uh we forget well that's right and
 

5983
02:05:05,679 --> 02:05:07,069
them uh we forget well that's right and
you know often the breakthroughs are

5984
02:05:07,069 --> 02:05:07,079
you know often the breakthroughs are
 

5985
02:05:07,079 --> 02:05:10,069
you know often the breakthroughs are
made based on the body of knowledge that

5986
02:05:10,069 --> 02:05:10,079
made based on the body of knowledge that
 

5987
02:05:10,079 --> 02:05:13,310
made based on the body of knowledge that
had been assimilated prior to that but

5988
02:05:13,310 --> 02:05:13,320
had been assimilated prior to that but
 

5989
02:05:13,320 --> 02:05:15,270
had been assimilated prior to that but
you know again people like to worship

5990
02:05:15,270 --> 02:05:15,280
you know again people like to worship

and stuff sometimes get Awards and stuff
 

5999
02:05:24,679 --> 02:05:26,549
and stuff sometimes get Awards and stuff
but um you know you look at even

6000
02:05:26,549 --> 02:05:26,559
but um you know you look at even
 

6001
02:05:26,559 --> 02:05:28,709
but um you know you look at even
something like I don't know songwriters

6002

something like I don't know songwriters
 

6003

Bernie topin right wrote many of the

6006
02:05:33,470 --> 02:05:33,480
Bernie topin right wrote many of the
 

6007
02:05:33,480 --> 02:05:34,470
Bernie topin right wrote many of the
words

6008
02:05:34,470 --> 02:05:34,480
words
 

6009
02:05:34,480 --> 02:05:37,310

I was heartbroken to learn that Elvis

6014
02:05:41,709 --> 02:05:41,719
I was heartbroken to learn that Elvis
 

6015
02:05:41,719 --> 02:05:43,510
I was heartbroken to learn that Elvis
didn't write most of his songs yeah

6016
02:05:43,510 --> 02:05:43,520
didn't write most of his songs yeah

didn't write most of his songs yeah
Elvis That's right there there you go

6018
02:05:45,430 --> 02:05:45,440
Elvis That's right there there you go
 

6019
02:05:45,440 --> 02:05:47,430
Elvis That's right there there you go
but he was the King right and he had

6020
02:05:47,430 --> 02:05:47,440
but he was the King right and he had
 

6021
02:05:47,440 --> 02:05:49,430
but he was the King right and he had
such a personality and and he it was

6022
02:05:49,430 --> 02:05:49,440
such a personality and and he it was
 

6023
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:51,629
such a personality and and he it was
such a performer right but it's the

6024
02:05:51,629 --> 02:05:51,639
such a performer right but it's the
 

6025
02:05:51,639 --> 02:05:55,390
such a performer right but it's the
unsung heroes in many cases yeah so

6026
02:05:55,390 --> 02:05:55,400
unsung heroes in many cases yeah so
 

6027
02:05:55,400 --> 02:05:58,149
unsung heroes in many cases yeah so
maybe taking a step back we talked about

6028
02:05:58,149 --> 02:05:58,159
maybe taking a step back we talked about
 

6029
02:05:58,159 --> 02:05:59,750
maybe taking a step back we talked about
the Nobel Prize for the accelerating

6030
02:05:59,750 --> 02:05:59,760
the Nobel Prize for the accelerating
 

6031
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:03,189
the Nobel Prize for the accelerating
universe but uh your work and the ideas

6032
02:06:03,189 --> 02:06:03,199
universe but uh your work and the ideas
 

6033
02:06:03,199 --> 02:06:07,830
universe but uh your work and the ideas
uh around Supernova were

6034
02:06:07,830 --> 02:06:07,840
uh around Supernova were
 

6035
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:10,549
uh around Supernova were
important uh in detecting this

6036
02:06:10,549 --> 02:06:10,559
important uh in detecting this
 

6037
02:06:10,559 --> 02:06:12,589
important uh in detecting this
accelerating universe can we go to the

6038
02:06:12,589 --> 02:06:12,599
accelerating universe can we go to the
 

6039
02:06:12,599 --> 02:06:15,669
accelerating universe can we go to the
very basics of what is this uh beautiful

6040
02:06:15,669 --> 02:06:15,679
very basics of what is this uh beautiful
 

6041
02:06:15,679 --> 02:06:17,830
very basics of what is this uh beautiful
mysterious object of a supernova right

6042
02:06:17,830 --> 02:06:17,840
mysterious object of a supernova right
 

6043
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:21,149
mysterious object of a supernova right
so a supernova is an exploding star most

6044
02:06:21,149 --> 02:06:21,159
so a supernova is an exploding star most
 

6045
02:06:21,159 --> 02:06:23,629
so a supernova is an exploding star most
stars die a relatively quiet death our

6046
02:06:23,629 --> 02:06:23,639
stars die a relatively quiet death our
 

6047
02:06:23,639 --> 02:06:25,430
stars die a relatively quiet death our
our own sun will despite the fact that

6048
02:06:25,430 --> 02:06:25,440
our own sun will despite the fact that
 

6049
02:06:25,440 --> 02:06:27,830
our own sun will despite the fact that
it'll become a red giant and incinerate

6050
02:06:27,830 --> 02:06:27,840
it'll become a red giant and incinerate
 

6051
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:30,229
it'll become a red giant and incinerate
Earth it'll do that reasonably slowly

6052
02:06:30,229 --> 02:06:30,239
Earth it'll do that reasonably slowly
 

6053
02:06:30,239 --> 02:06:32,510
Earth it'll do that reasonably slowly
but there's a small minority of stars

6054
02:06:32,510 --> 02:06:32,520
but there's a small minority of stars
 

6055
02:06:32,520 --> 02:06:34,669
but there's a small minority of stars
that end their lives in a Titanic

6056
02:06:34,669 --> 02:06:34,679
that end their lives in a Titanic
 

6057
02:06:34,679 --> 02:06:36,950
that end their lives in a Titanic
explosion and that's not only exciting

6058
02:06:36,950 --> 02:06:36,960
explosion and that's not only exciting
 

6059
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:39,629
explosion and that's not only exciting
to watch from afar but it's critical to

6060
02:06:39,629 --> 02:06:39,639
to watch from afar but it's critical to
 

6061
02:06:39,639 --> 02:06:42,030
to watch from afar but it's critical to
our existence because it is in these

6062
02:06:42,030 --> 02:06:42,040
our existence because it is in these
 

6063
02:06:42,040 --> 02:06:44,430
our existence because it is in these
explosions that the heavy elements

6064
02:06:44,430 --> 02:06:44,440
explosions that the heavy elements
 

6065
02:06:44,440 --> 02:06:46,669
explosions that the heavy elements
synthesize through nuclear reactions

6066
02:06:46,669 --> 02:06:46,679
synthesize through nuclear reactions
 

6067
02:06:46,679 --> 02:06:48,990
synthesize through nuclear reactions
during the normal course of the Stars

6068
02:06:48,990 --> 02:06:49,000
during the normal course of the Stars
 

6069
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,069
during the normal course of the Stars
Evolution and during the explosion

6070
02:06:51,069 --> 02:06:51,079
Evolution and during the explosion
 

6071
02:06:51,079 --> 02:06:53,870
Evolution and during the explosion
itself get ejected into the cosmos

6072
02:06:53,870 --> 02:06:53,880
itself get ejected into the cosmos
 

6073
02:06:53,880 --> 02:06:56,629
itself get ejected into the cosmos
making them available as raw material

6074
02:06:56,629 --> 02:06:56,639
making them available as raw material
 

6075
02:06:56,639 --> 02:06:59,350
making them available as raw material
for new stars planets and ultimately

6076
02:06:59,350 --> 02:06:59,360
for new stars planets and ultimately
 

6077
02:06:59,360 --> 02:07:00,950
for new stars planets and ultimately
life you know and that's just a great

6078
02:07:00,950 --> 02:07:00,960
life you know and that's just a great
 

6079
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:05,310
life you know and that's just a great
story um the best in in some ways so you

6080
02:07:05,310 --> 02:07:05,320
story um the best in in some ways so you
 

6081
02:07:05,320 --> 02:07:07,109
story um the best in in some ways so you
know we like to study these things and

6082
02:07:07,109 --> 02:07:07,119
know we like to study these things and
 

6083
02:07:07,119 --> 02:07:09,350
know we like to study these things and
and our Origins but it turns out these

6084
02:07:09,350 --> 02:07:09,360
and our Origins but it turns out these
 

6085
02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:12,470
and our Origins but it turns out these
are incredibly useful beacons as well

6086
02:07:12,470 --> 02:07:12,480
are incredibly useful beacons as well
 

6087
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:14,470
are incredibly useful beacons as well
because if you know how

6088
02:07:14,470 --> 02:07:14,480
because if you know how
 

6089
02:07:14,480 --> 02:07:17,830
because if you know how
powerful uh an exploding star really is

6090
02:07:17,830 --> 02:07:17,840
powerful uh an exploding star really is
 

6091
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:21,030
powerful uh an exploding star really is
by measuring the apparent brightness at

6092
02:07:21,030 --> 02:07:21,040
by measuring the apparent brightness at
 

6093
02:07:21,040 --> 02:07:22,310
by measuring the apparent brightness at
its peak

6094
02:07:22,310 --> 02:07:22,320
its peak
 

6095
02:07:22,320 --> 02:07:24,549
its peak
in galaxies whose distances we already

6096
02:07:24,549 --> 02:07:24,559
in galaxies whose distances we already
 

6097
02:07:24,559 --> 02:07:26,470
in galaxies whose distances we already
know through having made other

6098
02:07:26,470 --> 02:07:26,480
know through having made other
 

6099
02:07:26,480 --> 02:07:29,229
know through having made other
measurements and you can thus calibrate

6100
02:07:29,229 --> 02:07:29,239
measurements and you can thus calibrate
 

6101
02:07:29,239 --> 02:07:32,030
measurements and you can thus calibrate
how powerful the thing really is and

6102
02:07:32,030 --> 02:07:32,040
how powerful the thing really is and
 

6103
02:07:32,040 --> 02:07:34,350
how powerful the thing really is and
then you find ones that are much more

6104
02:07:34,350 --> 02:07:34,360
then you find ones that are much more
 

6105
02:07:34,360 --> 02:07:37,390
then you find ones that are much more
distant then you can use their observed

6106
02:07:37,390 --> 02:07:37,400
distant then you can use their observed
 

6107
02:07:37,400 --> 02:07:39,589
distant then you can use their observed
brightness compared with their true

6108
02:07:39,589 --> 02:07:39,599
brightness compared with their true
 

6109
02:07:39,599 --> 02:07:42,589
brightness compared with their true
intrinsic power or Luminosity to judge

6110
02:07:42,589 --> 02:07:42,599
intrinsic power or Luminosity to judge
 

6111
02:07:42,599 --> 02:07:44,589
intrinsic power or Luminosity to judge
their distance and hence the distance of

6112
02:07:44,589 --> 02:07:44,599
their distance and hence the distance of
 

6113
02:07:44,599 --> 02:07:47,310
their distance and hence the distance of
the Galaxy in which they're located so

6114
02:07:47,310 --> 02:07:47,320
the Galaxy in which they're located so
 

6115
02:07:47,320 --> 02:07:49,069
the Galaxy in which they're located so
okay it's like looking at if you'll uh

6116
02:07:49,069 --> 02:07:49,079
okay it's like looking at if you'll uh
 

6117
02:07:49,079 --> 02:07:51,709
okay it's like looking at if you'll uh
let me just give this one analogy you

6118
02:07:51,709 --> 02:07:51,719
let me just give this one analogy you
 

6119
02:07:51,719 --> 02:07:53,350
let me just give this one analogy you
know you judge the distance of an

6120
02:07:53,350 --> 02:07:53,360
know you judge the distance of an
 

6121
02:07:53,360 --> 02:07:56,310
know you judge the distance of an
oncoming car at Night by looking at how

6122
02:07:56,310 --> 02:07:56,320
oncoming car at Night by looking at how
 

6123
02:07:56,320 --> 02:07:58,390
oncoming car at Night by looking at how
bright its headlights appear to be and

6124
02:07:58,390 --> 02:07:58,400
bright its headlights appear to be and
 

6125
02:07:58,400 --> 02:08:00,470
bright its headlights appear to be and
you've calibrated how bright the

6126
02:08:00,470 --> 02:08:00,480
you've calibrated how bright the
 

6127
02:08:00,480 --> 02:08:02,669
you've calibrated how bright the
headlights are of a car that's two or

6128
02:08:02,669 --> 02:08:02,679
headlights are of a car that's two or
 

6129
02:08:02,679 --> 02:08:04,750
headlights are of a car that's two or
three meters away of known distance and

6130
02:08:04,750 --> 02:08:04,760
three meters away of known distance and
 

6131
02:08:04,760 --> 02:08:06,790
three meters away of known distance and
you go who that's a a faint headlight

6132
02:08:06,790 --> 02:08:06,800
you go who that's a a faint headlight
 

6133
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:09,430
you go who that's a a faint headlight
and so that's pretty far away you also

6134
02:08:09,430 --> 02:08:09,440
and so that's pretty far away you also
 

6135
02:08:09,440 --> 02:08:12,109
and so that's pretty far away you also
use the apparent angular separation

6136
02:08:12,109 --> 02:08:12,119
use the apparent angular separation
 

6137
02:08:12,119 --> 02:08:13,589
use the apparent angular separation
between the two headlights as a

6138
02:08:13,589 --> 02:08:13,599
between the two headlights as a
 

6139
02:08:13,599 --> 02:08:15,189
between the two headlights as a
consistency check in your brain but

6140
02:08:15,189 --> 02:08:15,199
consistency check in your brain but
 

6141
02:08:15,199 --> 02:08:16,830
consistency check in your brain but
that's what your brain is doing so we

6142
02:08:16,830 --> 02:08:16,840
that's what your brain is doing so we
 

6143
02:08:16,840 --> 02:08:19,549
that's what your brain is doing so we
can do that for cars we can do that for

6144
02:08:19,549 --> 02:08:19,559
can do that for cars we can do that for
 

6145
02:08:19,559 --> 02:08:22,470
can do that for cars we can do that for
stars nice I like that but you know with

6146
02:08:22,470 --> 02:08:22,480
stars nice I like that but you know with
 

6147
02:08:22,480 --> 02:08:25,229
stars nice I like that but you know with
cars the headlights are all there's some

6148
02:08:25,229 --> 02:08:25,239
cars the headlights are all there's some
 

6149
02:08:25,239 --> 02:08:28,149
cars the headlights are all there's some
variation there's but but uh they're

6150
02:08:28,149 --> 02:08:28,159
variation there's but but uh they're
 

6151
02:08:28,159 --> 02:08:30,109
variation there's but but uh they're
somewhat similar so you can make those

6152
02:08:30,109 --> 02:08:30,119
somewhat similar so you can make those
 

6153
02:08:30,119 --> 02:08:33,790
somewhat similar so you can make those
kinds of conclusions what uh how much uh

6154
02:08:33,790 --> 02:08:33,800
kinds of conclusions what uh how much uh
 

6155
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:35,669
kinds of conclusions what uh how much uh
variation is there between Supernova

6156
02:08:35,669 --> 02:08:35,679
variation is there between Supernova
 

6157
02:08:35,679 --> 02:08:38,589
variation is there between Supernova
that you can yeah that in can you detect

6158
02:08:38,589 --> 02:08:38,599
that you can yeah that in can you detect
 

6159
02:08:38,599 --> 02:08:40,310
that you can yeah that in can you detect
them right so first of all there are

6160
02:08:40,310 --> 02:08:40,320
them right so first of all there are
 

6161
02:08:40,320 --> 02:08:42,149
them right so first of all there are
several different ways that stars can

6162
02:08:42,149 --> 02:08:42,159
several different ways that stars can
 

6163
02:08:42,159 --> 02:08:44,109
several different ways that stars can
explode and it depends on their mass and

6164
02:08:44,109 --> 02:08:44,119
explode and it depends on their mass and
 

6165
02:08:44,119 --> 02:08:45,870
explode and it depends on their mass and
whether they're in a binary system and

6166
02:08:45,870 --> 02:08:45,880
whether they're in a binary system and
 

6167
02:08:45,880 --> 02:08:48,510
whether they're in a binary system and
things like that and the ones that we

6168
02:08:48,510 --> 02:08:48,520
things like that and the ones that we
 

6169
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:50,790
things like that and the ones that we
used for these cosmological purposes

6170
02:08:50,790 --> 02:08:50,800
used for these cosmological purposes
 

6171
02:08:50,800 --> 02:08:52,549
used for these cosmological purposes

white dwarf in about 7 billion years
 

6185
02:09:08,880 --> 02:09:11,750
white dwarf in about 7 billion years
it'll have about half its present Mass

6186
02:09:11,750 --> 02:09:11,760
it'll have about half its present Mass
 

6187
02:09:11,760 --> 02:09:14,229
it'll have about half its present Mass
compressed into a volume just the size

6188
02:09:14,229 --> 02:09:14,239
compressed into a volume just the size
 

6189
02:09:14,239 --> 02:09:16,870
compressed into a volume just the size
of Earth so that's an inordinate density

6190
02:09:16,870 --> 02:09:16,880
of Earth so that's an inordinate density
 

6191
02:09:16,880 --> 02:09:19,069
of Earth so that's an inordinate density
okay it's incredibly dense and the

6192
02:09:19,069 --> 02:09:19,079
okay it's incredibly dense and the
 

6193
02:09:19,079 --> 02:09:21,030
okay it's incredibly dense and the
matter is what's called by Quantum

02:09:21,030 --> 02:09:21,040
matter is what's called by Quantum
 

6195
02:09:21,040 --> 02:09:23,350

02:09:25,280 --> 02:09:27,069
it's morally reprehensible or anything
like that but this is just the name no

6200
02:09:27,069 --> 02:09:27,079
like that but this is just the name no
 

6201
02:09:27,079 --> 02:09:29,030
like that but this is just the name no
judgments here yeah Quantum physicists

give to electrons that are squeezed into
 

6205
02:09:31,280 --> 02:09:33,910
give to electrons that are squeezed into
a very tight space the electrons take on

6206
02:09:33,910 --> 02:09:33,920
a very tight space the electrons take on
 

6207
02:09:33,920 --> 02:09:36,310
a very tight space the electrons take on
a motion due to Heisenberg uncertain

6208
02:09:36,310 --> 02:09:36,320
a motion due to Heisenberg uncertain
 

6209
02:09:36,320 --> 02:09:38,589
a motion due to Heisenberg uncertain
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and

6210
02:09:38,589 --> 02:09:38,599
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and
 

6211
02:09:38,599 --> 02:09:40,990
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and
also due to the poly exclusion principle

6212
02:09:40,990 --> 02:09:41,000
also due to the poly exclusion principle
 

6213
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:42,870
also due to the poly exclusion principle
that electrons don't like to be in the

6214
02:09:42,870 --> 02:09:42,880
that electrons don't like to be in the
 

6215
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:44,549
that electrons don't like to be in the
same place they like to avoid each other

6216
02:09:44,549 --> 02:09:44,559
same place they like to avoid each other
 

6217
02:09:44,559 --> 02:09:46,910
same place they like to avoid each other
so those two things mean that a lot of

6218
02:09:46,910 --> 02:09:46,920
so those two things mean that a lot of
 

6219
02:09:46,920 --> 02:09:49,390
so those two things mean that a lot of
electrons are moving very rapidly which

6220
02:09:49,390 --> 02:09:49,400
electrons are moving very rapidly which
 

6221
02:09:49,400 --> 02:09:51,950
electrons are moving very rapidly which
gives the star an extra pressure

6222
02:09:51,950 --> 02:09:51,960
gives the star an extra pressure
 

6223
02:09:51,960 --> 02:09:53,709
gives the star an extra pressure
far above the thermal pressure

6224
02:09:53,709 --> 02:09:53,719
far above the thermal pressure
 

6225
02:09:53,719 --> 02:09:55,549
far above the thermal pressure
associated with just the random motions

6226
02:09:55,549 --> 02:09:55,559
associated with just the random motions
 

6227
02:09:55,559 --> 02:09:58,149
associated with just the random motions
of particles inside the star so it's a

6228
02:09:58,149 --> 02:09:58,159
of particles inside the star so it's a
 

6229
02:09:58,159 --> 02:10:01,189
of particles inside the star so it's a
weird type of star but normally it

6230
02:10:01,189 --> 02:10:01,199
weird type of star but normally it
 

6231
02:10:01,199 --> 02:10:03,589
weird type of star but normally it
wouldn't explode and our sun won't

6232
02:10:03,589 --> 02:10:03,599
wouldn't explode and our sun won't
 

6233
02:10:03,599 --> 02:10:06,189
wouldn't explode and our sun won't
explode except that if such a white

6234
02:10:06,189 --> 02:10:06,199
explode except that if such a white
 

6235
02:10:06,199 --> 02:10:08,830
explode except that if such a white
dwarf is in a pair with another more or

6236
02:10:08,830 --> 02:10:08,840
dwarf is in a pair with another more or
 

6237
02:10:08,840 --> 02:10:12,109
dwarf is in a pair with another more or
less normal star it can steal material

6238
02:10:12,109 --> 02:10:12,119
less normal star it can steal material
 

6239
02:10:12,119 --> 02:10:15,350
less normal star it can steal material
from that nor normal star until it gets

6240
02:10:15,350 --> 02:10:15,360
from that nor normal star until it gets
 

6241
02:10:15,360 --> 02:10:18,870
from that nor normal star until it gets
to an unstable limit rough roughly 1 and

6242
02:10:18,870 --> 02:10:18,880
to an unstable limit rough roughly 1 and
 

6243
02:10:18,880 --> 02:10:21,589
to an unstable limit rough roughly 1 and
a half times the mass of our sun 1. four

6244
02:10:21,589 --> 02:10:21,599
a half times the mass of our sun 1. four
 

6245
02:10:21,599 --> 02:10:24,030
a half times the mass of our sun 1. four
or so this is known as the chandar CH

of us have we had been Chandra would
 

6281
02:11:08,320 --> 02:11:11,510
of us have we had been Chandra would
have just given up astrophysics at that

6282
02:11:11,510 --> 02:11:11,520
have just given up astrophysics at that
 

6283
02:11:11,520 --> 02:11:13,069
have just given up astrophysics at that

don't be uh don't lose hope if you
 

6301
02:11:30,639 --> 02:11:32,549
don't be uh don't lose hope if you
really think you're on to something that

02:11:32,549 --> 02:11:32,559
really think you're on to something that
 

6303
02:11:32,559 --> 02:11:33,870
really think you're on to something that
doesn't mean never listen to your

well yeah but anyway um you know when a

6308
02:11:38,910 --> 02:11:38,920
well yeah but anyway um you know when a
 

6309
02:11:38,920 --> 02:11:42,189
well yeah but anyway um you know when a
white dwarf grows to a certain Mass it

6310
02:11:42,189 --> 02:11:42,199
white dwarf grows to a certain Mass it
 

6311
02:11:42,199 --> 02:11:44,470
white dwarf grows to a certain Mass it
becomes unstable and one of the ways it

6312
02:11:44,470 --> 02:11:44,480
becomes unstable and one of the ways it
 

6313
02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:46,990
becomes unstable and one of the ways it
can end its life is to go through a

6314
02:11:46,990 --> 02:11:47,000
can end its life is to go through a
 

6315
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,990
can end its life is to go through a
thermonuclear runaway so basically the

6316
02:11:49,990 --> 02:11:50,000
thermonuclear runaway so basically the
 

6317
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,709
thermonuclear runaway so basically the
carbon nuclei and inside the white dwarf

6318
02:11:52,709 --> 02:11:52,719
carbon nuclei and inside the white dwarf
 

6319
02:11:52,719 --> 02:11:55,109
carbon nuclei and inside the white dwarf
starts start fusing together to form

6320
02:11:55,109 --> 02:11:55,119
starts start fusing together to form
 

6321
02:11:55,119 --> 02:11:58,189
starts start fusing together to form
heavier nuclei and the energy that those

6322
02:11:58,189 --> 02:11:58,199
heavier nuclei and the energy that those
 

6323
02:11:58,199 --> 02:12:00,350
heavier nuclei and the energy that those

02:12:05,790 --> 02:12:05,800
emit emits doesn't go into um you know
 

6327
02:12:05,800 --> 02:12:08,229
emit emits doesn't go into um you know
being dissipated out of the star or you

6328
02:12:08,229 --> 02:12:08,239
being dissipated out of the star or you
 

6329
02:12:08,239 --> 02:12:11,390
being dissipated out of the star or you
know whatever U or expanding it the way

6330
02:12:11,390 --> 02:12:11,400
know whatever U or expanding it the way
 

6331
02:12:11,400 --> 02:12:12,870
know whatever U or expanding it the way
you know if you take a blowtorch to the

6332
02:12:12,870 --> 02:12:12,880
you know if you take a blowtorch to the
 

6333
02:12:12,880 --> 02:12:15,390
you know if you take a blowtorch to the
middle of the sun you heat up its gases

6334
02:12:15,390 --> 02:12:15,400
middle of the sun you heat up its gases
 

6335
02:12:15,400 --> 02:12:17,990
middle of the sun you heat up its gases
the gases would expand and cool but this

6336
02:12:17,990 --> 02:12:18,000
the gases would expand and cool but this
 

6337
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:22,069
the gases would expand and cool but this
degenerate star can't expand and cool so

6338
02:12:22,069 --> 02:12:22,079
degenerate star can't expand and cool so
 

6339
02:12:22,079 --> 02:12:24,030
degenerate star can't expand and cool so
the energy pumped in through these

6340
02:12:24,030 --> 02:12:24,040
the energy pumped in through these
 

6341
02:12:24,040 --> 02:12:26,750
the energy pumped in through these
Fusion reactions goes into making the

6342
02:12:26,750 --> 02:12:26,760
Fusion reactions goes into making the
 

6343
02:12:26,760 --> 02:12:29,870
Fusion reactions goes into making the
nuclei move faster and that gets more of

6344
02:12:29,870 --> 02:12:29,880
nuclei move faster and that gets more of
 

6345
02:12:29,880 --> 02:12:31,709
nuclei move faster and that gets more of
them sufficiently close together that

6346
02:12:31,709 --> 02:12:31,719
them sufficiently close together that
 

6347
02:12:31,719 --> 02:12:34,069
them sufficiently close together that
they can undergo nuclear fusion thereby

6348
02:12:34,069 --> 02:12:34,079
they can undergo nuclear fusion thereby
 

6349
02:12:34,079 --> 02:12:36,589
they can undergo nuclear fusion thereby
releasing more energy that goes into

6350
02:12:36,589 --> 02:12:36,599
releasing more energy that goes into
 

6351
02:12:36,599 --> 02:12:39,189
releasing more energy that goes into
speeding up more nuclei and thus you

6352
02:12:39,189 --> 02:12:39,199
speeding up more nuclei and thus you
 

6353
02:12:39,199 --> 02:12:43,390
speeding up more nuclei and thus you
have a a runaway a bomb an uncontrolled

6354
02:12:43,390 --> 02:12:43,400
have a a runaway a bomb an uncontrolled
 

6355
02:12:43,400 --> 02:12:45,390
have a a runaway a bomb an uncontrolled
nuclear fusion reactor right instead of

6356
02:12:45,390 --> 02:12:45,400
nuclear fusion reactor right instead of
 

6357
02:12:45,400 --> 02:12:46,990
nuclear fusion reactor right instead of
the controlled Fusion which is what our

6358
02:12:46,990 --> 02:12:47,000
the controlled Fusion which is what our
 

6359
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,709
the controlled Fusion which is what our
sun does okay our sun is a marvelous

6360
02:12:49,709 --> 02:12:49,719
sun does okay our sun is a marvelous
 

6361
02:12:49,719 --> 02:12:51,709
sun does okay our sun is a marvelous
controlled Fusion reactor this is what

6362
02:12:51,709 --> 02:12:51,719
controlled Fusion reactor this is what
 

6363
02:12:51,719 --> 02:12:53,990
controlled Fusion reactor this is what
we need here on Earth Fusion Energy to

6364
02:12:53,990 --> 02:12:54,000
we need here on Earth Fusion Energy to
 

6365
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,430
we need here on Earth Fusion Energy to
solve our energy crisis right uh but the

6366
02:12:56,430 --> 02:12:56,440
solve our energy crisis right uh but the
 

6367
02:12:56,440 --> 02:12:58,430
solve our energy crisis right uh but the
sun holds the stuff in you know through

6368
02:12:58,430 --> 02:12:58,440
sun holds the stuff in you know through
 

6369
02:12:58,440 --> 02:13:00,109
sun holds the stuff in you know through
gravity and you need a big Mass to do

6370
02:13:00,109 --> 02:13:00,119
gravity and you need a big Mass to do
 

6371
02:13:00,119 --> 02:13:03,629
gravity and you need a big Mass to do
that so this uncon uncontrolled fusion

6372
02:13:03,629 --> 02:13:03,639
that so this uncon uncontrolled fusion
 

6373
02:13:03,639 --> 02:13:06,030
that so this uncon uncontrolled fusion
reaction blows up a star that's pretty

6374
02:13:06,030 --> 02:13:06,040
reaction blows up a star that's pretty
 

6375
02:13:06,040 --> 02:13:08,510
reaction blows up a star that's pretty
much the same in all

6376
02:13:08,510 --> 02:13:08,520
much the same in all
 

6377
02:13:08,520 --> 02:13:11,830
much the same in all
cases and you measure it to be almost

6378
02:13:11,830 --> 02:13:11,840
cases and you measure it to be almost
 

6379
02:13:11,840 --> 02:13:13,549
cases and you measure it to be almost
the same in all cases but the devil is

6380
02:13:13,549 --> 02:13:13,559
the same in all cases but the devil is
 

6381
02:13:13,559 --> 02:13:16,069
the same in all cases but the devil is
in the details and in fact we observe

6382
02:13:16,069 --> 02:13:16,079
in the details and in fact we observe
 

6383
02:13:16,079 --> 02:13:18,990
in the details and in fact we observe
them to not be all the same and

6384
02:13:18,990 --> 02:13:19,000
them to not be all the same and
 

6385
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:20,709
them to not be all the same and
theoretically they might not be all the

6386
02:13:20,709 --> 02:13:20,719
theoretically they might not be all the
 

6387
02:13:20,719 --> 02:13:22,870
theoretically they might not be all the
same because the rate of the fusion

6388
02:13:22,870 --> 02:13:22,880
same because the rate of the fusion
 

6389
02:13:22,880 --> 02:13:25,990
same because the rate of the fusion
reactions might depend on the amount of

6390
02:13:25,990 --> 02:13:26,000
reactions might depend on the amount of
 

6391
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,030
reactions might depend on the amount of
Trace heavier elements in the white

02:13:28,030 --> 02:13:28,040
Trace heavier elements in the white
 

6393
02:13:28,040 --> 02:13:29,870
Trace heavier elements in the white
dwarf and that could depend on how old

6394
02:13:29,870 --> 02:13:29,880
dwarf and that could depend on how old
 

6395
02:13:29,880 --> 02:13:31,629

02:13:31,639 --> 02:13:33,270
it is when it was you know whether it
was born billions of years ago when

6398
02:13:33,270 --> 02:13:33,280
was born billions of years ago when
 

6399
02:13:33,280 --> 02:13:35,270
was born billions of years ago when
there weren't many heavier elements or

6400
02:13:35,270 --> 02:13:35,280
there weren't many heavier elements or
 

6401
02:13:35,280 --> 02:13:37,350
there weren't many heavier elements or
whether it's a relatively young white

6402
02:13:37,350 --> 02:13:37,360
whether it's a relatively young white
 

6403
02:13:37,360 --> 02:13:40,149
whether it's a relatively young white
dwarf and all kinds of other things and

dwarf and all kinds of other things and
 

6405
02:13:40,159 --> 02:13:42,430
dwarf and all kinds of other things and
part of my work was to show that indeed

6406
02:13:42,430 --> 02:13:42,440
part of my work was to show that indeed
 

6407
02:13:42,440 --> 02:13:44,910
part of my work was to show that indeed
not all the type 1as are the same you

6408
02:13:44,910 --> 02:13:44,920
not all the type 1as are the same you
 

6409
02:13:44,920 --> 02:13:47,589
not all the type 1as are the same you
have to be careful when you use them you

6410
02:13:47,589 --> 02:13:47,599
have to be careful when you use them you
 

6411
02:13:47,599 --> 02:13:49,870
have to be careful when you use them you
have to calibrate them they're not

6412
02:13:49,870 --> 02:13:49,880
have to calibrate them they're not
 

6413
02:13:49,880 --> 02:13:52,390
have to calibrate them they're not
standard candles

6414
02:13:52,390 --> 02:13:52,400
standard candles
 

6415
02:13:52,400 --> 02:13:54,830
standard candles
the way it just if all headlights or all

6416
02:13:54,830 --> 02:13:54,840
the way it just if all headlights or all
 

6417
02:13:54,840 --> 02:13:57,750
the way it just if all headlights or all
candles were the same lumens or whatever

6418
02:13:57,750 --> 02:13:57,760
candles were the same lumens or whatever
 

6419
02:13:57,760 --> 02:13:59,350
candles were the same lumens or whatever
you'd say they're standard and it would

6420
02:13:59,350 --> 02:13:59,360
you'd say they're standard and it would
 

6421
02:13:59,360 --> 02:14:01,310
you'd say they're standard and it would
be standard candles is an awesome term

6422
02:14:01,310 --> 02:14:01,320
be standard candles is an awesome term
 

6423
02:14:01,320 --> 02:14:02,589
be standard candles is an awesome term
okay standard candles is what

6424
02:14:02,589 --> 02:14:02,599
okay standard candles is what
 

6425
02:14:02,599 --> 02:14:05,030
okay standard candles is what
astronomers like to say I don't like

6426
02:14:05,030 --> 02:14:05,040
astronomers like to say I don't like
 

6427
02:14:05,040 --> 02:14:06,390
astronomers like to say I don't like
that term because there aren't any

6428
02:14:06,390 --> 02:14:06,400
that term because there aren't any
 

6429
02:14:06,400 --> 02:14:08,069
that term because there aren't any
standard candles but there are

6430
02:14:08,069 --> 02:14:08,079
standard candles but there are
 

6431
02:14:08,079 --> 02:14:11,669
standard candles but there are
standardizable candles and by looking at

6432
02:14:11,669 --> 02:14:11,679
standardizable candles and by looking at
 

6433
02:14:11,679 --> 02:14:13,589
standardizable candles and by looking at
these yeah you calibratable

6434
02:14:13,589 --> 02:14:13,599
these yeah you calibratable
 

6435
02:14:13,599 --> 02:14:15,510
these yeah you calibratable
standardizable calibratable you look at

6436
02:14:15,510 --> 02:14:15,520
standardizable calibratable you look at
 

6437
02:14:15,520 --> 02:14:17,910
standardizable calibratable you look at
enough of them in nearby galaxies whose

6438
02:14:17,910 --> 02:14:17,920
enough of them in nearby galaxies whose
 

6439
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:20,870
enough of them in nearby galaxies whose
distances you know independently and

6440
02:14:20,870 --> 02:14:20,880
distances you know independently and
 

6441
02:14:20,880 --> 02:14:23,669
distances you know independently and
what you can tell is that you know uh

6442
02:14:23,669 --> 02:14:23,679
what you can tell is that you know uh
 

6443
02:14:23,679 --> 02:14:24,790
what you can tell is that you know uh
this is something that a colleague of

02:14:24,790 --> 02:14:24,800
this is something that a colleague of
 

6445
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:26,830
this is something that a colleague of
mine Mark Phillips did who was on

mine Mark Phillips did who was on
 

6447
02:14:26,840 --> 02:14:29,390
mine Mark Phillips did who was on
Schmidt's team and arguably one of the

6448
02:14:29,390 --> 02:14:29,400
Schmidt's team and arguably one of the
 

6449
02:14:29,400 --> 02:14:30,629

was one of the people who deserved the
 

6451
02:14:30,639 --> 02:14:32,709
was one of the people who deserved the
Nobel Prize but he showed that the

6452
02:14:32,709 --> 02:14:32,719
Nobel Prize but he showed that the
 

6453
02:14:32,719 --> 02:14:37,470
Nobel Prize but he showed that the
intrinsically more powerful type 1as um

6454
02:14:37,470 --> 02:14:37,480
intrinsically more powerful type 1as um
 

6455
02:14:37,480 --> 02:14:40,069
intrinsically more powerful type 1as um
decline in brightness and it turns out

6456
02:14:40,069 --> 02:14:40,079
decline in brightness and it turns out
 

6457
02:14:40,079 --> 02:14:42,910
decline in brightness and it turns out
rise in brightness as well more slowly

6458
02:14:42,910 --> 02:14:42,920
rise in brightness as well more slowly
 

6459
02:14:42,920 --> 02:14:45,950
rise in brightness as well more slowly
than the less luminous onea and so if

6460
02:14:45,950 --> 02:14:45,960
than the less luminous onea and so if
 

6461
02:14:45,960 --> 02:14:48,310
than the less luminous onea and so if
you calibrate this by measuring a whole

6462
02:14:48,310 --> 02:14:48,320
you calibrate this by measuring a whole
 

6463
02:14:48,320 --> 02:14:50,430
you calibrate this by measuring a whole
bunch of nearby ones and then you look

6464
02:14:50,430 --> 02:14:50,440
bunch of nearby ones and then you look
 

6465
02:14:50,440 --> 02:14:53,270
bunch of nearby ones and then you look
at a distance one instead of saying well

6466
02:14:53,270 --> 02:14:53,280
at a distance one instead of saying well
 

6467
02:14:53,280 --> 02:14:56,030
at a distance one instead of saying well
it's a 100 watt type 1 a supernova

6468
02:14:56,030 --> 02:14:56,040
it's a 100 watt type 1 a supernova
 

6469
02:14:56,040 --> 02:14:57,390
it's a 100 watt type 1 a supernova
they're much more powerful than that by

6470
02:14:57,390 --> 02:14:57,400
they're much more powerful than that by
 

6471
02:14:57,400 --> 02:15:00,390
they're much more powerful than that by
the way plus or minus 50 you can say no

6472
02:15:00,390 --> 02:15:00,400
the way plus or minus 50 you can say no
 

6473
02:15:00,400 --> 02:15:04,870
the way plus or minus 50 you can say no
it's it's 112 plus or minus 15 or it's

6474
02:15:04,870 --> 02:15:04,880
it's it's 112 plus or minus 15 or it's
 

6475
02:15:04,880 --> 02:15:09,310
it's it's 112 plus or minus 15 or it's
or it's 84 plus or minus 17 it it tells

6476
02:15:09,310 --> 02:15:09,320
or it's 84 plus or minus 17 it it tells
 

6477
02:15:09,320 --> 02:15:12,750
or it's 84 plus or minus 17 it it tells
you where it is in the power scale and

6478
02:15:12,750 --> 02:15:12,760
you where it is in the power scale and
 

6479
02:15:12,760 --> 02:15:15,149
you where it is in the power scale and
it greatly decreases the uncertainties

6480
02:15:15,149 --> 02:15:15,159
it greatly decreases the uncertainties
 

6481
02:15:15,159 --> 02:15:16,669
it greatly decreases the uncertainties
and that's what makes these things

6482
02:15:16,669 --> 02:15:16,679
and that's what makes these things
 

6483
02:15:16,679 --> 02:15:19,910
and that's what makes these things
cosmologically useful I showed that if

6484
02:15:19,910 --> 02:15:19,920
cosmologically useful I showed that if
 

6485
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:22,430
cosmologically useful I showed that if
you spread the light out into a spectrum

6486
02:15:22,430 --> 02:15:22,440
you spread the light out into a spectrum
 

6487
02:15:22,440 --> 02:15:24,390
you spread the light out into a spectrum
you can tell spectroscopically that

6488
02:15:24,390 --> 02:15:24,400
you can tell spectroscopically that
 

6489
02:15:24,400 --> 02:15:26,870
you can tell spectroscopically that
these things are different as well and

6490
02:15:26,870 --> 02:15:26,880
these things are different as well and
 

6491
02:15:26,880 --> 02:15:30,510
these things are different as well and
in 1991 I happened to study two of the

02:15:30,510 --> 02:15:30,520
in 1991 I happened to study two of the
 

6493
02:15:30,520 --> 02:15:33,669
in 1991 I happened to study two of the
extreme peculiar ones the low Luminosity

02:15:33,669 --> 02:15:33,679
extreme peculiar ones the low Luminosity
 

6495
02:15:33,679 --> 02:15:37,270
extreme peculiar ones the low Luminosity
ones and the high Luminosity ones 1991

6496
02:15:37,270 --> 02:15:37,280
ones and the high Luminosity ones 1991
 

6497
02:15:37,280 --> 02:15:39,470

6498
02:15:39,470 --> 02:15:39,480
BG and
 

6499
02:15:39,480 --> 02:15:42,709
BG and
1991t this showed that not all the 1 A's

6500
02:15:42,709 --> 02:15:42,719
1991t this showed that not all the 1 A's
 

6501
02:15:42,719 --> 02:15:45,430
1991t this showed that not all the 1 A's
are the same and indeed at the time of

6502
02:15:45,430 --> 02:15:45,440
are the same and indeed at the time of
 

6503
02:15:45,440 --> 02:15:48,709
are the same and indeed at the time of
1991 I was a little bit skeptical that

6504
02:15:48,709 --> 02:15:48,719
1991 I was a little bit skeptical that
 

6505
02:15:48,719 --> 02:15:51,069
1991 I was a little bit skeptical that
we could use type 1a's because of this

6506
02:15:51,069 --> 02:15:51,079
we could use type 1a's because of this
 

6507
02:15:51,079 --> 02:15:53,430
we could use type 1a's because of this
diversity that I was observing but in

6508
02:15:53,430 --> 02:15:53,440
diversity that I was observing but in

02:15:53,440 --> 02:15:56,669
diversity that I was observing but in
1993 Mark Phillips wrote a paper that

6510
02:15:56,669 --> 02:15:56,679
1993 Mark Phillips wrote a paper that
 

6511
02:15:56,679 --> 02:15:59,870
1993 Mark Phillips wrote a paper that
showed this correlation between the

showed this correlation between the
 

6513
02:15:59,880 --> 02:16:02,109
showed this correlation between the
light curve the brightness versus time

02:16:02,109 --> 02:16:02,119
light curve the brightness versus time
 

6515
02:16:02,119 --> 02:16:04,270
light curve the brightness versus time
and the peak luminosity and once gives

6516
02:16:04,270 --> 02:16:04,280
and the peak luminosity and once gives
 

6517
02:16:04,280 --> 02:16:05,870
and the peak luminosity and once gives
you enough information to calibrate yeah

6518
02:16:05,870 --> 02:16:05,880
you enough information to calibrate yeah
 

6519
02:16:05,880 --> 02:16:07,229
you enough information to calibrate yeah
then they become calibratable and that

6520
02:16:07,229 --> 02:16:07,239
then they become calibratable and that
 

6521
02:16:07,239 --> 02:16:09,470
then they become calibratable and that
was a game changer how many type 1 a are

02:16:09,470 --> 02:16:09,480
was a game changer how many type 1 a are
 

6523
02:16:09,480 --> 02:16:12,510
was a game changer how many type 1 a are
out there oh gosh to use for data now

02:16:14,709 --> 02:16:14,719
there are thousands of them but at the
 

6527
02:16:14,719 --> 02:16:17,310
there are thousands of them but at the
time the high Z team had

6528
02:16:17,310 --> 02:16:17,320
time the high Z team had
 

6529
02:16:17,320 --> 02:16:20,549
time the high Z team had
16 and the um Supernova cosmology

6530
02:16:20,549 --> 02:16:20,559
16 and the um Supernova cosmology
 

6531
02:16:20,559 --> 02:16:24,470
16 and the um Supernova cosmology
project had 40 but the 16 were better

6532
02:16:24,470 --> 02:16:24,480
project had 40 but the 16 were better
 

6533
02:16:24,480 --> 02:16:26,750
project had 40 but the 16 were better
measured than the 40 and so our

6534
02:16:26,750 --> 02:16:26,760
measured than the 40 and so our
 

6535
02:16:26,760 --> 02:16:29,149
measured than the 40 and so our
statistical uncertainties were

6536
02:16:29,149 --> 02:16:29,159
statistical uncertainties were
 

6537
02:16:29,159 --> 02:16:30,990
statistical uncertainties were
comparable if you look at the two papers

6538
02:16:30,990 --> 02:16:31,000
comparable if you look at the two papers
 

6539
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,389
comparable if you look at the two papers
that were published how's that make you

6540
02:16:33,389 --> 02:16:33,399
that were published how's that make you
 

6541
02:16:33,399 --> 02:16:35,870
that were published how's that make you
uh feel that there's these gigantic

6542
02:16:35,870 --> 02:16:35,880
uh feel that there's these gigantic
 

6543
02:16:35,880 --> 02:16:38,709
uh feel that there's these gigantic
explosions just sprinkled out there is

6544
02:16:38,709 --> 02:16:38,719
explosions just sprinkled out there is
 

6545
02:16:38,719 --> 02:16:40,270
explosions just sprinkled out there is
that well I certainly don't want one to

6546
02:16:40,270 --> 02:16:40,280
that well I certainly don't want one to
 

6547
02:16:40,280 --> 02:16:42,509
that well I certainly don't want one to
be very nearby and it would have to be

6548
02:16:42,509 --> 02:16:42,519
be very nearby and it would have to be
 

6549
02:16:42,519 --> 02:16:44,709
be very nearby and it would have to be
within something like 10 light years to

6550
02:16:44,709 --> 02:16:44,719
within something like 10 light years to
 

6551
02:16:44,719 --> 02:16:47,230
within something like 10 light years to
be an existential threat so they can

6552
02:16:47,230 --> 02:16:47,240
be an existential threat so they can
 

6553
02:16:47,240 --> 02:16:51,870
be an existential threat so they can
happen in our uh Galaxy oh yeah you

6554
02:16:51,870 --> 02:16:51,880
happen in our uh Galaxy oh yeah you
 

6555
02:16:51,880 --> 02:16:53,950
happen in our uh Galaxy oh yeah you
uh in most cases we'd be okay because

6556
02:16:53,950 --> 02:16:53,960
uh in most cases we'd be okay because
 

6557
02:16:53,960 --> 02:16:57,030
uh in most cases we'd be okay because
our galaxy is 100,000 light years across

6558
02:16:57,030 --> 02:16:57,040
our galaxy is 100,000 light years across
 

6559
02:16:57,040 --> 02:16:58,790
our galaxy is 100,000 light years across
and you'd need one of these things to be

6560
02:16:58,790 --> 02:16:58,800
and you'd need one of these things to be
 

6561
02:16:58,800 --> 02:17:00,830
and you'd need one of these things to be
within about 10 light years to be an

6562
02:17:00,830 --> 02:17:00,840
within about 10 light years to be an
 

6563
02:17:00,840 --> 02:17:03,549
within about 10 light years to be an
existential threat and it gives birth to

6564
02:17:03,549 --> 02:17:03,559
existential threat and it gives birth to
 

6565
02:17:03,559 --> 02:17:07,270
existential threat and it gives birth to
a bunch of other um stars I guess yeah

6566
02:17:07,270 --> 02:17:07,280
a bunch of other um stars I guess yeah
 

6567
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:09,150
a bunch of other um stars I guess yeah
it gives birth to expanding gases that

6568
02:17:09,150 --> 02:17:09,160
it gives birth to expanding gases that
 

6569
02:17:09,160 --> 02:17:10,669
it gives birth to expanding gases that
are chemically enriched and those

6570
02:17:10,669 --> 02:17:10,679
are chemically enriched and those
 

6571
02:17:10,679 --> 02:17:12,950
are chemically enriched and those
expanding gases mix with other

I teach this introductory astronomy

6582
02:17:26,950 --> 02:17:26,960
I teach this introductory astronomy
 

6583
02:17:26,960 --> 02:17:29,230
I teach this introductory astronomy
course at at Berkeley and I tell them

6584
02:17:29,230 --> 02:17:29,240
course at at Berkeley and I tell them
 

6585
02:17:29,240 --> 02:17:31,110
course at at Berkeley and I tell them
there's only five or six things that I I

6586
02:17:31,110 --> 02:17:31,120
there's only five or six things that I I
 

6587
02:17:31,120 --> 02:17:32,950
there's only five or six things that I I
want them to really understand and

6588
02:17:32,950 --> 02:17:32,960
want them to really understand and
 

6589
02:17:32,960 --> 02:17:34,750
want them to really understand and
remember and I'm going to come to their

6590
02:17:34,750 --> 02:17:34,760
remember and I'm going to come to their
 

6591
02:17:34,760 --> 02:17:36,589
remember and I'm going to come to their
deathbed and I'm going to ask them about

6592
02:17:36,589 --> 02:17:36,599
deathbed and I'm going to ask them about
 

6593
02:17:36,599 --> 02:17:38,349
deathbed and I'm going to ask them about
this and if they get it wrong I will

6594
02:17:38,349 --> 02:17:38,359
this and if they get it wrong I will
 

6595
02:17:38,359 --> 02:17:40,750
this and if they get it wrong I will
retroactively fail their whole career

6596
02:17:40,750 --> 02:17:40,760
retroactively fail their whole career
 

6597
02:17:40,760 --> 02:17:43,950
retroactively fail their whole career
will have been shot that and they don't

6598
02:17:43,950 --> 02:17:43,960
will have been shot that and they don't
 

6599
02:17:43,960 --> 02:17:45,750
will have been shot that and they don't
observe a total solar eclipse and yet

6600
02:17:45,750 --> 02:17:45,760
observe a total solar eclipse and yet
 

6601
02:17:45,760 --> 02:17:47,750
observe a total solar eclipse and yet
they had the opportunity to do so I will

6602
02:17:47,750 --> 02:17:47,760
they had the opportunity to do so I will
 

6603
02:17:47,760 --> 02:17:49,830
they had the opportunity to do so I will
retroactively fail them but one of them

6604
02:17:49,830 --> 02:17:49,840
retroactively fail them but one of them
 

6605
02:17:49,840 --> 02:17:51,790
retroactively fail them but one of them
is you know where did we come from where

Greatest Story over ever told I mean you

6684
02:19:41,750 --> 02:19:41,760
Greatest Story over ever told I mean you
 

6685
02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:43,270
Greatest Story over ever told I mean you
could link it to the big bang and go

6686
02:19:43,270 --> 02:19:43,280
could link it to the big bang and go
 

6687
02:19:43,280 --> 02:19:45,349
could link it to the big bang and go
even farther right to make an even more

6688
02:19:45,349 --> 02:19:45,359
even farther right to make an even more
 

6689
02:19:45,359 --> 02:19:48,429
even farther right to make an even more
complete story but as as a subset that's

6690
02:19:48,429 --> 02:19:48,439
complete story but as as a subset that's
 

6691
02:19:48,439 --> 02:19:51,110
complete story but as as a subset that's
even in some ways a greater story than

6692
02:19:51,110 --> 02:19:51,120
even in some ways a greater story than
 

6693
02:19:51,120 --> 02:19:53,190
even in some ways a greater story than
than even the existence of the universe

6694
02:19:53,190 --> 02:19:53,200
than even the existence of the universe
 

6695
02:19:53,200 --> 02:19:55,030
than even the existence of the universe
in some ways cuz you could end up you

6696
02:19:55,030 --> 02:19:55,040
in some ways cuz you could end up you
 

6697
02:19:55,040 --> 02:19:56,710
in some ways cuz you could end up you
could just imagine some really boring

6698
02:19:56,710 --> 02:19:56,720
could just imagine some really boring

Supernova usually the the introduction
 

6705
02:20:05,359 --> 02:20:08,389
Supernova usually the the introduction
to that story so are are they usually

6706
02:20:08,389 --> 02:20:08,399
to that story so are are they usually
 

6707
02:20:08,399 --> 02:20:10,670
to that story so are are they usually
the thing that launches the is there

the thing that launches the is there
 

6709
02:20:10,680 --> 02:20:12,950
the thing that launches the is there
other engines of creation well the

Supernova is the one I mean I I I touch

6712
02:20:15,670 --> 02:20:15,680
Supernova is the one I mean I I I touch
 

6713
02:20:15,680 --> 02:20:18,429
Supernova is the one I mean I I I touch
upon the subject earlier in my course in

6714
02:20:18,429 --> 02:20:18,439
upon the subject earlier in my course in
 

6715
02:20:18,439 --> 02:20:19,910
upon the subject earlier in my course in
fact right about now in my lectures

6716
02:20:19,910 --> 02:20:19,920
fact right about now in my lectures
 

6717
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:22,190
fact right about now in my lectures
because I talk about how our sun right

6718
02:20:22,190 --> 02:20:22,200
because I talk about how our sun right
 

6719
02:20:22,200 --> 02:20:24,230
because I talk about how our sun right
now is fusing hydrogen to form helium

6720
02:20:24,230 --> 02:20:24,240
now is fusing hydrogen to form helium
 

6721
02:20:24,240 --> 02:20:27,590
now is fusing hydrogen to form helium
nuclei and later it'll form carbon and

6722
02:20:27,590 --> 02:20:27,600
nuclei and later it'll form carbon and
 

6723
02:20:27,600 --> 02:20:29,790
nuclei and later it'll form carbon and
oxygen nuclei but that's where the

6724
02:20:29,790 --> 02:20:29,800
oxygen nuclei but that's where the
 

6725
02:20:29,800 --> 02:20:32,150
oxygen nuclei but that's where the
process will stop for our sun it's not

6726
02:20:32,150 --> 02:20:32,160
process will stop for our sun it's not
 

6727
02:20:32,160 --> 02:20:34,030
process will stop for our sun it's not
massive enough some Stars can that are

6728
02:20:34,030 --> 02:20:34,040
massive enough some Stars can that are
 

6729
02:20:34,040 --> 02:20:36,950
massive enough some Stars can that are
more massive can go somewhat beyond that

6730
02:20:36,950 --> 02:20:36,960
more massive can go somewhat beyond that
 

6731
02:20:36,960 --> 02:20:39,270
more massive can go somewhat beyond that
so that's the beginning of right this

6732
02:20:39,270 --> 02:20:39,280
so that's the beginning of right this
 

6733
02:20:39,280 --> 02:20:41,790
so that's the beginning of right this
idea of the birth of the heavy elements

6734
02:20:41,790 --> 02:20:41,800
idea of the birth of the heavy elements
 

6735
02:20:41,800 --> 02:20:44,070
idea of the birth of the heavy elements
since they couldn't have been born at

6736
02:20:44,070 --> 02:20:44,080
since they couldn't have been born at
 

6737
02:20:44,080 --> 02:20:45,870
since they couldn't have been born at
the time of the Big Bang conditions of

6738
02:20:45,870 --> 02:20:45,880
the time of the Big Bang conditions of
 

6739
02:20:45,880 --> 02:20:47,630
the time of the Big Bang conditions of
temperature and pressure weren't

6740
02:20:47,630 --> 02:20:47,640
temperature and pressure weren't
 

6741
02:20:47,640 --> 02:20:49,670
temperature and pressure weren't
sufficient to make any significant

6742
02:20:49,670 --> 02:20:49,680
sufficient to make any significant
 

6743
02:20:49,680 --> 02:20:51,950
sufficient to make any significant
quantities of the heavier elements and

6744
02:20:51,950 --> 02:20:51,960
quantities of the heavier elements and
 

6745
02:20:51,960 --> 02:20:54,429
quantities of the heavier elements and
so so that's the beginning but then you

6746
02:20:54,429 --> 02:20:54,439
so so that's the beginning but then you
 

6747
02:20:54,439 --> 02:20:56,910
so so that's the beginning but then you
need some of these stars to explode

6748
02:20:56,910 --> 02:20:56,920
need some of these stars to explode
 

6749
02:20:56,920 --> 02:20:58,990
need some of these stars to explode
right because if those heavy elements

6750
02:20:58,990 --> 02:20:59,000
right because if those heavy elements
 

6751
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,590
right because if those heavy elements
remained forever trapped in the cores of

6752
02:21:01,590 --> 02:21:01,600
remained forever trapped in the cores of
 

6753
02:21:01,600 --> 02:21:04,950
remained forever trapped in the cores of
stars then they would not be available

6754
02:21:04,950 --> 02:21:04,960
stars then they would not be available
 

6755
02:21:04,960 --> 02:21:07,630
stars then they would not be available
for the production of new stars planets

6756
02:21:07,630 --> 02:21:07,640
for the production of new stars planets
 

6757
02:21:07,640 --> 02:21:10,110
for the production of new stars planets
and ultimately life so indeed the

6758
02:21:10,110 --> 02:21:10,120
and ultimately life so indeed the
 

6759
02:21:10,120 --> 02:21:13,750
and ultimately life so indeed the

6761
02:21:13,760 --> 02:21:16,469

a a leading role in this whole

6762
02:21:16,469 --> 02:21:16,479

6837
02:22:57,960 --> 02:22:59,510

02:22:59,510 --> 02:22:59,520
public and I've often found that in
 

6839
02:22:59,520 --> 02:23:01,830
public and I've often found that in
explaining things yeah there's a certain

02:23:01,830 --> 02:23:01,840
explaining things yeah there's a certain
 

6841
02:23:01,840 --> 02:23:03,389
explaining things yeah there's a certain
part that I didn't really understand

6842
02:23:03,389 --> 02:23:03,399
part that I didn't really understand
 

6843
02:23:03,399 --> 02:23:05,030

at the vertex you know you have two
 

6905
02:24:13,640 --> 02:24:15,030
at the vertex you know you have two
particles coming together and then a

6906
02:24:15,030 --> 02:24:15,040
particles coming together and then a
 

6907
02:24:15,040 --> 02:24:16,630

particle going out and then two
 

6909
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:18,510
particle going out and then two
particles coming out again and he'd have

6910
02:24:18,510 --> 02:24:18,520
particles coming out again and he'd have
 

6911
02:24:18,520 --> 02:24:20,389
particles coming out again and he'd have
these rules Associated when there were

6912
02:24:20,389 --> 02:24:20,399
these rules Associated when there were
 

6913
02:24:20,399 --> 02:24:22,110
these rules Associated when there were
vertices and when there were particles

6914
02:24:22,110 --> 02:24:22,120
vertices and when there were particles
 

6915
02:24:22,120 --> 02:24:23,670

splitting off from one another and all
 

6917
02:24:23,680 --> 02:24:25,990
splitting off from one another and all
that and it looked a little bit like a

6918
02:24:25,990 --> 02:24:26,000
that and it looked a little bit like a
 

6919
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,110
that and it looked a little bit like a
bunch of a hodgepodge at first but to

6920
02:24:28,110 --> 02:24:28,120
bunch of a hodgepodge at first but to
 

6921
02:24:28,120 --> 02:24:30,190
bunch of a hodgepodge at first but to
those who learned the rules and

6922
02:24:30,190 --> 02:24:30,200
those who learned the rules and
 

6923
02:24:30,200 --> 02:24:32,630
those who learned the rules and
understood them he you know they they

6924
02:24:32,630 --> 02:24:32,640
understood them he you know they they
 

6925
02:24:32,640 --> 02:24:34,269
understood them he you know they they
saw that you could do these complex

6926
02:24:34,269 --> 02:24:34,279
saw that you could do these complex
 

6927
02:24:34,279 --> 02:24:37,349
saw that you could do these complex
calculations in a much simpler way and

6928
02:24:37,349 --> 02:24:37,359
calculations in a much simpler way and
 

6929
02:24:37,359 --> 02:24:40,150
calculations in a much simpler way and
indeed in some ways Freeman Dyson had an

6930
02:24:40,150 --> 02:24:40,160
indeed in some ways Freeman Dyson had an
 

6931
02:24:40,160 --> 02:24:42,670
indeed in some ways Freeman Dyson had an
even better knck for explaining really

6932
02:24:42,670 --> 02:24:42,680
even better knck for explaining really
 

6933
02:24:42,680 --> 02:24:45,309
even better knck for explaining really
what Quantum electrodynamics actually

6934
02:24:45,309 --> 02:24:45,319
what Quantum electrodynamics actually
 

6935
02:24:45,319 --> 02:24:48,349
what Quantum electrodynamics actually
was but I didn't know Freeman Dyson I I

6936
02:24:48,349 --> 02:24:48,359
was but I didn't know Freeman Dyson I I
 

6937
02:24:48,359 --> 02:24:50,389
was but I didn't know Freeman Dyson I I
knew Fineman maybe he did have a more

6938
02:24:50,389 --> 02:24:50,399
knew Fineman maybe he did have a more
 

6939
02:24:50,399 --> 02:24:52,630
knew Fineman maybe he did have a more
intuitive view of the world than Fineman

6940
02:24:52,630 --> 02:24:52,640
intuitive view of the world than Fineman
 

6941
02:24:52,640 --> 02:24:55,269
intuitive view of the world than Fineman
did but of the people I knew finean was

6942
02:24:55,269 --> 02:24:55,279
did but of the people I knew finean was
 

6943
02:24:55,279 --> 02:24:58,110
did but of the people I knew finean was
the most intuitive most sort of is there

6944
02:24:58,110 --> 02:24:58,120
the most intuitive most sort of is there
 

6945
02:24:58,120 --> 02:25:00,429
the most intuitive most sort of is there
a picture is there a simple way you can

6946
02:25:00,429 --> 02:25:00,439
a picture is there a simple way you can
 

6947
02:25:00,439 --> 02:25:04,190
a picture is there a simple way you can
understand this and in in um in the path

6948

you can figure out the you can get the
 

6953
02:25:08,319 --> 02:25:10,670
you can figure out the you can get the
classical path at least you know for a

baseball or something like that by using
 

6957
02:25:12,600 --> 02:25:15,550
baseball or something like that by using
quantum physics if you want but you know

02:25:15,550 --> 02:25:15,560
quantum physics if you want but you know
 

6959
02:25:15,560 --> 02:25:18,790
quantum physics if you want but you know
in a sense the baseball sniffs out all

6960
02:25:18,790 --> 02:25:18,800
in a sense the baseball sniffs out all
 

6961
02:25:18,800 --> 02:25:20,910
in a sense the baseball sniffs out all
possible paths it goes out to Andromeda

6962
02:25:20,910 --> 02:25:20,920
possible paths it goes out to Andromeda
 

6963
02:25:20,920 --> 02:25:22,510
possible paths it goes out to Andromeda
galaxy and then goes to the to the

6964
02:25:22,510 --> 02:25:22,520
galaxy and then goes to the to the
 

6965
02:25:22,520 --> 02:25:25,469
galaxy and then goes to the to the
batter but the probability of doing that

6966
02:25:25,469 --> 02:25:25,479
batter but the probability of doing that
 

6967
02:25:25,479 --> 02:25:27,670
batter but the probability of doing that
is very very small because tiny little

6968
02:25:27,670 --> 02:25:27,680
is very very small because tiny little
 

6969
02:25:27,680 --> 02:25:30,790
is very very small because tiny little
paths next door to Any Given path cancel

6970
02:25:30,790 --> 02:25:30,800
paths next door to Any Given path cancel
 

6971
02:25:30,800 --> 02:25:34,950
paths next door to Any Given path cancel
out that path and the ones that all add

6972
02:25:34,950 --> 02:25:34,960
out that path and the ones that all add
 

6973
02:25:34,960 --> 02:25:37,550
out that path and the ones that all add
together they they are the ones that are

6974
02:25:37,550 --> 02:25:37,560
together they they are the ones that are
 

6975
02:25:37,560 --> 02:25:39,349
together they they are the ones that are
more likely to be followed and this

6976
02:25:39,349 --> 02:25:39,359
more likely to be followed and this
 

6977
02:25:39,359 --> 02:25:42,429
more likely to be followed and this
actually ties in with font's principle

6978
02:25:42,429 --> 02:25:42,439
actually ties in with font's principle
 

6979
02:25:42,439 --> 02:25:45,309
actually ties in with font's principle
of least action and their ideas and

6980
02:25:45,309 --> 02:25:45,319
of least action and their ideas and
 

6981
02:25:45,319 --> 02:25:47,790
of least action and their ideas and
Optics that go into this as well and and

Optics that go into this as well and and
 

6983
02:25:47,800 --> 02:25:49,670
Optics that go into this as well and and
it just sort of beautifully brings

6984
02:25:49,670 --> 02:25:49,680
it just sort of beautifully brings
 

6985
02:25:49,680 --> 02:25:51,510
it just sort of beautifully brings
everything together but the particle

6986
02:25:51,510 --> 02:25:51,520
everything together but the particle
 

6987
02:25:51,520 --> 02:25:54,230
everything together but the particle
sniffs out all possible paths what a

6988
02:25:54,230 --> 02:25:54,240
sniffs out all possible paths what a
 

6989
02:25:54,240 --> 02:25:56,150
sniffs out all possible paths what a
crazy idea but if you do the mathematics

6990
02:25:56,150 --> 02:25:56,160
crazy idea but if you do the mathematics
 

6991
02:25:56,160 --> 02:25:58,870
crazy idea but if you do the mathematics
associated with that it ends at being

02:25:58,870 --> 02:25:58,880
associated with that it ends at being
 

6993
02:25:58,880 --> 02:26:01,750
associated with that it ends at being
actually useful a useful way of looking

6994
02:26:01,750 --> 02:26:01,760
actually useful a useful way of looking
 

6995
02:26:01,760 --> 02:26:04,110
actually useful a useful way of looking
at the world so you're also I mean you

6996
02:26:04,110 --> 02:26:04,120
at the world so you're also I mean you
 

6997
02:26:04,120 --> 02:26:06,269
at the world so you're also I mean you
you're widely acknowledges I mean

6998
02:26:06,269 --> 02:26:06,279
you're widely acknowledges I mean
 

6999
02:26:06,279 --> 02:26:08,110
you're widely acknowledges I mean
outside of your science work is being

7000
02:26:08,110 --> 02:26:08,120
outside of your science work is being
 

7001
02:26:08,120 --> 02:26:11,230
outside of your science work is being
one of the greatest Educators in the

7002
02:26:11,230 --> 02:26:11,240
one of the greatest Educators in the
 

7003
02:26:11,240 --> 02:26:15,590
one of the greatest Educators in the
world and Fineman is famous yeah for for

7004
02:26:15,590 --> 02:26:15,600
world and Fineman is famous yeah for for
 

7005
02:26:15,600 --> 02:26:17,349
world and Fineman is famous yeah for for
being that is there something about

7006
02:26:17,349 --> 02:26:17,359
being that is there something about
 

7007
02:26:17,359 --> 02:26:19,550
being that is there something about
being a teacher that you've well it's

7008
02:26:19,550 --> 02:26:19,560
being a teacher that you've well it's
 

7009
02:26:19,560 --> 02:26:21,469
being a teacher that you've well it's
it's very very rewarding when you have

7010
02:26:21,469 --> 02:26:21,479
it's very very rewarding when you have
 

7011
02:26:21,479 --> 02:26:23,790
it's very very rewarding when you have
students who are really into it and you

7012
02:26:23,790 --> 02:26:23,800
students who are really into it and you
 

7013
02:26:23,800 --> 02:26:26,790
students who are really into it and you
know going back to Fineman at Caltech I

7014
02:26:26,790 --> 02:26:26,800
know going back to Fineman at Caltech I
 

7015
02:26:26,800 --> 02:26:29,070
know going back to Fineman at Caltech I
was taking these graduate courses and

7016
02:26:29,070 --> 02:26:29,080
was taking these graduate courses and
 

7017
02:26:29,080 --> 02:26:31,510
was taking these graduate courses and
there were two of us myself and Jeff

7018
02:26:31,510 --> 02:26:31,520
there were two of us myself and Jeff
 

7019
02:26:31,520 --> 02:26:33,429
there were two of us myself and Jeff
richond who's now a professor of physics

7020
02:26:33,429 --> 02:26:33,439
richond who's now a professor of physics
 

7021
02:26:33,439 --> 02:26:35,030
richond who's now a professor of physics
at University of California Santa

7022
02:26:35,030 --> 02:26:35,040
at University of California Santa
 

7023
02:26:35,040 --> 02:26:38,269
at University of California Santa
Barbara who asked lots of questions and

7024
02:26:38,269 --> 02:26:38,279
Barbara who asked lots of questions and
 

7025
02:26:38,279 --> 02:26:40,710
Barbara who asked lots of questions and
a lot of the Caltech students are

7026
02:26:40,710 --> 02:26:40,720
a lot of the Caltech students are
 

7027
02:26:40,720 --> 02:26:42,790
a lot of the Caltech students are
nervous about asking questions they they

7028
02:26:42,790 --> 02:26:42,800
nervous about asking questions they they
 

7029
02:26:42,800 --> 02:26:44,870
nervous about asking questions they they
want to save face they seem to think

7030
02:26:44,870 --> 02:26:44,880
want to save face they seem to think
 

7031
02:26:44,880 --> 02:26:47,510
want to save face they seem to think
that if they ask a question their peers

7032
02:26:47,510 --> 02:26:47,520
that if they ask a question their peers
 

7033
02:26:47,520 --> 02:26:49,630
that if they ask a question their peers
might think it's a stupid question well

7034
02:26:49,630 --> 02:26:49,640
might think it's a stupid question well
 

7035
02:26:49,640 --> 02:26:51,349
might think it's a stupid question well
I didn't really care what people thought

7036
02:26:51,349 --> 02:26:51,359
I didn't really care what people thought
 

7037
02:26:51,359 --> 02:26:52,830
I didn't really care what people thought
and Jeff Richmond didn't either and we

7038
02:26:52,830 --> 02:26:52,840
and Jeff Richmond didn't either and we
 

7039
02:26:52,840 --> 02:26:55,550
and Jeff Richmond didn't either and we
ask all these questions and in fact in

7040
02:26:55,550 --> 02:26:55,560
ask all these questions and in fact in
 

7041
02:26:55,560 --> 02:26:56,910
ask all these questions and in fact in
many cases they were quite good

7042
02:26:56,910 --> 02:26:56,920
many cases they were quite good
 

7043
02:26:56,920 --> 02:26:58,670
many cases they were quite good
questions and Fineman said well the rest

7044
02:26:58,670 --> 02:26:58,680
questions and Fineman said well the rest
 

7045
02:26:58,680 --> 02:27:00,389
questions and Fineman said well the rest
of you should be having questions like

7046
02:27:00,389 --> 02:27:00,399
of you should be having questions like
 

7047
02:27:00,399 --> 02:27:02,429
of you should be having questions like
this and I remember one time in

7048
02:27:02,429 --> 02:27:02,439
this and I remember one time in
 

7049
02:27:02,439 --> 02:27:06,190
this and I remember one time in
particular when he said you know he said

7050
02:27:06,190 --> 02:27:06,200
particular when he said you know he said
 

7051
02:27:06,200 --> 02:27:07,349
particular when he said you know he said
to the rest of the class why is it

7052
02:27:07,349 --> 02:27:07,359
to the rest of the class why is it
 

7053
02:27:07,359 --> 02:27:09,830
to the rest of the class why is it
always these two aren't you aren't the

7054

always these two aren't you aren't the
 

7055
02:27:09,840 --> 02:27:11,429
always these two aren't you aren't the
rest of you curious about what I'm

7056
02:27:11,429 --> 02:27:11,439
rest of you curious about what I'm
 

7057
02:27:11,439 --> 02:27:13,670
rest of you curious about what I'm
saying do you really understand it all

7058
02:27:13,670 --> 02:27:13,680
saying do you really understand it all
 

7059
02:27:13,680 --> 02:27:15,990
saying do you really understand it all
that well if so why aren't you asking

7060
02:27:15,990 --> 02:27:16,000
that well if so why aren't you asking
 

7061
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,790
that well if so why aren't you asking
the next most logical question no you

7062
02:27:18,790 --> 02:27:18,800
the next most logical question no you
 

7063
02:27:18,800 --> 02:27:21,030
the next most logical question no you
guys are too scared to ask these

7064
02:27:21,030 --> 02:27:21,040
guys are too scared to ask these
 

7065
02:27:21,040 --> 02:27:23,469
guys are too scared to ask these
questions that these two are asking so

7066
02:27:23,469 --> 02:27:23,479
questions that these two are asking so
 

7067

and had lunch with one of the greatest
 

7073
02:27:30,800 --> 02:27:34,150
and had lunch with one of the greatest
thinkers of 20th century physics and so

7074
02:27:34,150 --> 02:27:34,160
thinkers of 20th century physics and so
 

7075
02:27:34,160 --> 02:27:36,590
thinkers of 20th century physics and so
yeah he he rubbed off on me and so you

7076
02:27:36,590 --> 02:27:36,600
yeah he he rubbed off on me and so you
 

7077
02:27:36,600 --> 02:27:38,429
yeah he he rubbed off on me and so you
encourage questions as well I encourage

7078
02:27:38,429 --> 02:27:38,439
encourage questions as well I encourage
 

7079
02:27:38,439 --> 02:27:41,670
encourage questions as well I encourage
questions you know and uh yeah you know

7080
02:27:41,670 --> 02:27:41,680
questions you know and uh yeah you know
 

7081
02:27:41,680 --> 02:27:44,190
questions you know and uh yeah you know
definitely I mean you know I encourage

7082
02:27:44,190 --> 02:27:44,200
definitely I mean you know I encourage
 

7083
02:27:44,200 --> 02:27:46,550
definitely I mean you know I encourage
questions I I like it when students ask

7084
02:27:46,550 --> 02:27:46,560
questions I I like it when students ask
 

7085
02:27:46,560 --> 02:27:48,429
questions I I like it when students ask
questions I tell them that they

7086
02:27:48,429 --> 02:27:48,439
questions I tell them that they
 

7087
02:27:48,439 --> 02:27:49,910
questions I tell them that they
shouldn't feel shy about asking a

7088
02:27:49,910 --> 02:27:49,920
shouldn't feel shy about asking a
 

7089
02:27:49,920 --> 02:27:51,750
shouldn't feel shy about asking a
question question probably half the

7090
02:27:51,750 --> 02:27:51,760
question question probably half the
 

7091
02:27:51,760 --> 02:27:53,630
question question probably half the
students in the class would have that

7092
02:27:53,630 --> 02:27:53,640
students in the class would have that
 

7093
02:27:53,640 --> 02:27:55,590
students in the class would have that
same question if they even understood

7094
02:27:55,590 --> 02:27:55,600
same question if they even understood
 

7095
02:27:55,600 --> 02:27:58,630
same question if they even understood
the material enough to ask that question

7096
02:27:58,630 --> 02:27:58,640
the material enough to ask that question
 

7097
02:27:58,640 --> 02:28:02,150
the material enough to ask that question
yeah curiosity is the first step of um

7098
02:28:02,150 --> 02:28:02,160
yeah curiosity is the first step of um
 

7099
02:28:02,160 --> 02:28:04,030
yeah curiosity is the first step of um
absolutely of seeing the beauty of

7100
02:28:04,030 --> 02:28:04,040
absolutely of seeing the beauty of
 

7101
02:28:04,040 --> 02:28:06,830
absolutely of seeing the beauty of
something so yeah and the question is

7102
02:28:06,830 --> 02:28:06,840
something so yeah and the question is
 

7103
02:28:06,840 --> 02:28:10,190
something so yeah and the question is
the ultimate form of curiosity yeah let

7104
02:28:10,190 --> 02:28:10,200
the ultimate form of curiosity yeah let
 

7105
02:28:10,200 --> 02:28:13,150
the ultimate form of curiosity yeah let
me ask uh what is the meaning of

7106
02:28:13,150 --> 02:28:13,160
me ask uh what is the meaning of
 

7107
02:28:13,160 --> 02:28:16,349
me ask uh what is the meaning of
life the meaning of life you know from a

7108
02:28:16,349 --> 02:28:16,359
life the meaning of life you know from a
 

7109
02:28:16,359 --> 02:28:18,269
life the meaning of life you know from a
cosmologist perspective or from a human

7110
02:28:18,269 --> 02:28:18,279
cosmologist perspective or from a human
 

7111
02:28:18,279 --> 02:28:20,790
cosmologist perspective or from a human
perspective or from my personal you know

7112
02:28:20,790 --> 02:28:20,800
perspective or from my personal you know
 

7113
02:28:20,800 --> 02:28:23,230
perspective or from my personal you know
life is what you make of it really right

7114
02:28:23,230 --> 02:28:23,240
life is what you make of it really right
 

7115
02:28:23,240 --> 02:28:26,750
life is what you make of it really right
it's um each of us has to have our own

7116
02:28:26,750 --> 02:28:26,760
it's um each of us has to have our own
 

7117
02:28:26,760 --> 02:28:32,030
it's um each of us has to have our own
meaning and it doesn't have to be well I

7118
02:28:32,030 --> 02:28:32,040
meaning and it doesn't have to be well I
 

7119
02:28:32,040 --> 02:28:34,389
meaning and it doesn't have to be well I
I think that in many cases meaning is is

7120
02:28:34,389 --> 02:28:34,399
I think that in many cases meaning is is
 

7121
02:28:34,399 --> 02:28:36,269
I think that in many cases meaning is is
to some degree associated with goals you

7122
02:28:36,269 --> 02:28:36,279
to some degree associated with goals you
 

7123
02:28:36,279 --> 02:28:38,230
to some degree associated with goals you
set some goals or expectations for

7124
02:28:38,230 --> 02:28:38,240
set some goals or expectations for
 

7125
02:28:38,240 --> 02:28:41,030
set some goals or expectations for
yourself things you want to accomplish

7126
02:28:41,030 --> 02:28:41,040
yourself things you want to accomplish
 

7127
02:28:41,040 --> 02:28:43,150
yourself things you want to accomplish
things you want to do U things you want

7128
02:28:43,150 --> 02:28:43,160
things you want to do U things you want
 

7129
02:28:43,160 --> 02:28:46,070
things you want to do U things you want
to experience and to the degree that you

7130
02:28:46,070 --> 02:28:46,080
to experience and to the degree that you
 

7131
02:28:46,080 --> 02:28:48,990
to experience and to the degree that you
experience those and do those things it

7132
02:28:48,990 --> 02:28:49,000
experience those and do those things it
 

7133
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:50,630
experience those and do those things it
can give you meaning

7134
02:28:50,630 --> 02:28:50,640
can give you meaning
 

7135
02:28:50,640 --> 02:28:53,590
can give you meaning
you don't have to change the world the

7136
02:28:53,590 --> 02:28:53,600
you don't have to change the world the
 

7137
02:28:53,600 --> 02:28:56,309
you don't have to change the world the
way Newton or Michelangelo or Da Vinci

7138
02:28:56,309 --> 02:28:56,319
way Newton or Michelangelo or Da Vinci
 

7139
02:28:56,319 --> 02:28:58,150
way Newton or Michelangelo or Da Vinci
did I mean people often say don't change

7140
02:28:58,150 --> 02:28:58,160
did I mean people often say don't change
 

7141
02:28:58,160 --> 02:29:00,110
did I mean people often say don't change
the world but look come on there's seven

7142
02:29:00,110 --> 02:29:00,120
the world but look come on there's seven
 

7143
02:29:00,120 --> 02:29:02,150
the world but look come on there's seven
and a half close to eight billion of us

7144
02:29:02,150 --> 02:29:02,160
and a half close to eight billion of us
 

7145
02:29:02,160 --> 02:29:03,910
and a half close to eight billion of us
now most of us are not going to change

7146
02:29:03,910 --> 02:29:03,920

7147
02:29:03,920 --> 02:29:05,630

the world and does that mean that most

7148
02:29:05,630 --> 02:29:05,640
the world and does that mean that most
 

7149
02:29:05,640 --> 02:29:09,070
the world and does that mean that most
of us are leading meaningful lives no it

7150

of us are leading meaningful lives no it

based on nature which can be very good
 

7161
02:29:22,040 --> 02:29:24,950
based on nature which can be very good
and also very bad but often it's the

not within reach you're in a
 

7189
02:29:58,880 --> 02:30:00,870
not within reach you're in a
socioeconomic position where you can't

to be some profound I'm going to change
 

7199
02:30:11,760 --> 02:30:14,309
to be some profound I'm going to change
the world I'm going to be the one who

7200
02:30:14,309 --> 02:30:14,319
the world I'm going to be the one who
 

7201
02:30:14,319 --> 02:30:15,309
the world I'm going to be the one who
everyone

7202
02:30:15,309 --> 02:30:15,319
everyone
 

7203
02:30:15,319 --> 02:30:18,150
everyone
remembers type thing right in the

7204
02:30:18,150 --> 02:30:18,160
remembers type thing right in the
 

7205
02:30:18,160 --> 02:30:20,030
remembers type thing right in the
context of The Greatest Story Ever Told

7206
02:30:20,030 --> 02:30:20,040
context of The Greatest Story Ever Told
 

7207
02:30:20,040 --> 02:30:24,950
context of The Greatest Story Ever Told
like the fact that we came from

7208
02:30:24,950 --> 02:30:24,960

 

7209
02:30:24,960 --> 02:30:27,950

stars and now we're two Apes asking

7210
02:30:27,950 --> 02:30:27,960
stars and now we're two Apes asking
 

7211
02:30:27,960 --> 02:30:30,349
stars and now we're two Apes asking
about the meaning of life yeah how does

7212
02:30:30,349 --> 02:30:30,359
about the meaning of life yeah how does
 

7213
02:30:30,359 --> 02:30:32,389
about the meaning of life yeah how does
that fit

7214
02:30:32,389 --> 02:30:32,399
that fit
 

7215
02:30:32,399 --> 02:30:34,389
that fit
together does that make any sense you

7216
02:30:34,389 --> 02:30:34,399
together does that make any sense you
 

7217
02:30:34,399 --> 02:30:36,550
together does that make any sense you
know it does it does and this is sort of

7218
02:30:36,550 --> 02:30:36,560
know it does it does and this is sort of
 

7219
02:30:36,560 --> 02:30:39,269
know it does it does and this is sort of
what I I was referring to that it's a

7220
02:30:39,269 --> 02:30:39,279
what I I was referring to that it's a
 

7221
02:30:39,279 --> 02:30:43,710
what I I was referring to that it's a
beautiful universe that allows us to

7222
02:30:43,710 --> 02:30:43,720
beautiful universe that allows us to
 

7223
02:30:43,720 --> 02:30:47,830
beautiful universe that allows us to
come into creation right it's a way that

7224
02:30:47,830 --> 02:30:47,840
come into creation right it's a way that
 

7225
02:30:47,840 --> 02:30:50,429
come into creation right it's a way that
the Universe found of knowing

7226
02:30:50,429 --> 02:30:50,439
the Universe found of knowing
 

7227
02:30:50,439 --> 02:30:52,870
the Universe found of knowing
of understanding itself because I don't

7228
02:30:52,870 --> 02:30:52,880
of understanding itself because I don't
 

7229
02:30:52,880 --> 02:30:55,469
of understanding itself because I don't
think that you know inanimate rocks and

7230
02:30:55,469 --> 02:30:55,479
think that you know inanimate rocks and
 

7231
02:30:55,479 --> 02:30:58,190
think that you know inanimate rocks and
stars and black holes and things have

7232
02:30:58,190 --> 02:30:58,200
stars and black holes and things have
 

7233
02:30:58,200 --> 02:31:01,830
stars and black holes and things have
any real capability of of abstract

7234
02:31:01,830 --> 02:31:01,840
any real capability of of abstract
 

7235
02:31:01,840 --> 02:31:05,590
any real capability of of abstract
thoughts and of learning about the rest

7236
02:31:05,590 --> 02:31:05,600
thoughts and of learning about the rest
 

7237
02:31:05,600 --> 02:31:08,469
thoughts and of learning about the rest
of the universe or or even their Origins

7238
02:31:08,469 --> 02:31:08,479
of the universe or or even their Origins
 

7239
02:31:08,479 --> 02:31:09,790
of the universe or or even their Origins
I mean they're just they're just a pile

7240
02:31:09,790 --> 02:31:09,800
I mean they're just they're just a pile
 

7241
02:31:09,800 --> 02:31:14,190
I mean they're just they're just a pile
of atoms that's that's has no conscience

7242
02:31:14,190 --> 02:31:14,200
of atoms that's that's has no conscience
 

7243
02:31:14,200 --> 02:31:16,790
of atoms that's that's has no conscience
has no ability to think has no ability

7244
02:31:16,790 --> 02:31:16,800
has no ability to think has no ability
 

7245
02:31:16,800 --> 02:31:20,910
has no ability to think has no ability
to explore and we do

7246
02:31:20,910 --> 02:31:20,920
to explore and we do
 

7247
02:31:20,920 --> 02:31:23,950
to explore and we do
and you know I'm not saying we're the

7248
02:31:23,950 --> 02:31:23,960
and you know I'm not saying we're the
 

7249
02:31:23,960 --> 02:31:26,630
and you know I'm not saying we're the
epitome of all life forever but at least

7250
02:31:26,630 --> 02:31:26,640
epitome of all life forever but at least
 

7251
02:31:26,640 --> 02:31:29,950
epitome of all life forever but at least
for life on Earth so far the evidence

7252
02:31:29,950 --> 02:31:29,960
for life on Earth so far the evidence
 

7253
02:31:29,960 --> 02:31:32,590
for life on Earth so far the evidence
suggests that we are the epitome in

7254
02:31:32,590 --> 02:31:32,600
suggests that we are the epitome in
 

7255
02:31:32,600 --> 02:31:35,990
suggests that we are the epitome in
terms of the richness of our thoughts

7256
02:31:35,990 --> 02:31:36,000
terms of the richness of our thoughts
 

7257
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:37,830
terms of the richness of our thoughts
the degree to which we can explore the

7258
02:31:37,830 --> 02:31:37,840
the degree to which we can explore the
 

7259
02:31:37,840 --> 02:31:40,950
the degree to which we can explore the
universe do experiments build

7260
02:31:40,950 --> 02:31:40,960
universe do experiments build
 

7261
02:31:40,960 --> 02:31:43,309
universe do experiments build
machines understand our Origins and I

7262
02:31:43,309 --> 02:31:43,319
machines understand our Origins and I
 

7263
02:31:43,319 --> 02:31:47,510
machines understand our Origins and I
just hope that we use science for good

7264
02:31:47,510 --> 02:31:47,520
just hope that we use science for good
 

7265
02:31:47,520 --> 02:31:49,910
just hope that we use science for good
not evil and that we don't end up

7266
02:31:49,910 --> 02:31:49,920
not evil and that we don't end up
 

7267
02:31:49,920 --> 02:31:51,190
not evil and that we don't end up
destroying ourselves I mean the whales

7268
02:31:51,190 --> 02:31:51,200
destroying ourselves I mean the whales
 

7269
02:31:51,200 --> 02:31:53,950
destroying ourselves I mean the whales
and dolphins are plenty intelligent

7270
02:31:53,950 --> 02:31:53,960
and dolphins are plenty intelligent
 

7271
02:31:53,960 --> 02:31:56,790
and dolphins are plenty intelligent
they're they don't ask abstract

7272
02:31:56,790 --> 02:31:56,800
they're they don't ask abstract
 

7273
02:31:56,800 --> 02:31:58,630
they're they don't ask abstract
questions they don't read books but on

7274
02:31:58,630 --> 02:31:58,640
questions they don't read books but on
 

7275
02:31:58,640 --> 02:32:00,590
questions they don't read books but on
the other hand they're not in any danger

7276
02:32:00,590 --> 02:32:00,600
the other hand they're not in any danger
 

7277
02:32:00,600 --> 02:32:02,269
the other hand they're not in any danger
of destroying themselves and everything

7278
02:32:02,269 --> 02:32:02,279
of destroying themselves and everything
 

7279
02:32:02,279 --> 02:32:04,630
of destroying themselves and everything
else as well and so maybe maybe that's a

7280
02:32:04,630 --> 02:32:04,640
else as well and so maybe maybe that's a
 

7281
02:32:04,640 --> 02:32:07,070
else as well and so maybe maybe that's a
better form of intelligence but at least

7282
02:32:07,070 --> 02:32:07,080
better form of intelligence but at least
 

7283
02:32:07,080 --> 02:32:10,349
better form of intelligence but at least
in terms of our ability to explore and

7284
02:32:10,349 --> 02:32:10,359
in terms of our ability to explore and
 

7285
02:32:10,359 --> 02:32:15,110
in terms of our ability to explore and
make use of our minds I mean to me it

7286
02:32:15,110 --> 02:32:15,120
make use of our minds I mean to me it
 

7287
02:32:15,120 --> 02:32:19,190
make use of our minds I mean to me it
it's this it it's this that gives me um

7288
02:32:19,190 --> 02:32:19,200
it's this it it's this that gives me um
 

7289
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:21,910
it's this it it's this that gives me um
the potential for meaning yeah right the

7290
02:32:21,910 --> 02:32:21,920
the potential for meaning yeah right the
 

7291
02:32:21,920 --> 02:32:24,469
the potential for meaning yeah right the
fact that I can understand and explore

7292
02:32:24,469 --> 02:32:24,479
fact that I can understand and explore
 

7293
02:32:24,479 --> 02:32:25,990
fact that I can understand and explore
it's kind of fascinating to think that

7294
02:32:25,990 --> 02:32:26,000
it's kind of fascinating to think that
 

7295
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:29,349
it's kind of fascinating to think that
the universe created

7296
02:32:29,349 --> 02:32:29,359

 

7297
02:32:29,359 --> 02:32:32,510

us and eventually we've built telescopes

7298
02:32:32,510 --> 02:32:32,520
us and eventually we've built telescopes
 

7299
02:32:32,520 --> 02:32:34,990
us and eventually we've built telescopes
to look back at it to look back at its

7300
02:32:34,990 --> 02:32:35,000
to look back at it to look back at its

seemingly inconsequential things like
the mass ratio of the proton and the

the mass ratio of the proton and the
 

7319

it turns out you play with things a
 

7325
02:33:02,840 --> 02:33:04,510
it turns out you play with things a
little bit like the ratio of the mass of

of a Multiverse that you know that the

most the universes are are boring and
 

7357
02:33:44,080 --> 02:33:46,230
most the universes are are boring and
some might be more interesting but we

7358
02:33:46,230 --> 02:33:46,240
some might be more interesting but we
 

7359
02:33:46,240 --> 02:33:49,110
some might be more interesting but we
are in The Rare Breed that's really

7360
02:33:49,110 --> 02:33:49,120
are in The Rare Breed that's really
 

7361
02:33:49,120 --> 02:33:52,150
are in The Rare Breed that's really
quite darn interesting and if there were

7362
02:33:52,150 --> 02:33:52,160
quite darn interesting and if there were
 

7363
02:33:52,160 --> 02:33:54,469
