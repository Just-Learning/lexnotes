00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,909

naively I certainly thought that all

2
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:02,919
naively I certainly thought that all
 

3
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:05,789
naively I certainly thought that all
humans would have words for exact

4
00:00:05,789 --> 00:00:05,799
humans would have words for exact
 

5
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:08,790
humans would have words for exact
counting uh and the Paha don't okay so

6
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:08,800
counting uh and the Paha don't okay so
 

7
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,509
counting uh and the Paha don't okay so
they don't have any words for even one

8
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:11,519
they don't have any words for even one
 

9
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,589
they don't have any words for even one
there's not a word for one in their

10
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:13,599
there's not a word for one in their
 

11
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,190
there's not a word for one in their
language and so there's certainly not a

12
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:15,200
language and so there's certainly not a
 

13
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,150
language and so there's certainly not a
word for two three or four so that kind

14
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:17,160
word for two three or four so that kind
 

15
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,310
word for two three or four so that kind
of blows people's minds often yeah that

16
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:19,320
of blows people's minds often yeah that
 

17
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,990
of blows people's minds often yeah that
blowing my mind that's pretty weird how

18
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:21,000
blowing my mind that's pretty weird how
 

19
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,590
blowing my mind that's pretty weird how
are you how are you going to ask I want

20
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:22,600
are you how are you going to ask I want
 

21
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,830
are you how are you going to ask I want
two of those you just don't and so

22
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:24,840
two of those you just don't and so
 

23
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,830
two of those you just don't and so
that's just not a thing you can possibly

24
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:26,840
that's just not a thing you can possibly
 

25
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,950
that's just not a thing you can possibly
ask in the P it's not possible that is

26
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:28,960
ask in the P it's not possible that is
 

27
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,269
ask in the P it's not possible that is
there is no words for that

sentences in English grammar I I I found

66
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:24,240
sentences in English grammar I I I found
 

67
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,950
sentences in English grammar I I I found
that process interesting I found it

68
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:26,960
that process interesting I found it
 

69
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,030
that process interesting I found it
confusing as to what it was I was told

70
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,040
confusing as to what it was I was told
 

71
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,270
confusing as to what it was I was told
to do I didn't didn't didn't understand

72
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:31,280
to do I didn't didn't didn't understand
 

73
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,670
to do I didn't didn't didn't understand
what the theory was behind it but I

74
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:33,680
what the theory was behind it but I
 

75
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,069
what the theory was behind it but I
found it very interesting so when you

76
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:35,079
found it very interesting so when you
 

77
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,429
found it very interesting so when you
look at grammar you're almost thinking

78
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:36,439
look at grammar you're almost thinking
 

79
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:38,230
look at grammar you're almost thinking
about like a puzzle like almost like a

80
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
about like a puzzle like almost like a
 

81
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,190
about like a puzzle like almost like a
mathematical puzzle yeah I think that's

82
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:40,200
mathematical puzzle yeah I think that's
 

83
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,429
mathematical puzzle yeah I think that's
right I didn't know I was going to work

84
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
right I didn't know I was going to work
 

85
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,950
right I didn't know I was going to work
on this at all at that point I was

86
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:42,960
on this at all at that point I was
 

87
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,830
on this at all at that point I was
really just I was kind of a math geek

88
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:45,840
really just I was kind of a math geek
 

89
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,830
really just I was kind of a math geek
person computer scientist I really liked

90
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:47,840
person computer scientist I really liked
 

91
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,990
person computer scientist I really liked
computer science and then I found

92
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:50,000
computer science and then I found
 

93
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,030
computer science and then I found
language as a a neat puzzle to work on

94
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:54,040
language as a a neat puzzle to work on
 

95
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,350
language as a a neat puzzle to work on
from an engineering perspective actually

96
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:56,360
from an engineering perspective actually
 

97
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,870
from an engineering perspective actually
that's what I as a I I sort of

98
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:58,880
that's what I as a I I sort of
 

99
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,789
that's what I as a I I sort of
accidentally well I decided after I

100
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:01,799
accidentally well I decided after I
 

101
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,749
accidentally well I decided after I
finished my undergraduate degree which

102
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:03,759
finished my undergraduate degree which
 

103
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,789
finished my undergraduate degree which
was computer science and math and Canada

104
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:05,799
was computer science and math and Canada
 

105
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:08,510
was computer science and math and Canada
and Queens University I decided to go to

106
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:08,520
and Queens University I decided to go to
 

107
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,109
and Queens University I decided to go to
grad school it's like that's what I

108
00:02:10,109 --> 00:02:10,119
grad school it's like that's what I
 

109
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:12,630
grad school it's like that's what I
always thought I would do and I went to

110
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:12,640
always thought I would do and I went to
 

111
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,430
always thought I would do and I went to
Cambridge where they had a master's in a

112
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:15,440
Cambridge where they had a master's in a
 

113
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,949
Cambridge where they had a master's in a
master's program in computational

114
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:16,959
master's program in computational
 

115
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,309
master's program in computational
linguistics and I hadn't taken a single

116
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:20,319
linguistics and I hadn't taken a single
 

117
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,190
linguistics and I hadn't taken a single
language class before all I had taken

118
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:22,200
language class before all I had taken
 

119
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,430
language class before all I had taken
was CS computer science math classes

120
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:24,440
was CS computer science math classes
 

121
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,350
was CS computer science math classes
pretty much mostly as an undergrad and I

122
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:27,360
pretty much mostly as an undergrad and I
 

123
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,910
pretty much mostly as an undergrad and I
just oh this was an interesting thing to

124
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:28,920
just oh this was an interesting thing to
 

125
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,390
just oh this was an interesting thing to
do for a year

126
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,400
do for a year
 

127
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,509
do for a year
because it was a single year program and

128
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:33,519
because it was a single year program and
 

129
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,070
because it was a single year program and
um then I ended up spending my whole

130
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:35,080
um then I ended up spending my whole
 

131
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,949
um then I ended up spending my whole
life doing it so fundamentally your

132
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:36,959
life doing it so fundamentally your
 

133
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,750
life doing it so fundamentally your
journey through life was one of a

134
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:38,760
journey through life was one of a
 

135
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,910
journey through life was one of a
mathematician and a computer scientist

136
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:40,920
mathematician and a computer scientist
 

137
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,869
mathematician and a computer scientist
and then you kind of discovered the

138
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:42,879
and then you kind of discovered the
 

139
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,550
and then you kind of discovered the
puzzle the problem of language and

140
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:45,560
puzzle the problem of language and
 

141
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,470
puzzle the problem of language and
approached it from that angle uh to try

142
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:48,480
approached it from that angle uh to try
 

143
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,390
approached it from that angle uh to try
to understand it from that angle almost

144
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:50,400
to understand it from that angle almost
 

145
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,790
to understand it from that angle almost
like a mathematician or maybe even an

146
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:52,800
like a mathematician or maybe even an
 

147
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,630
like a mathematician or maybe even an
engineer as an engineer I'd say I mean

148
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:55,640
engineer as an engineer I'd say I mean
 

149
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,589
engineer as an engineer I'd say I mean
to be frank I had taken an AI class I

150
00:02:58,589 --> 00:02:58,599
to be frank I had taken an AI class I
 

151
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,790
to be frank I had taken an AI class I
guess it was 83 or 84 5 somewhere 84 in

152
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:00,800
guess it was 83 or 84 5 somewhere 84 in
 

153
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,470
guess it was 83 or 84 5 somewhere 84 in
there a long time ago and there was a

154
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,480
there a long time ago and there was a
 

155
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,149
there a long time ago and there was a
natural language section in there and it

156
00:03:05,149 --> 00:03:05,159
natural language section in there and it
 

157
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:07,789
natural language section in there and it
didn't impress me I thought there must

158
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:07,799
didn't impress me I thought there must
 

159
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:09,830
didn't impress me I thought there must
be more interesting things we can do

160
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840
be more interesting things we can do
 

161
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,070
be more interesting things we can do
didn't it didn't seem very it seemed

162
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,080
didn't it didn't seem very it seemed
 

163
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,110
didn't it didn't seem very it seemed
just a bunch of uh hacks to me it didn't

164
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,120
just a bunch of uh hacks to me it didn't
 

165
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,470
just a bunch of uh hacks to me it didn't
seem like a real theory of things in any

166
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:17,480
seem like a real theory of things in any
 

167
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,949
seem like a real theory of things in any
way and so I just thought this was this

168
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:18,959
way and so I just thought this was this
 

169
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,869
way and so I just thought this was this
seemed like an interesting area where

170
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:21,879
seemed like an interesting area where
 

171
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:24,070
seemed like an interesting area where
there wasn't enough good work did you

172
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,080
there wasn't enough good work did you
 

173
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,670
there wasn't enough good work did you
ever come across like the the philosophy

174
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:26,680
ever come across like the the philosophy
 

175
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,710
ever come across like the the philosophy
angle of logic so if you think about the

176
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:28,720
angle of logic so if you think about the
 

177
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,869
angle of logic so if you think about the
80s with AI the expert systems where you

178
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:30,879
80s with AI the expert systems where you
 

179
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,390
80s with AI the expert systems where you
try to kind

180
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:32,400
try to kind
 

181
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,990
try to kind
of uh maybe sidestep the The Poetry of

182
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,000
of uh maybe sidestep the The Poetry of
 

183
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,070
of uh maybe sidestep the The Poetry of
language and some of the syntax and the

184
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,080
language and some of the syntax and the
 

185
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,949
language and some of the syntax and the
grammar and all that kind of stuff and

186
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:39,959
grammar and all that kind of stuff and
 

187
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,910
grammar and all that kind of stuff and
go to the underlying meaning that

188
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:41,920
go to the underlying meaning that
 

189
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,390
go to the underlying meaning that
language is trying to communicate and

190
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:43,400
language is trying to communicate and
 

191
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,270
language is trying to communicate and
try to somehow compress that in a

192
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:46,280
try to somehow compress that in a
 

193
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,550
try to somehow compress that in a
computer representable way did you ever

194
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:48,560
computer representable way did you ever
 

195
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,390
computer representable way did you ever
come across that in your studies I mean

196
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:50,400
come across that in your studies I mean
 

197
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,390
come across that in your studies I mean
I probably did but I wasn't as

198
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:52,400
I probably did but I wasn't as
 

199
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,390
I probably did but I wasn't as
interested in it I was I was trying to

200
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,400
interested in it I was I was trying to
 

201
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,550
interested in it I was I was trying to
do the easier problems first the ones I

202
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:56,560
do the easier problems first the ones I
 

203
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,869
do the easier problems first the ones I
could thought maybe were handleable

204
00:03:58,869 --> 00:03:58,879
could thought maybe were handleable
 

205
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,750
could thought maybe were handleable
which is seems like the syntax is easier

206
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:01,760
which is seems like the syntax is easier
 

207
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,550
which is seems like the syntax is easier
like which is just the forms as opposed

208
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:03,560
like which is just the forms as opposed
 

209
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,830
like which is just the forms as opposed
to the meaning like you're talking when

210
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:04,840
to the meaning like you're talking when
 

211
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,589
to the meaning like you're talking when
you're starting talking about the

212
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:05,599
you're starting talking about the
 

213
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,550
you're starting talking about the
meaning that's very hard problem and

214
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:07,560
meaning that's very hard problem and
 

215
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,750
meaning that's very hard problem and
it's still is a really really hard

216
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:08,760
it's still is a really really hard
 

217
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,390
it's still is a really really hard
problem but the forms is is easier and

218
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:11,400
problem but the forms is is easier and
 

219
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,630
problem but the forms is is easier and
so I thought at least figuring out the

220
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:13,640
so I thought at least figuring out the
 

221
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,629
so I thought at least figuring out the
forms of human language which sounds

222
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:16,639
forms of human language which sounds
 

223
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,509
forms of human language which sounds
really hard but is actually maybe more

224
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:18,519
really hard but is actually maybe more
 

225
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,310
really hard but is actually maybe more
attractable so it's interesting you

226
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,320
attractable so it's interesting you
 

227
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,950
attractable so it's interesting you
think there is a big divide there's a

228
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:22,960
think there is a big divide there's a
 

229
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,710
think there is a big divide there's a
gap there's a distance between form and

230
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:25,720
gap there's a distance between form and
 

231
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,150
gap there's a distance between form and
meaning because that's a question you

232
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,160
meaning because that's a question you
 

233
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,590
meaning because that's a question you
have discussed a lot with llms mhm

234
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:31,600
have discussed a lot with llms mhm
 

235
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,110
have discussed a lot with llms mhm
because they're damn good at form yeah I

236
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:34,120
because they're damn good at form yeah I
 

237
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,189
because they're damn good at form yeah I
think that's what they're good at is

238
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:35,199
think that's what they're good at is
 

239
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,790
think that's what they're good at is
form exactly and that's that's why

240
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:36,800
form exactly and that's that's why
 

241
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,070
form exactly and that's that's why
they're good because they can do form

242
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,080
they're good because they can do form
 

243
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,790
they're good because they can do form
meanings hard do you think there's oh

244
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:40,800
meanings hard do you think there's oh
 

245
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,469
meanings hard do you think there's oh
wow and I mean it's an open question

246
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:42,479
wow and I mean it's an open question
 

247
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,110
wow and I mean it's an open question
right yeah how close form and meaning

248
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:44,120
right yeah how close form and meaning
 

249
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,230
right yeah how close form and meaning
are we'll discuss it but I to me

250
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:47,240
are we'll discuss it but I to me
 

251
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,909
are we'll discuss it but I to me
studying form maybe it's a romantic

252
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:49,919
studying form maybe it's a romantic
 

253
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,350
studying form maybe it's a romantic
notion gives you form is like the

254
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:53,360
notion gives you form is like the
 

255
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,830
notion gives you form is like the
shadow of the the bigger meaning thing

256
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:56,840
shadow of the the bigger meaning thing
 

257
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,310
shadow of the the bigger meaning thing
underlying language CU I it form is is

258
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:01,320
underlying language CU I it form is is
 

259
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,590
underlying language CU I it form is is
language is how we communicate ideas we

260
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:03,600
language is how we communicate ideas we
 

261
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,629
language is how we communicate ideas we
communicate with each other using

262
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:04,639
communicate with each other using
 

263
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,670
communicate with each other using
language so in understanding the

264
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:06,680
language so in understanding the
 

265
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,430
language so in understanding the
structure of that communication I think

266
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,440
structure of that communication I think
 

267
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,469
structure of that communication I think
you start to understand the structure of

268
00:05:11,469 --> 00:05:11,479
you start to understand the structure of
 

269
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:12,749
you start to understand the structure of
thought and the structure of meaning

270
00:05:12,749 --> 00:05:12,759
thought and the structure of meaning
 

271
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:15,950
thought and the structure of meaning
behind those thoughts and communication

272
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:15,960
behind those thoughts and communication
 

273
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,189
behind those thoughts and communication
to me but to you big gap yeah what do

274
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:20,199
to me but to you big gap yeah what do
 

275
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:22,110
to me but to you big gap yeah what do
you find most beautiful about human

276
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:22,120
you find most beautiful about human
 

277
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,430
you find most beautiful about human
language maybe the form of human

278
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:25,440
language maybe the form of human
 

279
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,909
language maybe the form of human
language the expression of human

280
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:26,919
language the expression of human
 

281
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:29,790
language the expression of human
language what I find beautiful about

282
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:29,800
language what I find beautiful about
 

283
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,510
language what I find beautiful about
human language is the uh some of the

284
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:32,520
human language is the uh some of the
 

285
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,950
human language is the uh some of the
generalizations that um happen across

286
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:34,960
generalizations that um happen across
 

287
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,790
generalizations that um happen across
the human languages within and across a

288
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:36,800
the human languages within and across a
 

289
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,070
the human languages within and across a
language so let me give you an example

290
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:39,080
language so let me give you an example
 

291
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,350
language so let me give you an example
of something which I find kind of

292
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360
of something which I find kind of
 

293
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,270
of something which I find kind of
remarkable that is if like a language if

294
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:44,280
remarkable that is if like a language if
 

295
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,909
remarkable that is if like a language if
it has um a word order such that the

296
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:47,919
it has um a word order such that the
 

297
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,390
it has um a word order such that the
verbs tend to come before they're

298
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:49,400
verbs tend to come before they're
 

299
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,070
verbs tend to come before they're
objects and so that's like English does

300
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:51,080
objects and so that's like English does
 

301
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,270
objects and so that's like English does
that so we have the the first the

302
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,280
that so we have the the first the
 

303
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,590
that so we have the the first the
subject comes first in a in a simple

304
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:55,600
subject comes first in a in a simple
 

305
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,550
subject comes first in a in a simple
sentence so I say uh you know the the

306
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:58,560
sentence so I say uh you know the the
 

307
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,510
sentence so I say uh you know the the
dog chased the cat or or Mary kicked the

308
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:00,520
dog chased the cat or or Mary kicked the
 

309
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,590
dog chased the cat or or Mary kicked the
ball so the subject's first the and then

310
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:02,600
ball so the subject's first the and then
 

311
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,870
ball so the subject's first the and then
after the subject there's the verb and

312
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:04,880
after the subject there's the verb and
 

313
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,029
after the subject there's the verb and
then we have objects all these things

314
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:07,039
then we have objects all these things
 

315
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,749
then we have objects all these things
come after in English so it's a it's

316
00:06:08,749 --> 00:06:08,759
come after in English so it's a it's
 

317
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,469
come after in English so it's a it's
generally a verb and most of the stuff

318

327
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,710
to say that come after and and and
there's a lot of languages like that

328
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:17,720
there's a lot of languages like that
 

329
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,790
there's a lot of languages like that
about 40% of the languages of the world

330
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:19,800
about 40% of the languages of the world
 

331
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,510
about 40% of the languages of the world
are look like that they're um sub

332
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:22,520
are look like that they're um sub
 

333
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,230
are look like that they're um sub
subject verb object languages and then

334
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:25,240
subject verb object languages and then
 

335
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,589
subject verb object languages and then
um these languages tend to have um

336
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:28,599
um these languages tend to have um
 

337
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:31,830
um these languages tend to have um
prepositions these little markers on the

338
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:31,840
prepositions these little markers on the
 

339
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,029
prepositions these little markers on the
nouns that that connect nouns to other

340
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:35,039
nouns that that connect nouns to other
 

341
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,390
nouns that that connect nouns to other
nouns or nouns to verbs so I when I so

342
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:37,400
nouns or nouns to verbs so I when I so
 

343
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,589
nouns or nouns to verbs so I when I so
verb like sorry preposition like in or

344
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:39,599
verb like sorry preposition like in or
 

345
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,830
verb like sorry preposition like in or
on or of or about I say I talk about

346
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:42,840
on or of or about I say I talk about
 

347
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,909
on or of or about I say I talk about
something the something is the object of

348
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:44,919
something the something is the object of
 

349
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:46,790
something the something is the object of
that preposition that we have these

350
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:46,800
that preposition that we have these
 

351
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,150
that preposition that we have these
little markers come also just like verbs

352
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:49,160
little markers come also just like verbs
 

353
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,029
little markers come also just like verbs
they come before their their nouns okay

354
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:52,039
they come before their their nouns okay
 

355
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:53,309
they come before their their nouns okay
and then so now we look at other

356
00:06:53,309 --> 00:06:53,319
and then so now we look at other
 

357
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:56,629
and then so now we look at other
languages that like Japanese or or Hindi

358
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:56,639
languages that like Japanese or or Hindi
 

359
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,270
languages that like Japanese or or Hindi
or some these are these are so-called

360
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:58,280
or some these are these are so-called
 

361
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,270
or some these are these are so-called
verb final languages

362
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:00,280
verb final languages
 

363
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,830
verb final languages
those as about maybe a little more than

364
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:02,840
those as about maybe a little more than
 

365
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,670
those as about maybe a little more than
40% maybe 45% of the world's languages

366
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:05,680
40% maybe 45% of the world's languages
 

367
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,029
40% maybe 45% of the world's languages
or more I mean 50% of the world's

368
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:07,039
or more I mean 50% of the world's
 

369
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,550
or more I mean 50% of the world's
languages are verb final those tend to

370
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:09,560
languages are verb final those tend to
 

371
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,270
languages are verb final those tend to
be um post positions those markers the

372
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
be um post positions those markers the
 

373
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,589
be um post positions those markers the
same we have the states have the same

374
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:14,599
same we have the states have the same
 

375
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:17,550
same we have the states have the same
kinds of markers as we do in English but

376
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:17,560
kinds of markers as we do in English but
 

377
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,350
kinds of markers as we do in English but
they put them after so uh uh sorry they

378
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:20,360
they put them after so uh uh sorry they
 

379
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,390
they put them after so uh uh sorry they
put them uh first the markers come first

380
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:22,400
put them uh first the markers come first
 

381
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,469
put them uh first the markers come first
so you say instead of um you know talk

382
00:07:25,469 --> 00:07:25,479
so you say instead of um you know talk
 

383
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:28,909
so you say instead of um you know talk
about a book you say book about the

384
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:28,919
about a book you say book about the
 

385
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:31,990
about a book you say book about the
opposite order there in Japanese or in

386
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,000
opposite order there in Japanese or in
 

387
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,309
opposite order there in Japanese or in
Hindi you do the opposite and and the

388
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:34,319
Hindi you do the opposite and and the
 

389
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,070
Hindi you do the opposite and and the
talk comes at the end so the verb will

390
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,080
talk comes at the end so the verb will
 

391
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,629
talk comes at the end so the verb will
come at the end as well so instead of um

392
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:38,639
come at the end as well so instead of um
 

393
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,909
come at the end as well so instead of um
Mary kicked the ball it's Mary uh Ball

394
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:41,919
Mary kicked the ball it's Mary uh Ball
 

395
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,790
Mary kicked the ball it's Mary uh Ball
kicked and then uh says Mary kicked the

396
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:44,800
kicked and then uh says Mary kicked the
 

397
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,270
kicked and then uh says Mary kicked the
ball to John it's John two the two

398
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:48,280
ball to John it's John two the two
 

399
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,990
ball to John it's John two the two
little the marker there uh the

400
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,000
little the marker there uh the
 

401
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,790
little the marker there uh the
preposition it's a postposition in these

402
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:51,800
preposition it's a postposition in these
 

403
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,469
preposition it's a postposition in these
languages and so the interesting thing

404
00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:53,479
languages and so the interesting thing
 

405
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:56,830
languages and so the interesting thing
fascinating thing to me is that within a

406
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:56,840
fascinating thing to me is that within a
 

407
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,950
fascinating thing to me is that within a
language this order

408
00:07:59,950 --> 00:07:59,960
language this order
 

409
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,230
language this order
aligns it's

410
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:01,240
aligns it's
 

411
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,670
aligns it's
harmonic and so if it's one or the other

412
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:04,680
harmonic and so if it's one or the other
 

413
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,589
harmonic and so if it's one or the other
it's either verb initial or verb final

414
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:06,599
it's either verb initial or verb final
 

415
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,309
it's either verb initial or verb final
but then you then you'll have

416
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:08,319
but then you then you'll have
 

417
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,790
but then you then you'll have
prepositions prepositions or

418
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:09,800
prepositions prepositions or
 

419
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,710
prepositions prepositions or
postpositions and so that and that's

420
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:11,720
postpositions and so that and that's
 

421
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,710
postpositions and so that and that's
across the languages that we we can look

422
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:13,720
across the languages that we we can look
 

423
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,670
across the languages that we we can look
at we' got around a thousand languages

424
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:15,680
at we' got around a thousand languages
 

425
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,749
at we' got around a thousand languages
for for there's around 7,000 languages

426
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:17,759
for for there's around 7,000 languages
 

427
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,270
for for there's around 7,000 languages
around on on the Earth right now uh but

428
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:20,280
around on on the Earth right now uh but
 

429
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,149
around on on the Earth right now uh but
we have information about say word order

430
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:23,159
we have information about say word order
 

431
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:25,550
we have information about say word order
on around a thousand of those pretty

432
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:25,560
on around a thousand of those pretty
 

433
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,469
on around a thousand of those pretty
decent amount of information and for

434
00:08:27,469 --> 00:08:27,479
decent amount of information and for
 

435
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:30,149
decent amount of information and for
those thousand which we know about um

436
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:30,159
those thousand which we know about um
 

437
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:33,430
those thousand which we know about um
about 95% fit that pattern so they will

438
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:33,440
about 95% fit that pattern so they will
 

439
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,269
about 95% fit that pattern so they will
have either verb so about it's about

440
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:35,279
have either verb so about it's about
 

441
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,550
have either verb so about it's about
half and half half a verb initial like

442
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:37,560
half and half half a verb initial like
 

443
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,630
half and half half a verb initial like
English and half a verb final like um

444
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:40,640
English and half a verb final like um
 

445
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,909
English and half a verb final like um
like Japanese so just to clarify verb

446
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:42,919
like Japanese so just to clarify verb
 

447
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,350
like Japanese so just to clarify verb
initial is subject verb object that's

00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:45,360
initial is subject verb object that's
 

449
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,190
initial is subject verb object that's
correct verb final is still subject

450
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:49,200

fascinating is there are these

474
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:14,200
fascinating is there are these
 

475
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,389
fascinating is there are these
generalizations within and across a

476
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:16,399
generalizations within and across a
 

477
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,630
generalizations within and across a
language and and not only those are the

478
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:18,640
language and and not only those are the
 

479
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,310
language and and not only those are the
and there's actually a simple

480
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:20,320
and there's actually a simple
 

481
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,829
and there's actually a simple
explanation I think for a lot of that

482
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:22,839
explanation I think for a lot of that
 

483
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:26,470
explanation I think for a lot of that
and that is um you're trying to like

484
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:26,480
and that is um you're trying to like
 

485
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,550
and that is um you're trying to like
minimize dependencies between words

486
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:28,560
minimize dependencies between words
 

487
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,630
minimize dependencies between words
that's basically the story I think

488
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:30,640
that's basically the story I think
 

489
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,310
that's basically the story I think
behind a lot of why word order looks the

490
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:33,320
behind a lot of why word order looks the
 

491
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,310
behind a lot of why word order looks the
way it is is you we're always connecting

492
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:36,320
way it is is you we're always connecting
 

493
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,670
way it is is you we're always connecting
what is it what is the thing I'm telling

494
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:37,680
what is it what is the thing I'm telling
 

495
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,230
what is it what is the thing I'm telling
you I'm I'm talking to you in sentences

496
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:39,240
you I'm I'm talking to you in sentences
 

497
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,990
you I'm I'm talking to you in sentences
you're talking to me in sentences these

498
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:41,000
you're talking to me in sentences these
 

499
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,190
you're talking to me in sentences these
are sequences of Words which are

500
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:43,200
are sequences of Words which are
 

501
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,470
are sequences of Words which are
connected and the connections are

502
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:45,480
connected and the connections are
 

503
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,870
connected and the connections are
dependencies between the words and and

504
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:47,880
dependencies between the words and and
 

505
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,590
dependencies between the words and and
it turns out that what we what we're

506
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:49,600
it turns out that what we what we're
 

507
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,350
it turns out that what we what we're
trying to do in a language is actually

508
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:52,360
trying to do in a language is actually
 

509
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,389
trying to do in a language is actually
minimize those dependency links it's

510
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:54,399
minimize those dependency links it's
 

511
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,069
minimize those dependency links it's
easier for me to say things if the words

512
00:09:57,069 --> 00:09:57,079
easier for me to say things if the words
 

513
00:09:57,079 --> 00:09:58,190
easier for me to say things if the words
that are connecting for their meaning

514
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:58,200
that are connecting for their meaning
 

515
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,590
that are connecting for their meaning
are close together it's easier for you

516
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:00,600
are close together it's easier for you
 

517
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,509
are close together it's easier for you
in understanding if that's also true if

00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:03,519
in understanding if that's also true if
 

519
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,470
in understanding if that's also true if
they're far away it's it's hard as to

520
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:06,480
they're far away it's it's hard as to
 

521
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,670
they're far away it's it's hard as to
produce produce that and it's hard for

00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:07,680
produce produce that and it's hard for
 

523
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,509
produce produce that and it's hard for
you to understand and the languages of

00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:09,519
you to understand and the languages of
 

525
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,829
you to understand and the languages of
the world within a language and across

00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:11,839
the world within a language and across
 

527
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,150
the world within a language and across
languages you know fit that

00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:13,160
languages you know fit that
 

529
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,190
languages you know fit that
generalization which is you know so I

530
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:15,200
generalization which is you know so I
 

531
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,230
generalization which is you know so I
you know it turns out that having verbs

532
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,240
you know it turns out that having verbs
 

533
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,949
you know it turns out that having verbs
initial and then having prepositions

534
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:20,959
initial and then having prepositions
 

535
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,990
initial and then having prepositions
ends up making dependencies shorter and

536
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:23,000
ends up making dependencies shorter and
 

537
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,550
ends up making dependencies shorter and
and having verbs final and having

538
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:25,560
and having verbs final and having
 

539
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,990
and having verbs final and having
postpositions ends up making dependency

540
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,000
postpositions ends up making dependency
 

541
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,430
postpositions ends up making dependency
shorter then if you cross them if if you

542
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:29,440
shorter then if you cross them if if you
 

543
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,150
shorter then if you cross them if if you
cross themit ends up you just end up

544
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:31,160
cross themit ends up you just end up
 

545
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,430
cross themit ends up you just end up
it's possible you can do it it mean

546
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:33,440
it's possible you can do it it mean
 

547
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,790
it's possible you can do it it mean
within a language within a language you

548
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:34,800
within a language within a language you
 

549
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,750
within a language within a language you
can do it it just ends up with longer

550
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:36,760
can do it it just ends up with longer
 

551
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,269
can do it it just ends up with longer
dependencies than if you didn't so

552
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:39,279
dependencies than if you didn't so
 

553
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,949
dependencies than if you didn't so
languages tend to go that way they tend

554
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:40,959
languages tend to go that way they tend
 

555
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,629
languages tend to go that way they tend
to minim they say they call it harmonic

to minim they say they call it harmonic
so it was observed a long time ago by uh

566
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:55,399
lot of generalizations about how word
 

567
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:57,269
lot of generalizations about how word
order works and these are some of the

order there's so many things I want to

576
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,160
order there's so many things I want to
 

577
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,910
order there's so many things I want to
ask you okay let me uh just sometimes

578
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:06,920
ask you okay let me uh just sometimes
 

579
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,230
ask you okay let me uh just sometimes
Basics you you mentioned dependencies a

580
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:09,240
Basics you you mentioned dependencies a
 

581
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,069
Basics you you mentioned dependencies a
few times yeah what do you mean by

582
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:11,079
few times yeah what do you mean by
 

583
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:14,790
few times yeah what do you mean by
dependencies well what I mean is in um

584
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:14,800
dependencies well what I mean is in um
 

585
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,750
dependencies well what I mean is in um
in language there's kind of three

586
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:16,760
in language there's kind of three
 

587
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,870
in language there's kind of three
structures to three components to the

588
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:18,880
structures to three components to the
 

589
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,150
structures to three components to the
structure of language one is the sounds

590
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:21,160
structure of language one is the sounds
 

591
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,269
structure of language one is the sounds
so cat is C and T in English I'm not

592
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:24,279
so cat is C and T in English I'm not
 

593
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,949
so cat is C and T in English I'm not
talking about that part I'm talking then

594
00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:25,959
talking about that part I'm talking then
 

595
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:27,629
talking about that part I'm talking then
there's two meaning parts and those are

596
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:27,639
there's two meaning parts and those are
 

597
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:29,750
there's two meaning parts and those are
the words and and you were talking about

598
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:29,760
the words and and you were talking about
 

599
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,310
the words and and you were talking about
meaning earlier so words have a form and

600
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:32,320
meaning earlier so words have a form and
 

601
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,069
meaning earlier so words have a form and
they have a meaning associated with them

602
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:34,079
they have a meaning associated with them
 

603
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,110
they have a meaning associated with them
and so cat is a full form in English and

604
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:36,120
and so cat is a full form in English and
 

605
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,389
and so cat is a full form in English and
it has a meaning associated with

606
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:37,399
it has a meaning associated with
 

607
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:39,629
it has a meaning associated with
whatever a cat is and then the

608
00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:39,639
whatever a cat is and then the
 

609
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:42,310
whatever a cat is and then the
combinations of words uh that's what

610
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:42,320
combinations of words uh that's what
 

611
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,990
combinations of words uh that's what
I'll call grammar or syntax and uh

612
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:45,000
I'll call grammar or syntax and uh
 

613
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,269
I'll call grammar or syntax and uh
that's like when I have a combination

614
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:47,279
that's like when I have a combination
 

615
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,550
that's like when I have a combination
like the cat or two cats okay so uh

616
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:50,560
like the cat or two cats okay so uh
 

617
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,670
like the cat or two cats okay so uh
where I take two different words there

618
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:52,680
where I take two different words there
 

619
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,430
where I take two different words there
and put them together and I get a

620
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:54,440
and put them together and I get a
 

621
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,829
and put them together and I get a
compositional meaning from putting those

622
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:55,839
compositional meaning from putting those
 

623
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,870
compositional meaning from putting those
two different words together and and so

624
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:57,880
two different words together and and so
 

625
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,829
two different words together and and so
that's the syntax and

626
00:11:59,829 --> 00:11:59,839
that's the syntax and
 

627
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,870
that's the syntax and
in any sentence or utterance whatever

628
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:02,880
in any sentence or utterance whatever
 

629
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,269
in any sentence or utterance whatever
I'm talking to you you're talking to me

630
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:04,279
I'm talking to you you're talking to me
 

631
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:05,750
I'm talking to you you're talking to me
we have a bunch of words and we're

632
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:05,760
we have a bunch of words and we're
 

633
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,310
we have a bunch of words and we're
putting together in a sequence they it

634
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,320
putting together in a sequence they it
 

635
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,750
putting together in a sequence they it
turns out they

636
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:09,760
turns out they
 

637
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,189
turns out they
are connected so that every word is

638
00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:13,199
are connected so that every word is
 

639
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,670
are connected so that every word is
connected to just one other word in that

640
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:15,680
connected to just one other word in that
 

641
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,670
connected to just one other word in that
in that sentence and so you end up with

642
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:17,680
in that sentence and so you end up with
 

643
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,189
in that sentence and so you end up with
what's what's called technically a tree

644
00:12:19,189 --> 00:12:19,199
what's what's called technically a tree
 

645
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:21,269
what's what's called technically a tree
it's a tree structure so there where

646
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:21,279
it's a tree structure so there where
 

647
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,269
it's a tree structure so there where
there's a root of that of that utterance

648
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:24,279
there's a root of that of that utterance
 

649
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:25,949
there's a root of that of that utterance
of that sentence and then there's a

650
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:25,959
of that sentence and then there's a
 

651
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:28,509
of that sentence and then there's a
bunch of dependence like branches from

652
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:28,519
bunch of dependence like branches from
 

653
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:31,189
bunch of dependence like branches from
that root that go down to the words the

654
00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:31,199
that root that go down to the words the
 

655
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:33,430
that root that go down to the words the
words are the leaves in this metaphor

656
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:33,440
words are the leaves in this metaphor
 

657
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,030
words are the leaves in this metaphor
for a tree so a tree is also sort of a

658
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:36,040
for a tree so a tree is also sort of a
 

659
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,990
for a tree so a tree is also sort of a
mathematical construct a graph

660
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,000
mathematical construct a graph
 

661
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,150
mathematical construct a graph
theoretical thing graph Theory thing uh

662
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,160
theoretical thing graph Theory thing uh
 

663
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,509
theoretical thing graph Theory thing uh
so in the it's fascinating that you can

664
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:42,519
so in the it's fascinating that you can
 

665
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:44,430
so in the it's fascinating that you can
break down a sentence into a tree and

666
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:44,440
break down a sentence into a tree and
 

667
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,030
break down a sentence into a tree and
then one every word is hanging on to

668
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:46,040
then one every word is hanging on to
 

669
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,389
then one every word is hanging on to
another this depending on right and and

670
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:48,399
another this depending on right and and
 

671
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,949
another this depending on right and and
everyone agrees on that so all linguists

672
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:49,959
everyone agrees on that so all linguists
 

673
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:51,750
everyone agrees on that so all linguists
will agree with that no one not

674
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:51,760
will agree with that no one not
 

675
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,269
will agree with that no one not
controversial that is not controversial

676
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:53,279
controversial that is not controversial
 

677
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,829
controversial that is not controversial
there's nobody sitting here mad at you I

678
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:55,839
there's nobody sitting here mad at you I
 

679
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,670
there's nobody sitting here mad at you I
don't think so okay there's no linguist

680
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:57,680
don't think so okay there's no linguist
 

681
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,509
don't think so okay there's no linguist
sitting there mad at this I think every

682
00:12:59,509 --> 00:12:59,519
sitting there mad at this I think every
 

683
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,069
sitting there mad at this I think every
language I think everyone agrees that

684
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:02,079
language I think everyone agrees that
 

685
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,350
language I think everyone agrees that
all sentences are trees at some level

686
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:05,360
all sentences are trees at some level
 

687
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,829
all sentences are trees at some level
can I pause on that cuz it it's to me

688
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:07,839
can I pause on that cuz it it's to me
 

689
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,350
can I pause on that cuz it it's to me
just as a Layman it uh it's surprising

690
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:11,360
just as a Layman it uh it's surprising
 

691
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,389
just as a Layman it uh it's surprising
yeah that you can break down sentences

692
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:14,399
yeah that you can break down sentences
 

693
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,750
yeah that you can break down sentences
in many most all languages all languages

694
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:16,760
in many most all languages all languages
 

695
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,389
in many most all languages all languages
I into a tree I think so that's weird I

696
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:19,399
I into a tree I think so that's weird I
 

697
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,910
I into a tree I think so that's weird I
I've never heard of anyone disagreeing

698
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:20,920
I've never heard of anyone disagreeing
 

699
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,990
I've never heard of anyone disagreeing
with that that's weird the details of

700
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:23,000
with that that's weird the details of
 

701
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,030
with that that's weird the details of
the trees are what people disagree about

702
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:26,040
the trees are what people disagree about
 

703
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,030
the trees are what people disagree about
well okay so what's uh what's at the

704
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,040
well okay so what's uh what's at the
 

705
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,949
well okay so what's uh what's at the
root of a how do you conru construct how

706
00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:29,959
root of a how do you conru construct how
 

707
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:31,509
root of a how do you conru construct how
hard is it what is the process of

708
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:31,519
hard is it what is the process of
 

709
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,189
hard is it what is the process of
constructing a tree from a sentence uh

710
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:34,199
constructing a tree from a sentence uh
 

711
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:36,350
constructing a tree from a sentence uh
well this is where you know depending on

712
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:36,360
well this is where you know depending on
 

713
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,430
well this is where you know depending on
what you're there's different

714
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:37,440
what you're there's different
 

715
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,150
what you're there's different
theoretical Notions I'm going to say the

716
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:39,160
theoretical Notions I'm going to say the
 

717
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,389
theoretical Notions I'm going to say the
simplest thing the pendency grammar it's

718
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:41,399
simplest thing the pendency grammar it's
 

719
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,509
simplest thing the pendency grammar it's
like a bunch of people invented this

720
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:43,519
like a bunch of people invented this
 

721
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,069
like a bunch of people invented this
tenier was the first French guy back in

722
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:46,079
tenier was the first French guy back in
 

723
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,389
tenier was the first French guy back in
I mean the paper was published in 1959

724
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:48,399
I mean the paper was published in 1959
 

725
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,110
I mean the paper was published in 1959
but he was working on the 30s and stuff

726
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:50,120
but he was working on the 30s and stuff
 

727
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,749
but he was working on the 30s and stuff
so and and it goes back to uh you know

728
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:52,759
so and and it goes back to uh you know
 

729
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:55,590
so and and it goes back to uh you know
philologist Pini was doing this in

730
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:55,600
philologist Pini was doing this in
 

731
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,829
philologist Pini was doing this in
ancient uh India okay and so you know

732
00:13:58,829 --> 00:13:58,839
ancient uh India okay and so you know
 

733
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,189
ancient uh India okay and so you know
doing something like this the simplest

734
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:00,199
doing something like this the simplest
 

735
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:02,550
doing something like this the simplest
thing we can think of is that there's

736
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:02,560
thing we can think of is that there's
 

737
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,389
thing we can think of is that there's
just connections between the words to

738
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:04,399
just connections between the words to
 

739
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,430
just connections between the words to
make the the utterance and so just say I

740
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:07,440
make the the utterance and so just say I
 

741
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,150
make the the utterance and so just say I
have like two dogs entered a room okay

742
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,160
have like two dogs entered a room okay
 

743
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,550
have like two dogs entered a room okay
here's a sentence and so uh we're

744
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:13,560
here's a sentence and so uh we're
 

745
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,870
here's a sentence and so uh we're
connecting two and dogs together that's

746
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:15,880
connecting two and dogs together that's
 

747
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,110
connecting two and dogs together that's
like there's some dependency between

748
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:17,120
like there's some dependency between
 

749
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,949
like there's some dependency between
those words to make some bigger meaning

750
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:18,959
those words to make some bigger meaning
 

751
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,350
those words to make some bigger meaning
and then we're connecting dogs now to uh

752
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:22,360
and then we're connecting dogs now to uh
 

753
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,470
and then we're connecting dogs now to uh
entered right and we connect a room

754
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:25,480
entered right and we connect a room
 

755
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,350
entered right and we connect a room
somehow to entered and so I'm going to

756
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:27,360
somehow to entered and so I'm going to
 

757
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,310
somehow to entered and so I'm going to
connect uh to room and then room back to

758
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:29,320
connect uh to room and then room back to
 

759
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,150
connect uh to room and then room back to
enter is that's the tree is I that the

760
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,160
enter is that's the tree is I that the
 

761
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,910
enter is that's the tree is I that the
root is entered that's the the thing is

762
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:33,920
root is entered that's the the thing is
 

763
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,310
root is entered that's the the thing is
like an entering event that's what we're

764
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:35,320
like an entering event that's what we're
 

765
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,949
like an entering event that's what we're
saying here and the the subject which is

766
00:14:37,949 --> 00:14:37,959
saying here and the the subject which is
 

767
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:40,189
saying here and the the subject which is
whatever that dog is is two dogs it was

768
00:14:40,189 --> 00:14:40,199
whatever that dog is is two dogs it was
 

769
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,150
whatever that dog is is two dogs it was
and and the connection goes back to dogs

770
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:42,160
and and the connection goes back to dogs
 

771
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,949
and and the connection goes back to dogs
which goes back to then that that goes

772
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:43,959
which goes back to then that that goes
 

773
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:46,470
which goes back to then that that goes
back to two I'm just that that's my tree

774
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:46,480
back to two I'm just that that's my tree
 

775
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,910
back to two I'm just that that's my tree
it it starts at entered goes to dogs

776
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:48,920
it it starts at entered goes to dogs
 

777
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,430
it it starts at entered goes to dogs
down to two and on the other side after

778
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:51,440
down to two and on the other side after
 

779
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,350
down to two and on the other side after
the verb the object it goes to room and

780
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:54,360
the verb the object it goes to room and
 

781
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,389
the verb the object it goes to room and
then that goes back to the the

782
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:56,399
then that goes back to the the
 

783
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,710
then that goes back to the the
determiner or article whatever you want

784
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:57,720
determiner or article whatever you want
 

785
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,310
determiner or article whatever you want
to call that word uh so there's a bunch

786
00:14:59,310 --> 00:14:59,320
to call that word uh so there's a bunch
 

787
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,590
to call that word uh so there's a bunch
of categories of words here we're

788
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:00,600
of categories of words here we're
 

789
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,069
of categories of words here we're
noticing so there are verbs those are

790
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:03,079
noticing so there are verbs those are
 

791
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:05,829
noticing so there are verbs those are
these things that typically Mark uh they

792
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:05,839
these things that typically Mark uh they
 

793
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,749
these things that typically Mark uh they
refer to events and states in the world

794
00:15:08,749 --> 00:15:08,759
refer to events and states in the world
 

795
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:10,470
refer to events and states in the world
and they're nouns which typically refer

796
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:10,480
and they're nouns which typically refer
 

797
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,350
and they're nouns which typically refer
to people places and things is what

798
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:12,360
to people places and things is what
 

799
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,790
to people places and things is what
people say but they can refer to other

800
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:13,800
people say but they can refer to other
 

801
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,749
people say but they can refer to other
more they can refer to events themselves

802
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:15,759
more they can refer to events themselves
 

803
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:17,590
more they can refer to events themselves
as well they're they're they're marked

804
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:17,600
as well they're they're they're marked
 

805
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,710
as well they're they're they're marked
by you know how they how they get you

806
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:20,720
by you know how they how they get you
 

807
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,430
by you know how they how they get you
what the category the part of speech of

808
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:22,440
what the category the part of speech of
 

809
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,550
what the category the part of speech of
a word is how it gets used in language

810
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:25,560
a word is how it gets used in language
 

811
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,629
a word is how it gets used in language
it's like that's how you decide what the

812
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:27,639
it's like that's how you decide what the
 

813
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:29,189
it's like that's how you decide what the
what the category of a word is not not

814
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:29,199
what the category of a word is not not
 

815
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,189
what the category of a word is not not
by the meaning but how it's how it gets

816
00:15:31,189 --> 00:15:31,199
by the meaning but how it's how it gets
 

817
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,470
by the meaning but how it's how it gets
used how it's used what's usually the

818
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:33,480
used how it's used what's usually the
 

819
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,710
used how it's used what's usually the
root is it going to be the verb that

820
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:35,720
root is it going to be the verb that
 

821
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,870
root is it going to be the verb that
defines the event usually usually yes

822
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:37,880
defines the event usually usually yes
 

823
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,309
defines the event usually usually yes
yes okay yeah I mean if I don't say a

824
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:40,319
yes okay yeah I mean if I don't say a
 

825
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:41,749
yes okay yeah I mean if I don't say a
verb then there won't be a verb and so

826
00:15:41,749 --> 00:15:41,759
verb then there won't be a verb and so
 

827
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,910
verb then there won't be a verb and so
it'll be something else what if you're

828
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:42,920
it'll be something else what if you're
 

829
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,670
it'll be something else what if you're
messing are we talking about language

830
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:44,680
messing are we talking about language
 

831
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,350
messing are we talking about language
that's like correct language what if

832
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:46,360
that's like correct language what if
 

833
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,749
that's like correct language what if
you're doing poetry and messing with

834
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:47,759
you're doing poetry and messing with
 

835
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,590
you're doing poetry and messing with
stuff is it then then rules go out the

836
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:50,600
stuff is it then then rules go out the
 

837
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,110
stuff is it then then rules go out the
window right then it's no you're still

838
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:53,120
window right then it's no you're still
 

839
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,790
window right then it's no you're still
no no no you're constrained by whatever

840
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:54,800
no no no you're constrained by whatever
 

841
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,629
no no no you're constrained by whatever
language you're dealing with probably

842
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:56,639
language you're dealing with probably
 

843
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,069
language you're dealing with probably
you have other constraints in poetry

844
00:15:59,069 --> 00:15:59,079
you have other constraints in poetry
 

845
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:00,749
you have other constraints in poetry
such that you're like usually in poetry

846
00:16:00,749 --> 00:16:00,759
such that you're like usually in poetry
 

847
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,069
such that you're like usually in poetry
there's multiple constraints that you

848
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:02,079
there's multiple constraints that you
 

849
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,990
there's multiple constraints that you
want to like you want to usually convey

850
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:04,000
want to like you want to usually convey
 

851
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,030
want to like you want to usually convey
multiple meanings is the idea and maybe

852
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:06,040
multiple meanings is the idea and maybe
 

853
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,790
multiple meanings is the idea and maybe
you have like a rhythm or a rhyming

854
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:07,800
you have like a rhythm or a rhyming
 

855
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,870
you have like a rhythm or a rhyming
structure as well and depending on so

856
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:09,880
structure as well and depending on so
 

857
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,350
structure as well and depending on so
but you usually are constrained by your

858
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:12,360
but you usually are constrained by your
 

859
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,309
but you usually are constrained by your
the rules of your language for the most

860
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:14,319
the rules of your language for the most
 

861
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:17,069
the rules of your language for the most
part and so you don't violate those too

862
00:16:17,069 --> 00:16:17,079
part and so you don't violate those too
 

863
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:19,389
part and so you don't violate those too
much you can violate them somewhat but

864
00:16:19,389 --> 00:16:19,399
much you can violate them somewhat but
 

865
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:20,790
much you can violate them somewhat but
not too much so it has to be

866
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:20,800
not too much so it has to be
 

867
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,670
not too much so it has to be
recognizable as your language like in

868
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:22,680
recognizable as your language like in
 

869
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,110
recognizable as your language like in
English I can't say dogs to entered room

870
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:27,120
English I can't say dogs to entered room
 

871
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,309
English I can't say dogs to entered room
ah I mean I meant the you know two dogs

872
00:16:29,309 --> 00:16:29,319
ah I mean I meant the you know two dogs
 

873
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:32,629
ah I mean I meant the you know two dogs
entered a room and I I I can't mess with

874
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:32,639
entered a room and I I I can't mess with
 

875
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,189
entered a room and I I I can't mess with
the order of the the Articles the

876
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:35,199
the order of the the Articles the
 

877
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,749
the order of the the Articles the
Articles and the nouns you just can't do

878
00:16:36,749 --> 00:16:36,759
Articles and the nouns you just can't do
 

879
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:39,309
Articles and the nouns you just can't do
that in some languages you can you can

880
00:16:39,309 --> 00:16:39,319
that in some languages you can you can
 

881
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:41,910
that in some languages you can you can
mess around with the order of words much

882
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:41,920
mess around with the order of words much
 

883
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,110
mess around with the order of words much
more I mean you speak Russian Russian

884
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:44,120
more I mean you speak Russian Russian
 

885
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,389
more I mean you speak Russian Russian
has a much Freer word order than English

886
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:46,399
has a much Freer word order than English
 

887
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,509
has a much Freer word order than English
and so in fact you can move around words

888
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:48,519
and so in fact you can move around words
 

889
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:50,430
and so in fact you can move around words
in you know I told you that English has

890
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:50,440
in you know I told you that English has
 

891
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,430
in you know I told you that English has
the subject verb object word order so

892
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:52,440
the subject verb object word order so
 

893
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,189
the subject verb object word order so
does Russian but Russian is much Freer

894
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:55,199
does Russian but Russian is much Freer
 

895
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,629
does Russian but Russian is much Freer
than English and so you can actually

896
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:56,639
than English and so you can actually
 

897
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,069
than English and so you can actually
mess around with the word order so

898
00:16:58,069 --> 00:16:58,079
mess around with the word order so
 

899
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,470
mess around with the word order so
probably Russian

900
00:16:59,470 --> 00:16:59,480
probably Russian
 

901
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,110
probably Russian
poetry is going to be quite different

902
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:01,120
poetry is going to be quite different
 

903
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,910
poetry is going to be quite different
from English poetry because the word

904
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:02,920
from English poetry because the word
 

905
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,189
from English poetry because the word
order is much less constrained yeah

906
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:05,199
order is much less constrained yeah
 

907
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,630
order is much less constrained yeah
there's a much more extensive uh culture

908
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:07,640
there's a much more extensive uh culture
 

909
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,270
there's a much more extensive uh culture
of poetry throughout the history of the

910
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:10,280
of poetry throughout the history of the
 

911
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,909
of poetry throughout the history of the
last 100 years in Russia and I I always

912
00:17:12,909 --> 00:17:12,919
last 100 years in Russia and I I always
 

913
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:15,309
last 100 years in Russia and I I always
wondered why that is but it seems that

914
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:15,319
wondered why that is but it seems that
 

915
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,429
wondered why that is but it seems that
there's more

916
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:16,439
there's more
 

917
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:18,750
there's more
flexibility in the way the language is

918
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:18,760
flexibility in the way the language is
 

919
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,870
flexibility in the way the language is
used there's more you're morphing the

920
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:20,880
used there's more you're morphing the
 

921
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,789
used there's more you're morphing the
language Easier by altering the words

922
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:23,799
language Easier by altering the words
 

923
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:25,510
language Easier by altering the words
altering the order of the words messing

924
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:25,520
altering the order of the words messing
 

925
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,270
altering the order of the words messing
with it well you can just mess with

926
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:27,280
with it well you can just mess with
 

927
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,950
with it well you can just mess with
different things in each language and so

928
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:28,960
different things in each language and so
 

929
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,310
different things in each language and so
Russian you have case markers right on

930
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:31,320
Russian you have case markers right on
 

931
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,070
Russian you have case markers right on
the end which is there these endings on

932
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:33,080
the end which is there these endings on
 

933
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,350
the end which is there these endings on
the nouns which tell you how it connects

934
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:35,360
the nouns which tell you how it connects
 

935
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,070
the nouns which tell you how it connects
each noun connects to the verb right we

936
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:37,080
each noun connects to the verb right we
 

937
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,830
each noun connects to the verb right we
don't have that in English and so when I

938
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:38,840
don't have that in English and so when I
 

939
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,710
don't have that in English and so when I
say um Mary kissed John I don't know who

940
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:42,720
say um Mary kissed John I don't know who
 

941
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,630
say um Mary kissed John I don't know who
the agent or the patient is except by

942
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:44,640
the agent or the patient is except by
 

943
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,270
the agent or the patient is except by
the order of the words right in in

944
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:46,280
the order of the words right in in
 

945
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,070
the order of the words right in in
Russian you actually have a marker on

946
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,080
Russian you actually have a marker on
 

947
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,590
Russian you actually have a marker on
the end if you're using a Russian name

948
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:49,600
the end if you're using a Russian name
 

949
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,950
the end if you're using a Russian name
and each of those names you'll also say

950
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:51,960
and each of those names you'll also say
 

951
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,350
and each of those names you'll also say
is it you know agent it'll be the uh you

952
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:54,360
is it you know agent it'll be the uh you
 

953
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,390
is it you know agent it'll be the uh you
know nominative which is marking the

954
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:56,400
know nominative which is marking the
 

955
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,270
know nominative which is marking the
subject or an accusative will Mark the

956
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:58,280
subject or an accusative will Mark the
 

957
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,870
subject or an accusative will Mark the
object and you could put them in the

958
00:17:59,870 --> 00:17:59,880
object and you could put them in the
 

959
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,149
object and you could put them in the
reverse order you could put accusative

960
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:02,159
reverse order you could put accusative
 

961
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:04,549
reverse order you could put accusative
first as you could put subject you could

962
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:04,559
first as you could put subject you could
 

963
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,710
first as you could put subject you could
put um the patient first and then the

964
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:07,720
put um the patient first and then the
 

965
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,230
put um the patient first and then the
verb and then the the the subject and

966
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:10,240
verb and then the the the subject and
 

967
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,350
verb and then the the the subject and
that would be a perfectly good Russian

968
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:11,360
that would be a perfectly good Russian
 

969
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,470
that would be a perfectly good Russian
sentence and it would still mean Mary I

970
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:13,480
sentence and it would still mean Mary I
 

971
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,909
sentence and it would still mean Mary I
could say John kissed Mary meaning Mary

972
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:15,919
could say John kissed Mary meaning Mary
 

973
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,510
could say John kissed Mary meaning Mary
kissed John with as long as I use the

974
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:18,520
kissed John with as long as I use the
 

975
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,870
kissed John with as long as I use the
case markers in the right way you can't

976
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:19,880
case markers in the right way you can't
 

977
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,430
case markers in the right way you can't
do that in English and so uh I love the

978
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:22,440
do that in English and so uh I love the
 

979
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,710
do that in English and so uh I love the
terminology of agent and patient and uh

980
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:25,720
terminology of agent and patient and uh
 

981
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,750
terminology of agent and patient and uh
and the other ones you used those are

982
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:27,760
and the other ones you used those are
 

983
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,310
and the other ones you used those are
sort of linguistic terms correct those

984
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:29,320
sort of linguistic terms correct those
 

985
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,990
sort of linguistic terms correct those
are those are for like kind of meaning

986
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:31,000
are those are for like kind of meaning
 

987
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,590
are those are for like kind of meaning
those are meaning and and subject and

988
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:32,600
those are meaning and and subject and
 

989
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,070
those are meaning and and subject and
object are generally used for position

990
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:35,080
object are generally used for position
 

991
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,950
object are generally used for position
so subject is just like the thing that

992
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:36,960
so subject is just like the thing that
 

993
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,830
so subject is just like the thing that
comes before the the verb and the object

994
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:38,840
comes before the the verb and the object
 

995
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,190
comes before the the verb and the object
is one that comes after the verb the

996
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:40,200
is one that comes after the verb the
 

997
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,750
is one that comes after the verb the
agent is kind of like the thing doing it

998
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:42,760
agent is kind of like the thing doing it
 

999
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,430
agent is kind of like the thing doing it
that's kind of what that means right the

1000
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:44,440
that's kind of what that means right the
 

1001
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,430
that's kind of what that means right the
subject is often the person doing the

1002
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:46,440
subject is often the person doing the
 

1003
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,990
subject is often the person doing the
action right the thing so yeah okay this

1004
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:49,000
action right the thing so yeah okay this
 

1005
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,830
action right the thing so yeah okay this
is fascinating so how hard is it to form

1006
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:50,840
is fascinating so how hard is it to form
 

1007
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,990
is fascinating so how hard is it to form
a tree in general is there um is there a

1008
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,000
a tree in general is there um is there a
 

1009
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,350
a tree in general is there um is there a
procedure to it like if you look at

1010
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:55,360
procedure to it like if you look at
 

1011
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,230
procedure to it like if you look at
different languages is it supposed to be

1012
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:57,240
different languages is it supposed to be
 

1013
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,430
different languages is it supposed to be
a very natural like is it aable or is

1014
00:18:59,430 --> 00:18:59,440
a very natural like is it aable or is
 

1015
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,430
a very natural like is it aable or is
there some human genius involved in I

1016
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:01,440
there some human genius involved in I
 

1017
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,070
there some human genius involved in I
think it's pretty automatable at this

1018
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:03,080
think it's pretty automatable at this
 

1019
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,470
think it's pretty automatable at this
point people can figure out the words

1020
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:04,480
point people can figure out the words
 

1021
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,669
point people can figure out the words
are they can figure out the morphemes

1022
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:05,679
are they can figure out the morphemes
 

1023
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,909
are they can figure out the morphemes
which are the technically morphemes are

1024
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:07,919
which are the technically morphemes are
 

1025
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,190
which are the technically morphemes are
the the minimal meaning units within a

1026
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:10,200
the the minimal meaning units within a
 

1027
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,950
the the minimal meaning units within a
language okay and so when you say eats

1028
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:12,960
language okay and so when you say eats
 

1029
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,830
language okay and so when you say eats
or drinks it actually has two morphemes

1030
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:14,840
or drinks it actually has two morphemes
 

1031
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,110
or drinks it actually has two morphemes
and in English there's there's the

1032
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:16,120
and in English there's there's the
 

1033
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,789
and in English there's there's the
there's the root which is the verb and

1034
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:17,799
there's the root which is the verb and
 

1035
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:19,070
there's the root which is the verb and
then there's some ending on it which

1036
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:19,080
then there's some ending on it which
 

1037
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,270
then there's some ending on it which
tells you you know that's this third

1038
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:21,280
tells you you know that's this third
 

1039
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,789
tells you you know that's this third
person uh third person singular say what

1040
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:23,799
person uh third person singular say what
 

1041
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:25,669
person uh third person singular say what
mores are morphemes are just the minimal

1042
00:19:25,669 --> 00:19:25,679
mores are morphemes are just the minimal
 

1043
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,190
mores are morphemes are just the minimal
meaning units within a language and a

1044
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:27,200
meaning units within a language and a
 

1045
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,870
meaning units within a language and a
word is just kind of the things we put

1046
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:28,880
word is just kind of the things we put
 

1047
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,029
word is just kind of the things we put
spaces between English and they have a

1048
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:31,039
spaces between English and they have a
 

1049
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,470
spaces between English and they have a
little bit more they have the morphology

1050
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:32,480
little bit more they have the morphology
 

1051
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,990
little bit more they have the morphology
as well they have the endings this

1052
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,000
as well they have the endings this
 

1053
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,310
as well they have the endings this
inflexal morphology on the endings on

1054
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:36,320
inflexal morphology on the endings on
 

1055
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,190
inflexal morphology on the endings on
the roots they modify something about

1056
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:38,200
the roots they modify something about
 

1057
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,029
the roots they modify something about
the word that adds additional meaning

1058
00:19:40,029 --> 00:19:40,039
the word that adds additional meaning
 

1059
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:41,470
the word that adds additional meaning
they tell you yeah yeah yeah and so we

1060
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:41,480
they tell you yeah yeah yeah and so we
 

1061
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,590
they tell you yeah yeah yeah and so we
have a little bit of that in English

1062
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:42,600
have a little bit of that in English
 

1063
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,470
have a little bit of that in English
very little much more in Russian for

1064
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:44,480
very little much more in Russian for
 

1065
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,230
very little much more in Russian for
instance and and uh but we have a little

1066
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:46,240
instance and and uh but we have a little
 

1067
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,549
instance and and uh but we have a little
bit in English and so we have a little

1068
00:19:47,549 --> 00:19:47,559
bit in English and so we have a little
 

1069
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,110
bit in English and so we have a little
on the on the nouns you can say it's

1070
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:49,120
on the on the nouns you can say it's
 

1071
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,149
on the on the nouns you can say it's
either singular or plural and and you

1072
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:51,159
either singular or plural and and you
 

1073
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:53,789
either singular or plural and and you
can say uh same thing for um for for

1074
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:53,799
can say uh same thing for um for for
 

1075
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:56,470
can say uh same thing for um for for
verbs like simple past tense for example

1076
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:56,480
verbs like simple past tense for example
 

1077
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,390
verbs like simple past tense for example
like you know notice in English we say

1078
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:58,400
like you know notice in English we say
 

1079
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,549
like you know notice in English we say
drink drinks uh you know he drinks but

1080
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:00,559
drink drinks uh you know he drinks but
 

1081
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,350
drink drinks uh you know he drinks but
everyone else is I drink you drink we

1082
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:02,360
everyone else is I drink you drink we
 

1083
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,669
everyone else is I drink you drink we
drink it's unmarked in a way and then

1084
00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:04,679
drink it's unmarked in a way and then
 

1085
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,510
drink it's unmarked in a way and then
but in the past tense it's just drank

1086
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:06,520
but in the past tense it's just drank
 

1087
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,230
but in the past tense it's just drank
there for everyone there's no morphology

1088
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:08,240
there for everyone there's no morphology
 

1089
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,909
there for everyone there's no morphology
at all for past tense it's there is

1090
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:09,919
at all for past tense it's there is
 

1091
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,390
at all for past tense it's there is
morphology it's marking past tense but

1092
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:11,400
morphology it's marking past tense but
 

1093
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,870
morphology it's marking past tense but
it's kind of it's an irregular now so we

1094
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:13,880
it's kind of it's an irregular now so we
 

1095
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,950
it's kind of it's an irregular now so we
don't even you know drink to drank you

1096

just happen to choose an irregular
 

1107
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:26,950
just happen to choose an irregular
because it's a high frequency word and

because it's a high frequency word and
 

1109
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,669

there's what two morphemes per word
 

1183
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,870
there's what two morphemes per word
usually one or two or three well in

usually one or two or three well in
 

1185
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,510
usually one or two or three well in
English it's it's it's one or two in

00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:56,880
can be more you know in in other
 

1191
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,029
can be more you know in in other
languages you know a lang language like

1192
00:21:59,029 --> 00:21:59,039
languages you know a lang language like
 

1193
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,549
languages you know a lang language like
uh like finish which has a very uh

1194
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:01,559
uh like finish which has a very uh
 

1195
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:03,750
uh like finish which has a very uh
elaborate morphology there may be 10

1196
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:03,760
elaborate morphology there may be 10
 

1197
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,070
elaborate morphology there may be 10
morphemes on the end of a route okay and

1198
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:06,080
morphemes on the end of a route okay and
 

1199
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,830
morphemes on the end of a route okay and
so there may be Mill there be millions

1200
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:07,840
so there may be Mill there be millions
 

1201
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,190
so there may be Mill there be millions
of forms of a given word okay okay I I

1202
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:11,200
of forms of a given word okay okay I I
 

1203
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,590
of forms of a given word okay okay I I
will ask the same question over and over

1204
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:13,600
will ask the same question over and over
 

1205
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,950
will ask the same question over and over
but

1206
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:15,960
but
 

1207
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,190
but
uh how does a just sometimes to

1208
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:19,200
uh how does a just sometimes to
 

1209
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,230
uh how does a just sometimes to
understand things like morphemes it's

1210
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:22,240
understand things like morphemes it's
 

1211
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,110
understand things like morphemes it's
nice to just ask the question how does

1212
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:24,120
nice to just ask the question how does
 

1213
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,789
nice to just ask the question how does
these kinds of things evolve so you uh

1214
00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:27,799
these kinds of things evolve so you uh
 

1215
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:31,630
these kinds of things evolve so you uh
have a great book studying sort of

1216
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:31,640
have a great book studying sort of
 

1217
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,950
have a great book studying sort of
the how how the cognitive processing how

1218
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:34,960
the how how the cognitive processing how
 

1219
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,070
the how how the cognitive processing how
language used for communication so the

1220
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:37,080
language used for communication so the
 

1221
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,830
language used for communication so the
the mathematical notion of how effective

1222
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:38,840
the mathematical notion of how effective
 

1223
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,549
the mathematical notion of how effective
language is for communication what role

1224
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:40,559
language is for communication what role
 

1225
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,149
language is for communication what role
that plays in the evolution of language

1226
00:22:42,149 --> 00:22:42,159
that plays in the evolution of language
 

1227
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,909
that plays in the evolution of language
but just high level like how do we how

1228
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:45,919
but just high level like how do we how
 

1229
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,789
but just high level like how do we how
does a language evolve with where

1230
00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:47,799
does a language evolve with where
 

1231
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:50,029
does a language evolve with where
English is two morphemes or one or two

1232
00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:50,039
English is two morphemes or one or two
 

1233
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:52,909
English is two morphemes or one or two
mores per word and then Finnish has

1234
00:22:52,909 --> 00:22:52,919
mores per word and then Finnish has
 

1235
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:55,950
mores per word and then Finnish has
Infinity forward so what how does that

1236
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:55,960
Infinity forward so what how does that
 

1237
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,669
Infinity forward so what how does that
how does that happen is it just

1238
00:22:58,669 --> 00:22:58,679
how does that happen is it just
 

1239
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:00,430
how does that happen is it just
that's a really good question yeah

1240
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:00,440
that's a really good question yeah
 

1241
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,350
that's a really good question yeah
that's a very good question is like why

1242
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:02,360
that's a very good question is like why
 

1243
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,750
that's a very good question is like why
do languages have more morphology versus

1244
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:05,760
do languages have more morphology versus
 

1245
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,230
do languages have more morphology versus
less morphology and and I don't think we

1246
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:07,240
less morphology and and I don't think we
 

1247
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,710
less morphology and and I don't think we
know the answer to this I don't I think

1248
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:08,720
know the answer to this I don't I think
 

1249
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,230
know the answer to this I don't I think
there's just like a lot of good

1250
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:10,240
there's just like a lot of good
 

1251
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,590
there's just like a lot of good
solutions to the problem of

1252
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:12,600
solutions to the problem of
 

1253
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,310
solutions to the problem of
communication so I like I believe as you

1254
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:15,320
communication so I like I believe as you
 

1255
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:19,149

system by humans for communicating their
 

1259
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,710
system by humans for communicating their
ideas and I think we it comes down to we

1260
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:24,720
ideas and I think we it comes down to we
 

1261
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,590

label things we want to talk about those

1262
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:26,600
label things we want to talk about those
 

1263
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,909
label things we want to talk about those
are the the the morphemes and words

1264
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:28,919
are the the the morphemes and words
 

1265
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:29,830
are the the the morphemes and words
those are the things we want to talk

1266
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:29,840
those are the things we want to talk
 

1267
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,110
those are the things we want to talk
about in the world and we invent those

1268
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,120
about in the world and we invent those
 

1269
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,590
about in the world and we invent those
things and then uh we put them together

1270
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:33,600
things and then uh we put them together
 

1271
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,830
things and then uh we put them together
in ways that are um easy for us to

1272
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:36,840
in ways that are um easy for us to
 

1273
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,870
in ways that are um easy for us to
convey to process but that that that's

1274
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:38,880
convey to process but that that that's
 

1275
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,510
convey to process but that that that's
like a naive View and I don't I mean I I

1276
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:41,520
like a naive View and I don't I mean I I
 

1277
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,950
like a naive View and I don't I mean I I
think it's probably right right it's

1278
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:42,960
think it's probably right right it's
 

1279
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,750
think it's probably right right it's
naive and probably right well I don't

1280
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:44,760
naive and probably right well I don't
 

1281
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,390
naive and probably right well I don't
know if it's naive I think it's simple

1282
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:46,400
know if it's naive I think it's simple
 

1283
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,269
know if it's naive I think it's simple
simple yeah I think naive is naive is an

1284
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:49,279
simple yeah I think naive is naive is an
 

1285
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,149
simple yeah I think naive is naive is an
indication that it's an incorrect

1286
00:23:51,149 --> 00:23:51,159
indication that it's an incorrect
 

1287
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:54,269
indication that it's an incorrect
somehow it's a trivial to too simple I

1288
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:54,279
somehow it's a trivial to too simple I
 

1289
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:56,669
somehow it's a trivial to too simple I
think it could very well be correct but

1290
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:56,679
think it could very well be correct but
 

1291
00:23:56,679 --> 00:23:59,269
think it could very well be correct but
it's interesting how sticky it feels

1292
00:23:59,269 --> 00:23:59,279
it's interesting how sticky it feels
 

1293
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,510
it's interesting how sticky it feels
like two people got

1294
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:01,520
like two people got
 

1295
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,669
like two people got
together it just it just feels like once

1296
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:03,679
together it just it just feels like once
 

1297
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,750
together it just it just feels like once
you figure out certain aspects of a

1298
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:05,760
you figure out certain aspects of a
 

1299
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,390
you figure out certain aspects of a
language that just becomes sticky and

1300
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:07,400
language that just becomes sticky and
 

1301
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,590
language that just becomes sticky and
the tribe forms around that language

1302
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:09,600
the tribe forms around that language
 

1303
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,510
the tribe forms around that language
maybe the language maybe the tribe forms

1304
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:11,520
maybe the language maybe the tribe forms
 

1305
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,230
maybe the language maybe the tribe forms
first and then the language evolves and

1306
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:13,240
first and then the language evolves and
 

1307
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,710
first and then the language evolves and
then you just kind of agree and that you

1308
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:14,720
then you just kind of agree and that you
 

1309
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,549
then you just kind of agree and that you
stick to whatever that is I mean these

1310
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:16,559
stick to whatever that is I mean these
 

1311
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,070
stick to whatever that is I mean these
are very interesting questions we don't

00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:10,520
gray pink and I probably missed
 

1405
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,310
gray pink and I probably missed
something there anyway uh there there's

1406
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:12,320
something there anyway uh there there's
 

1407
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,710
something there anyway uh there there's
11 that everyone knows yeah and um and

1408
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:14,720
11 that everyone knows yeah and um and
 

1409
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,870
11 that everyone knows yeah and um and
depending on your and but you go to

1410
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:15,880
depending on your and but you go to
 

1411
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,149
depending on your and but you go to
different cultures um especially the

1412
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:18,159
different cultures um especially the
 

1413
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,950
different cultures um especially the
non-industrialized cultures and there'll

1414
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:19,960
non-industrialized cultures and there'll
 

1415
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,269
non-industrialized cultures and there'll
be many fewer so some cultures will have

1416
00:26:22,269 --> 00:26:22,279
be many fewer so some cultures will have
 

1417
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:25,430
be many fewer so some cultures will have
only two believe it or not that the Dan

1418
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:25,440
only two believe it or not that the Dan
 

1419
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,750
only two believe it or not that the Dan
I and in Papa New Guinea have only two

1420
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:28,760
I and in Papa New Guinea have only two
 

1421
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,029
I and in Papa New Guinea have only two
labels that the that the group uses for

1422
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:31,039
labels that the that the group uses for
 

1423
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,950
labels that the that the group uses for
color those are roughly black and white

1424
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:32,960
color those are roughly black and white
 

1425
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,789
color those are roughly black and white
they are okay very very dark and very

1426
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:34,799
they are okay very very dark and very
 

1427
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,470
they are okay very very dark and very
very light which are roughly black and

1428
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:36,480
very light which are roughly black and
 

1429
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,029
very light which are roughly black and
white and you might think oh they're

1430
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:38,039
white and you might think oh they're
 

1431
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:40,350
white and you might think oh they're
dividing the whole color space into you

1432
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:40,360
dividing the whole color space into you
 

1433
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,950
dividing the whole color space into you
know light and dark or something and

1434
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:41,960
know light and dark or something and
 

1435
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,710
know light and dark or something and
that's not really true they mostly just

1436
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:43,720
that's not really true they mostly just
 

1437
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,470
that's not really true they mostly just
only label the light the black and the

1438
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:45,480
only label the light the black and the
 

1439
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,909
only label the light the black and the
white things they just don't talk about

1440
00:26:46,909 --> 00:26:46,919
white things they just don't talk about
 

1441
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:49,190
white things they just don't talk about
the colors for the other ones and so and

1442
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:49,200
the colors for the other ones and so and
 

1443
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,269
the colors for the other ones and so and
and then there's other groups I've

1444
00:26:50,269 --> 00:26:50,279
and then there's other groups I've
 

1445
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,909
and then there's other groups I've
worked with a group called The chimani

1446
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:51,919
worked with a group called The chimani
 

1447
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,470
worked with a group called The chimani
down in um in Bolivia in South America

1448
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:55,480
down in um in Bolivia in South America
 

1449
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,389
down in um in Bolivia in South America
and they have three words that everyone

1450
00:26:58,389 --> 00:26:58,399
and they have three words that everyone
 

1451
00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:00,789
and they have three words that everyone
knows but there's a few others that are

1452
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:00,799
knows but there's a few others that are
 

1453
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,029
knows but there's a few others that are
that that several people like that many

1454
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:03,039
that that several people like that many
 

1455
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,950
that that several people like that many
people know and so they have me kind of

1456
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:05,960
people know and so they have me kind of
 

1457
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,029
people know and so they have me kind of
depending at how you count between three

1458
00:27:08,029 --> 00:27:08,039
depending at how you count between three
 

1459
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:11,310
depending at how you count between three
and seven words that the group knows

1460
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:11,320
and seven words that the group knows
 

1461
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,990
and seven words that the group knows
okay and uh and again they're they're

1462
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:13,000
okay and uh and again they're they're
 

1463
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,149
okay and uh and again they're they're
black and white everyone knows those and

1464
00:27:15,149 --> 00:27:15,159
black and white everyone knows those and
 

1465
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:17,870
black and white everyone knows those and
red red is you like that tends to be the

1466
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:17,880
red red is you like that tends to be the
 

1467
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,590
red red is you like that tends to be the
third word that everyone that that

1468
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:19,600
third word that everyone that that
 

1469
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,950
third word that everyone that that
cultures bring in if there's a word it's

1470
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:21,960
cultures bring in if there's a word it's
 

1471
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,830
cultures bring in if there's a word it's
always read the third one and then after

1472
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:23,840
always read the third one and then after
 

1473
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,750
always read the third one and then after
that it's kind of all bets are off about

1474
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:25,760
that it's kind of all bets are off about
 

1475
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,710
that it's kind of all bets are off about
what they bring in and so after that

1476
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:27,720
what they bring in and so after that
 

1477
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,750
what they bring in and so after that
they they bring in a sort of a big blue

1478
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:29,760
they they bring in a sort of a big blue
 

1479
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,750
they they bring in a sort of a big blue
green Spa gr gr they have one for that

1480
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:32,760
green Spa gr gr they have one for that
 

1481
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,350
green Spa gr gr they have one for that
and then they have uh and then you know

1482
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:35,360
and then they have uh and then you know
 

1483
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,870
and then they have uh and then you know
different people have different words

1484
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:36,880
different people have different words
 

1485
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,430
different people have different words
that they'll use for other parts of the

1486
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:38,440
that they'll use for other parts of the
 

1487
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,070
that they'll use for other parts of the
space and so anyway it's probably

1488
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:41,080
space and so anyway it's probably
 

1489
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,269
space and so anyway it's probably
related to what they want to talk what

1490
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:43,279
related to what they want to talk what
 

1491
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,549
related to what they want to talk what
they not what they not what they see

1492
00:27:45,549 --> 00:27:45,559
they not what they not what they see
 

1493
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:47,110
they not what they not what they see
because they see the same colors as we

1494
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:47,120
because they see the same colors as we
 

1495
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,990
because they see the same colors as we
see so it's not like they have they

1496
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:49,000
see so it's not like they have they
 

1497
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,750
see so it's not like they have they
don't they have a a weak a low color

1498
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:52,760
don't they have a a weak a low color
 

1499
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,029
don't they have a a weak a low color
palette and the things they're looking

1500
00:27:54,029 --> 00:27:54,039
palette and the things they're looking
 

1501
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,549
palette and the things they're looking
at they're looking at a lot of beautiful

1502
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:56,559
at they're looking at a lot of beautiful
 

1503
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,789
at they're looking at a lot of beautiful
scenery okay a lot of different colored

1504
00:27:59,789 --> 00:27:59,799
scenery okay a lot of different colored
 

1505
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:02,509
scenery okay a lot of different colored
uh flowers and berries and things and

1506
00:28:02,509 --> 00:28:02,519
uh flowers and berries and things and
 

1507
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:03,789
uh flowers and berries and things and
you know and so there's lots of things

1508
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:03,799
you know and so there's lots of things
 

1509
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:06,149
you know and so there's lots of things
of very bright colors but they just

1510
00:28:06,149 --> 00:28:06,159
of very bright colors but they just
 

1511
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,389
of very bright colors but they just
don't label the color in those cases and

1512
00:28:08,389 --> 00:28:08,399
don't label the color in those cases and
 

1513
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,350
don't label the color in those cases and
the reason probably we we don't know

1514
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:10,360
the reason probably we we don't know
 

1515
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,509
the reason probably we we don't know
this but we think probably what's going

1516
00:28:12,509 --> 00:28:12,519
this but we think probably what's going
 

1517
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:14,830
this but we think probably what's going
on here is that what you do why you

1518
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:14,840
on here is that what you do why you
 

1519
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,990
on here is that what you do why you
label something is you need to talk to

1520
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:17,000
label something is you need to talk to
 

1521
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,630
label something is you need to talk to
someone else about it and and why do I

1522
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:18,640
someone else about it and and why do I
 

1523
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,789
someone else about it and and why do I
need to talk about a color well if I

1524
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:20,799
need to talk about a color well if I
 

1525
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,909
need to talk about a color well if I
have two things which are identical and

1526
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:22,919
have two things which are identical and
 

1527
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:25,630
have two things which are identical and
I want you to give me the one that's

1528
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:25,640
I want you to give me the one that's
 

1529
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,669
I want you to give me the one that's
different and and the only way it varies

1530
00:28:27,669 --> 00:28:27,679
different and and the only way it varies
 

1531
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:28,710
different and and the only way it varies
is color

1532
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:28,720
is color
 

1533
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,110
is color
then I invent a word which tells you uh

1534
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:31,120
then I invent a word which tells you uh
 

1535
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,509
then I invent a word which tells you uh
you know this is the one I want so I

1536
00:28:32,509 --> 00:28:32,519
you know this is the one I want so I
 

1537
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:34,430
you know this is the one I want so I
want the red sweater off the rack not

1538
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:34,440
want the red sweater off the rack not
 

1539
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,750
want the red sweater off the rack not
the not the green sweater right there's

1540
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:35,760
the not the green sweater right there's
 

1541
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,389
the not the green sweater right there's
two and and so those those things will

1542
00:28:37,389 --> 00:28:37,399
two and and so those those things will
 

1543
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:39,470
two and and so those those things will
be identical ex because these are things

1544
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:39,480
be identical ex because these are things
 

1545
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,269
be identical ex because these are things
we made and they're died and there

1546
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:41,279
we made and they're died and there
 

1547
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,669
we made and they're died and there
there's nothing different about them and

1548
00:28:42,669 --> 00:28:42,679
there's nothing different about them and
 

1549
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,789
there's nothing different about them and
so in in industrialized Society we have

1550
00:28:45,789 --> 00:28:45,799
so in in industrialized Society we have
 

1551
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:47,990
so in in industrialized Society we have
you know everything everything we've got

1552
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:48,000
you know everything everything we've got
 

1553
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,470
you know everything everything we've got
is pretty much arbitrarily colored uh

1554
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:50,480
is pretty much arbitrarily colored uh
 

1555
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,509
is pretty much arbitrarily colored uh
but you go to non-industrialized group

1556
00:28:52,509 --> 00:28:52,519
but you go to non-industrialized group
 

1557
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:55,190
but you go to non-industrialized group
that's not true and so they don't re Sly

1558
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:55,200
that's not true and so they don't re Sly
 

1559
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,950
that's not true and so they don't re Sly
they're not interested in color you you

1560
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:56,960
they're not interested in color you you
 

1561
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,669
they're not interested in color you you
bring bright colored things to them they

1562
00:28:58,669 --> 00:28:58,679
bring bright colored things to them they
 

1563
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:01,149
bring bright colored things to them they
like them just like we like them bright

1564
00:29:01,149 --> 00:29:01,159
like them just like we like them bright
 

1565
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:03,470
like them just like we like them bright
colors are great they're beautiful they

1566
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:03,480
colors are great they're beautiful they
 

1567
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,669
colors are great they're beautiful they
are but they just don't need to don't

1568
00:29:05,669 --> 00:29:05,679
are but they just don't need to don't
 

1569
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,149
are but they just don't need to don't
need to talk about them they don't have

1570
00:29:07,149 --> 00:29:07,159
need to talk about them they don't have
 

1571
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:08,710
need to talk about them they don't have
so probably color words is a good

1572
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:08,720
so probably color words is a good
 

1573
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,269
so probably color words is a good
example of how language evolves from

1574
00:29:12,269 --> 00:29:12,279
example of how language evolves from
 

1575
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:14,070
example of how language evolves from
sort of function when you need to

1576
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:14,080
sort of function when you need to
 

1577
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,070
sort of function when you need to
communicate the use of something I think

1578
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:16,080
communicate the use of something I think
 

1579
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,630
communicate the use of something I think
so then then you kind of invent

1580
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:17,640
so then then you kind of invent
 

1581
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,750
so then then you kind of invent
different variations and uh and

1582
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:19,760
different variations and uh and
 

1583
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,750
different variations and uh and
basically you can imagine that the

1584
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:21,760
basically you can imagine that the
 

1585
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,310
basically you can imagine that the
evolution of a language has to do with

1586
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:23,320
evolution of a language has to do with
 

1587
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,990
evolution of a language has to do with
what the early tribe is doing like what

1588
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:26,000
what the early tribe is doing like what
 

1589
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,389
what the early tribe is doing like what
what they want what what kind of

1590
00:29:27,389 --> 00:29:27,399
what they want what what kind of
 

1591
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:29,110
what they want what what kind of
problems they're facing them and they're

1592
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:29,120
problems they're facing them and they're
 

1593
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,110
problems they're facing them and they're
quickly figuring out how to efficiently

1594
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:31,120
quickly figuring out how to efficiently
 

1595
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,149
quickly figuring out how to efficiently
communicate uh the solution to those

1596
00:29:33,149 --> 00:29:33,159
communicate uh the solution to those
 

1597
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:34,830
communicate uh the solution to those
problems whether it's aesthetic or

1598
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:34,840
problems whether it's aesthetic or
 

1599
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,310
problems whether it's aesthetic or
functional all that kind of stuff

1600
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:36,320
functional all that kind of stuff
 

1601
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,190
functional all that kind of stuff
running away from a mammoth or whatever

1602
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:39,200
running away from a mammoth or whatever
 

1603
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,350
running away from a mammoth or whatever
um but you know it's so so I think what

1604
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:41,360
um but you know it's so so I think what
 

1605
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,950
um but you know it's so so I think what
you're pointing to is that we don't have

1606
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:42,960
you're pointing to is that we don't have
 

1607
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,669
you're pointing to is that we don't have
data on the evolution of language

1608
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:45,679
data on the evolution of language
 

1609
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,350
data on the evolution of language
because many languages have formed a

1610
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:47,360
because many languages have formed a
 

1611
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,230
because many languages have formed a
long time ago so you don't get the

1612
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:49,240
long time ago so you don't get the
 

1613
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,149
long time ago so you don't get the
chatter we have a little bit of like Old

1614
00:29:52,149 --> 00:29:52,159
chatter we have a little bit of like Old
 

1615
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,470
chatter we have a little bit of like Old
English to Modern English because there

1616
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:54,480
English to Modern English because there
 

1617
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,350
English to Modern English because there
was a writing system and we can see how

1618
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:57,360
was a writing system and we can see how
 

1619
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,230
was a writing system and we can see how
how old English looked so the word order

1620
00:29:59,230 --> 00:29:59,240
how old English looked so the word order
 

1621
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,110
how old English looked so the word order
changed for instance in Old English to

1622
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:01,120
changed for instance in Old English to
 

1623
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,870
changed for instance in Old English to
Middle English to Modern English and so

1624
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:02,880
Middle English to Modern English and so
 

1625
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,230
Middle English to Modern English and so
it you know we can see things like that

1626
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:04,240
it you know we can see things like that
 

1627
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,029
it you know we can see things like that
but most languages don't even have a

1628
00:30:06,029 --> 00:30:06,039
but most languages don't even have a
 

1629
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:09,470
but most languages don't even have a
writing system so of the 7,000 only you

1630
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:09,480
writing system so of the 7,000 only you
 

1631
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,310
writing system so of the 7,000 only you
know a small subset of those have a

1632
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:11,320
know a small subset of those have a
 

1633
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,149
know a small subset of those have a
writing system and even if they have a

1634
00:30:13,149 --> 00:30:13,159
writing system and even if they have a
 

1635
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:14,950
writing system and even if they have a
writing system they it's not a very

1636
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:14,960
writing system they it's not a very
 

1637
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,549
writing system they it's not a very
modern writing system and so they don't

1638
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:16,559
modern writing system and so they don't
 

1639
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,230
modern writing system and so they don't
have it so we just basically have for

1640
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:18,240
have it so we just basically have for
 

1641
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,190
have it so we just basically have for
Mandarin for Chinese we have a lot of a

1642
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:21,200
Mandarin for Chinese we have a lot of a
 

1643
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,430
Mandarin for Chinese we have a lot of a
lot of evidence from from for a long

1644
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:23,440
lot of evidence from from for a long
 

1645
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,149
lot of evidence from from for a long
time and for English and not for much

1646
00:30:25,149 --> 00:30:25,159
time and for English and not for much
 

1647
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:27,230
time and for English and not for much
else not for in German a little bit but

1648
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:27,240
else not for in German a little bit but
 

1649
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,310
else not for in German a little bit but
not for a whole lot of like long-term um

1650
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:30,320
not for a whole lot of like long-term um
 

1651
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,110
not for a whole lot of like long-term um
language Evolution we don't have a lot

1652
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:32,120
language Evolution we don't have a lot
 

1653
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,750
language Evolution we don't have a lot
we just have snapshots is what we've got

1654
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:33,760
we just have snapshots is what we've got
 

1655
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,830
we just have snapshots is what we've got
of current languages yeah I you get an

1656
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:35,840
of current languages yeah I you get an
 

1657
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,990
of current languages yeah I you get an
inkling of that from the rapid

1658
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:38,000
inkling of that from the rapid
 

1659
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,630
inkling of that from the rapid
communication on certain platforms like

1660
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:39,640
communication on certain platforms like
 

1661
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,110
communication on certain platforms like
on Reddit there's different communities

1662
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:42,120
on Reddit there's different communities
 

1663
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,870
on Reddit there's different communities
and they'll come up with different slang

1664
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:43,880
and they'll come up with different slang
 

1665
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,870
and they'll come up with different slang
usually from my perspective during by a

1666
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:45,880
usually from my perspective during by a
 

1667
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,149
usually from my perspective during by a
little bit of humor um or maybe mockery

1668
00:30:49,149 --> 00:30:49,159
little bit of humor um or maybe mockery
 

1669
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:51,549
little bit of humor um or maybe mockery
or whatever it's you know just talking

1670
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:51,559
or whatever it's you know just talking
 

1671
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:54,389
or whatever it's you know just talking
 and different kinds of ways and uh

1672
00:30:54,389 --> 00:30:54,399
and different kinds of ways and uh
 

1673
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:55,870
and different kinds of ways and uh
you could see the

1674
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:55,880
you could see the
 

1675
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,990
you could see the
evolution of language there

1676
00:30:58,990 --> 00:30:59,000
evolution of language there
 

1677
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,789
evolution of language there
because um I think a lot of things on

1678
00:31:01,789 --> 00:31:01,799
because um I think a lot of things on
 

1679
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:04,029
because um I think a lot of things on
the internet you don't want to be the

1680
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:04,039
the internet you don't want to be the
 

1681
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:07,590
the internet you don't want to be the
boring mainstream so you like want to

1682
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:07,600
boring mainstream so you like want to
 

1683
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,629
boring mainstream so you like want to
deviate from the proper way of talking

1684
00:31:10,629 --> 00:31:10,639
deviate from the proper way of talking
 

1685
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:13,269
deviate from the proper way of talking
MH and so you get a lot of deviation

1686
00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:13,279
MH and so you get a lot of deviation
 

1687
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,750
MH and so you get a lot of deviation
like rapid deviation then when

1688
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:14,760
like rapid deviation then when
 

1689
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,149
like rapid deviation then when
communities Collide you get like uh just

1690
00:31:18,149 --> 00:31:18,159
communities Collide you get like uh just
 

1691
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,029
communities Collide you get like uh just
like you said humans adapt to it and you

1692
00:31:20,029 --> 00:31:20,039
like you said humans adapt to it and you
 

1693
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:22,110
like you said humans adapt to it and you
can see it through L of humor I mean

1694
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:22,120
can see it through L of humor I mean
 

1695
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,629
can see it through L of humor I mean
it's very difficult to study but you can

1696
00:31:23,629 --> 00:31:23,639
it's very difficult to study but you can
 

1697
00:31:23,639 --> 00:31:25,950
it's very difficult to study but you can
imagine like 100 years from now well if

1698
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:25,960
imagine like 100 years from now well if
 

1699
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,909
imagine like 100 years from now well if
there's a new language born for example

1700
00:31:27,909 --> 00:31:27,919
there's a new language born for example
 

1701
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,029
there's a new language born for example
will get really high resolution data on

1702
00:31:30,029 --> 00:31:30,039
will get really high resolution data on
 

1703
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:32,110
will get really high resolution data on
I mean English is changing English

1704
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:32,120
I mean English is changing English
 

1705
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,590
I mean English is changing English
changes all the time all languages

1706
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:33,600
changes all the time all languages
 

1707
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,509
changes all the time all languages
change all the time so you know there

1708
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:35,519
change all the time so you know there
 

1709
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,710
change all the time so you know there
the famous um result about the queen's

1710
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:39,720
the famous um result about the queen's
 

1711
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,590
the famous um result about the queen's
English so the que if you look at the

1712
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:41,600
English so the que if you look at the
 

1713
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,350
English so the que if you look at the
Queen's vowels the queen's English is

1714
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:43,360
Queen's vowels the queen's English is
 

1715
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,789
Queen's vowels the queen's English is
supposed to be you know originally the

1716
00:31:45,789 --> 00:31:45,799
supposed to be you know originally the
 

1717
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:47,549
supposed to be you know originally the
proper way for the talk was sort of

1718
00:31:47,549 --> 00:31:47,559
proper way for the talk was sort of
 

1719
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:49,629
proper way for the talk was sort of
defined by whoever the queen talked or

1720
00:31:49,629 --> 00:31:49,639
defined by whoever the queen talked or
 

1721
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:52,110
defined by whoever the queen talked or
the king whoever was in charge and uh

1722
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:52,120
the king whoever was in charge and uh
 

1723
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,750
the king whoever was in charge and uh
and and so if you look at the how her

1724
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:53,760
and and so if you look at the how her
 

1725
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,909
and and so if you look at the how her
vowels changed uh from when she be first

1726
00:31:57,909 --> 00:31:57,919
vowels changed uh from when she be first
 

1727
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,070
vowels changed uh from when she be first
became Queen in 1952 or 53 when she was

1728
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:00,080
became Queen in 1952 or 53 when she was
 

1729
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,350
became Queen in 1952 or 53 when she was
car the first I mean that's Queen

1730
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:01,360
car the first I mean that's Queen
 

1731
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,190
car the first I mean that's Queen
Elizabeth who's got who died recently of

1732
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:03,200
Elizabeth who's got who died recently of
 

1733
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,669
Elizabeth who's got who died recently of
course uh until you know 50 years later

1734
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:05,679
course uh until you know 50 years later
 

1735
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,549
course uh until you know 50 years later
her vowels changed her vowels shifted a

1736
00:32:07,549 --> 00:32:07,559
her vowels changed her vowels shifted a
 

1737
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,950
her vowels changed her vowels shifted a
lot and so that you know even in the

1738
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:09,960
lot and so that you know even in the
 

1739
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,389
lot and so that you know even in the
sounds of British English in her the way

1740
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:13,399
sounds of British English in her the way
 

1741
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:15,590
sounds of British English in her the way
she was talking was changing the vowels

1742
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:15,600
she was talking was changing the vowels
 

1743
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,909
she was talking was changing the vowels
were changing slightly so that's just in

1744
00:32:17,909 --> 00:32:17,919
were changing slightly so that's just in
 

1745
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,629
were changing slightly so that's just in
the sounds there's change I don't know

1746
00:32:19,629 --> 00:32:19,639
the sounds there's change I don't know
 

1747
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:21,549
the sounds there's change I don't know
what's you know we're we're I'm

1748
00:32:21,549 --> 00:32:21,559
what's you know we're we're I'm
 

1749
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:22,669
what's you know we're we're I'm
interested we're all interested in

1750
00:32:22,669 --> 00:32:22,679
interested we're all interested in
 

1751
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:24,629
interested we're all interested in
what's driving any of these changes the

1752
00:32:24,629 --> 00:32:24,639
what's driving any of these changes the
 

1753
00:32:24,639 --> 00:32:26,789
what's driving any of these changes the
the word order of English changed a lot

1754
00:32:26,789 --> 00:32:26,799
the word order of English changed a lot
 

1755
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,950
the word order of English changed a lot
over Thousand Years right so it used to

1756
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:28,960
over Thousand Years right so it used to
 

1757
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,110
over Thousand Years right so it used to
look like German you know it looks it

1758
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:31,120
look like German you know it looks it
 

1759
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,990
look like German you know it looks it
used to be a verb final language with

1760
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:33,000
used to be a verb final language with
 

1761
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,389
used to be a verb final language with
case marking and it shifted to a verb

1762
00:32:35,389 --> 00:32:35,399
case marking and it shifted to a verb
 

1763
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:37,310
case marking and it shifted to a verb
medial language a lot of contact so a

1764
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:37,320
medial language a lot of contact so a
 

1765
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,990
medial language a lot of contact so a
lot of contact with French and it became

1766
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:40,000
lot of contact with French and it became
 

1767
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,990
lot of contact with French and it became
a verb medial language with no case

1768
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:42,000
a verb medial language with no case
 

1769
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,870
a verb medial language with no case
marking and so it became this you know

1770
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:43,880
marking and so it became this you know
 

1771
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,830
marking and so it became this you know
verb verb initially thing so and so

1772
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:46,840
verb verb initially thing so and so
 

1773
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,029
verb verb initially thing so and so
that's evolving we it totally evolved

1774
00:32:49,029 --> 00:32:49,039
that's evolving we it totally evolved
 

1775
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,870
that's evolving we it totally evolved
and so it may very well I mean you know

1776
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:50,880
and so it may very well I mean you know
 

1777
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,870
and so it may very well I mean you know
it doesn't evolve maybe very much in 20

1778
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:52,880
it doesn't evolve maybe very much in 20
 

1779
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,669
it doesn't evolve maybe very much in 20
years is maybe what you're talking about

1780
00:32:54,669 --> 00:32:54,679
years is maybe what you're talking about
 

1781
00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:56,629
years is maybe what you're talking about
but over 50 and 100 years things change

1782
00:32:56,629 --> 00:32:56,639
but over 50 and 100 years things change
 

1783
00:32:56,639 --> 00:32:58,870
but over 50 and 100 years things change
a lot I I think will now have good data

1784
00:32:58,870 --> 00:32:58,880
a lot I I think will now have good data
 

1785
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,110
a lot I I think will now have good data
on it which is great that's for sure um

1786
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:01,120
on it which is great that's for sure um
 

1787
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,110
on it which is great that's for sure um
can you talk to what is syntax and what

1788
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:03,120
can you talk to what is syntax and what
 

1789
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,990
can you talk to what is syntax and what
is grammar so you wrote a book on syntax

1790
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:06,000
is grammar so you wrote a book on syntax
 

1791
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,990
is grammar so you wrote a book on syntax
I did you were asking me before about

1792
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,000
I did you were asking me before about
 

1793
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,509
I did you were asking me before about
what you know how do I figure out what a

1794
00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:09,519
what you know how do I figure out what a
 

1795
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,789
what you know how do I figure out what a
dependency structure is I'd say the

1796
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:11,799
dependency structure is I'd say the
 

1797
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:13,389
dependency structure is I'd say the
dependency structures aren't that hard

1798
00:33:13,389 --> 00:33:13,399
dependency structures aren't that hard
 

1799
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:14,909
dependency structures aren't that hard
to generally I think there's a lot of

1800
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:14,919
to generally I think there's a lot of
 

1801
00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:16,909
to generally I think there's a lot of
agreement of what they of what they are

1802
00:33:16,909 --> 00:33:16,919
agreement of what they of what they are
 

1803
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:19,149
agreement of what they of what they are
for almost any sentence in in most

1804
00:33:19,149 --> 00:33:19,159
for almost any sentence in in most
 

1805
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:20,549
for almost any sentence in in most
languages I think people will agree on a

1806
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:20,559
languages I think people will agree on a
 

1807
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:21,549
languages I think people will agree on a
lot of

1808
00:33:21,549 --> 00:33:21,559
lot of
 

1809
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:24,950
lot of
that there are other parameters in the

1810
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:24,960
that there are other parameters in the
 

1811
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,870
that there are other parameters in the
mix such that some people think there's

1812
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:26,880
mix such that some people think there's
 

1813
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,990
mix such that some people think there's
a more complicated grammar than just a

1814
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:29,000
a more complicated grammar than just a
 

1815
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,590
a more complicated grammar than just a
dependency structure and so you know

1816
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:30,600
dependency structure and so you know
 

1817
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,029
dependency structure and so you know
like n chsky he's the most famous

1818
00:33:33,029 --> 00:33:33,039
like n chsky he's the most famous
 

1819
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:37,070
like n chsky he's the most famous
linguist ever uh and he he is famous for

1820
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:37,080
linguist ever uh and he he is famous for
 

1821
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,990
linguist ever uh and he he is famous for
proposing a a a slightly more

1822
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:39,000
proposing a a a slightly more
 

1823
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,509
proposing a a a slightly more
complicated syntax and so he he invented

1824
00:33:42,509 --> 00:33:42,519
complicated syntax and so he he invented
 

1825
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:45,470
complicated syntax and so he he invented
phrase structure grammar so he's um well

1826
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:45,480
phrase structure grammar so he's um well
 

1827
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,110
phrase structure grammar so he's um well
known for many many things but in the

1828
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:47,120
known for many many things but in the
 

1829
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,149
known for many many things but in the
50s in early 60s like but late 50s he

1830
00:33:50,149 --> 00:33:50,159
50s in early 60s like but late 50s he
 

1831
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,269
50s in early 60s like but late 50s he
was basically figuring out what's called

1832
00:33:52,269 --> 00:33:52,279
was basically figuring out what's called
 

1833
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:55,350
was basically figuring out what's called
formal language Theory so and he uh

1834
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:55,360
formal language Theory so and he uh
 

1835
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,269
formal language Theory so and he uh
figured out sort of a framework for

1836
00:33:58,269 --> 00:33:58,279
figured out sort of a framework for
 

1837
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:00,430
figured out sort of a framework for
figuring out how complicated langu you

1838
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:00,440
figuring out how complicated langu you
 

1839
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,470
figuring out how complicated langu you
know a certain type of language might be

1840
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:02,480
know a certain type of language might be
 

1841
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,430
know a certain type of language might be
so-called phrase structured grammars of

1842
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:04,440
so-called phrase structured grammars of
 

1843
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,669
so-called phrase structured grammars of
language might be and so he his his idea

1844
00:34:08,669 --> 00:34:08,679
language might be and so he his his idea
 

1845
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:11,829
language might be and so he his his idea
was that maybe we can we can think about

1846
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:11,839
was that maybe we can we can think about
 

1847
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:14,230
was that maybe we can we can think about
the complexity of a language by how

1848
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:14,240
the complexity of a language by how
 

1849
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,430
the complexity of a language by how
complicated the rules are okay and the

1850
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:16,440
complicated the rules are okay and the
 

1851
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,230
complicated the rules are okay and the
rules will look like this they will have

1852
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:19,240
rules will look like this they will have
 

1853
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,669
rules will look like this they will have
a left hand side and will have a right

1854
00:34:21,669 --> 00:34:21,679
a left hand side and will have a right
 

1855
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,430
a left hand side and will have a right
right hand side something on the left

1856
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:23,440
right hand side something on the left
 

1857
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,829
right hand side something on the left
hand side will expand to the thing on

1858
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:24,839
hand side will expand to the thing on
 

1859
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:26,030
hand side will expand to the thing on
the right hand side so we'll say we'll

1860
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:26,040
the right hand side so we'll say we'll
 

1861
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,149
the right hand side so we'll say we'll
start with an a an S which is like the

1862
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:28,159
start with an a an S which is like the
 

1863
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,589
start with an a an S which is like the
root which is an a sentence okay and

1864
00:34:30,589 --> 00:34:30,599
root which is an a sentence okay and
 

1865
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:32,990
root which is an a sentence okay and
then we're going to expand to things uh

1866
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:33,000
then we're going to expand to things uh
 

1867
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,990
then we're going to expand to things uh
like a noun phrase and a verb phrase is

1868
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:35,000
like a noun phrase and a verb phrase is
 

1869
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,230
like a noun phrase and a verb phrase is
what he would say for instance okay an S

1870
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:37,240
what he would say for instance okay an S
 

1871
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,230
what he would say for instance okay an S
goes to an NP and a VP is a kind of a

1872
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:39,240
goes to an NP and a VP is a kind of a
 

1873
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,990
goes to an NP and a VP is a kind of a
phrase structure Rule and then and we

1874
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:41,000
phrase structure Rule and then and we
 

1875
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,950
phrase structure Rule and then and we
figure out what an NP is an NP is a a a

1876
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:43,960
figure out what an NP is an NP is a a a
 

1877
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,109
figure out what an NP is an NP is a a a
determiner and a noun for instance and a

1878
00:34:46,109 --> 00:34:46,119
determiner and a noun for instance and a
 

1879
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:48,030
determiner and a noun for instance and a
verb verb phrase is something else is a

1880
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:48,040
verb verb phrase is something else is a
 

1881
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,750
verb verb phrase is something else is a
verb and another noun phrase and another

1882
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:49,760
verb and another noun phrase and another
 

1883
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,990
verb and another noun phrase and another
npce for instance those are the rules of

1884
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:52,000
npce for instance those are the rules of
 

1885
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,310
npce for instance those are the rules of
a very simple phrase structure okay and

1886
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:55,320
a very simple phrase structure okay and
 

1887
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,870
a very simple phrase structure okay and
and so he he proposed phrase structure

1888
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:57,880
and so he he proposed phrase structure
 

1889
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,390
and so he he proposed phrase structure
grammar as a way to sort of cover human

1890
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:00,400
grammar as a way to sort of cover human
 

1891
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,910
grammar as a way to sort of cover human
languages and then he actually figured

1892
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:01,920
languages and then he actually figured
 

1893
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,470
languages and then he actually figured
out that well depending on the

1894
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:03,480
out that well depending on the
 

1895
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,150
out that well depending on the
formalization of those grammars you

1896
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:05,160
formalization of those grammars you
 

1897
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,190
formalization of those grammars you
might get more complicated or less

1898
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:07,200
might get more complicated or less
 

1899
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,750
might get more complicated or less
complicated languages so you could he

1900
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:08,760
complicated languages so you could he
 

1901
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,310
complicated languages so you could he
could he said well you these are these

1902
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:10,320
could he said well you these are these
 

1903
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,470
could he said well you these are these
are things called you know um context

1904
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:12,480
are things called you know um context
 

1905
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,670
are things called you know um context
free languages that rule that he thought

1906
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:14,680
free languages that rule that he thought
 

1907
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,510
free languages that rule that he thought
you know human languages tend to be what

1908
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:16,520
you know human languages tend to be what
 

1909
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,910
you know human languages tend to be what
he calls context free languages um and

1910
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:19,920
he calls context free languages um and
 

1911
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,150
he calls context free languages um and
but there are simpler languages which

1912
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:21,160
but there are simpler languages which
 

1913
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,109
but there are simpler languages which
are so-called regular languages and they

1914
00:35:23,109 --> 00:35:23,119
are so-called regular languages and they
 

1915
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:25,270
are so-called regular languages and they
have a more a more constrained form to

1916
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:25,280
have a more a more constrained form to
 

1917
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,470
have a more a more constrained form to
the rules of the of the phrase structure

1918
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:27,480
the rules of the of the phrase structure
 

1919
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,510
the rules of the of the phrase structure
of of these particular rules so he he

1920
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:29,520
of of these particular rules so he he
 

1921
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,870
of of these particular rules so he he
basically discovered and kind of

1922
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:31,880
basically discovered and kind of
 

1923
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,230
basically discovered and kind of
invented ways to describe the language

1924
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:35,240
invented ways to describe the language
 

1925
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,470
invented ways to describe the language
and and those are phrase those are

1926
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:36,480
and and those are phrase those are
 

1927
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,950
and and those are phrase those are
phrase structure a human language and he

1928
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:38,960
phrase structure a human language and he
 

1929
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,990
phrase structure a human language and he
was mostly interested in English

1930
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:41,000
was mostly interested in English
 

1931
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,310
was mostly interested in English
initially in his his work in the 50s so

1932
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:43,320
initially in his his work in the 50s so
 

1933
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,670
initially in his his work in the 50s so
a quick questions around all this so

1934
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:44,680
a quick questions around all this so
 

1935
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,910
a quick questions around all this so
former language theory is The Big Field

1936
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:46,920
former language theory is The Big Field
 

1937
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,910
former language theory is The Big Field
of just studying language formally yes

1938
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:49,920
of just studying language formally yes
 

1939
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,230
of just studying language formally yes
and it doesn't have to be human language

1940
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:51,240
and it doesn't have to be human language
 

1941
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,910
and it doesn't have to be human language
there we have computer languages any

1942
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:52,920
there we have computer languages any
 

1943
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,069
there we have computer languages any
kind of system which is generating a uh

1944
00:35:57,069 --> 00:35:57,079
kind of system which is generating a uh
 

1945
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:58,190
kind of system which is generating a uh
a um

1946
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:58,200
a um
 

1947
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,589
a um
some set of um expressions in a language

1948
00:36:01,589 --> 00:36:01,599
some set of um expressions in a language
 

1949
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:05,309
some set of um expressions in a language
and those could be like the the um you

1950
00:36:05,309 --> 00:36:05,319
and those could be like the the um you
 

1951
00:36:05,319 --> 00:36:07,069
and those could be like the the um you
know the statements in a in a computer

1952
00:36:07,069 --> 00:36:07,079
know the statements in a in a computer
 

1953
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:08,870
know the statements in a in a computer
language for example so formal it could

1954
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:08,880
language for example so formal it could
 

1955
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,390
language for example so formal it could
be that or it could be human language so

1956
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:10,400
be that or it could be human language so
 

1957
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,230
be that or it could be human language so
technically you can study programming

1958
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:12,240
technically you can study programming
 

1959
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,750
technically you can study programming
languages ab and have been been heavily

1960
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:14,760
languages ab and have been been heavily
 

1961
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,349
languages ab and have been been heavily
studied using this formalism there

1962
00:36:16,349 --> 00:36:16,359
studied using this formalism there
 

1963
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:18,069
studied using this formalism there
there's a big field of programming

1964
00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:18,079
there's a big field of programming
 

1965
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,829
there's a big field of programming
languages within the formal language

1966
00:36:20,829 --> 00:36:20,839
languages within the formal language
 

1967
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:23,630
languages within the formal language
okay and then phrase structure grammar

1968
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:23,640
okay and then phrase structure grammar
 

1969
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,550
okay and then phrase structure grammar
is this idea that you can break down

1970
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:25,560
is this idea that you can break down
 

1971
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,829
is this idea that you can break down
language into this s npvp

1972
00:36:28,829 --> 00:36:28,839
language into this s npvp
 

1973
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:32,230
language into this s npvp
it's a particular formalism for

1974
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:32,240
it's a particular formalism for
 

1975
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,190
it's a particular formalism for
describing language okay so and chsky

1976
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:34,200
describing language okay so and chsky
 

1977
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,270
describing language okay so and chsky
was the first one he's the one who

1978
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:35,280
was the first one he's the one who
 

1979
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,430
was the first one he's the one who
figured that stuff out back in the 50s

1980
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:37,440
figured that stuff out back in the 50s
 

1981
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,109
figured that stuff out back in the 50s
and and and but he and and that's

1982
00:36:40,109 --> 00:36:40,119
and and and but he and and that's
 

1983
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:42,030
and and and but he and and that's
equivalent actually the this the context

1984
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:42,040
equivalent actually the this the context
 

1985
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,550
equivalent actually the this the context
free grammar is actually is kind of

1986
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:43,560
free grammar is actually is kind of
 

1987
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,589
free grammar is actually is kind of
equivalent in the sense that it

1988
00:36:44,589 --> 00:36:44,599
equivalent in the sense that it
 

1989
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:46,790
equivalent in the sense that it
generates the same sentences as a

1990
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:46,800
generates the same sentences as a
 

1991
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,390
generates the same sentences as a
dependency grammar would you know as the

1992
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:49,400
dependency grammar would you know as the
 

1993
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,109
dependency grammar would you know as the
dependency grammar is a little simpler

1994
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:51,119
dependency grammar is a little simpler
 

1995
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,109
dependency grammar is a little simpler
in some way you just have a root and it

1996
00:36:53,109 --> 00:36:53,119
in some way you just have a root and it
 

1997
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,109
in some way you just have a root and it
goes like we don't have any of these the

1998
00:36:55,109 --> 00:36:55,119
goes like we don't have any of these the
 

1999
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,910
goes like we don't have any of these the
the rules are implicit I guess in and we

2000
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:57,920
the rules are implicit I guess in and we
 

2001
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,470
the rules are implicit I guess in and we
just have connections between words the

2002
00:36:59,470 --> 00:36:59,480
just have connections between words the
 

2003
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,990
just have connections between words the
phrase structure grammar is a kind of a

2004
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:01,000
phrase structure grammar is a kind of a
 

2005
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,510
phrase structure grammar is a kind of a
different way to think about the the

2006
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:03,520
different way to think about the the
 

2007
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,230
different way to think about the the
dependency grammar it's slightly more

2008
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:05,240
dependency grammar it's slightly more
 

2009
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,109
dependency grammar it's slightly more
complicated but it's kind of the same in

2010
00:37:07,109 --> 00:37:07,119
complicated but it's kind of the same in
 

2011
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,190
complicated but it's kind of the same in
some ways so to clarify dependency

2012
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:10,200
some ways so to clarify dependency
 

2013
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,990
some ways so to clarify dependency
grammar is the framework under which you

2014
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:13,000
grammar is the framework under which you
 

2015
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,550
grammar is the framework under which you
see language and you make the case that

2016
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:14,560
see language and you make the case that
 

2017
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,430
see language and you make the case that
this is a good way to describe language

2018
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:17,440
this is a good way to describe language
 

2019
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,470
this is a good way to describe language
that's correct and uh no Nome jsky is

2020
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:20,480
that's correct and uh no Nome jsky is
 

2021
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,270
that's correct and uh no Nome jsky is
watching this is very upset right now so

2022
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:22,280
watching this is very upset right now so
 

2023
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,190
watching this is very upset right now so
let's uh I'm just kidding but uh what's

2024
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:25,200
let's uh I'm just kidding but uh what's
 

2025
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,270
let's uh I'm just kidding but uh what's
the difference between uh where's the

2026
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:27,280
the difference between uh where's the
 

2027
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,750
the difference between uh where's the
the place of disagreement um between

2028
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:30,760
the place of disagreement um between
 

2029
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,750
the place of disagreement um between
phrase structure grammar and dependency

2030
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:32,760
phrase structure grammar and dependency
 

2031
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,309
phrase structure grammar and dependency
grammar they're they're very close so

2032
00:37:34,309 --> 00:37:34,319
grammar they're they're very close so
 

2033
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:35,750
grammar they're they're very close so
phrase structure grammar and dependency

2034
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:35,760
phrase structure grammar and dependency
 

2035
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,270
phrase structure grammar and dependency
grammar aren't that aren't that far

2036
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:37,280
grammar aren't that aren't that far
 

2037
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,470
grammar aren't that aren't that far
apart I I I like dependency grammar

2038
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:40,480
apart I I I like dependency grammar
 

2039
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,710
apart I I I like dependency grammar
because it's more perspicuous it's more

2040
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:42,720
because it's more perspicuous it's more
 

2041
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,670
because it's more perspicuous it's more
transparent about representing the

2042
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:44,680
transparent about representing the
 

2043
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,309
transparent about representing the
connections between the words it's just

2044
00:37:46,309 --> 00:37:46,319
connections between the words it's just
 

2045
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:47,589
connections between the words it's just
a little harder to see in phrase

2046
00:37:47,589 --> 00:37:47,599
a little harder to see in phrase
 

2047
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,390
a little harder to see in phrase
structure grammar you know the the place

2048
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:49,400
structure grammar you know the the place
 

2049
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,109
structure grammar you know the the place
where Chomsky sort of devolved or went

2050
00:37:52,109 --> 00:37:52,119
where Chomsky sort of devolved or went
 

2051
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:54,990
where Chomsky sort of devolved or went
off from from from this is he also

2052
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:55,000
off from from from this is he also
 

2053
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,190
off from from from this is he also
thought there was um something called M

2054
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:58,200
thought there was um something called M
 

2055
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,190
thought there was um something called M
okay and so so and that's where we

2056
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:00,200
okay and so so and that's where we
 

2057
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,750
okay and so so and that's where we
disagree okay that's the place where I

2058
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:01,760
disagree okay that's the place where I
 

2059
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,790
disagree okay that's the place where I
would say we disagree and and and I mean

2060
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:03,800
would say we disagree and and and I mean
 

2061
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,190
would say we disagree and and and I mean
we maybe we'll get into that later but

2062
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:05,200
we maybe we'll get into that later but
 

2063
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,390
we maybe we'll get into that later but
the idea is if you want to do you want

2064
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:07,400
the idea is if you want to do you want
 

2065
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,990
the idea is if you want to do you want
me to explain that now I would love can

2066
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:09,000
me to explain that now I would love can
 

2067
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,829
me to explain that now I would love can
you to explain movement movement okay so

2068
00:38:10,829 --> 00:38:10,839
you to explain movement movement okay so
 

2069
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:12,109
you to explain movement movement okay so
you're saying so many interesting things

2070
00:38:12,109 --> 00:38:12,119
you're saying so many interesting things
 

2071
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:13,230
you're saying so many interesting things
yeah yeah yeah okay so here's the

2072
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:13,240
yeah yeah yeah okay so here's the
 

2073
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,510
yeah yeah yeah okay so here's the
movement is Chomsky basically sees

2074
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:15,520
movement is Chomsky basically sees
 

2075
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,069
movement is Chomsky basically sees
English and he says okay I said um you

2076
00:38:18,069 --> 00:38:18,079
English and he says okay I said um you
 

2077
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,589
English and he says okay I said um you
know we had that sentence earlier like

2078
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:20,599
know we had that sentence earlier like
 

2079
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:22,069
know we had that sentence earlier like
it was like two dogs enter the room it's

2080
00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:22,079
it was like two dogs enter the room it's
 

2081
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,069
it was like two dogs enter the room it's
changed a little bit say two dogs will

2082
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:24,079
changed a little bit say two dogs will
 

2083
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,670
changed a little bit say two dogs will
enter the room and he notices that hey

2084
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:26,680
enter the room and he notices that hey
 

2085
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,470
enter the room and he notices that hey
English if I want to make a question a

2086
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:29,480
English if I want to make a question a
 

2087
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,710
English if I want to make a question a
yes no question from that same sentence

2088
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:31,720
yes no question from that same sentence
 

2089
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,630
yes no question from that same sentence
I I say instead of two dogs will enter

2090
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:33,640
I I say instead of two dogs will enter
 

2091
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,510
I I say instead of two dogs will enter
the room I say will two dogs enter the

2092
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:35,520
the room I say will two dogs enter the
 

2093
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,390
the room I say will two dogs enter the
room okay there's a different way to to

2094
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:38,400
room okay there's a different way to to
 

2095
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,150
room okay there's a different way to to
say the same idea and it's like well the

2096
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:40,160
say the same idea and it's like well the
 

2097
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,870
say the same idea and it's like well the
auxiliary verb that will thing it's at

2098
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:42,880
auxiliary verb that will thing it's at
 

2099
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,910
auxiliary verb that will thing it's at
the front as opposed to in the middle

2100
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:44,920
the front as opposed to in the middle
 

2101
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,030
the front as opposed to in the middle
okay and so and he looked you know if

2102
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:47,040
okay and so and he looked you know if
 

2103
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,829
okay and so and he looked you know if
you look at English you see that that's

2104
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:48,839
you look at English you see that that's
 

2105
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:51,670
you look at English you see that that's
true for all those modal verbs and for

2106
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:51,680
true for all those modal verbs and for
 

2107
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,950
true for all those modal verbs and for
other kinds of auxiliary verbs in

2108
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:52,960
other kinds of auxiliary verbs in
 

2109
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,510
other kinds of auxiliary verbs in
English you always do that you always

2110
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:54,520
English you always do that you always
 

2111
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,109
English you always do that you always
put an auxiliary verb at the front and

2112
00:38:57,109 --> 00:38:57,119
put an auxiliary verb at the front and
 

2113
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,950
put an auxiliary verb at the front and
and what he when he saw that so you know

2114
00:38:58,950 --> 00:38:58,960
and what he when he saw that so you know
 

2115
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,030
and what he when he saw that so you know
if I say um I can win this bet can I win

2116
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:02,040
if I say um I can win this bet can I win
 

2117
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,870
if I say um I can win this bet can I win
this bet right so I move a can to the

2118
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:03,880
this bet right so I move a can to the
 

2119
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,470
this bet right so I move a can to the
front so actually that's a theory I just

2120
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:06,480
front so actually that's a theory I just
 

2121
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,230
front so actually that's a theory I just
gave you a theory there I he he talks

2122
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:08,240
gave you a theory there I he he talks
 

2123
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,030
gave you a theory there I he he talks
about it as movement that word in the

2124
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:11,040
about it as movement that word in the
 

2125
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,990
about it as movement that word in the
thinks the declarative is the root is is

2126
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:13,000
thinks the declarative is the root is is
 

2127
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,510
thinks the declarative is the root is is
the sort of default way to think about

2128
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:14,520
the sort of default way to think about
 

2129
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,990
the sort of default way to think about
the sentence and you move the auxiliary

2130
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:17,000
the sentence and you move the auxiliary
 

2131
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,550
the sentence and you move the auxiliary
verb to the front that's a movement

2132
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:18,560
verb to the front that's a movement
 

2133
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,309
verb to the front that's a movement
Theory okay and he he just thought that

2134
00:39:20,309 --> 00:39:20,319
Theory okay and he he just thought that
 

2135
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:24,150
Theory okay and he he just thought that
was just so obvious that it must be true

2136
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:24,160
was just so obvious that it must be true
 

2137
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,470
was just so obvious that it must be true
that that that there's nothing more to

2138
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:25,480
that that that there's nothing more to
 

2139
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,710
that that that there's nothing more to
say about that that this is how

2140
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:27,720
say about that that this is how
 

2141
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,910
say about that that this is how
auxiliary verbs work in English there's

2142
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:29,920
auxiliary verbs work in English there's
 

2143
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,670
auxiliary verbs work in English there's
a movement rule such that you're move

2144
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:32,680
a movement rule such that you're move
 

2145
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,270
a movement rule such that you're move
like to get from the declarative to the

2146
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:34,280
like to get from the declarative to the
 

2147
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,589
like to get from the declarative to the
interrogative you're moving the

2148
00:39:35,589 --> 00:39:35,599
interrogative you're moving the
 

2149
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:36,990
interrogative you're moving the
auxiliary to the front and it's a little

2150
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:37,000
auxiliary to the front and it's a little
 

2151
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,309
auxiliary to the front and it's a little
more complicated as soon as you go to

2152
00:39:39,309 --> 00:39:39,319
more complicated as soon as you go to
 

2153
00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:42,030
more complicated as soon as you go to
simple simple present and simple past

2154
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:42,040
simple simple present and simple past
 

2155
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,470
simple simple present and simple past
because you know if I say you know John

2156
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:43,480
because you know if I say you know John
 

2157
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,589
because you know if I say you know John
slept you have to say did JN sleep not

2158
00:39:46,589 --> 00:39:46,599
slept you have to say did JN sleep not
 

2159
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:48,550
slept you have to say did JN sleep not
slept John right and so it's you have to

2160
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:48,560
slept John right and so it's you have to
 

2161
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,069
slept John right and so it's you have to
somehow get an auxiliary verb and I

2162
00:39:50,069 --> 00:39:50,079
somehow get an auxiliary verb and I
 

2163
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,150
somehow get an auxiliary verb and I
guess underlyingly it's like slept is

2164
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:53,160
guess underlyingly it's like slept is
 

2165
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,589
guess underlyingly it's like slept is
it's a little more complicated than that

2166
00:39:54,589 --> 00:39:54,599
it's a little more complicated than that
 

2167
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:55,790
it's a little more complicated than that
but his that's his idea there's a

2168
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:55,800
but his that's his idea there's a
 

2169
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,030
but his that's his idea there's a
movement okay and and and so a different

2170
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:58,040
movement okay and and and so a different
 

2171
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,829
movement okay and and and so a different
way to think about that that isn't I

2172
00:39:59,829 --> 00:39:59,839
way to think about that that isn't I
 

2173
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:01,750
way to think about that that isn't I
mean the then then he ended up showing

2174
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:01,760
mean the then then he ended up showing
 

2175
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,109
mean the then then he ended up showing
later so he proposed this theory of

2176
00:40:04,109 --> 00:40:04,119
later so he proposed this theory of
 

2177
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:05,670
later so he proposed this theory of
grammar which has movement there's other

2178
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:05,680
grammar which has movement there's other
 

2179
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,190
grammar which has movement there's other
places where he thought there's movement

2180
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:07,200
places where he thought there's movement
 

2181
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,670
places where he thought there's movement
not just auxiliary verbs but things like

2182
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:09,680
not just auxiliary verbs but things like
 

2183
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,349
not just auxiliary verbs but things like
the passive in English and things like

2184
00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:12,359
the passive in English and things like
 

2185
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:15,109
the passive in English and things like
um questions wh questions a bunch of

2186
00:40:15,109 --> 00:40:15,119
um questions wh questions a bunch of
 

2187
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,430
um questions wh questions a bunch of
places where he thought there's also

2188
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:16,440
places where he thought there's also
 

2189
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,910
places where he thought there's also
movement going on and and in each each

2190
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:18,920
movement going on and and in each each
 

2191
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,470
movement going on and and in each each
one of those these things there's words

2192
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:20,480
one of those these things there's words
 

2193
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,589
one of those these things there's words
well phrases and words are moving around

2194
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:22,599
well phrases and words are moving around
 

2195
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:23,870
well phrases and words are moving around
from one structure to another what you

2196
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:23,880
from one structure to another what you
 

2197
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,309
from one structure to another what you
call Deep structure to surface structure

2198
00:40:25,309 --> 00:40:25,319
call Deep structure to surface structure
 

2199
00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:26,710
call Deep structure to surface structure
I mean there's like two different

2200
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:26,720
I mean there's like two different
 

2201
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,630
I mean there's like two different
structures in his in his theory okay um

2202
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:29,640
structures in his in his theory okay um
 

2203
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,910
structures in his in his theory okay um
there's a different way to think about

2204
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:30,920
there's a different way to think about
 

2205
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,349
there's a different way to think about
this um which is there's no movement at

2206
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:33,359
this um which is there's no movement at
 

2207
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:38,030
this um which is there's no movement at
all there's a lexical copying rule such

2208
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:38,040
all there's a lexical copying rule such
 

2209
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,270
all there's a lexical copying rule such
that the word will or the word can these

2210
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:40,280
that the word will or the word can these
 

2211
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,150
that the word will or the word can these
these auxiliary verbs they just have two

2212
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:42,160
these auxiliary verbs they just have two
 

2213
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,630
these auxiliary verbs they just have two
forms and and and one of them is the

2214
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:44,640
forms and and and one of them is the
 

2215
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,870
forms and and and one of them is the
declarative and one of them is

2216
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:45,880
declarative and one of them is
 

2217
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,190
declarative and one of them is
interrogative and you basically have the

2218
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:47,200
interrogative and you basically have the
 

2219
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,710
interrogative and you basically have the
declarative one and oh I form the

2220
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:49,720
declarative one and oh I form the
 

2221
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,630
declarative one and oh I form the
interrogative or I can form one from the

2222
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:51,640
interrogative or I can form one from the
 

2223
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,710
interrogative or I can form one from the
other it doesn't matter which direction

2224
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:52,720
other it doesn't matter which direction
 

2225
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,829
other it doesn't matter which direction
you go and and I just have a new entry

2226
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:55,839
you go and and I just have a new entry
 

2227
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,109
you go and and I just have a new entry
which has the same meaning which has a

2228
00:40:58,109 --> 00:40:58,119
which has the same meaning which has a
 

2229
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:00,150
which has the same meaning which has a
slightly different argument structure

2230
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:00,160
slightly different argument structure
 

2231
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,510
slightly different argument structure
argument structure just a fancy word for

2232
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:02,520
argument structure just a fancy word for
 

2233
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,190
argument structure just a fancy word for
The Ordering of the words and so if I

2234
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:04,200
The Ordering of the words and so if I
 

2235
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,390
The Ordering of the words and so if I
say you it was um the the dogs two dogs

2236
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:08,400
say you it was um the the dogs two dogs
 

2237
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,270
say you it was um the the dogs two dogs
can or will enter the room the the

2238
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:11,280
can or will enter the room the the
 

2239
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,829
can or will enter the room the the
there's two forms of will one is Will

2240
00:41:14,829 --> 00:41:14,839
there's two forms of will one is Will
 

2241
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:17,030
there's two forms of will one is Will
declarative and and then okay I've got

2242
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:17,040
declarative and and then okay I've got
 

2243
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,670
declarative and and then okay I've got
my subject to the left it comes before

2244
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:18,680
my subject to the left it comes before
 

2245
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,349
my subject to the left it comes before
me and the verb comes after me in that

2246
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:21,359
me and the verb comes after me in that
 

2247
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,630
me and the verb comes after me in that
one and then the will interrogative it's

2248
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:23,640
one and then the will interrogative it's
 

2249
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,349
one and then the will interrogative it's
like oh I go first interrogative will is

2250
00:41:26,349 --> 00:41:26,359
like oh I go first interrogative will is
 

2251
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,069
like oh I go first interrogative will is
first and then have the subject

2252
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:28,079
first and then have the subject
 

2253
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,510
first and then have the subject
immediately after and then the verb

2254
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:29,520
immediately after and then the verb
 

2255
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,710
immediately after and then the verb
after that and so you just you can just

2256
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:31,720
after that and so you just you can just
 

2257
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,190
after that and so you just you can just
generate from one of those words another

2258
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:34,200
generate from one of those words another
 

2259
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,790
generate from one of those words another
word with a slightly different argument

2260
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:35,800
word with a slightly different argument
 

2261
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,829
word with a slightly different argument
structure with different ordering and

2262
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:37,839
structure with different ordering and
 

2263
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,390
structure with different ordering and
these are just lexical copies they

2264
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:40,400
these are just lexical copies they
 

2265
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,829
these are just lexical copies they
they're not necessarily moving from one

2266
00:41:41,829 --> 00:41:41,839
they're not necessarily moving from one
 

2267
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:43,109
they're not necessarily moving from one
to another there's no movement there's a

2268
00:41:43,109 --> 00:41:43,119
to another there's no movement there's a
 

2269
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,150
to another there's no movement there's a
romantic notion that you have like one

2270
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:46,160
romantic notion that you have like one
 

2271
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,790
romantic notion that you have like one
main way to use a word and then you

2272
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:48,800
main way to use a word and then you
 

2273
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,870
main way to use a word and then you
could move it around right right which

2274
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:50,880
could move it around right right which
 

2275
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,990
could move it around right right which
is essentially what movement is implying

2276
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:53,000
is essentially what movement is implying
 

2277
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,270
is essentially what movement is implying
yeah but that's that's the lexical

2278
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:54,280
yeah but that's that's the lexical
 

2279
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,390
yeah but that's that's the lexical
copying is similar so then so then then

2280
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:56,400
copying is similar so then so then then
 

2281
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,349
copying is similar so then so then then
we we do Lex copying for that same idea

2282
00:41:59,349 --> 00:41:59,359
we we do Lex copying for that same idea
 

2283
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,390
we we do Lex copying for that same idea
that maybe the declarative is the source

2284
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:01,400
that maybe the declarative is the source
 

2285
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,030
that maybe the declarative is the source
and then we can copy it and so an

2286
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:04,040
and then we can copy it and so an
 

2287
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,190
and then we can copy it and so an
advantage uh for there's multiple

2288
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:06,200
advantage uh for there's multiple
 

2289
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,030
advantage uh for there's multiple
advantages of the lexical copying story

2290
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:08,040
advantages of the lexical copying story
 

2291
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,270
advantages of the lexical copying story
it's not my story this is like um Ivan

2292
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:11,280
it's not my story this is like um Ivan
 

2293
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,990
it's not my story this is like um Ivan
SG linguists a bunch of linguists have

2294
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:13,000
SG linguists a bunch of linguists have
 

2295
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,190
SG linguists a bunch of linguists have
been proposing these stories as well you

2296
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:15,200
been proposing these stories as well you
 

2297
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,069
been proposing these stories as well you
know in tandem with the movement story

2298
00:42:17,069 --> 00:42:17,079
know in tandem with the movement story
 

2299
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:19,589
know in tandem with the movement story
okay you know he's he Ivan soag died a

2300
00:42:19,589 --> 00:42:19,599
okay you know he's he Ivan soag died a
 

2301
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:20,990
okay you know he's he Ivan soag died a
while ago but he was a one of the

2302
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:21,000
while ago but he was a one of the
 

2303
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,270
while ago but he was a one of the
proponents of the non-movement of the

2304
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:23,280
proponents of the non-movement of the
 

2305
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,230
proponents of the non-movement of the
lexical copying story and so that is

2306
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:25,240
lexical copying story and so that is
 

2307
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:29,790
lexical copying story and so that is
that um a great Advantage is well

2308
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:29,800
that um a great Advantage is well
 

2309
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,750
that um a great Advantage is well
Chomsky really famously in 1971 showed

2310
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:33,760
Chomsky really famously in 1971 showed
 

2311
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,390
Chomsky really famously in 1971 showed
that the movement story leads to

2312
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:36,400
that the movement story leads to
 

2313
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,790
that the movement story leads to
learnability problems it leads it leads

2314
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:38,800
learnability problems it leads it leads
 

2315
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,750
learnability problems it leads it leads
to problems for for how language is

00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:40,760
to problems for for how language is

to problems for for how language is
learned it's really really hard to

2318
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:42,640
learned it's really really hard to
 

2319
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,109
learned it's really really hard to
figure out what the underlying structure

2320
00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:45,119
figure out what the underlying structure
 

2321
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,829
figure out what the underlying structure

00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:48,950
of a language is if you have both phrase
structure and movement it's like really

2324
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:48,960
structure and movement it's like really
 

2325
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,390
structure and movement it's like really
hard to figure out what came from what

2326
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:51,400
hard to figure out what came from what
 

2327
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,069
hard to figure out what came from what
there's like a lot of possibilities

2328
00:42:53,069 --> 00:42:53,079
there's like a lot of possibilities
 

2329
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:54,950
there's like a lot of possibilities
there if you don't have that problem

2330
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:54,960
there if you don't have that problem
 

2331
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,390
there if you don't have that problem
learning that learning problem gets a

2332
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:56,400
learning that learning problem gets a
 

2333
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,230
learning that learning problem gets a
lot easier say there's lexical copies

2334
00:42:59,230 --> 00:42:59,240
lot easier say there's lexical copies
 

2335
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,990
lot easier say there's lexical copies
and when we say the learning problem do

2336
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:01,000
and when we say the learning problem do
 

2337
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,670
and when we say the learning problem do
you mean like humans learning a new

2338
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:02,680
you mean like humans learning a new
 

2339
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,990
you mean like humans learning a new
language yeah just learning English so

2340
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:04,000
language yeah just learning English so
 

2341
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,670
language yeah just learning English so
baby is lying around listening to the

2342
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:06,680
baby is lying around listening to the
 

2343
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,910
baby is lying around listening to the
crib listening to me talk and is you

2344
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:08,920
crib listening to me talk and is you
 

2345
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,990
crib listening to me talk and is you
know how are they learning English or or

2346
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:11,000
know how are they learning English or or
 

2347
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,390
know how are they learning English or or
you know maybe it's a 2-year-old who's

2348
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:12,400
you know maybe it's a 2-year-old who's
 

2349
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,109
you know maybe it's a 2-year-old who's
learning you know interrogatives and

2350
00:43:14,109 --> 00:43:14,119
learning you know interrogatives and
 

2351
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:15,710
learning you know interrogatives and
stuff or one you know there you how are

2352
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:15,720
stuff or one you know there you how are
 

2353
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,910
stuff or one you know there you how are
they doing that are they doing it from

2354
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:17,920
they doing that are they doing it from
 

2355
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,390
they doing that are they doing it from
like are they figuring out or like know

2356
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:20,400
like are they figuring out or like know
 

2357
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,870
like are they figuring out or like know
so Chomsky said it's impossible to

2358
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:21,880
so Chomsky said it's impossible to
 

2359
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,309
so Chomsky said it's impossible to
figure it out actually he said it's

2360
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:23,319
figure it out actually he said it's
 

2361
00:43:23,319 --> 00:43:26,430
figure it out actually he said it's
actually impossible not not hard but

2362
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:26,440
actually impossible not not hard but
 

2363
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,790
actually impossible not not hard but
impossible MH and therefore that's that

2364
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:28,800
impossible MH and therefore that's that
 

2365
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,150
impossible MH and therefore that's that
that's where Universal grammar comes

2366
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:30,160
that's where Universal grammar comes
 

2367
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,150
that's where Universal grammar comes
from is that it has to be built in and

2368
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:32,160
from is that it has to be built in and
 

2369
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,190
from is that it has to be built in and
so what they're learning is uh that

2370
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:35,200
so what they're learning is uh that
 

2371
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,950
so what they're learning is uh that
there there's some built-in movement is

2372
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:36,960
there there's some built-in movement is
 

2373
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,990
there there's some built-in movement is
built in in his story is absolutely part

2374
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:39,000
built in in his story is absolutely part
 

2375
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,069
built in in his story is absolutely part
of your language module and uh and then

2376
00:43:43,069 --> 00:43:43,079
of your language module and uh and then
 

2377
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:45,430
of your language module and uh and then
you are you're just setting parameters

2378
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:45,440
you are you're just setting parameters
 

2379
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,829
you are you're just setting parameters
you're you're said depending on English

2380
00:43:46,829 --> 00:43:46,839
you're you're said depending on English
 

2381
00:43:46,839 --> 00:43:48,390
you're you're said depending on English
is just sort of a variant of the

2382
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:48,400
is just sort of a variant of the
 

2383
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,349
is just sort of a variant of the
universal grammar and you're figuring

2384
00:43:50,349 --> 00:43:50,359
universal grammar and you're figuring
 

2385
00:43:50,359 --> 00:43:52,670
universal grammar and you're figuring
out oh which orders do does English do

2386
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:52,680
out oh which orders do does English do
 

2387
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,270
out oh which orders do does English do
these things that's the the non-movement

2388
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:55,280
these things that's the the non-movement
 

2389
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,790
these things that's the the non-movement
story doesn't have this it's like much

2390
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:56,800
story doesn't have this it's like much
 

2391
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,910
story doesn't have this it's like much
more

2392
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:57,920
more
 

2393
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,069
more
bottom up uh you're you're learning

2394
00:44:00,069 --> 00:44:00,079
bottom up uh you're you're learning
 

2395
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,470
bottom up uh you're you're learning
rules you're learning rules one by one

2396
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:02,480
rules you're learning rules one by one
 

2397
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,470
rules you're learning rules one by one
and oh there's this this word is

2398
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:04,480
and oh there's this this word is
 

2399
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,910
and oh there's this this word is
connected to that word a great advant

2400
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:06,920
connected to that word a great advant
 

2401
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,910
connected to that word a great advant
another Advantage it's learnable another

2402
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:08,920
another Advantage it's learnable another
 

2403
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,549
another Advantage it's learnable another
advantage of it is that it predicts that

2404
00:44:11,549 --> 00:44:11,559
advantage of it is that it predicts that
 

2405
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:13,990
advantage of it is that it predicts that
not all auxiliaries might move like it

2406
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:14,000
not all auxiliaries might move like it
 

2407
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,710
not all auxiliaries might move like it
it might depend on the word depending on

2408
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:15,720
it might depend on the word depending on
 

2409
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,430
it might depend on the word depending on
whether you and and and that turns out

2410
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:17,440
whether you and and and that turns out
 

2411
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,270
whether you and and and that turns out
to be true so there's words that um that

2412
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:21,280
to be true so there's words that um that
 

2413
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,630
to be true so there's words that um that
don't really work as auxiliary you they

2414
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:23,640
don't really work as auxiliary you they
 

2415
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,109
don't really work as auxiliary you they
work in declarative and not in in

2416
00:44:25,109 --> 00:44:25,119
work in declarative and not in in
 

2417
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:28,309
work in declarative and not in in
interrogative so I can say um I'll give

2418
00:44:28,309 --> 00:44:28,319
interrogative so I can say um I'll give
 

2419
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,030
interrogative so I can say um I'll give
you the opposite first if so I can say

2420
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:30,040
you the opposite first if so I can say
 

2421
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,870
you the opposite first if so I can say
aren't I invited to the party okay and

2422
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:32,880
aren't I invited to the party okay and
 

2423
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,390
aren't I invited to the party okay and
that's an that's an interrogative form

2424
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:35,400
that's an that's an interrogative form
 

2425
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,510
that's an that's an interrogative form
but it's not from I aren't invited to

2426
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:37,520
but it's not from I aren't invited to
 

2427
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,750
but it's not from I aren't invited to
the party there is no I aren't right so

2428
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:39,760
the party there is no I aren't right so
 

2429
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,549
the party there is no I aren't right so
that's that's interrogative only and and

2430
00:44:42,549 --> 00:44:42,559
that's that's interrogative only and and
 

2431
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:46,270
that's that's interrogative only and and
then we also have forms like um ought uh

2432
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:46,280
then we also have forms like um ought uh
 

2433
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:49,230
then we also have forms like um ought uh
I I ought to do this and and I guess

2434
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:49,240
I I ought to do this and and I guess
 

2435
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:52,030
I I ought to do this and and I guess
some British old British people can say

2436
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:52,040
some British old British people can say
 

2437
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,910
some British old British people can say
exactly it doesn't sound right does it

2438
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:53,920
exactly it doesn't sound right does it
 

2439
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,270
exactly it doesn't sound right does it
for me it sounds ridiculous I don't even

2440
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:56,280
for me it sounds ridiculous I don't even
 

2441
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,109
for me it sounds ridiculous I don't even
think a is great but I mean I totally

2442
00:44:58,109 --> 00:44:58,119
think a is great but I mean I totally
 

2443
00:44:58,119 --> 00:44:59,990
think a is great but I mean I totally
recognize I ought to I is not too bad

2444
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:00,000
recognize I ought to I is not too bad
 

2445
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,430
recognize I ought to I is not too bad
actually I can say I ought to do this

2446
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:01,440
actually I can say I ought to do this
 

2447
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,109
actually I can say I ought to do this
that sounds if I'm trying to sound

2448
00:45:03,109 --> 00:45:03,119
that sounds if I'm trying to sound
 

2449
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,109
that sounds if I'm trying to sound
sophisticated maybe I don't know it just

2450
00:45:05,109 --> 00:45:05,119
sophisticated maybe I don't know it just
 

2451
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,190
sophisticated maybe I don't know it just
sounds completely out to me I yeah

2452
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:08,200
sounds completely out to me I yeah
 

2453
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,430
sounds completely out to me I yeah
anyway it's so there are variance here

2454
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:10,440
anyway it's so there are variance here
 

2455
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,230
anyway it's so there are variance here
uh and a lot of these words just work in

2456
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:12,240
uh and a lot of these words just work in
 

2457
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,430
uh and a lot of these words just work in
one versus is the other and and that's

2458
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:14,440
one versus is the other and and that's
 

2459
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,309
one versus is the other and and that's
like fine under the lexical copying

2460
00:45:16,309 --> 00:45:16,319
like fine under the lexical copying
 

2461
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:18,230
like fine under the lexical copying
story it's like well you just learn the

2462
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:18,240
story it's like well you just learn the
 

2463
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,309
story it's like well you just learn the
usage whatever the usage is is what you

2464
00:45:21,309 --> 00:45:21,319
usage whatever the usage is is what you
 

2465
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:23,030
usage whatever the usage is is what you
is what you do with this with with this

2466
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:23,040
is what you do with this with with this
 

2467
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,430
is what you do with this with with this
word but um it doesn't it's a little bit

2468
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:25,440
word but um it doesn't it's a little bit
 

2469
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,670
word but um it doesn't it's a little bit
harder in the movement story The

2470
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:26,680
harder in the movement story The
 

2471
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,589
harder in the movement story The
Movement story like that's an advantage

2472
00:45:28,589 --> 00:45:28,599
Movement story like that's an advantage
 

2473
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:30,549
Movement story like that's an advantage
I think of lexical copying in all these

2474
00:45:30,549 --> 00:45:30,559
I think of lexical copying in all these
 

2475
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:32,349
I think of lexical copying in all these
different places there's there's all

2476
00:45:32,349 --> 00:45:32,359
different places there's there's all
 

2477
00:45:32,359 --> 00:45:35,430
different places there's there's all
these usage variants which make the

2478
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:35,440
these usage variants which make the
 

2479
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,470
these usage variants which make the
movement story um a little bit harder to

2480
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:39,480
movement story um a little bit harder to
 

2481
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,990
movement story um a little bit harder to
work so one of the main divisions here

2482
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:41,000
work so one of the main divisions here
 

2483
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,750
work so one of the main divisions here
is the movement Story versus the C story

2484
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:43,760
is the movement Story versus the C story
 

2485
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,270
is the movement Story versus the C story
that has to do about the auxiliary warts

2486
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:45,280
that has to do about the auxiliary warts
 

2487
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,549
that has to do about the auxiliary warts
and so on but you if rewind to the

2488
00:45:48,549 --> 00:45:48,559
and so on but you if rewind to the
 

2489
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:51,349
and so on but you if rewind to the
phrase structured grammar yeah versus

2490
00:45:51,349 --> 00:45:51,359
phrase structured grammar yeah versus
 

2491
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,309
phrase structured grammar yeah versus
dependency grammar those are equivalent

2492
00:45:53,309 --> 00:45:53,319
dependency grammar those are equivalent
 

2493
00:45:53,319 --> 00:45:56,270
dependency grammar those are equivalent
in some sense in that for any dependency

2494
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:56,280
in some sense in that for any dependency
 

2495
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,549
in some sense in that for any dependency
grammar I can generate a dependence a

2496
00:45:58,549 --> 00:45:58,559
grammar I can generate a dependence a
 

2497
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:00,030
grammar I can generate a dependence a
phrase structure grammar which generates

2498
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:00,040
phrase structure grammar which generates
 

2499
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,309
phrase structure grammar which generates
exactly the same sentences I just I just

2500
00:46:02,309 --> 00:46:02,319
exactly the same sentences I just I just
 

2501
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:06,549
exactly the same sentences I just I just
like the dependency grammar uh formalism

2502
00:46:06,549 --> 00:46:06,559
like the dependency grammar uh formalism
 

2503
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:08,069
like the dependency grammar uh formalism
because it makes something really

2504
00:46:08,069 --> 00:46:08,079
because it makes something really
 

2505
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:10,670
because it makes something really
Salient which is the depend the the

2506
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:10,680
Salient which is the depend the the
 

2507
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,790
Salient which is the depend the the
lengths of dependencies between Words

2508
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:12,800
lengths of dependencies between Words
 

2509
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,190
lengths of dependencies between Words
which isn't so obvious in in the phrase

2510
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:15,200
which isn't so obvious in in the phrase
 

2511
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,390
which isn't so obvious in in the phrase
in the phrase structure it's just kind

2512
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:16,400
in the phrase structure it's just kind
 

2513
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,030
in the phrase structure it's just kind
of hard to see it's in there it's just

2514
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:19,040
of hard to see it's in there it's just
 

2515
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,910
of hard to see it's in there it's just
very very it's opaque uh technically I

2516
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:21,920
very very it's opaque uh technically I
 

2517
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,390
very very it's opaque uh technically I
think phrase structure grammar is

2518
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:23,400
think phrase structure grammar is
 

2519
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,349
think phrase structure grammar is
mappable to dependency grammar and vice

2520
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:25,359
mappable to dependency grammar and vice
 

2521
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:27,349
mappable to dependency grammar and vice
versa and vice versa yeah there's like

2522
00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:27,359
versa and vice versa yeah there's like
 

2523
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:30,630
versa and vice versa yeah there's like
these like little labels SN PVP yeah for

2524
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:30,640
these like little labels SN PVP yeah for
 

2525
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,349
these like little labels SN PVP yeah for
a particular dependency grammar you can

2526
00:46:32,349 --> 00:46:32,359
a particular dependency grammar you can
 

2527
00:46:32,359 --> 00:46:34,270
a particular dependency grammar you can
make a phrase structure grammar which

2528
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:34,280
make a phrase structure grammar which
 

2529
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,790
make a phrase structure grammar which
generates exactly those same sentences

2530
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:36,800
generates exactly those same sentences
 

2531
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,950
generates exactly those same sentences
and vice versa but there are many phrase

2532
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:38,960
and vice versa but there are many phrase
 

2533
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,349
and vice versa but there are many phrase
structure grammars which you can't

2534
00:46:40,349 --> 00:46:40,359
structure grammars which you can't
 

2535
00:46:40,359 --> 00:46:42,910
structure grammars which you can't
really make a dependency grammar I mean

2536
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:42,920
really make a dependency grammar I mean
 

2537
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,390
really make a dependency grammar I mean
there you can do a lot more in a phrase

2538
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:44,400
there you can do a lot more in a phrase
 

2539
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,630
there you can do a lot more in a phrase
structure grammar you get many more of

2540
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:46,640
structure grammar you get many more of
 

2541
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,950
structure grammar you get many more of
these extra nodes basically you you can

2542
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:48,960
these extra nodes basically you you can
 

2543
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,309
these extra nodes basically you you can
have more structure in there uh and and

2544
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:51,319
have more structure in there uh and and
 

2545
00:46:51,319 --> 00:46:52,710
have more structure in there uh and and
some people like that and and maybe

2546
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:52,720
some people like that and and maybe
 

2547
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,030
some people like that and and maybe
there's value to that I I I don't like

2548
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:55,040
there's value to that I I I don't like
 

2549
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,870
there's value to that I I I don't like
it well for you so we should clarify so

2550
00:46:57,870 --> 00:46:57,880
it well for you so we should clarify so
 

2551
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,549
it well for you so we should clarify so
so dependency grammar it's just uh well

2552
00:47:00,549 --> 00:47:00,559
so dependency grammar it's just uh well
 

2553
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:02,670
so dependency grammar it's just uh well
one word depends on only one other word

2554
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:02,680
one word depends on only one other word
 

2555
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:06,150
one word depends on only one other word
and you form these trees and that makes

2556
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:06,160
and you form these trees and that makes
 

2557
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,309
and you form these trees and that makes
it really puts priority on those

2558
00:47:08,309 --> 00:47:08,319
it really puts priority on those
 

2559
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,910
it really puts priority on those
dependencies just like as a as a tree

2560
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:10,920
dependencies just like as a as a tree
 

2561
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,630
dependencies just like as a as a tree
that you can then measure the distance

2562
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:12,640
that you can then measure the distance
 

2563
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,510
that you can then measure the distance
of the dependency from one word to the

2564
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:14,520
of the dependency from one word to the
 

2565
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:17,230
of the dependency from one word to the
other they can then map to uh the

2566
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:17,240
other they can then map to uh the
 

2567
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:20,190
other they can then map to uh the
cognitive processing of the of these

2568
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:20,200
cognitive processing of the of these
 

2569
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,270
cognitive processing of the of these
sentences how well how easy it is to

2570
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:22,280
sentences how well how easy it is to
 

2571
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,710
sentences how well how easy it is to
understand and all that kind of stuff so

2572
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:23,720
understand and all that kind of stuff so
 

2573
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,270
understand and all that kind of stuff so
it just puts the focus on just like the

2574
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:26,280
it just puts the focus on just like the
 

2575
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,270
it just puts the focus on just like the
mathematical

2576
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:28,280
mathematical
 

2577
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:31,309
mathematical
um uh distance of dependence between

2578
00:47:31,309 --> 00:47:31,319
um uh distance of dependence between
 

2579
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:33,430
um uh distance of dependence between
words so like it's just a different

2580
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:33,440
words so like it's just a different
 

2581
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,109
words so like it's just a different
Focus absolutely Ju Just continue on a

2582
00:47:36,109 --> 00:47:36,119
Focus absolutely Ju Just continue on a
 

2583
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:37,430
Focus absolutely Ju Just continue on a
thread of chsky because it's really

2584
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:37,440
thread of chsky because it's really
 

2585
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,750
thread of chsky because it's really
interesting because it as you're

2586
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:39,760
interesting because it as you're
 

2587
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,030
interesting because it as you're
discussing

2588
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:41,040
discussing
 

2589
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,870
discussing
disagreement to the degree there's

2590
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:42,880
disagreement to the degree there's
 

2591
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,150
disagreement to the degree there's
disagreement you're also telling the

2592
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:44,160
disagreement you're also telling the
 

2593
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,750
disagreement you're also telling the
history of the study of language which

2594
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:45,760
history of the study of language which
 

2595
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,790
history of the study of language which
is really awesome so you mention context

2596
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:48,800
is really awesome so you mention context
 

2597
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,270
is really awesome so you mention context
free versus regular does that

2598
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:51,280
free versus regular does that
 

2599
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,790
free versus regular does that
distinction come into play for the peny

2600
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:53,800
distinction come into play for the peny
 

2601
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,430
distinction come into play for the peny
grammar no okay not at all I mean the

2602
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:56,440
grammar no okay not at all I mean the
 

2603
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,549
grammar no okay not at all I mean the
regular regular languages are too simple

2604
00:47:59,549 --> 00:47:59,559
regular regular languages are too simple
 

2605
00:47:59,559 --> 00:48:02,069
regular regular languages are too simple
for human languages they they are uh

2606
00:48:02,069 --> 00:48:02,079
for human languages they they are uh
 

2607
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,390
for human languages they they are uh
they it's a part of the hierarchy but

2608
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:04,400
they it's a part of the hierarchy but
 

2609
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,670
they it's a part of the hierarchy but
human languages are in in the phrase

2610
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:06,680
human languages are in in the phrase
 

2611
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,990
human languages are in in the phrase
structure world are definite they

2612
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:09,000
structure world are definite they
 

2613
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,790
structure world are definite they
they're at least context free maybe a

2614
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:11,800
they're at least context free maybe a
 

2615
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,230
they're at least context free maybe a
little bit more a little bit harder than

2616
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:14,240
little bit more a little bit harder than
 

2617
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,870
little bit more a little bit harder than
that but uh so there's something called

2618
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:15,880
that but uh so there's something called
 

2619
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,349
that but uh so there's something called
context sensitive as well where you can

2620
00:48:18,349 --> 00:48:18,359
context sensitive as well where you can
 

2621
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:20,230
context sensitive as well where you can
have like this is the just the formal

2622
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:20,240
have like this is the just the formal
 

2623
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,390
have like this is the just the formal
language description in in a context

2624
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:23,400
language description in in a context
 

2625
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,870
language description in in a context
free grammar you have one this is like a

2626
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:26,880
free grammar you have one this is like a
 

2627
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,150
free grammar you have one this is like a
bunch of like formal language Theory

2628
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:28,160
bunch of like formal language Theory
 

2629
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,230
bunch of like formal language Theory
we're doing here but I love it okay so

2630
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:30,240
we're doing here but I love it okay so
 

2631
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,710
we're doing here but I love it okay so
you have you have a left- hand side

2632
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:31,720
you have you have a left- hand side
 

2633
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,069
you have you have a left- hand side
category and you're expanding to

2634
00:48:33,069 --> 00:48:33,079
category and you're expanding to
 

2635
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:35,630
category and you're expanding to
anything on the right is is a uh that's

2636
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:35,640
anything on the right is is a uh that's
 

2637
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,309
anything on the right is is a uh that's
a context free so like the idea is that

2638
00:48:37,309 --> 00:48:37,319
a context free so like the idea is that
 

2639
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:39,390
a context free so like the idea is that
that category on the left expands in

2640
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:39,400
that category on the left expands in
 

2641
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,349
that category on the left expands in
independent of context to those things

2642
00:48:41,349 --> 00:48:41,359
independent of context to those things
 

2643
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:42,510
independent of context to those things
whatever they are on the right doesn't

2644
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:42,520
whatever they are on the right doesn't
 

2645
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:46,150
whatever they are on the right doesn't
matter what and and a context sensitive

2646
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:46,160
matter what and and a context sensitive
 

2647
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,030
matter what and and a context sensitive
says Okay I I actually have more than

2648
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:49,040
says Okay I I actually have more than
 

2649
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,750
says Okay I I actually have more than
one thing on the left I can tell you

2650
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:50,760
one thing on the left I can tell you
 

2651
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,789
one thing on the left I can tell you
only in this context you know I maybe

2652
00:48:52,789 --> 00:48:52,799
only in this context you know I maybe
 

2653
00:48:52,799 --> 00:48:54,430
only in this context you know I maybe
have like a left and a right context or

2654
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:54,440
have like a left and a right context or
 

2655
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,990
have like a left and a right context or
just a left context or a right context I

2656
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:56,000
just a left context or a right context I
 

2657
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,470
just a left context or a right context I
have two or more stuff on the left tells

2658
00:48:58,470 --> 00:48:58,480
have two or more stuff on the left tells
 

2659
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,630
have two or more stuff on the left tells
you how to expand that th those things

2660
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:00,640
you how to expand that th those things
 

2661
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,950
you how to expand that th those things
in that way okay so it's Contex

2662
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:01,960
in that way okay so it's Contex
 

2663
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:05,150
in that way okay so it's Contex
sensitive a a regular language is just

2664
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:05,160
sensitive a a regular language is just
 

2665
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,829
sensitive a a regular language is just
more constrained and so it it doesn't

2666
00:49:07,829 --> 00:49:07,839
more constrained and so it it doesn't
 

2667
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,030
more constrained and so it it doesn't
allow anything on the right it it allows

2668
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:10,040
allow anything on the right it it allows
 

2669
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,870
allow anything on the right it it allows
very it allow basically it's a one very

2670
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:12,880
very it allow basically it's a one very
 

2671
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,069
very it allow basically it's a one very
complicated rule is kind of what a a a

2672
00:49:16,069 --> 00:49:16,079
complicated rule is kind of what a a a
 

2673
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:17,750
complicated rule is kind of what a a a
regular language is and so it doesn't

2674
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:17,760
regular language is and so it doesn't
 

2675
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,109
regular language is and so it doesn't
have any um it say long distance

2676
00:49:21,109 --> 00:49:21,119
have any um it say long distance
 

2677
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,750
have any um it say long distance
depencies it doesn't allow recursion for

2678
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:23,760
depencies it doesn't allow recursion for
 

2679
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,349
depencies it doesn't allow recursion for
instance there's no recursion yeah

2680
00:49:25,349 --> 00:49:25,359
instance there's no recursion yeah
 

2681
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,109
instance there's no recursion yeah
recursion is where you which human

2682
00:49:27,109 --> 00:49:27,119
recursion is where you which human
 

2683
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,270
recursion is where you which human
languages have recursion they have

2684
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:28,280
languages have recursion they have
 

2685
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,630
languages have recursion they have
embedding and you can't well it doesn't

2686
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:30,640
embedding and you can't well it doesn't
 

2687
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,309
embedding and you can't well it doesn't
allow Center embedded recursion which

2688
00:49:32,309 --> 00:49:32,319
allow Center embedded recursion which
 

2689
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:34,190
allow Center embedded recursion which
human languages have which is what

2690
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:34,200
human languages have which is what
 

2691
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,150
human languages have which is what
Center embedded recursion within a

2692
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:36,160
Center embedded recursion within a
 

2693
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,630
Center embedded recursion within a
sentence within a sentence yeah within a

2694
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:37,640
sentence within a sentence yeah within a
 

2695
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,750
sentence within a sentence yeah within a
sentence so here we're going to get to

2696
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:38,760
sentence so here we're going to get to
 

2697
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,549
sentence so here we're going to get to
that but I you know the formal language

2698
00:49:40,549 --> 00:49:40,559
that but I you know the formal language
 

2699
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:42,670
that but I you know the formal language
stuff is a little aside Chomsky wasn't

2700
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:42,680
stuff is a little aside Chomsky wasn't
 

2701
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,510
stuff is a little aside Chomsky wasn't
proposing it for human languages even he

2702
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:44,520
proposing it for human languages even he
 

2703
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,349
proposing it for human languages even he
was just pointing out that human

2704
00:49:46,349 --> 00:49:46,359
was just pointing out that human
 

2705
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:48,349
was just pointing out that human
languages are context free and then he

2706
00:49:48,349 --> 00:49:48,359
languages are context free and then he
 

2707
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:50,150
languages are context free and then he
was most in for for human because that

2708
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:50,160
was most in for for human because that
 

2709
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,549
was most in for for human because that
was kind of stuff we did for formal

2710
00:49:51,549 --> 00:49:51,559
was kind of stuff we did for formal
 

2711
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:53,030
was kind of stuff we did for formal
languages and what he was most

2712
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:53,040
languages and what he was most
 

2713
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,990
languages and what he was most
interested in was human language and

2714
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:56,000
interested in was human language and
 

2715
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,309
interested in was human language and
that's like the the movement is where we

2716
00:49:58,309 --> 00:49:58,319
that's like the the movement is where we
 

2717
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:01,030
that's like the the movement is where we
we we where where he sort of set off in

2718
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:01,040
we we where where he sort of set off in
 

2719
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,069
we we where where he sort of set off in
on I would say a very interesting but

2720
00:50:04,069 --> 00:50:04,079
on I would say a very interesting but
 

2721
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:05,630
on I would say a very interesting but
wrong foot it was kind of interesting

2722
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:05,640
wrong foot it was kind of interesting
 

2723
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,150
wrong foot it was kind of interesting
it's a very I agree it's a very

2724
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:07,160
it's a very I agree it's a very
 

2725
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,870
it's a very I agree it's a very
interesting history so there's this so

2726
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:08,880
interesting history so there's this so
 

2727
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,870
interesting history so there's this so
he proposed this multiple theories in 57

2728
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:11,880
he proposed this multiple theories in 57
 

2729
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,829
he proposed this multiple theories in 57
and then' 65 they're they all have this

2730
00:50:13,829 --> 00:50:13,839
and then' 65 they're they all have this
 

2731
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:15,549
and then' 65 they're they all have this
framework though was phrase structure

2732
00:50:15,549 --> 00:50:15,559
framework though was phrase structure
 

2733
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:17,630
framework though was phrase structure
plus movement different versions of the

2734
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:17,640
plus movement different versions of the
 

2735
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,829
plus movement different versions of the
of the phrase structure and the movement

2736
00:50:18,829 --> 00:50:18,839
of the phrase structure and the movement
 

2737
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:20,750
of the phrase structure and the movement
in the 57 these are the most famous

2738
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:20,760
in the 57 these are the most famous
 

2739
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,589
in the 57 these are the most famous
original bits of chomsky's work and then

2740
00:50:22,589 --> 00:50:22,599
original bits of chomsky's work and then
 

2741
00:50:22,599 --> 00:50:24,549
original bits of chomsky's work and then
in 71 is when he figured out that those

2742
00:50:24,549 --> 00:50:24,559
in 71 is when he figured out that those
 

2743
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,710
in 71 is when he figured out that those
lead to learning problems that that

2744
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:26,720
lead to learning problems that that
 

2745
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,670
lead to learning problems that that
there's cases where a kid could never

2746
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:29,680
there's cases where a kid could never
 

2747
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:33,190
there's cases where a kid could never
figure out which rule um which set of

2748
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:33,200
figure out which rule um which set of
 

2749
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,750
figure out which rule um which set of
rules was intended and and so and then

2750
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:35,760
rules was intended and and so and then
 

2751
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,670
rules was intended and and so and then
he said well that means it's innate it's

2752
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:37,680
he said well that means it's innate it's
 

2753
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,750
he said well that means it's innate it's
kind of interesting he just really

2754
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:38,760
kind of interesting he just really
 

2755
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,230
kind of interesting he just really
thought the movement was just so

2756
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:40,240
thought the movement was just so
 

2757
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,030
thought the movement was just so
obviously true that he couldn't he

2758
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:43,040
obviously true that he couldn't he
 

2759
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,190
obviously true that he couldn't he
didn't even entertain giving it up it's

2760
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:45,200
didn't even entertain giving it up it's
 

2761
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,190
didn't even entertain giving it up it's
just obvious that's obviously right and

2762
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:48,200
just obvious that's obviously right and
 

2763
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,030
just obvious that's obviously right and
um it was later where people figured out

2764
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:50,040
um it was later where people figured out
 

2765
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,829
um it was later where people figured out
that there's all these like subtle ways

2766
00:50:52,829 --> 00:50:52,839
that there's all these like subtle ways
 

2767
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:54,750
that there's all these like subtle ways
in which things which which look like

2768
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:54,760
in which things which which look like
 

2769
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,430
in which things which which look like
generalizations aren't generalizations

2770
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:56,440
generalizations aren't generalizations
 

2771
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,670
generalizations aren't generalizations
and they you across the category they're

2772
00:50:58,670 --> 00:50:58,680
and they you across the category they're
 

2773
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,870
and they you across the category they're
they're word specific and and they have

2774
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:00,880
they're word specific and and they have
 

2775
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,109
they're word specific and and they have
and they they kind of work but they

2776
00:51:02,109 --> 00:51:02,119
and they they kind of work but they
 

2777
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:03,789
and they they kind of work but they
don't work across various other words in

2778
00:51:03,789 --> 00:51:03,799
don't work across various other words in
 

2779
00:51:03,799 --> 00:51:05,309
don't work across various other words in
the category and so it's easier to just

2780
00:51:05,309 --> 00:51:05,319
the category and so it's easier to just
 

2781
00:51:05,319 --> 00:51:07,549
the category and so it's easier to just
think of these things as lexical copies

2782
00:51:07,549 --> 00:51:07,559
think of these things as lexical copies
 

2783
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:10,069
think of these things as lexical copies
and and I think he was very obsessed I

2784
00:51:10,069 --> 00:51:10,079
and and I think he was very obsessed I
 

2785
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:12,470
and and I think he was very obsessed I
don't know I'm like guessing that he he

2786
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:12,480
don't know I'm like guessing that he he
 

2787
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,430
don't know I'm like guessing that he he
just he really wanted this story to be

2788
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:14,440
just he really wanted this story to be
 

2789
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,430
just he really wanted this story to be
simple in some sense and language is a

2790
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:16,440
simple in some sense and language is a
 

2791
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,470
simple in some sense and language is a
little more complicated in some sense

2792
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:18,480
little more complicated in some sense
 

2793
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,910
little more complicated in some sense
you know he didn't like Words uh he

2794
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:20,920
you know he didn't like Words uh he
 

2795
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,270
you know he didn't like Words uh he
never talks about words he likes to talk

2796
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:22,280
never talks about words he likes to talk
 

2797
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,829
never talks about words he likes to talk
about combinations of words and words

2798
00:51:23,829 --> 00:51:23,839
about combinations of words and words
 

2799
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:25,990
about combinations of words and words
are you know look up a dictionary

2800
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:26,000
are you know look up a dictionary
 

2801
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,630
are you know look up a dictionary
there's 50 senses for a common word

2802
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:28,640
there's 50 senses for a common word
 

2803
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,750
there's 50 senses for a common word
right the word take will have 30 or 40

2804
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:30,760
right the word take will have 30 or 40
 

2805
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:33,309
right the word take will have 30 or 40
senses in it so uh there'll be many

2806
00:51:33,309 --> 00:51:33,319
senses in it so uh there'll be many
 

2807
00:51:33,319 --> 00:51:35,549
senses in it so uh there'll be many
different senses for common words and he

2808
00:51:35,549 --> 00:51:35,559
different senses for common words and he
 

2809
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:37,829
different senses for common words and he
just doesn't think about that it's or

2810
00:51:37,829 --> 00:51:37,839
just doesn't think about that it's or
 

2811
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:40,230
just doesn't think about that it's or
doesn't think that's language I think he

2812
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:40,240
doesn't think that's language I think he
 

2813
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,789
doesn't think that's language I think he
doesn't think that's language he thinks

2814
00:51:41,789 --> 00:51:41,799
doesn't think that's language he thinks
 

2815
00:51:41,799 --> 00:51:45,150
doesn't think that's language he thinks
that words are distinct from

2816
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:45,160
that words are distinct from
 

2817
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,549
that words are distinct from
combinations of words I think they're

2818
00:51:46,549 --> 00:51:46,559
combinations of words I think they're
 

2819
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:49,950
combinations of words I think they're
the same if you look at my brain in the

2820
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:49,960
the same if you look at my brain in the
 

2821
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:52,589
the same if you look at my brain in the
scanner while I'm listening to a

2822
00:51:52,589 --> 00:51:52,599
scanner while I'm listening to a
 

2823
00:51:52,599 --> 00:51:55,390
scanner while I'm listening to a
language I understand and you compare I

2824
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:55,400
language I understand and you compare I
 

2825
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,670
language I understand and you compare I
can localize my language Network in a

2826
00:51:57,670 --> 00:51:57,680
can localize my language Network in a
 

2827
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,430
can localize my language Network in a
few minutes in like 15 minutes and what

2828
00:51:59,430 --> 00:51:59,440
few minutes in like 15 minutes and what
 

2829
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,870
few minutes in like 15 minutes and what
you do is I listen to a language I know

2830
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:00,880
you do is I listen to a language I know
 

2831
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,390
you do is I listen to a language I know
I listen to you know maybe some language

2832
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:03,400
I listen to you know maybe some language
 

2833
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,309
I listen to you know maybe some language
I don't know or I listen to muffled

2834
00:52:05,309 --> 00:52:05,319
I don't know or I listen to muffled
 

2835
00:52:05,319 --> 00:52:08,270
I don't know or I listen to muffled
speech or I I read sentences and I read

2836
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:08,280
speech or I I read sentences and I read
 

2837
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,069
speech or I I read sentences and I read
non-words like I do anything like this

2838
00:52:10,069 --> 00:52:10,079
non-words like I do anything like this
 

2839
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:11,190
non-words like I do anything like this
anything that's sort of really like

2840
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:11,200
anything that's sort of really like
 

2841
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,750
anything that's sort of really like
English and anything that's not very

2842
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:12,760
English and anything that's not very
 

2843
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,390
English and anything that's not very
like English so I've got to something

2844
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:14,400
like English so I've got to something
 

2845
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,470
like English so I've got to something
like it and not and I got a control and

2846
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:16,480
like it and not and I got a control and
 

2847
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,950
like it and not and I got a control and
and the voxel which is just you know the

2848
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:18,960
and the voxel which is just you know the
 

2849
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,270
and the voxel which is just you know the
um 3D pixels in my in my brain that are

2850
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:22,280
um 3D pixels in my in my brain that are
 

2851
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:25,190
um 3D pixels in my in my brain that are
responding most are are is a language

2852
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:25,200
responding most are are is a language
 

2853
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,549
responding most are are is a language
area and and that's this left

2854
00:52:27,549 --> 00:52:27,559
area and and that's this left
 

2855
00:52:27,559 --> 00:52:31,390
area and and that's this left
lateralized um area in my head and and

2856
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:31,400
lateralized um area in my head and and
 

2857
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,710
lateralized um area in my head and and
wherever I look in that network if you

2858
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:33,720
wherever I look in that network if you
 

2859
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,630
wherever I look in that network if you
look for the combinations versus the

2860
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:35,640
look for the combinations versus the
 

2861
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,109
look for the combinations versus the
words it's there it's it's everywhere

2862
00:52:38,109 --> 00:52:38,119
words it's there it's it's everywhere
 

2863
00:52:38,119 --> 00:52:39,990
words it's there it's it's everywhere
it's the same that's fascinating and so

2864
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:40,000
it's the same that's fascinating and so
 

2865
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,910
it's the same that's fascinating and so
it's like hard to find there are no

2866
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:41,920
it's like hard to find there are no
 

2867
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,309
it's like hard to find there are no
areas that we know I mean

2868
00:52:44,309 --> 00:52:44,319
areas that we know I mean
 

2869
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:46,230
areas that we know I mean
that's it's a little overstated right

2870
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:46,240
that's it's a little overstated right
 

2871
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,030
that's it's a little overstated right
now at this at this point the the

2872
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:48,040
now at this at this point the the
 

2873
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,470
now at this at this point the the
technology isn't great it's not bad but

2874
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:50,480
technology isn't great it's not bad but
 

2875
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,309
technology isn't great it's not bad but
we have the best the best way to figure

2876
00:52:52,309 --> 00:52:52,319
we have the best the best way to figure
 

2877
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:54,150
we have the best the best way to figure
out what's going on in my brain when I'm

2878
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:54,160
out what's going on in my brain when I'm
 

2879
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,030
out what's going on in my brain when I'm
listening or reading language is to use

2880
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:56,040
listening or reading language is to use
 

2881
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,150
listening or reading language is to use
FM R functional magnetic resonance

2882
00:52:58,150 --> 00:52:58,160
FM R functional magnetic resonance
 

2883
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,670
FM R functional magnetic resonance
imaging and that's a very good

2884
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:00,680
imaging and that's a very good
 

2885
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,870
imaging and that's a very good
localization method so I can figure out

2886
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:02,880
localization method so I can figure out
 

2887
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,549
localization method so I can figure out
where exactly these signals are coming

2888
00:53:04,549 --> 00:53:04,559
where exactly these signals are coming
 

2889
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:06,950
where exactly these signals are coming
from pretty you know down to you know

2890
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:06,960
from pretty you know down to you know
 

2891
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,470
from pretty you know down to you know
millimeters you know cubic millimeters

2892
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:08,480
millimeters you know cubic millimeters
 

2893
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,109
millimeters you know cubic millimeters
or smaller okay very small we can figure

2894
00:53:10,109 --> 00:53:10,119
or smaller okay very small we can figure
 

2895
00:53:10,119 --> 00:53:11,789
or smaller okay very small we can figure
those out very well the problem is the

2896
00:53:11,789 --> 00:53:11,799
those out very well the problem is the
 

2897
00:53:11,799 --> 00:53:15,309
those out very well the problem is the
when okay uh it's it's measuring um

2898
00:53:15,309 --> 00:53:15,319
when okay uh it's it's measuring um
 

2899
00:53:15,319 --> 00:53:17,829
when okay uh it's it's measuring um
oxygen okay and oxygen takes a little

2900
00:53:17,829 --> 00:53:17,839
oxygen okay and oxygen takes a little
 

2901
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:20,109
oxygen okay and oxygen takes a little
while to get to those cells so it takes

2902
00:53:20,109 --> 00:53:20,119
while to get to those cells so it takes
 

2903
00:53:20,119 --> 00:53:23,150
while to get to those cells so it takes
on the order of seconds so I talk fast I

2904
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:23,160
on the order of seconds so I talk fast I
 

2905
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,549
on the order of seconds so I talk fast I
I probably listen fast and I can

2906
00:53:24,549 --> 00:53:24,559
I probably listen fast and I can
 

2907
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:25,789
I probably listen fast and I can
probably understand things really fast

2908
00:53:25,789 --> 00:53:25,799
probably understand things really fast
 

2909
00:53:25,799 --> 00:53:27,990
probably understand things really fast
so a lot of stuff happens in two seconds

2910
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:28,000
so a lot of stuff happens in two seconds
 

2911
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,470
so a lot of stuff happens in two seconds
and so to say that we know what's going

2912
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:30,480
and so to say that we know what's going
 

2913
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,950
and so to say that we know what's going
on that the words right now in that

2914
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:33,960
on that the words right now in that
 

2915
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,270
on that the words right now in that
Network our best guess is that whole

2916
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:36,280
Network our best guess is that whole
 

2917
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,230
Network our best guess is that whole
network is doing something similar but

2918
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:38,240
network is doing something similar but
 

2919
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,910
network is doing something similar but
maybe different parts of that Network

2920
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:40,920
maybe different parts of that Network
 

2921
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,789
maybe different parts of that Network
are doing different things and and

2922
00:53:42,789 --> 00:53:42,799
are doing different things and and
 

2923
00:53:42,799 --> 00:53:44,309
are doing different things and and
that's probably the case we just don't

2924
00:53:44,309 --> 00:53:44,319
that's probably the case we just don't
 

2925
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,430
that's probably the case we just don't
have very good methods to figure that

2926
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:46,440
have very good methods to figure that
 

2927
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,309
have very good methods to figure that
out right at this moment and so since

2928
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:49,319
out right at this moment and so since
 

2929
00:53:49,319 --> 00:53:51,750
out right at this moment and so since
we're kind of talking about the history

2930
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:51,760
we're kind of talking about the history
 

2931
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,549
we're kind of talking about the history
of the study of language what other

2932
00:53:54,549 --> 00:53:54,559
of the study of language what other
 

2933
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,910
of the study of language what other
interesting disagreements and you're

2934
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:55,920
interesting disagreements and you're
 

2935
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,030
interesting disagreements and you're
both at it or were for a long time what

2936
00:53:59,030 --> 00:53:59,040
both at it or were for a long time what
 

2937
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,670
both at it or were for a long time what
kind of interesting disagreements there

2938
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:00,680
kind of interesting disagreements there
 

2939
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,150
kind of interesting disagreements there
tension of ideas are there between you

2940
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:03,160
tension of ideas are there between you
 

2941
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,710
tension of ideas are there between you
and no chowski and we should say that

2942
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:04,720
and no chowski and we should say that
 

2943
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,990
and no chowski and we should say that
gnome was in the Linguistics department

2944
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:08,000
gnome was in the Linguistics department
 

2945
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:08,789
gnome was in the Linguistics department
and

2946
00:54:08,789 --> 00:54:08,799
and
 

2947
00:54:08,799 --> 00:54:10,829
and
you're uh I guess for a time we

2948
00:54:10,829 --> 00:54:10,839
you're uh I guess for a time we
 

2949
00:54:10,839 --> 00:54:13,190
you're uh I guess for a time we
Affiliated there but primarily a brain

2950
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:13,200
Affiliated there but primarily a brain
 

2951
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,990
Affiliated there but primarily a brain
and cognitive science department it's

2952
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:16,000
and cognitive science department it's
 

2953
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,549
and cognitive science department it's
just another way of studying language

2954
00:54:17,549 --> 00:54:17,559
just another way of studying language
 

2955
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:19,950
just another way of studying language
and you've been talking about fmri so

2956
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:19,960
and you've been talking about fmri so
 

2957
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,829
and you've been talking about fmri so
like what is there something else

2958
00:54:22,829 --> 00:54:22,839
like what is there something else
 

2959
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:24,789
like what is there something else
interesting to bring to the surface

2960
00:54:24,789 --> 00:54:24,799
interesting to bring to the surface
 

2961
00:54:24,799 --> 00:54:26,470
interesting to bring to the surface
about the disagreement between the two

2962
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:26,480
about the disagreement between the two
 

2963
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,549
about the disagreement between the two
you or other people in the this yeah I I

2964
00:54:29,549 --> 00:54:29,559
you or other people in the this yeah I I
 

2965
00:54:29,559 --> 00:54:32,829
you or other people in the this yeah I I
mean I've been at MIT for 31 years since

2966
00:54:32,829 --> 00:54:32,839
mean I've been at MIT for 31 years since
 

2967
00:54:32,839 --> 00:54:35,750
mean I've been at MIT for 31 years since
1993 and he chomsky's been there much

2968
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:35,760
1993 and he chomsky's been there much
 

2969
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,950
1993 and he chomsky's been there much
longer so I I met him I knew him I I met

2970
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:39,960
longer so I I met him I knew him I I met
 

2971
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,829
longer so I I met him I knew him I I met
when I first got there I guess and I and

2972
00:54:41,829 --> 00:54:41,839
when I first got there I guess and I and
 

2973
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:43,430
when I first got there I guess and I and
we would interact every now and then I'd

2974
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:43,440
we would interact every now and then I'd
 

2975
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:47,190
we would interact every now and then I'd
say that so I'd say our our biggest

2976
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:47,200
say that so I'd say our our biggest
 

2977
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:51,190
say that so I'd say our our biggest
difference is our methods and so um

2978
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:51,200
difference is our methods and so um
 

2979
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,549
difference is our methods and so um
that's the biggest difference between me

2980
00:54:52,549 --> 00:54:52,559
that's the biggest difference between me
 

2981
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:57,069
that's the biggest difference between me
and gnome uh is that I gather data from

2982
00:54:57,069 --> 00:54:57,079
and gnome uh is that I gather data from
 

2983
00:54:57,079 --> 00:54:59,670
and gnome uh is that I gather data from
people I uh do experiments with people

2984
00:54:59,670 --> 00:54:59,680
people I uh do experiments with people
 

2985
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,470
people I uh do experiments with people
and I gather Corpus data whatever

2986
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:01,480
and I gather Corpus data whatever
 

2987
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:03,069
and I gather Corpus data whatever
whatever Corpus data is available and we

2988
00:55:03,069 --> 00:55:03,079
whatever Corpus data is available and we
 

2989
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:06,990
whatever Corpus data is available and we
do quantitative methods to evaluate any

2990
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:07,000
do quantitative methods to evaluate any
 

2991
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,069
do quantitative methods to evaluate any
kind of hypothesis we have he just

2992
00:55:09,069 --> 00:55:09,079
kind of hypothesis we have he just
 

2993
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:11,230
kind of hypothesis we have he just
doesn't do that so you know you you know

2994
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:11,240
doesn't do that so you know you you know
 

2995
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:14,390
doesn't do that so you know you you know
he has never once been associated with

2996
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:14,400
he has never once been associated with
 

2997
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,630
he has never once been associated with
any experiment or Corpus work ever and

2998
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:16,640
any experiment or Corpus work ever and
 

2999
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,950
any experiment or Corpus work ever and
so it's all thought experiments it's his

3000
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:19,960
so it's all thought experiments it's his
 

3001
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,109
so it's all thought experiments it's his
own intuitions so I I just don't think

3002
00:55:22,109 --> 00:55:22,119
own intuitions so I I just don't think
 

3003
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:25,549
own intuitions so I I just don't think
that's the way to do things um that's a

3004
00:55:25,549 --> 00:55:25,559
that's the way to do things um that's a
 

3005
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:27,390
that's the way to do things um that's a
that's a you know across the street

3006
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:27,400
that's a you know across the street
 

3007
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,789
that's a you know across the street
they're across the street from us kind

3008
00:55:28,789 --> 00:55:28,799
they're across the street from us kind
 

3009
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:31,270
they're across the street from us kind
of difference between brain and kogai

3010
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:31,280
of difference between brain and kogai
 

3011
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,069
of difference between brain and kogai
and Linguistics I mean not all lingu

3012
00:55:33,069 --> 00:55:33,079
and Linguistics I mean not all lingu
 

3013
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:34,829
and Linguistics I mean not all lingu
some of the linguists depending on what

3014
00:55:34,829 --> 00:55:34,839
some of the linguists depending on what
 

3015
00:55:34,839 --> 00:55:37,430
some of the linguists depending on what
you do more speech oriented they do more

3016
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:37,440
you do more speech oriented they do more
 

3017
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,029
you do more speech oriented they do more
quantitative stuff but in the in the

3018
00:55:40,029 --> 00:55:40,039
quantitative stuff but in the in the
 

3019
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:42,589
quantitative stuff but in the in the
meaning um words and well it's

3020
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:42,599
meaning um words and well it's
 

3021
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:44,430
meaning um words and well it's
combinations of words syntax semantics

3022
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:44,440
combinations of words syntax semantics
 

3023
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:48,190
combinations of words syntax semantics
they tend not to do experiments and uh

3024
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:48,200
they tend not to do experiments and uh
 

3025
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:51,309
they tend not to do experiments and uh
and Corpus analyses so listic size

3026
00:55:51,309 --> 00:55:51,319
and Corpus analyses so listic size
 

3027
00:55:51,319 --> 00:55:54,270
and Corpus analyses so listic size
probably well the but the method is a

3028
00:55:54,270 --> 00:55:54,280
probably well the but the method is a
 

3029
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,549
probably well the but the method is a
symptom of a bigger approach which is

3030
00:55:56,549 --> 00:55:56,559
symptom of a bigger approach which is
 

3031
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,630
symptom of a bigger approach which is
sort of a psychology philosophy side on

3032
00:55:58,630 --> 00:55:58,640
sort of a psychology philosophy side on
 

3033
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,589
sort of a psychology philosophy side on
gome and for you it's more sort of

3034
00:56:00,589 --> 00:56:00,599
gome and for you it's more sort of
 

3035
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:02,349
gome and for you it's more sort of
datadriven sort of almost like

3036
00:56:02,349 --> 00:56:02,359
datadriven sort of almost like
 

3037
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,789
datadriven sort of almost like
mathematical approach yeah I mean I'm

3038
00:56:04,789 --> 00:56:04,799
mathematical approach yeah I mean I'm
 

3039
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:06,630
mathematical approach yeah I mean I'm
psychologist so I would say we're in

3040
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:06,640
psychologist so I would say we're in
 

3041
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,549
psychologist so I would say we're in
Psychology you know I I me brain

3042
00:56:08,549 --> 00:56:08,559
Psychology you know I I me brain
 

3043
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:10,750
Psychology you know I I me brain
cognitive science is is mit's old

3044
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:10,760
cognitive science is is mit's old
 

3045
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,430
cognitive science is is mit's old
psychology department it was the

3046
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:12,440
psychology department it was the
 

3047
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,230
psychology department it was the
psychology department up until 1985 and

3048
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:14,240
psychology department up until 1985 and
 

3049
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,789
psychology department up until 1985 and
it became the brain and Cog cognitive

3050
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:15,799
it became the brain and Cog cognitive
 

3051
00:56:15,799 --> 00:56:18,150
it became the brain and Cog cognitive
science department and so I I mean my

3052
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:18,160
science department and so I I mean my
 

3053
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,910
science department and so I I mean my
training is in Psych I mean my training

3054
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:19,920
training is in Psych I mean my training
 

3055
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,549
training is in Psych I mean my training
is math and computer science but I'm a

3056
00:56:21,549 --> 00:56:21,559
is math and computer science but I'm a
 

3057
00:56:21,559 --> 00:56:23,630
is math and computer science but I'm a
psychologist I mean I'm I mean I don't

3058
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:23,640
psychologist I mean I'm I mean I don't
 

3059
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,190
psychologist I mean I'm I mean I don't
know what I am so data driven

3060
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:25,200
know what I am so data driven
 

3061
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,950
know what I am so data driven
psychologist yeah you are I am what I am

3062
00:56:27,950 --> 00:56:27,960
psychologist yeah you are I am what I am
 

3063
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,510
psychologist yeah you are I am what I am
but but I'm happy to be called a

3064
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:29,520
but but I'm happy to be called a
 

3065
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,670
but but I'm happy to be called a
linguist I'm happy to be called a

3066
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:30,680
linguist I'm happy to be called a
 

3067
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:31,870
linguist I'm happy to be called a
computer scientist I'm happy to be

3068
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:31,880
computer scientist I'm happy to be
 

3069
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,309
computer scientist I'm happy to be
called a psychologist any of those

3070
00:56:33,309 --> 00:56:33,319
called a psychologist any of those
 

3071
00:56:33,319 --> 00:56:36,029
called a psychologist any of those
things in the actual uh like how that

3072
00:56:36,029 --> 00:56:36,039
things in the actual uh like how that
 

3073
00:56:36,039 --> 00:56:38,230
things in the actual uh like how that
manifests itself outside the methodology

3074
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:38,240
manifests itself outside the methodology
 

3075
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,990
manifests itself outside the methodology
is like these differences these subtle

3076
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:40,000
is like these differences these subtle
 

3077
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,789
is like these differences these subtle
differences about the movement Story

3078
00:56:41,789 --> 00:56:41,799
differences about the movement Story
 

3079
00:56:41,799 --> 00:56:44,670
differences about the movement Story
versus the lexical copy story those are

3080
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:44,680
versus the lexical copy story those are
 

3081
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,789
versus the lexical copy story those are
theories so the the like the theories

3082
00:56:46,789 --> 00:56:46,799
theories so the the like the theories
 

3083
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:48,870
theories so the the like the theories
are I but I think the the reason we

3084
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:48,880
are I but I think the the reason we
 

3085
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,190
are I but I think the the reason we
differ in part is because of how we

3086
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:51,200
differ in part is because of how we
 

3087
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,349
differ in part is because of how we
evaluate the theories and so I evaluate

3088
00:56:53,349 --> 00:56:53,359
evaluate the theories and so I evaluate
 

3089
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:58,029
evaluate the theories and so I evaluate
theories quantitatively and gnome

3090
00:56:58,029 --> 00:56:58,039
theories quantitatively and gnome
 

3091
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:00,630
theories quantitatively and gnome
doesn't got it okay well let's let's

3092
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:00,640
doesn't got it okay well let's let's
 

3093
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,789
doesn't got it okay well let's let's
explore the theories that you explore in

3094
00:57:02,789 --> 00:57:02,799
explore the theories that you explore in
 

3095
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:05,589
explore the theories that you explore in
your book Let's return to this

3096
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:05,599
your book Let's return to this
 

3097
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:08,430
your book Let's return to this
dependency grammar framework of looking

3098
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:08,440
dependency grammar framework of looking
 

3099
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,069
dependency grammar framework of looking
at language what's uh a good

3100
00:57:11,069 --> 00:57:11,079
at language what's uh a good
 

3101
00:57:11,079 --> 00:57:12,829
at language what's uh a good
justification why the dependency grammar

3102
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:12,839
justification why the dependency grammar
 

3103
00:57:12,839 --> 00:57:14,349
justification why the dependency grammar
framework is a good way to explain

3104
00:57:14,349 --> 00:57:14,359
framework is a good way to explain
 

3105
00:57:14,359 --> 00:57:17,750
framework is a good way to explain
language what's your intuition so the

3106
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:17,760
language what's your intuition so the
 

3107
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,589
language what's your intuition so the
reason I like dependency grammar as I've

3108
00:57:20,589 --> 00:57:20,599
reason I like dependency grammar as I've
 

3109
00:57:20,599 --> 00:57:21,789
reason I like dependency grammar as I've
said before is that it's very

3110
00:57:21,789 --> 00:57:21,799
said before is that it's very
 

3111
00:57:21,799 --> 00:57:24,750
said before is that it's very
transparent about its representation of

3112
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:24,760
transparent about its representation of
 

3113
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,230
transparent about its representation of
distance between words so it's like it

3114
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:27,240
distance between words so it's like it
 

3115
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,390
distance between words so it's like it
all it is is you've got a bunch of words

3116
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:29,400
all it is is you've got a bunch of words
 

3117
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,109
all it is is you've got a bunch of words
you're connect them together to make a

3118
00:57:31,109 --> 00:57:31,119
you're connect them together to make a
 

3119
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:32,910
you're connect them together to make a
sentence

3120
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:32,920
sentence
 

3121
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:35,549
sentence
and a really neat

3122
00:57:35,549 --> 00:57:35,559
and a really neat
 

3123
00:57:35,559 --> 00:57:37,990
and a really neat
Insight which turns out to be true is

3124
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:38,000
Insight which turns out to be true is
 

3125
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,510
Insight which turns out to be true is
that the further apart the pair of words

3126
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:40,520
that the further apart the pair of words
 

3127
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:41,990
that the further apart the pair of words
are that you're connecting the harder it

3128
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:42,000
are that you're connecting the harder it
 

3129
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,589
are that you're connecting the harder it
is to do the production the harder it is

3130
00:57:43,589 --> 00:57:43,599
is to do the production the harder it is
 

3131
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:45,109
is to do the production the harder it is
to do the comprehension it's it's harder

3132
00:57:45,109 --> 00:57:45,119
to do the comprehension it's it's harder
 

3133
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:46,470
to do the comprehension it's it's harder
to produce it's hard to understand when

3134
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:46,480
to produce it's hard to understand when
 

3135
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:47,589
to produce it's hard to understand when
the words are far apart when they're

3136
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:47,599
the words are far apart when they're
 

3137
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:50,270
the words are far apart when they're
close together it's easy to produce and

3138
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:50,280
close together it's easy to produce and
 

3139
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:52,549
close together it's easy to produce and
it's easy to comprehend let me give you

3140
00:57:52,549 --> 00:57:52,559
it's easy to comprehend let me give you
 

3141
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:55,829
it's easy to comprehend let me give you
an example okay so we have in any

3142
00:57:55,829 --> 00:57:55,839
an example okay so we have in any
 

3143
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:56,829
an example okay so we have in any
language

3144
00:57:56,829 --> 00:57:56,839
language
 

3145
00:57:56,839 --> 00:58:00,150
language
we have mostly local connections between

3146
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:00,160
we have mostly local connections between
 

3147
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,190
we have mostly local connections between
words but they're abstract the the

3148
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:02,200
words but they're abstract the the
 

3149
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,630
words but they're abstract the the
connections are abstract they're between

3150
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:03,640
connections are abstract they're between
 

3151
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,630
connections are abstract they're between
categories of words and so you can

3152
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:05,640
categories of words and so you can
 

3153
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:09,150
categories of words and so you can
always make things further apart if you

3154
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:09,160
always make things further apart if you
 

3155
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,510
always make things further apart if you
put your if you add modification for

3156
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:11,520
put your if you add modification for
 

3157
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,910
put your if you add modification for
example after a noun so a noun in

3158
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:14,920
example after a noun so a noun in
 

3159
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:17,549
example after a noun so a noun in
English comes before a verb the subject

3160
00:58:17,549 --> 00:58:17,559
English comes before a verb the subject
 

3161
00:58:17,559 --> 00:58:19,430
English comes before a verb the subject
noun comes before a verb and then

3162
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:19,440
noun comes before a verb and then
 

3163
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,990
noun comes before a verb and then
there's an an object after for example

3164
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:22,000
there's an an object after for example
 

3165
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,390
there's an an object after for example
so I can say what I said before you know

3166
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:23,400
so I can say what I said before you know
 

3167
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,870
so I can say what I said before you know
the dog entered the room or something

3168
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:24,880
the dog entered the room or something
 

3169
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,630
the dog entered the room or something
like that so I can modify dog if I say

3170
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:27,640
like that so I can modify dog if I say
 

3171
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,470
like that so I can modify dog if I say
something more about dog after it then

3172
00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:29,480
something more about dog after it then
 

3173
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:32,270
something more about dog after it then
what I'm doing is in indirectly I'm

3174
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:32,280
what I'm doing is in indirectly I'm
 

3175
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:33,670
what I'm doing is in indirectly I'm
lengthening the dependence the

3176
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:33,680
lengthening the dependence the
 

3177
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,029
lengthening the dependence the
dependence between dog and entered by

3178
00:58:36,029 --> 00:58:36,039
dependence between dog and entered by
 

3179
00:58:36,039 --> 00:58:38,150
dependence between dog and entered by
adding more stuff to it so I just make

3180
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:38,160
adding more stuff to it so I just make
 

3181
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:41,510
adding more stuff to it so I just make
just make it explicit here if I say um

3182
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:41,520
just make it explicit here if I say um
 

3183
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:47,029
just make it explicit here if I say um
uh the the boy who the cat scratched

3184
00:58:47,029 --> 00:58:47,039
uh the the boy who the cat scratched
 

3185
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:48,990
uh the the boy who the cat scratched
cried we're going to have a mean cat

3186
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:49,000
cried we're going to have a mean cat
 

3187
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,470
cried we're going to have a mean cat
here and uh and so what I've got here is

3188
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:51,480
here and uh and so what I've got here is
 

3189
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,470
here and uh and so what I've got here is
I the boy cried it would be a very short

3190
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:53,480
I the boy cried it would be a very short
 

3191
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,390
I the boy cried it would be a very short
simple sentence and I just told you

3192
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:55,400
simple sentence and I just told you
 

3193
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,589
simple sentence and I just told you
something about

3194
00:58:56,589 --> 00:58:56,599
something about
 

3195
00:58:56,599 --> 00:58:58,789
something about
the the boy and I told you it was it was

3196
00:58:58,789 --> 00:58:58,799
the the boy and I told you it was it was
 

3197
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:01,309
the the boy and I told you it was it was
the boy who the cat scratched okay so

3198
00:59:01,309 --> 00:59:01,319
the boy who the cat scratched okay so
 

3199
00:59:01,319 --> 00:59:03,470
the boy who the cat scratched okay so
the CED is connected to the boy C at the

3200
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:03,480
the CED is connected to the boy C at the
 

3201
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,309
the CED is connected to the boy C at the
end it's connected to the boy in the

3202
00:59:05,309 --> 00:59:05,319
end it's connected to the boy in the
 

3203
00:59:05,319 --> 00:59:07,309
end it's connected to the boy in the
beginning right and so I can do that I

3204
00:59:07,309 --> 00:59:07,319
beginning right and so I can do that I
 

3205
00:59:07,319 --> 00:59:08,750
beginning right and so I can do that I
can say that that's a perfectly fine

3206
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:08,760
can say that that's a perfectly fine
 

3207
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:12,990
can say that that's a perfectly fine
English sentence and I can say the cat

3208
00:59:12,990 --> 00:59:13,000
English sentence and I can say the cat
 

3209
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,109
English sentence and I can say the cat
which the dog chased ran away or

3210
00:59:16,109 --> 00:59:16,119
which the dog chased ran away or
 

3211
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:18,470
which the dog chased ran away or
something okay I can do that but I it's

3212
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:18,480
something okay I can do that but I it's
 

3213
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,190
something okay I can do that but I it's
really so I but it's really hard now I

3214
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:21,200
really so I but it's really hard now I
 

3215
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,710
really so I but it's really hard now I
I've got whatever I have here I have the

3216
00:59:22,710 --> 00:59:22,720
I've got whatever I have here I have the
 

3217
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:25,510
I've got whatever I have here I have the
boy who the cat now let's say I try to

3218
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:25,520
boy who the cat now let's say I try to
 

3219
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:29,670
boy who the cat now let's say I try to
modify cat cat Okay the boy who the cat

3220
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:29,680
modify cat cat Okay the boy who the cat
 

3221
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,870
modify cat cat Okay the boy who the cat
which the dog chased scratched ran away

3222
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:32,880
which the dog chased scratched ran away
 

3223
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,069
which the dog chased scratched ran away
oh my God that's hard right I I can I'm

3224
00:59:35,069 --> 00:59:35,079
oh my God that's hard right I I can I'm
 

3225
00:59:35,079 --> 00:59:36,309
oh my God that's hard right I I can I'm
sort of just working that through in my

3226
00:59:36,309 --> 00:59:36,319
sort of just working that through in my
 

3227
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,309
sort of just working that through in my
head how to produce and how to and it's

3228
00:59:38,309 --> 00:59:38,319
head how to produce and how to and it's
 

3229
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:40,150
head how to produce and how to and it's
really very just horrendous to

3230
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:40,160
really very just horrendous to
 

3231
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,309
really very just horrendous to
understand it's not so bad at least I've

3232
00:59:42,309 --> 00:59:42,319
understand it's not so bad at least I've
 

3233
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:43,910
understand it's not so bad at least I've
got intonation there to sort of Mark the

3234
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:43,920
got intonation there to sort of Mark the
 

3235
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,789
got intonation there to sort of Mark the
boundaries and stuff but it's that's

3236
00:59:45,789 --> 00:59:45,799
boundaries and stuff but it's that's
 

3237
00:59:45,799 --> 00:59:48,430
boundaries and stuff but it's that's
really complicated that's sort of

3238
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:48,440
really complicated that's sort of
 

3239
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:50,430
really complicated that's sort of
English in a way I mean that follows the

3240
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:50,440
English in a way I mean that follows the
 

3241
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,750
English in a way I mean that follows the
rules of English but uh so what's

3242
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:52,760
rules of English but uh so what's
 

3243
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,430
rules of English but uh so what's
interesting about that is is that what

3244
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:54,440
interesting about that is is that what
 

3245
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,190
interesting about that is is that what
I'm doing is nesting dependencies there

3246
00:59:56,190 --> 00:59:56,200
I'm doing is nesting dependencies there
 

3247
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,870
I'm doing is nesting dependencies there
I'm putting one con I've got a subject

3248
00:59:58,870 --> 00:59:58,880
I'm putting one con I've got a subject
 

3249
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,150
I'm putting one con I've got a subject
connected to a verb there and and then

3250
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:01,160
connected to a verb there and and then
 

3251
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:03,470
connected to a verb there and and then
I'm modifying that with a a a clause

3252
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:03,480
I'm modifying that with a a a clause
 

3253
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,069
I'm modifying that with a a a clause
another clause which happens to have a

3254
01:00:05,069 --> 01:00:05,079
another clause which happens to have a
 

3255
01:00:05,079 --> 01:00:06,549
another clause which happens to have a
subject in a verb relation I'm trying to

3256
01:00:06,549 --> 01:00:06,559
subject in a verb relation I'm trying to
 

3257
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:08,190
subject in a verb relation I'm trying to
do that again on that second one and

3258
01:00:08,190 --> 01:00:08,200
do that again on that second one and
 

3259
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:10,589
do that again on that second one and
what that does is it lengthens out the

3260
01:00:10,589 --> 01:00:10,599
what that does is it lengthens out the
 

3261
01:00:10,599 --> 01:00:12,349
what that does is it lengthens out the
dependence multiple dependence actually

3262
01:00:12,349 --> 01:00:12,359
dependence multiple dependence actually
 

3263
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:13,390
dependence multiple dependence actually
get lengthened out there the

3264
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:13,400
get lengthened out there the
 

3265
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,349
get lengthened out there the
dependencies get get longer longer on

3266
01:00:15,349 --> 01:00:15,359
dependencies get get longer longer on
 

3267
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:17,109
dependencies get get longer longer on
the outside ones get long and even the

3268
01:00:17,109 --> 01:00:17,119
the outside ones get long and even the
 

3269
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:19,190
the outside ones get long and even the
ones in between get kind of long and and

3270
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:19,200
ones in between get kind of long and and
 

3271
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,990
ones in between get kind of long and and
and you just so what's fascinating is

3272
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:22,000
and you just so what's fascinating is
 

3273
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,549
and you just so what's fascinating is
that that's bad that's really horrendous

3274
01:00:24,549 --> 01:00:24,559
that that's bad that's really horrendous
 

3275
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:27,470
that that's bad that's really horrendous
in English but that's horrendous in any

3276
01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:27,480
in English but that's horrendous in any
 

3277
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,270
in English but that's horrendous in any
language and so in in no matter what

3278
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:29,280
language and so in in no matter what
 

3279
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,990
language and so in in no matter what
language you look at if you do just

3280
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:32,000
language you look at if you do just
 

3281
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,630
language you look at if you do just
figure out some structure where I'm

3282
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:33,640
figure out some structure where I'm
 

3283
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:34,950
figure out some structure where I'm
going to have some modification

3284
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:34,960
going to have some modification
 

3285
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,950
going to have some modification
following some head which is connected

3286
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:36,960
following some head which is connected
 

3287
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,950
following some head which is connected
some later head and I do it again it

3288
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:38,960
some later head and I do it again it
 

3289
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,789
some later head and I do it again it
won't be good guaranteed like 100% that

3290
01:00:41,789 --> 01:00:41,799
won't be good guaranteed like 100% that
 

3291
01:00:41,799 --> 01:00:44,470
won't be good guaranteed like 100% that
will be uninterpretable in that language

3292
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:44,480
will be uninterpretable in that language
 

3293
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,829
will be uninterpretable in that language
in the same way that was uninterpretable

3294
01:00:45,829 --> 01:00:45,839
in the same way that was uninterpretable
 

3295
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:47,990
in the same way that was uninterpretable
in English just clarify the distance of

3296
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:48,000
in English just clarify the distance of
 

3297
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,910
in English just clarify the distance of
the dependencies is whenever the uh boy

3298
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:52,920
the dependencies is whenever the uh boy
 

3299
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,549
the dependencies is whenever the uh boy
cried this um there's a dependence

3300
01:00:55,549 --> 01:00:55,559
cried this um there's a dependence
 

3301
01:00:55,559 --> 01:00:58,430
cried this um there's a dependence
between words and then you counting the

3302
01:00:58,430 --> 01:00:58,440
between words and then you counting the
 

3303
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:01,349
between words and then you counting the
number of what morphemes between them

3304
01:01:01,349 --> 01:01:01,359
number of what morphemes between them
 

3305
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:02,990
number of what morphemes between them
that's a good question I I just say

3306
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:03,000
that's a good question I I just say
 

3307
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,750
that's a good question I I just say
words your words are morphs between

3308
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:04,760
words your words are morphs between
 

3309
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,029
words your words are morphs between
don't we don't know that actually that's

3310
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:06,039
don't we don't know that actually that's
 

3311
01:01:06,039 --> 01:01:07,349
don't we don't know that actually that's
a very good question what is the

3312
01:01:07,349 --> 01:01:07,359
a very good question what is the
 

3313
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:08,910
a very good question what is the
distance metric but let's just say it's

3314
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:08,920
distance metric but let's just say it's
 

3315
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,710
distance metric but let's just say it's
words sure okay so that and you're

3316
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:10,720
words sure okay so that and you're
 

3317
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,950
words sure okay so that and you're
saying the longer the distance of that

3318
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:12,960
saying the longer the distance of that
 

3319
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,670
saying the longer the distance of that
dependence the more no matter the

3320
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:14,680
dependence the more no matter the
 

3321
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:20,390
dependence the more no matter the
language except legales uh even leg okay

3322
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:20,400
language except legales uh even leg okay
 

3323
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,270
language except legales uh even leg okay
we'll talk about it okay okay okay uh

3324
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:22,280
we'll talk about it okay okay okay uh
 

3325
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,390
we'll talk about it okay okay okay uh
but

3326
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:23,400
but
 

3327
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:26,230
but
that the people will be very upset that

3328
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:26,240
that the people will be very upset that
 

3329
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:27,750
that the people will be very upset that
speak that language not upset but

3330
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:27,760
speak that language not upset but
 

3331
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,549
speak that language not upset but
they'll either not understand it they'll

3332
01:01:29,549 --> 01:01:29,559
they'll either not understand it they'll
 

3333
01:01:29,559 --> 01:01:32,069
they'll either not understand it they'll
be like this is they'll uh their brain

3334
01:01:32,069 --> 01:01:32,079
be like this is they'll uh their brain
 

3335
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:34,109
be like this is they'll uh their brain
will be working in overtime yeah they

3336
01:01:34,109 --> 01:01:34,119
will be working in overtime yeah they
 

3337
01:01:34,119 --> 01:01:35,390
will be working in overtime yeah they
they'll have a hard time either

3338
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:35,400
they'll have a hard time either
 

3339
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,789
they'll have a hard time either
producing or comprehending it they might

3340
01:01:36,789 --> 01:01:36,799
producing or comprehending it they might
 

3341
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:38,349
producing or comprehending it they might
tell you that's not their language you

3342
01:01:38,349 --> 01:01:38,359
tell you that's not their language you
 

3343
01:01:38,359 --> 01:01:40,470
tell you that's not their language you
know it's sort of the language I mean it

3344
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:40,480
know it's sort of the language I mean it
 

3345
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:41,789
know it's sort of the language I mean it
it following their like they'll agree

3346
01:01:41,789 --> 01:01:41,799
it following their like they'll agree
 

3347
01:01:41,799 --> 01:01:43,190
it following their like they'll agree
with each of those pieces as part of

3348
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:43,200
with each of those pieces as part of
 

3349
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,630
with each of those pieces as part of
their language but somehow that

3350
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:44,640
their language but somehow that
 

3351
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,549
their language but somehow that
combination will be very very difficult

3352
01:01:46,549 --> 01:01:46,559
combination will be very very difficult
 

3353
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:48,430
combination will be very very difficult
to produce and understand is that a

3354
01:01:48,430 --> 01:01:48,440
to produce and understand is that a
 

3355
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:51,990
to produce and understand is that a
chicken or the egg issue here so like is

3356
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:52,000
chicken or the egg issue here so like is
 

3357
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,589
chicken or the egg issue here so like is
well I'm giving you an explanation so

3358
01:01:53,589 --> 01:01:53,599
well I'm giving you an explanation so
 

3359
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:56,510
well I'm giving you an explanation so
the I well I mean I didn't there's I'm

3360
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:56,520
the I well I mean I didn't there's I'm
 

3361
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,109
the I well I mean I didn't there's I'm
giving you two kinds of explanations I'm

3362
01:01:58,109 --> 01:01:58,119
giving you two kinds of explanations I'm
 

3363
01:01:58,119 --> 01:01:59,710
giving you two kinds of explanations I'm
telling you that Center embedding that's

3364
01:01:59,710 --> 01:01:59,720
telling you that Center embedding that's
 

3365
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,390
telling you that Center embedding that's
nesting those are the same those are

3366
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:01,400
nesting those are the same those are
 

3367
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,950
nesting those are the same those are
synonyms for the same concept here and

3368
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:03,960
synonyms for the same concept here and
 

3369
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,750
synonyms for the same concept here and
I'm the explanation for why those are

3370
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:05,760
I'm the explanation for why those are
 

3371
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,390
I'm the explanation for why those are
always hard Centum bedding and nesting

3372
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:07,400
always hard Centum bedding and nesting
 

3373
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,510
always hard Centum bedding and nesting
are always hard and I give you an

3374
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:08,520
are always hard and I give you an
 

3375
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,430
are always hard and I give you an
explanation for why they might be hard

3376
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:10,440
explanation for why they might be hard
 

3377
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:11,789
explanation for why they might be hard
which is longdistance connections

3378
01:02:11,789 --> 01:02:11,799
which is longdistance connections
 

3379
01:02:11,799 --> 01:02:13,589
which is longdistance connections
there's a when you do Centrum Bing when

3380
01:02:13,589 --> 01:02:13,599
there's a when you do Centrum Bing when
 

3381
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:14,950
there's a when you do Centrum Bing when
you do nesting you always have

3382
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:14,960
you do nesting you always have
 

3383
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,349
you do nesting you always have
long-distance connections between the

3384
01:02:16,349 --> 01:02:16,359
long-distance connections between the
 

3385
01:02:16,359 --> 01:02:18,269
long-distance connections between the
dependents you just so that's not

3386
01:02:18,269 --> 01:02:18,279
dependents you just so that's not
 

3387
01:02:18,279 --> 01:02:19,710
dependents you just so that's not
necessarily the right explanation it

3388
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:19,720
necessarily the right explanation it
 

3389
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,589
necessarily the right explanation it
just ha I can go through reasons why

3390
01:02:21,589 --> 01:02:21,599
just ha I can go through reasons why
 

3391
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:23,510
just ha I can go through reasons why
that's probably a good explanation and

3392
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:23,520
that's probably a good explanation and
 

3393
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,510
that's probably a good explanation and
it's not really just about one of them

3394
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:25,520
it's not really just about one of them
 

3395
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:28,309
it's not really just about one of them
it so probably it's a a pair of them or

3396
01:02:28,309 --> 01:02:28,319
it so probably it's a a pair of them or
 

3397
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:30,069
it so probably it's a a pair of them or
something of these dependents that you

3398
01:02:30,069 --> 01:02:30,079
something of these dependents that you
 

3399
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,430
something of these dependents that you
get get long that drives you to like be

3400
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:32,440
get get long that drives you to like be
 

3401
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:34,309
get get long that drives you to like be
really confused in that case and so what

3402
01:02:34,309 --> 01:02:34,319
really confused in that case and so what
 

3403
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:37,029
really confused in that case and so what
the the behavioral consequence there if

3404
01:02:37,029 --> 01:02:37,039
the the behavioral consequence there if
 

3405
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:39,789
the the behavioral consequence there if
you I mean we this is kind of methods

3406
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:39,799
you I mean we this is kind of methods
 

3407
01:02:39,799 --> 01:02:41,950
you I mean we this is kind of methods
like how do we get at this you could try

3408
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:41,960
like how do we get at this you could try
 

3409
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,390
like how do we get at this you could try
to do experiments to get people to

3410
01:02:43,390 --> 01:02:43,400
to do experiments to get people to
 

3411
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,710
to do experiments to get people to
produce these things they're going to

3412
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:44,720
produce these things they're going to
 

3413
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,269
produce these things they're going to
have a hard time producing them you can

3414
01:02:46,269 --> 01:02:46,279
have a hard time producing them you can
 

3415
01:02:46,279 --> 01:02:47,710
have a hard time producing them you can
try to do experiments to get them to

3416
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:47,720
try to do experiments to get them to
 

3417
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:49,870
try to do experiments to get them to
understand them get and see how well

3418
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:49,880
understand them get and see how well
 

3419
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:51,670
understand them get and see how well
they understand them can they understand

3420
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:51,680
they understand them can they understand
 

3421
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:54,069
they understand them can they understand
them uh another method you can do is

3422
01:02:54,069 --> 01:02:54,079
them uh another method you can do is
 

3423
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:56,789
them uh another method you can do is
give people partial materials and ask

3424
01:02:56,789 --> 01:02:56,799
give people partial materials and ask
 

3425
01:02:56,799 --> 01:02:58,789
give people partial materials and ask
them to complete them you know those

3426
01:02:58,789 --> 01:02:58,799
them to complete them you know those
 

3427
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:00,670
them to complete them you know those
those Cent embedded materials and and

3428
01:03:00,670 --> 01:03:00,680
those Cent embedded materials and and
 

3429
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,990
those Cent embedded materials and and
they they'll fail so I've done that I've

3430
01:03:02,990 --> 01:03:03,000
they they'll fail so I've done that I've
 

3431
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,109
they they'll fail so I've done that I've
done all these kinds of things wait a

3432
01:03:05,109 --> 01:03:05,119
done all these kinds of things wait a
 

3433
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:08,190
done all these kinds of things wait a
minute so so Central embedding meaning

3434
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:08,200
minute so so Central embedding meaning
 

3435
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,750
minute so so Central embedding meaning
like you take a normal sentence like boy

3436
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:09,760
like you take a normal sentence like boy
 

3437
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,510
like you take a normal sentence like boy
cried and inject a bunch of crap in the

3438
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:11,520
cried and inject a bunch of crap in the
 

3439
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,230
cried and inject a bunch of crap in the
middle yes that separates the boy and

3440
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:14,240
middle yes that separates the boy and
 

3441
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,309
middle yes that separates the boy and
the cried yes okay that's Central

3442
01:03:16,309 --> 01:03:16,319
the cried yes okay that's Central
 

3443
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:18,829
the cried yes okay that's Central
bedding and nesting is on top of that no

3444
01:03:18,829 --> 01:03:18,839
bedding and nesting is on top of that no
 

3445
01:03:18,839 --> 01:03:20,349
bedding and nesting is on top of that no
no nesting is the same thing Cent Bing

3446
01:03:20,349 --> 01:03:20,359
no nesting is the same thing Cent Bing
 

3447
01:03:20,359 --> 01:03:22,230
no nesting is the same thing Cent Bing
those are totally equivalent terms I'm

3448
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:22,240
those are totally equivalent terms I'm
 

3449
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,150
those are totally equivalent terms I'm
sorry I sometimes use one and sometimes

3450
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:24,160
sorry I sometimes use one and sometimes
 

3451
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:27,950
sorry I sometimes use one and sometimes
got it got it different got it and then

3452
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:27,960
got it got it different got it and then
 

3453
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:29,789
got it got it different got it and then
uh what you're saying is there's a bunch

3454
01:03:29,789 --> 01:03:29,799
uh what you're saying is there's a bunch
 

3455
01:03:29,799 --> 01:03:31,029
uh what you're saying is there's a bunch
of different kinds of experiments you

3456
01:03:31,029 --> 01:03:31,039
of different kinds of experiments you
 

3457
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:32,670
of different kinds of experiments you
can do I mean I like the understanding

3458
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:32,680
can do I mean I like the understanding
 

3459
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,710
can do I mean I like the understanding
one is like have more embedding more

3460
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:34,720
one is like have more embedding more
 

3461
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,670
one is like have more embedding more
Central embedding is it easier or harder

3462
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:36,680
Central embedding is it easier or harder
 

3463
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:37,750
Central embedding is it easier or harder
to understand but then you have to

3464
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:37,760
to understand but then you have to
 

3465
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,309
to understand but then you have to
measure the level of understanding I

3466
01:03:39,309 --> 01:03:39,319
measure the level of understanding I
 

3467
01:03:39,319 --> 01:03:41,150
measure the level of understanding I
guess yeah yeah you could I mean there's

3468
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:41,160
guess yeah yeah you could I mean there's
 

3469
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:42,750
guess yeah yeah you could I mean there's
multiple ways to do that I mean there's

3470
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:42,760
multiple ways to do that I mean there's
 

3471
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:44,109
multiple ways to do that I mean there's
there's the simplest ways just ask

3472
01:03:44,109 --> 01:03:44,119
there's the simplest ways just ask
 

3473
01:03:44,119 --> 01:03:46,510
there's the simplest ways just ask
people how good is it sound how natural

3474
01:03:46,510 --> 01:03:46,520
people how good is it sound how natural
 

3475
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:48,430
people how good is it sound how natural
is it sound that's a very blunt but very

3476
01:03:48,430 --> 01:03:48,440
is it sound that's a very blunt but very
 

3477
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:50,589
is it sound that's a very blunt but very
good measure it's very very reliable

3478
01:03:50,589 --> 01:03:50,599
good measure it's very very reliable
 

3479
01:03:50,599 --> 01:03:52,589
good measure it's very very reliable
people will do the same thing and so

3480
01:03:52,589 --> 01:03:52,599
people will do the same thing and so
 

3481
01:03:52,599 --> 01:03:53,710
people will do the same thing and so
it's like I don't know what it means

3482
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:53,720
it's like I don't know what it means
 

3483
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,549
it's like I don't know what it means
exactly but it's doing something such

3484
01:03:55,549 --> 01:03:55,559
exactly but it's doing something such
 

3485
01:03:55,559 --> 01:03:56,990
exactly but it's doing something such
that we're measuring something about the

3486
01:03:56,990 --> 01:03:57,000
that we're measuring something about the
 

3487
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,710
that we're measuring something about the
confusion the difficulty associated with

3488
01:03:58,710 --> 01:03:58,720
confusion the difficulty associated with
 

3489
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,029
confusion the difficulty associated with
those and those like those are giving

3490
01:04:00,029 --> 01:04:00,039
those and those like those are giving
 

3491
01:04:00,039 --> 01:04:01,789
those and those like those are giving
you a signal that's why you can say that

3492
01:04:01,789 --> 01:04:01,799
you a signal that's why you can say that
 

3493
01:04:01,799 --> 01:04:04,390
you a signal that's why you can say that
okay what about the the completion of

3494
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:04,400
okay what about the the completion of
 

3495
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,990
okay what about the the completion of
this with the central so if you give

3496
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:06,000
this with the central so if you give
 

3497
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,510
this with the central so if you give
them a partial sentence say I say um the

3498
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:09,520
them a partial sentence say I say um the
 

3499
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:14,150
them a partial sentence say I say um the
book which the author who and I ask you

3500
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:14,160
book which the author who and I ask you
 

3501
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,109
book which the author who and I ask you
to now finish that off for me I mean

3502
01:04:16,109 --> 01:04:16,119
to now finish that off for me I mean
 

3503
01:04:16,119 --> 01:04:17,910
to now finish that off for me I mean
either say yeah yeah but you can just

3504
01:04:17,910 --> 01:04:17,920
either say yeah yeah but you can just
 

3505
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,190
either say yeah yeah but you can just
but it say it's written in front of you

3506
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:19,200
but it say it's written in front of you
 

3507
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,589
but it say it's written in front of you
and you can just type and have as much

3508
01:04:20,589 --> 01:04:20,599
and you can just type and have as much
 

3509
01:04:20,599 --> 01:04:22,870
and you can just type and have as much
time as you want they will even though

3510
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:22,880
time as you want they will even though
 

3511
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:24,470
time as you want they will even though
that one's not too hard right so if I

3512
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:24,480
that one's not too hard right so if I
 

3513
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,870
that one's not too hard right so if I
say it's like the book it's like oh the

3514
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:26,880
say it's like the book it's like oh the
 

3515
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:29,390
say it's like the book it's like oh the
the book which the author who I met

3516
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:29,400
the book which the author who I met
 

3517
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,589
the book which the author who I met
wrote was good you know that's a very

3518
01:04:31,589 --> 01:04:31,599
wrote was good you know that's a very
 

3519
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:33,950
wrote was good you know that's a very
simple completion for that you know if I

3520
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:33,960
simple completion for that you know if I
 

3521
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:36,230
simple completion for that you know if I
give that completion on online somewhere

3522
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:36,240
give that completion on online somewhere
 

3523
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,390
give that completion on online somewhere
to a uh you know um a crowdsourcing

3524
01:04:39,390 --> 01:04:39,400
to a uh you know um a crowdsourcing
 

3525
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:41,150
to a uh you know um a crowdsourcing
platform and ask people to complete that

3526
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:41,160
platform and ask people to complete that
 

3527
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:44,109
platform and ask people to complete that
they will miss off of a verb very

3528
01:04:44,109 --> 01:04:44,119
they will miss off of a verb very
 

3529
01:04:44,119 --> 01:04:45,630
they will miss off of a verb very
regularly like half the time maybe

3530
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:45,640
regularly like half the time maybe
 

3531
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,069
regularly like half the time maybe
two-thirds of the time they'll say

3532
01:04:47,069 --> 01:04:47,079
two-thirds of the time they'll say
 

3533
01:04:47,079 --> 01:04:48,549
two-thirds of the time they'll say
they'll just leave off one of those verb

3534
01:04:48,549 --> 01:04:48,559
they'll just leave off one of those verb
 

3535
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:50,710
they'll just leave off one of those verb
phrases even with that simple so say the

3536
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:50,720
phrases even with that simple so say the
 

3537
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:54,710
phrases even with that simple so say the
book uh which the author who and they'll

3538
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:54,720
book uh which the author who and they'll
 

3539
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:59,190
book uh which the author who and they'll
say was um um they won't you need three

3540
01:04:59,190 --> 01:04:59,200
say was um um they won't you need three
 

3541
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,710
say was um um they won't you need three
verbs right I need three verbs here who

3542
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:00,720
verbs right I need three verbs here who
 

3543
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,589
verbs right I need three verbs here who
I met wrote was good and they'll give me

3544
01:05:03,589 --> 01:05:03,599
I met wrote was good and they'll give me
 

3545
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:06,390
I met wrote was good and they'll give me
two they'll say who was who was famous

3546
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:06,400
two they'll say who was who was famous
 

3547
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,950
two they'll say who was who was famous
was good or something like that they'll

3548
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:07,960
was good or something like that they'll
 

3549
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:09,549
was good or something like that they'll
just give me two and and and that

3550
01:05:09,549 --> 01:05:09,559
just give me two and and and that
 

3551
01:05:09,559 --> 01:05:11,430
just give me two and and and that
that'll happen about 60% of the time so

3552
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:11,440
that'll happen about 60% of the time so
 

3553
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,470
that'll happen about 60% of the time so
40% maybe 30 they'll do it correctly

3554
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:14,480
40% maybe 30 they'll do it correctly
 

3555
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,349
40% maybe 30 they'll do it correctly
correctly meaning they'll do with three

3556
01:05:16,349 --> 01:05:16,359
correctly meaning they'll do with three
 

3557
01:05:16,359 --> 01:05:17,670
correctly meaning they'll do with three
verb phrases I don't know what's correct

3558
01:05:17,670 --> 01:05:17,680
verb phrases I don't know what's correct
 

3559
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,549
verb phrases I don't know what's correct
or not you know it this is hard it's a

3560
01:05:19,549 --> 01:05:19,559
or not you know it this is hard it's a
 

3561
01:05:19,559 --> 01:05:21,589
or not you know it this is hard it's a
hard task yeah I actually I'm struggling

3562
01:05:21,589 --> 01:05:21,599
hard task yeah I actually I'm struggling
 

3563
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:23,950
hard task yeah I actually I'm struggling
with it in my head well it's it's easier

3564
01:05:23,950 --> 01:05:23,960
with it in my head well it's it's easier
 

3565
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,870
with it in my head well it's it's easier
when you when you stare at it if you a

3566
01:05:25,870 --> 01:05:25,880
when you when you stare at it if you a
 

3567
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,349
when you when you stare at it if you a
little easier than listen listening is

3568
01:05:27,349 --> 01:05:27,359
little easier than listen listening is
 

3569
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:29,430
little easier than listen listening is
pretty tough because you have to because

3570
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:29,440
pretty tough because you have to because
 

3571
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,670
pretty tough because you have to because
there's no trace of it you have to

3572
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:31,680
there's no trace of it you have to
 

3573
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,510
there's no trace of it you have to
remember the words that I'm saying which

3574
01:05:33,510 --> 01:05:33,520
remember the words that I'm saying which
 

3575
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,990
remember the words that I'm saying which
is very hard auditorily we wouldn't do

3576
01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:35,000
is very hard auditorily we wouldn't do
 

3577
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,710
is very hard auditorily we wouldn't do
it this way we you do it written you can

3578
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:36,720
it this way we you do it written you can
 

3579
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,069
it this way we you do it written you can
look at it and figure it out it's easier

3580
01:05:39,069 --> 01:05:39,079
look at it and figure it out it's easier
 

3581
01:05:39,079 --> 01:05:40,470
look at it and figure it out it's easier
in many dimensions in some ways

3582
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:40,480
in many dimensions in some ways
 

3583
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:41,990
in many dimensions in some ways
depending on the the person it's easier

3584
01:05:41,990 --> 01:05:42,000
depending on the the person it's easier
 

3585
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,510
depending on the the person it's easier
to gather written data for I mean most

3586
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:45,520
to gather written data for I mean most
 

3587
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,109
to gather written data for I mean most

Linguistics right psychology of language
 

3591
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:51,069

01:05:51,069 --> 01:05:51,079
and stuff and so a lot of our work is
 

3593
01:05:51,079 --> 01:05:53,150

based on written stuff because it's so
 

3595
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:55,750
based on written stuff because it's so
easy to gather data from people doing

01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:55,760
easy to gather data from people doing
 

3597
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,950
easy to gather data from people doing
written kind of Tas spoken tasks are

3598
01:05:57,950 --> 01:05:57,960
written kind of Tas spoken tasks are
 

3599
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:00,950
written kind of Tas spoken tasks are
just more complicated to administer and

3600
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:00,960
just more complicated to administer and
 

3601
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,390
just more complicated to administer and
analyze because people do weird things

3602
01:06:03,390 --> 01:06:03,400
analyze because people do weird things
 

3603
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,950
analyze because people do weird things
when they speak and it's harder to

3604
01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:04,960
when they speak and it's harder to
 

3605
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,910
when they speak and it's harder to
analyze what they do but they um they

3606
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:07,920
analyze what they do but they um they
 

3607
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,430
analyze what they do but they um they
they generally point to the same kinds

3608
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:09,440
they generally point to the same kinds
 

3609
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,870
they generally point to the same kinds
of things so okay so the the universal

theory of language Yeah by Ted Gibson is

3612
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:15,640
theory of language Yeah by Ted Gibson is
 

3613
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:18,150
theory of language Yeah by Ted Gibson is
uh that you can form

3614
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:18,160
uh that you can form
 

3615
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,430
uh that you can form
dependency you can form trees from many

3616
01:06:20,430 --> 01:06:20,440
dependency you can form trees from many
 

3617
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,390
dependency you can form trees from many
sentences and right you can measure the

3618
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:22,400
sentences and right you can measure the
 

3619
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,150
sentences and right you can measure the
distance in some way of those

3620
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:24,160
distance in some way of those
 

3621
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:27,309
distance in some way of those
dependencies and then you can say that

3622
01:06:27,309 --> 01:06:27,319
dependencies and then you can say that
 

3623
01:06:27,319 --> 01:06:29,630
dependencies and then you can say that
uh most languages have very short

3624
01:06:29,630 --> 01:06:29,640
uh most languages have very short
 

3625
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:32,069
uh most languages have very short
dependencies all languages all languages

3626
01:06:32,069 --> 01:06:32,079
dependencies all languages all languages
 

3627
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:33,630
dependencies all languages all languages
all languages have short dependencies

3628
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:33,640
all languages have short dependencies
 

3629
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:36,510
all languages have short dependencies
you can actually measure that so uh an

3630
01:06:36,510 --> 01:06:36,520
you can actually measure that so uh an
 

3631
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:38,349
you can actually measure that so uh an

Futrell did a thing of bunch of years

3636
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:41,920
Futrell did a thing of bunch of years
 

3637
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,750
Futrell did a thing of bunch of years
ago now where he looked at all the

3638
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:44,760
ago now where he looked at all the
 

3639
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:46,309
ago now where he looked at all the
languages we could look at which was

3640
01:06:46,309 --> 01:06:46,319
languages we could look at which was
 

3641
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:48,510
languages we could look at which was
about 40 initially and now I think

3642
01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:48,520
about 40 initially and now I think
 

3643
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:50,829
about 40 initially and now I think
there's about 60 for which there are

3644
01:06:50,829 --> 01:06:50,839
there's about 60 for which there are
 

3645
01:06:50,839 --> 01:06:52,910
there's about 60 for which there are
dependency structures like you so

3646
01:06:52,910 --> 01:06:52,920
dependency structures like you so
 

3647
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:54,349
dependency structures like you so
they're meaning there got to be like a

3648
01:06:54,349 --> 01:06:54,359
they're meaning there got to be like a
 

3649
01:06:54,359 --> 01:06:56,309
they're meaning there got to be like a
big text a bunch of text which have been

3650
01:06:56,309 --> 01:06:56,319
big text a bunch of text which have been
 

3651
01:06:56,319 --> 01:06:58,750
big text a bunch of text which have been
parsed for the dependency structures and

3652
01:06:58,750 --> 01:06:58,760
parsed for the dependency structures and
 

3653
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,150
parsed for the dependency structures and
there's about 60 of those which have

3654
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:00,160
there's about 60 of those which have
 

3655
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,470
there's about 60 of those which have
been parsed that way and for all of

3656
01:07:02,470 --> 01:07:02,480
been parsed that way and for all of
 

3657
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:05,470
been parsed that way and for all of
those um you can what what he did was

3658
01:07:05,470 --> 01:07:05,480
those um you can what what he did was
 

3659
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,950
those um you can what what he did was
take any um any sentence in one of those

3660
01:07:07,950 --> 01:07:07,960
take any um any sentence in one of those
 

3661
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,950
take any um any sentence in one of those
languages and uh and you can do the

3662
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:09,960
languages and uh and you can do the
 

3663
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,390
languages and uh and you can do the
dependency structure and then start at

3664
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:11,400
dependency structure and then start at
 

3665
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,670
dependency structure and then start at
the root we we're talking about

3666
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:12,680
the root we we're talking about
 

3667
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:14,029
the root we we're talking about
dependency structures that's pretty easy

3668
01:07:14,029 --> 01:07:14,039
dependency structures that's pretty easy
 

3669
01:07:14,039 --> 01:07:16,109
dependency structures that's pretty easy
now and and he's trying to figure out

3670
01:07:16,109 --> 01:07:16,119
now and and he's trying to figure out
 

3671
01:07:16,119 --> 01:07:19,029
now and and he's trying to figure out
what a control way you might say the

3672
01:07:19,029 --> 01:07:19,039
what a control way you might say the
 

3673
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:21,390
what a control way you might say the
same sentence is in that language and so

3674
01:07:21,390 --> 01:07:21,400
same sentence is in that language and so
 

3675
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:23,309
same sentence is in that language and so
we is just like all right there's a root

3676
01:07:23,309 --> 01:07:23,319
we is just like all right there's a root
 

3677
01:07:23,319 --> 01:07:26,069
we is just like all right there's a root
and it has let's say as a sentence is um

3678
01:07:26,069 --> 01:07:26,079
and it has let's say as a sentence is um
 

3679
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,349
and it has let's say as a sentence is um
let's go back to you know two dogs

3680
01:07:27,349 --> 01:07:27,359
let's go back to you know two dogs
 

3681
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,789
let's go back to you know two dogs
entered the room so entered is the root

3682
01:07:29,789 --> 01:07:29,799
entered the room so entered is the root
 

3683
01:07:29,799 --> 01:07:32,589
entered the room so entered is the root
and entered has um two dependents it's

3684
01:07:32,589 --> 01:07:32,599
and entered has um two dependents it's
 

3685
01:07:32,599 --> 01:07:35,470
and entered has um two dependents it's
got dogs and it has room okay and what

3686
01:07:35,470 --> 01:07:35,480
got dogs and it has room okay and what
 

3687
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:37,109
got dogs and it has room okay and what
he does is like let's scramble that

3688
01:07:37,109 --> 01:07:37,119
he does is like let's scramble that
 

3689
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:39,230
he does is like let's scramble that
order that's three things the root and

3690
01:07:39,230 --> 01:07:39,240
order that's three things the root and
 

3691
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,390
order that's three things the root and
the The Head and the two dependents and

3692
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:41,400
the The Head and the two dependents and
 

3693
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,510
the The Head and the two dependents and
in just some random order just random

3694
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:43,520
in just some random order just random
 

3695
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:44,789
in just some random order just random
and then just do that for all the

3696
01:07:44,789 --> 01:07:44,799
and then just do that for all the
 

3697
01:07:44,799 --> 01:07:46,670
and then just do that for all the
dependents down that for so now look do

3698
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:46,680
dependents down that for so now look do
 

3699
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,670
dependents down that for so now look do
it for the and whatever was two in dogs

01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:48,680
it for the and whatever was two in dogs
 

3701
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:50,750
it for the and whatever was two in dogs
and for uh in room and and that's you

3702
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:50,760
and for uh in room and and that's you
 

3703
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:52,109
and for uh in room and and that's you
know that's not it's a very short

3704
01:07:52,109 --> 01:07:52,119
know that's not it's a very short
 

3705
01:07:52,119 --> 01:07:54,150
know that's not it's a very short
sentence when sentences get longer and

3706
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:54,160
sentence when sentences get longer and
 

3707
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:56,430
sentence when sentences get longer and
you have more dependence there's more

3708
01:07:56,430 --> 01:07:56,440
you have more dependence there's more
 

3709
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,470
you have more dependence there's more
scrambling that's possible and what he

3710
01:07:58,470 --> 01:07:58,480
scrambling that's possible and what he
 

3711
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,670
scrambling that's possible and what he
found was so that so so that that's one

3712
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:00,680
found was so that so so that that's one
 

3713
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:02,109
found was so that so so that that's one
you could figure out one scrambling for

3714
01:08:02,109 --> 01:08:02,119
you could figure out one scrambling for
 

3715
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:04,150
you could figure out one scrambling for
that sentence he did like 100 times for

3716
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:04,160
that sentence he did like 100 times for
 

3717
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,269
that sentence he did like 100 times for
every sentence in every Cor in every one

3718
01:08:06,269 --> 01:08:06,279
every sentence in every Cor in every one
 

3719
01:08:06,279 --> 01:08:09,390
every sentence in every Cor in every one
of these texts every Corpus and and then

3720
01:08:09,390 --> 01:08:09,400
of these texts every Corpus and and then
 

3721
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,910
of these texts every Corpus and and then
he just compared the dependency lengths

3722
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:11,920
he just compared the dependency lengths
 

3723
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,549
he just compared the dependency lengths
in those random scrambling to what

3724
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:14,559
in those random scrambling to what
 

3725
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:16,229
in those random scrambling to what
actually happen what what the the

3726
01:08:16,229 --> 01:08:16,239
actually happen what what the the
 

3727
01:08:16,239 --> 01:08:18,430
actually happen what what the the
English or the French or the German was

3728
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:18,440
English or the French or the German was
 

3729
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:19,829
English or the French or the German was
in the in original language or Chinese

3730
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:19,839
in the in original language or Chinese
 

3731
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:21,510
in the in original language or Chinese
or what are all these like 80 l no 60

3732
01:08:21,510 --> 01:08:21,520
or what are all these like 80 l no 60
 

3733
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,510
or what are all these like 80 l no 60
languages okay and and the dependency

3734
01:08:23,510 --> 01:08:23,520
languages okay and and the dependency
 

3735
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,070
languages okay and and the dependency
lengths are always shorter in the real

3736
01:08:25,070 --> 01:08:25,080
lengths are always shorter in the real
 

3737
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:27,669
lengths are always shorter in the real
language compared to this kind of a

3738
01:08:27,669 --> 01:08:27,679
language compared to this kind of a
 

3739
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:30,550
language compared to this kind of a
control and there's another it's a

3740
01:08:30,550 --> 01:08:30,560
control and there's another it's a
 

3741
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:34,189
control and there's another it's a
little more rigid his control so um the

3742
01:08:34,189 --> 01:08:34,199
little more rigid his control so um the
 

3743
01:08:34,199 --> 01:08:37,349
little more rigid his control so um the
the way I described it you could have

3744
01:08:37,349 --> 01:08:37,359
the way I described it you could have
 

3745
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:39,789
the way I described it you could have
crossed dependencies like by by

3746
01:08:39,789 --> 01:08:39,799
crossed dependencies like by by
 

3747
01:08:39,799 --> 01:08:41,030
crossed dependencies like by by
scrambling that way you could scramble

3748
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:41,040
scrambling that way you could scramble
 

3749
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,550
scrambling that way you could scramble
in any way at all um languages don't do

3750
01:08:43,550 --> 01:08:43,560
in any way at all um languages don't do
 

3751
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,749
in any way at all um languages don't do
that they tend not to cross dependencies

3752
01:08:45,749 --> 01:08:45,759
that they tend not to cross dependencies
 

3753
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:47,189
that they tend not to cross dependencies
very much like so the dependency

3754
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:47,199
very much like so the dependency
 

3755
01:08:47,199 --> 01:08:48,789
very much like so the dependency
structure they just they tend to keep

3756
01:08:48,789 --> 01:08:48,799
structure they just they tend to keep
 

3757
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:51,470
structure they just they tend to keep
things uh non-cross and there's a you

3758
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:51,480
things uh non-cross and there's a you
 

3759
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:53,189
things uh non-cross and there's a you
know there's a technical term they call

3760
01:08:53,189 --> 01:08:53,199
know there's a technical term they call
 

3761
01:08:53,199 --> 01:08:54,910
know there's a technical term they call
that projective but it's just non-cross

3762
01:08:54,910 --> 01:08:54,920
that projective but it's just non-cross
 

3763
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:57,269
that projective but it's just non-cross
is all that is projective and so if you

3764
01:08:57,269 --> 01:08:57,279
is all that is projective and so if you
 

3765
01:08:57,279 --> 01:08:57,990
is all that is projective and so if you
just

3766
01:08:57,990 --> 01:08:58,000
just
 

3767
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,510
just
constrain the the scrambling so that it

3768
01:09:00,510 --> 01:09:00,520
constrain the the scrambling so that it
 

3769
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:02,110
constrain the the scrambling so that it
only gives you projective sort of non

3770
01:09:02,110 --> 01:09:02,120
only gives you projective sort of non
 

3771
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:04,269
only gives you projective sort of non
non-cross the same thing holds so it's

3772
01:09:04,269 --> 01:09:04,279
non-cross the same thing holds so it's
 

3773
01:09:04,279 --> 01:09:06,430
non-cross the same thing holds so it's
so the You Still Still Human languages

3774
01:09:06,430 --> 01:09:06,440
so the You Still Still Human languages
 

3775
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:09,870
so the You Still Still Human languages
are much shorter uh than these this kind

3776
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:09,880
are much shorter uh than these this kind
 

3777
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:11,709
are much shorter uh than these this kind
of a control so there's like it what it

3778
01:09:11,709 --> 01:09:11,719
of a control so there's like it what it
 

3779
01:09:11,719 --> 01:09:13,630
of a control so there's like it what it
means is that that that we're in every

3780
01:09:13,630 --> 01:09:13,640
means is that that that we're in every
 

3781
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,550
means is that that that we're in every
language we're trying to put things

3782
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:15,560
language we're trying to put things
 

3783
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:18,030
language we're trying to put things
close in relative to this kind of a

3784
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:18,040
close in relative to this kind of a
 

3785
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:19,669
close in relative to this kind of a
control like it doesn't matter about the

3786
01:09:19,669 --> 01:09:19,679
control like it doesn't matter about the
 

3787
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:21,229
control like it doesn't matter about the
word order some of these are verb final

3788
01:09:21,229 --> 01:09:21,239
word order some of these are verb final
 

3789
01:09:21,239 --> 01:09:22,950
word order some of these are verb final
some of them these are verb medial like

3790
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:22,960
some of them these are verb medial like
 

3791
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,870
some of them these are verb medial like
English and some are even verb initial

3792
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:24,880
English and some are even verb initial
 

3793
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,349
English and some are even verb initial
there are a few languages of the world

3794
01:09:26,349 --> 01:09:26,359
there are a few languages of the world
 

3795
01:09:26,359 --> 01:09:29,189
there are a few languages of the world
which have vso world word order verb

3796
01:09:29,189 --> 01:09:29,199
which have vso world word order verb
 

3797
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:31,149
which have vso world word order verb
subject object languages haven't talked

3798
01:09:31,149 --> 01:09:31,159
subject object languages haven't talked
 

3799
01:09:31,159 --> 01:09:34,189
subject object languages haven't talked
about those it's like 10% of the and

3800
01:09:34,189 --> 01:09:34,199
about those it's like 10% of the and
 

3801
01:09:34,199 --> 01:09:36,390
about those it's like 10% of the and
even even in those languages it's still

3802
01:09:36,390 --> 01:09:36,400
even even in those languages it's still
 

3803
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,590
even even in those languages it's still
short dependencies short dependencies is

3804
01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:38,600
short dependencies short dependencies is
 

3805
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:41,590
short dependencies short dependencies is
rules okay so how what what are some

3806
01:09:41,590 --> 01:09:41,600
rules okay so how what what are some
 

3807
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,390
rules okay so how what what are some
possible explanations for that uh for

3808
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:44,400
possible explanations for that uh for
 

3809
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:47,030
possible explanations for that uh for
why why languages have evolved that way

3810
01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:47,040
why why languages have evolved that way
 

3811
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:50,110
why why languages have evolved that way
so that that's one of the um I suppose

3812
01:09:50,110 --> 01:09:50,120
so that that's one of the um I suppose
 

3813
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:51,749
so that that's one of the um I suppose
disagreements you might have with

3814
01:09:51,749 --> 01:09:51,759
disagreements you might have with
 

3815
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:53,870
disagreements you might have with
chowski so you consider the evolution of

3816
01:09:53,870 --> 01:09:53,880
chowski so you consider the evolution of
 

3817
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:56,830
chowski so you consider the evolution of
language in um in terms of information

3818
01:09:56,830 --> 01:09:56,840
language in um in terms of information
 

3819
01:09:56,840 --> 01:10:02,110
language in um in terms of information
Theory yeah and uh for you the purpose

3820
01:10:02,110 --> 01:10:02,120
Theory yeah and uh for you the purpose
 

3821
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:04,110
Theory yeah and uh for you the purpose
of language is ease of communication

3822
01:10:04,110 --> 01:10:04,120
of language is ease of communication
 

3823
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:06,030
of language is ease of communication
right and processing that's right that's

3824
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:06,040
right and processing that's right that's
 

3825
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,709
right and processing that's right that's
right so I mean the the story here is

3826
01:10:07,709 --> 01:10:07,719
right so I mean the the story here is
 

3827
01:10:07,719 --> 01:10:10,070
right so I mean the the story here is
just about communication it is just

3828
01:10:10,070 --> 01:10:10,080
just about communication it is just
 

3829
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,030
just about communication it is just
about production really it's about ease

3830
01:10:12,030 --> 01:10:12,040
about production really it's about ease
 

3831
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:14,310
about production really it's about ease
of production is the story when you say

3832
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:14,320
of production is the story when you say
 

3833
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:15,709
of production is the story when you say
production can you can oh I just mean

3834
01:10:15,709 --> 01:10:15,719
production can you can oh I just mean
 

3835
01:10:15,719 --> 01:10:17,229
production can you can oh I just mean
ease of language production it's easier

3836
01:10:17,229 --> 01:10:17,239
ease of language production it's easier
 

3837
01:10:17,239 --> 01:10:20,430
ease of language production it's easier
for me to say things when the what I'm

3838
01:10:20,430 --> 01:10:20,440
for me to say things when the what I'm
 

3839
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:21,950
for me to say things when the what I'm
doing whenever I'm talking to you is

3840
01:10:21,950 --> 01:10:21,960
doing whenever I'm talking to you is
 

3841
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:24,310
doing whenever I'm talking to you is
somehow I'm formulating some idea in my

3842
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:24,320
somehow I'm formulating some idea in my
 

3843
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,630
somehow I'm formulating some idea in my
head and I'm putting these words

3844
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:25,640
head and I'm putting these words
 

3845
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:27,830
head and I'm putting these words
together and it's easier for me to do

3846
01:10:27,830 --> 01:10:27,840
together and it's easier for me to do
 

3847
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:30,790
together and it's easier for me to do
that uh to put to say something where

3848
01:10:30,790 --> 01:10:30,800
that uh to put to say something where
 

3849
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,750
that uh to put to say something where
the words are close closely connected in

3850
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:32,760
the words are close closely connected in
 

3851
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:35,470
the words are close closely connected in
inde dependency as opposed to separated

3852
01:10:35,470 --> 01:10:35,480
inde dependency as opposed to separated
 

3853
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:37,430
inde dependency as opposed to separated
like by putting something in between and

3854
01:10:37,430 --> 01:10:37,440
like by putting something in between and
 

3855
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,149
like by putting something in between and
over and over again I it's just hard for

3856
01:10:39,149 --> 01:10:39,159
over and over again I it's just hard for
 

3857
01:10:39,159 --> 01:10:40,910
over and over again I it's just hard for
me to keep that in my head it like

3858
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:40,920
me to keep that in my head it like
 

3859
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:42,550
me to keep that in my head it like
that's that's the whole story like the

3860
01:10:42,550 --> 01:10:42,560
that's that's the whole story like the
 

3861
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,070
that's that's the whole story like the
story it's basically I like that the

3862
01:10:44,070 --> 01:10:44,080
story it's basically I like that the
 

3863
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:45,669
story it's basically I like that the
dependency grammar sort of gives that to

3864
01:10:45,669 --> 01:10:45,679
dependency grammar sort of gives that to
 

3865
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:48,630
dependency grammar sort of gives that to
you like just like long long as bad

3866
01:10:48,630 --> 01:10:48,640
you like just like long long as bad
 

3867
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:50,510
you like just like long long as bad
short as good it's like easier to keep

3868
01:10:50,510 --> 01:10:50,520
short as good it's like easier to keep
 

3869
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:51,870
short as good it's like easier to keep
in mind because you have to keep it in

3870
01:10:51,870 --> 01:10:51,880
in mind because you have to keep it in
 

3871
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:54,870
in mind because you have to keep it in
mind for probably for production Pro you

3872
01:10:54,870 --> 01:10:54,880
mind for probably for production Pro you
 

3873
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,830
mind for probably for production Pro you
know matters in comprehension as well

3874
01:10:56,830 --> 01:10:56,840
know matters in comprehension as well
 

3875
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:58,470
know matters in comprehension as well
like also matters in comprehension it's

3876
01:10:58,470 --> 01:10:58,480
like also matters in comprehension it's
 

3877
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,430
like also matters in comprehension it's
on both sides of the production and the

3878
01:11:00,430 --> 01:11:00,440
on both sides of the production and the
 

3879
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:01,870
on both sides of the production and the
but I would guess it's probably evolved

3880
01:11:01,870 --> 01:11:01,880
but I would guess it's probably evolved
 

3881
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:03,750
but I would guess it's probably evolved
for production it's about producing it's

3882
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:03,760
for production it's about producing it's
 

3883
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,750
for production it's about producing it's
right what's easier for me to say that

3884
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:05,760
right what's easier for me to say that
 

3885
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,790
right what's easier for me to say that
ends up being easier for you also I

3886
01:11:07,790 --> 01:11:07,800
ends up being easier for you also I
 

3887
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,910
ends up being easier for you also I
that's very hard to disentangle this

3888
01:11:09,910 --> 01:11:09,920
that's very hard to disentangle this
 

3889
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:12,070
that's very hard to disentangle this
idea of who's it for is it for me the

3890
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:12,080
idea of who's it for is it for me the
 

3891
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:14,229
idea of who's it for is it for me the
speaker or is it for you the listener I

3892
01:11:14,229 --> 01:11:14,239
speaker or is it for you the listener I
 

3893
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:16,550
speaker or is it for you the listener I
mean part of my language is for you like

3894
01:11:16,550 --> 01:11:16,560
mean part of my language is for you like
 

3895
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,790
mean part of my language is for you like
the way I talk to you is going to be

3896
01:11:18,790 --> 01:11:18,800
the way I talk to you is going to be
 

3897
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,350
the way I talk to you is going to be
different from how I talk to different

3898
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:20,360
different from how I talk to different
 

3899
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:22,189
different from how I talk to different
people so I'm I'm definitely angling

3900
01:11:22,189 --> 01:11:22,199
people so I'm I'm definitely angling
 

3901
01:11:22,199 --> 01:11:24,510
people so I'm I'm definitely angling
what I'm saying to who I'm saying right

3902
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:24,520
what I'm saying to who I'm saying right
 

3903
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:26,669
what I'm saying to who I'm saying right
it's not like I'm is talking the same

3904
01:11:26,669 --> 01:11:26,679
it's not like I'm is talking the same
 

3905
01:11:26,679 --> 01:11:29,350
it's not like I'm is talking the same
way to every single person and so I am

3906
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:29,360
way to every single person and so I am
 

3907
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:32,310
way to every single person and so I am
sensitive to my audience but how does

3908
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:32,320
sensitive to my audience but how does
 

3909
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,750
sensitive to my audience but how does
that does that you know work itself out

3910
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:34,760
that does that you know work itself out
 

3911
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:37,030
that does that you know work itself out
in the in the dependency length

3912
01:11:37,030 --> 01:11:37,040
in the in the dependency length
 

3913
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,350
in the in the dependency length
differences I don't know maybe that's

3914
01:11:38,350 --> 01:11:38,360
differences I don't know maybe that's
 

3915
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,030
differences I don't know maybe that's
about just the words that part you know

3916
01:11:40,030 --> 01:11:40,040
about just the words that part you know
 

3917
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,669
about just the words that part you know
which words I select my initial

3918
01:11:41,669 --> 01:11:41,679
which words I select my initial
 

3919
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:44,590
which words I select my initial
intuition is that you optimize language

3920
01:11:44,590 --> 01:11:44,600
intuition is that you optimize language
 

3921
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:48,030
intuition is that you optimize language
for the audience yeah but it's both it's

3922
01:11:48,030 --> 01:11:48,040
for the audience yeah but it's both it's
 

3923
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:49,390
for the audience yeah but it's both it's
just kind of like messing with my head a

3924
01:11:49,390 --> 01:11:49,400
just kind of like messing with my head a
 

3925
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,590
just kind of like messing with my head a
little bit to say that some of the

3926
01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:51,600
little bit to say that some of the
 

3927
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,669
little bit to say that some of the
optimization might be it may be the

3928
01:11:53,669 --> 01:11:53,679
optimization might be it may be the
 

3929
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:55,390
optimization might be it may be the
primary objective of the optimization

3930
01:11:55,390 --> 01:11:55,400
primary objective of the optimization
 

3931
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:57,709
primary objective of the optimization
might be the ease of production we have

3932
01:11:57,709 --> 01:11:57,719
might be the ease of production we have
 

3933
01:11:57,719 --> 01:12:00,070
might be the ease of production we have
different senses I guess I'm I'm like

3934
01:12:00,070 --> 01:12:00,080
different senses I guess I'm I'm like
 

3935
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,110
different senses I guess I'm I'm like
very

3936
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:01,120
very
 

3937
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:03,590
very
selfish and you're I'm like I think it's

3938
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:03,600
selfish and you're I'm like I think it's
 

3939
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:04,990
selfish and you're I'm like I think it's
like it's all about me I'm like I'm just

3940
01:12:04,990 --> 01:12:05,000
like it's all about me I'm like I'm just
 

3941
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,189
like it's all about me I'm like I'm just
doing what's easiest for me at all I

3942
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:07,199
doing what's easiest for me at all I
 

3943
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:09,229
doing what's easiest for me at all I
don't want to I'm like I'll I mean but I

3944
01:12:09,229 --> 01:12:09,239
don't want to I'm like I'll I mean but I
 

3945
01:12:09,239 --> 01:12:11,910
don't want to I'm like I'll I mean but I
have to of course choose the words that

3946
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:11,920
have to of course choose the words that
 

3947
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:13,430
have to of course choose the words that
I think you're going to know I'm not

3948
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:13,440
I think you're going to know I'm not
 

3949
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:14,709
I think you're going to know I'm not
going to choose words you don't know in

3950
01:12:14,709 --> 01:12:14,719
going to choose words you don't know in
 

3951
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:16,189
going to choose words you don't know in
fact I'm going to fix that when I you

3952
01:12:16,189 --> 01:12:16,199
fact I'm going to fix that when I you
 

3953
01:12:16,199 --> 01:12:18,189
fact I'm going to fix that when I you
know so there it's about but but maybe

3954
01:12:18,189 --> 01:12:18,199
know so there it's about but but maybe
 

3955
01:12:18,199 --> 01:12:21,270
know so there it's about but but maybe
for for the Syntax for the combinations

3956
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:21,280
for for the Syntax for the combinations
 

3957
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,270
for for the Syntax for the combinations
it's just about me I feel like it's I

3958
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:23,280
it's just about me I feel like it's I
 

3959
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:25,189
it's just about me I feel like it's I
don't know though it's very wait wait

3960
01:12:25,189 --> 01:12:25,199
don't know though it's very wait wait
 

3961
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:27,030
don't know though it's very wait wait
purpose of communication is to be

3962
01:12:27,030 --> 01:12:27,040
purpose of communication is to be
 

3963
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:28,950
purpose of communication is to be
understood is to convince others and so

3964
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:28,960
understood is to convince others and so
 

3965
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:31,590
understood is to convince others and so
on so like the selfish thing is to be

3966
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:31,600
on so like the selfish thing is to be
 

3967
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,950
on so like the selfish thing is to be
understood it's about circular there too

3968
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:33,960
understood it's about circular there too
 

3969
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:36,189
understood it's about circular there too
then okay right I mean like the use of

3970
01:12:36,189 --> 01:12:36,199
then okay right I mean like the use of
 

3971
01:12:36,199 --> 01:12:39,470
then okay right I mean like the use of
production helps helps me be understood

3972
01:12:39,470 --> 01:12:39,480
production helps helps me be understood
 

3973
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:42,430
production helps helps me be understood
then I don't think it's circular so I I

3974
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:42,440
then I don't think it's circular so I I
 

3975
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:44,149
then I don't think it's circular so I I
think the primary I think the primary

3976
01:12:44,149 --> 01:12:44,159
think the primary I think the primary
 

3977
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:45,790
think the primary I think the primary
objective is to be UND is about the

3978
01:12:45,790 --> 01:12:45,800
objective is to be UND is about the
 

3979
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:48,310
objective is to be UND is about the
listener because otherwise if you're

3980
01:12:48,310 --> 01:12:48,320
listener because otherwise if you're
 

3981
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,350
listener because otherwise if you're
optimizing to for the ease of production

3982
01:12:50,350 --> 01:12:50,360
optimizing to for the ease of production
 

3983
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:52,270
optimizing to for the ease of production
then you're you're not going to have any

3984
01:12:52,270 --> 01:12:52,280
then you're you're not going to have any
 

3985
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:53,430
then you're you're not going to have any
of the interesting complexity of

3986
01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:53,440
of the interesting complexity of
 

3987
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,750
of the interesting complexity of
language like you're trying

3988
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:55,760
language like you're trying
 

3989
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:57,270
language like you're trying
let's control for what it is I want to

3990
01:12:57,270 --> 01:12:57,280
let's control for what it is I want to
 

3991
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,629
let's control for what it is I want to
say like I I'm saying let's control for

3992
01:12:59,629 --> 01:12:59,639
say like I I'm saying let's control for
 

3993
01:12:59,639 --> 01:13:01,550
say like I I'm saying let's control for
the thing the the message control for

3994
01:13:01,550 --> 01:13:01,560
the thing the the message control for
 

3995
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,350
the thing the the message control for
the message the message needs to be

3996
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:03,360
the message the message needs to be
 

3997
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,510
the message the message needs to be
understood that's the goal oh but that's

3998
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:05,520
understood that's the goal oh but that's
 

3999
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:06,709
understood that's the goal oh but that's
the meaning so I'm still talking about

4000
01:13:06,709 --> 01:13:06,719
the meaning so I'm still talking about
 

4001
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:09,629
the meaning so I'm still talking about
the form just the form of the meaning

4002
01:13:09,629 --> 01:13:09,639
the form just the form of the meaning
 

4003
01:13:09,639 --> 01:13:11,870
the form just the form of the meaning
how do I frame the form of the meaning

4004
01:13:11,870 --> 01:13:11,880
how do I frame the form of the meaning
 

4005
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:13,189
how do I frame the form of the meaning
is all I'm talking about you're talking

4006
01:13:13,189 --> 01:13:13,199
is all I'm talking about you're talking
 

4007
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:14,790
is all I'm talking about you're talking
about a harder thing I think is like how

4008
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:14,800
about a harder thing I think is like how
 

4009
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,390
about a harder thing I think is like how
am I like trying to change the let's

4010
01:13:17,390 --> 01:13:17,400
am I like trying to change the let's
 

4011
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,990
am I like trying to change the let's
let's keep the meaning constant like

4012
01:13:19,990 --> 01:13:20,000
let's keep the meaning constant like
 

4013
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,590
let's keep the meaning constant like
which it if you keep the meaning

4014
01:13:21,590 --> 01:13:21,600
which it if you keep the meaning
 

4015
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,270
which it if you keep the meaning
constant how can I phrase whatever it is

4016
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:24,280
constant how can I phrase whatever it is
 

4017
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:25,709
constant how can I phrase whatever it is
I need to say

4018
01:13:25,709 --> 01:13:25,719
I need to say
 

4019
01:13:25,719 --> 01:13:27,310
I need to say
like I got to pick the right words and

4020
01:13:27,310 --> 01:13:27,320
like I got to pick the right words and
 

4021
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:29,430
like I got to pick the right words and
I'm going to pick the order so that it's

4022
01:13:29,430 --> 01:13:29,440
I'm going to pick the order so that it's
 

4023
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:31,430
I'm going to pick the order so that it's
so it's easy for me that's that's that's

4024
01:13:31,430 --> 01:13:31,440
so it's easy for me that's that's that's
 

4025
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:32,910
so it's easy for me that's that's that's
that's what I think Isa I think I'm

4026
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:32,920
that's what I think Isa I think I'm
 

4027
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:35,189
that's what I think Isa I think I'm
still tying meaning and

4028
01:13:35,189 --> 01:13:35,199
still tying meaning and
 

4029
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:38,070
still tying meaning and
form together in my head but you're

4030
01:13:38,070 --> 01:13:38,080
form together in my head but you're
 

4031
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,950
form together in my head but you're
saying if you keep the meaning of what

4032
01:13:39,950 --> 01:13:39,960
saying if you keep the meaning of what
 

4033
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:42,189
saying if you keep the meaning of what
you're saying constant yeah what the

4034
01:13:42,189 --> 01:13:42,199
you're saying constant yeah what the
 

4035
01:13:42,199 --> 01:13:44,270
you're saying constant yeah what the
optimization yeah it could be the

4036
01:13:44,270 --> 01:13:44,280
optimization yeah it could be the
 

4037
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:46,189
optimization yeah it could be the
primary objective of that optimization

4038
01:13:46,189 --> 01:13:46,199
primary objective of that optimization
 

4039
01:13:46,199 --> 01:13:50,070
primary objective of that optimization
is the for production that's interesting

4040
01:13:50,070 --> 01:13:50,080
is the for production that's interesting
 

4041
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:52,910
is the for production that's interesting
I'm I'm struggling to keep constant

4042
01:13:52,910 --> 01:13:52,920
I'm I'm struggling to keep constant
 

4043
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:55,510
I'm I'm struggling to keep constant
meaning it's just so I mean I'm I'm such

4044
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:55,520
meaning it's just so I mean I'm I'm such
 

4045
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:59,110
meaning it's just so I mean I'm I'm such
a I'm a human right so for me the form

4046
01:13:59,110 --> 01:13:59,120
a I'm a human right so for me the form
 

4047
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,470
a I'm a human right so for me the form
without having

4048
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:00,480
without having
 

4049
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,990
without having
introspected on this the form and the

4050
01:14:02,990 --> 01:14:03,000
introspected on this the form and the
 

4051
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,510
introspected on this the form and the
meaning are tied together like

4052
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:06,520
meaning are tied together like
 

4053
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:09,669
meaning are tied together like
deeply because I'm a human like for for

4054
01:14:09,669 --> 01:14:09,679
deeply because I'm a human like for for
 

4055
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:11,550
deeply because I'm a human like for for
me what I'm speaking cuz I haven't

4056
01:14:11,550 --> 01:14:11,560

thought about language like in a

4058
01:14:13,870 --> 01:14:13,880
thought about language like in a
 

4059
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,310
thought about language like in a
rigorous way about the form of language

4060
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:16,320
rigorous way about the form of language
 

4061
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:19,110
rigorous way about the form of language
look for any

4062
01:14:19,110 --> 01:14:19,120
look for any
 

4063
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:22,590
look for any
event there's there's an an unbounded I

4064
01:14:22,590 --> 01:14:22,600
event there's there's an an unbounded I
 

4065
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:23,950
event there's there's an an unbounded I
I don't want to say infinite but sort of

4066
01:14:23,950 --> 01:14:23,960
I don't want to say infinite but sort of
 

4067
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,470
I don't want to say infinite but sort of
Unbound you know ways of that I might

4068
01:14:25,470 --> 01:14:25,480
Unbound you know ways of that I might
 

4069
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:27,110
Unbound you know ways of that I might
communicate that same event this two

4070
01:14:27,110 --> 01:14:27,120
communicate that same event this two
 

4071
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,669
communicate that same event this two
dogs entered a room I can say in many

4072
01:14:29,669 --> 01:14:29,679
dogs entered a room I can say in many
 

4073
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:31,189

I mean there's I mean it's kind of
 

4083
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:40,910
I mean there's I mean it's kind of
awkward and weird and stuff but those

4084
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:40,920
awkward and weird and stuff but those
 

4085
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:43,070
awkward and weird and stuff but those
are all similar

4086
01:14:43,070 --> 01:14:43,080
are all similar
 

4087
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:45,910
are all similar
messages with different forms but

4088
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:45,920
messages with different forms but
 

4089
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,350
messages with different forms but
different ways I might frame and of

4090
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:47,360
different ways I might frame and of
 

4091
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,430
different ways I might frame and of
course I use the same words there all

4092
01:14:49,430 --> 01:14:49,440
course I use the same words there all
 

4093
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,030
course I use the same words there all
the time I could have referred to the

4094
01:14:51,030 --> 01:14:51,040
the time I could have referred to the
 

4095
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,149

have been more specific or less specific
 

4101
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:57,669
have been more specific or less specific
about what they are and I could have

4102

about what they are and I could have
 

4103
01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:00,189
about what they are and I could have
said been more abstract about about

4104
01:15:00,189 --> 01:15:00,199
said been more abstract about about
 

4105
01:15:00,199 --> 01:15:02,110

I'm trying to keep the meaning which is

4108
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:03,920
I'm trying to keep the meaning which is
 

4109
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:07,110
I'm trying to keep the meaning which is
this event constant and then how am I

4110
01:15:07,110 --> 01:15:07,120
this event constant and then how am I
 

4111
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:08,550
this event constant and then how am I
going to describe that to get that to

4112
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:08,560
going to describe that to get that to
 

4113
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:09,709
going to describe that to get that to
you it kind of depends on what you need

4114
01:15:09,709 --> 01:15:09,719
you it kind of depends on what you need
 

4115
01:15:09,719 --> 01:15:11,470
you it kind of depends on what you need
to know right and what I think you need

4116
01:15:11,470 --> 01:15:11,480
to know right and what I think you need
 

4117
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:13,430
to know right and what I think you need
to know but I'm like trying let's

4118
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:13,440
to know but I'm like trying let's
 

4119
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:16,110
to know but I'm like trying let's
control for all that stuff and not and

4120
01:15:16,110 --> 01:15:16,120
control for all that stuff and not and
 

4121
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:18,070
control for all that stuff and not and
it's like I'm just like choosing about

4122
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:18,080
it's like I'm just like choosing about
 

4123
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,350
it's like I'm just like choosing about
I'm doing something simpler than you're

4124

I'm doing something simpler than you're
 

4125
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:22,310
I'm doing something simpler than you're
doing which is just forms yes just words

4126
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:22,320
doing which is just forms yes just words

not is changing the meaning that might
 

4133
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:31,910
not is changing the meaning that might
be yeah yeah that would be Chang well

4134
01:15:31,910 --> 01:15:31,920
be yeah yeah that would be Chang well
 

4135
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:32,990

that would be changing the meaning for

4136
01:15:32,990 --> 01:15:33,000
that would be changing the meaning for
 

4137
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,149
that would be changing the meaning for
sure right so you're just yeah well yeah

yeah that's changing the meaning but say
 

4141
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,110
yeah that's changing the meaning but say
even if we keep that constant we can

4142
01:15:40,110 --> 01:15:40,120
even if we keep that constant we can
 

4143
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:41,790
even if we keep that constant we can
still talk about what's easy or hard for

4144
01:15:41,790 --> 01:15:41,800
still talk about what's easy or hard for
 

4145

right which phrase structures I use
 

4149
01:15:47,159 --> 01:15:49,110
right which phrase structures I use
which combinations which you know this

4150
01:15:49,110 --> 01:15:49,120
which combinations which you know this
 

4151
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:52,590
which combinations which you know this
is so fascinating and just like a uh a

4152

is so fascinating and just like a uh a
 

4153
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,550
is so fascinating and just like a uh a
really powerful window into human

01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:58,030
language
but I wonder still throughout

4158
01:15:58,030 --> 01:15:58,040
but I wonder still throughout
 

4159
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:01,070
but I wonder still throughout
this how vast the gap between meaning

4160
01:16:01,070 --> 01:16:01,080
this how vast the gap between meaning
 

4161
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:04,709
this how vast the gap between meaning
and form I just I just have this like

4162
01:16:04,709 --> 01:16:04,719
and form I just I just have this like
 

4163
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:06,629
and form I just I just have this like
maybe romanticized notion that they're

4164
01:16:06,629 --> 01:16:06,639
maybe romanticized notion that they're
 

4165
01:16:06,639 --> 01:16:08,950
maybe romanticized notion that they're
close together that they evolve close

4166
01:16:08,950 --> 01:16:08,960
close together that they evolve close
 

4167
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:11,510
close together that they evolve close
like hand in hand that you can't just

4168
01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:11,520
like hand in hand that you can't just
 

4169
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:14,750
like hand in hand that you can't just
simply optimize for one without the

4170
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:14,760
simply optimize for one without the
 

4171
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:17,270
simply optimize for one without the
other being in the room with

4172
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:17,280
other being in the room with
 

4173
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,990
other being in the room with
us like it's well it's kind of like an

4174
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:20,000
us like it's well it's kind of like an
 

4175
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,910
us like it's well it's kind of like an
iceberg form is the tip of the iceberg

4176
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:21,920
iceberg form is the tip of the iceberg
 

4177
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,870
iceberg form is the tip of the iceberg
and the rest the the meaning is the

4178
01:16:23,870 --> 01:16:23,880
and the rest the the meaning is the
 

4179
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:26,270
and the rest the the meaning is the
iceberg but you can't like sep but I

4180
01:16:26,270 --> 01:16:26,280
iceberg but you can't like sep but I
 

4181
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,830
iceberg but you can't like sep but I
think that's why these large language

4182
01:16:28,830 --> 01:16:28,840
think that's why these large language
 

4183
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:30,470
think that's why these large language
models are so successful is because

4184
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:30,480
models are so successful is because
 

4185
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:31,950
models are so successful is because
they're good at form and form isn't that

4186
01:16:31,950 --> 01:16:31,960
they're good at form and form isn't that
 

4187
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:34,870
they're good at form and form isn't that
hard it's some sense and meaning is

4188
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:34,880
hard it's some sense and meaning is
 

4189
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,669
hard it's some sense and meaning is
tough still and that's why they're not

4190
01:16:36,669 --> 01:16:36,679
tough still and that's why they're not
 

4191
01:16:36,679 --> 01:16:37,950
tough still and that's why they're not
they're you know they don't understand

4192
01:16:37,950 --> 01:16:37,960
they're you know they don't understand
 

4193
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:38,910
they're you know they don't understand
what they're do we're going to talk

4194
01:16:38,910 --> 01:16:38,920
what they're do we're going to talk
 

4195
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:41,070
what they're do we're going to talk
about that later maybe but uh like we

4196
01:16:41,070 --> 01:16:41,080
about that later maybe but uh like we
 

4197
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:42,030
about that later maybe but uh like we
can

4198
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:42,040
can
 

4199
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:44,270
can
distinguish in our forget about large

4200
01:16:44,270 --> 01:16:44,280
distinguish in our forget about large
 

4201
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:46,229
distinguish in our forget about large
language models like humans maybe you'll

4202
01:16:46,229 --> 01:16:46,239
language models like humans maybe you'll
 

4203
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:47,750
language models like humans maybe you'll
talk about that later too is like the

4204
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:47,760
talk about that later too is like the
 

4205
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,629
talk about that later too is like the
difference between language which is a

4206
01:16:50,629 --> 01:16:50,639
difference between language which is a
 

4207
01:16:50,639 --> 01:16:52,669
difference between language which is a
communication system and thinking which

4208
01:16:52,669 --> 01:16:52,679
communication system and thinking which
 

4209
01:16:52,679 --> 01:16:55,550
communication system and thinking which
is meaning so language is a communic

4210
01:16:55,550 --> 01:16:55,560
is meaning so language is a communic
 

4211
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:57,950
is meaning so language is a communic
system for the meaning it's not the

4212
01:16:57,950 --> 01:16:57,960
system for the meaning it's not the
 

4213
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:00,110
system for the meaning it's not the
meaning and so that's why I mean that

4214
01:17:00,110 --> 01:17:00,120
meaning and so that's why I mean that
 

4215
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:01,629
meaning and so that's why I mean that
and there's a lot of interesting

4216
01:17:01,629 --> 01:17:01,639
and there's a lot of interesting
 

4217
01:17:01,639 --> 01:17:03,870
and there's a lot of interesting
evidence we can talk about re relevant

4218
01:17:03,870 --> 01:17:03,880
evidence we can talk about re relevant
 

4219
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:05,709
evidence we can talk about re relevant
to that well I mean that's a really

4220
01:17:05,709 --> 01:17:05,719
to that well I mean that's a really
 

4221
01:17:05,719 --> 01:17:07,669
to that well I mean that's a really
interesting question what is the differ

4222
01:17:07,669 --> 01:17:07,679
interesting question what is the differ
 

4223
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:10,350
interesting question what is the differ
what is the difference between uh

4224
01:17:10,350 --> 01:17:10,360
what is the difference between uh
 

4225
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:12,629
what is the difference between uh
language written

4226
01:17:12,629 --> 01:17:12,639
language written
 

4227
01:17:12,639 --> 01:17:15,030
language written
communicated versus

4228
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:15,040
communicated versus
 

4229
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:17,149
communicated versus
thought what do use the difference

4230
01:17:17,149 --> 01:17:17,159
thought what do use the difference
 

4231
01:17:17,159 --> 01:17:21,390
thought what do use the difference
between them well you or anyone has to

4232
01:17:21,390 --> 01:17:21,400
between them well you or anyone has to
 

4233
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,510
between them well you or anyone has to
think of a task which they think is is a

4234
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:23,520
think of a task which they think is is a
 

4235
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,870
think of a task which they think is is a
good thinking task and there's lots and

4236
01:17:25,870 --> 01:17:25,880
good thinking task and there's lots and
 

4237
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:26,990
good thinking task and there's lots and
lots of tasks which should be good

4238
01:17:26,990 --> 01:17:27,000
lots of tasks which should be good
 

4239
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,830
lots of tasks which should be good
thinking tasks and whatever those tasks

4240
01:17:29,830 --> 01:17:29,840
thinking tasks and whatever those tasks
 

4241
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,070
thinking tasks and whatever those tasks
are let's say it's you know playing

4242
01:17:31,070 --> 01:17:31,080
are let's say it's you know playing
 

4243
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:33,669
are let's say it's you know playing
chess or that's a good thinking task or

4244
01:17:33,669 --> 01:17:33,679
chess or that's a good thinking task or
 

4245
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:35,629
chess or that's a good thinking task or
playing some game or doing some complex

4246
01:17:35,629 --> 01:17:35,639
playing some game or doing some complex
 

4247
01:17:35,639 --> 01:17:39,030
playing some game or doing some complex
puzzles uh maybe maybe remembering some

4248
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:39,040
puzzles uh maybe maybe remembering some
 

4249
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:41,070
puzzles uh maybe maybe remembering some
digits that's thinking remembering some

4250
01:17:41,070 --> 01:17:41,080
digits that's thinking remembering some
 

4251
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,510
digits that's thinking remembering some
a lot of different tasks we might think

4252
01:17:42,510 --> 01:17:42,520
a lot of different tasks we might think
 

4253
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:44,030
a lot of different tasks we might think
maybe just listening to music as

4254
01:17:44,030 --> 01:17:44,040
maybe just listening to music as
 

4255
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:45,629
maybe just listening to music as
thinking or there's a lot of different

4256
01:17:45,629 --> 01:17:45,639
thinking or there's a lot of different
 

4257
01:17:45,639 --> 01:17:47,590
thinking or there's a lot of different
tasks we might think of as thinking

4258
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:47,600
tasks we might think of as thinking
 

4259
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,149
tasks we might think of as thinking
there's this woman in my department at

4260
01:17:49,149 --> 01:17:49,159
there's this woman in my department at
 

4261
01:17:49,159 --> 01:17:51,030
there's this woman in my department at
federenko and she's done a lot of work

4262
01:17:51,030 --> 01:17:51,040
federenko and she's done a lot of work
 

4263
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:53,070
federenko and she's done a lot of work
at on on this question about what's the

4264
01:17:53,070 --> 01:17:53,080
at on on this question about what's the
 

4265
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:55,189
at on on this question about what's the
connection between language and thought

4266
01:17:55,189 --> 01:17:55,199
connection between language and thought
 

4267
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:57,189
connection between language and thought
and and so she uses I was referring

4268
01:17:57,189 --> 01:17:57,199
and and so she uses I was referring
 

4269
01:17:57,199 --> 01:17:59,629
and and so she uses I was referring
earlier to MRI fmri that's her primary

4270
01:17:59,629 --> 01:17:59,639
earlier to MRI fmri that's her primary
 

4271
01:17:59,639 --> 01:18:02,910
earlier to MRI fmri that's her primary
method and so she has been really

4272
01:18:02,910 --> 01:18:02,920
method and so she has been really
 

4273
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:04,669
method and so she has been really
fascinated by this question about

4274
01:18:04,669 --> 01:18:04,679
fascinated by this question about
 

4275
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:07,709
fascinated by this question about
whether what language is okay and so as

4276
01:18:07,709 --> 01:18:07,719
whether what language is okay and so as
 

4277
01:18:07,719 --> 01:18:10,950
whether what language is okay and so as
I mentioned earlier you can localize my

4278
01:18:10,950 --> 01:18:10,960
I mentioned earlier you can localize my
 

4279
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,430
I mentioned earlier you can localize my
language area your language area in a

4280
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:12,440
language area your language area in a
 

4281
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:14,110
language area your language area in a
few minutes okay like 15 minutes I can

4282
01:18:14,110 --> 01:18:14,120
few minutes okay like 15 minutes I can
 

4283
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,790
few minutes okay like 15 minutes I can
listen to language listen to non-

4284
01:18:15,790 --> 01:18:15,800
listen to language listen to non-
 

4285
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:18,189
listen to language listen to non-
language or backward speech or something

4286
01:18:18,189 --> 01:18:18,199
language or backward speech or something
 

4287
01:18:18,199 --> 01:18:20,110
language or backward speech or something
and and and we'll find areas left

4288
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:20,120
and and and we'll find areas left
 

4289
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:22,910
and and and we'll find areas left
lateralized Network in my head which is

4290
01:18:22,910 --> 01:18:22,920
lateralized Network in my head which is
 

4291
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:25,669
lateralized Network in my head which is
specially which is very sensitive to

4292
01:18:25,669 --> 01:18:25,679
specially which is very sensitive to
 

4293
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:27,189
specially which is very sensitive to
language as opposed to whatever that

4294
01:18:27,189 --> 01:18:27,199
language as opposed to whatever that
 

4295
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:28,910
language as opposed to whatever that
control was okay can't specify what you

4296
01:18:28,910 --> 01:18:28,920
control was okay can't specify what you
 

4297
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:30,310
control was okay can't specify what you
mean by language like communicated

4298
01:18:30,310 --> 01:18:30,320
mean by language like communicated
 

4299
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,550
mean by language like communicated
language like what is just sentences you

4300
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:32,560
language like what is just sentences you
 

4301
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,350
language like what is just sentences you
know I'm listening to English of any

4302
01:18:34,350 --> 01:18:34,360
know I'm listening to English of any
 

4303
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:36,390
know I'm listening to English of any
kind story or I can read sentences

4304
01:18:36,390 --> 01:18:36,400
kind story or I can read sentences
 

4305
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:38,390
kind story or I can read sentences
anything at all that I understand if I

4306
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:38,400
anything at all that I understand if I
 

4307
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,830
anything at all that I understand if I
understand it then it'll activate my

4308
01:18:40,830 --> 01:18:40,840
understand it then it'll activate my
 

4309
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:42,229
understand it then it'll activate my
language Network so right now my

4310
01:18:42,229 --> 01:18:42,239
language Network so right now my
 

4311
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:44,149
language Network so right now my
language network is going like crazy

4312
01:18:44,149 --> 01:18:44,159
language network is going like crazy
 

4313
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:45,669
language network is going like crazy
when I'm talking and when I'm listening

4314
01:18:45,669 --> 01:18:45,679
when I'm talking and when I'm listening
 

4315
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:47,910
when I'm talking and when I'm listening
to you because we're both we're

4316
01:18:47,910 --> 01:18:47,920
to you because we're both we're
 

4317
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:49,669
to you because we're both we're
communicating and that's pretty stable

4318
01:18:49,669 --> 01:18:49,679
communicating and that's pretty stable
 

4319
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:52,310
communicating and that's pretty stable
yeah it's incredibly stable so I've I I

4320
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:52,320
yeah it's incredibly stable so I've I I
 

4321
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:55,030
yeah it's incredibly stable so I've I I
happen to be married to this woman at

4322
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:55,040
happen to be married to this woman at
 

4323
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,790
happen to be married to this woman at
feno so I've been scanned by her over

4324
01:18:56,790 --> 01:18:56,800
feno so I've been scanned by her over
 

4325
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:59,030
feno so I've been scanned by her over
and over and over since 2007 or six or

4326
01:18:59,030 --> 01:18:59,040
and over and over since 2007 or six or
 

4327
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:01,030
and over and over since 2007 or six or
something and so my language network is

4328
01:19:01,030 --> 01:19:01,040
something and so my language network is
 

4329
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:03,470
something and so my language network is
exactly the same you know like a month

4330
01:19:03,470 --> 01:19:03,480
exactly the same you know like a month
 

4331
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:06,070
exactly the same you know like a month
ago as it was back in 2007 it's

4332
01:19:06,070 --> 01:19:06,080
ago as it was back in 2007 it's
 

4333
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,950
ago as it was back in 2007 it's
amazingly stable it's astounding within

4334
01:19:08,950 --> 01:19:08,960
amazingly stable it's astounding within
 

4335
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:11,310
amazingly stable it's astounding within
it's it's a really fundamentally cool

4336
01:19:11,310 --> 01:19:11,320
it's it's a really fundamentally cool
 

4337
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:13,430
it's it's a really fundamentally cool
thing and so my language network is it's

4338
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:13,440
thing and so my language network is it's
 

4339
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:15,870
thing and so my language network is it's
like my face okay it's not changing much

4340
01:19:15,870 --> 01:19:15,880
like my face okay it's not changing much
 

4341
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:17,629
like my face okay it's not changing much
over time inside my head can ask a quick

4342
01:19:17,629 --> 01:19:17,639
over time inside my head can ask a quick
 

4343
01:19:17,639 --> 01:19:19,990
over time inside my head can ask a quick
question Sor is a small tangent uh at

4344
01:19:19,990 --> 01:19:20,000
question Sor is a small tangent uh at
 

4345
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,110
question Sor is a small tangent uh at
which point in the as you grow up from

4346
01:19:23,110 --> 01:19:23,120
which point in the as you grow up from
 

4347
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:26,189
which point in the as you grow up from
baby to adult does it stabilize we don't

4348
01:19:26,189 --> 01:19:26,199
baby to adult does it stabilize we don't
 

4349
01:19:26,199 --> 01:19:28,070
baby to adult does it stabilize we don't
know like that's that's a very hard

4350
01:19:28,070 --> 01:19:28,080
know like that's that's a very hard
 

4351
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,390
know like that's that's a very hard
question they're working on that right

4352
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:29,400
question they're working on that right
 

4353
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:32,070
question they're working on that right
now because of the problem scanning

4354
01:19:32,070 --> 01:19:32,080
now because of the problem scanning
 

4355
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:34,270
now because of the problem scanning
little kids like doing the trying to do

4356
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:34,280
little kids like doing the trying to do
 

4357
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:36,550
little kids like doing the trying to do
local trying to do the the localization

4358
01:19:36,550 --> 01:19:36,560
local trying to do the the localization
 

4359
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:38,910
local trying to do the the localization
on little children in this scanner

4360
01:19:38,910 --> 01:19:38,920
on little children in this scanner
 

4361
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:40,950
on little children in this scanner
you're lying in the fmri scan that's the

4362
01:19:40,950 --> 01:19:40,960
you're lying in the fmri scan that's the
 

4363
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:42,310
you're lying in the fmri scan that's the
best way to figure out where something's

4364
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:42,320
best way to figure out where something's
 

4365
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:44,470
best way to figure out where something's
going on inside our brains and the

4366
01:19:44,470 --> 01:19:44,480
going on inside our brains and the
 

4367
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,189
going on inside our brains and the
scanner is loud and you're in this tiny

4368
01:19:46,189 --> 01:19:46,199
scanner is loud and you're in this tiny
 

4369
01:19:46,199 --> 01:19:47,629
scanner is loud and you're in this tiny
little com you know area you're

4370
01:19:47,629 --> 01:19:47,639
little com you know area you're
 

4371
01:19:47,639 --> 01:19:49,750
little com you know area you're
claustrophobic and it doesn't bother me

4372
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:49,760
claustrophobic and it doesn't bother me
 

4373
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:51,510
claustrophobic and it doesn't bother me
at all I can go to sleep in there but

4374
01:19:51,510 --> 01:19:51,520
at all I can go to sleep in there but
 

4375
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,350
at all I can go to sleep in there but
some people are bothered by it and

4376
01:19:53,350 --> 01:19:53,360
some people are bothered by it and
 

4377
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:54,430
some people are bothered by it and
little kids don't really like it and

4378
01:19:54,430 --> 01:19:54,440
little kids don't really like it and
 

4379
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:55,910
little kids don't really like it and
they like to lie still and you have to

4380
01:19:55,910 --> 01:19:55,920
they like to lie still and you have to
 

4381
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:57,430
they like to lie still and you have to
be really still because if you move

4382
01:19:57,430 --> 01:19:57,440
be really still because if you move
 

4383
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:59,229
be really still because if you move
around that's that messes up the

4384
01:19:59,229 --> 01:19:59,239
around that's that messes up the
 

4385
01:19:59,239 --> 01:20:00,910
around that's that messes up the
coordinates of where where everything is

4386
01:20:00,910 --> 01:20:00,920
coordinates of where where everything is
 

4387
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:03,030
coordinates of where where everything is
and so you know try to get you know your

4388
01:20:03,030 --> 01:20:03,040
and so you know try to get you know your
 

4389
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:05,430
and so you know try to get you know your
question is how and when are language

4390
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:05,440
question is how and when are language
 

4391
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:07,590
question is how and when are language
developing you know how when how does

4392
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:07,600
developing you know how when how does
 

4393
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,030
developing you know how when how does
this left lateralized system come to

4394
01:20:09,030 --> 01:20:09,040
this left lateralized system come to
 

4395
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:10,830
this left lateralized system come to
play where's it you know and it's really

4396
01:20:10,830 --> 01:20:10,840
play where's it you know and it's really
 

4397
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:12,149
play where's it you know and it's really
hard to get a two-year-old to do this

4398
01:20:12,149 --> 01:20:12,159
hard to get a two-year-old to do this
 

4399
01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:13,870
hard to get a two-year-old to do this
task but you can maybe where they're

4400
01:20:13,870 --> 01:20:13,880
task but you can maybe where they're
 

4401
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:15,270
task but you can maybe where they're
starting to get three and four and

4402
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:15,280
starting to get three and four and
 

4403
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:17,149
starting to get three and four and
fiveyear olds to do this task for short

4404
01:20:17,149 --> 01:20:17,159
fiveyear olds to do this task for short
 

4405
01:20:17,159 --> 01:20:18,910
fiveyear olds to do this task for short
periods and it looks like it's there

4406
01:20:18,910 --> 01:20:18,920
periods and it looks like it's there
 

4407
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:21,030
periods and it looks like it's there
pretty early so clearly when you lead up

4408
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:21,040
pretty early so clearly when you lead up
 

4409
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,629
pretty early so clearly when you lead up
to like a baby's first

4410
01:20:23,629 --> 01:20:23,639
to like a baby's first
 

4411
01:20:23,639 --> 01:20:26,149
to like a baby's first
words before that there's a lot of

4412
01:20:26,149 --> 01:20:26,159
words before that there's a lot of
 

4413
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:28,229
words before that there's a lot of
fascinating turmoil going on about like

4414
01:20:28,229 --> 01:20:28,239
fascinating turmoil going on about like
 

4415
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:31,270
fascinating turmoil going on about like
figuring out like what is what are these

4416
01:20:31,270 --> 01:20:31,280
figuring out like what is what are these
 

4417
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:33,550
figuring out like what is what are these
people saying and you're trying to like

4418
01:20:33,550 --> 01:20:33,560
people saying and you're trying to like
 

4419
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:34,830
people saying and you're trying to like
make sense how does that connect to the

4420
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:34,840
make sense how does that connect to the
 

4421
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:36,430
make sense how does that connect to the
world and all that kind of stuff yeah

4422
01:20:36,430 --> 01:20:36,440
world and all that kind of stuff yeah
 

4423
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:38,830
world and all that kind of stuff yeah
that that that might be just fascinating

4424
01:20:38,830 --> 01:20:38,840
that that that might be just fascinating
 

4425
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:40,390
that that that might be just fascinating
development that's happening there

4426
01:20:40,390 --> 01:20:40,400
development that's happening there
 

4427
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,070
development that's happening there
that's yeah hard to introspect but

4428
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:42,080
that's yeah hard to introspect but
 

4429
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,390
that's yeah hard to introspect but
anyway you anyway we're back to the

4430
01:20:43,390 --> 01:20:43,400
anyway you anyway we're back to the
 

4431
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:47,030
anyway you anyway we're back to the
scanner and I can find my network in 15

4432
01:20:47,030 --> 01:20:47,040
scanner and I can find my network in 15
 

4433
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:49,070
scanner and I can find my network in 15
minutes and now we can ask a we can ask

4434
01:20:49,070 --> 01:20:49,080
minutes and now we can ask a we can ask
 

4435
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:50,830
minutes and now we can ask a we can ask
find my network find yours find you know

4436
01:20:50,830 --> 01:20:50,840
find my network find yours find you know
 

4437
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:53,149
find my network find yours find you know
20 other people do this task and and we

4438
01:20:53,149 --> 01:20:53,159
20 other people do this task and and we
 

4439
01:20:53,159 --> 01:20:54,669
20 other people do this task and and we
can do some other tasks anything else

4440
01:20:54,669 --> 01:20:54,679
can do some other tasks anything else
 

4441
01:20:54,679 --> 01:20:56,709
can do some other tasks anything else
else you think is thinking of some other

4442
01:20:56,709 --> 01:20:56,719
else you think is thinking of some other
 

4443
01:20:56,719 --> 01:20:59,390
else you think is thinking of some other
thing I can do a spatial memory task I

4444
01:20:59,390 --> 01:20:59,400
thing I can do a spatial memory task I
 

4445
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:03,110
thing I can do a spatial memory task I
can do a music perception task I can do

4446
01:21:03,110 --> 01:21:03,120
can do a music perception task I can do
 

4447
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,830
can do a music perception task I can do
programming task if I program okay I can

4448
01:21:05,830 --> 01:21:05,840
programming task if I program okay I can
 

4449
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,830
programming task if I program okay I can
do uh where I can like understand

4450
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:07,840
do uh where I can like understand
 

4451
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,470
do uh where I can like understand
computer programs and none of those

4452
01:21:10,470 --> 01:21:10,480
computer programs and none of those
 

4453
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:13,030
computer programs and none of those
tasks tap the language Network at all

4454
01:21:13,030 --> 01:21:13,040
tasks tap the language Network at all
 

4455
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:14,910
tasks tap the language Network at all
like at all there's no overlap they do

4456
01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:14,920
like at all there's no overlap they do
 

4457
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:16,510
like at all there's no overlap they do
they're they're highly activated in

4458
01:21:16,510 --> 01:21:16,520
they're they're highly activated in
 

4459
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:18,070
they're they're highly activated in
other parts of the brain there's a

4460
01:21:18,070 --> 01:21:18,080
other parts of the brain there's a
 

4461
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,750
other parts of the brain there's a
there's a bilateral Network which I

4462
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:20,760
there's a bilateral Network which I
 

4463
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:22,310
there's a bilateral Network which I

4464
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:22,320
think she she tends to call the multiple
 

4465
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:23,790
think she she tends to call the multiple
demands Network which does anything kind

4466
01:21:23,790 --> 01:21:23,800
demands Network which does anything kind
 

4467
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:26,070
demands Network which does anything kind
of hard and so anything that's kind of

4468
01:21:26,070 --> 01:21:26,080
of hard and so anything that's kind of
 

4469
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,550
of hard and so anything that's kind of
difficult in some ways will um activate

4470
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:28,560
difficult in some ways will um activate
 

4471
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,669
difficult in some ways will um activate
that multiple demands Network I mean

4472
01:21:30,669 --> 01:21:30,679
that multiple demands Network I mean
 

4473
01:21:30,679 --> 01:21:32,830
that multiple demands Network I mean
music will be in some music area you

4474
01:21:32,830 --> 01:21:32,840
music will be in some music area you
 

4475
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:34,149
music will be in some music area you
know there's music specific kinds of

4476
01:21:34,149 --> 01:21:34,159
know there's music specific kinds of
 

4477
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:37,110
know there's music specific kinds of
areas and so uh but they but but none of

4478
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:37,120
areas and so uh but they but but none of
 

4479
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:39,590
areas and so uh but they but but none of
them are activating the language area at

4480
01:21:39,590 --> 01:21:39,600
them are activating the language area at
 

4481
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,629
them are activating the language area at
all unless there's words like so if you

4482
01:21:41,629 --> 01:21:41,639
all unless there's words like so if you
 

4483
01:21:41,639 --> 01:21:43,470
all unless there's words like so if you
have music and there's a song and you

4484
01:21:43,470 --> 01:21:43,480
have music and there's a song and you
 

4485
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:45,189
have music and there's a song and you
can hear the words then then then you

4486
01:21:45,189 --> 01:21:45,199
can hear the words then then then you
 

4487
01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:46,430
can hear the words then then then you
get the language area we're talking

4488
01:21:46,430 --> 01:21:46,440
get the language area we're talking
 

4489
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:48,870
get the language area we're talking
about speaking and listening but are or

4490
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:48,880
about speaking and listening but are or
 

4491
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,750
about speaking and listening but are or
we also talking about reading this is

4492
01:21:50,750 --> 01:21:50,760
we also talking about reading this is
 

4493
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:53,709
we also talking about reading this is
all comprehension of any kind and so so

4494
01:21:53,709 --> 01:21:53,719
all comprehension of any kind and so so
 

4495
01:21:53,719 --> 01:21:56,030
all comprehension of any kind and so so
that is fascina so what this this this

4496
01:21:56,030 --> 01:21:56,040
that is fascina so what this this this
 

4497
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:57,950
that is fascina so what this this this
network doesn't make any difference if

4498
01:21:57,950 --> 01:21:57,960
network doesn't make any difference if
 

4499
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:00,270
network doesn't make any difference if
it's written or spoken so the the Lang

4500
01:22:00,270 --> 01:22:00,280
it's written or spoken so the the Lang
 

4501
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:02,149
it's written or spoken so the the Lang
the thing that she calls ferano calls

4502
01:22:02,149 --> 01:22:02,159
the thing that she calls ferano calls
 

4503
01:22:02,159 --> 01:22:03,709
the thing that she calls ferano calls
the the language network is this high

4504
01:22:03,709 --> 01:22:03,719
the the language network is this high
 

4505
01:22:03,719 --> 01:22:05,310
the the language network is this high
level language so it's not about the

4506
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:05,320
level language so it's not about the
 

4507
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:07,470
level language so it's not about the
spoken the spoken language and it's not

4508
01:22:07,470 --> 01:22:07,480
spoken the spoken language and it's not
 

4509
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:08,709
spoken the spoken language and it's not
about the written language it's about

4510
01:22:08,709 --> 01:22:08,719
about the written language it's about
 

4511
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:10,709
about the written language it's about
either one of them and so we're so when

4512
01:22:10,709 --> 01:22:10,719
either one of them and so we're so when
 

4513
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:12,510
either one of them and so we're so when
you do speech you're sort of listen you

4514
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:12,520
you do speech you're sort of listen you
 

4515
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:13,950
you do speech you're sort of listen you
either you listen to speech and you and

4516
01:22:13,950 --> 01:22:13,960
either you listen to speech and you and
 

4517
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:15,270
either you listen to speech and you and
you subtract away some language you

4518
01:22:15,270 --> 01:22:15,280
you subtract away some language you
 

4519
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:17,350
you subtract away some language you
don't understand and so and or you

4520
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:17,360
don't understand and so and or you
 

4521
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:19,270
don't understand and so and or you
subtract away back backward speech which

4522
01:22:19,270 --> 01:22:19,280
subtract away back backward speech which
 

4523
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,750
subtract away back backward speech which
signs sounds like speech but it isn't

4524
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:21,760
signs sounds like speech but it isn't
 

4525
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,790
signs sounds like speech but it isn't
and and then so you you take away the

4526
01:22:23,790 --> 01:22:23,800
and and then so you you take away the
 

4527
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:25,790
and and then so you you take away the
sound part

4528
01:22:25,790 --> 01:22:25,800
sound part
 

4529
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,830
sound part
and so and then if you do written you

4530
01:22:27,830 --> 01:22:27,840
and so and then if you do written you
 

4531
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:30,030
and so and then if you do written you
get exactly the same network so for just

4532
01:22:30,030 --> 01:22:30,040
get exactly the same network so for just
 

4533
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:32,310
get exactly the same network so for just
reading the language versus reading sort

4534
01:22:32,310 --> 01:22:32,320
reading the language versus reading sort
 

4535
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,030
reading the language versus reading sort
of nonsense words or something like that

4536
01:22:34,030 --> 01:22:34,040
of nonsense words or something like that
 

4537
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:36,189
of nonsense words or something like that
you you'll find exactly the same network

4538
01:22:36,189 --> 01:22:36,199
you you'll find exactly the same network
 

4539
01:22:36,199 --> 01:22:38,950
you you'll find exactly the same network
so this is about high level um the

4540
01:22:38,950 --> 01:22:38,960
so this is about high level um the
 

4541
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,550
so this is about high level um the
compreh comprehension of language yeah

4542
01:22:40,550 --> 01:22:40,560
compreh comprehension of language yeah
 

4543
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:41,750
compreh comprehension of language yeah
in this case and and the same thing

4544
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:41,760
in this case and and the same thing
 

4545
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:42,990
in this case and and the same thing
happen production is a little harder to

4546
01:22:42,990 --> 01:22:43,000
happen production is a little harder to
 

4547
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,030
happen production is a little harder to
run the scanner but the same thing

4548
01:22:44,030 --> 01:22:44,040
run the scanner but the same thing
 

4549
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:45,430
run the scanner but the same thing
happens in production you get the same

4550
01:22:45,430 --> 01:22:45,440
happens in production you get the same
 

4551
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:47,070
happens in production you get the same
network so production is a little harder

4552
01:22:47,070 --> 01:22:47,080
network so production is a little harder
 

4553
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:48,270
network so production is a little harder
right you have to figure out how do you

4554
01:22:48,270 --> 01:22:48,280
right you have to figure out how do you
 

4555
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:50,110
right you have to figure out how do you
run a task you know in the network such

4556
01:22:50,110 --> 01:22:50,120
run a task you know in the network such
 

4557
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:50,990
run a task you know in the network such
that you're doing some kind of

4558
01:22:50,990 --> 01:22:51,000
that you're doing some kind of
 

4559
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,390
that you're doing some kind of
production and I can't remember what

4560
01:22:52,390 --> 01:22:52,400
production and I can't remember what
 

4561
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:53,629
production and I can't remember what
they've done a bunch of different kinds

4562
01:22:53,629 --> 01:22:53,639
they've done a bunch of different kinds
 

4563
01:22:53,639 --> 01:22:56,590
they've done a bunch of different kinds
of tasks there where you get people to

4564
01:22:56,590 --> 01:22:56,600
of tasks there where you get people to
 

4565
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,149
of tasks there where you get people to
produce things yeah figure out how to

4566
01:22:58,149 --> 01:22:58,159
produce things yeah figure out how to
 

4567
01:22:58,159 --> 01:23:00,270
produce things yeah figure out how to
produce and the same network goes on

4568
01:23:00,270 --> 01:23:00,280
produce and the same network goes on
 

4569
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:02,470
produce and the same network goes on
there exactly the same place so if wait

4570
01:23:02,470 --> 01:23:02,480
there exactly the same place so if wait
 

4571
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:04,950
there exactly the same place so if wait
wait so if you read random words yeah if

4572
01:23:04,950 --> 01:23:04,960
wait so if you read random words yeah if
 

4573
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:08,110
wait so if you read random words yeah if
you read things like um like jish yeah

4574
01:23:08,110 --> 01:23:08,120
you read things like um like jish yeah
 

4575
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:11,229
you read things like um like jish yeah
yeah Lewis carols TW Brill Jabberwocky

4576
01:23:11,229 --> 01:23:11,239
yeah Lewis carols TW Brill Jabberwocky
 

4577
01:23:11,239 --> 01:23:13,590
yeah Lewis carols TW Brill Jabberwocky
right they call that Jabberwocky speech

4578
01:23:13,590 --> 01:23:13,600
right they call that Jabberwocky speech
 

4579
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:15,430
right they call that Jabberwocky speech
the network doesn't get activated not as

4580
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:15,440
the network doesn't get activated not as
 

4581
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:18,470
the network doesn't get activated not as
much there are words in there there's

4582
01:23:18,470 --> 01:23:18,480
much there are words in there there's
 

4583
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:20,149
much there are words in there there's
function words and stuff so it's lower

4584
01:23:20,149 --> 01:23:20,159
function words and stuff so it's lower
 

4585
01:23:20,159 --> 01:23:22,110
function words and stuff so it's lower
activation fascinating yeah yeah so

4586
01:23:22,110 --> 01:23:22,120
activation fascinating yeah yeah so
 

4587
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:23,790
activation fascinating yeah yeah so
there's like basically the more language

4588
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:23,800
there's like basically the more language
 

4589
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:26,070
there's like basically the more language
like it is the higher it goes in the

4590
01:23:26,070 --> 01:23:26,080
like it is the higher it goes in the
 

4591
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,590
like it is the higher it goes in the
language Network and that network is

4592
01:23:28,590 --> 01:23:28,600
language Network and that network is
 

4593
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:30,750
language Network and that network is
there from when you speak from as soon

4594
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:30,760
there from when you speak from as soon
 

4595
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:33,110
there from when you speak from as soon
as you learn language and and and it's

4596
01:23:33,110 --> 01:23:33,120
as you learn language and and and it's
 

4597
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,830
as you learn language and and and it's
it's there like you you speak multiple

4598
01:23:34,830 --> 01:23:34,840
it's there like you you speak multiple
 

4599
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:36,709
it's there like you you speak multiple
languages the same network is going for

4600
01:23:36,709 --> 01:23:36,719
languages the same network is going for
 

4601
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:38,310
languages the same network is going for
your multiple languages so you speak

4602
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:38,320
your multiple languages so you speak
 

4603
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,629
your multiple languages so you speak
English you speak Russian then both of

4604
01:23:40,629 --> 01:23:40,639
English you speak Russian then both of
 

4605
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:42,510
English you speak Russian then both of
them are hitting that same network if

4606
01:23:42,510 --> 01:23:42,520
them are hitting that same network if
 

4607
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:44,430
them are hitting that same network if
you if you're fluent in those languages

4608
01:23:44,430 --> 01:23:44,440
you if you're fluent in those languages
 

4609
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:46,590
you if you're fluent in those languages
so programming not at all isn't that

4610
01:23:46,590 --> 01:23:46,600
so programming not at all isn't that
 

4611
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:48,470
so programming not at all isn't that
amazing even if you're a really good

4612
01:23:48,470 --> 01:23:48,480
amazing even if you're a really good
 

4613
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:51,390
amazing even if you're a really good
programmer that is not a human language

4614
01:23:51,390 --> 01:23:51,400
programmer that is not a human language
 

4615
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:52,950
programmer that is not a human language
it's just not conveying the same

4616
01:23:52,950 --> 01:23:52,960
it's just not conveying the same
 

4617
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:55,229
it's just not conveying the same
information and so it is not in the

4618
01:23:55,229 --> 01:23:55,239
information and so it is not in the
 

4619
01:23:55,239 --> 01:23:56,669
information and so it is not in the
language Network and so is that as

4620
01:23:56,669 --> 01:23:56,679
language Network and so is that as
 

4621
01:23:56,679 --> 01:23:59,110
language Network and so is that as
mindblowing as I think that's that's

4622
01:23:59,110 --> 01:23:59,120
mindblowing as I think that's that's
 

4623
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:01,350
mindblowing as I think that's that's
weird it's amazing so that's like one

4624
01:24:01,350 --> 01:24:01,360
weird it's amazing so that's like one
 

4625
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:03,390
weird it's amazing so that's like one
set of dat this hers like shows that

4626
01:24:03,390 --> 01:24:03,400
set of dat this hers like shows that
 

4627
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,510
set of dat this hers like shows that
what you might think is thinking is is

4628
01:24:05,510 --> 01:24:05,520
what you might think is thinking is is
 

4629
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:07,950
what you might think is thinking is is
not language language is just the SE

4630
01:24:07,950 --> 01:24:07,960
not language language is just the SE
 

4631
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:10,669
not language language is just the SE
just just this conventionalized system

01:24:10,669 --> 01:24:10,679
just just this conventionalized system
 

4633
01:24:10,679 --> 01:24:12,669
just just this conventionalized system
that we've worked out in in human

4634
01:24:12,669 --> 01:24:12,679
that we've worked out in in human
 

4635
01:24:12,679 --> 01:24:14,870
that we've worked out in in human
languages oh another fascinating little

4636
01:24:14,870 --> 01:24:14,880
languages oh another fascinating little
 

4637
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:17,470
languages oh another fascinating little
bit tidbit is that even if they're these

4638
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:17,480
bit tidbit is that even if they're these
 

4639
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:21,390
bit tidbit is that even if they're these
constructed languages like Klingon or um

I don't know the languages from Game of

4642
01:24:22,750 --> 01:24:22,760
I don't know the languages from Game of
 

4643
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:24,390
I don't know the languages from Game of
Thrones I'm sorry I don't remember those

4644
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:24,400
Thrones I'm sorry I don't remember those
 

4645
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,030
Thrones I'm sorry I don't remember those
languages maybe a lot of people offended

4646
01:24:26,030 --> 01:24:26,040
languages maybe a lot of people offended
 

4647
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:27,310
languages maybe a lot of people offended
right now there's people that speak

4648
01:24:27,310 --> 01:24:27,320
right now there's people that speak
 

4649
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:28,910
right now there's people that speak
those languages they they they really

4650
01:24:28,910 --> 01:24:28,920
those languages they they they really
 

4651
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:30,550
those languages they they they really
speak those languages because the people

4652
01:24:30,550 --> 01:24:30,560
speak those languages because the people
 

4653
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:34,790
speak those languages because the people
that wrote the languages for the shows

4654
01:24:34,790 --> 01:24:34,800
that wrote the languages for the shows
 

4655
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,510
that wrote the languages for the shows
um they did an amazing job of

4656
01:24:36,510 --> 01:24:36,520
um they did an amazing job of
 

4657
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:38,270
um they did an amazing job of
constructing something like a human

4658
01:24:38,270 --> 01:24:38,280
constructing something like a human
 

4659
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:40,830
constructing something like a human
language and those that that lights up

4660
01:24:40,830 --> 01:24:40,840
language and those that that lights up
 

4661
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:43,430
language and those that that lights up
the language area that's like because

4662
01:24:43,430 --> 01:24:43,440
the language area that's like because
 

4663
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:45,189
the language area that's like because
they can speak you know pretty much

4664
01:24:45,189 --> 01:24:45,199
they can speak you know pretty much
 

4665
01:24:45,199 --> 01:24:46,990
they can speak you know pretty much
arbitrary thoughts in a human language

4666
01:24:46,990 --> 01:24:47,000
arbitrary thoughts in a human language
 

4667
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,830
arbitrary thoughts in a human language
it's not a it's a constructed human

4668
01:24:48,830 --> 01:24:48,840
it's not a it's a constructed human
 

4669
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:50,390
it's not a it's a constructed human
language and probably it's related to

4670
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:50,400
language and probably it's related to
 

4671
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:51,750
language and probably it's related to
human languages because the people that

4672
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:51,760
human languages because the people that
 

4673
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,189
human languages because the people that
were constructing them was were making

4674
01:24:53,189 --> 01:24:53,199
were constructing them was were making
 

4675
01:24:53,199 --> 01:24:55,229
were constructing them was were making
them like human languages various ways

4676
01:24:55,229 --> 01:24:55,239
them like human languages various ways
 

4677
01:24:55,239 --> 01:24:57,109
them like human languages various ways
but it it also activates the same

4678
01:24:57,109 --> 01:24:57,119
but it it also activates the same
 

4679
01:24:57,119 --> 01:24:59,229
but it it also activates the same
network which is pretty pretty cool

4680
01:24:59,229 --> 01:24:59,239
network which is pretty pretty cool
 

4681
01:24:59,239 --> 01:25:01,030
network which is pretty pretty cool
anyway sorry to go into a place where

4682
01:25:01,030 --> 01:25:01,040
anyway sorry to go into a place where
 

4683
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:03,750
anyway sorry to go into a place where
you may be a little bit philosophical

4684
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:03,760
you may be a little bit philosophical
 

4685
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:06,430
you may be a little bit philosophical
but is it possible that this area of the

4686
01:25:06,430 --> 01:25:06,440
but is it possible that this area of the
 

4687
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:08,350
but is it possible that this area of the
brain is doing some kind of translation

4688
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:08,360
brain is doing some kind of translation
 

4689
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:12,629
brain is doing some kind of translation
into a deeper set of almost like a

4690
01:25:12,629 --> 01:25:12,639
into a deeper set of almost like a
 

4691
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:15,390
into a deeper set of almost like a
Concepts that's it has to be doing so

4692
01:25:15,390 --> 01:25:15,400
Concepts that's it has to be doing so
 

4693
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:17,430
Concepts that's it has to be doing so
it's doing in communication right it is

4694
01:25:17,430 --> 01:25:17,440
it's doing in communication right it is
 

4695
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,790
it's doing in communication right it is
translating from thought whatever that

4696
01:25:19,790 --> 01:25:19,800
translating from thought whatever that
 

4697
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:21,790
translating from thought whatever that
is it's more abstract and it's doing

4698
01:25:21,790 --> 01:25:21,800
is it's more abstract and it's doing
 

4699
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:23,590
is it's more abstract and it's doing
that that's what it's doing like it is

4700
01:25:23,590 --> 01:25:23,600
that that's what it's doing like it is
 

4701
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:24,990
that that's what it's doing like it is
that that is kind of what it is doing

4702
01:25:24,990 --> 01:25:25,000
that that is kind of what it is doing
 

4703
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,510
that that is kind of what it is doing
it's kind of a meaning Network I guess

4704
01:25:27,510 --> 01:25:27,520
it's kind of a meaning Network I guess
 

4705
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:29,310
it's kind of a meaning Network I guess
yeah like a translation network but I

4706
01:25:29,310 --> 01:25:29,320
yeah like a translation network but I
 

4707
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:31,750
yeah like a translation network but I
wonder what is at the core at the bottom

4708
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:31,760
wonder what is at the core at the bottom
 

4709
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:33,390
wonder what is at the core at the bottom
of it like what are thoughts are they

4710
01:25:33,390 --> 01:25:33,400
of it like what are thoughts are they
 

4711
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:35,990
of it like what are thoughts are they
are thoughts to me like I don't know

4712
01:25:35,990 --> 01:25:36,000
are thoughts to me like I don't know
 

4713
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,109
are thoughts to me like I don't know
thoughts and words are they neighbors or

4714
01:25:39,109 --> 01:25:39,119
thoughts and words are they neighbors or
 

4715
01:25:39,119 --> 01:25:41,350
thoughts and words are they neighbors or
are is it one turtle sitting on top of

4716
01:25:41,350 --> 01:25:41,360
are is it one turtle sitting on top of
 

4717
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:43,950
are is it one turtle sitting on top of
the other meaning like is there a

4718
01:25:43,950 --> 01:25:43,960
the other meaning like is there a
 

4719
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:46,990
the other meaning like is there a
deep set of Concepts that we well

4720
01:25:46,990 --> 01:25:47,000
deep set of Concepts that we well
 

4721
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,229
deep set of Concepts that we well
there's connections right between the

4722
01:25:49,229 --> 01:25:49,239
there's connections right between the
 

4723
01:25:49,239 --> 01:25:50,430
there's connections right between the
what what these things mean and then

4724
01:25:50,430 --> 01:25:50,440
what what these things mean and then
 

4725
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:51,550
what what these things mean and then
there's probably other other parts of

4726
01:25:51,550 --> 01:25:51,560
there's probably other other parts of
 

4727
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:53,629
there's probably other other parts of
the brain what these things mean and so

4728
01:25:53,629 --> 01:25:53,639
the brain what these things mean and so
 

4729
01:25:53,639 --> 01:25:56,030
the brain what these things mean and so
you know when I'm talking about whatever

4730
01:25:56,030 --> 01:25:56,040
you know when I'm talking about whatever
 

4731
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:57,669
you know when I'm talking about whatever
it is I want to talk about if it's some

4732
01:25:57,669 --> 01:25:57,679
it is I want to talk about if it's some
 

4733
01:25:57,679 --> 01:25:59,669
it is I want to talk about if it's some
it'll be represented somewhere else that

4734
01:25:59,669 --> 01:25:59,679
it'll be represented somewhere else that
 

4735
01:25:59,679 --> 01:26:01,310
it'll be represented somewhere else that
that knowledge of whatever that is will

4736
01:26:01,310 --> 01:26:01,320
that knowledge of whatever that is will
 

4737
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:02,990
that knowledge of whatever that is will
be represented somewhere else well I

4738
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:03,000
be represented somewhere else well I
 

4739
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,990
be represented somewhere else well I
wonder if there's like some stable

4740
01:26:04,990 --> 01:26:05,000
wonder if there's like some stable
 

4741
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,030
wonder if there's like some stable
nicely compressed encoding of meanings I

4742
01:26:08,030 --> 01:26:08,040
nicely compressed encoding of meanings I
 

4743
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:10,629
nicely compressed encoding of meanings I
don't know that's separate from language

4744
01:26:10,629 --> 01:26:10,639
don't know that's separate from language
 

4745
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:11,870
don't know that's separate from language
that you

4746
01:26:11,870 --> 01:26:11,880
that you
 

4747
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:14,350
that you
know I guess I guess the implication

4748
01:26:14,350 --> 01:26:14,360
know I guess I guess the implication
 

4749
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:15,390
know I guess I guess the implication
here is

4750
01:26:15,390 --> 01:26:15,400
here is
 

4751
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:19,030
here is
that that we don't think in language

4752
01:26:19,030 --> 01:26:19,040
that that we don't think in language
 

4753
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,550
that that we don't think in language
that's correct isn't that cool and and

4754
01:26:21,550 --> 01:26:21,560
that's correct isn't that cool and and
 

4755
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:23,149
that's correct isn't that cool and and
and that's so interesting so people I

4756
01:26:23,149 --> 01:26:23,159
and that's so interesting so people I
 

4757
01:26:23,159 --> 01:26:25,229
and that's so interesting so people I
mean this is like hard to experiments on

4758
01:26:25,229 --> 01:26:25,239
mean this is like hard to experiments on
 

4759
01:26:25,239 --> 01:26:27,990
mean this is like hard to experiments on
but there is this idea of an inner voice

4760
01:26:27,990 --> 01:26:28,000
but there is this idea of an inner voice
 

4761
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,109
but there is this idea of an inner voice
and a lot of people have an inner voice

4762
01:26:30,109 --> 01:26:30,119
and a lot of people have an inner voice
 

4763
01:26:30,119 --> 01:26:32,310
and a lot of people have an inner voice
and so if you do a poll on the internet

4764
01:26:32,310 --> 01:26:32,320
and so if you do a poll on the internet
 

4765
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,189
and so if you do a poll on the internet
and ask if you you hear self talking

4766
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:34,199
and ask if you you hear self talking
 

4767
01:26:34,199 --> 01:26:35,669
and ask if you you hear self talking
when you're just thinking or whatever

4768
01:26:35,669 --> 01:26:35,679
when you're just thinking or whatever
 

4769
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:37,990
when you're just thinking or whatever
you know about 70 or 80% of people will

4770
01:26:37,990 --> 01:26:38,000
you know about 70 or 80% of people will
 

4771
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,550
you know about 70 or 80% of people will
say yes uh most people have an inner

4772

say yes uh most people have an inner
voice I I I don't and so I always find

4774
01:26:43,149 --> 01:26:43,159
voice I I I don't and so I always find
 

4775
01:26:43,159 --> 01:26:44,830
voice I I I don't and so I always find
this strange when so when people talk

4776
01:26:44,830 --> 01:26:44,840
this strange when so when people talk
 

4777
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:46,070
this strange when so when people talk
about an inner voice I always thought

4778
01:26:46,070 --> 01:26:46,080
about an inner voice I always thought
 

4779
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:49,229
about an inner voice I always thought
this was a metaphor and and uh they here

4780
01:26:49,229 --> 01:26:49,239
this was a metaphor and and uh they here
 

4781
01:26:49,239 --> 01:26:51,070
this was a metaphor and and uh they here
I'm I know most of you whoever is

4782
01:26:51,070 --> 01:26:51,080
I'm I know most of you whoever is
 

4783
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:53,109
I'm I know most of you whoever is
listening to this thinks I'm crazy now

4784
01:26:53,109 --> 01:26:53,119
listening to this thinks I'm crazy now
 

4785
01:26:53,119 --> 01:26:54,430
listening to this thinks I'm crazy now
because I'm I don't have an in your

4786
01:26:54,430 --> 01:26:54,440
because I'm I don't have an in your
 

4787
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:55,709
because I'm I don't have an in your
voice and I I just don't know what

4788
01:26:55,709 --> 01:26:55,719
voice and I I just don't know what
 

4789
01:26:55,719 --> 01:26:57,590
voice and I I just don't know what
you're listening to I I just it sounds

4790
01:26:57,590 --> 01:26:57,600
you're listening to I I just it sounds
 

4791
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:00,070
you're listening to I I just it sounds
so kind of annoying to me but that to

4792
01:27:00,070 --> 01:27:00,080
so kind of annoying to me but that to
 

4793
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:01,709
so kind of annoying to me but that to
have this voice going on while you're

4794
01:27:01,709 --> 01:27:01,719
have this voice going on while you're
 

4795
01:27:01,719 --> 01:27:03,629
have this voice going on while you're
while you're thinking but I guess most

4796
01:27:03,629 --> 01:27:03,639
while you're thinking but I guess most
 

4797
01:27:03,639 --> 01:27:05,870
while you're thinking but I guess most
people have that and I don't have that

4798
01:27:05,870 --> 01:27:05,880
people have that and I don't have that
 

4799
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:07,709
people have that and I don't have that
and uh I don't we don't really know what

4800
01:27:07,709 --> 01:27:07,719
and uh I don't we don't really know what
 

4801
01:27:07,719 --> 01:27:09,310
and uh I don't we don't really know what
that that connects to I wonder if the

4802
01:27:09,310 --> 01:27:09,320
that that connects to I wonder if the
 

4803
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:11,310
that that connects to I wonder if the
inner voice activates that same network

4804
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:11,320
inner voice activates that same network
 

4805
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:13,870
inner voice activates that same network
I I wonder I don't I don't know I don't

4806
01:27:13,870 --> 01:27:13,880
I I wonder I don't I don't know I don't
 

4807
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:15,310
I I wonder I don't I don't know I don't
know I mean this could be speechy right

4808
01:27:15,310 --> 01:27:15,320
know I mean this could be speechy right
 

4809
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:17,270
know I mean this could be speechy right
so that's like that you hear do you have

4810
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:17,280
so that's like that you hear do you have
 

4811
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:19,750
so that's like that you hear do you have
an ear voice I don't think so oh a lot

4812
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:19,760
an ear voice I don't think so oh a lot
 

4813
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:22,229
an ear voice I don't think so oh a lot
of people have this sense that they hear

4814
01:27:22,229 --> 01:27:22,239
of people have this sense that they hear
 

4815
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:24,470
of people have this sense that they hear
other PE they hear themselves and say

4816
01:27:24,470 --> 01:27:24,480
other PE they hear themselves and say
 

4817
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:25,629
other PE they hear themselves and say
they read someone's email I've heard

4818
01:27:25,629 --> 01:27:25,639
they read someone's email I've heard
 

4819
01:27:25,639 --> 01:27:27,310
they read someone's email I've heard
people tell me that they hear that other

4820

people tell me that they hear that other
 

4821
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:28,629
people tell me that they hear that other
other person's voice when they read

4822
01:27:28,629 --> 01:27:28,639
other person's voice when they read
 

4823
01:27:28,639 --> 01:27:29,709
other person's voice when they read
other

4824
01:27:29,709 --> 01:27:29,719
other
 

4825
01:27:29,719 --> 01:27:32,229
other
people's emails and I'm like wow that

4827
01:27:32,239 --> 01:27:34,870
people's emails and I'm like wow that
sounds so disruptive I do think I like

4828
01:27:34,870 --> 01:27:34,880
sounds so disruptive I do think I like
 

4829
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:37,070
sounds so disruptive I do think I like
vocalize what I'm reading but I don't

4830
01:27:37,070 --> 01:27:37,080
vocalize what I'm reading but I don't
 

4831

01:27:40,430 --> 01:27:40,440
probably don't have an inter voice yeah
 

4835
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:41,669

I don't think I have people have an
 

4837
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:44,310
I don't think I have people have an
voice people have this strong percept of

01:27:44,310 --> 01:27:44,320
voice people have this strong percept of
 

4839
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:46,830

hearing sound in their heads when
 

4841
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:48,830
hearing sound in their heads when
they're just thinking I refuse to

they're just thinking I refuse to
 

4843
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:50,350
they're just thinking I refuse to
believe that's the majority of people

4844

believe that's the majority of people
 

4845
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:53,229
believe that's the majority of people
majority absolutely it's it's like 2/3

4846
01:27:53,229 --> 01:27:53,239
majority absolutely it's it's like 2/3
 

4847

4853
01:28:00,119 --> 01:28:02,550

could be a self-report flaw it could be

4854
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:02,560
could be a self-report flaw it could be
 

4855
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:06,629

you know when I'm reading yeah inside my
 

4857
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:10,830
you know when I'm reading yeah inside my
head I'm kind of like saying the words

4858
01:28:10,830 --> 01:28:10,840

4859
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:13,030

which is probably the wrong way to read

4860
01:28:13,030 --> 01:28:13,040
which is probably the wrong way to read
 

4861
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:15,870
which is probably the wrong way to read
but I don't hear a voice there's no PR

4862
01:28:15,870 --> 01:28:15,880
but I don't hear a voice there's no PR

a fascinating the human brain is fasc
but it still blew my mind that the that

01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:25,560
but it still blew my mind that the that

language does appear comprehension does

language does appear comprehension does
 

4873
01:28:28,239 --> 01:28:32,629
language does appear comprehension does
appear to be separate from thinking MH

so that's one set one set of data from

01:28:35,149 --> 01:28:35,159
so that's one set one set of data from
 

4877

so that's one set one set of data from
feder Eno's group is that um no matter

4878
01:28:38,709 --> 01:28:38,719
feder Eno's group is that um no matter
 

4879
01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:40,709
feder Eno's group is that um no matter
what task you do if it doesn't have

what task you do if it doesn't have
 

4881
01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:42,390
what task you do if it doesn't have
words and combinations of words in it

words and combinations of words in it
 

4883
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:43,870
words and combinations of words in it
then it won't light up the language

4884
01:28:43,870 --> 01:28:43,880
then it won't light up the language
 

4885
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:45,990
then it won't light up the language
Network and you know you could it'll be

4886
01:28:45,990 --> 01:28:46,000
Network and you know you could it'll be
 

4887
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,310
Network and you know you could it'll be
active somewhere else but not there so

4888
01:28:48,310 --> 01:28:48,320
active somewhere else but not there so
 

4889
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:51,030
active somewhere else but not there so
that's one and then this other um piece

4890
01:28:51,030 --> 01:28:51,040
that's one and then this other um piece
 

4891
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:54,310
that's one and then this other um piece
of evidence relevant to that question is

4892
01:28:54,310 --> 01:28:54,320
of evidence relevant to that question is
 

4893
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:56,070
of evidence relevant to that question is
it turns out there are these this group

4894
01:28:56,070 --> 01:28:56,080
it turns out there are these this group
 

4895
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:58,709
it turns out there are these this group
of people who've had a massive stroke on

4896
01:28:58,709 --> 01:28:58,719
of people who've had a massive stroke on
 

4897
01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:00,510
of people who've had a massive stroke on
the left side and wiped out their

4898
01:29:00,510 --> 01:29:00,520
the left side and wiped out their
 

4899
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:02,629
the left side and wiped out their
language Network and it as long as they

4900
01:29:02,629 --> 01:29:02,639
language Network and it as long as they
 

4901
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:04,070
language Network and it as long as they
didn't wipe out everything on the right

4902
01:29:04,070 --> 01:29:04,080
didn't wipe out everything on the right
 

4903
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:05,669
didn't wipe out everything on the right
as well in that case they wouldn't be

4904
01:29:05,669 --> 01:29:05,679
as well in that case they wouldn't be
 

4905
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:07,590
as well in that case they wouldn't be
you know cognitively functionable but if

4906
01:29:07,590 --> 01:29:07,600
you know cognitively functionable but if
 

4907
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:09,310
you know cognitively functionable but if
they just wiped out language which is

4908
01:29:09,310 --> 01:29:09,320
they just wiped out language which is
 

4909
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:10,950
they just wiped out language which is
pretty tough to do because it's it's

4910
01:29:10,950 --> 01:29:10,960
pretty tough to do because it's it's
 

4911
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:13,149
pretty tough to do because it's it's
very expansive on the left but if they

4912
01:29:13,149 --> 01:29:13,159
very expansive on the left but if they
 

4913
01:29:13,159 --> 01:29:15,189
very expansive on the left but if they
have then there are these there's

4914
01:29:15,189 --> 01:29:15,199
have then there are these there's
 

4915
01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:17,030
have then there are these there's

just fine but not language they can't
they can't talk to them I mean you they

4922
01:29:25,510 --> 01:29:25,520
they can't talk to them I mean you they
 

4923
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:27,550
they can't talk to them I mean you they
don't understand you they can't speak

4924
01:29:27,550 --> 01:29:27,560
don't understand you they can't speak
 

4925
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:29,870
don't understand you they can't speak
they can't write they can't read but

4926
01:29:29,870 --> 01:29:29,880
they can't write they can't read but
 

4927
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:31,430
they can't write they can't read but
they can do all they can play chess they

4928
01:29:31,430 --> 01:29:31,440
they can do all they can play chess they
 

4929
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:33,270
they can do all they can play chess they
can drive their cars they can do all

4930
01:29:33,270 --> 01:29:33,280
can drive their cars they can do all
 

4931
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:34,910
can drive their cars they can do all
kinds of other stuff you know do math

4932
01:29:34,910 --> 01:29:34,920
kinds of other stuff you know do math
 

4933
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:36,510
kinds of other stuff you know do math
they can do all like so math is not in

4934
01:29:36,510 --> 01:29:36,520
they can do all like so math is not in
 

4935
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:38,109
they can do all like so math is not in
the language area for instance you do

4936
01:29:38,109 --> 01:29:38,119
the language area for instance you do
 

4937
01:29:38,119 --> 01:29:39,790
the language area for instance you do
arithmetic and stuff that's not language

4938
01:29:39,790 --> 01:29:39,800
arithmetic and stuff that's not language
 

4939
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:41,870
arithmetic and stuff that's not language
area it's got symbols so people sort of

4940
01:29:41,870 --> 01:29:41,880
area it's got symbols so people sort of
 

4941
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:43,109
area it's got symbols so people sort of
confused some kind of symbolic

4942
01:29:43,109 --> 01:29:43,119
confused some kind of symbolic
 

4943
01:29:43,119 --> 01:29:44,590
confused some kind of symbolic
processing with language and symbolic

4944
01:29:44,590 --> 01:29:44,600
processing with language and symbolic
 

4945
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:47,030
processing with language and symbolic
processing is not the same so there are

4946
01:29:47,030 --> 01:29:47,040
processing is not the same so there are
 

4947
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:48,510
processing is not the same so there are
symbols and they have meaning but it's

4948
01:29:48,510 --> 01:29:48,520
symbols and they have meaning but it's
 

4949
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:50,669
symbols and they have meaning but it's
not language it's not a you know

4950
01:29:50,669 --> 01:29:50,679
not language it's not a you know
 

4951
01:29:50,679 --> 01:29:52,470
not language it's not a you know
conventionalized language system and so

4952
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:52,480
conventionalized language system and so
 

4953
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:54,870
conventionalized language system and so
Lang so math isn't there so they can do

4954
01:29:54,870 --> 01:29:54,880
Lang so math isn't there so they can do
 

4955
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:56,870
Lang so math isn't there so they can do
math they they do just as well as their

01:29:56,870 --> 01:29:56,880
math they they do just as well as their
 

4957
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:58,550
math they they do just as well as their
control age match controls and all these

4958
01:29:58,550 --> 01:29:58,560
control age match controls and all these
 

4959
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:01,109

bunch of patients who who she's shown
 

4965
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:07,310
bunch of patients who who she's shown
this that they're just um so that that

01:30:07,310 --> 01:30:07,320
this that they're just um so that that
 

4967
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:10,070
this that they're just um so that that
sort of combination suggests that

4968
01:30:10,070 --> 01:30:10,080
sort of combination suggests that
 

4969
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:12,590
sort of combination suggests that
language isn't necessary for thinking it

4970
01:30:12,590 --> 01:30:12,600
language isn't necessary for thinking it
 

4971
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:14,790
language isn't necessary for thinking it
it it doesn't mean you can't think in

4972
01:30:14,790 --> 01:30:14,800
it it doesn't mean you can't think in
 

4973
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,550
it it doesn't mean you can't think in
language you could think in language

4974
01:30:16,550 --> 01:30:16,560
language you could think in language
 

4975
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:17,750
language you could think in language
because language allows a lot of

4976
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:17,760
because language allows a lot of
 

4977
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:19,590
because language allows a lot of
expression but it's just you don't need

4978
01:30:19,590 --> 01:30:19,600
expression but it's just you don't need
 

4979
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:21,430
expression but it's just you don't need
it for thinking it's it suggests that

4980
01:30:21,430 --> 01:30:21,440
it for thinking it's it suggests that
 

4981
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:23,629
it for thinking it's it suggests that
language is separate is a separate

current theories of human language are
arguably large language models so this

4998
01:30:41,990 --> 01:30:42,000
arguably large language models so this
 

4999
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,310
arguably large language models so this

not a great Theory but it's a theory

01:31:25,790 --> 01:31:25,800
not a great Theory but it's a theory
 

5041

not a great Theory but it's a theory
it's a good theory in in one sense and

01:31:27,470 --> 01:31:27,480
it's a good theory in in one sense and
 

5043
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:29,070
it's a good theory in in one sense and
that it covers all the data like

01:31:29,070 --> 01:31:29,080
that it covers all the data like

01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:31,709
anything you want to say in English it

01:31:59,390 --> 01:31:59,400
set of rules something like a i it could
 

5073
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:02,149
set of rules something like a i it could
generate a a dependency grammar for a

5074
01:32:02,149 --> 01:32:02,159
generate a a dependency grammar for a
 

5075
01:32:02,159 --> 01:32:05,470
generate a a dependency grammar for a
language right yes you could

5076
01:32:05,470 --> 01:32:05,480
language right yes you could
 

5077
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:09,470
language right yes you could
probably uh you could probably just ask

5078
01:32:09,470 --> 01:32:09,480
probably uh you could probably just ask
 

5079
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:12,709
probably uh you could probably just ask
it about itself well you know that's I

5080
01:32:12,709 --> 01:32:12,719
it about itself well you know that's I
 

5081
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:14,550
it about itself well you know that's I
mean that

5082
01:32:14,550 --> 01:32:14,560
mean that
 

5083
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,830
mean that
presumes and there's some evidence for

5084
01:32:16,830 --> 01:32:16,840
presumes and there's some evidence for
 

5085
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:18,430
presumes and there's some evidence for
this that that that lar some large

5086
01:32:18,430 --> 01:32:18,440
this that that that lar some large
 

5087
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:20,510
this that that that lar some large
language models are implementing

5088
01:32:20,510 --> 01:32:20,520
language models are implementing
 

5089
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:22,510
language models are implementing
something like dependency grammar inside

5090
01:32:22,510 --> 01:32:22,520
something like dependency grammar inside
 

5091
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:24,590
something like dependency grammar inside
them and so there's work from a guy

5092
01:32:24,590 --> 01:32:24,600
them and so there's work from a guy
 

5093
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:26,550
them and so there's work from a guy
called Chris Manning and colleagues over

5094
01:32:26,550 --> 01:32:26,560
called Chris Manning and colleagues over
 

5095
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:30,430
called Chris Manning and colleagues over
at um Stanford in natural language and

5096
01:32:30,430 --> 01:32:30,440
at um Stanford in natural language and
 

5097
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:32,350
at um Stanford in natural language and
they looked at I don't know how many

5098
01:32:32,350 --> 01:32:32,360
they looked at I don't know how many
 

5099
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:34,070
they looked at I don't know how many
large language model types but certainly

5100
01:32:34,070 --> 01:32:34,080
large language model types but certainly
 

5101
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:36,750
large language model types but certainly
Bert and some others where and and where

5102
01:32:36,750 --> 01:32:36,760
Bert and some others where and and where
 

5103
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:39,109
Bert and some others where and and where
where you do some kind of fancy math to

5104
01:32:39,109 --> 01:32:39,119
where you do some kind of fancy math to
 

5105
01:32:39,119 --> 01:32:41,390
where you do some kind of fancy math to
figure out exactly what the sort of what

5106
01:32:41,390 --> 01:32:41,400
figure out exactly what the sort of what
 

5107
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:42,910
figure out exactly what the sort of what
kind of abstractions of representations

5108
01:32:42,910 --> 01:32:42,920
kind of abstractions of representations
 

5109
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:44,350
kind of abstractions of representations
are going on and they and they were

5110
01:32:44,350 --> 01:32:44,360
are going on and they and they were
 

5111
01:32:44,360 --> 01:32:45,990
are going on and they and they were
saying it does look like dependency

5112
01:32:45,990 --> 01:32:46,000
saying it does look like dependency
 

5113
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,270
saying it does look like dependency
structure is is what they're

5114
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:47,280
structure is is what they're
 

5115
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:49,229
structure is is what they're
constructing it doesn't like so it's

5116
01:32:49,229 --> 01:32:49,239
constructing it doesn't like so it's
 

5117
01:32:49,239 --> 01:32:51,149
constructing it doesn't like so it's
actually a very very good map so kind of

5118
01:32:51,149 --> 01:32:51,159
actually a very very good map so kind of
 

5119
01:32:51,159 --> 01:32:53,310
actually a very very good map so kind of
a they are constructing something like

5120
01:32:53,310 --> 01:32:53,320
a they are constructing something like
 

5121
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:54,950
a they are constructing something like
that

5122
01:32:54,950 --> 01:32:54,960
that
 

5123
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:57,149
that
um does it mean that you know that

5124
01:32:57,149 --> 01:32:57,159
um does it mean that you know that
 

5125
01:32:57,159 --> 01:32:59,350
um does it mean that you know that
they're using that for meaning I mean

5126
01:32:59,350 --> 01:32:59,360
they're using that for meaning I mean
 

5127
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:01,270
they're using that for meaning I mean
probably but we don't know you right

5128
01:33:01,270 --> 01:33:01,280
probably but we don't know you right
 

5129
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:03,149
probably but we don't know you right
that the kinds of theories of language

5130
01:33:03,149 --> 01:33:03,159
that the kinds of theories of language
 

5131
01:33:03,159 --> 01:33:06,149
that the kinds of theories of language
that llms are closest to are called

5132
01:33:06,149 --> 01:33:06,159
that llms are closest to are called
 

5133
01:33:06,159 --> 01:33:07,470
that llms are closest to are called
construction based theories can you

5134
01:33:07,470 --> 01:33:07,480
construction based theories can you
 

5135
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:09,030
construction based theories can you
explain what construction based theories

5136
01:33:09,030 --> 01:33:09,040
explain what construction based theories
 

5137
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:11,590
explain what construction based theories
are it's just a general theory of

5138
01:33:11,590 --> 01:33:11,600
are it's just a general theory of
 

5139
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:14,510
are it's just a general theory of
language such that uh there's a form and

5140
01:33:14,510 --> 01:33:14,520
language such that uh there's a form and
 

5141
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:17,270
language such that uh there's a form and
a meaning pair for um for lots of pieces

5142
01:33:17,270 --> 01:33:17,280
a meaning pair for um for lots of pieces
 

5143
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:19,510
a meaning pair for um for lots of pieces
of the language and so it's it's it's

5144
01:33:19,510 --> 01:33:19,520
of the language and so it's it's it's
 

5145
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:21,870
of the language and so it's it's it's
primarily usage based is a construction

5146
01:33:21,870 --> 01:33:21,880
primarily usage based is a construction
 

5147
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:23,590
primarily usage based is a construction
grammar it's just it's trying to deal

5148
01:33:23,590 --> 01:33:23,600
grammar it's just it's trying to deal
 

5149
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:26,510
grammar it's just it's trying to deal
with the things that people actually say

5150
01:33:26,510 --> 01:33:26,520
with the things that people actually say
 

5151
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:28,189
with the things that people actually say
actually say and actually write and so

5152
01:33:28,189 --> 01:33:28,199
actually say and actually write and so
 

5153
01:33:28,199 --> 01:33:31,390
actually say and actually write and so
that's it's a usage based idea and

5154
01:33:31,390 --> 01:33:31,400
that's it's a usage based idea and
 

5155
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:32,870
that's it's a usage based idea and
what's a Construction Construction is

5156
01:33:32,870 --> 01:33:32,880
what's a Construction Construction is
 

5157
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:35,189
what's a Construction Construction is
either a a simple word so like a a

5158
01:33:35,189 --> 01:33:35,199
either a a simple word so like a a
 

5159
01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:36,669
either a a simple word so like a a
morphine plus its meaning or a

5160
01:33:36,669 --> 01:33:36,679
morphine plus its meaning or a
 

5161
01:33:36,679 --> 01:33:39,430
morphine plus its meaning or a
combination of words it's basically

5162
01:33:39,430 --> 01:33:39,440
combination of words it's basically
 

5163
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:41,149
combination of words it's basically
combinations of words like the the rules

5164
01:33:41,149 --> 01:33:41,159
combinations of words like the the rules
 

5165
01:33:41,159 --> 01:33:46,550
combinations of words like the the rules
so but it's it's um it's uh un

5166
01:33:46,550 --> 01:33:46,560
so but it's it's um it's uh un
 

5167
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:49,149
so but it's it's um it's uh un
unspecified as to what the form of the

5168
01:33:49,149 --> 01:33:49,159
unspecified as to what the form of the
 

5169
01:33:49,159 --> 01:33:52,030
unspecified as to what the form of the
grammar is under underlyingly and so I I

5170
01:33:52,030 --> 01:33:52,040
grammar is under underlyingly and so I I
 

5171
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:54,229
grammar is under underlyingly and so I I
would I I would argue that dependency

5172
01:33:54,229 --> 01:33:54,239
would I I would argue that dependency
 

5173
01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:56,390
would I I would argue that dependency
grammar is maybe the the right form to

5174
01:33:56,390 --> 01:33:56,400
grammar is maybe the the right form to
 

5175
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:58,390
grammar is maybe the the right form to
use for the types of construction

5176
01:33:58,390 --> 01:33:58,400
use for the types of construction
 

5177
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:01,350
use for the types of construction
grammar construction grammar typically

5178
01:34:01,350 --> 01:34:01,360
grammar construction grammar typically
 

5179
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:03,870
grammar construction grammar typically
um isn't kind of formalized quite and so

5180
01:34:03,870 --> 01:34:03,880
um isn't kind of formalized quite and so
 

5181
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:06,109
um isn't kind of formalized quite and so
maybe the formalization a formalization

5182
01:34:06,109 --> 01:34:06,119
maybe the formalization a formalization
 

5183
01:34:06,119 --> 01:34:09,270
maybe the formalization a formalization
of that it might be independency grammar

5184
01:34:09,270 --> 01:34:09,280
of that it might be independency grammar
 

5185
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:12,550
of that it might be independency grammar
uh I mean I I would think so but I mean

5186
01:34:12,550 --> 01:34:12,560
uh I mean I I would think so but I mean
 

5187
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:14,189
uh I mean I I would think so but I mean
it's up to people other researchers in

5188
01:34:14,189 --> 01:34:14,199
it's up to people other researchers in
 

5189
01:34:14,199 --> 01:34:16,709
it's up to people other researchers in
that area if they agree or not so do you

5190
01:34:16,709 --> 01:34:16,719
that area if they agree or not so do you
 

5191
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:19,350
that area if they agree or not so do you
think that large language models

5192
01:34:19,350 --> 01:34:19,360
think that large language models
 

5193
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:21,870
think that large language models
understand language are they mimicking

5194
01:34:21,870 --> 01:34:21,880
understand language are they mimicking
 

5195
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:24,109
understand language are they mimicking
language I guess the deeper question

5196
01:34:24,109 --> 01:34:24,119
language I guess the deeper question
 

5197
01:34:24,119 --> 01:34:25,870
language I guess the deeper question
there is are they just understanding the

5198
01:34:25,870 --> 01:34:25,880
there is are they just understanding the
 

5199
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:29,189
there is are they just understanding the
surface form or do they understand

5200
01:34:29,189 --> 01:34:29,199
surface form or do they understand
 

5201
01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:31,709
surface form or do they understand
something deeper about the meaning that

5202
01:34:31,709 --> 01:34:31,719
something deeper about the meaning that
 

5203
01:34:31,719 --> 01:34:33,910
something deeper about the meaning that
then generates the form I mean I would

5204
01:34:33,910 --> 01:34:33,920
then generates the form I mean I would
 

5205
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:35,669
then generates the form I mean I would
argue they're doing the form they're

5206
01:34:35,669 --> 01:34:35,679
argue they're doing the form they're
 

5207
01:34:35,679 --> 01:34:36,910
argue they're doing the form they're
doing the form doing it really really

5208
01:34:36,910 --> 01:34:36,920
doing the form doing it really really
 

5209
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:38,830
doing the form doing it really really
well and uh are they doing the meaning

5210
01:34:38,830 --> 01:34:38,840
well and uh are they doing the meaning
 

5211
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:41,070
well and uh are they doing the meaning
no probably not I mean there's lots of

5212
01:34:41,070 --> 01:34:41,080
no probably not I mean there's lots of
 

5213
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:43,550
no probably not I mean there's lots of
these examples from various groups

5214
01:34:43,550 --> 01:34:43,560
these examples from various groups
 

5215
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:45,390
these examples from various groups
showing that they can be tricked in all

5216
01:34:45,390 --> 01:34:45,400
showing that they can be tricked in all
 

5217
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:46,910
showing that they can be tricked in all
kinds of ways they really don't

5218
01:34:46,910 --> 01:34:46,920
kinds of ways they really don't
 

5219
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:48,590
kinds of ways they really don't
understand the the meaning of what's

5220
01:34:48,590 --> 01:34:48,600
understand the the meaning of what's
 

5221
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:50,430
understand the the meaning of what's
going on and so there's a lot of

5222
01:34:50,430 --> 01:34:50,440
going on and so there's a lot of
 

5223
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:53,149
going on and so there's a lot of
examples that he and other groups have

5224
01:34:53,149 --> 01:34:53,159
examples that he and other groups have
 

5225
01:34:53,159 --> 01:34:54,510
examples that he and other groups have
given

5226
01:34:54,510 --> 01:34:54,520
given
 

5227
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:56,310
given
which just which show they don't really

5228
01:34:56,310 --> 01:34:56,320
which just which show they don't really
 

5229
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:57,510
which just which show they don't really
understand what's going on so you you

5230
01:34:57,510 --> 01:34:57,520
understand what's going on so you you
 

5231
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:59,550
understand what's going on so you you
know the Monty Hall problem is this

5232
01:34:59,550 --> 01:34:59,560
know the Monty Hall problem is this
 

5233
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:02,310
know the Monty Hall problem is this
silly problem right where you know if uh

5234
01:35:02,310 --> 01:35:02,320
silly problem right where you know if uh
 

5235
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:04,350
silly problem right where you know if uh
you have three door it's it's Let's Make

5236
01:35:04,350 --> 01:35:04,360
you have three door it's it's Let's Make
 

5237
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:06,910
you have three door it's it's Let's Make
a Deal is this old game show and there's

5238
01:35:06,910 --> 01:35:06,920
a Deal is this old game show and there's
 

5239
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:09,270
a Deal is this old game show and there's
three doors and there's a prize behind

5240
01:35:09,270 --> 01:35:09,280
three doors and there's a prize behind
 

5241
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:12,830
three doors and there's a prize behind
one and there's some junk prizes behind

5242
01:35:12,830 --> 01:35:12,840
one and there's some junk prizes behind
 

5243
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:13,870
one and there's some junk prizes behind
the other two and you're trying to

5244
01:35:13,870 --> 01:35:13,880
the other two and you're trying to
 

5245
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:17,149
the other two and you're trying to
select one and if you you know he knows

5246
01:35:17,149 --> 01:35:17,159
select one and if you you know he knows
 

5247
01:35:17,159 --> 01:35:19,910
select one and if you you know he knows
Monte he knows where the target item is

5248
01:35:19,910 --> 01:35:19,920
Monte he knows where the target item is
 

5249
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:21,430
Monte he knows where the target item is
the good thing he knows everything is

5250
01:35:21,430 --> 01:35:21,440
the good thing he knows everything is
 

5251
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:24,310
the good thing he knows everything is
back there and you're supposed to he he

5252
01:35:24,310 --> 01:35:24,320
back there and you're supposed to he he
 

5253
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:25,669
back there and you're supposed to he he
gives you a choice you choose one of the

5254
01:35:25,669 --> 01:35:25,679
gives you a choice you choose one of the
 

5255
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:27,669
gives you a choice you choose one of the
three and then he opens one of the doors

5256
01:35:27,669 --> 01:35:27,679
three and then he opens one of the doors
 

5257
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:29,550
three and then he opens one of the doors
and it's some junk prize and then the

5258
01:35:29,550 --> 01:35:29,560
and it's some junk prize and then the
 

5259
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:31,030
and it's some junk prize and then the
question is should you trade to get the

5260
01:35:31,030 --> 01:35:31,040
question is should you trade to get the
 

5261
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:32,550
question is should you trade to get the
other one and and the answer is yes you

5262
01:35:32,550 --> 01:35:32,560
other one and and the answer is yes you
 

5263
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,109
other one and and the answer is yes you
should trade because he knew which ones

5264
01:35:34,109 --> 01:35:34,119
should trade because he knew which ones
 

5265
01:35:34,119 --> 01:35:35,910
should trade because he knew which ones
you could turn around and so now the

5266
01:35:35,910 --> 01:35:35,920
you could turn around and so now the
 

5267
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:38,910
you could turn around and so now the
odds are 2third okay um and then if you

5268
01:35:38,910 --> 01:35:38,920
odds are 2third okay um and then if you
 

5269
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:40,350
odds are 2third okay um and then if you
just change that a little bit to the

5270
01:35:40,350 --> 01:35:40,360
just change that a little bit to the
 

5271
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:42,109
just change that a little bit to the

if you change the story it's a little

5278
01:35:48,109 --> 01:35:48,119
if you change the story it's a little
 

5279
01:35:48,119 --> 01:35:49,470
if you change the story it's a little
bit but it make it sound like it's the

5280
01:35:49,470 --> 01:35:49,480
bit but it make it sound like it's the
 

5281
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:51,510
bit but it make it sound like it's the
Monty Hall problem but it's not you just

5282
01:35:51,510 --> 01:35:51,520
Monty Hall problem but it's not you just
 

5283

behind there is a good prize and there's

5286
01:35:56,430 --> 01:35:56,440
behind there is a good prize and there's

the car is behind door number one so I'm
 

5293
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,830
the car is behind door number one so I'm
going to choose door number one Monty

Hall opens door number three and shows

5296
01:36:05,270 --> 01:36:05,280
Hall opens door number three and shows
 

5297
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:06,870

priz in door number one and then and

5302
01:36:10,270 --> 01:36:10,280
priz in door number one and then and
 

5303
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:12,070

then the large language Mar say yes you

5304
01:36:12,070 --> 01:36:12,080
then the large language Mar say yes you
 

5305
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:13,830
then the large language Mar say yes you
should trade because it's a it's it just

5306
01:36:13,830 --> 01:36:13,840
should trade because it's a it's it just

these cases where it yes you should
trade because you know your odds have

5314

01:36:28,430 --> 01:36:28,440
doesn't have any way to remember that
 

5321
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:31,109
doesn't have any way to remember that
actually you have 100% probability

5322
01:36:31,109 --> 01:36:31,119
actually you have 100% probability

actually you have 100% probability
behind that door number one you know

5324
01:36:32,390 --> 01:36:32,400
behind that door number one you know
 

5325
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:34,669
behind that door number one you know
that that's not part of the of the the

5326
01:36:34,669 --> 01:36:34,679
that that's not part of the of the the
 

5327
01:36:34,679 --> 01:36:36,590
that that's not part of the of the the
scheme that it's seen hundreds and

5328
01:36:36,590 --> 01:36:36,600
scheme that it's seen hundreds and
 

5329
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:38,430
scheme that it's seen hundreds and
hundreds of times before and so it can't

5330
01:36:38,430 --> 01:36:38,440
hundreds of times before and so it can't
 

5331
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:39,990
hundreds of times before and so it can't
you can't even if you tried to explain

5332
01:36:39,990 --> 01:36:40,000
you can't even if you tried to explain
 

5333
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,310
you can't even if you tried to explain
to it that it's wrong that they can't do

5334
01:36:42,310 --> 01:36:42,320
to it that it's wrong that they can't do
 

5335
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:44,950
to it that it's wrong that they can't do
that it'll just keep giving you back the

5336
01:36:44,950 --> 01:36:44,960
that it'll just keep giving you back the
 

5337
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:46,669
that it'll just keep giving you back the
the problem but it's also possible that

5338
01:36:46,669 --> 01:36:46,679
the problem but it's also possible that
 

5339
01:36:46,679 --> 01:36:48,229
the problem but it's also possible that
a larger language model would be aware

5340
01:36:48,229 --> 01:36:48,239
a larger language model would be aware
 

5341
01:36:48,239 --> 01:36:50,590
a larger language model would be aware
of the fact that there's sometimes over

5342
01:36:50,590 --> 01:36:50,600
of the fact that there's sometimes over
 

5343
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:54,189
of the fact that there's sometimes over
representation of a of a particular kind

5344
01:36:54,189 --> 01:36:54,199
representation of a of a particular kind
 

5345
01:36:54,199 --> 01:36:57,109
representation of a of a particular kind
of formulation MH and it's easy to get

5346
01:36:57,109 --> 01:36:57,119
of formulation MH and it's easy to get
 

5347
01:36:57,119 --> 01:37:00,229
of formulation MH and it's easy to get
tricked by that and so you could see if

5348
01:37:00,229 --> 01:37:00,239
tricked by that and so you could see if
 

5349
01:37:00,239 --> 01:37:03,030
tricked by that and so you could see if
they get larger and larger models be a

5350
01:37:03,030 --> 01:37:03,040
they get larger and larger models be a
 

5351
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:05,669
they get larger and larger models be a
little bit more skeptical so you see a

5352
01:37:05,669 --> 01:37:05,679
little bit more skeptical so you see a
 

5353
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:07,669
little bit more skeptical so you see a
over representation so like you it just

5354
01:37:07,669 --> 01:37:07,679
over representation so like you it just
 

5355
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:09,629
over representation so like you it just
feels like form

5356
01:37:09,629 --> 01:37:09,639
feels like form
 

5357
01:37:09,639 --> 01:37:15,149

can training on form can go really far

5358
01:37:15,149 --> 01:37:15,159

that's humans too so it just seems
 

5381
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:50,830
that's humans too so it just seems
really impressive how often it seems

5382
01:37:50,830 --> 01:37:50,840
really impressive how often it seems
 

5383
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:54,310
really impressive how often it seems
like it understands Concepts

5384
01:37:54,310 --> 01:37:54,320
like it understands Concepts
 

5385
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:56,189
like it understands Concepts
I I mean you don't have to convince me

5386
01:37:56,189 --> 01:37:56,199
I I mean you don't have to convince me
 

5387
01:37:56,199 --> 01:37:58,910
I I mean you don't have to convince me
of that I'm I am very very impressed but

5388
01:37:58,910 --> 01:37:58,920
of that I'm I am very very impressed but
 

5389
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:01,229
of that I'm I am very very impressed but
does it does do I mean you're you're

5390
01:38:01,229 --> 01:38:01,239
does it does do I mean you're you're
 

5391
01:38:01,239 --> 01:38:03,709
does it does do I mean you're you're
giving a possible world where maybe

5392
01:38:03,709 --> 01:38:03,719
giving a possible world where maybe
 

5393
01:38:03,719 --> 01:38:04,950
giving a possible world where maybe
someone's going to train some other

5394
01:38:04,950 --> 01:38:04,960
someone's going to train some other
 

5395
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:06,870
someone's going to train some other
version such that it'll be somehow

5396
01:38:06,870 --> 01:38:06,880
version such that it'll be somehow
 

5397
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:10,030
version such that it'll be somehow
abstracting away from types of forms I I

5398
01:38:10,030 --> 01:38:10,040
abstracting away from types of forms I I
 

5399
01:38:10,040 --> 01:38:12,229
abstracting away from types of forms I I
mean I don't think that's happened and

5400
01:38:12,229 --> 01:38:12,239
mean I don't think that's happened and
 

5401
01:38:12,239 --> 01:38:15,270
mean I don't think that's happened and
so well no no no I I'm not saying that I

5402
01:38:15,270 --> 01:38:15,280
so well no no no I I'm not saying that I
 

5403
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:16,510
so well no no no I I'm not saying that I
I I think when you just look at

5404
01:38:16,510 --> 01:38:16,520
I I think when you just look at
 

5405
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:19,070
I I think when you just look at
anecdotal examples and just showing a

5406
01:38:19,070 --> 01:38:19,080
anecdotal examples and just showing a
 

5407
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:20,470
anecdotal examples and just showing a
large number of them where it doesn't

5408
01:38:20,470 --> 01:38:20,480
large number of them where it doesn't
 

5409
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:22,350
large number of them where it doesn't
seem to understand yeah it's easily

5410
01:38:22,350 --> 01:38:22,360
seem to understand yeah it's easily
 

5411
01:38:22,360 --> 01:38:25,030
seem to understand yeah it's easily
fooled yes does not seem like a

5412
01:38:25,030 --> 01:38:25,040
fooled yes does not seem like a
 

5413
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:29,070
fooled yes does not seem like a
scientific um data driven like analysis

5414
01:38:29,070 --> 01:38:29,080
scientific um data driven like analysis
 

5415
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:31,510
scientific um data driven like analysis
of like how many places is a damn

5416
01:38:31,510 --> 01:38:31,520
of like how many places is a damn
 

5417
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:33,709
of like how many places is a damn
impressive in terms of meaning and

5418
01:38:33,709 --> 01:38:33,719
impressive in terms of meaning and
 

5419
01:38:33,719 --> 01:38:34,990
impressive in terms of meaning and
understanding and how many places is

5420
01:38:34,990 --> 01:38:35,000
understanding and how many places is
 

5421
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,229
understanding and how many places is
easily fooled and like that's not the

5422
01:38:37,229 --> 01:38:37,239
easily fooled and like that's not the
 

5423
01:38:37,239 --> 01:38:38,870
easily fooled and like that's not the
inference yeah so I don't want to make

5424
01:38:38,870 --> 01:38:38,880
inference yeah so I don't want to make
 

5425
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:40,390
inference yeah so I don't want to make
that the inference I don't I wouldn't

5426
01:38:40,390 --> 01:38:40,400
that the inference I don't I wouldn't
 

5427
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:41,990
that the inference I don't I wouldn't
want to make was that in the inference

5428
01:38:41,990 --> 01:38:42,000
want to make was that in the inference
 

5429
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,910
want to make was that in the inference
I'm trying to push is just that is it is

5430
01:38:44,910 --> 01:38:44,920
I'm trying to push is just that is it is
 

5431
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:46,629
I'm trying to push is just that is it is
it like humans here it's probably not

5432
01:38:46,629 --> 01:38:46,639
it like humans here it's probably not
 

5433
01:38:46,639 --> 01:38:48,950
it like humans here it's probably not
like humans here it's different so

5434
01:38:48,950 --> 01:38:48,960
like humans here it's different so
 

5435
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:50,470
like humans here it's different so
humans don't make that error if you

5436
01:38:50,470 --> 01:38:50,480
humans don't make that error if you
 

5437
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:51,790
humans don't make that error if you
explain that to them they're not going

5438
01:38:51,790 --> 01:38:51,800
explain that to them they're not going
 

5439
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:53,750
explain that to them they're not going
to make that error you know they don't

5440
01:38:53,750 --> 01:38:53,760
to make that error you know they don't
 

5441
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:55,070
to make that error you know they don't
make that error and so that's something

5442
01:38:55,070 --> 01:38:55,080
make that error and so that's something
 

5443
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:56,589
make that error and so that's something
it's doing something different from

5444
01:38:56,589 --> 01:38:56,599
it's doing something different from
 

5445
01:38:56,599 --> 01:38:58,030
it's doing something different from
humans are that they're doing in that

5446
01:38:58,030 --> 01:38:58,040
humans are that they're doing in that
 

5447
01:38:58,040 --> 01:39:00,350
humans are that they're doing in that
case what what what's the mechanism by

5448
01:39:00,350 --> 01:39:00,360
case what what what's the mechanism by
 

5449
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:01,629
case what what what's the mechanism by
which humans figure out that it's an

5450
01:39:01,629 --> 01:39:01,639
which humans figure out that it's an
 

5451
01:39:01,639 --> 01:39:03,830
which humans figure out that it's an
error I'm just saying the error there is

5452
01:39:03,830 --> 01:39:03,840
error I'm just saying the error there is
 

5453
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:05,830
error I'm just saying the error there is
like if I explain to you there's 100%

5454
01:39:05,830 --> 01:39:05,840
like if I explain to you there's 100%
 

5455
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:08,589
like if I explain to you there's 100%
chance that the car is behind this case

5456
01:39:08,589 --> 01:39:08,599
chance that the car is behind this case
 

5457
01:39:08,599 --> 01:39:10,790
chance that the car is behind this case
this door will do you want to trade

5458
01:39:10,790 --> 01:39:10,800
this door will do you want to trade
 

5459
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:13,149
this door will do you want to trade
people say no but this thing will say

5460
01:39:13,149 --> 01:39:13,159
people say no but this thing will say
 

5461
01:39:13,159 --> 01:39:15,390
people say no but this thing will say
yes because it's so trick it's that that

5462
01:39:15,390 --> 01:39:15,400
yes because it's so trick it's that that
 

5463
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:18,669
yes because it's so trick it's that that
trick it's so wound up on the form that

5464
01:39:18,669 --> 01:39:18,679
trick it's so wound up on the form that
 

5465
01:39:18,679 --> 01:39:21,149
trick it's so wound up on the form that
it's that that's an error that a human

5466
01:39:21,149 --> 01:39:21,159
it's that that's an error that a human
 

5467
01:39:21,159 --> 01:39:22,430
it's that that's an error that a human
doesn't make which is kind of

5468
01:39:22,430 --> 01:39:22,440
doesn't make which is kind of
 

5469
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:24,550
doesn't make which is kind of
interesting less likely to make I should

5470
01:39:24,550 --> 01:39:24,560
interesting less likely to make I should
 

5471
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:27,270
interesting less likely to make I should
say yeah less likely because like humans

5472
01:39:27,270 --> 01:39:27,280
say yeah less likely because like humans
 

5473
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:31,430
say yeah less likely because like humans
are very oh yeah you're asking you know

5474
01:39:31,430 --> 01:39:31,440
are very oh yeah you're asking you know
 

5475
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:33,550
are very oh yeah you're asking you know
you're asking humans to you're asking a

5476
01:39:33,550 --> 01:39:33,560
you're asking humans to you're asking a
 

5477
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:35,910
you're asking humans to you're asking a
system to understand 100% like you're

5478
01:39:35,910 --> 01:39:35,920
system to understand 100% like you're
 

5479
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:39,109
system to understand 100% like you're
asking some mathematical Concepts and so

5480
01:39:39,109 --> 01:39:39,119
asking some mathematical Concepts and so
 

5481
01:39:39,119 --> 01:39:41,109
asking some mathematical Concepts and so
like look the places where large

5482
01:39:41,109 --> 01:39:41,119
like look the places where large
 

5483
01:39:41,119 --> 01:39:43,750
like look the places where large
language models are the form is amazing

5484
01:39:43,750 --> 01:39:43,760
language models are the form is amazing
 

5485
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:46,870
language models are the form is amazing
so let's go back to nested structure

5486
01:39:46,870 --> 01:39:46,880
so let's go back to nested structure
 

5487
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:48,709
so let's go back to nested structure
Center embedded structures okay if you

5488
01:39:48,709 --> 01:39:48,719
Center embedded structures okay if you
 

5489
01:39:48,719 --> 01:39:50,430
Center embedded structures okay if you
ask a human to complete those they can't

5490
01:39:50,430 --> 01:39:50,440
ask a human to complete those they can't
 

5491
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:52,310
ask a human to complete those they can't
do it neither can a l large language

5492
01:39:52,310 --> 01:39:52,320
do it neither can a l large language
 

5493
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,629
do it neither can a l large language
model they're just like humans in that

5494
01:39:54,629 --> 01:39:54,639
model they're just like humans in that
 

5495
01:39:54,639 --> 01:39:56,390
model they're just like humans in that
if you ask if I ask a large language

5496
01:39:56,390 --> 01:39:56,400
if you ask if I ask a large language
 

5497
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:58,510
if you ask if I ask a large language
model that's fascinating by the way that

5498
01:39:58,510 --> 01:39:58,520
model that's fascinating by the way that
 

5499
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:00,070
model that's fascinating by the way that
the central embedding the central

5500
01:40:00,070 --> 01:40:00,080
the central embedding the central
 

5501
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:01,990
the central embedding the central
embedding is is it struggles with just

5502
01:40:01,990 --> 01:40:02,000
embedding is is it struggles with just
 

5503
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,109
embedding is is it struggles with just
like exactly like humans exactly the

5504
01:40:04,109 --> 01:40:04,119
like exactly like humans exactly the
 

5505
01:40:04,119 --> 01:40:05,750
like exactly like humans exactly the
same way as humans they and that's not

5506
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:05,760
same way as humans they and that's not
 

5507
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:08,629
same way as humans they and that's not
trained so they do exactly so there so

5508
01:40:08,629 --> 01:40:08,639
trained so they do exactly so there so
 

5509
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:11,070
trained so they do exactly so there so
that is a similarity so but then it's

5510
01:40:11,070 --> 01:40:11,080
that is a similarity so but then it's
 

5511
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:13,629
that is a similarity so but then it's
it's that's not meaning right this is

5512
01:40:13,629 --> 01:40:13,639
it's that's not meaning right this is
 

5513
01:40:13,639 --> 01:40:15,830
it's that's not meaning right this is
form but when we get into meaning this

5514
01:40:15,830 --> 01:40:15,840
form but when we get into meaning this
 

5515
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:17,669
form but when we get into meaning this
is where they get kind of messed up when

5516
01:40:17,669 --> 01:40:17,679
is where they get kind of messed up when
 

5517
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:19,390
is where they get kind of messed up when
you start to saying oh what's behind

5518
01:40:19,390 --> 01:40:19,400
you start to saying oh what's behind
 

5519
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:21,350
you start to saying oh what's behind
this door oh it's you know this is the

5520
01:40:21,350 --> 01:40:21,360
this door oh it's you know this is the
 

5521
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:23,550
this door oh it's you know this is the
thing I want humans don't mess that that

5522
01:40:23,550 --> 01:40:23,560
thing I want humans don't mess that that
 

5523
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:25,950
thing I want humans don't mess that that
up as much you know here they they the

5524
01:40:25,950 --> 01:40:25,960
up as much you know here they they the
 

5525
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:28,109
up as much you know here they they the
form is it's just like the form of the

5526
01:40:28,109 --> 01:40:28,119
form is it's just like the form of the
 

5527
01:40:28,119 --> 01:40:30,990
form is it's just like the form of the
match is amazing is similar without

5528
01:40:30,990 --> 01:40:31,000
match is amazing is similar without
 

5529
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:32,550
match is amazing is similar without
being trained to do that I mean it's

5530
01:40:32,550 --> 01:40:32,560
being trained to do that I mean it's
 

5531
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:33,870
being trained to do that I mean it's
trained in the sense that it's getting

5532
01:40:33,870 --> 01:40:33,880
trained in the sense that it's getting
 

5533
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:35,550
trained in the sense that it's getting
lots of data which is just like human

5534
01:40:35,550 --> 01:40:35,560
lots of data which is just like human
 

5535
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:39,030
lots of data which is just like human
data but it's not being trained on uh

5536
01:40:39,030 --> 01:40:39,040
data but it's not being trained on uh
 

5537
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:41,350
data but it's not being trained on uh
you know bad sentences and being told

5538
01:40:41,350 --> 01:40:41,360
you know bad sentences and being told
 

5539
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:43,149
you know bad sentences and being told
what's bad it just can't do those it'll

5540
01:40:43,149 --> 01:40:43,159
what's bad it just can't do those it'll
 

5541
01:40:43,159 --> 01:40:45,629
what's bad it just can't do those it'll
actually say things like those are too

5542
01:40:45,629 --> 01:40:45,639
actually say things like those are too
 

5543
01:40:45,639 --> 01:40:47,390
actually say things like those are too
hard for me to complete or something

5544
01:40:47,390 --> 01:40:47,400
hard for me to complete or something
 

5545
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:49,030
hard for me to complete or something
which is kind of interesting actually

5546
01:40:49,030 --> 01:40:49,040
which is kind of interesting actually
 

5547
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:50,109
which is kind of interesting actually
kind of how does it know that I don't

5548
01:40:50,109 --> 01:40:50,119
kind of how does it know that I don't
 

5549
01:40:50,119 --> 01:40:54,550
kind of how does it know that I don't
know oh but it really often doesn't just

5550
01:40:54,550 --> 01:40:54,560
know oh but it really often doesn't just
 

5551
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:57,709
know oh but it really often doesn't just
complete sense it off very often says

5552
01:40:57,709 --> 01:40:57,719
complete sense it off very often says
 

5553
01:40:57,719 --> 01:40:59,270
complete sense it off very often says
stuff that's true

5554
01:40:59,270 --> 01:40:59,280
stuff that's true
 

5555
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:02,109
stuff that's true
MH and sometimes says stuff that's not

5556
01:41:02,109 --> 01:41:02,119
MH and sometimes says stuff that's not
 

5557
01:41:02,119 --> 01:41:05,750
MH and sometimes says stuff that's not
true and almost always the form is great

5558
01:41:05,750 --> 01:41:05,760
true and almost always the form is great
 

5559
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:09,790
true and almost always the form is great
yeah but it's still very surprising that

5560
01:41:09,790 --> 01:41:09,800
yeah but it's still very surprising that
 

5561
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:11,629
yeah but it's still very surprising that
with really great form it's able to

5562
01:41:11,629 --> 01:41:11,639
with really great form it's able to
 

5563
01:41:11,639 --> 01:41:13,950
with really great form it's able to
generate a lot of things that are

5564
01:41:13,950 --> 01:41:13,960
generate a lot of things that are
 

5565
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:16,229
generate a lot of things that are
true based on what it's trained on and

5566
01:41:16,229 --> 01:41:16,239
true based on what it's trained on and
 

5567
01:41:16,239 --> 01:41:18,910
true based on what it's trained on and
so on so it's not just it's not just

5568
01:41:18,910 --> 01:41:18,920
so on so it's not just it's not just
 

5569
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:23,709
so on so it's not just it's not just
form that is generating it's mimicking

5570
01:41:23,709 --> 01:41:23,719
form that is generating it's mimicking
 

5571
01:41:23,719 --> 01:41:25,030
form that is generating it's mimicking
true statements that's right that's

5572
01:41:25,030 --> 01:41:25,040
true statements that's right that's
 

5573
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:27,030
true statements that's right that's
right from the internet I guess I guess

5574
01:41:27,030 --> 01:41:27,040
right from the internet I guess I guess
 

5575
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:28,790
right from the internet I guess I guess
the underlying idea there is that on the

5576
01:41:28,790 --> 01:41:28,800
the underlying idea there is that on the
 

5577
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:32,270
the underlying idea there is that on the
internet truth is over represented

5578
01:41:32,270 --> 01:41:32,280
internet truth is over represented
 

5579
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:33,709
internet truth is over represented
versus falsehoods I think that's

5580
01:41:33,709 --> 01:41:33,719
versus falsehoods I think that's
 

5581
01:41:33,719 --> 01:41:35,990
versus falsehoods I think that's
probably right yeah so but the the the

5582
01:41:35,990 --> 01:41:36,000
probably right yeah so but the the the
 

5583
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,350
probably right yeah so but the the the
fundamental thing is trained on you're

5584
01:41:37,350 --> 01:41:37,360
fundamental thing is trained on you're
 

5585
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:40,750
fundamental thing is trained on you're
saying is just form it's I think so yeah

5586
01:41:40,750 --> 01:41:40,760
saying is just form it's I think so yeah
 

5587
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:44,109
saying is just form it's I think so yeah
yeah I think so uh well that's a sad if

5588
01:41:44,109 --> 01:41:44,119
yeah I think so uh well that's a sad if
 

5589
01:41:44,119 --> 01:41:45,470
yeah I think so uh well that's a sad if
that's to me that's still a little bit

5590
01:41:45,470 --> 01:41:45,480
that's to me that's still a little bit
 

5591
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:48,189
that's to me that's still a little bit
of an open question I probably lean

5592
01:41:48,189 --> 01:41:48,199
of an open question I probably lean
 

5593
01:41:48,199 --> 01:41:51,910
of an open question I probably lean
agreeing with you uh especially now you

5594
01:41:51,910 --> 01:41:51,920
agreeing with you uh especially now you
 

5595
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:53,790
agreeing with you uh especially now you
just blown my mind that there's a

5596
01:41:53,790 --> 01:41:53,800
just blown my mind that there's a
 

5597
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:55,350
just blown my mind that there's a
separate module in the brain for

5598
01:41:55,350 --> 01:41:55,360
separate module in the brain for
 

5599
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:57,470
separate module in the brain for
language versus

5600
01:41:57,470 --> 01:41:57,480
language versus
 

5601
01:41:57,480 --> 01:41:59,910
language versus
thinking maybe there's a fundamental

5602
01:41:59,910 --> 01:41:59,920
thinking maybe there's a fundamental
 

5603
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:02,390
thinking maybe there's a fundamental
part missing from the large language

5604
01:42:02,390 --> 01:42:02,400
part missing from the large language
 

5605
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:03,350
part missing from the large language
model

5606
01:42:03,350 --> 01:42:03,360
model
 

5607
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:05,830
model
approach that lacks the thinking the

5608
01:42:05,830 --> 01:42:05,840
approach that lacks the thinking the
 

5609
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:07,390
approach that lacks the thinking the
reasoning

5610
01:42:07,390 --> 01:42:07,400
reasoning
 

5611
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:10,030
reasoning
capability yeah that's what this group

5612
01:42:10,030 --> 01:42:10,040
capability yeah that's what this group
 

5613
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:13,430
capability yeah that's what this group
argues so the the same group feder Enos

5614
01:42:13,430 --> 01:42:13,440
argues so the the same group feder Enos
 

5615
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:16,109
argues so the the same group feder Enos
group has a recent paper arguing exactly

5616
01:42:16,109 --> 01:42:16,119
group has a recent paper arguing exactly
 

5617
01:42:16,119 --> 01:42:19,229
group has a recent paper arguing exactly
that there a guy called Kyle Mell who's

5618
01:42:19,229 --> 01:42:19,239
that there a guy called Kyle Mell who's
 

5619
01:42:19,239 --> 01:42:21,510
that there a guy called Kyle Mell who's
here in Austin Texas actually he's an

5620
01:42:21,510 --> 01:42:21,520
here in Austin Texas actually he's an
 

5621
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:23,709
here in Austin Texas actually he's an
old student of mine but he's a in

5622
01:42:23,709 --> 01:42:23,719
old student of mine but he's a in
 

5623
01:42:23,719 --> 01:42:25,470
old student of mine but he's a in
linguistics at Texas and he was the

5624
01:42:25,470 --> 01:42:25,480
linguistics at Texas and he was the
 

5625
01:42:25,480 --> 01:42:28,629
linguistics at Texas and he was the
first author on that that's fascinating

5626
01:42:28,629 --> 01:42:28,639
first author on that that's fascinating
 

5627
01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:31,350
first author on that that's fascinating
still to me an open question yeah what

5628
01:42:31,350 --> 01:42:31,360
still to me an open question yeah what
 

5629
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:32,510
still to me an open question yeah what
do you are the interesting limits of

5630
01:42:32,510 --> 01:42:32,520
do you are the interesting limits of
 

5631
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:36,669
do you are the interesting limits of
llms you know I I don't see any limits

5632
01:42:36,669 --> 01:42:36,679
llms you know I I don't see any limits
 

5633
01:42:36,679 --> 01:42:39,390
llms you know I I don't see any limits
to their form their form is impressive

5634
01:42:39,390 --> 01:42:39,400
to their form their form is impressive
 

5635
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:41,070
to their form their form is impressive
perect yeah yeah yeah it's pretty I mean

5636
01:42:41,070 --> 01:42:41,080
perect yeah yeah yeah it's pretty I mean
 

5637
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:42,790
perect yeah yeah yeah it's pretty I mean
it's close to being well you said

5638
01:42:42,790 --> 01:42:42,800
it's close to being well you said
 

5639
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:45,109
it's close to being well you said
ability to complete Central embeddings

5640
01:42:45,109 --> 01:42:45,119
ability to complete Central embeddings
 

5641
01:42:45,119 --> 01:42:46,910
ability to complete Central embeddings
yeah it's just the same as humans it

5642
01:42:46,910 --> 01:42:46,920
yeah it's just the same as humans it
 

5643
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:48,589
yeah it's just the same as humans it
seems the same as but that's not perfect

5644
01:42:48,589 --> 01:42:48,599
seems the same as but that's not perfect
 

5645
01:42:48,599 --> 01:42:50,830
seems the same as but that's not perfect
right it should be that's good no but I

5646
01:42:50,830 --> 01:42:50,840
right it should be that's good no but I
 

5647
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:52,550
right it should be that's good no but I
want to be like humans I I'm trying to I

5648
01:42:52,550 --> 01:42:52,560
want to be like humans I I'm trying to I
 

5649
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:55,270
want to be like humans I I'm trying to I
want a model of humans but but but oh

5650
01:42:55,270 --> 01:42:55,280
want a model of humans but but but oh
 

5651
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:57,470
want a model of humans but but but oh
wait wait wait oh so perfect use is uh

5652
01:42:57,470 --> 01:42:57,480
wait wait wait oh so perfect use is uh
 

5653
01:42:57,480 --> 01:42:59,350
wait wait wait oh so perfect use is uh
as close to humans as possible I got it

5654
01:42:59,350 --> 01:42:59,360
as close to humans as possible I got it
 

5655
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:01,470
as close to humans as possible I got it
yeah but you should be able to if you're

5656
01:43:01,470 --> 01:43:01,480
yeah but you should be able to if you're
 

5657
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:03,229
yeah but you should be able to if you're
not human you're like you're super human

5658
01:43:03,229 --> 01:43:03,239
not human you're like you're super human
 

5659
01:43:03,239 --> 01:43:04,510
not human you're like you're super human
you should be able to complete Central

5660
01:43:04,510 --> 01:43:04,520
you should be able to complete Central
 

5661
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:07,750
you should be able to complete Central
embedded sentences right I mean that's

5662
01:43:07,750 --> 01:43:07,760
embedded sentences right I mean that's
 

5663
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:10,589
embedded sentences right I mean that's
the the mechanism is if it's modeling

5664
01:43:10,589 --> 01:43:10,599
the the mechanism is if it's modeling
 

5665
01:43:10,599 --> 01:43:12,310
the the mechanism is if it's modeling
some I think it's kind of really

5666
01:43:12,310 --> 01:43:12,320
some I think it's kind of really
 

5667
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:13,910
some I think it's kind of really
interesting that it it's really

5668
01:43:13,910 --> 01:43:13,920
interesting that it it's really
 

5669
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:15,589
interesting that it it's really
interesting it's more like like I think

5670
01:43:15,589 --> 01:43:15,599
interesting it's more like like I think
 

5671
01:43:15,599 --> 01:43:18,589
interesting it's more like like I think
it's potentially underlyingly modeling

5672
01:43:18,589 --> 01:43:18,599
it's potentially underlyingly modeling
 

5673
01:43:18,599 --> 01:43:20,870
it's potentially underlyingly modeling
something like what the the way the form

5674
01:43:20,870 --> 01:43:20,880
something like what the the way the form
 

5675
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:23,109
something like what the the way the form
is processed the form of human language

5676
01:43:23,109 --> 01:43:23,119
is processed the form of human language
 

5677
01:43:23,119 --> 01:43:25,629
is processed the form of human language
the way how and how humans process the

5678
01:43:25,629 --> 01:43:25,639
the way how and how humans process the
 

5679
01:43:25,639 --> 01:43:27,910
the way how and how humans process the
language yes I think that's plausible

5680
01:43:27,910 --> 01:43:27,920
language yes I think that's plausible
 

5681
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:29,750
language yes I think that's plausible
and how they generate language process

5682
01:43:29,750 --> 01:43:29,760
and how they generate language process
 

5683
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:30,910
and how they generate language process
language and generate language that's

5684
01:43:30,910 --> 01:43:30,920
language and generate language that's
 

5685
01:43:30,920 --> 01:43:34,270
language and generate language that's
FAS yeah so in that sense they're

5686
01:43:34,270 --> 01:43:34,280
FAS yeah so in that sense they're
 

5687
01:43:34,280 --> 01:43:36,390
FAS yeah so in that sense they're
perfect if we can just Linger on the

5688
01:43:36,390 --> 01:43:36,400
perfect if we can just Linger on the
 

5689
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:39,229
perfect if we can just Linger on the
center embedding thing that's hard for

5690
01:43:39,229 --> 01:43:39,239
center embedding thing that's hard for
 

5691
01:43:39,239 --> 01:43:41,070
center embedding thing that's hard for
LMS produce and that seems really

5692
01:43:41,070 --> 01:43:41,080
LMS produce and that seems really
 

5693
01:43:41,080 --> 01:43:42,709
LMS produce and that seems really
impressive cuz that's hard for humans to

5694
01:43:42,709 --> 01:43:42,719
impressive cuz that's hard for humans to
 

5695
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:46,310
impressive cuz that's hard for humans to
produce and how does that connect to the

5696
01:43:46,310 --> 01:43:46,320
produce and how does that connect to the
 

5697
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:48,709
produce and how does that connect to the
thing we've been talking about before

5698
01:43:48,709 --> 01:43:48,719
thing we've been talking about before
 

5699
01:43:48,719 --> 01:43:50,830
thing we've been talking about before
which is the dependency grammar

5700
01:43:50,830 --> 01:43:50,840
which is the dependency grammar
 

5701
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:53,189
which is the dependency grammar
framework in which you view language and

5702
01:43:53,189 --> 01:43:53,199
framework in which you view language and
 

5703
01:43:53,199 --> 01:43:55,830
framework in which you view language and
the finding that uh short dependencies

5704
01:43:55,830 --> 01:43:55,840
the finding that uh short dependencies
 

5705
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:58,870
the finding that uh short dependencies
seem to be a universal part of language

5706
01:43:58,870 --> 01:43:58,880
seem to be a universal part of language
 

5707
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:01,189
seem to be a universal part of language
so why is it hard to complete Center

5708
01:44:01,189 --> 01:44:01,199
so why is it hard to complete Center
 

5709
01:44:01,199 --> 01:44:03,270
so why is it hard to complete Center
embeddings so what I like about

5710
01:44:03,270 --> 01:44:03,280
embeddings so what I like about
 

5711
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:07,070
embeddings so what I like about
dependency grammar is it

5712
01:44:07,070 --> 01:44:07,080
dependency grammar is it
 

5713
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:11,470
dependency grammar is it
makes the cognitive cost associated with

5714
01:44:11,470 --> 01:44:11,480
makes the cognitive cost associated with
 

5715
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:13,870
makes the cognitive cost associated with
long longer distance connections very

5716
01:44:13,870 --> 01:44:13,880
long longer distance connections very
 

5717
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:16,109
long longer distance connections very
transparent Bas there's some there turns

5718
01:44:16,109 --> 01:44:16,119
transparent Bas there's some there turns
 

5719
01:44:16,119 --> 01:44:18,189
transparent Bas there's some there turns
out there is a cost associated with

5720
01:44:18,189 --> 01:44:18,199
out there is a cost associated with
 

5721
01:44:18,199 --> 01:44:20,910
out there is a cost associated with
producing and comprehending connections

5722
01:44:20,910 --> 01:44:20,920
producing and comprehending connections
 

5723
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:23,229
producing and comprehending connections
between Words which are just not besided

5724
01:44:23,229 --> 01:44:23,239
between Words which are just not besided
 

5725
01:44:23,239 --> 01:44:24,790
between Words which are just not besided
other the further apart they are the

5726
01:44:24,790 --> 01:44:24,800
other the further apart they are the
 

5727
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:27,669
other the further apart they are the
worse it is the the according to well we

5728
01:44:27,669 --> 01:44:27,679
worse it is the the according to well we
 

5729
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:29,550
worse it is the the according to well we
can measure that and there is a cost

5730
01:44:29,550 --> 01:44:29,560
can measure that and there is a cost
 

5731
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:31,910
can measure that and there is a cost
associated with that can you just Linger

5732
01:44:31,910 --> 01:44:31,920
associated with that can you just Linger
 

5733
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:34,189
associated with that can you just Linger
on what do you mean by cognitive cost

5734
01:44:34,189 --> 01:44:34,199
on what do you mean by cognitive cost
 

5735
01:44:34,199 --> 01:44:35,510
on what do you mean by cognitive cost
and how do you measure oh well you can

5736
01:44:35,510 --> 01:44:35,520
and how do you measure oh well you can
 

5737
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:37,149
and how do you measure oh well you can
measure it in a lot of ways uh the

5738
01:44:37,149 --> 01:44:37,159
measure it in a lot of ways uh the
 

5739
01:44:37,159 --> 01:44:40,229
measure it in a lot of ways uh the
simplest is just asking people to say

5740
01:44:40,229 --> 01:44:40,239
simplest is just asking people to say
 

5741
01:44:40,239 --> 01:44:41,990
simplest is just asking people to say
whether you know how good a sentence

5742
01:44:41,990 --> 01:44:42,000
whether you know how good a sentence
 

5743
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,149
whether you know how good a sentence
sounds just ask that's one way to

5744
01:44:44,149 --> 01:44:44,159
sounds just ask that's one way to
 

5745
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:46,070
sounds just ask that's one way to
measure and you you try to like

5746
01:44:46,070 --> 01:44:46,080
measure and you you try to like
 

5747
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:48,189
measure and you you try to like
triangulate then across sentences and

5748
01:44:48,189 --> 01:44:48,199
triangulate then across sentences and
 

5749
01:44:48,199 --> 01:44:49,750
triangulate then across sentences and
across structures to try to figure out

5750
01:44:49,750 --> 01:44:49,760
across structures to try to figure out
 

5751
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:51,430
across structures to try to figure out
what the source of that is you can look

5752
01:44:51,430 --> 01:44:51,440
what the source of that is you can look
 

5753
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:55,589
what the source of that is you can look
at um reading times in controlled

5754
01:44:55,589 --> 01:44:55,599
at um reading times in controlled
 

5755
01:44:55,599 --> 01:44:57,470
at um reading times in controlled
materials you know so in certain kinds

5756
01:44:57,470 --> 01:44:57,480
materials you know so in certain kinds
 

5757
01:44:57,480 --> 01:44:59,189
materials you know so in certain kinds
of materials when they and then we can

5758
01:44:59,189 --> 01:44:59,199
of materials when they and then we can
 

5759
01:44:59,199 --> 01:45:01,189
of materials when they and then we can
like measure the dependency distances

5760
01:45:01,189 --> 01:45:01,199
like measure the dependency distances
 

5761
01:45:01,199 --> 01:45:04,390
like measure the dependency distances
there we can there's a recent study

5762
01:45:04,390 --> 01:45:04,400
there we can there's a recent study
 

5763
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:06,189
there we can there's a recent study
which looked at we're we're talking

5764
01:45:06,189 --> 01:45:06,199
which looked at we're we're talking
 

5765
01:45:06,199 --> 01:45:08,470
which looked at we're we're talking
about uh the the brain here we could

5766
01:45:08,470 --> 01:45:08,480
about uh the the brain here we could
 

5767
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:10,310
about uh the the brain here we could
look at the language Network okay we can

5768
01:45:10,310 --> 01:45:10,320
look at the language Network okay we can
 

5769
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:11,629
look at the language Network okay we can
look at the language Network and we

5770
01:45:11,629 --> 01:45:11,639
look at the language Network and we
 

5771
01:45:11,639 --> 01:45:13,629
look at the language Network and we
could look at the activation in the

5772
01:45:13,629 --> 01:45:13,639
could look at the activation in the
 

5773
01:45:13,639 --> 01:45:15,830
could look at the activation in the
language Network and how big the

5774
01:45:15,830 --> 01:45:15,840
language Network and how big the
 

5775
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:18,109
language Network and how big the
activation is depending on the length of

5776
01:45:18,109 --> 01:45:18,119
activation is depending on the length of
 

5777
01:45:18,119 --> 01:45:20,270
activation is depending on the length of
the dependencies and turns out in just

5778
01:45:20,270 --> 01:45:20,280
the dependencies and turns out in just
 

5779
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:21,589
the dependencies and turns out in just
random sentences that you're listening

5780
01:45:21,589 --> 01:45:21,599
random sentences that you're listening
 

5781
01:45:21,599 --> 01:45:22,990
random sentences that you're listening
to if you're listening to turns out

5782
01:45:22,990 --> 01:45:23,000
to if you're listening to turns out
 

5783
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:24,350
to if you're listening to turns out
there are people listening to stories

5784
01:45:24,350 --> 01:45:24,360
there are people listening to stories
 

5785
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:27,750
there are people listening to stories
here uh and the bigger the longer the

5786
01:45:27,750 --> 01:45:27,760
here uh and the bigger the longer the
 

5787
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:31,030
here uh and the bigger the longer the
dependence dependency is the the the

5788
01:45:31,030 --> 01:45:31,040
dependence dependency is the the the
 

5789
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:32,629
dependence dependency is the the the
stronger the activation in the language

5790
01:45:32,629 --> 01:45:32,639
stronger the activation in the language
 

5791
01:45:32,639 --> 01:45:33,910
stronger the activation in the language
in the language Network and so there's

5792
01:45:33,910 --> 01:45:33,920
in the language Network and so there's
 

5793
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:35,990
in the language Network and so there's
some measure there's a different there's

5794
01:45:35,990 --> 01:45:36,000
some measure there's a different there's
 

5795
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,109
some measure there's a different there's
a bunch of different measures we could

5796
01:45:37,109 --> 01:45:37,119
a bunch of different measures we could
 

5797
01:45:37,119 --> 01:45:38,669
a bunch of different measures we could
do that's a kind of a neat measure

5798
01:45:38,669 --> 01:45:38,679
do that's a kind of a neat measure
 

5799
01:45:38,679 --> 01:45:41,030
do that's a kind of a neat measure
actually of actual activations

5800
01:45:41,030 --> 01:45:41,040
actually of actual activations
 

5801
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:42,750
actually of actual activations
activation in the brain so that you can

5802
01:45:42,750 --> 01:45:42,760
activation in the brain so that you can
 

5803
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:44,350
activation in the brain so that you can
somehow in different ways convert it to

5804
01:45:44,350 --> 01:45:44,360
somehow in different ways convert it to
 

5805
01:45:44,360 --> 01:45:46,390
somehow in different ways convert it to
a number I wonder if there's a beautiful

5806
01:45:46,390 --> 01:45:46,400
a number I wonder if there's a beautiful
 

5807
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:48,030
a number I wonder if there's a beautiful
equation connecting cognitive cost and

5808
01:45:48,030 --> 01:45:48,040
equation connecting cognitive cost and
 

5809
01:45:48,040 --> 01:45:50,830
equation connecting cognitive cost and
length of dependency eal mc² kind of

5810
01:45:50,830 --> 01:45:50,840
length of dependency eal mc² kind of
 

5811
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:53,030
length of dependency eal mc² kind of
thing yeah it's it's complicated but

5812
01:45:53,030 --> 01:45:53,040
thing yeah it's it's complicated but
 

5813
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:54,910
thing yeah it's it's complicated but
probably it's doable I would I would

5814
01:45:54,910 --> 01:45:54,920
probably it's doable I would I would
 

5815
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:56,390
probably it's doable I would I would
guess it's doable I you know I tried to

5816
01:45:56,390 --> 01:45:56,400
guess it's doable I you know I tried to
 

5817
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:59,990
guess it's doable I you know I tried to
do that a while ago and I was reasonably

5818
01:45:59,990 --> 01:46:00,000
do that a while ago and I was reasonably
 

5819
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,470
do that a while ago and I was reasonably
successful but some for some reason I

5820
01:46:01,470 --> 01:46:01,480
successful but some for some reason I
 

5821
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:02,990
successful but some for some reason I
stopped working on that I do I agree

5822
01:46:02,990 --> 01:46:03,000
stopped working on that I do I agree
 

5823
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,350
stopped working on that I do I agree
with you that it would be nice to figure

5824
01:46:04,350 --> 01:46:04,360
with you that it would be nice to figure
 

5825
01:46:04,360 --> 01:46:06,070
with you that it would be nice to figure
out so there's like some way to figure

5826
01:46:06,070 --> 01:46:06,080
out so there's like some way to figure
 

5827
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:08,189
out so there's like some way to figure
out the the the cost I mean it's

5828
01:46:08,189 --> 01:46:08,199
out the the the cost I mean it's
 

5829
01:46:08,199 --> 01:46:09,950
out the the the cost I mean it's
complicated another issue you raised

5830
01:46:09,950 --> 01:46:09,960
complicated another issue you raised
 

5831
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:11,709
complicated another issue you raised
before was like how do you measure

5832
01:46:11,709 --> 01:46:11,719
before was like how do you measure
 

5833
01:46:11,719 --> 01:46:14,070
before was like how do you measure
distance is it words is it it probably

5834
01:46:14,070 --> 01:46:14,080
distance is it words is it it probably
 

5835
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:16,950
distance is it words is it it probably
isn't is the part of the problem is that

5836
01:46:16,950 --> 01:46:16,960
isn't is the part of the problem is that
 

5837
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:18,910
isn't is the part of the problem is that
some words matter than more than others

5838
01:46:18,910 --> 01:46:18,920
some words matter than more than others
 

5839
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:22,149
some words matter than more than others
and probably you know meaning like nouns

5840
01:46:22,149 --> 01:46:22,159
and probably you know meaning like nouns
 

5841
01:46:22,159 --> 01:46:23,550
and probably you know meaning like nouns
might matter depend depending and then

5842
01:46:23,550 --> 01:46:23,560
might matter depend depending and then
 

5843
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:25,229
might matter depend depending and then
maybe depends on which kind of noun is

5844
01:46:25,229 --> 01:46:25,239
maybe depends on which kind of noun is
 

5845
01:46:25,239 --> 01:46:26,950
maybe depends on which kind of noun is
it a noun we've already introduced or a

5846
01:46:26,950 --> 01:46:26,960
it a noun we've already introduced or a
 

5847
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:28,709
it a noun we've already introduced or a
noun that's already been mentioned is it

5848
01:46:28,709 --> 01:46:28,719
noun that's already been mentioned is it
 

5849
01:46:28,719 --> 01:46:31,109
noun that's already been mentioned is it
a pronoun versus a name like like all

5850
01:46:31,109 --> 01:46:31,119
a pronoun versus a name like like all
 

5851
01:46:31,119 --> 01:46:33,070
a pronoun versus a name like like all
these things probably matter so probably

5852
01:46:33,070 --> 01:46:33,080
these things probably matter so probably
 

5853
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:34,310
these things probably matter so probably
the simplest thing to do is just like

5854
01:46:34,310 --> 01:46:34,320
the simplest thing to do is just like
 

5855
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:36,189
the simplest thing to do is just like
let's forget about all that and just

5856
01:46:36,189 --> 01:46:36,199
let's forget about all that and just
 

5857
01:46:36,199 --> 01:46:39,270
let's forget about all that and just
think about words or morphemes for sure

5858
01:46:39,270 --> 01:46:39,280
think about words or morphemes for sure
 

5859
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:41,030
think about words or morphemes for sure
but there might be a kind like there

5860
01:46:41,030 --> 01:46:41,040
but there might be a kind like there
 

5861
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:43,990
but there might be a kind like there
might be some insight in the kind of

5862
01:46:43,990 --> 01:46:44,000
might be some insight in the kind of
 

5863
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,950
might be some insight in the kind of
function yeah that fits the data meaning

5864
01:46:47,950 --> 01:46:47,960
function yeah that fits the data meaning
 

5865
01:46:47,960 --> 01:46:50,750
function yeah that fits the data meaning
like a quadratic like what I I think

5866
01:46:50,750 --> 01:46:50,760
like a quadratic like what I I think
 

5867
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:53,109
like a quadratic like what I I think
it's an exponential we think it's

5868
01:46:53,109 --> 01:46:53,119
it's an exponential we think it's
 

5869
01:46:53,119 --> 01:46:55,229
it's an exponential we think it's
exponential such that the longer the

5870
01:46:55,229 --> 01:46:55,239
exponential such that the longer the
 

5871
01:46:55,239 --> 01:46:57,870
exponential such that the longer the
distance the less it matters and so then

5872
01:46:57,870 --> 01:46:57,880
distance the less it matters and so then
 

5873
01:46:57,880 --> 01:47:00,550
distance the less it matters and so then
then it's the sum of those is my that

5874
01:47:00,550 --> 01:47:00,560
then it's the sum of those is my that
 

5875
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:02,350
then it's the sum of those is my that
that was our best guess a while ago so

5876
01:47:02,350 --> 01:47:02,360
that was our best guess a while ago so
 

5877
01:47:02,360 --> 01:47:03,629
that was our best guess a while ago so
that you've got a bunch of dependencies

5878
01:47:03,629 --> 01:47:03,639
that you've got a bunch of dependencies
 

5879
01:47:03,639 --> 01:47:05,070
that you've got a bunch of dependencies
if you've got a bunch of them that are

5880
01:47:05,070 --> 01:47:05,080
if you've got a bunch of them that are
 

5881
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:08,030
if you've got a bunch of them that are
being connected at some point that's at

5882
01:47:08,030 --> 01:47:08,040
being connected at some point that's at
 

5883
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:10,750
being connected at some point that's at
at the ends of those the the cost is the

5884
01:47:10,750 --> 01:47:10,760
at the ends of those the the cost is the
 

5885
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:12,750
at the ends of those the the cost is the
is some exponential function of those is

5886
01:47:12,750 --> 01:47:12,760
is some exponential function of those is
 

5887
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:15,310
is some exponential function of those is
my guess but because the reason it's

5888
01:47:15,310 --> 01:47:15,320
my guess but because the reason it's
 

5889
01:47:15,320 --> 01:47:16,870
my guess but because the reason it's
probably an exponential is like it's

5890
01:47:16,870 --> 01:47:16,880
probably an exponential is like it's
 

5891
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:18,950
probably an exponential is like it's
it's not just the distance between two

5892
01:47:18,950 --> 01:47:18,960
it's not just the distance between two
 

5893
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:20,470
it's not just the distance between two
words because I can make a very very

5894
01:47:20,470 --> 01:47:20,480
words because I can make a very very
 

5895
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:22,550
words because I can make a very very
long subject verbal dependency by adding

5896
01:47:22,550 --> 01:47:22,560
long subject verbal dependency by adding
 

5897
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:24,510
long subject verbal dependency by adding
Lots and lots of noun phrases and

5898
01:47:24,510 --> 01:47:24,520
Lots and lots of noun phrases and
 

5899
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:26,109
Lots and lots of noun phrases and
prepositional phrases and it doesn't

5900
01:47:26,109 --> 01:47:26,119
prepositional phrases and it doesn't
 

5901
01:47:26,119 --> 01:47:28,709
prepositional phrases and it doesn't
matter too much it's when you do nested

5902
01:47:28,709 --> 01:47:28,719
matter too much it's when you do nested
 

5903
01:47:28,719 --> 01:47:31,470
matter too much it's when you do nested
when I have multiple of these then then

5904
01:47:31,470 --> 01:47:31,480
when I have multiple of these then then
 

5905
01:47:31,480 --> 01:47:34,709
when I have multiple of these then then
things get go really bad go south

5906
01:47:34,709 --> 01:47:34,719
things get go really bad go south
 

5907
01:47:34,719 --> 01:47:36,149
things get go really bad go south
probably somehow connected to working

5908
01:47:36,149 --> 01:47:36,159
probably somehow connected to working
 

5909
01:47:36,159 --> 01:47:37,629
probably somehow connected to working
memory or something like yeah that's

5910
01:47:37,629 --> 01:47:37,639
memory or something like yeah that's
 

5911
01:47:37,639 --> 01:47:39,390
memory or something like yeah that's
probably a function of the memory here

5912
01:47:39,390 --> 01:47:39,400
probably a function of the memory here
 

5913
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:42,790
probably a function of the memory here
is is the access is trying to find those

5914
01:47:42,790 --> 01:47:42,800
is is the access is trying to find those
 

5915
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:44,750
is is the access is trying to find those
earlier things it's kind of hard to

5916
01:47:44,750 --> 01:47:44,760
earlier things it's kind of hard to
 

5917
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:47,470
earlier things it's kind of hard to
figure out what was referred to earlier

5918
01:47:47,470 --> 01:47:47,480
figure out what was referred to earlier
 

5919
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:49,149
figure out what was referred to earlier
those are those connections that's

5920
01:47:49,149 --> 01:47:49,159
those are those connections that's
 

5921
01:47:49,159 --> 01:47:50,910
those are those connections that's
that's the sort of notion of murking as

5922
01:47:50,910 --> 01:47:50,920
that's the sort of notion of murking as
 

5923
01:47:50,920 --> 01:47:53,070
that's the sort of notion of murking as
opposed to a stagey thing but trying to

5924
01:47:53,070 --> 01:47:53,080
opposed to a stagey thing but trying to
 

5925
01:47:53,080 --> 01:47:56,030
opposed to a stagey thing but trying to
connect uh retrie retrieve those earlier

5926
01:47:56,030 --> 01:47:56,040
connect uh retrie retrieve those earlier
 

5927
01:47:56,040 --> 01:47:57,629
connect uh retrie retrieve those earlier
words depending on what was in between

5928
01:47:57,629 --> 01:47:57,639
words depending on what was in between
 

5929
01:47:57,639 --> 01:47:59,270
words depending on what was in between
and then then we're talking about

5930
01:47:59,270 --> 01:47:59,280
and then then we're talking about
 

5931
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:01,030
and then then we're talking about
interference of similar things in

5932
01:48:01,030 --> 01:48:01,040
interference of similar things in
 

5933
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:03,070
interference of similar things in
between that's the Right theory probably

5934
01:48:03,070 --> 01:48:03,080
between that's the Right theory probably
 

5935
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:04,990
between that's the Right theory probably
has that kind of notion in it is

5936
01:48:04,990 --> 01:48:05,000
has that kind of notion in it is
 

5937
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,109
has that kind of notion in it is
interference of similar and so I I'm I'm

5938
01:48:07,109 --> 01:48:07,119
interference of similar and so I I'm I'm
 

5939
01:48:07,119 --> 01:48:08,589
interference of similar and so I I'm I'm
dealing with an abstraction over the

5940
01:48:08,589 --> 01:48:08,599
dealing with an abstraction over the
 

5941
01:48:08,599 --> 01:48:10,070
dealing with an abstraction over the
Right theory which is just you know it's

5942
01:48:10,070 --> 01:48:10,080
Right theory which is just you know it's
 

5943
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:11,629
Right theory which is just you know it's
count Words it's not right but it's

5944
01:48:11,629 --> 01:48:11,639
count Words it's not right but it's
 

5945
01:48:11,639 --> 01:48:13,430
count Words it's not right but it's
close and then may maybe you're right

5946
01:48:13,430 --> 01:48:13,440
close and then may maybe you're right
 

5947
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:15,270
close and then may maybe you're right
though there's some sort of um an

5948
01:48:15,270 --> 01:48:15,280
though there's some sort of um an
 

5949
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:17,589
though there's some sort of um an
exponential or something on on the on to

5950
01:48:17,589 --> 01:48:17,599
exponential or something on on the on to
 

5951
01:48:17,599 --> 01:48:19,030
exponential or something on on the on to
figure out the total so we can figure

5952
01:48:19,030 --> 01:48:19,040
figure out the total so we can figure
 

5953
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:21,229
figure out the total so we can figure
out a function for any given for every

5954
01:48:21,229 --> 01:48:21,239
out a function for any given for every
 

5955
01:48:21,239 --> 01:48:23,149
out a function for any given for every
any given sentence in any given language

5956
01:48:23,149 --> 01:48:23,159
any given sentence in any given language
 

5957
01:48:23,159 --> 01:48:24,589
any given sentence in any given language
but you know it's funny you know people

5958
01:48:24,589 --> 01:48:24,599
but you know it's funny you know people
 

5959
01:48:24,599 --> 01:48:26,189
but you know it's funny you know people
haven't done that too much which I do

5960
01:48:26,189 --> 01:48:26,199
haven't done that too much which I do
 

5961
01:48:26,199 --> 01:48:28,990
haven't done that too much which I do
think is I I'm I'm interested that you

5962
01:48:28,990 --> 01:48:29,000
think is I I'm I'm interested that you
 

5963
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:30,430
think is I I'm I'm interested that you
find that interesting I really find that

5964
01:48:30,430 --> 01:48:30,440
find that interesting I really find that
 

5965
01:48:30,440 --> 01:48:31,870
find that interesting I really find that
interesting and a lot of people haven't

5966
01:48:31,870 --> 01:48:31,880
interesting and a lot of people haven't
 

5967
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:33,149
interesting and a lot of people haven't
found it interesting and I don't know

5968
01:48:33,149 --> 01:48:33,159
found it interesting and I don't know
 

5969
01:48:33,159 --> 01:48:35,189
found it interesting and I don't know
why I haven't got people to want to work

5970
01:48:35,189 --> 01:48:35,199
why I haven't got people to want to work
 

5971
01:48:35,199 --> 01:48:37,030
why I haven't got people to want to work
on that I really like that too no that's

5972
01:48:37,030 --> 01:48:37,040
on that I really like that too no that's
 

5973
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:38,950
on that I really like that too no that's
a that's that's a beautiful IDE and the

5974
01:48:38,950 --> 01:48:38,960
a that's that's a beautiful IDE and the
 

5975
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:40,350
a that's that's a beautiful IDE and the
underlying idea is beautiful that

5976
01:48:40,350 --> 01:48:40,360
underlying idea is beautiful that
 

5977
01:48:40,360 --> 01:48:42,310
underlying idea is beautiful that
there's a cognitive cost that correlates

5978
01:48:42,310 --> 01:48:42,320
there's a cognitive cost that correlates
 

5979
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:44,990
there's a cognitive cost that correlates
with the length of dependency it just it

5980
01:48:44,990 --> 01:48:45,000
with the length of dependency it just it
 

5981
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:46,470
with the length of dependency it just it
feels like it's a deep I mean language

5982
01:48:46,470 --> 01:48:46,480
feels like it's a deep I mean language
 

5983
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:47,870
feels like it's a deep I mean language
is so fundamental to The Human

5984
01:48:47,870 --> 01:48:47,880
is so fundamental to The Human
 

5985
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:51,390
is so fundamental to The Human
Experience and this is a nice clean

5986
01:48:51,390 --> 01:48:51,400
Experience and this is a nice clean
 

5987
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:53,229
Experience and this is a nice clean
theory of language

5988
01:48:53,229 --> 01:48:53,239
theory of language

MH where yeah it's like wow okay so like

5990
01:48:56,030 --> 01:48:56,040
MH where yeah it's like wow okay so like
 

5991
01:48:56,040 --> 01:48:58,990
MH where yeah it's like wow okay so like
we like our words close together the

5992
01:48:58,990 --> 01:48:59,000
we like our words close together the
 

5993
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,790
we like our words close together the
dependent words close together yeah

5994
01:49:00,790 --> 01:49:00,800
dependent words close together yeah
 

5995
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,910
dependent words close together yeah
that's why I like it too it's so simple

5996
01:49:02,910 --> 01:49:02,920
that's why I like it too it's so simple
 

5997
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:04,990
that's why I like it too it's so simple
yeah the Simplicity of and yet it

5998
01:49:04,990 --> 01:49:05,000
yeah the Simplicity of and yet it
 

5999
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,229
yeah the Simplicity of and yet it
explains some very complicated phenomena

6000
01:49:07,229 --> 01:49:07,239
explains some very complicated phenomena
 

6001
01:49:07,239 --> 01:49:09,270
explains some very complicated phenomena
if you if I write these very complicated

6002
01:49:09,270 --> 01:49:09,280
if you if I write these very complicated
 

6003
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:10,750
if you if I write these very complicated
sentences it's kind of hard to know why

6004
01:49:10,750 --> 01:49:10,760
sentences it's kind of hard to know why
 

6005
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:12,510
sentences it's kind of hard to know why
they're so hard and you can like oh nail

6006
01:49:12,510 --> 01:49:12,520
they're so hard and you can like oh nail
 

6007
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:14,990
they're so hard and you can like oh nail
it down I can do like give you a math

6008
01:49:14,990 --> 01:49:15,000
it down I can do like give you a math
 

6009
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,189
it down I can do like give you a math
formula for why each one of them is bad

6010
01:49:17,189 --> 01:49:17,199
formula for why each one of them is bad
 

6011
01:49:17,199 --> 01:49:19,390
formula for why each one of them is bad
and where and that's kind of cool I

6012
01:49:19,390 --> 01:49:19,400
and where and that's kind of cool I
 

6013
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:20,830
and where and that's kind of cool I
think that's very neat have you gone

6014
01:49:20,830 --> 01:49:20,840
think that's very neat have you gone
 

6015
01:49:20,840 --> 01:49:23,350
think that's very neat have you gone
through the process is there like a you

6016
01:49:23,350 --> 01:49:23,360
through the process is there like a you
 

6017
01:49:23,360 --> 01:49:25,790
through the process is there like a you
you take a piece of text and then

6018
01:49:25,790 --> 01:49:25,800
you take a piece of text and then
 

6019
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:28,709
you take a piece of text and then
simplify sort of like there's an average

6020
01:49:28,709 --> 01:49:28,719
simplify sort of like there's an average
 

6021
01:49:28,719 --> 01:49:30,350
simplify sort of like there's an average
uh length of dependency and then you

6022
01:49:30,350 --> 01:49:30,360
uh length of dependency and then you
 

6023
01:49:30,360 --> 01:49:34,109
uh length of dependency and then you
like uh you know uh reduce it and see

6024
01:49:34,109 --> 01:49:34,119
like uh you know uh reduce it and see
 

6025
01:49:34,119 --> 01:49:35,790
like uh you know uh reduce it and see
comprehension on the entire not just a

6026
01:49:35,790 --> 01:49:35,800
comprehension on the entire not just a
 

6027
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:37,950
comprehension on the entire not just a
single sentence but like you know you go

6028
01:49:37,950 --> 01:49:37,960
single sentence but like you know you go
 

6029
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:41,229
single sentence but like you know you go
from James joy to Hemingway or

6030
01:49:41,229 --> 01:49:41,239
from James joy to Hemingway or
 

6031
01:49:41,239 --> 01:49:44,070
from James joy to Hemingway or
something no no simple answer is no that

6032
01:49:44,070 --> 01:49:44,080
something no no simple answer is no that
 

6033
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:45,510
something no no simple answer is no that
does there's probably things you can do

6034
01:49:45,510 --> 01:49:45,520
does there's probably things you can do
 

6035
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:47,390
does there's probably things you can do
in that in that kind of Direction that's

6036
01:49:47,390 --> 01:49:47,400
in that in that kind of Direction that's
 

6037
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:49,390
in that in that kind of Direction that's
fun we might you know we're going to

6038
01:49:49,390 --> 01:49:49,400
fun we might you know we're going to
 

6039
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:50,870
fun we might you know we're going to
talk about legal EAS at some point and

6040
01:49:50,870 --> 01:49:50,880
talk about legal EAS at some point and
 

6041
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:52,430
talk about legal EAS at some point and
so we maybe we'll talk about that kind

6042
01:49:52,430 --> 01:49:52,440
so we maybe we'll talk about that kind
 

6043
01:49:52,440 --> 01:49:53,589
so we maybe we'll talk about that kind
of

6044
01:49:53,589 --> 01:49:53,599
of
 

6045
01:49:53,599 --> 01:49:55,750
of
thinking would applied to Legal EAS but

6046
01:49:55,750 --> 01:49:55,760
thinking would applied to Legal EAS but
 

6047
01:49:55,760 --> 01:49:56,790
thinking would applied to Legal EAS but
let's talk about legal EAS because you

6048
01:49:56,790 --> 01:49:56,800
let's talk about legal EAS because you
 

6049
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:58,470
let's talk about legal EAS because you
mentioned that as an exception we just

6050
01:49:58,470 --> 01:49:58,480
mentioned that as an exception we just
 

6051
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:00,270
mentioned that as an exception we just
taking tangent upon tangent that's an

6052
01:50:00,270 --> 01:50:00,280
taking tangent upon tangent that's an
 

6053
01:50:00,280 --> 01:50:01,790
taking tangent upon tangent that's an
interesting one you given as an

6054
01:50:01,790 --> 01:50:01,800
interesting one you given as an
 

6055
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:05,669
interesting one you given as an
exception it's an exception uh that you

6056
01:50:05,669 --> 01:50:05,679
exception it's an exception uh that you
 

6057
01:50:05,679 --> 01:50:07,669
exception it's an exception uh that you
say that most natural languages as we've

6058
01:50:07,669 --> 01:50:07,679
say that most natural languages as we've
 

6059
01:50:07,679 --> 01:50:09,910
say that most natural languages as we've
been talking about have local

6060
01:50:09,910 --> 01:50:09,920
been talking about have local
 

6061
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:12,750
been talking about have local
dependencies with one exception legal e

6062
01:50:12,750 --> 01:50:12,760
dependencies with one exception legal e
 

6063
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:15,149
dependencies with one exception legal e
that's right so what is legal first of

6064
01:50:15,149 --> 01:50:15,159
that's right so what is legal first of
 

6065
01:50:15,159 --> 01:50:18,270
that's right so what is legal first of
all oh well legal is what you think it

6066
01:50:18,270 --> 01:50:18,280
all oh well legal is what you think it
 

6067
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:21,149
all oh well legal is what you think it
is it's just any legal language I mean

6068
01:50:21,149 --> 01:50:21,159
is it's just any legal language I mean
 

6069
01:50:21,159 --> 01:50:22,470
is it's just any legal language I mean
like I actually know know very little

6070
01:50:22,470 --> 01:50:22,480
like I actually know know very little
 

6071
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:23,990
like I actually know know very little
about the kind of language that lawyers

6072
01:50:23,990 --> 01:50:24,000
about the kind of language that lawyers
 

6073
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,350
about the kind of language that lawyers
use so I'm just talking about language

6074
01:50:26,350 --> 01:50:26,360
use so I'm just talking about language
 

6075
01:50:26,360 --> 01:50:28,950
use so I'm just talking about language
in laws and language in contracts got it

6076
01:50:28,950 --> 01:50:28,960
in laws and language in contracts got it
 

6077
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:31,229
in laws and language in contracts got it
so the stuff that you have to run into

6078
01:50:31,229 --> 01:50:31,239
so the stuff that you have to run into
 

6079
01:50:31,239 --> 01:50:33,589
so the stuff that you have to run into
we have to run into every other day or

6080
01:50:33,589 --> 01:50:33,599
we have to run into every other day or
 

6081
01:50:33,599 --> 01:50:36,830
we have to run into every other day or
every day uh and you skip over because

6082
01:50:36,830 --> 01:50:36,840
every day uh and you skip over because
 

6083
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:39,709
every day uh and you skip over because
it reads poorly and or you know partly

6084
01:50:39,709 --> 01:50:39,719
it reads poorly and or you know partly
 

6085
01:50:39,719 --> 01:50:41,589
it reads poorly and or you know partly
it's just long right there's a lot of

6086
01:50:41,589 --> 01:50:41,599
it's just long right there's a lot of
 

6087
01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:42,990
it's just long right there's a lot of
texts there that we don't really want to

6088
01:50:42,990 --> 01:50:43,000
texts there that we don't really want to
 

6089
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,510
texts there that we don't really want to
know about and so but the the thing I'm

6090
01:50:45,510 --> 01:50:45,520
know about and so but the the thing I'm
 

6091
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:47,550
know about and so but the the thing I'm
interested in so I I've been working

6092
01:50:47,550 --> 01:50:47,560
interested in so I I've been working
 

6093
01:50:47,560 --> 01:50:50,030
interested in so I I've been working
with um this guy called Eric Martinez

6094
01:50:50,030 --> 01:50:50,040
with um this guy called Eric Martinez
 

6095
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:52,750
with um this guy called Eric Martinez
who is a um he was a lawyer who was was

6096
01:50:52,750 --> 01:50:52,760
who is a um he was a lawyer who was was
 

6097
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:54,430
who is a um he was a lawyer who was was
taking my class I I was teaching a

6098
01:50:54,430 --> 01:50:54,440
taking my class I I was teaching a
 

6099
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:56,390
taking my class I I was teaching a
psychol Linguistics lab class and I have

6100
01:50:56,390 --> 01:50:56,400
psychol Linguistics lab class and I have
 

6101
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:57,750
psychol Linguistics lab class and I have
been teaching it for a long time at MIT

6102
01:50:57,750 --> 01:50:57,760
been teaching it for a long time at MIT
 

6103
01:50:57,760 --> 01:50:59,430
been teaching it for a long time at MIT
and he's a he was a law student at

6104
01:50:59,430 --> 01:50:59,440
and he's a he was a law student at
 

6105
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:01,430
and he's a he was a law student at
Harvard and he took the class because he

6106
01:51:01,430 --> 01:51:01,440
Harvard and he took the class because he
 

6107
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:02,910
Harvard and he took the class because he
had done some Linguistics as an

6108
01:51:02,910 --> 01:51:02,920
had done some Linguistics as an
 

6109
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:04,830
had done some Linguistics as an
undergrad and he was interested in the

6110
01:51:04,830 --> 01:51:04,840
undergrad and he was interested in the
 

6111
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:08,950
undergrad and he was interested in the
problem of why legal e sounds hard to

6112
01:51:08,950 --> 01:51:08,960
problem of why legal e sounds hard to
 

6113
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:11,069
problem of why legal e sounds hard to
understand you know why and and so why

6114
01:51:11,069 --> 01:51:11,079
understand you know why and and so why
 

6115
01:51:11,079 --> 01:51:13,189
understand you know why and and so why
is it hard to understand and why do they

6116
01:51:13,189 --> 01:51:13,199
is it hard to understand and why do they
 

6117
01:51:13,199 --> 01:51:15,030
is it hard to understand and why do they
write that way if it is so hard to

6118
01:51:15,030 --> 01:51:15,040
write that way if it is so hard to
 

6119
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:16,470
write that way if it is so hard to
understand it seems apparent that it's

6120
01:51:16,470 --> 01:51:16,480
understand it seems apparent that it's
 

6121
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,510
understand it seems apparent that it's
hard to understand the question is why

6122
01:51:18,510 --> 01:51:18,520
hard to understand the question is why
 

6123
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:21,910
hard to understand the question is why
is it and so we we didn't know and uh we

6124
01:51:21,910 --> 01:51:21,920
is it and so we we didn't know and uh we
 

6125
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:24,189
is it and so we we didn't know and uh we
did uh an evaluation of a bunch of

6126
01:51:24,189 --> 01:51:24,199
did uh an evaluation of a bunch of
 

6127
01:51:24,199 --> 01:51:25,910
did uh an evaluation of a bunch of
contracts actually we just took a bunch

6128
01:51:25,910 --> 01:51:25,920
contracts actually we just took a bunch
 

6129
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:28,189
contracts actually we just took a bunch
of sort random contracts because I don't

6130
01:51:28,189 --> 01:51:28,199
of sort random contracts because I don't
 

6131
01:51:28,199 --> 01:51:30,069
of sort random contracts because I don't
know you know there's contracts in laws

6132
01:51:30,069 --> 01:51:30,079
know you know there's contracts in laws
 

6133
01:51:30,079 --> 01:51:32,550
know you know there's contracts in laws
might not be exactly the same but uh

6134
01:51:32,550 --> 01:51:32,560
might not be exactly the same but uh
 

6135
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:33,990
might not be exactly the same but uh
contracts are kind of the things that

6136
01:51:33,990 --> 01:51:34,000
contracts are kind of the things that
 

6137
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,470
contracts are kind of the things that
most people have to deal with most of

6138
01:51:35,470 --> 01:51:35,480
most people have to deal with most of
 

6139
01:51:35,480 --> 01:51:37,109
most people have to deal with most of
the time and so that's kind of the most

6140
01:51:37,109 --> 01:51:37,119
the time and so that's kind of the most
 

6141
01:51:37,119 --> 01:51:39,069
the time and so that's kind of the most
common thing that humans have like

6142
01:51:39,069 --> 01:51:39,079
common thing that humans have like
 

6143
01:51:39,079 --> 01:51:41,830
common thing that humans have like
humans that that adults in our

6144
01:51:41,830 --> 01:51:41,840
humans that that adults in our
 

6145
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:43,790
humans that that adults in our
industrialized Society have to deal with

6146
01:51:43,790 --> 01:51:43,800
industrialized Society have to deal with
 

6147
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:46,669
industrialized Society have to deal with
a lot and so so that's what we we pulled

6148
01:51:46,669 --> 01:51:46,679
a lot and so so that's what we we pulled
 

6149
01:51:46,679 --> 01:51:48,189
a lot and so so that's what we we pulled
and we we didn't know what was hard

6150
01:51:48,189 --> 01:51:48,199
and we we didn't know what was hard
 

6151
01:51:48,199 --> 01:51:50,830
and we we didn't know what was hard
about them but it turns out that the way

6152
01:51:50,830 --> 01:51:50,840
about them but it turns out that the way
 

6153
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:53,390
about them but it turns out that the way
they're written is is very Centum beded

6154
01:51:53,390 --> 01:51:53,400
they're written is is very Centum beded
 

6155
01:51:53,400 --> 01:51:55,669
they're written is is very Centum beded
has nested structures in them so it has

6156
01:51:55,669 --> 01:51:55,679
has nested structures in them so it has
 

6157
01:51:55,679 --> 01:51:57,310
has nested structures in them so it has
low frequency words as well that's not

6158
01:51:57,310 --> 01:51:57,320
low frequency words as well that's not
 

6159
01:51:57,320 --> 01:51:59,189
low frequency words as well that's not
surprising lots of texts have low it

6160
01:51:59,189 --> 01:51:59,199
surprising lots of texts have low it
 

6161
01:51:59,199 --> 01:52:01,310
surprising lots of texts have low it
does have surprising slightly lower

6162
01:52:01,310 --> 01:52:01,320
does have surprising slightly lower
 

6163
01:52:01,320 --> 01:52:03,870
does have surprising slightly lower
frequency words than other kinds of

6164
01:52:03,870 --> 01:52:03,880
frequency words than other kinds of
 

6165
01:52:03,880 --> 01:52:06,189
frequency words than other kinds of
control texts even sort of academic text

6166
01:52:06,189 --> 01:52:06,199
control texts even sort of academic text
 

6167
01:52:06,199 --> 01:52:08,830
control texts even sort of academic text
legal Le is even worse it is the worst

6168
01:52:08,830 --> 01:52:08,840
legal Le is even worse it is the worst
 

6169
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:10,750
legal Le is even worse it is the worst
that that we were able to find you just

6170
01:52:10,750 --> 01:52:10,760
that that we were able to find you just
 

6171
01:52:10,760 --> 01:52:12,589
that that we were able to find you just
you just reveal the game that lers are

6172
01:52:12,589 --> 01:52:12,599
you just reveal the game that lers are
 

6173
01:52:12,599 --> 01:52:14,950
you just reveal the game that lers are
playing they're optimizing a different

6174
01:52:14,950 --> 01:52:14,960
playing they're optimizing a different
 

6175
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:16,270
playing they're optimizing a different
well you know it's interesting that's a

6176
01:52:16,270 --> 01:52:16,280
well you know it's interesting that's a
 

6177
01:52:16,280 --> 01:52:17,990
well you know it's interesting that's a
that's a now you're getting at why and

6178
01:52:17,990 --> 01:52:18,000
that's a now you're getting at why and
 

6179
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,430
that's a now you're getting at why and
so and I don't think so now you're

6180
01:52:19,430 --> 01:52:19,440
so and I don't think so now you're
 

6181
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:20,870
so and I don't think so now you're
saying it's they're doing intentionally

6182
01:52:20,870 --> 01:52:20,880
saying it's they're doing intentionally
 

6183
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:21,470
saying it's they're doing intentionally
I don't think they're doing

6184
01:52:21,470 --> 01:52:21,480
I don't think they're doing
 

6185
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:23,550
I don't think they're doing
intentionally but let let let's um let's

6186
01:52:23,550 --> 01:52:23,560
intentionally but let let let's um let's
 

6187
01:52:23,560 --> 01:52:25,149
intentionally but let let let's um let's
it's an emerging phenomena okay yeah

6188
01:52:25,149 --> 01:52:25,159
it's an emerging phenomena okay yeah
 

6189
01:52:25,159 --> 01:52:26,990
it's an emerging phenomena okay yeah
yeah we'll get to that we'll get to that

6190
01:52:26,990 --> 01:52:27,000
yeah we'll get to that we'll get to that
 

6191
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,589
yeah we'll get to that we'll get to that
and so but but we wanted to see why see

6192
01:52:29,589 --> 01:52:29,599
and so but but we wanted to see why see
 

6193
01:52:29,599 --> 01:52:31,470
and so but but we wanted to see why see
what first as oppos so like because it

6194
01:52:31,470 --> 01:52:31,480
what first as oppos so like because it
 

6195
01:52:31,480 --> 01:52:33,069
what first as oppos so like because it
turns out that we're not the first to

6196
01:52:33,069 --> 01:52:33,079
turns out that we're not the first to
 

6197
01:52:33,079 --> 01:52:35,629
turns out that we're not the first to
observe that legal EAS is weird like

6198
01:52:35,629 --> 01:52:35,639
observe that legal EAS is weird like
 

6199
01:52:35,639 --> 01:52:38,629
observe that legal EAS is weird like
back to uh Nixon had a plain language

6200
01:52:38,629 --> 01:52:38,639
back to uh Nixon had a plain language
 

6201
01:52:38,639 --> 01:52:42,790
back to uh Nixon had a plain language
act in in 1970 and and Obama had one and

6202
01:52:42,790 --> 01:52:42,800
act in in 1970 and and Obama had one and
 

6203
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:45,030
act in in 1970 and and Obama had one and
uh boy a lot of these you know a lot of

6204
01:52:45,030 --> 01:52:45,040
uh boy a lot of these you know a lot of
 

6205
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:46,310
uh boy a lot of these you know a lot of
presidents have said oh we've got a

6206
01:52:46,310 --> 01:52:46,320
presidents have said oh we've got a
 

6207
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:48,750
presidents have said oh we've got a
simplify legal language must simplify it

6208
01:52:48,750 --> 01:52:48,760
simplify legal language must simplify it
 

6209
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:50,189
simplify legal language must simplify it
but if you don't know how it's

6210
01:52:50,189 --> 01:52:50,199
but if you don't know how it's
 

6211
01:52:50,199 --> 01:52:52,109
but if you don't know how it's
complicated it's not easy to simplify it

6212
01:52:52,109 --> 01:52:52,119
complicated it's not easy to simplify it
 

6213
01:52:52,119 --> 01:52:53,629
complicated it's not easy to simplify it
you need know what it is you're supposed

6214
01:52:53,629 --> 01:52:53,639
you need know what it is you're supposed
 

6215
01:52:53,639 --> 01:52:55,870
you need know what it is you're supposed
to do before you can fix it right and so

6216
01:52:55,870 --> 01:52:55,880
to do before you can fix it right and so
 

6217
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:57,229
to do before you can fix it right and so
you need to like you need a psych

6218
01:52:57,229 --> 01:52:57,239
you need to like you need a psych
 

6219
01:52:57,239 --> 01:52:59,669
you need to like you need a psych
linguist to analyze the text and see

6220
01:52:59,669 --> 01:52:59,679
linguist to analyze the text and see
 

6221
01:52:59,679 --> 01:53:01,750
linguist to analyze the text and see
what's wrong with it before you can like

6222
01:53:01,750 --> 01:53:01,760
what's wrong with it before you can like
 

6223
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:03,109
what's wrong with it before you can like
fix it you don't know how to fix it how

6224
01:53:03,109 --> 01:53:03,119
fix it you don't know how to fix it how
 

6225
01:53:03,119 --> 01:53:04,350
fix it you don't know how to fix it how
am I supposed to fix something I don't

6226
01:53:04,350 --> 01:53:04,360
am I supposed to fix something I don't
 

6227
01:53:04,360 --> 01:53:06,149
am I supposed to fix something I don't
know what's wrong with it and so what we

6228
01:53:06,149 --> 01:53:06,159
know what's wrong with it and so what we
 

6229
01:53:06,159 --> 01:53:07,310
know what's wrong with it and so what we
did was just that's what we did we

6230
01:53:07,310 --> 01:53:07,320
did was just that's what we did we
 

6231
01:53:07,320 --> 01:53:08,790
did was just that's what we did we
figured out what's okay we just took a

6232
01:53:08,790 --> 01:53:08,800
figured out what's okay we just took a
 

6233
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:11,270
figured out what's okay we just took a
bunch of contracts had people uh and we

6234
01:53:11,270 --> 01:53:11,280
bunch of contracts had people uh and we
 

6235
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:14,109
bunch of contracts had people uh and we
encoded them for the the a bunch of

6236
01:53:14,109 --> 01:53:14,119
encoded them for the the a bunch of
 

6237
01:53:14,119 --> 01:53:15,750
encoded them for the the a bunch of
features and so another feature the

6238
01:53:15,750 --> 01:53:15,760
features and so another feature the
 

6239
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:17,550
features and so another feature the
people one of them was Centrum Bing and

6240
01:53:17,550 --> 01:53:17,560
people one of them was Centrum Bing and
 

6241
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:22,189
people one of them was Centrum Bing and
so uh that is like basically how often a

6242
01:53:22,189 --> 01:53:22,199
so uh that is like basically how often a
 

6243
01:53:22,199 --> 01:53:24,270
so uh that is like basically how often a
um a clause would in would would

6244
01:53:24,270 --> 01:53:24,280
um a clause would in would would
 

6245
01:53:24,280 --> 01:53:26,350
um a clause would in would would
intervene between a subject and a verb

6246
01:53:26,350 --> 01:53:26,360
intervene between a subject and a verb
 

6247
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:28,069
intervene between a subject and a verb
for example that's one kind of a cent

6248
01:53:28,069 --> 01:53:28,079
for example that's one kind of a cent
 

6249
01:53:28,079 --> 01:53:30,950
for example that's one kind of a cent
edding of a clause okay and um turns out

6250
01:53:30,950 --> 01:53:30,960
edding of a clause okay and um turns out
 

6251
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:33,109
edding of a clause okay and um turns out
they're massively Cent embedded like so

6252
01:53:33,109 --> 01:53:33,119
they're massively Cent embedded like so
 

6253
01:53:33,119 --> 01:53:35,109
they're massively Cent embedded like so
I think in random contracts and in

6254
01:53:35,109 --> 01:53:35,119
I think in random contracts and in
 

6255
01:53:35,119 --> 01:53:38,189
I think in random contracts and in
random laws I think you get about 70% or

6256
01:53:38,189 --> 01:53:38,199
random laws I think you get about 70% or
 

6257
01:53:38,199 --> 01:53:40,430
random laws I think you get about 70% or
80 something like 70% of sentences have

6258
01:53:40,430 --> 01:53:40,440
80 something like 70% of sentences have
 

6259
01:53:40,440 --> 01:53:42,390
80 something like 70% of sentences have
a center embedded clause which is

6260
01:53:42,390 --> 01:53:42,400
a center embedded clause which is
 

6261
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:44,390
a center embedded clause which is
insanely high if you go to any other

6262
01:53:44,390 --> 01:53:44,400
insanely high if you go to any other
 

6263
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:46,990
insanely high if you go to any other
text it's down to 20% or something it's

6264
01:53:46,990 --> 01:53:47,000
text it's down to 20% or something it's
 

6265
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,390
text it's down to 20% or something it's
it's it's so much higher than the any

6266
01:53:49,390 --> 01:53:49,400
it's it's so much higher than the any
 

6267
01:53:49,400 --> 01:53:50,950
it's it's so much higher than the any
control you can think of including you

6268
01:53:50,950 --> 01:53:50,960
control you can think of including you
 

6269
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:53,470
control you can think of including you
think oh people think oh Tech technical

6270
01:53:53,470 --> 01:53:53,480
think oh people think oh Tech technical
 

6271
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:55,470
think oh people think oh Tech technical
um academic text no people don't write

6272
01:53:55,470 --> 01:53:55,480
um academic text no people don't write
 

6273
01:53:55,480 --> 01:53:57,709
um academic text no people don't write
Cent embedded sentences in in technical

6274
01:53:57,709 --> 01:53:57,719
Cent embedded sentences in in technical
 

6275
01:53:57,719 --> 01:53:58,910
Cent embedded sentences in in technical
academic text I mean they do a little

6276
01:53:58,910 --> 01:53:58,920
academic text I mean they do a little
 

6277
01:53:58,920 --> 01:54:01,510
academic text I mean they do a little
bit but much it's it's on the 20% 30%

6278
01:54:01,510 --> 01:54:01,520
bit but much it's it's on the 20% 30%
 

6279
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:03,990
bit but much it's it's on the 20% 30%
realm as opposed to 70 and so and so

6280
01:54:03,990 --> 01:54:04,000
realm as opposed to 70 and so and so
 

6281
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,109
realm as opposed to 70 and so and so
there's that and and there's low

6282
01:54:05,109 --> 01:54:05,119
there's that and and there's low
 

6283
01:54:05,119 --> 01:54:07,229
there's that and and there's low
frequency words and then people oh maybe

6284
01:54:07,229 --> 01:54:07,239
frequency words and then people oh maybe
 

6285
01:54:07,239 --> 01:54:08,709
frequency words and then people oh maybe
it's passive people don't like the

6286
01:54:08,709 --> 01:54:08,719
it's passive people don't like the
 

6287
01:54:08,719 --> 01:54:10,270
it's passive people don't like the
passive passive for some reason the

6288
01:54:10,270 --> 01:54:10,280
passive passive for some reason the
 

6289
01:54:10,280 --> 01:54:12,470
passive passive for some reason the
passive voice in English has a bad rap

6290
01:54:12,470 --> 01:54:12,480
passive voice in English has a bad rap
 

6291
01:54:12,480 --> 01:54:14,030
passive voice in English has a bad rap
and I'm not really sure where that comes

6292
01:54:14,030 --> 01:54:14,040
and I'm not really sure where that comes
 

6293
01:54:14,040 --> 01:54:18,470
and I'm not really sure where that comes
from um and there is a lot of passive in

6294
01:54:18,470 --> 01:54:18,480
from um and there is a lot of passive in
 

6295
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:20,870
from um and there is a lot of passive in
uh the there's much more passive voice

6296
01:54:20,870 --> 01:54:20,880
uh the there's much more passive voice
 

6297
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:23,750
uh the there's much more passive voice
in the in the uh in than there is in

6298
01:54:23,750 --> 01:54:23,760
in the in the uh in than there is in
 

6299
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:24,910
in the in the uh in than there is in
passive voice accounts for some of the

6300
01:54:24,910 --> 01:54:24,920
passive voice accounts for some of the
 

6301
01:54:24,920 --> 01:54:27,189
passive voice accounts for some of the
low frequency words no no those are

6302
01:54:27,189 --> 01:54:27,199
low frequency words no no those are
 

6303
01:54:27,199 --> 01:54:28,629
low frequency words no no those are
separate those are separate oh so

6304
01:54:28,629 --> 01:54:28,639
separate those are separate oh so
 

6305
01:54:28,639 --> 01:54:31,350
separate those are separate oh so
passive voice sucks frequency where suck

6306
01:54:31,350 --> 01:54:31,360
passive voice sucks frequency where suck
 

6307
01:54:31,360 --> 01:54:32,870
passive voice sucks frequency where suck
suck is different so these are different

6308
01:54:32,870 --> 01:54:32,880
suck is different so these are different
 

6309
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:34,870
suck is different so these are different

Judgment it's just like these are

6312
01:54:35,830 --> 01:54:35,840
Judgment it's just like these are
 

6313
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:37,430
Judgment it's just like these are
frequent these are things which happen

6314
01:54:37,430 --> 01:54:37,440
frequent these are things which happen
 

6315
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:39,750
frequent these are things which happen
in legal these texts then we can ask the

6316
01:54:39,750 --> 01:54:39,760
in legal these texts then we can ask the
 

6317
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:42,350
in legal these texts then we can ask the
dependent measure is like how well you

6318
01:54:42,350 --> 01:54:42,360
dependent measure is like how well you
 

6319
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:43,870
dependent measure is like how well you
understand those things with those

6320
01:54:43,870 --> 01:54:43,880
understand those things with those
 

6321
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:45,950
understand those things with those
features okay and so then and it turns

6322
01:54:45,950 --> 01:54:45,960
features okay and so then and it turns
 

6323
01:54:45,960 --> 01:54:47,830
features okay and so then and it turns
out the passive makes no difference so

6324
01:54:47,830 --> 01:54:47,840
out the passive makes no difference so
 

6325
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:49,350
out the passive makes no difference so
it has a Zero Effect on your

6326
01:54:49,350 --> 01:54:49,360
it has a Zero Effect on your
 

6327
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:51,030
it has a Zero Effect on your
comprehension ability on your recall

6328
01:54:51,030 --> 01:54:51,040

little bit they do low frequency words

6334
01:54:57,310 --> 01:54:57,320
little bit they do low frequency words
 

6335
01:54:57,320 --> 01:54:59,189
little bit they do low frequency words
are going to hurt you in recall and

6336
01:54:59,189 --> 01:54:59,199
are going to hurt you in recall and
 

6337
01:54:59,199 --> 01:55:00,870
are going to hurt you in recall and
understanding but what really what

understanding but what really what
 

6339
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:03,189
understanding but what really what
really hurts is the S betting that kills

6340
01:55:03,189 --> 01:55:03,199
really hurts is the S betting that kills
 

6341
01:55:03,199 --> 01:55:05,830
really hurts is the S betting that kills
you that is like that slows people down

that makes them that makes them very
 

6345
01:55:07,679 --> 01:55:10,229
that makes them that makes them very
poor understanding that makes them uh

01:55:10,229 --> 01:55:10,239
poor understanding that makes them uh

01:55:10,239 --> 01:55:11,629
poor understanding that makes them uh
they they they can't recall what was

6348
01:55:11,629 --> 01:55:11,639
they they they can't recall what was
 

6349
01:55:11,639 --> 01:55:13,229
they they they can't recall what was
said as well nearly as well and we we

6350
01:55:13,229 --> 01:55:13,239
said as well nearly as well and we we
 

6351
01:55:13,239 --> 01:55:15,069
said as well nearly as well and we we
did this not only on lay people we did

6352
01:55:15,069 --> 01:55:15,079
did this not only on lay people we did
 

6353
01:55:15,079 --> 01:55:16,910
did this not only on lay people we did
on a lot of late people we ran it on a

6354
01:55:16,910 --> 01:55:16,920
on a lot of late people we ran it on a
 

6355
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:19,390
on a lot of late people we ran it on a
100 lawyers we recruited lawyers from a

6356
01:55:19,390 --> 01:55:19,400
100 lawyers we recruited lawyers from a
 

6357
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:23,430
100 lawyers we recruited lawyers from a
from a wide range of of um um sort of

6358
01:55:23,430 --> 01:55:23,440
from a wide range of of um um sort of
 

6359
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:25,990
from a wide range of of um um sort of
different levels of law firms and stuff

6360
01:55:25,990 --> 01:55:26,000
different levels of law firms and stuff
 

6361
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,750
different levels of law firms and stuff
and they have the same pattern so they

6362
01:55:28,750 --> 01:55:28,760
and they have the same pattern so they
 

6363
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:31,109
and they have the same pattern so they
also like why when when when they did

6364
01:55:31,109 --> 01:55:31,119
also like why when when when they did
 

6365
01:55:31,119 --> 01:55:32,229
also like why when when when they did
this I did not know it would happen I

6366
01:55:32,229 --> 01:55:32,239
this I did not know it would happen I
 

6367
01:55:32,239 --> 01:55:33,950
this I did not know it would happen I
thought maybe they could process they're

6368
01:55:33,950 --> 01:55:33,960
thought maybe they could process they're
 

6369
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:35,910
thought maybe they could process they're
used to Legal e they process just as

6370
01:55:35,910 --> 01:55:35,920
used to Legal e they process just as
 

6371
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:38,990
used to Legal e they process just as
well as it it was normal no no they they

6372
01:55:38,990 --> 01:55:39,000
well as it it was normal no no they they
 

6373
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,470
well as it it was normal no no they they
they're much better than lay people so

6374
01:55:41,470 --> 01:55:41,480
they're much better than lay people so
 

6375
01:55:41,480 --> 01:55:42,950
they're much better than lay people so
they're much like they can much better

6376
01:55:42,950 --> 01:55:42,960
they're much like they can much better
 

6377
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:44,470
they're much like they can much better
recall much better understanding but

6378
01:55:44,470 --> 01:55:44,480
recall much better understanding but
 

6379
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:46,750
recall much better understanding but
they have the same main effects as as as

6380
01:55:46,750 --> 01:55:46,760
they have the same main effects as as as
 

6381
01:55:46,760 --> 01:55:48,189
they have the same main effects as as as
lay people as lay people exactly the

6382
01:55:48,189 --> 01:55:48,199
lay people as lay people exactly the
 

6383
01:55:48,199 --> 01:55:50,709
lay people as lay people exactly the
same so they also much prefer the

6384
01:55:50,709 --> 01:55:50,719
same so they also much prefer the
 

6385
01:55:50,719 --> 01:55:52,709
same so they also much prefer the
non-centric so we we oh we constructed

6386
01:55:52,709 --> 01:55:52,719
non-centric so we we oh we constructed
 

6387
01:55:52,719 --> 01:55:54,350
non-centric so we we oh we constructed
non- Center embedded versions of each of

6388
01:55:54,350 --> 01:55:54,360
non- Center embedded versions of each of
 

6389
01:55:54,360 --> 01:55:56,990
non- Center embedded versions of each of
these we constructed versions which have

6390
01:55:56,990 --> 01:55:57,000
these we constructed versions which have
 

6391
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,149
these we constructed versions which have
um higher frequency words in those

6392
01:55:59,149 --> 01:55:59,159
um higher frequency words in those
 

6393
01:55:59,159 --> 01:56:01,950
um higher frequency words in those
places and we we did we un un UNP

6394
01:56:01,950 --> 01:56:01,960
places and we we did we un un UNP
 

6395
01:56:01,960 --> 01:56:03,430
places and we we did we un un UNP
passivized we turned them into active

6396
01:56:03,430 --> 01:56:03,440
passivized we turned them into active
 

6397
01:56:03,440 --> 01:56:05,629
passivized we turned them into active
versions The the passive active made no

6398
01:56:05,629 --> 01:56:05,639
versions The the passive active made no
 

6399
01:56:05,639 --> 01:56:07,790
versions The the passive active made no
difference the words made a little

6400
01:56:07,790 --> 01:56:07,800
difference the words made a little
 

6401
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:10,030
difference the words made a little
difference and the UN uncenter embedding

6402
01:56:10,030 --> 01:56:10,040
difference and the UN uncenter embedding
 

6403
01:56:10,040 --> 01:56:11,790
difference and the UN uncenter embedding
Mak makes big differences in all the

6404
01:56:11,790 --> 01:56:11,800
Mak makes big differences in all the
 

6405
01:56:11,800 --> 01:56:14,030
Mak makes big differences in all the
populations uncenter embedding how hard

6406
01:56:14,030 --> 01:56:14,040
populations uncenter embedding how hard
 

6407
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:15,990
populations uncenter embedding how hard
is that process by the way don't

6408
01:56:15,990 --> 01:56:16,000
is that process by the way don't
 

6409
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,910
is that process by the way don't
question but how hard is it to detect

6410
01:56:17,910 --> 01:56:17,920
question but how hard is it to detect
 

6411
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:20,750
question but how hard is it to detect
Center embedding oh easy easy to detect

6412
01:56:20,750 --> 01:56:20,760
Center embedding oh easy easy to detect
 

6413
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:22,950
Center embedding oh easy easy to detect
just looking at long dependencies or

6414
01:56:22,950 --> 01:56:22,960
just looking at long dependencies or
 

6415
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:24,189
just looking at long dependencies or
you can just you can so there's

6416
01:56:24,189 --> 01:56:24,199
you can just you can so there's
 

6417
01:56:24,199 --> 01:56:26,069
you can just you can so there's
automatic parsers for English which are

6418
01:56:26,069 --> 01:56:26,079
automatic parsers for English which are
 

6419
01:56:26,079 --> 01:56:27,990
automatic parsers for English which are
pretty good very and they can detect

6420
01:56:27,990 --> 01:56:28,000
pretty good very and they can detect
 

6421
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:31,750
pretty good very and they can detect
Cent or I guess Nest perectly yeah lar

6422
01:56:31,750 --> 01:56:31,760
Cent or I guess Nest perectly yeah lar
 

6423
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:33,149
Cent or I guess Nest perectly yeah lar
yeah pretty much so you're not just

6424
01:56:33,149 --> 01:56:33,159
yeah pretty much so you're not just
 

6425
01:56:33,159 --> 01:56:34,510
yeah pretty much so you're not just
looking for long dependencies you're

6426
01:56:34,510 --> 01:56:34,520
looking for long dependencies you're
 

6427
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:36,270
looking for long dependencies you're
just literally looking for Center bed

6428
01:56:36,270 --> 01:56:36,280
just literally looking for Center bed
 

6429
01:56:36,280 --> 01:56:37,629
just literally looking for Center bed
yeah we are in this case in these case

6430
01:56:37,629 --> 01:56:37,639
yeah we are in this case in these case
 

6431
01:56:37,639 --> 01:56:39,350
yeah we are in this case in these case
but long dependencies are they're highly

6432
01:56:39,350 --> 01:56:39,360
but long dependencies are they're highly
 

6433
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:41,470
but long dependencies are they're highly
correlated these to this so like a

6434
01:56:41,470 --> 01:56:41,480
correlated these to this so like a
 

6435
01:56:41,480 --> 01:56:43,350
correlated these to this so like a
center embedding is a is a big bombb you

6436
01:56:43,350 --> 01:56:43,360
center embedding is a is a big bombb you
 

6437
01:56:43,360 --> 01:56:45,069

throw inside inside of a sentence that
 

6439
01:56:45,079 --> 01:56:47,990

just blows up the that that makes can I

6440
01:56:47,990 --> 01:56:48,000
just blows up the that that makes can I
 

6441
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,550
just blows up the that that makes can I
read a sentence for for you from these

6442
01:56:49,550 --> 01:56:49,560
read a sentence for for you from these
 

6443
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:51,430
read a sentence for for you from these
things I I see I I mean this is just

01:56:51,430 --> 01:56:51,440
things I I see I I mean this is just
 

6445
01:56:51,440 --> 01:56:53,069
things I I see I I mean this is just
like one of the things said this is just

6446
01:56:53,069 --> 01:56:53,079
like one of the things said this is just
 

6447
01:56:53,079 --> 01:56:54,950
like one of the things said this is just
my eyes might glaze over in the middle

6448
01:56:54,950 --> 01:56:54,960

6477
01:57:21,800 --> 01:57:24,270
the Cent embedded bit there is just for
some reason there's a definition they

6478
01:57:24,270 --> 01:57:24,280
some reason there's a definition they
 

6479
01:57:24,280 --> 01:57:27,189
some reason there's a definition they
throw the definition of what payments

and the verb let's how about don't do
 

6485
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:32,990
and the verb let's how about don't do
that how about put the definition

6486

6495
01:57:40,159 --> 01:57:42,629
that's that's what happens you just
throw your definitions you use a word a

6496
01:57:42,629 --> 01:57:42,639
throw your definitions you use a word a
 

6497
01:57:42,639 --> 01:57:44,709
throw your definitions you use a word a
couple words and then you define it and

01:57:44,709 --> 01:57:44,719
couple words and then you define it and
 

6499
01:57:44,719 --> 01:57:46,910
couple words and then you define it and
then you continue the sentence like just

they we asked them to rate materials
which are with the same meaning with

6516
01:58:01,189 --> 01:58:01,199
which are with the same meaning with
 

6517
01:58:01,199 --> 01:58:03,069
which are with the same meaning with
with uncenter bed and centered and they

6518
01:58:03,069 --> 01:58:03,079
with uncenter bed and centered and they
 

6519
01:58:03,079 --> 01:58:05,390
with uncenter bed and centered and they
much preferred the uncentered versions

6520
01:58:05,390 --> 01:58:05,400
much preferred the uncentered versions
 

6521
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:07,229

on the comprehens on the reading side

6522
01:58:07,229 --> 01:58:07,239
on the comprehens on the reading side
 

6523
01:58:07,239 --> 01:58:08,790
on the comprehens on the reading side
yeah well and we asked them we asked

6524
01:58:08,790 --> 01:58:08,800
yeah well and we asked them we asked
 

6525
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:10,510
yeah well and we asked them we asked
them would you hire someone who writes

6526
01:58:10,510 --> 01:58:10,520
them would you hire someone who writes
 

6527
01:58:10,520 --> 01:58:11,750
them would you hire someone who writes
like this or this we asked them all

6528
01:58:11,750 --> 01:58:11,760
like this or this we asked them all
 

6529
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:13,510
like this or this we asked them all
kinds of questions and they always

6530
01:58:13,510 --> 01:58:13,520
kinds of questions and they always
 

6531
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:15,589
kinds of questions and they always
preferred the less complicated version

6532
01:58:15,589 --> 01:58:15,599
preferred the less complicated version
 

6533
01:58:15,599 --> 01:58:17,350
preferred the less complicated version
all of them so I don't even think they

6534
01:58:17,350 --> 01:58:17,360
all of them so I don't even think they
 

6535
01:58:17,360 --> 01:58:19,310
all of them so I don't even think they
want it this way yeah but how did it

6536
01:58:19,310 --> 01:58:19,320
want it this way yeah but how did it
 

6537
01:58:19,320 --> 01:58:20,510
want it this way yeah but how did it
happen how did it happen that's a very

6538
01:58:20,510 --> 01:58:20,520
happen how did it happen that's a very
 

6539
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:22,550
happen how did it happen that's a very
good question and and and the answer is

6540
01:58:22,550 --> 01:58:22,560
good question and and and the answer is
 

6541
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:25,750
good question and and and the answer is
I still don't know but I have some

6542
01:58:25,750 --> 01:58:25,760
I still don't know but I have some
 

6543
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:27,870
I still don't know but I have some
theories well our our best theory at the

6544
01:58:27,870 --> 01:58:27,880
theories well our our best theory at the
 

6545
01:58:27,880 --> 01:58:30,550
theories well our our best theory at the
moment is that there's there's actually

6546
01:58:30,550 --> 01:58:30,560
moment is that there's there's actually
 

6547
01:58:30,560 --> 01:58:33,229
moment is that there's there's actually
some kind of a performative meaning in

6548
01:58:33,229 --> 01:58:33,239
some kind of a performative meaning in
 

6549
01:58:33,239 --> 01:58:35,750
some kind of a performative meaning in
the center embedding in the style which

6550
01:58:35,750 --> 01:58:35,760
the center embedding in the style which
 

6551
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:37,550
the center embedding in the style which
tells you it's legal ease we think that

6552
01:58:37,550 --> 01:58:37,560
tells you it's legal ease we think that
 

6553
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:39,030
tells you it's legal ease we think that
that's the kind of a style which tells

6554
01:58:39,030 --> 01:58:39,040
that's the kind of a style which tells
 

6555
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:41,189
that's the kind of a style which tells
you it's legal ease like that's a it's a

6556
01:58:41,189 --> 01:58:41,199
you it's legal ease like that's a it's a
 

6557
01:58:41,199 --> 01:58:43,950
you it's legal ease like that's a it's a
reasonable guess and maybe it's just so

6558
01:58:43,950 --> 01:58:43,960
reasonable guess and maybe it's just so
 

6559
01:58:43,960 --> 01:58:46,750
reasonable guess and maybe it's just so
for instance if you're like it's like a

6560
01:58:46,750 --> 01:58:46,760
for instance if you're like it's like a
 

6561
01:58:46,760 --> 01:58:48,669
for instance if you're like it's like a
magic spell so we kind of call this a

6562
01:58:48,669 --> 01:58:48,679
magic spell so we kind of call this a
 

6563
01:58:48,679 --> 01:58:50,910
magic spell so we kind of call this a
magic spell hypothesis so when you give

6564
01:58:50,910 --> 01:58:50,920
magic spell hypothesis so when you give
 

6565
01:58:50,920 --> 01:58:52,350
magic spell hypothesis so when you give
them when you tell someone to put a

6566
01:58:52,350 --> 01:58:52,360
them when you tell someone to put a
 

6567
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:53,629
them when you tell someone to put a
magic spell on someone what what do you

6568
01:58:53,629 --> 01:58:53,639
magic spell on someone what what do you
 

6569
01:58:53,639 --> 01:58:55,950
magic spell on someone what what do you
do they you know people know what a

6570
01:58:55,950 --> 01:58:55,960
do they you know people know what a
 

6571
01:58:55,960 --> 01:58:57,709

6573
01:58:57,719 --> 01:58:59,430
magic spell is and they they do a lot of
rhyming you know that's that's kind of

6574
01:58:59,430 --> 01:58:59,440
rhyming you know that's that's kind of
 

6575
01:58:59,440 --> 01:59:00,950
rhyming you know that's that's kind of
what people will tend to do they'll do

6576
01:59:00,950 --> 01:59:00,960
what people will tend to do they'll do
 

6577
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:02,510
what people will tend to do they'll do
rhyming and they'll do sort of like some

6578
01:59:02,510 --> 01:59:02,520
rhyming and they'll do sort of like some
 

6579
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:04,430
rhyming and they'll do sort of like some
kind of poetry kind of thing Abracadabra

6580
01:59:04,430 --> 01:59:04,440
kind of poetry kind of thing Abracadabra
 

6581
01:59:04,440 --> 01:59:06,950
kind of poetry kind of thing Abracadabra
type of thing exactly yeah and um maybe

6582
01:59:06,950 --> 01:59:06,960
type of thing exactly yeah and um maybe
 

6583
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:09,229
type of thing exactly yeah and um maybe
that's there's a syntactic sort of

6584
01:59:09,229 --> 01:59:09,239
that's there's a syntactic sort of
 

6585
01:59:09,239 --> 01:59:11,629
that's there's a syntactic sort of
reflex here of a of a magic spell which

6586
01:59:11,629 --> 01:59:11,639
reflex here of a of a magic spell which
 

6587
01:59:11,639 --> 01:59:13,669
reflex here of a of a magic spell which
is Centum betting and so that's like oh

6588
01:59:13,669 --> 01:59:13,679
is Centum betting and so that's like oh
 

6589

right that's that's what legal contracts
are trying to enforce on you right and

6602
01:59:27,950 --> 01:59:27,960
are trying to enforce on you right and
 

6603
01:59:27,960 --> 01:59:31,510
are trying to enforce on you right and
so maybe that's like a a form which has

6604
01:59:31,510 --> 01:59:31,520
so maybe that's like a a form which has
 

6605
01:59:31,520 --> 01:59:33,109
so maybe that's like a a form which has
this is like an abstract very abstract

6606
01:59:33,109 --> 01:59:33,119
this is like an abstract very abstract
 

6607
01:59:33,119 --> 01:59:35,310
this is like an abstract very abstract
form srum betting which has a has a has

6608
01:59:35,310 --> 01:59:35,320
form srum betting which has a has a has
 

6609
01:59:35,320 --> 01:59:37,910
form srum betting which has a has a has
a meaning associated with it well don't

6610
01:59:37,910 --> 01:59:37,920
a meaning associated with it well don't
 

6611
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:41,030
a meaning associated with it well don't
you think there's an incentive for

6612
01:59:41,030 --> 01:59:41,040
you think there's an incentive for
 

6613
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:44,149
you think there's an incentive for
lawyers to generate things that are hard

6614
01:59:44,149 --> 01:59:44,159
lawyers to generate things that are hard
 

6615
01:59:44,159 --> 01:59:46,069
lawyers to generate things that are hard
to understand that was our one of our

6616
01:59:46,069 --> 01:59:46,079
to understand that was our one of our
 

6617
01:59:46,079 --> 01:59:47,629
to understand that was our one of our
working hypothesis we just couldn't find

6618
01:59:47,629 --> 01:59:47,639
working hypothesis we just couldn't find
 

6619
01:59:47,639 --> 01:59:49,870
working hypothesis we just couldn't find
any evidence of that no lawyers also

6620
01:59:49,870 --> 01:59:49,880
any evidence of that no lawyers also
 

6621
01:59:49,880 --> 01:59:52,189
any evidence of that no lawyers also
don't understand it but you're creating

6622
01:59:52,189 --> 01:59:52,199
don't understand it but you're creating
 

6623
01:59:52,199 --> 01:59:54,030
don't understand it but you're creating
space why

6624
01:59:54,030 --> 01:59:54,040
space why
 

6625
01:59:54,040 --> 01:59:57,950
space why
you I mean you ask in a communist Soviet

6626
01:59:57,950 --> 01:59:57,960
you I mean you ask in a communist Soviet
 

6627

leads to Chernobyl or something like
 

6637
02:00:09,239 --> 02:00:13,270
leads to Chernobyl or something like
this um I think the incentives under

02:00:13,270 --> 02:00:13,280
this um I think the incentives under
 

6639
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:15,390
this um I think the incentives under
which you operate are not always

that system so like it just feels like a

6644
02:00:21,350 --> 02:00:21,360
that system so like it just feels like a
 

6645
02:00:21,360 --> 02:00:25,310
that system so like it just feels like a
strange coincidence that like there is

6646
02:00:25,310 --> 02:00:25,320
strange coincidence that like there is
 

6647
02:00:25,320 --> 02:00:27,069
strange coincidence that like there is
benefit if you just zoom out and look at

6648
02:00:27,069 --> 02:00:27,079
benefit if you just zoom out and look at
 

6649
02:00:27,079 --> 02:00:28,950
benefit if you just zoom out and look at
the system as opposed to ask individual

6650
02:00:28,950 --> 02:00:28,960
the system as opposed to ask individual

understand is going to make a lot of
 

6655
02:00:33,679 --> 02:00:36,149
understand is going to make a lot of
people money yeah like there's going to

6656
02:00:36,149 --> 02:00:36,159
people money yeah like there's going to
 

6657
02:00:36,159 --> 02:00:37,870
people money yeah like there's going to
you're going to need a

6658
02:00:37,870 --> 02:00:37,880
you're going to need a
 

6659
02:00:37,880 --> 02:00:40,470
you're going to need a
lawyer uh to figure that out I guess

6660
02:00:40,470 --> 02:00:40,480
lawyer uh to figure that out I guess
 

6661
02:00:40,480 --> 02:00:42,470
lawyer uh to figure that out I guess
from the perspective of the individual

6662

from the perspective of the individual
 

6663
02:00:42,480 --> 02:00:43,950
from the perspective of the individual
but then that could be the performative

6664
02:00:43,950 --> 02:00:43,960
but then that could be the performative
 

6665
02:00:43,960 --> 02:00:45,470
but then that could be the performative
as it could be as opposed to the

6666
02:00:45,470 --> 02:00:45,480
as it could be as opposed to the
 

6667
02:00:45,480 --> 02:00:47,629
as it could be as opposed to the
incentive driven to be complicated could

6668
02:00:47,629 --> 02:00:47,639
incentive driven to be complicated could
 

6669
02:00:47,639 --> 02:00:50,510
incentive driven to be complicated could
be performative to where we lawyers

6670
02:00:50,510 --> 02:00:50,520
be performative to where we lawyers
 

6671
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:53,109
be performative to where we lawyers
speak in this sophistic at way and you

just be a few bad apples in a way which
 

6695

are driving the effect in some way
influential bad apples at the sort of uh

02:01:20,390 --> 02:01:20,400
influential bad apples at the sort of uh
 

6699
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:22,149
influential bad apples at the sort of uh
that everybody looks up to or whatever

02:01:25,310 --> 02:01:25,320
they like Central figures and and how
 

6703
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:26,830
they like Central figures and and how
you know but it turns but it is it is

you know but it turns but it is it is
 

6705
02:01:26,840 --> 02:01:29,189
you know but it turns but it is it is
kind of interesting that among our 100

6706
02:01:29,189 --> 02:01:29,199
kind of interesting that among our 100
 

6707
02:01:29,199 --> 02:01:31,430
kind of interesting that among our 100
lawyers they did not share they didn't

6708
02:01:31,430 --> 02:01:31,440
lawyers they did not share they didn't
 

6709
02:01:31,440 --> 02:01:34,350
lawyers they did not share they didn't
want this they really didn't like it so

6710
02:01:34,350 --> 02:01:34,360
want this they really didn't like it so
 

6711
02:01:34,360 --> 02:01:36,470
want this they really didn't like it so
it they weren't better at than regular

6712
02:01:36,470 --> 02:01:36,480
it they weren't better at than regular
 

6713
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:38,790
it they weren't better at than regular
people at comprehending it or they were

6714
02:01:38,790 --> 02:01:38,800
people at comprehending it or they were
 

6715
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:40,790
people at comprehending it or they were
on average better but they had the same

6716
02:01:40,790 --> 02:01:40,800
on average better but they had the same
 

6717
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:42,069
on average better but they had the same
difference the same same difference

6718
02:01:42,069 --> 02:01:42,079
difference the same same difference
 

6719
02:01:42,079 --> 02:01:44,270
difference the same same difference
exact same difference so they but I they

6720
02:01:44,270 --> 02:01:44,280
exact same difference so they but I they
 

6721
02:01:44,280 --> 02:01:48,069
exact same difference so they but I they
wanted it fixed so they they also and so

6722
02:01:48,069 --> 02:01:48,079
wanted it fixed so they they also and so
 

6723
02:01:48,079 --> 02:01:50,669
wanted it fixed so they they also and so
that that gave us hope that because it

6724
02:01:50,669 --> 02:01:50,679
that that gave us hope that because it
 

6725
02:01:50,679 --> 02:01:52,470
that that gave us hope that because it
actually isn't very hard to construct

6726
02:01:52,470 --> 02:01:52,480
actually isn't very hard to construct
 

6727
02:01:52,480 --> 02:01:55,589
actually isn't very hard to construct
a a material which is uncenter embedded

6728
02:01:55,589 --> 02:01:55,599
a a material which is uncenter embedded
 

6729
02:01:55,599 --> 02:01:57,270
a a material which is uncenter embedded
and has the same meaning it's not very

6730
02:01:57,270 --> 02:01:57,280
and has the same meaning it's not very
 

6731
02:01:57,280 --> 02:01:58,550
and has the same meaning it's not very
hard to do just basically in that

6732
02:01:58,550 --> 02:01:58,560
hard to do just basically in that
 

6733
02:01:58,560 --> 02:01:59,390
hard to do just basically in that
situation you're just putting

6734
02:01:59,390 --> 02:01:59,400
situation you're just putting
 

6735
02:01:59,400 --> 02:02:01,229
situation you're just putting
definitions outside of the subject verb

6736
02:02:01,229 --> 02:02:01,239
definitions outside of the subject verb
 

6737
02:02:01,239 --> 02:02:02,550

02:02:02,550 --> 02:02:02,560
relation in that particular example and
 

6739
02:02:02,560 --> 02:02:04,990
relation in that particular example and
that's kind of that's pretty general

6740
02:02:04,990 --> 02:02:05,000
that's kind of that's pretty general

that's kind of that's pretty general
what they're doing is just throwing

6742
02:02:06,350 --> 02:02:06,360
what they're doing is just throwing
 

6743
02:02:06,360 --> 02:02:07,709
what they're doing is just throwing
stuff in there which you didn't have to

stuff in there which you didn't have to
 

6745
02:02:07,719 --> 02:02:09,750
stuff in there which you didn't have to
put in there it there's extra words

6746
02:02:09,750 --> 02:02:09,760
put in there it there's extra words
 

6747
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:12,270
put in there it there's extra words
involved typically um you may need a few

02:02:12,270 --> 02:02:12,280
involved typically um you may need a few
 

6749
02:02:12,280 --> 02:02:14,350

it in that one sentence then there's no

6756
02:02:20,709 --> 02:02:20,719
it in that one sentence then there's no
 

6757
02:02:20,719 --> 02:02:23,669
it in that one sentence then there's no
reason to introduce extra extra terms

6758
02:02:23,669 --> 02:02:23,679
reason to introduce extra extra terms
 

6759
02:02:23,679 --> 02:02:25,470
reason to introduce extra extra terms
but so we might have a few more words

6760
02:02:25,470 --> 02:02:25,480
but so we might have a few more words
 

6761
02:02:25,480 --> 02:02:28,189
but so we might have a few more words
but it'll be easier to understand um so

6762
02:02:28,189 --> 02:02:28,199
but it'll be easier to understand um so
 

6763
02:02:28,199 --> 02:02:30,750
but it'll be easier to understand um so
I mean I I have hope that now that may

6764
02:02:30,750 --> 02:02:30,760
I mean I I have hope that now that may
 

6765
02:02:30,760 --> 02:02:34,109
I mean I I have hope that now that may
maybe we can make legal ease less uh

6766
02:02:34,109 --> 02:02:34,119
maybe we can make legal ease less uh
 

6767
02:02:34,119 --> 02:02:36,109
maybe we can make legal ease less uh
less convoluted in this so maybe the the

6768
02:02:36,109 --> 02:02:36,119
less convoluted in this so maybe the the
 

6769
02:02:36,119 --> 02:02:38,030
less convoluted in this so maybe the the
next president of the United States can

6770
02:02:38,030 --> 02:02:38,040
next president of the United States can
 

6771
02:02:38,040 --> 02:02:39,830
next president of the United States can
instead of saying generic things say

6772
02:02:39,830 --> 02:02:39,840
instead of saying generic things say
 

6773
02:02:39,840 --> 02:02:43,550
instead of saying generic things say
exactly I ban uh cent center

6774
02:02:43,550 --> 02:02:43,560
exactly I ban uh cent center
 

6775
02:02:43,560 --> 02:02:45,910
exactly I ban uh cent center
embeddings and make Ted the uh the

6776
02:02:45,910 --> 02:02:45,920
embeddings and make Ted the uh the
 

6777
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:49,550
embeddings and make Ted the uh the
language Zar of the Eric Martinez is the

6778
02:02:49,550 --> 02:02:49,560
language Zar of the Eric Martinez is the
 

6779
02:02:49,560 --> 02:02:51,109
language Zar of the Eric Martinez is the
guy you should really put in there yeah

6780
02:02:51,109 --> 02:02:51,119
guy you should really put in there yeah
 

6781
02:02:51,119 --> 02:02:52,550
guy you should really put in there yeah
yeah

6782
02:02:52,550 --> 02:02:52,560
yeah
 

6783
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:55,510
yeah
I mean but Center Bings are the the the

6784
02:02:55,510 --> 02:02:55,520
I mean but Center Bings are the the the
 

6785
02:02:55,520 --> 02:02:57,629
I mean but Center Bings are the the the
bad thing to have that's right so if you

6786
02:02:57,629 --> 02:02:57,639
bad thing to have that's right so if you
 

6787
02:02:57,639 --> 02:02:59,430
bad thing to have that's right so if you
get rid of that that'll do a lot of it

6788
02:02:59,430 --> 02:02:59,440
get rid of that that'll do a lot of it
 

6789
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:01,709
get rid of that that'll do a lot of it
that fixs a lot it's fascinating that is

6790
02:03:01,709 --> 02:03:01,719
that fixs a lot it's fascinating that is
 

6791
02:03:01,719 --> 02:03:04,430
that fixs a lot it's fascinating that is
so fascinating yeah um and it just

6792
02:03:04,430 --> 02:03:04,440
so fascinating yeah um and it just
 

6793
02:03:04,440 --> 02:03:06,270
so fascinating yeah um and it just
really fascinating on many fronts that

6794
02:03:06,270 --> 02:03:06,280
really fascinating on many fronts that
 

6795
02:03:06,280 --> 02:03:07,709
really fascinating on many fronts that
humans are just not able to deal with

6796
02:03:07,709 --> 02:03:07,719
humans are just not able to deal with
 

6797
02:03:07,719 --> 02:03:09,629
humans are just not able to deal with
this kind of thing and that language

6798
02:03:09,629 --> 02:03:09,639
this kind of thing and that language
 

6799
02:03:09,639 --> 02:03:11,030
this kind of thing and that language
because of that evolved in the way it

6800
02:03:11,030 --> 02:03:11,040
because of that evolved in the way it
 

6801
02:03:11,040 --> 02:03:13,589
because of that evolved in the way it
did it's fascinating so one of the

6802
02:03:13,589 --> 02:03:13,599
did it's fascinating so one of the
 

6803
02:03:13,599 --> 02:03:16,510
did it's fascinating so one of the
mathematical formulations you have when

6804
02:03:16,510 --> 02:03:16,520
mathematical formulations you have when
 

6805
02:03:16,520 --> 02:03:18,950
mathematical formulations you have when
talking about languages communication is

6806
02:03:18,950 --> 02:03:18,960
talking about languages communication is
 

6807
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:22,189
talking about languages communication is
uh this idea of noisy channels

6808
02:03:22,189 --> 02:03:22,199
uh this idea of noisy channels
 

6809
02:03:22,199 --> 02:03:25,510
uh this idea of noisy channels
what's a noisy channel so that's about

6810
02:03:25,510 --> 02:03:25,520
what's a noisy channel so that's about
 

6811
02:03:25,520 --> 02:03:27,589
what's a noisy channel so that's about
communication and so this is going back

6812
02:03:27,589 --> 02:03:27,599
communication and so this is going back
 

6813
02:03:27,599 --> 02:03:30,270
communication and so this is going back
to Shannon so Shannon Claud Shannon was

6814
02:03:30,270 --> 02:03:30,280
to Shannon so Shannon Claud Shannon was
 

6815
02:03:30,280 --> 02:03:34,229
to Shannon so Shannon Claud Shannon was
a u a student at MIT in the 40s and so

6816
02:03:34,229 --> 02:03:34,239
a u a student at MIT in the 40s and so
 

6817
02:03:34,239 --> 02:03:37,149
a u a student at MIT in the 40s and so
he wrote this very influential piece of

6818
02:03:37,149 --> 02:03:37,159
he wrote this very influential piece of
 

6819
02:03:37,159 --> 02:03:38,830
he wrote this very influential piece of
work about communication Theory or

6820
02:03:38,830 --> 02:03:38,840
work about communication Theory or
 

6821
02:03:38,840 --> 02:03:42,030
work about communication Theory or
information Theory and uh he was

6822
02:03:42,030 --> 02:03:42,040
information Theory and uh he was
 

6823
02:03:42,040 --> 02:03:43,750
information Theory and uh he was
interested in human language actually he

6824
02:03:43,750 --> 02:03:43,760
interested in human language actually he
 

6825
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:45,069
interested in human language actually he
was trying to he was interested in this

6826
02:03:45,069 --> 02:03:45,079
was trying to he was interested in this
 

6827
02:03:45,079 --> 02:03:48,709
was trying to he was interested in this
problem of communication of getting a a

6828
02:03:48,709 --> 02:03:48,719
problem of communication of getting a a
 

6829
02:03:48,719 --> 02:03:51,310
problem of communication of getting a a
a message from my head to to your head

6830
02:03:51,310 --> 02:03:51,320
a message from my head to to your head
 

6831
02:03:51,320 --> 02:03:54,030
a message from my head to to your head
and and so and he he was concerned or

6832
02:03:54,030 --> 02:03:54,040
and and so and he he was concerned or
 

6833
02:03:54,040 --> 02:03:58,549
and and so and he he was concerned or
interested in um what was a robust way

6834
02:03:58,549 --> 02:03:58,559
interested in um what was a robust way
 

6835
02:03:58,559 --> 02:04:00,629
interested in um what was a robust way
to do that and so that assuming we both

6836
02:04:00,629 --> 02:04:00,639
to do that and so that assuming we both
 

6837
02:04:00,639 --> 02:04:02,870
to do that and so that assuming we both
speak the same language we both already

6838
02:04:02,870 --> 02:04:02,880
speak the same language we both already
 

6839
02:04:02,880 --> 02:04:04,790
speak the same language we both already
speak English whatever you know whatever

6840
02:04:04,790 --> 02:04:04,800
speak English whatever you know whatever
 

6841
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:06,950
speak English whatever you know whatever
the language is we we speak that what is

6842
02:04:06,950 --> 02:04:06,960
the language is we we speak that what is
 

6843
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:10,549
the language is we we speak that what is
a way that I can say the language so

6844
02:04:10,549 --> 02:04:10,559
a way that I can say the language so
 

6845
02:04:10,559 --> 02:04:12,470
a way that I can say the language so
that it's most likely to get the signal

6846
02:04:12,470 --> 02:04:12,480
that it's most likely to get the signal
 

6847
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:15,270
that it's most likely to get the signal
that I want uh to you and so and then

6848
02:04:15,270 --> 02:04:15,280
that I want uh to you and so and then
 

6849
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:17,229
that I want uh to you and so and then
the the problem there in the

6850
02:04:17,229 --> 02:04:17,239
the the problem there in the
 

6851
02:04:17,239 --> 02:04:19,069
the the problem there in the
communication is the noisy channel is

6852
02:04:19,069 --> 02:04:19,079
communication is the noisy channel is
 

6853
02:04:19,079 --> 02:04:21,430
communication is the noisy channel is
that there's I make there's a lot of

6854
02:04:21,430 --> 02:04:21,440
that there's I make there's a lot of
 

6855
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:24,430
that there's I make there's a lot of
noise no in the system I don't speak

6856
02:04:24,430 --> 02:04:24,440
noise no in the system I don't speak
 

6857
02:04:24,440 --> 02:04:27,510
noise no in the system I don't speak
perfectly I make errors that's noise um

6858
02:04:27,510 --> 02:04:27,520
perfectly I make errors that's noise um
 

6859
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:29,229
perfectly I make errors that's noise um
there's background noise you know you

6860
02:04:29,229 --> 02:04:29,239
there's background noise you know you
 

6861
02:04:29,239 --> 02:04:31,390
there's background noise you know you
know that as like a literal literal

6862
02:04:31,390 --> 02:04:31,400
know that as like a literal literal
 

6863
02:04:31,400 --> 02:04:32,790
know that as like a literal literal
background noise there is like white

6864
02:04:32,790 --> 02:04:32,800
background noise there is like white
 

6865
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:34,109
background noise there is like white
noise in the background or some other

6866
02:04:34,109 --> 02:04:34,119
noise in the background or some other
 

6867
02:04:34,119 --> 02:04:36,310
noise in the background or some other
kind of noise or some speaking going on

6868
02:04:36,310 --> 02:04:36,320
kind of noise or some speaking going on
 

6869
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:38,589
kind of noise or some speaking going on
that you or just you're at a party

6870
02:04:38,589 --> 02:04:38,599
that you or just you're at a party
 

6871
02:04:38,599 --> 02:04:39,910
that you or just you're at a party
that's background noise you're trying to

6872
02:04:39,910 --> 02:04:39,920
that's background noise you're trying to
 

6873
02:04:39,920 --> 02:04:41,270
that's background noise you're trying to
hear someone it's hard to understand

6874
02:04:41,270 --> 02:04:41,280
hear someone it's hard to understand
 

6875
02:04:41,280 --> 02:04:42,310
hear someone it's hard to understand
them because there's all this other

6876
02:04:42,310 --> 02:04:42,320
them because there's all this other
 

6877
02:04:42,320 --> 02:04:44,310
them because there's all this other
stuff going on in the background um and

6878
02:04:44,310 --> 02:04:44,320
stuff going on in the background um and
 

6879
02:04:44,320 --> 02:04:45,510
stuff going on in the background um and
and then there's noise on the

6880
02:04:45,510 --> 02:04:45,520
and then there's noise on the
 

6881
02:04:45,520 --> 02:04:47,629
and then there's noise on the
communication on the commun on the uh

6882
02:04:47,629 --> 02:04:47,639
communication on the commun on the uh
 

6883
02:04:47,639 --> 02:04:50,109
communication on the commun on the uh
receiver side so that you have some

6884
02:04:50,109 --> 02:04:50,119
receiver side so that you have some
 

6885
02:04:50,119 --> 02:04:52,549
receiver side so that you have some
problem maybe understanding me for stuff

6886
02:04:52,549 --> 02:04:52,559
problem maybe understanding me for stuff
 

6887
02:04:52,559 --> 02:04:54,350
problem maybe understanding me for stuff
that's just internal to you in some way

6888
02:04:54,350 --> 02:04:54,360
that's just internal to you in some way
 

6889
02:04:54,360 --> 02:04:56,149
that's just internal to you in some way
so you've got some other problems

6890
02:04:56,149 --> 02:04:56,159
so you've got some other problems
 

6891
02:04:56,159 --> 02:04:58,549
so you've got some other problems
whatever with uh understanding for

6892
02:04:58,549 --> 02:04:58,559
whatever with uh understanding for
 

6893
02:04:58,559 --> 02:05:00,310
whatever with uh understanding for
whatever reasons maybe you're maybe you

6894
02:05:00,310 --> 02:05:00,320
whatever reasons maybe you're maybe you
 

6895
02:05:00,320 --> 02:05:02,149
whatever reasons maybe you're maybe you
had too much to drink you know who knows

6896
02:05:02,149 --> 02:05:02,159
had too much to drink you know who knows
 

6897
02:05:02,159 --> 02:05:03,990
had too much to drink you know who knows
why you're not able to pay attention to

6898
02:05:03,990 --> 02:05:04,000
why you're not able to pay attention to
 

6899
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,910
why you're not able to pay attention to
the signal so that's the noisy Channel

6900
02:05:05,910 --> 02:05:05,920
the signal so that's the noisy Channel
 

6901
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:07,750
the signal so that's the noisy Channel
and so so that language if it's

6902
02:05:07,750 --> 02:05:07,760
and so so that language if it's
 

6903
02:05:07,760 --> 02:05:10,430
and so so that language if it's
Communication System we are trying to

6904
02:05:10,430 --> 02:05:10,440
Communication System we are trying to
 

6905
02:05:10,440 --> 02:05:13,030
Communication System we are trying to
optimize in some sense the the passing

6906
02:05:13,030 --> 02:05:13,040
optimize in some sense the the passing
 

6907
02:05:13,040 --> 02:05:14,549
optimize in some sense the the passing
of the message from one side to the

6908
02:05:14,549 --> 02:05:14,559
of the message from one side to the
 

6909
02:05:14,559 --> 02:05:19,310
of the message from one side to the
other and um so it turn I mean one idea

6910
02:05:19,310 --> 02:05:19,320
other and um so it turn I mean one idea
 

6911
02:05:19,320 --> 02:05:21,750
other and um so it turn I mean one idea
is that maybe you know aspects of like

6912
02:05:21,750 --> 02:05:21,760
is that maybe you know aspects of like
 

6913
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:23,350
is that maybe you know aspects of like
word order for example might have

6914
02:05:23,350 --> 02:05:23,360
word order for example might have
 

6915
02:05:23,360 --> 02:05:25,549
word order for example might have
optimized in some way to to make

6916
02:05:25,549 --> 02:05:25,559
optimized in some way to to make
 

6917
02:05:25,559 --> 02:05:28,549
optimized in some way to to make
language a little more easy to be passed

6918
02:05:28,549 --> 02:05:28,559
language a little more easy to be passed
 

6919
02:05:28,559 --> 02:05:30,950
language a little more easy to be passed
from speaker to listener so Shannon's

6920
02:05:30,950 --> 02:05:30,960
from speaker to listener so Shannon's
 

6921
02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:32,589
from speaker to listener so Shannon's
the guy that did this stuff way back in

6922
02:05:32,589 --> 02:05:32,599
the guy that did this stuff way back in
 

6923
02:05:32,599 --> 02:05:33,790
the guy that did this stuff way back in
the 40s he you know it's very

6924
02:05:33,790 --> 02:05:33,800
the 40s he you know it's very
 

6925
02:05:33,800 --> 02:05:35,270
the 40s he you know it's very
interesting you know historically he was

6926
02:05:35,270 --> 02:05:35,280
interesting you know historically he was
 

6927
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:37,310
interesting you know historically he was
interested in working in linguistics he

6928
02:05:37,310 --> 02:05:37,320
interested in working in linguistics he
 

6929
02:05:37,320 --> 02:05:39,629
interested in working in linguistics he
was in at MIT and he did this is his

6930
02:05:39,629 --> 02:05:39,639
was in at MIT and he did this is his
 

6931
02:05:39,639 --> 02:05:41,149
was in at MIT and he did this is his
master's thesis of all things you know

6932
02:05:41,149 --> 02:05:41,159
master's thesis of all things you know
 

6933
02:05:41,159 --> 02:05:42,990
master's thesis of all things you know
it's crazy how much how much he did for

6934
02:05:42,990 --> 02:05:43,000
it's crazy how much how much he did for
 

6935
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,310
it's crazy how much how much he did for
his master's thesis in 1948 I think or

6936
02:05:45,310 --> 02:05:45,320
his master's thesis in 1948 I think or
 

6937
02:05:45,320 --> 02:05:47,470
his master's thesis in 1948 I think or
49 something and and he wanted to keep

6938
02:05:47,470 --> 02:05:47,480
49 something and and he wanted to keep
 

6939
02:05:47,480 --> 02:05:49,470
49 something and and he wanted to keep
working in language and it it just

6940
02:05:49,470 --> 02:05:49,480
working in language and it it just
 

6941
02:05:49,480 --> 02:05:52,270
working in language and it it just
wasn't a popular communication

6942
02:05:52,270 --> 02:05:52,280
wasn't a popular communication
 

6943
02:05:52,280 --> 02:05:55,069
wasn't a popular communication
as a as a reason a source for what

6944
02:05:55,069 --> 02:05:55,079
as a as a reason a source for what
 

6945
02:05:55,079 --> 02:05:56,870
as a as a reason a source for what
language was wasn't popular at the time

6946
02:05:56,870 --> 02:05:56,880
language was wasn't popular at the time
 

6947
02:05:56,880 --> 02:05:58,709
language was wasn't popular at the time
so Chomsky was becoming was moving in

6948
02:05:58,709 --> 02:05:58,719
so Chomsky was becoming was moving in
 

6949
02:05:58,719 --> 02:06:00,589
so Chomsky was becoming was moving in
there he was and he just wasn't able to

6950
02:06:00,589 --> 02:06:00,599
there he was and he just wasn't able to
 

6951
02:06:00,599 --> 02:06:02,790
there he was and he just wasn't able to
get a a handle there I think and so uh

6952
02:06:02,790 --> 02:06:02,800
get a a handle there I think and so uh
 

6953
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:05,669
get a a handle there I think and so uh
and so he moved to bellhs and worked on

6954
02:06:05,669 --> 02:06:05,679
and so he moved to bellhs and worked on
 

6955
02:06:05,679 --> 02:06:07,589
and so he moved to bellhs and worked on
communication uh from a mathematical

6956
02:06:07,589 --> 02:06:07,599
communication uh from a mathematical
 

6957
02:06:07,599 --> 02:06:10,149
communication uh from a mathematical
point point of view and was you know uh

6958
02:06:10,149 --> 02:06:10,159
point point of view and was you know uh
 

6959
02:06:10,159 --> 02:06:11,870
point point of view and was you know uh
did all kinds of amazing work and so

6960
02:06:11,870 --> 02:06:11,880
did all kinds of amazing work and so
 

6961
02:06:11,880 --> 02:06:13,790
did all kinds of amazing work and so
he's just more on the signal side versus

6962
02:06:13,790 --> 02:06:13,800
he's just more on the signal side versus
 

6963
02:06:13,800 --> 02:06:16,549
he's just more on the signal side versus
like the language side yeah yeah it

6964
02:06:16,549 --> 02:06:16,559
like the language side yeah yeah it
 

6965
02:06:16,559 --> 02:06:17,750
like the language side yeah yeah it
would have been interesting to see if he

6966
02:06:17,750 --> 02:06:17,760
would have been interesting to see if he
 

6967
02:06:17,760 --> 02:06:19,589
would have been interesting to see if he
pursued the language side that's really

6968
02:06:19,589 --> 02:06:19,599
pursued the language side that's really
 

6969
02:06:19,599 --> 02:06:21,629
pursued the language side that's really
interesting he was interested in that is

6970
02:06:21,629 --> 02:06:21,639
interesting he was interested in that is
 

6971
02:06:21,639 --> 02:06:24,030
interesting he was interested in that is
examples in the 40s are are are kind of

6972
02:06:24,030 --> 02:06:24,040
examples in the 40s are are are kind of
 

6973
02:06:24,040 --> 02:06:26,990
examples in the 40s are are are kind of
like they're very language like like

6974
02:06:26,990 --> 02:06:27,000
like they're very language like like
 

6975
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,750
like they're very language like like
things yeah we can kind of show that

6976
02:06:29,750 --> 02:06:29,760
things yeah we can kind of show that
 

6977
02:06:29,760 --> 02:06:31,830
things yeah we can kind of show that
there's a noisy Channel process going on

6978
02:06:31,830 --> 02:06:31,840
there's a noisy Channel process going on
 

6979
02:06:31,840 --> 02:06:34,470
there's a noisy Channel process going on
in when you're listening to me you know

6980
02:06:34,470 --> 02:06:34,480
in when you're listening to me you know
 

6981
02:06:34,480 --> 02:06:36,030
in when you're listening to me you know
you you can often sort of guess what I

6982
02:06:36,030 --> 02:06:36,040
you you can often sort of guess what I
 

6983
02:06:36,040 --> 02:06:38,189
you you can often sort of guess what I
meant by what I you know uh what you

6984
02:06:38,189 --> 02:06:38,199
meant by what I you know uh what you
 

6985
02:06:38,199 --> 02:06:40,830
meant by what I you know uh what you
think I meant given what I said um and I

6986
02:06:40,830 --> 02:06:40,840
think I meant given what I said um and I
 

6987
02:06:40,840 --> 02:06:42,910
think I meant given what I said um and I
I mean with respect to sort of why

6988
02:06:42,910 --> 02:06:42,920
I mean with respect to sort of why
 

6989
02:06:42,920 --> 02:06:44,910
I mean with respect to sort of why
language looks the way it does we might

6990
02:06:44,910 --> 02:06:44,920
language looks the way it does we might
 

6991
02:06:44,920 --> 02:06:46,750
language looks the way it does we might
there might be sort of as I I alluded to

6992
02:06:46,750 --> 02:06:46,760
there might be sort of as I I alluded to
 

6993
02:06:46,760 --> 02:06:49,030
there might be sort of as I I alluded to
there might be ways in which word order

6994
02:06:49,030 --> 02:06:49,040
there might be ways in which word order
 

6995
02:06:49,040 --> 02:06:51,790
there might be ways in which word order
is is somewhat optimized for for because

6996
02:06:51,790 --> 02:06:51,800
is is somewhat optimized for for because
 

6997
02:06:51,800 --> 02:06:53,669
is is somewhat optimized for for because
of the noisy channel in some way I mean

6998
02:06:53,669 --> 02:06:53,679
of the noisy channel in some way I mean
 

6999
02:06:53,679 --> 02:06:55,669
of the noisy channel in some way I mean
that's really cool to sort of model if

7000
02:06:55,669 --> 02:06:55,679
that's really cool to sort of model if
 

7001
02:06:55,679 --> 02:06:57,629
that's really cool to sort of model if
you don't hear certain parts of a

7002
02:06:57,629 --> 02:06:57,639
you don't hear certain parts of a
 

7003
02:06:57,639 --> 02:07:00,310
you don't hear certain parts of a
sentence or have a some probability of

7004
02:07:00,310 --> 02:07:00,320
sentence or have a some probability of
 

7005
02:07:00,320 --> 02:07:01,470
sentence or have a some probability of
missing that part like how do you

7006
02:07:01,470 --> 02:07:01,480
missing that part like how do you
 

7007
02:07:01,480 --> 02:07:03,189
missing that part like how do you
construct a language that's resilient to

7008
02:07:03,189 --> 02:07:03,199
construct a language that's resilient to
 

7009
02:07:03,199 --> 02:07:05,270
construct a language that's resilient to
that that's somewhat robust to that yeah

7010
02:07:05,270 --> 02:07:05,280
that that's somewhat robust to that yeah
 

7011
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:06,990
that that's somewhat robust to that yeah
that's the idea and then you're kind of

7012
02:07:06,990 --> 02:07:07,000
that's the idea and then you're kind of
 

7013
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:08,790
that's the idea and then you're kind of
saying like the word order and the

7014
02:07:08,790 --> 02:07:08,800
saying like the word order and the
 

7015
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:12,109
saying like the word order and the
syntax of language the dependency length

7016
02:07:12,109 --> 02:07:12,119
syntax of language the dependency length
 

7017
02:07:12,119 --> 02:07:15,229
syntax of language the dependency length
are all helpful yeah well the dependency

7018
02:07:15,229 --> 02:07:15,239
are all helpful yeah well the dependency
 

7019
02:07:15,239 --> 02:07:17,270
are all helpful yeah well the dependency
length is is really about memory really

7020
02:07:17,270 --> 02:07:17,280
length is is really about memory really
 

7021
02:07:17,280 --> 02:07:18,629
length is is really about memory really
I think that's like about sort of what's

7022
02:07:18,629 --> 02:07:18,639
I think that's like about sort of what's
 

7023
02:07:18,639 --> 02:07:21,069
I think that's like about sort of what's
easier or harder to produce in some way

7024
02:07:21,069 --> 02:07:21,079
easier or harder to produce in some way
 

7025
02:07:21,079 --> 02:07:23,030
easier or harder to produce in some way
and these other ideas are about sort of

7026
02:07:23,030 --> 02:07:23,040
and these other ideas are about sort of
 

7027
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:25,109
and these other ideas are about sort of
robustness to communication so the

7028
02:07:25,109 --> 02:07:25,119
robustness to communication so the
 

7029
02:07:25,119 --> 02:07:27,510
robustness to communication so the
problem of potential loss of loss of

7030
02:07:27,510 --> 02:07:27,520
problem of potential loss of loss of
 

7031
02:07:27,520 --> 02:07:30,229
problem of potential loss of loss of
signal due to noise it's so that there

7032
02:07:30,229 --> 02:07:30,239
signal due to noise it's so that there
 

7033
02:07:30,239 --> 02:07:31,950
signal due to noise it's so that there
there may be aspects of word order which

7034
02:07:31,950 --> 02:07:31,960
there may be aspects of word order which
 

7035
02:07:31,960 --> 02:07:34,109
there may be aspects of word order which
is somewhat optimized for that and and

7036
02:07:34,109 --> 02:07:34,119
is somewhat optimized for that and and
 

7037
02:07:34,119 --> 02:07:35,990
is somewhat optimized for that and and
you know we have this one guess in that

7038
02:07:35,990 --> 02:07:36,000
you know we have this one guess in that
 

7039
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:37,709
you know we have this one guess in that
direct and these are kind of Just So

7040
02:07:37,709 --> 02:07:37,719
direct and these are kind of Just So
 

7041
02:07:37,719 --> 02:07:39,069
direct and these are kind of Just So
Stories I have to be you know pretty

7042
02:07:39,069 --> 02:07:39,079
Stories I have to be you know pretty
 

7043
02:07:39,079 --> 02:07:41,030
Stories I have to be you know pretty
Frank they're not like I can't show this

7044
02:07:41,030 --> 02:07:41,040
Frank they're not like I can't show this
 

7045
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:42,629
Frank they're not like I can't show this
is true all we can do is like look at

7046
02:07:42,629 --> 02:07:42,639
is true all we can do is like look at
 

7047
02:07:42,639 --> 02:07:44,310
is true all we can do is like look at
the current languages of the world this

7048
02:07:44,310 --> 02:07:44,320
the current languages of the world this
 

7049
02:07:44,320 --> 02:07:45,750
the current languages of the world this
is a like we can't sort of see how

7050
02:07:45,750 --> 02:07:45,760
is a like we can't sort of see how
 

7051
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:47,589
is a like we can't sort of see how
languages change or anything because

7052
02:07:47,589 --> 02:07:47,599
languages change or anything because
 

7053
02:07:47,599 --> 02:07:49,510
languages change or anything because
we've got these snapshots of a few you

7054
02:07:49,510 --> 02:07:49,520
we've got these snapshots of a few you
 

7055
02:07:49,520 --> 02:07:51,589
we've got these snapshots of a few you
know hundred or a few thousand languages

7056
02:07:51,589 --> 02:07:51,599
know hundred or a few thousand languages
 

7057
02:07:51,599 --> 02:07:53,910
know hundred or a few thousand languages
we don't have we don't really we we

7058
02:07:53,910 --> 02:07:53,920
we don't have we don't really we we
 

7059
02:07:53,920 --> 02:07:55,069
we don't have we don't really we we
can't do the right kinds of

7060
02:07:55,069 --> 02:07:55,079
can't do the right kinds of
 

7061
02:07:55,079 --> 02:07:56,990
can't do the right kinds of
modifications to test these things

7062
02:07:56,990 --> 02:07:57,000
modifications to test these things
 

7063
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,149
modifications to test these things
experimentally and so you know so just

7064
02:07:59,149 --> 02:07:59,159
experimentally and so you know so just
 

7065
02:07:59,159 --> 02:08:00,830
experimentally and so you know so just
take that this with a grain of salt okay

7066
02:08:00,830 --> 02:08:00,840
take that this with a grain of salt okay
 

7067
02:08:00,840 --> 02:08:02,390
take that this with a grain of salt okay
from here this this stuff the dependency

7068
02:08:02,390 --> 02:08:02,400
from here this this stuff the dependency
 

7069
02:08:02,400 --> 02:08:05,109
from here this this stuff the dependency
stuff I can I'm much more solid on and

7070
02:08:05,109 --> 02:08:05,119
stuff I can I'm much more solid on and
 

7071
02:08:05,119 --> 02:08:06,510
stuff I can I'm much more solid on and
like here's what the lengths are and

7072
02:08:06,510 --> 02:08:06,520
like here's what the lengths are and
 

7073
02:08:06,520 --> 02:08:07,669
like here's what the lengths are and
here's and here's what's hard here's

7074
02:08:07,669 --> 02:08:07,679
here's and here's what's hard here's
 

7075
02:08:07,679 --> 02:08:09,069
here's and here's what's hard here's
what easy and this is a reasonable

7076
02:08:09,069 --> 02:08:09,079
what easy and this is a reasonable
 

7077
02:08:09,079 --> 02:08:10,709
what easy and this is a reasonable
structure I think I'm pretty reasonable

7078
02:08:10,709 --> 02:08:10,719
structure I think I'm pretty reasonable
 

7079
02:08:10,719 --> 02:08:12,870
structure I think I'm pretty reasonable
here's like why you know why does the

7080
02:08:12,870 --> 02:08:12,880
here's like why you know why does the
 

7081
02:08:12,880 --> 02:08:14,950
here's like why you know why does the
word order look the way it does is we're

7082
02:08:14,950 --> 02:08:14,960
word order look the way it does is we're
 

7083
02:08:14,960 --> 02:08:16,709
word order look the way it does is we're
now into shaky territory but it's kind

7084
02:08:16,709 --> 02:08:16,719
now into shaky territory but it's kind
 

7085
02:08:16,719 --> 02:08:18,709
now into shaky territory but it's kind
of cool but we're talking about just to

7086
02:08:18,709 --> 02:08:18,719
of cool but we're talking about just to
 

7087
02:08:18,719 --> 02:08:20,830
of cool but we're talking about just to
be clear we're talking about maybe just

7088
02:08:20,830 --> 02:08:20,840
be clear we're talking about maybe just
 

7089
02:08:20,840 --> 02:08:22,830
be clear we're talking about maybe just
actually the sounds of communic like you

7090
02:08:22,830 --> 02:08:22,840
actually the sounds of communic like you
 

7091
02:08:22,840 --> 02:08:24,669
actually the sounds of communic like you
and I are sitting in the bar it's very

7092
02:08:24,669 --> 02:08:24,679
and I are sitting in the bar it's very
 

7093
02:08:24,679 --> 02:08:28,149
and I are sitting in the bar it's very
loud and you you uh model with a noisy

7094
02:08:28,149 --> 02:08:28,159
loud and you you uh model with a noisy
 

7095
02:08:28,159 --> 02:08:32,030
loud and you you uh model with a noisy
channel the loudness the noise and we

7096
02:08:32,030 --> 02:08:32,040
channel the loudness the noise and we
 

7097
02:08:32,040 --> 02:08:33,790
channel the loudness the noise and we
have the signal that's coming across

7098
02:08:33,790 --> 02:08:33,800
have the signal that's coming across
 

7099
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:35,750
have the signal that's coming across
that and you're saying word order might

7100
02:08:35,750 --> 02:08:35,760
that and you're saying word order might
 

7101
02:08:35,760 --> 02:08:38,109
that and you're saying word order might
have something to do with optimizing

7102
02:08:38,109 --> 02:08:38,119
have something to do with optimizing
 

7103
02:08:38,119 --> 02:08:40,149
have something to do with optimizing
that when there's a presence of noise

7104
02:08:40,149 --> 02:08:40,159
that when there's a presence of noise
 

7105
02:08:40,159 --> 02:08:41,910
that when there's a presence of noise
yes I it's really interesting I mean to

7106
02:08:41,910 --> 02:08:41,920
yes I it's really interesting I mean to
 

7107
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:43,189
yes I it's really interesting I mean to
me it's interesting how much you can

7108
02:08:43,189 --> 02:08:43,199
me it's interesting how much you can
 

7109
02:08:43,199 --> 02:08:44,830
me it's interesting how much you can
load into the noisy Channel like how

7110
02:08:44,830 --> 02:08:44,840
load into the noisy Channel like how
 

7111
02:08:44,840 --> 02:08:47,510
load into the noisy Channel like how
much can you bake in you said like you

7112
02:08:47,510 --> 02:08:47,520
much can you bake in you said like you
 

7113
02:08:47,520 --> 02:08:49,830
much can you bake in you said like you
know cognitive load on the receiver end

7114
02:08:49,830 --> 02:08:49,840
know cognitive load on the receiver end
 

7115
02:08:49,840 --> 02:08:51,750
know cognitive load on the receiver end
we think that those are there's three at

7116
02:08:51,750 --> 02:08:51,760
we think that those are there's three at
 

7117
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:53,510
we think that those are there's three at
least three different kinds of things

7118
02:08:53,510 --> 02:08:53,520
least three different kinds of things
 

7119
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:54,870
least three different kinds of things
going on there and we probably don't

7120
02:08:54,870 --> 02:08:54,880
going on there and we probably don't
 

7121
02:08:54,880 --> 02:08:56,870
going on there and we probably don't
want to treat them all as the same and

7122
02:08:56,870 --> 02:08:56,880
want to treat them all as the same and
 

7123
02:08:56,880 --> 02:08:58,870
want to treat them all as the same and
so I think you you know the right Model

7124
02:08:58,870 --> 02:08:58,880
so I think you you know the right Model
 

7125
02:08:58,880 --> 02:09:00,669
so I think you you know the right Model
A Better model of a noisy channel would

7126
02:09:00,669 --> 02:09:00,679
A Better model of a noisy channel would
 

7127
02:09:00,679 --> 02:09:02,350
A Better model of a noisy channel would
treat would have three different Source

7128
02:09:02,350 --> 02:09:02,360
treat would have three different Source
 

7129
02:09:02,360 --> 02:09:04,350
treat would have three different Source
sources of noise which because which are

7130
02:09:04,350 --> 02:09:04,360
sources of noise which because which are
 

7131
02:09:04,360 --> 02:09:06,430
sources of noise which because which are
background noise you know speaker

7132
02:09:06,430 --> 02:09:06,440
background noise you know speaker
 

7133
02:09:06,440 --> 02:09:09,109
background noise you know speaker
speaker um inherent noise and listener

7134
02:09:09,109 --> 02:09:09,119
speaker um inherent noise and listener
 

7135
02:09:09,119 --> 02:09:10,950
speaker um inherent noise and listener
inherent noise and those are not the

7136
02:09:10,950 --> 02:09:10,960
inherent noise and those are not the
 

7137
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:12,270
inherent noise and those are not the
those are all different things sure but

7138
02:09:12,270 --> 02:09:12,280
those are all different things sure but
 

7139
02:09:12,280 --> 02:09:14,229
those are all different things sure but
then underneath it there's a million

7140
02:09:14,229 --> 02:09:14,239
then underneath it there's a million
 

7141
02:09:14,239 --> 02:09:17,310
then underneath it there's a million
other subsets like what that's true on

7142
02:09:17,310 --> 02:09:17,320
other subsets like what that's true on
 

7143
02:09:17,320 --> 02:09:19,350
other subsets like what that's true on
on the receiving I mean I just mentioned

7144
02:09:19,350 --> 02:09:19,360
on the receiving I mean I just mentioned
 

7145
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:21,390
on the receiving I mean I just mentioned
cognitive load on both sides then

7146
02:09:21,390 --> 02:09:21,400
cognitive load on both sides then
 

7147
02:09:21,400 --> 02:09:23,669
cognitive load on both sides then
there's like uh speaking uh Speech

7148
02:09:23,669 --> 02:09:23,679
there's like uh speaking uh Speech
 

7149
02:09:23,679 --> 02:09:26,709
there's like uh speaking uh Speech
impediments or just everything uh world

7150
02:09:26,709 --> 02:09:26,719
impediments or just everything uh world
 

7151
02:09:26,719 --> 02:09:28,549
impediments or just everything uh world
view I mean the meaning will start to

7152
02:09:28,549 --> 02:09:28,559
view I mean the meaning will start to
 

7153
02:09:28,559 --> 02:09:30,629
view I mean the meaning will start to
creep into the meaning realm of like we

7154
02:09:30,629 --> 02:09:30,639
creep into the meaning realm of like we
 

7155
02:09:30,639 --> 02:09:32,229
creep into the meaning realm of like we
have different World Views well how

7156
02:09:32,229 --> 02:09:32,239
have different World Views well how
 

7157
02:09:32,239 --> 02:09:33,589
have different World Views well how
about just form still though like just

7158
02:09:33,589 --> 02:09:33,599
about just form still though like just
 

7159
02:09:33,599 --> 02:09:35,750
about just form still though like just
just what language you know like so how

7160
02:09:35,750 --> 02:09:35,760
just what language you know like so how
 

7161
02:09:35,760 --> 02:09:37,390
just what language you know like so how
well you know the language and so if

7162
02:09:37,390 --> 02:09:37,400
well you know the language and so if
 

7163
02:09:37,400 --> 02:09:39,189
well you know the language and so if
it's second language for you versus

7164
02:09:39,189 --> 02:09:39,199
it's second language for you versus
 

7165
02:09:39,199 --> 02:09:41,470
it's second language for you versus
first language and and how maybe what

7166
02:09:41,470 --> 02:09:41,480
first language and and how maybe what
 

7167
02:09:41,480 --> 02:09:43,030
first language and and how maybe what
other languages you know these are still

7168
02:09:43,030 --> 02:09:43,040
other languages you know these are still
 

7169
02:09:43,040 --> 02:09:45,310
other languages you know these are still
just form stuff and that's like

7170
02:09:45,310 --> 02:09:45,320
just form stuff and that's like
 

7171
02:09:45,320 --> 02:09:47,270
just form stuff and that's like
potentially very informative and and you

7172
02:09:47,270 --> 02:09:47,280
potentially very informative and and you
 

7173
02:09:47,280 --> 02:09:48,910
potentially very informative and and you
know how old you are these things

7174
02:09:48,910 --> 02:09:48,920
know how old you are these things
 

7175
02:09:48,920 --> 02:09:50,790
know how old you are these things
probably matter right so like a child

7176
02:09:50,790 --> 02:09:50,800
probably matter right so like a child
 

7177
02:09:50,800 --> 02:09:53,350
probably matter right so like a child
learning language is is a you know as a

7178
02:09:53,350 --> 02:09:53,360
learning language is is a you know as a
 

7179
02:09:53,360 --> 02:09:57,149
learning language is is a you know as a
noisy representation of English grammar

7180
02:09:57,149 --> 02:09:57,159
noisy representation of English grammar
 

7181
02:09:57,159 --> 02:09:58,430
noisy representation of English grammar
uh you know depending on how old they

7182
02:09:58,430 --> 02:09:58,440
uh you know depending on how old they
 

7183
02:09:58,440 --> 02:10:01,310
uh you know depending on how old they
are so maybe when they're six they're

7184
02:10:01,310 --> 02:10:01,320
are so maybe when they're six they're
 

7185
02:10:01,320 --> 02:10:03,669
are so maybe when they're six they're
perfectly formed but uh you mentioned

7186
02:10:03,669 --> 02:10:03,679
perfectly formed but uh you mentioned
 

7187
02:10:03,679 --> 02:10:04,990
perfectly formed but uh you mentioned
one of the things is like a way to

7188
02:10:04,990 --> 02:10:05,000
one of the things is like a way to
 

7189
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,990
one of the things is like a way to
measure the the a language is learning

7190
02:10:07,990 --> 02:10:08,000
measure the the a language is learning
 

7191
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:11,229
measure the the a language is learning
problems so like what's the correlation

7192
02:10:11,229 --> 02:10:11,239
problems so like what's the correlation
 

7193
02:10:11,239 --> 02:10:12,390
problems so like what's the correlation
between everything we've been talking

7194
02:10:12,390 --> 02:10:12,400
between everything we've been talking
 

7195
02:10:12,400 --> 02:10:13,790
between everything we've been talking
about and how easy it is to learn a

7196
02:10:13,790 --> 02:10:13,800
about and how easy it is to learn a
 

7197
02:10:13,800 --> 02:10:18,870
about and how easy it is to learn a
language so is is uh like a short

7198
02:10:18,870 --> 02:10:18,880
language so is is uh like a short
 

7199
02:10:18,880 --> 02:10:20,990
language so is is uh like a short

dependencies correlated to ability to
 

7201
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,549
dependencies correlated to ability to
learn language is there some kind of or

7202
02:10:23,549 --> 02:10:23,559
learn language is there some kind of or
 

7203
02:10:23,559 --> 02:10:25,950
learn language is there some kind of or
like the dependency grammar is there

7204
02:10:25,950 --> 02:10:25,960
like the dependency grammar is there
 

7205
02:10:25,960 --> 02:10:29,549
like the dependency grammar is there
some kind of connection there how easy

7206
02:10:29,549 --> 02:10:29,559
some kind of connection there how easy
 

7207
02:10:29,559 --> 02:10:31,189
some kind of connection there how easy
it is to learn yeah well all the

7208
02:10:31,189 --> 02:10:31,199
it is to learn yeah well all the
 

7209
02:10:31,199 --> 02:10:33,470
it is to learn yeah well all the

02:10:37,709 --> 02:10:37,719
any other with respect to sort of
 

7215
02:10:37,719 --> 02:10:39,310
any other with respect to sort of
optimizing dependency lengths for

7216
02:10:39,310 --> 02:10:39,320
optimizing dependency lengths for
 

7217
02:10:39,320 --> 02:10:41,030
optimizing dependency lengths for
example they're all kind of do it do it

7218
02:10:41,030 --> 02:10:41,040
example they're all kind of do it do it
 

7219
02:10:41,040 --> 02:10:43,990
example they're all kind of do it do it
well they all keep low it's so I I think

7220
02:10:43,990 --> 02:10:44,000
well they all keep low it's so I I think
 

7221
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:45,990
well they all keep low it's so I I think
of every human language is some kind of

7222
02:10:45,990 --> 02:10:46,000
of every human language is some kind of
 

7223
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,910
of every human language is some kind of
an opt sort of an optimization problem a

7224
02:10:48,910 --> 02:10:48,920
an opt sort of an optimization problem a
 

7225
02:10:48,920 --> 02:10:50,910
an opt sort of an optimization problem a
complex optimization problem to this

7226
02:10:50,910 --> 02:10:50,920
complex optimization problem to this
 

7227
02:10:50,920 --> 02:10:53,270
complex optimization problem to this
communic ation problem and so they' like

7228
02:10:53,270 --> 02:10:53,280
communic ation problem and so they' like
 

7229
02:10:53,280 --> 02:10:54,510
communic ation problem and so they' like
they've solved it and you know they're

7230
02:10:54,510 --> 02:10:54,520
they've solved it and you know they're
 

7231
02:10:54,520 --> 02:10:56,750
they've solved it and you know they're
just sort of noisy solutions to this

7232
02:10:56,750 --> 02:10:56,760
just sort of noisy solutions to this
 

7233
02:10:56,760 --> 02:10:58,589
just sort of noisy solutions to this
problem of communication there's just so

7234
02:10:58,589 --> 02:10:58,599
problem of communication there's just so
 

7235
02:10:58,599 --> 02:11:00,750
problem of communication there's just so
many ways you can do this so they're not

7236
02:11:00,750 --> 02:11:00,760
many ways you can do this so they're not
 

7237
02:11:00,760 --> 02:11:02,430
many ways you can do this so they're not
optimized for learning they're probably

7238
02:11:02,430 --> 02:11:02,440
optimized for learning they're probably
 

7239
02:11:02,440 --> 02:11:05,709
optimized for learning they're probably
optimized forun and and learning so yes

7240
02:11:05,709 --> 02:11:05,719
optimized forun and and learning so yes
 

7241
02:11:05,719 --> 02:11:07,589
optimized forun and and learning so yes
one of the factors which yeah so

7242
02:11:07,589 --> 02:11:07,599
one of the factors which yeah so
 

7243
02:11:07,599 --> 02:11:10,109
one of the factors which yeah so
learning is messing this up a bit and so

7244
02:11:10,109 --> 02:11:10,119
learning is messing this up a bit and so
 

7245
02:11:10,119 --> 02:11:12,790
learning is messing this up a bit and so
so for example if it were just about

7246
02:11:12,790 --> 02:11:12,800
so for example if it were just about
 

7247
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:14,709
so for example if it were just about
minimizing dependency lengths and and

7248
02:11:14,709 --> 02:11:14,719
minimizing dependency lengths and and
 

7249
02:11:14,719 --> 02:11:16,589
minimizing dependency lengths and and
that was all that matters you know then

7250
02:11:16,589 --> 02:11:16,599
that was all that matters you know then
 

7251
02:11:16,599 --> 02:11:19,270
that was all that matters you know then
we you know so then then we might find

7252
02:11:19,270 --> 02:11:19,280
we you know so then then we might find
 

7253
02:11:19,280 --> 02:11:21,669
we you know so then then we might find
grammars which didn't have regularity in

7254
02:11:21,669 --> 02:11:21,679
grammars which didn't have regularity in
 

7255
02:11:21,679 --> 02:11:24,430
grammars which didn't have regularity in
their rules like but languages always

7256
02:11:24,430 --> 02:11:24,440
their rules like but languages always
 

7257
02:11:24,440 --> 02:11:26,109
their rules like but languages always
have regularity in their rules so so

7258
02:11:26,109 --> 02:11:26,119
have regularity in their rules so so
 

7259
02:11:26,119 --> 02:11:28,030
have regularity in their rules so so
what I mean by that is that if if I

7260
02:11:28,030 --> 02:11:28,040
what I mean by that is that if if I
 

7261
02:11:28,040 --> 02:11:29,629
what I mean by that is that if if I
wanted to say something to you and the

7262
02:11:29,629 --> 02:11:29,639
wanted to say something to you and the
 

7263
02:11:29,639 --> 02:11:31,750
wanted to say something to you and the
in the optimal way to say it was what

7264
02:11:31,750 --> 02:11:31,760
in the optimal way to say it was what
 

7265
02:11:31,760 --> 02:11:33,229
in the optimal way to say it was what
really mattered to me all that mattered

7266
02:11:33,229 --> 02:11:33,239
really mattered to me all that mattered
 

7267
02:11:33,239 --> 02:11:34,390
really mattered to me all that mattered
was keeping the

7268
02:11:34,390 --> 02:11:34,400
was keeping the
 

7269
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:36,310
was keeping the
dependencies as close together as

7270
02:11:36,310 --> 02:11:36,320
dependencies as close together as
 

7271
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:37,950
dependencies as close together as
possible Then I then I would have a very

7272
02:11:37,950 --> 02:11:37,960
possible Then I then I would have a very
 

7273
02:11:37,960 --> 02:11:40,030
possible Then I then I would have a very
lack set of phrase structure rule or or

7274
02:11:40,030 --> 02:11:40,040
lack set of phrase structure rule or or
 

7275
02:11:40,040 --> 02:11:41,470
lack set of phrase structure rule or or
dependency rules I wouldn't have very

7276
02:11:41,470 --> 02:11:41,480
dependency rules I wouldn't have very
 

7277
02:11:41,480 --> 02:11:42,870
dependency rules I wouldn't have very
many of those I would have very little

7278
02:11:42,870 --> 02:11:42,880
many of those I would have very little
 

7279
02:11:42,880 --> 02:11:44,990
many of those I would have very little
of that and I would just put the words

7280
02:11:44,990 --> 02:11:45,000
of that and I would just put the words
 

7281
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:46,870
of that and I would just put the words
as close the things that refer to the

7282
02:11:46,870 --> 02:11:46,880
as close the things that refer to the
 

7283
02:11:46,880 --> 02:11:48,629
as close the things that refer to the
things that are connected right beside

7284
02:11:48,629 --> 02:11:48,639
things that are connected right beside
 

7285
02:11:48,639 --> 02:11:50,390
things that are connected right beside
each other but we don't do that like

7286
02:11:50,390 --> 02:11:50,400
each other but we don't do that like
 

7287
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:52,510
each other but we don't do that like
there like there are word order rules

7288
02:11:52,510 --> 02:11:52,520
there like there are word order rules
 

7289
02:11:52,520 --> 02:11:54,030
there like there are word order rules
right so they're very and depending on

7290
02:11:54,030 --> 02:11:54,040
right so they're very and depending on
 

7291
02:11:54,040 --> 02:11:55,549
right so they're very and depending on
the language they're more and less

7292
02:11:55,549 --> 02:11:55,559
the language they're more and less
 

7293
02:11:55,559 --> 02:11:57,310
the language they're more and less
strict right so you speak Russian

7294
02:11:57,310 --> 02:11:57,320
strict right so you speak Russian
 

7295
02:11:57,320 --> 02:11:58,910
strict right so you speak Russian
they're less strict than English English

7296
02:11:58,910 --> 02:11:58,920
they're less strict than English English
 

7297
02:11:58,920 --> 02:12:01,350
they're less strict than English English
is very rigid word order rules we order

7298
02:12:01,350 --> 02:12:01,360
is very rigid word order rules we order
 

7299
02:12:01,360 --> 02:12:03,669
is very rigid word order rules we order
things in a very particular way and and

7300
02:12:03,669 --> 02:12:03,679
things in a very particular way and and
 

7301
02:12:03,679 --> 02:12:06,350
things in a very particular way and and
so why do we do that like that's

7302
02:12:06,350 --> 02:12:06,360
so why do we do that like that's
 

7303
02:12:06,360 --> 02:12:08,910
so why do we do that like that's
probably not about um communication

7304
02:12:08,910 --> 02:12:08,920
probably not about um communication
 

7305
02:12:08,920 --> 02:12:10,390
probably not about um communication
that's probably about learning I mean

7306
02:12:10,390 --> 02:12:10,400
that's probably about learning I mean
 

7307
02:12:10,400 --> 02:12:11,310
that's probably about learning I mean
then we're talking about learning it's

7308
02:12:11,310 --> 02:12:11,320
then we're talking about learning it's
 

7309
02:12:11,320 --> 02:12:13,790
then we're talking about learning it's
like probably easier to learn regular

7310
02:12:13,790 --> 02:12:13,800
like probably easier to learn regular
 

7311
02:12:13,800 --> 02:12:15,430
like probably easier to learn regular
regular things things which are very

7312
02:12:15,430 --> 02:12:15,440
regular things things which are very
 

7313
02:12:15,440 --> 02:12:17,589
regular things things which are very
predictable and easy to so so that's

7314
02:12:17,589 --> 02:12:17,599
predictable and easy to so so that's
 

7315
02:12:17,599 --> 02:12:19,109
predictable and easy to so so that's
that's probably about learning as my is

7316
02:12:19,109 --> 02:12:19,119
that's probably about learning as my is
 

7317
02:12:19,119 --> 02:12:20,589
that's probably about learning as my is
our guest because that can't be about

7318
02:12:20,589 --> 02:12:20,599
our guest because that can't be about
 

7319
02:12:20,599 --> 02:12:23,270
our guest because that can't be about
communication just noise can it be just

7320
02:12:23,270 --> 02:12:23,280
communication just noise can it be just
 

7321
02:12:23,280 --> 02:12:25,669
communication just noise can it be just
the the messiness of the development of

7322
02:12:25,669 --> 02:12:25,679
the the messiness of the development of
 

7323
02:12:25,679 --> 02:12:27,189
the the messiness of the development of
a language well if it were just a

7324
02:12:27,189 --> 02:12:27,199
a language well if it were just a
 

7325
02:12:27,199 --> 02:12:28,709
a language well if it were just a
communication then we we should have

7326
02:12:28,709 --> 02:12:28,719
communication then we we should have
 

7327
02:12:28,719 --> 02:12:30,830
communication then we we should have
languages which have very very free word

7328
02:12:30,830 --> 02:12:30,840
languages which have very very free word
 

7329
02:12:30,840 --> 02:12:32,270
languages which have very very free word
order and we don't have that we have

7330
02:12:32,270 --> 02:12:32,280
order and we don't have that we have
 

7331
02:12:32,280 --> 02:12:36,149
order and we don't have that we have
free ER but not free like there's always

7332
02:12:36,149 --> 02:12:36,159
free ER but not free like there's always
 

7333
02:12:36,159 --> 02:12:38,470
free ER but not free like there's always
well no but what I mean by noise is like

7334
02:12:38,470 --> 02:12:38,480
well no but what I mean by noise is like
 

7335
02:12:38,480 --> 02:12:40,709
well no but what I mean by noise is like
cultural like sticky cultural things

7336
02:12:40,709 --> 02:12:40,719
cultural like sticky cultural things
 

7337
02:12:40,719 --> 02:12:42,870
cultural like sticky cultural things
like the way the way you communicate

7338
02:12:42,870 --> 02:12:42,880
like the way the way you communicate
 

7339
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:44,870
like the way the way you communicate
just there there's a stickiness to it

7340
02:12:44,870 --> 02:12:44,880
just there there's a stickiness to it
 

7341
02:12:44,880 --> 02:12:48,189
just there there's a stickiness to it
that it's it's an imperfect it's a noisy

7342
02:12:48,189 --> 02:12:48,199
that it's it's an imperfect it's a noisy
 

7343
02:12:48,199 --> 02:12:49,229
that it's it's an imperfect it's a noisy
op it's

7344
02:12:49,229 --> 02:12:49,239
op it's
 

7345
02:12:49,239 --> 02:12:51,669
op it's
stochastic yeah the the function over

7346
02:12:51,669 --> 02:12:51,679
stochastic yeah the the function over
 

7347
02:12:51,679 --> 02:12:53,430
stochastic yeah the the function over
which you're optimizing is very noisy

7348
02:12:53,430 --> 02:12:53,440
which you're optimizing is very noisy
 

7349
02:12:53,440 --> 02:12:57,030
which you're optimizing is very noisy
yeah so uh because I don't it feels

7350
02:12:57,030 --> 02:12:57,040
yeah so uh because I don't it feels
 

7351
02:12:57,040 --> 02:12:58,950
yeah so uh because I don't it feels
weird to say that learning is part of

7352
02:12:58,950 --> 02:12:58,960
weird to say that learning is part of
 

7353
02:12:58,960 --> 02:13:01,189
weird to say that learning is part of
the objective function CU some languages

7354
02:13:01,189 --> 02:13:01,199
the objective function CU some languages
 

7355
02:13:01,199 --> 02:13:03,470
the objective function CU some languages
are way harder to learn than others

7356
02:13:03,470 --> 02:13:03,480
are way harder to learn than others
 

7357
02:13:03,480 --> 02:13:06,350
are way harder to learn than others
right or is that that's not true that's

7358
02:13:06,350 --> 02:13:06,360
right or is that that's not true that's
 

7359
02:13:06,360 --> 02:13:07,910
right or is that that's not true that's
interesting I mean that's the public

7360
02:13:07,910 --> 02:13:07,920
interesting I mean that's the public
 

7361
02:13:07,920 --> 02:13:10,510
interesting I mean that's the public
sort of perception right yes that's true

7362
02:13:10,510 --> 02:13:10,520
sort of perception right yes that's true
 

7363
02:13:10,520 --> 02:13:12,470
sort of perception right yes that's true
for a second language for second

7364
02:13:12,470 --> 02:13:12,480
for a second language for second
 

7365
02:13:12,480 --> 02:13:13,830
for a second language for second
language but that depends on what you

7366
02:13:13,830 --> 02:13:13,840
language but that depends on what you
 

7367
02:13:13,840 --> 02:13:16,189
language but that depends on what you
started with right so so it's it really

7368
02:13:16,189 --> 02:13:16,199
started with right so so it's it really
 

7369
02:13:16,199 --> 02:13:17,549
started with right so so it's it really
depends on how close that second

7370
02:13:17,549 --> 02:13:17,559
depends on how close that second
 

7371
02:13:17,559 --> 02:13:19,030
depends on how close that second
language is to the first language you've

7372
02:13:19,030 --> 02:13:19,040
language is to the first language you've
 

7373
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:21,709
language is to the first language you've
got and so yes it's very very hard to

7374
02:13:21,709 --> 02:13:21,719
got and so yes it's very very hard to
 

7375
02:13:21,719 --> 02:13:23,950
got and so yes it's very very hard to
learn Arabic if you started with English

7376
02:13:23,950 --> 02:13:23,960
learn Arabic if you started with English
 

7377
02:13:23,960 --> 02:13:25,750
learn Arabic if you started with English
or it's hard to you hard to learn

7378
02:13:25,750 --> 02:13:25,760
or it's hard to you hard to learn
 

7379
02:13:25,760 --> 02:13:28,390
or it's hard to you hard to learn
Japanese or if you started with Chinese

7380
02:13:28,390 --> 02:13:28,400
Japanese or if you started with Chinese
 

7381
02:13:28,400 --> 02:13:30,350
Japanese or if you started with Chinese
I think is the worst in the there's like

7382
02:13:30,350 --> 02:13:30,360
I think is the worst in the there's like
 

7383
02:13:30,360 --> 02:13:32,310
I think is the worst in the there's like

Defense Language Institute in the in the
 

7385
02:13:32,320 --> 02:13:35,629
Defense Language Institute in the in the
United States has like a a list of of

7386
02:13:35,629 --> 02:13:35,639
United States has like a a list of of
 

7387
02:13:35,639 --> 02:13:37,310
United States has like a a list of of
how hard it is to learn what language

7388
02:13:37,310 --> 02:13:37,320
how hard it is to learn what language
 

7389
02:13:37,320 --> 02:13:39,069
how hard it is to learn what language
from English I think Chinese is the this

7390
02:13:39,069 --> 02:13:39,079
from English I think Chinese is the this
 

7391
02:13:39,079 --> 02:13:41,109
from English I think Chinese is the this
is a second Lang you're saying babies

7392
02:13:41,109 --> 02:13:41,119
is a second Lang you're saying babies
 

7393
02:13:41,119 --> 02:13:43,669
is a second Lang you're saying babies
don't care no there's no evidence that

7394
02:13:43,669 --> 02:13:43,679
don't care no there's no evidence that
 

7395
02:13:43,679 --> 02:13:45,189
don't care no there's no evidence that
there's anything harder or easier about

7396
02:13:45,189 --> 02:13:45,199
there's anything harder or easier about
 

7397
02:13:45,199 --> 02:13:47,549
there's anything harder or easier about
any baby any language learned like it's

7398
02:13:47,549 --> 02:13:47,559
any baby any language learned like it's
 

7399
02:13:47,559 --> 02:13:49,030
any baby any language learned like it's
by three or four they speak that

7400
02:13:49,030 --> 02:13:49,040
by three or four they speak that
 

7401
02:13:49,040 --> 02:13:50,629
by three or four they speak that
language and so there's no evidence of

7402
02:13:50,629 --> 02:13:50,639
language and so there's no evidence of
 

7403
02:13:50,639 --> 02:13:52,709
language and so there's no evidence of
any anything harder or easier about any

7404
02:13:52,709 --> 02:13:52,719
any anything harder or easier about any
 

7405
02:13:52,719 --> 02:13:54,390
any anything harder or easier about any
human language they're all kind of equal

7406
02:13:54,390 --> 02:13:54,400
human language they're all kind of equal
 

7407
02:13:54,400 --> 02:13:57,390
human language they're all kind of equal
so to what degree is language this is

7408
02:13:57,390 --> 02:13:57,400
so to what degree is language this is
 

7409
02:13:57,400 --> 02:14:00,589
so to what degree is language this is
returning to Chomsky a little bit is is

7410
02:14:00,589 --> 02:14:00,599
returning to Chomsky a little bit is is
 

7411
02:14:00,599 --> 02:14:03,910
returning to Chomsky a little bit is is
innate you said that for chamski he used

7412
02:14:03,910 --> 02:14:03,920
innate you said that for chamski he used
 

7413
02:14:03,920 --> 02:14:05,830
innate you said that for chamski he used
the idea that language is some aspects

7414
02:14:05,830 --> 02:14:05,840
the idea that language is some aspects
 

7415
02:14:05,840 --> 02:14:07,430
the idea that language is some aspects
of language are innate to explain away

02:14:11,350 --> 02:14:11,360
how much are we

how much are we

7425
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,350
mind
brain I mean I I you know the answer is

7426
02:14:18,350 --> 02:14:18,360
brain I mean I I you know the answer is
 

7427
02:14:18,360 --> 02:14:21,470
brain I mean I I you know the answer is
I don't know of course but uh the uh I

7428
02:14:21,470 --> 02:14:21,480
I don't know of course but uh the uh I
 

7429
02:14:21,480 --> 02:14:23,950
I don't know of course but uh the uh I
mean I I like to I'm an engineer at

7430
02:14:23,950 --> 02:14:23,960
mean I I like to I'm an engineer at
 

7431
02:14:23,960 --> 02:14:26,350
mean I I like to I'm an engineer at
heart I guess and I sort of think it's

7432
02:14:26,350 --> 02:14:26,360
heart I guess and I sort of think it's
 

7433
02:14:26,360 --> 02:14:28,310
heart I guess and I sort of think it's
fine to postulate that a lot of it's

7434
02:14:28,310 --> 02:14:28,320
fine to postulate that a lot of it's
 

7435
02:14:28,320 --> 02:14:30,310
fine to postulate that a lot of it's
learned and so I I'm guessing that a lot

7436
02:14:30,310 --> 02:14:30,320
learned and so I I'm guessing that a lot
 

7437
02:14:30,320 --> 02:14:32,589
learned and so I I'm guessing that a lot
of it's learned so I think the reason

7438
02:14:32,589 --> 02:14:32,599
of it's learned so I think the reason
 

7439
02:14:32,599 --> 02:14:34,870
of it's learned so I think the reason
Chomsky went with

7440
02:14:34,870 --> 02:14:34,880
Chomsky went with
 

7441
02:14:34,880 --> 02:14:38,189
Chomsky went with
innateness is because he he he

7442
02:14:38,189 --> 02:14:38,199
innateness is because he he he
 

7443
02:14:38,199 --> 02:14:40,350
innateness is because he he he
hypothesized movement in his grammar he

7444
02:14:40,350 --> 02:14:40,360
hypothesized movement in his grammar he
 

7445
02:14:40,360 --> 02:14:41,990
hypothesized movement in his grammar he
was interested in grammar and movement's

7446
02:14:41,990 --> 02:14:42,000
was interested in grammar and movement's
 

7447
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:43,470
was interested in grammar and movement's
hard to learn I think he's right

7448
02:14:43,470 --> 02:14:43,480
hard to learn I think he's right
 

7449
02:14:43,480 --> 02:14:45,229
hard to learn I think he's right
movement is a hard it's a hard thing to

7450
02:14:45,229 --> 02:14:45,239
movement is a hard it's a hard thing to
 

7451
02:14:45,239 --> 02:14:46,629
movement is a hard it's a hard thing to
learn to learn these two things together

7452
02:14:46,629 --> 02:14:46,639
learn to learn these two things together
 

7453
02:14:46,639 --> 02:14:48,510
learn to learn these two things together
and how they interact and there's like a

7454
02:14:48,510 --> 02:14:48,520
and how they interact and there's like a
 

7455
02:14:48,520 --> 02:14:50,310
and how they interact and there's like a
lot of ways in which you might generate

7456
02:14:50,310 --> 02:14:50,320
lot of ways in which you might generate
 

7457
02:14:50,320 --> 02:14:51,910
lot of ways in which you might generate
exactly the same sentences and it's like

7458
02:14:51,910 --> 02:14:51,920
exactly the same sentences and it's like
 

7459
02:14:51,920 --> 02:14:54,069
exactly the same sentences and it's like
really hard and so he's like oh I guess

7460
02:14:54,069 --> 02:14:54,079
really hard and so he's like oh I guess
 

7461
02:14:54,079 --> 02:14:55,709
really hard and so he's like oh I guess
it's learned sorry I guess it's not

7462
02:14:55,709 --> 02:14:55,719
it's learned sorry I guess it's not
 

7463
02:14:55,719 --> 02:14:58,069
it's learned sorry I guess it's not
learned it's a eight and um if you just

7464
02:14:58,069 --> 02:14:58,079
learned it's a eight and um if you just
 

7465
02:14:58,079 --> 02:14:59,629
learned it's a eight and um if you just
throw out the movement and just think

7466
02:14:59,629 --> 02:14:59,639
throw out the movement and just think
 

7467
02:14:59,639 --> 02:15:01,189
throw out the movement and just think
about that in a different

7468
02:15:01,189 --> 02:15:01,199
about that in a different
 

7469
02:15:01,199 --> 02:15:03,990
about that in a different
way you know then you you get some

7470
02:15:03,990 --> 02:15:04,000
way you know then you you get some
 

7471
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,709
way you know then you you get some
messiness but the messiness is human

7472
02:15:06,709 --> 02:15:06,719
messiness but the messiness is human
 

7473
02:15:06,719 --> 02:15:08,549
messiness but the messiness is human
language which it it actually fits

7474
02:15:08,549 --> 02:15:08,559
language which it it actually fits
 

7475
02:15:08,559 --> 02:15:10,750
language which it it actually fits
better it's that messiness isn't a

7476
02:15:10,750 --> 02:15:10,760
better it's that messiness isn't a
 

7477
02:15:10,760 --> 02:15:14,350
better it's that messiness isn't a
problem it's actually a a a a a it's a

7478
02:15:14,350 --> 02:15:14,360
problem it's actually a a a a a it's a
 

7479
02:15:14,360 --> 02:15:17,910
problem it's actually a a a a a it's a
valuable asset of of uh of the theory

7480
02:15:17,910 --> 02:15:17,920
valuable asset of of uh of the theory
 

7481
02:15:17,920 --> 02:15:20,589
valuable asset of of uh of the theory
and so so I think I don't really see a

7482
02:15:20,589 --> 02:15:20,599
and so so I think I don't really see a
 

7483
02:15:20,599 --> 02:15:21,830
and so so I think I don't really see a
reason

7484
02:15:21,830 --> 02:15:21,840
reason
 

7485
02:15:21,840 --> 02:15:23,750
reason
to postulate much much innate structure

7486
02:15:23,750 --> 02:15:23,760
to postulate much much innate structure
 

7487
02:15:23,760 --> 02:15:24,830
to postulate much much innate structure
and that's kind of why I think these

7488
02:15:24,830 --> 02:15:24,840
and that's kind of why I think these
 

7489
02:15:24,840 --> 02:15:26,310
and that's kind of why I think these
large language models are learning so

7490
02:15:26,310 --> 02:15:26,320
large language models are learning so
 

7491
02:15:26,320 --> 02:15:28,589
large language models are learning so
well is because I think you can learn

7492
02:15:28,589 --> 02:15:28,599
well is because I think you can learn
 

7493
02:15:28,599 --> 02:15:30,870
well is because I think you can learn
the form the forms of human language

7494
02:15:30,870 --> 02:15:30,880
the form the forms of human language
 

7495
02:15:30,880 --> 02:15:33,350
the form the forms of human language
from the input I think that's like it's

7496
02:15:33,350 --> 02:15:33,360
from the input I think that's like it's
 

7497
02:15:33,360 --> 02:15:35,149
from the input I think that's like it's
likely to be true so that part of the

7498
02:15:35,149 --> 02:15:35,159
likely to be true so that part of the
 

7499
02:15:35,159 --> 02:15:36,310
likely to be true so that part of the
brain that lights up when you're doing

7500
02:15:36,310 --> 02:15:36,320
brain that lights up when you're doing
 

7501
02:15:36,320 --> 02:15:37,629
brain that lights up when you're doing
all the comprehension that could be

7502
02:15:37,629 --> 02:15:37,639
all the comprehension that could be
 

7503
02:15:37,639 --> 02:15:39,350
all the comprehension that could be
learned that could be just you don't

7504
02:15:39,350 --> 02:15:39,360
learned that could be just you don't
 

7505
02:15:39,360 --> 02:15:40,790
learned that could be just you don't
need you don't need doesn't have to be

7506
02:15:40,790 --> 02:15:40,800
need you don't need doesn't have to be
 

7507
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:43,990
need you don't need doesn't have to be
an eight so like lots of stuff is um

7508
02:15:43,990 --> 02:15:44,000
an eight so like lots of stuff is um
 

7509
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,870
an eight so like lots of stuff is um
modular in the brain that's learned it

7510
02:15:46,870 --> 02:15:46,880
modular in the brain that's learned it
 

7511
02:15:46,880 --> 02:15:49,109
modular in the brain that's learned it
doesn't have to you know so there's

7512
02:15:49,109 --> 02:15:49,119
doesn't have to you know so there's
 

7513
02:15:49,119 --> 02:15:50,669
doesn't have to you know so there's
something called the visual word form

7514
02:15:50,669 --> 02:15:50,679
something called the visual word form
 

7515
02:15:50,679 --> 02:15:52,390
something called the visual word form
era in the back and so it's in the back

7516
02:15:52,390 --> 02:15:52,400
era in the back and so it's in the back
 

7517
02:15:52,400 --> 02:15:54,629
era in the back and so it's in the back
of your head near the you know the

7518
02:15:54,629 --> 02:15:54,639
of your head near the you know the
 

7519
02:15:54,639 --> 02:15:58,149
of your head near the you know the
visual cortex okay and that is very

7520
02:15:58,149 --> 02:15:58,159
visual cortex okay and that is very
 

7521
02:15:58,159 --> 02:16:00,229
visual cortex okay and that is very
specialized language sorry very

7522
02:16:00,229 --> 02:16:00,239
specialized language sorry very
 

7523
02:16:00,239 --> 02:16:02,629
specialized language sorry very
specialized brain area which

7524
02:16:02,629 --> 02:16:02,639
specialized brain area which
 

7525
02:16:02,639 --> 02:16:05,390
specialized brain area which
does um visual word processing if you

7526
02:16:05,390 --> 02:16:05,400
does um visual word processing if you
 

7527
02:16:05,400 --> 02:16:06,950
does um visual word processing if you
read if you're a reader okay if you

7528
02:16:06,950 --> 02:16:06,960
read if you're a reader okay if you
 

7529
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:08,870
read if you're a reader okay if you
don't read you don't have it okay guess

7530
02:16:08,870 --> 02:16:08,880
don't read you don't have it okay guess
 

7531
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:10,310
don't read you don't have it okay guess
what you spend some time learning to

7532
02:16:10,310 --> 02:16:10,320
what you spend some time learning to
 

7533
02:16:10,320 --> 02:16:12,270
what you spend some time learning to
read and you develop that that brain

7534
02:16:12,270 --> 02:16:12,280
read and you develop that that brain
 

7535
02:16:12,280 --> 02:16:14,149
read and you develop that that brain
area which does exactly that and so

7536
02:16:14,149 --> 02:16:14,159
area which does exactly that and so
 

7537
02:16:14,159 --> 02:16:16,030
area which does exactly that and so
these the modularization does not

7538
02:16:16,030 --> 02:16:16,040
these the modularization does not
 

7539
02:16:16,040 --> 02:16:17,830
these the modularization does not
evidence for innateness so the

7540
02:16:17,830 --> 02:16:17,840
evidence for innateness so the
 

7541
02:16:17,840 --> 02:16:19,470
evidence for innateness so the
modularization of a language area

7542
02:16:19,470 --> 02:16:19,480
modularization of a language area
 

7543
02:16:19,480 --> 02:16:21,470
modularization of a language area
doesn't mean we're born with it it we

7544
02:16:21,470 --> 02:16:21,480
doesn't mean we're born with it it we
 

7545
02:16:21,480 --> 02:16:24,149
doesn't mean we're born with it it we
could have easily learned that I I we

7546
02:16:24,149 --> 02:16:24,159
could have easily learned that I I we
 

7547
02:16:24,159 --> 02:16:26,069
could have easily learned that I I we
might have been born with it I I we we

7548
02:16:26,069 --> 02:16:26,079
might have been born with it I I we we
 

7549
02:16:26,079 --> 02:16:27,669
might have been born with it I I we we
just don't know at this point we might

7550
02:16:27,669 --> 02:16:27,679
just don't know at this point we might
 

7551
02:16:27,679 --> 02:16:29,990
just don't know at this point we might
very well have been born with this left

7552
02:16:29,990 --> 02:16:30,000
very well have been born with this left
 

7553
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:31,629
very well have been born with this left
lateralized area I mean that there's

7554
02:16:31,629 --> 02:16:31,639
lateralized area I mean that there's
 

7555
02:16:31,639 --> 02:16:33,389
lateralized area I mean that there's
like a lot of other interesting

7556
02:16:33,389 --> 02:16:33,399
like a lot of other interesting
 

7557
02:16:33,399 --> 02:16:35,830
like a lot of other interesting
components here features of this kind of

7558
02:16:35,830 --> 02:16:35,840
components here features of this kind of
 

7559
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:39,349
components here features of this kind of
argument so some people get a stroke or

7560
02:16:39,349 --> 02:16:39,359
argument so some people get a stroke or
 

7561
02:16:39,359 --> 02:16:41,150
argument so some people get a stroke or
something goes really wrong on the left

7562
02:16:41,150 --> 02:16:41,160
something goes really wrong on the left
 

7563
02:16:41,160 --> 02:16:42,669
something goes really wrong on the left
side where the left where the language

7564
02:16:42,669 --> 02:16:42,679
side where the left where the language
 

7565
02:16:42,679 --> 02:16:45,469
side where the left where the language
area would be and that and that isn't

7566
02:16:45,469 --> 02:16:45,479
area would be and that and that isn't
 

7567
02:16:45,479 --> 02:16:46,910
area would be and that and that isn't
there it's not not available and it

7568
02:16:46,910 --> 02:16:46,920
there it's not not available and it
 

7569
02:16:46,920 --> 02:16:48,469
there it's not not available and it
develops just fine in the right so it's

7570
02:16:48,469 --> 02:16:48,479
develops just fine in the right so it's
 

7571
02:16:48,479 --> 02:16:51,309
develops just fine in the right so it's
no long so it's not about the left it

7572
02:16:51,309 --> 02:16:51,319
no long so it's not about the left it
 

7573
02:16:51,319 --> 02:16:53,150
no long so it's not about the left it
goes to the left like this is a very

7574
02:16:53,150 --> 02:16:53,160
goes to the left like this is a very
 

7575
02:16:53,160 --> 02:16:54,750
goes to the left like this is a very
interesting question it's like

7576
02:16:54,750 --> 02:16:54,760
interesting question it's like
 

7577
02:16:54,760 --> 02:16:57,389
interesting question it's like
why is the why are any of the brain

7578
02:16:57,389 --> 02:16:57,399
why is the why are any of the brain
 

7579
02:16:57,399 --> 02:16:59,389
why is the why are any of the brain
areas the way that they are and how how

7580
02:16:59,389 --> 02:16:59,399
areas the way that they are and how how
 

7581
02:16:59,399 --> 02:17:01,950
areas the way that they are and how how
how did they come to be that way and uh

7582
02:17:01,950 --> 02:17:01,960
how did they come to be that way and uh
 

7583
02:17:01,960 --> 02:17:03,309
how did they come to be that way and uh
you know there's these natural

7584
02:17:03,309 --> 02:17:03,319
you know there's these natural
 

7585
02:17:03,319 --> 02:17:04,870
you know there's these natural
experiments which happen where people

7586
02:17:04,870 --> 02:17:04,880
experiments which happen where people
 

7587
02:17:04,880 --> 02:17:06,990
experiments which happen where people
get these you know strange events in

7588
02:17:06,990 --> 02:17:07,000
get these you know strange events in
 

7589
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,270
get these you know strange events in
their brains at very young Ages which

7590
02:17:09,270 --> 02:17:09,280
their brains at very young Ages which
 

7591
02:17:09,280 --> 02:17:12,030
their brains at very young Ages which
wipe out sections of their brain and and

7592
02:17:12,030 --> 02:17:12,040
wipe out sections of their brain and and
 

7593
02:17:12,040 --> 02:17:13,870
wipe out sections of their brain and and
they behave totally normally and no one

7594
02:17:13,870 --> 02:17:13,880
they behave totally normally and no one
 

7595
02:17:13,880 --> 02:17:15,469
they behave totally normally and no one
knows anything was wrong and we find out

7596
02:17:15,469 --> 02:17:15,479
knows anything was wrong and we find out
 

7597
02:17:15,479 --> 02:17:16,950
knows anything was wrong and we find out
later because they happened to be

7598
02:17:16,950 --> 02:17:16,960
later because they happened to be
 

7599
02:17:16,960 --> 02:17:18,509
later because they happened to be
accidentally scanned for some reason

7600
02:17:18,509 --> 02:17:18,519
accidentally scanned for some reason
 

7601
02:17:18,519 --> 02:17:20,110
accidentally scanned for some reason
it's like what what's happened to your

7602
02:17:20,110 --> 02:17:20,120
it's like what what's happened to your
 

7603
02:17:20,120 --> 02:17:21,990
it's like what what's happened to your
left hemisphere it's missing there's not

7604
02:17:21,990 --> 02:17:22,000
left hemisphere it's missing there's not
 

7605
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:23,150
left hemisphere it's missing there's not
many people who miss their whole left

7606
02:17:23,150 --> 02:17:23,160
many people who miss their whole left
 

7607
02:17:23,160 --> 02:17:24,469
many people who miss their whole left
hemisphere but they'll be missing some

7608
02:17:24,469 --> 02:17:24,479
hemisphere but they'll be missing some
 

7609
02:17:24,479 --> 02:17:25,910
hemisphere but they'll be missing some
other section of their left or their

7610
02:17:25,910 --> 02:17:25,920
other section of their left or their
 

7611
02:17:25,920 --> 02:17:27,589
other section of their left or their
right and they behave absolutely

7612
02:17:27,589 --> 02:17:27,599
right and they behave absolutely
 

7613
02:17:27,599 --> 02:17:29,509
right and they behave absolutely
normally would never know so that's like

7614
02:17:29,509 --> 02:17:29,519
normally would never know so that's like
 

7615
02:17:29,519 --> 02:17:32,309
normally would never know so that's like
a very interesting you know current

7616
02:17:32,309 --> 02:17:32,319
a very interesting you know current
 

7617
02:17:32,319 --> 02:17:34,150
a very interesting you know current
research you know this is another

7618
02:17:34,150 --> 02:17:34,160
research you know this is another
 

7619
02:17:34,160 --> 02:17:36,429
research you know this is another
project that this person feno is working

7620
02:17:36,429 --> 02:17:36,439
project that this person feno is working
 

7621
02:17:36,439 --> 02:17:38,509
project that this person feno is working
on she's got all these people contacting

7622
02:17:38,509 --> 02:17:38,519
on she's got all these people contacting
 

7623
02:17:38,519 --> 02:17:41,389
on she's got all these people contacting
her because she's scanned some people

7624
02:17:41,389 --> 02:17:41,399
her because she's scanned some people
 

7625
02:17:41,399 --> 02:17:44,629
her because she's scanned some people
who have been mesing sections one person

7626
02:17:44,629 --> 02:17:44,639
who have been mesing sections one person
 

7627
02:17:44,639 --> 02:17:46,110
who have been mesing sections one person
missing missed a section of her brain

missing missed a section of her brain
 

7629
02:17:46,120 --> 02:17:48,349
missing missed a section of her brain
and was scanned in her lab and and she

7630
02:17:48,349 --> 02:17:48,359
and was scanned in her lab and and she
 

7631
02:17:48,359 --> 02:17:49,790
and was scanned in her lab and and she
and she happened to be a writer for the

just about the scanning procedure and
 

7639
02:17:56,760 --> 02:17:59,230
just about the scanning procedure and
and about what might be learned about by

similar kinds of deficits because
 

7653
02:18:12,280 --> 02:18:14,709
similar kinds of deficits because
they've been you know accidentally you

7654

they've been you know accidentally you
 

7655
02:18:14,719 --> 02:18:17,870
they've been you know accidentally you
know scanned for some reason and uh and

02:18:17,870 --> 02:18:17,880
know scanned for some reason and uh and
 

7657
02:18:17,880 --> 02:18:19,429
know scanned for some reason and uh and
found out they're missing some section

7658
02:18:19,429 --> 02:18:19,439
found out they're missing some section
 

7659
02:18:19,439 --> 02:18:21,669
found out they're missing some section
they they say they volunteer to be

7660
02:18:21,669 --> 02:18:21,679
they they say they volunteer to be
 

7661
02:18:21,679 --> 02:18:23,709
they they say they volunteer to be
scanned these are natural experiments

7662
02:18:23,709 --> 02:18:23,719
scanned these are natural experiments
 

7663
02:18:23,719 --> 02:18:25,110
scanned these are natural experiments
natural experiments they're kind of

7664
02:18:25,110 --> 02:18:25,120
natural experiments they're kind of
 

7665
02:18:25,120 --> 02:18:26,870
natural experiments they're kind of
messy but natural experiments kind of

7666
02:18:26,870 --> 02:18:26,880
messy but natural experiments kind of
 

7667
02:18:26,880 --> 02:18:29,230
messy but natural experiments kind of
cool she calls them interesting brains

7668

life are fascinating like U well inside
 

7673
02:18:35,160 --> 02:18:38,549
life are fascinating like U well inside
the womb actually like that

02:18:41,150 --> 02:18:41,160
development that Machinery whatever that
 

7677
02:18:41,160 --> 02:18:44,230
development that Machinery whatever that
is seems to create powerful humans that

7678
02:18:44,230 --> 02:18:44,240
is seems to create powerful humans that
 

7679
02:18:44,240 --> 02:18:46,349
is seems to create powerful humans that
are able to speak comprehend think all

7680
02:18:46,349 --> 02:18:46,359
are able to speak comprehend think all
 

7681
02:18:46,359 --> 02:18:48,070
are able to speak comprehend think all
that kind of stuff no matter what happen

7682
02:18:48,070 --> 02:18:48,080
that kind of stuff no matter what happen
 

7683
02:18:48,080 --> 02:18:50,990
that kind of stuff no matter what happen
not no matter what but robust to the

7684
02:18:50,990 --> 02:18:51,000
not no matter what but robust to the
 

7685
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:54,790
not no matter what but robust to the
different ways that U um the the the

7686
02:18:54,790 --> 02:18:54,800
different ways that U um the the the
 

7687
02:18:54,800 --> 02:18:56,469
different ways that U um the the the
brain might be damaged and so on that's

7688
02:18:56,469 --> 02:18:56,479
brain might be damaged and so on that's
 

7689
02:18:56,479 --> 02:18:58,389
brain might be damaged and so on that's
that's really that's really interesting

7690
02:18:58,389 --> 02:18:58,399
that's really that's really interesting
 

7691
02:18:58,399 --> 02:19:00,469
that's really that's really interesting
but yeah what what would Chomsky say

7692
02:19:00,469 --> 02:19:00,479
but yeah what what would Chomsky say
 

7693
02:19:00,479 --> 02:19:02,629
but yeah what what would Chomsky say
about the fact the thing you're saying

7694
02:19:02,629 --> 02:19:02,639
about the fact the thing you're saying
 

7695
02:19:02,639 --> 02:19:03,669
about the fact the thing you're saying
now that the

7696
02:19:03,669 --> 02:19:03,679
now that the
 

7697
02:19:03,679 --> 02:19:07,190
now that the
languages is seems to be happening

7698
02:19:07,190 --> 02:19:07,200
languages is seems to be happening
 

7699
02:19:07,200 --> 02:19:09,349
languages is seems to be happening
separate from thought because as far as

7700
02:19:09,349 --> 02:19:09,359
separate from thought because as far as
 

7701
02:19:09,359 --> 02:19:10,910
separate from thought because as far as
I understand maybe you can correct me he

7702
02:19:10,910 --> 02:19:10,920
I understand maybe you can correct me he
 

7703
02:19:10,920 --> 02:19:13,509
I understand maybe you can correct me he
thought that language underpins yeah he

7704
02:19:13,509 --> 02:19:13,519
thought that language underpins yeah he
 

7705
02:19:13,519 --> 02:19:15,270
thought that language underpins yeah he
thinks so I don't know what he'd say he

7706
02:19:15,270 --> 02:19:15,280
thinks so I don't know what he'd say he
 

7707
02:19:15,280 --> 02:19:17,270
thinks so I don't know what he'd say he
would be surprised cuz for him the idea

7708
02:19:17,270 --> 02:19:17,280
would be surprised cuz for him the idea
 

7709
02:19:17,280 --> 02:19:19,709
would be surprised cuz for him the idea
is that language is a sort of the

7710
02:19:19,709 --> 02:19:19,719
is that language is a sort of the
 

7711
02:19:19,719 --> 02:19:22,230
is that language is a sort of the
foundation of thought that's right

7712
02:19:22,230 --> 02:19:22,240
foundation of thought that's right
 

7713
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:24,469
foundation of thought that's right
absolutely and it's

7714
02:19:24,469 --> 02:19:24,479
absolutely and it's
 

7715
02:19:24,479 --> 02:19:26,990
absolutely and it's
pretty U mind-blowing to things that it

7716
02:19:26,990 --> 02:19:27,000
pretty U mind-blowing to things that it
 

7717
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:28,509
pretty U mind-blowing to things that it
could be completely separate from

7718
02:19:28,509 --> 02:19:28,519
could be completely separate from
 

7719
02:19:28,519 --> 02:19:30,070
could be completely separate from
thought that's right but so you know

7720
02:19:30,070 --> 02:19:30,080
thought that's right but so you know
 

7721
02:19:30,080 --> 02:19:32,910
thought that's right but so you know
he's basically a philosopher philosopher

7722
02:19:32,910 --> 02:19:32,920
he's basically a philosopher philosopher
 

7723
02:19:32,920 --> 02:19:34,190
he's basically a philosopher philosopher
of language in a way thinking about

7724
02:19:34,190 --> 02:19:34,200
of language in a way thinking about
 

7725
02:19:34,200 --> 02:19:36,750
of language in a way thinking about
these things it's a fine thought you

7726
02:19:36,750 --> 02:19:36,760
these things it's a fine thought you
 

7727
02:19:36,760 --> 02:19:39,790
these things it's a fine thought you
can't test it in his methods you can't

7728
02:19:39,790 --> 02:19:39,800
can't test it in his methods you can't
 

7729
02:19:39,800 --> 02:19:41,230
can't test it in his methods you can't
do do a thought experiment to figure

7730
02:19:41,230 --> 02:19:41,240
do do a thought experiment to figure
 

7731
02:19:41,240 --> 02:19:43,830
do do a thought experiment to figure
that out you need a scanner you need

7732
02:19:43,830 --> 02:19:43,840
that out you need a scanner you need
 

7733
02:19:43,840 --> 02:19:45,750
that out you need a scanner you need
brain damage people you need something

7734
02:19:45,750 --> 02:19:45,760
brain damage people you need something
 

7735
02:19:45,760 --> 02:19:47,669
brain damage people you need something
you need ways to to measure that and

7736
02:19:47,669 --> 02:19:47,679
you need ways to to measure that and
 

7737
02:19:47,679 --> 02:19:50,870
you need ways to to measure that and
that's what you know fmri offers as a

7738
02:19:50,870 --> 02:19:50,880
that's what you know fmri offers as a
 

7739
02:19:50,880 --> 02:19:53,110
that's what you know fmri offers as a
and and you know patients are a little

7740
02:19:53,110 --> 02:19:53,120
and and you know patients are a little
 

7741
02:19:53,120 --> 02:19:56,270
and and you know patients are a little
Messier fmri is pretty unambiguous I'd

7742
02:19:56,270 --> 02:19:56,280
Messier fmri is pretty unambiguous I'd
 

7743
02:19:56,280 --> 02:19:58,590
Messier fmri is pretty unambiguous I'd
say it's like very unambiguous there is

7744
02:19:58,590 --> 02:19:58,600
say it's like very unambiguous there is
 

7745
02:19:58,600 --> 02:20:01,990
say it's like very unambiguous there is
no way to say that the language network

7746
02:20:01,990 --> 02:20:02,000
no way to say that the language network
 

7747
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,230
no way to say that the language network
is doing any of these tasks there's like

7748
02:20:04,230 --> 02:20:04,240
is doing any of these tasks there's like
 

7749
02:20:04,240 --> 02:20:05,710
is doing any of these tasks there's like
you you should look at those data it's

7750
02:20:05,710 --> 02:20:05,720
you you should look at those data it's
 

7751
02:20:05,720 --> 02:20:07,349
you you should look at those data it's
like there's no chance that you can say

7752
02:20:07,349 --> 02:20:07,359
like there's no chance that you can say
 

7753
02:20:07,359 --> 02:20:09,030
like there's no chance that you can say
that there those networks are

7754
02:20:09,030 --> 02:20:09,040
that there those networks are
 

7755
02:20:09,040 --> 02:20:10,230
that there those networks are
overlapping they're not overlapping

7756
02:20:10,230 --> 02:20:10,240
overlapping they're not overlapping
 

7757
02:20:10,240 --> 02:20:12,070
overlapping they're not overlapping
they're just like completely different

7758
02:20:12,070 --> 02:20:12,080
they're just like completely different
 

7759
02:20:12,080 --> 02:20:14,309
they're just like completely different
and so uh you know so the you know you

7760
02:20:14,309 --> 02:20:14,319
and so uh you know so the you know you
 

7761
02:20:14,319 --> 02:20:15,910
and so uh you know so the you know you
can always make you know it's only two

7762
02:20:15,910 --> 02:20:15,920
can always make you know it's only two
 

7763
02:20:15,920 --> 02:20:17,750
can always make you know it's only two
people it's four people or something for

7764
02:20:17,750 --> 02:20:17,760
people it's four people or something for
 

7765
02:20:17,760 --> 02:20:19,550
people it's four people or something for
the the patients and there's something

7766
02:20:19,550 --> 02:20:19,560
the the patients and there's something
 

7767
02:20:19,560 --> 02:20:21,070
the the patients and there's something
special about them we don't know but

7768
02:20:21,070 --> 02:20:21,080
special about them we don't know but
 

7769
02:20:21,080 --> 02:20:23,830
special about them we don't know but
these are just random people and and

7770
02:20:23,830 --> 02:20:23,840
these are just random people and and
 

7771
02:20:23,840 --> 02:20:26,349
these are just random people and and
with lots of them and you find always

7772
02:20:26,349 --> 02:20:26,359
with lots of them and you find always
 

7773
02:20:26,359 --> 02:20:28,349
with lots of them and you find always
the same effects and it's very robust

7774
02:20:28,349 --> 02:20:28,359
the same effects and it's very robust
 

7775
02:20:28,359 --> 02:20:31,670
the same effects and it's very robust
I'd say what's a fascinating effect uh

7776
02:20:31,670 --> 02:20:31,680
I'd say what's a fascinating effect uh
 

7777
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:34,429
I'd say what's a fascinating effect uh
what's the you mentioned Bolivia M uh

7778
02:20:34,429 --> 02:20:34,439
what's the you mentioned Bolivia M uh
 

7779
02:20:34,439 --> 02:20:36,389
what's the you mentioned Bolivia M uh
what's the connection between culture

7780
02:20:36,389 --> 02:20:36,399
what's the connection between culture
 

7781
02:20:36,399 --> 02:20:37,630
what's the connection between culture
and

7782
02:20:37,630 --> 02:20:37,640
and
 

7783
02:20:37,640 --> 02:20:39,230
and
language

7784
02:20:39,230 --> 02:20:39,240
language
 

7785
02:20:39,240 --> 02:20:42,750
language
uh you've uh you've also mentioned that

7786
02:20:42,750 --> 02:20:42,760
uh you've uh you've also mentioned that
 

7787
02:20:42,760 --> 02:20:45,510
uh you've uh you've also mentioned that
you know much of our study of language

7788
02:20:45,510 --> 02:20:45,520
you know much of our study of language
 

7789
02:20:45,520 --> 02:20:49,950
you know much of our study of language
comes from uh Weir D weird people

7790
02:20:49,950 --> 02:20:49,960
comes from uh Weir D weird people
 

7791
02:20:49,960 --> 02:20:52,750
comes from uh Weir D weird people
Western educ at industrialized rich and

7792
02:20:52,750 --> 02:20:52,760
Western educ at industrialized rich and
 

7793
02:20:52,760 --> 02:20:56,309
Western educ at industrialized rich and
Democratic so when you study like remote

7794
02:20:56,309 --> 02:20:56,319
Democratic so when you study like remote
 

7795
02:20:56,319 --> 02:20:58,790
Democratic so when you study like remote
cultures such as around the Amazon

7796
02:20:58,790 --> 02:20:58,800
cultures such as around the Amazon
 

7797
02:20:58,800 --> 02:21:02,110
cultures such as around the Amazon
jungle what can you learn about language

7798
02:21:02,110 --> 02:21:02,120
jungle what can you learn about language
 

7799
02:21:02,120 --> 02:21:05,070
jungle what can you learn about language
so uh that term weird is from Joe

7800
02:21:05,070 --> 02:21:05,080
so uh that term weird is from Joe
 

7801
02:21:05,080 --> 02:21:07,389
so uh that term weird is from Joe
Henrich he's at uh Harvard he's a

7802
02:21:07,389 --> 02:21:07,399
Henrich he's at uh Harvard he's a
 

7803
02:21:07,399 --> 02:21:10,469
Henrich he's at uh Harvard he's a
Harvard evolutionary biologist and so he

7804
02:21:10,469 --> 02:21:10,479
Harvard evolutionary biologist and so he
 

7805
02:21:10,479 --> 02:21:14,270
Harvard evolutionary biologist and so he
works on lots of different topics and uh

7806
02:21:14,270 --> 02:21:14,280
works on lots of different topics and uh
 

7807
02:21:14,280 --> 02:21:16,270
works on lots of different topics and uh
he basically was pushing that

7808
02:21:16,270 --> 02:21:16,280
he basically was pushing that
 

7809
02:21:16,280 --> 02:21:18,510
he basically was pushing that
observation that we should be careful

7810
02:21:18,510 --> 02:21:18,520
observation that we should be careful
 

7811
02:21:18,520 --> 02:21:20,590
observation that we should be careful
about the inferences we want to make

7812
02:21:20,590 --> 02:21:20,600
about the inferences we want to make
 

7813
02:21:20,600 --> 02:21:24,030
about the inferences we want to make
when we're talk in Psychology or soci

7814
02:21:24,030 --> 02:21:24,040
when we're talk in Psychology or soci
 

7815
02:21:24,040 --> 02:21:26,830
when we're talk in Psychology or soci
yeah mostly in Psychology I guess about

7816
02:21:26,830 --> 02:21:26,840
yeah mostly in Psychology I guess about
 

7817
02:21:26,840 --> 02:21:29,429
yeah mostly in Psychology I guess about
humans if we're talking about you know

7818
02:21:29,429 --> 02:21:29,439
humans if we're talking about you know
 

7819
02:21:29,439 --> 02:21:32,150
humans if we're talking about you know
undergrads at MIT in Harvard those

7820
02:21:32,150 --> 02:21:32,160
undergrads at MIT in Harvard those
 

7821
02:21:32,160 --> 02:21:33,750
undergrads at MIT in Harvard those
aren't the same right these aren't the

7822
02:21:33,750 --> 02:21:33,760
aren't the same right these aren't the
 

7823
02:21:33,760 --> 02:21:35,150
aren't the same right these aren't the
same things and so if you want to make

7824
02:21:35,150 --> 02:21:35,160
same things and so if you want to make
 

7825
02:21:35,160 --> 02:21:37,790
same things and so if you want to make
inferences about language for instance

7826
02:21:37,790 --> 02:21:37,800
inferences about language for instance
 

7827
02:21:37,800 --> 02:21:40,990
inferences about language for instance
you there's a lot of VAR a lot of other

7828
02:21:40,990 --> 02:21:41,000
you there's a lot of VAR a lot of other
 

7829
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:42,630
you there's a lot of VAR a lot of other
kinds of languages in the world than

7830
02:21:42,630 --> 02:21:42,640
kinds of languages in the world than
 

7831
02:21:42,640 --> 02:21:45,429
kinds of languages in the world than
English and French and Chinese you know

7832
02:21:45,429 --> 02:21:45,439
English and French and Chinese you know
 

7833
02:21:45,439 --> 02:21:48,510
English and French and Chinese you know
and so maybe in for for for language we

7834
02:21:48,510 --> 02:21:48,520
and so maybe in for for for language we
 

7835
02:21:48,520 --> 02:21:51,429
and so maybe in for for for language we
care about how culture because cultures

7836
02:21:51,429 --> 02:21:51,439
care about how culture because cultures
 

7837
02:21:51,439 --> 02:21:53,309
care about how culture because cultures
can be very I mean of course English and

7838
02:21:53,309 --> 02:21:53,319
can be very I mean of course English and
 

7839
02:21:53,319 --> 02:21:55,630
can be very I mean of course English and
Chinese cultures are very different but

7840
02:21:55,630 --> 02:21:55,640
Chinese cultures are very different but
 

7841
02:21:55,640 --> 02:21:57,550
Chinese cultures are very different but
in you know hunter gatherers are much

7842
02:21:57,550 --> 02:21:57,560
in you know hunter gatherers are much
 

7843
02:21:57,560 --> 02:22:00,150
in you know hunter gatherers are much
more different in in some ways and so

7844
02:22:00,150 --> 02:22:00,160
more different in in some ways and so
 

7845
02:22:00,160 --> 02:22:02,230
more different in in some ways and so
you know if culture has an effect in

7846
02:22:02,230 --> 02:22:02,240
you know if culture has an effect in
 

7847
02:22:02,240 --> 02:22:04,950
you know if culture has an effect in
what language is then we kind of want to

7848
02:22:04,950 --> 02:22:04,960
what language is then we kind of want to
 

7849
02:22:04,960 --> 02:22:07,110
what language is then we kind of want to
look there as well as looking it's not

7850
02:22:07,110 --> 02:22:07,120
look there as well as looking it's not
 

7851
02:22:07,120 --> 02:22:08,389
look there as well as looking it's not
like the industrialized cultures aren't

7852
02:22:08,389 --> 02:22:08,399
like the industrialized cultures aren't
 

7853
02:22:08,399 --> 02:22:10,110
like the industrialized cultures aren't
interesting of course they are but we

7854
02:22:10,110 --> 02:22:10,120
interesting of course they are but we
 

7855
02:22:10,120 --> 02:22:11,990
interesting of course they are but we
want to look at non-industrialized

7856
02:22:11,990 --> 02:22:12,000
want to look at non-industrialized
 

7857
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,030
want to look at non-industrialized
cultures as well and so I worked with

7858
02:22:14,030 --> 02:22:14,040
cultures as well and so I worked with
 

7859
02:22:14,040 --> 02:22:16,630
cultures as well and so I worked with
two I work with the chimani which are in

7860
02:22:16,630 --> 02:22:16,640
two I work with the chimani which are in
 

7861
02:22:16,640 --> 02:22:20,270
two I work with the chimani which are in
um Bolivia and and there Amazon both in

7862
02:22:20,270 --> 02:22:20,280
um Bolivia and and there Amazon both in
 

7863
02:22:20,280 --> 02:22:22,429
um Bolivia and and there Amazon both in
the Amazon these cases and there are

7864
02:22:22,429 --> 02:22:22,439
the Amazon these cases and there are
 

7865
02:22:22,439 --> 02:22:24,710
the Amazon these cases and there are
so-called farmer foragers which is not

7866
02:22:24,710 --> 02:22:24,720
so-called farmer foragers which is not
 

7867
02:22:24,720 --> 02:22:27,469
so-called farmer foragers which is not
hunter gatherers um it's sort of one up

7868
02:22:27,469 --> 02:22:27,479
hunter gatherers um it's sort of one up
 

7869
02:22:27,479 --> 02:22:29,110
hunter gatherers um it's sort of one up
from hunter gatherers and that they do a

7870
02:22:29,110 --> 02:22:29,120
from hunter gatherers and that they do a
 

7871
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:30,750
from hunter gatherers and that they do a
little bit of farming as well a lot of

7872
02:22:30,750 --> 02:22:30,760
little bit of farming as well a lot of
 

7873
02:22:30,760 --> 02:22:32,990
little bit of farming as well a lot of
hunting as well but a little bit of

7874
02:22:32,990 --> 02:22:33,000
hunting as well but a little bit of
 

7875
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:34,550
hunting as well but a little bit of
farming and the kind of farming they do

7876
02:22:34,550 --> 02:22:34,560
farming and the kind of farming they do
 

7877
02:22:34,560 --> 02:22:36,630
farming and the kind of farming they do
is the kind of farming that I might do

7878
02:22:36,630 --> 02:22:36,640
is the kind of farming that I might do
 

7879
02:22:36,640 --> 02:22:38,790
is the kind of farming that I might do
if I ever were to grow like tomatoes or

7880
02:22:38,790 --> 02:22:38,800
if I ever were to grow like tomatoes or
 

7881
02:22:38,800 --> 02:22:40,630
if I ever were to grow like tomatoes or
something in my backyard it's it's that

something in my backyard it's it's that
 

7883
02:22:40,640 --> 02:22:41,950
something in my backyard it's it's that
it's not like so it's not like Big Field

7884
02:22:41,950 --> 02:22:41,960
it's not like so it's not like Big Field
 

7885
02:22:41,960 --> 02:22:44,630

what what can you say about that yeah so

7912
02:23:17,870 --> 02:23:17,880
what what can you say about that yeah so
 

7913
02:23:17,880 --> 02:23:19,389
what what can you say about that yeah so
the two groups I've worked with the

7914
02:23:19,389 --> 02:23:19,399
the two groups I've worked with the
 

7915
02:23:19,399 --> 02:23:21,110
the two groups I've worked with the
chimani and the P are both

7916
02:23:21,110 --> 02:23:21,120
chimani and the P are both
 

7917
02:23:21,120 --> 02:23:24,550
chimani and the P are both
isolate languages meaning there's no

7918
02:23:24,550 --> 02:23:24,560
isolate languages meaning there's no
 

7919
02:23:24,560 --> 02:23:26,590
isolate languages meaning there's no
known connected languages at all they're

7920
02:23:26,590 --> 02:23:26,600
known connected languages at all they're
 

7921
02:23:26,600 --> 02:23:28,230
known connected languages at all they're
just like on their own yeah there's a

7922
02:23:28,230 --> 02:23:28,240
just like on their own yeah there's a
 

7923
02:23:28,240 --> 02:23:30,150
just like on their own yeah there's a
lot of those and and most of the

7924
02:23:30,150 --> 02:23:30,160
lot of those and and most of the
 

7925
02:23:30,160 --> 02:23:34,150
lot of those and and most of the
isolates occur in in the in the Amazon

7926
02:23:34,150 --> 02:23:34,160
isolates occur in in the in the Amazon
 

7927
02:23:34,160 --> 02:23:37,070
isolates occur in in the in the Amazon
or in Papu Guinea and these these places

7928
02:23:37,070 --> 02:23:37,080
or in Papu Guinea and these these places
 

7929
02:23:37,080 --> 02:23:40,830
or in Papu Guinea and these these places
where the world has sort of stayed still

7930
02:23:40,830 --> 02:23:40,840
where the world has sort of stayed still
 

7931
02:23:40,840 --> 02:23:43,910
where the world has sort of stayed still
for long enough and they're have like so

7932
02:23:43,910 --> 02:23:43,920
for long enough and they're have like so
 

7933
02:23:43,920 --> 02:23:46,389
for long enough and they're have like so
there there aren't earthquakes there

7934
02:23:46,389 --> 02:23:46,399
there there aren't earthquakes there
 

7935
02:23:46,399 --> 02:23:48,950
there there aren't earthquakes there
aren't um ah well certainly no

7936
02:23:48,950 --> 02:23:48,960
aren't um ah well certainly no
 

7937
02:23:48,960 --> 02:23:51,429
aren't um ah well certainly no
earthquakes in the Amazon jungle and and

7938
02:23:51,429 --> 02:23:51,439
earthquakes in the Amazon jungle and and
 

7939
02:23:51,439 --> 02:23:54,030
earthquakes in the Amazon jungle and and
and uh the climate isn't bad so you

7940
02:23:54,030 --> 02:23:54,040
and uh the climate isn't bad so you
 

7941
02:23:54,040 --> 02:23:56,590
and uh the climate isn't bad so you
don't have droughts and so you know in

7942
02:23:56,590 --> 02:23:56,600
don't have droughts and so you know in
 

7943
02:23:56,600 --> 02:23:58,389
don't have droughts and so you know in
Africa you've got a lot of moving of

7944
02:23:58,389 --> 02:23:58,399
Africa you've got a lot of moving of
 

7945
02:23:58,399 --> 02:24:00,230
Africa you've got a lot of moving of
people because there's drought problems

7946
02:24:00,230 --> 02:24:00,240
people because there's drought problems
 

7947
02:24:00,240 --> 02:24:01,590
people because there's drought problems
and so so they get a lot of language

7948
02:24:01,590 --> 02:24:01,600
and so so they get a lot of language
 

7949
02:24:01,600 --> 02:24:03,429
and so so they get a lot of language
contact when you have when people have

7950
02:24:03,429 --> 02:24:03,439
contact when you have when people have
 

7951
02:24:03,439 --> 02:24:06,110
contact when you have when people have
to if you got to move because you're you

7952
02:24:06,110 --> 02:24:06,120
to if you got to move because you're you
 

7953
02:24:06,120 --> 02:24:08,790
to if you got to move because you're you
got no water then you got to get going

7954
02:24:08,790 --> 02:24:08,800
got no water then you got to get going
 

7955
02:24:08,800 --> 02:24:10,750
got no water then you got to get going
and then uh then you run into contact

7956
02:24:10,750 --> 02:24:10,760
and then uh then you run into contact
 

7957
02:24:10,760 --> 02:24:13,630
and then uh then you run into contact
with other other tribes other groups in

7958
02:24:13,630 --> 02:24:13,640
with other other tribes other groups in
 

7959
02:24:13,640 --> 02:24:15,469
with other other tribes other groups in
in the Amazon that's not the case and so

7960
02:24:15,469 --> 02:24:15,479
in the Amazon that's not the case and so
 

7961
02:24:15,479 --> 02:24:17,150
in the Amazon that's not the case and so
people can stay there for hundreds and

7962
02:24:17,150 --> 02:24:17,160
people can stay there for hundreds and
 

7963
02:24:17,160 --> 02:24:18,790
people can stay there for hundreds and
hundreds and probably thousands of years

7964
02:24:18,790 --> 02:24:18,800
hundreds and probably thousands of years
 

7965
02:24:18,800 --> 02:24:20,910
hundreds and probably thousands of years
I guess and so these groups

7966
02:24:20,910 --> 02:24:20,920
I guess and so these groups
 

7967
02:24:20,920 --> 02:24:22,750
I guess and so these groups
the the chimani and the pan are both

7968
02:24:22,750 --> 02:24:22,760
the the chimani and the pan are both
 

7969
02:24:22,760 --> 02:24:24,830
the the chimani and the pan are both
isolates in that and they just I guess

7970
02:24:24,830 --> 02:24:24,840
isolates in that and they just I guess
 

7971
02:24:24,840 --> 02:24:26,389
isolates in that and they just I guess
they've just lived there for ages and

7972
02:24:26,389 --> 02:24:26,399
they've just lived there for ages and
 

7973
02:24:26,399 --> 02:24:29,269
they've just lived there for ages and
ages with minimal contact with other

7974
02:24:29,269 --> 02:24:29,279
ages with minimal contact with other
 

7975
02:24:29,279 --> 02:24:33,269
ages with minimal contact with other
outside groups um and so I I mean I'm

7976
02:24:33,269 --> 02:24:33,279
outside groups um and so I I mean I'm
 

7977
02:24:33,279 --> 02:24:35,990
outside groups um and so I I mean I'm
interested in them because they are I

7978
02:24:35,990 --> 02:24:36,000
interested in them because they are I
 

7979
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:37,910
interested in them because they are I
mean I you know in these case I'm

7980
02:24:37,910 --> 02:24:37,920
mean I you know in these case I'm
 

7981
02:24:37,920 --> 02:24:39,550
mean I you know in these case I'm
interested in their words I I would love

7982
02:24:39,550 --> 02:24:39,560
interested in their words I I would love
 

7983
02:24:39,560 --> 02:24:41,710
interested in their words I I would love
to study their syntax their orders of

7984
02:24:41,710 --> 02:24:41,720
to study their syntax their orders of
 

7985
02:24:41,720 --> 02:24:43,469
to study their syntax their orders of
words but I'm mostly just interested in

7986
02:24:43,469 --> 02:24:43,479
words but I'm mostly just interested in
 

7987
02:24:43,479 --> 02:24:46,990
words but I'm mostly just interested in
how languages you know are connected to

7988
02:24:46,990 --> 02:24:47,000
how languages you know are connected to
 

7989
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,469
how languages you know are connected to
um their their cultures in this way and

7990
02:24:49,469 --> 02:24:49,479
um their their cultures in this way and
 

7991
02:24:49,479 --> 02:24:51,670
um their their cultures in this way and
so with the pahan so most interesting I

7992
02:24:51,670 --> 02:24:51,680
so with the pahan so most interesting I
 

7993
02:24:51,680 --> 02:24:53,309
so with the pahan so most interesting I
was working I was working on number

7994
02:24:53,309 --> 02:24:53,319
was working I was working on number
 

7995
02:24:53,319 --> 02:24:55,590
was working I was working on number
there number information and so the the

7996
02:24:55,590 --> 02:24:55,600
there number information and so the the
 

7997
02:24:55,600 --> 02:24:56,950
there number information and so the the
basic idea is I think language is

7998
02:24:56,950 --> 02:24:56,960
basic idea is I think language is
 

7999
02:24:56,960 --> 02:24:58,630
basic idea is I think language is
invented this what I get from the words

8000
02:24:58,630 --> 02:24:58,640
invented this what I get from the words
 

8001
02:24:58,640 --> 02:24:59,910
invented this what I get from the words
here is that I think language is

8002
02:24:59,910 --> 02:24:59,920
here is that I think language is
 

8003
02:24:59,920 --> 02:25:01,870
here is that I think language is
invented we talked about color earlier

8004
02:25:01,870 --> 02:25:01,880
invented we talked about color earlier
 

8005
02:25:01,880 --> 02:25:04,750
invented we talked about color earlier
it's the same idea so that what you need

8006
02:25:04,750 --> 02:25:04,760
it's the same idea so that what you need
 

8007
02:25:04,760 --> 02:25:07,349
it's the same idea so that what you need
to talk about with someone else is what

8008
02:25:07,349 --> 02:25:07,359
to talk about with someone else is what
 

8009
02:25:07,359 --> 02:25:09,269
to talk about with someone else is what
you're going to invent words for okay

8010
02:25:09,269 --> 02:25:09,279
you're going to invent words for okay
 

8011
02:25:09,279 --> 02:25:12,230
you're going to invent words for okay
and so we invent labels for colors that

8012
02:25:12,230 --> 02:25:12,240
and so we invent labels for colors that
 

8013
02:25:12,240 --> 02:25:14,950
and so we invent labels for colors that
I need not that I that I can see but

8014
02:25:14,950 --> 02:25:14,960
I need not that I that I can see but
 

8015
02:25:14,960 --> 02:25:16,710
I need not that I that I can see but
that but the things I need to tell you

8016
02:25:16,710 --> 02:25:16,720
that but the things I need to tell you
 

8017
02:25:16,720 --> 02:25:18,550
that but the things I need to tell you
about so that I can get objects from you

8018
02:25:18,550 --> 02:25:18,560
about so that I can get objects from you
 

8019
02:25:18,560 --> 02:25:20,070
about so that I can get objects from you
or get you to give me the right objects

8020
02:25:20,070 --> 02:25:20,080
or get you to give me the right objects
 

8021
02:25:20,080 --> 02:25:22,910
or get you to give me the right objects
and I just don't need a word for teal or

8022
02:25:22,910 --> 02:25:22,920
and I just don't need a word for teal or
 

8023
02:25:22,920 --> 02:25:26,190
and I just don't need a word for teal or
or a word for aquamarine in in the in

8024
02:25:26,190 --> 02:25:26,200
or a word for aquamarine in in the in
 

8025
02:25:26,200 --> 02:25:27,590
or a word for aquamarine in in the in
the Amazon jungle for the most part

8026
02:25:27,590 --> 02:25:27,600
the Amazon jungle for the most part
 

8027
02:25:27,600 --> 02:25:29,110
the Amazon jungle for the most part
because I don't have two things which

8028
02:25:29,110 --> 02:25:29,120
because I don't have two things which
 

8029
02:25:29,120 --> 02:25:31,070
because I don't have two things which
differ on those colors I just don't have

8030
02:25:31,070 --> 02:25:31,080
differ on those colors I just don't have
 

8031
02:25:31,080 --> 02:25:33,110
differ on those colors I just don't have
that and so and so numbers are really

8032
02:25:33,110 --> 02:25:33,120
that and so and so numbers are really
 

8033
02:25:33,120 --> 02:25:35,630
that and so and so numbers are really
another fascinating in um source of

8034
02:25:35,630 --> 02:25:35,640
another fascinating in um source of
 

8035
02:25:35,640 --> 02:25:38,429
another fascinating in um source of
information here where um you might you

8036
02:25:38,429 --> 02:25:38,439
information here where um you might you
 

8037
02:25:38,439 --> 02:25:41,190
information here where um you might you
know naively I certainly thought that

8038
02:25:41,190 --> 02:25:41,200
know naively I certainly thought that
 

8039
02:25:41,200 --> 02:25:44,870
know naively I certainly thought that
all humans would have words for exact

8040
02:25:44,870 --> 02:25:44,880
all humans would have words for exact
 

8041
02:25:44,880 --> 02:25:47,830
all humans would have words for exact
counting uh and the pioa don't okay so

8042
02:25:47,830 --> 02:25:47,840
counting uh and the pioa don't okay so
 

8043
02:25:47,840 --> 02:25:50,590
counting uh and the pioa don't okay so
they don't have any words for even

8044
02:25:50,590 --> 02:25:50,600
they don't have any words for even
 

8045
02:25:50,600 --> 02:25:52,790
they don't have any words for even
there's not a word for one in their in

8046
02:25:52,790 --> 02:25:52,800
there's not a word for one in their in
 

8047
02:25:52,800 --> 02:25:54,830
there's not a word for one in their in
their language and so there's certainly

8048
02:25:54,830 --> 02:25:54,840
their language and so there's certainly
 

8049
02:25:54,840 --> 02:25:57,469
their language and so there's certainly
not a word for two three or four so so

8050
02:25:57,469 --> 02:25:57,479
not a word for two three or four so so
 

8051
02:25:57,479 --> 02:25:59,110
not a word for two three or four so so
so that kind of blows people's minds

8052
02:25:59,110 --> 02:25:59,120
so that kind of blows people's minds
 

8053
02:25:59,120 --> 02:26:01,030
so that kind of blows people's minds
often yeah that blowing my mind that's

8054
02:26:01,030 --> 02:26:01,040
often yeah that blowing my mind that's
 

8055
02:26:01,040 --> 02:26:02,230
often yeah that blowing my mind that's
pretty weird how are you how are you

8056
02:26:02,230 --> 02:26:02,240
pretty weird how are you how are you
 

8057
02:26:02,240 --> 02:26:04,190
pretty weird how are you how are you
going to ask I want two of those you

8058
02:26:04,190 --> 02:26:04,200
going to ask I want two of those you
 

8059
02:26:04,200 --> 02:26:06,469
going to ask I want two of those you
just don't and so that's just not a

8060
02:26:06,469 --> 02:26:06,479
just don't and so that's just not a
 

8061
02:26:06,479 --> 02:26:08,670
just don't and so that's just not a
thing you can possibly ask in the P it's

8062
02:26:08,670 --> 02:26:08,680
thing you can possibly ask in the P it's
 

8063
02:26:08,680 --> 02:26:10,230
thing you can possibly ask in the P it's
not possible that is there is no words

8064
02:26:10,230 --> 02:26:10,240
not possible that is there is no words
 

8065
02:26:10,240 --> 02:26:12,750
not possible that is there is no words
for that so here's how we found this out

8066
02:26:12,750 --> 02:26:12,760
for that so here's how we found this out
 

8067
02:26:12,760 --> 02:26:15,110
for that so here's how we found this out
okay so so it was thought to be a one

8068
02:26:15,110 --> 02:26:15,120
okay so so it was thought to be a one
 

8069
02:26:15,120 --> 02:26:17,389
okay so so it was thought to be a one
too many language there are three words

8070
02:26:17,389 --> 02:26:17,399
too many language there are three words
 

8071
02:26:17,399 --> 02:26:20,910
too many language there are three words
for quantifiers for for for sets but um

8072
02:26:20,910 --> 02:26:20,920
for quantifiers for for for sets but um
 

8073
02:26:20,920 --> 02:26:22,790
for quantifiers for for for sets but um
and and people had thought that those

8074
02:26:22,790 --> 02:26:22,800
and and people had thought that those
 

8075
02:26:22,800 --> 02:26:25,150
and and people had thought that those
meant one two and many uh but what they

8076
02:26:25,150 --> 02:26:25,160
meant one two and many uh but what they
 

8077
02:26:25,160 --> 02:26:27,389
meant one two and many uh but what they
really mean is few some and many many is

8078
02:26:27,389 --> 02:26:27,399
really mean is few some and many many is
 

8079
02:26:27,399 --> 02:26:29,670
really mean is few some and many many is
correct it's few some and many and so

8080
02:26:29,670 --> 02:26:29,680
correct it's few some and many and so
 

8081
02:26:29,680 --> 02:26:32,389
correct it's few some and many and so
and so the way we figured this out and

8082
02:26:32,389 --> 02:26:32,399
and so the way we figured this out and
 

8083
02:26:32,399 --> 02:26:35,429
and so the way we figured this out and
uh this is kind of cool is that um we

8084
02:26:35,429 --> 02:26:35,439
uh this is kind of cool is that um we
 

8085
02:26:35,439 --> 02:26:36,269
uh this is kind of cool is that um we
gave

8086
02:26:36,269 --> 02:26:36,279
gave
 

8087
02:26:36,279 --> 02:26:38,590
gave
people uh we had a set of objects okay

8088
02:26:38,590 --> 02:26:38,600
people uh we had a set of objects okay
 

8089
02:26:38,600 --> 02:26:40,030
people uh we had a set of objects okay
these were having to be spools of thread

8090
02:26:40,030 --> 02:26:40,040
these were having to be spools of thread
 

8091
02:26:40,040 --> 02:26:40,910
these were having to be spools of thread
doesn't really matter what they are

8092
02:26:40,910 --> 02:26:40,920
doesn't really matter what they are
 

8093
02:26:40,920 --> 02:26:43,710
doesn't really matter what they are
identical objects and and and I sort of

8094
02:26:43,710 --> 02:26:43,720
identical objects and and and I sort of
 

8095
02:26:43,720 --> 02:26:45,630
identical objects and and and I sort of
start off here I just give you know give

8096
02:26:45,630 --> 02:26:45,640
start off here I just give you know give
 

8097
02:26:45,640 --> 02:26:47,070
start off here I just give you know give
you one of those and say what's that

8098
02:26:47,070 --> 02:26:47,080
you one of those and say what's that
 

8099
02:26:47,080 --> 02:26:48,670
you one of those and say what's that
okay see you're a p speaker and you tell

8100
02:26:48,670 --> 02:26:48,680
okay see you're a p speaker and you tell
 

8101
02:26:48,680 --> 02:26:50,670
okay see you're a p speaker and you tell
me what it is and and then I give you

8102
02:26:50,670 --> 02:26:50,680
me what it is and and then I give you
 

8103
02:26:50,680 --> 02:26:52,269
me what it is and and then I give you
two and say what's that and and

8104
02:26:52,269 --> 02:26:52,279
two and say what's that and and
 

8105
02:26:52,279 --> 02:26:54,269
two and say what's that and and
nothing's changing in the set except for

8106
02:26:54,269 --> 02:26:54,279
nothing's changing in the set except for
 

8107
02:26:54,279 --> 02:26:55,990
nothing's changing in the set except for
the number okay and then I just ask you

8108
02:26:55,990 --> 02:26:56,000
the number okay and then I just ask you
 

8109
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:57,349
the number okay and then I just ask you
to label these things we just do this

8110
02:26:57,349 --> 02:26:57,359
to label these things we just do this
 

8111
02:26:57,359 --> 02:26:58,830
to label these things we just do this
for a bunch of different people and and

8112
02:26:58,830 --> 02:26:58,840
for a bunch of different people and and
 

8113
02:26:58,840 --> 02:27:01,389
for a bunch of different people and and
frankly it's a I I did this task this is

8114
02:27:01,389 --> 02:27:01,399
frankly it's a I I did this task this is
 

8115
02:27:01,399 --> 02:27:03,070
frankly it's a I I did this task this is
f and it's a weird it's a little bit

8116
02:27:03,070 --> 02:27:03,080
f and it's a weird it's a little bit
 

8117
02:27:03,080 --> 02:27:05,030
f and it's a weird it's a little bit
weird so you they say the word that they

8118
02:27:05,030 --> 02:27:05,040
weird so you they say the word that they
 

8119
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:07,030
weird so you they say the word that they
thought that we thought was one it's few

8120
02:27:07,030 --> 02:27:07,040
thought that we thought was one it's few
 

8121
02:27:07,040 --> 02:27:08,670
thought that we thought was one it's few
but for the first one and then maybe

8122
02:27:08,670 --> 02:27:08,680
but for the first one and then maybe
 

8123
02:27:08,680 --> 02:27:10,309
but for the first one and then maybe
they say few or maybe they say some for

8124
02:27:10,309 --> 02:27:10,319
they say few or maybe they say some for
 

8125
02:27:10,319 --> 02:27:12,030
they say few or maybe they say some for
the second and then for the third or the

8126
02:27:12,030 --> 02:27:12,040
the second and then for the third or the
 

8127
02:27:12,040 --> 02:27:14,190
the second and then for the third or the
fourth they start using the word many

8128
02:27:14,190 --> 02:27:14,200
fourth they start using the word many
 

8129
02:27:14,200 --> 02:27:17,309
fourth they start using the word many
for the set and then five six seven

8130
02:27:17,309 --> 02:27:17,319
for the set and then five six seven
 

8131
02:27:17,319 --> 02:27:19,830
for the set and then five six seven
eight I go all the way to 10 and it's

8132
02:27:19,830 --> 02:27:19,840

it's a little funny to do this task over

8158
02:27:45,710 --> 02:27:45,720
it's a little funny to do this task over
 

8159

it's a little funny to do this task over
and over we did this with the guy called

you do that okay and everyone does the

8176
02:28:07,710 --> 02:28:07,720
you do that okay and everyone does the
 

8177
02:28:07,720 --> 02:28:09,830
you do that okay and everyone does the
same thing all all all you know we asked

8178
02:28:09,830 --> 02:28:09,840
same thing all all all you know we asked
 

8179
02:28:09,840 --> 02:28:11,750
same thing all all all you know we asked
like 10 people and they all do exactly

8180
02:28:11,750 --> 02:28:11,760
like 10 people and they all do exactly
 

8181
02:28:11,760 --> 02:28:13,790
like 10 people and they all do exactly
the same labeling for one up and then we

8182
02:28:13,790 --> 02:28:13,800
the same labeling for one up and then we
 

8183
02:28:13,800 --> 02:28:15,910
the same labeling for one up and then we
just do the same thing down on like

8184
02:28:15,910 --> 02:28:15,920
just do the same thing down on like
 

8185
02:28:15,920 --> 02:28:17,309
just do the same thing down on like
random order actually we do some of them

8186
02:28:17,309 --> 02:28:17,319
random order actually we do some of them
 

8187
02:28:17,319 --> 02:28:19,429
random order actually we do some of them
up some of them down first okay and so

8188
02:28:19,429 --> 02:28:19,439
up some of them down first okay and so
 

8189
02:28:19,439 --> 02:28:21,469
up some of them down first okay and so
we do in instead of one to 10 we do 10

8190
02:28:21,469 --> 02:28:21,479
we do in instead of one to 10 we do 10
 

8191
02:28:21,479 --> 02:28:23,630
we do in instead of one to 10 we do 10
down to one and so so I give them 10

8192
02:28:23,630 --> 02:28:23,640
down to one and so so I give them 10
 

8193
02:28:23,640 --> 02:28:26,269
down to one and so so I give them 10
nine at eight they start saying the word

8194
02:28:26,269 --> 02:28:26,279
nine at eight they start saying the word
 

8195
02:28:26,279 --> 02:28:28,309
nine at eight they start saying the word
for some and then down when you get to

8196
02:28:28,309 --> 02:28:28,319
for some and then down when you get to
 

8197
02:28:28,319 --> 02:28:31,190
for some and then down when you get to
four everyone is saying the word for few

8198
02:28:31,190 --> 02:28:31,200
four everyone is saying the word for few
 

8199
02:28:31,200 --> 02:28:32,870
four everyone is saying the word for few
which we thought was one so it's like

8200
02:28:32,870 --> 02:28:32,880
which we thought was one so it's like
 

8201
02:28:32,880 --> 02:28:35,830
which we thought was one so it's like
it's the context determined what word

8202
02:28:35,830 --> 02:28:35,840
it's the context determined what word
 

8203
02:28:35,840 --> 02:28:37,309
it's the context determined what word
what what what that quantifier they used

8204
02:28:37,309 --> 02:28:37,319
what what what that quantifier they used
 

8205
02:28:37,319 --> 02:28:39,349
what what what that quantifier they used
was so it's not a count word they're not

8206
02:28:39,349 --> 02:28:39,359
was so it's not a count word they're not
 

8207
02:28:39,359 --> 02:28:40,590
was so it's not a count word they're not
they're not count Words they're they're

8208
02:28:40,590 --> 02:28:40,600
they're not count Words they're they're
 

8209
02:28:40,600 --> 02:28:41,950
they're not count Words they're they're
just approximate words and they're going

8210
02:28:41,950 --> 02:28:41,960
just approximate words and they're going
 

8211
02:28:41,960 --> 02:28:43,670
just approximate words and they're going
to be nois when you interview a bunch of

8212
02:28:43,670 --> 02:28:43,680
to be nois when you interview a bunch of
 

8213
02:28:43,680 --> 02:28:45,590
to be nois when you interview a bunch of
people the what the definition of few

8214
02:28:45,590 --> 02:28:45,600
people the what the definition of few
 

8215
02:28:45,600 --> 02:28:46,830
people the what the definition of few
and there's going to be a threshold in

8216
02:28:46,830 --> 02:28:46,840
and there's going to be a threshold in
 

8217
02:28:46,840 --> 02:28:48,710
and there's going to be a threshold in
the context yeah yeah I don't know what

8218
02:28:48,710 --> 02:28:48,720
the context yeah yeah I don't know what
 

8219
02:28:48,720 --> 02:28:49,670
the context yeah yeah I don't know what
that means that's that's going to be

8220
02:28:49,670 --> 02:28:49,680
that means that's that's going to be
 

8221
02:28:49,680 --> 02:28:51,349
that means that's that's going to be
depending on context I think that's true

8222
02:28:51,349 --> 02:28:51,359
depending on context I think that's true
 

8223
02:28:51,359 --> 02:28:52,630
depending on context I think that's true
in English too right if you ask an

8224
02:28:52,630 --> 02:28:52,640
in English too right if you ask an
 

8225
02:28:52,640 --> 02:28:53,950
in English too right if you ask an
English person what a few is I mean

8226
02:28:53,950 --> 02:28:53,960
English person what a few is I mean
 

8227
02:28:53,960 --> 02:28:56,429
English person what a few is I mean
that's depend completely on the context

8228
02:28:56,429 --> 02:28:56,439
that's depend completely on the context
 

8229
02:28:56,439 --> 02:28:58,030
that's depend completely on the context
and it might actually be at first hard

8230
02:28:58,030 --> 02:28:58,040
and it might actually be at first hard
 

8231
02:28:58,040 --> 02:29:00,790
and it might actually be at first hard
to discover yeah cuz for a lot of people

8232
02:29:00,790 --> 02:29:00,800
to discover yeah cuz for a lot of people
 

8233
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:03,870
to discover yeah cuz for a lot of people
the jump from one to two will be few

8234
02:29:03,870 --> 02:29:03,880
the jump from one to two will be few
 

8235
02:29:03,880 --> 02:29:06,070
the jump from one to two will be few
right so it's a jump yeah it might be

8236
02:29:06,070 --> 02:29:06,080
right so it's a jump yeah it might be
 

8237
02:29:06,080 --> 02:29:07,910
right so it's a jump yeah it might be
still be there yeah like it's I mean

8238
02:29:07,910 --> 02:29:07,920
still be there yeah like it's I mean
 

8239
02:29:07,920 --> 02:29:09,870
still be there yeah like it's I mean
that's fascinating that's fascinating

8240
02:29:09,870 --> 02:29:09,880
that's fascinating that's fascinating
 

8241
02:29:09,880 --> 02:29:11,429
that's fascinating that's fascinating
that numbers don't present themselves

8242
02:29:11,429 --> 02:29:11,439
that numbers don't present themselves
 

8243
02:29:11,439 --> 02:29:12,910
that numbers don't present themselves
yeah so the words aren't there and then

8244
02:29:12,910 --> 02:29:12,920
yeah so the words aren't there and then
 

8245
02:29:12,920 --> 02:29:14,190
yeah so the words aren't there and then
and so then we do these other things

8246
02:29:14,190 --> 02:29:14,200
and so then we do these other things
 

8247
02:29:14,200 --> 02:29:17,309
and so then we do these other things
well if if they don't have the words can

8248
02:29:17,309 --> 02:29:17,319
well if if they don't have the words can
 

8249
02:29:17,319 --> 02:29:19,550
well if if they don't have the words can
they do exact matching kinds of tasks

8250
02:29:19,550 --> 02:29:19,560
they do exact matching kinds of tasks
 

8251
02:29:19,560 --> 02:29:22,630
they do exact matching kinds of tasks
can they even do those tasks and and and

8252
02:29:22,630 --> 02:29:22,640
can they even do those tasks and and and
 

8253
02:29:22,640 --> 02:29:25,309
can they even do those tasks and and and
the answer is sort of yes and no and so

8254
02:29:25,309 --> 02:29:25,319
the answer is sort of yes and no and so
 

8255
02:29:25,319 --> 02:29:27,590
the answer is sort of yes and no and so
yes they can do them so here's the tasks

8256
02:29:27,590 --> 02:29:27,600
yes they can do them so here's the tasks
 

8257
02:29:27,600 --> 02:29:29,349
yes they can do them so here's the tasks
that we did we we put out those spools

8258
02:29:29,349 --> 02:29:29,359
that we did we we put out those spools
 

8259
02:29:29,359 --> 02:29:31,429
that we did we we put out those spools
of thread again okay so put like three

8260
02:29:31,429 --> 02:29:31,439
of thread again okay so put like three
 

8261
02:29:31,439 --> 02:29:34,150
of thread again okay so put like three
out here and then um that we gave them

8262
02:29:34,150 --> 02:29:34,160
out here and then um that we gave them
 

8263
02:29:34,160 --> 02:29:36,150
out here and then um that we gave them
some objects and those happen to be

8264
02:29:36,150 --> 02:29:36,160
some objects and those happen to be
 

8265
02:29:36,160 --> 02:29:37,790
some objects and those happen to be
uninflated red balloons it doesn't

8266
02:29:37,790 --> 02:29:37,800
uninflated red balloons it doesn't
 

8267
02:29:37,800 --> 02:29:39,710
uninflated red balloons it doesn't
really matter what they are it's just a

8268
02:29:39,710 --> 02:29:39,720
really matter what they are it's just a
 

8269
02:29:39,720 --> 02:29:41,469
really matter what they are it's just a
bunch of exactly the same thing and it

8270
02:29:41,469 --> 02:29:41,479
bunch of exactly the same thing and it
 

8271
02:29:41,479 --> 02:29:44,349
bunch of exactly the same thing and it
was easy to put down right next to these

8272
02:29:44,349 --> 02:29:44,359
was easy to put down right next to these
 

8273
02:29:44,359 --> 02:29:47,429
was easy to put down right next to these
um um spools of thread okay and so then

8274
02:29:47,429 --> 02:29:47,439
um um spools of thread okay and so then
 

8275
02:29:47,439 --> 02:29:49,150
um um spools of thread okay and so then
I put out three of these and your task

8276
02:29:49,150 --> 02:29:49,160
I put out three of these and your task
 

8277
02:29:49,160 --> 02:29:51,469
I put out three of these and your task
was to just put one against each of my

8278
02:29:51,469 --> 02:29:51,479
was to just put one against each of my
 

8279
02:29:51,479 --> 02:29:53,710
was to just put one against each of my
three things and they could do that

8280
02:29:53,710 --> 02:29:53,720
three things and they could do that
 

8281
02:29:53,720 --> 02:29:55,070
three things and they could do that
perfectly so I mean I would actually do

8282
02:29:55,070 --> 02:29:55,080
perfectly so I mean I would actually do
 

8283
02:29:55,080 --> 02:29:56,830
perfectly so I mean I would actually do
that it was a very easy task to explain

8284
02:29:56,830 --> 02:29:56,840
that it was a very easy task to explain
 

8285
02:29:56,840 --> 02:29:58,710
that it was a very easy task to explain
to them because I have I did this with

8286
02:29:58,710 --> 02:29:58,720
to them because I have I did this with
 

8287
02:29:58,720 --> 02:30:01,389
to them because I have I did this with
this guy Mike Frank and he would be my I

8288
02:30:01,389 --> 02:30:01,399
this guy Mike Frank and he would be my I
 

8289
02:30:01,399 --> 02:30:02,950
this guy Mike Frank and he would be my I
I'd be the experimentor telling him to

8290
02:30:02,950 --> 02:30:02,960
I'd be the experimentor telling him to
 

8291
02:30:02,960 --> 02:30:04,790
I'd be the experimentor telling him to
do this and showing him to do this and

8292
02:30:04,790 --> 02:30:04,800
do this and showing him to do this and
 

8293
02:30:04,800 --> 02:30:06,110
do this and showing him to do this and
then we just like just do what he did

8294
02:30:06,110 --> 02:30:06,120
then we just like just do what he did
 

8295
02:30:06,120 --> 02:30:07,830
then we just like just do what he did
you know copy him all we had to I didn't

8296
02:30:07,830 --> 02:30:07,840
you know copy him all we had to I didn't
 

8297
02:30:07,840 --> 02:30:10,110
you know copy him all we had to I didn't
have to speak P except for know what

8298
02:30:10,110 --> 02:30:10,120
have to speak P except for know what
 

8299
02:30:10,120 --> 02:30:12,309
have to speak P except for know what
copy him like do what he did is like all

8300
02:30:12,309 --> 02:30:12,319
copy him like do what he did is like all
 

8301
02:30:12,319 --> 02:30:14,269
copy him like do what he did is like all
we had to be able to say and and then

8302
02:30:14,269 --> 02:30:14,279
we had to be able to say and and then
 

8303
02:30:14,279 --> 02:30:15,790
we had to be able to say and and then
they would do that just perfectly and

8304
02:30:15,790 --> 02:30:15,800
they would do that just perfectly and
 

8305
02:30:15,800 --> 02:30:17,670
they would do that just perfectly and
and so we'd move it up we'd do some sort

8306
02:30:17,670 --> 02:30:17,680
and so we'd move it up we'd do some sort
 

8307
02:30:17,680 --> 02:30:20,389
and so we'd move it up we'd do some sort
of random number of items up to 10 and

8308
02:30:20,389 --> 02:30:20,399
of random number of items up to 10 and
 

8309
02:30:20,399 --> 02:30:22,710
of random number of items up to 10 and
they basically do perfectly on that they

8310
02:30:22,710 --> 02:30:22,720
they basically do perfectly on that they
 

8311
02:30:22,720 --> 02:30:24,150
they basically do perfectly on that they
never get that wrong I mean that's not a

8312
02:30:24,150 --> 02:30:24,160
never get that wrong I mean that's not a
 

8313
02:30:24,160 --> 02:30:26,230
never get that wrong I mean that's not a
counting task right that is just a match

8314
02:30:26,230 --> 02:30:26,240
counting task right that is just a match
 

8315
02:30:26,240 --> 02:30:27,790
counting task right that is just a match
you just put one against doesn't matter

8316
02:30:27,790 --> 02:30:27,800
you just put one against doesn't matter
 

8317
02:30:27,800 --> 02:30:29,070
you just put one against doesn't matter
how I don't need to know how many there

8318
02:30:29,070 --> 02:30:29,080
how I don't need to know how many there
 

8319
02:30:29,080 --> 02:30:31,550
how I don't need to know how many there
are there to do that correctly and and

8320
02:30:31,550 --> 02:30:31,560
are there to do that correctly and and
 

8321
02:30:31,560 --> 02:30:33,630
are there to do that correctly and and
they would make mistakes but very very

8322
02:30:33,630 --> 02:30:33,640
they would make mistakes but very very
 

8323
02:30:33,640 --> 02:30:37,429
they would make mistakes but very very
few and no more than MIT undergrads just

8324
02:30:37,429 --> 02:30:37,439
few and no more than MIT undergrads just
 

8325
02:30:37,439 --> 02:30:39,389
few and no more than MIT undergrads just
GNA say like there there's no these are

8326
02:30:39,389 --> 02:30:39,399
GNA say like there there's no these are
 

8327
02:30:39,399 --> 02:30:41,349
GNA say like there there's no these are
low stakes so you know you make mistakes

8328
02:30:41,349 --> 02:30:41,359
low stakes so you know you make mistakes
 

8329
02:30:41,359 --> 02:30:42,830
low stakes so you know you make mistakes
counting is not required to complete the

8330
02:30:42,830 --> 02:30:42,840
counting is not required to complete the
 

8331
02:30:42,840 --> 02:30:44,510
counting is not required to complete the
matching test that's right no not at all

8332
02:30:44,510 --> 02:30:44,520
matching test that's right no not at all
 

8333
02:30:44,520 --> 02:30:46,269
matching test that's right no not at all
okay and so and and so that's our

8334
02:30:46,269 --> 02:30:46,279
okay and so and and so that's our
 

8335
02:30:46,279 --> 02:30:48,590
okay and so and and so that's our
control and this guy a guy had gone down

8336
02:30:48,590 --> 02:30:48,600
control and this guy a guy had gone down
 

8337
02:30:48,600 --> 02:30:50,190
control and this guy a guy had gone down
there before and said that they couldn't

8338
02:30:50,190 --> 02:30:50,200
there before and said that they couldn't
 

8339
02:30:50,200 --> 02:30:51,590
there before and said that they couldn't
do this task but I just don't know what

8340
02:30:51,590 --> 02:30:51,600
do this task but I just don't know what
 

8341
02:30:51,600 --> 02:30:53,389
do this task but I just don't know what
he did wrong there cuz they can do this

8342
02:30:53,389 --> 02:30:53,399
he did wrong there cuz they can do this
 

8343
02:30:53,399 --> 02:30:55,830
he did wrong there cuz they can do this
task perfectly well and you know I can

8344
02:30:55,830 --> 02:30:55,840
task perfectly well and you know I can
 

8345
02:30:55,840 --> 02:30:57,389
task perfectly well and you know I can
can train my dog to do this task so of

8346
02:30:57,389 --> 02:30:57,399
can train my dog to do this task so of
 

8347
02:30:57,399 --> 02:30:59,110
can train my dog to do this task so of
course they can do this task and so you

8348
02:30:59,110 --> 02:30:59,120
course they can do this task and so you
 

8349
02:30:59,120 --> 02:31:01,150
course they can do this task and so you
know it's not a hard task but the other

8350
02:31:01,150 --> 02:31:01,160
know it's not a hard task but the other
 

8351
02:31:01,160 --> 02:31:03,389
know it's not a hard task but the other
task that was sort of more interesting

8352
02:31:03,389 --> 02:31:03,399
task that was sort of more interesting
 

8353
02:31:03,399 --> 02:31:04,950
task that was sort of more interesting
is like so then we do a bunch of tasks

8354
02:31:04,950 --> 02:31:04,960
is like so then we do a bunch of tasks
 

8355
02:31:04,960 --> 02:31:09,550
is like so then we do a bunch of tasks
where you need um some way to encode the

8356
02:31:09,550 --> 02:31:09,560
where you need um some way to encode the
 

8357
02:31:09,560 --> 02:31:12,510
where you need um some way to encode the
set so like one one of them is just a I

8358
02:31:12,510 --> 02:31:12,520
set so like one one of them is just a I
 

8359
02:31:12,520 --> 02:31:17,230
set so like one one of them is just a I
I just put a a um uh opaque sheet in

8360
02:31:17,230 --> 02:31:17,240
I just put a a um uh opaque sheet in
 

8361
02:31:17,240 --> 02:31:18,910
I just put a a um uh opaque sheet in
front of the of the things I put down a

8362
02:31:18,910 --> 02:31:18,920
front of the of the things I put down a
 

8363
02:31:18,920 --> 02:31:20,469
front of the of the things I put down a
bunch a set of these things and I put no

8364
02:31:20,469 --> 02:31:20,479
bunch a set of these things and I put no
 

8365
02:31:20,479 --> 02:31:22,550
bunch a set of these things and I put no
Pig sheet down and so you can't see them

8366
02:31:22,550 --> 02:31:22,560
Pig sheet down and so you can't see them
 

8367
02:31:22,560 --> 02:31:24,750
Pig sheet down and so you can't see them
anymore and I tell you do the same thing

8368
02:31:24,750 --> 02:31:24,760
anymore and I tell you do the same thing
 

8369
02:31:24,760 --> 02:31:26,309
anymore and I tell you do the same thing
you were doing before right you know

8370
02:31:26,309 --> 02:31:26,319
you were doing before right you know
 

8371
02:31:26,319 --> 02:31:27,950
you were doing before right you know
it's easy if it's two or three it's very

8372
02:31:27,950 --> 02:31:27,960
it's easy if it's two or three it's very
 

8373
02:31:27,960 --> 02:31:29,670
it's easy if it's two or three it's very
easy but if I don't have the words for

8374
02:31:29,670 --> 02:31:29,680
easy but if I don't have the words for
 

8375
02:31:29,680 --> 02:31:33,190
easy but if I don't have the words for
eight it's a little harder like maybe

8376
02:31:33,190 --> 02:31:33,200
eight it's a little harder like maybe
 

8377
02:31:33,200 --> 02:31:35,349
eight it's a little harder like maybe
you know with practice wa well

8378
02:31:35,349 --> 02:31:35,359
you know with practice wa well
 

8379
02:31:35,359 --> 02:31:37,590
you know with practice wa well
no because you have to count for us for

8380
02:31:37,590 --> 02:31:37,600
no because you have to count for us for
 

8381
02:31:37,600 --> 02:31:39,230
no because you have to count for us for
us it's easy because we just we just

8382
02:31:39,230 --> 02:31:39,240
us it's easy because we just we just
 

8383
02:31:39,240 --> 02:31:41,110
us it's easy because we just we just
count them it's just so easy to count

8384
02:31:41,110 --> 02:31:41,120
count them it's just so easy to count
 

8385
02:31:41,120 --> 02:31:43,230
count them it's just so easy to count
them but but they don't they can't count

8386
02:31:43,230 --> 02:31:43,240
them but but they don't they can't count
 

8387
02:31:43,240 --> 02:31:44,389
them but but they don't they can't count
them because they don't count they don't

8388
02:31:44,389 --> 02:31:44,399
them because they don't count they don't
 

8389
02:31:44,399 --> 02:31:45,990
them because they don't count they don't
have words for this thing and so they

8390
02:31:45,990 --> 02:31:46,000
have words for this thing and so they
 

8391
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:47,429
have words for this thing and so they
would do approximate it's totally

8392
02:31:47,429 --> 02:31:47,439
would do approximate it's totally
 

8393
02:31:47,439 --> 02:31:48,830
would do approximate it's totally
fascinating so they would get them

8394
02:31:48,830 --> 02:31:48,840
fascinating so they would get them
 

8395
02:31:48,840 --> 02:31:50,630
fascinating so they would get them
approximately right uh you know uh you

8396
02:31:50,630 --> 02:31:50,640
approximately right uh you know uh you
 

8397
02:31:50,640 --> 02:31:53,230
approximately right uh you know uh you
know after four or five you know because

8398
02:31:53,230 --> 02:31:53,240
know after four or five you know because
 

8399
02:31:53,240 --> 02:31:55,110
know after four or five you know because
you can basically you always get four

8400
02:31:55,110 --> 02:31:55,120
you can basically you always get four
 

8401
02:31:55,120 --> 02:31:57,510
you can basically you always get four
right three or four that looks that's

8402
02:31:57,510 --> 02:31:57,520
right three or four that looks that's
 

8403
02:31:57,520 --> 02:31:59,950
right three or four that looks that's
something we can visually see but but

8404
02:31:59,950 --> 02:31:59,960
something we can visually see but but
 

8405
02:31:59,960 --> 02:32:01,590
something we can visually see but but
after that you kind of have it's

8406
02:32:01,590 --> 02:32:01,600
after that you kind of have it's
 

8407
02:32:01,600 --> 02:32:03,070
after that you kind of have it's
approximate number and so then and

8408
02:32:03,070 --> 02:32:03,080
approximate number and so then and
 

8409
02:32:03,080 --> 02:32:04,309
approximate number and so then and
there's a bunch of tasks we did and they

8410
02:32:04,309 --> 02:32:04,319
there's a bunch of tasks we did and they
 

8411
02:32:04,319 --> 02:32:07,590
there's a bunch of tasks we did and they
all failed as I mean failed they did

8412
02:32:07,590 --> 02:32:07,600
all failed as I mean failed they did
 

8413
02:32:07,600 --> 02:32:10,150
all failed as I mean failed they did
approximate after five on all those

8414
02:32:10,150 --> 02:32:10,160
approximate after five on all those
 

8415
02:32:10,160 --> 02:32:12,510
approximate after five on all those
tasks and it kind of shows that the

8416
02:32:12,510 --> 02:32:12,520
tasks and it kind of shows that the
 

8417
02:32:12,520 --> 02:32:15,190
tasks and it kind of shows that the
words uh you kind of need the words you

8418
02:32:15,190 --> 02:32:15,200
words uh you kind of need the words you
 

8419
02:32:15,200 --> 02:32:16,990
words uh you kind of need the words you
know to be able to do these these kinds

8420
02:32:16,990 --> 02:32:17,000
know to be able to do these these kinds
 

8421
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:18,269
know to be able to do these these kinds
of tasks there's a little bit of a

8422
02:32:18,269 --> 02:32:18,279
of tasks there's a little bit of a
 

8423
02:32:18,279 --> 02:32:20,670
of tasks there's a little bit of a
chicken and egg thing there because if

8424
02:32:20,670 --> 02:32:20,680
chicken and egg thing there because if
 

8425
02:32:20,680 --> 02:32:21,830
chicken and egg thing there because if
you don't have the

8426
02:32:21,830 --> 02:32:21,840
you don't have the
 

8427
02:32:21,840 --> 02:32:24,710
you don't have the
words then maybe they'll limit you in

8428
02:32:24,710 --> 02:32:24,720
words then maybe they'll limit you in
 

8429
02:32:24,720 --> 02:32:27,790
words then maybe they'll limit you in
the kind of like a little baby Einstein

8430
02:32:27,790 --> 02:32:27,800
the kind of like a little baby Einstein
 

8431
02:32:27,800 --> 02:32:30,230
the kind of like a little baby Einstein
there won't be able to come up with a

8432
02:32:30,230 --> 02:32:30,240
there won't be able to come up with a
 

8433
02:32:30,240 --> 02:32:32,349
there won't be able to come up with a
counting task you know what I mean like

8434
02:32:32,349 --> 02:32:32,359
counting task you know what I mean like
 

8435
02:32:32,359 --> 02:32:34,750
counting task you know what I mean like
uh the ability to count enables you to

8436
02:32:34,750 --> 02:32:34,760
uh the ability to count enables you to
 

8437
02:32:34,760 --> 02:32:37,030
uh the ability to count enables you to
come up with interesting things probably

8438
02:32:37,030 --> 02:32:37,040
come up with interesting things probably
 

8439
02:32:37,040 --> 02:32:40,469
come up with interesting things probably
mhm so yes you develop counting because

8440
02:32:40,469 --> 02:32:40,479
mhm so yes you develop counting because
 

8441
02:32:40,479 --> 02:32:42,230
mhm so yes you develop counting because
you need it but then once you have

8442
02:32:42,230 --> 02:32:42,240
you need it but then once you have
 

8443
02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:44,710
you need it but then once you have
counting you can probably come up with a

8444
02:32:44,710 --> 02:32:44,720
counting you can probably come up with a
 

8445
02:32:44,720 --> 02:32:46,830
counting you can probably come up with a
bunch of different inventions MH like

8446
02:32:46,830 --> 02:32:46,840
bunch of different inventions MH like
 

8447
02:32:46,840 --> 02:32:48,550
bunch of different inventions MH like
how to I don't

8448
02:32:48,550 --> 02:32:48,560
how to I don't
 

8449
02:32:48,560 --> 02:32:51,389
how to I don't
know what kind of thing they do matching

8450
02:32:51,389 --> 02:32:51,399
know what kind of thing they do matching
 

8451
02:32:51,399 --> 02:32:53,230
know what kind of thing they do matching
really well for building purposes

8452
02:32:53,230 --> 02:32:53,240
really well for building purposes
 

8453
02:32:53,240 --> 02:32:55,429
really well for building purposes
building some kind of Hut or something

8454
02:32:55,429 --> 02:32:55,439
building some kind of Hut or something
 

8455
02:32:55,439 --> 02:32:58,070
building some kind of Hut or something
like this mhm so it's interesting that

8456
02:32:58,070 --> 02:32:58,080
like this mhm so it's interesting that
 

8457
02:32:58,080 --> 02:33:01,070
like this mhm so it's interesting that
language is um a limiter on what you're

8458
02:33:01,070 --> 02:33:01,080
language is um a limiter on what you're
 

8459
02:33:01,080 --> 02:33:03,429
language is um a limiter on what you're
able to do yeah here language is just is

8460
02:33:03,429 --> 02:33:03,439
able to do yeah here language is just is
 

8461
02:33:03,439 --> 02:33:05,349
able to do yeah here language is just is
the words here is the words like the

8462
02:33:05,349 --> 02:33:05,359
the words here is the words like the
 

8463
02:33:05,359 --> 02:33:09,070
the words here is the words like the
words for exact count is the limiting

8464
02:33:09,070 --> 02:33:09,080
words for exact count is the limiting
 

8465
02:33:09,080 --> 02:33:11,070
words for exact count is the limiting
factor here they just don't have them

8466
02:33:11,070 --> 02:33:11,080
factor here they just don't have them
 

8467
02:33:11,080 --> 02:33:12,550
factor here they just don't have them
yeah in this yeah well that that's what

8468
02:33:12,550 --> 02:33:12,560
yeah in this yeah well that that's what
 

8469
02:33:12,560 --> 02:33:16,710
yeah in this yeah well that that's what
I mean the LI that limit is also a limit

8470
02:33:16,710 --> 02:33:16,720
I mean the LI that limit is also a limit
 

8471
02:33:16,720 --> 02:33:18,309
I mean the LI that limit is also a limit
on the Society of what they're able to

8472
02:33:18,309 --> 02:33:18,319
on the Society of what they're able to
 

8473
02:33:18,319 --> 02:33:20,790
on the Society of what they're able to
build that's going to be true yeah so

8474
02:33:20,790 --> 02:33:20,800
build that's going to be true yeah so
 

8475
02:33:20,800 --> 02:33:23,190
build that's going to be true yeah so
it's proba I mean we don't know this is

8476
02:33:23,190 --> 02:33:23,200
it's proba I mean we don't know this is
 

8477
02:33:23,200 --> 02:33:24,790
it's proba I mean we don't know this is
one of those problems with the snapshot

8478
02:33:24,790 --> 02:33:24,800
one of those problems with the snapshot
 

8479
02:33:24,800 --> 02:33:26,630
one of those problems with the snapshot
of just current languages is that we

8480
02:33:26,630 --> 02:33:26,640
of just current languages is that we
 

8481
02:33:26,640 --> 02:33:29,309
of just current languages is that we
don't know what causes a culture to

8482
02:33:29,309 --> 02:33:29,319
don't know what causes a culture to
 

8483
02:33:29,319 --> 02:33:32,269
don't know what causes a culture to
discover SL invent accounting system but

8484
02:33:32,269 --> 02:33:32,279
discover SL invent accounting system but
 

8485
02:33:32,279 --> 02:33:34,150
discover SL invent accounting system but
the hypothesis is the guess out there is

8486
02:33:34,150 --> 02:33:34,160
the hypothesis is the guess out there is
 

8487
02:33:34,160 --> 02:33:36,190
the hypothesis is the guess out there is
something to do with farming so if you

8488
02:33:36,190 --> 02:33:36,200
something to do with farming so if you
 

8489
02:33:36,200 --> 02:33:39,349
something to do with farming so if you
have a bunch of goats and uh you want to

8490
02:33:39,349 --> 02:33:39,359
have a bunch of goats and uh you want to
 

8491
02:33:39,359 --> 02:33:41,830
have a bunch of goats and uh you want to
keep track of them and you say have 17

8492
02:33:41,830 --> 02:33:41,840
keep track of them and you say have 17
 

8493
02:33:41,840 --> 02:33:43,349
keep track of them and you say have 17
goats and you go to bed at night and you

8494
02:33:43,349 --> 02:33:43,359
goats and you go to bed at night and you
 

8495
02:33:43,359 --> 02:33:45,950
goats and you go to bed at night and you
get up in the morning boy it's easier to

8496
02:33:45,950 --> 02:33:45,960
get up in the morning boy it's easier to
 

8497
02:33:45,960 --> 02:33:47,670
get up in the morning boy it's easier to
have a count system to do that you know

8498
02:33:47,670 --> 02:33:47,680
have a count system to do that you know
 

8499
02:33:47,680 --> 02:33:49,790
have a count system to do that you know
if I have that's an abstract abstraction

8500
02:33:49,790 --> 02:33:49,800
if I have that's an abstract abstraction
 

8501
02:33:49,800 --> 02:33:52,630
if I have that's an abstract abstraction
over said so I don't have like people

8502
02:33:52,630 --> 02:33:52,640
over said so I don't have like people
 

8503
02:33:52,640 --> 02:33:53,990
over said so I don't have like people
often ask me when I talk to tell them

8504
02:33:53,990 --> 02:33:54,000
often ask me when I talk to tell them
 

8505
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:55,309
often ask me when I talk to tell them
about this kind of work they say well

8506
02:33:55,309 --> 02:33:55,319
about this kind of work they say well
 

8507
02:33:55,319 --> 02:33:56,950
about this kind of work they say well
don't these pahan don't they have kids

8508
02:33:56,950 --> 02:33:56,960
don't these pahan don't they have kids
 

8509
02:33:56,960 --> 02:33:57,990
don't these pahan don't they have kids
don't they have a lot of children I'm

8510
02:33:57,990 --> 02:33:58,000
don't they have a lot of children I'm
 

8511
02:33:58,000 --> 02:33:59,389
don't they have a lot of children I'm
like yeah they have a lot of children

8512
02:33:59,389 --> 02:33:59,399
like yeah they have a lot of children
 

8513
02:33:59,399 --> 02:34:00,910
like yeah they have a lot of children
and they do they they often have

8514
02:34:00,910 --> 02:34:00,920
and they do they they often have
 

8515
02:34:00,920 --> 02:34:02,750
and they do they they often have
families of three or four or five kids

8516
02:34:02,750 --> 02:34:02,760
families of three or four or five kids
 

8517
02:34:02,760 --> 02:34:04,070
families of three or four or five kids
and like well don't they need the

8518
02:34:04,070 --> 02:34:04,080
and like well don't they need the
 

8519
02:34:04,080 --> 02:34:05,670
and like well don't they need the
numbers to keep track of their kids and

8520
02:34:05,670 --> 02:34:05,680
numbers to keep track of their kids and
 

8521
02:34:05,680 --> 02:34:07,389
numbers to keep track of their kids and
and I always ask the person who says

8522
02:34:07,389 --> 02:34:07,399
and I always ask the person who says
 

8523
02:34:07,399 --> 02:34:09,950
and I always ask the person who says
this like do you have children and the

8524
02:34:09,950 --> 02:34:09,960
this like do you have children and the
 

8525
02:34:09,960 --> 02:34:11,429
this like do you have children and the
answer is always no because that's not

8526
02:34:11,429 --> 02:34:11,439
answer is always no because that's not
 

8527
02:34:11,439 --> 02:34:13,750
answer is always no because that's not
how you keep track of your kids you you

8528
02:34:13,750 --> 02:34:13,760
how you keep track of your kids you you
 

8529
02:34:13,760 --> 02:34:15,550
how you keep track of your kids you you
care about their identities it's very

8530
02:34:15,550 --> 02:34:15,560
care about their identities it's very
 

8531
02:34:15,560 --> 02:34:17,469
care about their identities it's very
important to me when I go I think I have

8532
02:34:17,469 --> 02:34:17,479
important to me when I go I think I have
 

8533
02:34:17,479 --> 02:34:20,590
important to me when I go I think I have
five children it's it's doesn't matter

8534
02:34:20,590 --> 02:34:20,600
five children it's it's doesn't matter
 

8535
02:34:20,600 --> 02:34:23,070
five children it's it's doesn't matter
which yeah doesn't it matters which five

8536
02:34:23,070 --> 02:34:23,080
which yeah doesn't it matters which five
 

8537
02:34:23,080 --> 02:34:25,030
which yeah doesn't it matters which five
it's like if you replaced one with

8538
02:34:25,030 --> 02:34:25,040
it's like if you replaced one with
 

8539
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:27,469
it's like if you replaced one with
someone else I would I would care a goat

8540
02:34:27,469 --> 02:34:27,479
someone else I would I would care a goat
 

8541
02:34:27,479 --> 02:34:29,030
someone else I would I would care a goat
maybe not right that's the kind of point

8542
02:34:29,030 --> 02:34:29,040
maybe not right that's the kind of point
 

8543
02:34:29,040 --> 02:34:31,030
maybe not right that's the kind of point
it's an abstraction something that looks

8544
02:34:31,030 --> 02:34:31,040
it's an abstraction something that looks
 

8545
02:34:31,040 --> 02:34:32,550
it's an abstraction something that looks
very similar to the one wouldn't matter

8546
02:34:32,550 --> 02:34:32,560
very similar to the one wouldn't matter
 

8547
02:34:32,560 --> 02:34:34,950
very similar to the one wouldn't matter
to me probably but if you care about

8548
02:34:34,950 --> 02:34:34,960
to me probably but if you care about
 

8549
02:34:34,960 --> 02:34:36,870
to me probably but if you care about
goats you're going to know them actually

8550
02:34:36,870 --> 02:34:36,880
goats you're going to know them actually
 

8551
02:34:36,880 --> 02:34:38,550
goats you're going to know them actually
individually also yeah you will I mean

8552
02:34:38,550 --> 02:34:38,560
individually also yeah you will I mean
 

8553
02:34:38,560 --> 02:34:40,550
individually also yeah you will I mean
cows goats if it's a source of food and

8554
02:34:40,550 --> 02:34:40,560
cows goats if it's a source of food and
 

8555
02:34:40,560 --> 02:34:42,429
cows goats if it's a source of food and
milk and all that kind of stuff you're

8556
02:34:42,429 --> 02:34:42,439
milk and all that kind of stuff you're
 

8557
02:34:42,439 --> 02:34:43,830
milk and all that kind of stuff you're
absolutely right but but I'm saying it

8558
02:34:43,830 --> 02:34:43,840
absolutely right but but I'm saying it
 

8559
02:34:43,840 --> 02:34:45,429
absolutely right but but I'm saying it
is an abstraction such that you don't

8560
02:34:45,429 --> 02:34:45,439
is an abstraction such that you don't
 

8561
02:34:45,439 --> 02:34:47,309
is an abstraction such that you don't
have to care about their identities to

8562
02:34:47,309 --> 02:34:47,319
have to care about their identities to
 

8563
02:34:47,319 --> 02:34:48,830
have to care about their identities to
do this thing fast that's that's the

8564
02:34:48,830 --> 02:34:48,840
do this thing fast that's that's the
 

8565
02:34:48,840 --> 02:34:51,110
do this thing fast that's that's the
hypothesis not m

8566
02:34:51,110 --> 02:34:51,120
hypothesis not m
 

8567
02:34:51,120 --> 02:34:52,910
hypothesis not m
from Anthropologist is are guessing

8568
02:34:52,910 --> 02:34:52,920
from Anthropologist is are guessing
 

8569
02:34:52,920 --> 02:34:55,150
from Anthropologist is are guessing
about where words for counting came from

8570
02:34:55,150 --> 02:34:55,160
about where words for counting came from
 

8571
02:34:55,160 --> 02:34:59,230
about where words for counting came from
is from farming maybe any yeah uh do you

8572
02:34:59,230 --> 02:34:59,240
is from farming maybe any yeah uh do you
 

8573
02:34:59,240 --> 02:35:00,910
is from farming maybe any yeah uh do you
have a sense why Universal languages

8574
02:35:00,910 --> 02:35:00,920
have a sense why Universal languages
 

8575
02:35:00,920 --> 02:35:03,190
have a sense why Universal languages
like espiranto have not taken

8576
02:35:03,190 --> 02:35:03,200
like espiranto have not taken
 

8577
02:35:03,200 --> 02:35:06,630
like espiranto have not taken
off um like why do we have all these

8578
02:35:06,630 --> 02:35:06,640
off um like why do we have all these
 

8579
02:35:06,640 --> 02:35:08,429
off um like why do we have all these
different languages yeah yeah well my

8580
02:35:08,429 --> 02:35:08,439
different languages yeah yeah well my
 

8581
02:35:08,439 --> 02:35:09,429
different languages yeah yeah well my
guess

8582
02:35:09,429 --> 02:35:09,439
guess
 

8583
02:35:09,439 --> 02:35:12,070
guess
is the the function of a language is to

8584
02:35:12,070 --> 02:35:12,080
is the the function of a language is to
 

8585
02:35:12,080 --> 02:35:14,510
is the the function of a language is to
do something in a community and and uh I

8586
02:35:14,510 --> 02:35:14,520
do something in a community and and uh I
 

8587
02:35:14,520 --> 02:35:15,950
do something in a community and and uh I
mean unless there's some function to

8588
02:35:15,950 --> 02:35:15,960
mean unless there's some function to
 

8589
02:35:15,960 --> 02:35:18,070
mean unless there's some function to
that language in the community it's it's

8590
02:35:18,070 --> 02:35:18,080
that language in the community it's it's
 

8591
02:35:18,080 --> 02:35:19,309
that language in the community it's it's
not going to survive it's not going to

8592
02:35:19,309 --> 02:35:19,319
not going to survive it's not going to
 

8593
02:35:19,319 --> 02:35:22,030
not going to survive it's not going to
be use so here's a great example so what

8594
02:35:22,030 --> 02:35:22,040
be use so here's a great example so what
 

8595
02:35:22,040 --> 02:35:25,630
be use so here's a great example so what
like language death is super common okay

8596
02:35:25,630 --> 02:35:25,640
like language death is super common okay
 

8597
02:35:25,640 --> 02:35:27,910
like language death is super common okay
languages are dying all around the world

8598
02:35:27,910 --> 02:35:27,920
languages are dying all around the world
 

8599
02:35:27,920 --> 02:35:29,590
languages are dying all around the world
and here's how here's why they're dying

8600
02:35:29,590 --> 02:35:29,600
and here's how here's why they're dying
 

8601
02:35:29,600 --> 02:35:31,550
and here's how here's why they're dying
and it's like yeah I see this in you

8602
02:35:31,550 --> 02:35:31,560
and it's like yeah I see this in you
 

8603
02:35:31,560 --> 02:35:33,349
and it's like yeah I see this in you
know in it's not happening right now in

8604
02:35:33,349 --> 02:35:33,359
know in it's not happening right now in
 

8605
02:35:33,359 --> 02:35:35,590
know in it's not happening right now in
either the chiman or the or the Pan but

8606
02:35:35,590 --> 02:35:35,600
either the chiman or the or the Pan but
 

8607
02:35:35,600 --> 02:35:37,269
either the chiman or the or the Pan but
it probably will and so there's a

8608
02:35:37,269 --> 02:35:37,279
it probably will and so there's a
 

8609
02:35:37,279 --> 02:35:40,030
it probably will and so there's a
neighboring group called mosan which is

8610
02:35:40,030 --> 02:35:40,040
neighboring group called mosan which is
 

8611
02:35:40,040 --> 02:35:43,349
neighboring group called mosan which is
I I I I said that it's a Isola actually

8612
02:35:43,349 --> 02:35:43,359
I I I I said that it's a Isola actually
 

8613
02:35:43,359 --> 02:35:44,990
I I I I said that it's a Isola actually
there's a duel there's two of them okay

8614
02:35:44,990 --> 02:35:45,000
there's a duel there's two of them okay
 

8615
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:46,429
there's a duel there's two of them okay
so it's actually there's two languages

8616
02:35:46,429 --> 02:35:46,439
so it's actually there's two languages
 

8617
02:35:46,439 --> 02:35:47,790
so it's actually there's two languages
which are really close which are most

8618
02:35:47,790 --> 02:35:47,800
which are really close which are most
 

8619
02:35:47,800 --> 02:35:51,469
which are really close which are most
ofon and um and chimane which are

8620
02:35:51,469 --> 02:35:51,479
ofon and um and chimane which are
 

8621
02:35:51,479 --> 02:35:53,590
ofon and um and chimane which are
unrelated to anything else and mosan is

8622
02:35:53,590 --> 02:35:53,600
unrelated to anything else and mosan is
 

8623
02:35:53,600 --> 02:35:55,870
unrelated to anything else and mosan is
unlike chimane in that it has a lot of

8624
02:35:55,870 --> 02:35:55,880
unlike chimane in that it has a lot of
 

8625
02:35:55,880 --> 02:35:58,710
unlike chimane in that it has a lot of
contact with Spanish and it's dying so

8626
02:35:58,710 --> 02:35:58,720
contact with Spanish and it's dying so
 

8627
02:35:58,720 --> 02:36:00,190
contact with Spanish and it's dying so
that language is dying the reason it's

8628
02:36:00,190 --> 02:36:00,200
that language is dying the reason it's
 

8629
02:36:00,200 --> 02:36:03,349
that language is dying the reason it's
dying is there's not a lot of value for

8630
02:36:03,349 --> 02:36:03,359
dying is there's not a lot of value for
 

8631
02:36:03,359 --> 02:36:06,110
dying is there's not a lot of value for
the local people in their native

8632
02:36:06,110 --> 02:36:06,120
the local people in their native
 

8633
02:36:06,120 --> 02:36:07,790
the local people in their native
language so there's much more value in

8634
02:36:07,790 --> 02:36:07,800
language so there's much more value in
 

8635
02:36:07,800 --> 02:36:09,750
language so there's much more value in
knowing Spanish like because they want

8636
02:36:09,750 --> 02:36:09,760
knowing Spanish like because they want
 

8637
02:36:09,760 --> 02:36:12,030
knowing Spanish like because they want
to feed their families and how do you

8638
02:36:12,030 --> 02:36:12,040
to feed their families and how do you
 

8639
02:36:12,040 --> 02:36:13,830
to feed their families and how do you
feed your family you learn Spanish so

8640
02:36:13,830 --> 02:36:13,840
feed your family you learn Spanish so
 

8641
02:36:13,840 --> 02:36:15,750
feed your family you learn Spanish so
you can make money so you can get a job

8642
02:36:15,750 --> 02:36:15,760
you can make money so you can get a job
 

8643
02:36:15,760 --> 02:36:17,429
you can make money so you can get a job
and do these things and then you can and

8644
02:36:17,429 --> 02:36:17,439
and do these things and then you can and
 

8645
02:36:17,439 --> 02:36:19,070
and do these things and then you can and
then you make money and so they want

8646
02:36:19,070 --> 02:36:19,080
then you make money and so they want
 

8647
02:36:19,080 --> 02:36:21,030
then you make money and so they want
Spanish things they want and so so most

8648
02:36:21,030 --> 02:36:21,040
Spanish things they want and so so most
 

8649
02:36:21,040 --> 02:36:23,950
Spanish things they want and so so most
ofan is D is in danger and is dying and

8650
02:36:23,950 --> 02:36:23,960
ofan is D is in danger and is dying and
 

8651
02:36:23,960 --> 02:36:26,110
ofan is D is in danger and is dying and
that's normal and so basically the

8652
02:36:26,110 --> 02:36:26,120
that's normal and so basically the
 

8653
02:36:26,120 --> 02:36:27,469
that's normal and so basically the
problem is that

8654
02:36:27,469 --> 02:36:27,479
problem is that
 

8655
02:36:27,479 --> 02:36:30,150
problem is that
people the reason we learn language is

8656
02:36:30,150 --> 02:36:30,160
people the reason we learn language is
 

8657
02:36:30,160 --> 02:36:31,150
people the reason we learn language is
to

8658
02:36:31,150 --> 02:36:31,160
to
 

8659
02:36:31,160 --> 02:36:34,150
to
communicate and we need to we use it to

8660
02:36:34,150 --> 02:36:34,160
communicate and we need to we use it to
 

8661
02:36:34,160 --> 02:36:36,349
communicate and we need to we use it to
to make money and to do whatever it is

8662
02:36:36,349 --> 02:36:36,359
to make money and to do whatever it is
 

8663
02:36:36,359 --> 02:36:38,790
to make money and to do whatever it is
to to feed our families and if that's

8664
02:36:38,790 --> 02:36:38,800
to to feed our families and if that's
 

8665
02:36:38,800 --> 02:36:39,630
to to feed our families and if that's
not

8666
02:36:39,630 --> 02:36:39,640
not
 

8667
02:36:39,640 --> 02:36:42,830
not
happening uh then it won't take off it's

8668
02:36:42,830 --> 02:36:42,840
happening uh then it won't take off it's
 

8669
02:36:42,840 --> 02:36:44,870
happening uh then it won't take off it's
not like a game or something this is

8670
02:36:44,870 --> 02:36:44,880
not like a game or something this is
 

8671
02:36:44,880 --> 02:36:46,429
not like a game or something this is
like something we you like why is

8672
02:36:46,429 --> 02:36:46,439
like something we you like why is
 

8673
02:36:46,439 --> 02:36:48,349
like something we you like why is
English so popular it's it's not because

8674
02:36:48,349 --> 02:36:48,359
English so popular it's it's not because
 

8675
02:36:48,359 --> 02:36:51,110
English so popular it's it's not because
it's an easy language to learn maybe it

8676
02:36:51,110 --> 02:36:51,120
it's an easy language to learn maybe it
 

8677
02:36:51,120 --> 02:36:53,389
it's an easy language to learn maybe it
is I don't really know it's but that's

8678
02:36:53,389 --> 02:36:53,399
is I don't really know it's but that's
 

8679
02:36:53,399 --> 02:36:55,110
is I don't really know it's but that's
not why it's popular but because it's a

8680
02:36:55,110 --> 02:36:55,120
not why it's popular but because it's a
 

8681
02:36:55,120 --> 02:36:56,990
not why it's popular but because it's a
gig uh the United States is a gigantic

8682
02:36:56,990 --> 02:36:57,000
gig uh the United States is a gigantic
 

8683
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:58,670
gig uh the United States is a gigantic
economy therefore it's big economies

8684
02:36:58,670 --> 02:36:58,680
economy therefore it's big economies
 

8685
02:36:58,680 --> 02:37:00,269
economy therefore it's big economies
that do this it's all it is it's all

8686
02:37:00,269 --> 02:37:00,279
that do this it's all it is it's all
 

8687
02:37:00,279 --> 02:37:02,590
that do this it's all it is it's all
about money and that's what and so you

8688
02:37:02,590 --> 02:37:02,600
about money and that's what and so you
 

8689
02:37:02,600 --> 02:37:04,910
about money and that's what and so you
know there's a motivation to learn

8690
02:37:04,910 --> 02:37:04,920
know there's a motivation to learn
 

8691

do that not most people don't do that
well if that was a primary driver then

8724
02:37:34,510 --> 02:37:34,520
well if that was a primary driver then
 

8725

that's happening that well we're moving

8730
02:37:41,429 --> 02:37:41,439
that's happening that well we're moving
 

8731
02:37:41,439 --> 02:37:42,910
that's happening that well we're moving
towards fewer and fewer languages

8732
02:37:42,910 --> 02:37:42,920
towards fewer and fewer languages
 

8733
02:37:42,920 --> 02:37:45,030
towards fewer and fewer languages
exactly I wonder if you're right maybe

8734
02:37:45,030 --> 02:37:45,040
exactly I wonder if you're right maybe
 

8735
02:37:45,040 --> 02:37:47,790
exactly I wonder if you're right maybe
maybe on a you know this is slow but

8736
02:37:47,790 --> 02:37:47,800
maybe on a you know this is slow but
 

8737
02:37:47,800 --> 02:37:49,830
maybe on a you know this is slow but
maybe that's where we're moving but

8738
02:37:49,830 --> 02:37:49,840
maybe that's where we're moving but
 

8739
02:37:49,840 --> 02:37:52,550
maybe that's where we're moving but
there is a tension you're saying uh

8740
02:37:52,550 --> 02:37:52,560
there is a tension you're saying uh
 

8741
02:37:52,560 --> 02:37:55,469
there is a tension you're saying uh
language that the fringes but if you

8742
02:37:55,469 --> 02:37:55,479
language that the fringes but if you
 

8743
02:37:55,479 --> 02:37:58,389
language that the fringes but if you
look at geopolitics and superpowers it

8744
02:37:58,389 --> 02:37:58,399
look at geopolitics and superpowers it
 

8745
02:37:58,399 --> 02:37:59,790
look at geopolitics and superpowers it
does seem that there's another thing in

8746
02:37:59,790 --> 02:37:59,800
does seem that there's another thing in
 

8747
02:37:59,800 --> 02:38:02,710
does seem that there's another thing in
tension which is a language is a

8748
02:38:02,710 --> 02:38:02,720
tension which is a language is a
 

8749
02:38:02,720 --> 02:38:05,070
tension which is a language is a
national identity sometimes oh yeah for

8750
02:38:05,070 --> 02:38:05,080
national identity sometimes oh yeah for
 

8751
02:38:05,080 --> 02:38:06,830
national identity sometimes oh yeah for
certain Nation I mean that's the the war

8752
02:38:06,830 --> 02:38:06,840
certain Nation I mean that's the the war
 

8753
02:38:06,840 --> 02:38:09,790
certain Nation I mean that's the the war
in Ukraine language Ukrainian language

8754
02:38:09,790 --> 02:38:09,800
in Ukraine language Ukrainian language
 

8755
02:38:09,800 --> 02:38:12,630
in Ukraine language Ukrainian language
is a symbol of that war in many ways

8756
02:38:12,630 --> 02:38:12,640
is a symbol of that war in many ways
 

8757
02:38:12,640 --> 02:38:14,269
is a symbol of that war in many ways
like a country fighing for its own

8758
02:38:14,269 --> 02:38:14,279
like a country fighing for its own
 

8759
02:38:14,279 --> 02:38:16,150
like a country fighing for its own
identity so it's not merely the

8760
02:38:16,150 --> 02:38:16,160
identity so it's not merely the
 

8761
02:38:16,160 --> 02:38:18,030
identity so it's not merely the
convenience I mean those two things are

8762
02:38:18,030 --> 02:38:18,040
convenience I mean those two things are
 

8763
02:38:18,040 --> 02:38:19,790
convenience I mean those two things are
ATT tension

8764
02:38:19,790 --> 02:38:19,800
ATT tension
 

8765
02:38:19,800 --> 02:38:21,269
ATT tension
the the convenience of trade and the

8766
02:38:21,269 --> 02:38:21,279
the the convenience of trade and the
 

8767
02:38:21,279 --> 02:38:24,190
the the convenience of trade and the
economics and be able to uh communicate

8768
02:38:24,190 --> 02:38:24,200
economics and be able to uh communicate
 

8769
02:38:24,200 --> 02:38:26,790
economics and be able to uh communicate
with neighboring countries and uh trade

8770
02:38:26,790 --> 02:38:26,800
with neighboring countries and uh trade
 

8771
02:38:26,800 --> 02:38:27,950
with neighboring countries and uh trade
more efficiently with neighboring

8772
02:38:27,950 --> 02:38:27,960
more efficiently with neighboring
 

8773
02:38:27,960 --> 02:38:29,389
more efficiently with neighboring
countries all that kind of stuff but

8774
02:38:29,389 --> 02:38:29,399
countries all that kind of stuff but
 

8775
02:38:29,399 --> 02:38:32,070
countries all that kind of stuff but
also identity of the group I completely

8776
02:38:32,070 --> 02:38:32,080
also identity of the group I completely
 

8777
02:38:32,080 --> 02:38:34,910
also identity of the group I completely
agree because language is the way for

8778
02:38:34,910 --> 02:38:34,920
agree because language is the way for
 

8779
02:38:34,920 --> 02:38:38,389
agree because language is the way for
every Community like uh dialects that

8780
02:38:38,389 --> 02:38:38,399
every Community like uh dialects that
 

8781
02:38:38,399 --> 02:38:41,190
every Community like uh dialects that
emerge are a kind of identity for people

8782
02:38:41,190 --> 02:38:41,200
emerge are a kind of identity for people
 

8783
02:38:41,200 --> 02:38:43,670
emerge are a kind of identity for people
and sometimes a way for people to say f

8784
02:38:43,670 --> 02:38:43,680
and sometimes a way for people to say f
 

8785
02:38:43,680 --> 02:38:47,510
and sometimes a way for people to say f
you to the more powerful yeah people

8786
02:38:47,510 --> 02:38:47,520
you to the more powerful yeah people
 

8787
02:38:47,520 --> 02:38:49,510
you to the more powerful yeah people
that's interesting so in that way

8788
02:38:49,510 --> 02:38:49,520
that's interesting so in that way
 

8789
02:38:49,520 --> 02:38:51,550
that's interesting so in that way
language can't be used as that tool yeah

8790
02:38:51,550 --> 02:38:51,560
language can't be used as that tool yeah
 

8791
02:38:51,560 --> 02:38:53,630
language can't be used as that tool yeah
it it I completely agree and there's a

8792
02:38:53,630 --> 02:38:53,640
it it I completely agree and there's a
 

8793
02:38:53,640 --> 02:38:56,190
it it I completely agree and there's a
lot of work to try to create that

8794
02:38:56,190 --> 02:38:56,200
lot of work to try to create that
 

8795
02:38:56,200 --> 02:38:58,830
lot of work to try to create that
identity so people want to do that speak

8796
02:38:58,830 --> 02:38:58,840
identity so people want to do that speak
 

8797
02:38:58,840 --> 02:39:01,469
identity so people want to do that speak
you know as a cognitive scientist and

8798
02:39:01,469 --> 02:39:01,479
you know as a cognitive scientist and
 

8799
02:39:01,479 --> 02:39:04,150
you know as a cognitive scientist and
language expert I I I hope that

8800
02:39:04,150 --> 02:39:04,160
language expert I I I hope that
 

8801
02:39:04,160 --> 02:39:06,030
language expert I I I hope that
continues because I don't want languages

8802
02:39:06,030 --> 02:39:06,040
continues because I don't want languages
 

8803
02:39:06,040 --> 02:39:07,950
continues because I don't want languages
to die I want languages to survive

8804
02:39:07,950 --> 02:39:07,960
to die I want languages to survive
 

8805
02:39:07,960 --> 02:39:10,630
to die I want languages to survive
because I um because they're so

8806
02:39:10,630 --> 02:39:10,640
because I um because they're so
 

8807
02:39:10,640 --> 02:39:13,590
because I um because they're so
interesting for for so many reasons but

8808
02:39:13,590 --> 02:39:13,600
interesting for for so many reasons but
 

8809
02:39:13,600 --> 02:39:16,110
interesting for for so many reasons but
I mean I I I find them fascinating just

8810
02:39:16,110 --> 02:39:16,120
I mean I I I find them fascinating just
 

8811
02:39:16,120 --> 02:39:17,990
I mean I I I find them fascinating just
for the language part but I think they

8812
02:39:17,990 --> 02:39:18,000
for the language part but I think they
 

8813
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:19,429
for the language part but I think they
you know there's a lot of connections to

8814
02:39:19,429 --> 02:39:19,439
you know there's a lot of connections to
 

8815
02:39:19,439 --> 02:39:20,910
you know there's a lot of connections to
culture as well which is also very

8816
02:39:20,910 --> 02:39:20,920
culture as well which is also very
 

8817
02:39:20,920 --> 02:39:22,870
culture as well which is also very
important do you have

8818
02:39:22,870 --> 02:39:22,880
important do you have
 

8819
02:39:22,880 --> 02:39:25,910
important do you have
hope uh for machine translation that can

8820
02:39:25,910 --> 02:39:25,920
hope uh for machine translation that can
 

8821
02:39:25,920 --> 02:39:28,030
hope uh for machine translation that can
break down the barriers of language so

8822
02:39:28,030 --> 02:39:28,040
break down the barriers of language so
 

8823
02:39:28,040 --> 02:39:29,230
break down the barriers of language so
while all these different diverse

8824
02:39:29,230 --> 02:39:29,240
while all these different diverse
 

8825
02:39:29,240 --> 02:39:31,870
while all these different diverse
languages exist I guess there's many

8826
02:39:31,870 --> 02:39:31,880
languages exist I guess there's many
 

8827
02:39:31,880 --> 02:39:33,110
languages exist I guess there's many
ways of asking this question but

8828
02:39:33,110 --> 02:39:33,120
ways of asking this question but
 

8829
02:39:33,120 --> 02:39:37,630
ways of asking this question but
basically how hard is to it to translate

8830
02:39:37,630 --> 02:39:37,640
basically how hard is to it to translate
 

8831
02:39:37,640 --> 02:39:39,630
basically how hard is to it to translate
in an automated way from one language to

8832
02:39:39,630 --> 02:39:39,640
in an automated way from one language to
 

8833
02:39:39,640 --> 02:39:41,110
in an automated way from one language to
another there's there's going to be

8834
02:39:41,110 --> 02:39:41,120
another there's there's going to be
 

8835
02:39:41,120 --> 02:39:42,750
another there's there's going to be
cases where it's going to be really hard

8836
02:39:42,750 --> 02:39:42,760
cases where it's going to be really hard
 

8837
02:39:42,760 --> 02:39:46,469
cases where it's going to be really hard
right so there are Concepts that are in

8838
02:39:46,469 --> 02:39:46,479
right so there are Concepts that are in
 

8839
02:39:46,479 --> 02:39:48,349
right so there are Concepts that are in
one language and not in another like the

8840
02:39:48,349 --> 02:39:48,359
one language and not in another like the
 

8841
02:39:48,359 --> 02:39:49,950
one language and not in another like the
most extreme kinds of cases are these

8842
02:39:49,950 --> 02:39:49,960
most extreme kinds of cases are these
 

8843
02:39:49,960 --> 02:39:52,030
most extreme kinds of cases are these
cases of number information so exact

8844
02:39:52,030 --> 02:39:52,040
cases of number information so exact
 

8845
02:39:52,040 --> 02:39:54,469
cases of number information so exact
like good luck translating a lot of

8846
02:39:54,469 --> 02:39:54,479
like good luck translating a lot of
 

8847
02:39:54,479 --> 02:39:56,750
like good luck translating a lot of
English into Peta it's just impossible

8848
02:39:56,750 --> 02:39:56,760
English into Peta it's just impossible
 

8849
02:39:56,760 --> 02:39:57,870
English into Peta it's just impossible
there's no way to do it because there

8850
02:39:57,870 --> 02:39:57,880
there's no way to do it because there
 

8851
02:39:57,880 --> 02:39:59,990
there's no way to do it because there
are no words for these Concepts that

8852
02:39:59,990 --> 02:40:00,000
are no words for these Concepts that
 

8853
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,870
are no words for these Concepts that
we're talking about there's probably the

8854
02:40:02,870 --> 02:40:02,880
we're talking about there's probably the
 

8855
02:40:02,880 --> 02:40:04,870
we're talking about there's probably the
flip side right there's probably stuff

8856
02:40:04,870 --> 02:40:04,880
flip side right there's probably stuff
 

8857
02:40:04,880 --> 02:40:07,710
flip side right there's probably stuff
in Peta which is going to be hard to

8858
02:40:07,710 --> 02:40:07,720
in Peta which is going to be hard to
 

8859
02:40:07,720 --> 02:40:09,910
in Peta which is going to be hard to
translate into English on the other side

8860
02:40:09,910 --> 02:40:09,920
translate into English on the other side
 

8861
02:40:09,920 --> 02:40:11,230
translate into English on the other side
and so I just don't know what those

8862
02:40:11,230 --> 02:40:11,240
and so I just don't know what those
 

8863
02:40:11,240 --> 02:40:13,110
and so I just don't know what those
concepts are I mean you know the the

8864
02:40:13,110 --> 02:40:13,120
concepts are I mean you know the the
 

8865
02:40:13,120 --> 02:40:15,349
concepts are I mean you know the the
space the world space is a little is

8866
02:40:15,349 --> 02:40:15,359
space the world space is a little is
 

8867
02:40:15,359 --> 02:40:16,990
space the world space is a little is
different from my world space and so I

8868
02:40:16,990 --> 02:40:17,000
different from my world space and so I
 

8869
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:18,429
different from my world space and so I
don't know what like so that the things

8870
02:40:18,429 --> 02:40:18,439
don't know what like so that the things
 

8871
02:40:18,439 --> 02:40:20,429
don't know what like so that the things
they talk about things are you know it's

8872
02:40:20,429 --> 02:40:20,439
they talk about things are you know it's
 

8873
02:40:20,439 --> 02:40:21,870
they talk about things are you know it's
going to have to do with their life as

8874
02:40:21,870 --> 02:40:21,880
going to have to do with their life as
 

8875
02:40:21,880 --> 02:40:24,389
going to have to do with their life as
opposed to you know my industrial life

8876
02:40:24,389 --> 02:40:24,399
opposed to you know my industrial life
 

8877
02:40:24,399 --> 02:40:26,230
opposed to you know my industrial life
which is going to be different and and

8878
02:40:26,230 --> 02:40:26,240
which is going to be different and and
 

8879
02:40:26,240 --> 02:40:27,910
which is going to be different and and
so there's going to be problems like

8880
02:40:27,910 --> 02:40:27,920
so there's going to be problems like
 

8881
02:40:27,920 --> 02:40:30,030
so there's going to be problems like
that always um you know there's like

8882
02:40:30,030 --> 02:40:30,040
that always um you know there's like
 

8883
02:40:30,040 --> 02:40:31,469
that always um you know there's like
it's not maybe it's not so bad in the

8884
02:40:31,469 --> 02:40:31,479
it's not maybe it's not so bad in the
 

8885
02:40:31,479 --> 02:40:32,950
it's not maybe it's not so bad in the
case of some of these spaces and maybe

8886
02:40:32,950 --> 02:40:32,960
case of some of these spaces and maybe
 

8887
02:40:32,960 --> 02:40:35,269
case of some of these spaces and maybe
it's going to be harder in others and uh

8888
02:40:35,269 --> 02:40:35,279
it's going to be harder in others and uh
 

8889
02:40:35,279 --> 02:40:37,030
it's going to be harder in others and uh
so it's pretty bad in number it's like

8890
02:40:37,030 --> 02:40:37,040
so it's pretty bad in number it's like
 

8891
02:40:37,040 --> 02:40:38,990
so it's pretty bad in number it's like
you know extreme I'd say in the number

8892
02:40:38,990 --> 02:40:39,000
you know extreme I'd say in the number
 

8893
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:40,830
you know extreme I'd say in the number
space you know exact number space but in

8894
02:40:40,830 --> 02:40:40,840
space you know exact number space but in
 

8895
02:40:40,840 --> 02:40:42,469
space you know exact number space but in
the the color Dimension right so that's

8896
02:40:42,469 --> 02:40:42,479
the the color Dimension right so that's
 

8897
02:40:42,479 --> 02:40:45,150
the the color Dimension right so that's
not so bad there's I mean but it's a

8898
02:40:45,150 --> 02:40:45,160
not so bad there's I mean but it's a
 

8899
02:40:45,160 --> 02:40:47,469
not so bad there's I mean but it's a
problem that that you don't have ways to

8900
02:40:47,469 --> 02:40:47,479
problem that that you don't have ways to
 

8901
02:40:47,479 --> 02:40:49,750
problem that that you don't have ways to
talk about the concept

8902
02:40:49,750 --> 02:40:49,760
talk about the concept
 

8903
02:40:49,760 --> 02:40:50,950
talk about the concept
and there might be entire Concepts that

8904
02:40:50,950 --> 02:40:50,960
and there might be entire Concepts that
 

8905
02:40:50,960 --> 02:40:53,269
and there might be entire Concepts that
are missing so to you it's more about

8906
02:40:53,269 --> 02:40:53,279
are missing so to you it's more about
 

8907
02:40:53,279 --> 02:40:55,150
are missing so to you it's more about
the space of concept versus the space of

8908
02:40:55,150 --> 02:40:55,160
the space of concept versus the space of
 

8909
02:40:55,160 --> 02:40:59,190
the space of concept versus the space of
form like form you can probably map yes

8910
02:40:59,190 --> 02:40:59,200
form like form you can probably map yes
 

8911
02:40:59,200 --> 02:41:00,590
form like form you can probably map yes
yeah but so you were talking earlier

8912
02:41:00,590 --> 02:41:00,600
yeah but so you were talking earlier
 

8913
02:41:00,600 --> 02:41:01,830
yeah but so you were talking earlier
about

8914
02:41:01,830 --> 02:41:01,840
about
 

8915
02:41:01,840 --> 02:41:04,269
about
translation and about how

8916
02:41:04,269 --> 02:41:04,279
translation and about how
 

8917
02:41:04,279 --> 02:41:05,950
translation and about how
translations there's good and bad

8918
02:41:05,950 --> 02:41:05,960
translations there's good and bad
 

8919
02:41:05,960 --> 02:41:07,469
translations there's good and bad
translations I mean now we talking about

8920
02:41:07,469 --> 02:41:07,479
translations I mean now we talking about
 

8921
02:41:07,479 --> 02:41:09,750
translations I mean now we talking about
translations of form right so what makes

8922
02:41:09,750 --> 02:41:09,760
translations of form right so what makes
 

8923
02:41:09,760 --> 02:41:12,510
translations of form right so what makes
a writing good right you know it's not

8924
02:41:12,510 --> 02:41:12,520
a writing good right you know it's not
 

8925
02:41:12,520 --> 02:41:15,030
a writing good right you know it's not
music form right it's it's not just the

8926
02:41:15,030 --> 02:41:15,040
music form right it's it's not just the
 

8927
02:41:15,040 --> 02:41:16,870
music form right it's it's not just the
content it's you know it's how it's

8928
02:41:16,870 --> 02:41:16,880
content it's you know it's how it's
 

8929
02:41:16,880 --> 02:41:19,070
content it's you know it's how it's
written and translating that I you know

8930
02:41:19,070 --> 02:41:19,080
written and translating that I you know
 

8931
02:41:19,080 --> 02:41:21,590
written and translating that I you know
I you know that's that sounds

8932
02:41:21,590 --> 02:41:21,600
I you know that's that sounds
 

8933
02:41:21,600 --> 02:41:24,030
I you know that's that sounds
difficult we should we should say that

8934
02:41:24,030 --> 02:41:24,040
difficult we should we should say that
 

8935
02:41:24,040 --> 02:41:26,429
difficult we should we should say that
there is like I don't I hesitate to say

8936
02:41:26,429 --> 02:41:26,439
there is like I don't I hesitate to say
 

8937
02:41:26,439 --> 02:41:29,230
there is like I don't I hesitate to say
meaning but there's a music and a rhythm

8938
02:41:29,230 --> 02:41:29,240
meaning but there's a music and a rhythm
 

8939
02:41:29,240 --> 02:41:31,870
meaning but there's a music and a rhythm
to the form when you look at the broad

8940
02:41:31,870 --> 02:41:31,880
to the form when you look at the broad
 

8941
02:41:31,880 --> 02:41:34,710
to the form when you look at the broad
picture like difference between dust and

8942
02:41:34,710 --> 02:41:34,720
picture like difference between dust and
 

8943
02:41:34,720 --> 02:41:38,309
picture like difference between dust and
tolto uh or Heming you know Hemingway

8944
02:41:38,309 --> 02:41:38,319
tolto uh or Heming you know Hemingway
 

8945
02:41:38,319 --> 02:41:40,950
tolto uh or Heming you know Hemingway
Bowski James Joyce like I mentioned

8946
02:41:40,950 --> 02:41:40,960
Bowski James Joyce like I mentioned
 

8947
02:41:40,960 --> 02:41:42,870
Bowski James Joyce like I mentioned
there's a beat to it there's an edge to

8948
02:41:42,870 --> 02:41:42,880
there's a beat to it there's an edge to
 

8949
02:41:42,880 --> 02:41:45,110
there's a beat to it there's an edge to
it that like is in the

8950
02:41:45,110 --> 02:41:45,120
it that like is in the
 

8951
02:41:45,120 --> 02:41:47,429
it that like is in the
form we can probably get measures of

8952
02:41:47,429 --> 02:41:47,439
form we can probably get measures of
 

8953
02:41:47,439 --> 02:41:50,550
form we can probably get measures of
those yeah I I I don't know I'm

8954
02:41:50,550 --> 02:41:50,560
those yeah I I I don't know I'm
 

8955
02:41:50,560 --> 02:41:52,429
those yeah I I I don't know I'm
optimistic that we could get measures of

8956
02:41:52,429 --> 02:41:52,439
optimistic that we could get measures of
 

8957
02:41:52,439 --> 02:41:55,070
optimistic that we could get measures of
those things and so maybe that's M I

8958
02:41:55,070 --> 02:41:55,080
those things and so maybe that's M I
 

8959
02:41:55,080 --> 02:41:56,630
those things and so maybe that's M I
don't know I don't know though I I have

8960
02:41:56,630 --> 02:41:56,640
don't know I don't know though I I have
 

8961
02:41:56,640 --> 02:41:59,349
don't know I don't know though I I have
not worked on that I would love

8962
02:41:59,349 --> 02:41:59,359
not worked on that I would love
 

8963
02:41:59,359 --> 02:42:00,950
not worked on that I would love
fascinating translation to he I mean

8964
02:42:00,950 --> 02:42:00,960
fascinating translation to he I mean
 

8965
02:42:00,960 --> 02:42:05,269
fascinating translation to he I mean
Hemingway is probably the lowest I would

8966
02:42:05,269 --> 02:42:05,279
Hemingway is probably the lowest I would
 

8967
02:42:05,279 --> 02:42:07,710
Hemingway is probably the lowest I would
love to do see different authors but the

8968
02:42:07,710 --> 02:42:07,720
love to do see different authors but the
 

8969
02:42:07,720 --> 02:42:09,670
love to do see different authors but the
average per

8970
02:42:09,670 --> 02:42:09,680
average per
 

8971
02:42:09,680 --> 02:42:11,950
average per
sentence uh dependency length for

8972
02:42:11,950 --> 02:42:11,960
sentence uh dependency length for
 

8973
02:42:11,960 --> 02:42:14,790
sentence uh dependency length for
Hemingway is probably the shortest

8974
02:42:14,790 --> 02:42:14,800
Hemingway is probably the shortest
 

8975
02:42:14,800 --> 02:42:16,309
Hemingway is probably the shortest
that's your sense huh it's simple

8976
02:42:16,309 --> 02:42:16,319
that's your sense huh it's simple
 

8977
02:42:16,319 --> 02:42:19,269
that's your sense huh it's simple
sentences short short yeah yeah yeah

8978
02:42:19,269 --> 02:42:19,279
sentences short short yeah yeah yeah
 

8979
02:42:19,279 --> 02:42:20,550
sentences short short yeah yeah yeah
yeah I mean that's when if you have

8980
02:42:20,550 --> 02:42:20,560
yeah I mean that's when if you have
 

8981
02:42:20,560 --> 02:42:22,030
yeah I mean that's when if you have
really long sentences even if they don't

8982
02:42:22,030 --> 02:42:22,040
really long sentences even if they don't
 

8983
02:42:22,040 --> 02:42:24,150
really long sentences even if they don't
have Center and Bing like they can have

8984
02:42:24,150 --> 02:42:24,160
have Center and Bing like they can have
 

8985
02:42:24,160 --> 02:42:25,630
have Center and Bing like they can have
longer connections yeah they can have

8986
02:42:25,630 --> 02:42:25,640
longer connections yeah they can have
 

8987
02:42:25,640 --> 02:42:26,990
longer connections yeah they can have
longer connections they don't have to

8988
02:42:26,990 --> 02:42:27,000
longer connections they don't have to
 

8989
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:28,469
longer connections they don't have to
right you can have a long long sentence

8990
02:42:28,469 --> 02:42:28,479
right you can have a long long sentence
 

8991
02:42:28,479 --> 02:42:30,590
right you can have a long long sentence
with a bunch of local words yeah but

8992
02:42:30,590 --> 02:42:30,600
with a bunch of local words yeah but
 

8993
02:42:30,600 --> 02:42:32,870
with a bunch of local words yeah but
it's but it is much more likely to have

8994
02:42:32,870 --> 02:42:32,880
it's but it is much more likely to have
 

8995
02:42:32,880 --> 02:42:34,349
it's but it is much more likely to have
the possibility of long dependencies

8996
02:42:34,349 --> 02:42:34,359
the possibility of long dependencies
 

8997
02:42:34,359 --> 02:42:37,870
the possibility of long dependencies
with long sentences yeah uh I met a guy

8998
02:42:37,870 --> 02:42:37,880
with long sentences yeah uh I met a guy
 

8999
02:42:37,880 --> 02:42:40,910
with long sentences yeah uh I met a guy
named Azar rosin who uh who does a lot

9000
02:42:40,910 --> 02:42:40,920
named Azar rosin who uh who does a lot
 

9001
02:42:40,920 --> 02:42:42,469
named Azar rosin who uh who does a lot
of cool stuff really brilliant works

9002
02:42:42,469 --> 02:42:42,479
of cool stuff really brilliant works
 

9003
02:42:42,479 --> 02:42:44,830
of cool stuff really brilliant works
with Tristan Harris and a bunch of stuff

9004
02:42:44,830 --> 02:42:44,840
with Tristan Harris and a bunch of stuff
 

9005
02:42:44,840 --> 02:42:48,190
with Tristan Harris and a bunch of stuff
but he was talking to me about

9006
02:42:48,190 --> 02:42:48,200
but he was talking to me about
 

9007
02:42:48,200 --> 02:42:50,870
but he was talking to me about
communicating with animals he co-founded

9008
02:42:50,870 --> 02:42:50,880
communicating with animals he co-founded
 

9009
02:42:50,880 --> 02:42:53,790
communicating with animals he co-founded
Earth species project where you're

9010
02:42:53,790 --> 02:42:53,800
Earth species project where you're
 

9011
02:42:53,800 --> 02:42:55,950
Earth species project where you're
trying to find the common language

9012
02:42:55,950 --> 02:42:55,960
trying to find the common language

between whales crows and humans MH and

9014
02:42:58,710 --> 02:42:58,720
between whales crows and humans MH and
 

9015
02:42:58,720 --> 02:43:01,190
between whales crows and humans MH and
he was saying that there is a there's a

9016
02:43:01,190 --> 02:43:01,200
he was saying that there is a there's a
 

9017
02:43:01,200 --> 02:43:03,670
he was saying that there is a there's a
lot of promising work that even though

9018
02:43:03,670 --> 02:43:03,680
lot of promising work that even though
 

9019
02:43:03,680 --> 02:43:05,550
lot of promising work that even though
the signals are very different right

9020
02:43:05,550 --> 02:43:05,560
the signals are very different right
 

9021
02:43:05,560 --> 02:43:08,950
the signals are very different right
like the actual like um if you have

9022
02:43:08,950 --> 02:43:08,960
like the actual like um if you have
 

9023
02:43:08,960 --> 02:43:11,150
like the actual like um if you have
embeddings of the languages they're

9024
02:43:11,150 --> 02:43:11,160
embeddings of the languages they're
 

9025
02:43:11,160 --> 02:43:13,429
embeddings of the languages they're
actually trying to communicate similar

9026
02:43:13,429 --> 02:43:13,439
actually trying to communicate similar
 

9027
02:43:13,439 --> 02:43:17,269
actually trying to communicate similar
type things and um is there something

9028
02:43:17,269 --> 02:43:17,279
type things and um is there something
 

9029
02:43:17,279 --> 02:43:19,389
type things and um is there something
you can comment on that like where is

9030
02:43:19,389 --> 02:43:19,399
you can comment on that like where is
 

9031
02:43:19,399 --> 02:43:21,309
you can comment on that like where is
there promise to that in everything

9032
02:43:21,309 --> 02:43:21,319
there promise to that in everything
 

9033
02:43:21,319 --> 02:43:22,790
there promise to that in everything
you've seen in different cultures

9034
02:43:22,790 --> 02:43:22,800
you've seen in different cultures
 

9035
02:43:22,800 --> 02:43:24,429
you've seen in different cultures
especially like remote cultures that

9036
02:43:24,429 --> 02:43:24,439
especially like remote cultures that
 

9037
02:43:24,439 --> 02:43:26,510
especially like remote cultures that
this is a possibility or no that we can

9038
02:43:26,510 --> 02:43:26,520
this is a possibility or no that we can
 

9039
02:43:26,520 --> 02:43:27,510
this is a possibility or no that we can
talk to

9040
02:43:27,510 --> 02:43:27,520
talk to
 

9041
02:43:27,520 --> 02:43:30,870
talk to
whales I I I would say yes I I I think

9042
02:43:30,870 --> 02:43:30,880
whales I I I would say yes I I I think
 

9043
02:43:30,880 --> 02:43:32,630
whales I I I would say yes I I I think
it's not crazy at all I think it's quite

9044
02:43:32,630 --> 02:43:32,640
it's not crazy at all I think it's quite
 

9045
02:43:32,640 --> 02:43:34,750
it's not crazy at all I think it's quite
reasonable there's this sort of weird

9046
02:43:34,750 --> 02:43:34,760
reasonable there's this sort of weird
 

9047
02:43:34,760 --> 02:43:38,750
reasonable there's this sort of weird
view well odd view I think that to think

9048
02:43:38,750 --> 02:43:38,760
view well odd view I think that to think
 

9049
02:43:38,760 --> 02:43:42,030
view well odd view I think that to think
that human language is somehow special I

9050
02:43:42,030 --> 02:43:42,040
that human language is somehow special I
 

9051
02:43:42,040 --> 02:43:43,070
that human language is somehow special I
mean it

9052
02:43:43,070 --> 02:43:43,080
mean it
 

9053
02:43:43,080 --> 02:43:46,750
mean it
is maybe it is uh we can certainly do

9054
02:43:46,750 --> 02:43:46,760
is maybe it is uh we can certainly do
 

9055
02:43:46,760 --> 02:43:48,309
is maybe it is uh we can certainly do
more than any of the other species you

9056
02:43:48,309 --> 02:43:48,319
more than any of the other species you
 

9057
02:43:48,319 --> 02:43:51,110
more than any of the other species you
know we you know and so and maybe maybe

9058
02:43:51,110 --> 02:43:51,120
know we you know and so and maybe maybe
 

9059
02:43:51,120 --> 02:43:52,790
know we you know and so and maybe maybe
our language system

9060
02:43:52,790 --> 02:43:52,800
our language system
 

9061
02:43:52,800 --> 02:43:56,510
our language system
is part of that it's possible but but

9062
02:43:56,510 --> 02:43:56,520
is part of that it's possible but but
 

9063
02:43:56,520 --> 02:43:58,269
is part of that it's possible but but
that but people do have often talked

9064
02:43:58,269 --> 02:43:58,279
that but people do have often talked
 

9065
02:43:58,279 --> 02:44:00,429
that but people do have often talked
about how human like Chomsky in fact has

9066
02:44:00,429 --> 02:44:00,439
about how human like Chomsky in fact has
 

9067
02:44:00,439 --> 02:44:02,750
about how human like Chomsky in fact has
talked about how human only only human

9068
02:44:02,750 --> 02:44:02,760
talked about how human only only human
 

9069
02:44:02,760 --> 02:44:05,469
talked about how human only only human
language has you know this you know this

9070
02:44:05,469 --> 02:44:05,479
language has you know this you know this
 

9071
02:44:05,479 --> 02:44:07,590
language has you know this you know this
this compositionality thing that he

9072
02:44:07,590 --> 02:44:07,600
this compositionality thing that he
 

9073
02:44:07,600 --> 02:44:09,790
this compositionality thing that he
thinks is sort of key in in language and

9074
02:44:09,790 --> 02:44:09,800
thinks is sort of key in in language and
 

9075
02:44:09,800 --> 02:44:12,030
thinks is sort of key in in language and
it's the the problem with that argument

9076
02:44:12,030 --> 02:44:12,040
it's the the problem with that argument
 

9077
02:44:12,040 --> 02:44:13,870
it's the the problem with that argument
is he doesn't speak

9078
02:44:13,870 --> 02:44:13,880
is he doesn't speak
 

9079
02:44:13,880 --> 02:44:16,550
is he doesn't speak
whale and he doesn't speak uh Crow and

9080
02:44:16,550 --> 02:44:16,560
whale and he doesn't speak uh Crow and
 

9081
02:44:16,560 --> 02:44:18,230
whale and he doesn't speak uh Crow and
he doesn't speak monkey you know he's

9082
02:44:18,230 --> 02:44:18,240
he doesn't speak monkey you know he's
 

9083
02:44:18,240 --> 02:44:19,630
he doesn't speak monkey you know he's
like they they say things like well

9084
02:44:19,630 --> 02:44:19,640
like they they say things like well
 

9085
02:44:19,640 --> 02:44:20,790
like they they say things like well
they're making a bunch of Grunts and

9086
02:44:20,790 --> 02:44:20,800
they're making a bunch of Grunts and
 

9087
02:44:20,800 --> 02:44:23,349
they're making a bunch of Grunts and
squeaks and and and that the reasoning

9088
02:44:23,349 --> 02:44:23,359
squeaks and and and that the reasoning
 

9089
02:44:23,359 --> 02:44:26,030
squeaks and and and that the reasoning
is like that's bad reasoning like you

9090
02:44:26,030 --> 02:44:26,040
is like that's bad reasoning like you
 

9091
02:44:26,040 --> 02:44:27,670
is like that's bad reasoning like you
know I'm pretty sure if you asked a

9092
02:44:27,670 --> 02:44:27,680
know I'm pretty sure if you asked a
 

9093
02:44:27,680 --> 02:44:29,510
know I'm pretty sure if you asked a
whale what we're saying they'd say well

9094
02:44:29,510 --> 02:44:29,520
whale what we're saying they'd say well
 

9095
02:44:29,520 --> 02:44:31,110
whale what we're saying they'd say well
I'm making a bunch of weird noises

9096
02:44:31,110 --> 02:44:31,120
I'm making a bunch of weird noises
 

9097
02:44:31,120 --> 02:44:33,790
I'm making a bunch of weird noises
exactly and so it's like this is a very

9098
02:44:33,790 --> 02:44:33,800
exactly and so it's like this is a very
 

9099
02:44:33,800 --> 02:44:36,309
exactly and so it's like this is a very
odd reasoning to to be making that human

9100
02:44:36,309 --> 02:44:36,319
odd reasoning to to be making that human
 

9101
02:44:36,319 --> 02:44:37,670
odd reasoning to to be making that human
language is special because we're the

9102
02:44:37,670 --> 02:44:37,680
language is special because we're the
 

9103
02:44:37,680 --> 02:44:38,870
language is special because we're the
only ones who have human language I'm

9104
02:44:38,870 --> 02:44:38,880
only ones who have human language I'm
 

9105
02:44:38,880 --> 02:44:42,429
only ones who have human language I'm
like well we don't know what those other

9106
02:44:42,429 --> 02:44:42,439
like well we don't know what those other
 

9107
02:44:42,439 --> 02:44:44,910
like well we don't know what those other
we just don't we can't talk to them yet

9108
02:44:44,910 --> 02:44:44,920
we just don't we can't talk to them yet
 

9109
02:44:44,920 --> 02:44:46,750
we just don't we can't talk to them yet
and so there probably a signal in there

9110
02:44:46,750 --> 02:44:46,760
and so there probably a signal in there
 

9111
02:44:46,760 --> 02:44:49,190
and so there probably a signal in there
and it might very well be something

9112
02:44:49,190 --> 02:44:49,200
and it might very well be something
 

9113
02:44:49,200 --> 02:44:51,670
and it might very well be something
complicated like human language I mean

9114
02:44:51,670 --> 02:44:51,680
complicated like human language I mean
 

9115
02:44:51,680 --> 02:44:54,990
complicated like human language I mean

in lower species there's probably not a

in lower species there's probably not a
 

9119
02:44:56,760 --> 02:44:58,150
in lower species there's probably not a
very good communication system but in

9120
02:44:58,150 --> 02:44:58,160
very good communication system but in
 

9121
02:44:58,160 --> 02:45:00,070
very good communication system but in
these higher higher species where you

9122
02:45:00,070 --> 02:45:00,080
these higher higher species where you
 

9123
02:45:00,080 --> 02:45:03,269

abilities to communicate something uh
 

9127
02:45:05,359 --> 02:45:07,030
abilities to communicate something uh
there might very well be a lot more

02:45:07,030 --> 02:45:07,040
there might very well be a lot more
 

9129
02:45:07,040 --> 02:45:09,750
there might very well be a lot more
signal there than we're uh than we might

have otherwise thought but but also if

02:45:11,670 --> 02:45:11,680
have otherwise thought but but also if
 

9133
02:45:11,680 --> 02:45:13,389

we have a lot of intellectual humility

it's a very different language but they

it's a very different language but they

it would be very interesting in a few

a humbling possibility of being able to

a humbling possibility of being able to

a humbling possibility of being able to

communicate not just between humans
 

9171
02:45:59,200 --> 02:46:02,030
communicate not just between humans
effectively but between all of living

earth well I mean I think some of them

9176
02:46:05,150 --> 02:46:05,160
earth well I mean I think some of them
 

9177
02:46:05,160 --> 02:46:06,429
earth well I mean I think some of them
are not going to have much interesting

9178
02:46:06,429 --> 02:46:06,439
are not going to have much interesting
 

9179
02:46:06,439 --> 02:46:08,790
are not going to have much interesting
to say but some of them will we don't

9180
02:46:08,790 --> 02:46:08,800
to say but some of them will we don't
 

9181
02:46:08,800 --> 02:46:11,790
to say but some of them will we don't
know we certainly don't know I think I I

9182
02:46:11,790 --> 02:46:11,800
know we certainly don't know I think I I

think if we were humble there could be

02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,230
think if we were humble there could be
some interesting trees out

9186
02:46:16,230 --> 02:46:16,240
some interesting trees out
 

9187
02:46:16,240 --> 02:46:18,389
some interesting trees out
there well they're probably talking to

9188
02:46:18,389 --> 02:46:18,399
there well they're probably talking to
 

9189
02:46:18,399 --> 02:46:19,870
there well they're probably talking to
other trees right they're not talking to

9190
02:46:19,870 --> 02:46:19,880
other trees right they're not talking to
 

9191
02:46:19,880 --> 02:46:21,950
other trees right they're not talking to
us and so to the extent they're talking

9192
02:46:21,950 --> 02:46:21,960
us and so to the extent they're talking
 

9193
02:46:21,960 --> 02:46:23,670
us and so to the extent they're talking
they're saying something interesting to

9194
02:46:23,670 --> 02:46:23,680
they're saying something interesting to
 

9195
02:46:23,680 --> 02:46:26,349
they're saying something interesting to
some other you know you know con

9196
02:46:26,349 --> 02:46:26,359
some other you know you know con

some other you know you know con
specific as opposed to us right and so

9198
02:46:28,389 --> 02:46:28,399
specific as opposed to us right and so
 

9199
02:46:28,399 --> 02:46:29,670
specific as opposed to us right and so
there probably is there may be some

9200
02:46:29,670 --> 02:46:29,680
there probably is there may be some
 

9201
02:46:29,680 --> 02:46:31,870
there probably is there may be some
signal there I I you know so there are

9202
02:46:31,870 --> 02:46:31,880
signal there I I you know so there are
 

9203
02:46:31,880 --> 02:46:33,510
signal there I I you know so there are
people out there actually it's pretty

9204
02:46:33,510 --> 02:46:33,520
people out there actually it's pretty
 

9205
02:46:33,520 --> 02:46:35,950
people out there actually it's pretty
common to say that Lang that human

9206
02:46:35,950 --> 02:46:35,960
common to say that Lang that human
 

9207
02:46:35,960 --> 02:46:38,750
common to say that Lang that human
language is special and different from

02:46:38,750 --> 02:46:38,760
language is special and different from
 

9209
02:46:38,760 --> 02:46:40,830
language is special and different from
any other animal communication system

9210
02:46:40,830 --> 02:46:40,840
any other animal communication system
 

9211
02:46:40,840 --> 02:46:43,190
any other animal communication system
and I I I just I just don't think the

9212
02:46:43,190 --> 02:46:43,200
and I I I just I just don't think the
 

9213
02:46:43,200 --> 02:46:45,309
and I I I just I just don't think the
evidence is there for that claim I think

9214
02:46:45,309 --> 02:46:45,319
evidence is there for that claim I think
 

9215
02:46:45,319 --> 02:46:49,150
evidence is there for that claim I think
it's not obvious uh

9216
02:46:49,150 --> 02:46:49,160
it's not obvious uh
 

9217
02:46:49,160 --> 02:46:50,830
it's not obvious uh
we just don't know what what because we

9218
02:46:50,830 --> 02:46:50,840
we just don't know what what because we
 

9219
02:46:50,840 --> 02:46:52,309
we just don't know what what because we
we don't speak these other communication

9220
02:46:52,309 --> 02:46:52,319
we don't speak these other communication
 

9221
02:46:52,319 --> 02:46:56,110
we don't speak these other communication
systems until we get uh better you know

9222
02:46:56,110 --> 02:46:56,120
systems until we get uh better you know
 

9223
02:46:56,120 --> 02:46:57,309
systems until we get uh better you know
I do think there's there are people

9224
02:46:57,309 --> 02:46:57,319
I do think there's there are people
 

9225

I do think there's there are people
working on that as you pointed out the
