honest have trouble speaking in a way
 

327
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:56,830
honest have trouble speaking in a way
that reflects that rigor of thought so

328
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:56,840
that reflects that rigor of thought so

wlfr you said that there are moments in

346
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,080
wlfr you said that there are moments in
 

347
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,189
wlfr you said that there are moments in
history of physics it may be

348
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:18,199
history of physics it may be
 

349
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:20,189
history of physics it may be
mathematical physics or even mathematics

350
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:20,199
mathematical physics or even mathematics
 

351
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:22,670
mathematical physics or even mathematics
where breakthroughs happen and then a

352
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:22,680
where breakthroughs happen and then a
 

353
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,309
where breakthroughs happen and then a
flurry of progress follows so if you

354
00:07:25,309 --> 00:07:25,319
flurry of progress follows so if you
 

355
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,670
flurry of progress follows so if you
look back through the history of physics

356
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:27,680
look back through the history of physics
 

357
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,629
look back through the history of physics
are what moments stand out to you as

358
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:30,639
are what moments stand out to you as
 

359
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,430
are what moments stand out to you as
important such breakthroughs where a

360
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:32,440
important such breakthroughs where a
 

361
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,230
important such breakthroughs where a
flurry of progress follows so the big

362
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:35,240
flurry of progress follows so the big
 

363
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,390
flurry of progress follows so the big
famous one is 1920s the invention of

364
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:37,400
famous one is 1920s the invention of
 

365
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,510
famous one is 1920s the invention of
quantum mechanics where you know in

366
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:40,520
quantum mechanics where you know in
 

367
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,629
quantum mechanics where you know in
about 5 or 10 years lots of stuff got

368
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:42,639
about 5 or 10 years lots of stuff got
 

369
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,950
about 5 or 10 years lots of stuff got
figured out that's now quantum mechanics

370
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:44,960
figured out that's now quantum mechanics
 

371
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,790
figured out that's now quantum mechanics
can you mention the people involved yeah

372
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:46,800
can you mention the people involved yeah
 

373
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,390
can you mention the people involved yeah
that kind of the shener Heisenberg you

374
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:50,400
that kind of the shener Heisenberg you
 

375
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,350
that kind of the shener Heisenberg you
know Einstein had been a key figure

376
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:52,360
know Einstein had been a key figure
 

377
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,990
know Einstein had been a key figure
originally plank then dur was a little

378
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:55,000
originally plank then dur was a little
 

379
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,270
originally plank then dur was a little
bit later that was something that

380
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,280
bit later that was something that
 

381
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,629
bit later that was something that
happened at that time that's sort of

382
00:07:58,629 --> 00:07:58,639
happened at that time that's sort of
 

383
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,029
happened at that time that's sort of
before my time right in my time was in

384
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:02,039
before my time right in my time was in
 

385
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:02,749
before my time right in my time was in
the

386
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:02,759
the
 

387
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:05,589
the
1970s uh there was this sort of

388
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:05,599
1970s uh there was this sort of
 

389
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,710
1970s uh there was this sort of
realization that Quantum field theory

390
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:07,720
realization that Quantum field theory
 

391
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,270
realization that Quantum field theory
was actually going to be useful in

392
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,280
was actually going to be useful in
 

393
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,909
was actually going to be useful in
physics and uh qcd Quantum

394
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:11,919
physics and uh qcd Quantum
 

395
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,830
physics and uh qcd Quantum
thermodynamics theory of ques and gluons

396
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:13,840
thermodynamics theory of ques and gluons
 

397
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,629
thermodynamics theory of ques and gluons
and so on was really getting started and

398
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:16,639
and so on was really getting started and
 

399
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,469
and so on was really getting started and
uh there was again sort of big flurry of

400
00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:19,479
uh there was again sort of big flurry of
 

401
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:21,149
uh there was again sort of big flurry of
things happened then I happened to be a

402
00:08:21,149 --> 00:08:21,159
things happened then I happened to be a
 

403
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:23,950
things happened then I happened to be a
teenager at that time and happened to be

404
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:23,960
teenager at that time and happened to be
 

405
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,510
teenager at that time and happened to be
uh really involved in physics and so I

406
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:27,520
uh really involved in physics and so I
 

407
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,149
uh really involved in physics and so I
got to be part of that which was really

408
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:29,159
got to be part of that which was really
 

409
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:31,629
got to be part of that which was really
cool who were the key figures aside from

410
00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:31,639
cool who were the key figures aside from
 

411
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:34,269
cool who were the key figures aside from
your young selves at that time you know

412
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:34,279
your young selves at that time you know
 

413
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:37,029
your young selves at that time you know
who won the Nobel Prize for qcd okay

414
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:37,039
who won the Nobel Prize for qcd okay
 

415
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,670
who won the Nobel Prize for qcd okay

427
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,509
Weinberg GED Hof he's younger he's he's
in the younger group actually but um

428
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:55,519
in the younger group actually but um
 

429
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,430
in the younger group actually but um
these are these are all you know

430
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,440
these are these are all you know
 

431
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,590
these are these are all you know
characters who are involved I mean it

432
00:08:59,590 --> 00:08:59,600
characters who are involved I mean it
 

433
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,430
characters who are involved I mean it
was uh you know it's funny because those

434
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:01,440
was uh you know it's funny because those
 

435
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,750
was uh you know it's funny because those
are all people who are kind of in my

436
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:03,760
are all people who are kind of in my
 

437
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,670
are all people who are kind of in my
time and I know them and they don't seem

438
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:05,680
time and I know them and they don't seem
 

439
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,110
time and I know them and they don't seem
like sort of uh historical uh you know

440
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,120
like sort of uh historical uh you know
 

441
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,870
like sort of uh historical uh you know
iconic figures they seem more like uh

442
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:11,880
iconic figures they seem more like uh
 

443
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,990
iconic figures they seem more like uh
everyday characters so to speak um and

444
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:15,000
everyday characters so to speak um and
 

445
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,790
everyday characters so to speak um and
uh uh so it's always you know when you

446
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:16,800
uh uh so it's always you know when you
 

447
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,470
uh uh so it's always you know when you
look at history from long afterwards it

448
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:20,480
look at history from long afterwards it
 

449
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,670
look at history from long afterwards it
always seems like everything happened

450
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:22,680
always seems like everything happened
 

451
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,389
always seems like everything happened
instantly um and that's usually not the

452
00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:25,399
instantly um and that's usually not the
 

453
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,389
instantly um and that's usually not the
case there was usually a long buildup

454
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:27,399
case there was usually a long buildup
 

455
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,710
case there was usually a long buildup
but usually there's you know there's

456
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:28,720
but usually there's you know there's
 

457
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,030
but usually there's you know there's
some method iCal thing happens and then

458
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,040
some method iCal thing happens and then
 

459
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,190
some method iCal thing happens and then
there's a whole bunch of low hanging

460
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:32,200
there's a whole bunch of low hanging
 

461
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,590
there's a whole bunch of low hanging
fruit to be picked and that usually

462
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:34,600
fruit to be picked and that usually
 

463
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,150
fruit to be picked and that usually
lasts 5 or 10 years you know we see it

464
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:37,160
lasts 5 or 10 years you know we see it
 

465
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,350
lasts 5 or 10 years you know we see it
today with machine learning and you know

466
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:40,360
today with machine learning and you know
 

467
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,670
today with machine learning and you know
deep learning neural Nets and so on you

468
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:42,680
deep learning neural Nets and so on you
 

469
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,630
deep learning neural Nets and so on you
know methodological Advance things

470
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
know methodological Advance things
 

471
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,230
know methodological Advance things
actually started working in you know

472
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240
actually started working in you know
 

473
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,350
actually started working in you know
2011 2012 and so on and uh you know

474
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:49,360
2011 2012 and so on and uh you know
 

475
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,550
2011 2012 and so on and uh you know
there's been this sort of Rapid uh

476
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:51,560
there's been this sort of Rapid uh
 

477
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,190
there's been this sort of Rapid uh
picking of loow hanging fruit which is

478
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:54,200
picking of loow hanging fruit which is
 

479
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,590
picking of loow hanging fruit which is
probably you know some significant

480
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:57,600
probably you know some significant
 

481
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,990
probably you know some significant

00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,000
fraction of the way way done so to speak
 

483
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,630

do you think there's a key moment like

484
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:01,640
do you think there's a key moment like
 

485
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,470
do you think there's a key moment like
if I had to really introspect like what

486
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:03,480
if I had to really introspect like what
 

487
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,630
if I had to really introspect like what
was the key moment for the Deep learning

488
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:05,640

where so deep learning neural networks

500
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:17,959
where so deep learning neural networks
 

501
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:20,110
where so deep learning neural networks
have been around for a long time there's

502
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:20,120
have been around for a long time there's
 

503
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,430
have been around for a long time there's
a bunch of 1940s yeah there's a bunch of

504
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:22,440
a bunch of 1940s yeah there's a bunch of
 

505
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,110
a bunch of 1940s yeah there's a bunch of
little pieces that came together and

506
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:24,120
little pieces that came together and
 

507
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,630
little pieces that came together and
then all of a sudden everybody's eyes

508
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:26,640
then all of a sudden everybody's eyes
 

509
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,790
then all of a sudden everybody's eyes
lit up like wow there's something here

510
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:29,800
lit up like wow there's something here
 

511
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,389

like even just looking at your own work

512
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:32,399
like even just looking at your own work
 

513
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,310
like even just looking at your own work
just you're thinking about the universe

514
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:34,320
just you're thinking about the universe
 

515
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,030
just you're thinking about the universe
that there's Simple Rules can create

516
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,040
that there's Simple Rules can create
 

517
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,150
that there's Simple Rules can create
complexity you know at which point was

518
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,160
complexity you know at which point was
 

519
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,949
complexity you know at which point was
there a thing where your eyes light up

520
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:44,959
there a thing where your eyes light up
 

521
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:45,990
there a thing where your eyes light up
it's like wait a minute there's

522
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,000
it's like wait a minute there's
 

523
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,430
it's like wait a minute there's
something here is it the very first idea

524
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:49,440
something here is it the very first idea
 

525
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,430
something here is it the very first idea
or is it some moment along the line of

526
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:52,440
or is it some moment along the line of
 

527
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,310
or is it some moment along the line of
implementations and experiments and so

528
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:54,320
implementations and experiments and so
 

529
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,629
implementations and experiments and so
on there's there's a couple of different

530
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:55,639
on there's there's a couple of different
 

531
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:58,590
on there's there's a couple of different
stages to this I mean one is the think

532
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:58,600
stages to this I mean one is the think
 

533
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,110
stages to this I mean one is the think
about the world computationally you know

534
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,120
about the world computationally you know
 

535
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,910
about the world computationally you know
can we use programs instead of equations

536
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:03,920
can we use programs instead of equations
 

537
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,069
can we use programs instead of equations
to make models of the world that's

538
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:06,079
to make models of the world that's
 

539
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,949
to make models of the world that's
something that I got interested in in

540
00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:07,959
something that I got interested in in
 

541
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,190
something that I got interested in in
the at the beginning of the 1980s you

542
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:10,200
the at the beginning of the 1980s you
 

543
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,670
the at the beginning of the 1980s you
know I did a bunch of computer

544
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:11,680
know I did a bunch of computer
 

545
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,949
know I did a bunch of computer
experiments uh you know when I first did

546
00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:13,959
experiments uh you know when I first did
 

547
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:16,629
experiments uh you know when I first did
them I didn't really I I could see some

548
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:16,639
them I didn't really I I could see some
 

549
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:18,470
them I didn't really I I could see some
significance to them but took me a few

550
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:18,480
significance to them but took me a few
 

551
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,269
significance to them but took me a few
years to really say wow there's a big

552
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:21,279
years to really say wow there's a big
 

553
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,910
years to really say wow there's a big
important phenomenon here that lets sort

554
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:23,920
important phenomenon here that lets sort
 

555
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,069
important phenomenon here that lets sort
of complex things arise from very simple

556
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:26,079
of complex things arise from very simple
 

557
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,670
of complex things arise from very simple
programs um that kind of happened back

558
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:28,680
programs um that kind of happened back
 

559
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,949
programs um that kind of happened back
in 198 4 or so then you know bunch of

560
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:31,959
in 198 4 or so then you know bunch of
 

561
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:34,110
in 198 4 or so then you know bunch of
other years go by then I start actually

562
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:34,120
other years go by then I start actually
 

563
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,430
other years go by then I start actually
doing a lot of much more systematic

564
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:36,440
doing a lot of much more systematic
 

565
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,069
doing a lot of much more systematic
computer experiments and things and find

566
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:38,079
computer experiments and things and find
 

567
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,870
computer experiments and things and find
out that the you know this phenomenon

568
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:39,880
out that the you know this phenomenon
 

569
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,590
out that the you know this phenomenon
that I could only have said occurs in

570
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:41,600
that I could only have said occurs in
 

571
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,430
that I could only have said occurs in
one particular case is actually

572
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:43,440
one particular case is actually
 

573
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,430
one particular case is actually
something incredibly General and then

574
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:45,440
something incredibly General and then
 

575
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,509
something incredibly General and then
that led me to this thing called

576
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:46,519
that led me to this thing called
 

577
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,710
that led me to this thing called
principle of computational equivalence

578
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:48,720
principle of computational equivalence
 

579
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,670
principle of computational equivalence
and that was a a long story and then you

580
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:51,680
and that was a a long story and then you
 

581
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,550
and that was a a long story and then you
know as part of that process I was like

582
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:54,560
know as part of that process I was like
 

583
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,030
know as part of that process I was like
okay you can make simple programs can

584
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:57,040
okay you can make simple programs can
 

585
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,430
okay you can make simple programs can
make models of complicated things what

586
00:11:59,430 --> 00:11:59,440
make models of complicated things what
 

587
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,190
make models of complicated things what
about the whole universe that's our sort

588
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:01,200
about the whole universe that's our sort
 

589
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,870
about the whole universe that's our sort
of ultimate example of a complicated

590
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:02,880
of ultimate example of a complicated
 

591
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,829
of ultimate example of a complicated
thing yeah and so I got to thinking you

592
00:12:04,829 --> 00:12:04,839
thing yeah and so I got to thinking you
 

593
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:07,990
thing yeah and so I got to thinking you
know could we use these ideas to to

594
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,000
know could we use these ideas to to
 

595
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,509
know could we use these ideas to to
study fundamental physics uh you know I

596
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:10,519
study fundamental physics uh you know I
 

597
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:12,190
study fundamental physics uh you know I
happen to know a lot about you know

598
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:12,200
happen to know a lot about you know
 

599
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,470
happen to know a lot about you know
traditional fundamental physics my um uh

600
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:15,480
traditional fundamental physics my um uh
 

601
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,949
traditional fundamental physics my um uh
my first you know I I had a bunch of

602
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:16,959
my first you know I I had a bunch of
 

603
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,310
my first you know I I had a bunch of
ideas about how to do this in the early

604
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:18,320
ideas about how to do this in the early
 

605
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,470
ideas about how to do this in the early
1990s I made a bunch of technical

606
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:20,480
1990s I made a bunch of technical
 

607
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,110
1990s I made a bunch of technical
progress I figured out a bunch of things

608
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:22,120
progress I figured out a bunch of things
 

609
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,949
progress I figured out a bunch of things
I thought were pretty interesting you

610
00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:23,959
I thought were pretty interesting you
 

611
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:26,670
I thought were pretty interesting you
know I wrote about them back in 2002

612
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:26,680
know I wrote about them back in 2002
 

613

00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:40,560
sort of romanticize a little more on the
 

625
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,790
sort of romanticize a little more on the

science
 

631
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,790
science
describes that you know the progress in

00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:48,800
describes that you know the progress in
 

633
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,189
describes that you know the progress in

with this view that there is

00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,030
with this view that there is
Revolutions in science that just kind of

642
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:02,040
Revolutions in science that just kind of
 

643
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,430
Revolutions in science that just kind of
flip the table what happens is it's a

644
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:05,440
flip the table what happens is it's a
 

645
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,949
flip the table what happens is it's a
different way of thinking about things

it's a different methodology for

00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:11,670
it's a different methodology for
studying things and that opens stuff up

studying things and that opens stuff up
 

651
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,350

this is this idea of

00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:14,360
this is this idea of

663
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,509
I think it's called an evaders where he

has been done by groups there's a
 

669
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,550

fall is is uh ultimately like one person
 

679
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,310
fall is is uh ultimately like one person
responsible for these revolutions that

00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:02,399
interacting I think it ends up being
 

691
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,189
interacting I think it ends up being
like many things there's leadership and

692
00:14:04,189 --> 00:14:04,199
like many things there's leadership and
 

693
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:06,150
like many things there's leadership and
there ends up being it's a lot easier

694
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:06,160
there ends up being it's a lot easier
 

695
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,030
there ends up being it's a lot easier
for one person to have a crisp new idea

696
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:08,040
for one person to have a crisp new idea
 

697
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,430
for one person to have a crisp new idea
than it is for a big committee to have a

698
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:09,440
than it is for a big committee to have a
 

699
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,189
than it is for a big committee to have a
crisp new idea and um I think you know

700
00:14:12,189 --> 00:14:12,199
crisp new idea and um I think you know
 

701
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:14,470
crisp new idea and um I think you know
but I think it it can happen that you

702
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:14,480
but I think it it can happen that you
 

703
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,189
but I think it it can happen that you
know you have a great idea but the world

704
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:17,199
know you have a great idea but the world
 

705
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,150
know you have a great idea but the world
isn't ready for you for it and um you

706
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,160
isn't ready for you for it and um you
 

707
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,069
isn't ready for you for it and um you
know you can you can I mean this has

708
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:22,079
know you can you can I mean this has
 

709
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,310
know you can you can I mean this has
happened to me plenty right it's you

710
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:24,320
happened to me plenty right it's you
 

711
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,870
happened to me plenty right it's you
know you have an idea it's actually a

712
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:25,880
know you have an idea it's actually a
 

713
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,310
know you have an idea it's actually a
pretty good idea but things aren't ready

714
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:29,320
pretty good idea but things aren't ready
 

715
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,790
pretty good idea but things aren't ready
either either you're not really ready

716
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:30,800
either either you're not really ready
 

717
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,629
either either you're not really ready
for it or the ambient world isn't ready

718
00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:33,639
for it or the ambient world isn't ready
 

719
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,430
for it or the ambient world isn't ready
for it and it's hard to get the thing to

720
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:36,440
for it and it's hard to get the thing to
 

721
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,910
for it and it's hard to get the thing to
to get traction it's kind of interesting

722
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:38,920
to get traction it's kind of interesting
 

723
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,670
to get traction it's kind of interesting
I mean when I look at a new kind of

724
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:40,680
I mean when I look at a new kind of
 

725
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,590
I mean when I look at a new kind of
science you're now living inside history

726
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:43,600
science you're now living inside history
 

727
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,150
science you're now living inside history
so you can't tell the story of these

728
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,160
so you can't tell the story of these
 

729
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,829
so you can't tell the story of these
decades but it seems like the new kind

730
00:14:48,829 --> 00:14:48,839
decades but it seems like the new kind
 

731
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,670
decades but it seems like the new kind
of science has

732
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:51,680
of science has
 

733
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,269
of science has
not had the Revolutionary impact I would

734
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:56,279
not had the Revolutionary impact I would
 

735
00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:00,310
not had the Revolutionary impact I would
think it uh might like it feels like at

736
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:00,320
think it uh might like it feels like at
 

737
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,790
think it uh might like it feels like at
some point of course it might be but it

738
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:02,800
some point of course it might be but it
 

739
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,269
some point of course it might be but it
feels at some point people will return

740
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:05,279
feels at some point people will return
 

741
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,189
feels at some point people will return
to that book and say there was something

742
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:08,199
to that book and say there was something
 

743
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:11,230
to that book and say there was something
special here this was incredible what

744
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:11,240
special here this was incredible what
 

745
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,829
special here this was incredible what
happened or do you think that's already

746
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:12,839
happened or do you think that's already
 

747
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:14,790
happened or do you think that's already
happened oh yeah it's happened except

748
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:14,800
happened oh yeah it's happened except
 

749
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,910
happened oh yeah it's happened except
that people aren't you know the the sort

750
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:16,920
that people aren't you know the the sort
 

751
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,509
that people aren't you know the the sort
of the heroism of it may not be there

752
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:19,519
of the heroism of it may not be there
 

753
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,749
of the heroism of it may not be there
but the what's happened is for 300 years

754
00:15:22,749 --> 00:15:22,759
but the what's happened is for 300 years
 

755
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:24,990
but the what's happened is for 300 years
people basically said if you want to

756
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:25,000
people basically said if you want to
 

757
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,069
people basically said if you want to
make a model of things in the world

758
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:27,079
make a model of things in the world
 

759
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:28,470
make a model of things in the world
mathematical equations are the best

760
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:28,480
mathematical equations are the best
 

761
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,749
mathematical equations are the best
place to go

762
00:15:29,749 --> 00:15:29,759
place to go
 

763
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,470

last 15 years doesn't happen you know
 

765
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,030
last 15 years doesn't happen you know
new models that get made of things most

766
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,040
new models that get made of things most
 

767
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,430
new models that get made of things most
often are made with programs not with

851
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,350

called that right that's not

called that right that's not
 

853
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,270
called that right that's not
coincidental yeah it's interesting that

855
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,189

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,510
this idea I mean you look at your
competition around rule 30 I mean that's

862
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:30,520
competition around rule 30 I mean that's
 

863
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,470
competition around rule 30 I mean that's
fascinating if if you can say

00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:33,480
fascinating if if you can say
 

865

873
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,630
that's the core that has been a question

of science I think that's a that is a
 

875
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,510
of science I think that's a that is a
some people's view of what science is

00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:46,520
some people's view of what science is
 

877
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,549
some people's view of what science is
about and it's not clear that's the

00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:48,559
about and it's not clear that's the
 

879
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,510
about and it's not clear that's the

what science's actual role in those

888
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:57,400
what science's actual role in those
 

889
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,310
what science's actual role in those
kinds of things is oh you think it's

00:17:59,310 --> 00:17:59,320
kinds of things is oh you think it's

a set of tools and Mathematics that help
 

951
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,470
a set of tools and Mathematics that help
you discover such pockets that's where

952
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:07,480
you discover such pockets that's where
 

953
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,950
you discover such pockets that's where
we live is in the pockets of

954
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:08,960
we live is in the pockets of
 

955
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,510
we live is in the pockets of
reducibility right that's why you know

956
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:11,520
reducibility right that's why you know
 

957
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,669
reducibility right that's why you know
and this is one of the things that sort

958
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:12,679
and this is one of the things that sort
 

959
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:14,110
and this is one of the things that sort
of come out of this physics project and

960
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:14,120
of come out of this physics project and
 

961
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,630
of come out of this physics project and
actually something that again I should

962
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:15,640
actually something that again I should
 

963
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,110
actually something that again I should
have realized many years ago but didn't

964
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:18,120
have realized many years ago but didn't
 

965
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,549
have realized many years ago but didn't
um is uh you know the it it could very

966
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:21,559
um is uh you know the it it could very
 

967
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:23,310
um is uh you know the it it could very
well be that everything about the world

968
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:23,320
well be that everything about the world
 

969
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,950
well be that everything about the world
is computationally irreducible and

970
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:24,960
is computationally irreducible and
 

971
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,510
is computationally irreducible and
completely unpredictable but you know in

972
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:27,520
completely unpredictable but you know in
 

973
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,149
completely unpredictable but you know in
our experience of the world there is at

974
00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:30,159
our experience of the world there is at
 

975
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:31,669
our experience of the world there is at
least some amount of prediction we can

976
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:31,679
least some amount of prediction we can
 

977
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,230
least some amount of prediction we can
make and that's because we have sort of

978
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:34,240
make and that's because we have sort of
 

979
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,149
make and that's because we have sort of
chosen a slice of um probably talk about

980
00:19:37,149 --> 00:19:37,159
chosen a slice of um probably talk about
 

981
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:38,549
chosen a slice of um probably talk about
this in in much more detail but I mean

982
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:38,559
this in in much more detail but I mean
 

983
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,190
this in in much more detail but I mean
we've kind of chosen a slice of how to

984
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:40,200
we've kind of chosen a slice of how to
 

985
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,070
we've kind of chosen a slice of how to
think about the universe in which we can

986
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:43,080
think about the universe in which we can
 

987
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,510
think about the universe in which we can
kind of sample a certain amount of

988
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:44,520
kind of sample a certain amount of
 

989
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,549
kind of sample a certain amount of
computational reducibility and that's

990
00:19:47,549 --> 00:19:47,559
computational reducibility and that's
 

991
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:51,230
computational reducibility and that's
that's sort of where we where we exist

992
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:51,240
that's sort of where we where we exist
 

993
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,029
that's sort of where we where we exist
um and uh it may not be the whole story

994
00:19:54,029 --> 00:19:54,039
um and uh it may not be the whole story
 

995
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:56,390
um and uh it may not be the whole story
of how the universe is but it is the

996
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:56,400
of how the universe is but it is the
 

997
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,190
of how the universe is but it is the
part of the universe that we care about

998
00:19:59,190 --> 00:19:59,200
part of the universe that we care about
 

999
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,990
part of the universe that we care about
and we sort of operate in and um that's

1000
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:02,000
and we sort of operate in and um that's
 

1001
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,149
and we sort of operate in and um that's
you know in science that's been sort of

1002
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:04,159
you know in science that's been sort of
 

1003
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,070
you know in science that's been sort of
a very special case of that that is

1004
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,080
a very special case of that that is
 

1005
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,870
a very special case of that that is
science has chosen to talk a lot about

1006
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:08,880
science has chosen to talk a lot about
 

1007
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,390
science has chosen to talk a lot about
places where there is this computational

1008
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:11,400
places where there is this computational
 

1009
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,590
places where there is this computational
reducibility that it can find you know

1010
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:13,600
reducibility that it can find you know
 

1011
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,190
reducibility that it can find you know
the motion of the planets can be more or

1012
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:15,200
the motion of the planets can be more or
 

1013
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,909
the motion of the planets can be more or
less predicted you know the uh uh

1014
00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:17,919
less predicted you know the uh uh
 

1015
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,350
less predicted you know the uh uh
something about the weather is much

1016
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:19,360
something about the weather is much
 

1017
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,669
something about the weather is much
harder to predict something about you

1018
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:21,679
harder to predict something about you
 

1019
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,710
harder to predict something about you
know other kinds of things the the um

1020
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:23,720
know other kinds of things the the um
 

1021
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,909
know other kinds of things the the um
are much harder to predict and it it's

1022
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:25,919
are much harder to predict and it it's
 

1023
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,669
are much harder to predict and it it's
um uh these are but science has tended

1024
00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:28,679
um uh these are but science has tended
 

1025
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:31,029
um uh these are but science has tended
to you know concentrate itself on places

1026
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:31,039
to you know concentrate itself on places
 

1027
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,390
to you know concentrate itself on places
where its methods have allowed

1028
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:33,400
where its methods have allowed
 

1029
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,950
where its methods have allowed
successful prediction so you think rule

1030
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:35,960
successful prediction so you think rule
 

1031
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,430
successful prediction so you think rule
30 if it could Linger on it because it's

1032
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:39,440
30 if it could Linger on it because it's
 

1033
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,510
30 if it could Linger on it because it's
just such a beautiful simple formulation

1034
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:41,520
just such a beautiful simple formulation
 

1035
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,630
just such a beautiful simple formulation
of the essential concept underlying all

1036
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:43,640
of the essential concept underlying all
 

1037
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,070
of the essential concept underlying all
the things we're talking about do you

1038
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:45,080
the things we're talking about do you
 

1039
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,230
the things we're talking about do you
think there's pockets of reducibility

1040
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:47,240
think there's pockets of reducibility
 

1041
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,070
think there's pockets of reducibility
inside rule 30 yes but it's a question

1042
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,080
inside rule 30 yes but it's a question
 

1043
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,270
inside rule 30 yes but it's a question
of how big are they what will they allow

1044
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:52,280
of how big are they what will they allow
 

1045
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,789
of how big are they what will they allow
you to say and so on and that's and

1046
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:54,799
you to say and so on and that's and
 

1047
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,950
you to say and so on and that's and
figuring out where those pockets are I

1048
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:56,960
figuring out where those pockets are I
 

1049
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,029
figuring out where those pockets are I
mean in a sense that's the that's sort

1050
00:20:59,029 --> 00:20:59,039
mean in a sense that's the that's sort
 

1051
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,310
mean in a sense that's the that's sort
of a uh uh you know that is an essential

1052
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:02,320
of a uh uh you know that is an essential
 

1053
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,270
of a uh uh you know that is an essential
thing that one would like to do in

1054
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:04,280
thing that one would like to do in
 

1055
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,789
thing that one would like to do in
science um but it's it's also the the

1056
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:07,799
science um but it's it's also the the
 

1057
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,510
science um but it's it's also the the
important thing to realize that that has

1058
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:09,520
important thing to realize that that has
 

1059
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,870
important thing to realize that that has
not been you know is is that science if

1060
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:13,880
not been you know is is that science if
 

1061
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,789
not been you know is is that science if
you just pick an arbitrary thing you say

1062
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:15,799
you just pick an arbitrary thing you say
 

1063
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:18,470
you just pick an arbitrary thing you say
what's the answer to this question that

1064
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:18,480
what's the answer to this question that
 

1065
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,710
what's the answer to this question that
question may not be one that has a

1066
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:20,720
question may not be one that has a
 

1067
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,149
question may not be one that has a
computationally reducible answer that

1068
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:23,159
computationally reducible answer that
 

1069
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:26,390
computationally reducible answer that
question if you if you choose you know

1070
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:26,400
question if you if you choose you know
 

1071
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,190
question if you if you choose you know
if you walk along the series of

1072
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:28,200
if you walk along the series of
 

1073
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,669
if you walk along the series of
questions and you've got one that's

1074
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:29,679
questions and you've got one that's
 

1075
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,029
questions and you've got one that's
reducible and you get to another one

1076
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:31,039
reducible and you get to another one
 

1077
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,110
reducible and you get to another one
that's nearby and it's reducible too if

1078
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:33,120
that's nearby and it's reducible too if
 

1079
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,630
that's nearby and it's reducible too if
you stick to that kind of stick to the

1080
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:35,640
you stick to that kind of stick to the
 

1081
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,710
you stick to that kind of stick to the
land so to speak yeah then you can go

1082
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:38,720
land so to speak yeah then you can go
 

1083
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,710
land so to speak yeah then you can go
down this chain of sort of reducible

1084
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:40,720
down this chain of sort of reducible
 

1085
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,909
down this chain of sort of reducible
answerable things but if you just say

1086
00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:42,919
answerable things but if you just say
 

1087
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:44,470
answerable things but if you just say
I'm just pick a question at random I'm

1088
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:44,480
I'm just pick a question at random I'm
 

1089
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,669
I'm just pick a question at random I'm
going to have my computer pick a

1090
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:45,679
going to have my computer pick a
 

1091
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,950
going to have my computer pick a
question at random yeah uh most likely

1092
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:47,960
question at random yeah uh most likely
 

1093
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,750
question at random yeah uh most likely
it's going to be irreducible most likely

1094
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:49,760
it's going to be irreducible most likely
 

1095
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,510
it's going to be irreducible most likely
it will be irreducible and and what

1096
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:51,520
it will be irreducible and and what
 

1097
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,510
it will be irreducible and and what
we're throwing in the world so to speak

1098
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:54,520
we're throwing in the world so to speak
 

1099
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,350
we're throwing in the world so to speak
uh we you know when we engineer things

1100
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:56,360
uh we you know when we engineer things
 

1101
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,950
uh we you know when we engineer things
we tend to engineer things to sort of

1102
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:57,960
we tend to engineer things to sort of
 

1103
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,390
we tend to engineer things to sort of
keep in the zone of reducibility when

1104
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:00,400
keep in the zone of reducibility when
 

1105
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,230
keep in the zone of reducibility when
we're thrown things by the natural world

1106
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:02,240
we're thrown things by the natural world
 

1107
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,630
we're thrown things by the natural world
for example not not at all certain that

1108
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:05,640
for example not not at all certain that
 

1109
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,630
for example not not at all certain that
we will be kept in this kind of zone of

1110
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:07,640
we will be kept in this kind of zone of
 

1111
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,909
we will be kept in this kind of zone of
reducibility can we talk about this

1112
00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:09,919
reducibility can we talk about this
 

1113
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,669
reducibility can we talk about this
pandemic

1114
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:11,679
pandemic
 

1115
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,070
pandemic
then for a second is so how do we

1116
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,080
then for a second is so how do we
 

1117
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,070
then for a second is so how do we
there's obviously huge amount of

1118
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:18,080
there's obviously huge amount of
 

1119
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,710
there's obviously huge amount of
economic pain that people are feeling

1120
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:19,720
economic pain that people are feeling
 

1121
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,710
economic pain that people are feeling
there's a huge incentive and medical

1122
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:22,720
there's a huge incentive and medical
 

1123
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,630
there's a huge incentive and medical
pain uh Health just all kind

1124
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:25,640
pain uh Health just all kind
 

1125
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,669
pain uh Health just all kind
psychological there's a huge incentive

1126
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:27,679
psychological there's a huge incentive
 

1127
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,950
psychological there's a huge incentive
to figure this out to walk along the

1128
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:29,960
to figure this out to walk along the
 

1129
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,390
to figure this out to walk along the
trajectory of reducible of

1130
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:33,400
trajectory of reducible of
 

1131
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,510
trajectory of reducible of
reducibility there's there's a a lot of

1132
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:36,520
reducibility there's there's a a lot of
 

1133
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,669
reducibility there's there's a a lot of
disperate data you know people

1134
00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:38,679
disperate data you know people
 

1135
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:40,430
disperate data you know people
understand generally how virus is spread

1136
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:40,440
understand generally how virus is spread
 

1137
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,310
understand generally how virus is spread
but it's very complicated because

1138
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:43,320
but it's very complicated because
 

1139
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,390
but it's very complicated because
there's a lot of uncertainty there's

1140
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:46,400
there's a lot of uncertainty there's
 

1141
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,350
there's a lot of uncertainty there's
a there could be a lot of variability

1142
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:49,360
a there could be a lot of variability
 

1143
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,549
a there could be a lot of variability
like so many obviously a nearly infinite

1144
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:52,559
like so many obviously a nearly infinite
 

1145
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,149
like so many obviously a nearly infinite
number of variables that uh that

1146
00:22:55,149 --> 00:22:55,159
number of variables that uh that
 

1147
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:58,110
number of variables that uh that
represent human interaction and so you

1148
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:58,120
represent human interaction and so you
 

1149
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,230
represent human interaction and so you
have to figure out in ter from the

1150
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:00,240
have to figure out in ter from the
 

1151
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,149
have to figure out in ter from the
perspective of reducibility figure out

1152
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:03,159
perspective of reducibility figure out
 

1153
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:04,390
perspective of reducibility figure out
which

1154
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:04,400
which
 

1155
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,870
which
variables are really important in this

1156
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:06,880
variables are really important in this
 

1157
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,630
variables are really important in this
kind of uh from an epidemiological

1158
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:09,640
kind of uh from an epidemiological
 

1159
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,470
kind of uh from an epidemiological
perspective so why aren't we you kind of

1160
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:13,480
perspective so why aren't we you kind of
 

1161
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,310
perspective so why aren't we you kind of
said that we're clearly failing well I I

1162
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:16,320
said that we're clearly failing well I I
 

1163
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,710
said that we're clearly failing well I I
think it's a complicated thing so so I

1164
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:17,720
think it's a complicated thing so so I
 

1165
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,549
think it's a complicated thing so so I
mean you know when this pandemic started

1166
00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:19,559
mean you know when this pandemic started
 

1167
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:21,470
mean you know when this pandemic started
up you know I happen to be in in the

1168
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:21,480
up you know I happen to be in in the
 

1169
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,190
up you know I happen to be in in the
middle of being about to release this

1170
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:23,200
middle of being about to release this
 

1171
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,070
middle of being about to release this
whole physics project thing but I

1172
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:25,080
whole physics project thing but I
 

1173
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,310
whole physics project thing but I
thought you know the timing is just uh

1174
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:27,320
thought you know the timing is just uh
 

1175
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,230
thought you know the timing is just uh
cosmically

1176
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:29,240
cosmically
 

1177
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,070
cosmically
but but um but you know but I thought

1178
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:31,080
but but um but you know but I thought
 

1179
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,470
but but um but you know but I thought
you know I I should do the public

1180
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:32,480
you know I I should do the public
 

1181
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,669
you know I I should do the public
service thing of you know trying to

1182
00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:34,679
service thing of you know trying to
 

1183
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:35,549
service thing of you know trying to
understand what I could about the

1184
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:35,559
understand what I could about the
 

1185
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:36,990
understand what I could about the
pandemic and you know we've been

1186
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:37,000
pandemic and you know we've been
 

1187
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,549
pandemic and you know we've been
curating data about it and all that kind

1188
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:38,559
curating data about it and all that kind
 

1189
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,310
curating data about it and all that kind
of thing but but you know so I started

1190
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:40,320
of thing but but you know so I started
 

1191
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,470
of thing but but you know so I started
looking at the data and started looking

1192
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:42,480
looking at the data and started looking
 

1193
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,029
looking at the data and started looking
at modeling and I decided it's just

1194
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:45,039
at modeling and I decided it's just
 

1195
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,990
at modeling and I decided it's just
really hard you need to know a lot of

1196
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:47,000
really hard you need to know a lot of
 

1197
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,830
really hard you need to know a lot of
stuff that we don't know about human

1198
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:48,840
stuff that we don't know about human
 

1199
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,870
stuff that we don't know about human
interactions it's actually clear now

1200
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:50,880
interactions it's actually clear now
 

1201
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,909
interactions it's actually clear now
that there's a lot of stuff we didn't

1202
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:51,919
that there's a lot of stuff we didn't
 

1203
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,310
that there's a lot of stuff we didn't
know about viruses um and about the way

1204
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:54,320
know about viruses um and about the way
 

1205
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,190
know about viruses um and about the way
immunity works and so on and um it's you

1206
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:57,200
immunity works and so on and um it's you
 

1207
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,470
immunity works and so on and um it's you
know I think what will come out in in

1208
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:58,480
know I think what will come out in in
 

1209
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,110
know I think what will come out in in
the end is there's a certain amount of

1210
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:00,120
the end is there's a certain amount of
 

1211
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,830
the end is there's a certain amount of
of what happens that way you just kind

1212
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:02,840
of what happens that way you just kind
 

1213
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,870
of what happens that way you just kind
of have to trace each step and see what

1214
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:04,880
of have to trace each step and see what
 

1215
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,710
of have to trace each step and see what
happens there's a certain amount of

1216
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:06,720
happens there's a certain amount of
 

1217
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,789
happens there's a certain amount of
stuff where there's going to be a big

1218
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:07,799
stuff where there's going to be a big
 

1219
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:10,590
stuff where there's going to be a big
narrative about this happened because

1220
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:10,600
narrative about this happened because
 

1221
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,750
narrative about this happened because
you know of te- cell immunity this

1222
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:12,760
you know of te- cell immunity this
 

1223
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,950
you know of te- cell immunity this
happened because there's this whole

1224
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:13,960
happened because there's this whole
 

1225
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,029
happened because there's this whole
giant sort of field of of of

1226
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:16,039
giant sort of field of of of
 

1227
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:18,669
giant sort of field of of of
asymptomatic viral stuff out there you

1228
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:18,679
asymptomatic viral stuff out there you
 

1229
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:20,470
asymptomatic viral stuff out there you
know there will be a narrative and that

1230
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:20,480
know there will be a narrative and that
 

1231
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,390
know there will be a narrative and that
narrative whenever there's a narrative

1232
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:22,400
narrative whenever there's a narrative
 

1233
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,669
narrative whenever there's a narrative
that's kind of a sign of reducibility

1234
00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:24,679
that's kind of a sign of reducibility
 

1235
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:26,669
that's kind of a sign of reducibility
but when you just say let's from first

1236
00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:26,679
but when you just say let's from first
 

1237
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:28,950
but when you just say let's from first
principles figure out what's going on

1238
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:28,960
principles figure out what's going on
 

1239
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,950
principles figure out what's going on
then you can potentially be stuck in

1240
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:30,960
then you can potentially be stuck in
 

1241
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,630
then you can potentially be stuck in
this kind of uh mess of irreducibility

1242
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:33,640
this kind of uh mess of irreducibility
 

1243
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,950
this kind of uh mess of irreducibility
where you just have to simulate each

1244
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:34,960
where you just have to simulate each
 

1245
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,830
where you just have to simulate each
step and you can't do that unless you

1246
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:36,840
step and you can't do that unless you
 

1247
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,950
step and you can't do that unless you
know details about you know human

1248
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:38,960
know details about you know human
 

1249
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,750
know details about you know human
interaction networks and so on and so on

1250
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:40,760
interaction networks and so on and so on
 

1251
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,430
interaction networks and so on and so on
and so on the thing that has has been

1252
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:43,440
and so on the thing that has has been
 

1253
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,750
and so on the thing that has has been
very sort of frustrating to see is the

1254
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:46,760
very sort of frustrating to see is the
 

1255
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,830
very sort of frustrating to see is the
mismatch between people's expectations

1256
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:48,840
mismatch between people's expectations
 

1257
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,070
mismatch between people's expectations
about what science can deliver and what

1258
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:51,080
about what science can deliver and what
 

1259
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,510
about what science can deliver and what
science can actually deliver so to speak

1260
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:53,520
science can actually deliver so to speak
 

1261
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,190
science can actually deliver so to speak
um because people have this idea that

1262
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:55,200
um because people have this idea that
 

1263
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,510
um because people have this idea that
you know it's science so there must be a

1264
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:57,520
you know it's science so there must be a
 

1265
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,149
you know it's science so there must be a
definite answer and we must be able to

1266
00:24:59,149 --> 00:24:59,159
definite answer and we must be able to
 

1267
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:02,149
definite answer and we must be able to
know that answer and you know this is it

1268
00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:02,159
know that answer and you know this is it
 

1269
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,909
know that answer and you know this is it
is both uh uh you know that when you

1270
00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:05,919
is both uh uh you know that when you
 

1271
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,190
is both uh uh you know that when you
after you've played around with sort of

1272
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:08,200
after you've played around with sort of
 

1273
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,590
after you've played around with sort of
little programs in the computational

1274
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:09,600
little programs in the computational
 

1275
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,149
little programs in the computational
universe you don't have that intuition

1276
00:25:11,149 --> 00:25:11,159
universe you don't have that intuition
 

1277
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:13,430
universe you don't have that intuition
anymore you know it's it's I always I'm

1278
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:13,440
anymore you know it's it's I always I'm
 

1279
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,669
anymore you know it's it's I always I'm
always fond of saying you know the the

1280
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:15,679
always fond of saying you know the the
 

1281
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,310
always fond of saying you know the the
the the computational animals are always

1282
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:17,320
the the computational animals are always
 

1283
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,149
the the computational animals are always
smarter than you are that is you know

1284
00:25:19,149 --> 00:25:19,159
smarter than you are that is you know
 

1285
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:20,389
smarter than you are that is you know
you look at one of these things and it's

1286
00:25:20,389 --> 00:25:20,399
you look at one of these things and it's
 

1287
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:22,350
you look at one of these things and it's
like it can't possibly do such and such

1288
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:22,360
like it can't possibly do such and such
 

1289
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,710
like it can't possibly do such and such
a thing then you run it and it's like

1290
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:24,720
a thing then you run it and it's like
 

1291
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,310
a thing then you run it and it's like
wait a minute it's doing that thing how

1292
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:26,320
wait a minute it's doing that thing how
 

1293
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,430
wait a minute it's doing that thing how
does that work okay now I can go back

1294
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:28,440
does that work okay now I can go back
 

1295
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,269
does that work okay now I can go back
can understand it but that's the brave

1296
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:30,279
can understand it but that's the brave
 

1297
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:33,350
can understand it but that's the brave
thing about science is that in the chaos

1298
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:33,360
thing about science is that in the chaos
 

1299
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,990
thing about science is that in the chaos
of the irreducible universe we

1300
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,000
of the irreducible universe we
 

1301
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,110
of the irreducible universe we
nevertheless persist to find those

1302
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:38,120
nevertheless persist to find those
 

1303
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,310
nevertheless persist to find those
pockets that's kind of the whole point

1304
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:40,320
pockets that's kind of the whole point
 

1305
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,470
pockets that's kind of the whole point
that's like you say that the limits of

1306
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:42,480
that's like you say that the limits of
 

1307
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,029
that's like you say that the limits of
science but that you know yes it's

1308
00:25:46,029 --> 00:25:46,039
science but that you know yes it's
 

1309
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:48,070
science but that you know yes it's
highly limited but there there's a hope

1310
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:48,080
highly limited but there there's a hope
 

1311
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,990
highly limited but there there's a hope
there and like there there's so many

1312
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:51,000
there and like there there's so many
 

1313
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,470
there and like there there's so many
questions I want to ask here so one you

1314
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:52,480
questions I want to ask here so one you
 

1315
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,630
questions I want to ask here so one you
said narrative which is really

1316
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:53,640
said narrative which is really
 

1317
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,669
said narrative which is really
interesting so obviously from uh at

1318
00:25:56,669 --> 00:25:56,679
interesting so obviously from uh at
 

1319
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:58,470
interesting so obviously from uh at
every level of society you look at

1320
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:58,480
every level of society you look at
 

1321
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,870
every level of society you look at
Twitter everybody's constructing

1322
00:25:59,870 --> 00:25:59,880
Twitter everybody's constructing
 

1323
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,310
Twitter everybody's constructing
narratives about the pandemic about not

1324
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:02,320
narratives about the pandemic about not
 

1325
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,590
narratives about the pandemic about not
just the pandemic but all the cultural

1326
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:04,600
just the pandemic but all the cultural
 

1327
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,190
just the pandemic but all the cultural
tension that we're going through so

1328
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:06,200
tension that we're going through so
 

1329
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,870
tension that we're going through so
there's narratives but they're not

1330
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:07,880
there's narratives but they're not
 

1331
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,669
there's narratives but they're not
necessarily connected to the

1332
00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:12,679
necessarily connected to the
 

1333
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:17,590
necessarily connected to the
underlying reality of these systems so

1334
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:17,600
underlying reality of these systems so
 

1335
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,310
underlying reality of these systems so
our human narratives I don't even know

1336
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:20,320
our human narratives I don't even know
 

1337
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,470
our human narratives I don't even know
if

1338
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:21,480
if
 

1339
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,350
if
they're I don't like those pockets of

1340
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:24,360
they're I don't like those pockets of
 

1341
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,430
they're I don't like those pockets of
reducibility Cu we're uh it's like

1342
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:28,440
reducibility Cu we're uh it's like
 

1343
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,950
reducibility Cu we're uh it's like
constructing things that are not

1344
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:29,960
constructing things that are not
 

1345
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,909
constructing things that are not
actually representative of

1346
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:31,919
actually representative of
 

1347
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,070
actually representative of
reality well and thereby not giving us

1348
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:35,080
reality well and thereby not giving us
 

1349
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,470
reality well and thereby not giving us
like good solutions to how to predict

1350
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:38,480
like good solutions to how to predict
 

1351
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,750
like good solutions to how to predict
the system look it it gets complicated

1352
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:40,760
the system look it it gets complicated
 

1353
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,470
the system look it it gets complicated
because you know people want to say

1354
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:42,480
because you know people want to say
 

1355
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,389
because you know people want to say
explain the pandemic to me explain

1356
00:26:44,389 --> 00:26:44,399
explain the pandemic to me explain
 

1357
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:46,070
explain the pandemic to me explain
what's going to happen in the future

1358
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:46,080
what's going to happen in the future
 

1359
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,230
what's going to happen in the future
like yes but but also can you explain it

1360
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:48,240
like yes but but also can you explain it
 

1361
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,190
like yes but but also can you explain it
is there a story to tell what already

1362
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:50,200
is there a story to tell what already
 

1363
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,669
is there a story to tell what already
happened in the past yeah what's going

1364
00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:52,679
happened in the past yeah what's going
 

1365
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:54,350
happened in the past yeah what's going
to happen but I mean in you know it's

1366
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:54,360
to happen but I mean in you know it's
 

1367
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,750
to happen but I mean in you know it's
similar to sort of explaining things in

1368
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:56,760
similar to sort of explaining things in
 

1369
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,830
similar to sort of explaining things in
AI or in any computational system it's

1370
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:58,840
AI or in any computational system it's
 

1371
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,990
AI or in any computational system it's
like like you know explain what happened

1372
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:01,000
like like you know explain what happened
 

1373
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,029
like like you know explain what happened
well it could just be this happened

1374
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:03,039
well it could just be this happened
 

1375
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,430
well it could just be this happened
because of this detail and this detail

1376
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:04,440
because of this detail and this detail
 

1377
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,830
because of this detail and this detail
and this detail and a million details

1378
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:06,840
and this detail and a million details
 

1379
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,630
and this detail and a million details
and there isn't a big story to tell

1380
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:08,640
and there isn't a big story to tell
 

1381
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,149
and there isn't a big story to tell
there's no kind of Big Arc of the story

1382
00:27:11,149 --> 00:27:11,159
there's no kind of Big Arc of the story
 

1383
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:13,190
there's no kind of Big Arc of the story
that says oh it's because you know

1384
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:13,200
that says oh it's because you know
 

1385
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,070
that says oh it's because you know
there's a viral field that has these

1386
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:15,080
there's a viral field that has these
 

1387
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,789
there's a viral field that has these
properties and people start showing

1388
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:16,799
properties and people start showing
 

1389
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,590
properties and people start showing
symptoms you know when when the seasons

1390
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:19,600
symptoms you know when when the seasons
 

1391
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,110
symptoms you know when when the seasons
change people will show symptoms and

1392
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,120
change people will show symptoms and
 

1393
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,430
change people will show symptoms and
people don't even understand you know

1394
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:22,440
people don't even understand you know
 

1395
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,669
people don't even understand you know
seasonal variation of flu for example

1396
00:27:24,669 --> 00:27:24,679
seasonal variation of flu for example
 

1397
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:27,830
seasonal variation of flu for example
it's a it's a um uh it's something where

1398
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:27,840
it's a it's a um uh it's something where
 

1399
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,310
it's a it's a um uh it's something where
where you know that that could be a big

1400
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:29,320
where you know that that could be a big
 

1401
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,510
where you know that that could be a big
story or it could be just a zillion

1402
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:31,520
story or it could be just a zillion
 

1403
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,029
story or it could be just a zillion
little details that that mount up see

1404
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:34,039
little details that that mount up see
 

1405
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:36,789
little details that that mount up see
but okay let's let's uh pretend that

1406
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:36,799
but okay let's let's uh pretend that
 

1407
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,070
but okay let's let's uh pretend that
this pandemic like the Corona virus

1408
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:40,080
this pandemic like the Corona virus
 

1409
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,029
this pandemic like the Corona virus
resembles something like the

1410
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:42,039
resembles something like the
 

1411
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:46,870
resembles something like the
1D rule 30 cellular aoma okay so I mean

1412
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:46,880
1D rule 30 cellular aoma okay so I mean
 

1413
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,710
1D rule 30 cellular aoma okay so I mean
that's how

1414
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:48,720
that's how
 

1415
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,830
that's how
epidemiologists model virus spread

1416
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:51,840
epidemiologists model virus spread
 

1417
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,430
epidemiologists model virus spread
indeed yes sometimes use cellometer yes

1418
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:54,440
indeed yes sometimes use cellometer yes
 

1419
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,630
indeed yes sometimes use cellometer yes
yes and okay so you can say it's

1420
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:56,640
yes and okay so you can say it's
 

1421
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,750
yes and okay so you can say it's
simplistic but okay let's say it it is

1422
00:27:59,750 --> 00:27:59,760
simplistic but okay let's say it it is
 

1423
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,149
simplistic but okay let's say it it is
it's representative of actually what

1424
00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:01,159
it's representative of actually what
 

1425
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:06,230
it's representative of actually what
happens uh you know the the dynamic of

1426
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:06,240
happens uh you know the the dynamic of
 

1427
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,269
happens uh you know the the dynamic of
you have a graph it probably is closer

1428
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:08,279
you have a graph it probably is closer
 

1429
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:10,590
you have a graph it probably is closer
to the hypergraph uh model is yes it's

1430
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:10,600
to the hypergraph uh model is yes it's
 

1431
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,110
to the hypergraph uh model is yes it's
it's actually that's another funny thing

1432
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:13,120
it's actually that's another funny thing
 

1433
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,509
it's actually that's another funny thing
as as we were getting ready to release

1434
00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:14,519
as as we were getting ready to release
 

1435
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:16,029
as as we were getting ready to release
this physics project we realized that a

1436
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:16,039
this physics project we realized that a
 

1437
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:17,789
this physics project we realized that a
bunch of things we'd worked out about

1438
00:28:17,789 --> 00:28:17,799
bunch of things we'd worked out about
 

1439
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:20,149
bunch of things we'd worked out about
about foliations of causal graphs and

1440
00:28:20,149 --> 00:28:20,159
about foliations of causal graphs and
 

1441
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,870
about foliations of causal graphs and
things were directly relevant to

1442
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:21,880
things were directly relevant to
 

1443
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,389
things were directly relevant to
thinking about contact tracing and

1444
00:28:24,389 --> 00:28:24,399
thinking about contact tracing and
 

1445
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:25,990
thinking about contact tracing and
interaction of cell phones and so on

1446
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:26,000
interaction of cell phones and so on
 

1447
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,149
interaction of cell phones and so on
which is really weird but like it just

1448
00:28:28,149 --> 00:28:28,159
which is really weird but like it just
 

1449
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,389
which is really weird but like it just
feels like uh it feels like we should be

1450
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:30,399
feels like uh it feels like we should be
 

1451
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,990
feels like uh it feels like we should be
able to get some beautiful core insight

1452
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:33,000
able to get some beautiful core insight
 

1453
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,909
able to get some beautiful core insight
about the spread of this particular

1454
00:28:35,909 --> 00:28:35,919
about the spread of this particular
 

1455
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,750
about the spread of this particular
virus on the hypergraph of human

1456
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:38,760
virus on the hypergraph of human
 

1457
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,269
virus on the hypergraph of human
civilization right they I tried I didn't

1458
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:41,279
civilization right they I tried I didn't
 

1459
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,509
civilization right they I tried I didn't
I didn't manage to figure it out but

1460
00:28:42,509 --> 00:28:42,519
I didn't manage to figure it out but
 

1461
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:44,590
I didn't manage to figure it out but
you're one person yeah but I mean I

1462
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:44,600
you're one person yeah but I mean I
 

1463
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,190
you're one person yeah but I mean I
think actually it's a funny thing

1464
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:46,200
think actually it's a funny thing
 

1465
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,950
think actually it's a funny thing
because it turns out the um the main

1466
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:47,960
because it turns out the um the main
 

1467
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,470
because it turns out the um the main
model you know this sir model I I only

1468
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:50,480
model you know this sir model I I only
 

1469
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,389
model you know this sir model I I only
realized recently was invented by the

1470
00:28:52,389 --> 00:28:52,399
realized recently was invented by the
 

1471
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,310
realized recently was invented by the
the grandfather of a good friend of mine

1472
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:54,320
the grandfather of a good friend of mine
 

1473
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,789
the grandfather of a good friend of mine
from high school so that was just a you

1474
00:28:56,789 --> 00:28:56,799
from high school so that was just a you
 

1475
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,070
from high school so that was just a you
know it's a weird thing right the

1476
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,080
know it's a weird thing right the
 

1477
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,950
know it's a weird thing right the
question is you know okay so you know

1478
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:01,960
question is you know okay so you know
 

1479
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,909
question is you know okay so you know
you know on this graph of how humans are

1480
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:03,919
you know on this graph of how humans are
 

1481
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,509
you know on this graph of how humans are
connected you know something about what

1482
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:05,519
connected you know something about what
 

1483
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:07,630
connected you know something about what
happens if this happens and that happens

1484
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:07,640
happens if this happens and that happens
 

1485
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,710
happens if this happens and that happens
that graph is made in complicated ways

1486
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:09,720
that graph is made in complicated ways
 

1487
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,590
that graph is made in complicated ways
that depends on on all sorts of issues

1488
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:11,600
that depends on on all sorts of issues
 

1489
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,389
that depends on on all sorts of issues
that where we don't have the data about

1490
00:29:13,389 --> 00:29:13,399
that where we don't have the data about
 

1491
00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:15,310
that where we don't have the data about
how Human Society works well enough to

1492
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:15,320
how Human Society works well enough to
 

1493
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,430
how Human Society works well enough to
be able to make that graph there's

1494
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:17,440
be able to make that graph there's
 

1495
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,110
be able to make that graph there's
actually um uh one of my kids did a

1496
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:20,120
actually um uh one of my kids did a
 

1497
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,750
actually um uh one of my kids did a
study of sort of what happens on

1498
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:21,760
study of sort of what happens on
 

1499
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,310
study of sort of what happens on
different kinds of graphs and how robust

1500
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:24,320
different kinds of graphs and how robust
 

1501
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,230
different kinds of graphs and how robust
are the results okay his basic answer is

1502
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:27,240
are the results okay his basic answer is
 

1503
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,990
are the results okay his basic answer is
there are few General results that you

1504
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:29,000
there are few General results that you
 

1505
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,590
there are few General results that you
can get that are quite robust like you

1506
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:31,600
can get that are quite robust like you
 

1507
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,230
can get that are quite robust like you
know a small number of big gatherings is

1508
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:33,240
know a small number of big gatherings is
 

1509
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,909
know a small number of big gatherings is
worse than a large number of small

1510
00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:34,919
worse than a large number of small
 

1511
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:38,029
worse than a large number of small
Gatherings okay that's quite robust but

1512
00:29:38,029 --> 00:29:38,039
Gatherings okay that's quite robust but
 

1513
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:40,350
Gatherings okay that's quite robust but
when you ask more detailed questions it

1514
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:40,360
when you ask more detailed questions it
 

1515
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,509
when you ask more detailed questions it
seemed like it just depends it depends

1516
00:29:43,509 --> 00:29:43,519
seemed like it just depends it depends
 

1517
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:45,149
seemed like it just depends it depends
on details in other words it's kind of

1518
00:29:45,149 --> 00:29:45,159
on details in other words it's kind of
 

1519
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:47,830
on details in other words it's kind of
telling you in that case you know the

1520
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:47,840
telling you in that case you know the
 

1521
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,110
telling you in that case you know the
irreducibility matters so to speak it's

1522
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:50,120
irreducibility matters so to speak it's
 

1523
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,470
irreducibility matters so to speak it's
not there's not going to be this kind of

1524
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:52,480
not there's not going to be this kind of
 

1525
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,269
not there's not going to be this kind of
one sort of Master theorem that says and

1526
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:55,279
one sort of Master theorem that says and
 

1527
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,310
one sort of Master theorem that says and
therefore this is how things are going

1528
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:56,320
therefore this is how things are going
 

1529
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,630
therefore this is how things are going
to work yeah but the there's a certain

1530
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:58,640
to work yeah but the there's a certain
 

1531
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,549
to work yeah but the there's a certain
kind of from a graph

1532
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:00,559
kind of from a graph
 

1533
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,669
kind of from a graph
perspective the certain kind of dynamic

1534
00:30:02,669 --> 00:30:02,679
perspective the certain kind of dynamic
 

1535
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:03,710
perspective the certain kind of dynamic
to human

1536
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:03,720
to human
 

1537
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,990
to human
interaction so like large groups and

1538
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:07,000
interaction so like large groups and
 

1539
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,870
interaction so like large groups and
small groups I think it matters who the

1540
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:09,880
small groups I think it matters who the
 

1541
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,269
small groups I think it matters who the
groups are for example you could imagine

1542
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:12,279
groups are for example you could imagine
 

1543
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:14,190
groups are for example you could imagine
large depends how you define large but

1544
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:14,200
large depends how you define large but
 

1545
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,230
large depends how you define large but
you can imagine groups of 30

1546
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:16,240
you can imagine groups of 30
 

1547
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,230
you can imagine groups of 30
people as long like as long as they are

1548
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:20,240
people as long like as long as they are
 

1549
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,230
people as long like as long as they are
uh cleaks or whatever like right as as

1550
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:23,240
uh cleaks or whatever like right as as
 

1551
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,110
uh cleaks or whatever like right as as
long as the outgoing degree of that

1552
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:26,120
long as the outgoing degree of that
 

1553
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,190
long as the outgoing degree of that
graph is small or something like like

1554
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:28,200
graph is small or something like like
 

1555
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,350
graph is small or something like like
that like you can imagine some beautiful

1556
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:30,360
that like you can imagine some beautiful
 

1557
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,630
that like you can imagine some beautiful
underlying rule of human Dynamic

1558
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:32,640
underlying rule of human Dynamic
 

1559
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,509

lot to me in my life and then stay away

1566
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:40,480
lot to me in my life and then stay away
 

1567
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,909
lot to me in my life and then stay away
from the bigger I don't know not going

1568
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:42,919
from the bigger I don't know not going
 

1569
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:44,830
from the bigger I don't know not going
to Miley Cyrus concert or something like

1570
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:44,840
to Miley Cyrus concert or something like
 

1571
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,630
to Miley Cyrus concert or something like
that and and figuring out mathematically

1572
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:48,640
that and and figuring out mathematically
 

1573
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,789
that and and figuring out mathematically
some nice see this is an interesting

1574
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:50,799
some nice see this is an interesting
 

1575
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,830
some nice see this is an interesting
thing so I mean in you know this is the

1576
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:52,840
thing so I mean in you know this is the
 

1577
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,110
thing so I mean in you know this is the
question of what you're describing as

1578
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:55,120
question of what you're describing as
 

1579
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,509
question of what you're describing as
kind of uh the problem of

1580
00:30:58,509 --> 00:30:58,519
kind of uh the problem of
 

1581
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:00,110
kind of uh the problem of
many situations where you would like to

1582
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:00,120
many situations where you would like to
 

1583
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,230
many situations where you would like to
get away from computational

1584
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:01,240
get away from computational
 

1585
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,549
get away from computational
irreducibility a classic one in physics

irreducibility a classic one in physics
 

1587
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:05,629
irreducibility a classic one in physics
is thermodynamics the you know the

1588
00:31:05,629 --> 00:31:05,639
is thermodynamics the you know the
 

1589
00:31:05,639 --> 00:31:07,110
is thermodynamics the you know the
second law of Thermodynamics the law

1590
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:07,120
second law of Thermodynamics the law
 

1591
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,509
second law of Thermodynamics the law
that says you know entropy tends to

00:31:08,509 --> 00:31:08,519
that says you know entropy tends to
 

1593
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:10,950
that says you know entropy tends to
increase things that you know start

1594
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:10,960
increase things that you know start
 

1595
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,470

which is also the thing that says given
 

1599
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,190
which is also the thing that says given
that you have a bunch of heat it's hard

1600
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:17,200
that you have a bunch of heat it's hard

thing out of it I want to kind of
 

1657
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,830
thing out of it I want to kind of
extract from the heat of what's

useful piece of sort of mechanical work
 

1663
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,110
useful piece of sort of mechanical work
that I find helpful I mean do you have a

1664
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:26,120
that I find helpful I mean do you have a
 

1665
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,990
that I find helpful I mean do you have a
hope for the pandemic so we'll talk

1666
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:28,000
hope for the pandemic so we'll talk
 

1667
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,110
hope for the pandemic so we'll talk
about physics but for the pandemic can

1668
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:30,120
about physics but for the pandemic can
 

1669
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,269
about physics but for the pandemic can
that be extracted do you think what's

1670
00:32:32,269 --> 00:32:32,279
that be extracted do you think what's
 

1671
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:34,590
that be extracted do you think what's
your intuition the good news is the

1672
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:34,600
your intuition the good news is the
 

1673
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,110
your intuition the good news is the
curves basically you know for reasons we

1674
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:37,120
curves basically you know for reasons we
 

1675
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,950
curves basically you know for reasons we
don't understand the curves you know the

1676
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:39,960
don't understand the curves you know the
 

1677
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,110
don't understand the curves you know the
the the clearly measurable mortality

1678
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:42,120
the the clearly measurable mortality
 

1679
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,350
the the clearly measurable mortality
curves and so on for the Northern

1680
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:44,360
curves and so on for the Northern
 

1681
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,830
curves and so on for the Northern
Hemisphere have gone down yeah but the

1682
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:46,840
Hemisphere have gone down yeah but the
 

1683
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,269
Hemisphere have gone down yeah but the
bad news is that it could be a lot worse

1684
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:50,279
bad news is that it could be a lot worse
 

1685
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:52,310
bad news is that it could be a lot worse
for future viruses and what this

1686
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:52,320
for future viruses and what this
 

1687
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,149
for future viruses and what this
pandemic revealed is we're highly

1688
00:32:54,149 --> 00:32:54,159
pandemic revealed is we're highly
 

1689
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,110
pandemic revealed is we're highly
unprepared for the dis discovery of the

1690
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:58,120
unprepared for the dis discovery of the
 

1691
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,269

pockets of reducibility within a
 

1693
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:02,950
pockets of reducibility within a
pandemic that's much more dangerous well

1694
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:02,960
pandemic that's much more dangerous well
 

1695
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,669
pandemic that's much more dangerous well
my my guess is the specific risk of you

1696
00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:05,679
my my guess is the specific risk of you
 

1697
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,950
my my guess is the specific risk of you
know viral pandemics you know that the

1698
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:08,960
know viral pandemics you know that the
 

1699
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,870
know viral pandemics you know that the
pure virology and you know Immunology of

1700
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:11,880
pure virology and you know Immunology of
 

1701
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,909
pure virology and you know Immunology of
the thing this will cause that to

1702
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:13,919
the thing this will cause that to
 

1703
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,149
the thing this will cause that to
advance to the point where this

1704
00:33:15,149 --> 00:33:15,159
advance to the point where this
 

1705
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:18,110
advance to the point where this
particular risk is probably considerably

1706
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:18,120
particular risk is probably considerably
 

1707
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,389
particular risk is probably considerably
mitigated but you know it's uh you know

1708
00:33:21,389 --> 00:33:21,399
mitigated but you know it's uh you know
 

1709
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:23,909
mitigated but you know it's uh you know
does is is the structure of modern

1710
00:33:23,909 --> 00:33:23,919
does is is the structure of modern
 

1711
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,029
does is is the structure of modern
society robust to all kinds of risks

1712
00:33:27,029 --> 00:33:27,039
society robust to all kinds of risks
 

1713
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,590
society robust to all kinds of risks
well the answer is clearly no and you

1714
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:29,600
well the answer is clearly no and you
 

1715
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,789
well the answer is clearly no and you
know it's it's surprising to me the

1716
00:33:31,789 --> 00:33:31,799
know it's it's surprising to me the
 

1717
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:34,350
know it's it's surprising to me the
extent to which people uh you know as I

1718
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:34,360
extent to which people uh you know as I
 

1719
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,710
extent to which people uh you know as I
say it's it's a it's kind of scary

1720
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:36,720
say it's it's a it's kind of scary
 

1721
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,509
say it's it's a it's kind of scary
actually how much people believe in

1722
00:33:38,509 --> 00:33:38,519
actually how much people believe in
 

1723
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:41,590
actually how much people believe in
science that is people say oh you know

1724
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:41,600
science that is people say oh you know
 

1725
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,909
science that is people say oh you know
because the science does this that and

1726
00:33:42,909 --> 00:33:42,919
because the science does this that and
 

1727
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:44,070
because the science does this that and
the other we'll do this and this and

1728
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:44,080
the other we'll do this and this and
 

1729
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,149
the other we'll do this and this and
this even though from a sort of Common

1730
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:46,159
this even though from a sort of Common
 

1731
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,509
this even though from a sort of Common
Sense point of view it's a little bit

1732
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:47,519
Sense point of view it's a little bit
 

1733
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,389
Sense point of view it's a little bit
crazy and and people are not prepared

1734
00:33:50,389 --> 00:33:50,399
crazy and and people are not prepared
 

1735
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,549
crazy and and people are not prepared
and it doesn't really work in in society

1736
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:52,559
and it doesn't really work in in society
 

1737
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,310
and it doesn't really work in in society
as it is for people to say well actually

1738
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:54,320
as it is for people to say well actually
 

1739
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,789
as it is for people to say well actually
we don't really know how the science

1740
00:33:55,789 --> 00:33:55,799
we don't really know how the science
 

1741
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:58,669
we don't really know how the science
Works people say well tell us what to do

1742
00:33:58,669 --> 00:33:58,679
Works people say well tell us what to do
 

1743
00:33:58,679 --> 00:33:59,990
Works people say well tell us what to do
yeah because then yeah what's the

1744
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:00,000
yeah because then yeah what's the
 

1745
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,350
yeah because then yeah what's the
alternative the for the masses it's

1746
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:03,360
alternative the for the masses it's
 

1747
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,830
alternative the for the masses it's
difficult to sit it's difficult to

1748
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:05,840
difficult to sit it's difficult to
 

1749
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,550
difficult to sit it's difficult to
meditate on computational reducibility

1750
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:08,560
meditate on computational reducibility
 

1751
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,109
meditate on computational reducibility
it's difficult to sit it's difficult to

1752
00:34:11,109 --> 00:34:11,119
it's difficult to sit it's difficult to
 

1753
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,109
it's difficult to sit it's difficult to
enjoy a good dinner meal while while

1754
00:34:14,109 --> 00:34:14,119
enjoy a good dinner meal while while
 

1755
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,389
enjoy a good dinner meal while while
knowing that you know nothing about the

1756
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:15,399
knowing that you know nothing about the
 

1757
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:17,349
knowing that you know nothing about the
world I think this is a this is a place

1758
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:17,359
world I think this is a this is a place
 

1759
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,030
world I think this is a this is a place
where you know this is this is what

1760
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:19,040
where you know this is this is what
 

1761
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,629
where you know this is this is what
politicians you know and political

1762
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:20,639
politicians you know and political
 

1763
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,069
politicians you know and political
leaders do for a living so to speak

1764
00:34:22,069 --> 00:34:22,079
leaders do for a living so to speak
 

1765
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,710
leaders do for a living so to speak
because you got to make some decision

1766
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:23,720
because you got to make some decision
 

1767
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,310
because you got to make some decision
about what to do and it's um tell some

1768
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:26,320
about what to do and it's um tell some
 

1769
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,349
about what to do and it's um tell some
narrative that uh

1770
00:34:28,349 --> 00:34:28,359
narrative that uh
 

1771
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:30,629
narrative that uh
while amidst the mystery and knowing not

1772
00:34:30,629 --> 00:34:30,639
while amidst the mystery and knowing not
 

1773
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,790
while amidst the mystery and knowing not
much about the the past or the future

1774
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:33,800
much about the the past or the future
 

1775
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,430
much about the the past or the future
still telling a narrative that somehow

1776
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:36,440
still telling a narrative that somehow
 

1777
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,829
still telling a narrative that somehow
gives people hope that we know what the

1778
00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:37,839
gives people hope that we know what the
 

1779
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,310
gives people hope that we know what the
heck we're doing yeah get Society

1780
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:40,320
heck we're doing yeah get Society
 

1781
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,629
heck we're doing yeah get Society
through the issue you know even even

1782
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:42,639
through the issue you know even even
 

1783
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,349
through the issue you know even even
though you know the idea that we're just

1784
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:44,359
though you know the idea that we're just
 

1785
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:46,669
though you know the idea that we're just
going to you know sort of be able to get

1786
00:34:46,669 --> 00:34:46,679
going to you know sort of be able to get
 

1787
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,669
going to you know sort of be able to get
the definitive answer from science and

1788
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:48,679
the definitive answer from science and
 

1789
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,829
the definitive answer from science and
it's going to tell us exactly what to do

1790
00:34:50,829 --> 00:34:50,839
it's going to tell us exactly what to do
 

1791
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:53,909
it's going to tell us exactly what to do
unfortunately you know uh that it's

1792
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:53,919
unfortunately you know uh that it's
 

1793
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:55,669
unfortunately you know uh that it's
interesting because let me point out

1794
00:34:55,669 --> 00:34:55,679
interesting because let me point out
 

1795
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,310
interesting because let me point out
that if that was possible if science

1796
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:57,320
that if that was possible if science
 

1797
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,910
that if that was possible if science
could always tell us what to do then in

1798
00:34:59,910 --> 00:34:59,920
could always tell us what to do then in
 

1799
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,550
could always tell us what to do then in
a sense our you know that would be a big

1800
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:02,560
a sense our you know that would be a big
 

1801
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,589
a sense our you know that would be a big
Downer for our lives if science could

1802
00:35:04,589 --> 00:35:04,599
Downer for our lives if science could
 

1803
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:05,870
Downer for our lives if science could
always tell us what the answer is going

1804
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:05,880
always tell us what the answer is going
 

1805
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,950
always tell us what the answer is going
to be it's like well you know it's kind

1806
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:08,960
to be it's like well you know it's kind
 

1807
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,510
to be it's like well you know it's kind
of fun to live one's life and just sort

1808
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:10,520
of fun to live one's life and just sort
 

1809
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,550
of fun to live one's life and just sort
of see what happens if one could always

1810
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:12,560
of see what happens if one could always
 

1811
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,109
of see what happens if one could always
just say Let me let me check my science

1812
00:35:15,109 --> 00:35:15,119
just say Let me let me check my science
 

1813
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,270
just say Let me let me check my science
oh I know you know the result of

1814
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:17,280
oh I know you know the result of
 

1815
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,550
oh I know you know the result of
everything is going to be 42 I don't

1816
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:18,560
everything is going to be 42 I don't
 

1817
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,069
everything is going to be 42 I don't
need to live my life and do what I do

1818
00:35:21,069 --> 00:35:21,079
need to live my life and do what I do
 

1819
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:23,030
need to live my life and do what I do
it's just we already know the answer

1820
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:23,040
it's just we already know the answer
 

1821
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,030
it's just we already know the answer
it's actually good news in a sense that

1822
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:25,040
it's actually good news in a sense that
 

1823
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,069
it's actually good news in a sense that
there is this phenomenon of

1824
00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:26,079
there is this phenomenon of
 

1825
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,870
there is this phenomenon of
computational irreducibility that

1826
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:27,880
computational irreducibility that
 

1827
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,510
computational irreducibility that
doesn't allow you to just sort of jump

1828
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:29,520
doesn't allow you to just sort of jump
 

1829
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,150
doesn't allow you to just sort of jump
through time and say this is the answer

1830
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:32,160
through time and say this is the answer
 

1831
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,630
through time and say this is the answer
so to speak um and that's so that's a

1832
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:34,640
so to speak um and that's so that's a
 

1833
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,870
so to speak um and that's so that's a
good thing the bad thing is it doesn't

1834
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:36,880
good thing the bad thing is it doesn't
 

1835
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,390
good thing the bad thing is it doesn't
allow you to jump through time and know

1836
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:38,400
allow you to jump through time and know
 

1837
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,109
allow you to jump through time and know
what the answer is it's scary do you

1838
00:35:41,109 --> 00:35:41,119
what the answer is it's scary do you
 

1839
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,349
what the answer is it's scary do you
think we're going to be okay as a human

1840
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:43,359
think we're going to be okay as a human
 

1841
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,910
think we're going to be okay as a human
civilization you said we don't know

1842
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:46,920
civilization you said we don't know
 

1843
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,109
civilization you said we don't know
absolutely do you think it's do you

1844
00:35:49,109 --> 00:35:49,119
absolutely do you think it's do you
 

1845
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:53,630
absolutely do you think it's do you
think we'll Prosper or destroy ourselves

1846
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:53,640
think we'll Prosper or destroy ourselves
 

1847
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,430
think we'll Prosper or destroy ourselves
as a in general in general I'm an

1848
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:56,440
as a in general in general I'm an
 

1849
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,069
as a in general in general I'm an
optimist the no I think that that you

1850
00:35:59,069 --> 00:35:59,079
optimist the no I think that that you
 

1851
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:00,630
optimist the no I think that that you
know it'll be interesting to see for

1852
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:00,640
know it'll be interesting to see for
 

1853
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,990
know it'll be interesting to see for
example with this you know pandemic I

1854
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:03,000
example with this you know pandemic I
 

1855
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,510
example with this you know pandemic I
you know to

1856
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:04,520
you know to
 

1857
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,510
you know to
me you know when you look at like

1858
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:06,520
me you know when you look at like
 

1859
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,069
me you know when you look at like
organizations for example you know

1860
00:36:09,069 --> 00:36:09,079
organizations for example you know
 

1861
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:11,230
organizations for example you know
having some kind of pertubation some

1862
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:11,240
having some kind of pertubation some
 

1863
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,710
having some kind of pertubation some
kick to the system usually the end

1864
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:13,720
kick to the system usually the end
 

1865
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,069
kick to the system usually the end
result of that is actually quite good

1866
00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:16,079
result of that is actually quite good
 

1867
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,950
result of that is actually quite good
you know unless it kills the system it's

1868
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:17,960
you know unless it kills the system it's
 

1869
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,910
you know unless it kills the system it's
actually quite good usually and I think

1870
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:19,920
actually quite good usually and I think
 

1871
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,829
actually quite good usually and I think
in this case you know people I mean my

1872
00:36:22,829 --> 00:36:22,839
in this case you know people I mean my
 

1873
00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:24,309
in this case you know people I mean my
impression you know it's it's a little

1874
00:36:24,309 --> 00:36:24,319
impression you know it's it's a little
 

1875
00:36:24,319 --> 00:36:25,710
impression you know it's it's a little
weird for me because you know I've been

1876
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:25,720
weird for me because you know I've been
 

1877
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,109
weird for me because you know I've been
a remote Tech CEO for 30 years it

1878
00:36:28,109 --> 00:36:28,119
a remote Tech CEO for 30 years it
 

1879
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,390
a remote Tech CEO for 30 years it
doesn't you know this is bizarrely uh

1880
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:30,400
doesn't you know this is bizarrely uh
 

1881
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,510
doesn't you know this is bizarrely uh
you know in the fact that you know like

1882
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:32,520
you know in the fact that you know like
 

1883
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,910
you know in the fact that you know like
this coming to see you here is is one of

1884
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:34,920
this coming to see you here is is one of
 

1885
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,150
this coming to see you here is is one of
the rare moments the first time in six

1886
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:37,160
the rare moments the first time in six
 

1887
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,790
the rare moments the first time in six
months that I've been like you know in a

1888
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:39,800
months that I've been like you know in a
 

1889
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,390
months that I've been like you know in a
building other than my house okay so so

1890
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:42,400
building other than my house okay so so
 

1891
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,109
building other than my house okay so so
so you know it's I'm I'm a kind of

1892
00:36:45,109 --> 00:36:45,119
so you know it's I'm I'm a kind of
 

1893
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,750
so you know it's I'm I'm a kind of
ridiculous outlier in these kinds of

1894
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:46,760
ridiculous outlier in these kinds of
 

1895
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,470
ridiculous outlier in these kinds of
things but overall your sense is when

1896
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:49,480
things but overall your sense is when
 

1897
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,710
things but overall your sense is when
you shake up the system and throw in

1898
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:51,720
you shake up the system and throw in
 

1899
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,589
you shake up the system and throw in
chaos that you you uh challenge the

1900
00:36:54,589 --> 00:36:54,599
chaos that you you uh challenge the
 

1901
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:58,109
chaos that you you uh challenge the
system we humans emerge better seems to

1902
00:36:58,109 --> 00:36:58,119
system we humans emerge better seems to
 

1903
00:36:58,119 --> 00:36:59,950
system we humans emerge better seems to
be that way who's to know but I think

1904
00:36:59,950 --> 00:36:59,960
be that way who's to know but I think
 

1905
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,550
be that way who's to know but I think
that you know people you know my my sort

1906
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:02,560
that you know people you know my my sort
 

1907
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,270
that you know people you know my my sort
of vague impression is that people are

1908
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:04,280
of vague impression is that people are
 

1909
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,230
of vague impression is that people are
sort of you know oh what's actually

1910
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:06,240
sort of you know oh what's actually
 

1911
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,870
sort of you know oh what's actually
important you know what's uh what what

1912
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:08,880
important you know what's uh what what
 

1913
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,589
important you know what's uh what what
is worth caring about and so on and that

1914
00:37:10,589 --> 00:37:10,599
is worth caring about and so on and that
 

1915
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:13,550
is worth caring about and so on and that
seems to be something that perhaps is is

1916
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:13,560
seems to be something that perhaps is is
 

1917
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,870
seems to be something that perhaps is is
more you know emergent in this kind of

1918
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:15,880
more you know emergent in this kind of
 

1919
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,390
more you know emergent in this kind of
situation it's so fascinating that on

1920
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:18,400
situation it's so fascinating that on
 

1921
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,030
situation it's so fascinating that on
the individual level we have our own

1922
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,040
the individual level we have our own
 

1923
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,150
the individual level we have our own
complex cognition we have Consciousness

1924
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:23,160
complex cognition we have Consciousness
 

1925
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,510
complex cognition we have Consciousness
we have intelligence we're trying to

1926
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:24,520
we have intelligence we're trying to
 

1927
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,670
we have intelligence we're trying to
figure out little puzzles and then that

1928
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:26,680
figure out little puzzles and then that
 

1929
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,190
figure out little puzzles and then that
somehow creates this graph of collective

1930
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:29,200
somehow creates this graph of collective
 

1931
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,750
somehow creates this graph of collective
intelligence where we figure out and

1932
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:31,760
intelligence where we figure out and
 

1933
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,190
intelligence where we figure out and
then you throw in these viruses of which

1934
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:34,200
then you throw in these viruses of which
 

1935
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,750
then you throw in these viruses of which
there's Millions different you know this

1936
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:36,760
there's Millions different you know this
 

1937
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,950
there's Millions different you know this
entire taxonomy and the viruses are

1938
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:38,960
entire taxonomy and the viruses are
 

1939
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,309
entire taxonomy and the viruses are
thrown into the system of collective

1940
00:37:41,309 --> 00:37:41,319
thrown into the system of collective
 

1941
00:37:41,319 --> 00:37:43,790
thrown into the system of collective
human intelligence and we little humans

1942
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:43,800
human intelligence and we little humans
 

1943
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,990
human intelligence and we little humans
figure out what to do about it we get

1944
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:46,000
figure out what to do about it we get
 

1945
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,550
figure out what to do about it we get
like we Tweet stuff about information

1946
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:48,560
like we Tweet stuff about information
 

1947
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,790
like we Tweet stuff about information
there's doctors as conspiracy theorists

1948
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:50,800
there's doctors as conspiracy theorists
 

1949
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,030
there's doctors as conspiracy theorists
and then we play with different

1950
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:52,040
and then we play with different
 

1951
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,510
and then we play with different
information I mean the whole of it is

1952
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:54,520
information I mean the whole of it is
 

1953
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,510
information I mean the whole of it is
fascinating um I I like you also very

1954
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:57,520
fascinating um I I like you also very
 

1955
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,270
fascinating um I I like you also very
optimistic but uh there's a fe just you

1956
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:00,280
optimistic but uh there's a fe just you
 

1957
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,109
optimistic but uh there's a fe just you
said uh the computational

1958
00:38:03,109 --> 00:38:03,119
said uh the computational
 

1959
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,750
said uh the computational
reducibility there's always a fear of

1960
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:05,760
reducibility there's always a fear of
 

1961
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,430
reducibility there's always a fear of
the darkness of the uncertainty be

1962
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:08,440
the darkness of the uncertainty be
 

1963
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,510
the darkness of the uncertainty be
before us yeah it's scary I mean the

1964
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:11,520
before us yeah it's scary I mean the
 

1965
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,630
before us yeah it's scary I mean the
thing is if you knew everything it will

1966
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:13,640
thing is if you knew everything it will
 

1967
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,349
thing is if you knew everything it will
be

1968
00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:14,359
be
 

1969
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:17,550
be
boring and and it would be and and then

1970
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:17,560
boring and and it would be and and then
 

1971
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,270
boring and and it would be and and then
um uh and worse than boring so to speak

1972
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:20,280
um uh and worse than boring so to speak
 

1973
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,950
um uh and worse than boring so to speak
it would be you it would reveal the

1974
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:21,960
it would be you it would reveal the
 

1975
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,150
it would be you it would reveal the
pointlessness so to speak and in a sense

1976
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:25,160
pointlessness so to speak and in a sense
 

1977
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,670
pointlessness so to speak and in a sense
the the fact that there is this

1978
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:26,680
the the fact that there is this
 

1979
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,589
the the fact that there is this
computational ability it's like as we

1980
00:38:28,589 --> 00:38:28,599
computational ability it's like as we
 

1981
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:30,829
computational ability it's like as we
live our lives so to speak something is

1982
00:38:30,829 --> 00:38:30,839
live our lives so to speak something is
 

1983
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,150
live our lives so to speak something is
being achieved we're Computing what our

1984
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:33,160
being achieved we're Computing what our
 

1985
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,950
being achieved we're Computing what our
lives you know uh you know what happens

1986
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:35,960
lives you know uh you know what happens
 

1987
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,069
lives you know uh you know what happens
in our lives that's funny so the

1988
00:38:38,069 --> 00:38:38,079
in our lives that's funny so the
 

1989
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,430
in our lives that's funny so the
computation reducibility is kind of like

1990
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:40,440
computation reducibility is kind of like
 

1991
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,349
computation reducibility is kind of like
it gives the meaning to life it is the

1992
00:38:42,349 --> 00:38:42,359
it gives the meaning to life it is the
 

1993
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:44,430
it gives the meaning to life it is the
meaning of life computation reducibility

1994
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:44,440
meaning of life computation reducibility
 

1995
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,309
meaning of life computation reducibility
is the meaning of life there you go it

1996
00:38:46,309 --> 00:38:46,319
is the meaning of life there you go it
 

1997
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:48,390
is the meaning of life there you go it
it gives it meaning yes I mean it it it

1998
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:48,400
it gives it meaning yes I mean it it it
 

1999
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,950
it gives it meaning yes I mean it it it

it it's what it's what causes it to not
be something where you can just say uh

2002
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:53,200
be something where you can just say uh
 

2003
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,470
be something where you can just say uh
you know you went through all those

2004
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:54,480
you know you went through all those
 

2005
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,589
you know you went through all those
steps to live your life but we already

2006
00:38:56,589 --> 00:38:56,599
steps to live your life but we already
 

2007
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:58,710
steps to live your life but we already
knew what the answer was was right hold

sunburn unlikely this is a QA

2020
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:14,440

 

2021
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,190

moment this is a good moment okay okay

2022
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:17,200
moment this is a good moment okay okay
 

2023
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,550
moment this is a good moment okay okay
well let me just check what it thinks

2024
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:20,560
well let me just check what it thinks
 

2025
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,630
well let me just check what it thinks
see why it thinks that it doesn't seem

2026
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:22,640
see why it thinks that it doesn't seem
 

2027
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,109
see why it thinks that it doesn't seem
like my intuition this is one of these

2028
00:39:24,109 --> 00:39:24,119
like my intuition this is one of these
 

2029
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:26,550
like my intuition this is one of these
cases where we can the question is do we

2030
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:26,560
cases where we can the question is do we
 

2031
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,109
cases where we can the question is do we
do we trust the science or do we um use

2032
00:39:29,109 --> 00:39:29,119
do we trust the science or do we um use
 

2033
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,069
do we trust the science or do we um use
common sense the UV thing is cool the

2034
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:32,079
common sense the UV thing is cool the
 

2035
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,589
common sense the UV thing is cool the
yeah yeah well we'll see this is a QA

2036
00:39:33,589 --> 00:39:33,599
yeah yeah well we'll see this is a QA
 

2037
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,829
yeah yeah well we'll see this is a QA
moment as I say it's

2038
00:39:35,829 --> 00:39:35,839
moment as I say it's
 

2039
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,550
moment as I say it's
uh do we trust the product yes we trust

2040
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:38,560
uh do we trust the product yes we trust
 

2041
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,270
uh do we trust the product yes we trust
the product so and then there'll be a

2042
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:40,280
the product so and then there'll be a
 

2043
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,589
the product so and then there'll be a
data point either way if if I'm

2044
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:42,599
data point either way if if I'm
 

2045
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:44,950
data point either way if if I'm
desperately sunburned I will send in a

2046
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:44,960
desperately sunburned I will send in a
 

2047
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,750
desperately sunburned I will send in a
angry feedback because we mention the

2048
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:48,760
angry feedback because we mention the
 

2049
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,630
angry feedback because we mention the
concept so much and a lot of people know

2050
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:51,640
concept so much and a lot of people know
 

2051
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,589
concept so much and a lot of people know
it but can you say what competition

2052
00:39:53,589 --> 00:39:53,599
it but can you say what competition
 

2053
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,550
it but can you say what competition
reducibility is yeah right so I mean the

2054
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:55,560
reducibility is yeah right so I mean the
 

2055
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,790
reducibility is yeah right so I mean the
question is if you think about things

2056
00:39:58,790 --> 00:39:58,800
question is if you think about things
 

2057
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,270
question is if you think about things
that happen as being computations you

2058
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:01,280
that happen as being computations you
 

2059
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,150
that happen as being computations you
think about the uh some process in

2060
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:05,160
think about the uh some process in
 

2061
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,589
think about the uh some process in
physics something that you compute in

2062
00:40:07,589 --> 00:40:07,599
physics something that you compute in
 

2063
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,349
physics something that you compute in
mathematics whatever else it's a

2064
00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:09,359
mathematics whatever else it's a
 

2065
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:10,950
mathematics whatever else it's a
computation in the sense it has definite

2066
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:10,960
computation in the sense it has definite
 

2067
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,790
computation in the sense it has definite
rules you follow those rules you uh

2068
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:14,800
rules you follow those rules you uh
 

2069
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,349
rules you follow those rules you uh
follow them many steps and you get some

2070
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:17,359
follow them many steps and you get some
 

2071
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:20,430
follow them many steps and you get some
result so then the issue is if you look

2072
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:20,440
result so then the issue is if you look
 

2073
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,390
result so then the issue is if you look
at all these different kinds of

2074
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:21,400
at all these different kinds of
 

2075
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,950
at all these different kinds of
computations that can happen whether

2076
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:22,960
computations that can happen whether
 

2077
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,150
computations that can happen whether
they're computations that are happening

2078
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:24,160
they're computations that are happening
 

2079
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,150
they're computations that are happening
in the natural world whether they're

2080
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:25,160
in the natural world whether they're
 

2081
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,870
in the natural world whether they're
happening in our brains whether they're

2082
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:26,880
happening in our brains whether they're
 

2083
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,390
happening in our brains whether they're
happening in our mathematics whatever

2084
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:28,400
happening in our mathematics whatever
 

2085
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,270
happening in our mathematics whatever
else the big question is how do these

2086
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:30,280
else the big question is how do these
 

2087
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,190
else the big question is how do these
computations compare is are there dumb

2088
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:33,200
computations compare is are there dumb
 

2089
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,630
computations compare is are there dumb
computations and smart computations or

2090
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:35,640
computations and smart computations or
 

2091
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,790
computations and smart computations or
are they somehow all equivalent and the

2092
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:37,800
are they somehow all equivalent and the
 

2093
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,990
are they somehow all equivalent and the
thing that I kind of uh was sort of

2094
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:40,000
thing that I kind of uh was sort of
 

2095
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,349
thing that I kind of uh was sort of
surprised to realize from a bunch of

2096
00:40:42,349 --> 00:40:42,359
surprised to realize from a bunch of
 

2097
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:43,870
surprised to realize from a bunch of
experiments that I did in the early 90s

2098
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:43,880
experiments that I did in the early 90s
 

2099
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,430
experiments that I did in the early 90s
and now we have tons more evidence for

2100
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:45,440
and now we have tons more evidence for
 

2101
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,349
and now we have tons more evidence for
it this thing I call the principle of

2102
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:47,359
it this thing I call the principle of
 

2103
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,069
it this thing I call the principle of
computational equivalence which

2104
00:40:49,069 --> 00:40:49,079
computational equivalence which
 

2105
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:51,270
computational equivalence which
basically says when one of these

2106
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:51,280
basically says when one of these
 

2107
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,990
basically says when one of these
computations one of these processes that

2108
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:53,000
computations one of these processes that
 

2109
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,390
computations one of these processes that
follows rules doesn't seem like it's

2110
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:55,400
follows rules doesn't seem like it's
 

2111
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,870
follows rules doesn't seem like it's
doing something obviously simple then it

2112
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:57,880
doing something obviously simple then it
 

2113
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,030
doing something obviously simple then it
has reached the sort of equivalent level

so what has happened you know what
science has become used to doing is

have to be these Pockets scattered

00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,309
where you can jump ahead I mean one one
thing sort of a little bit of a parable

2186
00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:18,319
thing sort of a little bit of a parable
 

2187
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,030
thing sort of a little bit of a parable
type thing that I think is is fun to

2188
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:20,040
type thing that I think is is fun to
 

2189
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,510
type thing that I think is is fun to
tell you know if you look at ancient

2190
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:21,520
tell you know if you look at ancient
 

2191
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,829
tell you know if you look at ancient
Babylon they were trying to predict

2192
00:42:23,829 --> 00:42:23,839
Babylon they were trying to predict
 

2193
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,710
Babylon they were trying to predict
three kinds of things they tried to

2194
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:25,720
three kinds of things they tried to
 

2195
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,390
three kinds of things they tried to
predict you know where the planets would

2196
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:27,400
predict you know where the planets would
 

2197
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,510
predict you know where the planets would
be what the weather would be like and

2198
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:29,520
be what the weather would be like and
 

2199
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,270
be what the weather would be like and
who would win or lose a certain battle

2200
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:32,280
who would win or lose a certain battle
 

2201
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,309
who would win or lose a certain battle
and they had no idea which of these

2202
00:42:34,309 --> 00:42:34,319
and they had no idea which of these
 

2203
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:35,829
and they had no idea which of these
things would be more predictable than

2204
00:42:35,829 --> 00:42:35,839
things would be more predictable than
 

2205
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:38,030
things would be more predictable than
the other that's funny and and you know

2206
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:38,040
the other that's funny and and you know
 

2207
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,270
the other that's funny and and you know
it turns out you know where the planets

2208
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:40,280
it turns out you know where the planets
 

2209
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,670
it turns out you know where the planets
are is a is a piece of computational

2210
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:42,680
are is a is a piece of computational
 

2211
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,069
are is a is a piece of computational
reducibility that you know 300 years ago

2212
00:42:45,069 --> 00:42:45,079
reducibility that you know 300 years ago
 

2213
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:46,910
reducibility that you know 300 years ago
or so we pretty much cracked I mean it's

2214
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:46,920
or so we pretty much cracked I mean it's
 

2215
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,270
or so we pretty much cracked I mean it's
been technically difficult to get all

2216
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:48,280
been technically difficult to get all
 

2217
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,589
been technically difficult to get all
the details right but it's basically we

2218
00:42:50,589 --> 00:42:50,599
the details right but it's basically we
 

2219
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:52,710
the details right but it's basically we
we got that you know who's going to win

2220
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:52,720
we got that you know who's going to win
 

2221
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,030
we got that you know who's going to win
or lose the battle no we didn't crack

2222
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:55,040
or lose the battle no we didn't crack
 

2223
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,670
or lose the battle no we didn't crack
that one that one that one right

2224
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:57,680
that one that one that one right
 

2225
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,390
that one that one that one right
game theorist are trying and then the

2226
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:00,400
game theorist are trying and then the
 

2227
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,270
game theorist are trying and then the
weather kind of halfway on that halfway

2228
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:03,280
weather kind of halfway on that halfway
 

2229
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,750
weather kind of halfway on that halfway
yeah I think we we're doing okay at that

2230
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:04,760
yeah I think we we're doing okay at that
 

2231
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,510
yeah I think we we're doing okay at that
one I you know longterm climate

2232
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:06,520
one I you know longterm climate
 

2233
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,470
one I you know longterm climate
different story but but the weather you

2234
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:08,480
different story but but the weather you
 

2235
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,230
different story but but the weather you
know we're we're much closer on that but

2236
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:10,240
know we're we're much closer on that but
 

2237
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,510
know we're we're much closer on that but
do you think eventually we'll figure out

2238
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:11,520
do you think eventually we'll figure out
 

2239
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,309
do you think eventually we'll figure out
the weather so do you think eventually

2240
00:43:14,309 --> 00:43:14,319
the weather so do you think eventually
 

2241
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,349
the weather so do you think eventually
most thing will figure out the local

2242
00:43:16,349 --> 00:43:16,359
most thing will figure out the local
 

2243
00:43:16,359 --> 00:43:18,430
most thing will figure out the local
pockets in everything essentially the

2244
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:18,440
pockets in everything essentially the
 

2245
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,349
pockets in everything essentially the
local pockets of reducibility no I think

2246
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:20,359
local pockets of reducibility no I think
 

2247
00:43:20,359 --> 00:43:22,390
local pockets of reducibility no I think
that the it's a it's an interesting

2248
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:22,400
that the it's a it's an interesting
 

2249
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,030
that the it's a it's an interesting
question but I think that the you know

2250
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:24,040
question but I think that the you know
 

2251
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,790
question but I think that the you know
there is an infinite collection of these

2252
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:25,800
there is an infinite collection of these
 

2253
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,790
there is an infinite collection of these
local Pockets we'll never run out of

2254
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:27,800
local Pockets we'll never run out of
 

2255
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,030
local Pockets we'll never run out of
local pockets and by the way those local

2256
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:30,040
local pockets and by the way those local
 

2257
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,430
local pockets and by the way those local
pockets are where we build engineering

2258
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:32,440
pockets are where we build engineering
 

2259
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,630
pockets are where we build engineering
for example that's how we you know when

2260
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:34,640
for example that's how we you know when
 

2261
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,829
for example that's how we you know when
we if we want to have a predictable life

2262
00:43:36,829 --> 00:43:36,839
we if we want to have a predictable life
 

2263
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:39,549
we if we want to have a predictable life
so to speak then you know we have to

2264
00:43:39,549 --> 00:43:39,559
so to speak then you know we have to
 

2265
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:42,069
so to speak then you know we have to
build in these sort of pockets of

2266
00:43:42,069 --> 00:43:42,079
build in these sort of pockets of
 

2267
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,270
build in these sort of pockets of
reducibility otherwise you know if we

2268
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:44,280
reducibility otherwise you know if we
 

2269
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,790
reducibility otherwise you know if we
were if we were sort of existing in this

2270
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:46,800
were if we were sort of existing in this
 

2271
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,349
were if we were sort of existing in this
kind of irreducible world we'd never be

2272
00:43:49,349 --> 00:43:49,359
kind of irreducible world we'd never be
 

2273
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,829
kind of irreducible world we'd never be
able to you know have definite things to

2274
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:51,839
able to you know have definite things to
 

2275
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:53,470
able to you know have definite things to
know what's going to happen you know I I

2276
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:53,480
know what's going to happen you know I I
 

2277
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,150
know what's going to happen you know I I
have to say I think one of the features

2278
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:55,160
have to say I think one of the features
 

2279
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,430
have to say I think one of the features
you know when we look at uh sort of

2280
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:57,440
you know when we look at uh sort of
 

2281
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,109
you know when we look at uh sort of
today from the future so to speak I

2282
00:44:00,109 --> 00:44:00,119
today from the future so to speak I
 

2283
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:01,589
today from the future so to speak I
suspect one of the things where people

2284
00:44:01,589 --> 00:44:01,599
suspect one of the things where people
 

2285
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:03,589
suspect one of the things where people
will say I can't believe they didn't see

2286
00:44:03,589 --> 00:44:03,599
will say I can't believe they didn't see
 

2287
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,549
will say I can't believe they didn't see
that is stuff to do with the following

2288
00:44:06,549 --> 00:44:06,559
that is stuff to do with the following
 

2289
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:08,710
that is stuff to do with the following
kind of thing so so you know if we

2290
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:08,720
kind of thing so so you know if we
 

2291
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,230
kind of thing so so you know if we
describe oh I don't know something like

2292
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:11,240
describe oh I don't know something like
 

2293
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:15,270
describe oh I don't know something like
um heat for instance we say oh you know

2294
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:15,280
um heat for instance we say oh you know
 

2295
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,630
um heat for instance we say oh you know
the air and in here it's you know it's

2296
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:17,640
the air and in here it's you know it's
 

2297
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,870
the air and in here it's you know it's
this temperature this pressure that's as

2298
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:19,880
this temperature this pressure that's as
 

2299
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,349
this temperature this pressure that's as
much as we can say otherwise just a

2300
00:44:21,349 --> 00:44:21,359
much as we can say otherwise just a
 

2301
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,750
much as we can say otherwise just a
bunch of random molecules bouncing

2302
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:22,760
bunch of random molecules bouncing
 

2303
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,430
bunch of random molecules bouncing
around people will say I just can't

2304
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:25,440
around people will say I just can't
 

2305
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,670
around people will say I just can't
believe they didn't realize that there

2306
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:26,680
believe they didn't realize that there
 

2307
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,150
believe they didn't realize that there
was all this detail and how all these

2308
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:28,160
was all this detail and how all these
 

2309
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,030
was all this detail and how all these
molecules were bouncing around and they

2310
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:30,040
molecules were bouncing around and they
 

2311
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,710
molecules were bouncing around and they
could make use of that I mean actually I

2312
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:32,720
could make use of that I mean actually I
 

2313
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,230
could make use of that I mean actually I
realized there's a thing I realized last

2314
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:34,240
realized there's a thing I realized last
 

2315
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,470
realized there's a thing I realized last
week actually was um was a thing that

2316
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:36,480
week actually was um was a thing that
 

2317
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,069
week actually was um was a thing that
people say you know one of the scenarios

2318
00:44:38,069 --> 00:44:38,079
people say you know one of the scenarios
 

2319
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:39,630
people say you know one of the scenarios
for the very long-term history of our

2320
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:39,640
for the very long-term history of our
 

2321
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,750
for the very long-term history of our
universe is a so-called heat death of

2322
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:41,760
universe is a so-called heat death of
 

2323
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,630
universe is a so-called heat death of
the universe where basically everything

2324
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:44,640
the universe where basically everything
 

2325
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,630
the universe where basically everything
just becomes thermodynamically boring

2326
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:47,640
just becomes thermodynamically boring
 

2327
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,230
just becomes thermodynamically boring
everything is just this big kind of gas

2328
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:49,240
everything is just this big kind of gas
 

2329
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,109
everything is just this big kind of gas
and thermal equilibrium people say

2330
00:44:51,109 --> 00:44:51,119
and thermal equilibrium people say
 

2331
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,870
and thermal equilibrium people say
that's a really bad outcome but actually

2332
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:53,880
that's a really bad outcome but actually
 

2333
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,750
that's a really bad outcome but actually
it's not a really bad outcome it's an

2334
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:55,760
it's not a really bad outcome it's an
 

2335
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,030
it's not a really bad outcome it's an
outcome where there's all this comp

2336
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:57,040
outcome where there's all this comp
 

2337
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,309
outcome where there's all this comp
computation going on and all those

2338
00:44:58,309 --> 00:44:58,319
computation going on and all those
 

2339
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,069
computation going on and all those
individual gas molecules are all

2340
00:45:00,069 --> 00:45:00,079
individual gas molecules are all
 

2341
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:01,910
individual gas molecules are all
bouncing around in very complicated ways

2342
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:01,920
bouncing around in very complicated ways
 

2343
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,150
bouncing around in very complicated ways
doing this very elaborate computation it

2344
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:04,160
doing this very elaborate computation it
 

2345
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,790
doing this very elaborate computation it
just happens to be a computation that

2346
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:05,800
just happens to be a computation that
 

2347
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:09,710
just happens to be a computation that
right now we haven't found ways to

2348
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:09,720
right now we haven't found ways to
 

2349
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,190
right now we haven't found ways to
understand we haven't found ways you

2350
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:11,200
understand we haven't found ways you
 

2351
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,349
understand we haven't found ways you
know our brains haven't you know and our

00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:13,359
know our brains haven't you know and our
 

2353
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:15,470

mathematics and our science and so on
 

2355
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,829
mathematics and our science and so on
haven't found ways to tell an

2356
00:45:16,829 --> 00:45:16,839
haven't found ways to tell an
 

2357
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,710
haven't found ways to tell an
interesting story about that it just

2358
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:18,720
interesting story about that it just
 

2359
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,030
interesting story about that it just
looks boring to us there's a there

2360
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:21,040
looks boring to us there's a there
 

2361
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,670
looks boring to us there's a there
you're saying there's a hopeful view of

2362
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:23,680
you're saying there's a hopeful view of
 

2363
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,190
you're saying there's a hopeful view of
the he death quote unquote of the

Rich experience in human life and life

2372
00:45:37,549 --> 00:45:37,559
Rich experience in human life and life
 

2373
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:39,790
Rich experience in human life and life
on Earth yes so those little molecules

2374
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:39,800
on Earth yes so those little molecules
 

2375
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,870
on Earth yes so those little molecules
interact in complex ways that there

2376
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:41,880
interact in complex ways that there
 

2377
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,270
interact in complex ways that there
could be intelligence in that there

2378
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:43,280
could be intelligence in that there
 

2379
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,390
could be intelligence in that there
could be absolutely I mean this this is

00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:45,400
could be absolutely I mean this this is
 

2381
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,430
could be absolutely I mean this this is
this is what you learn from this hopeful

2382
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:47,440
this is what you learn from this hopeful
 

2383
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,270
this is what you learn from this hopeful
message right I mean this is what you

2384
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:49,280
message right I mean this is what you
 

2385
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,510
message right I mean this is what you
kind of learned from this principle of

2386
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:50,520
kind of learned from this principle of
 

2387
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,109
kind of learned from this principle of
computational equivalence you learn it's

2388
00:45:53,109 --> 00:45:53,119
computational equivalence you learn it's
 

2389
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:56,510
computational equivalence you learn it's
both a a message of of sort of Hope and

2390
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:56,520
both a a message of of sort of Hope and
 

2391
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,270
both a a message of of sort of Hope and
a message of kind of you know there

2392
00:45:59,270 --> 00:45:59,280
a message of kind of you know there
 

2393
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,589
a message of kind of you know there
you're not as special as you think you

2394
00:46:00,589 --> 00:46:00,599
you're not as special as you think you
 

2395
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:02,190
you're not as special as you think you
are so to speak I mean because you know

2396
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:02,200
are so to speak I mean because you know
 

2397
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,589
are so to speak I mean because you know
we we imagine that with sort of all the

2398
00:46:04,589 --> 00:46:04,599
we we imagine that with sort of all the
 

2399
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:05,990
we we imagine that with sort of all the
things we do with with human

2400
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:06,000
things we do with with human
 

2401
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,910
things we do with with human
intelligence and all that kind of thing

2402
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:07,920
intelligence and all that kind of thing
 

2403
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,549
intelligence and all that kind of thing
and all of the stuff we've constructed

2404
00:46:09,549 --> 00:46:09,559
and all of the stuff we've constructed
 

2405
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:12,230
and all of the stuff we've constructed
in science it's like we're very special

2406
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:12,240
in science it's like we're very special
 

2407
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,790
in science it's like we're very special
but actually it turns out well no we're

2408
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:14,800
but actually it turns out well no we're
 

2409
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,069
but actually it turns out well no we're
not we're just doing computations like

2410
00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:18,079
not we're just doing computations like
 

2411
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:19,910
not we're just doing computations like
things in nature do computations like

2412
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:19,920
things in nature do computations like
 

2413
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,710
things in nature do computations like
those gas molecules do computations like

2414
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:21,720
those gas molecules do computations like
 

2415
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,190
those gas molecules do computations like
the weather does computations the only

2416
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:24,200
the weather does computations the only
 

2417
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,589
the weather does computations the only
the only thing about the computations

2418
00:46:25,589 --> 00:46:25,599
the only thing about the computations
 

2419
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:28,870
the only thing about the computations
that we do that's really special is that

2420
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:28,880
that we do that's really special is that
 

2421
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,390
that we do that's really special is that
we understand what they are so to speak

2422
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:31,400
we understand what they are so to speak
 

2423
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,750
we understand what they are so to speak
in other words we have a you know to us

2424
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:33,760
in other words we have a you know to us
 

2425
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,790
in other words we have a you know to us
they're special because kind of they're

2426
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:35,800
they're special because kind of they're
 

2427
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,750
they're special because kind of they're
connected to our purposes our ways of

2428
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:37,760
connected to our purposes our ways of
 

2429
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,630
connected to our purposes our ways of
thinking about things and so on and

2430
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:39,640
thinking about things and so on and
 

2431
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,150
thinking about things and so on and
that's um but so so that's very human

2432
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:42,160
that's um but so so that's very human
 

2433
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,990
that's um but so so that's very human
Centric that's we're just attached to

2434
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:44,000
Centric that's we're just attached to
 

2435
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,109
Centric that's we're just attached to
this kind of thing so let's talk a

2436
00:46:46,109 --> 00:46:46,119
this kind of thing so let's talk a
 

2437
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:47,309
this kind of thing so let's talk a
little bit of

2438
00:46:47,309 --> 00:46:47,319
little bit of
 

2439
00:46:47,319 --> 00:46:50,069
little bit of
physics maybe let's ask the uh the

2440
00:46:50,069 --> 00:46:50,079
physics maybe let's ask the uh the
 

2441
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:53,349
physics maybe let's ask the uh the
biggest question what is a theory of

2442
00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:53,359
biggest question what is a theory of
 

2443
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:55,710
biggest question what is a theory of
everything in general what does that

2444
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:55,720
everything in general what does that
 

2445
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,349
everything in general what does that
mean yeah so I mean the question is can

2446
00:46:58,349 --> 00:46:58,359
mean yeah so I mean the question is can
 

2447
00:46:58,359 --> 00:47:01,790
mean yeah so I mean the question is can
we kind of reduce what has been physics

2448
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:01,800
we kind of reduce what has been physics
 

2449
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,309
we kind of reduce what has been physics
as a something where we have to sort of

2450
00:47:04,309 --> 00:47:04,319
as a something where we have to sort of
 

2451
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,589
as a something where we have to sort of
pick away and say do we roughly know

2452
00:47:06,589 --> 00:47:06,599
pick away and say do we roughly know
 

2453
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:08,750
pick away and say do we roughly know
what how the world Works to something

2454
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:08,760
what how the world Works to something
 

2455
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,069
what how the world Works to something
where we have a complete formal Theory

2456
00:47:11,069 --> 00:47:11,079
where we have a complete formal Theory
 

2457
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:13,549
where we have a complete formal Theory
where we say if we were to run this

2458
00:47:13,549 --> 00:47:13,559
where we say if we were to run this
 

2459
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:15,910
where we say if we were to run this
program for long enough we would

2460
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:15,920
program for long enough we would
 

2461
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,790
program for long enough we would
reproduce everything you know down to

2462
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:18,800
reproduce everything you know down to
 

2463
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,790
reproduce everything you know down to
the fact that we're having this

2464
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:19,800
the fact that we're having this
 

2465
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,910
the fact that we're having this
conversation at this moment etc etc etc

2466
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:22,920

universe but the you know because of
 

2473
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:31,349
universe but the you know because of
computational irreducibility it's not

2474
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:31,359
computational irreducibility it's not
 

2475
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,549
computational irreducibility it's not
you know that's not something where you

2476
00:47:33,549 --> 00:47:33,559
you know that's not something where you
 

2477
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:34,910
you know that's not something where you
say okay you've got the fundamental

2478
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:34,920
say okay you've got the fundamental
 

2479
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,589
say okay you've got the fundamental
Theory of Everything then you know tell

2480
00:47:37,589 --> 00:47:37,599
Theory of Everything then you know tell
 

2481
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:40,710
Theory of Everything then you know tell
me whether you know uh lions are going

2482
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:40,720
me whether you know uh lions are going
 

2483
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,030
me whether you know uh lions are going
to eat tigers or something you know

2484
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:43,040
to eat tigers or something you know
 

2485
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,390
to eat tigers or something you know
that's a no you have to run this thing

2486
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:45,400
that's a no you have to run this thing
 

2487
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,630
that's a no you have to run this thing
for you know 10 to the 500 steps or

2488
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:47,640
for you know 10 to the 500 steps or
 

2489
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:50,390
for you know 10 to the 500 steps or
something to know something like that

2490
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:50,400
something to know something like that
 

2491
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,589
something to know something like that
okay so at some moment potentially you

2492
00:47:53,589 --> 00:47:53,599
okay so at some moment potentially you
 

2493
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,870
okay so at some moment potentially you
say this is a rule and run this rule

2494
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:56,880
say this is a rule and run this rule
 

2495
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,549
say this is a rule and run this rule
enough times and you will get the whole

2496
00:47:58,549 --> 00:47:58,559
enough times and you will get the whole
 

2497
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:00,790
enough times and you will get the whole
universe right that's that's what it

2498
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:00,800
universe right that's that's what it
 

2499
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,910
universe right that's that's what it
means to kind of have a fundamental

2500
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:02,920
means to kind of have a fundamental
 

2501
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,190
means to kind of have a fundamental
Theory of physics as far as I'm

2502
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:04,200
Theory of physics as far as I'm
 

2503
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,829
Theory of physics as far as I'm
concerned is you've got this rule it's

2504
00:48:06,829 --> 00:48:06,839
concerned is you've got this rule it's
 

2505
00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:08,190
concerned is you've got this rule it's
potentially quite simple we don't know

2506
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:08,200
potentially quite simple we don't know
 

2507
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,510
potentially quite simple we don't know
for sure it's simple but we have various

2508
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:10,520
for sure it's simple but we have various
 

2509
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,549
for sure it's simple but we have various
reasons to believe it might be simple

2510
00:48:12,549 --> 00:48:12,559
reasons to believe it might be simple
 

2511
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:15,150
reasons to believe it might be simple
and then you say okay I'm showing you

2512
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:15,160
and then you say okay I'm showing you
 

2513
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,790
and then you say okay I'm showing you
this rule you just run it only 10 500

2514
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:17,800
this rule you just run it only 10 500
 

2515
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,270
this rule you just run it only 10 500
times and you'll get everything in other

2516
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:20,280
times and you'll get everything in other
 

2517
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,470
times and you'll get everything in other
words you you've kind of reduced the

2518
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:22,480
words you you've kind of reduced the
 

2519
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,030
words you you've kind of reduced the
problem of physics to a problem of

2520
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:24,040
problem of physics to a problem of
 

2521
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,870
problem of physics to a problem of
mathematics so to speak it's like it's a

00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:26,880
mathematics so to speak it's like it's a

00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,470
if you know you like you generate the

2529
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,470

00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:42,760
get a this Rule and you just run it out
 

2537
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,190
get a this Rule and you just run it out
and you get everything that happens in

00:48:50,359 --> 00:48:53,069
Everything is a
mathematical framework within which you

mathematical framework within which you
 

2547
00:48:53,079 --> 00:48:55,390
mathematical framework within which you
can explain everything that happens in

00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:55,400
can explain everything that happens in
 

2549
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,109
can explain everything that happens in
the universe it's kind of in a unified

the universe it's kind of in a unified
 

2551
00:48:58,119 --> 00:48:59,910
the universe it's kind of in a unified
way it's not there's a bunch of

way it's not there's a bunch of
 

2553
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,589
way it's not there's a bunch of
disparate modules

2554

disparate modules
 

2555
00:49:02,599 --> 00:49:06,309
disparate modules
of does it feel like if you create a

2556
00:49:06,309 --> 00:49:06,319
of does it feel like if you create a
 

2557
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:10,030
of does it feel like if you create a
rule and we'll talk about the wol from

2558
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:10,040
rule and we'll talk about the wol from
 

2559
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,109
rule and we'll talk about the wol from
physics model which is fascinating but

2560
00:49:12,109 --> 00:49:12,119
physics model which is fascinating but
 

2561
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:16,349
physics model which is fascinating but
if if you if you have a simple set of

2562
00:49:16,349 --> 00:49:16,359
if if you if you have a simple set of
 

2563
00:49:16,359 --> 00:49:19,710
if if you if you have a simple set of
rules with a with a data structure like

2564
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:19,720
rules with a with a data structure like
 

2565
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:20,829
rules with a with a data structure like
a

a
 

2567
00:49:20,839 --> 00:49:23,190
a
hypergraph does that feel like a

2568
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:23,200
hypergraph does that feel like a
 

2569
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,910
hypergraph does that feel like a
satisfying Theory of Everything because

2570
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:25,920
satisfying Theory of Everything because
 

2571
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,829
satisfying Theory of Everything because
then you really run up against the uh

2572
00:49:29,829 --> 00:49:29,839
then you really run up against the uh
 

2573
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:31,510
then you really run up against the uh
irreducibility computational

2574
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:31,520
irreducibility computational
 

2575
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,349
irreducibility computational
reducibility right so that's a really

2576
00:49:33,349 --> 00:49:33,359
reducibility right so that's a really
 

2577
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:36,349
reducibility right so that's a really
interesting question so I I I you know

2578
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:36,359
interesting question so I I I you know
 

2579
00:49:36,359 --> 00:49:39,230
interesting question so I I I you know
what I thought was going to happen is I

2580
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:39,240
what I thought was going to happen is I
 

2581
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,789
what I thought was going to happen is I
thought we you know I thought we had a

2582
00:49:41,789 --> 00:49:41,799
thought we you know I thought we had a
 

2583
00:49:41,799 --> 00:49:44,470
thought we you know I thought we had a
pretty good I had a pretty good idea for

2584
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:44,480
pretty good I had a pretty good idea for
 

2585
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,230
pretty good I had a pretty good idea for
what the structure of this sort of

2586
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:46,240
what the structure of this sort of
 

2587
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,829
what the structure of this sort of
theory that's sort of underneath space

2588
00:49:47,829 --> 00:49:47,839
theory that's sort of underneath space
 

2589
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:50,430
theory that's sort of underneath space
and time and so on might be like and I

2590
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:50,440
and time and so on might be like and I
 

2591
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:53,030
and time and so on might be like and I
thought gosh you know in my lifetime so

2592
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:53,040
thought gosh you know in my lifetime so
 

2593
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,549
thought gosh you know in my lifetime so
to speak we might be able to figure out

2594
00:49:54,549 --> 00:49:54,559
to speak we might be able to figure out
 

2595
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,950
to speak we might be able to figure out
what happens in the first 10us 100 of

2596
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:56,960
what happens in the first 10us 100 of
 

2597
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,230
what happens in the first 10us 100 of
the universe MH and that would be cool

2598
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:00,240
the universe MH and that would be cool
 

2599
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,470
the universe MH and that would be cool
but it's pretty far away from anything

2600
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:02,480
but it's pretty far away from anything
 

2601
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,309
but it's pretty far away from anything
that we can see today and it will be

2602
00:50:04,309 --> 00:50:04,319
that we can see today and it will be
 

2603
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:05,950
that we can see today and it will be
hard to test whether that's right and so

2604
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:05,960
hard to test whether that's right and so
 

2605
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,190
hard to test whether that's right and so
on and so on and so on to my huge

2606
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:08,200
on and so on and so on to my huge
 

2607
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,789
on and so on and so on to my huge
surprise although it should have been

2608
00:50:09,789 --> 00:50:09,799
surprise although it should have been
 

2609
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:11,630
surprise although it should have been
obvious and it's embarrassing that it

2610
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:11,640
obvious and it's embarrassing that it
 

2611
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,390
obvious and it's embarrassing that it
wasn't obvious to me but but um to my

2612
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:14,400
wasn't obvious to me but but um to my
 

2613
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,349
wasn't obvious to me but but um to my
huge surprise we managed to get

2614
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:16,359
huge surprise we managed to get
 

2615
00:50:16,359 --> 00:50:18,630
huge surprise we managed to get
unbelievably much further than that and

2616
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:18,640
unbelievably much further than that and
 

2617
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,109
unbelievably much further than that and
basically what happened is that it turns

2618
00:50:21,109 --> 00:50:21,119
basically what happened is that it turns
 

2619
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:22,630
basically what happened is that it turns
out that even though there's this kind

2620
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:22,640
out that even though there's this kind
 

2621
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,390
out that even though there's this kind
of bed of computational

2622
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:24,400
of bed of computational
 

2623
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,549
of bed of computational
irreducibility that sort of uh these all

2624
00:50:27,549 --> 00:50:27,559
irreducibility that sort of uh these all
 

2625
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:30,789
irreducibility that sort of uh these all
these Simple Rules run into there is a

2626
00:50:30,789 --> 00:50:30,799
these Simple Rules run into there is a
 

2627
00:50:30,799 --> 00:50:32,150
these Simple Rules run into there is a
there are certain pieces of

2628
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:32,160
there are certain pieces of
 

2629
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,349
there are certain pieces of
computational

2630
00:50:33,349 --> 00:50:33,359
computational
 

2631
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:35,789
computational
reducibility that quite generically

2632
00:50:35,789 --> 00:50:35,799
reducibility that quite generically
 

2633
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:38,549
reducibility that quite generically
occur for large classes of these rules

2634
00:50:38,549 --> 00:50:38,559
occur for large classes of these rules
 

2635
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,829
occur for large classes of these rules
and and this is the really exciting

2636
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:40,839
and and this is the really exciting
 

2637
00:50:40,839 --> 00:50:43,510
and and this is the really exciting
thing as far as I'm concerned the the

2638
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:43,520
thing as far as I'm concerned the the
 

2639
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,150
thing as far as I'm concerned the the
the big pieces of computational

2640
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:45,160
the big pieces of computational
 

2641
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,309
the big pieces of computational
reducibility are basically the pillars

2642
00:50:47,309 --> 00:50:47,319
reducibility are basically the pillars
 

2643
00:50:47,319 --> 00:50:49,710
reducibility are basically the pillars
of 20th century physics that's the

2644
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:49,720
of 20th century physics that's the
 

2645
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,309
of 20th century physics that's the
amazing thing that general relativity

2646
00:50:51,309 --> 00:50:51,319
amazing thing that general relativity
 

2647
00:50:51,319 --> 00:50:53,510
amazing thing that general relativity

pillars of 20th century physics turn out

2650
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:56,040
pillars of 20th century physics turn out
 

2651
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:59,710
pillars of 20th century physics turn out
to be precisely the stuff you can say

2652
00:50:59,710 --> 00:50:59,720
to be precisely the stuff you can say
 

2653
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,150
to be precisely the stuff you can say
there's a lot you can't say there's a

2654
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:01,160
there's a lot you can't say there's a
 

2655
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,750
there's a lot you can't say there's a
lot that's kind of at this irreducible

2656
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:02,760
lot that's kind of at this irreducible
 

2657
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,349
lot that's kind of at this irreducible
level where you kind of don't know

2658
00:51:04,349 --> 00:51:04,359
level where you kind of don't know
 

2659
00:51:04,359 --> 00:51:05,630
level where you kind of don't know
what's going to happen you have to run

2660
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:05,640
what's going to happen you have to run
 

2661
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,430
what's going to happen you have to run
it you know you can't run it within our

2662
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:07,440
it you know you can't run it within our
 

2663
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:11,030
it you know you can't run it within our
universe etc etc etc etc etc um but the

2664
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:11,040
universe etc etc etc etc etc um but the
 

2665
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,549
universe etc etc etc etc etc um but the
thing is there are things you can say

2666
00:51:13,549 --> 00:51:13,559
thing is there are things you can say
 

2667
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:16,030
thing is there are things you can say
and the things you can say turn out to

2668
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:16,040
and the things you can say turn out to
 

2669
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,630
and the things you can say turn out to
be very beautifully exactly the

2670
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:18,640
be very beautifully exactly the
 

2671
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,630
be very beautifully exactly the
structure that was found in 20th century

2672
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:20,640
structure that was found in 20th century
 

2673
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,109
structure that was found in 20th century
physics namely general relativity and

2674
00:51:23,109 --> 00:51:23,119
physics namely general relativity and
 

2675
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:25,870
physics namely general relativity and
quantum mechanics and general relativity

2676
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:25,880
quantum mechanics and general relativity
 

2677
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,950
quantum mechanics and general relativity
and quantum mechanics are these pockets

2678
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:27,960
and quantum mechanics are these pockets
 

2679
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,150
and quantum mechanics are these pockets
of reducibility that we think of

2680
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:31,160
of reducibility that we think of
 

2681
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,670
of reducibility that we think of
as that that you know 20th century

2682
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:33,680
as that that you know 20th century
 

2683
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,910
as that that you know 20th century
physics is essentially pockets of

2684
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:35,920
physics is essentially pockets of
 

2685
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,349
physics is essentially pockets of
reducibility and then it's it is

2686
00:51:38,349 --> 00:51:38,359
reducibility and then it's it is
 

2687
00:51:38,359 --> 00:51:40,430
reducibility and then it's it is
incredibly surprising that any kind of

2688
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:40,440
incredibly surprising that any kind of
 

2689
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,430
incredibly surprising that any kind of
model that's

2690
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:42,440
model that's
 

2691
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:46,510
model that's
generative from Simple Rules would have

2692
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:46,520
generative from Simple Rules would have
 

2693
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,510
generative from Simple Rules would have
would have such Pockets yeah well I

2694
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:48,520
would have such Pockets yeah well I
 

2695
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:51,470
would have such Pockets yeah well I
think what what's surprising uh is we

2696
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:51,480
think what what's surprising uh is we
 

2697
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,230
think what what's surprising uh is we
didn't know where those things came from

2698
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:53,240
didn't know where those things came from
 

2699
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,150
didn't know where those things came from
it's like general relativity it's a very

2700
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:55,160
it's like general relativity it's a very
 

2701
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,670
it's like general relativity it's a very
nice mathematically elegant Theory why

2702
00:51:57,670 --> 00:51:57,680
nice mathematically elegant Theory why
 

2703
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,069
nice mathematically elegant Theory why
is it true you know quantum mechanics

2704
00:52:00,069 --> 00:52:00,079
is it true you know quantum mechanics
 

2705
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:03,510
is it true you know quantum mechanics
why is it true what we realized is that

2706
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:03,520
why is it true what we realized is that
 

2707
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,309
why is it true what we realized is that
from this that they are these theories

2708
00:52:06,309 --> 00:52:06,319
from this that they are these theories
 

2709
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:09,789
from this that they are these theories
are generic to a huge class of systems

2710
00:52:09,789 --> 00:52:09,799
are generic to a huge class of systems
 

2711
00:52:09,799 --> 00:52:11,549
are generic to a huge class of systems
that have these particular very

2712
00:52:11,549 --> 00:52:11,559
that have these particular very
 

2713
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:14,430
that have these particular very
unstructured underlying rules and that's

2714
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:14,440
unstructured underlying rules and that's
 

2715
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,589
unstructured underlying rules and that's
the that's the thing that is sort of uh

2716
00:52:16,589 --> 00:52:16,599
the that's the thing that is sort of uh
 

2717
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:18,870
the that's the thing that is sort of uh
remarkable and that's the thing to me

2718
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:18,880
remarkable and that's the thing to me
 

2719
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,990
remarkable and that's the thing to me
that's just it's really beautiful I mean

2720
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:21,000
that's just it's really beautiful I mean
 

2721
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,430
that's just it's really beautiful I mean
it's and the thing that's even more

2722
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:22,440
it's and the thing that's even more
 

2723
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,750
it's and the thing that's even more
beautiful is that it turns out that you

2724
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:24,760
beautiful is that it turns out that you
 

2725
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,109
beautiful is that it turns out that you
know people have been struggling for a

2726
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:26,119
know people have been struggling for a
 

2727
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:27,470
know people have been struggling for a
long time you know how does general

2728
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:27,480
long time you know how does general
 

2729
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,870
long time you know how does general
relativity theory of gravity relate to

2730
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:29,880
relativity theory of gravity relate to
 

2731
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,150
relativity theory of gravity relate to
Quantum Mechanics they seem to have all

2732
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:31,160
Quantum Mechanics they seem to have all
 

2733
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,549
Quantum Mechanics they seem to have all
kinds of incompatibilities it turns out

2734
00:52:33,549 --> 00:52:33,559
kinds of incompatibilities it turns out
 

2735
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:35,630
kinds of incompatibilities it turns out
what we realized is at some level they

2736
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:35,640
what we realized is at some level they
 

2737
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:39,230
what we realized is at some level they
are the same Theory and that's just it's

2738
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:39,240
are the same Theory and that's just it's
 

2739
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,349
are the same Theory and that's just it's
it's just great as far as I'm concerned

2740
00:52:41,349 --> 00:52:41,359
it's just great as far as I'm concerned
 

2741
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:43,630
it's just great as far as I'm concerned
so maybe like taking a little step back

2742
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:43,640
so maybe like taking a little step back
 

2743
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:44,990
so maybe like taking a little step back
from your

2744
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:45,000
from your
 

2745
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,150
from your
perspective not from the low not from

2746
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:48,160
perspective not from the low not from
 

2747
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,150
perspective not from the low not from
the beautiful hypog graph well from

2748
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:51,160
the beautiful hypog graph well from
 

2749
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,230
the beautiful hypog graph well from
physics model perspective but from the

2750
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:53,240
physics model perspective but from the
 

2751
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,589
physics model perspective but from the
perspective of 20th century physics what

2752
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:55,599
perspective of 20th century physics what
 

2753
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:57,829
perspective of 20th century physics what
is general relativity what is quantum

2754
00:52:57,829 --> 00:52:57,839
is general relativity what is quantum
 

2755
00:52:57,839 --> 00:52:59,390
is general relativity what is quantum
mechanics how do you think about these

2756
00:52:59,390 --> 00:52:59,400
mechanics how do you think about these
 

2757
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,430
mechanics how do you think about these
two theories from the context of the

2758
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:02,440
two theories from the context of the
 

2759
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:05,109
two theories from the context of the
theory of everything like just even

2760
00:53:05,109 --> 00:53:05,119
theory of everything like just even
 

2761
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:06,789
theory of everything like just even
definitions yeah yeah yeah right so so I

2762
00:53:06,789 --> 00:53:06,799
definitions yeah yeah yeah right so so I
 

2763
00:53:06,799 --> 00:53:08,390
definitions yeah yeah yeah right so so I
mean you know little bit of history of

2764
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:08,400
mean you know little bit of history of
 

2765
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,750
mean you know little bit of history of
physics right so so I mean the the you

2766
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:10,760
physics right so so I mean the the you
 

2767
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,829
physics right so so I mean the the you
know okay very very quick history of

2768
00:53:13,829 --> 00:53:13,839
know okay very very quick history of
 

2769
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:16,069
know okay very very quick history of
right so so I mean you know physics you

2770
00:53:16,069 --> 00:53:16,079
right so so I mean you know physics you
 

2771
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:18,150
right so so I mean you know physics you
know in ancient Greek times people

2772
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:18,160
know in ancient Greek times people
 

2773
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,910
know in ancient Greek times people
basically said we can just figure out

2774
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:19,920
basically said we can just figure out
 

2775
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,950
basically said we can just figure out
how the world works as you know we're

2776
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:21,960
how the world works as you know we're
 

2777
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,190
how the world works as you know we're
philosophers we're going to figure out

2778
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:23,200
philosophers we're going to figure out
 

2779
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,030
philosophers we're going to figure out
how the world works you know some

2780
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:25,040
how the world works you know some
 

2781
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,589
how the world works you know some
philosophers thought there were atoms

2782
00:53:26,589 --> 00:53:26,599
philosophers thought there were atoms
 

2783
00:53:26,599 --> 00:53:28,670
philosophers thought there were atoms
some philosophers thought there were you

2784
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:28,680
some philosophers thought there were you
 

2785
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,789
some philosophers thought there were you
know continuous flows of things people

2786
00:53:30,789 --> 00:53:30,799
know continuous flows of things people
 

2787
00:53:30,799 --> 00:53:32,309
know continuous flows of things people
had different ideas about how the world

2788
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:32,319
had different ideas about how the world
 

2789
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:33,910
had different ideas about how the world
works and they tried to just say we're

2790
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:33,920
works and they tried to just say we're
 

2791
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,750
works and they tried to just say we're
going to construct this idea of how how

2792
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:35,760
going to construct this idea of how how
 

2793
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,470
going to construct this idea of how how
the world Works they didn't really have

2794
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:37,480
the world Works they didn't really have
 

2795
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,150
the world Works they didn't really have
sort of Notions of doing experiments and

2796
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:39,160
sort of Notions of doing experiments and
 

2797
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,109
sort of Notions of doing experiments and
so on quite the same way as developed

2798
00:53:41,109 --> 00:53:41,119
so on quite the same way as developed
 

2799
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:42,829
so on quite the same way as developed
later so that was sort of an early

2800
00:53:42,829 --> 00:53:42,839
later so that was sort of an early
 

2801
00:53:42,839 --> 00:53:45,030
later so that was sort of an early
tradition for thinking about sort of

2802
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:45,040
tradition for thinking about sort of
 

2803
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,190
tradition for thinking about sort of
models of the world then by the time of

2804
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:48,200
models of the world then by the time of
 

2805
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:51,150
models of the world then by the time of
1600s time of Galileo and then Newton um

2806
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:51,160
1600s time of Galileo and then Newton um
 

2807
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:54,230
1600s time of Galileo and then Newton um
sort of the big the big idea there was

2808
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:54,240
sort of the big the big idea there was
 

2809
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,230
sort of the big the big idea there was
you know you know title of Newton's book

2810
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:56,240
you know you know title of Newton's book
 

2811
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,270
you know you know title of Newton's book
you know Pria Mathematica mathematical

2812
00:53:58,270 --> 00:53:58,280
you know Pria Mathematica mathematical
 

2813
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,750
you know Pria Mathematica mathematical
principles of natural philosophy we can

2814
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:00,760
principles of natural philosophy we can
 

2815
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:03,710
principles of natural philosophy we can
use mathematics to understand natural

2816
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:03,720
use mathematics to understand natural
 

2817
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,470
use mathematics to understand natural
philosophy to understand things about

2818
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:05,480
philosophy to understand things about
 

2819
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:07,950
philosophy to understand things about
the way the world works and so that then

2820
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:07,960
the way the world works and so that then
 

2821
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,470
the way the world works and so that then
led to this kind of idea that you know

2822
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:10,480
led to this kind of idea that you know
 

2823
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,870
led to this kind of idea that you know
we can write down a mathematical

2824
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:11,880
we can write down a mathematical
 

2825
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,390
we can write down a mathematical
equation and have that represent how the

2826
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:14,400
equation and have that represent how the
 

2827
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,150
equation and have that represent how the
world works so Newton's one of his most

2828
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:16,160
world works so Newton's one of his most
 

2829
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,390
world works so Newton's one of his most
famous ones is his universal law of

2830
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:18,400
famous ones is his universal law of
 

2831
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,109
famous ones is his universal law of
gravity inverse Square law of gravity

2832
00:54:21,109 --> 00:54:21,119
gravity inverse Square law of gravity
 

2833
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:22,870
gravity inverse Square law of gravity
that allowed him to compute all sorts of

2834
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:22,880
that allowed him to compute all sorts of
 

2835
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,910
that allowed him to compute all sorts of
features of of the planets and so on

2836
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:24,920
features of of the planets and so on
 

2837
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,230
features of of the planets and so on
although some of them he got wrong and

2838
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:26,240
although some of them he got wrong and
 

2839
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,030
although some of them he got wrong and
it was took another hundred years for

2840
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:28,040
it was took another hundred years for
 

2841
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,150
it was took another hundred years for
people to actually be able to do the

2842
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:29,160
people to actually be able to do the
 

2843
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,870
people to actually be able to do the
math uh to the level that was needed but

2844
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:31,880
math uh to the level that was needed but
 

2845
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,789
math uh to the level that was needed but
but um but so that that had been this

2846
00:54:33,789 --> 00:54:33,799
but um but so that that had been this
 

2847
00:54:33,799 --> 00:54:35,190
but um but so that that had been this
sort of tradition was we write down

2848
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:35,200
sort of tradition was we write down
 

2849
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,510
sort of tradition was we write down
these mathematical equations we don't

2850
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:36,520
these mathematical equations we don't
 

2851
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,910
these mathematical equations we don't
really know where these equations come

2852
00:54:37,910 --> 00:54:37,920
really know where these equations come
 

2853
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,630
really know where these equations come
from we write them down then we figure

2854
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:40,640
from we write them down then we figure
 

2855
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,510
from we write them down then we figure
out we work out their consequences and

2856
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:42,520
out we work out their consequences and
 

2857
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,109
out we work out their consequences and
we say yes that agrees with what we

2858
00:54:44,109 --> 00:54:44,119
we say yes that agrees with what we
 

2859
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:45,990
we say yes that agrees with what we
actually observe in astronomy or

2860
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:46,000
actually observe in astronomy or
 

2861
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,510
actually observe in astronomy or
something like this so that tradition

2862
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:48,520
something like this so that tradition
 

2863
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:51,150
something like this so that tradition
continued and um then the first of these

2864
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:51,160
continued and um then the first of these
 

2865
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,870
continued and um then the first of these
two sort of great 20th century uh

2866
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:53,880
two sort of great 20th century uh
 

2867
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,510
two sort of great 20th century uh
Innovations was uh well the history is a

2868
00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:56,520
Innovations was uh well the history is a
 

2869
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,829
Innovations was uh well the history is a
little bit more complicated but let's

2870
00:54:57,829 --> 00:54:57,839
little bit more complicated but let's
 

2871
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:00,870
little bit more complicated but let's
let's say the the the um the the the

2872
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:00,880
let's say the the the um the the the
 

2873
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,630
let's say the the the um the the the
there were two quantum mechanics and

2874
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:02,640
there were two quantum mechanics and
 

2875
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,109
there were two quantum mechanics and
general relativity quantum mechanics

2876
00:55:04,109 --> 00:55:04,119
general relativity quantum mechanics
 

2877
00:55:04,119 --> 00:55:07,150
general relativity quantum mechanics
kind of 1900 was kind of the very early

2878
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:07,160
kind of 1900 was kind of the very early
 

2879
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,630
kind of 1900 was kind of the very early
uh stuff done by plank that led to the

2880
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:09,640
uh stuff done by plank that led to the
 

2881
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:12,349
uh stuff done by plank that led to the
idea of photons particles of light um

2882
00:55:12,349 --> 00:55:12,359
idea of photons particles of light um
 

2883
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:14,190
idea of photons particles of light um
but let's let's take general relativity

2884
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:14,200
but let's let's take general relativity
 

2885
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:17,109
but let's let's take general relativity
first one one feature of the story is

2886
00:55:17,109 --> 00:55:17,119
first one one feature of the story is
 

2887
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:19,870
first one one feature of the story is
that special relativity thing Einstein

2888
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:19,880
that special relativity thing Einstein
 

2889
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:23,230
that special relativity thing Einstein
invented in 1905 was something which

2890
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:23,240
invented in 1905 was something which
 

2891
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,589
invented in 1905 was something which
surprisingly was a kind of logically

2892
00:55:25,589 --> 00:55:25,599
surprisingly was a kind of logically
 

2893
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:27,630
surprisingly was a kind of logically
invented Theory Theory it was not a

2894
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:27,640
invented Theory Theory it was not a
 

2895
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,870
invented Theory Theory it was not a
theory where it was something where

2896
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:29,880
theory where it was something where
 

2897
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,109
theory where it was something where
given these ideas that were sort of

2898
00:55:32,109 --> 00:55:32,119
given these ideas that were sort of
 

2899
00:55:32,119 --> 00:55:33,829
given these ideas that were sort of
axiomatically thought to be true about

2900
00:55:33,829 --> 00:55:33,839
axiomatically thought to be true about
 

2901
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:36,670
axiomatically thought to be true about
the world it followed that such and such

2902
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:36,680
the world it followed that such and such
 

2903
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,630
the world it followed that such and such
a thing would be the case it was a

2904
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:38,640
a thing would be the case it was a
 

2905
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,270
a thing would be the case it was a
little bit different from the the kind

2906
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:40,280
little bit different from the the kind
 

2907
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,670
little bit different from the the kind
of methodological structure of some of

2908
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:42,680
of methodological structure of some of
 

2909
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,950
of methodological structure of some of
some existing theories in more in the

2910
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:44,960
some existing theories in more in the
 

2911
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,549
some existing theories in more in the
more recent times or it just been we

2912
00:55:46,549 --> 00:55:46,559
more recent times or it just been we
 

2913
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:48,390
more recent times or it just been we
write down an equation and we find out

2914
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:48,400
write down an equation and we find out
 

2915
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,710
write down an equation and we find out
that it works so what happened there so

2916
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:51,720
that it works so what happened there so
 

2917
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,750
that it works so what happened there so
there's some reasoning about the light

2918
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:53,760
there's some reasoning about the light
 

2919
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,630
there's some reasoning about the light
the basic idea was you know the speed of

2920
00:55:56,630 --> 00:55:56,640
the basic idea was you know the speed of
 

2921
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,789
the basic idea was you know the speed of
light is appears to be constant uh you

2922
00:55:59,789 --> 00:55:59,799
light is appears to be constant uh you
 

2923
00:55:59,799 --> 00:56:01,829
light is appears to be constant uh you
know even if you're traveling very fast

2924
00:56:01,829 --> 00:56:01,839
know even if you're traveling very fast
 

2925
00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:04,470
know even if you're traveling very fast
you shine a flashlight the light will

2926
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:04,480
you shine a flashlight the light will
 

2927
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,029
you shine a flashlight the light will
come out even if you're going at half

2928
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:06,039
come out even if you're going at half
 

2929
00:56:06,039 --> 00:56:07,750
come out even if you're going at half
the speed of light the light doesn't

2930
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:07,760
the speed of light the light doesn't
 

2931
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,309
the speed of light the light doesn't
come out of your flashlight at one and a

2932
00:56:09,309 --> 00:56:09,319
come out of your flashlight at one and a
 

2933
00:56:09,319 --> 00:56:11,270
come out of your flashlight at one and a
half times the speed of light um it's

2934
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:11,280
half times the speed of light um it's
 

2935
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,470
half times the speed of light um it's
still just the speed of light and to

2936
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:13,480
still just the speed of light and to
 

2937
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,510
still just the speed of light and to
make that work you have to change your

2938
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:15,520
make that work you have to change your
 

2939
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,349
make that work you have to change your
view of how space and time work um to be

2940
00:56:18,349 --> 00:56:18,359
view of how space and time work um to be
 

2941
00:56:18,359 --> 00:56:20,470
view of how space and time work um to be
able to account for the fact that when

2942
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:20,480
able to account for the fact that when
 

2943
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,390
able to account for the fact that when
you're going faster it appears that you

2944
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:22,400
you're going faster it appears that you
 

2945
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,750
you're going faster it appears that you
know uh length is foreshortened and time

2946
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:24,760
know uh length is foreshortened and time
 

2947
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,470
know uh length is foreshortened and time
is dilated and things like this that's

2948
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:26,480
is dilated and things like this that's
 

2949
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,670
is dilated and things like this that's
special relativity that's special

2950
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:27,680
special relativity that's special
 

2951
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:31,710
special relativity that's special
relativity so then Einstein went on with

2952
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:31,720
relativity so then Einstein went on with
 

2953
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,309
relativity so then Einstein went on with
sort of vaguely similar kinds of

2954
00:56:34,309 --> 00:56:34,319
sort of vaguely similar kinds of
 

2955
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:36,990
sort of vaguely similar kinds of
thinking 1915 invented general

2956
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:37,000
thinking 1915 invented general
 

2957
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,950
thinking 1915 invented general
relativity which is a theory of gravity

2958
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:39,960
relativity which is a theory of gravity
 

2959
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,630
relativity which is a theory of gravity
and the basic point of general

2960
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:41,640
and the basic point of general
 

2961
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:44,910
and the basic point of general
relativity is is it's a theory that says

2962
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:44,920
relativity is is it's a theory that says
 

2963
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:48,750
relativity is is it's a theory that says
when there is mass in space space is

2964
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:48,760
when there is mass in space space is
 

2965
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:51,910
when there is mass in space space is
curved and what is that mean you know

2966
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:51,920
curved and what is that mean you know
 

2967
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,430
curved and what is that mean you know
you usually you think of what's the

2968
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:54,440
you usually you think of what's the
 

2969
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,950
you usually you think of what's the
shortest distance between two points

2970
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:55,960
shortest distance between two points
 

2971
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,549
shortest distance between two points
like in in a ordinarily in on a plane in

2972
00:56:58,549 --> 00:56:58,559
like in in a ordinarily in on a plane in
 

2973
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:00,910
like in in a ordinarily in on a plane in
space it's a straight line you know

2974
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:00,920
space it's a straight line you know
 

2975
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:04,750
space it's a straight line you know
photons light goes in straight lines

2976
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:04,760
photons light goes in straight lines
 

2977
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:08,029
photons light goes in straight lines
well then the question is is if if you

2978
00:57:08,029 --> 00:57:08,039
well then the question is is if if you
 

2979
00:57:08,039 --> 00:57:11,270
well then the question is is if if you
have a curved surface a straight line is

2980
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:11,280
have a curved surface a straight line is
 

2981
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,950
have a curved surface a straight line is
no longer straight on the surface of the

2982
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:12,960
no longer straight on the surface of the
 

2983
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,829
no longer straight on the surface of the
Earth the shortest distance between two

2984
00:57:14,829 --> 00:57:14,839
Earth the shortest distance between two
 

2985
00:57:14,839 --> 00:57:17,390
Earth the shortest distance between two
points is a great circle it's a circle

2986
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:17,400
points is a great circle it's a circle
 

2987
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,309
points is a great circle it's a circle
um it's uh so you know Einstein's

2988
00:57:20,309 --> 00:57:20,319
um it's uh so you know Einstein's
 

2989
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:23,029
um it's uh so you know Einstein's
observation was maybe the physical uh

2990
00:57:23,029 --> 00:57:23,039
observation was maybe the physical uh
 

2991
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:25,870
observation was maybe the physical uh
structure of space is such that space is

2992
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:25,880
structure of space is such that space is
 

2993
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,109
structure of space is such that space is
curved D so the shortest distance

2994
00:57:28,109 --> 00:57:28,119
curved D so the shortest distance
 

2995
00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:30,829
curved D so the shortest distance
between two points the the path the

2996
00:57:30,829 --> 00:57:30,839
between two points the the path the
 

2997
00:57:30,839 --> 00:57:33,270
between two points the the path the
straight line in quotes won't be

2998
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:33,280
straight line in quotes won't be
 

2999
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,630
straight line in quotes won't be
straight anymore and in particular if a

3000
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:35,640
straight anymore and in particular if a
 

3001
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,789
straight anymore and in particular if a
if a photon is is you know traveling

3002
00:57:37,789 --> 00:57:37,799
if a photon is is you know traveling
 

3003
00:57:37,799 --> 00:57:39,549
if a photon is is you know traveling
near near the Sun or something or if a

3004
00:57:39,549 --> 00:57:39,559
near near the Sun or something or if a
 

3005
00:57:39,559 --> 00:57:41,270
near near the Sun or something or if a
particle is going something is traveling

3006
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:41,280
particle is going something is traveling
 

3007
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,589
particle is going something is traveling
near the sun maybe the shortest path

3008
00:57:44,589 --> 00:57:44,599
near the sun maybe the shortest path
 

3009
00:57:44,599 --> 00:57:47,309
near the sun maybe the shortest path
will be one that is is uh is is

3010
00:57:47,309 --> 00:57:47,319
will be one that is is uh is is
 

3011
00:57:47,319 --> 00:57:48,829
will be one that is is uh is is
something which looks curved to us

3012
00:57:48,829 --> 00:57:48,839
something which looks curved to us
 

3013
00:57:48,839 --> 00:57:50,990
something which looks curved to us
because it seems curved to us because

3014
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:51,000
because it seems curved to us because
 

3015
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,670
because it seems curved to us because
space has been deformed by the presence

3016
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:52,680
space has been deformed by the presence
 

3017
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,670
space has been deformed by the presence
of mass associated with that that

3018
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:54,680
of mass associated with that that
 

3019
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,750
of mass associated with that that
massive object so so the kind of the

3020
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:56,760
massive object so so the kind of the
 

3021
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:59,990
massive object so so the kind of the
idea uh there is um think of the

3022
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:00,000
idea uh there is um think of the
 

3023
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,910
idea uh there is um think of the
structure of space as being a dynamical

3024
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:01,920
structure of space as being a dynamical
 

3025
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,190
structure of space as being a dynamical
changing kind of thing but then what

3026
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:04,200
changing kind of thing but then what
 

3027
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,589
changing kind of thing but then what
Einstein did was he wrote down these

3028
00:58:05,589 --> 00:58:05,599
Einstein did was he wrote down these
 

3029
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:08,109
Einstein did was he wrote down these
differential equations that basically

3030
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:08,119
differential equations that basically
 

3031
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:10,309
differential equations that basically
represented the curvature of space and

3032
00:58:10,309 --> 00:58:10,319
represented the curvature of space and
 

3033
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:11,990
represented the curvature of space and
its response to the presence of mass and

3034
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:12,000
its response to the presence of mass and
 

3035
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,069
its response to the presence of mass and
energy and that

3036
00:58:14,069 --> 00:58:14,079
energy and that
 

3037
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:17,230
energy and that
ultimately is connected to the force of

3038
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:17,240
ultimately is connected to the force of
 

3039
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,710
ultimately is connected to the force of
gravity which is one of the forces that

3040
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:19,720
gravity which is one of the forces that
 

3041
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:22,549
gravity which is one of the forces that
seems to based on it strength operate on

3042
00:58:22,549 --> 00:58:22,559
seems to based on it strength operate on
 

3043
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:24,309
seems to based on it strength operate on
a different scale than some of the other

3044
00:58:24,309 --> 00:58:24,319
a different scale than some of the other
 

3045
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:26,829
a different scale than some of the other
forces so it operates at a scale as very

3046
00:58:26,829 --> 00:58:26,839
forces so it operates at a scale as very
 

3047
00:58:26,839 --> 00:58:30,230
forces so it operates at a scale as very
large what happens there is is just this

3048
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:30,240
large what happens there is is just this
 

3049
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,190
large what happens there is is just this
this curvature of space which causes you

3050
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:33,200
this curvature of space which causes you
 

3051
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,950
this curvature of space which causes you
know the paths of objects to be

3052
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:34,960
know the paths of objects to be
 

3053
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,309
know the paths of objects to be
deflected that's what gravity does it

3054
00:58:37,309 --> 00:58:37,319
deflected that's what gravity does it
 

3055
00:58:37,319 --> 00:58:38,710
deflected that's what gravity does it
causes the paths of objects to be

3056
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:38,720
causes the paths of objects to be
 

3057
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:41,510
causes the paths of objects to be
deflected and this is an explanation for

3058
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:41,520
deflected and this is an explanation for
 

3059
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,710
deflected and this is an explanation for
Gravity so to speak and the surprise is

3060
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:44,720
Gravity so to speak and the surprise is
 

3061
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,789
Gravity so to speak and the surprise is
that from 1915 until today everything

3062
00:58:47,789 --> 00:58:47,799
that from 1915 until today everything
 

3063
00:58:47,799 --> 00:58:50,270
that from 1915 until today everything
that we measured about gravity precisely

3064
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:50,280
that we measured about gravity precisely
 

3065
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:53,549
that we measured about gravity precisely
agrees with General and that's um uh and

3066
00:58:53,549 --> 00:58:53,559
agrees with General and that's um uh and
 

3067
00:58:53,559 --> 00:58:55,230
agrees with General and that's um uh and
that you know it wasn't clear black

3068
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:55,240
that you know it wasn't clear black
 

3069
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,710
that you know it wasn't clear black
holes were sort of predict well actually

3070
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:56,720
holes were sort of predict well actually
 

3071
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:57,950
holes were sort of predict well actually
the expansion of the universe was an

3072
00:58:57,950 --> 00:58:57,960
the expansion of the universe was an
 

3073
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,789
the expansion of the universe was an
early potential prediction although

3074
00:58:59,789 --> 00:58:59,799
early potential prediction although
 

3075
00:58:59,799 --> 00:59:02,150
early potential prediction although
Einstein tried to sort of patch up his

3076
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:02,160
Einstein tried to sort of patch up his
 

3077
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:03,829
Einstein tried to sort of patch up his
equations to make it not cause the

3078
00:59:03,829 --> 00:59:03,839
equations to make it not cause the
 

3079
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:05,510
equations to make it not cause the
universe to expand because it was kind

3080
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:05,520
universe to expand because it was kind
 

3081
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,190
universe to expand because it was kind
of so obvious the universe wasn't

3082
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:07,200
of so obvious the universe wasn't
 

3083
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,670
of so obvious the universe wasn't
expanding and um uh you know turns out

3084
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:09,680
expanding and um uh you know turns out
 

3085
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,029
expanding and um uh you know turns out
it was expanding and he should have just

3086
00:59:11,029 --> 00:59:11,039
it was expanding and he should have just
 

3087
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:12,309
it was expanding and he should have just
trusted the equations and that's a

3088
00:59:12,309 --> 00:59:12,319
trusted the equations and that's a
 

3089
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:14,910
trusted the equations and that's a
lesson for for those of us um interested

3090
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:14,920
lesson for for those of us um interested
 

3091
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,230
lesson for for those of us um interested
in making fundamental theories of

3092
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:16,240
in making fundamental theories of
 

3093
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,589
in making fundamental theories of
physics is you should trust your theory

3094
00:59:18,589 --> 00:59:18,599
physics is you should trust your theory
 

3095
00:59:18,599 --> 00:59:20,190
physics is you should trust your theory
and not try and Patch it because of

3096
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:20,200
and not try and Patch it because of
 

3097
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,670
and not try and Patch it because of
something that you think might be the

3098
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:21,680
something that you think might be the
 

3099
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,430
something that you think might be the
case that um uh that that might turn out

3100
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:24,440
case that um uh that that might turn out
 

3101
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:26,150
case that um uh that that might turn out
not to be the case even if the theory

3102
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:26,160
not to be the case even if the theory
 

3103
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,630
not to be the case even if the theory
says something crazy is happening yeah

3104
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:28,640
says something crazy is happening yeah
 

3105
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,430
says something crazy is happening yeah
right like the universe the universe is

3106
00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:30,440
right like the universe the universe is
 

3107
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,789
right like the universe the universe is
expanding right which is but but um but

3108
00:59:32,789 --> 00:59:32,799
expanding right which is but but um but
 

3109
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:35,109
expanding right which is but but um but
you know then it took until the 1940s

3110
00:59:35,109 --> 00:59:35,119
you know then it took until the 1940s
 

3111
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:36,750
you know then it took until the 1940s
probably even really until the 1960s

3112
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:36,760
probably even really until the 1960s
 

3113
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:38,470
probably even really until the 1960s
until people understood that black holes

3114
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:38,480
until people understood that black holes
 

3115
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,750
until people understood that black holes
were a consequence of of general

3116
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:40,760
were a consequence of of general
 

3117
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:43,270
were a consequence of of general
relativity and so on but that's um you

3118
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:43,280
relativity and so on but that's um you
 

3119
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,190
relativity and so on but that's um you
know the big surprise has been that so

3120
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:46,200
know the big surprise has been that so
 

3121
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:49,549
know the big surprise has been that so
far this theory of gravity has perfectly

3122
00:59:49,549 --> 00:59:49,559
far this theory of gravity has perfectly
 

3123
00:59:49,559 --> 00:59:51,190
far this theory of gravity has perfectly
agreed with you know these collisions of

3128
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:55,920

3129
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,710

that's that's been kind of one pillar of

3130
00:59:57,710 --> 00:59:57,720
that's that's been kind of one pillar of
 

3131
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:00,029
that's that's been kind of one pillar of
the story of physics it's mathematically

3132
01:00:00,029 --> 01:00:00,039
the story of physics it's mathematically
 

3133
01:00:00,039 --> 01:00:01,710
the story of physics it's mathematically
complicated to work out the consequences

3134
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:01,720
complicated to work out the consequences
 

3135
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:04,069
complicated to work out the consequences
of general relativity but it's not

there's there's no I mean and and and
 

3139
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,829
there's there's no I mean and and and
some things are kind of squiggly and

some things are kind of squiggly and
 

3141
01:00:08,839 --> 01:00:10,789
some things are kind of squiggly and
complicated like people believe you know

01:00:10,789 --> 01:00:10,799
complicated like people believe you know
 

3143
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:13,270

you said at the Big Bang Yeah like all

3182
01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:49,640
you said at the Big Bang Yeah like all
 

3183
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:51,510
you said at the Big Bang Yeah like all
those kinds of well no not not at the

those kinds of well no not not at the
 

3185
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,950
those kinds of well no not not at the
Big Bang actually right but the well

3186
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:53,960
Big Bang actually right but the well

features of the expansion of the
 

3189
01:00:55,039 --> 01:00:57,349

01:00:57,349 --> 01:00:57,359
universe yes and and there are there are
 

3191
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:58,710
universe yes and and there are there are
lots of details where we don't quite

3192
01:00:58,710 --> 01:00:58,720
lots of details where we don't quite
 

3193
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,630
lots of details where we don't quite
know how it's working you know is there

3194
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:00,640
know how it's working you know is there
 

3195
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,109
know how it's working you know is there
you know where's the dark matter is

3196
01:01:02,109 --> 01:01:02,119
you know where's the dark matter is
 

3197
01:01:02,119 --> 01:01:04,430
you know where's the dark matter is
there Dark Energy you know etc etc etc

3198
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:04,440
there Dark Energy you know etc etc etc
 

3199
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,309
there Dark Energy you know etc etc etc
but but fundamentally the the you know

3200
01:01:06,309 --> 01:01:06,319
but but fundamentally the the you know
 

3201
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:07,870
but but fundamentally the the you know
the testable features of general

3202
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:07,880
the testable features of general
 

3203
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:10,029
the testable features of general
relativity it all works very beautifully

3204
01:01:10,029 --> 01:01:10,039
relativity it all works very beautifully
 

3205
01:01:10,039 --> 01:01:12,349
relativity it all works very beautifully
and it's it's in a sense it is

3206
01:01:12,349 --> 01:01:12,359
and it's it's in a sense it is
 

3207
01:01:12,359 --> 01:01:14,390
and it's it's in a sense it is
mathematically sophisticated but is not

3208
01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:14,400
mathematically sophisticated but is not
 

3209
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,270
mathematically sophisticated but is not
conceptually hard to understand in some

3210
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:16,280
conceptually hard to understand in some
 

3211
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:18,670
conceptually hard to understand in some
sense okay so that's general relativity

3212
01:01:18,670 --> 01:01:18,680
sense okay so that's general relativity
 

3213
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:20,829
sense okay so that's general relativity
and what's its friendly neighbor like

3214
01:01:20,829 --> 01:01:20,839
and what's its friendly neighbor like
 

3215
01:01:20,839 --> 01:01:22,950
and what's its friendly neighbor like
you said two theories quantum mechanics

3216
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:22,960
you said two theories quantum mechanics
 

3217
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,589
you said two theories quantum mechanics
right so quantum mechanics the the the

3218
01:01:25,589 --> 01:01:25,599
right so quantum mechanics the the the
 

3219
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:28,270
right so quantum mechanics the the the
sort of the way that that originated was

3220
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:28,280
sort of the way that that originated was
 

3221
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,190
sort of the way that that originated was
one question was is the world continuous

3222
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:30,200
one question was is the world continuous
 

3223
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:31,870
one question was is the world continuous
or is it discret you know in ancient

3224
01:01:31,870 --> 01:01:31,880
or is it discret you know in ancient
 

3225
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:33,510

01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:33,520
Greek times people have been debating
 

3227
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,589
Greek times people have been debating
this people debated it you you know

3228
01:01:35,589 --> 01:01:35,599
this people debated it you you know
 

3229
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:37,870
this people debated it you you know
throughout history as light made of

um you know what had become clear in the

3236
01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:45,000
um you know what had become clear in the
 

3237
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,950
um you know what had become clear in the
1800s is that

3238
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:46,960
1800s is that
 

3239
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,829
1800s is that
atoms that you know materials are made

3240
01:01:49,829 --> 01:01:49,839
atoms that you know materials are made
 

3241
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:52,670
atoms that you know materials are made
of discrete atoms you know when you take

3242
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:52,680
of discrete atoms you know when you take

01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:55,200
some water the water is not a continuous
 

3245
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,549
some water the water is not a continuous
fluid even though seems like a

3246
01:01:56,549 --> 01:01:56,559
fluid even though seems like a
 

3247
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:59,029
fluid even though seems like a
continuous fluid to us at our scale but

3248
01:01:59,029 --> 01:01:59,039
continuous fluid to us at our scale but
 

3249
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:01,029
continuous fluid to us at our scale but
if you say let's look at it smaller and

3250
01:02:01,029 --> 01:02:01,039
if you say let's look at it smaller and
 

3251
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:02,470
if you say let's look at it smaller and
smaller and smaller and smaller scale

3252
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:02,480
smaller and smaller and smaller scale
 

3253
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,190
smaller and smaller and smaller scale
eventually you get down to these you

3254
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:04,200
eventually you get down to these you
 

3255
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,470
eventually you get down to these you
know these molecules and then atoms it's

3256
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:06,480
know these molecules and then atoms it's
 

3257
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,470
know these molecules and then atoms it's
made of discrete things the question is

3258
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:08,480
made of discrete things the question is
 

3259
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,349
made of discrete things the question is
sort of how important is this

3260
01:02:10,349 --> 01:02:10,359
sort of how important is this
 

3261
01:02:10,359 --> 01:02:12,230
sort of how important is this
discreetness just what's discret what's

3262
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:12,240
discreetness just what's discret what's
 

3263
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,789
discreetness just what's discret what's
not discret is energy discrete is you

3264
01:02:14,789 --> 01:02:14,799
not discret is energy discrete is you
 

3265
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:17,549
not discret is energy discrete is you
know is what's discrete what's not and

3266
01:02:17,549 --> 01:02:17,559
know is what's discrete what's not and
 

3267
01:02:17,559 --> 01:02:20,230
know is what's discrete what's not and
so does it have mass those kinds of

3268
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:20,240
so does it have mass those kinds of
 

3269
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,589
so does it have mass those kinds of
questions yeah yeah right well there's

3270
01:02:22,589 --> 01:02:22,599
questions yeah yeah right well there's
 

3271
01:02:22,599 --> 01:02:24,470
questions yeah yeah right well there's
question I for example is mass discreet

3272
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:24,480
question I for example is mass discreet
 

3273
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,630
question I for example is mass discreet
is an interesting question which is now

3274
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:26,640
is an interesting question which is now
 

3275
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:29,150
is an interesting question which is now
something we can address but but um you

3276
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:29,160
something we can address but but um you
 

3277
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:32,829
something we can address but but um you
know what what happened in um uh the in

3278
01:02:32,829 --> 01:02:32,839
know what what happened in um uh the in
 

3279
01:02:32,839 --> 01:02:35,950
know what what happened in um uh the in
in the coming up to the 1920s there was

3280
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:35,960
in the coming up to the 1920s there was
 

3281
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,230
in the coming up to the 1920s there was
this kind of mathematical theory

3282
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:37,240
this kind of mathematical theory
 

3283
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:38,870
this kind of mathematical theory
developed that could explain certain

developed that could explain certain
 

3285
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,950
developed that could explain certain
kinds of discreetness in in particularly

kinds of discreetness in in particularly
 

3287
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:44,710
kinds of discreetness in in particularly
and in features of atoms and so on and

3288
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:44,720
and in features of atoms and so on and
 

3289
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,349
and in features of atoms and so on and
uh you know what developed was this

3290
01:02:46,349 --> 01:02:46,359
uh you know what developed was this
 

3291
01:02:46,359 --> 01:02:48,829
uh you know what developed was this
mathematical theory that was a theory

like this that's a mathematical theory
 

3299
01:02:55,319 --> 01:02:57,589
like this that's a mathematical theory
that allows you to calculate lots of

3300
01:02:57,589 --> 01:02:57,599
that allows you to calculate lots of
 

3301
01:02:57,599 --> 01:02:59,390
that allows you to calculate lots of

etc now the calculations all work just
 

3307
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,750
etc now the calculations all work just

great the um uh the question of what
 

3309
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,269
great the um uh the question of what
does it really mean is a complicated

does it really mean is a complicated
 

3311
01:03:10,279 --> 01:03:12,870

worked great 1920s 1930s and so on there

3318
01:03:20,349 --> 01:03:20,359
worked great 1920s 1930s and so on there
 

3319
01:03:20,359 --> 01:03:22,870
worked great 1920s 1930s and so on there
was always a problem there were uh in

that sort of definite things happen in

3424
01:05:13,190 --> 01:05:13,200
that sort of definite things happen in
 

3425
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,589
that sort of definite things happen in
the world you pick up a ball you throw

3426
01:05:15,589 --> 01:05:15,599
the world you pick up a ball you throw
 

3427
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:17,349
the world you pick up a ball you throw
it the ball goes in a definite

3428
01:05:17,349 --> 01:05:17,359
it the ball goes in a definite
 

3429
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:19,710
it the ball goes in a definite
trajectory that's has certain equations

3430
01:05:19,710 --> 01:05:19,720
trajectory that's has certain equations
 

3431
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:21,390
trajectory that's has certain equations
of motion it goes in a parabola whatever

3432
01:05:21,390 --> 01:05:21,400
of motion it goes in a parabola whatever
 

3433
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:25,269
of motion it goes in a parabola whatever
else in quantum mechanics the picture is

3434
01:05:25,269 --> 01:05:25,279
else in quantum mechanics the picture is
 

3435
01:05:25,279 --> 01:05:27,670
else in quantum mechanics the picture is
definitely things don't happen instead

3436
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:27,680
definitely things don't happen instead
 

3437
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,910
definitely things don't happen instead
sort of what happens is this whole sort

3438
01:05:29,910 --> 01:05:29,920
sort of what happens is this whole sort
 

3439
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:32,910
sort of what happens is this whole sort
of structure of of all you know many

3440
01:05:32,910 --> 01:05:32,920
of structure of of all you know many
 

3441
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:35,589
of structure of of all you know many
different paths being followed and um we

3442
01:05:35,589 --> 01:05:35,599
different paths being followed and um we
 

3443
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:37,430
different paths being followed and um we
can calculate certain aspects of what

3444
01:05:37,430 --> 01:05:37,440
can calculate certain aspects of what
 

3445
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,829
can calculate certain aspects of what
happens certain probabilities of

happens certain probabilities of
 

3447
01:05:38,839 --> 01:05:41,190
happens certain probabilities of
different outcomes and so on and you say

3448
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:41,200
different outcomes and so on and you say
 

3449
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,990
different outcomes and so on and you say
well what really happened what's really

3450
01:05:42,990 --> 01:05:43,000
well what really happened what's really
 

3451
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,870
well what really happened what's really
going on what's the sort of uh what's

3452
01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:44,880
going on what's the sort of uh what's
 

3453
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,029
going on what's the sort of uh what's
the underlying you know what's the

3454
01:05:46,029 --> 01:05:46,039
the underlying you know what's the
 

3455
01:05:46,039 --> 01:05:48,150
the underlying you know what's the
underlying story what how do we how do

3456
01:05:48,150 --> 01:05:48,160
underlying story what how do we how do
 

3457
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,670
underlying story what how do we how do
we turn this this mathematical theory

3458
01:05:50,670 --> 01:05:50,680
we turn this this mathematical theory
 

3459
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,710
we turn this this mathematical theory
that we can calculate things with into

3460
01:05:52,710 --> 01:05:52,720
that we can calculate things with into
 

3461
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,670
that we can calculate things with into
something that we can really understand

01:05:54,670 --> 01:05:54,680
something that we can really understand
 

3463
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:56,549
something that we can really understand
and have a narrative about out and

3464
01:05:56,549 --> 01:05:56,559
and have a narrative about out and
 

3465
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:57,910
and have a narrative about out and
that's been really really hard for

3466
01:05:57,910 --> 01:05:57,920
that's been really really hard for
 

3467
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,029
that's been really really hard for

01:06:02,190 --> 01:06:02,200
feeman always used to say nobody
 

3471
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,990
feeman always used to say nobody
understands quantum mechanics even

3472
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:04,000
understands quantum mechanics even
 

3473
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,750
understands quantum mechanics even
though he'd made his you know whole

3474
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:05,760
though he'd made his you know whole
 

3475
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:08,309
though he'd made his you know whole
career out of calculating things about

3476
01:06:08,309 --> 01:06:08,319
career out of calculating things about
 

3477
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:11,269
career out of calculating things about
quantum mechanics um and uh you know so

3478
01:06:11,269 --> 01:06:11,279
quantum mechanics um and uh you know so
 

3479
01:06:11,279 --> 01:06:14,269
quantum mechanics um and uh you know so
so it's nevertheless it's uh what the

3480
01:06:14,269 --> 01:06:14,279
so it's nevertheless it's uh what the
 

3481
01:06:14,279 --> 01:06:17,430
so it's nevertheless it's uh what the
quantum field theory is very uh very

3482
01:06:17,430 --> 01:06:17,440
quantum field theory is very uh very
 

3483
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,230
quantum field theory is very uh very
accurate at predicting a lot of the

3484
01:06:19,230 --> 01:06:19,240
accurate at predicting a lot of the
 

3485
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:22,549
accurate at predicting a lot of the
physical phenomena so it works yeah and

3486
01:06:22,549 --> 01:06:22,559
physical phenomena so it works yeah and
 

3487
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:24,230
physical phenomena so it works yeah and
but there are things about it you know

3488
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:24,240
but there are things about it you know
 

3489
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,269
but there are things about it you know
it has certain when we apply it the

3490
01:06:26,269 --> 01:06:26,279
it has certain when we apply it the
 

3491
01:06:26,279 --> 01:06:27,910
it has certain when we apply it the
standard model of particle physics for

3492
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:27,920
standard model of particle physics for
 

3493
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:31,029
standard model of particle physics for
example we uh you know which we apply to

3494
01:06:31,029 --> 01:06:31,039
example we uh you know which we apply to
 

3495
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:32,390
example we uh you know which we apply to
calculate all kinds of things it works

3496
01:06:32,390 --> 01:06:32,400
calculate all kinds of things it works
 

3497
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,069
calculate all kinds of things it works
really well and you say Well it has

3498
01:06:34,069 --> 01:06:34,079
really well and you say Well it has
 

3499
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:35,430
really well and you say Well it has
certain parameters it has a whole bunch

3500
01:06:35,430 --> 01:06:35,440
certain parameters it has a whole bunch
 

3501
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,870
certain parameters it has a whole bunch
of parameters actually you say why is

3502
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:37,880
of parameters actually you say why is
 

3503
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:40,670
of parameters actually you say why is
the you know why does the muon particle

3504
01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:40,680
the you know why does the muon particle
 

3505
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:43,390
the you know why does the muon particle
exist why is it 206 times the mass of

3506
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:43,400
exist why is it 206 times the mass of
 

3507
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:46,829
exist why is it 206 times the mass of
the electron we don't know no idea but

3508
01:06:46,829 --> 01:06:46,839
the electron we don't know no idea but
 

3509
01:06:46,839 --> 01:06:49,029
the electron we don't know no idea but
so the standard model physics is is is

3510
01:06:49,029 --> 01:06:49,039
so the standard model physics is is is
 

3511
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:50,750
so the standard model physics is is is
one of the models that's very accurate

3512
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:50,760
one of the models that's very accurate
 

3513
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:53,430
one of the models that's very accurate
for describing three three of the

3514
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:53,440
for describing three three of the
 

3515
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,549
for describing three three of the
fundamental forces of physics and look

3516
01:06:55,549 --> 01:06:55,559
fundamental forces of physics and look
 

3517
01:06:55,559 --> 01:06:57,390
fundamental forces of physics and look
looking at the the world of the very

3518
01:06:57,390 --> 01:06:57,400
looking at the the world of the very
 

3519
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:00,470
looking at the the world of the very
small right and then there's back to the

3520
01:07:00,470 --> 01:07:00,480
small right and then there's back to the
 

3521
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:03,789
small right and then there's back to the
neighbor of uh gravity general

3522
01:07:03,789 --> 01:07:03,799
neighbor of uh gravity general
 

3523
01:07:03,799 --> 01:07:06,430
neighbor of uh gravity general
relativity so and in the context of a

3524
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:06,440
relativity so and in the context of a
 

3525
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:07,670

01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:10,349
Theory of
Everything what's

01:07:10,349 --> 01:07:10,359
Everything what's
 

3529
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:12,710
Everything what's
traditionally the task of the

3530
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:12,720
traditionally the task of the
 

3531
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:16,029
traditionally the task of the
unification of these theories and why

3532
01:07:16,029 --> 01:07:16,039
unification of these theories and why
 

3533
01:07:16,039 --> 01:07:18,029
unification of these theories and why
the issue is you try to use the methods

3534
01:07:18,029 --> 01:07:18,039
the issue is you try to use the methods
 

3535
01:07:18,039 --> 01:07:20,150
the issue is you try to use the methods
of quantum field Theory to talk about

3536
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:20,160
of quantum field Theory to talk about
 

3537
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,390
of quantum field Theory to talk about
gravity and it doesn't work just like

3538
01:07:22,390 --> 01:07:22,400
gravity and it doesn't work just like
 

3539
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,470
gravity and it doesn't work just like
there are photons of light so there are

3540
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:24,480
there are photons of light so there are
 

3541
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,430
there are photons of light so there are
gravitons which are sort of the

3542
01:07:26,430 --> 01:07:26,440
gravitons which are sort of the
 

3543
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:28,390
gravitons which are sort of the
particles of gravity and when you try

3544
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:28,400
particles of gravity and when you try
 

3545
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,470
particles of gravity and when you try
and compute sort of the properties of

3546
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:30,480
and compute sort of the properties of
 

3547
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,950
and compute sort of the properties of
the of the particles of gravity the kind

3548
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:32,960
the of the particles of gravity the kind
 

3549
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:36,029
the of the particles of gravity the kind
of mathematical tricks that get used um

3550
01:07:36,029 --> 01:07:36,039
of mathematical tricks that get used um
 

3551
01:07:36,039 --> 01:07:37,789
of mathematical tricks that get used um
in working things out in Quantum field

3552
01:07:37,789 --> 01:07:37,799
in working things out in Quantum field
 

3553
01:07:37,799 --> 01:07:40,990
in working things out in Quantum field
Theory don't work and um that's um so

3554
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:41,000
Theory don't work and um that's um so
 

3555
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,950
Theory don't work and um that's um so
that's been a sort of fundamental issue

3556
01:07:42,950 --> 01:07:42,960
that's been a sort of fundamental issue
 

3557
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:44,750
that's been a sort of fundamental issue
and when you think about black holes

3558
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:44,760
and when you think about black holes
 

3559
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:47,430
and when you think about black holes
which are a place where uh sort of the

3560
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:47,440
which are a place where uh sort of the
 

3561
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,269
which are a place where uh sort of the
the the structure of space is um uh you

3562
01:07:50,269 --> 01:07:50,279
the the structure of space is um uh you
 

3563
01:07:50,279 --> 01:07:52,789
the the structure of space is um uh you
know has has sort of Rapid variation and

3564
01:07:52,789 --> 01:07:52,799
know has has sort of Rapid variation and
 

3565
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:55,230
know has has sort of Rapid variation and
you get kind of quantum effects mixed in

3566
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:55,240
you get kind of quantum effects mixed in
 

3567
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:57,510
you get kind of quantum effects mixed in
with effects from general relativity

3568
01:07:57,510 --> 01:07:57,520
with effects from general relativity
 

3569
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:58,870
with effects from general relativity
things get very complicated and there

3570
01:07:58,870 --> 01:07:58,880
things get very complicated and there
 

3571
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,589
things get very complicated and there
are apparent paradoxes and things like

3572
01:08:00,589 --> 01:08:00,599
are apparent paradoxes and things like
 

3573
01:08:00,599 --> 01:08:03,230
are apparent paradoxes and things like
that and people have you know there been

3574
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:03,240
that and people have you know there been
 

3575
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:05,549
that and people have you know there been
a bunch of mathematical developments in

3576
01:08:05,549 --> 01:08:05,559
a bunch of mathematical developments in
 

3577
01:08:05,559 --> 01:08:07,589
a bunch of mathematical developments in
in physics over the last I don't know 30

3578
01:08:07,589 --> 01:08:07,599
in physics over the last I don't know 30

01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:09,549
in physics over the last I don't know 30
years or so which have kind of picked

3580
01:08:09,549 --> 01:08:09,559
years or so which have kind of picked
 

3581
01:08:09,559 --> 01:08:11,990
years or so which have kind of picked
away at those kinds of issues and got

3582
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:12,000
away at those kinds of issues and got
 

3583
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,190
away at those kinds of issues and got
hints about how things might work um and

3584
01:08:15,190 --> 01:08:15,200
hints about how things might work um and
 

3585
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,550
hints about how things might work um and
but it hasn't been uh you know and the

3586
01:08:17,550 --> 01:08:17,560
but it hasn't been uh you know and the
 

3587
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,550
but it hasn't been uh you know and the
other thing to realize is as far as

3588
01:08:19,550 --> 01:08:19,560
other thing to realize is as far as
 

3589
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:21,550
other thing to realize is as far as
physics is concerned it's just like his

3590
01:08:21,550 --> 01:08:21,560
physics is concerned it's just like his
 

3591
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:23,590
physics is concerned it's just like his
general relativity his Quantum field

3592
01:08:23,590 --> 01:08:23,600
general relativity his Quantum field
 

3593
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,349
general relativity his Quantum field
Theory you know be happy yeah so do you

3594
01:08:26,349 --> 01:08:26,359
Theory you know be happy yeah so do you
 

3595
01:08:26,359 --> 01:08:28,789
Theory you know be happy yeah so do you
think there's a quantization of gravity

3596
01:08:28,789 --> 01:08:28,799
think there's a quantization of gravity
 

3597
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:30,709
think there's a quantization of gravity
so quantum gravity what do you think of

3598
01:08:30,709 --> 01:08:30,719
so quantum gravity what do you think of
 

3599
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:33,749
so quantum gravity what do you think of
efforts that people have tried to yeah

3600
01:08:33,749 --> 01:08:33,759
efforts that people have tried to yeah
 

3601
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:35,309
efforts that people have tried to yeah
what do you think in general of the

3602
01:08:35,309 --> 01:08:35,319
what do you think in general of the
 

3603
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:37,630
what do you think in general of the
efforts of the physics Community to try

3604
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:37,640
efforts of the physics Community to try
 

3605
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:40,630
efforts of the physics Community to try
to unify these laws so I think what's

3606
01:08:40,630 --> 01:08:40,640
to unify these laws so I think what's
 

3607
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:41,870
to unify these laws so I think what's
it's interesting I mean I would have

3608
01:08:41,870 --> 01:08:41,880
it's interesting I mean I would have
 

3609
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,749
it's interesting I mean I would have
said something very different before

3610
01:08:43,749 --> 01:08:43,759
said something very different before
 

3611
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:45,910
said something very different before
what's happened with our physics project

3612
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:45,920
what's happened with our physics project
 

3613
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,550
what's happened with our physics project
um I mean you know the remarkable thing

3614
01:08:48,550 --> 01:08:48,560
um I mean you know the remarkable thing
 

3615
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:51,709
um I mean you know the remarkable thing
is what we've been able to do is to make

3616
01:08:51,709 --> 01:08:51,719
is what we've been able to do is to make
 

3617
01:08:51,719 --> 01:08:54,789
is what we've been able to do is to make
from this very simple structurally

3618
01:08:54,789 --> 01:08:54,799
from this very simple structurally
 

3619
01:08:54,799 --> 01:08:58,070
from this very simple structurally
simple underlying set of ideas we've

3620
01:08:58,070 --> 01:08:58,080
simple underlying set of ideas we've
 

3621
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,950
simple underlying set of ideas we've
been able to build this this you know

3622
01:09:00,950 --> 01:09:00,960
been able to build this this you know
 

3623
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,110
been able to build this this you know
very elaborate structure that's both

3624
01:09:03,110 --> 01:09:03,120
very elaborate structure that's both
 

3625
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:05,269
very elaborate structure that's both
very abstract and very sort of

3626
01:09:05,269 --> 01:09:05,279
very abstract and very sort of
 

3627
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:08,189
very abstract and very sort of
mathematically rich and the big surprise

3628
01:09:08,189 --> 01:09:08,199
mathematically rich and the big surprise
 

3629
01:09:08,199 --> 01:09:10,110
mathematically rich and the big surprise
as far as I'm concerned is that it

3630
01:09:10,110 --> 01:09:10,120
as far as I'm concerned is that it
 

3631
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:12,189
as far as I'm concerned is that it
touches many of the ideas that people

3632
01:09:12,189 --> 01:09:12,199
touches many of the ideas that people
 

3633
01:09:12,199 --> 01:09:13,870
touches many of the ideas that people
have had so in other words things like

3634
01:09:13,870 --> 01:09:13,880
have had so in other words things like
 

3635
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,910
have had so in other words things like
string theory and so on uh twister

3636
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:15,920
string theory and so on uh twister
 

3637
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,430
string theory and so on uh twister
Theory it's like the you know we might

3638
01:09:18,430 --> 01:09:18,440
Theory it's like the you know we might
 

3639
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:20,189
Theory it's like the you know we might
have thought I had thought we're out on

3640
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:20,199
have thought I had thought we're out on
 

3641
01:09:20,199 --> 01:09:21,990
have thought I had thought we're out on
a prong we're building something that's

3642
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:22,000
a prong we're building something that's
 

3643
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,510
a prong we're building something that's
computational it's completely different

3644
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:23,520
computational it's completely different
 

3645
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,390
computational it's completely different
from what other people have done but

3646
01:09:25,390 --> 01:09:25,400
from what other people have done but
 

3647
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:27,229
from what other people have done but
actually it seems like what we've done

3648
01:09:27,229 --> 01:09:27,239
actually it seems like what we've done
 

3649
01:09:27,239 --> 01:09:28,990
actually it seems like what we've done
is to provide essentially the machine

3650
01:09:28,990 --> 01:09:29,000
is to provide essentially the machine
 

3651
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,149
is to provide essentially the machine
code that you know these things are are

3652
01:09:32,149 --> 01:09:32,159
code that you know these things are are
 

3653
01:09:32,159 --> 01:09:33,990
code that you know these things are are
various features of domain specific

3654
01:09:33,990 --> 01:09:34,000
various features of domain specific
 

3655
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,070
various features of domain specific
languages so to speak that talk about

3656
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:36,080
languages so to speak that talk about
 

3657
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:38,030
languages so to speak that talk about
various aspects of this machine code and

3658
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:38,040
various aspects of this machine code and
 

3659
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:39,870
various aspects of this machine code and
I think there's a this is something that

3660
01:09:39,870 --> 01:09:39,880
I think there's a this is something that
 

3661
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:42,149
I think there's a this is something that
to me is is is very exciting because it

3662
01:09:42,149 --> 01:09:42,159
to me is is is very exciting because it
 

3663
01:09:42,159 --> 01:09:45,590
to me is is is very exciting because it
allows one both for us to provide sort

3664
01:09:45,590 --> 01:09:45,600
allows one both for us to provide sort
 

3665
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,189
allows one both for us to provide sort
of a new foundation for what's been

3666
01:09:47,189 --> 01:09:47,199
of a new foundation for what's been
 

3667
01:09:47,199 --> 01:09:49,990
of a new foundation for what's been
thought about there and for the all the

3668
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:50,000
thought about there and for the all the
 

3669
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,269
thought about there and for the all the
work that's been done in those areas to

3670
01:09:52,269 --> 01:09:52,279
work that's been done in those areas to
 

3671
01:09:52,279 --> 01:09:54,830
work that's been done in those areas to
you know to give us you know more more

3672
01:09:54,830 --> 01:09:54,840
you know to give us you know more more
 

3673
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,750
you know to give us you know more more
momentum to be able to figure out what's

3674
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:56,760
momentum to be able to figure out what's
 

3675
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,270
momentum to be able to figure out what's
going on now you know people have sort

3676
01:09:58,270 --> 01:09:58,280
going on now you know people have sort
 

3677
01:09:58,280 --> 01:09:59,750
going on now you know people have sort
of hoped oh we're just going to be able

3678
01:09:59,750 --> 01:09:59,760
of hoped oh we're just going to be able
 

3679
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,510
of hoped oh we're just going to be able
to get you know String Theory to just

3680
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:02,520
to get you know String Theory to just
 

3681
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,950
to get you know String Theory to just
answer everything that hasn't worked out

3682
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:04,960
answer everything that hasn't worked out
 

3683
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,189
answer everything that hasn't worked out
and I think we now kind of can see a

3684
01:10:07,189 --> 01:10:07,199
and I think we now kind of can see a
 

3685
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:08,870
and I think we now kind of can see a
little bit about just sort of how far

3686
01:10:08,870 --> 01:10:08,880
little bit about just sort of how far
 

3687
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,510
little bit about just sort of how far
away certain kinds of things are from

3688
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:10,520
away certain kinds of things are from
 

3689
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:13,229
away certain kinds of things are from
being able to explain things some things

3690
01:10:13,229 --> 01:10:13,239
being able to explain things some things
 

3691
01:10:13,239 --> 01:10:15,030
being able to explain things some things
one of the big surprises to me actually

3692
01:10:15,030 --> 01:10:15,040
one of the big surprises to me actually
 

3693
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:17,070
one of the big surprises to me actually
I literally just got a message about one

3694
01:10:17,070 --> 01:10:17,080
I literally just got a message about one
 

3695
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:20,550
I literally just got a message about one
aspect of this is um uh the uh uh you

3696
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:20,560
aspect of this is um uh the uh uh you
 

3697
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,669
aspect of this is um uh the uh uh you
know it's turning out to be easier I

3698
01:10:22,669 --> 01:10:22,679
know it's turning out to be easier I
 

3699
01:10:22,679 --> 01:10:24,430
know it's turning out to be easier I
mean this project has been so much

3700
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:24,440
mean this project has been so much
 

3701
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:26,310
mean this project has been so much
easier than I could ever imagine it

3702
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:26,320
easier than I could ever imagine it
 

3703
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:29,229
easier than I could ever imagine it
would be that is I thought we would be

3704
01:10:29,229 --> 01:10:29,239
would be that is I thought we would be
 

3705
01:10:29,239 --> 01:10:31,229
would be that is I thought we would be
you know just about able to understand

3706
01:10:31,229 --> 01:10:31,239
you know just about able to understand
 

3707
01:10:31,239 --> 01:10:33,149
you know just about able to understand
the first 10us 100 seconds of the

3708
01:10:33,149 --> 01:10:33,159
the first 10us 100 seconds of the
 

3709
01:10:33,159 --> 01:10:35,470
the first 10us 100 seconds of the
universe and um you know it would be 100

3710
01:10:35,470 --> 01:10:35,480
universe and um you know it would be 100
 

3711
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:36,950
universe and um you know it would be 100
years before we get much further than

3712
01:10:36,950 --> 01:10:36,960
years before we get much further than
 

3713
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,070
years before we get much further than
that it's just turned out it actually

3714
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:39,080
that it's just turned out it actually
 

3715
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:41,510
that it's just turned out it actually
wasn't that hard I me we're not finished

3716
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:41,520
wasn't that hard I me we're not finished
 

3717
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,270
wasn't that hard I me we're not finished
but you know so you're you're you're

3718
01:10:43,270 --> 01:10:43,280
but you know so you're you're you're
 

3719
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,350
but you know so you're you're you're
seeing Echoes of all the disperate

3720
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:45,360
seeing Echoes of all the disperate
 

3721
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:48,229
seeing Echoes of all the disperate
theories of physics in this framework

3722
01:10:48,229 --> 01:10:48,239
theories of physics in this framework
 

3723
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:50,189
theories of physics in this framework
yes I mean it's a very interesting you

3724
01:10:50,189 --> 01:10:50,199
yes I mean it's a very interesting you
 

3725
01:10:50,199 --> 01:10:52,830
yes I mean it's a very interesting you
know sort of History of Science likee

3726
01:10:52,830 --> 01:10:52,840
know sort of History of Science likee
 

3727
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,669
know sort of History of Science likee
phenomenon I mean the best analogy that

3728
01:10:54,669 --> 01:10:54,679
phenomenon I mean the best analogy that
 

3729
01:10:54,679 --> 01:10:55,870
phenomenon I mean the best analogy that
I can see

3730
01:10:55,870 --> 01:10:55,880
I can see
 

3731
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:57,669
I can see

it's it's it's perhaps worth sort of
saying a little bit about kind of the

3890
01:13:58,870 --> 01:13:58,880
saying a little bit about kind of the
 

3891
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:01,830
saying a little bit about kind of the
the you know foundational ideas of of uh

3892
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:01,840
the you know foundational ideas of of uh
 

3893
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:03,790
the you know foundational ideas of of uh
of uh uh you know of these of these

3894
01:14:03,790 --> 01:14:03,800
of uh uh you know of these of these
 

3895
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:07,110
of uh uh you know of these of these
models and things great so can you maybe

3896
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:07,120
models and things great so can you maybe
 

3897
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:10,629
models and things great so can you maybe
uh can we like rewind we've talked about

3898
01:14:10,629 --> 01:14:10,639
uh can we like rewind we've talked about
 

3899
01:14:10,639 --> 01:14:11,990
uh can we like rewind we've talked about
a little bit but can you say like what

3900
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:12,000
a little bit but can you say like what
 

3901
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,189
a little bit but can you say like what
the central idea is of the Wolfram

3902
01:14:15,189 --> 01:14:15,199
the central idea is of the Wolfram
 

3903
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:18,149
the central idea is of the Wolfram
physics project right so so the question

3904
01:14:18,149 --> 01:14:18,159
physics project right so so the question
 

3905
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:20,470
physics project right so so the question
is we're interested in finding a sort of

3906
01:14:20,470 --> 01:14:20,480
is we're interested in finding a sort of
 

3907
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,709
is we're interested in finding a sort of
simple computational rule that describes

3908
01:14:22,709 --> 01:14:22,719
simple computational rule that describes
 

3909
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:24,870
simple computational rule that describes
our whole universe can we just pause on

3910
01:14:24,870 --> 01:14:24,880
our whole universe can we just pause on
 

3911
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:27,669
our whole universe can we just pause on
that I just so be that's such a

3912
01:14:27,669 --> 01:14:27,679
that I just so be that's such a
 

3913
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:30,830
that I just so be that's such a
beautiful that's such a beautiful idea

3914
01:14:30,830 --> 01:14:30,840
beautiful that's such a beautiful idea
 

3915
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:33,550
beautiful that's such a beautiful idea
that we can generate our universe from a

3916
01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:33,560
that we can generate our universe from a
 

3917
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:38,470
that we can generate our universe from a
from a uh from a data structure a simple

3918
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:38,480
from a uh from a data structure a simple
 

3919
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:41,030
from a uh from a data structure a simple
structure simple set of rules and we can

3920
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:41,040
structure simple set of rules and we can
 

3921
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,750
structure simple set of rules and we can
generate our entire universe yes that's

3922
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:43,760
generate our entire universe yes that's
 

3923
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,629
generate our entire universe yes that's
all inspiring

3924
01:14:45,629 --> 01:14:45,639
all inspiring
 

3925
01:14:45,639 --> 01:14:48,030
all inspiring
right but but so so you know the

3926
01:14:48,030 --> 01:14:48,040
right but but so so you know the
 

3927
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:50,510
right but but so so you know the
question is how do you actualize that

3928
01:14:50,510 --> 01:14:50,520
question is how do you actualize that
 

3929
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:53,149
question is how do you actualize that
what might this rule be like and so one

3930
01:14:53,149 --> 01:14:53,159
what might this rule be like and so one
 

3931
01:14:53,159 --> 01:14:55,350
what might this rule be like and so one
thing you quickly realize is if you're

3932
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:55,360
thing you quickly realize is if you're
 

3933
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,750
thing you quickly realize is if you're
going to pack everything about our

3934
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:56,760
going to pack everything about our
 

3935
01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:00,110
going to pack everything about our
universe into this tiny rule not much

3936
01:15:00,110 --> 01:15:00,120
universe into this tiny rule not much
 

3937
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:01,430
universe into this tiny rule not much
that we are familiar with in our

3938
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:01,440
that we are familiar with in our
 

3939
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:03,990
that we are familiar with in our
universe will be obvious in that

3940
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:04,000
universe will be obvious in that
 

3941
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,750
universe will be obvious in that
rule so you don't get to fit all these

3942
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:06,760
rule so you don't get to fit all these
 

3943
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:08,229
rule so you don't get to fit all these
parameters of the universe all these

3944
01:15:08,229 --> 01:15:08,239
parameters of the universe all these
 

3945
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:09,750
parameters of the universe all these
features of you know this is how space

3946
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:09,760
features of you know this is how space
 

3947
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,910
features of you know this is how space
works this is how time works etc etc etc

3948
01:15:11,910 --> 01:15:11,920
works this is how time works etc etc etc
 

3949
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:13,390
works this is how time works etc etc etc
you don't get to fit that all it all has

3950
01:15:13,390 --> 01:15:13,400
you don't get to fit that all it all has
 

3951
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:15,990
you don't get to fit that all it all has
to be sort of packed in to this this

3952
01:15:15,990 --> 01:15:16,000
to be sort of packed in to this this
 

3953
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,189
to be sort of packed in to this this
thing something much smaller much more

3954
01:15:18,189 --> 01:15:18,199
thing something much smaller much more
 

3955
01:15:18,199 --> 01:15:20,350
thing something much smaller much more
basic much lower level machine code so

3956
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:20,360
basic much lower level machine code so
 

3957
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:22,590
basic much lower level machine code so
to speak than that and all the stuff

3958
01:15:22,590 --> 01:15:22,600
to speak than that and all the stuff
 

3959
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:24,110
to speak than that and all the stuff
that we're familiar with has to kind of

3960
01:15:24,110 --> 01:15:24,120
that we're familiar with has to kind of
 

3961
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:26,790
that we're familiar with has to kind of
emerge from the operation of so the rule

3962
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:26,800
emerge from the operation of so the rule
 

3963
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,669
emerge from the operation of so the rule
in itself because of the computational

3964
01:15:29,669 --> 01:15:29,679
in itself because of the computational
 

3965
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:31,189
in itself because of the computational
reducibility is not going to tell you

3966
01:15:31,189 --> 01:15:31,199
reducibility is not going to tell you
 

3967
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:34,590
reducibility is not going to tell you
the story it's not going to give you the

3968
01:15:34,590 --> 01:15:34,600
the story it's not going to give you the
 

3969
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:37,470
the story it's not going to give you the
answer to uh it's not going to let you

3970
01:15:37,470 --> 01:15:37,480
answer to uh it's not going to let you
 

3971
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:39,110
answer to uh it's not going to let you
predict what you're going to have for

3972
01:15:39,110 --> 01:15:39,120
predict what you're going to have for
 

3973
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,510
predict what you're going to have for
lunch tomorrow and it's not going to let

3974
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:41,520
lunch tomorrow and it's not going to let
 

3975
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,270
lunch tomorrow and it's not going to let
you predict basically anything about

3976
01:15:43,270 --> 01:15:43,280
you predict basically anything about
 

3977
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:45,149
you predict basically anything about
your life about the universe right but

3978
01:15:45,149 --> 01:15:45,159
your life about the universe right but
 

3979
01:15:45,159 --> 01:15:46,669
your life about the universe right but
and you're not going to be able to see

3980
01:15:46,669 --> 01:15:46,679
and you're not going to be able to see
 

3981
01:15:46,679 --> 01:15:49,229
and you're not going to be able to see
in that rule oh there's the three for

3982
01:15:49,229 --> 01:15:49,239
in that rule oh there's the three for
 

3983
01:15:49,239 --> 01:15:50,750
in that rule oh there's the three for
the number of dimensions of space and so

3984
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:50,760
the number of dimensions of space and so
 

3985
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:52,350
the number of dimensions of space and so
on that's not going to be there so space

3986
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:52,360
on that's not going to be there so space
 

3987
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:54,950
on that's not going to be there so space
time is not going to be obviously right

3988
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:54,960
time is not going to be obviously right
 

3989
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,709
time is not going to be obviously right
so the question is then what what is the

3990
01:15:56,709 --> 01:15:56,719
so the question is then what what is the
 

3991
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:59,030
so the question is then what what is the
universe made of that's that's a it's a

3992
01:15:59,030 --> 01:15:59,040
universe made of that's that's a it's a
 

3993
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,110
universe made of that's that's a it's a
basic question and we've had some

3994
01:16:01,110 --> 01:16:01,120
basic question and we've had some
 

3995
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:02,510
basic question and we've had some
assumptions about what the universe is

3996
01:16:02,510 --> 01:16:02,520
assumptions about what the universe is
 

3997
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:04,910
assumptions about what the universe is
made of for the last few thousand years

3998
01:16:04,910 --> 01:16:04,920
made of for the last few thousand years
 

3999
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:07,310
made of for the last few thousand years
that I think in some cases I just turn

4000
01:16:07,310 --> 01:16:07,320
that I think in some cases I just turn
 

4001
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:09,350
that I think in some cases I just turn
out not to be right and you know the

4002
01:16:09,350 --> 01:16:09,360
out not to be right and you know the
 

4003
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:12,189
out not to be right and you know the
most important assumption is that space

4004
01:16:12,189 --> 01:16:12,199
most important assumption is that space
 

4005
01:16:12,199 --> 01:16:15,590
most important assumption is that space
is a continuous thing that is that you

4006
01:16:15,590 --> 01:16:15,600
is a continuous thing that is that you
 

4007
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,950
is a continuous thing that is that you
can if you say let's pick a point in

4008
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:18,960
can if you say let's pick a point in
 

4009
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:20,229
can if you say let's pick a point in
space we're going to do geometry we're

4010
01:16:20,229 --> 01:16:20,239
space we're going to do geometry we're
 

4011
01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:22,030
space we're going to do geometry we're
going to pick a point we can pick a

4012
01:16:22,030 --> 01:16:22,040
going to pick a point we can pick a
 

4013
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:24,350
going to pick a point we can pick a
point absolutely anywhere in space

4014
01:16:24,350 --> 01:16:24,360
point absolutely anywhere in space
 

4015
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:26,629
point absolutely anywhere in space
precisely numbers we can specify of

4016
01:16:26,629 --> 01:16:26,639
precisely numbers we can specify of
 

4017
01:16:26,639 --> 01:16:28,629
precisely numbers we can specify of
where that point is in fact you know

4018
01:16:28,629 --> 01:16:28,639
where that point is in fact you know
 

4019
01:16:28,639 --> 01:16:30,350
where that point is in fact you know
uclid who kind of wrote down the

4020
01:16:30,350 --> 01:16:30,360
uclid who kind of wrote down the
 

4021
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:33,149
uclid who kind of wrote down the
original kind of atiz of geometry back

4022
01:16:33,149 --> 01:16:33,159
original kind of atiz of geometry back
 

4023
01:16:33,159 --> 01:16:36,510
original kind of atiz of geometry back
in 300 BC or so um you know his his very

4024
01:16:36,510 --> 01:16:36,520
in 300 BC or so um you know his his very
 

4025
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:39,189
in 300 BC or so um you know his his very
first definition he says a point is that

4026
01:16:39,189 --> 01:16:39,199
first definition he says a point is that
 

4027
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:41,990
first definition he says a point is that
which has no part a point is this is

4028
01:16:41,990 --> 01:16:42,000
which has no part a point is this is
 

4029
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,270
which has no part a point is this is
this you know uh this indivisible you

4030
01:16:45,270 --> 01:16:45,280
this you know uh this indivisible you
 

4031
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:48,350
this you know uh this indivisible you
know infinitesimal thing okay so we

4032
01:16:48,350 --> 01:16:48,360
know infinitesimal thing okay so we
 

4033
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:49,990
know infinitesimal thing okay so we
might have said that about material

4034
01:16:49,990 --> 01:16:50,000
might have said that about material
 

4035
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,470
might have said that about material
objects we might have said that about

4036
01:16:51,470 --> 01:16:51,480
objects we might have said that about
 

4037
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:53,430
objects we might have said that about
water for example we might have said

4038
01:16:53,430 --> 01:16:53,440
water for example we might have said
 

4039
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,270
water for example we might have said
water is a continuous thing that we can

4040
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:55,280
water is a continuous thing that we can
 

4041
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:57,629
water is a continuous thing that we can
just uh you know pick any point we want

4042
01:16:57,629 --> 01:16:57,639
just uh you know pick any point we want
 

4043
01:16:57,639 --> 01:16:59,709
just uh you know pick any point we want
in in in some water but actually we know

4044
01:16:59,709 --> 01:16:59,719
in in in some water but actually we know
 

4045
01:16:59,719 --> 01:17:01,709
in in in some water but actually we know
it isn't true we know that water is made

4046
01:17:01,709 --> 01:17:01,719
it isn't true we know that water is made
 

4047
01:17:01,719 --> 01:17:04,669
it isn't true we know that water is made
of molecules that are discrete and so

4048
01:17:04,669 --> 01:17:04,679
of molecules that are discrete and so
 

4049
01:17:04,679 --> 01:17:06,669
of molecules that are discrete and so
the question one fundamental question is

4050
01:17:06,669 --> 01:17:06,679
the question one fundamental question is
 

4051
01:17:06,679 --> 01:17:09,390
the question one fundamental question is
what is space made of and so one of the

4052
01:17:09,390 --> 01:17:09,400
what is space made of and so one of the
 

4053
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:10,870
what is space made of and so one of the
things that's sort of a starting point

4054
01:17:10,870 --> 01:17:10,880
things that's sort of a starting point
 

4055
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:14,030
things that's sort of a starting point
for what I've done is to think of space

4056
01:17:14,030 --> 01:17:14,040
for what I've done is to think of space
 

4057
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:16,430
for what I've done is to think of space
as a discrete thing to think of there

4058
01:17:16,430 --> 01:17:16,440
as a discrete thing to think of there
 

4059
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:18,910
as a discrete thing to think of there
being sort of atoms of space just as

4060
01:17:18,910 --> 01:17:18,920
being sort of atoms of space just as
 

4061
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:20,470
being sort of atoms of space just as
there are atoms of material things

4062
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:20,480
there are atoms of material things
 

4063
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:23,149
there are atoms of material things
although very different kinds of atoms

4064
01:17:23,149 --> 01:17:23,159
although very different kinds of atoms
 

4065
01:17:23,159 --> 01:17:25,590
although very different kinds of atoms
and by the way I mean this idea you know

4066
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:25,600
and by the way I mean this idea you know
 

4067
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,149
and by the way I mean this idea you know
there were ancient Greek philosophers

4068
01:17:27,149 --> 01:17:27,159
there were ancient Greek philosophers
 

4069
01:17:27,159 --> 01:17:29,189
there were ancient Greek philosophers
who had this idea there were you know

4070
01:17:29,189 --> 01:17:29,199
who had this idea there were you know
 

4071
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:30,470
who had this idea there were you know
Einstein actually thought this is

4072
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:30,480
Einstein actually thought this is
 

4073
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:31,870
Einstein actually thought this is
probably how things would work out I

4074
01:17:31,870 --> 01:17:31,880
probably how things would work out I
 

4075
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,990
probably how things would work out I
mean he said you know repeatedly he

4076
01:17:33,990 --> 01:17:34,000
mean he said you know repeatedly he
 

4077
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,669
mean he said you know repeatedly he
thought that is way it would work out we

4078
01:17:35,669 --> 01:17:35,679
thought that is way it would work out we
 

4079
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:38,350
thought that is way it would work out we
don't have the mathematical Tools in our

4080
01:17:38,350 --> 01:17:38,360
don't have the mathematical Tools in our
 

4081
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:41,270
don't have the mathematical Tools in our
time which was 1940s 1950s and so on to

4082
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:41,280
time which was 1940s 1950s and so on to
 

4083
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:44,149
time which was 1940s 1950s and so on to
explore this like the way he thought you

4084
01:17:44,149 --> 01:17:44,159
explore this like the way he thought you
 

4085
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:47,229
explore this like the way he thought you
mean that there is something very very

4086
01:17:47,229 --> 01:17:47,239
mean that there is something very very
 

4087
01:17:47,239 --> 01:17:51,229
mean that there is something very very
small and discreete that's underlying

4088
01:17:51,229 --> 01:17:51,239
small and discreete that's underlying
 

4089
01:17:51,239 --> 01:17:54,110
small and discreete that's underlying
space space yes and that that means that

4090
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:54,120
space space yes and that that means that
 

4091
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:56,590
space space yes and that that means that
so you know the mathematical Theory

4092
01:17:56,590 --> 01:17:56,600
so you know the mathematical Theory
 

4093
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:59,110
so you know the mathematical Theory
mathematical theories in physics assume

4094
01:17:59,110 --> 01:17:59,120
mathematical theories in physics assume
 

4095
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:01,669
mathematical theories in physics assume
that space can be described just as a

4096
01:18:01,669 --> 01:18:01,679
that space can be described just as a
 

4097
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:03,310
that space can be described just as a
continuous thing you can just pick

4098
01:18:03,310 --> 01:18:03,320
continuous thing you can just pick
 

4099
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:04,790
continuous thing you can just pick
coordinates and the coordinates can have

4100
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:04,800
coordinates and the coordinates can have
 

4101
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,470
coordinates and the coordinates can have
any values and that's how you define

4102
01:18:07,470 --> 01:18:07,480
any values and that's how you define
 

4103
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:09,189
any values and that's how you define
space space is this just sort of

4104
01:18:09,189 --> 01:18:09,199
space space is this just sort of
 

4105
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:12,110
space space is this just sort of
background uh sort of theater on which

4106
01:18:12,110 --> 01:18:12,120
background uh sort of theater on which
 

4107
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:14,350
background uh sort of theater on which
the universe operates but can we draw a

4108
01:18:14,350 --> 01:18:14,360
the universe operates but can we draw a
 

4109
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:15,590
the universe operates but can we draw a
distinction

4110
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:15,600
distinction
 

4111
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:18,550
distinction
between space as a thing that could be

4112
01:18:18,550 --> 01:18:18,560
between space as a thing that could be
 

4113
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:23,709
between space as a thing that could be
described by uh three values coordinates

4114
01:18:23,709 --> 01:18:23,719
described by uh three values coordinates
 

4115
01:18:23,719 --> 01:18:26,229
described by uh three values coordinates
and how you're are you are you using the

4116
01:18:26,229 --> 01:18:26,239
and how you're are you are you using the
 

4117
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:29,270
and how you're are you are you using the
word space more generally when you say

4118
01:18:29,270 --> 01:18:29,280
word space more generally when you say
 

4119
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:31,070
word space more generally when you say
no I'm I'm just talking about space as

4120
01:18:31,070 --> 01:18:31,080
no I'm I'm just talking about space as
 

4121
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:33,709
no I'm I'm just talking about space as
in what we experience in in in the

4122
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:33,719
in what we experience in in in the
 

4123
01:18:33,719 --> 01:18:36,870
in what we experience in in in the
universe so you think this 3D aspect of

4124
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:36,880
universe so you think this 3D aspect of
 

4125
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:39,030
universe so you think this 3D aspect of
it is fundamental no I don't think that

4126
01:18:39,030 --> 01:18:39,040
it is fundamental no I don't think that
 

4127
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,910
it is fundamental no I don't think that
3D is fundamental at all actually I

4128
01:18:40,910 --> 01:18:40,920
3D is fundamental at all actually I
 

4129
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:43,590
3D is fundamental at all actually I
think that the what's the the the thing

4130
01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:43,600
think that the what's the the the thing
 

4131
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,590
think that the what's the the the thing
that has been assumed is that space is

4132
01:18:46,590 --> 01:18:46,600
that has been assumed is that space is
 

4133
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:48,750
that has been assumed is that space is
this continuous thing where you can just

4134
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:48,760
this continuous thing where you can just
 

4135
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:50,470
this continuous thing where you can just
describe it by let's say three numbers

4136
01:18:50,470 --> 01:18:50,480
describe it by let's say three numbers
 

4137
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,629
describe it by let's say three numbers
for instance but most important thing

4138
01:18:52,629 --> 01:18:52,639
for instance but most important thing
 

4139
01:18:52,639 --> 01:18:54,189
for instance but most important thing
about that is that you can describe it

4140
01:18:54,189 --> 01:18:54,199
about that is that you can describe it
 

4141
01:18:54,199 --> 01:18:56,790
about that is that you can describe it
by PR prise numbers because you can pick

4142
01:18:56,790 --> 01:18:56,800
by PR prise numbers because you can pick
 

4143
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,709
by PR prise numbers because you can pick
any point in space and you can talk

4144
01:18:58,709 --> 01:18:58,719
any point in space and you can talk
 

4145
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:00,950
any point in space and you can talk
about motions any infinitesimal Motion

4146
01:19:00,950 --> 01:19:00,960
about motions any infinitesimal Motion
 

4147
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:02,870
about motions any infinitesimal Motion
in space and that's what continuous

4148
01:19:02,870 --> 01:19:02,880
in space and that's what continuous
 

4149
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,270
in space and that's what continuous
means that's what continuous means

4150
01:19:04,270 --> 01:19:04,280
means that's what continuous means
 

4151
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:05,590
means that's what continuous means
that's what you know Newton invented

4152
01:19:05,590 --> 01:19:05,600
that's what you know Newton invented
 

4153
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,030
that's what you know Newton invented
calculus to describe these kind of

4154
01:19:07,030 --> 01:19:07,040
calculus to describe these kind of
 

4155
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:09,430
calculus to describe these kind of
continuous small variations and so on

4156
01:19:09,430 --> 01:19:09,440
continuous small variations and so on
 

4157
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:11,070
continuous small variations and so on
that was that's kind of a fundamental

4158
01:19:11,070 --> 01:19:11,080
that was that's kind of a fundamental
 

4159
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,110
that was that's kind of a fundamental
idea from uclid on that's been a

4160
01:19:13,110 --> 01:19:13,120
idea from uclid on that's been a
 

4161
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:16,110
idea from uclid on that's been a
fundamental idea about space and so is

4162
01:19:16,110 --> 01:19:16,120
fundamental idea about space and so is
 

4163
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:19,189
fundamental idea about space and so is
that right or wrong uh it's it's not

4164
01:19:19,189 --> 01:19:19,199
that right or wrong uh it's it's not
 

4165
01:19:19,199 --> 01:19:22,390
that right or wrong uh it's it's not
right it's not right it's it's it's it's

4166
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:22,400
right it's not right it's it's it's it's
 

4167
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,350
right it's not right it's it's it's it's
right at the level of our experience

4168
01:19:24,350 --> 01:19:24,360
right at the level of our experience
 

4169
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:26,510
right at the level of our experience
most of of the time it's not right at

4170
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:26,520
most of of the time it's not right at
 

4171
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:28,030
most of of the time it's not right at
the level of the machine code so to

4172
01:19:28,030 --> 01:19:28,040
the level of the machine code so to
 

4173
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:31,629
the level of the machine code so to
speak and so machine code yeah of the

4174
01:19:31,629 --> 01:19:31,639
speak and so machine code yeah of the
 

4175
01:19:31,639 --> 01:19:33,470
speak and so machine code yeah of the
simulation that's right that's right

4176
01:19:33,470 --> 01:19:33,480
simulation that's right that's right
 

4177
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:35,310
simulation that's right that's right
they're the very lowest level of the

4178
01:19:35,310 --> 01:19:35,320
they're the very lowest level of the
 

4179
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:38,070
they're the very lowest level of the
fabric of the universe at least under

4180
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:38,080
fabric of the universe at least under
 

4181
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:42,110
fabric of the universe at least under
the the the will from physics model is

4182
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:42,120
the the the will from physics model is
 

4183
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:45,149
the the the will from physics model is
your sense is as discreet right so so

4184
01:19:45,149 --> 01:19:45,159
your sense is as discreet right so so
 

4185
01:19:45,159 --> 01:19:47,550
your sense is as discreet right so so
now what does that mean so it means what

4186
01:19:47,550 --> 01:19:47,560
now what does that mean so it means what
 

4187
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:51,950
now what does that mean so it means what
what is space then so in in um models

4188
01:19:51,950 --> 01:19:51,960
what is space then so in in um models
 

4189
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:54,430
what is space then so in in um models
the basic idea is you say there are

4190
01:19:54,430 --> 01:19:54,440
the basic idea is you say there are
 

4191
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:56,550
the basic idea is you say there are
these sort of atoms of space they're

4192
01:19:56,550 --> 01:19:56,560
these sort of atoms of space they're
 

4193
01:19:56,560 --> 01:20:00,030
these sort of atoms of space they're
these points that represent you know

4194
01:20:00,030 --> 01:20:00,040
these points that represent you know
 

4195
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:02,270
these points that represent you know
represent places in space but they're

4196
01:20:02,270 --> 01:20:02,280
represent places in space but they're
 

4197
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:04,910
represent places in space but they're
just discrete points and the only thing

4198
01:20:04,910 --> 01:20:04,920
just discrete points and the only thing
 

4199
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:06,550
just discrete points and the only thing
we know about them is how they're

4200
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:06,560
we know about them is how they're
 

4201
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,790
we know about them is how they're
connected to each other we don't know

4202
01:20:08,790 --> 01:20:08,800
connected to each other we don't know
 

4203
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:09,830
connected to each other we don't know
where they are they don't have

4204
01:20:09,830 --> 01:20:09,840
where they are they don't have
 

4205
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,430
where they are they don't have
coordinates we don't get to say this is

4206
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:11,440
coordinates we don't get to say this is
 

4207
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:13,390
coordinates we don't get to say this is
a position such and such it's just

4208
01:20:13,390 --> 01:20:13,400
a position such and such it's just
 

4209
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:15,590
a position such and such it's just
here's a big bag of points like in our

4210
01:20:15,590 --> 01:20:15,600
here's a big bag of points like in our
 

4211
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,229
here's a big bag of points like in our
universe there might be 10 to the 100 of

4212
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:17,239
universe there might be 10 to the 100 of
 

4213
01:20:17,239 --> 01:20:20,149
universe there might be 10 to the 100 of
these points and all we know is this

4214
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:20,159
these points and all we know is this
 

4215
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:22,470
these points and all we know is this
point is connected to this other point

4216
01:20:22,470 --> 01:20:22,480
point is connected to this other point
 

4217
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,110
point is connected to this other point
so it's like you know all we have is the

4218
01:20:24,110 --> 01:20:24,120
so it's like you know all we have is the
 

4219
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:26,030
so it's like you know all we have is the
friend nwor so to speak we don't we

4220
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:26,040
friend nwor so to speak we don't we
 

4221
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:27,950
friend nwor so to speak we don't we
don't have you know people's you know

4222
01:20:27,950 --> 01:20:27,960
don't have you know people's you know
 

4223
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,790
don't have you know people's you know
physical addresses all we have is the

4224
01:20:29,790 --> 01:20:29,800
physical addresses all we have is the
 

4225
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:32,070
physical addresses all we have is the
friend network of these points yeah the

4226
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:32,080
friend network of these points yeah the
 

4227
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:33,750
friend network of these points yeah the
underlying nature of reality is kind of

4228
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:33,760
underlying nature of reality is kind of
 

4229
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:35,750
underlying nature of reality is kind of
like a Facebook uh we don't know their

4230
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:35,760
like a Facebook uh we don't know their
 

4231
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,510
like a Facebook uh we don't know their
location but we have the friends yeah

4232
01:20:37,510 --> 01:20:37,520
location but we have the friends yeah
 

4233
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,990
location but we have the friends yeah
yeah right we we we know which point is

4234
01:20:39,990 --> 01:20:40,000
yeah right we we we know which point is
 

4235
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,390
yeah right we we we know which point is
connected to which other points and and

4236
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:42,400
connected to which other points and and
 

4237
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:44,030
connected to which other points and and
that's all we know and so you might say

4238
01:20:44,030 --> 01:20:44,040
that's all we know and so you might say
 

4239
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:45,990
that's all we know and so you might say
well how on Earth can you get something

4240
01:20:45,990 --> 01:20:46,000
well how on Earth can you get something
 

4241
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,910
well how on Earth can you get something
which is like our experience of of you

4242
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:48,920
which is like our experience of of you
 

4243
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:50,470
which is like our experience of of you
know what seems like continuous space

4244
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:50,480
know what seems like continuous space
 

4245
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:52,310
know what seems like continuous space
well the answer is by the time you have

4246
01:20:52,310 --> 01:20:52,320
well the answer is by the time you have
 

4247
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:55,229
well the answer is by the time you have
10 to the 100 of these things there they

4248
01:20:55,229 --> 01:20:55,239
10 to the 100 of these things there they
 

4249
01:20:55,239 --> 01:20:57,830
10 to the 100 of these things there they
those connections can work in such a way

4250
01:20:57,830 --> 01:20:57,840
those connections can work in such a way
 

4251
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,910
those connections can work in such a way
that on a large scale it will seem to be

4252
01:21:00,910 --> 01:21:00,920
that on a large scale it will seem to be
 

4253
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:03,229
that on a large scale it will seem to be
like continuous space in let's say three

4254
01:21:03,229 --> 01:21:03,239
like continuous space in let's say three
 

4255
01:21:03,239 --> 01:21:04,790
like continuous space in let's say three
dimensions or some other number of

4256
01:21:04,790 --> 01:21:04,800
dimensions or some other number of
 

4257
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,950
dimensions or some other number of
Dimensions or 2.6 Dimensions or whatever

4258
01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:06,960
Dimensions or 2.6 Dimensions or whatever
 

4259
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,590
Dimensions or 2.6 Dimensions or whatever
else because they're much much much much

4260
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:09,600
else because they're much much much much
 

4261
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:13,590
else because they're much much much much
larger so like the uh the number of

4262
01:21:13,590 --> 01:21:13,600
larger so like the uh the number of
 

4263
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,110
larger so like the uh the number of
relationships here we're talking about

4264
01:21:15,110 --> 01:21:15,120
relationships here we're talking about
 

4265
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,750
relationships here we're talking about
is just a humongous amount so the the

4266
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:17,760
is just a humongous amount so the the
 

4267
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,070
is just a humongous amount so the the
kind of thing you're talking about is

4268
01:21:19,070 --> 01:21:19,080
kind of thing you're talking about is
 

4269
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:21,430
kind of thing you're talking about is
very very very small relative to our

4270
01:21:21,430 --> 01:21:21,440
very very very small relative to our
 

4271
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,550
very very very small relative to our
experience of daily life right so I mean

4272
01:21:23,550 --> 01:21:23,560
experience of daily life right so I mean
 

4273
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:25,070
experience of daily life right so I mean
you know we don't know exactly the size

4274
01:21:25,070 --> 01:21:25,080
you know we don't know exactly the size
 

4275
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:30,550
you know we don't know exactly the size
but maybe maybe uh uh 10 Theus uh maybe

4276
01:21:30,550 --> 01:21:30,560
but maybe maybe uh uh 10 Theus uh maybe
 

4277
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:33,550
but maybe maybe uh uh 10 Theus uh maybe
around 10 Theus 100 m so you know the

4278
01:21:33,550 --> 01:21:33,560
around 10 Theus 100 m so you know the
 

4279
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:34,910
around 10 Theus 100 m so you know the
size of to give a comparison you know

4280
01:21:34,910 --> 01:21:34,920
size of to give a comparison you know
 

4281
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:38,470
size of to give a comparison you know
the size of a of a proton is 10us 15 M

4282
01:21:38,470 --> 01:21:38,480
the size of a of a proton is 10us 15 M
 

4283
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:40,950
the size of a of a proton is 10us 15 M
and so this is something incredibly tiny

4284
01:21:40,950 --> 01:21:40,960
and so this is something incredibly tiny
 

4285
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:44,430
and so this is something incredibly tiny
compared to that um and and the the idea

4286
01:21:44,430 --> 01:21:44,440
compared to that um and and the the idea
 

4287
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:46,189
compared to that um and and the the idea
that from that would emerge the

4288
01:21:46,189 --> 01:21:46,199
that from that would emerge the
 

4289
01:21:46,199 --> 01:21:50,149
that from that would emerge the
experience of continuous space is

4290
01:21:50,149 --> 01:21:50,159
experience of continuous space is
 

4291
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:52,629
experience of continuous space is
mindblowing what's your intuition why

4292
01:21:52,629 --> 01:21:52,639
mindblowing what's your intuition why
 

4293
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:55,510
mindblowing what's your intuition why
that's possible like first of all I mean

4294
01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:55,520
that's possible like first of all I mean
 

4295
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:58,310
that's possible like first of all I mean
we'll get in into it but I don't know if

4296
01:21:58,310 --> 01:21:58,320
we'll get in into it but I don't know if
 

4297
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:00,950
we'll get in into it but I don't know if
we will through the medium of

4298
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:00,960
we will through the medium of
 

4299
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:04,270
we will through the medium of
conversation but the construct of

4300
01:22:04,270 --> 01:22:04,280
conversation but the construct of
 

4301
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:07,030
conversation but the construct of
hypergraphs is just beautiful right

4302
01:22:07,030 --> 01:22:07,040
hypergraphs is just beautiful right
 

4303
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:08,830
hypergraphs is just beautiful right
cellometer beautiful we'll talk about it

4304
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:08,840
cellometer beautiful we'll talk about it
 

4305
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:10,709
cellometer beautiful we'll talk about it
but okay but but but this thing about

4306
01:22:10,709 --> 01:22:10,719
but okay but but but this thing about
 

4307
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:12,390
but okay but but but this thing about
you know continuity arising from

4308
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:12,400
you know continuity arising from
 

4309
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:15,990
you know continuity arising from
discrete systems is in today's world is

4310
01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:16,000
discrete systems is in today's world is
 

4311
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,510
discrete systems is in today's world is
actually not so surprising I mean you

4312
01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:17,520
actually not so surprising I mean you
 

4313
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,470
actually not so surprising I mean you
know your average computer screen right

4314
01:22:19,470 --> 01:22:19,480
know your average computer screen right
 

4315
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:20,709
know your average computer screen right
every computer screen is made of

4316
01:22:20,709 --> 01:22:20,719
every computer screen is made of
 

4317
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:23,709
every computer screen is made of
discrete pixels yet we have the you know

4318
01:22:23,709 --> 01:22:23,719
discrete pixels yet we have the you know
 

4319
01:22:23,719 --> 01:22:25,629
discrete pixels yet we have the you know
we have the idea that we're seeing these

4320
01:22:25,629 --> 01:22:25,639
we have the idea that we're seeing these
 

4321
01:22:25,639 --> 01:22:27,750
we have the idea that we're seeing these
continuous pictures I mean it's you know

4322
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:27,760
continuous pictures I mean it's you know
 

4323
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,510
continuous pictures I mean it's you know
the fact that on a large scale

4324
01:22:29,510 --> 01:22:29,520
the fact that on a large scale
 

4325
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,750
the fact that on a large scale
continuity can arise from lots of

4326
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:31,760
continuity can arise from lots of
 

4327
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:34,470
continuity can arise from lots of
discrete elements this is at some level

4328
01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:34,480
discrete elements this is at some level
 

4329
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:38,669
discrete elements this is at some level
unsurprising now but wait but the pixels

4330
01:22:38,669 --> 01:22:38,679
unsurprising now but wait but the pixels
 

4331
01:22:38,679 --> 01:22:43,390
unsurprising now but wait but the pixels
have uh a very definitive structure of

4332
01:22:43,390 --> 01:22:43,400
have uh a very definitive structure of
 

4333
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:46,750
have uh a very definitive structure of
Neighbors on on a computer screen right

4334
01:22:46,750 --> 01:22:46,760
Neighbors on on a computer screen right
 

4335
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:52,270
Neighbors on on a computer screen right
there is no concept of spatial of space

4336
01:22:52,270 --> 01:22:52,280
there is no concept of spatial of space
 

4337
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:55,149
there is no concept of spatial of space
inherent in the underly fabric of

4338
01:22:55,149 --> 01:22:55,159
inherent in the underly fabric of
 

4339
01:22:55,159 --> 01:22:57,629
inherent in the underly fabric of
reality right right right so so the the

4340
01:22:57,629 --> 01:22:57,639
reality right right right so so the the
 

4341
01:22:57,639 --> 01:22:59,629
reality right right right so so the the
the point is but there are cases where

4342
01:22:59,629 --> 01:22:59,639
the point is but there are cases where
 

4343
01:22:59,639 --> 01:23:00,910
the point is but there are cases where
there are so for example let's just

4344
01:23:00,910 --> 01:23:00,920
there are so for example let's just
 

4345
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:03,669
there are so for example let's just
imagine you have a square grid okay and

4346
01:23:03,669 --> 01:23:03,679
imagine you have a square grid okay and
 

4347
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:05,790
imagine you have a square grid okay and
at every point on the grid you have one

4348
01:23:05,790 --> 01:23:05,800
at every point on the grid you have one
 

4349
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,950
at every point on the grid you have one
of these atoms of space and it's

4350
01:23:07,950 --> 01:23:07,960
of these atoms of space and it's
 

4351
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:10,270
of these atoms of space and it's
connected to four other four other atoms

4352
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:10,280
connected to four other four other atoms
 

4353
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:11,910
connected to four other four other atoms
of space on the you know Northeast

4354
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:11,920
of space on the you know Northeast
 

4355
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:14,990
of space on the you know Northeast
southwest corners right um there you

4356
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:15,000
southwest corners right um there you
 

4357
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,669
southwest corners right um there you
have something where if you zoom out

4358
01:23:16,669 --> 01:23:16,679
have something where if you zoom out
 

4359
01:23:16,679 --> 01:23:19,110
have something where if you zoom out
from that it's like a computer screen

4360
01:23:19,110 --> 01:23:19,120
from that it's like a computer screen
 

4361
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:22,310
from that it's like a computer screen
yeah so the relationship creates the the

4362
01:23:22,310 --> 01:23:22,320
yeah so the relationship creates the the
 

4363
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:25,830
yeah so the relationship creates the the
spatial like the relationship creates a

4364
01:23:25,830 --> 01:23:25,840
spatial like the relationship creates a
 

4365
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:29,510
spatial like the relationship creates a
constraint which then in an emerging

4366
01:23:29,510 --> 01:23:29,520
constraint which then in an emerging
 

4367
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:35,229
constraint which then in an emerging
sense creates a like yeah like a uh

4368
01:23:35,229 --> 01:23:35,239
sense creates a like yeah like a uh
 

4369
01:23:35,239 --> 01:23:37,390
sense creates a like yeah like a uh
basically a spatial coordinate for that

4370
01:23:37,390 --> 01:23:37,400
basically a spatial coordinate for that
 

4371
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:39,189
basically a spatial coordinate for that
thing yeah right even though the

4372
01:23:39,189 --> 01:23:39,199
thing yeah right even though the
 

4373
01:23:39,199 --> 01:23:40,629
thing yeah right even though the
individual point doesn't have a space

4374
01:23:40,629 --> 01:23:40,639
individual point doesn't have a space
 

4375
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:41,870
individual point doesn't have a space
even though the individual point doesn't

4376
01:23:41,870 --> 01:23:41,880
even though the individual point doesn't
 

4377
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:43,390
even though the individual point doesn't
know anything it just knows what it's

4378
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:43,400
know anything it just knows what it's
 

4379
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:45,310
know anything it just knows what it's
you know what its neighbors are the on a

4380
01:23:45,310 --> 01:23:45,320
you know what its neighbors are the on a
 

4381
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:48,510
you know what its neighbors are the on a
large scale it can be described by

4382
01:23:48,510 --> 01:23:48,520
large scale it can be described by
 

4383
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:50,990
large scale it can be described by
saying oh it looks like it's a you know

4384
01:23:50,990 --> 01:23:51,000
saying oh it looks like it's a you know
 

4385
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,270
saying oh it looks like it's a you know
this grid zoomed out grid you can say

4386
01:23:53,270 --> 01:23:53,280
this grid zoomed out grid you can say
 

4387
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:54,590
this grid zoomed out grid you can say
well you can describe these different

4388
01:23:54,590 --> 01:23:54,600
well you can describe these different
 

4389
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:55,950
well you can describe these different
points by saying they have certain

4390
01:23:55,950 --> 01:23:55,960
points by saying they have certain
 

4391
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:58,870
points by saying they have certain
positions coordinates Etc now in the in

4392
01:23:58,870 --> 01:23:58,880
positions coordinates Etc now in the in
 

4393
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,149
positions coordinates Etc now in the in
the sort of real setup it's more

4394
01:24:00,149 --> 01:24:00,159
the sort of real setup it's more
 

4395
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:01,510
the sort of real setup it's more
complicated than that it isn't just a

4396
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:01,520
complicated than that it isn't just a
 

4397
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:03,910
complicated than that it isn't just a
square Grid or something it's something

4398
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:03,920
square Grid or something it's something
 

4399
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:06,030
square Grid or something it's something
much more Dynamic and complicated which

4400
01:24:06,030 --> 01:24:06,040
much more Dynamic and complicated which
 

4401
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:09,110
much more Dynamic and complicated which
we'll talk about but um uh so you know

4402
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:09,120
we'll talk about but um uh so you know
 

4403
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:11,830
we'll talk about but um uh so you know
first the first idea the first key idea

4404
01:24:11,830 --> 01:24:11,840
first the first idea the first key idea
 

4405
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:13,790
first the first idea the first key idea
is you know what's the universe made of

4406
01:24:13,790 --> 01:24:13,800
is you know what's the universe made of
 

4407
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:15,709
is you know what's the universe made of
it's made of atoms of space basically

4408
01:24:15,709 --> 01:24:15,719
it's made of atoms of space basically
 

4409
01:24:15,719 --> 01:24:17,910
it's made of atoms of space basically
with these connections between them what

4410
01:24:17,910 --> 01:24:17,920
with these connections between them what
 

4411
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:20,629
with these connections between them what
kind of connections do they have well so

4412
01:24:20,629 --> 01:24:20,639
kind of connections do they have well so
 

4413
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:22,189
kind of connections do they have well so
a the simplest kind of thing you might

4414
01:24:22,189 --> 01:24:22,199
a the simplest kind of thing you might
 

4415
01:24:22,199 --> 01:24:25,310
a the simplest kind of thing you might
say is we've got something like a graph

4416
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:25,320
say is we've got something like a graph
 

4417
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:28,830
say is we've got something like a graph
where every uh every atom of space uh

4418
01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:28,840
where every uh every atom of space uh
 

4419
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,350
where every uh every atom of space uh
where we have these edges that go

4420
01:24:30,350 --> 01:24:30,360
where we have these edges that go
 

4421
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:32,110
where we have these edges that go
between atom these connections that go

4422
01:24:32,110 --> 01:24:32,120
between atom these connections that go
 

4423
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:33,830
between atom these connections that go
between atoms of space we're not saying

4424
01:24:33,830 --> 01:24:33,840
between atoms of space we're not saying
 

4425
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,189
between atoms of space we're not saying
how long these edges are we're just

4426
01:24:35,189 --> 01:24:35,199
how long these edges are we're just
 

4427
01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:37,149
how long these edges are we're just
saying there is a connection from from

4428
01:24:37,149 --> 01:24:37,159
saying there is a connection from from
 

4429
01:24:37,159 --> 01:24:38,870
saying there is a connection from from
this place to the from this atom to this

4430
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:38,880
this place to the from this atom to this
 

4431
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:41,149
this place to the from this atom to this
atom just a quick pause because there's

4432
01:24:41,149 --> 01:24:41,159
atom just a quick pause because there's
 

4433
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:44,510
atom just a quick pause because there's
a lot of very people that listen to this

4434
01:24:44,510 --> 01:24:44,520
a lot of very people that listen to this
 

4435
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:46,430
a lot of very people that listen to this
just to clarify because I did a poll

4436
01:24:46,430 --> 01:24:46,440
just to clarify because I did a poll
 

4437
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:48,629
just to clarify because I did a poll
actually what do you think a graph is a

4438
01:24:48,629 --> 01:24:48,639
actually what do you think a graph is a
 

4439
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:50,629
actually what do you think a graph is a
long time ago and it's kind of funny how

4440
01:24:50,629 --> 01:24:50,639
long time ago and it's kind of funny how
 

4441
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:54,390
long time ago and it's kind of funny how
few people know the term graph uh

4442
01:24:54,390 --> 01:24:54,400
few people know the term graph uh
 

4443
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,510
few people know the term graph uh
outside of computer science it's let's

4444
01:24:56,510 --> 01:24:56,520
outside of computer science it's let's
 

4445
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:57,750
outside of computer science it's let's
call it a network I think that's that's

4446
01:24:57,750 --> 01:24:57,760
call it a network I think that's that's
 

4447
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,590
call it a network I think that's that's
call a network is better so but every

4448
01:24:59,590 --> 01:24:59,600
call a network is better so but every
 

4449
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,149
call a network is better so but every
time I like the word graph though so

4450
01:25:01,149 --> 01:25:01,159
time I like the word graph though so
 

4451
01:25:01,159 --> 01:25:03,750
time I like the word graph though so
let's define let's just say that graph

4452
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:03,760
let's define let's just say that graph
 

4453
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:06,590
let's define let's just say that graph
we'll use terms nodes and edges maybe

4454
01:25:06,590 --> 01:25:06,600
we'll use terms nodes and edges maybe
 

4455
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:08,550
we'll use terms nodes and edges maybe
and it's just uh nodes

4456
01:25:08,550 --> 01:25:08,560
and it's just uh nodes
 

4457
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:11,830
and it's just uh nodes
represent some abstract entity and then

4458
01:25:11,830 --> 01:25:11,840
represent some abstract entity and then
 

4459
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,910
represent some abstract entity and then
the edges represent relationships

4460
01:25:13,910 --> 01:25:13,920
the edges represent relationships
 

4461
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:15,990
the edges represent relationships
between those entities right exactly so

4462
01:25:15,990 --> 01:25:16,000
between those entities right exactly so
 

4463
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,189
between those entities right exactly so
that's what graph say sorry so so there

4464
01:25:18,189 --> 01:25:18,199
that's what graph say sorry so so there
 

4465
01:25:18,199 --> 01:25:20,790
that's what graph say sorry so so there
you go so that's the basic structure

4466
01:25:20,790 --> 01:25:20,800
you go so that's the basic structure
 

4467
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,310
you go so that's the basic structure
that is that is the simplest case of a

4468
01:25:22,310 --> 01:25:22,320
that is that is the simplest case of a
 

4469
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:25,350
that is that is the simplest case of a
basic structure actually uh it tends to

4470
01:25:25,350 --> 01:25:25,360
basic structure actually uh it tends to
 

4471
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:28,030
basic structure actually uh it tends to
be better to think about hypergraphs so

4472
01:25:28,030 --> 01:25:28,040
be better to think about hypergraphs so
 

4473
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:31,430
be better to think about hypergraphs so
a hypergraph is just instead of saying

4474
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:31,440
a hypergraph is just instead of saying
 

4475
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,550
a hypergraph is just instead of saying
uh there are connections between Pairs

4476
01:25:33,550 --> 01:25:33,560
uh there are connections between Pairs
 

4477
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:35,790
uh there are connections between Pairs
of things we say there are connections

4478
01:25:35,790 --> 01:25:35,800
of things we say there are connections
 

4479
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:37,510
of things we say there are connections
between any number of things so there

4480
01:25:37,510 --> 01:25:37,520
between any number of things so there
 

4481
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:40,270
between any number of things so there
might be Turner edges so instead of

4482
01:25:40,270 --> 01:25:40,280
might be Turner edges so instead of
 

4483
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:43,109
might be Turner edges so instead of
instead of just having uh two points are

4484
01:25:43,109 --> 01:25:43,119
instead of just having uh two points are
 

4485
01:25:43,119 --> 01:25:45,350
instead of just having uh two points are
connected by an edge you say three

4486
01:25:45,350 --> 01:25:45,360
connected by an edge you say three
 

4487
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:47,550
connected by an edge you say three
points are all associated with a

4488
01:25:47,550 --> 01:25:47,560
points are all associated with a
 

4489
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:49,629
points are all associated with a
hyperedge are all connected by hyper

4490
01:25:49,629 --> 01:25:49,639
hyperedge are all connected by hyper
 

4491
01:25:49,639 --> 01:25:52,990
hyperedge are all connected by hyper
Edge that's just at some level that's at

4492
01:25:52,990 --> 01:25:53,000
Edge that's just at some level that's at
 

4493
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,790
Edge that's just at some level that's at
some level that's a detail it's a detail

4494
01:25:54,790 --> 01:25:54,800
some level that's a detail it's a detail
 

4495
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:57,709
some level that's a detail it's a detail
that happens to make the um for me you

4496
01:25:57,709 --> 01:25:57,719
that happens to make the um for me you
 

4497
01:25:57,719 --> 01:25:59,270
that happens to make the um for me you
know sort of in the history of this

4498
01:25:59,270 --> 01:25:59,280
know sort of in the history of this
 

4499
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,109
know sort of in the history of this
project the realization that you could

4500
01:26:01,109 --> 01:26:01,119
project the realization that you could
 

4501
01:26:01,119 --> 01:26:03,310
project the realization that you could
do things that way broke out of certain

4502
01:26:03,310 --> 01:26:03,320
do things that way broke out of certain
 

4503
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:05,229
do things that way broke out of certain
kinds of arbitrariness that I felt that

4504
01:26:05,229 --> 01:26:05,239
kinds of arbitrariness that I felt that
 

4505
01:26:05,239 --> 01:26:06,870
kinds of arbitrariness that I felt that
there was in the model before I had seen

4506
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:06,880
there was in the model before I had seen
 

4507
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:09,790
there was in the model before I had seen
how this worked I mean all a hypergraph

4508
01:26:09,790 --> 01:26:09,800
how this worked I mean all a hypergraph
 

4509
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:13,070
how this worked I mean all a hypergraph
can be mapped to a graph it's just a

4510
01:26:13,070 --> 01:26:13,080
can be mapped to a graph it's just a
 

4511
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:15,070
can be mapped to a graph it's just a
convenient representation mathematically

4512
01:26:15,070 --> 01:26:15,080
convenient representation mathematically
 

4513
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:16,390
convenient representation mathematically
speaking right that's correct that's

4514
01:26:16,390 --> 01:26:16,400
speaking right that's correct that's
 

4515
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:19,109
speaking right that's correct that's
correct but so then so okay so the the

4516
01:26:19,109 --> 01:26:19,119
correct but so then so okay so the the
 

4517
01:26:19,119 --> 01:26:21,189
correct but so then so okay so the the
first question the first idea of these

4518
01:26:21,189 --> 01:26:21,199
first question the first idea of these
 

4519
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:24,350
first question the first idea of these
models of ours is spaces made of these

4520
01:26:24,350 --> 01:26:24,360
models of ours is spaces made of these
 

4521
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:26,590
models of ours is spaces made of these
know connected sort of atoms of space

4522
01:26:26,590 --> 01:26:26,600
know connected sort of atoms of space
 

4523
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:29,830
know connected sort of atoms of space
the next idea is space is all there is

4524
01:26:29,830 --> 01:26:29,840
the next idea is space is all there is
 

4525
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:32,070
the next idea is space is all there is
there's nothing except for this space So

4526
01:26:32,070 --> 01:26:32,080
there's nothing except for this space So
 

4527
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:34,149
there's nothing except for this space So
In traditional ideas in physics people

4528
01:26:34,149 --> 01:26:34,159
In traditional ideas in physics people
 

4529
01:26:34,159 --> 01:26:36,109
In traditional ideas in physics people
have said there's space it's kind of a

4530
01:26:36,109 --> 01:26:36,119
have said there's space it's kind of a
 

4531
01:26:36,119 --> 01:26:38,109
have said there's space it's kind of a
background and then there's matter all

4532
01:26:38,109 --> 01:26:38,119
background and then there's matter all
 

4533
01:26:38,119 --> 01:26:39,510
background and then there's matter all
these particles electrons all these

4534
01:26:39,510 --> 01:26:39,520
these particles electrons all these
 

4535
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:43,470
these particles electrons all these
other things which exist in space right

4536
01:26:43,470 --> 01:26:43,480
other things which exist in space right
 

4537
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:45,550
other things which exist in space right
but in this model one of the key ideas

4538
01:26:45,550 --> 01:26:45,560
but in this model one of the key ideas
 

4539
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:48,669
but in this model one of the key ideas
is there's nothing except space so in

4540
01:26:48,669 --> 01:26:48,679
is there's nothing except space so in
 

4541
01:26:48,679 --> 01:26:50,629
is there's nothing except space so in
other words everything that has that

4542
01:26:50,629 --> 01:26:50,639
other words everything that has that
 

4543
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:53,189
other words everything that has that
exists in the universe is a feature of

4544
01:26:53,189 --> 01:26:53,199
exists in the universe is a feature of
 

4545
01:26:53,199 --> 01:26:55,709
exists in the universe is a feature of
this hypergraph so how can that possibly

4546
01:26:55,709 --> 01:26:55,719
this hypergraph so how can that possibly
 

4547
01:26:55,719 --> 01:26:58,750
this hypergraph so how can that possibly
be well the way that works is that there

4548
01:26:58,750 --> 01:26:58,760
be well the way that works is that there
 

4549
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,990
be well the way that works is that there
are certain uh structures in this

4550
01:27:00,990 --> 01:27:01,000
are certain uh structures in this
 

4551
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,270
are certain uh structures in this
hypergraph where you say that little

4552
01:27:03,270 --> 01:27:03,280
hypergraph where you say that little
 

4553
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:06,149
hypergraph where you say that little
twisty knotted thing we don't know

4554
01:27:06,149 --> 01:27:06,159
twisty knotted thing we don't know
 

4555
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:08,189
twisty knotted thing we don't know
exactly how this works yet but but we we

4556
01:27:08,189 --> 01:27:08,199
exactly how this works yet but but we we
 

4557
01:27:08,199 --> 01:27:09,950
exactly how this works yet but but we we
have sort of idea about how it works

4558
01:27:09,950 --> 01:27:09,960
have sort of idea about how it works
 

4559
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:11,790
have sort of idea about how it works
mathematically this sort of Twisted

4560
01:27:11,790 --> 01:27:11,800
mathematically this sort of Twisted
 

4561
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:13,870
mathematically this sort of Twisted
knotted thing that's the core of an

4562
01:27:13,870 --> 01:27:13,880
knotted thing that's the core of an
 

4563
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:16,470
knotted thing that's the core of an
electron this thing over there that has

4564
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:16,480
electron this thing over there that has
 

4565
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,830
electron this thing over there that has
this different form that's something

4566
01:27:17,830 --> 01:27:17,840
this different form that's something
 

4567
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:20,350
this different form that's something
else so the different peculiarities of

4568
01:27:20,350 --> 01:27:20,360
else so the different peculiarities of
 

4569
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:23,550
else so the different peculiarities of
the structure of this graph are the very

4570
01:27:23,550 --> 01:27:23,560
the structure of this graph are the very
 

4571
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:24,950
the structure of this graph are the very
things

4572
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:24,960
things
 

4573
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:28,149
things
that uh we think of as the particles

4574
01:27:28,149 --> 01:27:28,159
that uh we think of as the particles
 

4575
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:30,350
that uh we think of as the particles
inside the space but in fact it's just a

4576
01:27:30,350 --> 01:27:30,360
inside the space but in fact it's just a
 

4577
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:32,709
inside the space but in fact it's just a
property of of space mindblowing first

4578
01:27:32,709 --> 01:27:32,719
property of of space mindblowing first
 

4579
01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:35,189
property of of space mindblowing first
of all that it's mind-blowing and we'll

4580
01:27:35,189 --> 01:27:35,199
of all that it's mind-blowing and we'll
 

4581
01:27:35,199 --> 01:27:37,550
of all that it's mind-blowing and we'll
probably talk in its Simplicity and

4582
01:27:37,550 --> 01:27:37,560
probably talk in its Simplicity and
 

4583
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:40,750
probably talk in its Simplicity and
Beauty yes I think it's very beautiful I

4584
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:40,760
Beauty yes I think it's very beautiful I
 

4585
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:43,109
Beauty yes I think it's very beautiful I
this is I'm but okay so but that's space

4586
01:27:43,109 --> 01:27:43,119
this is I'm but okay so but that's space
 

4587
01:27:43,119 --> 01:27:44,669
this is I'm but okay so but that's space
and then there's another concept we

4588
01:27:44,669 --> 01:27:44,679
and then there's another concept we
 

4589
01:27:44,679 --> 01:27:46,870
and then there's another concept we
didn't really kind of mention but you

4590
01:27:46,870 --> 01:27:46,880
didn't really kind of mention but you
 

4591
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:49,510
didn't really kind of mention but you
thinking of computation as a like a

4592
01:27:49,510 --> 01:27:49,520
thinking of computation as a like a
 

4593
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,310
thinking of computation as a like a
transformation let's talk about time in

4594
01:27:51,310 --> 01:27:51,320
transformation let's talk about time in
 

4595
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:52,990
transformation let's talk about time in
a second let's let's just let's just I

4596
01:27:52,990 --> 01:27:53,000
a second let's let's just let's just I
 

4597
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,950
a second let's let's just let's just I
mean on the subject oface

4598
01:27:54,950 --> 01:27:54,960
mean on the subject oface
 

4599
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:56,229
mean on the subject oface
that you know there's this question of

4600
01:27:56,229 --> 01:27:56,239
that you know there's this question of
 

4601
01:27:56,239 --> 01:27:58,430
that you know there's this question of
kind of what you know there's this idea

4602
01:27:58,430 --> 01:27:58,440
kind of what you know there's this idea
 

4603
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:01,229
kind of what you know there's this idea
there is this hypergraph it represents

4604
01:28:01,229 --> 01:28:01,239
there is this hypergraph it represents
 

4605
01:28:01,239 --> 01:28:02,750
there is this hypergraph it represents
space and it represents everything

4606
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:02,760
space and it represents everything
 

4607
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:04,350
space and it represents everything
that's in Space the features of that

4608
01:28:04,350 --> 01:28:04,360
that's in Space the features of that
 

4609
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:06,910
that's in Space the features of that
hypergraph you can say certain features

4610
01:28:06,910 --> 01:28:06,920
hypergraph you can say certain features
 

4611
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:08,910
hypergraph you can say certain features
in this part we do know certain features

4612
01:28:08,910 --> 01:28:08,920
in this part we do know certain features
 

4613
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:10,430
in this part we do know certain features
of the hypergraph represent the presence

4614
01:28:10,430 --> 01:28:10,440
of the hypergraph represent the presence
 

4615
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:12,430
of the hypergraph represent the presence
of energy for example or the presence of

4616
01:28:12,430 --> 01:28:12,440
of energy for example or the presence of
 

4617
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:14,910
of energy for example or the presence of
mass or momentum and we know what the

4618
01:28:14,910 --> 01:28:14,920
mass or momentum and we know what the
 

4619
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:16,189
mass or momentum and we know what the
features of the hypergraph that

4620
01:28:16,189 --> 01:28:16,199
features of the hypergraph that
 

4621
01:28:16,199 --> 01:28:18,430
features of the hypergraph that
represent those things are but it's all

4622
01:28:18,430 --> 01:28:18,440
represent those things are but it's all
 

4623
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:20,709
represent those things are but it's all
just the same hypergraph so one thing

4624
01:28:20,709 --> 01:28:20,719
just the same hypergraph so one thing
 

4625
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:22,470
just the same hypergraph so one thing
you might ask is you know if you just

4626
01:28:22,470 --> 01:28:22,480
you might ask is you know if you just
 

4627
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:24,430
you might ask is you know if you just
look at this hypergraph and you say and

4628
01:28:24,430 --> 01:28:24,440
look at this hypergraph and you say and
 

4629
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:25,669
look at this hypergraph and you say and
we're going to talk about sort of what

4630
01:28:25,669 --> 01:28:25,679
we're going to talk about sort of what
 

4631
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:28,430
we're going to talk about sort of what
the hypergraph does but if you say you

4632
01:28:28,430 --> 01:28:28,440
the hypergraph does but if you say you
 

4633
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:30,350
the hypergraph does but if you say you
know how much of what's going on in this

4634
01:28:30,350 --> 01:28:30,360
know how much of what's going on in this
 

4635
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:33,709
know how much of what's going on in this
hypergraph is things we know and care

4636
01:28:33,709 --> 01:28:33,719
hypergraph is things we know and care
 

4637
01:28:33,719 --> 01:28:35,830
hypergraph is things we know and care
about like particles and atoms of

4638
01:28:35,830 --> 01:28:35,840
about like particles and atoms of
 

4639
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:37,669
about like particles and atoms of
electrons and all this kind of thing and

4640
01:28:37,669 --> 01:28:37,679
electrons and all this kind of thing and
 

4641
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:40,870
electrons and all this kind of thing and
how much is just the background of space

4642
01:28:40,870 --> 01:28:40,880
how much is just the background of space
 

4643
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:43,750
how much is just the background of space
so it turns out so far as in one rough

4644
01:28:43,750 --> 01:28:43,760
so it turns out so far as in one rough
 

4645
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:46,149
so it turns out so far as in one rough
estimate of this all everything that we

4646
01:28:46,149 --> 01:28:46,159
estimate of this all everything that we
 

4647
01:28:46,159 --> 01:28:48,910
estimate of this all everything that we
care about in the universe is only one

4648
01:28:48,910 --> 01:28:48,920
care about in the universe is only one
 

4649
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:51,430
care about in the universe is only one
part in 10 to 120 of what's actually

4650
01:28:51,430 --> 01:28:51,440
part in 10 to 120 of what's actually
 

4651
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:53,310
part in 10 to 120 of what's actually
going on the vast majority of what's

4652
01:28:53,310 --> 01:28:53,320
going on the vast majority of what's
 

4653
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:55,550
going on the vast majority of what's
Happening is purely things that maintain

4654
01:28:55,550 --> 01:28:55,560
Happening is purely things that maintain
 

4655
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:57,790
Happening is purely things that maintain
the structure of space that in other

4656
01:28:57,790 --> 01:28:57,800
the structure of space that in other
 

4657
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:00,070
the structure of space that in other
words that the things that are the

4658
01:29:00,070 --> 01:29:00,080
words that the things that are the
 

4659
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:03,229
words that the things that are the
features of space that are the things

4660
01:29:03,229 --> 01:29:03,239
features of space that are the things
 

4661
01:29:03,239 --> 01:29:04,910
features of space that are the things
that we consider notable like the

4662
01:29:04,910 --> 01:29:04,920
that we consider notable like the
 

4663
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:06,950
that we consider notable like the
presence of particles and so on that's a

4664
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:06,960
presence of particles and so on that's a
 

4665
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:09,350
presence of particles and so on that's a
tiny little piece of froth on the top of

4666
01:29:09,350 --> 01:29:09,360
tiny little piece of froth on the top of
 

4667
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:12,669
tiny little piece of froth on the top of
all this activity that mostly is just

4668
01:29:12,669 --> 01:29:12,679
all this activity that mostly is just
 

4669
01:29:12,679 --> 01:29:14,709
all this activity that mostly is just
intended to you know mostly I can't say

4670
01:29:14,709 --> 01:29:14,719
intended to you know mostly I can't say
 

4671
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:16,750
intended to you know mostly I can't say
intended there's no intention here that

4672
01:29:16,750 --> 01:29:16,760
intended there's no intention here that
 

4673
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:19,270
intended there's no intention here that
just maintains the structure of

4674
01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:19,280
just maintains the structure of
 

4675
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:24,149
just maintains the structure of
space let me let me load that in it's uh

4676
01:29:24,149 --> 01:29:24,159
space let me let me load that in it's uh
 

4677
01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:26,550
space let me let me load that in it's uh
it just makes me feel so good as a human

4678
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:26,560
it just makes me feel so good as a human
 

4679
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:29,390
it just makes me feel so good as a human
being well to be the froth on the one

4680
01:29:29,390 --> 01:29:29,400
being well to be the froth on the one
 

4681
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:32,830
being well to be the froth on the one
and the 10 to the 120 or something of

4682
01:29:32,830 --> 01:29:32,840
and the 10 to the 120 or something of
 

4683
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:38,070
and the 10 to the 120 or something of
well and also just humbling um how in

4684
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:38,080
well and also just humbling um how in
 

4685
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:40,470
well and also just humbling um how in
this mathematical framework how much

4686
01:29:40,470 --> 01:29:40,480
this mathematical framework how much
 

4687
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:42,149
this mathematical framework how much
work needs to be done on the

4688
01:29:42,149 --> 01:29:42,159
work needs to be done on the
 

4689
01:29:42,159 --> 01:29:44,990
work needs to be done on the
infrastructure right of our universe

4690
01:29:44,990 --> 01:29:45,000
infrastructure right of our universe
 

4691
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,390
infrastructure right of our universe
right to maintain the infrastructure of

4692
01:29:46,390 --> 01:29:46,400
right to maintain the infrastructure of
 

4693
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,629
right to maintain the infrastructure of
our universe is a lot of work we are we

4694
01:29:48,629 --> 01:29:48,639
our universe is a lot of work we are we
 

4695
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:51,510
our universe is a lot of work we are we
are merely writing a little tiny things

4696
01:29:51,510 --> 01:29:51,520
are merely writing a little tiny things
 

4697
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:54,550
are merely writing a little tiny things
on top of that infrastructure but but

4698
01:29:54,550 --> 01:29:54,560
on top of that infrastructure but but
 

4699
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:56,030
on top of that infrastructure but but
you know you you were just starting to

4700
01:29:56,030 --> 01:29:56,040
you know you you were just starting to
 

4701
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:57,430
you know you you were just starting to
to talk a little bit about what I you

4702
01:29:57,430 --> 01:29:57,440
to talk a little bit about what I you
 

4703
01:29:57,440 --> 01:30:00,189
to talk a little bit about what I you
know we talked about you know space that

4704
01:30:00,189 --> 01:30:00,199
know we talked about you know space that
 

4705
01:30:00,199 --> 01:30:02,390
know we talked about you know space that
represents all the stuff that's in the

4706
01:30:02,390 --> 01:30:02,400
represents all the stuff that's in the
 

4707
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,550
represents all the stuff that's in the
universe the question is what does that

4708
01:30:04,550 --> 01:30:04,560
universe the question is what does that
 

4709
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:07,629
universe the question is what does that
stuff do and for that we have to start

4710
01:30:07,629 --> 01:30:07,639
stuff do and for that we have to start
 

4711
01:30:07,639 --> 01:30:10,550
stuff do and for that we have to start
talking about time and what is time and

4712
01:30:10,550 --> 01:30:10,560
talking about time and what is time and
 

4713
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:14,070
talking about time and what is time and
so on and you know one of the the basic

4714
01:30:14,070 --> 01:30:14,080
so on and you know one of the the basic
 

4715
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:16,390
so on and you know one of the the basic
idea of this model is time is the

4716
01:30:16,390 --> 01:30:16,400
idea of this model is time is the
 

4717
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,350
idea of this model is time is the
progression of computation so in other

4718
01:30:18,350 --> 01:30:18,360
progression of computation so in other
 

4719
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:21,550
progression of computation so in other
words we have a a structure of space and

4720
01:30:21,550 --> 01:30:21,560
words we have a a structure of space and
 

4721
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:23,310
words we have a a structure of space and
there is a rule that says how that

4722
01:30:23,310 --> 01:30:23,320
there is a rule that says how that
 

4723
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:25,390
there is a rule that says how that
structure of space will change and it's

4724
01:30:25,390 --> 01:30:25,400
structure of space will change and it's
 

4725
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:27,189
structure of space will change and it's
the application the repeated application

4726
01:30:27,189 --> 01:30:27,199
the application the repeated application
 

4727
01:30:27,199 --> 01:30:30,590
the application the repeated application
of that rule that defines the progress

4728
01:30:30,590 --> 01:30:30,600
of that rule that defines the progress
 

4729
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:33,510
of that rule that defines the progress
of time um and what does the rule look

4730
01:30:33,510 --> 01:30:33,520
of time um and what does the rule look
 

4731
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:36,149
of time um and what does the rule look
like in in the space of hyperg grass

4732
01:30:36,149 --> 01:30:36,159
like in in the space of hyperg grass
 

4733
01:30:36,159 --> 01:30:38,430
like in in the space of hyperg grass
right so what the rule says is something

4734
01:30:38,430 --> 01:30:38,440
right so what the rule says is something
 

4735
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:39,950
right so what the rule says is something
like if you have a little tiny piece of

4736
01:30:39,950 --> 01:30:39,960
like if you have a little tiny piece of
 

4737
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:42,669
like if you have a little tiny piece of
hypergraph that looks like this then it

4738
01:30:42,669 --> 01:30:42,679
hypergraph that looks like this then it
 

4739
01:30:42,679 --> 01:30:44,229
hypergraph that looks like this then it
will be transformed into a piece of

4740
01:30:44,229 --> 01:30:44,239
will be transformed into a piece of
 

4741
01:30:44,239 --> 01:30:47,229
will be transformed into a piece of
hypergraph that looks like this so

4742
01:30:47,229 --> 01:30:47,239
hypergraph that looks like this so
 

4743
01:30:47,239 --> 01:30:48,870
hypergraph that looks like this so
that's all it says it says you pick up

4744
01:30:48,870 --> 01:30:48,880
that's all it says it says you pick up
 

4745
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:52,270
that's all it says it says you pick up
these elements of space and the you can

4746
01:30:52,270 --> 01:30:52,280
these elements of space and the you can
 

4747
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:54,510
these elements of space and the you can
think of these these uh edges these

4748
01:30:54,510 --> 01:30:54,520
think of these these uh edges these
 

4749
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:56,310
think of these these uh edges these
hyper edges as being relations between

4750
01:30:56,310 --> 01:30:56,320
hyper edges as being relations between
 

4751
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:59,590
hyper edges as being relations between
elements in space you might pick up uh

4752
01:30:59,590 --> 01:30:59,600
elements in space you might pick up uh
 

4753
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:02,270
elements in space you might pick up uh
these two relations between elements in

4754
01:31:02,270 --> 01:31:02,280
these two relations between elements in
 

4755
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:04,270
these two relations between elements in
space and we're not saying where those

4756
01:31:04,270 --> 01:31:04,280
space and we're not saying where those
 

4757
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:05,750
space and we're not saying where those
elements are or what they are but every

4758
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:05,760
elements are or what they are but every
 

4759
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,629
elements are or what they are but every
time there's a certain arrangement of

4760
01:31:07,629 --> 01:31:07,639
time there's a certain arrangement of
 

4761
01:31:07,639 --> 01:31:10,270
time there's a certain arrangement of
elements in space then arrangement in

4762
01:31:10,270 --> 01:31:10,280
elements in space then arrangement in
 

4763
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:12,310
elements in space then arrangement in
the sense of the way they're connected

4764
01:31:12,310 --> 01:31:12,320
the sense of the way they're connected
 

4765
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:14,070
the sense of the way they're connected
then we transform it into some other

4766
01:31:14,070 --> 01:31:14,080
then we transform it into some other
 

4767
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:15,830
then we transform it into some other
Arrangement so there's a little tiny

4768
01:31:15,830 --> 01:31:15,840
Arrangement so there's a little tiny
 

4769
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,310
Arrangement so there's a little tiny
pattern and you transform it into

4770
01:31:17,310 --> 01:31:17,320
pattern and you transform it into
 

4771
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:19,070
pattern and you transform it into
another little pattern that's right and

4772
01:31:19,070 --> 01:31:19,080
another little pattern that's right and
 

4773
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:21,629
another little pattern that's right and
then because of this I mean again it's

4774
01:31:21,629 --> 01:31:21,639
then because of this I mean again it's
 

4775
01:31:21,639 --> 01:31:23,669
then because of this I mean again it's
kind of similar to Cellular atomine that

4776
01:31:23,669 --> 01:31:23,679
kind of similar to Cellular atomine that
 

4777
01:31:23,679 --> 01:31:26,149
kind of similar to Cellular atomine that
like yes on paper the rule looks like

4778
01:31:26,149 --> 01:31:26,159
like yes on paper the rule looks like
 

4779
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:29,550
like yes on paper the rule looks like
super simple it's like uh yeah

4780
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:29,560
super simple it's like uh yeah
 

4781
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:32,350
super simple it's like uh yeah
okay yeah like yeah right from this the

4782
01:31:32,350 --> 01:31:32,360
okay yeah like yeah right from this the
 

4783
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:34,910
okay yeah like yeah right from this the
universe can be born uh but like once

4784
01:31:34,910 --> 01:31:34,920
universe can be born uh but like once
 

4785
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:37,189
universe can be born uh but like once
you start applying it beautiful

4786
01:31:37,189 --> 01:31:37,199
you start applying it beautiful
 

4787
01:31:37,199 --> 01:31:39,870
you start applying it beautiful
structure starts being potentially can

4788
01:31:39,870 --> 01:31:39,880
structure starts being potentially can
 

4789
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:41,990
structure starts being potentially can
be created and what you're doing is

4790
01:31:41,990 --> 01:31:42,000
be created and what you're doing is
 

4791
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,390
be created and what you're doing is
you're applying that rule to different

4792
01:31:44,390 --> 01:31:44,400
you're applying that rule to different
 

4793
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:47,350
you're applying that rule to different
parts like to anytime you match it

4794
01:31:47,350 --> 01:31:47,360
parts like to anytime you match it
 

4795
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:49,590
parts like to anytime you match it
within the hypergraph exactly and then

4796
01:31:49,590 --> 01:31:49,600
within the hypergraph exactly and then
 

4797
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:53,990
within the hypergraph exactly and then
one of the like incredibly beautiful and

4798
01:31:53,990 --> 01:31:54,000
one of the like incredibly beautiful and
 

4799
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,590
one of the like incredibly beautiful and
interesting things to think about is the

4800
01:31:56,590 --> 01:31:56,600
interesting things to think about is the
 

4801
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:59,270
interesting things to think about is the
order in which you apply that rule yes

4802
01:31:59,270 --> 01:31:59,280
order in which you apply that rule yes
 

4803
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:00,950
order in which you apply that rule yes
because that pattern appears all over

4804
01:32:00,950 --> 01:32:00,960
because that pattern appears all over
 

4805
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:03,550
because that pattern appears all over
the place right so this is a big

4806
01:32:03,550 --> 01:32:03,560
the place right so this is a big
 

4807
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:05,109
the place right so this is a big
complicated thing very hard to wrap

4808
01:32:05,109 --> 01:32:05,119
complicated thing very hard to wrap
 

4809
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:07,470
complicated thing very hard to wrap
one's brain around okay so so you you

4810
01:32:07,470 --> 01:32:07,480
one's brain around okay so so you you
 

4811
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:09,750
one's brain around okay so so you you
say the rule is every time you see this

4812
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:09,760
say the rule is every time you see this
 

4813
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:12,550
say the rule is every time you see this
little pattern transform it in this way

4814
01:32:12,550 --> 01:32:12,560
little pattern transform it in this way
 

4815
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:15,390
little pattern transform it in this way
but yet you know as you look around the

4816
01:32:15,390 --> 01:32:15,400
but yet you know as you look around the
 

4817
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:17,470
but yet you know as you look around the
space that represents the universe there

4818
01:32:17,470 --> 01:32:17,480
space that represents the universe there
 

4819
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:18,990
space that represents the universe there
may be zillions of places where that

4820
01:32:18,990 --> 01:32:19,000
may be zillions of places where that
 

4821
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,990
may be zillions of places where that
little pattern occurs yeah so so what

4822
01:32:21,990 --> 01:32:22,000
little pattern occurs yeah so so what
 

4823
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,709
little pattern occurs yeah so so what
what what it says is just do this apply

4824
01:32:24,709 --> 01:32:24,719
what what it says is just do this apply
 

4825
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:27,790
what what it says is just do this apply
this rule wherever you feel like and

4826
01:32:27,790 --> 01:32:27,800
this rule wherever you feel like and
 

4827
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:31,390
this rule wherever you feel like and
what what is extremely non-trivial is

4828
01:32:31,390 --> 01:32:31,400
what what is extremely non-trivial is
 

4829
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:33,350
what what is extremely non-trivial is
well okay so so this is happening sort

4830
01:32:33,350 --> 01:32:33,360
well okay so so this is happening sort
 

4831
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:35,189
well okay so so this is happening sort
of in in computer science terms sort of

4832
01:32:35,189 --> 01:32:35,199
of in in computer science terms sort of
 

4833
01:32:35,199 --> 01:32:36,550
of in in computer science terms sort of
asynchronously you're just doing it

4834
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:36,560
asynchronously you're just doing it
 

4835
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:39,070
asynchronously you're just doing it
wherever wherever you feel like doing it

4836
01:32:39,070 --> 01:32:39,080
wherever wherever you feel like doing it
 

4837
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:41,350
wherever wherever you feel like doing it
and the only constraint is that if

4838
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:41,360
and the only constraint is that if
 

4839
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:43,990
and the only constraint is that if
you're going to apply the rule somewhere

4840
01:32:43,990 --> 01:32:44,000
you're going to apply the rule somewhere
 

4841
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,229
you're going to apply the rule somewhere
the the things to which you apply the

4842
01:32:46,229 --> 01:32:46,239
the the things to which you apply the
 

4843
01:32:46,239 --> 01:32:48,590
the the things to which you apply the
rule the the little you know elements to

4844
01:32:48,590 --> 01:32:48,600
rule the the little you know elements to
 

4845
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:52,750
rule the the little you know elements to
which you apply the rule if they if they

4846
01:32:52,750 --> 01:32:52,760
which you apply the rule if they if they
 

4847
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:55,510
which you apply the rule if they if they
have to be okay well you can think of

4848
01:32:55,510 --> 01:32:55,520
have to be okay well you can think of
 

4849
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:56,830
have to be okay well you can think of
each application of the rule as being

4850
01:32:56,830 --> 01:32:56,840
each application of the rule as being
 

4851
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:58,550
each application of the rule as being
kind of an event that happens in the

4852
01:32:58,550 --> 01:32:58,560
kind of an event that happens in the
 

4853
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:02,390
kind of an event that happens in the
universe Y and these the input to an

4854
01:33:02,390 --> 01:33:02,400
universe Y and these the input to an
 

4855
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:05,510
universe Y and these the input to an
event has to be ready for the event to

4856
01:33:05,510 --> 01:33:05,520
event has to be ready for the event to
 

4857
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:08,310
event has to be ready for the event to
occur that is if one event occurred if

4858
01:33:08,310 --> 01:33:08,320
occur that is if one event occurred if
 

4859
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:10,229
occur that is if one event occurred if
one transformation occurred and It

4860
01:33:10,229 --> 01:33:10,239
one transformation occurred and It
 

4861
01:33:10,239 --> 01:33:13,430
one transformation occurred and It
produced a particular atom of space then

4862
01:33:13,430 --> 01:33:13,440
produced a particular atom of space then
 

4863
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:17,229
produced a particular atom of space then
that atom of space has to already exist

4864
01:33:17,229 --> 01:33:17,239
that atom of space has to already exist
 

4865
01:33:17,239 --> 01:33:20,270
that atom of space has to already exist
before another uh transformation that's

4866
01:33:20,270 --> 01:33:20,280
before another uh transformation that's
 

4867
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:22,149
before another uh transformation that's
going to apply to that atom of space can

4868
01:33:22,149 --> 01:33:22,159
going to apply to that atom of space can
 

4869
01:33:22,159 --> 01:33:25,149
going to apply to that atom of space can
occur so like the prerequisite for the

4870
01:33:25,149 --> 01:33:25,159
occur so like the prerequisite for the
 

4871
01:33:25,159 --> 01:33:27,870
occur so like the prerequisite for the
event that's exist that's right so it it

4872
01:33:27,870 --> 01:33:27,880
event that's exist that's right so it it
 

4873
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:31,430
event that's exist that's right so it it
that defines a kind of uh this sort of

4874
01:33:31,430 --> 01:33:31,440
that defines a kind of uh this sort of
 

4875
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:33,350
that defines a kind of uh this sort of
set of causal relationships between

4876
01:33:33,350 --> 01:33:33,360
set of causal relationships between
 

4877
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:35,709
set of causal relationships between
events it says this event Happ has to

4878
01:33:35,709 --> 01:33:35,719
events it says this event Happ has to
 

4879
01:33:35,719 --> 01:33:39,229
events it says this event Happ has to
have happened before this event but that

4880
01:33:39,229 --> 01:33:39,239
have happened before this event but that
 

4881
01:33:39,239 --> 01:33:41,470
have happened before this event but that
is um but that's that's not a very

4882
01:33:41,470 --> 01:33:41,480
is um but that's that's not a very
 

4883
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:44,229
is um but that's that's not a very
limiting constraint no it's not and

4884
01:33:44,229 --> 01:33:44,239
limiting constraint no it's not and
 

4885
01:33:44,239 --> 01:33:46,990
limiting constraint no it's not and
what's still you still get the zillion

4886
01:33:46,990 --> 01:33:47,000
what's still you still get the zillion
 

4887
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,790
what's still you still get the zillion
uh that's a technical term options

4888
01:33:49,790 --> 01:33:49,800
uh that's a technical term options
 

4889
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:52,229
uh that's a technical term options
that's correct but but okay so this is

4890
01:33:52,229 --> 01:33:52,239
that's correct but but okay so this is
 

4891
01:33:52,239 --> 01:33:53,790
that's correct but but okay so this is
where things get a little bit more

4892
01:33:53,790 --> 01:33:53,800
where things get a little bit more
 

4893
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:56,669
where things get a little bit more
elaborate but they're mindblowing so

4894
01:33:56,669 --> 01:33:56,679
elaborate but they're mindblowing so
 

4895
01:33:56,679 --> 01:33:58,430
elaborate but they're mindblowing so
right but so so what what what happens

4896
01:33:58,430 --> 01:33:58,440
right but so so what what what happens
 

4897
01:33:58,440 --> 01:34:01,109
right but so so what what what happens
is so the first thing you might say is

4898
01:34:01,109 --> 01:34:01,119
is so the first thing you might say is
 

4899
01:34:01,119 --> 01:34:03,669
is so the first thing you might say is
you know let's well okay so so this

4900
01:34:03,669 --> 01:34:03,679
you know let's well okay so so this
 

4901
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:05,390
you know let's well okay so so this
question about the freedom of which

4902
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:05,400
question about the freedom of which
 

4903
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:07,950
question about the freedom of which
which event you do when well let me let

4904
01:34:07,950 --> 01:34:07,960
which event you do when well let me let
 

4905
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:09,430
which event you do when well let me let
me sort of State an answer and then

4906
01:34:09,430 --> 01:34:09,440
me sort of State an answer and then
 

4907
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:12,550
me sort of State an answer and then
explain it okay the the um the validity

4908
01:34:12,550 --> 01:34:12,560
explain it okay the the um the validity
 

4909
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:15,430
explain it okay the the um the validity
of special relativity is a consequence

4910
01:34:15,430 --> 01:34:15,440
of special relativity is a consequence
 

4911
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:17,030
of special relativity is a consequence
of the fact that in some sense it

4912
01:34:17,030 --> 01:34:17,040
of the fact that in some sense it
 

4913
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:19,229
of the fact that in some sense it
doesn't matter in what order you do

4914
01:34:19,229 --> 01:34:19,239
doesn't matter in what order you do
 

4915
01:34:19,239 --> 01:34:21,510
doesn't matter in what order you do
these underlying things so long as they

4916
01:34:21,510 --> 01:34:21,520
these underlying things so long as they
 

4917
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:23,350
these underlying things so long as they
respect this kind of set of causal

4918
01:34:23,350 --> 01:34:23,360
respect this kind of set of causal
 

4919
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:24,350
respect this kind of set of causal
relationship

4920
01:34:24,350 --> 01:34:24,360
relationship
 

4921
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:28,790
relationship
ship so and that's that's uh in a the

4922
01:34:28,790 --> 01:34:28,800
ship so and that's that's uh in a the
 

4923
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:30,910
ship so and that's that's uh in a the
the part that's in a certain sense is a

4924
01:34:30,910 --> 01:34:30,920
the part that's in a certain sense is a
 

4925
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:33,109
the part that's in a certain sense is a
really important one but the fact that

4926
01:34:33,109 --> 01:34:33,119
really important one but the fact that
 

4927
01:34:33,119 --> 01:34:36,990
really important one but the fact that
it it sometimes doesn't matter that's a

4928
01:34:36,990 --> 01:34:37,000
it it sometimes doesn't matter that's a
 

4929
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,350
it it sometimes doesn't matter that's a
I don't know what that's another like

4930
01:34:38,350 --> 01:34:38,360
I don't know what that's another like
 

4931
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:40,070
I don't know what that's another like
beautiful thing okay so so there's this

4932
01:34:40,070 --> 01:34:40,080
beautiful thing okay so so there's this
 

4933
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:42,550
beautiful thing okay so so there's this
idea of what I call causal invariance

4934
01:34:42,550 --> 01:34:42,560
idea of what I call causal invariance
 

4935
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:44,950
idea of what I call causal invariance
causal invariance exactly that's so

4936
01:34:44,950 --> 01:34:44,960
causal invariance exactly that's so
 

4937
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:47,030
causal invariance exactly that's so
really really powerful powerful idea a

4938
01:34:47,030 --> 01:34:47,040
really really powerful powerful idea a
 

4939
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:49,109
really really powerful powerful idea a
powerful idea which has actually Arisen

4940
01:34:49,109 --> 01:34:49,119
powerful idea which has actually Arisen
 

4941
01:34:49,119 --> 01:34:50,910
powerful idea which has actually Arisen
in different forms many times in the

4942
01:34:50,910 --> 01:34:50,920
in different forms many times in the
 

4943
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:52,629
in different forms many times in the
history of mathematics mathematical

4944
01:34:52,629 --> 01:34:52,639
history of mathematics mathematical
 

4945
01:34:52,639 --> 01:34:55,270
history of mathematics mathematical
logic even computer science has many

4946
01:34:55,270 --> 01:34:55,280
logic even computer science has many
 

4947
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:57,669
logic even computer science has many
different names um I mean our particular

4948
01:34:57,669 --> 01:34:57,679
different names um I mean our particular
 

4949
01:34:57,679 --> 01:34:59,270
different names um I mean our particular
version of it is a little bit tighter

4950
01:34:59,270 --> 01:34:59,280
version of it is a little bit tighter
 

4951
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:00,870
version of it is a little bit tighter
than other versions but it's basically

4952
01:35:00,870 --> 01:35:00,880
than other versions but it's basically
 

4953
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:02,510
than other versions but it's basically
the same idea here's here's how to think

4954
01:35:02,510 --> 01:35:02,520
the same idea here's here's how to think
 

4955
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:05,669
the same idea here's here's how to think
about that idea so imagine that well

4956
01:35:05,669 --> 01:35:05,679
about that idea so imagine that well
 

4957
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:07,270
about that idea so imagine that well
let's talk about it in terms of math for

4958
01:35:07,270 --> 01:35:07,280
let's talk about it in terms of math for
 

4959
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:09,669
let's talk about it in terms of math for
a second let's say you're doing algebra

4960
01:35:09,669 --> 01:35:09,679
a second let's say you're doing algebra
 

4961
01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:12,470
a second let's say you're doing algebra
and you're told you know multiply out

4962
01:35:12,470 --> 01:35:12,480
and you're told you know multiply out
 

4963
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:14,669
and you're told you know multiply out
this series of polinomial that are that

4964
01:35:14,669 --> 01:35:14,679
this series of polinomial that are that
 

4965
01:35:14,679 --> 01:35:17,229
this series of polinomial that are that
are multiplied together okay you say

4966
01:35:17,229 --> 01:35:17,239
are multiplied together okay you say
 

4967
01:35:17,239 --> 01:35:19,350
are multiplied together okay you say
well which order should I do that in so

4968
01:35:19,350 --> 01:35:19,360
well which order should I do that in so
 

4969
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:20,870
well which order should I do that in so
well do I multiply the third one by the

4970
01:35:20,870 --> 01:35:20,880
well do I multiply the third one by the
 

4971
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:22,390
well do I multiply the third one by the
fourth one and then do it by the first

4972
01:35:22,390 --> 01:35:22,400
fourth one and then do it by the first
 

4973
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:23,990
fourth one and then do it by the first
one or do I do the fifth one by the

4974
01:35:23,990 --> 01:35:24,000
one or do I do the fifth one by the
 

4975
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,390
one or do I do the fifth one by the
sixth one and then do that well it turns

4976
01:35:26,390 --> 01:35:26,400
sixth one and then do that well it turns
 

4977
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:28,470
sixth one and then do that well it turns
out it doesn't matter you can you can

4978
01:35:28,470 --> 01:35:28,480
out it doesn't matter you can you can
 

4979
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:29,870
out it doesn't matter you can you can
multiply them out in any order you'll

4980
01:35:29,870 --> 01:35:29,880
multiply them out in any order you'll
 

4981
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:32,310
multiply them out in any order you'll
always get the same answer that's a

4982
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:32,320
always get the same answer that's a
 

4983
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:34,510
always get the same answer that's a
that's a a property if you think about

4984
01:35:34,510 --> 01:35:34,520
that's a a property if you think about
 

4985
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:36,390
that's a a property if you think about
kind of making a kind of network that

4986
01:35:36,390 --> 01:35:36,400
kind of making a kind of network that
 

4987
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:38,669
kind of making a kind of network that
represents in what order you do things

4988
01:35:38,669 --> 01:35:38,679
represents in what order you do things
 

4989
01:35:38,679 --> 01:35:40,830
represents in what order you do things
you'll get different orders for

4990
01:35:40,830 --> 01:35:40,840
you'll get different orders for
 

4991
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:42,709
you'll get different orders for
different ways of multiplying things out

4992
01:35:42,709 --> 01:35:42,719
different ways of multiplying things out
 

4993
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:44,950
different ways of multiplying things out
but you'll always get the same answer

4994
01:35:44,950 --> 01:35:44,960
but you'll always get the same answer
 

4995
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,149
but you'll always get the same answer
same thing if you let's say you're

4996
01:35:46,149 --> 01:35:46,159
same thing if you let's say you're
 

4997
01:35:46,159 --> 01:35:48,149
same thing if you let's say you're
sorting you've got a bunch of A's and

01:35:48,149 --> 01:35:48,159
sorting you've got a bunch of A's and
 

4999
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:50,270
sorting you've got a bunch of A's and
B's they're in random some random order

5000
01:35:50,270 --> 01:35:50,280

you know baa BBB AA whatever and you you

5002
01:35:53,669 --> 01:35:53,679
you know baa BBB AA whatever and you you
 

5003
01:35:53,679 --> 01:35:55,669
you know baa BBB AA whatever and you you
have a little rule that says every time

5004
01:35:55,669 --> 01:35:55,679
have a little rule that says every time
 

5005
01:35:55,679 --> 01:36:00,030
have a little rule that says every time
you see ba flip it around to AB okay

5006
01:36:00,030 --> 01:36:00,040
you see ba flip it around to AB okay
 

5007
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:01,430
you see ba flip it around to AB okay
eventually you apply that rule enough

5008
01:36:01,430 --> 01:36:01,440
eventually you apply that rule enough

01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:03,950
eventually you apply that rule enough

let's explain a little bit more exactly
what's a little a little more detailed

5116
01:38:03,350 --> 01:38:03,360
what's a little a little more detailed
 

5117
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:05,830
what's a little a little more detailed
like right well so so one thing that is

5118
01:38:05,830 --> 01:38:05,840
like right well so so one thing that is
 

5119
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:07,510
like right well so so one thing that is
sort of surprising in this in this

5120
01:38:07,510 --> 01:38:07,520
sort of surprising in this in this
 

5121
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:09,550
sort of surprising in this in this
theory is one of the sort of

5122
01:38:09,550 --> 01:38:09,560
theory is one of the sort of
 

5123
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:11,390
theory is one of the sort of
achievements of 20th century physics was

5124
01:38:11,390 --> 01:38:11,400
achievements of 20th century physics was
 

5125
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:13,910
achievements of 20th century physics was
kind of bringing space and time together

5126
01:38:13,910 --> 01:38:13,920
kind of bringing space and time together
 

5127
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:15,750
kind of bringing space and time together
that was you know special relativity

5128
01:38:15,750 --> 01:38:15,760
that was you know special relativity
 

5129
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:18,229
that was you know special relativity
people talk about SpaceTime this sort of

5130
01:38:18,229 --> 01:38:18,239
people talk about SpaceTime this sort of
 

5131
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:20,589
people talk about SpaceTime this sort of
unified thing where space and time kind

5132
01:38:20,589 --> 01:38:20,599
unified thing where space and time kind
 

5133
01:38:20,599 --> 01:38:22,589
unified thing where space and time kind
of are mixed and there's a nice

5134
01:38:22,589 --> 01:38:22,599
of are mixed and there's a nice
 

5135
01:38:22,599 --> 01:38:25,629
of are mixed and there's a nice
mathematical formula M um that uh in

5136
01:38:25,629 --> 01:38:25,639
mathematical formula M um that uh in
 

5137
01:38:25,639 --> 01:38:27,550
mathematical formula M um that uh in
which you know space and time sort of

5138
01:38:27,550 --> 01:38:27,560
which you know space and time sort of
 

5139
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:29,750
which you know space and time sort of
appear as part of the SpaceTime

5140
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:29,760
appear as part of the SpaceTime
 

5141
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:32,229
appear as part of the SpaceTime
Continuum the SpaceTime you know four

5142
01:38:32,229 --> 01:38:32,239
Continuum the SpaceTime you know four
 

5143
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:34,669
Continuum the SpaceTime you know four
vectors and things like this um you know

5144
01:38:34,669 --> 01:38:34,679
vectors and things like this um you know
 

5145
01:38:34,679 --> 01:38:36,709
vectors and things like this um you know
we talk about spe time as the fourth

5146
01:38:36,709 --> 01:38:36,719
we talk about spe time as the fourth
 

5147
01:38:36,719 --> 01:38:38,790
we talk about spe time as the fourth
dimension and all these kinds of things

5148
01:38:38,790 --> 01:38:38,800
dimension and all these kinds of things
 

5149
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,990
dimension and all these kinds of things
it's you know that and it seems like the

5150
01:38:40,990 --> 01:38:41,000
it's you know that and it seems like the
 

5151
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,030
it's you know that and it seems like the
theory of relativity sort of says space

5152
01:38:43,030 --> 01:38:43,040
theory of relativity sort of says space
 

5153
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:44,510
theory of relativity sort of says space
and time are fundamentally the same kind

5154
01:38:44,510 --> 01:38:44,520
and time are fundamentally the same kind
 

5155
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:47,070
and time are fundamentally the same kind
of thing so one of the things that took

5156
01:38:47,070 --> 01:38:47,080
of thing so one of the things that took
 

5157
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:50,030
of thing so one of the things that took
a while to understand in in this

5158
01:38:50,030 --> 01:38:50,040
a while to understand in in this
 

5159
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:54,189
a while to understand in in this
approach of mine is that uh in in in my

5160
01:38:54,189 --> 01:38:54,199
approach of mine is that uh in in in my
 

5161
01:38:54,199 --> 01:38:55,589
approach of mine is that uh in in in my
kind of approach space and time are

5162
01:38:55,589 --> 01:38:55,599
kind of approach space and time are
 

5163
01:38:55,599 --> 01:38:57,109
kind of approach space and time are
really not fundamentally the same kind

5164
01:38:57,109 --> 01:38:57,119
really not fundamentally the same kind
 

5165
01:38:57,119 --> 01:38:59,589
really not fundamentally the same kind
of thing space is the extension of this

5166
01:38:59,589 --> 01:38:59,599
of thing space is the extension of this
 

5167
01:38:59,599 --> 01:39:02,310
of thing space is the extension of this
hypergraph time is the kind of progress

5168
01:39:02,310 --> 01:39:02,320
hypergraph time is the kind of progress
 

5169
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:04,750
hypergraph time is the kind of progress
of this inexorable computation of these

5170
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:04,760
of this inexorable computation of these
 

5171
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:07,070
of this inexorable computation of these
rules getting applied to the hypergraph

5172
01:39:07,070 --> 01:39:07,080
rules getting applied to the hypergraph
 

5173
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:08,709
rules getting applied to the hypergraph
so it's they seem like very different

5174
01:39:08,709 --> 01:39:08,719
so it's they seem like very different
 

5175
01:39:08,719 --> 01:39:12,189
so it's they seem like very different
kinds of things and and so that at first

5176
01:39:12,189 --> 01:39:12,199
kinds of things and and so that at first
 

5177
01:39:12,199 --> 01:39:13,910
kinds of things and and so that at first
seems like how can that possibly be

5178
01:39:13,910 --> 01:39:13,920
seems like how can that possibly be
 

5179
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:16,030
seems like how can that possibly be
right how can that possibly be lorensen

5180
01:39:16,030 --> 01:39:16,040
right how can that possibly be lorensen
 

5181
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:18,310
right how can that possibly be lorensen
variant that's the term for things being

5182
01:39:18,310 --> 01:39:18,320
variant that's the term for things being
 

5183
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:20,229
variant that's the term for things being
you know following the the rules of

5184
01:39:20,229 --> 01:39:20,239
you know following the the rules of
 

5185
01:39:20,239 --> 01:39:23,750
you know following the the rules of
special artivity well it turns out that

5186
01:39:23,750 --> 01:39:23,760
special artivity well it turns out that
 

5187
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:25,310
special artivity well it turns out that
when you have causal

5188
01:39:25,310 --> 01:39:25,320
when you have causal
 

5189
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:28,990
when you have causal
invariance that and let's see we can

5190
01:39:28,990 --> 01:39:29,000
invariance that and let's see we can
 

5191
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,109
invariance that and let's see we can
it's worth it's worth explaining a

5192
01:39:30,109 --> 01:39:30,119
it's worth it's worth explaining a
 

5193
01:39:30,119 --> 01:39:31,430
it's worth it's worth explaining a
little bit how this works it's a little

5194
01:39:31,430 --> 01:39:31,440
little bit how this works it's a little
 

5195
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:33,310
little bit how this works it's a little
bit little bit elaborate but but the

5196
01:39:33,310 --> 01:39:33,320
bit little bit elaborate but but the
 

5197
01:39:33,320 --> 01:39:37,830
bit little bit elaborate but but the
basic point is that um uh the even

5198
01:39:37,830 --> 01:39:37,840
basic point is that um uh the even
 

5199
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:40,070
basic point is that um uh the even
though space and time sort of come from

5200
01:39:40,070 --> 01:39:40,080
though space and time sort of come from
 

5201
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:42,830
though space and time sort of come from
very different places it turns out that

5202
01:39:42,830 --> 01:39:42,840
very different places it turns out that
 

5203
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:45,470
very different places it turns out that
the rules of sort of space time that

5204
01:39:45,470 --> 01:39:45,480
the rules of sort of space time that
 

5205
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:48,550
the rules of sort of space time that
special relativity talks about um come

5206
01:39:48,550 --> 01:39:48,560
special relativity talks about um come
 

5207
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:51,830
special relativity talks about um come
out of this model when you're looking at

5208
01:39:51,830 --> 01:39:51,840
out of this model when you're looking at
 

5209
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:54,830
out of this model when you're looking at
large enough systems MH so so a way to

5210
01:39:54,830 --> 01:39:54,840
large enough systems MH so so a way to
 

5211
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:56,510
large enough systems MH so so a way to
think about this you know in terms of

5212
01:39:56,510 --> 01:39:56,520
think about this you know in terms of
 

5213
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:57,910
think about this you know in terms of
the when you're looking at large enough

01:39:57,910 --> 01:39:57,920
the when you're looking at large enough
 

5215
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:02,629
the when you're looking at large enough
systems um the U part of that story is

5216
01:40:02,629 --> 01:40:02,639
systems um the U part of that story is
 

5217
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:04,350
systems um the U part of that story is
when you look at some fluid Like Water

5218
01:40:04,350 --> 01:40:04,360
when you look at some fluid Like Water
 

5219
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:06,390
when you look at some fluid Like Water
for example there are equations that

5220
01:40:06,390 --> 01:40:06,400
for example there are equations that
 

5221
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:09,189
for example there are equations that
govern the flow of water um those

5222
01:40:09,189 --> 01:40:09,199
govern the flow of water um those
 

5223
01:40:09,199 --> 01:40:11,709
govern the flow of water um those
equations are things that apply on a

5224
01:40:11,709 --> 01:40:11,719
equations are things that apply on a
 

5225
01:40:11,719 --> 01:40:13,229
equations are things that apply on a
large scale if you look at the

5226
01:40:13,229 --> 01:40:13,239
large scale if you look at the
 

5227
01:40:13,239 --> 01:40:14,750
large scale if you look at the
individual molecules they don't know

5228
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:14,760
individual molecules they don't know
 

5229
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:16,910
individual molecules they don't know
anything about those equations it's just

5230
01:40:16,910 --> 01:40:16,920
anything about those equations it's just
 

5231
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:18,990
anything about those equations it's just
the the the sort of the large scale

5232
01:40:18,990 --> 01:40:19,000
the the the sort of the large scale
 

5233
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,430
the the the sort of the large scale
effect of those molecules turns out to

5234
01:40:21,430 --> 01:40:21,440
effect of those molecules turns out to
 

5235
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:23,430
effect of those molecules turns out to
follow those equations and it's the same

5236
01:40:23,430 --> 01:40:23,440
follow those equations and it's the same
 

5237
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:25,109
follow those equations and it's the same
kind of thing happening in our

5238
01:40:25,109 --> 01:40:25,119
kind of thing happening in our
 

5239
01:40:25,119 --> 01:40:27,589
kind of thing happening in our
models I know this might be a a small

5240
01:40:27,589 --> 01:40:27,599
models I know this might be a a small
 

5241
01:40:27,599 --> 01:40:29,470
models I know this might be a a small
point but it might be a very big one

5242
01:40:29,470 --> 01:40:29,480
point but it might be a very big one
 

5243
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:32,510
point but it might be a very big one
we've been talking about space and time

5244
01:40:32,510 --> 01:40:32,520
we've been talking about space and time
 

5245
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:35,109
we've been talking about space and time
at the lowest level of the model which

5246
01:40:35,109 --> 01:40:35,119
at the lowest level of the model which
 

5247
01:40:35,119 --> 01:40:37,629
at the lowest level of the model which
is space the hypergraph time is the

5248
01:40:37,629 --> 01:40:37,639
is space the hypergraph time is the
 

5249
01:40:37,639 --> 01:40:40,229
is space the hypergraph time is the
evolution of this hypergraph but there's

5250
01:40:40,229 --> 01:40:40,239
evolution of this hypergraph but there's
 

5251
01:40:40,239 --> 01:40:44,189
evolution of this hypergraph but there's
also SpaceTime that we think about in

5252
01:40:44,189 --> 01:40:44,199
also SpaceTime that we think about in
 

5253
01:40:44,199 --> 01:40:46,470
also SpaceTime that we think about in
general relativity for special

5254
01:40:46,470 --> 01:40:46,480
general relativity for special
 

5255
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:50,310
general relativity for special
relativity like what how does how do you

5256
01:40:50,310 --> 01:40:50,320
relativity like what how does how do you
 

5257
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:54,550
relativity like what how does how do you
go from the uh lowest source code of

5258
01:40:54,550 --> 01:40:54,560
go from the uh lowest source code of
 

5259
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:56,109
go from the uh lowest source code of
space and time we're talking about to

5260
01:40:56,109 --> 01:40:56,119
space and time we're talking about to
 

5261
01:40:56,119 --> 01:40:57,830
space and time we're talking about to
the more traditional terminology of

5262
01:40:57,830 --> 01:40:57,840
the more traditional terminology of
 

5263
01:40:57,840 --> 01:40:59,470
the more traditional terminology of
space and time right so so the the key

5264
01:40:59,470 --> 01:40:59,480
space and time right so so the the key
 

5265
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:00,950
space and time right so so the the key
thing is this thing we call the causal

5266
01:41:00,950 --> 01:41:00,960
thing is this thing we call the causal
 

5267
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:03,669
thing is this thing we call the causal
graph so the causal graph is the graph

5268
01:41:03,669 --> 01:41:03,679
graph so the causal graph is the graph
 

5269
01:41:03,679 --> 01:41:06,629
graph so the causal graph is the graph
of causal relationships between events

5270
01:41:06,629 --> 01:41:06,639
of causal relationships between events
 

5271
01:41:06,639 --> 01:41:08,350
of causal relationships between events
so every one of these little updating

5272
01:41:08,350 --> 01:41:08,360
so every one of these little updating
 

5273
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:09,629
so every one of these little updating
events every one of these little

5274
01:41:09,629 --> 01:41:09,639
events every one of these little
 

5275
01:41:09,639 --> 01:41:11,669
events every one of these little
transformations of the hypergraph

5276
01:41:11,669 --> 01:41:11,679
transformations of the hypergraph
 

5277
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:13,430
transformations of the hypergraph
happens somewhere in the hypergraph

5278
01:41:13,430 --> 01:41:13,440
happens somewhere in the hypergraph
 

5279
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:15,790
happens somewhere in the hypergraph
happens at some stage in the

5280
01:41:15,790 --> 01:41:15,800
happens at some stage in the
 

5281
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:19,470
happens at some stage in the
computation that's an event that event

5282
01:41:19,470 --> 01:41:19,480
computation that's an event that event
 

5283
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:21,629
computation that's an event that event
is has a causal relationship to other

5284
01:41:21,629 --> 01:41:21,639
is has a causal relationship to other
 

5285
01:41:21,639 --> 01:41:24,669
is has a causal relationship to other
events in the sense that if the if

5286
01:41:24,669 --> 01:41:24,679
events in the sense that if the if
 

5287
01:41:24,679 --> 01:41:27,510
events in the sense that if the if
another event needs as its input the

5288
01:41:27,510 --> 01:41:27,520
another event needs as its input the
 

5289
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:29,709
another event needs as its input the
output from the first event there will

5290
01:41:29,709 --> 01:41:29,719
output from the first event there will
 

5291
01:41:29,719 --> 01:41:32,390
output from the first event there will
be a causal relationship of the the the

5292
01:41:32,390 --> 01:41:32,400
be a causal relationship of the the the
 

5293
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:34,510
be a causal relationship of the the the
future event will depend on the past

5294
01:41:34,510 --> 01:41:34,520
future event will depend on the past
 

5295
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:36,870
future event will depend on the past
event so you can say it's it has a

5296
01:41:36,870 --> 01:41:36,880
event so you can say it's it has a
 

5297
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:38,550
event so you can say it's it has a
causal connection and so you can make

5298
01:41:38,550 --> 01:41:38,560
causal connection and so you can make
 

5299
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:41,030
causal connection and so you can make
this graph of causal relationships

5300
01:41:41,030 --> 01:41:41,040
this graph of causal relationships
 

5301
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:43,510
this graph of causal relationships
between events that graph of causal

5302
01:41:43,510 --> 01:41:43,520
between events that graph of causal
 

5303
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:46,070
between events that graph of causal
relationships causal invariance implies

5304
01:41:46,070 --> 01:41:46,080
relationships causal invariance implies
 

5305
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:48,149
relationships causal invariance implies
that that graph is unique it doesn't

5306
01:41:48,149 --> 01:41:48,159
that that graph is unique it doesn't
 

5307
01:41:48,159 --> 01:41:52,070
that that graph is unique it doesn't
matter even though you think oh I'm I'm

5308
01:41:52,070 --> 01:41:52,080
matter even though you think oh I'm I'm
 

5309
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:53,229
matter even though you think oh I'm I'm
you know let's say we were sorting a

5310
01:41:53,229 --> 01:41:53,239
you know let's say we were sorting a
 

5311
01:41:53,239 --> 01:41:55,629
you know let's say we were sorting a
string for example I did that particular

5312
01:41:55,629 --> 01:41:55,639
string for example I did that particular
 

5313
01:41:55,639 --> 01:41:57,950
string for example I did that particular
transposition of of characters at this

5314
01:41:57,950 --> 01:41:57,960
transposition of of characters at this
 

5315
01:41:57,960 --> 01:41:59,470
transposition of of characters at this
time and then I did that one then I did

5316
01:41:59,470 --> 01:41:59,480
time and then I did that one then I did
 

5317
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:01,189
time and then I did that one then I did
this one turns out if you look at the

5318
01:42:01,189 --> 01:42:01,199
this one turns out if you look at the
 

5319
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:03,830
this one turns out if you look at the
network of of connections between those

5320
01:42:03,830 --> 01:42:03,840
network of of connections between those
 

5321
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:06,669
network of of connections between those
updating events that network is the same

5322
01:42:06,669 --> 01:42:06,679
updating events that network is the same
 

5323
01:42:06,679 --> 01:42:10,189
updating events that network is the same
it's it's the if if you were to see the

5324
01:42:10,189 --> 01:42:10,199
it's it's the if if you were to see the
 

5325
01:42:10,199 --> 01:42:11,589
it's it's the if if you were to see the
the the structure so in other words if

5326
01:42:11,589 --> 01:42:11,599
the the structure so in other words if
 

5327
01:42:11,599 --> 01:42:13,589
the the structure so in other words if
you were to draw that that if you were

5328
01:42:13,589 --> 01:42:13,599
you were to draw that that if you were
 

5329
01:42:13,599 --> 01:42:15,470
you were to draw that that if you were
to put that Network on a picture of

5330
01:42:15,470 --> 01:42:15,480
to put that Network on a picture of
 

5331
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:17,270
to put that Network on a picture of
where you're doing all the updating the

5332
01:42:17,270 --> 01:42:17,280
where you're doing all the updating the
 

5333
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:19,510
where you're doing all the updating the
places where you put the the nodes of

5334
01:42:19,510 --> 01:42:19,520
places where you put the the nodes of
 

5335
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:21,310
places where you put the the nodes of
the network will be different but the

5336
01:42:21,310 --> 01:42:21,320
the network will be different but the
 

5337
01:42:21,320 --> 01:42:22,709
the network will be different but the
way the nodes are connected will always

5338
01:42:22,709 --> 01:42:22,719
way the nodes are connected will always
 

5339
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:26,229
way the nodes are connected will always
be the same so but the causal graph is a

5340
01:42:26,229 --> 01:42:26,239
be the same so but the causal graph is a
 

5341
01:42:26,239 --> 01:42:28,750
be the same so but the causal graph is a
is I don't want it's kind of an observ

5342
01:42:28,750 --> 01:42:28,760
is I don't want it's kind of an observ
 

5343
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:32,550
is I don't want it's kind of an observ
it's not uh enforced it's just emergent

5344
01:42:32,550 --> 01:42:32,560
it's not uh enforced it's just emergent
 

5345
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:34,149
it's not uh enforced it's just emergent
from set of events well it's a it's a

5346
01:42:34,149 --> 01:42:34,159
from set of events well it's a it's a
 

5347
01:42:34,159 --> 01:42:36,510
from set of events well it's a it's a
feature of of okay so what it is

5348
01:42:36,510 --> 01:42:36,520
feature of of okay so what it is
 

5349
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:38,310
feature of of okay so what it is
characteristic I guess of the way events

5350
01:42:38,310 --> 01:42:38,320
characteristic I guess of the way events
 

5351
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:40,750
characteristic I guess of the way events
happen right it's an event can't happen

5352
01:42:40,750 --> 01:42:40,760
happen right it's an event can't happen
 

5353
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:43,229
happen right it's an event can't happen
until its input is ready right and so

5354
01:42:43,229 --> 01:42:43,239
until its input is ready right and so
 

5355
01:42:43,239 --> 01:42:45,510
until its input is ready right and so
that creates this this network of causal

5356
01:42:45,510 --> 01:42:45,520
that creates this this network of causal
 

5357
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:47,149
that creates this this network of causal
relationships and that's that's the

5358
01:42:47,149 --> 01:42:47,159
relationships and that's that's the
 

5359
01:42:47,159 --> 01:42:49,950
relationships and that's that's the
causal graph and the thing the next

5360
01:42:49,950 --> 01:42:49,960
causal graph and the thing the next
 

5361
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:53,589
causal graph and the thing the next
thing to realize is okay we when you're

5362
01:42:53,589 --> 01:42:53,599
thing to realize is okay we when you're
 

5363
01:42:53,599 --> 01:42:55,430
thing to realize is okay we when you're
going to observe what happens in the

5364
01:42:55,430 --> 01:42:55,440
going to observe what happens in the
 

5365
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:57,950
going to observe what happens in the
universe you have to sort of make sense

5366
01:42:57,950 --> 01:42:57,960
universe you have to sort of make sense
 

5367
01:42:57,960 --> 01:43:01,270
universe you have to sort of make sense
of this causal graph so and you are an

5368
01:43:01,270 --> 01:43:01,280
of this causal graph so and you are an
 

5369
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:03,390
of this causal graph so and you are an
observer who yourself is part of this

5370
01:43:03,390 --> 01:43:03,400
observer who yourself is part of this
 

5371
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:06,510
observer who yourself is part of this
causal graph and so that means so let me

5372
01:43:06,510 --> 01:43:06,520
causal graph and so that means so let me
 

5373
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:08,310
causal graph and so that means so let me
give you an example of of how that works

5374
01:43:08,310 --> 01:43:08,320
give you an example of of how that works
 

5375
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:10,070
give you an example of of how that works
so so imagine we have a really weird

5376
01:43:10,070 --> 01:43:10,080
so so imagine we have a really weird
 

5377
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:12,350
so so imagine we have a really weird
Theory of physics of the world where it

5378
01:43:12,350 --> 01:43:12,360
Theory of physics of the world where it
 

5379
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:15,390
Theory of physics of the world where it
says this updating process there's only

5380
01:43:15,390 --> 01:43:15,400
says this updating process there's only
 

5381
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:16,870
says this updating process there's only
going to be one update at every moment

5382
01:43:16,870 --> 01:43:16,880
going to be one update at every moment
 

5383
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:18,990
going to be one update at every moment
in time and it's just going to be like a

5384
01:43:18,990 --> 01:43:19,000
in time and it's just going to be like a
 

5385
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,709
in time and it's just going to be like a
touring machine it has a little head

5386
01:43:20,709 --> 01:43:20,719
touring machine it has a little head
 

5387
01:43:20,719 --> 01:43:22,350
touring machine it has a little head
that runs around and just is always just

5388
01:43:22,350 --> 01:43:22,360
that runs around and just is always just
 

5389
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:24,550
that runs around and just is always just
updating one thing at a time so you say

5390
01:43:24,550 --> 01:43:24,560
updating one thing at a time so you say
 

5391
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:26,030
updating one thing at a time so you say
you know I have a theory of physics and

5392
01:43:26,030 --> 01:43:26,040
you know I have a theory of physics and
 

5393
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:27,830
you know I have a theory of physics and
The Theory of physics says there's just

5394
01:43:27,830 --> 01:43:27,840
The Theory of physics says there's just
 

5395
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:29,510
The Theory of physics says there's just
this one little place where things get

5396
01:43:29,510 --> 01:43:29,520
this one little place where things get
 

5397
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:31,870
this one little place where things get
updated you say that's completely crazy

5398
01:43:31,870 --> 01:43:31,880
updated you say that's completely crazy
 

5399
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:34,350
updated you say that's completely crazy
because you know it's plainly obvious

5400
01:43:34,350 --> 01:43:34,360
because you know it's plainly obvious
 

5401
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:36,390
because you know it's plainly obvious
that things are being updated sort of

5402
01:43:36,390 --> 01:43:36,400
that things are being updated sort of
 

5403
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:38,510
that things are being updated sort of
you know at the same syn yeah at the

5404
01:43:38,510 --> 01:43:38,520
you know at the same syn yeah at the
 

5405
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:41,430
you know at the same syn yeah at the
same time but but the fact is that the

5406
01:43:41,430 --> 01:43:41,440
same time but but the fact is that the
 

5407
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:44,030
same time but but the fact is that the
thing is that if I'm you know talking to

5408
01:43:44,030 --> 01:43:44,040
thing is that if I'm you know talking to
 

5409
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:45,750
thing is that if I'm you know talking to
you and you seem to be being updated as

5410
01:43:45,750 --> 01:43:45,760
you and you seem to be being updated as
 

5411
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:47,990
you and you seem to be being updated as
I'm being updated but but if there's

5412
01:43:47,990 --> 01:43:48,000
I'm being updated but but if there's
 

5413
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,350
I'm being updated but but if there's
just this one little head that's running

5414
01:43:49,350 --> 01:43:49,360
just this one little head that's running
 

5415
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:51,950
just this one little head that's running
around updating things I will not know

5416
01:43:51,950 --> 01:43:51,960
around updating things I will not know
 

5417
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:53,750
around updating things I will not know
whether you've been updated or not until

5418
01:43:53,750 --> 01:43:53,760
whether you've been updated or not until
 

5419
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:56,790
whether you've been updated or not until
I'm updated so in other words when you

5420
01:43:56,790 --> 01:43:56,800
I'm updated so in other words when you
 

5421
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:59,229
I'm updated so in other words when you
draw this causal graph of the causal

5422
01:43:59,229 --> 01:43:59,239
draw this causal graph of the causal
 

5423
01:43:59,239 --> 01:44:00,750
draw this causal graph of the causal
relationship between the updatings and

5424
01:44:00,750 --> 01:44:00,760
relationship between the updatings and
 

5425
01:44:00,760 --> 01:44:02,790
relationship between the updatings and
you and the updatings in me it'll still

5426
01:44:02,790 --> 01:44:02,800
you and the updatings in me it'll still
 

5427
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:05,149
you and the updatings in me it'll still
be the same causal graph whether even

5428
01:44:05,149 --> 01:44:05,159
be the same causal graph whether even
 

5429
01:44:05,159 --> 01:44:07,229
be the same causal graph whether even
though the underlying sort of story of

5430
01:44:07,229 --> 01:44:07,239
though the underlying sort of story of
 

5431
01:44:07,239 --> 01:44:09,629
though the underlying sort of story of
what happens is oh there's just this one

5432
01:44:09,629 --> 01:44:09,639
what happens is oh there's just this one
 

5433
01:44:09,639 --> 01:44:11,030
what happens is oh there's just this one
little thing and it goes and updates in

5434
01:44:11,030 --> 01:44:11,040
little thing and it goes and updates in
 

5435
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:14,189
little thing and it goes and updates in
different places in the universe so is

5436
01:44:14,189 --> 01:44:14,199
different places in the universe so is
 

5437
01:44:14,199 --> 01:44:17,030
different places in the universe so is
that is that clear or is that a

5438
01:44:17,030 --> 01:44:17,040
that is that clear or is that a
 

5439
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:19,350
that is that clear or is that a
hypothesis is that is that clear that

5440
01:44:19,350 --> 01:44:19,360
hypothesis is that is that clear that
 

5441
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:21,750
hypothesis is that is that clear that
there's a unique causal graph uh if

5442
01:44:21,750 --> 01:44:21,760
there's a unique causal graph uh if
 

5443
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:23,189
there's a unique causal graph uh if
there's causal invariance there's unique

5444
01:44:23,189 --> 01:44:23,199
there's causal invariance there's unique
 

5445
01:44:23,199 --> 01:44:26,189
there's causal invariance there's unique
coal growth that's so so it's okay to

5446
01:44:26,189 --> 01:44:26,199
coal growth that's so so it's okay to
 

5447
01:44:26,199 --> 01:44:28,270
coal growth that's so so it's okay to
think of what we're talking about as a

5448
01:44:28,270 --> 01:44:28,280
think of what we're talking about as a
 

5449
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:30,790
think of what we're talking about as a
hypergraph and the operations on it as a

5450
01:44:30,790 --> 01:44:30,800
hypergraph and the operations on it as a
 

5451
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:32,470
hypergraph and the operations on it as a
kind of touring machine with a single

5452
01:44:32,470 --> 01:44:32,480
kind of touring machine with a single
 

5453
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:34,750
kind of touring machine with a single
head like a single guy running around

5454
01:44:34,750 --> 01:44:34,760
head like a single guy running around
 

5455
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:38,109
head like a single guy running around
updating stuff um is that safe to

5456
01:44:38,109 --> 01:44:38,119
updating stuff um is that safe to
 

5457
01:44:38,119 --> 01:44:40,510
updating stuff um is that safe to
intuitively think of it this way um let

5458
01:44:40,510 --> 01:44:40,520
intuitively think of it this way um let
 

5459
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:42,030
intuitively think of it this way um let
me think about that for a second yes I

5460
01:44:42,030 --> 01:44:42,040
me think about that for a second yes I
 

5461
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:43,470
me think about that for a second yes I
think so I think that I think there's

5462
01:44:43,470 --> 01:44:43,480
think so I think that I think there's
 

5463
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:45,390
think so I think that I think there's
nothing it doesn't matter I mean you you

5464
01:44:45,390 --> 01:44:45,400
nothing it doesn't matter I mean you you
 

5465
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:48,149
nothing it doesn't matter I mean you you
can you can say okay there is one the

5466
01:44:48,149 --> 01:44:48,159
can you can say okay there is one the
 

5467
01:44:48,159 --> 01:44:51,070
can you can say okay there is one the
reason I'm pausing for a second is that

5468
01:44:51,070 --> 01:44:51,080
reason I'm pausing for a second is that
 

5469
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:54,270
reason I'm pausing for a second is that
um I'm wondering well well when you say

5470
01:44:54,270 --> 01:44:54,280
um I'm wondering well well when you say
 

5471
01:44:54,280 --> 01:44:57,149
um I'm wondering well well when you say
running around depends how far it jumps

5472
01:44:57,149 --> 01:44:57,159
running around depends how far it jumps
 

5473
01:44:57,159 --> 01:44:58,550
running around depends how far it jumps
every time it runs around yeah yeah

5474
01:44:58,550 --> 01:44:58,560
every time it runs around yeah yeah
 

5475
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:00,669
every time it runs around yeah yeah
that's right but I mean like one

5476
01:45:00,669 --> 01:45:00,679
that's right but I mean like one
 

5477
01:45:00,679 --> 01:45:03,030
that's right but I mean like one
operation at yeah you can think of it

5478
01:45:03,030 --> 01:45:03,040
operation at yeah you can think of it
 

5479
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:05,070
operation at yeah you can think of it
one operation it's easier for the human

5480
01:45:05,070 --> 01:45:05,080
one operation it's easier for the human
 

5481
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:07,229
one operation it's easier for the human
brain to think of it that way as opposed

5482
01:45:07,229 --> 01:45:07,239
brain to think of it that way as opposed
 

5483
01:45:07,239 --> 01:45:10,270
brain to think of it that way as opposed
to uh simultaneous it's not okay but the

5484
01:45:10,270 --> 01:45:10,280
to uh simultaneous it's not okay but the
 

5485
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:11,870
to uh simultaneous it's not okay but the
thing is that's not how we experience

5486
01:45:11,870 --> 01:45:11,880
thing is that's not how we experience
 

5487
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:14,830
thing is that's not how we experience
the world what we experience is we look

5488
01:45:14,830 --> 01:45:14,840
the world what we experience is we look
 

5489
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:17,910
the world what we experience is we look
around everything seems to be happening

5490
01:45:17,910 --> 01:45:17,920
around everything seems to be happening
 

5491
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:20,189
around everything seems to be happening
at successive moments in time everywhere

5492
01:45:20,189 --> 01:45:20,199
at successive moments in time everywhere
 

5493
01:45:20,199 --> 01:45:23,030
at successive moments in time everywhere
in space yes that is the um and that's

5494
01:45:23,030 --> 01:45:23,040
in space yes that is the um and that's
 

5495
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:24,950
in space yes that is the um and that's
partly a feature of our particular

5496
01:45:24,950 --> 01:45:24,960
partly a feature of our particular
 

5497
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:26,830
partly a feature of our particular
construction I mean that is the speed of

5498
01:45:26,830 --> 01:45:26,840
construction I mean that is the speed of
 

5499
01:45:26,840 --> 01:45:29,270
construction I mean that is the speed of
light is really fast compared to you

5500
01:45:29,270 --> 01:45:29,280
light is really fast compared to you
 

5501
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:31,149
light is really fast compared to you
know we look around you know I can see

5502
01:45:31,149 --> 01:45:31,159
know we look around you know I can see
 

5503
01:45:31,159 --> 01:45:33,870
know we look around you know I can see
maybe 100 feet away right now um you

5504
01:45:33,870 --> 01:45:33,880
maybe 100 feet away right now um you
 

5505
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:37,870
maybe 100 feet away right now um you
know it's uh the my brain does not

5506
01:45:37,870 --> 01:45:37,880
know it's uh the my brain does not
 

5507
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:39,790
know it's uh the my brain does not
process very much in the time it takes

01:45:39,790 --> 01:45:39,800
process very much in the time it takes

light to C 100 ft the brain operates at
 

5511
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:44,229
light to C 100 ft the brain operates at
a scale of hundreds of milliseconds or

a scale of hundreds of milliseconds or
 

5513
01:45:44,239 --> 01:45:46,390
a scale of hundreds of milliseconds or
something like that I don't know and and

01:45:46,390 --> 01:45:46,400
something like that I don't know and and
 

5515
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:48,189
something like that I don't know and and
speed of light is much faster right you

5516
01:45:48,189 --> 01:45:48,199
speed of light is much faster right you
 

5517
01:45:48,199 --> 01:45:49,990
speed of light is much faster right you
know light goes in a billionth of a

5518
01:45:49,990 --> 01:45:50,000
know light goes in a billionth of a
 

5519
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,550
know light goes in a billionth of a
second light has gone a foot so it goes

01:45:51,550 --> 01:45:51,560
second light has gone a foot so it goes
 

5521
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:53,790
second light has gone a foot so it goes
a billion feet every second

with uh I'm taking in photons from you

5538
01:46:14,790 --> 01:46:14,800
with uh I'm taking in photons from you
 

5539
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:16,750
with uh I'm taking in photons from you
right now but there's something much

5540
01:46:16,750 --> 01:46:16,760
right now but there's something much
 

5541
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:19,430
right now but there's something much
much deeper going on right here it it

5542
01:46:19,430 --> 01:46:19,440
much deeper going on right here it it
 

5543
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:21,910
much deeper going on right here it it
does have a it's paralyzing sometimes

5544

does have a it's paralyzing sometimes
 

5545
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:24,709
does have a it's paralyzing sometimes
just yes to remember that right no I

5546
01:46:24,709 --> 01:46:24,719
just yes to remember that right no I
 

5547
01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:27,990
just yes to remember that right no I
mean you know but so you know yes yes as

5548
01:46:27,990 --> 01:46:28,000
mean you know but so you know yes yes as
 

5549
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,790
mean you know but so you know yes yes as
a small little tangent I I just

5550
01:46:29,790 --> 01:46:29,800
a small little tangent I I just
 

5551
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:32,350
a small little tangent I I just
remembered that we're talking about I

5552
01:46:32,350 --> 01:46:32,360
remembered that we're talking about I
 

5553
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:36,149
remembered that we're talking about I
mean this the about the fabric of

5554
01:46:36,149 --> 01:46:36,159
mean this the about the fabric of
 

5555
01:46:36,159 --> 01:46:39,189
mean this the about the fabric of
reality right so we we've got this

5556
01:46:39,189 --> 01:46:39,199
reality right so we we've got this
 

5557
01:46:39,199 --> 01:46:40,990
reality right so we we've got this
causal graph that represents the sort of

01:46:40,990 --> 01:46:41,000
causal graph that represents the sort of
 

5559
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:42,310
causal graph that represents the sort of
causal relationships between all these

5560
01:46:42,310 --> 01:46:42,320
causal relationships between all these
 

5561
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:44,350
causal relationships between all these
events in the universe yeah that causal

5562
01:46:44,350 --> 01:46:44,360
events in the universe yeah that causal
 

5563
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:46,350
events in the universe yeah that causal
graph kind of is a representation of

5564
01:46:46,350 --> 01:46:46,360
graph kind of is a representation of
 

5565
01:46:46,360 --> 01:46:50,109
graph kind of is a representation of
space time but our experience of it

5566
01:46:50,109 --> 01:46:50,119
space time but our experience of it
 

5567
01:46:50,119 --> 01:46:52,990
space time but our experience of it
requires that we pick reference frames

5568
01:46:52,990 --> 01:46:53,000
requires that we pick reference frames
 

5569
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:54,790
requires that we pick reference frames
this is kind of a key idea Einstein had

5570
01:46:54,790 --> 01:46:54,800
this is kind of a key idea Einstein had
 

5571
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:57,669
this is kind of a key idea Einstein had
this idea that what that means is we

5572
01:46:57,669 --> 01:46:57,679
this idea that what that means is we
 

5573
01:46:57,679 --> 01:47:01,310
this idea that what that means is we
have to say what are we going to pick as

5574
01:47:01,310 --> 01:47:01,320
have to say what are we going to pick as
 

5575
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:04,790
have to say what are we going to pick as
being the uh sort of what we Define as

5576
01:47:04,790 --> 01:47:04,800
being the uh sort of what we Define as
 

5577
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:07,990
being the uh sort of what we Define as
simultaneous moments in time so for

5578
01:47:07,990 --> 01:47:08,000
simultaneous moments in time so for
 

5579
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:11,350
simultaneous moments in time so for
example we can say um you know we we set

5580
01:47:11,350 --> 01:47:11,360
example we can say um you know we we set
 

5581
01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:13,310
example we can say um you know we we set
how do we set our clocks you know if

5582
01:47:13,310 --> 01:47:13,320
how do we set our clocks you know if
 

5583
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:16,350
how do we set our clocks you know if
we've got a a spacecraft landing on Mars

5584
01:47:16,350 --> 01:47:16,360
we've got a a spacecraft landing on Mars
 

5585
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:18,109
we've got a a spacecraft landing on Mars
you know do we say that it you know what

5586
01:47:18,109 --> 01:47:18,119
you know do we say that it you know what
 

5587
01:47:18,119 --> 01:47:20,030
you know do we say that it you know what
what time is it landing at was it you

5588
01:47:20,030 --> 01:47:20,040
what time is it landing at was it you
 

5589
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:21,589
what time is it landing at was it you
know even though there's a 20 minute

5590
01:47:21,589 --> 01:47:21,599
know even though there's a 20 minute
 

5591
01:47:21,599 --> 01:47:23,430
know even though there's a 20 minute
speed of light delay or something thing

5592
01:47:23,430 --> 01:47:23,440
speed of light delay or something thing
 

5593
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:25,149
speed of light delay or something thing
you know what time do we say it landed

5594
01:47:25,149 --> 01:47:25,159
you know what time do we say it landed
 

5595
01:47:25,159 --> 01:47:27,510
you know what time do we say it landed
at how do we how do we set up sort of

5596
01:47:27,510 --> 01:47:27,520
at how do we how do we set up sort of
 

5597
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:30,149
at how do we how do we set up sort of
time coordinates for for the world and

5598
01:47:30,149 --> 01:47:30,159
time coordinates for for the world and
 

5599
01:47:30,159 --> 01:47:32,270
time coordinates for for the world and
that turns out to be that there's kind

5600
01:47:32,270 --> 01:47:32,280
that turns out to be that there's kind
 

5601
01:47:32,280 --> 01:47:34,430
that turns out to be that there's kind
of this arbitrariness to how we set

5602
01:47:34,430 --> 01:47:34,440
of this arbitrariness to how we set
 

5603
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:37,070
of this arbitrariness to how we set
these reference frames that Define sort

5604
01:47:37,070 --> 01:47:37,080
these reference frames that Define sort
 

5605
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:40,070
these reference frames that Define sort
of what cils simultaneous and what is

5606
01:47:40,070 --> 01:47:40,080
of what cils simultaneous and what is
 

5607
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:42,149
of what cils simultaneous and what is
the the essence of special relativity is

5608
01:47:42,149 --> 01:47:42,159
the the essence of special relativity is
 

5609
01:47:42,159 --> 01:47:44,430
the the essence of special relativity is
to think about reference frames going at

5610
01:47:44,430 --> 01:47:44,440
to think about reference frames going at
 

5611
01:47:44,440 --> 01:47:47,070
to think about reference frames going at
different speeds and to think about sort

5612
01:47:47,070 --> 01:47:47,080
different speeds and to think about sort
 

5613
01:47:47,080 --> 01:47:49,790
different speeds and to think about sort
of how they assign what counts as space

5614
01:47:49,790 --> 01:47:49,800
of how they assign what counts as space
 

5615
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:52,629
of how they assign what counts as space
what counts as time and so on um that's

5616
01:47:52,629 --> 01:47:52,639
what counts as time and so on um that's
 

5617
01:47:52,639 --> 01:47:54,430
what counts as time and so on um that's
all well a bit technical but the basic

5618
01:47:54,430 --> 01:47:54,440
all well a bit technical but the basic
 

5619
01:47:54,440 --> 01:47:57,470
all well a bit technical but the basic
bottom line is that the this causal

5620
01:47:57,470 --> 01:47:57,480
bottom line is that the this causal
 

5621
01:47:57,480 --> 01:48:00,030
bottom line is that the this causal
invariance property that means that it's

5622
01:48:00,030 --> 01:48:00,040
invariance property that means that it's
 

5623
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:02,229
invariance property that means that it's
always the same causal graph independent

5624
01:48:02,229 --> 01:48:02,239
always the same causal graph independent
 

5625
01:48:02,239 --> 01:48:03,870
always the same causal graph independent
of how you slice it with these reference

5626
01:48:03,870 --> 01:48:03,880
of how you slice it with these reference
 

5627
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:05,790
of how you slice it with these reference
frames you'll always sort of see the

5628
01:48:05,790 --> 01:48:05,800
frames you'll always sort of see the
 

5629
01:48:05,800 --> 01:48:08,270
frames you'll always sort of see the
same physical processes go on and that's

5630
01:48:08,270 --> 01:48:08,280
same physical processes go on and that's
 

5631
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:10,350
same physical processes go on and that's
basically why special relativity works

5632
01:48:10,350 --> 01:48:10,360
basically why special relativity works
 

5633
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:13,470
basically why special relativity works
so there's something like special

5634
01:48:13,470 --> 01:48:13,480
so there's something like special
 

5635
01:48:13,480 --> 01:48:16,390
so there's something like special
relativity uh like everything around

5636
01:48:16,390 --> 01:48:16,400
relativity uh like everything around
 

5637
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:20,790
relativity uh like everything around
space and time that uh that fits this

5638
01:48:20,790 --> 01:48:20,800
space and time that uh that fits this
 

5639
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:23,589
space and time that uh that fits this
idea of the causal graph right well you

5640
01:48:23,589 --> 01:48:23,599
idea of the causal graph right well you
 

5641
01:48:23,599 --> 01:48:25,109
idea of the causal graph right well you
know one way to think about it is given

5642
01:48:25,109 --> 01:48:25,119
know one way to think about it is given
 

5643
01:48:25,119 --> 01:48:27,430
know one way to think about it is given
that you have a a basic structure that

5644
01:48:27,430 --> 01:48:27,440
that you have a a basic structure that
 

5645
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:30,790
that you have a a basic structure that
just involves updating things in in

5646
01:48:30,790 --> 01:48:30,800
just involves updating things in in
 

5647
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:32,750
just involves updating things in in
these you know connected updates and

5648
01:48:32,750 --> 01:48:32,760
these you know connected updates and
 

5649
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:34,149
these you know connected updates and
looking at the causal relationships

5650
01:48:34,149 --> 01:48:34,159
looking at the causal relationships
 

5651
01:48:34,159 --> 01:48:37,149
looking at the causal relationships
between connected updates that's enough

5652
01:48:37,149 --> 01:48:37,159
between connected updates that's enough
 

5653
01:48:37,159 --> 01:48:39,030
between connected updates that's enough
when you unravel the consequences of

5654
01:48:39,030 --> 01:48:39,040
when you unravel the consequences of
 

5655
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:40,990
when you unravel the consequences of
that that together with the fact that

5656
01:48:40,990 --> 01:48:41,000
that that together with the fact that
 

5657
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:42,229
that that together with the fact that
there are lots of these things and that

5658
01:48:42,229 --> 01:48:42,239
there are lots of these things and that
 

5659
01:48:42,239 --> 01:48:44,870
there are lots of these things and that
you can take a Continuum limit and so on

5660
01:48:44,870 --> 01:48:44,880
you can take a Continuum limit and so on
 

5661
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:48,070
you can take a Continuum limit and so on
implies special RS of a day and um so

5662
01:48:48,070 --> 01:48:48,080
implies special RS of a day and um so
 

5663
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:50,990
implies special RS of a day and um so
that it's kind of a not a big deal

5664
01:48:50,990 --> 01:48:51,000
that it's kind of a not a big deal
 

5665
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,950
that it's kind of a not a big deal
because it's kind of it's kind of a you

5666
01:48:52,950 --> 01:48:52,960
because it's kind of it's kind of a you
 

5667
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:55,430
because it's kind of it's kind of a you
it was completely unobvious when you

5668
01:48:55,430 --> 01:48:55,440
it was completely unobvious when you
 

5669
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:57,390
it was completely unobvious when you
started off with saying we've got this

5670
01:48:57,390 --> 01:48:57,400
started off with saying we've got this
 

5671
01:48:57,400 --> 01:48:59,870
started off with saying we've got this
graph it's being updated in time etc etc

5672
01:48:59,870 --> 01:48:59,880
graph it's being updated in time etc etc
 

5673
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:01,790
graph it's being updated in time etc etc
etc that just looks like nothing to do

5674
01:49:01,790 --> 01:49:01,800
etc that just looks like nothing to do
 

5675
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:04,310
etc that just looks like nothing to do
with special arts every day and yet you

5676
01:49:04,310 --> 01:49:04,320
with special arts every day and yet you
 

5677
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:07,750
with special arts every day and yet you
get that and and what I mean then the

5678
01:49:07,750 --> 01:49:07,760
get that and and what I mean then the
 

5679
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:09,030
get that and and what I mean then the
thing I mean this was stuff that I

5680
01:49:09,030 --> 01:49:09,040
thing I mean this was stuff that I
 

5681
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:12,390
thing I mean this was stuff that I
figured out back in the 1990s the um the

5682
01:49:12,390 --> 01:49:12,400
figured out back in the 1990s the um the
 

5683
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:14,350
figured out back in the 1990s the um the
the next big thing you get is General

5684
01:49:14,350 --> 01:49:14,360
the next big thing you get is General
 

5685
01:49:14,360 --> 01:49:17,990
the next big thing you get is General
Arts of day um and so the in this

5686
01:49:17,990 --> 01:49:18,000
Arts of day um and so the in this
 

5687
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,189
Arts of day um and so the in this
hypergraph the this sort of limiting

5688
01:49:20,189 --> 01:49:20,199
hypergraph the this sort of limiting
 

5689
01:49:20,199 --> 01:49:21,390
hypergraph the this sort of limiting
structure when you have a very big

5690
01:49:21,390 --> 01:49:21,400
structure when you have a very big
 

5691
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:23,669
structure when you have a very big
hypergraph you can think of as being

5692
01:49:23,669 --> 01:49:23,679
hypergraph you can think of as being
 

5693
01:49:23,679 --> 01:49:25,149
hypergraph you can think of as being
just like you know water seems

5694
01:49:25,149 --> 01:49:25,159
just like you know water seems
 

5695
01:49:25,159 --> 01:49:27,350
just like you know water seems
continuous on a large scale so this

5696
01:49:27,350 --> 01:49:27,360
continuous on a large scale so this
 

5697
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:29,270
continuous on a large scale so this
hypergraph seems continuous on a large

5698
01:49:29,270 --> 01:49:29,280
hypergraph seems continuous on a large
 

5699
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:32,030
hypergraph seems continuous on a large
scale one question is you know how many

5700
01:49:32,030 --> 01:49:32,040
scale one question is you know how many
 

5701
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:34,189
scale one question is you know how many
dimensions of space does it correspond

5702
01:49:34,189 --> 01:49:34,199
dimensions of space does it correspond
 

5703
01:49:34,199 --> 01:49:36,629
dimensions of space does it correspond
to so one question you can ask is if you

5704
01:49:36,629 --> 01:49:36,639
to so one question you can ask is if you
 

5705
01:49:36,639 --> 01:49:38,189
to so one question you can ask is if you
just got a bunch of points and they're

5706
01:49:38,189 --> 01:49:38,199
just got a bunch of points and they're
 

5707
01:49:38,199 --> 01:49:41,189
just got a bunch of points and they're
connected together how do you deduce

5708
01:49:41,189 --> 01:49:41,199
connected together how do you deduce
 

5709
01:49:41,199 --> 01:49:43,470
connected together how do you deduce
what effective dimension of space that

5710
01:49:43,470 --> 01:49:43,480
what effective dimension of space that
 

5711
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:46,109
what effective dimension of space that
bundle of points corresponds to and

5712
01:49:46,109 --> 01:49:46,119
bundle of points corresponds to and
 

5713
01:49:46,119 --> 01:49:48,149
bundle of points corresponds to and
that's that's pretty easy to explain so

5714
01:49:48,149 --> 01:49:48,159
that's that's pretty easy to explain so
 

5715
01:49:48,159 --> 01:49:50,550
that's that's pretty easy to explain so
basically if you say you got a point and

5716
01:49:50,550 --> 01:49:50,560
basically if you say you got a point and
 

5717
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:52,149
basically if you say you got a point and
you look at how many neighbors does that

5718
01:49:52,149 --> 01:49:52,159
you look at how many neighbors does that
 

5719
01:49:52,159 --> 01:49:53,950
you look at how many neighbors does that
point have okay imagine it's on a square

5720
01:49:53,950 --> 01:49:53,960
point have okay imagine it's on a square
 

5721
01:49:53,960 --> 01:49:56,390
point have okay imagine it's on a square
grid then it'll have four neighbors go

5722
01:49:56,390 --> 01:49:56,400
grid then it'll have four neighbors go
 

5723
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:58,910
grid then it'll have four neighbors go
another level out how many neighbors do

5724
01:49:58,910 --> 01:49:58,920
another level out how many neighbors do
 

5725
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:01,350
another level out how many neighbors do
you get then what you realize is as you

5726
01:50:01,350 --> 01:50:01,360
you get then what you realize is as you
 

5727
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:03,470
you get then what you realize is as you
go more and more levels out as you go

5728
01:50:03,470 --> 01:50:03,480
go more and more levels out as you go
 

5729
01:50:03,480 --> 01:50:05,870
go more and more levels out as you go
more and more distance on the graph out

5730
01:50:05,870 --> 01:50:05,880
more and more distance on the graph out
 

5731
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:07,830
more and more distance on the graph out
you're you're capturing something which

5732
01:50:07,830 --> 01:50:07,840
you're you're capturing something which
 

5733
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:10,070
you're you're capturing something which
is essentially a circle in two

5734
01:50:10,070 --> 01:50:10,080
is essentially a circle in two
 

5735
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:12,070
is essentially a circle in two
Dimensions so that you know the the

5736
01:50:12,070 --> 01:50:12,080
Dimensions so that you know the the
 

5737
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:14,270
Dimensions so that you know the the
number of the area of a circle is p pi r

5738
01:50:14,270 --> 01:50:14,280
number of the area of a circle is p pi r
 

5739
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:17,229
number of the area of a circle is p pi r
squ so the it's the number of points

5740
01:50:17,229 --> 01:50:17,239
squ so the it's the number of points
 

5741
01:50:17,239 --> 01:50:19,430
squ so the it's the number of points
that you get to goes up like the

5742
01:50:19,430 --> 01:50:19,440
that you get to goes up like the
 

5743
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:21,950
that you get to goes up like the
distance you've gone squared and in

5744
01:50:21,950 --> 01:50:21,960
distance you've gone squared and in
 

5745
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:25,310
distance you've gone squared and in
general in D dimensional space it's R to

5746
01:50:25,310 --> 01:50:25,320
general in D dimensional space it's R to
 

5747
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:27,709
general in D dimensional space it's R to
the^ D it's the the number of points you

5748
01:50:27,709 --> 01:50:27,719
the^ D it's the the number of points you
 

5749
01:50:27,719 --> 01:50:31,470
the^ D it's the the number of points you
get to if you go R steps on the graph

5750
01:50:31,470 --> 01:50:31,480
get to if you go R steps on the graph
 

5751
01:50:31,480 --> 01:50:33,790
get to if you go R steps on the graph
grows like the number of steps you go to

5752
01:50:33,790 --> 01:50:33,800
grows like the number of steps you go to
 

5753
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:36,310
grows like the number of steps you go to
the power of the dimension and that's a

5754
01:50:36,310 --> 01:50:36,320
the power of the dimension and that's a
 

5755
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:37,830
the power of the dimension and that's a
that's a way that you can estimate the

5756
01:50:37,830 --> 01:50:37,840
that's a way that you can estimate the
 

5757
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:39,189
that's a way that you can estimate the
effective dimension of one of these

5758
01:50:39,189 --> 01:50:39,199
effective dimension of one of these
 

5759
01:50:39,199 --> 01:50:41,270
effective dimension of one of these
graphs so what does that grow to so how

5760
01:50:41,270 --> 01:50:41,280
graphs so what does that grow to so how
 

5761
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:43,629
graphs so what does that grow to so how
does the dimension grow because uh I

5762
01:50:43,629 --> 01:50:43,639
does the dimension grow because uh I
 

5763
01:50:43,639 --> 01:50:45,910
does the dimension grow because uh I
mean obviously the visual aspect of

5764
01:50:45,910 --> 01:50:45,920
mean obviously the visual aspect of
 

5765
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:47,830
mean obviously the visual aspect of
these hypergraphs they're often

5766
01:50:47,830 --> 01:50:47,840
these hypergraphs they're often
 

5767
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:50,470
these hypergraphs they're often
visualized in three dimensions right and

5768
01:50:50,470 --> 01:50:50,480
visualized in three dimensions right and
 

5769
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:54,470
visualized in three dimensions right and
then there's a certain kind of structure

5770
01:50:54,470 --> 01:50:54,480
then there's a certain kind of structure
 

5771
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:56,470
then there's a certain kind of structure
uh like you said there's the I mean a

5772
01:50:56,470 --> 01:50:56,480
uh like you said there's the I mean a
 

5773
01:50:56,480 --> 01:50:59,589
uh like you said there's the I mean a
circle a sphere uh there there's a

5774
01:50:59,589 --> 01:50:59,599
circle a sphere uh there there's a
 

5775
01:50:59,599 --> 01:51:01,350
circle a sphere uh there there's a
planer aspect to

5776
01:51:01,350 --> 01:51:01,360
planer aspect to
 

5777
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:05,109
planer aspect to
it to this graph to where it kind of it

5778
01:51:05,109 --> 01:51:05,119
it to this graph to where it kind of it
 

5779
01:51:05,119 --> 01:51:07,109
it to this graph to where it kind of it
almost starts creating a surface like a

5780
01:51:07,109 --> 01:51:07,119
almost starts creating a surface like a
 

5781
01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:09,830
almost starts creating a surface like a
complicated surface but a surface so how

5782
01:51:09,830 --> 01:51:09,840
complicated surface but a surface so how
 

5783
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:11,990
complicated surface but a surface so how
does that connect to affected Dimension

5784
01:51:11,990 --> 01:51:12,000
does that connect to affected Dimension
 

5785
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,550
does that connect to affected Dimension
okay so if you can lay out the graph in

5786
01:51:14,550 --> 01:51:14,560
okay so if you can lay out the graph in
 

5787
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:16,790
okay so if you can lay out the graph in
such a way that the that the points in

5788
01:51:16,790 --> 01:51:16,800
such a way that the that the points in
 

5789
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:19,629
such a way that the that the points in
the graph that uh you know the the

5790
01:51:19,629 --> 01:51:19,639
the graph that uh you know the the
 

5791
01:51:19,639 --> 01:51:21,270
the graph that uh you know the the
points that are neighbors on the graph

5792
01:51:21,270 --> 01:51:21,280
points that are neighbors on the graph
 

5793
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:23,430
points that are neighbors on the graph
are neighbors as you lay them out out MH

5794
01:51:23,430 --> 01:51:23,440
are neighbors as you lay them out out MH
 

5795
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:25,669
are neighbors as you lay them out out MH
and you can do that in two dimensions

5796
01:51:25,669 --> 01:51:25,679
and you can do that in two dimensions
 

5797
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:27,069
and you can do that in two dimensions
then it's going to approximate a two-

5798
01:51:27,069 --> 01:51:27,079
then it's going to approximate a two-
 

5799
01:51:27,079 --> 01:51:28,990
then it's going to approximate a two-
dimensional thing if you can't do that

5800
01:51:28,990 --> 01:51:29,000
dimensional thing if you can't do that
 

5801
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,149
dimensional thing if you can't do that
in two Dimensions if everything would

5802
01:51:30,149 --> 01:51:30,159
in two Dimensions if everything would
 

5803
01:51:30,159 --> 01:51:31,390
in two Dimensions if everything would
have to fold over a lot in two

5804
01:51:31,390 --> 01:51:31,400
have to fold over a lot in two
 

5805
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:32,629
have to fold over a lot in two
dimensions then it's not an

5806
01:51:32,629 --> 01:51:32,639
dimensions then it's not an
 

5807
01:51:32,639 --> 01:51:33,990
dimensions then it's not an
approximating a two- dimensional thing

5808
01:51:33,990 --> 01:51:34,000
approximating a two- dimensional thing
 

5809
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,149
approximating a two- dimensional thing
maybe you can lay it out in three

5810
01:51:35,149 --> 01:51:35,159
maybe you can lay it out in three
 

5811
01:51:35,159 --> 01:51:37,069
maybe you can lay it out in three
dimensions maybe you have to lay it out

5812
01:51:37,069 --> 01:51:37,079
dimensions maybe you have to lay it out
 

5813
01:51:37,079 --> 01:51:39,270
dimensions maybe you have to lay it out
in five Dimensions to have it be the

5814
01:51:39,270 --> 01:51:39,280
in five Dimensions to have it be the
 

5815
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:41,149
in five Dimensions to have it be the
case that it sort of smoothly lays out

5816
01:51:41,149 --> 01:51:41,159
case that it sort of smoothly lays out
 

5817
01:51:41,159 --> 01:51:44,189
case that it sort of smoothly lays out
like that well but okay so uh and I

5818
01:51:44,189 --> 01:51:44,199
like that well but okay so uh and I
 

5819
01:51:44,199 --> 01:51:45,589
like that well but okay so uh and I
apologize for the different tangent

5820
01:51:45,589 --> 01:51:45,599
apologize for the different tangent
 

5821
01:51:45,599 --> 01:51:47,430
apologize for the different tangent
questions but you know there's an

5822
01:51:47,430 --> 01:51:47,440
questions but you know there's an
 

5823
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:50,390
questions but you know there's an
Infinity number of possible

5824
01:51:50,390 --> 01:51:50,400
Infinity number of possible
 

5825
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:53,750
Infinity number of possible
rules so we have to look for

5826
01:51:53,750 --> 01:51:53,760
rules so we have to look for
 

5827
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:55,950
rules so we have to look for
rules that

5828
01:51:55,950 --> 01:51:55,960
rules that
 

5829
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:58,510
rules that
uh that create the kind of structures

5830
01:51:58,510 --> 01:51:58,520
uh that create the kind of structures
 

5831
01:51:58,520 --> 01:52:01,990
uh that create the kind of structures
that that're reminiscent for uh that

5832
01:52:01,990 --> 01:52:02,000
that that're reminiscent for uh that
 

5833
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,750
that that're reminiscent for uh that
have Echoes of the different physics

5834
01:52:03,750 --> 01:52:03,760
have Echoes of the different physics
 

5835
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:06,550
have Echoes of the different physics
theories in them so what kind of rules

5836
01:52:06,550 --> 01:52:06,560
theories in them so what kind of rules
 

5837
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:08,149
theories in them so what kind of rules
is there something simple to be said

5838
01:52:08,149 --> 01:52:08,159
is there something simple to be said
 

5839
01:52:08,159 --> 01:52:10,950
is there something simple to be said
about the kind of rules that you have

5840
01:52:10,950 --> 01:52:10,960
about the kind of rules that you have
 

5841
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:13,149
about the kind of rules that you have
found beautiful that you have found

5842
01:52:13,149 --> 01:52:13,159
found beautiful that you have found
 

5843
01:52:13,159 --> 01:52:15,189
found beautiful that you have found
powerful right so so I mean what you

5844
01:52:15,189 --> 01:52:15,199
powerful right so so I mean what you
 

5845
01:52:15,199 --> 01:52:16,270
powerful right so so I mean what you
know one of the features of

5846
01:52:16,270 --> 01:52:16,280
know one of the features of
 

5847
01:52:16,280 --> 01:52:19,069
know one of the features of
computational ir reducibility is it's

5848
01:52:19,069 --> 01:52:19,079
computational ir reducibility is it's
 

5849
01:52:19,079 --> 01:52:22,149
computational ir reducibility is it's
very you you can't say in advance what's

5850
01:52:22,149 --> 01:52:22,159
very you you can't say in advance what's
 

5851
01:52:22,159 --> 01:52:23,550
very you you can't say in advance what's
going to happen happen with any

5852
01:52:23,550 --> 01:52:23,560
going to happen happen with any
 

5853
01:52:23,560 --> 01:52:25,109
going to happen happen with any
particular you can't say I'm going to

5854
01:52:25,109 --> 01:52:25,119
particular you can't say I'm going to
 

5855
01:52:25,119 --> 01:52:27,589
particular you can't say I'm going to
pick these rules from this part of rule

5856
01:52:27,589 --> 01:52:27,599
pick these rules from this part of rule
 

5857
01:52:27,599 --> 01:52:29,229
pick these rules from this part of rule
space so to speak because they're going

that's you can make some statements

5862
01:52:32,589 --> 01:52:32,599
that's you can make some statements
 

5863
01:52:32,599 --> 01:52:33,750
that's you can make some statements
along those lines but you can't

5864
01:52:33,750 --> 01:52:33,760
along those lines but you can't
 

5865
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:36,030
along those lines but you can't
generally say that now you know the

5866
01:52:36,030 --> 01:52:36,040
generally say that now you know the
 

5867
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:38,709
generally say that now you know the
state of what we've been able to do is

state of what we've been able to do is
 

5869
01:52:38,719 --> 01:52:40,229
state of what we've been able to do is
you know different properties of the

01:52:40,229 --> 01:52:40,239
you know different properties of the
 

5871
01:52:40,239 --> 01:52:41,750
you know different properties of the
universe like

01:52:41,750 --> 01:52:41,760
universe like
 

5873
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:43,550
universe like
dimensionality you know integer

like that at this point what we've got

5880
01:52:50,390 --> 01:52:50,400
like that at this point what we've got
 

5881
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:54,589
like that at this point what we've got
is we've got rules that that uh any one

is we've got rules that that uh any one
of those features we can get a rule that

01:52:56,430 --> 01:52:56,440
of those features we can get a rule that
 

5885
01:52:56,440 --> 01:52:59,189
of those features we can get a rule that
has that feature yeah so we don't have

5886
01:52:59,189 --> 01:52:59,199
has that feature yeah so we don't have
 

5887
01:52:59,199 --> 01:53:01,350
has that feature yeah so we don't have
the the sort of the final here's a rule

5888
01:53:01,350 --> 01:53:01,360
the the sort of the final here's a rule
 

5889
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:02,830
the the sort of the final here's a rule
which has all of these features we do

5890
01:53:02,830 --> 01:53:02,840
which has all of these features we do
 

5891
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:05,149
which has all of these features we do
not have that yet so so if I were to try

5892
01:53:05,149 --> 01:53:05,159
not have that yet so so if I were to try
 

5893
01:53:05,159 --> 01:53:08,030
not have that yet so so if I were to try
to summarize the wolf from physics

5894
01:53:08,030 --> 01:53:08,040
to summarize the wolf from physics
 

5895
01:53:08,040 --> 01:53:09,270
to summarize the wolf from physics
project

5896
01:53:09,270 --> 01:53:09,280
project
 

5897
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:11,870
project
which is uh you know something that's

5898
01:53:11,870 --> 01:53:11,880
which is uh you know something that's
 

5899
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:14,069
which is uh you know something that's
been in your brain for a long time but

5900
01:53:14,069 --> 01:53:14,079
been in your brain for a long time but
 

5901
01:53:14,079 --> 01:53:17,350
been in your brain for a long time but
really has just exploded in activity you

5902
01:53:17,350 --> 01:53:17,360
really has just exploded in activity you
 

5903
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:20,629
really has just exploded in activity you
know only just months ago yes uh so it's

5904
01:53:20,629 --> 01:53:20,639
know only just months ago yes uh so it's
 

5905
01:53:20,639 --> 01:53:23,750
know only just months ago yes uh so it's
an evolving thing and next week I'll try

5906
01:53:23,750 --> 01:53:23,760
an evolving thing and next week I'll try
 

5907
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:25,510
an evolving thing and next week I'll try
to publish this conversation as quickly

5908
01:53:25,510 --> 01:53:25,520
to publish this conversation as quickly
 

5909
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:27,430
to publish this conversation as quickly
as possible because by the time it's

5910
01:53:27,430 --> 01:53:27,440
as possible because by the time it's
 

5911
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:28,629
as possible because by the time it's
published already new things will

5912
01:53:28,629 --> 01:53:28,639
published already new things will
 

5913
01:53:28,639 --> 01:53:31,870
published already new things will
probably have come out so uh so if I

5914
01:53:31,870 --> 01:53:31,880
probably have come out so uh so if I
 

5915
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:34,229
probably have come out so uh so if I
were to summarize it we've talked about

5916
01:53:34,229 --> 01:53:34,239
were to summarize it we've talked about
 

5917
01:53:34,239 --> 01:53:36,990
were to summarize it we've talked about
the basics of there's a hypergraph that

5918
01:53:36,990 --> 01:53:37,000
the basics of there's a hypergraph that
 

5919
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:40,629
the basics of there's a hypergraph that
represents space there is uh

5920
01:53:40,629 --> 01:53:40,639
represents space there is uh
 

5921
01:53:40,639 --> 01:53:42,589
represents space there is uh
Transformations and that hypergraph that

5922
01:53:42,589 --> 01:53:42,599
Transformations and that hypergraph that
 

5923
01:53:42,599 --> 01:53:45,430
Transformations and that hypergraph that
represents um time progress of time the

5924
01:53:45,430 --> 01:53:45,440
represents um time progress of time the
 

5925
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:47,830
represents um time progress of time the
progress of time there's a cause a graph

5926
01:53:47,830 --> 01:53:47,840
progress of time there's a cause a graph
 

5927
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:51,270
progress of time there's a cause a graph
that's a characteristic of this and the

5928
01:53:51,270 --> 01:53:51,280
that's a characteristic of this and the
 

5929
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:55,310
that's a characteristic of this and the
basic process of science of yeah of

5930
01:53:55,310 --> 01:53:55,320
basic process of science of yeah of
 

5931
01:53:55,320 --> 01:53:57,669
basic process of science of yeah of
science within the wol from physics

5932
01:53:57,669 --> 01:53:57,679
science within the wol from physics
 

5933
01:53:57,679 --> 01:54:01,069
science within the wol from physics
model is to try different rules and see

5934
01:54:01,069 --> 01:54:01,079
model is to try different rules and see
 

5935
01:54:01,079 --> 01:54:03,830
model is to try different rules and see
which properties of physics that we know

5936
01:54:03,830 --> 01:54:03,840
which properties of physics that we know
 

5937
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:07,790
which properties of physics that we know
of known physical theories are appear

5938
01:54:07,790 --> 01:54:07,800
of known physical theories are appear
 

5939
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:09,870
of known physical theories are appear
within the graphs that emerg from that

5940
01:54:09,870 --> 01:54:09,880
within the graphs that emerg from that
 

5941
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:11,790
within the graphs that emerg from that
rule that's what I thought it was going

5942
01:54:11,790 --> 01:54:11,800
rule that's what I thought it was going
 

5943
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:14,589
rule that's what I thought it was going
to be uh oh okay so

5944
01:54:14,589 --> 01:54:14,599
to be uh oh okay so
 

5945
01:54:14,599 --> 01:54:16,870
to be uh oh okay so
what so what is it turns out we can do a

5946
01:54:16,870 --> 01:54:16,880
what so what is it turns out we can do a
 

5947
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:19,109
what so what is it turns out we can do a
lot better than that it turns out that

5948
01:54:19,109 --> 01:54:19,119
lot better than that it turns out that
 

5949
01:54:19,119 --> 01:54:22,510
lot better than that it turns out that
using kind of mathematical ideas we can

5950
01:54:22,510 --> 01:54:22,520
using kind of mathematical ideas we can
 

5951
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:26,149
using kind of mathematical ideas we can
say and computational ideas we can we

5952
01:54:26,149 --> 01:54:26,159
say and computational ideas we can we
 

5953
01:54:26,159 --> 01:54:28,709
say and computational ideas we can we
can make General statements and those

5954
01:54:28,709 --> 01:54:28,719
can make General statements and those
 

5955
01:54:28,719 --> 01:54:30,870
can make General statements and those
General statements turn out to

5956
01:54:30,870 --> 01:54:30,880
General statements turn out to
 

5957
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:32,430
General statements turn out to
correspond to things that we know from

5958
01:54:32,430 --> 01:54:32,440
correspond to things that we know from
 

5959
01:54:32,440 --> 01:54:35,069
correspond to things that we know from
20th century physics in other words the

5960
01:54:35,069 --> 01:54:35,079
20th century physics in other words the
 

5961
01:54:35,079 --> 01:54:36,830
20th century physics in other words the
idea of you just try a bunch of rules

5962
01:54:36,830 --> 01:54:36,840
idea of you just try a bunch of rules
 

5963
01:54:36,840 --> 01:54:38,069
idea of you just try a bunch of rules
and see what they do that's what I

5964
01:54:38,069 --> 01:54:38,079
and see what they do that's what I
 

5965
01:54:38,079 --> 01:54:40,229
and see what they do that's what I
thought we were going to have to do um

5966
01:54:40,229 --> 01:54:40,239
thought we were going to have to do um
 

5967
01:54:40,239 --> 01:54:42,950
thought we were going to have to do um
but in in fact we can say given causal

5968
01:54:42,950 --> 01:54:42,960
but in in fact we can say given causal
 

5969
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:44,750
but in in fact we can say given causal
invariance and computational

5970
01:54:44,750 --> 01:54:44,760
invariance and computational
 

5971
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:47,870
invariance and computational
irreducibility we can derive and this is

5972
01:54:47,870 --> 01:54:47,880
irreducibility we can derive and this is
 

5973
01:54:47,880 --> 01:54:49,390
irreducibility we can derive and this is
where it gets really pretty interesting

5974
01:54:49,390 --> 01:54:49,400
where it gets really pretty interesting
 

5975
01:54:49,400 --> 01:54:51,270
where it gets really pretty interesting
we can derive special relativity we can

5976
01:54:51,270 --> 01:54:51,280
we can derive special relativity we can
 

5977
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:52,830
we can derive special relativity we can
derive general relativity

5978
01:54:52,830 --> 01:54:52,840
derive general relativity
 

5979
01:54:52,840 --> 01:54:55,830
derive general relativity
we can derive quantum mechanics and

5980
01:54:55,830 --> 01:54:55,840
we can derive quantum mechanics and
 

5981
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:57,390
we can derive quantum mechanics and
that's where things really start to get

5982
01:54:57,390 --> 01:54:57,400
that's where things really start to get
 

5983
01:54:57,400 --> 01:55:00,030
that's where things really start to get
exciting is you know it wasn't at all

5984
01:55:00,030 --> 01:55:00,040
exciting is you know it wasn't at all
 

5985
01:55:00,040 --> 01:55:02,189
exciting is you know it wasn't at all
obvious to me that even if we were

5986
01:55:02,189 --> 01:55:02,199
obvious to me that even if we were
 

5987
01:55:02,199 --> 01:55:04,069
obvious to me that even if we were
completely correct and even if we had

5988
01:55:04,069 --> 01:55:04,079
completely correct and even if we had
 

5989
01:55:04,079 --> 01:55:05,550
completely correct and even if we had
you know this is the rule you know even

5990
01:55:05,550 --> 01:55:05,560
you know this is the rule you know even
 

5991
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:07,990
you know this is the rule you know even
if we found the rule to be able to say

5992
01:55:07,990 --> 01:55:08,000
if we found the rule to be able to say
 

5993
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:09,550
if we found the rule to be able to say
yes it corresponds to things we already

5994
01:55:09,550 --> 01:55:09,560
yes it corresponds to things we already
 

5995
01:55:09,560 --> 01:55:11,790
yes it corresponds to things we already
know I did not expect that to be the

5996
01:55:11,790 --> 01:55:11,800
know I did not expect that to be the
 

5997
01:55:11,800 --> 01:55:15,910
know I did not expect that to be the
case and so for somebody who is uh

5998
01:55:15,910 --> 01:55:15,920
case and so for somebody who is uh
 

5999
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:17,790
case and so for somebody who is uh
simple mind and definitely not a

6000
01:55:17,790 --> 01:55:17,800
simple mind and definitely not a
 

6001
01:55:17,800 --> 01:55:19,910
simple mind and definitely not a
physicist not even close what does

6002
01:55:19,910 --> 01:55:19,920
physicist not even close what does
 

6003
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:22,990
physicist not even close what does
derivation mean in this case

6004
01:55:22,990 --> 01:55:23,000
derivation mean in this case
 

6005
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:26,189
derivation mean in this case
okay so so let me this is interesting

6006
01:55:26,189 --> 01:55:26,199
okay so so let me this is interesting
 

6007
01:55:26,199 --> 01:55:28,589
okay so so let me this is interesting
question okay so there's so one one

6008
01:55:28,589 --> 01:55:28,599
question okay so there's so one one
 

6009
01:55:28,599 --> 01:55:30,950
question okay so there's so one one
thing in the context of computational

6010
01:55:30,950 --> 01:55:30,960
thing in the context of computational
 

6011
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:33,189
thing in the context of computational
reducibility yeah yeah right right so

6012
01:55:33,189 --> 01:55:33,199
reducibility yeah yeah right right so
 

6013
01:55:33,199 --> 01:55:35,430
reducibility yeah yeah right right so
what you have to do let me give let me

6014
01:55:35,430 --> 01:55:35,440
what you have to do let me give let me
 

6015
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:37,910
what you have to do let me give let me
go back to again the mundane example of

6016
01:55:37,910 --> 01:55:37,920
go back to again the mundane example of
 

6017
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:39,790
go back to again the mundane example of
fluids and water and things like that

6018
01:55:39,790 --> 01:55:39,800
fluids and water and things like that
 

6019
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:42,229
fluids and water and things like that
right so so you have a bunch of

6020
01:55:42,229 --> 01:55:42,239
right so so you have a bunch of
 

6021
01:55:42,239 --> 01:55:45,950
right so so you have a bunch of
molecules bouncing around you can say uh

6022
01:55:45,950 --> 01:55:45,960
molecules bouncing around you can say uh
 

6023
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:47,629
molecules bouncing around you can say uh
just as a piece of mathematics I happen

6024
01:55:47,629 --> 01:55:47,639
just as a piece of mathematics I happen
 

6025
01:55:47,639 --> 01:55:49,430
just as a piece of mathematics I happen
to do this from cellular autometer back

6026
01:55:49,430 --> 01:55:49,440
to do this from cellular autometer back
 

6027
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:52,669
to do this from cellular autometer back
in the mid 1980s you can say just as a

6028
01:55:52,669 --> 01:55:52,679
in the mid 1980s you can say just as a
 

6029
01:55:52,679 --> 01:55:55,709
in the mid 1980s you can say just as a
matter of mathematics you can say the

6030
01:55:55,709 --> 01:55:55,719
matter of mathematics you can say the
 

6031
01:55:55,719 --> 01:55:57,950
matter of mathematics you can say the
Continuum limit of these little

6032
01:55:57,950 --> 01:55:57,960
Continuum limit of these little
 

6033
01:55:57,960 --> 01:55:59,950
Continuum limit of these little
molecules bouncing around is the Navia

6034
01:55:59,950 --> 01:55:59,960
molecules bouncing around is the Navia
 

6035
01:55:59,960 --> 01:56:02,550
molecules bouncing around is the Navia
Stokes equations that's just a piece of

6036
01:56:02,550 --> 01:56:02,560
Stokes equations that's just a piece of
 

6037
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:06,470
Stokes equations that's just a piece of
mathematics it's not it doesn't rely on

6038
01:56:06,470 --> 01:56:06,480
mathematics it's not it doesn't rely on
 

6039
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:08,550
mathematics it's not it doesn't rely on
uh you have to make certain assumptions

6040
01:56:08,550 --> 01:56:08,560
uh you have to make certain assumptions
 

6041
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:10,270
uh you have to make certain assumptions
that you have to say there's enough

6042
01:56:10,270 --> 01:56:10,280
that you have to say there's enough
 

6043
01:56:10,280 --> 01:56:11,669
that you have to say there's enough
Randomness in the way the molecules

averages work etc etc etc okay it is a

6048
01:56:16,629 --> 01:56:16,639
averages work etc etc etc okay it is a
 

6049
01:56:16,639 --> 01:56:19,030
averages work etc etc etc okay it is a
very similar derivation to derive for

6050
01:56:19,030 --> 01:56:19,040
very similar derivation to derive for
 

6051
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:21,709
very similar derivation to derive for
example the Einstein equations okay so

6052
01:56:21,709 --> 01:56:21,719
example the Einstein equations okay so
 

6053
01:56:21,719 --> 01:56:24,109

the way that Works roughly the einin

6054
01:56:24,109 --> 01:56:24,119
the way that Works roughly the einin
 

6055
01:56:24,119 --> 01:56:26,550
the way that Works roughly the einin
equations are about curvature of space

6056
01:56:26,550 --> 01:56:26,560
equations are about curvature of space
 

6057
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:28,830
equations are about curvature of space
uh curvature of space I talked about

6058
01:56:28,830 --> 01:56:28,840
uh curvature of space I talked about
 

6059
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:30,709
uh curvature of space I talked about
sort of how you can figure out dimension

6060
01:56:30,709 --> 01:56:30,719
sort of how you can figure out dimension
 

6061
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:32,990
sort of how you can figure out dimension
of space there's a similar kind of way

6062
01:56:32,990 --> 01:56:33,000
of space there's a similar kind of way
 

6063
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,390
of space there's a similar kind of way
of figuring out if you if you just sort

6064
01:56:35,390 --> 01:56:35,400
of figuring out if you if you just sort
 

6065
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:37,870
of figuring out if you if you just sort
of say um uh you know you're making a

6066
01:56:37,870 --> 01:56:37,880
of say um uh you know you're making a
 

6067
01:56:37,880 --> 01:56:39,990
of say um uh you know you're making a
larger larger ball or larger and larger

6068
01:56:39,990 --> 01:56:40,000
larger larger ball or larger and larger
 

6069
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:41,470
larger larger ball or larger and larger
if you draw a circle on the surface of

6070
01:56:41,470 --> 01:56:41,480
if you draw a circle on the surface of
 

6071
01:56:41,480 --> 01:56:43,870
if you draw a circle on the surface of
the Earth for example you might think

6072
01:56:43,870 --> 01:56:43,880
the Earth for example you might think
 

6073
01:56:43,880 --> 01:56:46,149
the Earth for example you might think
the area of a circle is pi r squ but on

6074
01:56:46,149 --> 01:56:46,159
the area of a circle is pi r squ but on
 

6075
01:56:46,159 --> 01:56:48,870
the area of a circle is pi r squ but on
the surface of the Earth because it's a

6076
01:56:48,870 --> 01:56:48,880
the surface of the Earth because it's a
 

6077
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:51,550
the surface of the Earth because it's a
sphere it's not flat the the area of a

6078
01:56:51,550 --> 01:56:51,560
sphere it's not flat the the area of a
 

6079
01:56:51,560 --> 01:56:53,589
sphere it's not flat the the area of a
circle isn't precisely P pi r s as the

6080
01:56:53,589 --> 01:56:53,599
circle isn't precisely P pi r s as the
 

6081
01:56:53,599 --> 01:56:55,830
circle isn't precisely P pi r s as the
circle gets bigger the area is slightly

6082
01:56:55,830 --> 01:56:55,840
circle gets bigger the area is slightly
 

6083
01:56:55,840 --> 01:56:57,189
circle gets bigger the area is slightly
smaller than you would expect from the

6084
01:56:57,189 --> 01:56:57,199
smaller than you would expect from the
 

6085
01:56:57,199 --> 01:56:58,510
smaller than you would expect from the
formula P Pi R square has a little

6086
01:56:58,510 --> 01:56:58,520
formula P Pi R square has a little
 

6087
01:56:58,520 --> 01:57:00,629
formula P Pi R square has a little
correction term that depends on the the

6088
01:57:00,629 --> 01:57:00,639
correction term that depends on the the
 

6089
01:57:00,639 --> 01:57:02,270
correction term that depends on the the
ratio of the size of the circle to the

6090
01:57:02,270 --> 01:57:02,280
ratio of the size of the circle to the
 

6091
01:57:02,280 --> 01:57:04,709
ratio of the size of the circle to the
radius of the Earth okay so it's the

6092
01:57:04,709 --> 01:57:04,719
radius of the Earth okay so it's the
 

6093
01:57:04,719 --> 01:57:06,669
radius of the Earth okay so it's the
same basic thing allows you to measure

6094
01:57:06,669 --> 01:57:06,679
same basic thing allows you to measure
 

6095
01:57:06,679 --> 01:57:08,510
same basic thing allows you to measure

its effective
curvature and that's oh so um the little

6100
01:57:13,830 --> 01:57:13,840

6101
01:57:13,840 --> 01:57:16,870

piece of mathematics that uh explains

6102
01:57:16,870 --> 01:57:16,880
piece of mathematics that uh explains
 

6103
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:18,430
piece of mathematics that uh explains
special general

describe fundamental property of the

6108
01:57:25,629 --> 01:57:25,639
describe fundamental property of the
 

6109
01:57:25,639 --> 01:57:29,270

01:57:29,270 --> 01:57:29,280
hyps the curvature of H so special
 

6111
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:31,430
hyps the curvature of H so special
relativity is about the relationship of

6112
01:57:31,430 --> 01:57:31,440
relativity is about the relationship of
 

6113
01:57:31,440 --> 01:57:33,990
relativity is about the relationship of
time to space general relativity is

6114
01:57:33,990 --> 01:57:34,000
time to space general relativity is
 

6115
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,030
time to space general relativity is
about curvature in in this space

6116
01:57:37,030 --> 01:57:37,040
about curvature in in this space
 

6117
01:57:37,040 --> 01:57:38,750
about curvature in in this space
represented by this hypergraph so what

6118
01:57:38,750 --> 01:57:38,760
represented by this hypergraph so what
 

6119
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:41,830
represented by this hypergraph so what
is the curvature of a hypergraph okay so

6120
01:57:41,830 --> 01:57:41,840
is the curvature of a hypergraph okay so
 

6121
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:43,950
is the curvature of a hypergraph okay so
first I have to explain what was

6122
01:57:43,950 --> 01:57:43,960
first I have to explain what was
 

6123
01:57:43,960 --> 01:57:45,310
first I have to explain what was
explaining is first thing you have to

6124
01:57:45,310 --> 01:57:45,320
explaining is first thing you have to
 

6125
01:57:45,320 --> 01:57:47,510
explaining is first thing you have to
have is a notional Dimension you don't

6126
01:57:47,510 --> 01:57:47,520
have is a notional Dimension you don't
 

6127
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:49,430
have is a notional Dimension you don't
get to talk about curvature of things if

6128
01:57:49,430 --> 01:57:49,440
get to talk about curvature of things if
 

6129
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:51,870
get to talk about curvature of things if
you say oh it's a curved line but I

6130
01:57:51,870 --> 01:57:51,880
you say oh it's a curved line but I
 

6131
01:57:51,880 --> 01:57:54,510
you say oh it's a curved line but I
don't what a line is yet so yeah what is

6132
01:57:54,510 --> 01:57:54,520
don't what a line is yet so yeah what is
 

6133
01:57:54,520 --> 01:58:03,470
don't what a line is yet so yeah what is
the dimension of a

6134
01:58:03,470 --> 01:58:03,480

 

6135
01:58:03,480 --> 01:58:05,589

hypography hypergraph it's got a

6136
01:58:05,589 --> 01:58:05,599
hypography hypergraph it's got a
 

6137
01:58:05,599 --> 01:58:07,790
hypography hypergraph it's got a
trillion nodes in it yeah what is it

6138
01:58:07,790 --> 01:58:07,800
trillion nodes in it yeah what is it
 

6139
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:10,030
trillion nodes in it yeah what is it
roughly like is it roughly like a grid a

6140
01:58:10,030 --> 01:58:10,040
roughly like is it roughly like a grid a
 

6141
01:58:10,040 --> 01:58:12,270
roughly like is it roughly like a grid a
two-dimensional grid is it roughly like

6142
01:58:12,270 --> 01:58:12,280
two-dimensional grid is it roughly like
 

6143
01:58:12,280 --> 01:58:14,270
two-dimensional grid is it roughly like
all those all those nodes are arranged

6144
01:58:14,270 --> 01:58:14,280
all those all those nodes are arranged
 

6145
01:58:14,280 --> 01:58:17,149
all those all those nodes are arranged
on line what's it roughly like and

6146
01:58:17,149 --> 01:58:17,159
on line what's it roughly like and
 

6147
01:58:17,159 --> 01:58:19,510
on line what's it roughly like and
there's a pretty simple mathematical way

6148
01:58:19,510 --> 01:58:19,520
there's a pretty simple mathematical way
 

6149
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:22,189
there's a pretty simple mathematical way
to estimate that by just looking at the

6150
01:58:22,189 --> 01:58:22,199
to estimate that by just looking at the
 

6151
01:58:22,199 --> 01:58:24,910
to estimate that by just looking at the
the the this thing I was describing this

6152
01:58:24,910 --> 01:58:24,920
the the this thing I was describing this
 

6153
01:58:24,920 --> 01:58:26,550
the the this thing I was describing this
sort of the size of a ball that you

6154
01:58:26,550 --> 01:58:26,560
sort of the size of a ball that you
 

6155
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:28,950
sort of the size of a ball that you
construct in the hypergraph that's a you

6156
01:58:28,950 --> 01:58:28,960
construct in the hypergraph that's a you
 

6157
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:30,510
construct in the hypergraph that's a you
just measure that you can just you know

6158
01:58:30,510 --> 01:58:30,520
just measure that you can just you know
 

6159
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:31,990
just measure that you can just you know
comput it on a computer for a given

6160
01:58:31,990 --> 01:58:32,000
comput it on a computer for a given
 

6161
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,189
comput it on a computer for a given
hypergraph and you can say oh this thing

6162
01:58:34,189 --> 01:58:34,199
hypergraph and you can say oh this thing
 

6163
01:58:34,199 --> 01:58:36,510
hypergraph and you can say oh this thing
is wiggling around but it's it's roughly

6164
01:58:36,510 --> 01:58:36,520
is wiggling around but it's it's roughly
 

6165
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:38,030
is wiggling around but it's it's roughly
corresponds to two or something like

6166
01:58:38,030 --> 01:58:38,040
corresponds to two or something like
 

6167
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:40,669
corresponds to two or something like
that it roughly corresponds to 2.6 or

6168
01:58:40,669 --> 01:58:40,679
that it roughly corresponds to 2.6 or
 

6169
01:58:40,679 --> 01:58:42,709
that it roughly corresponds to 2.6 or
whatever so that's how you that's how

6170
01:58:42,709 --> 01:58:42,719
whatever so that's how you that's how
 

6171
01:58:42,719 --> 01:58:44,550
whatever so that's how you that's how
you have a notion of dimension in these

6172
01:58:44,550 --> 01:58:44,560
you have a notion of dimension in these
 

6173
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:47,310
you have a notion of dimension in these
hypergraphs curvature is something a

6174
01:58:47,310 --> 01:58:47,320
hypergraphs curvature is something a
 

6175
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:49,109
hypergraphs curvature is something a
little bit beyond that it's if you look

6176
01:58:49,109 --> 01:58:49,119
little bit beyond that it's if you look
 

6177
01:58:49,119 --> 01:58:51,350
little bit beyond that it's if you look
at the how the size of this ball

6178
01:58:51,350 --> 01:58:51,360
at the how the size of this ball
 

6179
01:58:51,360 --> 01:58:53,910
at the how the size of this ball
increases as you increase its radius

6180
01:58:53,910 --> 01:58:53,920
increases as you increase its radius
 

6181
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:56,950
increases as you increase its radius
curvature is a correction to the SI size

6182
01:58:56,950 --> 01:58:56,960
curvature is a correction to the SI size
 

6183
01:58:56,960 --> 01:58:59,030
curvature is a correction to the SI size
increased associated with Dimension it's

6184
01:58:59,030 --> 01:58:59,040
increased associated with Dimension it's
 

6185
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:02,229
increased associated with Dimension it's
a sort of a second order term in in the

6186
01:59:02,229 --> 01:59:02,239
a sort of a second order term in in the
 

6187
01:59:02,239 --> 01:59:04,109
a sort of a second order term in in the
in determining the size just like the

6188
01:59:04,109 --> 01:59:04,119
in determining the size just like the
 

6189
01:59:04,119 --> 01:59:07,109
in determining the size just like the
area of a circle is roughly P pi r s so

6190
01:59:07,109 --> 01:59:07,119
area of a circle is roughly P pi r s so
 

6191
01:59:07,119 --> 01:59:09,149
area of a circle is roughly P pi r s so
it goes up like R squar the two is

6192
01:59:09,149 --> 01:59:09,159
it goes up like R squar the two is
 

6193
01:59:09,159 --> 01:59:11,750
it goes up like R squar the two is
because it's in two Dimensions but when

6194
01:59:11,750 --> 01:59:11,760
because it's in two Dimensions but when
 

6195
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:14,830
because it's in two Dimensions but when
that circle is drawn on a big sphere the

6196
01:59:14,830 --> 01:59:14,840
that circle is drawn on a big sphere the
 

6197
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:18,030
that circle is drawn on a big sphere the
the actual formula is pi r 2 * 1

6198
01:59:18,030 --> 01:59:18,040
the actual formula is pi r 2 * 1
 

6199
01:59:18,040 --> 01:59:21,310
the actual formula is pi r 2 * 1
minus uh R 2 over a 2 and some

6200
01:59:21,310 --> 01:59:21,320
minus uh R 2 over a 2 and some
 

6201
01:59:21,320 --> 01:59:22,669
minus uh R 2 over a 2 and some
coefficient

6202
01:59:22,669 --> 01:59:22,679
coefficient
 

6203
01:59:22,679 --> 01:59:24,709
coefficient
so in other words there's a correction

6204
01:59:24,709 --> 01:59:24,719
so in other words there's a correction
 

6205
01:59:24,719 --> 01:59:27,069
so in other words there's a correction
to and that correction term that gives

6206
01:59:27,069 --> 01:59:27,079
to and that correction term that gives
 

6207
01:59:27,079 --> 01:59:29,750
to and that correction term that gives
you coverture and that correction term

6208
01:59:29,750 --> 01:59:29,760
you coverture and that correction term
 

6209
01:59:29,760 --> 01:59:32,910
you coverture and that correction term
is what makes this hypergraph correspond

6210
01:59:32,910 --> 01:59:32,920
is what makes this hypergraph correspond
 

6211
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:34,390
is what makes this hypergraph correspond
have the potential to correspond to

curved space now the next question is is

6214
01:59:37,750 --> 01:59:37,760
curved space now the next question is is
 

6215
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:39,510
curved space now the next question is is
that curvature is the way that curvature

6216
01:59:39,510 --> 01:59:39,520
that curvature is the way that curvature
 

6217
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:41,669
that curvature is the way that curvature
works the way that Einstein's equations

6218
01:59:41,669 --> 01:59:41,679
works the way that Einstein's equations
 

6219
01:59:41,679 --> 01:59:44,109
works the way that Einstein's equations
of general relativity you know is it the

6220
01:59:44,109 --> 01:59:44,119
of general relativity you know is it the
 

6221
01:59:44,119 --> 01:59:46,390
of general relativity you know is it the
way they say it should work and the

6222
01:59:46,390 --> 01:59:46,400
way they say it should work and the
 

6223
01:59:46,400 --> 01:59:51,550
way they say it should work and the
answer is uh yes and the and so how does

6224
01:59:51,550 --> 01:59:51,560
answer is uh yes and the and so how does
 

6225
01:59:51,560 --> 01:59:54,709
answer is uh yes and the and so how does
that work the I mean you the the

6226
01:59:54,709 --> 01:59:54,719
that work the I mean you the the
 

6227
01:59:54,719 --> 01:59:56,310
that work the I mean you the the

02:00:04,550 --> 02:00:04,560
have causal invariance and computational
 

6237
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:06,990
have causal invariance and computational
irreducibility and and they lead to

6238
02:00:06,990 --> 02:00:07,000

02:01:01,750 --> 02:01:01,760
know the answer to that and but but you
 

6283
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:02,950
know the answer to that and but but you
know it gets a little bit more

know it gets a little bit more
 

6285
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:04,629
know it gets a little bit more
complicated because for example it's

complicated because for example it's
 

6287
02:01:04,639 --> 02:01:06,109
complicated because for example it's
very possibly the case that in our

02:02:15,589 --> 02:02:15,599
footnote to that which we should get to
 

6349
02:02:15,599 --> 02:02:17,350
footnote to that which we should get to
because it requires a few more steps

6350
02:02:17,350 --> 02:02:17,360
because it requires a few more steps
 

6351
02:02:17,360 --> 02:02:18,910
because it requires a few more steps
okay well actually then let's backtrack

6352
02:02:18,910 --> 02:02:18,920
okay well actually then let's backtrack
 

6353
02:02:18,920 --> 02:02:20,589
okay well actually then let's backtrack
to the curvature because we're talking

6354
02:02:20,589 --> 02:02:20,599
to the curvature because we're talking
 

6355
02:02:20,599 --> 02:02:23,390
to the curvature because we're talking
about as long as it's finite

6356
02:02:23,390 --> 02:02:23,400
about as long as it's finite
 

6357
02:02:23,400 --> 02:02:26,189
about as long as it's finite
dimensional uh finite dimensional

6358
02:02:26,189 --> 02:02:26,199
dimensional uh finite dimensional
 

6359
02:02:26,199 --> 02:02:28,790

computational irreducibility and causal

6360
02:02:28,790 --> 02:02:28,800
computational irreducibility and causal
 

6361
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:33,430
computational irreducibility and causal
invariance then it follows that uh the

6362
02:02:33,430 --> 02:02:33,440
invariance then it follows that uh the
 

6363
02:02:33,440 --> 02:02:35,950
invariance then it follows that uh the
uh that the large scale structure will

6364
02:02:35,950 --> 02:02:35,960
uh that the large scale structure will
 

6365
02:02:35,960 --> 02:02:38,830
uh that the large scale structure will
follow Einstein's equations and now let

6366
02:02:38,830 --> 02:02:38,840
follow Einstein's equations and now let
 

6367
02:02:38,840 --> 02:02:40,709
follow Einstein's equations and now let
me again qualify that a little bit more

6368
02:02:40,709 --> 02:02:40,719
me again qualify that a little bit more
 

6369
02:02:40,719 --> 02:02:42,470
me again qualify that a little bit more
there's a little bit more complexity to

6370
02:02:42,470 --> 02:02:42,480
there's a little bit more complexity to
 

6371
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:47,030
there's a little bit more complexity to
it the um uh okay so Einstein's

6372
02:02:47,030 --> 02:02:47,040
it the um uh okay so Einstein's
 

6373
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:48,910
it the um uh okay so Einstein's
equations in their simplest form apply

6374
02:02:48,910 --> 02:02:48,920
equations in their simplest form apply
 

6375
02:02:48,920 --> 02:02:52,270
equations in their simplest form apply
to the vacuum no matter just the vacuum

6376
02:02:52,270 --> 02:02:52,280
to the vacuum no matter just the vacuum
 

6377
02:02:52,280 --> 02:02:54,589
to the vacuum no matter just the vacuum
and they say in particular what they say

6378
02:02:54,589 --> 02:02:54,599
and they say in particular what they say
 

6379
02:02:54,599 --> 02:02:57,669
and they say in particular what they say
is if you have um uh so there's this

6380
02:02:57,669 --> 02:02:57,679
is if you have um uh so there's this
 

6381
02:02:57,679 --> 02:03:00,189
is if you have um uh so there's this
term jisc that's a term that means

6382
02:03:00,189 --> 02:03:00,199
term jisc that's a term that means
 

6383
02:03:00,199 --> 02:03:02,550
term jisc that's a term that means
shortest path comes from measuring

6384
02:03:02,550 --> 02:03:02,560
shortest path comes from measuring
 

6385
02:03:02,560 --> 02:03:05,189
shortest path comes from measuring
shortest paths on the earth so you you

6386
02:03:05,189 --> 02:03:05,199
shortest paths on the earth so you you
 

6387
02:03:05,199 --> 02:03:08,270
shortest paths on the earth so you you
look at a bunch of a bundle of jd6 a

6388
02:03:08,270 --> 02:03:08,280
look at a bunch of a bundle of jd6 a
 

6389
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:10,589
look at a bunch of a bundle of jd6 a
bunch of shortest paths it's like the

6390
02:03:10,589 --> 02:03:10,599
bunch of shortest paths it's like the
 

6391
02:03:10,599 --> 02:03:12,350
bunch of shortest paths it's like the
paths that photons would take between

6392
02:03:12,350 --> 02:03:12,360
paths that photons would take between
 

6393
02:03:12,360 --> 02:03:14,589

02:03:20,990 --> 02:03:21,000
you look at a bundle of gd6 the
 

6401
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,470
you look at a bundle of gd6 the

02:03:32,470 --> 02:03:32,480
the cross-sectional area does not that's
 

6411
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:34,270
the cross-sectional area does not that's
a version that's a that's the most

02:03:40,239 --> 02:03:41,510
half r g mu new equals z which is the
the more mathematical version of

the more mathematical version of
 

6419
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:43,870
the more mathematical version of

6425
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:49,709
Richie tensor is equal to zero um that's
that's Einstein's equations for the

that's Einstein's equations for the
 

6427
02:03:49,719 --> 02:03:52,430
that's Einstein's equations for the
vacuum okay so we get that

02:03:52,430 --> 02:03:52,440
vacuum okay so we get that
 

6429
02:03:52,440 --> 02:03:55,990

because all the matter in the universe

02:04:00,709 --> 02:04:00,719
because all the matter in the universe
 

6435
02:04:00,719 --> 02:04:02,270
because all the matter in the universe
is the stuff we actually care about the

02:04:08,790 --> 02:04:08,800
this and for that you have to understand
 

6443
02:04:08,800 --> 02:04:12,270
this and for that you have to understand
what energy is in these models and um

energy in these models
 

6453
02:04:22,440 --> 02:04:24,229
energy in these models
okay and

02:04:24,229 --> 02:04:24,239
okay and
 

6455
02:04:24,239 --> 02:04:28,549
okay and
energy is basically well intuitively

6456
02:04:28,549 --> 02:04:28,559
energy is basically well intuitively
 

6457
02:04:28,559 --> 02:04:32,310
energy is basically well intuitively
it's the amount of activity in these

6458
02:04:32,310 --> 02:04:32,320
it's the amount of activity in these
 

6459
02:04:32,320 --> 02:04:35,870
it's the amount of activity in these
hypergraphs and the way that that

6460
02:04:35,870 --> 02:04:35,880
hypergraphs and the way that that
 

6461
02:04:35,880 --> 02:04:38,109
hypergraphs and the way that that
remains over time so a little bit more

6462
02:04:38,109 --> 02:04:38,119
remains over time so a little bit more
 

6463
02:04:38,119 --> 02:04:40,750
remains over time so a little bit more
formally you can think about this causal

6464
02:04:40,750 --> 02:04:40,760
formally you can think about this causal
 

6465
02:04:40,760 --> 02:04:42,709
formally you can think about this causal
graph as having these edges that

6466
02:04:42,709 --> 02:04:42,719
graph as having these edges that
 

6467
02:04:42,719 --> 02:04:45,189
graph as having these edges that
represent causal relationships you can

6468
02:04:45,189 --> 02:04:45,199
represent causal relationships you can
 

6469
02:04:45,199 --> 02:04:46,709
represent causal relationships you can
think about oh boy there's one more

6470
02:04:46,709 --> 02:04:46,719
think about oh boy there's one more
 

6471
02:04:46,719 --> 02:04:48,350
think about oh boy there's one more
concept that we didn't get to is that

6472
02:04:48,350 --> 02:04:48,360
concept that we didn't get to is that
 

6473
02:04:48,360 --> 02:04:50,069
concept that we didn't get to is that
the the notion of space-like

6474
02:04:50,069 --> 02:04:50,079
the the notion of space-like
 

6475
02:04:50,079 --> 02:04:51,870
the the notion of space-like
hypersurfaces

6476
02:04:51,870 --> 02:04:51,880
hypersurfaces
 

6477
02:04:51,880 --> 02:04:55,030
hypersurfaces
so this is this is a is not as scary as

6478
02:04:55,030 --> 02:04:55,040
so this is this is a is not as scary as
 

6479
02:04:55,040 --> 02:04:57,470
so this is this is a is not as scary as
it sounds the the um it's a it's a

6480
02:04:57,470 --> 02:04:57,480
it sounds the the um it's a it's a
 

6481
02:04:57,480 --> 02:04:59,910
it sounds the the um it's a it's a
common notion in general it's a the

6482
02:04:59,910 --> 02:04:59,920
common notion in general it's a the
 

6483
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:03,229
common notion in general it's a the
notion is you are you're defining what

6484
02:05:03,229 --> 02:05:03,239
notion is you are you're defining what
 

6485
02:05:03,239 --> 02:05:09,629
notion is you are you're defining what
is a possibly what is what um where in

6486
02:05:09,629 --> 02:05:09,639
is a possibly what is what um where in
 

6487
02:05:09,639 --> 02:05:12,950
is a possibly what is what um where in
SpaceTime might be a particular moment

6488
02:05:12,950 --> 02:05:12,960
SpaceTime might be a particular moment
 

6489
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:16,069
SpaceTime might be a particular moment
in time so in other words what what is a

6490
02:05:16,069 --> 02:05:16,079
in time so in other words what what is a
 

6491
02:05:16,079 --> 02:05:18,709
in time so in other words what what is a
consistent set of places where you can

6492
02:05:18,709 --> 02:05:18,719
consistent set of places where you can
 

6493
02:05:18,719 --> 02:05:21,870
consistent set of places where you can
say this is happening now so to speak

6494
02:05:21,870 --> 02:05:21,880
say this is happening now so to speak
 

6495
02:05:21,880 --> 02:05:24,270
say this is happening now so to speak
and you make this series of of of sort

6496
02:05:24,270 --> 02:05:24,280
and you make this series of of of sort
 

6497
02:05:24,280 --> 02:05:27,430
and you make this series of of of sort
of slices through the SpaceTime uh

6498
02:05:27,430 --> 02:05:27,440
of slices through the SpaceTime uh

02:05:32,360 --> 02:05:34,790
represent sort of what we consider to be
successive moments in time okay it's

6504
02:05:34,790 --> 02:05:34,800
successive moments in time okay it's
 

6505
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:36,709
successive moments in time okay it's
somewhat arbitrary because you can you

6506
02:05:36,709 --> 02:05:36,719
somewhat arbitrary because you can you
 

6507
02:05:36,719 --> 02:05:38,350
somewhat arbitrary because you can you
can deform that if you're going at a

6508
02:05:38,350 --> 02:05:38,360
can deform that if you're going at a
 

6509
02:05:38,360 --> 02:05:40,030
can deform that if you're going at a
different speed and special relativity

6510
02:05:40,030 --> 02:05:40,040
different speed and special relativity
 

6511
02:05:40,040 --> 02:05:42,910
different speed and special relativity
you tip those things if you're you can

6512
02:05:42,910 --> 02:05:42,920
you tip those things if you're you can
 

6513
02:05:42,920 --> 02:05:44,390
you tip those things if you're you can
you know there there are different kinds

6514
02:05:44,390 --> 02:05:44,400
you know there there are different kinds
 

6515
02:05:44,400 --> 02:05:46,149
you know there there are different kinds
of defamations but only certain

6516
02:05:46,149 --> 02:05:46,159
of defamations but only certain
 

6517
02:05:46,159 --> 02:05:47,709
of defamations but only certain
defamations are allowed by the structure

6518
02:05:47,709 --> 02:05:47,719
defamations are allowed by the structure
 

6519
02:05:47,719 --> 02:05:49,750
defamations are allowed by the structure
of the causal graph anyway be there as

6520
02:05:49,750 --> 02:05:49,760
of the causal graph anyway be there as
 

6521
02:05:49,760 --> 02:05:52,470
of the causal graph anyway be there as
it may the the the basic point is there

6522
02:05:52,470 --> 02:05:52,480
it may the the the basic point is there
 

6523
02:05:52,480 --> 02:05:54,950
it may the the the basic point is there
is a way of figuring out you know you

6524
02:05:54,950 --> 02:05:54,960
is a way of figuring out you know you
 

6525
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:57,270
is a way of figuring out you know you
say what is the energy associated with

6526
02:05:57,270 --> 02:05:57,280
say what is the energy associated with
 

6527
02:05:57,280 --> 02:05:59,350
say what is the energy associated with
what's going on in this in this

6528
02:05:59,350 --> 02:05:59,360
what's going on in this in this
 

6529
02:05:59,360 --> 02:06:02,470
what's going on in this in this
hypergraph and the answer is there is a

6530
02:06:02,470 --> 02:06:02,480
hypergraph and the answer is there is a
 

6531
02:06:02,480 --> 02:06:05,549
hypergraph and the answer is there is a
precise definition of that and it is the

6532
02:06:05,549 --> 02:06:05,559
precise definition of that and it is the
 

6533
02:06:05,559 --> 02:06:07,750
precise definition of that and it is the
formal way to say it is it's the Flux Of

6534
02:06:07,750 --> 02:06:07,760
formal way to say it is it's the Flux Of
 

6535
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:09,270
formal way to say it is it's the Flux Of
causal edges through space likee

6536
02:06:09,270 --> 02:06:09,280
causal edges through space likee
 

6537
02:06:09,280 --> 02:06:11,709
causal edges through space likee
hypersurfaces the slightly less formal

6538
02:06:11,709 --> 02:06:11,719
hypersurfaces the slightly less formal
 

6539
02:06:11,719 --> 02:06:13,790
hypersurfaces the slightly less formal
way to say it it's basically the amount

6540
02:06:13,790 --> 02:06:13,800
way to say it it's basically the amount
 

6541
02:06:13,800 --> 02:06:16,149
way to say it it's basically the amount
of activity the the see the reason it

6542
02:06:16,149 --> 02:06:16,159
of activity the the see the reason it
 

6543
02:06:16,159 --> 02:06:18,310
of activity the the see the reason it
gets tricky is you might say it's the

6544
02:06:18,310 --> 02:06:18,320
gets tricky is you might say it's the
 

6545
02:06:18,320 --> 02:06:22,149
gets tricky is you might say it's the
amount of activity per unit volume in in

6546
02:06:22,149 --> 02:06:22,159
amount of activity per unit volume in in
 

6547
02:06:22,159 --> 02:06:24,069
amount of activity per unit volume in in
this hyper graph but you haven't defined

6548
02:06:24,069 --> 02:06:24,079
this hyper graph but you haven't defined
 

6549
02:06:24,079 --> 02:06:26,109
this hyper graph but you haven't defined
what volume is so it's it's it's a

6550
02:06:26,109 --> 02:06:26,119
what volume is so it's it's it's a
 

6551
02:06:26,119 --> 02:06:27,510
what volume is so it's it's it's a
little bit that you have to but this

6552
02:06:27,510 --> 02:06:27,520
little bit that you have to but this
 

6553
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:30,069
little bit that you have to but this
hypersurface gives some more formalism

6554
02:06:30,069 --> 02:06:30,079
hypersurface gives some more formalism
 

6555
02:06:30,079 --> 02:06:32,510
hypersurface gives some more formalism
to that yeah it gives a way to connect

6556
02:06:32,510 --> 02:06:32,520
to that yeah it gives a way to connect
 

6557
02:06:32,520 --> 02:06:33,830
to that yeah it gives a way to connect
that to but intuitive we should think

6558
02:06:33,830 --> 02:06:33,840
that to but intuitive we should think
 

6559
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:36,510
that to but intuitive we should think
about is the just the amount of activity

6560
02:06:36,510 --> 02:06:36,520
about is the just the amount of activity
 

6561
02:06:36,520 --> 02:06:38,589
about is the just the amount of activity
right so so the amount of activity that

6562
02:06:38,589 --> 02:06:38,599
right so so the amount of activity that
 

6563
02:06:38,599 --> 02:06:40,510
right so so the amount of activity that
kind of remains in one place in the

6564
02:06:40,510 --> 02:06:40,520
kind of remains in one place in the
 

6565
02:06:40,520 --> 02:06:42,830
kind of remains in one place in the
hypergraph corresponds to energy the

6566
02:06:42,830 --> 02:06:42,840
hypergraph corresponds to energy the
 

6567
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:44,589
hypergraph corresponds to energy the
amount of activity that is kind of where

6568
02:06:44,589 --> 02:06:44,599
amount of activity that is kind of where
 

6569
02:06:44,599 --> 02:06:46,669
amount of activity that is kind of where
an activity here affects an activity

6570
02:06:46,669 --> 02:06:46,679
an activity here affects an activity
 

6571
02:06:46,679 --> 02:06:50,470
an activity here affects an activity
somewhere else C corresponds to momentum

6572
02:06:50,470 --> 02:06:50,480
somewhere else C corresponds to momentum
 

6573
02:06:50,480 --> 02:06:52,629
somewhere else C corresponds to momentum
and um and so one of the things that's

6574
02:06:52,629 --> 02:06:52,639
and um and so one of the things that's
 

6575
02:06:52,639 --> 02:06:55,350
and um and so one of the things that's
kind of cool is that I'm trying to think

6576
02:06:55,350 --> 02:06:55,360
kind of cool is that I'm trying to think
 

6577
02:06:55,360 --> 02:06:56,790
kind of cool is that I'm trying to think
about how to say this intuitively the

6578
02:06:56,790 --> 02:06:56,800
about how to say this intuitively the
 

6579
02:06:56,800 --> 02:06:58,229
about how to say this intuitively the
mathematics is easy but the the

6580
02:06:58,229 --> 02:06:58,239
mathematics is easy but the the
 

6581
02:06:58,239 --> 02:06:59,950
mathematics is easy but the the
intuitive version I'm not sure but

6582
02:06:59,950 --> 02:06:59,960
intuitive version I'm not sure but
 

6583
02:06:59,960 --> 02:07:01,270
intuitive version I'm not sure but
basically the way that things sort of

6584
02:07:01,270 --> 02:07:01,280
basically the way that things sort of
 

6585
02:07:01,280 --> 02:07:03,830
basically the way that things sort of
stay in the same place and have activity

6586
02:07:03,830 --> 02:07:03,840
stay in the same place and have activity
 

6587
02:07:03,840 --> 02:07:06,270
stay in the same place and have activity
is associated with rest mass and so one

6588
02:07:06,270 --> 02:07:06,280
is associated with rest mass and so one
 

6589
02:07:06,280 --> 02:07:08,109
is associated with rest mass and so one
of the things that you get to derive

6590
02:07:08,109 --> 02:07:08,119
of the things that you get to derive
 

6591
02:07:08,119 --> 02:07:09,390
of the things that you get to derive
isal

6592
02:07:09,390 --> 02:07:09,400
isal
 

6593
02:07:09,400 --> 02:07:12,669
isal
mc^2 um that is a consequence of this

6594
02:07:12,669 --> 02:07:12,679
mc^2 um that is a consequence of this
 

6595
02:07:12,679 --> 02:07:16,149
mc^2 um that is a consequence of this
interpretation of energy in terms of the

6596
02:07:16,149 --> 02:07:16,159
interpretation of energy in terms of the
 

6597
02:07:16,159 --> 02:07:18,589
interpretation of energy in terms of the
way the causal graph Works which is a

6598
02:07:18,589 --> 02:07:18,599
way the causal graph Works which is a
 

6599
02:07:18,599 --> 02:07:20,030
way the causal graph Works which is a
the whole thing is sort of a consequence

6600
02:07:20,030 --> 02:07:20,040
the whole thing is sort of a consequence
 

6601
02:07:20,040 --> 02:07:22,229
the whole thing is sort of a consequence
of this whole story about updates and

6602
02:07:22,229 --> 02:07:22,239
of this whole story about updates and
 

6603
02:07:22,239 --> 02:07:25,310
of this whole story about updates and
hypergraphs and so on so can you Linger

6604
02:07:25,310 --> 02:07:25,320
hypergraphs and so on so can you Linger
 

6605
02:07:25,320 --> 02:07:27,990
hypergraphs and so on so can you Linger
on that a little bit how do we get eals

6606
02:07:27,990 --> 02:07:28,000
on that a little bit how do we get eals
 

6607
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:31,430
on that a little bit how do we get eals
mc² so where does the mask come from so

6608
02:07:31,430 --> 02:07:31,440
mc² so where does the mask come from so
 

6609
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:33,790
mc² so where does the mask come from so
okay okay I mean without is there an

6610
02:07:33,790 --> 02:07:33,800
okay okay I mean without is there an
 

6611
02:07:33,800 --> 02:07:36,430
okay okay I mean without is there an
intuitive so okay F first of all you're

6612
02:07:36,430 --> 02:07:36,440
intuitive so okay F first of all you're
 

6613
02:07:36,440 --> 02:07:40,030
intuitive so okay F first of all you're
pretty deep in the mathematical

6614
02:07:40,030 --> 02:07:40,040
pretty deep in the mathematical
 

6615
02:07:40,040 --> 02:07:41,510
pretty deep in the mathematical
explorations of this thing right now

6616
02:07:41,510 --> 02:07:41,520
explorations of this thing right now
 

6617
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:44,229
explorations of this thing right now
we're in a very we're in a

6618
02:07:44,229 --> 02:07:44,239
we're in a very we're in a
 

6619
02:07:44,239 --> 02:07:47,229
we're in a very we're in a
flux uh currently so maybe you haven't

6620
02:07:47,229 --> 02:07:47,239
flux uh currently so maybe you haven't
 

6621
02:07:47,239 --> 02:07:49,709
flux uh currently so maybe you haven't
even had time to think about intuitive

6622
02:07:49,709 --> 02:07:49,719
even had time to think about intuitive
 

6623
02:07:49,719 --> 02:07:53,030
even had time to think about intuitive
explanations uh but yeah I mean this one

6624
02:07:53,030 --> 02:07:53,040
explanations uh but yeah I mean this one
 

6625
02:07:53,040 --> 02:07:55,310
explanations uh but yeah I mean this one
this one is is look roughly what's

6626
02:07:55,310 --> 02:07:55,320
this one is is look roughly what's
 

6627
02:07:55,320 --> 02:07:57,350
this one is is look roughly what's
happening that derivation is actually

6628
02:07:57,350 --> 02:07:57,360
happening that derivation is actually
 

6629
02:07:57,360 --> 02:07:59,510
happening that derivation is actually
rather easy and everybody and I've been

6630
02:07:59,510 --> 02:07:59,520
rather easy and everybody and I've been
 

6631
02:07:59,520 --> 02:08:00,910
rather easy and everybody and I've been
saying we should pay more attention to

6632
02:08:00,910 --> 02:08:00,920
saying we should pay more attention to
 

6633
02:08:00,920 --> 02:08:02,270
saying we should pay more attention to
this derivation because it's such you

6634
02:08:02,270 --> 02:08:02,280
this derivation because it's such you
 

6635
02:08:02,280 --> 02:08:04,270
this derivation because it's such you
know because people care about this one

6636
02:08:04,270 --> 02:08:04,280
know because people care about this one
 

6637
02:08:04,280 --> 02:08:06,270
know because people care about this one
and everybody says it's just easy it's

6638
02:08:06,270 --> 02:08:06,280
and everybody says it's just easy it's
 

6639
02:08:06,280 --> 02:08:08,549
and everybody says it's just easy it's
it's easy so there's some concept of

6640
02:08:08,549 --> 02:08:08,559
it's easy so there's some concept of
 

6641
02:08:08,559 --> 02:08:11,629
it's easy so there's some concept of
energy that's uh can be intuitively

6642
02:08:11,629 --> 02:08:11,639
energy that's uh can be intuitively
 

6643
02:08:11,639 --> 02:08:14,069
energy that's uh can be intuitively
thought of as the activity the the flux

6644
02:08:14,069 --> 02:08:14,079
thought of as the activity the the flux
 

6645
02:08:14,079 --> 02:08:16,310
thought of as the activity the the flux
the level the level of uh changes that

6646
02:08:16,310 --> 02:08:16,320
the level the level of uh changes that
 

6647
02:08:16,320 --> 02:08:18,310
the level the level of uh changes that
occurring based on the Transformations

6648
02:08:18,310 --> 02:08:18,320

6649
02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:19,870

within a certain volume however the heck

6650
02:08:19,870 --> 02:08:19,880
within a certain volume however the heck
 

6651
02:08:19,880 --> 02:08:22,629
within a certain volume however the heck
do you find the volume okay so and then

6652
02:08:22,629 --> 02:08:22,639
do you find the volume okay so and then
 

6653
02:08:22,639 --> 02:08:26,910
do you find the volume okay so and then
Mass well mass is is mass is associated

Mass well mass is is mass is associated
 

6655
02:08:26,920 --> 02:08:29,669
Mass well mass is is mass is associated
with kind of the energy that does not

with kind of the energy that does not
 

6657
02:08:29,679 --> 02:08:32,390
with kind of the energy that does not
cause you to that does not somehow

6658
02:08:32,390 --> 02:08:32,400
cause you to that does not somehow
 

6659
02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:34,750
cause you to that does not somehow
propagate through time yeah I mean one

6660
02:08:34,750 --> 02:08:34,760
propagate through time yeah I mean one
 

6661
02:08:34,760 --> 02:08:36,189
propagate through time yeah I mean one
of the things that was not obvious in

6662
02:08:36,189 --> 02:08:36,199
of the things that was not obvious in
 

6663
02:08:36,199 --> 02:08:38,870
of the things that was not obvious in
the usual formulation of speciality is

6664
02:08:38,870 --> 02:08:38,880
the usual formulation of speciality is
 

6665
02:08:38,880 --> 02:08:42,149
the usual formulation of speciality is
that space and time are connected in a

6666
02:08:42,149 --> 02:08:42,159
that space and time are connected in a
 

6667
02:08:42,159 --> 02:08:44,390
that space and time are connected in a
certain way energy moment and momentum

6668
02:08:44,390 --> 02:08:44,400
certain way energy moment and momentum
 

6669
02:08:44,400 --> 02:08:46,709
certain way energy moment and momentum
are also connected in a certain way the

6670
02:08:46,709 --> 02:08:46,719
are also connected in a certain way the
 

6671
02:08:46,719 --> 02:08:48,350
are also connected in a certain way the
fact that the connection of energy to

6672
02:08:48,350 --> 02:08:48,360
fact that the connection of energy to
 

6673
02:08:48,360 --> 02:08:50,510
fact that the connection of energy to
momentum is analogous to the connection

6674
02:08:50,510 --> 02:08:50,520
momentum is analogous to the connection
 

6675
02:08:50,520 --> 02:08:52,790
momentum is analogous to the connection
to space between space space and time is

6676
02:08:52,790 --> 02:08:52,800
to space between space space and time is
 

6677
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:55,189
to space between space space and time is
not self-evident in ordinary relativity

6678
02:08:55,189 --> 02:08:55,199
not self-evident in ordinary relativity
 

6679
02:08:55,199 --> 02:08:57,629
not self-evident in ordinary relativity
it is a consequence of this of the way

6680
02:08:57,629 --> 02:08:57,639
it is a consequence of this of the way
 

6681
02:08:57,639 --> 02:08:59,189
it is a consequence of this of the way
this model works it's an intrinsic

6682
02:08:59,189 --> 02:08:59,199
this model works it's an intrinsic
 

6683
02:08:59,199 --> 02:09:01,229
this model works it's an intrinsic
consequence of the way this model works

6684
02:09:01,229 --> 02:09:01,239
consequence of the way this model works
 

6685
02:09:01,239 --> 02:09:03,669
consequence of the way this model works
and it's all to do with that with with

6686
02:09:03,669 --> 02:09:03,679
and it's all to do with that with with
 

6687
02:09:03,679 --> 02:09:05,950
and it's all to do with that with with
unraveling that connection that ends up

6688
02:09:05,950 --> 02:09:05,960
unraveling that connection that ends up
 

6689
02:09:05,960 --> 02:09:07,910
unraveling that connection that ends up
giving you this this relationship

6690
02:09:07,910 --> 02:09:07,920
giving you this this relationship
 

6691
02:09:07,920 --> 02:09:11,589
giving you this this relationship
between energy and and well it's energy

6692
02:09:11,589 --> 02:09:11,599
between energy and and well it's energy
 

6693
02:09:11,599 --> 02:09:15,069
between energy and and well it's energy
momentum Mass they're all connected and

6694
02:09:15,069 --> 02:09:15,079
momentum Mass they're all connected and
 

6695
02:09:15,079 --> 02:09:18,750
momentum Mass they're all connected and
and so like uh that's hence the general

6696
02:09:18,750 --> 02:09:18,760
and so like uh that's hence the general
 

6697
02:09:18,760 --> 02:09:22,589
and so like uh that's hence the general
relativity you have a sense that uh it

6698
02:09:22,589 --> 02:09:22,599
relativity you have a sense that uh it
 

6699
02:09:22,599 --> 02:09:25,830
relativity you have a sense that uh it
appears to be baked in to the

6700
02:09:25,830 --> 02:09:25,840
appears to be baked in to the
 

6701
02:09:25,840 --> 02:09:28,470
appears to be baked in to the
fundamental properties of the way these

6702
02:09:28,470 --> 02:09:28,480
fundamental properties of the way these
 

6703
02:09:28,480 --> 02:09:29,990
fundamental properties of the way these
hypergraphs are evolved well I didn't

6704
02:09:29,990 --> 02:09:30,000
hypergraphs are evolved well I didn't
 

6705
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:31,870
hypergraphs are evolved well I didn't
yet get to so I I got as far as special

6706
02:09:31,870 --> 02:09:31,880
yet get to so I I got as far as special
 

6707
02:09:31,880 --> 02:09:34,750
yet get to so I I got as far as special
relativity and equals mc^ s the one last

6708
02:09:34,750 --> 02:09:34,760
relativity and equals mc^ s the one last
 

6709
02:09:34,760 --> 02:09:38,109
relativity and equals mc^ s the one last
step is in general relativity the the

6710
02:09:38,109 --> 02:09:38,119
step is in general relativity the the
 

6711
02:09:38,119 --> 02:09:42,750
step is in general relativity the the
final connection is energy Mass cause

6712
02:09:42,750 --> 02:09:42,760
final connection is energy Mass cause
 

6713
02:09:42,760 --> 02:09:46,310
final connection is energy Mass cause
curvature in space and that's something

6714
02:09:46,310 --> 02:09:46,320
curvature in space and that's something
 

6715
02:09:46,320 --> 02:09:48,270
curvature in space and that's something
that when you understand this

6716
02:09:48,270 --> 02:09:48,280
that when you understand this
 

6717
02:09:48,280 --> 02:09:51,069
that when you understand this
interpretation of energy and you kind of

6718
02:09:51,069 --> 02:09:51,079
interpretation of energy and you kind of
 

6719
02:09:51,079 --> 02:09:52,430
interpretation of energy and you kind of
understand the correspondence to

6720
02:09:52,430 --> 02:09:52,440
understand the correspondence to
 

6721
02:09:52,440 --> 02:09:54,830
understand the correspondence to
coverture and hypergraphs then you can

6722
02:09:54,830 --> 02:09:54,840
coverture and hypergraphs then you can
 

6723
02:09:54,840 --> 02:09:57,229
coverture and hypergraphs then you can
finally sort of the the big final answer

6724
02:09:57,229 --> 02:09:57,239
finally sort of the the big final answer
 

6725
02:09:57,239 --> 02:09:59,270
finally sort of the the big final answer
is you derive the full version of

6726
02:09:59,270 --> 02:09:59,280
is you derive the full version of
 

6727
02:09:59,280 --> 02:10:02,229
is you derive the full version of
Einstein's equations for space time and

6728
02:10:02,229 --> 02:10:02,239
Einstein's equations for space time and
 

6729
02:10:02,239 --> 02:10:06,270
Einstein's equations for space time and
matter um and that's um so is that have

6730
02:10:06,270 --> 02:10:06,280
matter um and that's um so is that have
 

6731
02:10:06,280 --> 02:10:10,430
matter um and that's um so is that have
you that last piece with curvature have

6732
02:10:10,430 --> 02:10:10,440
you that last piece with curvature have
 

6733
02:10:10,440 --> 02:10:12,709
you that last piece with curvature have
is that have you arrived there yet oh

6734
02:10:12,709 --> 02:10:12,719
is that have you arrived there yet oh
 

6735
02:10:12,719 --> 02:10:14,270
is that have you arrived there yet oh
yeah we're we're there yes and and

6736
02:10:14,270 --> 02:10:14,280
yeah we're we're there yes and and
 

6737
02:10:14,280 --> 02:10:16,030
yeah we're we're there yes and and
here's the here's the way that we here's

6738
02:10:16,030 --> 02:10:16,040
here's the here's the way that we here's
 

6739
02:10:16,040 --> 02:10:17,390
here's the here's the way that we here's
how we're really really going to know

6740
02:10:17,390 --> 02:10:17,400
how we're really really going to know
 

6741
02:10:17,400 --> 02:10:19,549
how we're really really going to know
we've arrived okay so you know we have

6742
02:10:19,549 --> 02:10:19,559
we've arrived okay so you know we have
 

6743
02:10:19,559 --> 02:10:21,430
we've arrived okay so you know we have
the mathematical derivation it's all

6744
02:10:21,430 --> 02:10:21,440
the mathematical derivation it's all
 

6745
02:10:21,440 --> 02:10:23,870
the mathematical derivation it's all
fine but but you know mathematical

6746
02:10:23,870 --> 02:10:23,880
fine but but you know mathematical
 

6747
02:10:23,880 --> 02:10:26,390
fine but but you know mathematical
derivations okay so one thing that's

6748
02:10:26,390 --> 02:10:26,400
derivations okay so one thing that's
 

6749
02:10:26,400 --> 02:10:28,510
derivations okay so one thing that's
sort of a a uh you know we're taking

6750
02:10:28,510 --> 02:10:28,520
sort of a a uh you know we're taking
 

6751
02:10:28,520 --> 02:10:30,990
sort of a a uh you know we're taking
this limit of what happens when you the

6752
02:10:30,990 --> 02:10:31,000
this limit of what happens when you the
 

6753
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:32,470
this limit of what happens when you the
limit you have to look at things which

6754
02:10:32,470 --> 02:10:32,480
limit you have to look at things which
 

6755
02:10:32,480 --> 02:10:34,189
limit you have to look at things which
are large compared to the size of an

6756
02:10:34,189 --> 02:10:34,199
are large compared to the size of an
 

6757
02:10:34,199 --> 02:10:36,390
are large compared to the size of an
elementary length small compared to the

6758
02:10:36,390 --> 02:10:36,400
elementary length small compared to the

6761
02:10:38,159 --> 02:10:39,870
whole size of the universe large
compared to certain kinds of

02:10:39,870 --> 02:10:39,880
compared to certain kinds of
 

6763
02:10:39,880 --> 02:10:42,229
compared to certain kinds of
fluctuations blah blah blah there's a

6764
02:10:42,229 --> 02:10:42,239
fluctuations blah blah blah there's a
 

6765
02:10:42,239 --> 02:10:44,189
fluctuations blah blah blah there's a
there's a there's a tower of many many

6766
02:10:44,189 --> 02:10:44,199
there's a there's a tower of many many
 

6767
02:10:44,199 --> 02:10:45,589
there's a there's a tower of many many
of these mathematical limits that have

6768
02:10:45,589 --> 02:10:45,599
of these mathematical limits that have
 

6769
02:10:45,599 --> 02:10:47,589
of these mathematical limits that have
to be taken so if you're a pure

6770
02:10:47,589 --> 02:10:47,599
to be taken so if you're a pure
 

6771
02:10:47,599 --> 02:10:50,310
to be taken so if you're a pure
mathematician saying where's the precise

6772
02:10:50,310 --> 02:10:50,320
mathematician saying where's the precise
 

6773
02:10:50,320 --> 02:10:51,870
mathematician saying where's the precise
proof it's like well there are all these

6774
02:10:51,870 --> 02:10:51,880
proof it's like well there are all these
 

6775
02:10:51,880 --> 02:10:54,310
proof it's like well there are all these
limits we can you know we can try each

6776
02:10:54,310 --> 02:10:54,320
limits we can you know we can try each
 

6777
02:10:54,320 --> 02:10:55,790
limits we can you know we can try each
one of them computationally and we can

6778
02:10:55,790 --> 02:10:55,800
one of them computationally and we can
 

6779
02:10:55,800 --> 02:10:58,629
one of them computationally and we can
say yeah it really works but the formal

6780
02:10:58,629 --> 02:10:58,639
say yeah it really works but the formal
 

6781
02:10:58,639 --> 02:11:00,750
say yeah it really works but the formal
mathematics is really hard to do I mean

6782
02:11:00,750 --> 02:11:00,760
mathematics is really hard to do I mean
 

6783
02:11:00,760 --> 02:11:03,229
mathematics is really hard to do I mean
for example in the case of deriving the

6784
02:11:03,229 --> 02:11:03,239
for example in the case of deriving the
 

6785
02:11:03,239 --> 02:11:04,709
for example in the case of deriving the
equations of fluid dynamics from

6786
02:11:04,709 --> 02:11:04,719
equations of fluid dynamics from
 

6787
02:11:04,719 --> 02:11:06,990
equations of fluid dynamics from
molecular dynamics that derivation has

6788
02:11:06,990 --> 02:11:07,000
molecular dynamics that derivation has
 

6789
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,830
molecular dynamics that derivation has
never been done MH there is no rigorous

6790
02:11:09,830 --> 02:11:09,840
never been done MH there is no rigorous
 

6791
02:11:09,840 --> 02:11:12,350
never been done MH there is no rigorous
version of that derivation so so because

6792
02:11:12,350 --> 02:11:12,360
version of that derivation so so because
 

6793
02:11:12,360 --> 02:11:14,109
version of that derivation so so because
you can't do the limits yeah because you

6794
02:11:14,109 --> 02:11:14,119
you can't do the limits yeah because you
 

6795
02:11:14,119 --> 02:11:16,549
you can't do the limits yeah because you
can't do the limits um but so the limits

6796
02:11:16,549 --> 02:11:16,559
can't do the limits um but so the limits
 

6797
02:11:16,559 --> 02:11:18,549
can't do the limits um but so the limits
allow you to try to describe something

6798
02:11:18,549 --> 02:11:18,559
allow you to try to describe something
 

6799
02:11:18,559 --> 02:11:20,870
allow you to try to describe something
general about the system and very very

6800
02:11:20,870 --> 02:11:20,880
general about the system and very very
 

6801
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:22,270
general about the system and very very
particular the kinds of limits that you

6802
02:11:22,270 --> 02:11:22,280
particular the kinds of limits that you
 

6803
02:11:22,280 --> 02:11:24,149
particular the kinds of limits that you
need to take with these very right and

6804
02:11:24,149 --> 02:11:24,159
need to take with these very right and
 

6805
02:11:24,159 --> 02:11:26,069
need to take with these very right and
and the limits will definitely work the

6806
02:11:26,069 --> 02:11:26,079
and the limits will definitely work the
 

6807
02:11:26,079 --> 02:11:27,750
and the limits will definitely work the
way we think they work and we can do all

6808
02:11:27,750 --> 02:11:27,760
way we think they work and we can do all
 

6809
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:29,910
way we think they work and we can do all
kinds of computer exp hard deration yeah

6810
02:11:29,910 --> 02:11:29,920
kinds of computer exp hard deration yeah
 

6811
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:31,750
kinds of computer exp hard deration yeah
it's just it's just the mathematical

6812
02:11:31,750 --> 02:11:31,760
it's just it's just the mathematical
 

6813
02:11:31,760 --> 02:11:34,310
it's just it's just the mathematical
structure kind of in you know ends up

6814
02:11:34,310 --> 02:11:34,320
structure kind of in you know ends up
 

6815
02:11:34,320 --> 02:11:35,990
structure kind of in you know ends up
running right into computational

6816
02:11:35,990 --> 02:11:36,000
running right into computational
 

6817
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:37,950
running right into computational
reducibility and you end up with a bunch

6818
02:11:37,950 --> 02:11:37,960
reducibility and you end up with a bunch
 

6819
02:11:37,960 --> 02:11:40,030
reducibility and you end up with a bunch
of a bunch of difficulty there but

6820
02:11:40,030 --> 02:11:40,040
of a bunch of difficulty there but
 

6821
02:11:40,040 --> 02:11:41,750
of a bunch of difficulty there but
here's the way that we're getting really

6822
02:11:41,750 --> 02:11:41,760
here's the way that we're getting really
 

6823
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:43,189
here's the way that we're getting really
confident that we know completely what

6824
02:11:43,189 --> 02:11:43,199
confident that we know completely what
 

6825
02:11:43,199 --> 02:11:45,589
confident that we know completely what
we're talking about which is when people

6826
02:11:45,589 --> 02:11:45,599
we're talking about which is when people
 

6827
02:11:45,599 --> 02:11:47,790
we're talking about which is when people
study things like black hole mergers

6828
02:11:47,790 --> 02:11:47,800
study things like black hole mergers
 

6829
02:11:47,800 --> 02:11:50,109
study things like black hole mergers
using Einstein's equations what do they

6830
02:11:50,109 --> 02:11:50,119
using Einstein's equations what do they
 

6831
02:11:50,119 --> 02:11:51,709
using Einstein's equations what do they
actually do well they actually use

6832
02:11:51,709 --> 02:11:51,719
actually do well they actually use
 

6833
02:11:51,719 --> 02:11:53,629
actually do well they actually use
Mathematica a whole bunch to analyze the

6834
02:11:53,629 --> 02:11:53,639
Mathematica a whole bunch to analyze the
 

6835
02:11:53,639 --> 02:11:55,790
Mathematica a whole bunch to analyze the
equations and so on but in the end they

6836
02:11:55,790 --> 02:11:55,800
equations and so on but in the end they
 

6837
02:11:55,800 --> 02:11:58,430
equations and so on but in the end they
do numerical relativity which means they

6838
02:11:58,430 --> 02:11:58,440
do numerical relativity which means they
 

6839
02:11:58,440 --> 02:12:01,350
do numerical relativity which means they
take these nice mathematical equations

6840
02:12:01,350 --> 02:12:01,360
take these nice mathematical equations
 

6841
02:12:01,360 --> 02:12:02,750
take these nice mathematical equations
and they break them down so that they

6842
02:12:02,750 --> 02:12:02,760
and they break them down so that they
 

6843
02:12:02,760 --> 02:12:04,549
and they break them down so that they
can run them on a computer and they

6844
02:12:04,549 --> 02:12:04,559
can run them on a computer and they
 

6845
02:12:04,559 --> 02:12:06,109
can run them on a computer and they
break them down into something which is

6846
02:12:06,109 --> 02:12:06,119
break them down into something which is
 

6847
02:12:06,119 --> 02:12:07,709
break them down into something which is
actually a discrete approximation to

6848
02:12:07,709 --> 02:12:07,719
actually a discrete approximation to
 

6849
02:12:07,719 --> 02:12:09,629
actually a discrete approximation to
these equations then they run them on a

6850
02:12:09,629 --> 02:12:09,639
these equations then they run them on a
 

6851
02:12:09,639 --> 02:12:11,790
these equations then they run them on a
computer they get results then you look

6852
02:12:11,790 --> 02:12:11,800
computer they get results then you look
 

6853
02:12:11,800 --> 02:12:13,030
computer they get results then you look
at the gravitational waves and you see

6854
02:12:13,030 --> 02:12:13,040
at the gravitational waves and you see
 

6855
02:12:13,040 --> 02:12:15,589
at the gravitational waves and you see
if they match okay turns out that our

6856
02:12:15,589 --> 02:12:15,599
if they match okay turns out that our
 

6857
02:12:15,599 --> 02:12:18,350
if they match okay turns out that our
model gives you a direct way to do

6858
02:12:18,350 --> 02:12:18,360
model gives you a direct way to do
 

6859
02:12:18,360 --> 02:12:20,270
model gives you a direct way to do
numerical relativity so in other words

6860
02:12:20,270 --> 02:12:20,280
numerical relativity so in other words
 

6861
02:12:20,280 --> 02:12:21,950
numerical relativity so in other words
instead of saying you start from these

6862
02:12:21,950 --> 02:12:21,960
instead of saying you start from these
 

6863
02:12:21,960 --> 02:12:23,910
instead of saying you start from these
Continuum equations from Einstein you

6864
02:12:23,910 --> 02:12:23,920
Continuum equations from Einstein you
 

6865
02:12:23,920 --> 02:12:25,470
Continuum equations from Einstein you
break them down into these discrete

6866
02:12:25,470 --> 02:12:25,480
break them down into these discrete
 

6867
02:12:25,480 --> 02:12:27,510
break them down into these discrete
things you run them on a computer you

6868
02:12:27,510 --> 02:12:27,520
things you run them on a computer you
 

6869
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:28,790
things you run them on a computer you
say we're doing it the other way around

6870
02:12:28,790 --> 02:12:28,800
say we're doing it the other way around
 

6871
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:30,270
say we're doing it the other way around
we're starting from these discrete

6872
02:12:30,270 --> 02:12:30,280
we're starting from these discrete
 

6873
02:12:30,280 --> 02:12:31,790
we're starting from these discrete
things that come from our model and

6874
02:12:31,790 --> 02:12:31,800
things that come from our model and
 

6875
02:12:31,800 --> 02:12:33,189
things that come from our model and
we're just running big versions of them

6876
02:12:33,189 --> 02:12:33,199
we're just running big versions of them
 

6877
02:12:33,199 --> 02:12:36,350
we're just running big versions of them
on the computer and uh you know what

6878
02:12:36,350 --> 02:12:36,360
on the computer and uh you know what
 

6879
02:12:36,360 --> 02:12:38,270
on the computer and uh you know what
we're saying is and this is this is how

6880
02:12:38,270 --> 02:12:38,280
we're saying is and this is this is how
 

6881
02:12:38,280 --> 02:12:41,229
we're saying is and this is this is how
things will work so what I'm the way I'm

6882
02:12:41,229 --> 02:12:41,239
things will work so what I'm the way I'm
 

6883
02:12:41,239 --> 02:12:43,589
things will work so what I'm the way I'm
calling this is is proof by compilation

6884
02:12:43,589 --> 02:12:43,599
calling this is is proof by compilation
 

6885
02:12:43,599 --> 02:12:46,149
calling this is is proof by compilation
so to speak Pro by that is in other

6886
02:12:46,149 --> 02:12:46,159
so to speak Pro by that is in other
 

6887
02:12:46,159 --> 02:12:48,470
so to speak Pro by that is in other
words you're you're taking um something

6888
02:12:48,470 --> 02:12:48,480
words you're you're taking um something
 

6889
02:12:48,480 --> 02:12:50,149
words you're you're taking um something
where you know we've got this

6890
02:12:50,149 --> 02:12:50,159
where you know we've got this
 

6891
02:12:50,159 --> 02:12:52,669
where you know we've got this
description of a black hole system and

6892
02:12:52,669 --> 02:12:52,679
description of a black hole system and
 

6893
02:12:52,679 --> 02:12:54,549
description of a black hole system and
what we're doing is we're we're showing

6894
02:12:54,549 --> 02:12:54,559
what we're doing is we're we're showing
 

6895
02:12:54,559 --> 02:12:57,069
what we're doing is we're we're showing
that the you know what we get by just

6896
02:12:57,069 --> 02:12:57,079
that the you know what we get by just
 

6897
02:12:57,079 --> 02:13:00,030
that the you know what we get by just
running our model agrees with what you

6898
02:13:00,030 --> 02:13:00,040
running our model agrees with what you
 

6899
02:13:00,040 --> 02:13:02,709
running our model agrees with what you
would get by doing the computation from

6900
02:13:02,709 --> 02:13:02,719
would get by doing the computation from
 

6901
02:13:02,719 --> 02:13:05,069
would get by doing the computation from
the Einstein equations as a small

6902
02:13:05,069 --> 02:13:05,079
the Einstein equations as a small
 

6903
02:13:05,079 --> 02:13:08,350
the Einstein equations as a small
tangent or actually a very big tangent

6904
02:13:08,350 --> 02:13:08,360
tangent or actually a very big tangent
 

6905
02:13:08,360 --> 02:13:10,189
tangent or actually a very big tangent
but

6906
02:13:10,189 --> 02:13:10,199
but
 

6907
02:13:10,199 --> 02:13:14,189
but
uh proof by compilation is a beautiful

6908
02:13:14,189 --> 02:13:14,199
uh proof by compilation is a beautiful
 

6909
02:13:14,199 --> 02:13:18,229
uh proof by compilation is a beautiful
Concept in a sense the way of doing

6910
02:13:18,229 --> 02:13:18,239
Concept in a sense the way of doing
 

6911
02:13:18,239 --> 02:13:21,430
Concept in a sense the way of doing
physics with this model

6912
02:13:21,430 --> 02:13:21,440
physics with this model
 

6913
02:13:21,440 --> 02:13:26,270
physics with this model
is by running it or compiling it and

6914
02:13:26,270 --> 02:13:26,280
is by running it or compiling it and
 

6915
02:13:26,280 --> 02:13:29,669
is by running it or compiling it and
some level yes it have you thought about

6916
02:13:29,669 --> 02:13:29,679
some level yes it have you thought about
 

6917
02:13:29,679 --> 02:13:32,030
some level yes it have you thought about
and these things can be very large is

6918
02:13:32,030 --> 02:13:32,040
and these things can be very large is
 

6919
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:36,189
and these things can be very large is
there totally new possibilities of

6920
02:13:36,189 --> 02:13:36,199
there totally new possibilities of
 

6921
02:13:36,199 --> 02:13:38,910
there totally new possibilities of
computing hardware and Computing

6922
02:13:38,910 --> 02:13:38,920
computing hardware and Computing
 

6923
02:13:38,920 --> 02:13:41,270
computing hardware and Computing
software which allows you to perform

this kind of compilation well algorithms

6926
02:13:44,350 --> 02:13:44,360
this kind of compilation well algorithms
 

6927
02:13:44,360 --> 02:13:47,870
this kind of compilation well algorithms
software Hardware so so first comment is

6928
02:13:47,870 --> 02:13:47,880
software Hardware so so first comment is
 

6929
02:13:47,880 --> 02:13:51,069
software Hardware so so first comment is
these models seem to give one a lot of

6930
02:13:51,069 --> 02:13:51,079
these models seem to give one a lot of
 

6931
02:13:51,079 --> 02:13:53,470
these models seem to give one a lot of
inition about distributed computing a

6932
02:13:53,470 --> 02:13:53,480
inition about distributed computing a
 

6933
02:13:53,480 --> 02:13:55,270
inition about distributed computing a
lot of different intuition about how to

6934
02:13:55,270 --> 02:13:55,280
lot of different intuition about how to
 

6935
02:13:55,280 --> 02:13:58,069
lot of different intuition about how to
think about parallel computation and

6936
02:13:58,069 --> 02:13:58,079
think about parallel computation and
 

6937
02:13:58,079 --> 02:13:59,430
think about parallel computation and
that particularly comes from the quantum

6938
02:13:59,430 --> 02:13:59,440
that particularly comes from the quantum
 

6939
02:13:59,440 --> 02:14:01,069
that particularly comes from the quantum
mechanic side of things which we didn't

6940
02:14:01,069 --> 02:14:01,079
mechanic side of things which we didn't
 

6941
02:14:01,079 --> 02:14:04,149
mechanic side of things which we didn't
talk about much yet but uh the question

6942
02:14:04,149 --> 02:14:04,159
talk about much yet but uh the question
 

6943
02:14:04,159 --> 02:14:06,950
talk about much yet but uh the question
of what you know given our current

6944
02:14:06,950 --> 02:14:06,960
of what you know given our current
 

6945
02:14:06,960 --> 02:14:08,350
of what you know given our current
computer hardware how can we most

6946
02:14:08,350 --> 02:14:08,360
computer hardware how can we most
 

6947
02:14:08,360 --> 02:14:10,430
computer hardware how can we most
efficiently simulate things yeah that's

6948
02:14:10,430 --> 02:14:10,440
efficiently simulate things yeah that's
 

6949
02:14:10,440 --> 02:14:12,350
efficiently simulate things yeah that's
actually partly a story of the model

6950
02:14:12,350 --> 02:14:12,360
actually partly a story of the model
 

6951
02:14:12,360 --> 02:14:14,510
actually partly a story of the model
itself because the model itself has deep

6952
02:14:14,510 --> 02:14:14,520
itself because the model itself has deep
 

6953
02:14:14,520 --> 02:14:16,709
itself because the model itself has deep
parallelism in it yes the ways that

6954
02:14:16,709 --> 02:14:16,719
parallelism in it yes the ways that
 

6955
02:14:16,719 --> 02:14:18,709
parallelism in it yes the ways that
we're simulating it we're just starting

6956
02:14:18,709 --> 02:14:18,719
we're simulating it we're just starting
 

6957
02:14:18,719 --> 02:14:21,109
we're simulating it we're just starting
to be able to use that deep parallelism

6958
02:14:21,109 --> 02:14:21,119
to be able to use that deep parallelism
 

6959
02:14:21,119 --> 02:14:22,709
to be able to use that deep parallelism
to be able to be more efficient in the

6960
02:14:22,709 --> 02:14:22,719
to be able to be more efficient in the
 

6961
02:14:22,719 --> 02:14:25,830
to be able to be more efficient in the
way that we simulate things but in fact

6962
02:14:25,830 --> 02:14:25,840
way that we simulate things but in fact
 

6963
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:28,270
way that we simulate things but in fact
the structure of the model itself allows

6964
02:14:28,270 --> 02:14:28,280
the structure of the model itself allows
 

6965
02:14:28,280 --> 02:14:30,189
the structure of the model itself allows
us to think about parallel computation

6966
02:14:30,189 --> 02:14:30,199
us to think about parallel computation
 

6967
02:14:30,199 --> 02:14:32,790
us to think about parallel computation
in different ways and one of my

6968
02:14:32,790 --> 02:14:32,800
in different ways and one of my
 

6969
02:14:32,800 --> 02:14:35,189
in different ways and one of my
realizations is that you know so it's

6970
02:14:35,189 --> 02:14:35,199
realizations is that you know so it's
 

6971
02:14:35,199 --> 02:14:37,229
realizations is that you know so it's
very hard to get in your brain how you

6972
02:14:37,229 --> 02:14:37,239
very hard to get in your brain how you
 

6973
02:14:37,239 --> 02:14:38,549
very hard to get in your brain how you
deal with parallel computation and

6974
02:14:38,549 --> 02:14:38,559
deal with parallel computation and
 

6975
02:14:38,559 --> 02:14:40,390
deal with parallel computation and
you're always worrying about you know if

6976
02:14:40,390 --> 02:14:40,400
you're always worrying about you know if
 

6977
02:14:40,400 --> 02:14:41,870
you're always worrying about you know if
multiple things can happen at different

6978
02:14:41,870 --> 02:14:41,880
multiple things can happen at different
 

6979
02:14:41,880 --> 02:14:43,109
multiple things can happen at different
on different computers at different

6980
02:14:43,109 --> 02:14:43,119
on different computers at different
 

6981
02:14:43,119 --> 02:14:45,149
on different computers at different
times oh what happens if this thing

6982
02:14:45,149 --> 02:14:45,159
times oh what happens if this thing
 

6983
02:14:45,159 --> 02:14:46,950
times oh what happens if this thing
happens before that thing and we've

6984
02:14:46,950 --> 02:14:46,960
happens before that thing and we've
 

6985
02:14:46,960 --> 02:14:48,390
happens before that thing and we've
really got you know we have these race

6986
02:14:48,390 --> 02:14:48,400
really got you know we have these race
 

6987
02:14:48,400 --> 02:14:49,830
really got you know we have these race
conditions where something can race to

6988
02:14:49,830 --> 02:14:49,840
conditions where something can race to
 

6989
02:14:49,840 --> 02:14:51,990
conditions where something can race to
get to the answer for another thing and

6990
02:14:51,990 --> 02:14:52,000
get to the answer for another thing and
 

6991
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:53,870
get to the answer for another thing and
you get all tangled up because you don't

6992
02:14:53,870 --> 02:14:53,880
you get all tangled up because you don't
 

6993
02:14:53,880 --> 02:14:55,069
you get all tangled up because you don't
know which thing is going to come in

6994
02:14:55,069 --> 02:14:55,079
know which thing is going to come in
 

6995
02:14:55,079 --> 02:14:57,310
know which thing is going to come in
first and usually when you do parallel

6996
02:14:57,310 --> 02:14:57,320
first and usually when you do parallel
 

6997
02:14:57,320 --> 02:14:59,470

lock things down to the point where
 

7001
02:15:01,280 --> 02:15:03,990
lock things down to the point where
you've you've had locks and mutexes and

you've you've had locks and mutexes and
 

7003

you've you've had locks and mutexes and
God knows what else where where you've

you've um you've arranged it so that

you've um you've arranged it so that
 

7007
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:10,750
you've um you've arranged it so that

there can only be one sequence of things
 

7009
02:15:10,760 --> 02:15:12,189
there can only be one sequence of things
that can happen so you don't have to

7010
02:15:12,189 --> 02:15:12,199
that can happen so you don't have to
 

7011
02:15:12,199 --> 02:15:13,350
that can happen so you don't have to
think about all the different kinds of

02:15:13,350 --> 02:15:13,360
think about all the different kinds of

02:15:13,360 --> 02:15:15,549
think about all the different kinds of

things happening in parallel and so I'm

02:15:31,199 --> 02:15:32,189

02:15:32,199 --> 02:15:34,669
I'm guessing they have buil-in

protection causal invariance is what
means that even though things happen in

02:15:40,910 --> 02:15:40,920
means that even though things happen in
 

7041
02:15:40,920 --> 02:15:42,350
means that even though things happen in
different orders it doesn't matter in

02:15:47,159 --> 02:15:51,030
struggle with concurrent programming
in in like Java uh with all all the

built up a strong mathematical framework

7054
02:15:57,549 --> 02:15:57,559
built up a strong mathematical framework
 

7055
02:15:57,559 --> 02:16:00,669
built up a strong mathematical framework
for causal invariance that's so

7056
02:16:00,669 --> 02:16:00,679
for causal invariance that's so
 

7057
02:16:00,679 --> 02:16:02,910
for causal invariance that's so
liberating and that that could be not

7058
02:16:02,910 --> 02:16:02,920
liberating and that that could be not
 

7059
02:16:02,920 --> 02:16:06,350
liberating and that that could be not
just liberating but really powerful for

7060
02:16:06,350 --> 02:16:06,360
just liberating but really powerful for
 

7061
02:16:06,360 --> 02:16:08,310
just liberating but really powerful for

massively distributed computation
 

7063
02:16:08,320 --> 02:16:10,390
massively distributed computation
absolutely no I mean you know what's

7064
02:16:10,390 --> 02:16:10,400
absolutely no I mean you know what's
 

7065
02:16:10,400 --> 02:16:12,950
absolutely no I mean you know what's
eventual consistency in in distributed

7066
02:16:12,950 --> 02:16:12,960
eventual consistency in in distributed
 

7067
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:14,990
eventual consistency in in distributed
databases is essentially the causal

7068
02:16:14,990 --> 02:16:15,000
databases is essentially the causal
 

7069
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:18,030
databases is essentially the causal
invariance idea yeah okay so that's but

7070
02:16:18,030 --> 02:16:18,040
invariance idea yeah okay so that's but
 

7071
02:16:18,040 --> 02:16:19,750
invariance idea yeah okay so that's but
but but have you thought

7072
02:16:19,750 --> 02:16:19,760
but but have you thought
 

7073
02:16:19,760 --> 02:16:23,430
but but have you thought
about uh you know we're like really

7074
02:16:23,430 --> 02:16:23,440
about uh you know we're like really
 

7075
02:16:23,440 --> 02:16:25,069
about uh you know we're like really

simulations yeah I mean I'm also

7078
02:16:27,149 --> 02:16:27,159
simulations yeah I mean I'm also
 

7079
02:16:27,159 --> 02:16:29,229

thinking about look the fact is you know

02:16:29,229 --> 02:16:29,239
thinking about look the fact is you know
 

7081
02:16:29,239 --> 02:16:30,910
thinking about look the fact is you know
I've spent much of my life as a language

7082
02:16:30,910 --> 02:16:30,920
I've spent much of my life as a language
 

7083
02:16:30,920 --> 02:16:33,070
I've spent much of my life as a language
designer right so I can't possibly not

02:16:33,070 --> 02:16:33,080
designer right so I can't possibly not
 

7085
02:16:33,080 --> 02:16:35,309

think about you know what does this mean

7086
02:16:35,309 --> 02:16:35,319
think about you know what does this mean
 

7087
02:16:35,319 --> 02:16:37,709
think about you know what does this mean
for Designing languages for parallel

7088
02:16:37,709 --> 02:16:37,719
for Designing languages for parallel
 

7089
02:16:37,719 --> 02:16:39,750
for Designing languages for parallel
computation in fact another thing that's

7090
02:16:39,750 --> 02:16:39,760
computation in fact another thing that's
 

7091
02:16:39,760 --> 02:16:42,190
computation in fact another thing that's
one of these you know I I'm always

7092
02:16:42,190 --> 02:16:42,200
one of these you know I I'm always
 

7093
02:16:42,200 --> 02:16:44,270
one of these you know I I'm always
embarrassed at how long it's taking me

7094
02:16:44,270 --> 02:16:44,280
embarrassed at how long it's taking me
 

7095
02:16:44,280 --> 02:16:46,429
embarrassed at how long it's taking me
to figure stuff out but you know back in

7096
02:16:46,429 --> 02:16:46,439
to figure stuff out but you know back in
 

7097
02:16:46,439 --> 02:16:49,030
to figure stuff out but you know back in
the 1980s I worked on trying to make up

7098
02:16:49,030 --> 02:16:49,040
the 1980s I worked on trying to make up
 

7099
02:16:49,040 --> 02:16:51,030
the 1980s I worked on trying to make up
languages for parallel computation I

7100
02:16:51,030 --> 02:16:51,040
languages for parallel computation I
 

7101
02:16:51,040 --> 02:16:53,110
languages for parallel computation I
thought about doing graph rewriting I

7102
02:16:53,110 --> 02:16:53,120
thought about doing graph rewriting I
 

7103
02:16:53,120 --> 02:16:54,190
thought about doing graph rewriting I
thought about doing these kinds of

7104
02:16:54,190 --> 02:16:54,200
thought about doing these kinds of
 

7105
02:16:54,200 --> 02:16:55,509
thought about doing these kinds of
things but I couldn't see how to

7106
02:16:55,509 --> 02:16:55,519
things but I couldn't see how to
 

7107
02:16:55,519 --> 02:16:57,270
things but I couldn't see how to
actually make the connections to

7108
02:16:57,270 --> 02:16:57,280
actually make the connections to
 

7109
02:16:57,280 --> 02:17:00,509
actually make the connections to
actually do something useful I think now

7110
02:17:00,509 --> 02:17:00,519
actually do something useful I think now
 

7111
02:17:00,519 --> 02:17:02,750
actually do something useful I think now
physics is kind of showing us how to

7112
02:17:02,750 --> 02:17:02,760
physics is kind of showing us how to
 

7113
02:17:02,760 --> 02:17:04,950
physics is kind of showing us how to
make those things useful and so my guess

7114
02:17:04,950 --> 02:17:04,960
make those things useful and so my guess
 

7115
02:17:04,960 --> 02:17:07,150
make those things useful and so my guess
is that in time we'll be talking about

7116
02:17:07,150 --> 02:17:07,160
is that in time we'll be talking about
 

7117
02:17:07,160 --> 02:17:08,870
is that in time we'll be talking about
you know we do parallel programming

7118
02:17:08,870 --> 02:17:08,880
you know we do parallel programming
 

7119
02:17:08,880 --> 02:17:10,509
you know we do parallel programming
we'll be talking about programming in a

7120
02:17:10,509 --> 02:17:10,519
we'll be talking about programming in a
 

7121
02:17:10,519 --> 02:17:12,790
we'll be talking about programming in a
certain reference frame just as we think

7122
02:17:12,790 --> 02:17:12,800
certain reference frame just as we think
 

7123
02:17:12,800 --> 02:17:14,190
certain reference frame just as we think
about thinking about physics in a

7124
02:17:14,190 --> 02:17:14,200
about thinking about physics in a
 

7125
02:17:14,200 --> 02:17:15,750
about thinking about physics in a
certain reference frame it's a certain

7126
02:17:15,750 --> 02:17:15,760
certain reference frame it's a certain
 

7127
02:17:15,760 --> 02:17:18,230
certain reference frame it's a certain
coordination of what's going on we say

7128
02:17:18,230 --> 02:17:18,240
coordination of what's going on we say
 

7129
02:17:18,240 --> 02:17:19,589
coordination of what's going on we say
we're going to program in this reference

7130
02:17:19,589 --> 02:17:19,599
we're going to program in this reference
 

7131
02:17:19,599 --> 02:17:20,990
we're going to program in this reference
frame oh let's change the reference

7132
02:17:20,990 --> 02:17:21,000
frame oh let's change the reference
 

7133
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,429
frame oh let's change the reference
frame to this reference frame and then

7134
02:17:23,429 --> 02:17:23,439
frame to this reference frame and then
 

7135
02:17:23,439 --> 02:17:25,190
frame to this reference frame and then
our program will seem different and

7136
02:17:25,190 --> 02:17:25,200
our program will seem different and
 

7137
02:17:25,200 --> 02:17:26,270
our program will seem different and
we'll have a different way to think

7138
02:17:26,270 --> 02:17:26,280
we'll have a different way to think
 

7139
02:17:26,280 --> 02:17:28,230
we'll have a different way to think
about it but it's still the same program

7140
02:17:28,230 --> 02:17:28,240
about it but it's still the same program
 

7141
02:17:28,240 --> 02:17:30,750
about it but it's still the same program
underneath so let me ask on this topic

7142
02:17:30,750 --> 02:17:30,760
underneath so let me ask on this topic
 

7143
02:17:30,760 --> 02:17:32,150
underneath so let me ask on this topic
because I put out that I'm talking to

7144
02:17:32,150 --> 02:17:32,160
because I put out that I'm talking to
 

7145
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:34,110
because I put out that I'm talking to
you I got way more questions that I can

7146
02:17:34,110 --> 02:17:34,120
you I got way more questions that I can
 

7147
02:17:34,120 --> 02:17:36,509
you I got way more questions that I can
deal with but what Pops to mind is a

7148
02:17:36,509 --> 02:17:36,519
deal with but what Pops to mind is a
 

7149
02:17:36,519 --> 02:17:38,150
deal with but what Pops to mind is a
question somebody asked on Reddit I

7150
02:17:38,150 --> 02:17:38,160
question somebody asked on Reddit I
 

7151
02:17:38,160 --> 02:17:43,070
question somebody asked on Reddit I
think is uh please ask uh Dr wlr uh what

7152
02:17:43,070 --> 02:17:43,080
think is uh please ask uh Dr wlr uh what
 

7153
02:17:43,080 --> 02:17:45,110
think is uh please ask uh Dr wlr uh what
are the specs of the computer running

7154
02:17:45,110 --> 02:17:45,120
are the specs of the computer running
 

7155
02:17:45,120 --> 02:17:48,709
are the specs of the computer running
the universe so we we're talking about

7156
02:17:48,709 --> 02:17:48,719
the universe so we we're talking about
 

7157
02:17:48,719 --> 02:17:51,830
the universe so we we're talking about
specs of hardware and software

7158
02:17:51,830 --> 02:17:51,840
specs of hardware and software
 

7159
02:17:51,840 --> 02:17:54,309
specs of hardware and software
simulations of a large scale thing what

7160
02:17:54,309 --> 02:17:54,319
simulations of a large scale thing what
 

7161
02:17:54,319 --> 02:17:58,309
simulations of a large scale thing what
about a scale that is comparative to

7162
02:17:58,309 --> 02:17:58,319
about a scale that is comparative to
 

7163
02:17:58,319 --> 02:18:00,270
about a scale that is comparative to
something that eventually leads to the

7164
02:18:00,270 --> 02:18:00,280
something that eventually leads to the
 

7165
02:18:00,280 --> 02:18:02,190
something that eventually leads to the
two of us talking and about right right

7166
02:18:02,190 --> 02:18:02,200
two of us talking and about right right
 

7167
02:18:02,200 --> 02:18:04,270
two of us talking and about right right
right so so actually I I did try to

7168
02:18:04,270 --> 02:18:04,280
right so so actually I I did try to
 

7169
02:18:04,280 --> 02:18:06,629
right so so actually I I did try to
estimate that and we have to go a couple

7170
02:18:06,629 --> 02:18:06,639
estimate that and we have to go a couple
 

7171
02:18:06,639 --> 02:18:08,190
estimate that and we have to go a couple
more stages before we can really get to

7172
02:18:08,190 --> 02:18:08,200
more stages before we can really get to
 

7173
02:18:08,200 --> 02:18:10,309
more stages before we can really get to
that answer because because we're we're

7174
02:18:10,309 --> 02:18:10,319
that answer because because we're we're
 

7175
02:18:10,319 --> 02:18:13,830
that answer because because we're we're
talking about um this this thing um you

7176
02:18:13,830 --> 02:18:13,840
talking about um this this thing um you
 

7177
02:18:13,840 --> 02:18:15,389
talking about um this this thing um you
know this is what happens when you when

7178
02:18:15,389 --> 02:18:15,399
know this is what happens when you when
 

7179
02:18:15,399 --> 02:18:17,030
know this is what happens when you when
you build these abstract systems and

7180
02:18:17,030 --> 02:18:17,040
you build these abstract systems and
 

7181
02:18:17,040 --> 02:18:19,750
you build these abstract systems and
you're trying to explain the universe

7182
02:18:19,750 --> 02:18:19,760
you're trying to explain the universe
 

7183
02:18:19,760 --> 02:18:22,270
you're trying to explain the universe
there quite a number of levels deep so

7184
02:18:22,270 --> 02:18:22,280
there quite a number of levels deep so
 

7185
02:18:22,280 --> 02:18:25,910
there quite a number of levels deep so
to speak um but uh the um you mean

7186
02:18:25,910 --> 02:18:25,920
to speak um but uh the um you mean
 

7187
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:27,389
to speak um but uh the um you mean
conceptually or like literally cuz

7188
02:18:27,389 --> 02:18:27,399
conceptually or like literally cuz
 

7189
02:18:27,399 --> 02:18:28,910
conceptually or like literally cuz
you're talking about small object and

7190
02:18:28,910 --> 02:18:28,920
you're talking about small object and
 

7191
02:18:28,920 --> 02:18:32,469
you're talking about small object and
there's 10 to the something number right

7192
02:18:32,469 --> 02:18:32,479
there's 10 to the something number right
 

7193
02:18:32,479 --> 02:18:35,230
there's 10 to the something number right
it's it's it it is conceptually deep and

7194
02:18:35,230 --> 02:18:35,240
it's it's it it is conceptually deep and
 

7195
02:18:35,240 --> 02:18:36,990
it's it's it it is conceptually deep and
one of the things that's happening sort

7196
02:18:36,990 --> 02:18:37,000
one of the things that's happening sort
 

7197
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,549
one of the things that's happening sort
of structurally in this project is you

7198
02:18:39,549 --> 02:18:39,559
of structurally in this project is you
 

7199
02:18:39,559 --> 02:18:40,990
of structurally in this project is you
know there were ideas there's another

7200
02:18:40,990 --> 02:18:41,000
know there were ideas there's another
 

7201
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:42,469
know there were ideas there's another
layer of ideas there's another layer of

7202
02:18:42,469 --> 02:18:42,479
layer of ideas there's another layer of
 

7203
02:18:42,479 --> 02:18:44,750
layer of ideas there's another layer of
ideas to get to the different things

7204
02:18:44,750 --> 02:18:44,760
ideas to get to the different things
 

7205
02:18:44,760 --> 02:18:47,389
ideas to get to the different things
that correspond to physics they're just

7206
02:18:47,389 --> 02:18:47,399
that correspond to physics they're just
 

7207
02:18:47,399 --> 02:18:50,270
that correspond to physics they're just
different layers of ideas and they are

7208
02:18:50,270 --> 02:18:50,280
different layers of ideas and they are
 

7209
02:18:50,280 --> 02:18:52,469
different layers of ideas and they are
um you know it's actually probably if

7210
02:18:52,469 --> 02:18:52,479
um you know it's actually probably if
 

7211
02:18:52,479 --> 02:18:54,110
um you know it's actually probably if
anything getting harder to explain this

7212
02:18:54,110 --> 02:18:54,120
anything getting harder to explain this
 

7213
02:18:54,120 --> 02:18:55,509
anything getting harder to explain this
project because I'm realizing that the

7214
02:18:55,509 --> 02:18:55,519
project because I'm realizing that the
 

7215
02:18:55,519 --> 02:18:57,709
project because I'm realizing that the
fraction of way through that I am so far

7216
02:18:57,709 --> 02:18:57,719
fraction of way through that I am so far
 

7217
02:18:57,719 --> 02:18:59,790
fraction of way through that I am so far
and explaining this to you is less than

7218
02:18:59,790 --> 02:18:59,800
and explaining this to you is less than
 

7219
02:18:59,800 --> 02:19:01,469
and explaining this to you is less than
than you know it might be because

7220
02:19:01,469 --> 02:19:01,479
than you know it might be because
 

7221
02:19:01,479 --> 02:19:03,469
than you know it might be because
because we know more now you know in the

7222
02:19:03,469 --> 02:19:03,479
because we know more now you know in the
 

7223
02:19:03,479 --> 02:19:05,190
because we know more now you know in the
every every week basically we know a

7224
02:19:05,190 --> 02:19:05,200
every every week basically we know a
 

7225
02:19:05,200 --> 02:19:07,150
every every week basically we know a
little bit more and like those are just

7226
02:19:07,150 --> 02:19:07,160
little bit more and like those are just
 

7227
02:19:07,160 --> 02:19:10,790
little bit more and like those are just
layers on the initial fundamental yes

7228
02:19:10,790 --> 02:19:10,800
layers on the initial fundamental yes
 

7229
02:19:10,800 --> 02:19:12,629
layers on the initial fundamental yes
structure the layers are you know you

7230
02:19:12,629 --> 02:19:12,639
structure the layers are you know you
 

7231
02:19:12,639 --> 02:19:14,549
structure the layers are you know you
you might be asking me you know how do

7232
02:19:14,549 --> 02:19:14,559
you might be asking me you know how do
 

7233
02:19:14,559 --> 02:19:17,110
you might be asking me you know how do
we get uh you know the difference

7234
02:19:17,110 --> 02:19:17,120
we get uh you know the difference
 

7235
02:19:17,120 --> 02:19:19,070
we get uh you know the difference
between Fons and bosons the difference

7236
02:19:19,070 --> 02:19:19,080
between Fons and bosons the difference
 

7237
02:19:19,080 --> 02:19:21,110
between Fons and bosons the difference
between particles that can be all in the

7238
02:19:21,110 --> 02:19:21,120
between particles that can be all in the
 

7239
02:19:21,120 --> 02:19:22,750
between particles that can be all in the
same state and particles that exclude

7240
02:19:22,750 --> 02:19:22,760
same state and particles that exclude
 

7241
02:19:22,760 --> 02:19:25,230
same state and particles that exclude
each other okay last 3 days we've kind

7242
02:19:25,230 --> 02:19:25,240
each other okay last 3 days we've kind
 

7243
02:19:25,240 --> 02:19:28,389
each other okay last 3 days we've kind
of figured that out okay but um and it's

7244
02:19:28,389 --> 02:19:28,399
of figured that out okay but um and it's
 

7245
02:19:28,399 --> 02:19:31,110
of figured that out okay but um and it's
very interesting it's very cool um and

7246
02:19:31,110 --> 02:19:31,120
very interesting it's very cool um and
 

7247
02:19:31,120 --> 02:19:33,349
very interesting it's very cool um and
it's very uh and those are some kind of

7248
02:19:33,349 --> 02:19:33,359
it's very uh and those are some kind of
 

7249
02:19:33,359 --> 02:19:36,230
it's very uh and those are some kind of
properties at a certain level layer of

7250
02:19:36,230 --> 02:19:36,240
properties at a certain level layer of
 

7251
02:19:36,240 --> 02:19:38,270
properties at a certain level layer of
abstraction on the hypog graph yes and

7252
02:19:38,270 --> 02:19:38,280
abstraction on the hypog graph yes and
 

7253
02:19:38,280 --> 02:19:39,870
abstraction on the hypog graph yes and
there's a and there's but the layers of

7254
02:19:39,870 --> 02:19:39,880
there's a and there's but the layers of
 

7255
02:19:39,880 --> 02:19:42,030
there's a and there's but the layers of
abstraction are kind of there

7256
02:19:42,030 --> 02:19:42,040
abstraction are kind of there
 

7257
02:19:42,040 --> 02:19:44,349
abstraction are kind of there
compounding stacking up so it's

7258
02:19:44,349 --> 02:19:44,359
compounding stacking up so it's
 

7259
02:19:44,359 --> 02:19:46,589
compounding stacking up so it's
difficult but but okay but this but the

7260
02:19:46,589 --> 02:19:46,599
difficult but but okay but this but the
 

7261
02:19:46,599 --> 02:19:48,549
difficult but but okay but this but the
specs nevertheless remain the same the

7262
02:19:48,549 --> 02:19:48,559
specs nevertheless remain the same the
 

7263
02:19:48,559 --> 02:19:50,230
specs nevertheless remain the same the
the specs underneath so I I have an

7264
02:19:50,230 --> 02:19:50,240
the specs underneath so I I have an
 

7265
02:19:50,240 --> 02:19:52,030
the specs underneath so I I have an
estimate so the question is what are the

7266
02:19:52,030 --> 02:19:52,040
estimate so the question is what are the
 

7267
02:19:52,040 --> 02:19:53,469
estimate so the question is what are the
units so we've got these different

7268
02:19:53,469 --> 02:19:53,479
units so we've got these different
 

7269
02:19:53,479 --> 02:19:56,270
units so we've got these different
fundamental constants about the world so

7270
02:19:56,270 --> 02:19:56,280
fundamental constants about the world so
 

7271
02:19:56,280 --> 02:19:58,070
fundamental constants about the world so
one of them is the speed of light which

7272
02:19:58,070 --> 02:19:58,080
one of them is the speed of light which
 

7273
02:19:58,080 --> 02:19:59,870
one of them is the speed of light which
is the so the thing that's always the

7274
02:19:59,870 --> 02:19:59,880
is the so the thing that's always the
 

7275
02:19:59,880 --> 02:20:01,630
is the so the thing that's always the
same in all these different ways of

7276
02:20:01,630 --> 02:20:01,640
same in all these different ways of
 

7277
02:20:01,640 --> 02:20:02,950
same in all these different ways of
thinking about the universe is the

7278
02:20:02,950 --> 02:20:02,960
thinking about the universe is the
 

7279
02:20:02,960 --> 02:20:05,429
thinking about the universe is the
notion of time because time is

7280
02:20:05,429 --> 02:20:05,439
notion of time because time is
 

7281
02:20:05,439 --> 02:20:07,349
notion of time because time is
computation and so there's an elementary

7282
02:20:07,349 --> 02:20:07,359
computation and so there's an elementary
 

7283
02:20:07,359 --> 02:20:10,630
computation and so there's an elementary
time which is sort of the the the amount

7284
02:20:10,630 --> 02:20:10,640
time which is sort of the the the amount
 

7285
02:20:10,640 --> 02:20:14,309
time which is sort of the the the amount
of time that we ascribe to elapsing in a

7286
02:20:14,309 --> 02:20:14,319
of time that we ascribe to elapsing in a
 

7287
02:20:14,319 --> 02:20:17,070
of time that we ascribe to elapsing in a
in a single computational step yeah okay

7288
02:20:17,070 --> 02:20:17,080
in a single computational step yeah okay
 

7289
02:20:17,080 --> 02:20:18,790
in a single computational step yeah okay
so that's the elementary time so then

7290
02:20:18,790 --> 02:20:18,800
so that's the elementary time so then
 

7291
02:20:18,800 --> 02:20:20,870
so that's the elementary time so then
there's an El parameter or whatever that

7292
02:20:20,870 --> 02:20:20,880
there's an El parameter or whatever that
 

7293
02:20:20,880 --> 02:20:22,950
there's an El parameter or whatever that
it's a constant it's whatever we Define

7294
02:20:22,950 --> 02:20:22,960
it's a constant it's whatever we Define
 

7295
02:20:22,960 --> 02:20:24,990
it's a constant it's whatever we Define
it to be because I mean we we don't you

7296
02:20:24,990 --> 02:20:25,000
it to be because I mean we we don't you
 

7297
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,230
it to be because I mean we we don't you
know it's all relative right it doesn't

7298
02:20:27,230 --> 02:20:27,240
know it's all relative right it doesn't
 

7299
02:20:27,240 --> 02:20:28,469
know it's all relative right it doesn't
matter it doesn't matter what it is

7300
02:20:28,469 --> 02:20:28,479
matter it doesn't matter what it is
 

7301
02:20:28,479 --> 02:20:30,389
matter it doesn't matter what it is
because we could be it could be slow

7302
02:20:30,389 --> 02:20:30,399
because we could be it could be slow
 

7303
02:20:30,399 --> 02:20:33,190
because we could be it could be slow
it's just a number which which we use to

7304
02:20:33,190 --> 02:20:33,200
it's just a number which which we use to
 

7305
02:20:33,200 --> 02:20:35,030
it's just a number which which we use to
convert that to Second so to speak

7306
02:20:35,030 --> 02:20:35,040
convert that to Second so to speak
 

7307
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:37,309
convert that to Second so to speak
because we are experiencing things and

7308
02:20:37,309 --> 02:20:37,319
because we are experiencing things and
 

7309
02:20:37,319 --> 02:20:39,590
because we are experiencing things and
we say this amount of time has elapsed

7310
02:20:39,590 --> 02:20:39,600
we say this amount of time has elapsed
 

7311
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:41,349
we say this amount of time has elapsed
so to speak but we're within this thing

7312
02:20:41,349 --> 02:20:41,359
so to speak but we're within this thing
 

7313
02:20:41,359 --> 02:20:43,710
so to speak but we're within this thing
so AB it doesn't it doesn't matter right

7314
02:20:43,710 --> 02:20:43,720
so AB it doesn't it doesn't matter right
 

7315
02:20:43,720 --> 02:20:46,349
so AB it doesn't it doesn't matter right
but what does matter is the ratio what

7316
02:20:46,349 --> 02:20:46,359
but what does matter is the ratio what
 

7317
02:20:46,359 --> 02:20:48,790
but what does matter is the ratio what
we can uh the ratio of the spatial

7318
02:20:48,790 --> 02:20:48,800
we can uh the ratio of the spatial
 

7319
02:20:48,800 --> 02:20:52,750
we can uh the ratio of the spatial
distance and this hypergraph to this uh

7320
02:20:52,750 --> 02:20:52,760
distance and this hypergraph to this uh
 

7321
02:20:52,760 --> 02:20:54,950
distance and this hypergraph to this uh
to this moment of time again that's an

7322
02:20:54,950 --> 02:20:54,960
to this moment of time again that's an
 

7323
02:20:54,960 --> 02:20:56,750
to this moment of time again that's an
arbitrary thing but we measure that in

7324
02:20:56,750 --> 02:20:56,760
arbitrary thing but we measure that in
 

7325
02:20:56,760 --> 02:20:59,550
arbitrary thing but we measure that in
me/ second for example and that ratio is

7326
02:20:59,550 --> 02:20:59,560
me/ second for example and that ratio is
 

7327
02:20:59,560 --> 02:21:01,630
me/ second for example and that ratio is
the speed of light so the ratio of the

7328
02:21:01,630 --> 02:21:01,640
the speed of light so the ratio of the
 

7329
02:21:01,640 --> 02:21:03,950
the speed of light so the ratio of the
elementary distance to the elementary

7330
02:21:03,950 --> 02:21:03,960
elementary distance to the elementary
 

7331
02:21:03,960 --> 02:21:06,950
elementary distance to the elementary
time is the speed of light okay perfect

7332
02:21:06,950 --> 02:21:06,960
time is the speed of light okay perfect
 

7333
02:21:06,960 --> 02:21:09,070
time is the speed of light okay perfect
and so there's another there are two

7334
02:21:09,070 --> 02:21:09,080
and so there's another there are two
 

7335
02:21:09,080 --> 02:21:12,070
and so there's another there are two
other levels of this okay so there is a

7336
02:21:12,070 --> 02:21:12,080
other levels of this okay so there is a
 

7337
02:21:12,080 --> 02:21:14,190
other levels of this okay so there is a
thing which we can talk about uh which

7338
02:21:14,190 --> 02:21:14,200
thing which we can talk about uh which
 

7339
02:21:14,200 --> 02:21:16,710
thing which we can talk about uh which
is the maximum entanglement speed which

7340
02:21:16,710 --> 02:21:16,720
is the maximum entanglement speed which
 

7341
02:21:16,720 --> 02:21:19,230
is the maximum entanglement speed which
is a thing that happens at another level

7342
02:21:19,230 --> 02:21:19,240
is a thing that happens at another level
 

7343
02:21:19,240 --> 02:21:21,110
is a thing that happens at another level
in this whole sort of story of how these

7344
02:21:21,110 --> 02:21:21,120
in this whole sort of story of how these
 

7345
02:21:21,120 --> 02:21:23,349
in this whole sort of story of how these
things get constructed um that's a sort

7346
02:21:23,349 --> 02:21:23,359
things get constructed um that's a sort
 

7347
02:21:23,359 --> 02:21:25,429
things get constructed um that's a sort
of maximum speed in Quantum in the space

7348
02:21:25,429 --> 02:21:25,439
of maximum speed in Quantum in the space
 

7349
02:21:25,439 --> 02:21:27,790
of maximum speed in Quantum in the space
of quantum States just as the speed of

7350
02:21:27,790 --> 02:21:27,800
of quantum States just as the speed of
 

7351
02:21:27,800 --> 02:21:29,389
of quantum States just as the speed of
light is a maximum speed in physical

7352
02:21:29,389 --> 02:21:29,399
light is a maximum speed in physical
 

7353
02:21:29,399 --> 02:21:31,230
light is a maximum speed in physical
space this is a maximum speed in the

7354
02:21:31,230 --> 02:21:31,240
space this is a maximum speed in the
 

7355
02:21:31,240 --> 02:21:33,309
space this is a maximum speed in the
space of quantum States there's another

7356
02:21:33,309 --> 02:21:33,319
space of quantum States there's another
 

7357
02:21:33,319 --> 02:21:35,349
space of quantum States there's another
level which is associated with what we

7358
02:21:35,349 --> 02:21:35,359
level which is associated with what we
 

7359
02:21:35,359 --> 02:21:37,910
level which is associated with what we
call Ral space which is a another one of

7360
02:21:37,910 --> 02:21:37,920
call Ral space which is a another one of
 

7361
02:21:37,920 --> 02:21:40,510
call Ral space which is a another one of
these maximum speeds we get to this so

7362
02:21:40,510 --> 02:21:40,520
these maximum speeds we get to this so
 

7363
02:21:40,520 --> 02:21:42,389
these maximum speeds we get to this so
these are limitations on the system that

7364
02:21:42,389 --> 02:21:42,399
these are limitations on the system that
 

7365
02:21:42,399 --> 02:21:44,630
these are limitations on the system that
are able to capture the kind of physical

7366
02:21:44,630 --> 02:21:44,640
are able to capture the kind of physical
 

7367
02:21:44,640 --> 02:21:46,710
are able to capture the kind of physical
Universe which we live in the quantum

7368
02:21:46,710 --> 02:21:46,720
Universe which we live in the quantum
 

7369
02:21:46,720 --> 02:21:49,429
Universe which we live in the quantum
mechanic they are inevitable features of

02:21:52,760 --> 02:21:54,790

7374
02:21:54,790 --> 02:21:54,800

7375
02:21:54,800 --> 02:21:56,349

these speed constraints we knew about

7386
02:22:07,830 --> 02:22:07,840
these speed constraints we knew about
 

7387
02:22:07,840 --> 02:22:09,110
these speed constraints we knew about
the one for speed of light we didn't

7388
02:22:09,110 --> 02:22:09,120
the one for speed of light we didn't
 

7389
02:22:09,120 --> 02:22:10,309
the one for speed of light we didn't
know about the one for maximum

7390
02:22:10,309 --> 02:22:10,319
know about the one for maximum
 

7391
02:22:10,319 --> 02:22:12,070
know about the one for maximum
entanglement speed which is actually

7392
02:22:12,070 --> 02:22:12,080
entanglement speed which is actually
 

7393
02:22:12,080 --> 02:22:14,030
entanglement speed which is actually
something that is possibly measurable

7394
02:22:14,030 --> 02:22:14,040
something that is possibly measurable
 

7395
02:22:14,040 --> 02:22:15,910
something that is possibly measurable
particularly in black hole systems and

7396
02:22:15,910 --> 02:22:15,920
particularly in black hole systems and
 

7397
02:22:15,920 --> 02:22:18,510
particularly in black hole systems and
things like this anyway this is long

7398
02:22:18,510 --> 02:22:18,520
things like this anyway this is long
 

7399
02:22:18,520 --> 02:22:20,590
things like this anyway this is long
long story short you're asking what the

7400
02:22:20,590 --> 02:22:20,600
long story short you're asking what the
 

7401
02:22:20,600 --> 02:22:23,110
long story short you're asking what the
processing specs of the universe of the

7402
02:22:23,110 --> 02:22:23,120
processing specs of the universe of the
 

7403
02:22:23,120 --> 02:22:24,230
processing specs of the universe of the
of the sort of computation of the

7404
02:22:24,230 --> 02:22:24,240
of the sort of computation of the
 

7405
02:22:24,240 --> 02:22:26,030
of the sort of computation of the
universe there's a question of even what

7406
02:22:26,030 --> 02:22:26,040
universe there's a question of even what
 

7407
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:28,190
universe there's a question of even what
are the units of some of these

7408
02:22:28,190 --> 02:22:28,200
are the units of some of these
 

7409
02:22:28,200 --> 02:22:30,429
are the units of some of these
measurements okay so the units I'm using

7410
02:22:30,429 --> 02:22:30,439
measurements okay so the units I'm using
 

7411
02:22:30,439 --> 02:22:32,190
measurements okay so the units I'm using
are wol from language instructions per

7412
02:22:32,190 --> 02:22:32,200
are wol from language instructions per
 

7413
02:22:32,200 --> 02:22:34,590
are wol from language instructions per
second okay because you got to have some

7414
02:22:34,590 --> 02:22:34,600
second okay because you got to have some
 

7415
02:22:34,600 --> 02:22:36,230
second okay because you got to have some
you know what the quad computation are

7416
02:22:36,230 --> 02:22:36,240
you know what the quad computation are
 

7417
02:22:36,240 --> 02:22:37,710
you know what the quad computation are
you do it there got to be some kind of

7418
02:22:37,710 --> 02:22:37,720
you do it there got to be some kind of
 

7419
02:22:37,720 --> 02:22:39,790
you do it there got to be some kind of
frame of reference right right so and

7420
02:22:39,790 --> 02:22:39,800
frame of reference right right so and
 

7421
02:22:39,800 --> 02:22:42,030
frame of reference right right so and
because it turns out in the end there

7422
02:22:42,030 --> 02:22:42,040
because it turns out in the end there
 

7423
02:22:42,040 --> 02:22:44,150
because it turns out in the end there
will be there's sort of an arbitrariness

7424
02:22:44,150 --> 02:22:44,160
will be there's sort of an arbitrariness
 

7425
02:22:44,160 --> 02:22:46,070
will be there's sort of an arbitrariness
in the language that you use to describe

7426
02:22:46,070 --> 02:22:46,080
in the language that you use to describe
 

7427
02:22:46,080 --> 02:22:48,630
in the language that you use to describe
the universe so in those terms I think

7428
02:22:48,630 --> 02:22:48,640
the universe so in those terms I think
 

7429
02:22:48,640 --> 02:22:52,389
the universe so in those terms I think
it's like 10 the 500 or from language

7430
02:22:52,389 --> 02:22:52,399
it's like 10 the 500 or from language
 

7431
02:22:52,399 --> 02:22:55,030
it's like 10 the 500 or from language
operations per second I think is the um

7432
02:22:55,030 --> 02:22:55,040
operations per second I think is the um
 

7433
02:22:55,040 --> 02:22:57,389
operations per second I think is the um
I think it's of that order you know B

7434
02:22:57,389 --> 02:22:57,399
I think it's of that order you know B
 

7435
02:22:57,399 --> 02:22:59,309
I think it's of that order you know B
that's scale of computation what about

7436
02:22:59,309 --> 02:22:59,319
that's scale of computation what about
 

7437
02:22:59,319 --> 02:23:00,950
that's scale of computation what about
memory if there's an interesting thing

7438

to say about storage and memory well

7440
02:23:02,870 --> 02:23:02,880
to say about storage and memory well
 

7441
02:23:02,880 --> 02:23:04,070
to say about storage and memory well
there a question of how many sort of

7442
02:23:04,070 --> 02:23:04,080
there a question of how many sort of
 

7443
02:23:04,080 --> 02:23:06,950
there a question of how many sort of
atoms of space might there be you know

02:23:11,630 --> 02:23:11,640
how to estimate these numbers I mean
 

7449
02:23:11,640 --> 02:23:14,389
how to estimate these numbers I mean
this is this is based on some some I

this is this is based on some some I
 

7451
02:23:14,399 --> 02:23:16,150
this is this is based on some some I
would say somewhat rickety way of

7452
02:23:16,150 --> 02:23:16,160
would say somewhat rickety way of
 

7453
02:23:16,160 --> 02:23:18,510
would say somewhat rickety way of
estimating things uh you know when there

7454
02:23:18,510 --> 02:23:18,520
estimating things uh you know when there
 

7455
02:23:18,520 --> 02:23:20,190

02:23:20,190 --> 02:23:20,200
start to be able to be experiments done
 

7457
02:23:20,200 --> 02:23:21,990
start to be able to be experiments done
if lucky there will be experiments that

7458
02:23:21,990 --> 02:23:22,000
if lucky there will be experiments that
 

7459
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:23,349
if lucky there will be experiments that
can actually nail down some of these

02:23:23,349 --> 02:23:23,359
can actually nail down some of these
 

7461
02:23:23,359 --> 02:23:26,910

does the reducibility go right okay and

7476
02:23:45,269 --> 02:23:45,279
does the reducibility go right okay and
 

7477
02:23:45,279 --> 02:23:46,870
does the reducibility go right okay and
I keep on being surprised that it's a

7478
02:23:46,870 --> 02:23:46,880
I keep on being surprised that it's a
 

7479
02:23:46,880 --> 02:23:50,030
I keep on being surprised that it's a
lot deeper than I thought okay and so um

7480
02:23:50,030 --> 02:23:50,040
lot deeper than I thought okay and so um
 

7481
02:23:50,040 --> 02:23:52,349
lot deeper than I thought okay and so um
one of the the things is that that

7482
02:23:52,349 --> 02:23:52,359
one of the the things is that that
 

7483
02:23:52,359 --> 02:23:53,750
one of the the things is that that
there's a question of sort of how much

02:23:53,750 --> 02:23:53,760
there's a question of sort of how much
 

7485
02:23:53,760 --> 02:23:56,230
there's a question of sort of how much
of the whole of physics do we have to be

7486
02:23:56,230 --> 02:23:56,240
of the whole of physics do we have to be
 

7487
02:23:56,240 --> 02:23:58,590
of the whole of physics do we have to be
able to get in order to explain certain

able to get in order to explain certain
 

7489
02:23:58,600 --> 02:24:00,550

we have to know what an electron is
 

7495
02:24:05,800 --> 02:24:07,630

turns out I thought we did turns out we

7496
02:24:07,630 --> 02:24:07,640
turns out I thought we did turns out we
 

7497
02:24:07,640 --> 02:24:10,389
turns out I thought we did turns out we
don't I thought to know what energy is

02:24:48,110 --> 02:24:48,120
let's go there so we talked about
 

7533
02:24:48,120 --> 02:24:51,309
let's go there so we talked about
general relativity now

what uh what have you

7536
02:24:53,389 --> 02:24:53,399
what uh what have you
 

7537
02:24:53,399 --> 02:24:56,710
what uh what have you
found uh the story of quantum mechanics

7538
02:24:56,710 --> 02:24:56,720
found uh the story of quantum mechanics
 

7539
02:24:56,720 --> 02:24:59,309
found uh the story of quantum mechanics
right within and outside of the wol from

7540
02:24:59,309 --> 02:24:59,319
right within and outside of the wol from
 

7541
02:24:59,319 --> 02:25:02,230
right within and outside of the wol from
physics right so I mean the the the key

7542
02:25:02,230 --> 02:25:02,240
physics right so I mean the the the key
 

7543
02:25:02,240 --> 02:25:04,750
physics right so I mean the the the key
idea of quantum mechanics that sort of

7544
02:25:04,750 --> 02:25:04,760
idea of quantum mechanics that sort of
 

7545
02:25:04,760 --> 02:25:06,910
idea of quantum mechanics that sort of
the the the typical interpretation is

7546
02:25:06,910 --> 02:25:06,920
the the the typical interpretation is
 

7547
02:25:06,920 --> 02:25:09,150
the the the typical interpretation is
classical physics says a definite thing

7548

classical physics says a definite thing
 

7549
02:25:09,160 --> 02:25:11,429
classical physics says a definite thing
happens quantum physics says there's

7550
02:25:11,429 --> 02:25:11,439
happens quantum physics says there's
 

7551
02:25:11,439 --> 02:25:13,389
happens quantum physics says there's
this whole set of Paths of things that

7552
02:25:13,389 --> 02:25:13,399
this whole set of Paths of things that
 

7553
02:25:13,399 --> 02:25:16,110
this whole set of Paths of things that
might happen and we are just observing

02:25:16,110 --> 02:25:16,120
might happen and we are just observing
 

7555
02:25:16,120 --> 02:25:18,309
might happen and we are just observing
some overall probability of of how those

7556
02:25:18,309 --> 02:25:18,319
some overall probability of of how those
 

7557
02:25:18,319 --> 02:25:21,349
some overall probability of of how those
paths work okay so when you think about

7558
02:25:21,349 --> 02:25:21,359
paths work okay so when you think about
 

7559
02:25:21,359 --> 02:25:23,070
paths work okay so when you think about
our hypergraphs and all these little

7560
02:25:23,070 --> 02:25:23,080
our hypergraphs and all these little
 

7561
02:25:23,080 --> 02:25:25,309

there is a choice of several different
possible things that could happen so for

7586
02:25:55,750 --> 02:25:55,760
possible things that could happen so for
 

7587
02:25:55,760 --> 02:25:57,710
possible things that could happen so for
example you go this way go that way

7588
02:25:57,710 --> 02:25:57,720
example you go this way go that way
 

7589
02:25:57,720 --> 02:25:59,630
example you go this way go that way
those are two different edges in the

7590
02:25:59,630 --> 02:25:59,640
those are two different edges in the
 

7591
02:25:59,640 --> 02:26:01,630
those are two different edges in the
multi-way graph and you're building up

7592
02:26:01,630 --> 02:26:01,640
multi-way graph and you're building up
 

7593
02:26:01,640 --> 02:26:03,070
multi-way graph and you're building up
the set of possibilities so actually

7594
02:26:03,070 --> 02:26:03,080
the set of possibilities so actually
 

7595
02:26:03,080 --> 02:26:04,910
the set of possibilities so actually
like for example I just made the one the

7596
02:26:04,910 --> 02:26:04,920
like for example I just made the one the
 

7597
02:26:04,920 --> 02:26:07,550
like for example I just made the one the
multi-way graph for Tic Tac Toe okay so

7598
02:26:07,550 --> 02:26:07,560
multi-way graph for Tic Tac Toe okay so
 

7599
02:26:07,560 --> 02:26:10,429
multi-way graph for Tic Tac Toe okay so
Tic Tac Toe you start off with some some

7600
02:26:10,429 --> 02:26:10,439
Tic Tac Toe you start off with some some
 

7601
02:26:10,439 --> 02:26:11,830
Tic Tac Toe you start off with some some
board that you know is everything is

7602
02:26:11,830 --> 02:26:11,840
board that you know is everything is
 

7603
02:26:11,840 --> 02:26:13,990
board that you know is everything is
blank and then somebody can put down a

7604
02:26:13,990 --> 02:26:14,000
blank and then somebody can put down a
 

7605
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,990
blank and then somebody can put down a
an X somewhere an O somewhere and then

7606
02:26:16,990 --> 02:26:17,000
an X somewhere an O somewhere and then
 

7607
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:18,269
an X somewhere an O somewhere and then
there are different possibilities at

7608
02:26:18,269 --> 02:26:18,279
there are different possibilities at
 

7609
02:26:18,279 --> 02:26:19,349
there are different possibilities at
each stage there are different

7610
02:26:19,349 --> 02:26:19,359
each stage there are different
 

7611
02:26:19,359 --> 02:26:21,230
each stage there are different
possibilities and so you build up this

7612
02:26:21,230 --> 02:26:21,240
possibilities and so you build up this
 

7613
02:26:21,240 --> 02:26:23,190
possibilities and so you build up this
multi-way graph of all those

7614
02:26:23,190 --> 02:26:23,200
multi-way graph of all those
 

7615
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:25,070
multi-way graph of all those
possibilities now notice that even in Te

7616
02:26:25,070 --> 02:26:25,080
possibilities now notice that even in Te
 

7617
02:26:25,080 --> 02:26:27,510
possibilities now notice that even in Te
tactoe you have the feature that there

7618
02:26:27,510 --> 02:26:27,520
tactoe you have the feature that there
 

7619
02:26:27,520 --> 02:26:29,750
tactoe you have the feature that there
can be something where you have two

7620
02:26:29,750 --> 02:26:29,760
can be something where you have two
 

7621
02:26:29,760 --> 02:26:31,630
can be something where you have two
different things that happen and then

7622
02:26:31,630 --> 02:26:31,640
different things that happen and then
 

7623
02:26:31,640 --> 02:26:34,030
different things that happen and then
those branches merge because you end up

7624
02:26:34,030 --> 02:26:34,040
those branches merge because you end up
 

7625
02:26:34,040 --> 02:26:35,910
those branches merge because you end up
with the same shape of you know the same

7626
02:26:35,910 --> 02:26:35,920
with the same shape of you know the same
 

7627
02:26:35,920 --> 02:26:37,750
with the same shape of you know the same
configuration of the board even though

7628
02:26:37,750 --> 02:26:37,760
configuration of the board even though
 

7629
02:26:37,760 --> 02:26:40,870
configuration of the board even though
you got there in two different ways so

7630
02:26:40,870 --> 02:26:40,880
you got there in two different ways so
 

7631
02:26:40,880 --> 02:26:42,030
you got there in two different ways so
what the the thing that's sort of an

7632
02:26:42,030 --> 02:26:42,040
what the the thing that's sort of an
 

7633
02:26:42,040 --> 02:26:44,990
what the the thing that's sort of an
inevitable feature of our models is that

7634
02:26:44,990 --> 02:26:45,000
inevitable feature of our models is that
 

7635
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,389
inevitable feature of our models is that
just like quantum mechanics suggests

7636
02:26:47,389 --> 02:26:47,399
just like quantum mechanics suggests
 

7637
02:26:47,399 --> 02:26:49,309
just like quantum mechanics suggests
definite things don't happen instead you

7638
02:26:49,309 --> 02:26:49,319
definite things don't happen instead you
 

7639
02:26:49,319 --> 02:26:51,110
definite things don't happen instead you
get this whole multi way graph of all

7640
02:26:51,110 --> 02:26:51,120
get this whole multi way graph of all
 

7641
02:26:51,120 --> 02:26:51,910
get this whole multi way graph of all
these

7642
02:26:51,910 --> 02:26:51,920
these
 

7643
02:26:51,920 --> 02:26:54,309
these
possibilities okay so then the question

7644
02:26:54,309 --> 02:26:54,319
possibilities okay so then the question
 

7645
02:26:54,319 --> 02:26:56,710
possibilities okay so then the question
is so that okay so that's sort of a a

7646
02:26:56,710 --> 02:26:56,720
is so that okay so that's sort of a a
 

7647
02:26:56,720 --> 02:26:59,230
is so that okay so that's sort of a a
picture of what's going on now you say

7648
02:26:59,230 --> 02:26:59,240
picture of what's going on now you say
 

7649
02:26:59,240 --> 02:27:00,870
picture of what's going on now you say
okay well quantum mechanics has all

7650
02:27:00,870 --> 02:27:00,880
okay well quantum mechanics has all
 

7651
02:27:00,880 --> 02:27:03,030
okay well quantum mechanics has all
these features of uh you know all this

7652
02:27:03,030 --> 02:27:03,040
these features of uh you know all this
 

7653
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:05,150
these features of uh you know all this
mathematical structure and so on how do

7654
02:27:05,150 --> 02:27:05,160
mathematical structure and so on how do
 

7655
02:27:05,160 --> 02:27:07,590
mathematical structure and so on how do
you get that mathematical structure okay

7656
02:27:07,590 --> 02:27:07,600
you get that mathematical structure okay
 

7657
02:27:07,600 --> 02:27:09,429
you get that mathematical structure okay
couple of couple of things to say so

7658
02:27:09,429 --> 02:27:09,439
couple of couple of things to say so
 

7659
02:27:09,439 --> 02:27:11,670
couple of couple of things to say so
quantum mechanics is actually in a sense

7660
02:27:11,670 --> 02:27:11,680
quantum mechanics is actually in a sense
 

7661
02:27:11,680 --> 02:27:13,910
quantum mechanics is actually in a sense
two different theories glued together

7662
02:27:13,910 --> 02:27:13,920
two different theories glued together
 

7663
02:27:13,920 --> 02:27:16,750
two different theories glued together
quantum mechanics is a theory of how

7664
02:27:16,750 --> 02:27:16,760
quantum mechanics is a theory of how
 

7665
02:27:16,760 --> 02:27:18,469
quantum mechanics is a theory of how
Quantum amplitudes work that more or

7666
02:27:18,469 --> 02:27:18,479
Quantum amplitudes work that more or
 

7667
02:27:18,479 --> 02:27:19,550
Quantum amplitudes work that more or
less give you the probabilities of

7668
02:27:19,550 --> 02:27:19,560
less give you the probabilities of
 

7669
02:27:19,560 --> 02:27:20,670
less give you the probabilities of
things happening

7670
02:27:20,670 --> 02:27:20,680
things happening
 

7671
02:27:20,680 --> 02:27:21,870
things happening
and it's the theory of quantum

7672
02:27:21,870 --> 02:27:21,880
and it's the theory of quantum
 

7673
02:27:21,880 --> 02:27:23,990
and it's the theory of quantum
measurement which is the theory of how

7674
02:27:23,990 --> 02:27:24,000
measurement which is the theory of how
 

7675
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:27,070
measurement which is the theory of how
we actually conclude definite things

7676
02:27:27,070 --> 02:27:27,080
we actually conclude definite things
 

7677
02:27:27,080 --> 02:27:29,030
we actually conclude definite things
because the mathematics just gives you

7678
02:27:29,030 --> 02:27:29,040
because the mathematics just gives you
 

7679
02:27:29,040 --> 02:27:30,429
because the mathematics just gives you
these Quantum amplitudes which are more

7680
02:27:30,429 --> 02:27:30,439
these Quantum amplitudes which are more
 

7681
02:27:30,439 --> 02:27:31,710
these Quantum amplitudes which are more
or less probabilities of things

7682
02:27:31,710 --> 02:27:31,720
or less probabilities of things
 

7683
02:27:31,720 --> 02:27:34,349
or less probabilities of things
happening but yet we actually observe

02:27:34,349 --> 02:27:34,359
happening but yet we actually observe
 

7685
02:27:34,359 --> 02:27:37,230
happening but yet we actually observe
definite things in the world um Quantum

7686
02:27:37,230 --> 02:27:37,240
definite things in the world um Quantum
 

7687
02:27:37,240 --> 02:27:38,309
definite things in the world um Quantum
measurement has always been a bit

7688
02:27:38,309 --> 02:27:38,319
measurement has always been a bit
 

7689
02:27:38,319 --> 02:27:39,910
measurement has always been a bit
mysterious it's always been something

7690
02:27:39,910 --> 02:27:39,920
mysterious it's always been something
 

7691
02:27:39,920 --> 02:27:41,389
mysterious it's always been something
where people just say well the

7692
02:27:41,389 --> 02:27:41,399
where people just say well the
 

7693
02:27:41,399 --> 02:27:42,990
where people just say well the
mathematics says this but then you do a

7694
02:27:42,990 --> 02:27:43,000
mathematics says this but then you do a
 

7695
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:44,630
mathematics says this but then you do a
measurement and they're philosophical

7696
02:27:44,630 --> 02:27:44,640
measurement and they're philosophical
 

7697
02:27:44,640 --> 02:27:46,670
measurement and they're philosophical
arguments about what the measurement is

7698
02:27:46,670 --> 02:27:46,680
arguments about what the measurement is
 

7699
02:27:46,680 --> 02:27:48,190
arguments about what the measurement is
but it's not something where there's a

7700
02:27:48,190 --> 02:27:48,200
but it's not something where there's a
 

7701
02:27:48,200 --> 02:27:50,990
but it's not something where there's a
theory of the measurement some on Reddit

7702
02:27:50,990 --> 02:27:51,000
theory of the measurement some on Reddit
 

7703
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:55,950
theory of the measurement some on Reddit
also asked uh please ask Stephen to tell

7704
02:27:55,950 --> 02:27:55,960
also asked uh please ask Stephen to tell
 

7705
02:27:55,960 --> 02:27:59,150
also asked uh please ask Stephen to tell
his story of this the double slit

7706
02:27:59,150 --> 02:27:59,160
his story of this the double slit
 

7707
02:27:59,160 --> 02:28:02,070
his story of this the double slit
experiment okay yeah I can does that

7708
02:28:02,070 --> 02:28:02,080
experiment okay yeah I can does that
 

7709
02:28:02,080 --> 02:28:04,030
experiment okay yeah I can does that
does that make sense oh yeah makes sense

7710
02:28:04,030 --> 02:28:04,040
does that make sense oh yeah makes sense
 

7711
02:28:04,040 --> 02:28:05,910
does that make sense oh yeah makes sense
absolutely makes sense why is this like

7712
02:28:05,910 --> 02:28:05,920
absolutely makes sense why is this like
 

7713
02:28:05,920 --> 02:28:08,230
absolutely makes sense why is this like
a good way to discuss uh a little bit

7714
02:28:08,230 --> 02:28:08,240
a good way to discuss uh a little bit
 

7715
02:28:08,240 --> 02:28:10,030
a good way to discuss uh a little bit
let me let me go let me explain a couple

7716
02:28:10,030 --> 02:28:10,040
let me let me go let me explain a couple
 

7717
02:28:10,040 --> 02:28:12,950
let me let me go let me explain a couple
of things first so so the structure of

7718
02:28:12,950 --> 02:28:12,960
of things first so so the structure of
 

7719
02:28:12,960 --> 02:28:14,590
of things first so so the structure of
quantum mechanics is is mathematically

7720
02:28:14,590 --> 02:28:14,600
quantum mechanics is is mathematically
 

7721
02:28:14,600 --> 02:28:18,190
quantum mechanics is is mathematically
quite complicated um one of the features

7722
02:28:18,190 --> 02:28:18,200
quite complicated um one of the features
 

7723
02:28:18,200 --> 02:28:19,910
quite complicated um one of the features
let's see well how to how to describe

7724
02:28:19,910 --> 02:28:19,920
let's see well how to how to describe
 

7725
02:28:19,920 --> 02:28:20,630
let's see well how to how to describe
this

7726
02:28:20,630 --> 02:28:20,640
this
 

7727
02:28:20,640 --> 02:28:22,630
this
okay so first point is there's this

7728
02:28:22,630 --> 02:28:22,640
okay so first point is there's this
 

7729
02:28:22,640 --> 02:28:24,910
okay so first point is there's this
multi-way graph of all these different

7730
02:28:24,910 --> 02:28:24,920
multi-way graph of all these different
 

7731
02:28:24,920 --> 02:28:27,630
multi-way graph of all these different
Paths of of things that can happen in

7732
02:28:27,630 --> 02:28:27,640
Paths of of things that can happen in
 

7733
02:28:27,640 --> 02:28:30,150
Paths of of things that can happen in
the world and the important point is

7734
02:28:30,150 --> 02:28:30,160
the world and the important point is
 

7735
02:28:30,160 --> 02:28:33,070
the world and the important point is
that that uh these you can have

7736
02:28:33,070 --> 02:28:33,080
that that uh these you can have
 

7737
02:28:33,080 --> 02:28:35,710
that that uh these you can have
branchings and you can have mergings

7738
02:28:35,710 --> 02:28:35,720
branchings and you can have mergings
 

7739
02:28:35,720 --> 02:28:38,630
branchings and you can have mergings
Okay so this property turns out causal

7740
02:28:38,630 --> 02:28:38,640
Okay so this property turns out causal
 

7741
02:28:38,640 --> 02:28:41,870
Okay so this property turns out causal
invariance is the statement that the

7742
02:28:41,870 --> 02:28:41,880
invariance is the statement that the
 

7743
02:28:41,880 --> 02:28:43,870
invariance is the statement that the
number of mergings is equal to the

7744
02:28:43,870 --> 02:28:43,880
number of mergings is equal to the
 

7745
02:28:43,880 --> 02:28:46,550
number of mergings is equal to the
number of branchings yeah so in other

7746
02:28:46,550 --> 02:28:46,560
number of branchings yeah so in other
 

7747
02:28:46,560 --> 02:28:48,710
number of branchings yeah so in other
words every time there's a branch

7748
02:28:48,710 --> 02:28:48,720
words every time there's a branch
 

7749
02:28:48,720 --> 02:28:50,550
words every time there's a branch
eventually there will also be a merge

7750
02:28:50,550 --> 02:28:50,560
eventually there will also be a merge
 

7751
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:52,070
eventually there will also be a merge
in other words every time there were two

7752
02:28:52,070 --> 02:28:52,080
in other words every time there were two
 

7753
02:28:52,080 --> 02:28:53,150
in other words every time there were two
possibilities of what might have

7754
02:28:53,150 --> 02:28:53,160
possibilities of what might have
 

7755
02:28:53,160 --> 02:28:55,110
possibilities of what might have
happened eventually those will merge

7756
02:28:55,110 --> 02:28:55,120
happened eventually those will merge
 

7757
02:28:55,120 --> 02:28:57,030
happened eventually those will merge
beautiful concept by the way yeah yeah

7758
02:28:57,030 --> 02:28:57,040
beautiful concept by the way yeah yeah
 

7759
02:28:57,040 --> 02:29:01,150
beautiful concept by the way yeah yeah
yeah so so that so that idea okay so

7760
02:29:01,150 --> 02:29:01,160
yeah so so that so that idea okay so
 

7761
02:29:01,160 --> 02:29:04,030
yeah so so that so that idea okay so
then uh so that's that's one thing and

7762
02:29:04,030 --> 02:29:04,040
then uh so that's that's one thing and
 

7763
02:29:04,040 --> 02:29:06,790
then uh so that's that's one thing and
that's closely related to the the sort

7764
02:29:06,790 --> 02:29:06,800
that's closely related to the the sort
 

7765
02:29:06,800 --> 02:29:08,550
that's closely related to the the sort
of objectivity in quantum mechanics the

7766
02:29:08,550 --> 02:29:08,560
of objectivity in quantum mechanics the
 

7767
02:29:08,560 --> 02:29:09,990
of objectivity in quantum mechanics the
fact that we believe definite things

7768
02:29:09,990 --> 02:29:10,000
fact that we believe definite things
 

7769
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:11,510
fact that we believe definite things
happen it's because although there are

7770
02:29:11,510 --> 02:29:11,520
happen it's because although there are
 

7771
02:29:11,520 --> 02:29:14,349
happen it's because although there are
all these different paths in some sense

7772
02:29:14,349 --> 02:29:14,359
all these different paths in some sense
 

7773
02:29:14,359 --> 02:29:15,830
all these different paths in some sense
because of causal invariance they all

7774
02:29:15,830 --> 02:29:15,840
because of causal invariance they all
 

7775
02:29:15,840 --> 02:29:17,990
because of causal invariance they all
imply the same thing that's I'm I'm

7776
02:29:17,990 --> 02:29:18,000
imply the same thing that's I'm I'm
 

7777
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:19,469
imply the same thing that's I'm I'm
cheating a little bit in saying that but

7778
02:29:19,469 --> 02:29:19,479
cheating a little bit in saying that but
 

7779
02:29:19,479 --> 02:29:21,309
cheating a little bit in saying that but
that's roughly the essence of what's

7780
02:29:21,309 --> 02:29:21,319
that's roughly the essence of what's
 

7781
02:29:21,319 --> 02:29:24,070
that's roughly the essence of what's
going on okay next next thing to think

7782
02:29:24,070 --> 02:29:24,080
going on okay next next thing to think
 

7783
02:29:24,080 --> 02:29:26,990
going on okay next next thing to think
about is uh you have this multi-way

7784
02:29:26,990 --> 02:29:27,000
about is uh you have this multi-way
 

7785
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:28,230
about is uh you have this multi-way
graph it has all these different

7786
02:29:28,230 --> 02:29:28,240
graph it has all these different
 

7787
02:29:28,240 --> 02:29:30,750
graph it has all these different
possible things that are happening now

7788
02:29:30,750 --> 02:29:30,760
possible things that are happening now
 

7789
02:29:30,760 --> 02:29:32,870
possible things that are happening now
we ask this multi-way graph is sort of

7790
02:29:32,870 --> 02:29:32,880
we ask this multi-way graph is sort of
 

7791
02:29:32,880 --> 02:29:35,429
we ask this multi-way graph is sort of
evolving with time o over time it's

7792
02:29:35,429 --> 02:29:35,439
evolving with time o over time it's
 

7793
02:29:35,439 --> 02:29:37,110
evolving with time o over time it's
branching it's merging it's doing all

7794
02:29:37,110 --> 02:29:37,120
branching it's merging it's doing all
 

7795
02:29:37,120 --> 02:29:40,550
branching it's merging it's doing all
these things okay um the question we can

7796
02:29:40,550 --> 02:29:40,560
these things okay um the question we can
 

7797
02:29:40,560 --> 02:29:43,670
these things okay um the question we can
ask is if we slice it a at a particular

7798
02:29:43,670 --> 02:29:43,680
ask is if we slice it a at a particular
 

7799
02:29:43,680 --> 02:29:47,429
ask is if we slice it a at a particular
time what do we see and that slice

7800
02:29:47,429 --> 02:29:47,439
time what do we see and that slice
 

7801
02:29:47,439 --> 02:29:49,590
time what do we see and that slice
represents in a sense something to do

7802
02:29:49,590 --> 02:29:49,600
represents in a sense something to do
 

7803
02:29:49,600 --> 02:29:51,269
represents in a sense something to do
with the state state of the universe at

7804
02:29:51,269 --> 02:29:51,279
with the state state of the universe at
 

7805
02:29:51,279 --> 02:29:53,830
with the state state of the universe at
a particular time so in other words

7806
02:29:53,830 --> 02:29:53,840
a particular time so in other words
 

7807
02:29:53,840 --> 02:29:55,269
a particular time so in other words
we've got this multi-way graph of all

7808
02:29:55,269 --> 02:29:55,279
we've got this multi-way graph of all
 

7809
02:29:55,279 --> 02:29:57,110
we've got this multi-way graph of all
these possibilities and then we're

7810
02:29:57,110 --> 02:29:57,120
these possibilities and then we're
 

7811
02:29:57,120 --> 02:30:01,349
these possibilities and then we're
asking an an okay we take this slice

7812
02:30:01,349 --> 02:30:01,359
asking an an okay we take this slice
 

7813
02:30:01,359 --> 02:30:04,710
asking an an okay we take this slice
this slice represents aent okay each of

7814
02:30:04,710 --> 02:30:04,720
this slice represents aent okay each of
 

7815
02:30:04,720 --> 02:30:06,309
this slice represents aent okay each of
these different paths corresponds to a

7816
02:30:06,309 --> 02:30:06,319
these different paths corresponds to a
 

7817
02:30:06,319 --> 02:30:08,150
these different paths corresponds to a
different Quantum possibility for what's

7818
02:30:08,150 --> 02:30:08,160
different Quantum possibility for what's
 

7819
02:30:08,160 --> 02:30:10,870
different Quantum possibility for what's
happening right when we take this slice

7820
02:30:10,870 --> 02:30:10,880
happening right when we take this slice
 

7821
02:30:10,880 --> 02:30:12,469
happening right when we take this slice
we're saying what are the set of quantum

7822
02:30:12,469 --> 02:30:12,479
we're saying what are the set of quantum
 

7823
02:30:12,479 --> 02:30:14,389
we're saying what are the set of quantum
possibilities that exist at a particular

7824
02:30:14,389 --> 02:30:14,399
possibilities that exist at a particular
 

7825
02:30:14,399 --> 02:30:16,670
possibilities that exist at a particular
time and when you say slice are these

7826
02:30:16,670 --> 02:30:16,680
time and when you say slice are these
 

7827
02:30:16,680 --> 02:30:18,230
time and when you say slice are these
you slice the graph and then there's a

7828
02:30:18,230 --> 02:30:18,240
you slice the graph and then there's a
 

7829
02:30:18,240 --> 02:30:20,870
you slice the graph and then there's a
bunch of leaves a bunch of and those

7830
02:30:20,870 --> 02:30:20,880
bunch of leaves a bunch of and those
 

7831
02:30:20,880 --> 02:30:23,990
bunch of leaves a bunch of and those
represent the state of things right but

7832
02:30:23,990 --> 02:30:24,000
represent the state of things right but
 

7833
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,389
represent the state of things right but
but then okay so the important thing

7834
02:30:26,389 --> 02:30:26,399
but then okay so the important thing
 

7835
02:30:26,399 --> 02:30:29,750
but then okay so the important thing
that you are quickly picking up on is

7836
02:30:29,750 --> 02:30:29,760
that you are quickly picking up on is
 

7837
02:30:29,760 --> 02:30:32,230
that you are quickly picking up on is
that um what what matters is kind of how

7838
02:30:32,230 --> 02:30:32,240
that um what what matters is kind of how
 

7839
02:30:32,240 --> 02:30:34,710
that um what what matters is kind of how
these leaves are related to each other

7840
02:30:34,710 --> 02:30:34,720
these leaves are related to each other
 

7841
02:30:34,720 --> 02:30:37,110
these leaves are related to each other
so a good way to tell how leaves are

7842
02:30:37,110 --> 02:30:37,120
so a good way to tell how leaves are
 

7843
02:30:37,120 --> 02:30:39,190
so a good way to tell how leaves are
related is just to say on the step

7844
02:30:39,190 --> 02:30:39,200
related is just to say on the step
 

7845
02:30:39,200 --> 02:30:42,150
related is just to say on the step
before did they have a common ancestor

7846
02:30:42,150 --> 02:30:42,160
before did they have a common ancestor
 

7847
02:30:42,160 --> 02:30:44,429
before did they have a common ancestor
so two leaves might be they might have

7848
02:30:44,429 --> 02:30:44,439
so two leaves might be they might have
 

7849
02:30:44,439 --> 02:30:45,990
so two leaves might be they might have
just branched from one thing or they

7850
02:30:45,990 --> 02:30:46,000
just branched from one thing or they
 

7851
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:49,550
just branched from one thing or they
might be far away you know way far apart

7852
02:30:49,550 --> 02:30:49,560
might be far away you know way far apart
 

7853
02:30:49,560 --> 02:30:51,790
might be far away you know way far apart
in this graph where to get to a common

7854
02:30:51,790 --> 02:30:51,800
in this graph where to get to a common
 

7855
02:30:51,800 --> 02:30:53,070
in this graph where to get to a common
ancestor maybe you have to go all the

7856
02:30:53,070 --> 02:30:53,080
ancestor maybe you have to go all the
 

7857
02:30:53,080 --> 02:30:54,230
ancestor maybe you have to go all the
way back to the beginning of the graph

7858
02:30:54,230 --> 02:30:54,240
way back to the beginning of the graph
 

7859
02:30:54,240 --> 02:30:55,429
way back to the beginning of the graph
all the way back to the beginning so

7860
02:30:55,429 --> 02:30:55,439
all the way back to the beginning so
 

7861
02:30:55,439 --> 02:30:57,269
all the way back to the beginning so
there's some kind of measure of distance

7862
02:30:57,269 --> 02:30:57,279
there's some kind of measure of distance
 

7863
02:30:57,279 --> 02:30:59,630
there's some kind of measure of distance
right and and that but the what you get

7864
02:30:59,630 --> 02:30:59,640
right and and that but the what you get
 

7865
02:30:59,640 --> 02:31:01,070
right and and that but the what you get
is by making the

7866
02:31:01,070 --> 02:31:01,080
is by making the
 

7867
02:31:01,080 --> 02:31:03,670
is by making the
slice what we call it branchial space

7868
02:31:03,670 --> 02:31:03,680
slice what we call it branchial space
 

7869
02:31:03,680 --> 02:31:06,469
slice what we call it branchial space
the space of branches um and in this

7870
02:31:06,469 --> 02:31:06,479
the space of branches um and in this
 

7871
02:31:06,479 --> 02:31:09,830
the space of branches um and in this
branchial space um you have a graph that

7872
02:31:09,830 --> 02:31:09,840
branchial space um you have a graph that
 

7873
02:31:09,840 --> 02:31:12,030
branchial space um you have a graph that
represents the relationships between

7874
02:31:12,030 --> 02:31:12,040
represents the relationships between
 

7875
02:31:12,040 --> 02:31:14,630
represents the relationships between
these Quantum States in branchial space

7876
02:31:14,630 --> 02:31:14,640
these Quantum States in branchial space
 

7877
02:31:14,640 --> 02:31:16,349
these Quantum States in branchial space
you have this notion of distance in

7878
02:31:16,349 --> 02:31:16,359
you have this notion of distance in
 

7879
02:31:16,359 --> 02:31:19,030
you have this notion of distance in
branchial space okay so it's connected

7880
02:31:19,030 --> 02:31:19,040
branchial space okay so it's connected
 

7881
02:31:19,040 --> 02:31:20,469
branchial space okay so it's connected
to Quant

7882
02:31:20,469 --> 02:31:20,479
to Quant
 

7883
02:31:20,479 --> 02:31:22,630
to Quant
entanglement yes yes it's it's it's

7884
02:31:22,630 --> 02:31:22,640
entanglement yes yes it's it's it's
 

7885
02:31:22,640 --> 02:31:25,269
entanglement yes yes it's it's it's
basically the the distance in branchial

7886
02:31:25,269 --> 02:31:25,279
basically the the distance in branchial
 

7887
02:31:25,279 --> 02:31:26,950
basically the the distance in branchial
space is kind of an entanglement

7888
02:31:26,950 --> 02:31:26,960
space is kind of an entanglement
 

7889
02:31:26,960 --> 02:31:29,309
space is kind of an entanglement
distance so this that's a very nice

7890
02:31:29,309 --> 02:31:29,319
distance so this that's a very nice
 

7891
02:31:29,319 --> 02:31:31,750
distance so this that's a very nice
model right it is very nice it's very

7892
02:31:31,750 --> 02:31:31,760
model right it is very nice it's very
 

7893
02:31:31,760 --> 02:31:35,030
model right it is very nice it's very
beautiful it's it's I mean it's it's so

7894
02:31:35,030 --> 02:31:35,040
beautiful it's it's I mean it's it's so
 

7895
02:31:35,040 --> 02:31:37,030
beautiful it's it's I mean it's it's so
clean I mean it's it's really you know

7896
02:31:37,030 --> 02:31:37,040
clean I mean it's it's really you know
 

7897
02:31:37,040 --> 02:31:39,830
clean I mean it's it's really you know
and it it it tells one okay so anyway so

7898
02:31:39,830 --> 02:31:39,840
and it it it tells one okay so anyway so
 

7899
02:31:39,840 --> 02:31:42,870
and it it it tells one okay so anyway so
then then this this branchial space uh

7900
02:31:42,870 --> 02:31:42,880
then then this this branchial space uh
 

7901
02:31:42,880 --> 02:31:45,349
then then this this branchial space uh
has this sort of map of the the

7902
02:31:45,349 --> 02:31:45,359
has this sort of map of the the
 

7903
02:31:45,359 --> 02:31:48,070
has this sort of map of the the
entanglements between Quantum States so

7904
02:31:48,070 --> 02:31:48,080
entanglements between Quantum States so
 

7905
02:31:48,080 --> 02:31:50,990
entanglements between Quantum States so
in physical space we have so so you know

7906
02:31:50,990 --> 02:31:51,000
in physical space we have so so you know
 

7907
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,950
in physical space we have so so you know
you can say take let's say the causal

7908
02:31:53,950 --> 02:31:53,960
you can say take let's say the causal
 

7909
02:31:53,960 --> 02:31:57,070
you can say take let's say the causal
graph and we can slice that um at a

7910
02:31:57,070 --> 02:31:57,080
graph and we can slice that um at a
 

7911
02:31:57,080 --> 02:31:58,790
graph and we can slice that um at a
particular time and then we get this map

7912
02:31:58,790 --> 02:31:58,800
particular time and then we get this map
 

7913
02:31:58,800 --> 02:32:00,389
particular time and then we get this map
of how things are laid out in physical

7914
02:32:00,389 --> 02:32:00,399
of how things are laid out in physical
 

7915
02:32:00,399 --> 02:32:02,710
of how things are laid out in physical
space when we do the same kind of thing

7916
02:32:02,710 --> 02:32:02,720
space when we do the same kind of thing
 

7917
02:32:02,720 --> 02:32:04,070
space when we do the same kind of thing
there's a thing called the multi-way

7918
02:32:04,070 --> 02:32:04,080
there's a thing called the multi-way
 

7919
02:32:04,080 --> 02:32:05,710
there's a thing called the multi-way
causal graph which is the analog of a

7920
02:32:05,710 --> 02:32:05,720
causal graph which is the analog of a
 

7921
02:32:05,720 --> 02:32:07,950
causal graph which is the analog of a
causal graph for the multi-way system we

7922
02:32:07,950 --> 02:32:07,960
causal graph for the multi-way system we
 

7923
02:32:07,960 --> 02:32:10,550
causal graph for the multi-way system we
slice that we get essentially the

7924
02:32:10,550 --> 02:32:10,560
slice that we get essentially the
 

7925
02:32:10,560 --> 02:32:12,469
slice that we get essentially the
relationships between things not in

7926
02:32:12,469 --> 02:32:12,479
relationships between things not in
 

7927
02:32:12,479 --> 02:32:14,550
relationships between things not in
physical space but in the space of

7928
02:32:14,550 --> 02:32:14,560
physical space but in the space of
 

7929
02:32:14,560 --> 02:32:16,710
physical space but in the space of
quantum States it's like which Quantum

7930
02:32:16,710 --> 02:32:16,720
quantum States it's like which Quantum
 

7931
02:32:16,720 --> 02:32:18,510
quantum States it's like which Quantum
state is similar to which other Quantum

7932
02:32:18,510 --> 02:32:18,520
state is similar to which other Quantum
 

7933
02:32:18,520 --> 02:32:22,070
state is similar to which other Quantum
State okay so now I think next thing to

7934
02:32:22,070 --> 02:32:22,080
State okay so now I think next thing to
 

7935
02:32:22,080 --> 02:32:23,469
State okay so now I think next thing to
say is just to mention how Quantum

7936
02:32:23,469 --> 02:32:23,479
say is just to mention how Quantum
 

7937
02:32:23,479 --> 02:32:25,870
say is just to mention how Quantum
measurement works so Quantum measurement

7938
02:32:25,870 --> 02:32:25,880
measurement works so Quantum measurement
 

7939
02:32:25,880 --> 02:32:27,670
measurement works so Quantum measurement
has to do with reference frames in

7940
02:32:27,670 --> 02:32:27,680
has to do with reference frames in
 

7941
02:32:27,680 --> 02:32:31,750
has to do with reference frames in
bronchial space so okay so measurement

7942
02:32:31,750 --> 02:32:31,760
bronchial space so okay so measurement
 

7943
02:32:31,760 --> 02:32:35,030
bronchial space so okay so measurement
in in physical space it matters whether

7944
02:32:35,030 --> 02:32:35,040
in in physical space it matters whether
 

7945
02:32:35,040 --> 02:32:36,230
in in physical space it matters whether
how we

7946
02:32:36,230 --> 02:32:36,240
how we
 

7947
02:32:36,240 --> 02:32:39,990
how we
assign spatial position and how we how

7948
02:32:39,990 --> 02:32:40,000
assign spatial position and how we how
 

7949
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,710
assign spatial position and how we how
we Define coordinates in space and time

7950
02:32:42,710 --> 02:32:42,720
we Define coordinates in space and time
 

7951
02:32:42,720 --> 02:32:44,230
we Define coordinates in space and time
and that's that's how we make

7952
02:32:44,230 --> 02:32:44,240
and that's that's how we make
 

7953
02:32:44,240 --> 02:32:45,750
and that's that's how we make
measurements in ordinary space are we

7954
02:32:45,750 --> 02:32:45,760
measurements in ordinary space are we
 

7955
02:32:45,760 --> 02:32:47,429
measurements in ordinary space are we
making a measurement based on us sitting

7956
02:32:47,429 --> 02:32:47,439
making a measurement based on us sitting
 

7957
02:32:47,439 --> 02:32:49,389
making a measurement based on us sitting
still here are we traveling at half the

7958
02:32:49,389 --> 02:32:49,399
still here are we traveling at half the
 

7959
02:32:49,399 --> 02:32:50,349
still here are we traveling at half the
speed of light light in making

7960
02:32:50,349 --> 02:32:50,359
speed of light light in making
 

7961
02:32:50,359 --> 02:32:52,030
speed of light light in making
measurements that way these are

7962
02:32:52,030 --> 02:32:52,040
measurements that way these are
 

7963
02:32:52,040 --> 02:32:53,429
measurements that way these are
different reference frames in which

7964
02:32:53,429 --> 02:32:53,439
different reference frames in which
 

7965
02:32:53,439 --> 02:32:55,190
different reference frames in which
we're making our measurements and the

7966
02:32:55,190 --> 02:32:55,200
we're making our measurements and the
 

7967
02:32:55,200 --> 02:32:57,910
we're making our measurements and the
relationship between different events

7968
02:32:57,910 --> 02:32:57,920
relationship between different events
 

7969
02:32:57,920 --> 02:33:00,469
relationship between different events
and different points in space and time

7970
02:33:00,469 --> 02:33:00,479
and different points in space and time
 

7971
02:33:00,479 --> 02:33:02,990
and different points in space and time
uh will be different depending on what

7972
02:33:02,990 --> 02:33:03,000
uh will be different depending on what
 

7973
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,590
uh will be different depending on what
reference frame we're in okay so then we

7974
02:33:05,590 --> 02:33:05,600
reference frame we're in okay so then we
 

7975
02:33:05,600 --> 02:33:08,030
reference frame we're in okay so then we
have this idea of quantum observation

7976
02:33:08,030 --> 02:33:08,040
have this idea of quantum observation
 

7977
02:33:08,040 --> 02:33:10,670
have this idea of quantum observation
frames which are the analog of reference

7978
02:33:10,670 --> 02:33:10,680
frames which are the analog of reference
 

7979
02:33:10,680 --> 02:33:13,590
frames which are the analog of reference
frames but in branchial space and so

7980
02:33:13,590 --> 02:33:13,600
frames but in branchial space and so
 

7981
02:33:13,600 --> 02:33:16,230
frames but in branchial space and so
what happens is what we realize is that

7982
02:33:16,230 --> 02:33:16,240
what happens is what we realize is that
 

7983
02:33:16,240 --> 02:33:19,030
what happens is what we realize is that
a Quantum measurement is the The

7984
02:33:19,030 --> 02:33:19,040
a Quantum measurement is the The
 

7985
02:33:19,040 --> 02:33:21,190
a Quantum measurement is the The
Observer is sort of arbitrarily

7986
02:33:21,190 --> 02:33:21,200
Observer is sort of arbitrarily
 

7987
02:33:21,200 --> 02:33:23,190
Observer is sort of arbitrarily
determining this reference frame The

7988
02:33:23,190 --> 02:33:23,200
determining this reference frame The
 

7989
02:33:23,200 --> 02:33:25,670
determining this reference frame The
Observer is saying I'm going to

7990
02:33:25,670 --> 02:33:25,680
Observer is saying I'm going to
 

7991
02:33:25,680 --> 02:33:28,110
Observer is saying I'm going to
understand the World by saying that

7992
02:33:28,110 --> 02:33:28,120
understand the World by saying that
 

7993
02:33:28,120 --> 02:33:30,670
understand the World by saying that
space and time are coordinati this way

7994
02:33:30,670 --> 02:33:30,680
space and time are coordinati this way
 

7995
02:33:30,680 --> 02:33:32,070
space and time are coordinati this way
I'm going to understand the World by

7996
02:33:32,070 --> 02:33:32,080
I'm going to understand the World by
 

7997
02:33:32,080 --> 02:33:46,670
I'm going to understand the World by
saying that Quantum States and time are

7998
02:33:46,670 --> 02:33:46,680

 

7999
02:33:46,680 --> 02:33:49,309

coordinatization frames so in a sense

8000
02:33:49,309 --> 02:33:49,319
coordinatization frames so in a sense
 

8001
02:33:49,319 --> 02:33:50,269
coordinatization frames so in a sense
the obser

8002
02:33:50,269 --> 02:33:50,279
the obser
 

8003
02:33:50,279 --> 02:33:52,550
the obser
the way the Observer enters is by their

8004
02:33:52,550 --> 02:33:52,560
the way the Observer enters is by their
 

8005
02:33:52,560 --> 02:33:54,830
the way the Observer enters is by their
choice of these Quantum observation

8006
02:33:54,830 --> 02:33:54,840
choice of these Quantum observation
 

8007
02:33:54,840 --> 02:33:57,670
choice of these Quantum observation
frames and what happens is that the

8008
02:33:57,670 --> 02:33:57,680
frames and what happens is that the
 

8009
02:33:57,680 --> 02:34:00,670
frames and what happens is that the
Observer um because okay this is again

8010
02:34:00,670 --> 02:34:00,680
Observer um because okay this is again
 

8011
02:34:00,680 --> 02:34:02,710
Observer um because okay this is again
another stack of other Concepts but

8012
02:34:02,710 --> 02:34:02,720
another stack of other Concepts but
 

8013
02:34:02,720 --> 02:34:04,429
another stack of other Concepts but
anyway because the Observer is

8014
02:34:04,429 --> 02:34:04,439
anyway because the Observer is
 

8015
02:34:04,439 --> 02:34:07,070
anyway because the Observer is
computationally bounded there is a limit

8016
02:34:07,070 --> 02:34:07,080
computationally bounded there is a limit
 

8017
02:34:07,080 --> 02:34:08,630
computationally bounded there is a limit
to the type of quantum observation

8018
02:34:08,630 --> 02:34:08,640
to the type of quantum observation
 

8019
02:34:08,640 --> 02:34:10,190
to the type of quantum observation
frames that they can construct

8020
02:34:10,190 --> 02:34:10,200
frames that they can construct
 

8021
02:34:10,200 --> 02:34:12,190
frames that they can construct
interesting okay so there's okay so some

8022
02:34:12,190 --> 02:34:12,200
interesting okay so there's okay so some
 

8023
02:34:12,200 --> 02:34:15,349
interesting okay so there's okay so some
constraints some limit on and that's on

8024
02:34:15,349 --> 02:34:15,359
constraints some limit on and that's on
 

8025
02:34:15,359 --> 02:34:18,150
constraints some limit on and that's on
the choice of observation frames right

8026
02:34:18,150 --> 02:34:18,160
the choice of observation frames right
 

8027
02:34:18,160 --> 02:34:20,110
the choice of observation frames right
and by the way I just want to mentioned

8028
02:34:20,110 --> 02:34:20,120
and by the way I just want to mentioned
 

8029
02:34:20,120 --> 02:34:21,990
and by the way I just want to mentioned
that there's a I mean it's it's bizarre

8030
02:34:21,990 --> 02:34:22,000
that there's a I mean it's it's bizarre
 

8031
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:23,830
that there's a I mean it's it's bizarre
but there's a hierarchy of these things

8032
02:34:23,830 --> 02:34:23,840
but there's a hierarchy of these things
 

8033
02:34:23,840 --> 02:34:26,670
but there's a hierarchy of these things
so in in um uh in

8034
02:34:26,670 --> 02:34:26,680
so in in um uh in
 

8035
02:34:26,680 --> 02:34:28,590
so in in um uh in
thermodynamics the the fact that we

8036
02:34:28,590 --> 02:34:28,600
thermodynamics the the fact that we
 

8037
02:34:28,600 --> 02:34:30,150
thermodynamics the the fact that we
believe entropy increases we believe

8038
02:34:30,150 --> 02:34:30,160
believe entropy increases we believe
 

8039
02:34:30,160 --> 02:34:31,870
believe entropy increases we believe
things get more disordered is a

8040
02:34:31,870 --> 02:34:31,880
things get more disordered is a
 

8041
02:34:31,880 --> 02:34:33,070
things get more disordered is a
consequence of the fact that we can't

8042
02:34:33,070 --> 02:34:33,080
consequence of the fact that we can't
 

8043
02:34:33,080 --> 02:34:34,550
consequence of the fact that we can't
track each individual molecule if we

8044
02:34:34,550 --> 02:34:34,560
track each individual molecule if we
 

8045
02:34:34,560 --> 02:34:36,389
track each individual molecule if we
could track every single molecule we

8046
02:34:36,389 --> 02:34:36,399
could track every single molecule we
 

8047
02:34:36,399 --> 02:34:38,070
could track every single molecule we
could run every movie in Reverse so to

8048
02:34:38,070 --> 02:34:38,080
could run every movie in Reverse so to
 

8049
02:34:38,080 --> 02:34:40,190
could run every movie in Reverse so to
speak and we would you know we would not

8050
02:34:40,190 --> 02:34:40,200
speak and we would you know we would not
 

8051
02:34:40,200 --> 02:34:41,630
speak and we would you know we would not
see that things are getting more

8052
02:34:41,630 --> 02:34:41,640
see that things are getting more
 

8053
02:34:41,640 --> 02:34:43,389
see that things are getting more
disordered but it's because we are

8054
02:34:43,389 --> 02:34:43,399
disordered but it's because we are
 

8055
02:34:43,399 --> 02:34:45,710
disordered but it's because we are
computationally bounded we can only look

8056
02:34:45,710 --> 02:34:45,720
computationally bounded we can only look
 

8057
02:34:45,720 --> 02:34:47,510
computationally bounded we can only look
at these big blobs of what all these

8058
02:34:47,510 --> 02:34:47,520
at these big blobs of what all these
 

8059
02:34:47,520 --> 02:34:50,750
at these big blobs of what all these
molecules collectively do that we think

8060
02:34:50,750 --> 02:34:50,760
molecules collectively do that we think
 

8061
02:34:50,760 --> 02:34:53,469
molecules collectively do that we think
that things are that we describe it in

8062
02:34:53,469 --> 02:34:53,479
that things are that we describe it in
 

8063
02:34:53,479 --> 02:34:55,990
that things are that we describe it in
terms of of entropy increasing and so on

8064
02:34:55,990 --> 02:34:56,000
terms of of entropy increasing and so on
 

8065
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,790
terms of of entropy increasing and so on
and it's the same phenomenon basically

8066
02:34:58,790 --> 02:34:58,800
and it's the same phenomenon basically
 

8067
02:34:58,800 --> 02:35:00,550
and it's the same phenomenon basically
also the consequence of computational

8068
02:35:00,550 --> 02:35:00,560
also the consequence of computational
 

8069
02:35:00,560 --> 02:35:03,110
also the consequence of computational
irreducibility that causes us to

8070
02:35:03,110 --> 02:35:03,120
irreducibility that causes us to
 

8071
02:35:03,120 --> 02:35:04,990
irreducibility that causes us to
basically be forced to conclude that

the level of kind of Middle School type
 

8115
02:35:49,080 --> 02:35:51,510
the level of kind of Middle School type
explanation right and I'm getting closer

8116
02:35:51,510 --> 02:35:51,520
explanation right and I'm getting closer
 

8117
02:35:51,520 --> 02:35:53,030
explanation right and I'm getting closer
it's getting it's getting there I'm not

8118
02:35:53,030 --> 02:35:53,040
it's getting it's getting there I'm not
 

8119
02:35:53,040 --> 02:35:54,910
it's getting it's getting there I'm not
quite there I've tried it a few times

8120
02:35:54,910 --> 02:35:54,920
quite there I've tried it a few times
 

8121
02:35:54,920 --> 02:35:56,750
quite there I've tried it a few times
and I realize that there are things that

8122
02:35:56,750 --> 02:35:56,760
and I realize that there are things that
 

8123
02:35:56,760 --> 02:35:58,830
and I realize that there are things that
um uh where I have to start talking

8124
02:35:58,830 --> 02:35:58,840
um uh where I have to start talking
 

8125
02:35:58,840 --> 02:36:00,429
um uh where I have to start talking
about elaborate mathematical Concepts

8126
02:36:00,429 --> 02:36:00,439
about elaborate mathematical Concepts
 

8127
02:36:00,439 --> 02:36:02,269
about elaborate mathematical Concepts
and so on but I think and and you know

8128
02:36:02,269 --> 02:36:02,279
and so on but I think and and you know
 

8129
02:36:02,279 --> 02:36:04,110
and so on but I think and and you know
you got to realize it's not self-evident

8130
02:36:04,110 --> 02:36:04,120
you got to realize it's not self-evident
 

8131
02:36:04,120 --> 02:36:06,990
you got to realize it's not self-evident
that we can explain you know at an

8132
02:36:06,990 --> 02:36:07,000
that we can explain you know at an
 

8133
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,790
that we can explain you know at an
intuitively graspable level something

8134
02:36:09,790 --> 02:36:09,800
intuitively graspable level something
 

8135
02:36:09,800 --> 02:36:11,750
intuitively graspable level something
which uh you know about the way the

8136
02:36:11,750 --> 02:36:11,760
which uh you know about the way the
 

8137
02:36:11,760 --> 02:36:13,710
which uh you know about the way the
universe works the universe wasn't built

8138
02:36:13,710 --> 02:36:13,720
universe works the universe wasn't built
 

8139
02:36:13,720 --> 02:36:16,510
universe works the universe wasn't built
for our understanding so to speak um but

8140
02:36:16,510 --> 02:36:16,520
for our understanding so to speak um but
 

8141
02:36:16,520 --> 02:36:19,070
for our understanding so to speak um but
but I think then then um uh okay so

8142
02:36:19,070 --> 02:36:19,080
but I think then then um uh okay so
 

8143
02:36:19,080 --> 02:36:22,870
but I think then then um uh okay so
another important important idea is um

8144
02:36:22,870 --> 02:36:22,880
another important important idea is um
 

8145
02:36:22,880 --> 02:36:24,830
another important important idea is um
uh this idea of branchial space which I

8146
02:36:24,830 --> 02:36:24,840
uh this idea of branchial space which I
 

8147
02:36:24,840 --> 02:36:26,469
uh this idea of branchial space which I
mentioned this sort of space of quantum

8148
02:36:26,469 --> 02:36:26,479
mentioned this sort of space of quantum
 

8149
02:36:26,479 --> 02:36:29,870
mentioned this sort of space of quantum
states it is okay so I mentioned

8150
02:36:29,870 --> 02:36:29,880
states it is okay so I mentioned
 

8151
02:36:29,880 --> 02:36:32,790
states it is okay so I mentioned
Einstein's equations describing you know

8152
02:36:32,790 --> 02:36:32,800
Einstein's equations describing you know
 

8153
02:36:32,800 --> 02:36:36,389
Einstein's equations describing you know
the effect of uh the effect of mass and

8154
02:36:36,389 --> 02:36:36,399
the effect of uh the effect of mass and
 

8155
02:36:36,399 --> 02:36:39,550
the effect of uh the effect of mass and
energy on uh trajectories of particles

8156
02:36:39,550 --> 02:36:39,560
energy on uh trajectories of particles
 

8157
02:36:39,560 --> 02:36:42,750
energy on uh trajectories of particles
on gd6 the curvature of of um of

8158
02:36:42,750 --> 02:36:42,760
on gd6 the curvature of of um of
 

8159
02:36:42,760 --> 02:36:45,950
on gd6 the curvature of of um of
physical space is associated with uh the

8160
02:36:45,950 --> 02:36:45,960
physical space is associated with uh the
 

8161
02:36:45,960 --> 02:36:47,389
physical space is associated with uh the
presence of energy according to

8162
02:36:47,389 --> 02:36:47,399
presence of energy according to
 

8163
02:36:47,399 --> 02:36:50,750
presence of energy according to
Einstein's equations Okay so turns out

8164
02:36:50,750 --> 02:36:50,760
Einstein's equations Okay so turns out
 

8165
02:36:50,760 --> 02:36:52,790
Einstein's equations Okay so turns out
that rather amazingly the same thing is

8166
02:36:52,790 --> 02:36:52,800
that rather amazingly the same thing is
 

8167
02:36:52,800 --> 02:36:55,910
that rather amazingly the same thing is
true in branchial space so it turns out

8168
02:36:55,910 --> 02:36:55,920
true in branchial space so it turns out
 

8169
02:36:55,920 --> 02:36:57,750
true in branchial space so it turns out
the presence of energy or more

8170
02:36:57,750 --> 02:36:57,760
the presence of energy or more
 

8171
02:36:57,760 --> 02:36:59,830
the presence of energy or more
accurately lran density which is a kind

of relativistic invariant version of
 

8175
02:37:01,840 --> 02:37:05,750
of relativistic invariant version of
energy um the presence of that causes

8176
02:37:05,750 --> 02:37:05,760
energy um the presence of that causes
 

8177
02:37:05,760 --> 02:37:07,510
energy um the presence of that causes
essentially deflection of

02:37:07,510 --> 02:37:07,520
essentially deflection of
 

8179
02:37:07,520 --> 02:37:11,269
essentially deflection of
jd6 in this branchial space okay so you

8180
02:37:11,269 --> 02:37:11,279
jd6 in this branchial space okay so you
 

8181
02:37:11,279 --> 02:37:15,110
jd6 in this branchial space okay so you
might say so what Well turns out that

8182
02:37:15,110 --> 02:37:15,120
might say so what Well turns out that
 

8183
02:37:15,120 --> 02:37:17,269
might say so what Well turns out that
the sort of the best formulation we have

8184
02:37:17,269 --> 02:37:17,279
the sort of the best formulation we have
 

8185
02:37:17,279 --> 02:37:20,389
the sort of the best formulation we have
of quantum mechanics this the fine path

mathematics that can be interpreted as
 

8193
02:37:31,520 --> 02:37:33,590
mathematics that can be interpreted as
well in quantum mechanics the the big

8194
02:37:33,590 --> 02:37:33,600
well in quantum mechanics the the big
 

8195
02:37:33,600 --> 02:37:34,670
well in quantum mechanics the the big
thing is you get these Quantum

8196
02:37:34,670 --> 02:37:34,680
thing is you get these Quantum
 

8197
02:37:34,680 --> 02:37:36,790
thing is you get these Quantum
amplitudes which are complex numbers

8198
02:37:36,790 --> 02:37:36,800
amplitudes which are complex numbers
 

8199
02:37:36,800 --> 02:37:39,150
amplitudes which are complex numbers
that represent when you combine them

8200
02:37:39,150 --> 02:37:39,160
that represent when you combine them
 

8201
02:37:39,160 --> 02:37:40,429
that represent when you combine them
together represent probabilities of

8202
02:37:40,429 --> 02:37:40,439
together represent probabilities of
 

8203
02:37:40,439 --> 02:37:42,469
together represent probabilities of
things happening and so the big story

8204
02:37:42,469 --> 02:37:42,479
things happening and so the big story
 

8205
02:37:42,479 --> 02:37:44,309
things happening and so the big story
has been how do you derive these Quantum

8206
02:37:44,309 --> 02:37:44,319
has been how do you derive these Quantum
 

8207
02:37:44,319 --> 02:37:46,630
has been how do you derive these Quantum
amplitudes and people think these

8208
02:37:46,630 --> 02:37:46,640
amplitudes and people think these
 

8209
02:37:46,640 --> 02:37:48,349
amplitudes and people think these
Quantum amplitudes they have a complex

8210
02:37:48,349 --> 02:37:48,359
Quantum amplitudes they have a complex
 

8211
02:37:48,359 --> 02:37:50,389
Quantum amplitudes they have a complex
number has you know real part and

8212
02:37:50,389 --> 02:37:50,399
number has you know real part and
 

8213
02:37:50,399 --> 02:37:51,910
number has you know real part and
imaginary part you can also think of it

8214
02:37:51,910 --> 02:37:51,920
imaginary part you can also think of it
 

8215
02:37:51,920 --> 02:37:56,230
imaginary part you can also think of it
has a magnitude and a phase um and it um

8216
02:37:56,230 --> 02:37:56,240
has a magnitude and a phase um and it um
 

8217
02:37:56,240 --> 02:37:57,309
has a magnitude and a phase um and it um
people have sort of thought these

8218
02:37:57,309 --> 02:37:57,319
people have sort of thought these
 

8219
02:37:57,319 --> 02:37:58,870
people have sort of thought these
Quantum amplitudes have magnitude and

8220
02:37:58,870 --> 02:37:58,880
Quantum amplitudes have magnitude and
 

8221
02:37:58,880 --> 02:38:00,950
Quantum amplitudes have magnitude and
phase and you compute those together

8222
02:38:00,950 --> 02:38:00,960
phase and you compute those together
 

8223
02:38:00,960 --> 02:38:03,910
phase and you compute those together
turns out that magnitude the magnitude

8224
02:38:03,910 --> 02:38:03,920
turns out that magnitude the magnitude
 

8225
02:38:03,920 --> 02:38:05,190
turns out that magnitude the magnitude
and the phase come from completely

8226
02:38:05,190 --> 02:38:05,200
and the phase come from completely
 

8227
02:38:05,200 --> 02:38:08,630
and the phase come from completely
different places the magnitude comes

8228
02:38:08,630 --> 02:38:08,640
different places the magnitude comes
 

8229
02:38:08,640 --> 02:38:10,790
different places the magnitude comes
okay so what do you how do you compute

8230
02:38:10,790 --> 02:38:10,800
okay so what do you how do you compute
 

8231
02:38:10,800 --> 02:38:12,830
okay so what do you how do you compute
things in quantum mechanics roughly I'm

8232
02:38:12,830 --> 02:38:12,840
things in quantum mechanics roughly I'm
 

8233
02:38:12,840 --> 02:38:14,349
things in quantum mechanics roughly I'm
I'm telling you I'm I'm getting there to

8234
02:38:14,349 --> 02:38:14,359
I'm telling you I'm I'm getting there to
 

8235
02:38:14,359 --> 02:38:15,710
I'm telling you I'm I'm getting there to
be able to do this at a middle school

8236
02:38:15,710 --> 02:38:15,720
be able to do this at a middle school
 

8237
02:38:15,720 --> 02:38:18,590
be able to do this at a middle school
level but I'm not there yet um the the

8238
02:38:18,590 --> 02:38:18,600
level but I'm not there yet um the the
 

8239
02:38:18,600 --> 02:38:21,429
level but I'm not there yet um the the
roughly what happens is you're asking

8240
02:38:21,429 --> 02:38:21,439
roughly what happens is you're asking
 

8241
02:38:21,439 --> 02:38:25,030
roughly what happens is you're asking
does this state in quantum mechanics

8242
02:38:25,030 --> 02:38:25,040
does this state in quantum mechanics
 

8243
02:38:25,040 --> 02:38:26,870
does this state in quantum mechanics
evolve to this other state in quantum

8244
02:38:26,870 --> 02:38:26,880
evolve to this other state in quantum
 

8245
02:38:26,880 --> 02:38:29,230
evolve to this other state in quantum
mechanics and you can think about that

8246
02:38:29,230 --> 02:38:29,240
mechanics and you can think about that
 

8247
02:38:29,240 --> 02:38:31,830
mechanics and you can think about that
like a particle traveling or something

8248
02:38:31,830 --> 02:38:31,840
like a particle traveling or something
 

8249
02:38:31,840 --> 02:38:34,110
like a particle traveling or something
traveling through physical space but

8250
02:38:34,110 --> 02:38:34,120
traveling through physical space but
 

8251
02:38:34,120 --> 02:38:35,790
traveling through physical space but
instead it's traveling through branchial

8252
02:38:35,790 --> 02:38:35,800
instead it's traveling through branchial
 

8253
02:38:35,800 --> 02:38:38,110
instead it's traveling through branchial
space MH and so what's happening is does

8254
02:38:38,110 --> 02:38:38,120
space MH and so what's happening is does
 

8255
02:38:38,120 --> 02:38:40,030
space MH and so what's happening is does
this Quantum State evolve to this other

8256
02:38:40,030 --> 02:38:40,040
this Quantum State evolve to this other
 

8257
02:38:40,040 --> 02:38:42,110
this Quantum State evolve to this other
Quantum State it's like saying does this

8258
02:38:42,110 --> 02:38:42,120
Quantum State it's like saying does this
 

8259
02:38:42,120 --> 02:38:44,070
Quantum State it's like saying does this
object move from this place in space to

8260
02:38:44,070 --> 02:38:44,080
object move from this place in space to
 

8261
02:38:44,080 --> 02:38:47,110
object move from this place in space to
this other place in space okay now the

8262
02:38:47,110 --> 02:38:47,120
this other place in space okay now the
 

8263
02:38:47,120 --> 02:38:49,429
this other place in space okay now the
way that you these quantum amplitudes

8264
02:38:49,429 --> 02:38:49,439
way that you these quantum amplitudes
 

8265
02:38:49,439 --> 02:38:53,150
way that you these quantum amplitudes
udes characterize kind of um to what

8266
02:38:53,150 --> 02:38:53,160
udes characterize kind of um to what
 

8267
02:38:53,160 --> 02:38:55,550
udes characterize kind of um to what
extent the thing will successfully reach

8268
02:38:55,550 --> 02:38:55,560
extent the thing will successfully reach
 

8269
02:38:55,560 --> 02:38:57,230
extent the thing will successfully reach
some particular point in branchial space

8270
02:38:57,230 --> 02:38:57,240
some particular point in branchial space
 

8271
02:38:57,240 --> 02:38:58,750
some particular point in branchial space
just like in physical space you could

8272
02:38:58,750 --> 02:38:58,760
just like in physical space you could
 

8273
02:38:58,760 --> 02:39:00,950
just like in physical space you could
say oh it had a certain velocity and it

8274
02:39:00,950 --> 02:39:00,960
say oh it had a certain velocity and it
 

8275
02:39:00,960 --> 02:39:03,030
say oh it had a certain velocity and it
went in this direction in branchial

8276
02:39:03,030 --> 02:39:03,040
went in this direction in branchial
 

8277
02:39:03,040 --> 02:39:05,190
went in this direction in branchial
space there's a similar kind of concept

8278
02:39:05,190 --> 02:39:05,200
space there's a similar kind of concept
 

8279
02:39:05,200 --> 02:39:08,070
space there's a similar kind of concept
is there a nice way to visualize for me

8280
02:39:08,070 --> 02:39:08,080
is there a nice way to visualize for me
 

8281
02:39:08,080 --> 02:39:11,990
is there a nice way to visualize for me
now mentally Branch space it's just you

8282
02:39:11,990 --> 02:39:12,000
now mentally Branch space it's just you
 

8283
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,550
now mentally Branch space it's just you
have this hypergraph sorry you have this

8284
02:39:14,550 --> 02:39:14,560
have this hypergraph sorry you have this
 

8285
02:39:14,560 --> 02:39:16,830
have this hypergraph sorry you have this
multi-way graph it's this big branching

8286
02:39:16,830 --> 02:39:16,840
multi-way graph it's this big branching
 

8287
02:39:16,840 --> 02:39:18,790
multi-way graph it's this big branching
thing branching and merging thing but I

8288
02:39:18,790 --> 02:39:18,800
thing branching and merging thing but I
 

8289
02:39:18,800 --> 02:39:21,750
thing branching and merging thing but I
mean like moving through that space I

8290
02:39:21,750 --> 02:39:21,760
mean like moving through that space I
 

8291
02:39:21,760 --> 02:39:23,670
mean like moving through that space I
I'm just trying to understand what that

8292
02:39:23,670 --> 02:39:23,680
I'm just trying to understand what that
 

8293
02:39:23,680 --> 02:39:25,070
I'm just trying to understand what that
looks like

8294
02:39:25,070 --> 02:39:25,080
looks like
 

8295
02:39:25,080 --> 02:39:27,990
looks like
is you know that space is probably

8296
02:39:27,990 --> 02:39:28,000
is you know that space is probably
 

8297
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,469
is you know that space is probably
exponential dimensional which makes it

8298
02:39:30,469 --> 02:39:30,479
exponential dimensional which makes it
 

8299
02:39:30,479 --> 02:39:32,750
exponential dimensional which makes it
again another can of worms in

8300
02:39:32,750 --> 02:39:32,760
again another can of worms in
 

8301
02:39:32,760 --> 02:39:34,830
again another can of worms in
understanding what's going on that space

8302
02:39:34,830 --> 02:39:34,840
understanding what's going on that space
 

8303
02:39:34,840 --> 02:39:37,670
understanding what's going on that space
as in in ordinary space this hypergraph

8304
02:39:37,670 --> 02:39:37,680
as in in ordinary space this hypergraph
 

8305
02:39:37,680 --> 02:39:39,830
as in in ordinary space this hypergraph
the spatial hypergraph limits to

8306
02:39:39,830 --> 02:39:39,840
the spatial hypergraph limits to
 

8307
02:39:39,840 --> 02:39:42,830
the spatial hypergraph limits to
something which is like a manifold like

8308
02:39:42,830 --> 02:39:42,840
something which is like a manifold like
 

8309
02:39:42,840 --> 02:39:44,070
something which is like a manifold like
a like something like threedimensional

8310
02:39:44,070 --> 02:39:44,080
a like something like threedimensional
 

8311
02:39:44,080 --> 02:39:47,510
a like something like threedimensional
space almost certainly the multi-way

8312
02:39:47,510 --> 02:39:47,520
space almost certainly the multi-way
 

8313
02:39:47,520 --> 02:39:51,110
space almost certainly the multi-way
graph limits to a hbert space which is

8314
02:39:51,110 --> 02:39:51,120
graph limits to a hbert space which is
 

8315
02:39:51,120 --> 02:39:53,429
graph limits to a hbert space which is
something that I mean it's it's just a

8316
02:39:53,429 --> 02:39:53,439
something that I mean it's it's just a
 

8317
02:39:53,439 --> 02:39:55,590
something that I mean it's it's just a
weirder exponential dimensional space

8318
02:39:55,590 --> 02:39:55,600
weirder exponential dimensional space
 

8319
02:39:55,600 --> 02:39:57,510
weirder exponential dimensional space
and by the way you can ask I mean there

8320
02:39:57,510 --> 02:39:57,520
and by the way you can ask I mean there
 

8321
02:39:57,520 --> 02:39:59,030
and by the way you can ask I mean there
are much weirder things that go on for

8322
02:39:59,030 --> 02:39:59,040
are much weirder things that go on for
 

8323
02:39:59,040 --> 02:40:00,150
are much weirder things that go on for
example one of the things I've been

8324
02:40:00,150 --> 02:40:00,160
example one of the things I've been
 

8325
02:40:00,160 --> 02:40:02,030
example one of the things I've been
interested in is the expansion of the

8326
02:40:02,030 --> 02:40:02,040
interested in is the expansion of the
 

8327
02:40:02,040 --> 02:40:04,349
interested in is the expansion of the
universe in branchial space so we know

8328
02:40:04,349 --> 02:40:04,359
universe in branchial space so we know
 

8329
02:40:04,359 --> 02:40:06,110
universe in branchial space so we know
the universe is expanding in physical

8330
02:40:06,110 --> 02:40:06,120
the universe is expanding in physical
 

8331
02:40:06,120 --> 02:40:08,590
the universe is expanding in physical
space but the universe is probably also

8332
02:40:08,590 --> 02:40:08,600
space but the universe is probably also
 

8333
02:40:08,600 --> 02:40:11,830
space but the universe is probably also
expanding in BR space so that means the

8334
02:40:11,830 --> 02:40:11,840
expanding in BR space so that means the
 

8335
02:40:11,840 --> 02:40:13,469
expanding in BR space so that means the
the number of quantum states of the

8336
02:40:13,469 --> 02:40:13,479
the number of quantum states of the
 

8337
02:40:13,479 --> 02:40:15,950
the number of quantum states of the
universe is increasing with time the

8338
02:40:15,950 --> 02:40:15,960
universe is increasing with time the
 

8339
02:40:15,960 --> 02:40:18,150
universe is increasing with time the
diameter of the thing is growing right

8340
02:40:18,150 --> 02:40:18,160
diameter of the thing is growing right
 

8341
02:40:18,160 --> 02:40:20,469
diameter of the thing is growing right
so that means that the and and by the

8342
02:40:20,469 --> 02:40:20,479
so that means that the and and by the
 

8343
02:40:20,479 --> 02:40:23,309
so that means that the and and by the
way uh this is related to whether

8344
02:40:23,309 --> 02:40:23,319
way uh this is related to whether
 

8345
02:40:23,319 --> 02:40:25,190
way uh this is related to whether
Quantum Computing can ever

8346
02:40:25,190 --> 02:40:25,200
Quantum Computing can ever
 

8347
02:40:25,200 --> 02:40:29,469
Quantum Computing can ever
work um and uh uh why okay so let me

8348
02:40:29,469 --> 02:40:29,479
work um and uh uh why okay so let me
 

8349
02:40:29,479 --> 02:40:32,190
work um and uh uh why okay so let me
explain why so so let's talk about okay

8350
02:40:32,190 --> 02:40:32,200
explain why so so let's talk about okay
 

8351
02:40:32,200 --> 02:40:33,750
explain why so so let's talk about okay
so first of all just just to finish the

8352
02:40:33,750 --> 02:40:33,760
so first of all just just to finish the
 

8353
02:40:33,760 --> 02:40:35,710
so first of all just just to finish the
thought about Quantum amplitudes the the

8354
02:40:35,710 --> 02:40:35,720
thought about Quantum amplitudes the the
 

8355
02:40:35,720 --> 02:40:38,389
thought about Quantum amplitudes the the
incredibly beautiful thing just this is

8356
02:40:38,389 --> 02:40:38,399
incredibly beautiful thing just this is
 

8357
02:40:38,399 --> 02:40:40,790
incredibly beautiful thing just this is
just I'm just very excited about this

8358
02:40:40,790 --> 02:40:40,800
just I'm just very excited about this
 

8359
02:40:40,800 --> 02:40:43,950
just I'm just very excited about this
the the um the F path integral is is

8360
02:40:43,950 --> 02:40:43,960
the the um the F path integral is is
 

8361
02:40:43,960 --> 02:40:46,469
the the um the F path integral is is
this formula it says that the amplitude

8362
02:40:46,469 --> 02:40:46,479
this formula it says that the amplitude
 

8363
02:40:46,479 --> 02:40:48,349
this formula it says that the amplitude
the quantum amplitude is e to the i s

8364
02:40:48,349 --> 02:40:48,359
the quantum amplitude is e to the i s
 

8365
02:40:48,359 --> 02:40:50,510
the quantum amplitude is e to the i s
overh bar where s is the thing called

8366
02:40:50,510 --> 02:40:50,520
overh bar where s is the thing called
 

8367
02:40:50,520 --> 02:40:54,630
overh bar where s is the thing called
the action and um it uh okay so that can

8368
02:40:54,630 --> 02:40:54,640
the action and um it uh okay so that can
 

8369
02:40:54,640 --> 02:40:57,110
the action and um it uh okay so that can
be thought of as representing a

8370
02:40:57,110 --> 02:40:57,120
be thought of as representing a
 

8371
02:40:57,120 --> 02:41:00,870
be thought of as representing a
deflection of the angle of this path in

8372
02:41:00,870 --> 02:41:00,880
deflection of the angle of this path in
 

8373
02:41:00,880 --> 02:41:03,030
deflection of the angle of this path in
the multi-way graph so it's a deflection

8374
02:41:03,030 --> 02:41:03,040
the multi-way graph so it's a deflection
 

8375
02:41:03,040 --> 02:41:05,389
the multi-way graph so it's a deflection
of a jisc in the multi-way path that is

8376
02:41:05,389 --> 02:41:05,399
of a jisc in the multi-way path that is
 

8377
02:41:05,399 --> 02:41:06,990
of a jisc in the multi-way path that is
caused by this thing called the action

8378
02:41:06,990 --> 02:41:07,000
caused by this thing called the action
 

8379
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:08,469
caused by this thing called the action
which is essentially associated with

8380
02:41:08,469 --> 02:41:08,479
which is essentially associated with
 

8381
02:41:08,479 --> 02:41:11,429
which is essentially associated with
energy okay and so this is a deflection

8382
02:41:11,429 --> 02:41:11,439
energy okay and so this is a deflection
 

8383
02:41:11,439 --> 02:41:14,150
energy okay and so this is a deflection
of a path in branchial space that is

8384
02:41:14,150 --> 02:41:14,160
of a path in branchial space that is
 

8385
02:41:14,160 --> 02:41:15,870
of a path in branchial space that is
described by this path integral which is

8386
02:41:15,870 --> 02:41:15,880
described by this path integral which is
 

8387
02:41:15,880 --> 02:41:17,389
described by this path integral which is
the thing that is the mathematical

8388
02:41:17,389 --> 02:41:17,399
the thing that is the mathematical
 

8389
02:41:17,399 --> 02:41:20,630
the thing that is the mathematical
essence of quantum mechanics m turns out

8390
02:41:20,630 --> 02:41:20,640
essence of quantum mechanics m turns out
 

8391
02:41:20,640 --> 02:41:23,830
essence of quantum mechanics m turns out
that deflection is the deflection of gd6

8392
02:41:23,830 --> 02:41:23,840
that deflection is the deflection of gd6
 

8393
02:41:23,840 --> 02:41:26,510
that deflection is the deflection of gd6
and branchial space follows the exact

8394
02:41:26,510 --> 02:41:26,520
and branchial space follows the exact
 

8395
02:41:26,520 --> 02:41:29,070
and branchial space follows the exact
same mathematical setup as the

8396
02:41:29,070 --> 02:41:29,080
same mathematical setup as the
 

8397
02:41:29,080 --> 02:41:31,990
same mathematical setup as the
deflection of gd6 in physical space

8398
02:41:31,990 --> 02:41:32,000
deflection of gd6 in physical space
 

8399
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:33,910
deflection of gd6 in physical space
except the deflection of gd6 in physical

8400
02:41:33,910 --> 02:41:33,920
except the deflection of gd6 in physical
 

8401
02:41:33,920 --> 02:41:35,510
except the deflection of gd6 in physical
space is described with Einstein's

8402
02:41:35,510 --> 02:41:35,520
space is described with Einstein's
 

8403
02:41:35,520 --> 02:41:37,790

equations the deflection of gd6 and

8404
02:41:37,790 --> 02:41:37,800
equations the deflection of gd6 and
 

8405
02:41:37,800 --> 02:41:39,830
equations the deflection of gd6 and
branchial space is defined by the F and

8406
02:41:39,830 --> 02:41:39,840
branchial space is defined by the F and
 

8407
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:42,870
branchial space is defined by the F and
path integral and they are the same in

8408
02:41:42,870 --> 02:41:42,880
path integral and they are the same in
 

8409
02:41:42,880 --> 02:41:44,950
path integral and they are the same in
other words they are mathematically the

other words they are mathematically the
 

8411
02:41:44,960 --> 02:41:47,349
other words they are mathematically the
same so that means that general

02:41:47,349 --> 02:41:47,359
same so that means that general
 

8413
02:41:47,359 --> 02:41:50,590

underlying equation for those two things
 

8423
02:42:01,319 --> 02:42:02,550
underlying equation for those two things
although it's presented differently

8424
02:42:02,550 --> 02:42:02,560
although it's presented differently
 

8425
02:42:02,560 --> 02:42:03,830
although it's presented differently
because one's interested in different

8426
02:42:03,830 --> 02:42:03,840
because one's interested in different
 

8427
02:42:03,840 --> 02:42:05,389
because one's interested in different
things in branchial space and physical

8428
02:42:05,389 --> 02:42:05,399
things in branchial space and physical
 

8429
02:42:05,399 --> 02:42:07,870
things in branchial space and physical
space but the underlying equation is the

8430
02:42:07,870 --> 02:42:07,880
space but the underlying equation is the
 

8431
02:42:07,880 --> 02:42:11,389
space but the underlying equation is the
same so in other words it's the this

8432
02:42:11,389 --> 02:42:11,399
same so in other words it's the this
 

8433
02:42:11,399 --> 02:42:13,429
same so in other words it's the this
it's just you know these two theories

8434
02:42:13,429 --> 02:42:13,439
it's just you know these two theories
 

8435
02:42:13,439 --> 02:42:14,710
it's just you know these two theories
which are the two sort of pillars of

8436
02:42:14,710 --> 02:42:14,720
which are the two sort of pillars of
 

8437
02:42:14,720 --> 02:42:17,030
which are the two sort of pillars of
20th century physics which have seemed

8438
02:42:17,030 --> 02:42:17,040
20th century physics which have seemed
 

8439
02:42:17,040 --> 02:42:19,349
20th century physics which have seemed
to be off in different directions are

8440
02:42:19,349 --> 02:42:19,359
to be off in different directions are
 

8441
02:42:19,359 --> 02:42:22,309
to be off in different directions are
actually facets of the exact same Theory

8442
02:42:22,309 --> 02:42:22,319
actually facets of the exact same Theory
 

8443
02:42:22,319 --> 02:42:25,269
actually facets of the exact same Theory
there and this I mean that's exciting to

8444
02:42:25,269 --> 02:42:25,279
there and this I mean that's exciting to
 

8445
02:42:25,279 --> 02:42:27,150
there and this I mean that's exciting to
see to see where that evolves and

8446
02:42:27,150 --> 02:42:27,160
see to see where that evolves and
 

8447
02:42:27,160 --> 02:42:29,510
see to see where that evolves and
exciting that that just is there right I

8448
02:42:29,510 --> 02:42:29,520
exciting that that just is there right I
 

8449
02:42:29,520 --> 02:42:32,309
exciting that that just is there right I
mean to me you know look I having spent

8450
02:42:32,309 --> 02:42:32,319
mean to me you know look I having spent
 

8451
02:42:32,319 --> 02:42:34,429
mean to me you know look I having spent
some part of my early life you know

8452
02:42:34,429 --> 02:42:34,439
some part of my early life you know
 

8453
02:42:34,439 --> 02:42:36,349
some part of my early life you know
working in these in the context of these

8454
02:42:36,349 --> 02:42:36,359
working in these in the context of these
 

8455
02:42:36,359 --> 02:42:38,429
working in these in the context of these
theories of of you know 20th century

8456
02:42:38,429 --> 02:42:38,439
theories of of you know 20th century
 

8457
02:42:38,439 --> 02:42:41,110
theories of of you know 20th century
physics it's they just they seem so

8458
02:42:41,110 --> 02:42:41,120
physics it's they just they seem so
 

8459
02:42:41,120 --> 02:42:42,750
physics it's they just they seem so
different and the fact that they're

8460
02:42:42,750 --> 02:42:42,760
different and the fact that they're
 

8461
02:42:42,760 --> 02:42:46,469
different and the fact that they're
really the same is just really amazing

8462
02:42:46,469 --> 02:42:46,479
really the same is just really amazing
 

8463
02:42:46,479 --> 02:42:48,070
really the same is just really amazing
actually let me you you mentioned double

8464
02:42:48,070 --> 02:42:48,080
actually let me you you mentioned double
 

8465
02:42:48,080 --> 02:42:49,830
actually let me you you mentioned double
slit experiment okay so the double

8466
02:42:49,830 --> 02:42:49,840
slit experiment okay so the double
 

8467
02:42:49,840 --> 02:42:51,870
slit experiment okay so the double
experiment is a is an interference

8468
02:42:51,870 --> 02:42:51,880
experiment is a is an interference
 

8469
02:42:51,880 --> 02:42:54,230
experiment is a is an interference
phenomenon where you say there are you

8470
02:42:54,230 --> 02:42:54,240
phenomenon where you say there are you
 

8471
02:42:54,240 --> 02:42:55,590
phenomenon where you say there are you
know you can have a photon or an

8472
02:42:55,590 --> 02:42:55,600
know you can have a photon or an
 

8473
02:42:55,600 --> 02:42:57,630
know you can have a photon or an
electron and you say there are these two

8474
02:42:57,630 --> 02:42:57,640
electron and you say there are these two
 

8475
02:42:57,640 --> 02:42:59,510
electron and you say there are these two
slits it could have gone through either

8476
02:42:59,510 --> 02:42:59,520
slits it could have gone through either
 

8477
02:42:59,520 --> 02:43:02,190
slits it could have gone through either
one but there is this interference

8478
02:43:02,190 --> 02:43:02,200
one but there is this interference
 

8479
02:43:02,200 --> 02:43:04,389
one but there is this interference
pattern where it's there's destructive

8480
02:43:04,389 --> 02:43:04,399
pattern where it's there's destructive
 

8481
02:43:04,399 --> 02:43:06,190
pattern where it's there's destructive
interference where you might have said

8482
02:43:06,190 --> 02:43:06,200
interference where you might have said
 

8483
02:43:06,200 --> 02:43:08,150
interference where you might have said
in classical physics oh well if if there

8484
02:43:08,150 --> 02:43:08,160
in classical physics oh well if if there
 

8485
02:43:08,160 --> 02:43:10,030
in classical physics oh well if if there
are two slits then there's a better

8486
02:43:10,030 --> 02:43:10,040
are two slits then there's a better
 

8487
02:43:10,040 --> 02:43:11,309
are two slits then there's a better
chance that it gets through one or the

8488
02:43:11,309 --> 02:43:11,319
chance that it gets through one or the
 

8489
02:43:11,319 --> 02:43:13,230
chance that it gets through one or the
other of them but in quantum mechanics

8490
02:43:13,230 --> 02:43:13,240
other of them but in quantum mechanics
 

8491
02:43:13,240 --> 02:43:14,710
other of them but in quantum mechanics
there's this phenomenon of destructive

8492
02:43:14,710 --> 02:43:14,720
there's this phenomenon of destructive
 

8493
02:43:14,720 --> 02:43:16,670
there's this phenomenon of destructive
interference that means that even though

8494
02:43:16,670 --> 02:43:16,680
interference that means that even though
 

8495
02:43:16,680 --> 02:43:19,269
interference that means that even though
there are two slits two can lead to

8496
02:43:19,269 --> 02:43:19,279
there are two slits two can lead to
 

8497
02:43:19,279 --> 02:43:22,030
there are two slits two can lead to
nothing as opposed to two leading to

8498
02:43:22,030 --> 02:43:22,040
nothing as opposed to two leading to
 

8499
02:43:22,040 --> 02:43:25,750
nothing as opposed to two leading to
more than than for example one slit and

8500
02:43:25,750 --> 02:43:25,760
more than than for example one slit and
 

8501
02:43:25,760 --> 02:43:27,790
more than than for example one slit and
in what happens in this model and we've

8502
02:43:27,790 --> 02:43:27,800
in what happens in this model and we've
 

8503
02:43:27,800 --> 02:43:29,309
in what happens in this model and we've
just been understanding this in the last

8504
02:43:29,309 --> 02:43:29,319
just been understanding this in the last
 

8505
02:43:29,319 --> 02:43:33,309
just been understanding this in the last
few weeks actually is that the um what

8506
02:43:33,309 --> 02:43:33,319
few weeks actually is that the um what
 

8507
02:43:33,319 --> 02:43:36,990
few weeks actually is that the um what
essentially happens is that the the

8508
02:43:36,990 --> 02:43:37,000
essentially happens is that the the
 

8509
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:38,830
essentially happens is that the the
double slit experiment is a story of the

8510
02:43:38,830 --> 02:43:38,840
double slit experiment is a story of the
 

8511
02:43:38,840 --> 02:43:40,710
double slit experiment is a story of the
interface between branchial space and

8512
02:43:40,710 --> 02:43:40,720
interface between branchial space and
 

8513
02:43:40,720 --> 02:43:42,670
interface between branchial space and
physical space and what's essentially

8514
02:43:42,670 --> 02:43:42,680
physical space and what's essentially
 

8515
02:43:42,680 --> 02:43:44,790
physical space and what's essentially
happening is that the destructive

8516
02:43:44,790 --> 02:43:44,800
happening is that the destructive
 

8517
02:43:44,800 --> 02:43:47,510
happening is that the destructive
interference is the result of the two

8518
02:43:47,510 --> 02:43:47,520
interference is the result of the two
 

8519
02:43:47,520 --> 02:43:49,469
interference is the result of the two
possible paths associated with photons

8520
02:43:49,469 --> 02:43:49,479
possible paths associated with photons
 

8521
02:43:49,479 --> 02:43:51,710
possible paths associated with photons
going through those two slits winding up

8522
02:43:51,710 --> 02:43:51,720
going through those two slits winding up
 

8523
02:43:51,720 --> 02:43:54,269
going through those two slits winding up
at opposite ends of branchial space and

8524
02:43:54,269 --> 02:43:54,279
at opposite ends of branchial space and
 

8525
02:43:54,279 --> 02:43:56,070
at opposite ends of branchial space and
so they don't and so that's why there's

8526
02:43:56,070 --> 02:43:56,080
so they don't and so that's why there's
 

8527
02:43:56,080 --> 02:43:57,750
so they don't and so that's why there's
sort of nothing there when you look at

8528
02:43:57,750 --> 02:43:57,760
sort of nothing there when you look at
 

8529
02:43:57,760 --> 02:44:00,910
sort of nothing there when you look at
it is because these two different sort

8530
02:44:00,910 --> 02:44:00,920
it is because these two different sort
 

8531
02:44:00,920 --> 02:44:03,910
it is because these two different sort
of branches couldn't get merged together

8532
02:44:03,910 --> 02:44:03,920
of branches couldn't get merged together
 

8533
02:44:03,920 --> 02:44:05,550
of branches couldn't get merged together
to produce something that you can

8534
02:44:05,550 --> 02:44:05,560
to produce something that you can
 

8535
02:44:05,560 --> 02:44:08,670
to produce something that you can
measure in physical space is there a lot

8536
02:44:08,670 --> 02:44:08,680
measure in physical space is there a lot
 

8537
02:44:08,680 --> 02:44:10,670
measure in physical space is there a lot
to be understood about brancho space

8538
02:44:10,670 --> 02:44:10,680
to be understood about brancho space
 

8539
02:44:10,680 --> 02:44:11,510
to be understood about brancho space
like

8540
02:44:11,510 --> 02:44:11,520
like
 

8541
02:44:11,520 --> 02:44:14,590
like
is mathematically speaking yes it's a

8542
02:44:14,590 --> 02:44:14,600
is mathematically speaking yes it's a
 

8543
02:44:14,600 --> 02:44:16,550
is mathematically speaking yes it's a
very beautiful mathematical thing and

8544
02:44:16,550 --> 02:44:16,560
very beautiful mathematical thing and
 

8545
02:44:16,560 --> 02:44:19,910
very beautiful mathematical thing and
it's very I mean by the way this whole

8546
02:44:19,910 --> 02:44:19,920
it's very I mean by the way this whole
 

8547
02:44:19,920 --> 02:44:22,510
it's very I mean by the way this whole
is just amazingly rich in terms of the

8548
02:44:22,510 --> 02:44:22,520
is just amazingly rich in terms of the
 

8549
02:44:22,520 --> 02:44:24,990
is just amazingly rich in terms of the
mathematics that it says should exist

8550
02:44:24,990 --> 02:44:25,000
mathematics that it says should exist
 

8551
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,790
mathematics that it says should exist
okay so for example calculus you know is

8552
02:44:27,790 --> 02:44:27,800
okay so for example calculus you know is
 

8553
02:44:27,800 --> 02:44:30,670
okay so for example calculus you know is
a story of infinite decimal change in

two- dimensional threedimensional space
 

8559
02:44:34,880 --> 02:44:37,910
two- dimensional threedimensional space
we need a theory of infinitesimal change

8560
02:44:37,910 --> 02:44:37,920
we need a theory of infinitesimal change
 

8561
02:44:37,920 --> 02:44:39,830
we need a theory of infinitesimal change
in fractional dimensional and dynamic

so there's a tools of mathematics that

8566
02:44:44,190 --> 02:44:44,200
so there's a tools of mathematics that
 

8567
02:44:44,200 --> 02:44:45,990
so there's a tools of mathematics that
are needed here right and this is a

8568
02:44:45,990 --> 02:44:46,000
are needed here right and this is a
 

8569
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:47,469
are needed here right and this is a
motivation for that actually right and

8570
02:44:47,469 --> 02:44:47,479
motivation for that actually right and
 

8571
02:44:47,479 --> 02:44:49,590
motivation for that actually right and
it's it's you know there are there are

8572
02:44:49,590 --> 02:44:49,600
it's it's you know there are there are
 

8573
02:44:49,600 --> 02:44:51,230
it's it's you know there are there are
indications and we can do computer

8574
02:44:51,230 --> 02:44:51,240
indications and we can do computer
 

8575
02:44:51,240 --> 02:44:52,389
indications and we can do computer
experiments and we can see how it's

8576
02:44:52,389 --> 02:44:52,399
experiments and we can see how it's
 

8577
02:44:52,399 --> 02:44:54,550
experiments and we can see how it's
going to come out but we need to you

8578
02:44:54,550 --> 02:44:54,560
going to come out but we need to you
 

8579
02:44:54,560 --> 02:44:56,510
going to come out but we need to you
know that the actual mathematics is

8580
02:44:56,510 --> 02:44:56,520
know that the actual mathematics is
 

8581
02:44:56,520 --> 02:44:58,870
know that the actual mathematics is
doesn't doesn't exist and in branchial

8582
02:44:58,870 --> 02:44:58,880
doesn't doesn't exist and in branchial
 

8583
02:44:58,880 --> 02:45:01,030
doesn't doesn't exist and in branchial
space it's actually even worse there's

8584
02:45:01,030 --> 02:45:01,040
space it's actually even worse there's
 

8585
02:45:01,040 --> 02:45:02,790
space it's actually even worse there's
there's even more sort of layers of

8586
02:45:02,790 --> 02:45:02,800
there's even more sort of layers of
 

8587
02:45:02,800 --> 02:45:05,230
there's even more sort of layers of
mathematics that are you know we can see

8588
02:45:05,230 --> 02:45:05,240
mathematics that are you know we can see
 

8589
02:45:05,240 --> 02:45:06,990
mathematics that are you know we can see
how it works roughly by doing computer

8590
02:45:06,990 --> 02:45:07,000
how it works roughly by doing computer
 

8591
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:10,070
how it works roughly by doing computer
experiments but to really understand it

8592
02:45:10,070 --> 02:45:10,080
experiments but to really understand it
 

8593
02:45:10,080 --> 02:45:12,309
experiments but to really understand it
we need more more sort of mathematical

8594
02:45:12,309 --> 02:45:12,319
we need more more sort of mathematical
 

8595
02:45:12,319 --> 02:45:15,309
we need more more sort of mathematical
sophistication so quantum computers okay

8596
02:45:15,309 --> 02:45:15,319
sophistication so quantum computers okay
 

8597
02:45:15,319 --> 02:45:17,830
sophistication so quantum computers okay
so the basic idea of quantum computers

8598
02:45:17,830 --> 02:45:17,840
so the basic idea of quantum computers
 

8599
02:45:17,840 --> 02:45:20,790
so the basic idea of quantum computers
the the promise of quantum computers is

8600
02:45:20,790 --> 02:45:20,800
the the promise of quantum computers is
 

8601
02:45:20,800 --> 02:45:22,710
the the promise of quantum computers is
quantum mechanics does things in

8602
02:45:22,710 --> 02:45:22,720
quantum mechanics does things in
 

8603
02:45:22,720 --> 02:45:25,469
quantum mechanics does things in
parallel and so you can sort of

8604
02:45:25,469 --> 02:45:25,479
parallel and so you can sort of
 

8605
02:45:25,479 --> 02:45:27,070
parallel and so you can sort of
intrinsically do computations in

8606
02:45:27,070 --> 02:45:27,080
intrinsically do computations in
 

8607
02:45:27,080 --> 02:45:28,990
intrinsically do computations in
parallel and somehow that can be much

8608
02:45:28,990 --> 02:45:29,000
parallel and somehow that can be much
 

8609
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,830
parallel and somehow that can be much
more efficient than just doing them uh

8610
02:45:31,830 --> 02:45:31,840
more efficient than just doing them uh
 

8611
02:45:31,840 --> 02:45:34,230
more efficient than just doing them uh
one after another and you know I

8612
02:45:34,230 --> 02:45:34,240
one after another and you know I
 

8613
02:45:34,240 --> 02:45:35,950
one after another and you know I
actually worked on Quantum Computing a

8614
02:45:35,950 --> 02:45:35,960
actually worked on Quantum Computing a
 

8615
02:45:35,960 --> 02:45:40,670
actually worked on Quantum Computing a
bit with dick fan back in 1981 2 3 um

8616
02:45:40,670 --> 02:45:40,680
bit with dick fan back in 1981 2 3 um
 

8617
02:45:40,680 --> 02:45:42,230
bit with dick fan back in 1981 2 3 um
that kind of time frame and and we a

8618
02:45:42,230 --> 02:45:42,240
that kind of time frame and and we a
 

8619
02:45:42,240 --> 02:45:44,990
that kind of time frame and and we a
fascinating image you you and findan

8620
02:45:44,990 --> 02:45:45,000
fascinating image you you and findan
 

8621
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,110
fascinating image you you and findan
work on quantum computers well we we

8622
02:45:47,110 --> 02:45:47,120
work on quantum computers well we we
 

8623
02:45:47,120 --> 02:45:48,510
work on quantum computers well we we
tried to work the the big thing we tried

8624
02:45:48,510 --> 02:45:48,520
tried to work the the big thing we tried
 

8625
02:45:48,520 --> 02:45:51,070
tried to work the the big thing we tried
to do was invent a Randomness chip that

8626
02:45:51,070 --> 02:45:51,080
to do was invent a Randomness chip that
 

8627
02:45:51,080 --> 02:45:52,790
to do was invent a Randomness chip that
would generate Randomness at a high

8628
02:45:52,790 --> 02:45:52,800
would generate Randomness at a high
 

8629
02:45:52,800 --> 02:45:56,110
would generate Randomness at a high
speed using quantum mechanics and the

8630
02:45:56,110 --> 02:45:56,120
speed using quantum mechanics and the
 

8631
02:45:56,120 --> 02:45:57,550
speed using quantum mechanics and the
discovery that that wasn't really

8632
02:45:57,550 --> 02:45:57,560
discovery that that wasn't really
 

8633
02:45:57,560 --> 02:46:00,950
discovery that that wasn't really
possible uh was part of the um the story

8634
02:46:00,950 --> 02:46:00,960
possible uh was part of the um the story
 

8635
02:46:00,960 --> 02:46:02,750
possible uh was part of the um the story
of we never really wrote anything about

8636
02:46:02,750 --> 02:46:02,760
of we never really wrote anything about
 

8637
02:46:02,760 --> 02:46:04,309
of we never really wrote anything about
it I think maybe he wrote some stuff but

8638
02:46:04,309 --> 02:46:04,319
it I think maybe he wrote some stuff but
 

8639
02:46:04,319 --> 02:46:06,190
it I think maybe he wrote some stuff but
I we didn't we didn't write stuff about

8640
02:46:06,190 --> 02:46:06,200
I we didn't we didn't write stuff about
 

8641
02:46:06,200 --> 02:46:08,590
I we didn't we didn't write stuff about
what we figured out about sort of the

8642
02:46:08,590 --> 02:46:08,600
what we figured out about sort of the
 

8643
02:46:08,600 --> 02:46:10,070
what we figured out about sort of the
fact that it really seemed like the

8644
02:46:10,070 --> 02:46:10,080
fact that it really seemed like the
 

8645
02:46:10,080 --> 02:46:12,190
fact that it really seemed like the
measurement process in quantum mechanics

8646
02:46:12,190 --> 02:46:12,200
measurement process in quantum mechanics
 

8647
02:46:12,200 --> 02:46:14,269
measurement process in quantum mechanics
was a serious damper on what was

8648
02:46:14,269 --> 02:46:14,279
was a serious damper on what was
 

8649
02:46:14,279 --> 02:46:17,309
was a serious damper on what was
possible to do in sort of you know the

8650
02:46:17,309 --> 02:46:17,319
possible to do in sort of you know the
 

8651
02:46:17,319 --> 02:46:18,910
possible to do in sort of you know the
possible advantages of quantum mechanics

8652
02:46:18,910 --> 02:46:18,920
possible advantages of quantum mechanics
 

8653
02:46:18,920 --> 02:46:22,070
possible advantages of quantum mechanics
mecs and for computing but anyway so so

8654
02:46:22,070 --> 02:46:22,080
mecs and for computing but anyway so so
 

8655
02:46:22,080 --> 02:46:23,429
mecs and for computing but anyway so so
the the the sort of the promise of

8656
02:46:23,429 --> 02:46:23,439
the the the sort of the promise of
 

8657
02:46:23,439 --> 02:46:26,070
the the the sort of the promise of
quantum Computing is let's say you're

8658
02:46:26,070 --> 02:46:26,080
quantum Computing is let's say you're
 

8659
02:46:26,080 --> 02:46:28,269
quantum Computing is let's say you're
trying to you know Factor an integer

8660
02:46:28,269 --> 02:46:28,279
trying to you know Factor an integer
 

8661
02:46:28,279 --> 02:46:30,030
trying to you know Factor an integer
well you can instead of you know when

8662
02:46:30,030 --> 02:46:30,040
well you can instead of you know when
 

8663
02:46:30,040 --> 02:46:31,710
well you can instead of you know when
you factor an integer you might say well

8664
02:46:31,710 --> 02:46:31,720
you factor an integer you might say well
 

8665
02:46:31,720 --> 02:46:33,150
you factor an integer you might say well
does this Factor work does this Factor

8666
02:46:33,150 --> 02:46:33,160
does this Factor work does this Factor
 

8667
02:46:33,160 --> 02:46:35,910
does this Factor work does this Factor
work does this Factor work um in

work does this Factor work um in
 

8669
02:46:35,920 --> 02:46:37,710
work does this Factor work um in
ordinary Computing it seems like we

8670
02:46:37,710 --> 02:46:37,720
ordinary Computing it seems like we
 

8671
02:46:37,720 --> 02:46:39,269
ordinary Computing it seems like we
pretty much just have to try all these

8672
02:46:39,269 --> 02:46:39,279
pretty much just have to try all these
 

8673
02:46:39,279 --> 02:46:41,790
pretty much just have to try all these
different factors um you know kind of

8674
02:46:41,790 --> 02:46:41,800
different factors um you know kind of
 

8675
02:46:41,800 --> 02:46:43,630
different factors um you know kind of
one after another but in quantum

8676
02:46:43,630 --> 02:46:43,640
one after another but in quantum
 

8677
02:46:43,640 --> 02:46:45,389
one after another but in quantum
mechanics you might have the idea oh you

8678
02:46:45,389 --> 02:46:45,399
mechanics you might have the idea oh you

02:46:45,399 --> 02:46:48,510
mechanics you might have the idea oh you
can just sort of have the physics try

8680
02:46:48,510 --> 02:46:48,520
can just sort of have the physics try
 

8681
02:46:48,520 --> 02:46:52,870
can just sort of have the physics try
all of them in parallel mhm okay and um

8682
02:46:52,870 --> 02:46:52,880
all of them in parallel mhm okay and um
 

8683
02:46:52,880 --> 02:46:54,790
all of them in parallel mhm okay and um
the you know and there's this algorithm

8684
02:46:54,790 --> 02:46:54,800
the you know and there's this algorithm
 

8685
02:46:54,800 --> 02:46:58,190
the you know and there's this algorithm
shaes algorithm which which uh allows

8686
02:46:58,190 --> 02:46:58,200
shaes algorithm which which uh allows
 

8687
02:46:58,200 --> 02:46:59,750
shaes algorithm which which uh allows
you according to the formalism of

8688
02:46:59,750 --> 02:46:59,760
you according to the formalism of
 

8689
02:46:59,760 --> 02:47:01,790
you according to the formalism of
quantum mechanics to do everything in

8690
02:47:01,790 --> 02:47:01,800
quantum mechanics to do everything in
 

8691
02:47:01,800 --> 02:47:03,429
quantum mechanics to do everything in
parallel and to do it much faster than

8692
02:47:03,429 --> 02:47:03,439
parallel and to do it much faster than
 

8693
02:47:03,439 --> 02:47:06,269
parallel and to do it much faster than
you can on a classical computer okay the

8694
02:47:06,269 --> 02:47:06,279
you can on a classical computer okay the
 

8695
02:47:06,279 --> 02:47:08,429
you can on a classical computer okay the
only little footnote is you have to

8696
02:47:08,429 --> 02:47:08,439
only little footnote is you have to
 

8697
02:47:08,439 --> 02:47:10,030
only little footnote is you have to
figure out what the answer is you have

8698
02:47:10,030 --> 02:47:10,040
figure out what the answer is you have
 

8699
02:47:10,040 --> 02:47:12,389
figure out what the answer is you have
to measure the result so the quantum

8700
02:47:12,389 --> 02:47:12,399
to measure the result so the quantum
 

8701
02:47:12,399 --> 02:47:14,030
to measure the result so the quantum
mechanics internally has figured out all

8702
02:47:14,030 --> 02:47:14,040
mechanics internally has figured out all
 

8703
02:47:14,040 --> 02:47:15,790
mechanics internally has figured out all
these different branches but then you

8704
02:47:15,790 --> 02:47:15,800
these different branches but then you
 

8705
02:47:15,800 --> 02:47:17,790
these different branches but then you
have to pull all these branches together

8706
02:47:17,790 --> 02:47:17,800
have to pull all these branches together
 

8707
02:47:17,800 --> 02:47:20,590
have to pull all these branches together
to say and the classical answer is this

8708
02:47:20,590 --> 02:47:20,600
to say and the classical answer is this
 

8709
02:47:20,600 --> 02:47:22,190
to say and the classical answer is this
okay the standard theory of quantum

8710
02:47:22,190 --> 02:47:22,200
okay the standard theory of quantum
 

8711
02:47:22,200 --> 02:47:23,590
okay the standard theory of quantum
mechanics does not tell you how to do

8712
02:47:23,590 --> 02:47:23,600
mechanics does not tell you how to do
 

8713
02:47:23,600 --> 02:47:25,429
mechanics does not tell you how to do
that it tells you how the branching

8714
02:47:25,429 --> 02:47:25,439
that it tells you how the branching
 

8715
02:47:25,439 --> 02:47:27,269
that it tells you how the branching
works but it doesn't tell you the

8716
02:47:27,269 --> 02:47:27,279
works but it doesn't tell you the
 

8717
02:47:27,279 --> 02:47:29,230
works but it doesn't tell you the
process of corralling all these things

8718
02:47:29,230 --> 02:47:29,240
process of corralling all these things
 

8719
02:47:29,240 --> 02:47:31,710
process of corralling all these things
together and that process which

8720
02:47:31,710 --> 02:47:31,720
together and that process which
 

8721
02:47:31,720 --> 02:47:33,190
together and that process which
intuitively you can see is going to be

8722
02:47:33,190 --> 02:47:33,200
intuitively you can see is going to be
 

8723
02:47:33,200 --> 02:47:36,269
intuitively you can see is going to be
kind of tricky but our model actually

8724
02:47:36,269 --> 02:47:36,279
kind of tricky but our model actually
 

8725
02:47:36,279 --> 02:47:38,030
kind of tricky but our model actually
does tell you how that process of

8726
02:47:38,030 --> 02:47:38,040
does tell you how that process of
 

8727
02:47:38,040 --> 02:47:41,030
does tell you how that process of
pulling things together works and the

8728
02:47:41,030 --> 02:47:41,040
pulling things together works and the
 

8729
02:47:41,040 --> 02:47:42,590
pulling things together works and the
answer seems to be we're not absolutely

8730
02:47:42,590 --> 02:47:42,600
answer seems to be we're not absolutely
 

8731
02:47:42,600 --> 02:47:44,910
answer seems to be we're not absolutely
sure we've only got to two * three so

8732
02:47:44,910 --> 02:47:44,920
sure we've only got to two * three so
 

8733
02:47:44,920 --> 02:47:47,550
sure we've only got to two * three so
far in in uh you know which is kind of

8734
02:47:47,550 --> 02:47:47,560
far in in uh you know which is kind of
 

8735
02:47:47,560 --> 02:47:50,349
far in in uh you know which is kind of
in in in this um in this factorization

8736
02:47:50,349 --> 02:47:50,359
in in in this um in this factorization
 

8737
02:47:50,359 --> 02:47:53,230
in in in this um in this factorization
in quantum computers but we can um uh

8738
02:47:53,230 --> 02:47:53,240
in quantum computers but we can um uh
 

8739
02:47:53,240 --> 02:47:55,389
in quantum computers but we can um uh
the you know what seems to be the case

8740
02:47:55,389 --> 02:47:55,399
the you know what seems to be the case
 

8741
02:47:55,399 --> 02:47:57,389
the you know what seems to be the case
is that the advantage you get from the

8742
02:47:57,389 --> 02:47:57,399
is that the advantage you get from the
 

8743
02:47:57,399 --> 02:47:59,910
is that the advantage you get from the
parallelization from quantum mechanics

8744
02:47:59,910 --> 02:47:59,920
parallelization from quantum mechanics
 

8745
02:47:59,920 --> 02:48:02,990
parallelization from quantum mechanics
is lost from the amount that you have to

8746
02:48:02,990 --> 02:48:03,000
is lost from the amount that you have to
 

8747
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:04,429
is lost from the amount that you have to
spend pulling together all those

8748
02:48:04,429 --> 02:48:04,439
spend pulling together all those
 

8749
02:48:04,439 --> 02:48:06,150
spend pulling together all those
parallel threads to get to a classical

8750
02:48:06,150 --> 02:48:06,160
parallel threads to get to a classical
 

8751
02:48:06,160 --> 02:48:09,269
parallel threads to get to a classical
answer at the end now that phenomenon is

8752
02:48:09,269 --> 02:48:09,279
answer at the end now that phenomenon is
 

8753
02:48:09,279 --> 02:48:11,389
answer at the end now that phenomenon is
not unrelated to various decoherence

8754
02:48:11,389 --> 02:48:11,399
not unrelated to various decoherence
 

8755
02:48:11,399 --> 02:48:12,750
not unrelated to various decoherence
phenomena that are seen in Practical

8756
02:48:12,750 --> 02:48:12,760
phenomena that are seen in Practical
 

8757
02:48:12,760 --> 02:48:14,510
phenomena that are seen in Practical
quantum computers and so on I mean I

8758
02:48:14,510 --> 02:48:14,520
quantum computers and so on I mean I
 

8759
02:48:14,520 --> 02:48:16,429
quantum computers and so on I mean I
should say as a as a very practical

8760
02:48:16,429 --> 02:48:16,439
should say as a as a very practical
 

8761
02:48:16,439 --> 02:48:18,190
should say as a as a very practical
point I mean it's like should people

8762
02:48:18,190 --> 02:48:18,200
point I mean it's like should people
 

8763
02:48:18,200 --> 02:48:19,870
point I mean it's like should people
stop ing to do Quantum Computing

8764
02:48:19,870 --> 02:48:19,880
stop ing to do Quantum Computing
 

8765
02:48:19,880 --> 02:48:22,630
stop ing to do Quantum Computing
research no because what they're really

8766
02:48:22,630 --> 02:48:22,640
research no because what they're really
 

8767
02:48:22,640 --> 02:48:25,150
research no because what they're really
doing is they're trying to use physics

8768
02:48:25,150 --> 02:48:25,160
doing is they're trying to use physics
 

8769
02:48:25,160 --> 02:48:27,469
doing is they're trying to use physics
to get to a new level of what's possible

8770
02:48:27,469 --> 02:48:27,479
to get to a new level of what's possible
 

8771
02:48:27,479 --> 02:48:29,630
to get to a new level of what's possible
in Computing and that's a completely

8772
02:48:29,630 --> 02:48:29,640
in Computing and that's a completely
 

8773
02:48:29,640 --> 02:48:32,309
in Computing and that's a completely
valid activity whether whether you can

8774
02:48:32,309 --> 02:48:32,319
valid activity whether whether you can
 

8775
02:48:32,319 --> 02:48:34,150
valid activity whether whether you can
really put you know whether you can say

8776
02:48:34,150 --> 02:48:34,160
really put you know whether you can say
 

8777
02:48:34,160 --> 02:48:35,910
really put you know whether you can say
oh you can solve an MP complete problem

8778
02:48:35,910 --> 02:48:35,920
oh you can solve an MP complete problem
 

8779
02:48:35,920 --> 02:48:37,389
oh you can solve an MP complete problem
you can reduce exponential time to

8780
02:48:37,389 --> 02:48:37,399
you can reduce exponential time to
 

8781
02:48:37,399 --> 02:48:40,630
you can reduce exponential time to
polinomial time you know we're not sure

8782
02:48:40,630 --> 02:48:40,640
polinomial time you know we're not sure
 

8783
02:48:40,640 --> 02:48:43,150
polinomial time you know we're not sure
and and I'm suspecting the answer is no

8784
02:48:43,150 --> 02:48:43,160
and and I'm suspecting the answer is no
 

8785
02:48:43,160 --> 02:48:45,469
and and I'm suspecting the answer is no
but that's not relevant to the Practical

8786
02:48:45,469 --> 02:48:45,479
but that's not relevant to the Practical
 

8787
02:48:45,479 --> 02:48:47,469
but that's not relevant to the Practical
speedups you can get by using different

8788
02:48:47,469 --> 02:48:47,479
speedups you can get by using different
 

8789
02:48:47,479 --> 02:48:49,230

8792
02:48:52,790 --> 02:48:52,800
physics um to do basic Computing so
 

8793
02:48:52,800 --> 02:48:54,469
physics um to do basic Computing so
you're saying I mean some of the models

8794
02:48:54,469 --> 02:48:54,479
you're saying I mean some of the models
 

8795
02:48:54,479 --> 02:48:56,910
you're saying I mean some of the models
you're playing with the indication is

8796
02:48:56,910 --> 02:48:56,920
you're playing with the indication is
 

8797
02:48:56,920 --> 02:49:00,750
you're playing with the indication is
that uh to uh get all the Sheep back

8798
02:49:00,750 --> 02:49:00,760
that uh to uh get all the Sheep back
 

8799
02:49:00,760 --> 02:49:05,190
that uh to uh get all the Sheep back
together uh and you know to to Coral

8800
02:49:05,190 --> 02:49:05,200
together uh and you know to to Coral
 

8801
02:49:05,200 --> 02:49:06,870
together uh and you know to to Coral
everything together to get the actual

8802
02:49:06,870 --> 02:49:06,880
everything together to get the actual
 

8803
02:49:06,880 --> 02:49:08,070
everything together to get the actual
solution to the

8804
02:49:08,070 --> 02:49:08,080
solution to the
 

8805
02:49:08,080 --> 02:49:11,070
solution to the
algorithm is uh you lose all the you

8806
02:49:11,070 --> 02:49:11,080
algorithm is uh you lose all the you
 

8807
02:49:11,080 --> 02:49:13,510
algorithm is uh you lose all the you
lose use all by the way I mean so so

8808
02:49:13,510 --> 02:49:13,520
lose use all by the way I mean so so
 

8809
02:49:13,520 --> 02:49:15,670
lose use all by the way I mean so so
again this question do we actually know

8810
02:49:15,670 --> 02:49:15,680
again this question do we actually know
 

8811
02:49:15,680 --> 02:49:17,030
again this question do we actually know
what we're talking about about Quantum

8812
02:49:17,030 --> 02:49:17,040
what we're talking about about Quantum
 

8813
02:49:17,040 --> 02:49:20,510
what we're talking about about Quantum
Computing and so on so again again uh

8814
02:49:20,510 --> 02:49:20,520
Computing and so on so again again uh
 

8815
02:49:20,520 --> 02:49:22,710
Computing and so on so again again uh
we're doing proof by compilation so we

8816
02:49:22,710 --> 02:49:22,720
we're doing proof by compilation so we
 

8817
02:49:22,720 --> 02:49:24,750
we're doing proof by compilation so we
have a Quantum Computing framework yeah

8818
02:49:24,750 --> 02:49:24,760
have a Quantum Computing framework yeah
 

8819
02:49:24,760 --> 02:49:26,750
have a Quantum Computing framework yeah
in wolam language and which is you know

8820
02:49:26,750 --> 02:49:26,760
in wolam language and which is you know
 

8821
02:49:26,760 --> 02:49:28,309
in wolam language and which is you know
a standard Quantum Computing framework

8822
02:49:28,309 --> 02:49:28,319
a standard Quantum Computing framework
 

8823
02:49:28,319 --> 02:49:29,750
a standard Quantum Computing framework
that represents things in terms of the

8824
02:49:29,750 --> 02:49:29,760
that represents things in terms of the
 

8825
02:49:29,760 --> 02:49:31,830
that represents things in terms of the
standard uh you know formalism of

8826
02:49:31,830 --> 02:49:31,840
standard uh you know formalism of
 

8827
02:49:31,840 --> 02:49:35,030
standard uh you know formalism of
quantum mechanics and we have a compiler

8828
02:49:35,030 --> 02:49:35,040
quantum mechanics and we have a compiler
 

8829
02:49:35,040 --> 02:49:37,710
quantum mechanics and we have a compiler
that simply compiles the representation

8830
02:49:37,710 --> 02:49:37,720
that simply compiles the representation
 

8831
02:49:37,720 --> 02:49:41,590
that simply compiles the representation
of quantum Gates into multi-way systems

8832
02:49:41,590 --> 02:49:41,600
of quantum Gates into multi-way systems
 

8833
02:49:41,600 --> 02:49:43,670
of quantum Gates into multi-way systems
so and in fact the the message that I

8834
02:49:43,670 --> 02:49:43,680
so and in fact the the message that I
 

8835
02:49:43,680 --> 02:49:45,389
so and in fact the the message that I
got was from somebody who's working on

8836
02:49:45,389 --> 02:49:45,399
got was from somebody who's working on
 

8837
02:49:45,399 --> 02:49:48,269
got was from somebody who's working on
the project who has managed to compile

8838
02:49:48,269 --> 02:49:48,279
the project who has managed to compile
 

8839
02:49:48,279 --> 02:49:51,269
the project who has managed to compile
one the sort of uh a core formalism

8840
02:49:51,269 --> 02:49:51,279
one the sort of uh a core formalism
 

8841
02:49:51,279 --> 02:49:54,710
one the sort of uh a core formalism
based on category Theory um in of core

8842
02:49:54,710 --> 02:49:54,720
based on category Theory um in of core
 

8843
02:49:54,720 --> 02:49:57,429
based on category Theory um in of core
Quantum formalism into multi-way systems

8844
02:49:57,429 --> 02:49:57,439
Quantum formalism into multi-way systems
 

8845
02:49:57,439 --> 02:49:58,870
Quantum formalism into multi-way systems
so this when you say multi-way system

8846
02:49:58,870 --> 02:49:58,880
so this when you say multi-way system
 

8847
02:49:58,880 --> 02:50:01,670
so this when you say multi-way system
these multi-way graphs yes yes so you're

8848
02:50:01,670 --> 02:50:01,680
these multi-way graphs yes yes so you're
 

8849
02:50:01,680 --> 02:50:03,469
these multi-way graphs yes yes so you're
comp yeah okay that's awesome and then

8850
02:50:03,469 --> 02:50:03,479
comp yeah okay that's awesome and then
 

8851
02:50:03,479 --> 02:50:05,229
comp yeah okay that's awesome and then
you can do all kinds of experiments on

8852
02:50:05,229 --> 02:50:05,239
you can do all kinds of experiments on
 

8853
02:50:05,239 --> 02:50:06,950
you can do all kinds of experiments on
that multiway graph right well but the

8854
02:50:06,950 --> 02:50:06,960
that multiway graph right well but the
 

8855
02:50:06,960 --> 02:50:08,870
that multiway graph right well but the
point is that what we're saying is the

8856
02:50:08,870 --> 02:50:08,880
point is that what we're saying is the
 

8857
02:50:08,880 --> 02:50:10,429
point is that what we're saying is the
thing we've got this representation of

8858
02:50:10,429 --> 02:50:10,439
thing we've got this representation of
 

8859
02:50:10,439 --> 02:50:12,670
thing we've got this representation of
let's say Shaw's algorithm in terms of

8860
02:50:12,670 --> 02:50:12,680
let's say Shaw's algorithm in terms of
 

8861
02:50:12,680 --> 02:50:14,630
let's say Shaw's algorithm in terms of
standard Quantum Gates and it's just a

8862
02:50:14,630 --> 02:50:14,640
standard Quantum Gates and it's just a
 

8863
02:50:14,640 --> 02:50:17,630
standard Quantum Gates and it's just a
pure matter of sort of computation to

8864
02:50:17,630 --> 02:50:17,640
pure matter of sort of computation to
 

8865
02:50:17,640 --> 02:50:19,510
pure matter of sort of computation to
just say that is a equivalent we will

8866
02:50:19,510 --> 02:50:19,520
just say that is a equivalent we will
 

8867
02:50:19,520 --> 02:50:22,309
just say that is a equivalent we will
get the same result as running this

8868
02:50:22,309 --> 02:50:22,319
get the same result as running this
 

8869
02:50:22,319 --> 02:50:24,630
get the same result as running this
multi-way system can you do complexity

8870
02:50:24,630 --> 02:50:24,640
multi-way system can you do complexity
 

8871
02:50:24,640 --> 02:50:26,750
multi-way system can you do complexity
analysis on that multi-way system well

8872
02:50:26,750 --> 02:50:26,760
analysis on that multi-way system well
 

8873
02:50:26,760 --> 02:50:28,510
analysis on that multi-way system well
that's what we've been trying to do yes

8874
02:50:28,510 --> 02:50:28,520
that's what we've been trying to do yes
 

8875
02:50:28,520 --> 02:50:29,990
that's what we've been trying to do yes
we're getting there we haven't done that

8876
02:50:29,990 --> 02:50:30,000
we're getting there we haven't done that
 

8877
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:31,950
we're getting there we haven't done that
yet I mean we we there's a pretty good

8878
02:50:31,950 --> 02:50:31,960
yet I mean we we there's a pretty good
 

8879
02:50:31,960 --> 02:50:33,229
yet I mean we we there's a pretty good
indication of how that's going to work

8880
02:50:33,229 --> 02:50:33,239
indication of how that's going to work
 

8881
02:50:33,239 --> 02:50:34,670
indication of how that's going to work
out and we've done it as I say our

8882
02:50:34,670 --> 02:50:34,680
out and we've done it as I say our
 

8883
02:50:34,680 --> 02:50:36,670
out and we've done it as I say our
computer experiments we've

8884
02:50:36,670 --> 02:50:36,680
computer experiments we've
 

8885
02:50:36,680 --> 02:50:39,389
computer experiments we've
unimpressively gotten to about 2 * three

8886
02:50:39,389 --> 02:50:39,399
unimpressively gotten to about 2 * three
 

8887
02:50:39,399 --> 02:50:41,750
unimpressively gotten to about 2 * three
in terms of factorization which is kind

8888
02:50:41,750 --> 02:50:41,760
in terms of factorization which is kind
 

8889
02:50:41,760 --> 02:50:43,269
in terms of factorization which is kind
of about how far people have got with

8890
02:50:43,269 --> 02:50:43,279
of about how far people have got with
 

8891
02:50:43,279 --> 02:50:45,750
of about how far people have got with
physical quantum computers as well but

8892
02:50:45,750 --> 02:50:45,760
physical quantum computers as well but
 

8893
02:50:45,760 --> 02:50:48,070
physical quantum computers as well but
but that's um but yes we will be able to

8894
02:50:48,070 --> 02:50:48,080
but that's um but yes we will be able to
 

8895
02:50:48,080 --> 02:50:49,349
but that's um but yes we will be able to
we definitely will be able to do

8896
02:50:49,349 --> 02:50:49,359
we definitely will be able to do
 

8897
02:50:49,359 --> 02:50:51,150
we definitely will be able to do
complexity analysis and we will be able

8898
02:50:51,150 --> 02:50:51,160
complexity analysis and we will be able
 

8899
02:50:51,160 --> 02:50:54,349
complexity analysis and we will be able
to know so the one remaining hope for

8900
02:50:54,349 --> 02:50:54,359
to know so the one remaining hope for
 

8901
02:50:54,359 --> 02:50:56,349
to know so the one remaining hope for
Quantum Computing really really working

8902
02:50:56,349 --> 02:50:56,359
Quantum Computing really really working
 

8903
02:50:56,359 --> 02:50:59,309
Quantum Computing really really working
at this formal level of you know Quantum

8904
02:50:59,309 --> 02:50:59,319
at this formal level of you know Quantum
 

8905
02:50:59,319 --> 02:51:01,150
at this formal level of you know Quantum
brand exponential stuff being done in

8906
02:51:01,150 --> 02:51:01,160
brand exponential stuff being done in
 

8907
02:51:01,160 --> 02:51:03,790
brand exponential stuff being done in
polinomial time and so on the one hope

8908
02:51:03,790 --> 02:51:03,800
polinomial time and so on the one hope
 

8909
02:51:03,800 --> 02:51:06,790
polinomial time and so on the one hope
which is very bizarre is that you can uh

8910
02:51:06,790 --> 02:51:06,800
which is very bizarre is that you can uh
 

8911
02:51:06,800 --> 02:51:09,750
which is very bizarre is that you can uh
kind of uh piggyback on the expansion of

8912
02:51:09,750 --> 02:51:09,760
kind of uh piggyback on the expansion of
 

8913
02:51:09,760 --> 02:51:12,550
kind of uh piggyback on the expansion of
bronchial space so here's here's how

8914
02:51:12,550 --> 02:51:12,560
bronchial space so here's here's how
 

8915
02:51:12,560 --> 02:51:15,830
bronchial space so here's here's how
that might work so you think you know

8916
02:51:15,830 --> 02:51:15,840
that might work so you think you know
 

8917
02:51:15,840 --> 02:51:17,830
that might work so you think you know
energy conservation standard thing in

8918
02:51:17,830 --> 02:51:17,840
energy conservation standard thing in
 

8919
02:51:17,840 --> 02:51:19,830
energy conservation standard thing in
high school physics energy is conserved

8920
02:51:19,830 --> 02:51:19,840
high school physics energy is conserved
 

8921
02:51:19,840 --> 02:51:22,670
high school physics energy is conserved
right but now you imagine you think

8922
02:51:22,670 --> 02:51:22,680
right but now you imagine you think
 

8923
02:51:22,680 --> 02:51:24,910
right but now you imagine you think
about energy in the context of cosmology

8924
02:51:24,910 --> 02:51:24,920
about energy in the context of cosmology
 

8925
02:51:24,920 --> 02:51:26,830
about energy in the context of cosmology
and the context of the whole universe

8926
02:51:26,830 --> 02:51:26,840
and the context of the whole universe
 

8927
02:51:26,840 --> 02:51:28,750
and the context of the whole universe
it's a much more complicated story The

8928
02:51:28,750 --> 02:51:28,760
it's a much more complicated story The
 

8929
02:51:28,760 --> 02:51:30,229
it's a much more complicated story The
expansion of the universe kind of

8930
02:51:30,229 --> 02:51:30,239
expansion of the universe kind of
 

8931
02:51:30,239 --> 02:51:32,830
expansion of the universe kind of
violates energy conservation and so for

8932
02:51:32,830 --> 02:51:32,840
violates energy conservation and so for
 

8933
02:51:32,840 --> 02:51:34,229
violates energy conservation and so for
example if you imagine you've got two

8934
02:51:34,229 --> 02:51:34,239
example if you imagine you've got two
 

8935
02:51:34,239 --> 02:51:35,830
example if you imagine you've got two
galaxies they're receding from each

8936
02:51:35,830 --> 02:51:35,840
galaxies they're receding from each
 

8937
02:51:35,840 --> 02:51:37,750
galaxies they're receding from each
other very quickly they've got two big

8938
02:51:37,750 --> 02:51:37,760
other very quickly they've got two big

Central black holes you connect a spring

8940
02:51:40,950 --> 02:51:40,960
Central black holes you connect a spring
 

8941
02:51:40,960 --> 02:51:42,990
Central black holes you connect a spring
between these two Central black holes

8942
02:51:42,990 --> 02:51:43,000
between these two Central black holes
 

8943
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:44,990
between these two Central black holes
not easy to do in practice but let's

8944
02:51:44,990 --> 02:51:45,000
not easy to do in practice but let's
 

8945
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,870
not easy to do in practice but let's
imagine you could do it now that spring

8946
02:51:47,870 --> 02:51:47,880
imagine you could do it now that spring
 

8947
02:51:47,880 --> 02:51:49,790
imagine you could do it now that spring
is being pulled apart it's getting

8948
02:51:49,790 --> 02:51:49,800
is being pulled apart it's getting
 

8949
02:51:49,800 --> 02:51:51,389
is being pulled apart it's getting
getting more potential energy in the

8950
02:51:51,389 --> 02:51:51,399
getting more potential energy in the
 

8951
02:51:51,399 --> 02:51:53,790
getting more potential energy in the
spring as a result of the expansion of

02:51:53,790 --> 02:51:53,800
spring as a result of the expansion of
 

8953
02:51:53,800 --> 02:51:56,990
spring as a result of the expansion of
the universe so in a sense you are you

8954
02:51:56,990 --> 02:51:57,000
the universe so in a sense you are you
 

8955
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,070
the universe so in a sense you are you
are piggybacking on the expansion that

8956
02:51:59,070 --> 02:51:59,080
are piggybacking on the expansion that
 

8957
02:51:59,080 --> 02:52:01,110
are piggybacking on the expansion that
exists in the universe and the sort of

8958
02:52:01,110 --> 02:52:01,120
exists in the universe and the sort of
 

8959
02:52:01,120 --> 02:52:03,309
exists in the universe and the sort of
violation of energy conservation that's

8960
02:52:03,309 --> 02:52:03,319
violation of energy conservation that's
 

8961
02:52:03,319 --> 02:52:04,790
violation of energy conservation that's
associated with that cosmological

8962
02:52:04,790 --> 02:52:04,800
associated with that cosmological

02:52:35,319 --> 02:52:36,910
branchial space now the physical space
version is kind of absurd and involves

8990
02:52:36,910 --> 02:52:36,920
version is kind of absurd and involves
 

8991
02:52:36,920 --> 02:52:38,990
version is kind of absurd and involves
you know Springs between black holes and

8992
02:52:38,990 --> 02:52:39,000
you know Springs between black holes and
 

8993
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:41,429
you know Springs between black holes and
so on it's conceivable that the

8994
02:52:41,429 --> 02:52:41,439
so on it's conceivable that the
 

8995
02:52:41,439 --> 02:52:44,110
so on it's conceivable that the
branchial space version is not as absurd

8996
02:52:44,110 --> 02:52:44,120
branchial space version is not as absurd
 

8997
02:52:44,120 --> 02:52:45,510
branchial space version is not as absurd
and that it's actually something you can

8998
02:52:45,510 --> 02:52:45,520
and that it's actually something you can
 

8999
02:52:45,520 --> 02:52:47,990
and that it's actually something you can
reach with physical things you can build

9000
02:52:47,990 --> 02:52:48,000
reach with physical things you can build
 

9001
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,469
reach with physical things you can build
in lab and so on we don't know yet okay

9002
02:52:50,469 --> 02:52:50,479
in lab and so on we don't know yet okay
 

9003
02:52:50,479 --> 02:52:52,190
in lab and so on we don't know yet okay
so yeah like you were saying the branch

9004
02:52:52,190 --> 02:52:52,200
so yeah like you were saying the branch
 

9005
02:52:52,200 --> 02:52:54,990
so yeah like you were saying the branch
of space might be uh expanding and there

9006
02:52:54,990 --> 02:52:55,000
of space might be uh expanding and there
 

9007
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:56,830
of space might be uh expanding and there
might be some something that could be

9008
02:52:56,830 --> 02:52:56,840
might be some something that could be
 

9009
02:52:56,840 --> 02:52:59,710
might be some something that could be
exploited right in the same kind of way

9010
02:52:59,710 --> 02:52:59,720
exploited right in the same kind of way
 

9011
02:52:59,720 --> 02:53:02,750
exploited right in the same kind of way
that that um that you can exploit the um

9012
02:53:02,750 --> 02:53:02,760
that that um that you can exploit the um
 

9013
02:53:02,760 --> 02:53:03,790
that that um that you can exploit the um
uh you know that expansion of the

9014
02:53:03,790 --> 02:53:03,800
uh you know that expansion of the
 

9015
02:53:03,800 --> 02:53:07,269
uh you know that expansion of the
universe in principle in physical space

9016
02:53:07,269 --> 02:53:07,279
universe in principle in physical space
 

9017
02:53:07,279 --> 02:53:09,229
universe in principle in physical space
you just have like a glimmer of hope

9018
02:53:09,229 --> 02:53:09,239
you just have like a glimmer of hope
 

9019
02:53:09,239 --> 02:53:10,870
you just have like a glimmer of hope
right I think that the look I think the

9020
02:53:10,870 --> 02:53:10,880
right I think that the look I think the
 

9021
02:53:10,880 --> 02:53:12,750
right I think that the look I think the
real answer is going to be that for

9022
02:53:12,750 --> 02:53:12,760
real answer is going to be that for
 

9023
02:53:12,760 --> 02:53:15,229
real answer is going to be that for
practical purposes you know the official

9024
02:53:15,229 --> 02:53:15,239
practical purposes you know the official
 

9025
02:53:15,239 --> 02:53:17,710
practical purposes you know the official
brand that says you can you can you know

9026
02:53:17,710 --> 02:53:17,720
brand that says you can you can you know
 

9027
02:53:17,720 --> 02:53:19,670
brand that says you can you can you know
do exponential things in po time is

9028
02:53:19,670 --> 02:53:19,680
do exponential things in po time is
 

9029
02:53:19,680 --> 02:53:21,550
do exponential things in po time is
probably not going to work for people

9030
02:53:21,550 --> 02:53:21,560
probably not going to work for people
 

9031
02:53:21,560 --> 02:53:23,349
probably not going to work for people
curious to kind of learn more so this is

9032
02:53:23,349 --> 02:53:23,359
curious to kind of learn more so this is
 

9033
02:53:23,359 --> 02:53:25,190
curious to kind of learn more so this is
more like this is not Middle School

9034
02:53:25,190 --> 02:53:25,200
more like this is not Middle School
 

9035
02:53:25,200 --> 02:53:26,670
more like this is not Middle School
we're going to go to elementary school

9036
02:53:26,670 --> 02:53:26,680
we're going to go to elementary school
 

9037
02:53:26,680 --> 02:53:27,469
we're going to go to elementary school
for a

9038
02:53:27,469 --> 02:53:27,479
for a
 

9039
02:53:27,479 --> 02:53:29,510
for a
second maybe Middle School let's go to

9040
02:53:29,510 --> 02:53:29,520
second maybe Middle School let's go to
 

9041
02:53:29,520 --> 02:53:30,389
second maybe Middle School let's go to
middle

9042
02:53:30,389 --> 02:53:30,399
middle
 

9043
02:53:30,399 --> 02:53:34,750
middle
school so if I were to try to maybe

9044
02:53:34,750 --> 02:53:34,760
school so if I were to try to maybe
 

9045
02:53:34,760 --> 02:53:37,309
school so if I were to try to maybe
write a write a

Central
 

9063
02:53:57,680 --> 02:54:00,550

ideas um how would you go about doing

9064
02:54:00,550 --> 02:54:00,560
ideas um how would you go about doing
 

9065
02:54:00,560 --> 02:54:02,750
ideas um how would you go about doing
that could you help me out a little bit

9066
02:54:02,750 --> 02:54:02,760
that could you help me out a little bit
 

9067
02:54:02,760 --> 02:54:04,950
that could you help me out a little bit
yeah yeah I mean we covered a l really

9068
02:54:04,950 --> 02:54:04,960
yeah yeah I mean we covered a l really
 

9069
02:54:04,960 --> 02:54:06,469
yeah yeah I mean we covered a l really
practical matter we have this kind of

9070
02:54:06,469 --> 02:54:06,479
practical matter we have this kind of
 

9071
02:54:06,479 --> 02:54:10,269
practical matter we have this kind of
visual summary picture that we made um

9072
02:54:10,269 --> 02:54:10,279
visual summary picture that we made um
 

9073
02:54:10,279 --> 02:54:12,389
visual summary picture that we made um
which I think is a pretty good you know

9074
02:54:12,389 --> 02:54:12,399
which I think is a pretty good you know
 

9075
02:54:12,399 --> 02:54:13,870
which I think is a pretty good you know
when I've tried to explain this to

9076
02:54:13,870 --> 02:54:13,880
when I've tried to explain this to
 

9077
02:54:13,880 --> 02:54:15,790
when I've tried to explain this to
people and you know it's a pretty good

9078
02:54:15,790 --> 02:54:15,800
people and you know it's a pretty good
 

9079
02:54:15,800 --> 02:54:18,670
people and you know it's a pretty good
place to start is you got this rule you

9080
02:54:18,670 --> 02:54:18,680
place to start is you got this rule you
 

9081
02:54:18,680 --> 02:54:20,150
place to start is you got this rule you
know you apply the rule you're building

9082
02:54:20,150 --> 02:54:20,160
know you apply the rule you're building
 

9083
02:54:20,160 --> 02:54:22,830
know you apply the rule you're building
up this this big hypergraph um you've

9084
02:54:22,830 --> 02:54:22,840
up this this big hypergraph um you've
 

9085
02:54:22,840 --> 02:54:24,790
up this this big hypergraph um you've
got all these possibilities you're kind

9086
02:54:24,790 --> 02:54:24,800
got all these possibilities you're kind
 

9087
02:54:24,800 --> 02:54:26,349
got all these possibilities you're kind
of thinking about that in terms of

9088
02:54:26,349 --> 02:54:26,359
of thinking about that in terms of
 

9089
02:54:26,359 --> 02:54:28,710
of thinking about that in terms of
quantum mechanics I mean that's a that's

9090
02:54:28,710 --> 02:54:28,720
quantum mechanics I mean that's a that's
 

9091
02:54:28,720 --> 02:54:30,870
quantum mechanics I mean that's a that's
a that's a decent place to start so

9092
02:54:30,870 --> 02:54:30,880
a that's a decent place to start so
 

9093
02:54:30,880 --> 02:54:32,950
a that's a decent place to start so
basically the things we've talked about

9094
02:54:32,950 --> 02:54:32,960
basically the things we've talked about
 

9095
02:54:32,960 --> 02:54:36,070
basically the things we've talked about
which is space represented as a

9096
02:54:36,070 --> 02:54:36,080
which is space represented as a
 

9097
02:54:36,080 --> 02:54:38,590
which is space represented as a
hypergraph transformation of that space

9098
02:54:38,590 --> 02:54:38,600
hypergraph transformation of that space
 

9099
02:54:38,600 --> 02:54:43,070
hypergraph transformation of that space
is kind of time yes and then uh

9100
02:54:43,070 --> 02:54:43,080
is kind of time yes and then uh
 

9101
02:54:43,080 --> 02:54:45,630
is kind of time yes and then uh
structure of that space in the curvature

9102
02:54:45,630 --> 02:54:45,640
structure of that space in the curvature
 

9103
02:54:45,640 --> 02:54:48,030
structure of that space in the curvature
of that space as gravity that's that can

9104
02:54:48,030 --> 02:54:48,040
of that space as gravity that's that can
 

9105
02:54:48,040 --> 02:54:49,590
of that space as gravity that's that can
be explain without going anywhere near

9106
02:54:49,590 --> 02:54:49,600
be explain without going anywhere near
 

9107
02:54:49,600 --> 02:54:51,830
be explain without going anywhere near
quantum mechanics um I would say that's

9108
02:54:51,830 --> 02:54:51,840
quantum mechanics um I would say that's
 

9109
02:54:51,840 --> 02:54:53,389
quantum mechanics um I would say that's
actually easier to explain than special

9110
02:54:53,389 --> 02:54:53,399
actually easier to explain than special
 

9111
02:54:53,399 --> 02:54:55,910
actually easier to explain than special
robots of day um oh so going into

9112
02:54:55,910 --> 02:54:55,920
robots of day um oh so going into
 

9113
02:54:55,920 --> 02:54:58,670
robots of day um oh so going into
General so going to curvature yeah I

9114
02:54:58,670 --> 02:54:58,680
General so going to curvature yeah I
 

9115
02:54:58,680 --> 02:55:01,229
General so going to curvature yeah I
mean special relativity I I think is

9116
02:55:01,229 --> 02:55:01,239
mean special relativity I I think is
 

9117
02:55:01,239 --> 02:55:03,269
mean special relativity I I think is
it's a little bit elaborate to explain

9118
02:55:03,269 --> 02:55:03,279
it's a little bit elaborate to explain
 

9119
02:55:03,279 --> 02:55:05,469
it's a little bit elaborate to explain
yeah and honestly you only care about it

9120
02:55:05,469 --> 02:55:05,479
yeah and honestly you only care about it
 

9121
02:55:05,479 --> 02:55:06,870
yeah and honestly you only care about it
if you know about special relativity if

9122
02:55:06,870 --> 02:55:06,880
if you know about special relativity if
 

9123
02:55:06,880 --> 02:55:08,070
if you know about special relativity if
you know how special relativity is

9124
02:55:08,070 --> 02:55:08,080
you know how special relativity is
 

9125
02:55:08,080 --> 02:55:10,429
you know how special relativity is
ordinarily derived and so on general

9126
02:55:10,429 --> 02:55:10,439
ordinarily derived and so on general
 

9127
02:55:10,439 --> 02:55:13,110
ordinarily derived and so on general
relativity is easier is easier yes and

9128
02:55:13,110 --> 02:55:13,120
relativity is easier is easier yes and
 

9129
02:55:13,120 --> 02:55:15,309
relativity is easier is easier yes and
what about what's the easiest way to

9130
02:55:15,309 --> 02:55:15,319
what about what's the easiest way to
 

9131
02:55:15,319 --> 02:55:17,990
what about what's the easiest way to
reveal uh I think the the basic point is

9132
02:55:17,990 --> 02:55:18,000
reveal uh I think the the basic point is
 

9133
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:19,389
reveal uh I think the the basic point is
just

9134
02:55:19,389 --> 02:55:19,399
just
 

9135
02:55:19,399 --> 02:55:20,710
just
this fact that there are all these

9136
02:55:20,710 --> 02:55:20,720
this fact that there are all these
 

9137
02:55:20,720 --> 02:55:22,830
this fact that there are all these
different branches that there's this

9138
02:55:22,830 --> 02:55:22,840
different branches that there's this
 

9139
02:55:22,840 --> 02:55:26,110
different branches that there's this
kind of map of how the branches work and

9140
02:55:26,110 --> 02:55:26,120
kind of map of how the branches work and
 

9141
02:55:26,120 --> 02:55:29,510
kind of map of how the branches work and
that um I mean I think I think actually

9142
02:55:29,510 --> 02:55:29,520
that um I mean I think I think actually
 

9143
02:55:29,520 --> 02:55:31,229
that um I mean I think I think actually
the recent things that we have about the

9144
02:55:31,229 --> 02:55:31,239
the recent things that we have about the
 

9145
02:55:31,239 --> 02:55:33,190
the recent things that we have about the
double experiment are pretty good

9146
02:55:33,190 --> 02:55:33,200
double experiment are pretty good
 

9147
02:55:33,200 --> 02:55:34,950
double experiment are pretty good
because you can actually see this you

9148
02:55:34,950 --> 02:55:34,960
because you can actually see this you
 

9149
02:55:34,960 --> 02:55:37,070
because you can actually see this you
can see how the double slit you know

9150
02:55:37,070 --> 02:55:37,080
can see how the double slit you know
 

9151
02:55:37,080 --> 02:55:40,269
can see how the double slit you know
phenomenon arises from just features of

9152
02:55:40,269 --> 02:55:40,279
phenomenon arises from just features of
 

9153
02:55:40,279 --> 02:55:43,030
phenomenon arises from just features of
these graphs now you know having said

9154
02:55:43,030 --> 02:55:43,040
these graphs now you know having said
 

9155
02:55:43,040 --> 02:55:45,429
these graphs now you know having said
that right there is a little bit of of

9156
02:55:45,429 --> 02:55:45,439
that right there is a little bit of of
 

9157
02:55:45,439 --> 02:55:48,750
that right there is a little bit of of
slight of hand there because the the

9158
02:55:48,750 --> 02:55:48,760
slight of hand there because the the
 

9159
02:55:48,760 --> 02:55:50,590
slight of hand there because the the
true story of the way that double slit

9160
02:55:50,590 --> 02:55:50,600
true story of the way that double slit
 

9161
02:55:50,600 --> 02:55:52,670
true story of the way that double slit
thing works depends on a

9162
02:55:52,670 --> 02:55:52,680
thing works depends on a
 

9163
02:55:52,680 --> 02:55:55,670
thing works depends on a
coordinatization of branchial space that

9164
02:55:55,670 --> 02:55:55,680
coordinatization of branchial space that
 

9165
02:55:55,680 --> 02:55:57,870
coordinatization of branchial space that
for example in our internal team there

9166
02:55:57,870 --> 02:55:57,880
for example in our internal team there
 

9167
02:55:57,880 --> 02:56:00,150
for example in our internal team there
is still a vigorous battle going on

9168
02:56:00,150 --> 02:56:00,160
is still a vigorous battle going on
 

9169
02:56:00,160 --> 02:56:02,150
is still a vigorous battle going on
about how that works and it's it's

9170
02:56:02,150 --> 02:56:02,160
about how that works and it's it's
 

9171
02:56:02,160 --> 02:56:05,070
about how that works and it's it's
what's becoming clear is I mean what's

9172
02:56:05,070 --> 02:56:05,080
what's becoming clear is I mean what's
 

9173
02:56:05,080 --> 02:56:06,790
what's becoming clear is I mean what's
becoming clear is that it's

9174
02:56:06,790 --> 02:56:06,800
becoming clear is that it's
 

9175
02:56:06,800 --> 02:56:08,790
becoming clear is that it's
mathematically really quite interesting

9176
02:56:08,790 --> 02:56:08,800
mathematically really quite interesting
 

9177
02:56:08,800 --> 02:56:10,630
mathematically really quite interesting
I mean that is that there's a you know

9178
02:56:10,630 --> 02:56:10,640
I mean that is that there's a you know
 

9179
02:56:10,640 --> 02:56:12,349
I mean that is that there's a you know
it involves essentially putting space

9180
02:56:12,349 --> 02:56:12,359
it involves essentially putting space
 

9181
02:56:12,359 --> 02:56:13,950
it involves essentially putting space
fill in curves you basically have a

9182
02:56:13,950 --> 02:56:13,960
fill in curves you basically have a
 

9183
02:56:13,960 --> 02:56:15,790
fill in curves you basically have a
thing which is naturally two-dimensional

9184
02:56:15,790 --> 02:56:15,800
thing which is naturally two-dimensional
 

9185
02:56:15,800 --> 02:56:17,590
thing which is naturally two-dimensional
and you're sort of mapping it into one

9186
02:56:17,590 --> 02:56:17,600
and you're sort of mapping it into one
 

9187
02:56:17,600 --> 02:56:19,870
and you're sort of mapping it into one
dimension and with a space filling curve

9188
02:56:19,870 --> 02:56:19,880
dimension and with a space filling curve
 

9189
02:56:19,880 --> 02:56:21,150
dimension and with a space filling curve
and it's like why is it this space

9190
02:56:21,150 --> 02:56:21,160
and it's like why is it this space
 

9191
02:56:21,160 --> 02:56:22,309
and it's like why is it this space
filling curve and not another space

9192
02:56:22,309 --> 02:56:22,319
filling curve and not another space
 

9193
02:56:22,319 --> 02:56:24,510
filling curve and not another space
filling curve and that becomes a story

9194
02:56:24,510 --> 02:56:24,520
filling curve and that becomes a story
 

9195
02:56:24,520 --> 02:56:26,990
filling curve and that becomes a story
about reman surfaces and things and it's

9196
02:56:26,990 --> 02:56:27,000
about reman surfaces and things and it's
 

9197
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:30,030
about reman surfaces and things and it's
quite elaborate and um but but the

9198
02:56:30,030 --> 02:56:30,040
quite elaborate and um but but the
 

9199
02:56:30,040 --> 02:56:32,150
quite elaborate and um but but the
there's a a more little bit slight of

9200
02:56:32,150 --> 02:56:32,160
there's a a more little bit slight of
 

9201
02:56:32,160 --> 02:56:35,150
there's a a more little bit slight of
hand way of doing it where it's you know

9202
02:56:35,150 --> 02:56:35,160
hand way of doing it where it's you know
 

9203
02:56:35,160 --> 02:56:39,190
hand way of doing it where it's you know
it's surprisingly direct it's so a

9204
02:56:39,190 --> 02:56:39,200
it's surprisingly direct it's so a
 

9205
02:56:39,200 --> 02:56:41,710
it's surprisingly direct it's so a
question that might be difficult to

9206
02:56:41,710 --> 02:56:41,720
question that might be difficult to
 

9207
02:56:41,720 --> 02:56:45,750
question that might be difficult to
answer but uh for several levels of

9208
02:56:45,750 --> 02:56:45,760
answer but uh for several levels of
 

9209
02:56:45,760 --> 02:56:48,550
answer but uh for several levels of
people could you give me advice on how

9210
02:56:48,550 --> 02:56:48,560
people could you give me advice on how
 

9211
02:56:48,560 --> 02:56:51,309
people could you give me advice on how
we can learn more

9212
02:56:51,309 --> 02:56:51,319
we can learn more
 

9213
02:56:51,319 --> 02:56:53,630
we can learn more
specifically there is people that are

9214
02:56:53,630 --> 02:56:53,640
specifically there is people that are
 

9215
02:56:53,640 --> 02:56:56,190
specifically there is people that are
completely outside and just curious and

9216
02:56:56,190 --> 02:56:56,200
completely outside and just curious and
 

9217
02:56:56,200 --> 02:56:58,830
completely outside and just curious and
are captivated by the beauty of

9218
02:56:58,830 --> 02:56:58,840
are captivated by the beauty of
 

9219
02:56:58,840 --> 02:57:01,429
are captivated by the beauty of
hypergraphs actually uhhuh so people

9220
02:57:01,429 --> 02:57:01,439
hypergraphs actually uhhuh so people
 

9221
02:57:01,439 --> 02:57:03,150
hypergraphs actually uhhuh so people
there just want to explore play around

9222
02:57:03,150 --> 02:57:03,160
there just want to explore play around
 

9223
02:57:03,160 --> 02:57:08,030
there just want to explore play around
with this uh second level is people from

9224
02:57:08,030 --> 02:57:08,040
with this uh second level is people from
 

9225
02:57:08,040 --> 02:57:11,870
with this uh second level is people from
say people like me who somehow got a PhD

9226
02:57:11,870 --> 02:57:11,880
say people like me who somehow got a PhD
 

9227
02:57:11,880 --> 02:57:14,309
say people like me who somehow got a PhD
and computer science but are not

9228
02:57:14,309 --> 02:57:14,319
and computer science but are not
 

9229
02:57:14,319 --> 02:57:16,590
and computer science but are not
physicists and but fundamentally the

9230
02:57:16,590 --> 02:57:16,600
physicists and but fundamentally the
 

9231
02:57:16,600 --> 02:57:18,990
physicists and but fundamentally the
work you're doing is computational

9232
02:57:18,990 --> 02:57:19,000
work you're doing is computational
 

9233
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:22,150
work you're doing is computational
nature so it feels very accessible yes

9234
02:57:22,150 --> 02:57:22,160
nature so it feels very accessible yes
 

9235
02:57:22,160 --> 02:57:25,469
nature so it feels very accessible yes
so what are what can a person like that

9236
02:57:25,469 --> 02:57:25,479
so what are what can a person like that
 

9237
02:57:25,479 --> 02:57:29,630
so what are what can a person like that
do to learn enough physics or not to be

9238
02:57:29,630 --> 02:57:29,640
do to learn enough physics or not to be
 

9239
02:57:29,640 --> 02:57:32,630
do to learn enough physics or not to be
able to uh one explore the beauty of it

9240
02:57:32,630 --> 02:57:32,640
able to uh one explore the beauty of it
 

9241
02:57:32,640 --> 02:57:36,030
able to uh one explore the beauty of it

and he's a physicist physicist well he's
 

9267
02:58:04,840 --> 02:58:07,309
and he's a physicist physicist well he's
I would say a mathematical physicist he

9268
02:58:07,309 --> 02:58:07,319
I would say a mathematical physicist he
 

9269
02:58:07,319 --> 02:58:09,309
I would say a mathematical physicist he
pretty mathematically sophisticated he's

9270
02:58:09,309 --> 02:58:09,319
pretty mathematically sophisticated he's
 

9271
02:58:09,319 --> 02:58:12,910
pretty mathematically sophisticated he's
he regularly out mathematized me yeah

9272
02:58:12,910 --> 02:58:12,920
he regularly out mathematized me yeah
 

9273
02:58:12,920 --> 02:58:14,349
he regularly out mathematized me yeah
strong yeah strong mathematical

9274
02:58:14,349 --> 02:58:14,359
strong yeah strong mathematical
 

9275
02:58:14,359 --> 02:58:16,070
strong yeah strong mathematical
physicist yeah I looked at some of the

9276
02:58:16,070 --> 02:58:16,080
physicist yeah I looked at some of the
 

9277
02:58:16,080 --> 02:58:18,790
physicist yeah I looked at some of the
papers right but but so so I mean you

9278
02:58:18,790 --> 02:58:18,800
papers right but but so so I mean you
 

9279
02:58:18,800 --> 02:58:20,670
papers right but but so so I mean you
know I wrote this kind of original

9280
02:58:20,670 --> 02:58:20,680
know I wrote this kind of original
 

9281
02:58:20,680 --> 02:58:22,870
know I wrote this kind of original
announcement blog post about this

9282
02:58:22,870 --> 02:58:22,880
announcement blog post about this
 

9283
02:58:22,880 --> 02:58:25,190
announcement blog post about this
project which people seem to have found

9284
02:58:25,190 --> 02:58:25,200
project which people seem to have found
 

9285
02:58:25,200 --> 02:58:27,110
project which people seem to have found
uh I've been really happy actually that

9286
02:58:27,110 --> 02:58:27,120
uh I've been really happy actually that
 

9287
02:58:27,120 --> 02:58:31,710
uh I've been really happy actually that
people um who uh you know people seem to

9288
02:58:31,710 --> 02:58:31,720
people um who uh you know people seem to
 

9289
02:58:31,720 --> 02:58:35,110
people um who uh you know people seem to
have gred key points from that much

9290
02:58:35,110 --> 02:58:35,120
have gred key points from that much
 

9291
02:58:35,120 --> 02:58:36,870
have gred key points from that much
deeper key points people seem to have

9292
02:58:36,870 --> 02:58:36,880
deeper key points people seem to have
 

9293
02:58:36,880 --> 02:58:39,590
deeper key points people seem to have
gred than I thought they would grock um

9294
02:58:39,590 --> 02:58:39,600
gred than I thought they would grock um
 

9295
02:58:39,600 --> 02:58:41,229
gred than I thought they would grock um
and that that's a kind of a Long blog

9296
02:58:41,229 --> 02:58:41,239
and that that's a kind of a Long blog
 

9297
02:58:41,239 --> 02:58:42,590
and that that's a kind of a Long blog
post that explains some of the things we

9298
02:58:42,590 --> 02:58:42,600
post that explains some of the things we
 

9299
02:58:42,600 --> 02:58:44,070
post that explains some of the things we
talked about like the hypergraph and the

9300
02:58:44,070 --> 02:58:44,080
talked about like the hypergraph and the
 

9301
02:58:44,080 --> 02:58:47,469
talked about like the hypergraph and the
basic rules and uh I don't does it I

9302
02:58:47,469 --> 02:58:47,479
basic rules and uh I don't does it I
 

9303
02:58:47,479 --> 02:58:48,950
basic rules and uh I don't does it I
forget doesn't have any quantum

9304
02:58:48,950 --> 02:58:48,960
forget doesn't have any quantum
 

9305
02:58:48,960 --> 02:58:51,030
forget doesn't have any quantum
mechanics goes through quantum mechanics

9306
02:58:51,030 --> 02:58:51,040
mechanics goes through quantum mechanics
 

9307
02:58:51,040 --> 02:58:53,190
mechanics goes through quantum mechanics
yes it does but we we know a little bit

9308
02:58:53,190 --> 02:58:53,200
yes it does but we we know a little bit
 

9309
02:58:53,200 --> 02:58:56,070
yes it does but we we know a little bit
more since that blog post that probably

9310
02:58:56,070 --> 02:58:56,080
more since that blog post that probably
 

9311
02:58:56,080 --> 02:58:57,910
more since that blog post that probably
clarifies but that blog post is does a

9312
02:58:57,910 --> 02:58:57,920
clarifies but that blog post is does a
 

9313
02:58:57,920 --> 02:59:00,590
clarifies but that blog post is does a
pretty decent job um and you know

9314
02:59:00,590 --> 02:59:00,600
pretty decent job um and you know
 

9315
02:59:00,600 --> 02:59:02,070
pretty decent job um and you know
talking about things like again

9316
02:59:02,070 --> 02:59:02,080
talking about things like again
 

9317
02:59:02,080 --> 02:59:03,190
talking about things like again
something you didn't mention the fact

9318
02:59:03,190 --> 02:59:03,200
something you didn't mention the fact
 

9319
02:59:03,200 --> 02:59:05,150
something you didn't mention the fact
that the uncertainty principle as a

9320
02:59:05,150 --> 02:59:05,160
that the uncertainty principle as a
 

9321
02:59:05,160 --> 02:59:07,750
that the uncertainty principle as a
consequence of curvature in bronal space

9322
02:59:07,750 --> 02:59:07,760
consequence of curvature in bronal space
 

9323
02:59:07,760 --> 02:59:10,229
consequence of curvature in bronal space
how much physics should a person know to

9324
02:59:10,229 --> 02:59:10,239
how much physics should a person know to
 

9325
02:59:10,239 --> 02:59:13,910
how much physics should a person know to
be able to understand the beauty of this

9326
02:59:13,910 --> 02:59:13,920
be able to understand the beauty of this
 

9327
02:59:13,920 --> 02:59:16,590
be able to understand the beauty of this
framework and to contribute something

9328
02:59:16,590 --> 02:59:16,600
framework and to contribute something
 

9329
02:59:16,600 --> 02:59:18,590
framework and to contribute something
novel okay so I I think that

9330
02:59:18,590 --> 02:59:18,600
novel okay so I I think that
 

9331
02:59:18,600 --> 02:59:20,870
novel okay so I I think that
those are different questions so I mean

9332
02:59:20,870 --> 02:59:20,880
those are different questions so I mean
 

9333
02:59:20,880 --> 02:59:23,990
those are different questions so I mean
I think that the why does this work why

9334
02:59:23,990 --> 02:59:24,000
I think that the why does this work why
 

9335
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:27,950
I think that the why does this work why
does this make any sense um uh to really

9336
02:59:27,950 --> 02:59:27,960
does this make any sense um uh to really
 

9337
02:59:27,960 --> 02:59:29,389
does this make any sense um uh to really
know that you have to know a fair amount

9338
02:59:29,389 --> 02:59:29,399
know that you have to know a fair amount
 

9339
02:59:29,399 --> 02:59:33,190
know that you have to know a fair amount
of physics okay um and for example have

9340
02:59:33,190 --> 02:59:33,200
of physics okay um and for example have
 

9341
02:59:33,200 --> 02:59:35,389
of physics okay um and for example have
a why does this work you're you're

9342
02:59:35,389 --> 02:59:35,399
a why does this work you're you're
 

9343
02:59:35,399 --> 02:59:37,510
a why does this work you're you're
referring to the connection between this

9344
02:59:37,510 --> 02:59:37,520
referring to the connection between this
 

9345
02:59:37,520 --> 02:59:40,670
referring to the connection between this
model and general relativity for example

9346
02:59:40,670 --> 02:59:40,680
model and general relativity for example
 

9347
02:59:40,680 --> 02:59:41,750
model and general relativity for example
you have to understand something about

9348
02:59:41,750 --> 02:59:41,760
you have to understand something about
 

9349
02:59:41,760 --> 02:59:44,349
you have to understand something about
General of there there's also a side of

9350
02:59:44,349 --> 02:59:44,359
General of there there's also a side of
 

9351
02:59:44,359 --> 02:59:46,389
General of there there's also a side of
this where just as the pure mathematical

9352
02:59:46,389 --> 02:59:46,399
this where just as the pure mathematical
 

9353
02:59:46,399 --> 02:59:48,790
this where just as the pure mathematical
framework is fascinating yeah yes if you

9354
02:59:48,790 --> 02:59:48,800
framework is fascinating yeah yes if you
 

9355
02:59:48,800 --> 02:59:50,950
framework is fascinating yeah yes if you
throw the physics out then it's quite

9356
02:59:50,950 --> 02:59:50,960
throw the physics out then it's quite
 

9357
02:59:50,960 --> 02:59:53,229
throw the physics out then it's quite
accessible to I mean you know I I wrote

9358
02:59:53,229 --> 02:59:53,239
accessible to I mean you know I I wrote
 

9359
02:59:53,239 --> 02:59:55,229
accessible to I mean you know I I wrote
this sort of long technical introduction

9360
02:59:55,229 --> 02:59:55,239
this sort of long technical introduction
 

9361
02:59:55,239 --> 02:59:57,630
this sort of long technical introduction
to the project which seems to have been

9362
02:59:57,630 --> 02:59:57,640
to the project which seems to have been
 

9363
02:59:57,640 --> 02:59:59,950
to the project which seems to have been
very accessible to people who are you

9364
02:59:59,950 --> 02:59:59,960
very accessible to people who are you
 

9365
02:59:59,960 --> 03:00:01,830
very accessible to people who are you
know who understand computation and and

9366
03:00:01,830 --> 03:00:01,840
know who understand computation and and
 

9367
03:00:01,840 --> 03:00:04,309
know who understand computation and and
formal abstract ideas but are not

9368
03:00:04,309 --> 03:00:04,319
formal abstract ideas but are not
 

9369
03:00:04,319 --> 03:00:06,550
formal abstract ideas but are not
specialists in physics or or other kinds

9370
03:00:06,550 --> 03:00:06,560
specialists in physics or or other kinds
 

9371
03:00:06,560 --> 03:00:08,110
specialists in physics or or other kinds
of things I mean the thing with the

9372
03:00:08,110 --> 03:00:08,120
of things I mean the thing with the
 

9373
03:00:08,120 --> 03:00:11,190
of things I mean the thing with the
physics part of it is you

9374
03:00:11,190 --> 03:00:11,200
physics part of it is you
 

9375
03:00:11,200 --> 03:00:14,670
physics part of it is you
know it's there's both a way of thinking

9376
03:00:14,670 --> 03:00:14,680
know it's there's both a way of thinking
 

9377
03:00:14,680 --> 03:00:16,830
know it's there's both a way of thinking
and a literally a mathematical formalism

9378
03:00:16,830 --> 03:00:16,840
and a literally a mathematical formalism
 

9379
03:00:16,840 --> 03:00:18,630
and a literally a mathematical formalism
I mean it's like you know to know that

9380
03:00:18,630 --> 03:00:18,640
I mean it's like you know to know that
 

9381
03:00:18,640 --> 03:00:20,309
I mean it's like you know to know that
we get the Einstein equations to know we

9382
03:00:20,309 --> 03:00:20,319
we get the Einstein equations to know we
 

9383
03:00:20,319 --> 03:00:22,229
we get the Einstein equations to know we
get the ener of momentum tensor you kind

9384
03:00:22,229 --> 03:00:22,239
get the ener of momentum tensor you kind
 

9385
03:00:22,239 --> 03:00:23,190
get the ener of momentum tensor you kind
of have to know what the energ of

9386
03:00:23,190 --> 03:00:23,200
of have to know what the energ of
 

9387
03:00:23,200 --> 03:00:25,950
of have to know what the energ of
momentum tensor is and that's physics I

9388
03:00:25,950 --> 03:00:25,960
momentum tensor is and that's physics I
 

9389
03:00:25,960 --> 03:00:27,110
momentum tensor is and that's physics I
mean that's kind of graduate level

9390
03:00:27,110 --> 03:00:27,120
mean that's kind of graduate level
 

9391
03:00:27,120 --> 03:00:31,150
mean that's kind of graduate level
physics basically um and uh so so that

9392
03:00:31,150 --> 03:00:31,160
physics basically um and uh so so that
 

9393
03:00:31,160 --> 03:00:33,630
physics basically um and uh so so that
you know making that final connection is

9394
03:00:33,630 --> 03:00:33,640
you know making that final connection is
 

9395
03:00:33,640 --> 03:00:37,309
you know making that final connection is
requires some depth of physics knowledge

9396
03:00:37,309 --> 03:00:37,319
requires some depth of physics knowledge
 

9397
03:00:37,319 --> 03:00:38,870
requires some depth of physics knowledge
I mean that's the unfortunate thing the

9398
03:00:38,870 --> 03:00:38,880
I mean that's the unfortunate thing the
 

9399
03:00:38,880 --> 03:00:40,150
I mean that's the unfortunate thing the
difference between machine learning in

9400
03:00:40,150 --> 03:00:40,160
difference between machine learning in
 

9401
03:00:40,160 --> 03:00:43,510
difference between machine learning in
physics in the 21st century is it uh

9402
03:00:43,510 --> 03:00:43,520
physics in the 21st century is it uh
 

9403
03:00:43,520 --> 03:00:46,229
physics in the 21st century is it uh
really Out Of Reach of a year or two

9404
03:00:46,229 --> 03:00:46,239
really Out Of Reach of a year or two
 

9405
03:00:46,239 --> 03:00:48,510
really Out Of Reach of a year or two
worth of study no you could get it in a

9406
03:00:48,510 --> 03:00:48,520
worth of study no you could get it in a
 

9407
03:00:48,520 --> 03:00:51,030
worth of study no you could get it in a
year or two but you can't get it in a in

9408
03:00:51,030 --> 03:00:51,040
year or two but you can't get it in a in
 

9409
03:00:51,040 --> 03:00:53,510
year or two but you can't get it in a in
a month right I mean so but it doesn't

9410
03:00:53,510 --> 03:00:53,520
a month right I mean so but it doesn't
 

9411
03:00:53,520 --> 03:00:56,389
a month right I mean so but it doesn't
require necessarily like 15 years no it

9412
03:00:56,389 --> 03:00:56,399
require necessarily like 15 years no it
 

9413
03:00:56,399 --> 03:00:58,389
require necessarily like 15 years no it
does not and and in fact a lot of what

9414
03:00:58,389 --> 03:00:58,399
does not and and in fact a lot of what
 

9415
03:00:58,399 --> 03:01:00,710
does not and and in fact a lot of what
has happened with this project makes a

9416
03:01:00,710 --> 03:01:00,720
has happened with this project makes a
 

9417
03:01:00,720 --> 03:01:02,750
has happened with this project makes a
lot of this stuff much more accessible

9418
03:01:02,750 --> 03:01:02,760
lot of this stuff much more accessible
 

9419
03:01:02,760 --> 03:01:04,510
lot of this stuff much more accessible
there are things where it has been quite

9420
03:01:04,510 --> 03:01:04,520
there are things where it has been quite
 

9421
03:01:04,520 --> 03:01:06,150
there are things where it has been quite
difficult to explain what's going on and

9422
03:01:06,150 --> 03:01:06,160
difficult to explain what's going on and
 

9423
03:01:06,160 --> 03:01:09,429
difficult to explain what's going on and
it it requires much more you know having

9424
03:01:09,429 --> 03:01:09,439
it it requires much more you know having
 

9425
03:01:09,439 --> 03:01:10,990
it it requires much more you know having
the concreteness of being able to do

9426
03:01:10,990 --> 03:01:11,000
the concreteness of being able to do
 

9427
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:14,150
the concreteness of being able to do
simulations knowing knowing that this

9428
03:01:14,150 --> 03:01:14,160
simulations knowing knowing that this
 

9429
03:01:14,160 --> 03:01:15,309
simulations knowing knowing that this
thing that you might have thought was

9430
03:01:15,309 --> 03:01:15,319
thing that you might have thought was
 

9431
03:01:15,319 --> 03:01:17,550
thing that you might have thought was
just an analogy is really actually

9432
03:01:17,550 --> 03:01:17,560
just an analogy is really actually
 

9433
03:01:17,560 --> 03:01:20,110
just an analogy is really actually
what's going going on makes one feel

9434
03:01:20,110 --> 03:01:20,120
what's going going on makes one feel
 

9435
03:01:20,120 --> 03:01:21,670
what's going going on makes one feel
much more secure about just sort of

9436
03:01:21,670 --> 03:01:21,680
much more secure about just sort of
 

9437
03:01:21,680 --> 03:01:24,590
much more secure about just sort of
saying this is how this works um and I

9438
03:01:24,590 --> 03:01:24,600
saying this is how this works um and I
 

9439
03:01:24,600 --> 03:01:27,269
saying this is how this works um and I
think it will be you know the I'm hoping

9440
03:01:27,269 --> 03:01:27,279
think it will be you know the I'm hoping
 

9441
03:01:27,279 --> 03:01:28,910
think it will be you know the I'm hoping
the textbooks of the future the physics

9442
03:01:28,910 --> 03:01:28,920
the textbooks of the future the physics
 

9443
03:01:28,920 --> 03:01:30,870
the textbooks of the future the physics
textbooks of the future there will be a

9444
03:01:30,870 --> 03:01:30,880
textbooks of the future there will be a
 

9445
03:01:30,880 --> 03:01:32,630
textbooks of the future there will be a
certain compression there will be things

9446
03:01:32,630 --> 03:01:32,640
certain compression there will be things
 

9447
03:01:32,640 --> 03:01:34,389
certain compression there will be things
that used to be very much more elaborate

9448
03:01:34,389 --> 03:01:34,399
that used to be very much more elaborate
 

9449
03:01:34,399 --> 03:01:35,670
that used to be very much more elaborate
because for example even doing

9450
03:01:35,670 --> 03:01:35,680
because for example even doing
 

9451
03:01:35,680 --> 03:01:37,229
because for example even doing
continuous mathematics versus this

9452
03:01:37,229 --> 03:01:37,239
continuous mathematics versus this
 

9453
03:01:37,239 --> 03:01:40,110
continuous mathematics versus this
discret mathematics you know to know how

9454
03:01:40,110 --> 03:01:40,120
discret mathematics you know to know how
 

9455
03:01:40,120 --> 03:01:41,710
discret mathematics you know to know how
things work in continuous mathematics

9456
03:01:41,710 --> 03:01:41,720
things work in continuous mathematics
 

9457
03:01:41,720 --> 03:01:43,150
things work in continuous mathematics
you have to be talking about stuff and

9458
03:01:43,150 --> 03:01:43,160
you have to be talking about stuff and
 

9459
03:01:43,160 --> 03:01:45,269
you have to be talking about stuff and
waving your hands about things whereas

9460
03:01:45,269 --> 03:01:45,279
waving your hands about things whereas
 

9461
03:01:45,279 --> 03:01:47,269
waving your hands about things whereas
with discreet the discreet version it's

9462
03:01:47,269 --> 03:01:47,279
with discreet the discreet version it's
 

9463
03:01:47,279 --> 03:01:49,750
with discreet the discreet version it's
just like here is a picture this is how

9464
03:01:49,750 --> 03:01:49,760
just like here is a picture this is how
 

9465
03:01:49,760 --> 03:01:52,389
just like here is a picture this is how
it works and there's no oh did we get

9466
03:01:52,389 --> 03:01:52,399
it works and there's no oh did we get
 

9467
03:01:52,399 --> 03:01:54,150
it works and there's no oh did we get
the limit right did this you know did

9468
03:01:54,150 --> 03:01:54,160
the limit right did this you know did
 

9469
03:01:54,160 --> 03:01:57,429
the limit right did this you know did
this thing that is of you know uh zero

9470
03:01:57,429 --> 03:01:57,439
this thing that is of you know uh zero
 

9471
03:01:57,439 --> 03:01:59,830
this thing that is of you know uh zero
you know measure zero object you know

9472
03:01:59,830 --> 03:01:59,840
you know measure zero object you know
 

9473
03:01:59,840 --> 03:02:01,269
you know measure zero object you know
interact with this thing in the right

9474
03:02:01,269 --> 03:02:01,279
interact with this thing in the right
 

9475
03:02:01,279 --> 03:02:02,870
interact with this thing in the right
way you don't have to have that whole

9476
03:02:02,870 --> 03:02:02,880
way you don't have to have that whole
 

9477
03:02:02,880 --> 03:02:04,349
way you don't have to have that whole
discussion it's just like here's a

9478
03:02:04,349 --> 03:02:04,359
discussion it's just like here's a
 

9479
03:02:04,359 --> 03:02:07,150
discussion it's just like here's a
picture you know this is what it does

9480
03:02:07,150 --> 03:02:07,160
picture you know this is what it does
 

9481
03:02:07,160 --> 03:02:08,950
picture you know this is what it does
and you know you can then it takes more

9482
03:02:08,950 --> 03:02:08,960
and you know you can then it takes more
 

9483
03:02:08,960 --> 03:02:10,229
and you know you can then it takes more
effort to say what does it do in the

9484
03:02:10,229 --> 03:02:10,239
effort to say what does it do in the
 

9485
03:02:10,239 --> 03:02:12,110
effort to say what does it do in the
limit when the picture gets very big but

9486
03:02:12,110 --> 03:02:12,120
limit when the picture gets very big but
 

9487
03:02:12,120 --> 03:02:13,590
limit when the picture gets very big but
you can do experiments to build up an

9488
03:02:13,590 --> 03:02:13,600
you can do experiments to build up an
 

9489
03:02:13,600 --> 03:02:15,510
you can do experiments to build up an
intuition actually yes right and you can

9490
03:02:15,510 --> 03:02:15,520
intuition actually yes right and you can
 

9491
03:02:15,520 --> 03:02:17,030
intuition actually yes right and you can
get sort of core intuition for what's

9492
03:02:17,030 --> 03:02:17,040
get sort of core intuition for what's
 

9493
03:02:17,040 --> 03:02:19,070
get sort of core intuition for what's
going on now in terms of contributing to

9494
03:02:19,070 --> 03:02:19,080
going on now in terms of contributing to
 

9495
03:02:19,080 --> 03:02:21,389
going on now in terms of contributing to
this the you know I would say that the

9496
03:02:21,389 --> 03:02:21,399
this the you know I would say that the
 

9497
03:02:21,399 --> 03:02:23,269
this the you know I would say that the
study of the computational universe and

9498
03:02:23,269 --> 03:02:23,279
study of the computational universe and
 

9499
03:02:23,279 --> 03:02:24,630
study of the computational universe and
how all these programs work in the

9500
03:02:24,630 --> 03:02:24,640
how all these programs work in the
 

9501
03:02:24,640 --> 03:02:26,710
how all these programs work in the
computational universe there's just an

9502
03:02:26,710 --> 03:02:26,720
computational universe there's just an
 

9503
03:02:26,720 --> 03:02:29,469
computational universe there's just an
unbelievable amount to do there and it

9504
03:02:29,469 --> 03:02:29,479
unbelievable amount to do there and it
 

9505
03:02:29,479 --> 03:02:32,229
unbelievable amount to do there and it
is very close to the surface that is you

9506
03:02:32,229 --> 03:02:32,239
is very close to the surface that is you
 

9507
03:02:32,239 --> 03:02:35,070
is very close to the surface that is you
know high school kids you can do

9508
03:02:35,070 --> 03:02:35,080
know high school kids you can do
 

9509
03:02:35,080 --> 03:02:38,070
know high school kids you can do
experiments it's not um you know and you

9510
03:02:38,070 --> 03:02:38,080
experiments it's not um you know and you
 

9511
03:02:38,080 --> 03:02:40,429
experiments it's not um you know and you
can discover things I mean you know we

9512
03:02:40,429 --> 03:02:40,439
can discover things I mean you know we
 

9513
03:02:40,439 --> 03:02:42,790
can discover things I mean you know we
you can discover stuff about I don't

9514
03:02:42,790 --> 03:02:42,800
you can discover stuff about I don't
 

9515
03:02:42,800 --> 03:02:44,309
you can discover stuff about I don't
know like this thing about expansion of

9516
03:02:44,309 --> 03:02:44,319
know like this thing about expansion of
 

9517
03:02:44,319 --> 03:02:45,910
know like this thing about expansion of
bronal space that's an absolutely

9518
03:02:45,910 --> 03:02:45,920
bronal space that's an absolutely
 

9519
03:02:45,920 --> 03:02:48,469
bronal space that's an absolutely
accessible thing to look at now now you

9520
03:02:48,469 --> 03:02:48,479
accessible thing to look at now now you
 

9521
03:02:48,479 --> 03:02:50,309
accessible thing to look at now now you
know the main issue with doing these

9522
03:02:50,309 --> 03:02:50,319
know the main issue with doing these
 

9523
03:02:50,319 --> 03:02:52,710
know the main issue with doing these
things is not there isn't a lot of

9524
03:02:52,710 --> 03:02:52,720
things is not there isn't a lot of
 

9525
03:02:52,720 --> 03:02:56,349
things is not there isn't a lot of
technical depth difficulty there the

9526
03:02:56,349 --> 03:02:56,359
technical depth difficulty there the
 

9527
03:02:56,359 --> 03:02:58,030
technical depth difficulty there the
actual doing of the experiments you know

9528
03:02:58,030 --> 03:02:58,040
actual doing of the experiments you know
 

9529
03:02:58,040 --> 03:03:00,030
actual doing of the experiments you know
all the code is all on our website to do

9530
03:03:00,030 --> 03:03:00,040
all the code is all on our website to do
 

9531
03:03:00,040 --> 03:03:02,990
all the code is all on our website to do
all these things the real thing is sort

9532
03:03:02,990 --> 03:03:03,000
all these things the real thing is sort
 

9533
03:03:03,000 --> 03:03:04,790
all these things the real thing is sort
of the Judgment of what's the right

9534
03:03:04,790 --> 03:03:04,800
of the Judgment of what's the right
 

9535
03:03:04,800 --> 03:03:06,429
of the Judgment of what's the right
experiment to do how do you interpret

9536
03:03:06,429 --> 03:03:06,439
experiment to do how do you interpret
 

9537
03:03:06,439 --> 03:03:09,710
experiment to do how do you interpret
what you see that's the part that you

9538
03:03:09,710 --> 03:03:09,720
what you see that's the part that you
 

9539
03:03:09,720 --> 03:03:11,870
what you see that's the part that you
know people will do amazing things with

9540
03:03:11,870 --> 03:03:11,880
know people will do amazing things with
 

9541
03:03:11,880 --> 03:03:13,710
know people will do amazing things with
and that's the part that but but it

9542
03:03:13,710 --> 03:03:13,720
and that's the part that but but it
 

9543
03:03:13,720 --> 03:03:15,550
and that's the part that but but it
isn't like you have to have done 10

9544
03:03:15,550 --> 03:03:15,560
isn't like you have to have done 10
 

9545
03:03:15,560 --> 03:03:17,830
isn't like you have to have done 10
years of of study to get to the point

9546
03:03:17,830 --> 03:03:17,840
years of of study to get to the point
 

9547
03:03:17,840 --> 03:03:19,590
years of of study to get to the point
where you can do the experiments you D

9548
03:03:19,590 --> 03:03:19,600
where you can do the experiments you D
 

9549
03:03:19,600 --> 03:03:21,190
where you can do the experiments you D
the cool thing you can do experiments

9550
03:03:21,190 --> 03:03:21,200
the cool thing you can do experiments
 

9551
03:03:21,200 --> 03:03:23,750
the cool thing you can do experiments
day one basically it's that that that's

9552
03:03:23,750 --> 03:03:23,760
day one basically it's that that that's
 

9553
03:03:23,760 --> 03:03:25,349
day one basically it's that that that's
the amazing thing about and you've

9554
03:03:25,349 --> 03:03:25,359
the amazing thing about and you've
 

9555
03:03:25,359 --> 03:03:27,469
the amazing thing about and you've
actually put the tools out there it's

9556
03:03:27,469 --> 03:03:27,479
actually put the tools out there it's
 

9557
03:03:27,479 --> 03:03:30,550
actually put the tools out there it's
beautiful it's mysterious uh there's

9558
03:03:30,550 --> 03:03:30,560
beautiful it's mysterious uh there's
 

9559
03:03:30,560 --> 03:03:32,389
beautiful it's mysterious uh there's
still I would say maybe you can correct

9560
03:03:32,389 --> 03:03:32,399
still I would say maybe you can correct
 

9561
03:03:32,399 --> 03:03:33,950
still I would say maybe you can correct
me it feels like there's a huge number

9562
03:03:33,950 --> 03:03:33,960
me it feels like there's a huge number
 

9563
03:03:33,960 --> 03:03:36,670
me it feels like there's a huge number
of L hanging fruit oh on the

9564
03:03:36,670 --> 03:03:36,680
of L hanging fruit oh on the
 

9565
03:03:36,680 --> 03:03:38,710
of L hanging fruit oh on the
mathematical side at least not the not

9566
03:03:38,710 --> 03:03:38,720
mathematical side at least not the not
 

9567
03:03:38,720 --> 03:03:40,910
mathematical side at least not the not
the physics side perhaps no no there's

9568
03:03:40,910 --> 03:03:40,920
the physics side perhaps no no there's
 

9569
03:03:40,920 --> 03:03:43,590
the physics side perhaps no no there's
look on the on the okay on the physics

9570
03:03:43,590 --> 03:03:43,600
look on the on the okay on the physics
 

9571
03:03:43,600 --> 03:03:45,910
look on the on the okay on the physics
side we are we're definitely in

9572
03:03:45,910 --> 03:03:45,920
side we are we're definitely in
 

9573
03:03:45,920 --> 03:03:48,510
side we are we're definitely in
harvesting mode you know

9574
03:03:48,510 --> 03:03:48,520
harvesting mode you know
 

9575
03:03:48,520 --> 03:03:50,349
harvesting mode you know
of which which fruit the low hanging

9576
03:03:50,349 --> 03:03:50,359
of which which fruit the low hanging
 

9577
03:03:50,359 --> 03:03:52,590
of which which fruit the low hanging
ones or the low hanging ones yeah right

9578
03:03:52,590 --> 03:03:52,600
ones or the low hanging ones yeah right
 

9579
03:03:52,600 --> 03:03:54,150
ones or the low hanging ones yeah right
I mean basically here's the thing

9580
03:03:54,150 --> 03:03:54,160
I mean basically here's the thing
 

9581
03:03:54,160 --> 03:03:56,269
I mean basically here's the thing
there's a certain list of you know here

9582
03:03:56,269 --> 03:03:56,279
there's a certain list of you know here
 

9583
03:03:56,279 --> 03:03:57,750
there's a certain list of you know here
are the effects in quantum mechanics

9584
03:03:57,750 --> 03:03:57,760
are the effects in quantum mechanics
 

9585
03:03:57,760 --> 03:03:59,790
are the effects in quantum mechanics
here are the effects in general activity

9586

here are the effects in general activity
 

9587
03:03:59,800 --> 03:04:02,150
here are the effects in general activity
it's just like industrial harvesting

9588
03:04:02,150 --> 03:04:02,160
it's just like industrial harvesting
 

9589
03:04:02,160 --> 03:04:04,150
it's just like industrial harvesting
it's like can we get this one this one

are we going to get this one one how
 

9605
03:04:18,520 --> 03:04:21,830
are we going to get this one one how
hard is this one it's like oh you know

9606
03:04:21,830 --> 03:04:21,840
hard is this one it's like oh you know
 

9607
03:04:21,840 --> 03:04:23,349
hard is this one it's like oh you know
it looks really hard it looks really

it looks really hard it looks really
 

9609
03:04:23,359 --> 03:04:27,309
it looks really hard it looks really
hard oh actually we can get it um and uh

9610
03:04:27,309 --> 03:04:27,319
hard oh actually we can get it um and uh
 

9611
03:04:27,319 --> 03:04:28,990
hard oh actually we can get it um and uh
and you're you're continually surprised

9612
03:04:28,990 --> 03:04:29,000
and you're you're continually surprised
 

9613
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:30,389
and you're you're continually surprised
I mean it seems like I've been following

9614
03:04:30,389 --> 03:04:30,399
I mean it seems like I've been following
 

9615
03:04:30,399 --> 03:04:32,710
I mean it seems like I've been following
your progress It's kind of exciting all

9616
03:04:32,710 --> 03:04:32,720
your progress It's kind of exciting all
 

9617
03:04:32,720 --> 03:04:34,950
your progress It's kind of exciting all
the in harvesting mode all the things

9618
03:04:34,950 --> 03:04:34,960
the in harvesting mode all the things
 

9619
03:04:34,960 --> 03:04:36,389
the in harvesting mode all the things
you're picking up along the way right

9620
03:04:36,389 --> 03:04:36,399
you're picking up along the way right
 

9621
03:04:36,399 --> 03:04:37,790
you're picking up along the way right
right no I mean it's it's the thing that

9622
03:04:37,790 --> 03:04:37,800
right no I mean it's it's the thing that
 

9623
03:04:37,800 --> 03:04:39,630
right no I mean it's it's the thing that
is I keep on thinking it's going to be

9624
03:04:39,630 --> 03:04:39,640
is I keep on thinking it's going to be
 

9625
03:04:39,640 --> 03:04:41,190
is I keep on thinking it's going to be
more difficult than it is now that's a

9626
03:04:41,190 --> 03:04:41,200
more difficult than it is now that's a
 

9627
03:04:41,200 --> 03:04:43,429
more difficult than it is now that's a
you know that's a who knows what um I

9628
03:04:43,429 --> 03:04:43,439
you know that's a who knows what um I
 

9629
03:04:43,439 --> 03:04:46,030
you know that's a who knows what um I
mean the one thing so the the the um the

9630
03:04:46,030 --> 03:04:46,040
mean the one thing so the the the um the
 

9631
03:04:46,040 --> 03:04:48,150
mean the one thing so the the the um the
thing that's been was

9632
03:04:48,150 --> 03:04:48,160
thing that's been was
 

9633
03:04:48,160 --> 03:04:49,590
thing that's been was
big thing that I think we're we're

9634
03:04:49,590 --> 03:04:49,600
big thing that I think we're we're
 

9635
03:04:49,600 --> 03:04:51,590
big thing that I think we're we're
pretty close to I mean I can give you a

9636
03:04:51,590 --> 03:04:51,600
pretty close to I mean I can give you a
 

9637
03:04:51,600 --> 03:04:52,790
pretty close to I mean I can give you a
little bit of the road map it's sort of

9638
03:04:52,790 --> 03:04:52,800
little bit of the road map it's sort of
 

9639
03:04:52,800 --> 03:04:55,070
little bit of the road map it's sort of
interesting to see is like what are

9640
03:04:55,070 --> 03:04:55,080
interesting to see is like what are
 

9641
03:04:55,080 --> 03:04:56,870
interesting to see is like what are
particles what are things like electrons

9642
03:04:56,870 --> 03:04:56,880
particles what are things like electrons
 

9643
03:04:56,880 --> 03:04:59,070
particles what are things like electrons
how do they really work um are you close

9644
03:04:59,070 --> 03:04:59,080
how do they really work um are you close
 

9645
03:04:59,080 --> 03:05:01,830
how do they really work um are you close
to get like what what's uh are you close

9646
03:05:01,830 --> 03:05:01,840
to get like what what's uh are you close
 

9647
03:05:01,840 --> 03:05:03,790
to get like what what's uh are you close
to trying to understand like the atom

9648
03:05:03,790 --> 03:05:03,800
to trying to understand like the atom
 

9649
03:05:03,800 --> 03:05:06,150
to trying to understand like the atom
the electrons neutrons

9650
03:05:06,150 --> 03:05:06,160
the electrons neutrons
 

9651
03:05:06,160 --> 03:05:08,389
the electrons neutrons
protons this is this is the stack so the

9652
03:05:08,389 --> 03:05:08,399
protons this is this is the stack so the
 

9653
03:05:08,399 --> 03:05:11,670
protons this is this is the stack so the
first thing we want to understand is uh

9654
03:05:11,670 --> 03:05:11,680
first thing we want to understand is uh
 

9655
03:05:11,680 --> 03:05:14,630
first thing we want to understand is uh
the quantization of spin so particles

9656
03:05:14,630 --> 03:05:14,640
the quantization of spin so particles
 

9657
03:05:14,640 --> 03:05:16,229
the quantization of spin so particles
they they kind of spin they have a

9658
03:05:16,229 --> 03:05:16,239
they they kind of spin they have a
 

9659
03:05:16,239 --> 03:05:18,190
they they kind of spin they have a
certain Ang angular momentum that

9660
03:05:18,190 --> 03:05:18,200
certain Ang angular momentum that
 

9661
03:05:18,200 --> 03:05:20,870
certain Ang angular momentum that
angular momentum even though the masses

9662
03:05:20,870 --> 03:05:20,880
angular momentum even though the masses
 

9663
03:05:20,880 --> 03:05:22,269
angular momentum even though the masses
of particles are all over the place you

9664
03:05:22,269 --> 03:05:22,279
of particles are all over the place you
 

9665
03:05:22,279 --> 03:05:25,670
of particles are all over the place you
know the electron has a mass of 511 M

9666
03:05:25,670 --> 03:05:25,680
know the electron has a mass of 511 M
 

9667
03:05:25,680 --> 03:05:28,429
know the electron has a mass of 511 M
the but you know the proton is 938 M etc

9668
03:05:28,429 --> 03:05:28,439
the but you know the proton is 938 M etc
 

9669
03:05:28,439 --> 03:05:29,750
the but you know the proton is 938 M etc
etc etc they're all kind of random

9670
03:05:29,750 --> 03:05:29,760
etc etc they're all kind of random
 

9671
03:05:29,760 --> 03:05:32,269
etc etc they're all kind of random
numbers the the spins of all these

9672
03:05:32,269 --> 03:05:32,279
numbers the the spins of all these
 

9673
03:05:32,279 --> 03:05:33,830
numbers the the spins of all these
particles are either integers or half

9674
03:05:33,830 --> 03:05:33,840
particles are either integers or half
 

9675
03:05:33,840 --> 03:05:35,950
particles are either integers or half
integers and that's a fact that was

9676
03:05:35,950 --> 03:05:35,960
integers and that's a fact that was
 

9677
03:05:35,960 --> 03:05:40,590
integers and that's a fact that was
discovered in the 1920s I guess um the U

9678
03:05:40,590 --> 03:05:40,600
discovered in the 1920s I guess um the U
 

9679
03:05:40,600 --> 03:05:43,910
discovered in the 1920s I guess um the U
uh I think that we are close to

9680
03:05:43,910 --> 03:05:43,920
uh I think that we are close to
 

9681
03:05:43,920 --> 03:05:46,190
uh I think that we are close to
understanding why spin is quantized um

9682
03:05:46,190 --> 03:05:46,200
understanding why spin is quantized um
 

9683
03:05:46,200 --> 03:05:48,550
understanding why spin is quantized um
and that's a and it it appears to be a

9684
03:05:48,550 --> 03:05:48,560
and that's a and it it appears to be a
 

9685
03:05:48,560 --> 03:05:50,630
and that's a and it it appears to be a
quite elaborate mathematical story about

9686
03:05:50,630 --> 03:05:50,640
quite elaborate mathematical story about
 

9687
03:05:50,640 --> 03:05:53,349
quite elaborate mathematical story about
homotopic groups in twist space and all

9688
03:05:53,349 --> 03:05:53,359
homotopic groups in twist space and all
 

9689
03:05:53,359 --> 03:05:56,469
homotopic groups in twist space and all
kinds of things but bottom line is that

9690
03:05:56,469 --> 03:05:56,479
kinds of things but bottom line is that
 

9691
03:05:56,479 --> 03:05:58,830
kinds of things but bottom line is that
seems Within Reach and that's that's a

9692
03:05:58,830 --> 03:05:58,840
seems Within Reach and that's that's a
 

9693
03:05:58,840 --> 03:06:00,710
seems Within Reach and that's that's a
big deal because that's a very core

9694
03:06:00,710 --> 03:06:00,720
big deal because that's a very core
 

9695
03:06:00,720 --> 03:06:02,429
big deal because that's a very core
feature of understanding how particles

9696
03:06:02,429 --> 03:06:02,439
feature of understanding how particles
 

9697
03:06:02,439 --> 03:06:04,830
feature of understanding how particles
work in quantum mechanics another core

9698
03:06:04,830 --> 03:06:04,840
work in quantum mechanics another core
 

9699
03:06:04,840 --> 03:06:06,950
work in quantum mechanics another core
feature is this difference between

03:06:06,950 --> 03:06:06,960
feature is this difference between
 

9701
03:06:06,960 --> 03:06:08,309
feature is this difference between
particles that obey the Exclusion

9702
03:06:08,309 --> 03:06:08,319
particles that obey the Exclusion
 

9703
03:06:08,319 --> 03:06:11,190
particles that obey the Exclusion
Principle and sort of stay apart that

9704
03:06:11,190 --> 03:06:11,200
Principle and sort of stay apart that
 

9705
03:06:11,200 --> 03:06:12,750
Principle and sort of stay apart that
leads to the stability of matter and

9706
03:06:12,750 --> 03:06:12,760
leads to the stability of matter and
 

9707
03:06:12,760 --> 03:06:14,670
leads to the stability of matter and
things like that and particles that love

9708
03:06:14,670 --> 03:06:14,680
things like that and particles that love
 

9709
03:06:14,680 --> 03:06:16,790
things like that and particles that love
to get together and be in the same state

9710
03:06:16,790 --> 03:06:16,800
to get together and be in the same state
 

9711
03:06:16,800 --> 03:06:18,309
to get together and be in the same state
things like photons

9712
03:06:18,309 --> 03:06:18,319
things like photons
 

9713
03:06:18,319 --> 03:06:20,110
things like photons
that um and that's what leads to

9714
03:06:20,110 --> 03:06:20,120
that um and that's what leads to
 

9715
03:06:20,120 --> 03:06:22,750
that um and that's what leads to
phenomena like lasers um where you can

9716
03:06:22,750 --> 03:06:22,760
phenomena like lasers um where you can
 

9717
03:06:22,760 --> 03:06:24,429
phenomena like lasers um where you can
get sort of coherently everything in the

9718
03:06:24,429 --> 03:06:24,439
get sort of coherently everything in the
 

9719
03:06:24,439 --> 03:06:27,830
get sort of coherently everything in the
same state that difference is the

9720
03:06:27,830 --> 03:06:27,840
same state that difference is the
 

9721
03:06:27,840 --> 03:06:30,550
same state that difference is the
particles of integer spin or bons like

9722
03:06:30,550 --> 03:06:30,560
particles of integer spin or bons like
 

9723
03:06:30,560 --> 03:06:31,870
particles of integer spin or bons like
to get together in the same state the

9724
03:06:31,870 --> 03:06:31,880
to get together in the same state the
 

9725
03:06:31,880 --> 03:06:34,429
to get together in the same state the
particles of half integer spin of ferons

9726
03:06:34,429 --> 03:06:34,439
particles of half integer spin of ferons
 

9727
03:06:34,439 --> 03:06:36,670
particles of half integer spin of ferons
like electrons that they tend to stay

9728
03:06:36,670 --> 03:06:36,680
like electrons that they tend to stay
 

9729
03:06:36,680 --> 03:06:39,950
like electrons that they tend to stay
apart and um so the question is can we

9730
03:06:39,950 --> 03:06:39,960
apart and um so the question is can we
 

9731
03:06:39,960 --> 03:06:42,750
apart and um so the question is can we
can we get that in our models and uh oh

9732
03:06:42,750 --> 03:06:42,760
can we get that in our models and uh oh
 

9733
03:06:42,760 --> 03:06:45,150
can we get that in our models and uh oh
just the last few days I think we made

9734
03:06:45,150 --> 03:06:45,160
just the last few days I think we made
 

9735
03:06:45,160 --> 03:06:48,229
just the last few days I think we made
um I mean I think the story of um I mean

9736
03:06:48,229 --> 03:06:48,239
um I mean I think the story of um I mean
 

9737
03:06:48,239 --> 03:06:49,870
um I mean I think the story of um I mean
it's it's it's one of these things where

9738
03:06:49,870 --> 03:06:49,880
it's it's it's one of these things where
 

9739
03:06:49,880 --> 03:06:51,950
it's it's it's one of these things where
we're really close it's is this connect

9740
03:06:51,950 --> 03:06:51,960
we're really close it's is this connect
 

9741
03:06:51,960 --> 03:06:54,790
we're really close it's is this connect
to fans and bans you you talking so this

9742
03:06:54,790 --> 03:06:54,800
to fans and bans you you talking so this
 

9743
03:06:54,800 --> 03:06:57,150
to fans and bans you you talking so this
was what happens is what seems to happen

9744
03:06:57,150 --> 03:06:57,160
was what happens is what seems to happen
 

9745
03:06:57,160 --> 03:06:59,870
was what happens is what seems to happen
okay it's you know subject to revision

9746
03:06:59,870 --> 03:06:59,880
okay it's you know subject to revision
 

9747
03:06:59,880 --> 03:07:02,110
okay it's you know subject to revision
next even next few days but what seems

9748
03:07:02,110 --> 03:07:02,120
next even next few days but what seems
 

9749
03:07:02,120 --> 03:07:05,190
next even next few days but what seems
to be the case is that uh bons are

9750
03:07:05,190 --> 03:07:05,200
to be the case is that uh bons are
 

9751
03:07:05,200 --> 03:07:06,990
to be the case is that uh bons are
associated with essentially merging in

multi-way graphs and firion are
 

9755
03:07:09,200 --> 03:07:11,030
multi-way graphs and firion are

associated with branching in multi-way
 

9757
03:07:11,040 --> 03:07:13,630
associated with branching in multi-way

03:07:13,630 --> 03:07:13,640
graphs and that essentially the
 

9759
03:07:13,640 --> 03:07:16,870

03:07:16,870 --> 03:07:16,880
Exclusion Principle is the fact that in
 

9761
03:07:16,880 --> 03:07:19,349
Exclusion Principle is the fact that in
branchial space things have a certain

9762
03:07:19,349 --> 03:07:19,359
branchial space things have a certain
 

9763
03:07:19,359 --> 03:07:22,389
branchial space things have a certain
extent in branchial space that in which

9764
03:07:22,389 --> 03:07:22,399
extent in branchial space that in which
 

9765
03:07:22,399 --> 03:07:24,030
extent in branchial space that in which
things are being sort of forced apart in

9766
03:07:24,030 --> 03:07:24,040
things are being sort of forced apart in
 

9767
03:07:24,040 --> 03:07:26,349
things are being sort of forced apart in
branchial space whereas the case of bans

9768
03:07:26,349 --> 03:07:26,359

03:07:27,990 --> 03:07:28,000
they get they they Clump together in
 

9771
03:07:28,000 --> 03:07:30,870
they get they they Clump together in
branchial space and the real question is

9772
03:07:30,870 --> 03:07:30,880
branchial space and the real question is
 

9773
03:07:30,880 --> 03:07:32,670
branchial space and the real question is
can we explain the relationship between

9774
03:07:32,670 --> 03:07:32,680
can we explain the relationship between
 

9775
03:07:32,680 --> 03:07:34,510
can we explain the relationship between
that and these things called Spinners

9776
03:07:34,510 --> 03:07:34,520
that and these things called Spinners
 

9777
03:07:34,520 --> 03:07:35,830
that and these things called Spinners
which are the representation of half

03:07:35,830 --> 03:07:35,840
which are the representation of half
 

9779

03:07:37,870 --> 03:07:37,880
integer spin particles that have this
 

9781
03:07:37,880 --> 03:07:39,269
integer spin particles that have this
weird feature that usually when you go

9782
03:07:39,269 --> 03:07:39,279
weird feature that usually when you go
 

9783
03:07:39,279 --> 03:07:42,030
weird feature that usually when you go
around 360° rotation you get back to

9784
03:07:42,030 --> 03:07:42,040
around 360° rotation you get back to
 

9785
03:07:42,040 --> 03:07:44,110
around 360° rotation you get back to
where you started from but for a spinner

9786
03:07:44,110 --> 03:07:44,120
where you started from but for a spinner
 

9787
03:07:44,120 --> 03:07:45,429
where you started from but for a spinner
you don't get back to where you started

03:07:45,429 --> 03:07:45,439
you don't get back to where you started
 

9789
03:07:45,439 --> 03:07:48,590
you don't get back to where you started
from it takes 720 of rotation to get

9790
03:07:48,590 --> 03:07:48,600
from it takes 720 of rotation to get
 

9791
03:07:48,600 --> 03:07:50,510
from it takes 720 of rotation to get
back to where you started from and we

9792
03:07:50,510 --> 03:07:50,520
back to where you started from and we
 

9793
03:07:50,520 --> 03:07:53,630
back to where you started from and we
are just it feels like we are we're just

03:07:53,630 --> 03:07:53,640
are just it feels like we are we're just

incredibly close to actually having that

03:07:55,710 --> 03:07:55,720
incredibly close to actually having that
 

9797
03:07:55,720 --> 03:07:57,389
incredibly close to actually having that
understanding how that works and it

9798
03:07:57,389 --> 03:07:57,399
understanding how that works and it
 

9799
03:07:57,399 --> 03:07:59,510
understanding how that works and it
turns out it looks like my current

9800
03:07:59,510 --> 03:07:59,520
turns out it looks like my current
 

9801
03:07:59,520 --> 03:08:02,670
turns out it looks like my current
speculation is that it's as simple as

03:08:02,670 --> 03:08:02,680
speculation is that it's as simple as
 

9803
03:08:02,680 --> 03:08:05,349
speculation is that it's as simple as

03:08:09,389 --> 03:08:09,399
the relationship between Spinners and
 

9809
03:08:09,399 --> 03:08:11,389
the relationship between Spinners and

03:08:11,389 --> 03:08:11,399
vectors so which is just nice
 

9811
03:08:11,399 --> 03:08:12,349

interesting if these are all these kind
 

9815
03:08:13,800 --> 03:08:17,030

9819
03:08:20,239 --> 03:08:22,229

03:08:22,229 --> 03:08:22,239
have been very mysterious and if that's
 

9821
03:08:22,239 --> 03:08:24,110
have been very mysterious and if that's
what they turn out to be there's going

03:08:26,429 --> 03:08:26,439
to be an easy explanation directed vers
 

9825
03:08:26,439 --> 03:08:28,670
to be an easy explanation directed vers
undirected it's just and that's why

9826
03:08:28,670 --> 03:08:28,680
undirected it's just and that's why
 

9827
03:08:28,680 --> 03:08:31,790
undirected it's just and that's why
there's only two different cases it's

there's only two different cases it's
 

9829
03:08:31,800 --> 03:08:33,710
there's only two different cases it's
why are Spinners important in quantum

9830
03:08:33,710 --> 03:08:33,720
why are Spinners important in quantum
 

9831
03:08:33,720 --> 03:08:36,030
why are Spinners important in quantum
mechanics can you just give a yeah so

9832
03:08:36,030 --> 03:08:36,040
mechanics can you just give a yeah so
 

9833
03:08:36,040 --> 03:08:38,590
mechanics can you just give a yeah so
Spinners are important because they are

9834
03:08:38,590 --> 03:08:38,600
Spinners are important because they are
 

9835
03:08:38,600 --> 03:08:40,870
Spinners are important because they are
um they're the representation of of for

9836
03:08:40,870 --> 03:08:40,880
um they're the representation of of for
 

9837
03:08:40,880 --> 03:08:43,670
um they're the representation of of for
electrons which have half anra spin they

9838
03:08:43,670 --> 03:08:43,680
electrons which have half anra spin they
 

9839
03:08:43,680 --> 03:08:46,950
electrons which have half anra spin they
are the the wave functions of electrons

9840
03:08:46,950 --> 03:08:46,960
are the the wave functions of electrons
 

9841
03:08:46,960 --> 03:08:49,110
are the the wave functions of electrons
are spin Spinners just like the wave

9842
03:08:49,110 --> 03:08:49,120
are spin Spinners just like the wave
 

9843
03:08:49,120 --> 03:08:51,389
are spin Spinners just like the wave
functions of photons are vectors the

9844
03:08:51,389 --> 03:08:51,399
functions of photons are vectors the
 

9845
03:08:51,399 --> 03:08:54,389
functions of photons are vectors the
wave functions of electrons are Spinners

9846
03:08:54,389 --> 03:08:54,399
wave functions of electrons are Spinners
 

9847
03:08:54,399 --> 03:08:56,990
wave functions of electrons are Spinners
and and they have this property that

9848
03:08:56,990 --> 03:08:57,000
and and they have this property that
 

9849
03:08:57,000 --> 03:09:00,389
and and they have this property that
when you rotate by by 360° they come

9850
03:09:00,389 --> 03:09:00,399
when you rotate by by 360° they come
 

9851
03:09:00,399 --> 03:09:03,389
when you rotate by by 360° they come
back to minus1 of themselves and take

9852
03:09:03,389 --> 03:09:03,399
back to minus1 of themselves and take
 

9853
03:09:03,399 --> 03:09:06,830
back to minus1 of themselves and take
720° to get back to the original value

9854
03:09:06,830 --> 03:09:06,840
720° to get back to the original value
 

9855
03:09:06,840 --> 03:09:09,950
720° to get back to the original value
and and they are a consequence of of um

9856
03:09:09,950 --> 03:09:09,960
and and they are a consequence of of um
 

9857
03:09:09,960 --> 03:09:13,070
and and they are a consequence of of um
uh in we usually think of of of rotation

9858
03:09:13,070 --> 03:09:13,080
uh in we usually think of of of rotation
 

9859
03:09:13,080 --> 03:09:16,070
uh in we usually think of of of rotation
in space as being you know when you have

9860
03:09:16,070 --> 03:09:16,080
in space as being you know when you have
 

9861
03:09:16,080 --> 03:09:19,150
in space as being you know when you have
this notion of rotation invariance and

9862
03:09:19,150 --> 03:09:19,160
this notion of rotation invariance and
 

9863
03:09:19,160 --> 03:09:21,229
this notion of rotation invariance and
rotational invariance as we ordinarily

9864
03:09:21,229 --> 03:09:21,239
rotational invariance as we ordinarily
 

9865
03:09:21,239 --> 03:09:23,070
rotational invariance as we ordinarily
experience it doesn't have the feature

9866
03:09:23,070 --> 03:09:23,080
experience it doesn't have the feature
 

9867
03:09:23,080 --> 03:09:24,950
experience it doesn't have the feature
you know if you go through 360° you go

9868
03:09:24,950 --> 03:09:24,960
you know if you go through 360° you go
 

9869
03:09:24,960 --> 03:09:26,590
you know if you go through 360° you go
back to where you started from but

9870
03:09:26,590 --> 03:09:26,600
back to where you started from but
 

9871
03:09:26,600 --> 03:09:29,389
back to where you started from but
that's not true for electrons and so

9872
03:09:29,389 --> 03:09:29,399
that's not true for electrons and so
 

9873
03:09:29,399 --> 03:09:31,349
that's not true for electrons and so
that's that's why understanding how that

9874
03:09:31,349 --> 03:09:31,359
that's that's why understanding how that
 

9875
03:09:31,359 --> 03:09:32,870
that's that's why understanding how that
works is important yeah I've been

9876
03:09:32,870 --> 03:09:32,880
works is important yeah I've been
 

9877
03:09:32,880 --> 03:09:35,510
works is important yeah I've been
playing with Mobius uh strip quite a bit

9878
03:09:35,510 --> 03:09:35,520
playing with Mobius uh strip quite a bit
 

9879
03:09:35,520 --> 03:09:38,670
playing with Mobius uh strip quite a bit
lately just for fun and yes yes it adds

9880
03:09:38,670 --> 03:09:38,680
lately just for fun and yes yes it adds
 

9881
03:09:38,680 --> 03:09:40,710
lately just for fun and yes yes it adds
some funk it has the same kind of funky

9882
03:09:40,710 --> 03:09:40,720
some funk it has the same kind of funky
 

9883
03:09:40,720 --> 03:09:42,030
some funk it has the same kind of funky
properties yes right exactly you can

9884
03:09:42,030 --> 03:09:42,040
properties yes right exactly you can
 

9885
03:09:42,040 --> 03:09:43,870
properties yes right exactly you can
have this the So-Cal belt trick which is

9886
03:09:43,870 --> 03:09:43,880
have this the So-Cal belt trick which is
 

9887
03:09:43,880 --> 03:09:45,910
have this the So-Cal belt trick which is
this way of taking an extended object

9888
03:09:45,910 --> 03:09:45,920
this way of taking an extended object
 

9889
03:09:45,920 --> 03:09:47,830
this way of taking an extended object
and you can see properties like SP with

9890
03:09:47,830 --> 03:09:47,840
and you can see properties like SP with
 

9891
03:09:47,840 --> 03:09:50,309
and you can see properties like SP with
that kind of extended object that um

9892
03:09:50,309 --> 03:09:50,319
that kind of extended object that um
 

9893
03:09:50,319 --> 03:09:51,870
that kind of extended object that um
yeah it would be very cool if there's it

9894
03:09:51,870 --> 03:09:51,880
yeah it would be very cool if there's it
 

9895
03:09:51,880 --> 03:09:53,309
yeah it would be very cool if there's it

03:09:53,309 --> 03:09:53,319
somehow connects to direcor versus
 

9897
03:09:53,319 --> 03:09:54,429

9898
03:09:54,429 --> 03:09:54,439
undirected I think that's what it's
 

9899
03:09:54,439 --> 03:09:55,630
undirected I think that's what it's
going to be I think it's going to be as

03:09:55,630 --> 03:09:55,640
going to be I think it's going to be as
 

9901
03:09:55,640 --> 03:09:57,790
going to be I think it's going to be as
simple as that but we'll see I mean this

9902
03:09:57,790 --> 03:09:57,800
simple as that but we'll see I mean this
 

9903
03:09:57,800 --> 03:09:59,630
simple as that but we'll see I mean this
is this is the thing that that you know

03:09:59,630 --> 03:09:59,640
is this is the thing that that you know
 

9905
03:09:59,640 --> 03:10:01,990
is this is the thing that that you know
this is the big sort of bizarre surprise

9906
03:10:01,990 --> 03:10:02,000
this is the big sort of bizarre surprise
 

9907
03:10:02,000 --> 03:10:04,710
this is the big sort of bizarre surprise
is that you know because you know I I I

03:10:04,710 --> 03:10:04,720
is that you know because you know I I I
 

9909

03:10:10,680 --> 03:10:12,229
sense that you know if you go back to
the 1920s and so on there were the

9916
03:10:12,229 --> 03:10:12,239
the 1920s and so on there were the
 

9917
03:10:12,239 --> 03:10:13,990
the 1920s and so on there were the
people who were originating quantum

9918
03:10:13,990 --> 03:10:14,000
people who were originating quantum
 

9919
03:10:14,000 --> 03:10:15,870
people who were originating quantum
mechanics and so on maybe it's a little

9920
03:10:15,870 --> 03:10:15,880
mechanics and so on maybe it's a little
 

9921
03:10:15,880 --> 03:10:18,550
mechanics and so on maybe it's a little
less than that maybe I was like a a a

9922
03:10:18,550 --> 03:10:18,560
less than that maybe I was like a a a
 

9923
03:10:18,560 --> 03:10:19,950
less than that maybe I was like a a a
third generation or something I don't

9924
03:10:19,950 --> 03:10:19,960
third generation or something I don't
 

9925
03:10:19,960 --> 03:10:21,750
third generation or something I don't
know but but you know the people from

9926
03:10:21,750 --> 03:10:21,760
know but but you know the people from
 

9927
03:10:21,760 --> 03:10:24,269
know but but you know the people from
whom I learned physics were the people

9928
03:10:24,269 --> 03:10:24,279
whom I learned physics were the people
 

9929
03:10:24,279 --> 03:10:25,990
whom I learned physics were the people
who were you know have been students of

9930
03:10:25,990 --> 03:10:26,000
who were you know have been students of
 

9931
03:10:26,000 --> 03:10:28,070
who were you know have been students of
the students of the the people who

9932
03:10:28,070 --> 03:10:28,080
the students of the the people who
 

9933
03:10:28,080 --> 03:10:30,070
the students of the the people who
originated the the current understanding

9934
03:10:30,070 --> 03:10:30,080
originated the the current understanding
 

9935
03:10:30,080 --> 03:10:32,429
originated the the current understanding
of physics and we're now at you know

9936
03:10:32,429 --> 03:10:32,439
of physics and we're now at you know
 

9937
03:10:32,439 --> 03:10:33,950
of physics and we're now at you know
probably the seventh generation of

9938
03:10:33,950 --> 03:10:33,960
probably the seventh generation of
 

9939
03:10:33,960 --> 03:10:35,870
probably the seventh generation of
physicists or something from the from

9940
03:10:35,870 --> 03:10:35,880
physicists or something from the from
 

9941
03:10:35,880 --> 03:10:38,389
physicists or something from the from
the early days of 20th century physics

9942
03:10:38,389 --> 03:10:38,399
the early days of 20th century physics
 

9943
03:10:38,399 --> 03:10:41,030
the early days of 20th century physics
and you know whenever a field gets that

9944
03:10:41,030 --> 03:10:41,040
and you know whenever a field gets that
 

9945
03:10:41,040 --> 03:10:44,190
and you know whenever a field gets that
many generations deep it seems the

9946
03:10:44,190 --> 03:10:44,200
many generations deep it seems the
 

9947
03:10:44,200 --> 03:10:46,750
many generations deep it seems the
foundations seem quite inaccessible and

9948
03:10:46,750 --> 03:10:46,760
foundations seem quite inaccessible and
 

9949
03:10:46,760 --> 03:10:48,309
foundations seem quite inaccessible and
they seem you know it seems like you

9950
03:10:48,309 --> 03:10:48,319
they seem you know it seems like you
 

9951
03:10:48,319 --> 03:10:49,990
they seem you know it seems like you
can't possibly understand that we've

9952
03:10:49,990 --> 03:10:50,000
can't possibly understand that we've
 

9953
03:10:50,000 --> 03:10:51,910
can't possibly understand that we've
gone through you know seven academic

9954
03:10:51,910 --> 03:10:51,920
gone through you know seven academic
 

9955
03:10:51,920 --> 03:10:54,389
gone through you know seven academic
generations and that's been you know

9956
03:10:54,389 --> 03:10:54,399
generations and that's been you know
 

9957
03:10:54,399 --> 03:10:56,030
generations and that's been you know
that's been this thing that's been

9958
03:10:56,030 --> 03:10:56,040
that's been this thing that's been
 

9959
03:10:56,040 --> 03:10:57,830
that's been this thing that's been
difficult to understand for for that

9960
03:10:57,830 --> 03:10:57,840
difficult to understand for for that
 

9961
03:10:57,840 --> 03:11:01,389
difficult to understand for for that
long it just can't be that simple um and

9962
03:11:01,389 --> 03:11:01,399
long it just can't be that simple um and
 

9963
03:11:01,399 --> 03:11:03,590
long it just can't be that simple um and
well in a sense maybe that Journey takes

9964
03:11:03,590 --> 03:11:03,600
well in a sense maybe that Journey takes
 

9965
03:11:03,600 --> 03:11:06,389
well in a sense maybe that Journey takes
you to a to a simple explanation that

9966
03:11:06,389 --> 03:11:06,399
you to a to a simple explanation that
 

9967
03:11:06,399 --> 03:11:08,229
you to a to a simple explanation that
was there all along as the whole right

9968
03:11:08,229 --> 03:11:08,239
was there all along as the whole right
 

9969
03:11:08,239 --> 03:11:09,150
was there all along as the whole right
right right I mean you know and the

9970
03:11:09,150 --> 03:11:09,160
right right I mean you know and the
 

9971
03:11:09,160 --> 03:11:11,070
right right I mean you know and the
thing for me personally the thing that's

9972
03:11:11,070 --> 03:11:11,080
thing for me personally the thing that's
 

9973
03:11:11,080 --> 03:11:13,229
thing for me personally the thing that's
been quite interesting is you know I

9974
03:11:13,229 --> 03:11:13,239
been quite interesting is you know I
 

9975
03:11:13,239 --> 03:11:15,309
been quite interesting is you know I
didn't expect this project to work in

9976
03:11:15,309 --> 03:11:15,319
didn't expect this project to work in
 

9977
03:11:15,319 --> 03:11:18,030
didn't expect this project to work in
this way and I you know but I had this

9978
03:11:18,030 --> 03:11:18,040
this way and I you know but I had this
 

9979
03:11:18,040 --> 03:11:19,950
this way and I you know but I had this
sort of weird piece of personal history

9980
03:11:19,950 --> 03:11:19,960
sort of weird piece of personal history
 

9981
03:11:19,960 --> 03:11:22,110
sort of weird piece of personal history
that I used to be a physicist and I used

9982
03:11:22,110 --> 03:11:22,120
that I used to be a physicist and I used
 

9983
03:11:22,120 --> 03:11:24,150
that I used to be a physicist and I used
to do all this stuff and I know you know

9984
03:11:24,150 --> 03:11:24,160
to do all this stuff and I know you know
 

9985
03:11:24,160 --> 03:11:27,150
to do all this stuff and I know you know
the the standard Canon of physics I knew

9986
03:11:27,150 --> 03:11:27,160
the the standard Canon of physics I knew
 

9987
03:11:27,160 --> 03:11:30,429
the the standard Canon of physics I knew
it very well and um you know but then

9988
03:11:30,429 --> 03:11:30,439
it very well and um you know but then
 

9989
03:11:30,439 --> 03:11:31,790
it very well and um you know but then
I've been working on this kind of

9990
03:11:31,790 --> 03:11:31,800
I've been working on this kind of
 

9991
03:11:31,800 --> 03:11:34,190
I've been working on this kind of
computational Paradigm for basically 40

9992
03:11:34,190 --> 03:11:34,200
computational Paradigm for basically 40
 

9993
03:11:34,200 --> 03:11:37,510
computational Paradigm for basically 40
years and uh the fact that you know I'm

9994
03:11:37,510 --> 03:11:37,520
years and uh the fact that you know I'm
 

9995
03:11:37,520 --> 03:11:40,550
years and uh the fact that you know I'm
sort of now coming back to to you know

9996
03:11:40,550 --> 03:11:40,560
sort of now coming back to to you know
 

9997
03:11:40,560 --> 03:11:42,510
sort of now coming back to to you know
trying to apply that in physics it kind

9998
03:11:42,510 --> 03:11:42,520
trying to apply that in physics it kind
 

9999
03:11:42,520 --> 03:11:45,150
trying to apply that in physics it kind
of felt like that Journey was necessary

10000
03:11:45,150 --> 03:11:45,160
of felt like that Journey was necessary
 

10001
03:11:45,160 --> 03:11:47,030
of felt like that Journey was necessary
was this uh when did you first try to

10002
03:11:47,030 --> 03:11:47,040
was this uh when did you first try to
 

10003
03:11:47,040 --> 03:11:48,070
was this uh when did you first try to
play play with a

10004
03:11:48,070 --> 03:11:48,080
play play with a
 

10005
03:11:48,080 --> 03:11:51,229
play play with a
hypergraph so I what happen yeah so so

10006
03:11:51,229 --> 03:11:51,239
hypergraph so I what happen yeah so so
 

10007
03:11:51,239 --> 03:11:53,389
hypergraph so I what happen yeah so so
what I had was okay so this is again you

10008
03:11:53,389 --> 03:11:53,399
what I had was okay so this is again you
 

10009
03:11:53,399 --> 03:11:55,710
what I had was okay so this is again you
know one one always feels dumb after the

10010
03:11:55,710 --> 03:11:55,720
know one one always feels dumb after the
 

10011
03:11:55,720 --> 03:11:58,150
know one one always feels dumb after the
fact it's it's um it's obvious after the

10012
03:11:58,150 --> 03:11:58,160
fact it's it's um it's obvious after the
 

10013
03:11:58,160 --> 03:12:02,269
fact it's it's um it's obvious after the
fact but but so back in the early 1990s

10014
03:12:02,269 --> 03:12:02,279
fact but but so back in the early 1990s
 

10015
03:12:02,279 --> 03:12:05,630
fact but but so back in the early 1990s
I realized that using graphs as a sort

10016
03:12:05,630 --> 03:12:05,640
I realized that using graphs as a sort
 

10017
03:12:05,640 --> 03:12:07,469
I realized that using graphs as a sort
of underlying thing underneath space and

10018
03:12:07,469 --> 03:12:07,479
of underlying thing underneath space and
 

10019
03:12:07,479 --> 03:12:09,030
of underlying thing underneath space and
time was going to be a useful thing to

10020
03:12:09,030 --> 03:12:09,040
time was going to be a useful thing to
 

10021
03:12:09,040 --> 03:12:12,269
time was going to be a useful thing to
do I figured out about multi-way systems

10022
03:12:12,269 --> 03:12:12,279
do I figured out about multi-way systems
 

10023
03:12:12,279 --> 03:12:14,190
do I figured out about multi-way systems
um I figured out the things about

10024
03:12:14,190 --> 03:12:14,200
um I figured out the things about
 

10025
03:12:14,200 --> 03:12:15,710
um I figured out the things about
general relativity I figured out by the

10026
03:12:15,710 --> 03:12:15,720
general relativity I figured out by the
 

10027
03:12:15,720 --> 03:12:18,590
general relativity I figured out by the
end of the 1990s but I always felt there

10028
03:12:18,590 --> 03:12:18,600
end of the 1990s but I always felt there
 

10029
03:12:18,600 --> 03:12:20,389
end of the 1990s but I always felt there
was a certain inelegance because I was

10030
03:12:20,389 --> 03:12:20,399
was a certain inelegance because I was
 

10031
03:12:20,399 --> 03:12:22,110
was a certain inelegance because I was
using these graphs and there were

10032
03:12:22,110 --> 03:12:22,120
using these graphs and there were
 

10033
03:12:22,120 --> 03:12:23,990
using these graphs and there were
certain constraints on these graphs that

10034
03:12:23,990 --> 03:12:24,000
certain constraints on these graphs that
 

10035
03:12:24,000 --> 03:12:25,630
certain constraints on these graphs that
seemed like they were they were kind of

10036
03:12:25,630 --> 03:12:25,640
seemed like they were they were kind of
 

10037
03:12:25,640 --> 03:12:28,269
seemed like they were they were kind of
awkward it was kind of like you can pick

10038
03:12:28,269 --> 03:12:28,279
awkward it was kind of like you can pick
 

10039
03:12:28,279 --> 03:12:30,150
awkward it was kind of like you can pick
it's like you couldn't pick any rule it

10040
03:12:30,150 --> 03:12:30,160
it's like you couldn't pick any rule it
 

10041
03:12:30,160 --> 03:12:32,070
it's like you couldn't pick any rule it
was like pick any number but the number

10042
03:12:32,070 --> 03:12:32,080
was like pick any number but the number
 

10043
03:12:32,080 --> 03:12:34,030
was like pick any number but the number
has to be prime was kind of like you

10044
03:12:34,030 --> 03:12:34,040
has to be prime was kind of like you
 

10045
03:12:34,040 --> 03:12:35,710
has to be prime was kind of like you
couldn't it was a kind of an awkward

10046
03:12:35,710 --> 03:12:35,720
couldn't it was a kind of an awkward
 

10047
03:12:35,720 --> 03:12:38,030
couldn't it was a kind of an awkward
special constraint I had these trivalent

10048
03:12:38,030 --> 03:12:38,040
special constraint I had these trivalent
 

10049
03:12:38,040 --> 03:12:39,870
special constraint I had these trivalent
graphs graphs with just three

10050
03:12:39,870 --> 03:12:39,880
graphs graphs with just three
 

10051
03:12:39,880 --> 03:12:42,590
graphs graphs with just three
connections from every node okay so but

10052
03:12:42,590 --> 03:12:42,600
connections from every node okay so but
 

10053
03:12:42,600 --> 03:12:43,990
connections from every node okay so but
but I discovered a bunch of stuff with

10054
03:12:43,990 --> 03:12:44,000
but I discovered a bunch of stuff with
 

10055
03:12:44,000 --> 03:12:45,309
but I discovered a bunch of stuff with
that but I thought it was kind of

10056
03:12:45,309 --> 03:12:45,319
that but I thought it was kind of
 

10057
03:12:45,319 --> 03:12:47,550
that but I thought it was kind of
inelegant and you know the other piece

10058
03:12:47,550 --> 03:12:47,560
inelegant and you know the other piece
 

10059
03:12:47,560 --> 03:12:49,070
inelegant and you know the other piece
of sort of personal history is obviously

10060
03:12:49,070 --> 03:12:49,080
of sort of personal history is obviously
 

10061
03:12:49,080 --> 03:12:51,150
of sort of personal history is obviously
I spent my life as a language

10062
03:12:51,150 --> 03:12:51,160
I spent my life as a language
 

10063
03:12:51,160 --> 03:12:53,269
I spent my life as a language
computational language designer and so

10064
03:12:53,269 --> 03:12:53,279
computational language designer and so
 

10065
03:12:53,279 --> 03:12:54,750
computational language designer and so
the story of computational language

10066
03:12:54,750 --> 03:12:54,760
the story of computational language
 

10067
03:12:54,760 --> 03:12:57,070
the story of computational language
design is a story of how do you take all

10068
03:12:57,070 --> 03:12:57,080
design is a story of how do you take all
 

10069
03:12:57,080 --> 03:12:59,110
design is a story of how do you take all
these random ideas in the world and kind

10070
03:12:59,110 --> 03:12:59,120
these random ideas in the world and kind
 

10071
03:12:59,120 --> 03:13:01,429
these random ideas in the world and kind
of grind them down into something that

10072
03:13:01,429 --> 03:13:01,439
of grind them down into something that
 

10073
03:13:01,439 --> 03:13:04,750
of grind them down into something that
is computationally as simple as possible

10074
03:13:04,750 --> 03:13:04,760
is computationally as simple as possible
 

10075
03:13:04,760 --> 03:13:06,110
is computationally as simple as possible
and so you know I've been very

10076
03:13:06,110 --> 03:13:06,120
and so you know I've been very
 

10077
03:13:06,120 --> 03:13:07,910
and so you know I've been very
interested in kind of simple

10078
03:13:07,910 --> 03:13:07,920
interested in kind of simple
 

10079
03:13:07,920 --> 03:13:09,630
interested in kind of simple
computational Frameworks for

10080
03:13:09,630 --> 03:13:09,640
computational Frameworks for
 

10081
03:13:09,640 --> 03:13:12,590
computational Frameworks for
representing things and have you know

10082
03:13:12,590 --> 03:13:12,600
representing things and have you know
 

10083
03:13:12,600 --> 03:13:15,070
representing things and have you know
ridiculous amounts of experience in in

10084
03:13:15,070 --> 03:13:15,080
ridiculous amounts of experience in in
 

10085
03:13:15,080 --> 03:13:16,630
ridiculous amounts of experience in in
trying to do that and actually all of

10086
03:13:16,630 --> 03:13:16,640
trying to do that and actually all of
 

10087
03:13:16,640 --> 03:13:18,510
trying to do that and actually all of
those trajectories of your life kind of

10088
03:13:18,510 --> 03:13:18,520
those trajectories of your life kind of
 

10089
03:13:18,520 --> 03:13:20,830
those trajectories of your life kind of
came together so you make it sound like

10090
03:13:20,830 --> 03:13:20,840
came together so you make it sound like
 

10091
03:13:20,840 --> 03:13:22,389
came together so you make it sound like
you could have come up with uh

10092
03:13:22,389 --> 03:13:22,399
you could have come up with uh
 

10093
03:13:22,399 --> 03:13:24,309
you could have come up with uh
everything you're working on now decades

10094
03:13:24,309 --> 03:13:24,319
everything you're working on now decades
 

10095
03:13:24,319 --> 03:13:27,030
everything you're working on now decades
ago but in reality look two things

10096
03:13:27,030 --> 03:13:27,040
ago but in reality look two things
 

10097
03:13:27,040 --> 03:13:28,790
ago but in reality look two things
slowed me down I mean one thing that

10098
03:13:28,790 --> 03:13:28,800
slowed me down I mean one thing that
 

10099
03:13:28,800 --> 03:13:31,110
slowed me down I mean one thing that
slowed me down was I couldn't figure out

10100
03:13:31,110 --> 03:13:31,120
slowed me down was I couldn't figure out
 

10101
03:13:31,120 --> 03:13:33,590
slowed me down was I couldn't figure out
how to make it elegant and and that

10102
03:13:33,590 --> 03:13:33,600
how to make it elegant and and that
 

10103
03:13:33,600 --> 03:13:35,389
how to make it elegant and and that
turns out hypergraphs were the key to

10104
03:13:35,389 --> 03:13:35,399
turns out hypergraphs were the key to
 

10105
03:13:35,399 --> 03:13:37,670
turns out hypergraphs were the key to
that and that I figured out but about

10106
03:13:37,670 --> 03:13:37,680
that and that I figured out but about
 

10107
03:13:37,680 --> 03:13:41,630
that and that I figured out but about
less than two years ago now um and um

10108
03:13:41,630 --> 03:13:41,640
less than two years ago now um and um
 

10109
03:13:41,640 --> 03:13:43,990
less than two years ago now um and um
the other I mean I I think so that was

10110
03:13:43,990 --> 03:13:44,000
the other I mean I I think so that was
 

10111
03:13:44,000 --> 03:13:46,630
the other I mean I I think so that was
that was sort of a a key thing well okay

10112
03:13:46,630 --> 03:13:46,640
that was sort of a a key thing well okay
 

10113
03:13:46,640 --> 03:13:48,190
that was sort of a a key thing well okay
so the real embarrassment of this

10114
03:13:48,190 --> 03:13:48,200
so the real embarrassment of this
 

10115
03:13:48,200 --> 03:13:51,469
so the real embarrassment of this
project okay is that the final structure

10116
03:13:51,469 --> 03:13:51,479
project okay is that the final structure
 

10117
03:13:51,479 --> 03:13:54,469
project okay is that the final structure
that we have that is the foundation for

10118
03:13:54,469 --> 03:13:54,479
that we have that is the foundation for
 

10119
03:13:54,479 --> 03:13:58,910
that we have that is the foundation for
this project is basically a a kind of an

10120
03:13:58,910 --> 03:13:58,920
this project is basically a a kind of an
 

10121
03:13:58,920 --> 03:14:01,550
this project is basically a a kind of an
idealized version a formalized version

10122
03:14:01,550 --> 03:14:01,560
idealized version a formalized version
 

10123
03:14:01,560 --> 03:14:03,830
idealized version a formalized version
of the exact same structure that I've

10124
03:14:03,830 --> 03:14:03,840
of the exact same structure that I've
 

10125
03:14:03,840 --> 03:14:05,550
of the exact same structure that I've
used to build computational languages

10126
03:14:05,550 --> 03:14:05,560
used to build computational languages
 

10127
03:14:05,560 --> 03:14:07,590
used to build computational languages
for more than 40 years yeah but it took

10128
03:14:07,590 --> 03:14:07,600
for more than 40 years yeah but it took
 

10129
03:14:07,600 --> 03:14:10,309
for more than 40 years yeah but it took
me but I didn't realize that and and you

10130
03:14:10,309 --> 03:14:10,319
me but I didn't realize that and and you
 

10131
03:14:10,319 --> 03:14:13,070
me but I didn't realize that and and you
know and there yet may be other so we're

10132
03:14:13,070 --> 03:14:13,080
know and there yet may be other so we're
 

10133
03:14:13,080 --> 03:14:16,070
know and there yet may be other so we're
focused on physics now but I mean that's

10134
03:14:16,070 --> 03:14:16,080
focused on physics now but I mean that's
 

10135
03:14:16,080 --> 03:14:17,750
focused on physics now but I mean that's
what the new kind of science is about

10136
03:14:17,750 --> 03:14:17,760
what the new kind of science is about
 

10137
03:14:17,760 --> 03:14:20,150
what the new kind of science is about
same kind of stuff and this in terms of

10138
03:14:20,150 --> 03:14:20,160
same kind of stuff and this in terms of
 

10139
03:14:20,160 --> 03:14:23,190
same kind of stuff and this in terms of
mathematically um the beauty of it so so

10140
03:14:23,190 --> 03:14:23,200
mathematically um the beauty of it so so
 

10141
03:14:23,200 --> 03:14:25,110
mathematically um the beauty of it so so
there could be entire other kind of

10142
03:14:25,110 --> 03:14:25,120
there could be entire other kind of
 

10143
03:14:25,120 --> 03:14:28,070
there could be entire other kind of
objects they're useful for like we we're

10144
03:14:28,070 --> 03:14:28,080
objects they're useful for like we we're
 

10145
03:14:28,080 --> 03:14:30,030
objects they're useful for like we we're
not talking about you know machine

10146
03:14:30,030 --> 03:14:30,040
not talking about you know machine
 

10147
03:14:30,040 --> 03:14:32,750
not talking about you know machine
learning for example maybe there's other

10148
03:14:32,750 --> 03:14:32,760
learning for example maybe there's other
 

10149
03:14:32,760 --> 03:14:34,070
learning for example maybe there's other
variants of the hypog graph that are

10150
03:14:34,070 --> 03:14:34,080
variants of the hypog graph that are
 

10151
03:14:34,080 --> 03:14:36,150
variants of the hypog graph that are
very useful for reasoning well we'll see

10152
03:14:36,150 --> 03:14:36,160
very useful for reasoning well we'll see
 

10153
03:14:36,160 --> 03:14:37,910
very useful for reasoning well we'll see
whether the multi-way graph for machine

10154
03:14:37,910 --> 03:14:37,920
whether the multi-way graph for machine
 

10155
03:14:37,920 --> 03:14:39,389
whether the multi-way graph for machine
Learning System is

10156
03:14:39,389 --> 03:14:39,399
Learning System is
 

10157
03:14:39,399 --> 03:14:42,269
Learning System is
interesting okay let's leave it at that

10158
03:14:42,269 --> 03:14:42,279
interesting okay let's leave it at that
 

10159
03:14:42,279 --> 03:14:44,030
interesting okay let's leave it at that
that's conversation number three that's

10160
03:14:44,030 --> 03:14:44,040
that's conversation number three that's
 

10161
03:14:44,040 --> 03:14:45,550
that's conversation number three that's
that's that's we're not going to go

10162
03:14:45,550 --> 03:14:45,560
that's that's we're not going to go
 

10163
03:14:45,560 --> 03:14:47,990
that's that's we're not going to go
there right now but so one of the things

10164
03:14:47,990 --> 03:14:48,000
there right now but so one of the things
 

10165
03:14:48,000 --> 03:14:51,950
there right now but so one of the things
you've mentioned is um the space of all

10166
03:14:51,950 --> 03:14:51,960
you've mentioned is um the space of all
 

10167
03:14:51,960 --> 03:14:53,910
you've mentioned is um the space of all
possible rules that we kind of discussed

10168
03:14:53,910 --> 03:14:53,920
possible rules that we kind of discussed
 

10169
03:14:53,920 --> 03:14:57,110
possible rules that we kind of discussed
a little bit uh that you know there

10170
03:14:57,110 --> 03:14:57,120
a little bit uh that you know there
 

10171
03:14:57,120 --> 03:14:58,790
a little bit uh that you know there
could be I guess the set of possible

10172
03:14:58,790 --> 03:14:58,800
could be I guess the set of possible
 

10173
03:14:58,800 --> 03:14:59,950
could be I guess the set of possible
rules is

10174
03:14:59,950 --> 03:14:59,960
rules is
 

10175
03:14:59,960 --> 03:15:02,190
rules is
infinite right well so here's here's the

10176
03:15:02,190 --> 03:15:02,200
infinite right well so here's here's the
 

10177
03:15:02,200 --> 03:15:04,510
infinite right well so here's here's the
big sort of one of the conundrums that

10178
03:15:04,510 --> 03:15:04,520
big sort of one of the conundrums that
 

10179
03:15:04,520 --> 03:15:07,870
big sort of one of the conundrums that
that I'm kind of trying to deal with is

10180
03:15:07,870 --> 03:15:07,880
that I'm kind of trying to deal with is
 

10181
03:15:07,880 --> 03:15:10,229
that I'm kind of trying to deal with is
let's say we think we found the rule for

10182
03:15:10,229 --> 03:15:10,239
let's say we think we found the rule for
 

10183
03:15:10,239 --> 03:15:13,269
let's say we think we found the rule for
the universe and we say here it is you

10184
03:15:13,269 --> 03:15:13,279
the universe and we say here it is you
 

10185
03:15:13,279 --> 03:15:14,950
the universe and we say here it is you
know write it down it's a little tiny

10186
03:15:14,950 --> 03:15:14,960
know write it down it's a little tiny
 

10187
03:15:14,960 --> 03:15:17,630
know write it down it's a little tiny
thing and then we say gosh that's really

10188
03:15:17,630 --> 03:15:17,640
thing and then we say gosh that's really
 

10189
03:15:17,640 --> 03:15:19,630
thing and then we say gosh that's really
weird why did we get that

10190
03:15:19,630 --> 03:15:19,640
weird why did we get that
 

10191
03:15:19,640 --> 03:15:22,630
weird why did we get that
one right and then we're in this whole

10192
03:15:22,630 --> 03:15:22,640
one right and then we're in this whole
 

10193
03:15:22,640 --> 03:15:24,510
one right and then we're in this whole
situation because let's say it's fairly

10194
03:15:24,510 --> 03:15:24,520
situation because let's say it's fairly
 

10195
03:15:24,520 --> 03:15:27,630
situation because let's say it's fairly
simple how did we come up the winners

10196
03:15:27,630 --> 03:15:27,640
simple how did we come up the winners
 

10197
03:15:27,640 --> 03:15:29,030
simple how did we come up the winners
getting one of the simple possible

10198
03:15:29,030 --> 03:15:29,040
getting one of the simple possible
 

10199
03:15:29,040 --> 03:15:31,389
getting one of the simple possible
Universe rules why didn't we get what

10200
03:15:31,389 --> 03:15:31,399
Universe rules why didn't we get what
 

10201
03:15:31,399 --> 03:15:33,750
Universe rules why didn't we get what
some incredibly complicated rule why do

10202
03:15:33,750 --> 03:15:33,760
some incredibly complicated rule why do
 

10203
03:15:33,760 --> 03:15:35,429
some incredibly complicated rule why do
we get one of the simpler ones and and

10204
03:15:35,429 --> 03:15:35,439
we get one of the simpler ones and and
 

10205
03:15:35,439 --> 03:15:36,710
we get one of the simpler ones and and
that's a thing which you know in the

10206
03:15:36,710 --> 03:15:36,720
that's a thing which you know in the
 

10207
03:15:36,720 --> 03:15:39,070
that's a thing which you know in the
history of science you know the whole

10208
03:15:39,070 --> 03:15:39,080
history of science you know the whole
 

10209
03:15:39,080 --> 03:15:42,550
history of science you know the whole
sort of story of kernus and so on was

10210
03:15:42,550 --> 03:15:42,560
sort of story of kernus and so on was
 

10211
03:15:42,560 --> 03:15:43,950
sort of story of kernus and so on was
you know we used to think the Earth was

10212
03:15:43,950 --> 03:15:43,960
you know we used to think the Earth was
 

10213
03:15:43,960 --> 03:15:45,349
you know we used to think the Earth was
the center of the universe but now we

10214
03:15:45,349 --> 03:15:45,359
the center of the universe but now we
 

10215
03:15:45,359 --> 03:15:46,710
the center of the universe but now we
find out it's not and we're actually

10216
03:15:46,710 --> 03:15:46,720
find out it's not and we're actually
 

10217
03:15:46,720 --> 03:15:48,830
find out it's not and we're actually
just and some you know random corner of

10218
03:15:48,830 --> 03:15:48,840
just and some you know random corner of
 

10219
03:15:48,840 --> 03:15:51,070
just and some you know random corner of
some random Galaxy out in this big

10220
03:15:51,070 --> 03:15:51,080
some random Galaxy out in this big
 

10221
03:15:51,080 --> 03:15:52,870
some random Galaxy out in this big
universe there's nothing special about

10222
03:15:52,870 --> 03:15:52,880
universe there's nothing special about
 

10223
03:15:52,880 --> 03:15:57,150
universe there's nothing special about
us so if we get you know Universe number

10224
03:15:57,150 --> 03:15:57,160
us so if we get you know Universe number
 

10225
03:15:57,160 --> 03:15:59,389
us so if we get you know Universe number
3177 out of all the infinite number of

10226
03:15:59,389 --> 03:15:59,399
3177 out of all the infinite number of
 

10227
03:15:59,399 --> 03:16:01,269
3177 out of all the infinite number of
possibilities how do we get something

10228
03:16:01,269 --> 03:16:01,279
possibilities how do we get something
 

10229
03:16:01,279 --> 03:16:03,229
possibilities how do we get something
that small and simple right so I was

10230
03:16:03,229 --> 03:16:03,239
that small and simple right so I was
 

10231
03:16:03,239 --> 03:16:05,469
that small and simple right so I was
very confused by this and it's like what

10232
03:16:05,469 --> 03:16:05,479
very confused by this and it's like what
 

10233
03:16:05,479 --> 03:16:06,950
very confused by this and it's like what
are we going to say about this how are

10234
03:16:06,950 --> 03:16:06,960
are we going to say about this how are
 

10235
03:16:06,960 --> 03:16:08,950
are we going to say about this how are
we going to explain this and I thought

10236
03:16:08,950 --> 03:16:08,960
we going to explain this and I thought
 

10237
03:16:08,960 --> 03:16:10,309
we going to explain this and I thought
it was might be one of these things

10238
03:16:10,309 --> 03:16:10,319
it was might be one of these things
 

10239
03:16:10,319 --> 03:16:11,830
it was might be one of these things
where you just you know you can get it

10240
03:16:11,830 --> 03:16:11,840
where you just you know you can get it
 

10241
03:16:11,840 --> 03:16:14,229
where you just you know you can get it
to the threshold and then you find out

10242
03:16:14,229 --> 03:16:14,239
to the threshold and then you find out
 

10243
03:16:14,239 --> 03:16:15,590
to the threshold and then you find out
its rule number such and such and you

10244
03:16:15,590 --> 03:16:15,600
its rule number such and such and you
 

10245
03:16:15,600 --> 03:16:17,429
its rule number such and such and you
just have no idea why it's like that

10246
03:16:17,429 --> 03:16:17,439
just have no idea why it's like that
 

10247
03:16:17,439 --> 03:16:20,189
just have no idea why it's like that
yeah okay so then I realized it's

10248
03:16:20,189 --> 03:16:20,199
yeah okay so then I realized it's
 

10249
03:16:20,199 --> 03:16:23,110
yeah okay so then I realized it's
actually more bizarre than that okay so

10250
03:16:23,110 --> 03:16:23,120
actually more bizarre than that okay so
 

10251
03:16:23,120 --> 03:16:25,110
actually more bizarre than that okay so
we talked about multi-way graphs we

10252
03:16:25,110 --> 03:16:25,120
we talked about multi-way graphs we
 

10253
03:16:25,120 --> 03:16:27,150
we talked about multi-way graphs we
talked about this idea that you take

10254
03:16:27,150 --> 03:16:27,160
talked about this idea that you take
 

10255
03:16:27,160 --> 03:16:29,070
talked about this idea that you take
these underlying transformation rules on

10256
03:16:29,070 --> 03:16:29,080
these underlying transformation rules on
 

10257
03:16:29,080 --> 03:16:31,870
these underlying transformation rules on
these hypergraphs and you apply them

10258
03:16:31,870 --> 03:16:31,880
these hypergraphs and you apply them
 

10259
03:16:31,880 --> 03:16:34,670
these hypergraphs and you apply them
wherever the rule can apply you apply it

10260
03:16:34,670 --> 03:16:34,680
wherever the rule can apply you apply it
 

10261
03:16:34,680 --> 03:16:36,030
wherever the rule can apply you apply it
and that makes this whole multi-way

10262
03:16:36,030 --> 03:16:36,040
and that makes this whole multi-way
 

10263
03:16:36,040 --> 03:16:38,469
and that makes this whole multi-way
graph of possibilities okay so let's go

10264
03:16:38,469 --> 03:16:38,479
graph of possibilities okay so let's go
 

10265
03:16:38,479 --> 03:16:41,830
graph of possibilities okay so let's go
a little bit weirder let's say that at

10266
03:16:41,830 --> 03:16:41,840
a little bit weirder let's say that at
 

10267
03:16:41,840 --> 03:16:43,950
a little bit weirder let's say that at
every place not only do you apply a

10268
03:16:43,950 --> 03:16:43,960
every place not only do you apply a
 

10269
03:16:43,960 --> 03:16:46,110
every place not only do you apply a
particular rule in all possible ways it

10270
03:16:46,110 --> 03:16:46,120
particular rule in all possible ways it
 

10271
03:16:46,120 --> 03:16:48,670
particular rule in all possible ways it
can apply but you apply all possible

10272
03:16:48,670 --> 03:16:48,680
can apply but you apply all possible
 

10273
03:16:48,680 --> 03:16:50,830
can apply but you apply all possible
rules in all possible ways they can

10274
03:16:50,830 --> 03:16:50,840
rules in all possible ways they can
 

10275
03:16:50,840 --> 03:16:53,750
rules in all possible ways they can
apply okay so you say that's just crazy

10276
03:16:53,750 --> 03:16:53,760
apply okay so you say that's just crazy
 

10277
03:16:53,760 --> 03:16:55,110
apply okay so you say that's just crazy
that's way too complicated you're never

10278
03:16:55,110 --> 03:16:55,120
that's way too complicated you're never
 

10279
03:16:55,120 --> 03:16:57,389
that's way too complicated you're never
going to be able to conclude anything

10280
03:16:57,389 --> 03:16:57,399
going to be able to conclude anything
 

10281
03:16:57,399 --> 03:17:00,990
going to be able to conclude anything
okay however turns out oh that don't

10282
03:17:00,990 --> 03:17:01,000
okay however turns out oh that don't
 

10283
03:17:01,000 --> 03:17:03,070
okay however turns out oh that don't
tell me there's some kind of invariance

10284
03:17:03,070 --> 03:17:03,080
tell me there's some kind of invariance
 

10285
03:17:03,080 --> 03:17:06,710
tell me there's some kind of invariance
yeah yeah so so what happens is man that

10286
03:17:06,710 --> 03:17:06,720
yeah yeah so so what happens is man that
 

10287
03:17:06,720 --> 03:17:10,670
yeah yeah so so what happens is man that
would be amazing right so so this thing

10288
03:17:10,670 --> 03:17:10,680
would be amazing right so so this thing
 

10289
03:17:10,680 --> 03:17:12,469
would be amazing right so so this thing
that you get this this kind of Ral

10290
03:17:12,469 --> 03:17:12,479
that you get this this kind of Ral
 

10291
03:17:12,479 --> 03:17:14,389
that you get this this kind of Ral
multi-way graph this multi-way graph

10292
03:17:14,389 --> 03:17:14,399
multi-way graph this multi-way graph
 

10293
03:17:14,399 --> 03:17:16,229
multi-way graph this multi-way graph
that is a branching of rules as well as

10294
03:17:16,229 --> 03:17:16,239
that is a branching of rules as well as
 

10295
03:17:16,239 --> 03:17:17,349
that is a branching of rules as well as
a branching

10296
03:17:17,349 --> 03:17:17,359
a branching
 

10297
03:17:17,359 --> 03:17:20,150
a branching
of possible applications of rules this

10298
03:17:20,150 --> 03:17:20,160
of possible applications of rules this
 

10299
03:17:20,160 --> 03:17:22,550
of possible applications of rules this
thing has causal invariance it's a it's

10300
03:17:22,550 --> 03:17:22,560
thing has causal invariance it's a it's
 

10301
03:17:22,560 --> 03:17:24,469
thing has causal invariance it's a it's
an inevitable feature that it shows

10302
03:17:24,469 --> 03:17:24,479
an inevitable feature that it shows
 

10303
03:17:24,479 --> 03:17:26,750
an inevitable feature that it shows
causal invariance and that means that

10304
03:17:26,750 --> 03:17:26,760
causal invariance and that means that
 

10305
03:17:26,760 --> 03:17:28,670
causal invariance and that means that
you can take different reference frames

10306
03:17:28,670 --> 03:17:28,680
you can take different reference frames
 

10307
03:17:28,680 --> 03:17:31,750
you can take different reference frames
different ways of slicing this thing and

10308
03:17:31,750 --> 03:17:31,760
different ways of slicing this thing and
 

10309
03:17:31,760 --> 03:17:33,469
different ways of slicing this thing and
they will all in some sense be

10310
03:17:33,469 --> 03:17:33,479
they will all in some sense be
 

10311
03:17:33,479 --> 03:17:35,150
they will all in some sense be
equivalent if you if you make the right

10312
03:17:35,150 --> 03:17:35,160
equivalent if you if you make the right
 

10313
03:17:35,160 --> 03:17:38,030
equivalent if you if you make the right
translation they will be equivalent so

10314
03:17:38,030 --> 03:17:38,040
translation they will be equivalent so
 

10315
03:17:38,040 --> 03:17:40,710
translation they will be equivalent so
okay so the the basic Point here is that

10316
03:17:40,710 --> 03:17:40,720
okay so the the basic Point here is that
 

10317
03:17:40,720 --> 03:17:43,229
okay so the the basic Point here is that
that's true that would be beautiful it

10318
03:17:43,229 --> 03:17:43,239
that's true that would be beautiful it
 

10319
03:17:43,239 --> 03:17:45,670
that's true that would be beautiful it
is true and it is beautiful so you you

10320
03:17:45,670 --> 03:17:45,680
is true and it is beautiful so you you
 

10321
03:17:45,680 --> 03:17:47,630
is true and it is beautiful so you you
it's not just an intuition there is some

10322
03:17:47,630 --> 03:17:47,640
it's not just an intuition there is some
 

10323
03:17:47,640 --> 03:17:49,990
it's not just an intuition there is some
no no no there's real mathematics behind

10324
03:17:49,990 --> 03:17:50,000
no no no there's real mathematics behind
 

10325
03:17:50,000 --> 03:17:53,910
no no no there's real mathematics behind
this and it and it's it is it is okay so

10326
03:17:53,910 --> 03:17:53,920
this and it and it's it is it is okay so
 

10327
03:17:53,920 --> 03:17:55,750
this and it and it's it is it is okay so
here's here's how it comes yeah that

10328
03:17:55,750 --> 03:17:55,760
here's here's how it comes yeah that
 

10329
03:17:55,760 --> 03:17:58,070
here's here's how it comes yeah that
that would be that's amazing right so so

10330
03:17:58,070 --> 03:17:58,080
that would be that's amazing right so so
 

10331
03:17:58,080 --> 03:17:59,670
that would be that's amazing right so so
by the way I mean the mathematics that's

10332
03:17:59,670 --> 03:17:59,680
by the way I mean the mathematics that's
 

10333
03:17:59,680 --> 03:18:01,349
by the way I mean the mathematics that's
connected to is the mathematics of

10334
03:18:01,349 --> 03:18:01,359
connected to is the mathematics of
 

10335
03:18:01,359 --> 03:18:03,750
connected to is the mathematics of
higher category Theory and groupoids and

10336
03:18:03,750 --> 03:18:03,760
higher category Theory and groupoids and
 

10337
03:18:03,760 --> 03:18:05,030
higher category Theory and groupoids and
things like this which I've always been

10338
03:18:05,030 --> 03:18:05,040
things like this which I've always been
 

10339
03:18:05,040 --> 03:18:08,670
things like this which I've always been
afraid of but now I'm I'm I'm finally

10340
03:18:08,670 --> 03:18:08,680
afraid of but now I'm I'm I'm finally
 

10341
03:18:08,680 --> 03:18:11,150
afraid of but now I'm I'm I'm finally
wrapping my arms around it but um um

10342
03:18:11,150 --> 03:18:11,160
wrapping my arms around it but um um
 

10343
03:18:11,160 --> 03:18:13,830
wrapping my arms around it but um um
it's also related to uh it also relates

10344
03:18:13,830 --> 03:18:13,840
it's also related to uh it also relates
 

10345
03:18:13,840 --> 03:18:16,189
it's also related to uh it also relates
to computational complexity Theory um

10346
03:18:16,189 --> 03:18:16,199
to computational complexity Theory um
 

10347
03:18:16,199 --> 03:18:18,389
to computational complexity Theory um
it's also deeply related to the P versus

10348
03:18:18,389 --> 03:18:18,399
it's also deeply related to the P versus
 

10349
03:18:18,399 --> 03:18:20,510
it's also deeply related to the P versus
NP problem and other things like this

10350
03:18:20,510 --> 03:18:20,520
NP problem and other things like this
 

10351
03:18:20,520 --> 03:18:22,030
NP problem and other things like this
again seems completely bizarre that

10352
03:18:22,030 --> 03:18:22,040
again seems completely bizarre that
 

10353
03:18:22,040 --> 03:18:23,349
again seems completely bizarre that
these things are connected but here's

10354
03:18:23,349 --> 03:18:23,359
these things are connected but here's
 

10355
03:18:23,359 --> 03:18:27,269
these things are connected but here's
why it's connected the this space of all

10356
03:18:27,269 --> 03:18:27,279
why it's connected the this space of all
 

10357
03:18:27,279 --> 03:18:30,590
why it's connected the this space of all
possible okay so a touring machine very

10358
03:18:30,590 --> 03:18:30,600
possible okay so a touring machine very
 

10359
03:18:30,600 --> 03:18:32,389
possible okay so a touring machine very
simple model of computation you know you

10360
03:18:32,389 --> 03:18:32,399
simple model of computation you know you
 

10361
03:18:32,399 --> 03:18:34,870
simple model of computation you know you
just got a this tape where you write

10362
03:18:34,870 --> 03:18:34,880
just got a this tape where you write
 

10363
03:18:34,880 --> 03:18:36,550
just got a this tape where you write
down you know ones and zeros or

10364
03:18:36,550 --> 03:18:36,560
down you know ones and zeros or
 

10365
03:18:36,560 --> 03:18:38,269
down you know ones and zeros or
something on the tape and you have this

10366
03:18:38,269 --> 03:18:38,279
something on the tape and you have this
 

10367
03:18:38,279 --> 03:18:40,750
something on the tape and you have this
this rule that says you know you you

10368
03:18:40,750 --> 03:18:40,760
this rule that says you know you you
 

10369
03:18:40,760 --> 03:18:42,349
this rule that says you know you you
change the number you move the head of

10370
03:18:42,349 --> 03:18:42,359
change the number you move the head of
 

10371
03:18:42,359 --> 03:18:44,830
change the number you move the head of
the on the tape Etc you have a definite

10372
03:18:44,830 --> 03:18:44,840
the on the tape Etc you have a definite
 

10373
03:18:44,840 --> 03:18:46,870
the on the tape Etc you have a definite
rule for doing that a deterministic

10374
03:18:46,870 --> 03:18:46,880
rule for doing that a deterministic
 

10375
03:18:46,880 --> 03:18:49,150
rule for doing that a deterministic
touring machine just does that

10376
03:18:49,150 --> 03:18:49,160
touring machine just does that
 

10377
03:18:49,160 --> 03:18:50,389
touring machine just does that
deterministically given the

10378
03:18:50,389 --> 03:18:50,399
deterministically given the
 

10379
03:18:50,399 --> 03:18:52,229
deterministically given the
configuration of the tape it will always

10380
03:18:52,229 --> 03:18:52,239
configuration of the tape it will always
 

10381
03:18:52,239 --> 03:18:54,550
configuration of the tape it will always
do the same thing a non-deterministic

10382
03:18:54,550 --> 03:18:54,560
do the same thing a non-deterministic
 

10383
03:18:54,560 --> 03:18:56,710
do the same thing a non-deterministic
touring machine can have different

10384
03:18:56,710 --> 03:18:56,720
touring machine can have different
 

10385
03:18:56,720 --> 03:18:59,070
touring machine can have different
choices that it makes at every step yeah

10386
03:18:59,070 --> 03:18:59,080
choices that it makes at every step yeah
 

10387
03:18:59,080 --> 03:19:01,830
choices that it makes at every step yeah
and so you know um you know this stuff

10388
03:19:01,830 --> 03:19:01,840
and so you know um you know this stuff
 

10389
03:19:01,840 --> 03:19:05,469
and so you know um you know this stuff
you probably teach this stuff the um it

10390
03:19:05,469 --> 03:19:05,479
you probably teach this stuff the um it
 

10391
03:19:05,479 --> 03:19:08,110
you probably teach this stuff the um it
um uh you know so a non-deterministic

10392
03:19:08,110 --> 03:19:08,120
um uh you know so a non-deterministic
 

10393
03:19:08,120 --> 03:19:10,710
um uh you know so a non-deterministic
touring machine has the set of branching

10394
03:19:10,710 --> 03:19:10,720
touring machine has the set of branching
 

10395
03:19:10,720 --> 03:19:12,670
touring machine has the set of branching
possibilities which is in fact one of

10396
03:19:12,670 --> 03:19:12,680
possibilities which is in fact one of
 

10397
03:19:12,680 --> 03:19:15,389
possibilities which is in fact one of
these multi-way graphs and in fact if

10398
03:19:15,389 --> 03:19:15,399
these multi-way graphs and in fact if
 

10399
03:19:15,399 --> 03:19:17,990
these multi-way graphs and in fact if
you say imagine the extremely

10400
03:19:17,990 --> 03:19:18,000
you say imagine the extremely
 

10401
03:19:18,000 --> 03:19:19,590
you say imagine the extremely
non-deterministic touring machine the

10402
03:19:19,590 --> 03:19:19,600
non-deterministic touring machine the
 

10403
03:19:19,600 --> 03:19:22,830
non-deterministic touring machine the
touring machine that can just do uh that

10404
03:19:22,830 --> 03:19:22,840
touring machine that can just do uh that
 

10405
03:19:22,840 --> 03:19:25,590
touring machine that can just do uh that
takes any possible rule at each step

10406
03:19:25,590 --> 03:19:25,600
takes any possible rule at each step
 

10407
03:19:25,600 --> 03:19:27,950
takes any possible rule at each step
that is this Ral multi-way graph the set

10408
03:19:27,950 --> 03:19:27,960
that is this Ral multi-way graph the set
 

10409
03:19:27,960 --> 03:19:30,349
that is this Ral multi-way graph the set
of the set of trans the set of possible

10410
03:19:30,349 --> 03:19:30,359
of the set of trans the set of possible
 

10411
03:19:30,359 --> 03:19:32,150
of the set of trans the set of possible
histories of that extreme

10412
03:19:32,150 --> 03:19:32,160
histories of that extreme
 

10413
03:19:32,160 --> 03:19:34,269
histories of that extreme
non-deterministic tur machine is a ruo

10414
03:19:34,269 --> 03:19:34,279
non-deterministic tur machine is a ruo
 

10415
03:19:34,279 --> 03:19:37,189
non-deterministic tur machine is a ruo
multi-way graph and you're uh what term

10416
03:19:37,189 --> 03:19:37,199
multi-way graph and you're uh what term
 

10417
03:19:37,199 --> 03:19:40,950
multi-way graph and you're uh what term
you using ruo ruo it's a weird word yeah

10418
03:19:40,950 --> 03:19:40,960
you using ruo ruo it's a weird word yeah
 

10419
03:19:40,960 --> 03:19:44,309
you using ruo ruo it's a weird word yeah
it's a weird word right multi-way graph

10420
03:19:44,309 --> 03:19:44,319
it's a weird word right multi-way graph
 

10421
03:19:44,319 --> 03:19:47,790
it's a weird word right multi-way graph
okay so this so that I'm trying think

10422
03:19:47,790 --> 03:19:47,800
okay so this so that I'm trying think
 

10423
03:19:47,800 --> 03:19:50,630
okay so this so that I'm trying think
of I'm trying to think of the space of

10424
03:19:50,630 --> 03:19:50,640
of I'm trying to think of the space of
 

10425
03:19:50,640 --> 03:19:53,189
of I'm trying to think of the space of
rules uh so these are basic

10426
03:19:53,189 --> 03:19:53,199
rules uh so these are basic
 

10427
03:19:53,199 --> 03:19:55,830
rules uh so these are basic
Transformations so in a turning machine

10428
03:19:55,830 --> 03:19:55,840
Transformations so in a turning machine
 

10429
03:19:55,840 --> 03:19:58,150
Transformations so in a turning machine
it's like it says move left move you

10430
03:19:58,150 --> 03:19:58,160
it's like it says move left move you
 

10431
03:19:58,160 --> 03:20:00,550
it's like it says move left move you
know if it's a one if it's a black

10432
03:20:00,550 --> 03:20:00,560
know if it's a one if it's a black
 

10433
03:20:00,560 --> 03:20:03,229
know if it's a one if it's a black
Square under the head move left and

10434
03:20:03,229 --> 03:20:03,239
Square under the head move left and
 

10435
03:20:03,239 --> 03:20:05,790
Square under the head move left and
right a green square that's a rule

10436
03:20:05,790 --> 03:20:05,800
right a green square that's a rule
 

10437
03:20:05,800 --> 03:20:07,309
right a green square that's a rule
that's a very basic rule but I'm trying

10438
03:20:07,309 --> 03:20:07,319
that's a very basic rule but I'm trying
 

10439
03:20:07,319 --> 03:20:10,189
that's a very basic rule but I'm trying
to see the rules on the hypergraphs how

10440
03:20:10,189 --> 03:20:10,199
to see the rules on the hypergraphs how
 

10441
03:20:10,199 --> 03:20:12,469
to see the rules on the hypergraphs how
rich of the programs can they be or do

10442
03:20:12,469 --> 03:20:12,479
rich of the programs can they be or do
 

10443
03:20:12,479 --> 03:20:14,750
rich of the programs can they be or do
they all ultimately just map into

10444
03:20:14,750 --> 03:20:14,760
they all ultimately just map into
 

10445
03:20:14,760 --> 03:20:17,070
they all ultimately just map into
something simple yeah they will I mean

10446
03:20:17,070 --> 03:20:17,080
something simple yeah they will I mean
 

10447
03:20:17,080 --> 03:20:19,070
something simple yeah they will I mean
hypergraphs that's another layer of

10448
03:20:19,070 --> 03:20:19,080
hypergraphs that's another layer of
 

10449
03:20:19,080 --> 03:20:20,510
hypergraphs that's another layer of
complexity on this whole thing you can

10450
03:20:20,510 --> 03:20:20,520
complexity on this whole thing you can
 

10451
03:20:20,520 --> 03:20:21,469
complexity on this whole thing you can
you can think about these in

10452
03:20:21,469 --> 03:20:21,479
you can think about these in
 

10453
03:20:21,479 --> 03:20:23,229
you can think about these in
transformations of hypergraphs but

10454
03:20:23,229 --> 03:20:23,239
transformations of hypergraphs but
 

10455
03:20:23,239 --> 03:20:24,830
transformations of hypergraphs but
touring machines are a little bit put

10456
03:20:24,830 --> 03:20:24,840
touring machines are a little bit put
 

10457
03:20:24,840 --> 03:20:26,309
touring machines are a little bit put
touring machines okay right they're a

10458
03:20:26,309 --> 03:20:26,319
touring machines okay right they're a
 

10459
03:20:26,319 --> 03:20:28,469
touring machines okay right they're a
little bit simpler so if you look at

10460
03:20:28,469 --> 03:20:28,479
little bit simpler so if you look at
 

10461
03:20:28,479 --> 03:20:30,229
little bit simpler so if you look at
these extreme non-deterministic touring

10462
03:20:30,229 --> 03:20:30,239
these extreme non-deterministic touring
 

10463
03:20:30,239 --> 03:20:33,030
these extreme non-deterministic touring
machines you're mapping out all the

10464
03:20:33,030 --> 03:20:33,040
machines you're mapping out all the
 

10465
03:20:33,040 --> 03:20:35,189
machines you're mapping out all the
possible non-deterministic paths that

10466
03:20:35,189 --> 03:20:35,199
possible non-deterministic paths that
 

10467
03:20:35,199 --> 03:20:37,710
possible non-deterministic paths that
the turing machine can follow yeah and

10468
03:20:37,710 --> 03:20:37,720
the turing machine can follow yeah and
 

10469
03:20:37,720 --> 03:20:40,150
the turing machine can follow yeah and
and if you ask the question uh can you

10470
03:20:40,150 --> 03:20:40,160
and if you ask the question uh can you
 

10471
03:20:40,160 --> 03:20:42,990
and if you ask the question uh can you
reach okay so so a deterministic turing

10472
03:20:42,990 --> 03:20:43,000
reach okay so so a deterministic turing
 

10473
03:20:43,000 --> 03:20:44,910
reach okay so so a deterministic turing
machine follows a single path the

10474
03:20:44,910 --> 03:20:44,920
machine follows a single path the
 

10475
03:20:44,920 --> 03:20:46,790
machine follows a single path the
non-deterministic turing machine fills

10476
03:20:46,790 --> 03:20:46,800
non-deterministic turing machine fills
 

10477
03:20:46,800 --> 03:20:49,750
non-deterministic turing machine fills
out this whole uh sort of ball of

10478
03:20:49,750 --> 03:20:49,760
out this whole uh sort of ball of
 

10479
03:20:49,760 --> 03:20:52,110
out this whole uh sort of ball of
possibilities and so then the P versus

10480
03:20:52,110 --> 03:20:52,120
possibilities and so then the P versus
 

10481
03:20:52,120 --> 03:20:55,189
possibilities and so then the P versus
MP problem ends up being questions about

10482
03:20:55,189 --> 03:20:55,199
MP problem ends up being questions about
 

10483
03:20:55,199 --> 03:20:56,750
MP problem ends up being questions about
and we haven't completely figured out

10484
03:20:56,750 --> 03:20:56,760
and we haven't completely figured out
 

10485
03:20:56,760 --> 03:20:57,910
and we haven't completely figured out
all the details of this but it's

10486
03:20:57,910 --> 03:20:57,920
all the details of this but it's
 

10487
03:20:57,920 --> 03:21:00,790
all the details of this but it's
basically has to do with questions about

10488
03:21:00,790 --> 03:21:00,800
basically has to do with questions about
 

10489
03:21:00,800 --> 03:21:03,510
basically has to do with questions about
the the growth of that ball relative to

10490
03:21:03,510 --> 03:21:03,520
the the growth of that ball relative to
 

10491
03:21:03,520 --> 03:21:05,150
the the growth of that ball relative to
what happens with individual paths and

10492
03:21:05,150 --> 03:21:05,160
what happens with individual paths and
 

10493
03:21:05,160 --> 03:21:06,870
what happens with individual paths and
so on so essentially there's a

10494
03:21:06,870 --> 03:21:06,880
so on so essentially there's a
 

10495
03:21:06,880 --> 03:21:09,030
so on so essentially there's a
geometrization of the P versus MP

10496
03:21:09,030 --> 03:21:09,040
geometrization of the P versus MP
 

10497
03:21:09,040 --> 03:21:10,630
geometrization of the P versus MP
problem that comes out of this that's a

10498
03:21:10,630 --> 03:21:10,640
problem that comes out of this that's a
 

10499
03:21:10,640 --> 03:21:13,630
problem that comes out of this that's a
sideshow okay the main the main event

10500
03:21:13,630 --> 03:21:13,640
sideshow okay the main the main event
 

10501
03:21:13,640 --> 03:21:16,710
sideshow okay the main the main event
here is the statement that you can look

10502
03:21:16,710 --> 03:21:16,720
here is the statement that you can look
 

10503
03:21:16,720 --> 03:21:20,590
here is the statement that you can look
at this multi-way graph where the

10504
03:21:20,590 --> 03:21:20,600
at this multi-way graph where the
 

10505
03:21:20,600 --> 03:21:22,309
at this multi-way graph where the
branches correspond not just to

10506
03:21:22,309 --> 03:21:22,319
branches correspond not just to
 

10507
03:21:22,319 --> 03:21:24,189
branches correspond not just to
different applications of a single rule

10508
03:21:24,189 --> 03:21:24,199
different applications of a single rule
 

10509
03:21:24,199 --> 03:21:25,590
different applications of a single rule
but to different application to

10510
03:21:25,590 --> 03:21:25,600
but to different application to
 

10511
03:21:25,600 --> 03:21:28,469
but to different application to
Applications of different rules okay and

10512
03:21:28,469 --> 03:21:28,479
Applications of different rules okay and
 

10513
03:21:28,479 --> 03:21:32,550
Applications of different rules okay and
that then that when you say I'm going to

10514
03:21:32,550 --> 03:21:32,560
that then that when you say I'm going to
 

10515
03:21:32,560 --> 03:21:35,429
that then that when you say I'm going to
be an observer embedded in that system

10516
03:21:35,429 --> 03:21:35,439
be an observer embedded in that system
 

10517
03:21:35,439 --> 03:21:37,070
be an observer embedded in that system
and I'm going to try and make sense of

10518
03:21:37,070 --> 03:21:37,080
and I'm going to try and make sense of
 

10519
03:21:37,080 --> 03:21:39,389
and I'm going to try and make sense of
what's going on in the system and to do

10520
03:21:39,389 --> 03:21:39,399
what's going on in the system and to do
 

10521
03:21:39,399 --> 03:21:41,590
what's going on in the system and to do
that I essentially I'm picking a

10522
03:21:41,590 --> 03:21:41,600
that I essentially I'm picking a
 

10523
03:21:41,600 --> 03:21:45,510
that I essentially I'm picking a
reference frame and that turns out to be

10524
03:21:45,510 --> 03:21:45,520
reference frame and that turns out to be
 

10525
03:21:45,520 --> 03:21:47,790
reference frame and that turns out to be
uh well okay so the way this comes out

10526
03:21:47,790 --> 03:21:47,800
uh well okay so the way this comes out
 

10527
03:21:47,800 --> 03:21:49,950
uh well okay so the way this comes out
essentially is the reference frame you

10528
03:21:49,950 --> 03:21:49,960
essentially is the reference frame you
 

10529
03:21:49,960 --> 03:21:52,870
essentially is the reference frame you
pick is the rule that you infer is

10530
03:21:52,870 --> 03:21:52,880
pick is the rule that you infer is
 

10531
03:21:52,880 --> 03:21:55,710
pick is the rule that you infer is
what's going on in the universe even

10532
03:21:55,710 --> 03:21:55,720
what's going on in the universe even
 

10533
03:21:55,720 --> 03:21:58,950
what's going on in the universe even
though all possible rules are being run

10534
03:21:58,950 --> 03:21:58,960
though all possible rules are being run
 

10535
03:21:58,960 --> 03:22:01,389
though all possible rules are being run
although all those possible rules are in

10536
03:22:01,389 --> 03:22:01,399
although all those possible rules are in
 

10537
03:22:01,399 --> 03:22:02,870
although all those possible rules are in
a sense giving the same answer because

10538
03:22:02,870 --> 03:22:02,880
a sense giving the same answer because
 

10539
03:22:02,880 --> 03:22:06,189
a sense giving the same answer because
of causal invariance MH but what you see

10540
03:22:06,189 --> 03:22:06,199
of causal invariance MH but what you see
 

10541
03:22:06,199 --> 03:22:08,590
of causal invariance MH but what you see
will be could be completely different if

10542
03:22:08,590 --> 03:22:08,600
will be could be completely different if
 

10543
03:22:08,600 --> 03:22:10,469
will be could be completely different if
you pick different reference frames you

10544
03:22:10,469 --> 03:22:10,479
you pick different reference frames you
 

10545
03:22:10,479 --> 03:22:12,469
you pick different reference frames you
essentially have a different description

10546
03:22:12,469 --> 03:22:12,479
essentially have a different description
 

10547
03:22:12,479 --> 03:22:15,110
essentially have a different description
language for describing the universe

10548
03:22:15,110 --> 03:22:15,120
language for describing the universe
 

10549
03:22:15,120 --> 03:22:16,590
language for describing the universe
okay so how does what does this really

10550
03:22:16,590 --> 03:22:16,600
okay so how does what does this really
 

10551
03:22:16,600 --> 03:22:19,630
okay so how does what does this really
mean in practice so imagine there's us

10552
03:22:19,630 --> 03:22:19,640
mean in practice so imagine there's us
 

10553
03:22:19,640 --> 03:22:21,229
mean in practice so imagine there's us
we think about the universe in terms of

10554
03:22:21,229 --> 03:22:21,239
we think about the universe in terms of
 

10555
03:22:21,239 --> 03:22:23,150
we think about the universe in terms of
space and time and we have various kinds

10556
03:22:23,150 --> 03:22:23,160
space and time and we have various kinds
 

10557
03:22:23,160 --> 03:22:25,229
space and time and we have various kinds
of description models and so on now

10558
03:22:25,229 --> 03:22:25,239
of description models and so on now
 

10559
03:22:25,239 --> 03:22:27,790
of description models and so on now
let's imagine the friendly aliens for

10560
03:22:27,790 --> 03:22:27,800
let's imagine the friendly aliens for
 

10561
03:22:27,800 --> 03:22:30,429
let's imagine the friendly aliens for
example right how do they describe their

10562
03:22:30,429 --> 03:22:30,439
example right how do they describe their
 

10563
03:22:30,439 --> 03:22:32,750
example right how do they describe their
Universe well you know our description

10564
03:22:32,750 --> 03:22:32,760
Universe well you know our description
 

10565
03:22:32,760 --> 03:22:34,750
Universe well you know our description
of the universe probably is affected by

10566
03:22:34,750 --> 03:22:34,760
of the universe probably is affected by
 

10567
03:22:34,760 --> 03:22:36,870
of the universe probably is affected by
the fact that you know we are about the

10568
03:22:36,870 --> 03:22:36,880
the fact that you know we are about the
 

10569
03:22:36,880 --> 03:22:39,510
the fact that you know we are about the
size we are you know meter is tall so to

10570
03:22:39,510 --> 03:22:39,520
size we are you know meter is tall so to
 

10571
03:22:39,520 --> 03:22:41,990
size we are you know meter is tall so to
speak we have brain processing speeds we

10572
03:22:41,990 --> 03:22:42,000
speak we have brain processing speeds we
 

10573
03:22:42,000 --> 03:22:44,349
speak we have brain processing speeds we
about the speeds we have we're not the

10574
03:22:44,349 --> 03:22:44,359
about the speeds we have we're not the
 

10575
03:22:44,359 --> 03:22:46,870
about the speeds we have we're not the
size of planets for example we the speed

10576
03:22:46,870 --> 03:22:46,880
size of planets for example we the speed
 

10577
03:22:46,880 --> 03:22:49,110
size of planets for example we the speed
of light really would matter you know in

10578
03:22:49,110 --> 03:22:49,120
of light really would matter you know in
 

10579
03:22:49,120 --> 03:22:50,670
of light really would matter you know in
our everyday life the speed of light

10580
03:22:50,670 --> 03:22:50,680
our everyday life the speed of light
 

10581
03:22:50,680 --> 03:22:52,590
our everyday life the speed of light
doesn't really matter everything can be

10582
03:22:52,590 --> 03:22:52,600
doesn't really matter everything can be
 

10583
03:22:52,600 --> 03:22:54,110
doesn't really matter everything can be
you know the fact that speed of light is

10584
03:22:54,110 --> 03:22:54,120
you know the fact that speed of light is
 

10585
03:22:54,120 --> 03:22:55,910
you know the fact that speed of light is
finite is irrelevant it could as well be

10586
03:22:55,910 --> 03:22:55,920
finite is irrelevant it could as well be
 

10587
03:22:55,920 --> 03:22:57,670
finite is irrelevant it could as well be
infinite we wouldn't wouldn't make any

10588
03:22:57,670 --> 03:22:57,680
infinite we wouldn't wouldn't make any
 

10589
03:22:57,680 --> 03:22:59,750
infinite we wouldn't wouldn't make any
difference you know it affects the the

10590
03:22:59,750 --> 03:22:59,760
difference you know it affects the the
 

10591
03:22:59,760 --> 03:23:02,309
difference you know it affects the the
Ping times on the internet that's about

10592
03:23:02,309 --> 03:23:02,319
Ping times on the internet that's about
 

10593
03:23:02,319 --> 03:23:04,469
Ping times on the internet that's about
that's about the level of of um of how

10594
03:23:04,469 --> 03:23:04,479
that's about the level of of um of how
 

10595
03:23:04,479 --> 03:23:06,469
that's about the level of of um of how
we notice the speed of light in our sort

10596
03:23:06,469 --> 03:23:06,479
we notice the speed of light in our sort
 

10597
03:23:06,479 --> 03:23:07,790
we notice the speed of light in our sort
of everyday existence we don't really

10598
03:23:07,790 --> 03:23:07,800
of everyday existence we don't really
 

10599
03:23:07,800 --> 03:23:10,710
of everyday existence we don't really
notice it um and so we have a way of

10600
03:23:10,710 --> 03:23:10,720
notice it um and so we have a way of
 

10601
03:23:10,720 --> 03:23:13,309
notice it um and so we have a way of
describing the universe that's based on

10602
03:23:13,309 --> 03:23:13,319
describing the universe that's based on
 

10603
03:23:13,319 --> 03:23:17,110
describing the universe that's based on
our sensory you know our senses our uh

10604
03:23:17,110 --> 03:23:17,120
our sensory you know our senses our uh
 

10605
03:23:17,120 --> 03:23:19,030
our sensory you know our senses our uh
in these days also on the mathematics

10606
03:23:19,030 --> 03:23:19,040
in these days also on the mathematics
 

10607
03:23:19,040 --> 03:23:21,429
in these days also on the mathematics
we've constructed and so on but the

10608
03:23:21,429 --> 03:23:21,439
we've constructed and so on but the
 

10609
03:23:21,439 --> 03:23:23,469
we've constructed and so on but the
realization is it's not the only way to

10610
03:23:23,469 --> 03:23:23,479
realization is it's not the only way to
 

10611
03:23:23,479 --> 03:23:25,990
realization is it's not the only way to
do it there will be completely

10612
03:23:25,990 --> 03:23:26,000
do it there will be completely
 

10613
03:23:26,000 --> 03:23:27,710
do it there will be completely
completely utterly incoherent

10614
03:23:27,710 --> 03:23:27,720
completely utterly incoherent
 

10615
03:23:27,720 --> 03:23:30,269
completely utterly incoherent
descriptions of the universe which

10616
03:23:30,269 --> 03:23:30,279
descriptions of the universe which
 

10617
03:23:30,279 --> 03:23:32,750
descriptions of the universe which
correspond to different reference frames

10618
03:23:32,750 --> 03:23:32,760
correspond to different reference frames
 

10619
03:23:32,760 --> 03:23:34,990
correspond to different reference frames
in this sort of Ral space in the Ral

10620
03:23:34,990 --> 03:23:35,000
in this sort of Ral space in the Ral
 

10621
03:23:35,000 --> 03:23:36,990
in this sort of Ral space in the Ral
space that's fascinating so we're we

10622
03:23:36,990 --> 03:23:37,000
space that's fascinating so we're we
 

10623
03:23:37,000 --> 03:23:38,229
space that's fascinating so we're we
have some kind of reference frame in

10624
03:23:38,229 --> 03:23:38,239
have some kind of reference frame in
 

10625
03:23:38,239 --> 03:23:40,790
have some kind of reference frame in
this Ral space right and from

10626
03:23:40,790 --> 03:23:40,800
this Ral space right and from
 

10627
03:23:40,800 --> 03:23:44,150
this Ral space right and from
that that's why we are attributing this

10628
03:23:44,150 --> 03:23:44,160
that that's why we are attributing this
 

10629
03:23:44,160 --> 03:23:46,150
that that's why we are attributing this
rule to the universe so in other words

10630
03:23:46,150 --> 03:23:46,160
rule to the universe so in other words
 

10631
03:23:46,160 --> 03:23:48,590
rule to the universe so in other words
when we say why is it this Rule and not

10632
03:23:48,590 --> 03:23:48,600
when we say why is it this Rule and not
 

10633
03:23:48,600 --> 03:23:52,269
when we say why is it this Rule and not
another the answer is just you know

10634
03:23:52,269 --> 03:23:52,279
another the answer is just you know
 

10635
03:23:52,279 --> 03:23:54,630
another the answer is just you know
Shine the Light back on us so to speak

10636
03:23:54,630 --> 03:23:54,640
Shine the Light back on us so to speak
 

10637
03:23:54,640 --> 03:23:56,229
Shine the Light back on us so to speak
it's because of the reference frame that

10638
03:23:56,229 --> 03:23:56,239
it's because of the reference frame that
 

10639
03:23:56,239 --> 03:23:58,389
it's because of the reference frame that
we've picked in our way of understanding

10640
03:23:58,389 --> 03:23:58,399
we've picked in our way of understanding
 

10641
03:23:58,399 --> 03:24:00,590
we've picked in our way of understanding
what's happening in the sort of uh space

10642
03:24:00,590 --> 03:24:00,600
what's happening in the sort of uh space
 

10643
03:24:00,600 --> 03:24:02,990
what's happening in the sort of uh space
of all possible rules and so on but also

10644
03:24:02,990 --> 03:24:03,000
of all possible rules and so on but also
 

10645
03:24:03,000 --> 03:24:05,150
of all possible rules and so on but also
in the space from this reference

10646
03:24:05,150 --> 03:24:05,160
in the space from this reference
 

10647
03:24:05,160 --> 03:24:08,710
in the space from this reference
frame because of the royal the

10648
03:24:08,710 --> 03:24:08,720
frame because of the royal the
 

10649
03:24:08,720 --> 03:24:11,469
frame because of the royal the
the the

10650
03:24:11,469 --> 03:24:11,479
the the
 

10651
03:24:11,479 --> 03:24:13,870
the the
invariance that

10652
03:24:13,870 --> 03:24:13,880
invariance that
 

10653
03:24:13,880 --> 03:24:15,950
invariance that
simple that the rule on which the

10654
03:24:15,950 --> 03:24:15,960
simple that the rule on which the
 

10655
03:24:15,960 --> 03:24:17,469
simple that the rule on which the
universe

10656
03:24:17,469 --> 03:24:17,479
universe
 

10657
03:24:17,479 --> 03:24:19,750
universe
with which you can run the universe

10658
03:24:19,750 --> 03:24:19,760
with which you can run the universe
 

10659
03:24:19,760 --> 03:24:22,469
with which you can run the universe
might as well be simple yes yes but okay

10660
03:24:22,469 --> 03:24:22,479
might as well be simple yes yes but okay
 

10661
03:24:22,479 --> 03:24:24,550
might as well be simple yes yes but okay
so so here's another point so this is

10662
03:24:24,550 --> 03:24:24,560
so so here's another point so this is
 

10663
03:24:24,560 --> 03:24:26,269
so so here's another point so this is
again these are a little bit mind

10664
03:24:26,269 --> 03:24:26,279
again these are a little bit mind
 

10665
03:24:26,279 --> 03:24:28,550
again these are a little bit mind
twisting in some ways but but the the

10666
03:24:28,550 --> 03:24:28,560
twisting in some ways but but the the
 

10667
03:24:28,560 --> 03:24:31,189
twisting in some ways but but the the
the um um okay another thing that's sort

10668
03:24:31,189 --> 03:24:31,199
the um um okay another thing that's sort
 

10669
03:24:31,199 --> 03:24:34,469
the um um okay another thing that's sort
of we know from computation is this idea

10670
03:24:34,469 --> 03:24:34,479
of we know from computation is this idea
 

10671
03:24:34,479 --> 03:24:37,070
of we know from computation is this idea
of computation universality the fact

10672
03:24:37,070 --> 03:24:37,080
of computation universality the fact
 

10673
03:24:37,080 --> 03:24:38,870
of computation universality the fact
that given that we have a program that

10674
03:24:38,870 --> 03:24:38,880
that given that we have a program that
 

10675
03:24:38,880 --> 03:24:41,590
that given that we have a program that
runs on one kind of computer we can as

10676
03:24:41,590 --> 03:24:41,600
runs on one kind of computer we can as
 

10677
03:24:41,600 --> 03:24:44,150
runs on one kind of computer we can as
well you know we can convert it to run

10678
03:24:44,150 --> 03:24:44,160
well you know we can convert it to run
 

10679
03:24:44,160 --> 03:24:45,630
well you know we can convert it to run
on any other kind of computer we can

10680
03:24:45,630 --> 03:24:45,640
on any other kind of computer we can
 

10681
03:24:45,640 --> 03:24:47,030
on any other kind of computer we can
emulate one kind of computer with

10682
03:24:47,030 --> 03:24:47,040
emulate one kind of computer with
 

10683
03:24:47,040 --> 03:24:50,349
emulate one kind of computer with
another so that might lead you to say

10684
03:24:50,349 --> 03:24:50,359
another so that might lead you to say
 

10685
03:24:50,359 --> 03:24:51,870
another so that might lead you to say
well you think you have the rule for the

10686
03:24:51,870 --> 03:24:51,880
well you think you have the rule for the
 

10687
03:24:51,880 --> 03:24:53,429
well you think you have the rule for the
universe but you might as well be

10688
03:24:53,429 --> 03:24:53,439
universe but you might as well be
 

10689
03:24:53,439 --> 03:24:55,229
universe but you might as well be
running it on a touring machine because

10690
03:24:55,229 --> 03:24:55,239
running it on a touring machine because
 

10691
03:24:55,239 --> 03:24:58,110
running it on a touring machine because
we know we can emulate any computational

10692
03:24:58,110 --> 03:24:58,120
we know we can emulate any computational
 

10693
03:24:58,120 --> 03:25:01,269
we know we can emulate any computational
rule on any kind of machine and that's

10694
03:25:01,269 --> 03:25:01,279
rule on any kind of machine and that's
 

10695
03:25:01,279 --> 03:25:02,670
rule on any kind of machine and that's
essentially the same thing that's being

10696
03:25:02,670 --> 03:25:02,680
essentially the same thing that's being
 

10697
03:25:02,680 --> 03:25:05,510
essentially the same thing that's being
said here that is that what we're doing

10698
03:25:05,510 --> 03:25:05,520
said here that is that what we're doing
 

10699
03:25:05,520 --> 03:25:08,349
said here that is that what we're doing
is we're saying um these different

03:25:08,349 --> 03:25:08,359
is we're saying um these different
 

10701
03:25:08,359 --> 03:25:11,469
is we're saying um these different
interpretations of physics correspond to

03:25:11,469 --> 03:25:11,479
interpretations of physics correspond to
 

10703
03:25:11,479 --> 03:25:14,229
interpretations of physics correspond to
essentially running physics on different

03:25:14,229 --> 03:25:14,239
essentially running physics on different
 

10705
03:25:14,239 --> 03:25:16,830
essentially running physics on different

different underlying computers were
 

10713
03:25:21,720 --> 03:25:24,469
different underlying computers were
running them and but because of

03:25:24,469 --> 03:25:24,479
running them and but because of
 

10715
03:25:24,479 --> 03:25:26,429
running them and but because of
computation universality or more

computation universality or more
 

10717

there's that they are um these things
 

10723

might sound like you're not really
 

10747
03:26:00,080 --> 03:26:02,630
might sound like you're not really
saying anything there but you are

03:26:02,630 --> 03:26:02,640
saying anything there but you are
 

10749
03:26:02,640 --> 03:26:04,870
saying anything there but you are
because you can you could in principle

03:26:04,880 --> 03:26:08,070
because you can you could in principle
have a hypercomp computer that things

10752
03:26:08,070 --> 03:26:08,080
have a hypercomp computer that things
 

10753
03:26:08,080 --> 03:26:09,790
have a hypercomp computer that things
that take an ordinary computer in

03:26:09,800 --> 03:26:11,269
that take an ordinary computer in

answer it's this immediately what this

10760
03:26:15,950 --> 03:26:15,960
answer it's this immediately what this
 

10761
03:26:15,960 --> 03:26:18,630
answer it's this immediately what this
is saying is the universe is not a hyper

10762
03:26:18,630 --> 03:26:18,640
is saying is the universe is not a hyper
 

10763
03:26:18,640 --> 03:26:21,910
is saying is the universe is not a hyper
Compu it's not simpler than a an

10764
03:26:21,910 --> 03:26:21,920
Compu it's not simpler than a an
 

10765
03:26:21,920 --> 03:26:23,990
Compu it's not simpler than a an
ordinary touring machine type computer

10766
03:26:23,990 --> 03:26:24,000
ordinary touring machine type computer
 

10767
03:26:24,000 --> 03:26:26,389
ordinary touring machine type computer
it's exactly like an ordinary touring

10768
03:26:26,389 --> 03:26:26,399
it's exactly like an ordinary touring
 

10769
03:26:26,399 --> 03:26:29,229
it's exactly like an ordinary touring
machine type computer and so that's the

10770
03:26:29,229 --> 03:26:29,239
machine type computer and so that's the
 

10771
03:26:29,239 --> 03:26:31,670
machine type computer and so that's the
that's in the end the sort of net net

10772
03:26:31,670 --> 03:26:31,680
that's in the end the sort of net net
 

10773
03:26:31,680 --> 03:26:34,309
that's in the end the sort of net net
conclusion is that's the thing that is

10774
03:26:34,309 --> 03:26:34,319
conclusion is that's the thing that is
 

10775
03:26:34,319 --> 03:26:36,550
conclusion is that's the thing that is
the sort of the hard immovable fact

the sort of the hard immovable fact
about the universe that's sort of the

the fundamental principle of the
 

10781
03:26:40,680 --> 03:26:43,750
the fundamental principle of the
universe is that it is computational and

10782
03:26:43,750 --> 03:26:43,760
universe is that it is computational and
 

10783
03:26:43,760 --> 03:26:46,349
universe is that it is computational and
not hyper computational and not sort of

they experience the same physics right

10808
03:27:15,550 --> 03:27:15,560
they experience the same physics right
 

10809
03:27:15,560 --> 03:27:17,830
they experience the same physics right
and now I've realized isn't true they

10810
03:27:17,830 --> 03:27:17,840
and now I've realized isn't true they
 

10811
03:27:17,840 --> 03:27:19,590
and now I've realized isn't true they
could have a different roal frame that's

03:27:19,590 --> 03:27:19,600
could have a different roal frame that's
 

10813
03:27:19,600 --> 03:27:22,070
could have a different roal frame that's
that's fascinating they can end up with

03:27:22,070 --> 03:27:22,080
that's fascinating they can end up with
 

10815
03:27:22,080 --> 03:27:25,189
that's fascinating they can end up with
a a a a description of the universe that

03:27:25,189 --> 03:27:25,199
a a a a description of the universe that
 

10817
03:27:25,199 --> 03:27:28,150
a a a a description of the universe that
is utterly utterly incoherent with ours

10818
03:27:28,150 --> 03:27:28,160
is utterly utterly incoherent with ours
 

10819
03:27:28,160 --> 03:27:29,630
is utterly utterly incoherent with ours
and and that's also interesting in terms

10820
03:27:29,630 --> 03:27:29,640
and and that's also interesting in terms
 

10821
03:27:29,640 --> 03:27:32,030
and and that's also interesting in terms
of how we think about well intelligence

10822
03:27:32,030 --> 03:27:32,040
of how we think about well intelligence
 

10823
03:27:32,040 --> 03:27:33,590
of how we think about well intelligence
the nature of intelligence and so on you

10824
03:27:33,590 --> 03:27:33,600
the nature of intelligence and so on you
 

10825
03:27:33,600 --> 03:27:35,389
the nature of intelligence and so on you
know I'm I'm fond of the quote you know

10826
03:27:35,389 --> 03:27:35,399
know I'm I'm fond of the quote you know
 

10827
03:27:35,399 --> 03:27:37,429
know I'm I'm fond of the quote you know
the weather has a mind of its own

10828
03:27:37,429 --> 03:27:37,439
the weather has a mind of its own
 

10829
03:27:37,439 --> 03:27:39,469
the weather has a mind of its own
because these are you know these are

10830
03:27:39,469 --> 03:27:39,479
because these are you know these are
 

10831
03:27:39,479 --> 03:27:41,710
because these are you know these are
sort of computationally that that system

10832
03:27:41,710 --> 03:27:41,720
sort of computationally that that system
 

10833
03:27:41,720 --> 03:27:44,349
sort of computationally that that system
is computationally equivalent to the

10834
03:27:44,349 --> 03:27:44,359
is computationally equivalent to the
 

10835
03:27:44,359 --> 03:27:47,070
is computationally equivalent to the
system that is our brains and so on and

10836
03:27:47,070 --> 03:27:47,080
system that is our brains and so on and
 

10837
03:27:47,080 --> 03:27:48,550
system that is our brains and so on and
what's different is we don't have a way

10838
03:27:48,550 --> 03:27:48,560
what's different is we don't have a way
 

10839
03:27:48,560 --> 03:27:50,990
what's different is we don't have a way
to understand you know what the weather

10840
03:27:50,990 --> 03:27:51,000
to understand you know what the weather
 

10841
03:27:51,000 --> 03:27:52,830
to understand you know what the weather
is trying to do so to speak we have a

10842
03:27:52,830 --> 03:27:52,840
is trying to do so to speak we have a
 

10843
03:27:52,840 --> 03:27:53,950
is trying to do so to speak we have a
story about what's happening in our

10844
03:27:53,950 --> 03:27:53,960
story about what's happening in our
 

10845
03:27:53,960 --> 03:27:55,750
story about what's happening in our
brains we don't have a sort of

10846
03:27:55,750 --> 03:27:55,760
brains we don't have a sort of
 

10847
03:27:55,760 --> 03:27:58,070
brains we don't have a sort of
connection to what's happening there so

10848
03:27:58,070 --> 03:27:58,080
connection to what's happening there so
 

10849
03:27:58,080 --> 03:28:01,229
connection to what's happening there so
we actually it's funny last time we

10850
03:28:01,229 --> 03:28:01,239
we actually it's funny last time we
 

10851
03:28:01,239 --> 03:28:04,269
we actually it's funny last time we
talked maybe over a year ago uh we

10852
03:28:04,269 --> 03:28:04,279
talked maybe over a year ago uh we
 

10853
03:28:04,279 --> 03:28:07,630
talked maybe over a year ago uh we
talked about how it was more based on

10854
03:28:07,630 --> 03:28:07,640
talked about how it was more based on
 

10855
03:28:07,640 --> 03:28:10,269
talked about how it was more based on
your work with a rival uh we talked

10856
03:28:10,269 --> 03:28:10,279
your work with a rival uh we talked
 

10857
03:28:10,279 --> 03:28:11,710
your work with a rival uh we talked
about how would we communicate with

10858
03:28:11,710 --> 03:28:11,720
about how would we communicate with
 

10859
03:28:11,720 --> 03:28:13,150
about how would we communicate with
alien

10860
03:28:13,150 --> 03:28:13,160
alien
 

10861
03:28:13,160 --> 03:28:16,750
alien
intelligences can you maybe comment on

10862
03:28:16,750 --> 03:28:16,760
intelligences can you maybe comment on
 

10863
03:28:16,760 --> 03:28:19,510
intelligences can you maybe comment on
how we might how the wol from physics

10864
03:28:19,510 --> 03:28:19,520
how we might how the wol from physics
 

10865
03:28:19,520 --> 03:28:21,189
how we might how the wol from physics
project changed your view how we might

10866
03:28:21,189 --> 03:28:21,199
project changed your view how we might
 

10867
03:28:21,199 --> 03:28:22,590
project changed your view how we might
be able to communicate with alien

10868
03:28:22,590 --> 03:28:22,600
be able to communicate with alien
 

10869
03:28:22,600 --> 03:28:25,110
be able to communicate with alien
intelligence like if they showed up is

10870
03:28:25,110 --> 03:28:25,120
intelligence like if they showed up is
 

10871
03:28:25,120 --> 03:28:29,070
intelligence like if they showed up is
it possible that because of our com

10872
03:28:29,070 --> 03:28:29,080
it possible that because of our com
 

10873
03:28:29,080 --> 03:28:31,309
it possible that because of our com
comprehension of the physics of the

10874
03:28:31,309 --> 03:28:31,319
comprehension of the physics of the
 

10875
03:28:31,319 --> 03:28:33,710
comprehension of the physics of the
world might be completely different we

10876
03:28:33,710 --> 03:28:33,720
world might be completely different we
 

10877
03:28:33,720 --> 03:28:36,150
world might be completely different we
would just not be able to communicate at

10878
03:28:36,150 --> 03:28:36,160
would just not be able to communicate at
 

10879
03:28:36,160 --> 03:28:38,150
would just not be able to communicate at
all here's here's the here's the thing

10880
03:28:38,150 --> 03:28:38,160
all here's here's the here's the thing
 

10881
03:28:38,160 --> 03:28:41,670
all here's here's the here's the thing
you know intelligence is everywhere the

10882
03:28:41,670 --> 03:28:41,680
you know intelligence is everywhere the
 

10883
03:28:41,680 --> 03:28:43,550
you know intelligence is everywhere the
fact this idea that there's this notion

10884
03:28:43,550 --> 03:28:43,560
fact this idea that there's this notion
 

10885
03:28:43,560 --> 03:28:44,990
fact this idea that there's this notion
of oh there's going to be this amazing

10886
03:28:44,990 --> 03:28:45,000
of oh there's going to be this amazing
 

10887
03:28:45,000 --> 03:28:46,710
of oh there's going to be this amazing
extraterrestrial intelligence and it's

10888
03:28:46,710 --> 03:28:46,720
extraterrestrial intelligence and it's
 

10889
03:28:46,720 --> 03:28:49,110
extraterrestrial intelligence and it's
going to be this unique thing it's just

10890
03:28:49,110 --> 03:28:49,120
going to be this unique thing it's just
 

10891
03:28:49,120 --> 03:28:51,750
going to be this unique thing it's just
not true it's the same thing you know I

10892
03:28:51,750 --> 03:28:51,760
not true it's the same thing you know I
 

10893
03:28:51,760 --> 03:28:53,550
not true it's the same thing you know I
I think people will realize this about

10894
03:28:53,550 --> 03:28:53,560
I think people will realize this about
 

10895
03:28:53,560 --> 03:28:54,910
I think people will realize this about
the time when people decide that

10896
03:28:54,910 --> 03:28:54,920
the time when people decide that
 

10897
03:28:54,920 --> 03:28:57,349
the time when people decide that
artificial intelligences are kind of

10898
03:28:57,349 --> 03:28:57,359
artificial intelligences are kind of
 

10899
03:28:57,359 --> 03:29:00,110
artificial intelligences are kind of
just natural things that are like human

10900
03:29:00,110 --> 03:29:00,120
just natural things that are like human
 

10901
03:29:00,120 --> 03:29:02,630
just natural things that are like human
intelligences they'll realize that that

10902
03:29:02,630 --> 03:29:02,640
intelligences they'll realize that that
 

10903
03:29:02,640 --> 03:29:05,269
intelligences they'll realize that that
extraterrestrial intelligences or

10904
03:29:05,269 --> 03:29:05,279
extraterrestrial intelligences or
 

10905
03:29:05,279 --> 03:29:07,269
extraterrestrial intelligences or
intelligences associated with physical

10906
03:29:07,269 --> 03:29:07,279
intelligences associated with physical
 

10907
03:29:07,279 --> 03:29:09,389
intelligences associated with physical
systems and so on it's all the same kind

10908
03:29:09,389 --> 03:29:09,399
systems and so on it's all the same kind
 

10909
03:29:09,399 --> 03:29:11,550
systems and so on it's all the same kind
of thing ultimately computation it's all

10910
03:29:11,550 --> 03:29:11,560
of thing ultimately computation it's all
 

10911
03:29:11,560 --> 03:29:13,389
of thing ultimately computation it's all
the same it's all just computation and

10912
03:29:13,389 --> 03:29:13,399
the same it's all just computation and
 

10913
03:29:13,399 --> 03:29:16,469
the same it's all just computation and
the issue is can you are you sort of

10914
03:29:16,469 --> 03:29:16,479
the issue is can you are you sort of
 

10915
03:29:16,479 --> 03:29:18,590
the issue is can you are you sort of
inside it are you are you thinking about

10916
03:29:18,590 --> 03:29:18,600
inside it are you are you thinking about
 

10917
03:29:18,600 --> 03:29:21,349
inside it are you are you thinking about
it do you have sort of a story you're

10918
03:29:21,349 --> 03:29:21,359
it do you have sort of a story you're
 

10919
03:29:21,359 --> 03:29:23,830
it do you have sort of a story you're
telling yourself about it and you know

10920
03:29:23,830 --> 03:29:23,840
telling yourself about it and you know
 

10921
03:29:23,840 --> 03:29:25,309
telling yourself about it and you know
the weather could have a story it's

10922
03:29:25,309 --> 03:29:25,319
the weather could have a story it's
 

10923
03:29:25,319 --> 03:29:27,750
the weather could have a story it's
telling itself about what it's doing we

10924
03:29:27,750 --> 03:29:27,760
telling itself about what it's doing we
 

10925
03:29:27,760 --> 03:29:30,349
telling itself about what it's doing we
just it's utterly incoherent with the

10926
03:29:30,349 --> 03:29:30,359
just it's utterly incoherent with the
 

10927
03:29:30,359 --> 03:29:32,429
just it's utterly incoherent with the
stories that we tell ourselves based on

10928
03:29:32,429 --> 03:29:32,439
stories that we tell ourselves based on
 

10929
03:29:32,439 --> 03:29:34,510
stories that we tell ourselves based on
how our brains work I mean ultimately it

10930
03:29:34,510 --> 03:29:34,520
how our brains work I mean ultimately it
 

10931
03:29:34,520 --> 03:29:38,349
how our brains work I mean ultimately it
must be a a question whether we can

10932
03:29:38,349 --> 03:29:38,359
must be a a question whether we can
 

10933
03:29:38,359 --> 03:29:42,110
must be a a question whether we can
align exactly Aline with the kind of

10934
03:29:42,110 --> 03:29:42,120
align exactly Aline with the kind of
 

10935
03:29:42,120 --> 03:29:44,309
align exactly Aline with the kind of
intelligence systematic way of doing it

10936
03:29:44,309 --> 03:29:44,319
intelligence systematic way of doing it
 

10937
03:29:44,319 --> 03:29:45,550
intelligence systematic way of doing it
right so the question is in the space of

10938
03:29:45,550 --> 03:29:45,560
right so the question is in the space of
 

10939
03:29:45,560 --> 03:29:48,189
right so the question is in the space of
all possible intelligences what's the

10940
03:29:48,189 --> 03:29:48,199
all possible intelligences what's the
 

10941
03:29:48,199 --> 03:29:50,429
all possible intelligences what's the
how do you think about the distance

10942
03:29:50,429 --> 03:29:50,439
how do you think about the distance
 

10943
03:29:50,439 --> 03:29:53,030
how do you think about the distance
between description languages for one

10944
03:29:53,030 --> 03:29:53,040
between description languages for one
 

10945
03:29:53,040 --> 03:29:55,189
between description languages for one
intelligence versus another and needless

10946
03:29:55,189 --> 03:29:55,199
intelligence versus another and needless
 

10947
03:29:55,199 --> 03:29:58,189
intelligence versus another and needless
to say I have thought about this and uh

10948
03:29:58,189 --> 03:29:58,199
to say I have thought about this and uh
 

10949
03:29:58,199 --> 03:29:59,990
to say I have thought about this and uh
um you know I I don't I don't have a

10950
03:29:59,990 --> 03:30:00,000
um you know I I don't I don't have a
 

10951
03:30:00,000 --> 03:30:01,870
um you know I I don't I don't have a
great answer yet but but I think that's

10952
03:30:01,870 --> 03:30:01,880
great answer yet but but I think that's
 

10953
03:30:01,880 --> 03:30:03,469
great answer yet but but I think that's
a that's a thing where there will be

10954
03:30:03,469 --> 03:30:03,479
a that's a thing where there will be
 

10955
03:30:03,479 --> 03:30:04,790
a that's a thing where there will be
things that can be said and there'll be

10956
03:30:04,790 --> 03:30:04,800
things that can be said and there'll be
 

10957
03:30:04,800 --> 03:30:06,349
things that can be said and there'll be
things that where you can sort of start

10958
03:30:06,349 --> 03:30:06,359
things that where you can sort of start
 

10959
03:30:06,359 --> 03:30:09,070
things that where you can sort of start
to characterize you know what is the

10960
03:30:09,070 --> 03:30:09,080
to characterize you know what is the
 

10961
03:30:09,080 --> 03:30:13,030
to characterize you know what is the
translation distance between this you

10962
03:30:13,030 --> 03:30:13,040
translation distance between this you
 

10963
03:30:13,040 --> 03:30:16,150
translation distance between this you
know version of the universe or this you

10964
03:30:16,150 --> 03:30:16,160
know version of the universe or this you
 

10965
03:30:16,160 --> 03:30:17,710
know version of the universe or this you
know kind of set of computational rules

10966
03:30:17,710 --> 03:30:17,720
know kind of set of computational rules
 

10967
03:30:17,720 --> 03:30:20,229
know kind of set of computational rules
in this other one in fact okay so this

10968
03:30:20,229 --> 03:30:20,239
in this other one in fact okay so this
 

10969
03:30:20,239 --> 03:30:22,189
in this other one in fact okay so this
is a you know there's this idea of

10970
03:30:22,189 --> 03:30:22,199
is a you know there's this idea of
 

10971
03:30:22,199 --> 03:30:23,710
is a you know there's this idea of
algorithmic information Theory there's

10972
03:30:23,710 --> 03:30:23,720
algorithmic information Theory there's
 

10973
03:30:23,720 --> 03:30:25,990
algorithmic information Theory there's
this question of sort of what is the uh

10974
03:30:25,990 --> 03:30:26,000
this question of sort of what is the uh
 

10975
03:30:26,000 --> 03:30:28,990
this question of sort of what is the uh
when you have some something what is the

10976
03:30:28,990 --> 03:30:29,000
when you have some something what is the
 

10977
03:30:29,000 --> 03:30:30,510
when you have some something what is the
sort of shortest description you can

10978
03:30:30,510 --> 03:30:30,520
sort of shortest description you can
 

10979
03:30:30,520 --> 03:30:32,630
sort of shortest description you can
make of it where that description could

10980
03:30:32,630 --> 03:30:32,640
make of it where that description could
 

10981
03:30:32,640 --> 03:30:34,830
make of it where that description could
be saying run this program to get the

10982
03:30:34,830 --> 03:30:34,840
be saying run this program to get the
 

10983
03:30:34,840 --> 03:30:40,229
be saying run this program to get the
thing right so I'm pretty sure that that

10984
03:30:40,229 --> 03:30:40,239
thing right so I'm pretty sure that that
 

10985
03:30:40,239 --> 03:30:42,830
thing right so I'm pretty sure that that
the um uh

10986
03:30:42,830 --> 03:30:42,840
the um uh
 

10987
03:30:42,840 --> 03:30:45,309
the um uh
that there will be a physicalization of

10988
03:30:45,309 --> 03:30:45,319
that there will be a physicalization of
 

10989
03:30:45,319 --> 03:30:49,750
that there will be a physicalization of
the idea of GIC information and that

10990
03:30:49,750 --> 03:30:49,760
the idea of GIC information and that
 

10991
03:30:49,760 --> 03:30:51,590
the idea of GIC information and that
okay this is again a little bit bizarre

10992
03:30:51,590 --> 03:30:51,600
okay this is again a little bit bizarre
 

10993
03:30:51,600 --> 03:30:53,710
okay this is again a little bit bizarre
but so I mentioned that there's the

10994
03:30:53,710 --> 03:30:53,720
but so I mentioned that there's the
 

10995
03:30:53,720 --> 03:30:55,150
but so I mentioned that there's the
speed of light maximum speed of

10996
03:30:55,150 --> 03:30:55,160
speed of light maximum speed of
 

10997
03:30:55,160 --> 03:30:56,590
speed of light maximum speed of
information Transmission in physical

10998
03:30:56,590 --> 03:30:56,600
information Transmission in physical
 

10999
03:30:56,600 --> 03:30:58,790
information Transmission in physical
space there's a maximum speed of

11000
03:30:58,790 --> 03:30:58,800
space there's a maximum speed of
 

11001
03:30:58,800 --> 03:31:00,469
space there's a maximum speed of
information Transmission in branchial

11002
03:31:00,469 --> 03:31:00,479
information Transmission in branchial
 

11003
03:31:00,479 --> 03:31:02,110
information Transmission in branchial
space which is a maximum entanglement

11004
03:31:02,110 --> 03:31:02,120
space which is a maximum entanglement
 

11005
03:31:02,120 --> 03:31:04,189
space which is a maximum entanglement
speed there's a maximum speed of

11006
03:31:04,189 --> 03:31:04,199
speed there's a maximum speed of
 

11007
03:31:04,199 --> 03:31:06,790
speed there's a maximum speed of
information Transmission in roual space

11008
03:31:06,790 --> 03:31:06,800
information Transmission in roual space
 

11009
03:31:06,800 --> 03:31:09,030
information Transmission in roual space
which is has to do with a maximum speed

11010
03:31:09,030 --> 03:31:09,040
which is has to do with a maximum speed
 

11011
03:31:09,040 --> 03:31:12,950
which is has to do with a maximum speed
of translation between different uh

11012
03:31:12,950 --> 03:31:12,960
of translation between different uh
 

11013
03:31:12,960 --> 03:31:15,309
of translation between different uh
description languages and again I'm I'm

11014
03:31:15,309 --> 03:31:15,319
description languages and again I'm I'm
 

11015
03:31:15,319 --> 03:31:17,189
description languages and again I'm I'm
not fully wrapped my brain around this

11016
03:31:17,189 --> 03:31:17,199
not fully wrapped my brain around this
 

11017
03:31:17,199 --> 03:31:19,429
not fully wrapped my brain around this
one yeah that one just blows my mind to

11018
03:31:19,429 --> 03:31:19,439
one yeah that one just blows my mind to
 

11019
03:31:19,439 --> 03:31:20,990
one yeah that one just blows my mind to
think about that but that starts getting

11020
03:31:20,990 --> 03:31:21,000
think about that but that starts getting
 

11021
03:31:21,000 --> 03:31:24,389
think about that but that starts getting
closer to the yeah the kind of

11022
03:31:24,389 --> 03:31:24,399
closer to the yeah the kind of
 

11023
03:31:24,399 --> 03:31:26,550
closer to the yeah the kind of
physicalization right it's a and it's

11024
03:31:26,550 --> 03:31:26,560
physicalization right it's a and it's
 

11025
03:31:26,560 --> 03:31:29,269
physicalization right it's a and it's
also a physicalization of of algorithmic

11026
03:31:29,269 --> 03:31:29,279
also a physicalization of of algorithmic
 

11027
03:31:29,279 --> 03:31:30,790
also a physicalization of of algorithmic
information and I think there's probably

11028
03:31:30,790 --> 03:31:30,800
information and I think there's probably
 

11029
03:31:30,800 --> 03:31:32,710
information and I think there's probably
a connection between I mean there's

11030
03:31:32,710 --> 03:31:32,720
a connection between I mean there's
 

11031
03:31:32,720 --> 03:31:34,189
a connection between I mean there's
probably a connection between the notion

11032
03:31:34,189 --> 03:31:34,199
probably a connection between the notion
 

11033
03:31:34,199 --> 03:31:36,790
probably a connection between the notion
of energy and some of these things which

11034
03:31:36,790 --> 03:31:36,800
of energy and some of these things which
 

11035
03:31:36,800 --> 03:31:39,030
of energy and some of these things which
again I I you know hadn't seen all this

11036
03:31:39,030 --> 03:31:39,040
again I I you know hadn't seen all this
 

11037
03:31:39,040 --> 03:31:40,469
again I I you know hadn't seen all this
coming I i' I've always been a little

11038
03:31:40,469 --> 03:31:40,479
coming I i' I've always been a little
 

11039
03:31:40,479 --> 03:31:42,269
coming I i' I've always been a little
bit resistant to the idea of connecting

11040
03:31:42,269 --> 03:31:42,279
bit resistant to the idea of connecting
 

11041
03:31:42,279 --> 03:31:44,790
bit resistant to the idea of connecting
physical energy to things in in in

11042
03:31:44,790 --> 03:31:44,800
physical energy to things in in in
 

11043
03:31:44,800 --> 03:31:46,349
physical energy to things in in in
computation Theory but I I think that's

11044
03:31:46,349 --> 03:31:46,359
computation Theory but I I think that's
 

11045
03:31:46,359 --> 03:31:47,630
computation Theory but I I think that's
probably coming and that's what

11046
03:31:47,630 --> 03:31:47,640
probably coming and that's what
 

11047
03:31:47,640 --> 03:31:49,309
probably coming and that's what
essentially at the core with the the

11048
03:31:49,309 --> 03:31:49,319
essentially at the core with the the
 

11049
03:31:49,319 --> 03:31:52,189
essentially at the core with the the
physics project is that you're

11050
03:31:52,189 --> 03:31:52,199
physics project is that you're
 

11051
03:31:52,199 --> 03:31:55,070
physics project is that you're
connecting information Theory with well

11052
03:31:55,070 --> 03:31:55,080
connecting information Theory with well
 

11053
03:31:55,080 --> 03:31:57,110
connecting information Theory with well
physics yeah it's computation in

11054
03:31:57,110 --> 03:31:57,120
physics yeah it's computation in
 

11055
03:31:57,120 --> 03:31:59,670
physics yeah it's computation in
computation with our physical Universe

11056
03:31:59,670 --> 03:31:59,680
computation with our physical Universe
 

11057
03:31:59,680 --> 03:32:01,110
computation with our physical Universe
yeah right I mean the fact that our

11058
03:32:01,110 --> 03:32:01,120
yeah right I mean the fact that our
 

11059
03:32:01,120 --> 03:32:03,910
yeah right I mean the fact that our
physical universe is is right that we

11060
03:32:03,910 --> 03:32:03,920
physical universe is is right that we
 

11061
03:32:03,920 --> 03:32:05,870
physical universe is is right that we
can think of it as a computation and

11062
03:32:05,870 --> 03:32:05,880
can think of it as a computation and
 

11063
03:32:05,880 --> 03:32:08,229
can think of it as a computation and
that we can have discussions like you

11064
03:32:08,229 --> 03:32:08,239
that we can have discussions like you
 

11065
03:32:08,239 --> 03:32:11,070
that we can have discussions like you
know the theory of the physical universe

11066
03:32:11,070 --> 03:32:11,080
know the theory of the physical universe
 

11067
03:32:11,080 --> 03:32:13,469
know the theory of the physical universe
is the same kind of a theory as the P

11068
03:32:13,469 --> 03:32:13,479
is the same kind of a theory as the P
 

11069
03:32:13,479 --> 03:32:16,670
is the same kind of a theory as the P
versus MP problem and so on is is really

11070
03:32:16,670 --> 03:32:16,680
versus MP problem and so on is is really
 

11071
03:32:16,680 --> 03:32:18,070
versus MP problem and so on is is really
uh you know I think that's really

11072
03:32:18,070 --> 03:32:18,080
uh you know I think that's really
 

11073
03:32:18,080 --> 03:32:21,070
uh you know I think that's really
interesting and and the fact that well

11074
03:32:21,070 --> 03:32:21,080
interesting and and the fact that well
 

11075
03:32:21,080 --> 03:32:22,950
interesting and and the fact that well
uh okay so this this kind of brings me

11076
03:32:22,950 --> 03:32:22,960
uh okay so this this kind of brings me
 

11077
03:32:22,960 --> 03:32:24,750
uh okay so this this kind of brings me
to one one more thing that I have to in

11078
03:32:24,750 --> 03:32:24,760
to one one more thing that I have to in
 

11079
03:32:24,760 --> 03:32:26,670
to one one more thing that I have to in
terms of this sort of unification of

11080
03:32:26,670 --> 03:32:26,680
terms of this sort of unification of
 

11081
03:32:26,680 --> 03:32:28,630
terms of this sort of unification of
different ideas which is meta

11082
03:32:28,630 --> 03:32:28,640
different ideas which is meta
 

11083
03:32:28,640 --> 03:32:30,469
different ideas which is meta
mathematics yeah let's talk about that

11084
03:32:30,469 --> 03:32:30,479
mathematics yeah let's talk about that
 

11085
03:32:30,479 --> 03:32:32,269
mathematics yeah let's talk about that
you mentioned that earlier what the heck

11086
03:32:32,269 --> 03:32:32,279
you mentioned that earlier what the heck
 

11087
03:32:32,279 --> 03:32:35,429
you mentioned that earlier what the heck
is M mathematics and uh okay so here's

11088
03:32:35,429 --> 03:32:35,439
is M mathematics and uh okay so here's
 

11089
03:32:35,439 --> 03:32:37,910
is M mathematics and uh okay so here's
here's what here's okay so what is

11090
03:32:37,910 --> 03:32:37,920
here's what here's okay so what is
 

11091
03:32:37,920 --> 03:32:39,469
here's what here's okay so what is
mathematics

11092
03:32:39,469 --> 03:32:39,479
mathematics
 

11093
03:32:39,479 --> 03:32:43,110
mathematics
mathematics uh sort of at a a lowest

11094
03:32:43,110 --> 03:32:43,120
mathematics uh sort of at a a lowest
 

11095
03:32:43,120 --> 03:32:45,510
mathematics uh sort of at a a lowest
level one thinks of mathematics as you

11096
03:32:45,510 --> 03:32:45,520
level one thinks of mathematics as you
 

11097
03:32:45,520 --> 03:32:48,510
level one thinks of mathematics as you
have certain axioms you say you know you

11098
03:32:48,510 --> 03:32:48,520
have certain axioms you say you know you
 

11099
03:32:48,520 --> 03:32:51,590
have certain axioms you say you know you
say things like x + y is the same as y +

11100
03:32:51,590 --> 03:32:51,600
say things like x + y is the same as y +
 

11101
03:32:51,600 --> 03:32:55,389
say things like x + y is the same as y +
x that's an axom um about addition and

11102
03:32:55,389 --> 03:32:55,399
x that's an axom um about addition and
 

11103
03:32:55,399 --> 03:32:57,910
x that's an axom um about addition and
then you say we got these axioms and we

11104
03:32:57,910 --> 03:32:57,920
then you say we got these axioms and we
 

11105
03:32:57,920 --> 03:32:59,870
then you say we got these axioms and we
and and from these axioms we derive all

11106
03:32:59,870 --> 03:32:59,880
and and from these axioms we derive all
 

11107
03:32:59,880 --> 03:33:01,229
and and from these axioms we derive all
these theorems that fill up the

11108
03:33:01,229 --> 03:33:01,239
these theorems that fill up the
 

11109
03:33:01,239 --> 03:33:03,070
these theorems that fill up the
literature of mathematics the the the

11110
03:33:03,070 --> 03:33:03,080
literature of mathematics the the the
 

11111
03:33:03,080 --> 03:33:05,389
literature of mathematics the the the
activity of mathematicians is to derive

11112
03:33:05,389 --> 03:33:05,399
activity of mathematicians is to derive
 

11113
03:33:05,399 --> 03:33:07,870
activity of mathematicians is to derive
all these theorems actually the axm of

11114
03:33:07,870 --> 03:33:07,880
all these theorems actually the axm of
 

11115
03:33:07,880 --> 03:33:11,070
all these theorems actually the axm of
mathematics are very small you can fit

11116
03:33:11,070 --> 03:33:11,080
mathematics are very small you can fit
 

11117
03:33:11,080 --> 03:33:12,550
mathematics are very small you can fit
you know when I did my new kind of

11118
03:33:12,550 --> 03:33:12,560
you know when I did my new kind of
 

11119
03:33:12,560 --> 03:33:14,950
you know when I did my new kind of
science book I fit all of the standard

11120
03:33:14,950 --> 03:33:14,960
science book I fit all of the standard
 

11121
03:33:14,960 --> 03:33:16,710
science book I fit all of the standard
axm of mathematics on basically a page

11122
03:33:16,710 --> 03:33:16,720
axm of mathematics on basically a page
 

11123
03:33:16,720 --> 03:33:19,790
axm of mathematics on basically a page
and a half um it's not much stuff it's

11124
03:33:19,790 --> 03:33:19,800
and a half um it's not much stuff it's
 

11125
03:33:19,800 --> 03:33:22,349
and a half um it's not much stuff it's
like a very simple rule from which all

11126
03:33:22,349 --> 03:33:22,359
like a very simple rule from which all
 

11127
03:33:22,359 --> 03:33:25,309
like a very simple rule from which all
of mathematics arises um the way it

11128
03:33:25,309 --> 03:33:25,319
of mathematics arises um the way it
 

11129
03:33:25,319 --> 03:33:26,830
of mathematics arises um the way it
works though is a little different from

11130
03:33:26,830 --> 03:33:26,840
works though is a little different from
 

11131
03:33:26,840 --> 03:33:30,750
works though is a little different from
the way things work in in sort of uh a

11132
03:33:30,750 --> 03:33:30,760
the way things work in in sort of uh a
 

11133
03:33:30,760 --> 03:33:32,710
the way things work in in sort of uh a
computation because in mathematics what

11134
03:33:32,710 --> 03:33:32,720
computation because in mathematics what
 

11135
03:33:32,720 --> 03:33:34,870
computation because in mathematics what
you're interested in is a proof and the

11136
03:33:34,870 --> 03:33:34,880
you're interested in is a proof and the
 

11137
03:33:34,880 --> 03:33:38,510
you're interested in is a proof and the
proof says from here you can use from

11138
03:33:38,510 --> 03:33:38,520
proof says from here you can use from
 

11139
03:33:38,520 --> 03:33:40,950
proof says from here you can use from
this expression for example you can use

11140
03:33:40,950 --> 03:33:40,960
this expression for example you can use
 

11141
03:33:40,960 --> 03:33:42,550
this expression for example you can use
these axioms to get to this other

11142
03:33:42,550 --> 03:33:42,560
these axioms to get to this other
 

11143
03:33:42,560 --> 03:33:44,070
these axioms to get to this other
expression so that proves these two

11144
03:33:44,070 --> 03:33:44,080
expression so that proves these two
 

11145
03:33:44,080 --> 03:33:47,389
expression so that proves these two
things are equal okay so we can we can

11146
03:33:47,389 --> 03:33:47,399
things are equal okay so we can we can
 

11147
03:33:47,399 --> 03:33:49,110
things are equal okay so we can we can
begin to see how this is going to work

11148
03:33:49,110 --> 03:33:49,120
begin to see how this is going to work
 

11149
03:33:49,120 --> 03:33:50,309
begin to see how this is going to work
what what's going to what happen is

11150
03:33:50,309 --> 03:33:50,319
what what's going to what happen is
 

11151
03:33:50,319 --> 03:33:52,469
what what's going to what happen is
there are paths in metam mathematical

11152
03:33:52,469 --> 03:33:52,479
there are paths in metam mathematical
 

11153
03:33:52,479 --> 03:33:56,670
there are paths in metam mathematical
space so what happens is each um two

11154
03:33:56,670 --> 03:33:56,680
space so what happens is each um two
 

11155
03:33:56,680 --> 03:33:57,910
space so what happens is each um two
different ways to look at it you can

11156
03:33:57,910 --> 03:33:57,920
different ways to look at it you can
 

11157
03:33:57,920 --> 03:33:59,389
different ways to look at it you can
just look at it as mathematical

11158
03:33:59,389 --> 03:33:59,399
just look at it as mathematical
 

11159
03:33:59,399 --> 03:34:00,950
just look at it as mathematical
expressions or you can look at it as

11160
03:34:00,950 --> 03:34:00,960
expressions or you can look at it as
 

11161
03:34:00,960 --> 03:34:03,389
expressions or you can look at it as
mathematical statements postulates or

11162
03:34:03,389 --> 03:34:03,399
mathematical statements postulates or
 

11163
03:34:03,399 --> 03:34:05,550
mathematical statements postulates or
something but either way you think of

11164
03:34:05,550 --> 03:34:05,560
something but either way you think of
 

11165
03:34:05,560 --> 03:34:09,070
something but either way you think of
these things and they are connected uh

11166
03:34:09,070 --> 03:34:09,080
these things and they are connected uh
 

11167
03:34:09,080 --> 03:34:12,590
these things and they are connected uh
by these axioms so in other words you

11168
03:34:12,590 --> 03:34:12,600
by these axioms so in other words you
 

11169
03:34:12,600 --> 03:34:15,269
by these axioms so in other words you
have some fact you or you have some

11170
03:34:15,269 --> 03:34:15,279
have some fact you or you have some
 

11171
03:34:15,279 --> 03:34:17,189
have some fact you or you have some
expression you apply this axum you get

11172
03:34:17,189 --> 03:34:17,199
expression you apply this axum you get
 

11173
03:34:17,199 --> 03:34:20,630
expression you apply this axum you get
some other expression and in general

11174
03:34:20,630 --> 03:34:20,640
some other expression and in general
 

11175
03:34:20,640 --> 03:34:22,389
some other expression and in general
given some expression there may be many

11176
03:34:22,389 --> 03:34:22,399
given some expression there may be many
 

11177
03:34:22,399 --> 03:34:24,229
given some expression there may be many
possible different Expressions you can

11178
03:34:24,229 --> 03:34:24,239
possible different Expressions you can
 

11179
03:34:24,239 --> 03:34:26,429
possible different Expressions you can
get you basically build up a multi-way

11180
03:34:26,429 --> 03:34:26,439
get you basically build up a multi-way
 

11181
03:34:26,439 --> 03:34:30,229
get you basically build up a multi-way
graph and a proof is a path through the

11182
03:34:30,229 --> 03:34:30,239
graph and a proof is a path through the
 

11183
03:34:30,239 --> 03:34:32,870
graph and a proof is a path through the
multi-way graph that goes from one thing

11184
03:34:32,870 --> 03:34:32,880
multi-way graph that goes from one thing
 

11185
03:34:32,880 --> 03:34:35,710
multi-way graph that goes from one thing
to another thing it the path tells you

11186
03:34:35,710 --> 03:34:35,720
to another thing it the path tells you
 

11187
03:34:35,720 --> 03:34:37,150
to another thing it the path tells you
how did you get from one thing to the

11188
03:34:37,150 --> 03:34:37,160
how did you get from one thing to the
 

11189
03:34:37,160 --> 03:34:39,110
how did you get from one thing to the
other thing it's the it's the story of

11190
03:34:39,110 --> 03:34:39,120
other thing it's the it's the story of
 

11191
03:34:39,120 --> 03:34:40,830
other thing it's the it's the story of
how you got from this to that the

11192
03:34:40,830 --> 03:34:40,840
how you got from this to that the
 

11193
03:34:40,840 --> 03:34:43,189
how you got from this to that the
theorem is the thing at one end is equal

11194
03:34:43,189 --> 03:34:43,199
theorem is the thing at one end is equal
 

11195
03:34:43,199 --> 03:34:45,229
theorem is the thing at one end is equal
to the thing at the other end the proof

11196
03:34:45,229 --> 03:34:45,239
to the thing at the other end the proof
 

11197
03:34:45,239 --> 03:34:47,670
to the thing at the other end the proof
is the path you go down to get from one

11198
03:34:47,670 --> 03:34:47,680
is the path you go down to get from one
 

11199
03:34:47,680 --> 03:34:49,389
is the path you go down to get from one
thing to the other you mentioned that

11200
03:34:49,389 --> 03:34:49,399
thing to the other you mentioned that
 

11201
03:34:49,399 --> 03:34:52,590
thing to the other you mentioned that
G's incompetance theem is not natural it

11202
03:34:52,590 --> 03:34:52,600
G's incompetance theem is not natural it
 

11203
03:34:52,600 --> 03:34:54,670
G's incompetance theem is not natural it
fits naturally there how hard is yeah so

11204
03:34:54,670 --> 03:34:54,680
fits naturally there how hard is yeah so
 

11205
03:34:54,680 --> 03:34:56,429
fits naturally there how hard is yeah so
so what happens there is that the

11206
03:34:56,429 --> 03:34:56,439
so what happens there is that the
 

11207
03:34:56,439 --> 03:34:58,630
so what happens there is that the
girdles theorem is basically saying that

11208
03:34:58,630 --> 03:34:58,640
girdles theorem is basically saying that
 

11209
03:34:58,640 --> 03:35:01,429
girdles theorem is basically saying that
there are pods of infinite length that

11210
03:35:01,429 --> 03:35:01,439
there are pods of infinite length that
 

11211
03:35:01,439 --> 03:35:03,309
there are pods of infinite length that
is that there's no upper bound if you

11212
03:35:03,309 --> 03:35:03,319
is that there's no upper bound if you
 

11213
03:35:03,319 --> 03:35:04,670
is that there's no upper bound if you
know these two things you say I'm trying

11214
03:35:04,670 --> 03:35:04,680
know these two things you say I'm trying
 

11215
03:35:04,680 --> 03:35:06,790
know these two things you say I'm trying
to get from here to here how long do I

11216
03:35:06,790 --> 03:35:06,800
to get from here to here how long do I
 

11217
03:35:06,800 --> 03:35:09,429
to get from here to here how long do I
have to go you say well I've looked at

11218
03:35:09,429 --> 03:35:09,439
have to go you say well I've looked at
 

11219
03:35:09,439 --> 03:35:11,429
have to go you say well I've looked at
all the paths of length 10 somebody says

11220
03:35:11,429 --> 03:35:11,439
all the paths of length 10 somebody says
 

11221
03:35:11,439 --> 03:35:13,269
all the paths of length 10 somebody says
that's not good enough that path might

11222
03:35:13,269 --> 03:35:13,279
that's not good enough that path might
 

11223
03:35:13,279 --> 03:35:15,269
that's not good enough that path might
be of length a billion and and you

11224
03:35:15,269 --> 03:35:15,279
be of length a billion and and you
 

11225
03:35:15,279 --> 03:35:16,950
be of length a billion and and you
there's no up bound on how long that

11226
03:35:16,950 --> 03:35:16,960
there's no up bound on how long that
 

11227
03:35:16,960 --> 03:35:18,389
there's no up bound on how long that
path is and that's that's what leads to

11228
03:35:18,389 --> 03:35:18,399
path is and that's that's what leads to
 

11229
03:35:18,399 --> 03:35:20,670
path is and that's that's what leads to
the incompleteness theorem so I mean the

11230
03:35:20,670 --> 03:35:20,680
the incompleteness theorem so I mean the
 

11231
03:35:20,680 --> 03:35:23,830
the incompleteness theorem so I mean the
the thing that is kind of an emerging

11232
03:35:23,830 --> 03:35:23,840
the thing that is kind of an emerging
 

11233
03:35:23,840 --> 03:35:26,429
the thing that is kind of an emerging
idea is you can start asking what's the

11234
03:35:26,429 --> 03:35:26,439
idea is you can start asking what's the
 

11235
03:35:26,439 --> 03:35:28,150
idea is you can start asking what's the
analog of Einstein's equations in metam

11236
03:35:28,150 --> 03:35:28,160
analog of Einstein's equations in metam
 

11237
03:35:28,160 --> 03:35:30,429
analog of Einstein's equations in metam
mathematical space what's the analog of

11238
03:35:30,429 --> 03:35:30,439
mathematical space what's the analog of
 

11239
03:35:30,439 --> 03:35:33,189
mathematical space what's the analog of
a black hole in metam mathematical space

11240
03:35:33,189 --> 03:35:33,199
a black hole in metam mathematical space
 

11241
03:35:33,199 --> 03:35:35,070
a black hole in metam mathematical space
what's the whole so yeah it's

11242
03:35:35,070 --> 03:35:35,080
what's the whole so yeah it's
 

11243
03:35:35,080 --> 03:35:36,710
what's the whole so yeah it's
fascinating to model all the mathematics

11244
03:35:36,710 --> 03:35:36,720
fascinating to model all the mathematics
 

11245
03:35:36,720 --> 03:35:38,110
fascinating to model all the mathematics
in this well so so here's here's what it

11246
03:35:38,110 --> 03:35:38,120
in this well so so here's here's what it
 

11247
03:35:38,120 --> 03:35:41,150
in this well so so here's here's what it
is this is mathematics in bulk so human

11248
03:35:41,150 --> 03:35:41,160
is this is mathematics in bulk so human
 

11249
03:35:41,160 --> 03:35:43,229
is this is mathematics in bulk so human
mathematicians have made a few million

11250
03:35:43,229 --> 03:35:43,239
mathematicians have made a few million
 

11251
03:35:43,239 --> 03:35:45,030
mathematicians have made a few million
theorems they published a few million

11252
03:35:45,030 --> 03:35:45,040
theorems they published a few million
 

11253
03:35:45,040 --> 03:35:47,670
theorems they published a few million
theorems but imagine the infinite future

11254
03:35:47,670 --> 03:35:47,680
theorems but imagine the infinite future
 

11255
03:35:47,680 --> 03:35:49,429
theorems but imagine the infinite future
of mathematics apply something to

11256
03:35:49,429 --> 03:35:49,439
of mathematics apply something to
 

11257
03:35:49,439 --> 03:35:51,469
of mathematics apply something to
mathematics that mathematics likes to

11258
03:35:51,469 --> 03:35:51,479
mathematics that mathematics likes to
 

11259
03:35:51,479 --> 03:35:53,670
mathematics that mathematics likes to
apply to other things take a limit what

11260
03:35:53,670 --> 03:35:53,680
apply to other things take a limit what
 

11261
03:35:53,680 --> 03:35:55,750
apply to other things take a limit what
is the limit of the infinite future of

11262
03:35:55,750 --> 03:35:55,760
is the limit of the infinite future of
 

11263
03:35:55,760 --> 03:35:57,630
is the limit of the infinite future of
mathematics what does it look like what

11264
03:35:57,630 --> 03:35:57,640
mathematics what does it look like what
 

11265
03:35:57,640 --> 03:35:59,590
mathematics what does it look like what
is the Continuum limit of mathematics

11266
03:35:59,590 --> 03:35:59,600
is the Continuum limit of mathematics
 

11267
03:35:59,600 --> 03:36:01,790
is the Continuum limit of mathematics
what is the as you just fill in more and

11268
03:36:01,790 --> 03:36:01,800
what is the as you just fill in more and
 

11269
03:36:01,800 --> 03:36:03,830
what is the as you just fill in more and
more and more theorems what does it look

11270
03:36:03,830 --> 03:36:03,840
more and more theorems what does it look
 

11271
03:36:03,840 --> 03:36:05,990
more and more theorems what does it look
like what does it do how does what kinds

11272
03:36:05,990 --> 03:36:06,000
like what does it do how does what kinds
 

11273
03:36:06,000 --> 03:36:07,870
like what does it do how does what kinds
of conclusions can you make so for

11274
03:36:07,870 --> 03:36:07,880
of conclusions can you make so for
 

11275
03:36:07,880 --> 03:36:09,750
of conclusions can you make so for
example one thing I've just been doing

11276
03:36:09,750 --> 03:36:09,760
example one thing I've just been doing
 

11277
03:36:09,760 --> 03:36:12,710
example one thing I've just been doing
is taking uid so uclid very impressive

11278
03:36:12,710 --> 03:36:12,720
is taking uid so uclid very impressive
 

11279
03:36:12,720 --> 03:36:16,830
is taking uid so uclid very impressive
he had 10 axioms he derived 465 theorems

11280
03:36:16,830 --> 03:36:16,840
he had 10 axioms he derived 465 theorems
 

11281
03:36:16,840 --> 03:36:20,309
he had 10 axioms he derived 465 theorems
okay his book you know that was was the

11282
03:36:20,309 --> 03:36:20,319
okay his book you know that was was the
 

11283
03:36:20,319 --> 03:36:22,030
okay his book you know that was was the
sort of defining book of mathematics for

11284
03:36:22,030 --> 03:36:22,040
sort of defining book of mathematics for
 

11285
03:36:22,040 --> 03:36:25,349
sort of defining book of mathematics for
2,000 years um so you can actually map

11286
03:36:25,349 --> 03:36:25,359
2,000 years um so you can actually map
 

11287
03:36:25,359 --> 03:36:28,269
2,000 years um so you can actually map
out and I I I I actually did this 20

11288
03:36:28,269 --> 03:36:28,279
out and I I I I actually did this 20
 

11289
03:36:28,279 --> 03:36:29,630
out and I I I I actually did this 20
years ago but I've done it more

11290
03:36:29,630 --> 03:36:29,640
years ago but I've done it more
 

11291
03:36:29,640 --> 03:36:31,670
years ago but I've done it more
seriously now you can map out the

11292
03:36:31,670 --> 03:36:31,680
seriously now you can map out the
 

11293
03:36:31,680 --> 03:36:34,750
seriously now you can map out the
theorem dependency of those 465 theorems

11294
03:36:34,750 --> 03:36:34,760
theorem dependency of those 465 theorems
 

11295
03:36:34,760 --> 03:36:37,429
theorem dependency of those 465 theorems
so from the axioms you grow this graph

11296
03:36:37,429 --> 03:36:37,439
so from the axioms you grow this graph
 

11297
03:36:37,439 --> 03:36:39,590
so from the axioms you grow this graph
it's actually a multi-way graph of how

11298
03:36:39,590 --> 03:36:39,600
it's actually a multi-way graph of how
 

11299
03:36:39,600 --> 03:36:41,389
it's actually a multi-way graph of how
all these theorems get proved from other

11300
03:36:41,389 --> 03:36:41,399
all these theorems get proved from other
 

11301
03:36:41,399 --> 03:36:43,670
all these theorems get proved from other
theorems and so you can ask questions

11302
03:36:43,670 --> 03:36:43,680
theorems and so you can ask questions
 

11303
03:36:43,680 --> 03:36:45,910
theorems and so you can ask questions
about you know well you can ask things

11304
03:36:45,910 --> 03:36:45,920
about you know well you can ask things
 

11305
03:36:45,920 --> 03:36:47,550
about you know well you can ask things
like what's the hardest theorem in ukle

11306
03:36:47,550 --> 03:36:47,560
like what's the hardest theorem in ukle
 

11307
03:36:47,560 --> 03:36:48,910
like what's the hardest theorem in ukle
the answer is the hardest theorem is

11308
03:36:48,910 --> 03:36:48,920
the answer is the hardest theorem is
 

11309
03:36:48,920 --> 03:36:51,030
the answer is the hardest theorem is
that there are five plutonic solids that

11310
03:36:51,030 --> 03:36:51,040
that there are five plutonic solids that
 

11311
03:36:51,040 --> 03:36:52,429
that there are five plutonic solids that
turns out to be the hardest theorem in

11312
03:36:52,429 --> 03:36:52,439
turns out to be the hardest theorem in
 

11313
03:36:52,439 --> 03:36:54,309
turns out to be the hardest theorem in
ucle that's actually his his Last

11314
03:36:54,309 --> 03:36:54,319
ucle that's actually his his Last
 

11315
03:36:54,319 --> 03:36:55,630
ucle that's actually his his Last
Theorem in all his books that's the

11316
03:36:55,630 --> 03:36:55,640
Theorem in all his books that's the
 

11317
03:36:55,640 --> 03:36:57,229
Theorem in all his books that's the
final what's the hardness the the

11318
03:36:57,229 --> 03:36:57,239
final what's the hardness the the
 

11319
03:36:57,239 --> 03:36:59,030
final what's the hardness the the
distance you have to travel yeah that's

11320
03:36:59,030 --> 03:36:59,040
distance you have to travel yeah that's
 

11321
03:36:59,040 --> 03:37:02,070
distance you have to travel yeah that's
it's 33 Steps From the the longest path

11322
03:37:02,070 --> 03:37:02,080
it's 33 Steps From the the longest path
 

11323
03:37:02,080 --> 03:37:04,710
it's 33 Steps From the the longest path
in the graph is 33 steps so that's the

11324
03:37:04,710 --> 03:37:04,720
in the graph is 33 steps so that's the
 

11325
03:37:04,720 --> 03:37:07,030
in the graph is 33 steps so that's the
there there's a 33 step path you have to

11326
03:37:07,030 --> 03:37:07,040
there there's a 33 step path you have to
 

11327
03:37:07,040 --> 03:37:09,309
there there's a 33 step path you have to
follow to go from the axioms according

11328
03:37:09,309 --> 03:37:09,319
follow to go from the axioms according
 

11329
03:37:09,319 --> 03:37:11,590
follow to go from the axioms according
to ukids proofs to the statement there

11330
03:37:11,590 --> 03:37:11,600
to ukids proofs to the statement there
 

11331
03:37:11,600 --> 03:37:14,710
to ukids proofs to the statement there
are five platonic solids so so okay so

11332
03:37:14,710 --> 03:37:14,720
are five platonic solids so so okay so
 

11333
03:37:14,720 --> 03:37:18,790
are five platonic solids so so okay so
then then then the the question is in uh

11334
03:37:18,790 --> 03:37:18,800
then then then the the question is in uh
 

11335
03:37:18,800 --> 03:37:19,830
then then then the the question is in uh
what does it

11336
03:37:19,830 --> 03:37:19,840
what does it
 

11337
03:37:19,840 --> 03:37:24,070
what does it
mean if you have this map okay so in a

11338
03:37:24,070 --> 03:37:24,080
mean if you have this map okay so in a
 

11339
03:37:24,080 --> 03:37:26,510
mean if you have this map okay so in a
sense this meta mathematical space is

11340
03:37:26,510 --> 03:37:26,520
sense this meta mathematical space is
 

11341
03:37:26,520 --> 03:37:28,389
sense this meta mathematical space is
the infrastructural space of all

11342
03:37:28,389 --> 03:37:28,399
the infrastructural space of all
 

11343
03:37:28,399 --> 03:37:29,870
the infrastructural space of all
possible theorems that you could prove

11344
03:37:29,870 --> 03:37:29,880
possible theorems that you could prove
 

11345
03:37:29,880 --> 03:37:33,389
possible theorems that you could prove
in mathematics MH that's the geometry of

11346
03:37:33,389 --> 03:37:33,399
in mathematics MH that's the geometry of
 

11347
03:37:33,399 --> 03:37:35,269
in mathematics MH that's the geometry of
meta mathematics there's also the

11348
03:37:35,269 --> 03:37:35,279
meta mathematics there's also the
 

11349
03:37:35,279 --> 03:37:37,590
meta mathematics there's also the
geography of mathematics that is where

11350
03:37:37,590 --> 03:37:37,600
geography of mathematics that is where
 

11351
03:37:37,600 --> 03:37:40,710
geography of mathematics that is where
did people choose to live right in space

11352
03:37:40,710 --> 03:37:40,720
did people choose to live right in space
 

11353
03:37:40,720 --> 03:37:42,710
did people choose to live right in space
and that's what for example exploring

11354
03:37:42,710 --> 03:37:42,720
and that's what for example exploring
 

11355
03:37:42,720 --> 03:37:44,229
and that's what for example exploring
the sort of empirical metam mathematics

11356
03:37:44,229 --> 03:37:44,239
the sort of empirical metam mathematics
 

11357
03:37:44,239 --> 03:37:46,830
the sort of empirical metam mathematics
of ID is doing each individual like

11358
03:37:46,830 --> 03:37:46,840
of ID is doing each individual like
 

11359
03:37:46,840 --> 03:37:49,070
of ID is doing each individual like
human mathematician you can embed them

11360
03:37:49,070 --> 03:37:49,080
human mathematician you can embed them
 

11361
03:37:49,080 --> 03:37:51,070
human mathematician you can embed them
into that space I mean they they kind

11362
03:37:51,070 --> 03:37:51,080
into that space I mean they they kind
 

11363
03:37:51,080 --> 03:37:53,309
into that space I mean they they kind
they they represent a path in the things

11364
03:37:53,309 --> 03:37:53,319
they they represent a path in the things
 

11365
03:37:53,319 --> 03:37:55,510
they they represent a path in the things
they do maybe a set of paths right so

11366
03:37:55,510 --> 03:37:55,520
they do maybe a set of paths right so
 

11367
03:37:55,520 --> 03:37:58,510
they do maybe a set of paths right so
like and a set of axioms that are chosen

11368
03:37:58,510 --> 03:37:58,520
like and a set of axioms that are chosen
 

11369
03:37:58,520 --> 03:37:59,710
like and a set of axioms that are chosen
right so so for example here's an

11370
03:37:59,710 --> 03:37:59,720
right so so for example here's an
 

11371
03:37:59,720 --> 03:38:02,269
right so so for example here's an
example of of a thing that I realized so

11372
03:38:02,269 --> 03:38:02,279
example of of a thing that I realized so
 

11373
03:38:02,279 --> 03:38:03,990
example of of a thing that I realized so
one of the surprising things about well

11374
03:38:03,990 --> 03:38:04,000
one of the surprising things about well
 

11375
03:38:04,000 --> 03:38:06,030
one of the surprising things about well
there two surprising facts about math

11376
03:38:06,030 --> 03:38:06,040
there two surprising facts about math
 

11377
03:38:06,040 --> 03:38:08,030
there two surprising facts about math
one is that it's hard and the other is

11378
03:38:08,030 --> 03:38:08,040
one is that it's hard and the other is
 

11379
03:38:08,040 --> 03:38:10,910
one is that it's hard and the other is
that it's doable okay so first question

11380
03:38:10,910 --> 03:38:10,920
that it's doable okay so first question
 

11381
03:38:10,920 --> 03:38:13,110
that it's doable okay so first question
is why is math hard you know you've got

11382
03:38:13,110 --> 03:38:13,120
is why is math hard you know you've got
 

11383
03:38:13,120 --> 03:38:15,110
is why is math hard you know you've got
these axioms they're very small why

11384
03:38:15,110 --> 03:38:15,120
these axioms they're very small why
 

11385
03:38:15,120 --> 03:38:17,070
these axioms they're very small why
can't just solve every problem in math

11386
03:38:17,070 --> 03:38:17,080
can't just solve every problem in math
 

11387
03:38:17,080 --> 03:38:20,030
can't just solve every problem in math
easily yeah it's just logic right yeah

11388
03:38:20,030 --> 03:38:20,040
easily yeah it's just logic right yeah
 

11389
03:38:20,040 --> 03:38:21,950
easily yeah it's just logic right yeah
well logic happens to be a particular

11390
03:38:21,950 --> 03:38:21,960
well logic happens to be a particular
 

11391
03:38:21,960 --> 03:38:23,469
well logic happens to be a particular
special case that does have certain

11392
03:38:23,469 --> 03:38:23,479
special case that does have certain
 

11393
03:38:23,479 --> 03:38:25,830
special case that does have certain
Simplicity to it um but General

11394
03:38:25,830 --> 03:38:25,840
Simplicity to it um but General
 

11395
03:38:25,840 --> 03:38:27,950
Simplicity to it um but General
mathematics even arithmetic already

11396
03:38:27,950 --> 03:38:27,960
mathematics even arithmetic already
 

11397
03:38:27,960 --> 03:38:29,790
mathematics even arithmetic already
doesn't have the Simplicity that logic

11398
03:38:29,790 --> 03:38:29,800
doesn't have the Simplicity that logic
 

11399
03:38:29,800 --> 03:38:32,030
doesn't have the Simplicity that logic
has so why is it hard because of

11400
03:38:32,030 --> 03:38:32,040
has so why is it hard because of
 

11401
03:38:32,040 --> 03:38:33,110
has so why is it hard because of
computational

11402
03:38:33,110 --> 03:38:33,120
computational
 

11403
03:38:33,120 --> 03:38:36,070
computational
irreducibility right right because what

11404
03:38:36,070 --> 03:38:36,080
irreducibility right right because what
 

11405
03:38:36,080 --> 03:38:39,110
irreducibility right right because what
happens is to know what's true and this

11406
03:38:39,110 --> 03:38:39,120
happens is to know what's true and this
 

11407
03:38:39,120 --> 03:38:40,790
happens is to know what's true and this
is this whole story about the path you

11408
03:38:40,790 --> 03:38:40,800
is this whole story about the path you
 

11409
03:38:40,800 --> 03:38:42,910
is this whole story about the path you
have to follow and how long is the path

11410
03:38:42,910 --> 03:38:42,920
have to follow and how long is the path
 

11411
03:38:42,920 --> 03:38:44,630
have to follow and how long is the path
and goal theorem is the statement there

11412
03:38:44,630 --> 03:38:44,640
and goal theorem is the statement there
 

11413
03:38:44,640 --> 03:38:46,389
and goal theorem is the statement there
could be an in that the path is not a

11414
03:38:46,389 --> 03:38:46,399
could be an in that the path is not a
 

11415
03:38:46,399 --> 03:38:48,750
could be an in that the path is not a
bounded length but the fact that the

11416
03:38:48,750 --> 03:38:48,760
bounded length but the fact that the
 

11417
03:38:48,760 --> 03:38:50,590
bounded length but the fact that the
path is not always compressible to

11418
03:38:50,590 --> 03:38:50,600
path is not always compressible to
 

11419
03:38:50,600 --> 03:38:52,469
path is not always compressible to
something tiny is a story of

11420
03:38:52,469 --> 03:38:52,479
something tiny is a story of
 

11421
03:38:52,479 --> 03:38:54,990
something tiny is a story of
computational irreducibility so that's

11422
03:38:54,990 --> 03:38:55,000
computational irreducibility so that's
 

11423
03:38:55,000 --> 03:38:57,349
computational irreducibility so that's
that's why math is hard now the next

11424
03:38:57,349 --> 03:38:57,359
that's why math is hard now the next
 

11425
03:38:57,359 --> 03:38:59,710
that's why math is hard now the next
question is why is math doable because

11426
03:38:59,710 --> 03:38:59,720
question is why is math doable because
 

11427
03:38:59,720 --> 03:39:01,510
question is why is math doable because
it might be the case that most things

finish on the why mathematics is doable

11514
03:40:32,950 --> 03:40:32,960
finish on the why mathematics is doable
 

11515
03:40:32,960 --> 03:40:34,990
finish on the why mathematics is doable
oh yes the second part so we know why

11516
03:40:34,990 --> 03:40:35,000
oh yes the second part so we know why
 

11517
03:40:35,000 --> 03:40:37,150
oh yes the second part so we know why
it's hard why is it doable right why do

11518
03:40:37,150 --> 03:40:37,160
it's hard why is it doable right why do
 

11519
03:40:37,160 --> 03:40:38,910
it's hard why is it doable right why do
we not just get lost in undecidability

11520
03:40:38,910 --> 03:40:38,920
we not just get lost in undecidability
 

11521
03:40:38,920 --> 03:40:41,910
we not just get lost in undecidability
all the time yeah um so and and here's

11522
03:40:41,910 --> 03:40:41,920
all the time yeah um so and and here's
 

11523
03:40:41,920 --> 03:40:44,269
all the time yeah um so and and here's
another fact is in doing computer

11524
03:40:44,269 --> 03:40:44,279
another fact is in doing computer
 

11525
03:40:44,279 --> 03:40:46,389
another fact is in doing computer
experiments and doing experimental

11526
03:40:46,389 --> 03:40:46,399
experiments and doing experimental
 

11527
03:40:46,399 --> 03:40:48,990
experiments and doing experimental
mathematics you do get lost in that way

11528
03:40:48,990 --> 03:40:49,000
mathematics you do get lost in that way
 

11529
03:40:49,000 --> 03:40:52,150
mathematics you do get lost in that way
when you just say I'm picking a random

11534
03:40:57,030 --> 03:40:57,040

11535
03:40:57,040 --> 03:40:59,830

getting there often it's really really
 

11539
03:41:02,720 --> 03:41:04,349
getting there often it's really really
hard it's really hard to answer those

11540
03:41:04,349 --> 03:41:04,359
hard it's really hard to answer those
 

11541
03:41:04,359 --> 03:41:05,469
hard it's really hard to answer those
questions when you just pick them up

11545
03:41:07,920 --> 03:41:10,790
random from the space of possibilities
but what's what I think is happening is

11546
03:41:10,790 --> 03:41:10,800
but what's what I think is happening is
 

11547
03:41:10,800 --> 03:41:12,189
but what's what I think is happening is
and that's a case where you just fell

11548
03:41:12,189 --> 03:41:12,199
and that's a case where you just fell
 

11549
03:41:12,199 --> 03:41:13,790
and that's a case where you just fell
off into this ocean of sort of

03:41:13,790 --> 03:41:13,800
off into this ocean of sort of
 

11551
03:41:13,800 --> 03:41:15,790
off into this ocean of sort of

11552
03:41:15,790 --> 03:41:15,800
irreducibility and so on what's
 

11553
03:41:15,800 --> 03:41:18,469
irreducibility and so on what's
happening is human mathematics is a

03:41:18,469 --> 03:41:18,479
happening is human mathematics is a
 

11555

11563
03:41:28,080 --> 03:41:29,309
you you you've got this proof trajectory
and you're basically the human

03:41:48,950 --> 03:41:48,960
actually going doing the PA and the fact
 

11581
03:41:48,960 --> 03:41:51,070
actually going doing the PA and the fact
that you are constrained to go along

11582
03:41:51,070 --> 03:41:51,080
that you are constrained to go along
 

11583
03:41:51,080 --> 03:41:53,229
that you are constrained to go along
that path is the reason you don't end up

11584
03:41:53,229 --> 03:41:53,239
that path is the reason you don't end up
 

11585
03:41:53,239 --> 03:41:54,710
that path is the reason you don't end up
with lot every so often you'll see a

11586
03:41:54,710 --> 03:41:54,720
with lot every so often you'll see a
 

11587
03:41:54,720 --> 03:41:55,870
with lot every so often you'll see a
little piece of undecidability and

11588
03:41:55,870 --> 03:41:55,880
little piece of undecidability and
 

11589
03:41:55,880 --> 03:41:57,990
little piece of undecidability and
you'll avoid that that part of the path

11590
03:41:57,990 --> 03:41:58,000
you'll avoid that that part of the path
 

11591
03:41:58,000 --> 03:41:59,990
you'll avoid that that part of the path
but that's basically the story of why

11592
03:41:59,990 --> 03:42:00,000
but that's basically the story of why
 

11593
03:42:00,000 --> 03:42:01,790
but that's basically the story of why
human mathematics is has seemed to be

11594
03:42:01,790 --> 03:42:01,800
human mathematics is has seemed to be
 

11595
03:42:01,800 --> 03:42:04,269
human mathematics is has seemed to be
doable it's a story of exploring these

11596
03:42:04,269 --> 03:42:04,279
doable it's a story of exploring these
 

11597
03:42:04,279 --> 03:42:07,389
doable it's a story of exploring these
paths that that are by their nature they

11598
03:42:07,389 --> 03:42:07,399
paths that that are by their nature they
 

11599
03:42:07,399 --> 03:42:09,670
paths that that are by their nature they
have been constructed to be paths that

11600
03:42:09,670 --> 03:42:09,680
have been constructed to be paths that
 

11601
03:42:09,680 --> 03:42:11,309
have been constructed to be paths that
can be followed and so you can follow

11602
03:42:11,309 --> 03:42:11,319
can be followed and so you can follow
 

11603
03:42:11,319 --> 03:42:13,429
can be followed and so you can follow
them further now you know what why is

11604
03:42:13,429 --> 03:42:13,439
them further now you know what why is
 

11605
03:42:13,439 --> 03:42:15,630
them further now you know what why is
this relevant to anything so okay so

11606
03:42:15,630 --> 03:42:15,640
this relevant to anything so okay so
 

11607
03:42:15,640 --> 03:42:20,149
this relevant to anything so okay so
here's the the my my my belief the fact

11608
03:42:20,149 --> 03:42:20,159
here's the the my my my belief the fact
 

11609
03:42:20,159 --> 03:42:23,950
here's the the my my my belief the fact
that human mathematics works that way is

11610
03:42:23,950 --> 03:42:23,960
that human mathematics works that way is
 

11611
03:42:23,960 --> 03:42:26,070
that human mathematics works that way is
I think there's some sort of connections

11612
03:42:26,070 --> 03:42:26,080
I think there's some sort of connections
 

11613
03:42:26,080 --> 03:42:28,670
I think there's some sort of connections
between the way that observers work in

11614
03:42:28,670 --> 03:42:28,680
between the way that observers work in
 

11615
03:42:28,680 --> 03:42:30,950
between the way that observers work in
physics and the way that the axium

11616
03:42:30,950 --> 03:42:30,960
physics and the way that the axium
 

11617
03:42:30,960 --> 03:42:33,070
physics and the way that the axium
systems of mathematics are set up to

11618
03:42:33,070 --> 03:42:33,080
systems of mathematics are set up to
 

11619
03:42:33,080 --> 03:42:35,269
systems of mathematics are set up to
make mathematics be doable in that kind

11620
03:42:35,269 --> 03:42:35,279
make mathematics be doable in that kind
 

11621
03:42:35,279 --> 03:42:38,070
make mathematics be doable in that kind
of way and so in other words in

11622
03:42:38,070 --> 03:42:38,080
of way and so in other words in
 

11623
03:42:38,080 --> 03:42:40,070
of way and so in other words in
particular I think there is an analog of

11624
03:42:40,070 --> 03:42:40,080
particular I think there is an analog of
 

11625
03:42:40,080 --> 03:42:43,110
particular I think there is an analog of
causal invariance which I think is um

11626
03:42:43,110 --> 03:42:43,120
causal invariance which I think is um
 

11627
03:42:43,120 --> 03:42:45,469
causal invariance which I think is um
and this is again in sort of the upper

11628
03:42:45,469 --> 03:42:45,479
and this is again in sort of the upper
 

11629
03:42:45,479 --> 03:42:47,429
and this is again in sort of the upper
reaches of mathematics and and stuff

11630
03:42:47,429 --> 03:42:47,439
reaches of mathematics and and stuff
 

11631
03:42:47,439 --> 03:42:50,990
reaches of mathematics and and stuff
that um uh it's a thing there's this

11632
03:42:50,990 --> 03:42:51,000
that um uh it's a thing there's this
 

11633
03:42:51,000 --> 03:42:52,990
that um uh it's a thing there's this
thing called homotopy type Theory which

11634
03:42:52,990 --> 03:42:53,000
thing called homotopy type Theory which
 

11635
03:42:53,000 --> 03:42:55,349
thing called homotopy type Theory which
is an abstract it's came out of category

11636
03:42:55,349 --> 03:42:55,359
is an abstract it's came out of category
 

11637
03:42:55,359 --> 03:42:57,189
is an abstract it's came out of category
Theory and it's sort of an abstraction

11638
03:42:57,189 --> 03:42:57,199
Theory and it's sort of an abstraction
 

11639
03:42:57,199 --> 03:42:59,469
Theory and it's sort of an abstraction
of mathematics mathematics itself is an

11640
03:42:59,469 --> 03:42:59,479
of mathematics mathematics itself is an
 

11641
03:42:59,479 --> 03:43:01,910
of mathematics mathematics itself is an
abstraction but it's an abstraction of

11642
03:43:01,910 --> 03:43:01,920
abstraction but it's an abstraction of
 

11643
03:43:01,920 --> 03:43:04,149
abstraction but it's an abstraction of
the abstraction of mathematics and there

11644
03:43:04,149 --> 03:43:04,159
the abstraction of mathematics and there
 

11645
03:43:04,159 --> 03:43:06,630
the abstraction of mathematics and there
is a thing called the univalence axium

11646
03:43:06,630 --> 03:43:06,640
is a thing called the univalence axium
 

11647
03:43:06,640 --> 03:43:10,870
is a thing called the univalence axium
which is a sort of a a key axom in that

11648
03:43:10,870 --> 03:43:10,880
which is a sort of a a key axom in that
 

11649
03:43:10,880 --> 03:43:13,070
which is a sort of a a key axom in that
set of ideas and I'm pretty sure the

11650
03:43:13,070 --> 03:43:13,080
set of ideas and I'm pretty sure the
 

11651
03:43:13,080 --> 03:43:15,349
set of ideas and I'm pretty sure the
univance axium is equivalent to causal

11652
03:43:15,349 --> 03:43:15,359
univance axium is equivalent to causal
 

11653
03:43:15,359 --> 03:43:17,389
univance axium is equivalent to causal
variance what was the term you use again

11654
03:43:17,389 --> 03:43:17,399
variance what was the term you use again
 

11655
03:43:17,399 --> 03:43:19,870
variance what was the term you use again
uni univance is that something for

11656
03:43:19,870 --> 03:43:19,880
uni univance is that something for
 

11657
03:43:19,880 --> 03:43:22,670
uni univance is that something for
somebody like me accessible um or is

11658
03:43:22,670 --> 03:43:22,680
somebody like me accessible um or is
 

11659
03:43:22,680 --> 03:43:24,349
somebody like me accessible um or is
this there's a statement of it that's

11660
03:43:24,349 --> 03:43:24,359
this there's a statement of it that's
 

11661
03:43:24,359 --> 03:43:26,269
this there's a statement of it that's
fairly accessible I mean the statement

11662
03:43:26,269 --> 03:43:26,279
fairly accessible I mean the statement
 

11663
03:43:26,279 --> 03:43:31,269
fairly accessible I mean the statement
of it is um uh basically it says things

11664
03:43:31,269 --> 03:43:31,279
of it is um uh basically it says things
 

11665
03:43:31,279 --> 03:43:33,469
of it is um uh basically it says things
which are equivalent can be considered

11666
03:43:33,469 --> 03:43:33,479
which are equivalent can be considered
 

11667
03:43:33,479 --> 03:43:34,550
which are equivalent can be considered
to be

11668
03:43:34,550 --> 03:43:34,560
to be
 

11669
03:43:34,560 --> 03:43:38,229
to be
identical in which but in which space

11670
03:43:38,229 --> 03:43:38,239
identical in which but in which space
 

11671
03:43:38,239 --> 03:43:40,389
identical in which but in which space
yeah it's it's in in higher category

11672
03:43:40,389 --> 03:43:40,399
yeah it's it's in in higher category
 

11673
03:43:40,399 --> 03:43:42,830
yeah it's it's in in higher category
okay in Category 3 okay so it's it's a

11674
03:43:42,830 --> 03:43:42,840
okay in Category 3 okay so it's it's a
 

11675
03:43:42,840 --> 03:43:45,229
okay in Category 3 okay so it's it's a
it's a but I mean the thing just to give

11676
03:43:45,229 --> 03:43:45,239
it's a but I mean the thing just to give
 

11677
03:43:45,239 --> 03:43:46,830
it's a but I mean the thing just to give
sketch of how that works so category

11678
03:43:46,830 --> 03:43:46,840
sketch of how that works so category
 

11679
03:43:46,840 --> 03:43:49,950
sketch of how that works so category
theory is an attempt to idealize it's an

11680
03:43:49,950 --> 03:43:49,960
theory is an attempt to idealize it's an
 

11681
03:43:49,960 --> 03:43:51,990
theory is an attempt to idealize it's an
attempt to sort of have a formal theory

11682
03:43:51,990 --> 03:43:52,000
attempt to sort of have a formal theory
 

11683
03:43:52,000 --> 03:43:53,790
attempt to sort of have a formal theory
of mathematics that is at a sort of

11684
03:43:53,790 --> 03:43:53,800
of mathematics that is at a sort of
 

11685
03:43:53,800 --> 03:43:56,389
of mathematics that is at a sort of
higher level than mathematics it's where

11686
03:43:56,389 --> 03:43:56,399
higher level than mathematics it's where
 

11687
03:43:56,399 --> 03:43:57,870
higher level than mathematics it's where
where you just think think about these

11688
03:43:57,870 --> 03:43:57,880
where you just think think about these
 

11689
03:43:57,880 --> 03:44:00,269
where you just think think about these
mathematical objects and these

11690
03:44:00,269 --> 03:44:00,279
mathematical objects and these
 

11691
03:44:00,279 --> 03:44:02,950
mathematical objects and these
categories of objects and these these

11692
03:44:02,950 --> 03:44:02,960
categories of objects and these these
 

11693
03:44:02,960 --> 03:44:04,750
categories of objects and these these
morphisms these connections between

11694
03:44:04,750 --> 03:44:04,760
morphisms these connections between
 

11695
03:44:04,760 --> 03:44:06,670
morphisms these connections between
categories okay so it turns out the

11696
03:44:06,670 --> 03:44:06,680
categories okay so it turns out the
 

11697
03:44:06,680 --> 03:44:09,790
categories okay so it turns out the
morphisms and categories the least weak

11698
03:44:09,790 --> 03:44:09,800
morphisms and categories the least weak
 

11699
03:44:09,800 --> 03:44:12,670
morphisms and categories the least weak
categories are very much like the paths

11700
03:44:12,670 --> 03:44:12,680
categories are very much like the paths
 

11701
03:44:12,680 --> 03:44:15,110
categories are very much like the paths
in our hypergraphs and things and it

11702
03:44:15,110 --> 03:44:15,120
in our hypergraphs and things and it
 

11703
03:44:15,120 --> 03:44:17,229
in our hypergraphs and things and it
turns out again this is this is where it

11704
03:44:17,229 --> 03:44:17,239
turns out again this is this is where it
 

11705
03:44:17,239 --> 03:44:19,550
turns out again this is this is where it
all gets gets crazy I mean it's it's the

11706
03:44:19,550 --> 03:44:19,560
all gets gets crazy I mean it's it's the
 

11707
03:44:19,560 --> 03:44:20,910
all gets gets crazy I mean it's it's the
fact that these things are connected is

11708
03:44:20,910 --> 03:44:20,920
fact that these things are connected is
 

11709
03:44:20,920 --> 03:44:25,349
fact that these things are connected is
just bizarre so category Theory uh the

11710
03:44:25,349 --> 03:44:25,359
just bizarre so category Theory uh the
 

11711
03:44:25,359 --> 03:44:28,349
just bizarre so category Theory uh the
our causal graphs are like second order

11712
03:44:28,349 --> 03:44:28,359
our causal graphs are like second order
 

11713
03:44:28,359 --> 03:44:31,670
our causal graphs are like second order
category Theory and it turns out you can

11714
03:44:31,670 --> 03:44:31,680
category Theory and it turns out you can
 

11715
03:44:31,680 --> 03:44:33,510
category Theory and it turns out you can
take the limit of infinite order

11716
03:44:33,510 --> 03:44:33,520
take the limit of infinite order
 

11717
03:44:33,520 --> 03:44:35,670
take the limit of infinite order
category Theory so just just give rough

11718
03:44:35,670 --> 03:44:35,680
category Theory so just just give rough
 

11719
03:44:35,680 --> 03:44:37,910
category Theory so just just give rough
roughly the idea this is a this is a

11720
03:44:37,910 --> 03:44:37,920
roughly the idea this is a this is a
 

11721
03:44:37,920 --> 03:44:39,870
roughly the idea this is a this is a
roughly explainable idea so a

11722
03:44:39,870 --> 03:44:39,880
roughly explainable idea so a
 

11723
03:44:39,880 --> 03:44:43,590
roughly explainable idea so a
mathematical proof will be a path that

11724
03:44:43,590 --> 03:44:43,600
mathematical proof will be a path that
 

11725
03:44:43,600 --> 03:44:45,469
mathematical proof will be a path that
says you can get from this thing to this

11726
03:44:45,469 --> 03:44:45,479
says you can get from this thing to this
 

11727
03:44:45,479 --> 03:44:46,950
says you can get from this thing to this
other thing and here's the path you get

11728
03:44:46,950 --> 03:44:46,960
other thing and here's the path you get
 

11729
03:44:46,960 --> 03:44:48,790
other thing and here's the path you get
from this thing to this other thing but

11730
03:44:48,790 --> 03:44:48,800
from this thing to this other thing but
 

11731
03:44:48,800 --> 03:44:51,550
from this thing to this other thing but
in general there may be many paths many

11732
03:44:51,550 --> 03:44:51,560
in general there may be many paths many
 

11733
03:44:51,560 --> 03:44:53,950
in general there may be many paths many
proofs that get you many different paths

11734
03:44:53,950 --> 03:44:53,960
proofs that get you many different paths
 

11735
03:44:53,960 --> 03:44:55,750
proofs that get you many different paths
that all successfully go from this thing

11736
03:44:55,750 --> 03:44:55,760
that all successfully go from this thing
 

11737
03:44:55,760 --> 03:44:58,189
that all successfully go from this thing
to this other thing okay now you can

11738
03:44:58,189 --> 03:44:58,199
to this other thing okay now you can
 

11739
03:44:58,199 --> 03:45:00,910
to this other thing okay now you can
define a higher order proof which is a

11740
03:45:00,910 --> 03:45:00,920
define a higher order proof which is a
 

11741
03:45:00,920 --> 03:45:03,030
define a higher order proof which is a
proof of the equivalence of those proofs

11742
03:45:03,030 --> 03:45:03,040
proof of the equivalence of those proofs
 

11743
03:45:03,040 --> 03:45:05,510
proof of the equivalence of those proofs
mhm okay so you're saying there's a go

11744
03:45:05,510 --> 03:45:05,520
mhm okay so you're saying there's a go
 

11745
03:45:05,520 --> 03:45:07,229
mhm okay so you're saying there's a go
path between those proofs essentially

11746
03:45:07,229 --> 03:45:07,239
path between those proofs essentially
 

11747
03:45:07,239 --> 03:45:09,830
path between those proofs essentially
yes a path between the paths yeah okay

11748
03:45:09,830 --> 03:45:09,840
yes a path between the paths yeah okay
 

11749
03:45:09,840 --> 03:45:11,510
yes a path between the paths yeah okay
and so you do that that's the sort of

11750
03:45:11,510 --> 03:45:11,520
and so you do that that's the sort of
 

11751
03:45:11,520 --> 03:45:13,429
and so you do that that's the sort of
second order thing that path between the

11752
03:45:13,429 --> 03:45:13,439
second order thing that path between the
 

11753
03:45:13,439 --> 03:45:16,349
second order thing that path between the
paths is essentially related to our

11754
03:45:16,349 --> 03:45:16,359
paths is essentially related to our
 

11755
03:45:16,359 --> 03:45:20,710
paths is essentially related to our
causal graphs then take limit wow path

11756
03:45:20,710 --> 03:45:20,720
causal graphs then take limit wow path
 

11757
03:45:20,720 --> 03:45:22,990
causal graphs then take limit wow path
between path between path between path

11758
03:45:22,990 --> 03:45:23,000
between path between path between path
 

11759
03:45:23,000 --> 03:45:25,550
between path between path between path
the infinite limit that infinite limit

11760
03:45:25,550 --> 03:45:25,560
the infinite limit that infinite limit
 

11761
03:45:25,560 --> 03:45:28,710
the infinite limit that infinite limit
turns out to be our Ral multi-way system

11762
03:45:28,710 --> 03:45:28,720
turns out to be our Ral multi-way system
 

11763
03:45:28,720 --> 03:45:31,189
turns out to be our Ral multi-way system
yeah the Ral the the Ral multi-way

11764
03:45:31,189 --> 03:45:31,199
yeah the Ral the the Ral multi-way
 

11765
03:45:31,199 --> 03:45:32,830
yeah the Ral the the Ral multi-way
system that's a fascinating thing both

11766
03:45:32,830 --> 03:45:32,840
system that's a fascinating thing both
 

11767
03:45:32,840 --> 03:45:34,510
system that's a fascinating thing both
in the physics world and and as you're

11768
03:45:34,510 --> 03:45:34,520
in the physics world and and as you're
 

11769
03:45:34,520 --> 03:45:37,189
in the physics world and and as you're
saying now that's that's I'm not sure

11770
03:45:37,189 --> 03:45:37,199
saying now that's that's I'm not sure
 

11771
03:45:37,199 --> 03:45:39,189
saying now that's that's I'm not sure
I've loaded it in completely but well

11772
03:45:39,189 --> 03:45:39,199
I've loaded it in completely but well
 

11773
03:45:39,199 --> 03:45:40,670
I've loaded it in completely but well
I'm not sure I have either and it may be

11774
03:45:40,670 --> 03:45:40,680
I'm not sure I have either and it may be
 

11775
03:45:40,680 --> 03:45:42,429
I'm not sure I have either and it may be
one of these things where where you know

11776
03:45:42,429 --> 03:45:42,439
one of these things where where you know
 

11777
03:45:42,439 --> 03:45:44,269
one of these things where where you know
in another another five years or

11778
03:45:44,269 --> 03:45:44,279
in another another five years or
 

11779
03:45:44,279 --> 03:45:46,110
in another another five years or
something it's like this was obvious but

11780
03:45:46,110 --> 03:45:46,120
something it's like this was obvious but
 

11781
03:45:46,120 --> 03:45:48,070
something it's like this was obvious but
I didn't see it no but the thing which

11782
03:45:48,070 --> 03:45:48,080
I didn't see it no but the thing which
 

11783
03:45:48,080 --> 03:45:49,710
I didn't see it no but the thing which
is sort of interesting to me is that

11784
03:45:49,710 --> 03:45:49,720
is sort of interesting to me is that
 

11785
03:45:49,720 --> 03:45:52,149
is sort of interesting to me is that
there's sort of an upper reach of of

11786
03:45:52,149 --> 03:45:52,159
there's sort of an upper reach of of
 

11787
03:45:52,159 --> 03:45:54,229
there's sort of an upper reach of of
mathematics of the abstraction of

11788
03:45:54,229 --> 03:45:54,239
mathematics of the abstraction of
 

11789
03:45:54,239 --> 03:45:57,149
mathematics of the abstraction of
mathematics um this thing there's this

11790
03:45:57,149 --> 03:45:57,159
mathematics um this thing there's this
 

11791
03:45:57,159 --> 03:45:58,990
mathematics um this thing there's this
mathematician called grth and deque

11792
03:45:58,990 --> 03:45:59,000
mathematician called grth and deque
 

11793
03:45:59,000 --> 03:46:00,510
mathematician called grth and deque
who's generally viewed as being sort of

11794
03:46:00,510 --> 03:46:00,520
who's generally viewed as being sort of
 

11795
03:46:00,520 --> 03:46:02,950
who's generally viewed as being sort of
one of the most abstract sort of creator

11796
03:46:02,950 --> 03:46:02,960
one of the most abstract sort of creator
 

11797
03:46:02,960 --> 03:46:05,309
one of the most abstract sort of creator
of the most abstract mathematics of

11798
03:46:05,309 --> 03:46:05,319
of the most abstract mathematics of
 

11799
03:46:05,319 --> 03:46:09,910
of the most abstract mathematics of
1970s is time frame um and one of the

11800
03:46:09,910 --> 03:46:09,920
1970s is time frame um and one of the
 

11801
03:46:09,920 --> 03:46:11,349
1970s is time frame um and one of the
things that he constructed was this

11802
03:46:11,349 --> 03:46:11,359
things that he constructed was this
 

11803
03:46:11,359 --> 03:46:14,189
things that he constructed was this
thing he called the infinity groupoid um

11804
03:46:14,189 --> 03:46:14,199
thing he called the infinity groupoid um
 

11805
03:46:14,199 --> 03:46:15,990
thing he called the infinity groupoid um
and he has the sort of hypothesis about

11806
03:46:15,990 --> 03:46:16,000
and he has the sort of hypothesis about
 

11807
03:46:16,000 --> 03:46:18,349
and he has the sort of hypothesis about
the inevitable appearance of geometry

11808
03:46:18,349 --> 03:46:18,359
the inevitable appearance of geometry
 

11809
03:46:18,359 --> 03:46:21,110
the inevitable appearance of geometry
from essentially logic in the structure

11810
03:46:21,110 --> 03:46:21,120
from essentially logic in the structure
 

11811
03:46:21,120 --> 03:46:23,750
from essentially logic in the structure
of this thing well it turns out this Ral

11812
03:46:23,750 --> 03:46:23,760
of this thing well it turns out this Ral
 

11813
03:46:23,760 --> 03:46:25,670
of this thing well it turns out this Ral
multiway system is the infinity group

11814
03:46:25,670 --> 03:46:25,680
multiway system is the infinity group
 

11815
03:46:25,680 --> 03:46:29,630
multiway system is the infinity group
void so it's a it's this limiting object

11816
03:46:29,630 --> 03:46:29,640
void so it's a it's this limiting object
 

11817
03:46:29,640 --> 03:46:32,110
void so it's a it's this limiting object
and this is an this is an instance of

11818
03:46:32,110 --> 03:46:32,120
and this is an this is an instance of
 

11819
03:46:32,120 --> 03:46:34,990
and this is an this is an instance of
that limiting object so what to me is I

11820
03:46:34,990 --> 03:46:35,000
that limiting object so what to me is I
 

11821
03:46:35,000 --> 03:46:36,830
that limiting object so what to me is I
mean again I I've been always afraid of

11822
03:46:36,830 --> 03:46:36,840
mean again I I've been always afraid of
 

11823
03:46:36,840 --> 03:46:38,389
mean again I I've been always afraid of
this kind of mathematics because it

11824
03:46:38,389 --> 03:46:38,399
this kind of mathematics because it
 

11825
03:46:38,399 --> 03:46:41,830
this kind of mathematics because it
seemed incomprehensibly abstract to me

11826
03:46:41,830 --> 03:46:41,840
seemed incomprehensibly abstract to me
 

11827
03:46:41,840 --> 03:46:44,550
seemed incomprehensibly abstract to me
um but what's what's what I'm sort of

11828
03:46:44,550 --> 03:46:44,560
um but what's what's what I'm sort of
 

11829
03:46:44,560 --> 03:46:47,189
um but what's what's what I'm sort of
excited about with this is that that

11830
03:46:47,189 --> 03:46:47,199
excited about with this is that that
 

11831
03:46:47,199 --> 03:46:49,590
excited about with this is that that
we've sort of concre ified the way that

11832
03:46:49,590 --> 03:46:49,600
we've sort of concre ified the way that
 

11833
03:46:49,600 --> 03:46:51,990
we've sort of concre ified the way that
you can reach this kind of mathematics

11834
03:46:51,990 --> 03:46:52,000
you can reach this kind of mathematics
 

11835
03:46:52,000 --> 03:46:54,710
you can reach this kind of mathematics
which makes it uh well both seem more

11836
03:46:54,710 --> 03:46:54,720
which makes it uh well both seem more
 

11837
03:46:54,720 --> 03:46:57,229
which makes it uh well both seem more
relevant and also the fact that that you

11838
03:46:57,229 --> 03:46:57,239
relevant and also the fact that that you
 

11839
03:46:57,239 --> 03:46:58,950
relevant and also the fact that that you
know I don't yet know exactly what

11840
03:46:58,950 --> 03:46:58,960
know I don't yet know exactly what
 

11841
03:46:58,960 --> 03:47:01,110
know I don't yet know exactly what
mileage we're going to get from using

11842
03:47:01,110 --> 03:47:01,120
mileage we're going to get from using
 

11843
03:47:01,120 --> 03:47:02,950
mileage we're going to get from using
the sort of the apparatus that's been

11844
03:47:02,950 --> 03:47:02,960
the sort of the apparatus that's been
 

11845
03:47:02,960 --> 03:47:05,229
the sort of the apparatus that's been
built in those areas of mathematics to

11846
03:47:05,229 --> 03:47:05,239
built in those areas of mathematics to
 

11847
03:47:05,239 --> 03:47:06,990
built in those areas of mathematics to
analyze what we're doing but the thing

11848
03:47:06,990 --> 03:47:07,000
analyze what we're doing but the thing
 

11849
03:47:07,000 --> 03:47:09,349
analyze what we're doing but the thing
that's so both ways so use mathematics

11850
03:47:09,349 --> 03:47:09,359
that's so both ways so use mathematics
 

11851
03:47:09,359 --> 03:47:11,070
that's so both ways so use mathematics
understand what you're doing and using

11852
03:47:11,070 --> 03:47:11,080
understand what you're doing and using
 

11853
03:47:11,080 --> 03:47:12,590
understand what you're doing and using
what you're doing computationally to

11854
03:47:12,590 --> 03:47:12,600
what you're doing computationally to
 

11855
03:47:12,600 --> 03:47:14,030
what you're doing computationally to
understand that right so so for example

11856
03:47:14,030 --> 03:47:14,040
understand that right so so for example
 

11857
03:47:14,040 --> 03:47:16,469
understand that right so so for example
the the understand of uh meta

11858
03:47:16,469 --> 03:47:16,479
the the understand of uh meta
 

11859
03:47:16,479 --> 03:47:18,590
the the understand of uh meta
mathematical space one of the reasons I

11860
03:47:18,590 --> 03:47:18,600
mathematical space one of the reasons I
 

11861
03:47:18,600 --> 03:47:20,389
mathematical space one of the reasons I
really want to do that is because I want

11862
03:47:20,389 --> 03:47:20,399
really want to do that is because I want
 

11863
03:47:20,399 --> 03:47:22,670
really want to do that is because I want
to understand quantum mechanics better

11864
03:47:22,670 --> 03:47:22,680
to understand quantum mechanics better
 

11865
03:47:22,680 --> 03:47:26,229
to understand quantum mechanics better
and and that what you see you know we

11866
03:47:26,229 --> 03:47:26,239
and and that what you see you know we
 

11867
03:47:26,239 --> 03:47:29,429
and and that what you see you know we
live that uh kind of the multi-way graph

11868
03:47:29,429 --> 03:47:29,439
live that uh kind of the multi-way graph
 

11869
03:47:29,439 --> 03:47:31,229
live that uh kind of the multi-way graph
of mathematics because we actually know

11870
03:47:31,229 --> 03:47:31,239
of mathematics because we actually know
 

11871
03:47:31,239 --> 03:47:32,710
of mathematics because we actually know
this is a theorem we've heard of this is

11872
03:47:32,710 --> 03:47:32,720
this is a theorem we've heard of this is
 

11873
03:47:32,720 --> 03:47:34,269
this is a theorem we've heard of this is
another one we've heard of we can

11874
03:47:34,269 --> 03:47:34,279
another one we've heard of we can
 

11875
03:47:34,279 --> 03:47:36,429
another one we've heard of we can
actually say these are actual things in

11876
03:47:36,429 --> 03:47:36,439
actually say these are actual things in
 

11877
03:47:36,439 --> 03:47:38,710
actually say these are actual things in
the world that we relate to which we

11878
03:47:38,710 --> 03:47:38,720
the world that we relate to which we
 

11879
03:47:38,720 --> 03:47:41,790
the world that we relate to which we
can't really do as as readily for the

11880
03:47:41,790 --> 03:47:41,800
can't really do as as readily for the
 

11881
03:47:41,800 --> 03:47:44,110
can't really do as as readily for the
the physics case and so it's kind of a

11882
03:47:44,110 --> 03:47:44,120
the physics case and so it's kind of a
 

11883
03:47:44,120 --> 03:47:46,189
the physics case and so it's kind of a
way to help my intuition it's also you

11884
03:47:46,189 --> 03:47:46,199
way to help my intuition it's also you
 

11885
03:47:46,199 --> 03:47:48,229
way to help my intuition it's also you
know there are bizarre things like the

11886
03:47:48,229 --> 03:47:48,239
know there are bizarre things like the
 

11887
03:47:48,239 --> 03:47:49,550
know there are bizarre things like the
what's the analog of Einstein's

11888
03:47:49,550 --> 03:47:49,560
what's the analog of Einstein's
 

11889
03:47:49,560 --> 03:47:51,870
what's the analog of Einstein's
equations in metam mathematical space

11890
03:47:51,870 --> 03:47:51,880
equations in metam mathematical space
 

11891
03:47:51,880 --> 03:47:53,790
equations in metam mathematical space
what's the analog of a black hole you

11892
03:47:53,790 --> 03:47:53,800
what's the analog of a black hole you
 

11893
03:47:53,800 --> 03:47:56,070
what's the analog of a black hole you
know it turns out it looks like not

11894
03:47:56,070 --> 03:47:56,080
know it turns out it looks like not
 

11895
03:47:56,080 --> 03:47:58,309
know it turns out it looks like not
completely sure yet but there's this

11896
03:47:58,309 --> 03:47:58,319
completely sure yet but there's this
 

11897
03:47:58,319 --> 03:48:00,469
completely sure yet but there's this
notion of non-constructive proofs in

11898
03:48:00,469 --> 03:48:00,479
notion of non-constructive proofs in
 

11899
03:48:00,479 --> 03:48:03,590
notion of non-constructive proofs in
mathematics and I think those relate to

11900
03:48:03,590 --> 03:48:03,600
mathematics and I think those relate to
 

11901
03:48:03,600 --> 03:48:07,030
mathematics and I think those relate to
well actually the the they they relate

11902
03:48:07,030 --> 03:48:07,040
well actually the the they they relate
 

11903
03:48:07,040 --> 03:48:10,149
well actually the the they they relate
to things and related to event Horizons

11904
03:48:10,149 --> 03:48:10,159
to things and related to event Horizons
 

11905
03:48:10,159 --> 03:48:12,189
to things and related to event Horizons
um so the fact that you can take ideas

11906
03:48:12,189 --> 03:48:12,199
um so the fact that you can take ideas
 

11907
03:48:12,199 --> 03:48:15,110
um so the fact that you can take ideas
from physics like event Horizons into

11908
03:48:15,110 --> 03:48:15,120
from physics like event Horizons into
 

11909
03:48:15,120 --> 03:48:18,110
from physics like event Horizons into
the same kind of it's it's really so do

11910
03:48:18,110 --> 03:48:18,120
the same kind of it's it's really so do
 

11911
03:48:18,120 --> 03:48:20,030
the same kind of it's it's really so do
you think there'll be do you think you

11912
03:48:20,030 --> 03:48:20,040
you think there'll be do you think you
 

11913
03:48:20,040 --> 03:48:23,349
you think there'll be do you think you
might stumble upon some breakthrough

11914
03:48:23,349 --> 03:48:23,359
might stumble upon some breakthrough
 

11915
03:48:23,359 --> 03:48:27,510
might stumble upon some breakthrough
ideas in theorem proving like for from

11916
03:48:27,510 --> 03:48:27,520
ideas in theorem proving like for from
 

11917
03:48:27,520 --> 03:48:29,309
ideas in theorem proving like for from
the the other direction yeah yeah yeah

11918
03:48:29,309 --> 03:48:29,319
the the other direction yeah yeah yeah
 

11919
03:48:29,319 --> 03:48:31,110
the the other direction yeah yeah yeah
no I mean what's really nice is that we

11920
03:48:31,110 --> 03:48:31,120
no I mean what's really nice is that we
 

11921
03:48:31,120 --> 03:48:34,349
no I mean what's really nice is that we
are using so this this absolutely

11922
03:48:34,349 --> 03:48:34,359
are using so this this absolutely
 

11923
03:48:34,359 --> 03:48:35,830
are using so this this absolutely
directly maps to theorem proving so

11924
03:48:35,830 --> 03:48:35,840
directly maps to theorem proving so
 

11925
03:48:35,840 --> 03:48:37,550
directly maps to theorem proving so
paths and multi-way graphs that's what a

11926
03:48:37,550 --> 03:48:37,560
paths and multi-way graphs that's what a
 

11927
03:48:37,560 --> 03:48:38,910
paths and multi-way graphs that's what a
theorem improver is trying to do but I

11928
03:48:38,910 --> 03:48:38,920
theorem improver is trying to do but I
 

11929
03:48:38,920 --> 03:48:40,950
theorem improver is trying to do but I
also mean like like automated de yeah

11930
03:48:40,950 --> 03:48:40,960
also mean like like automated de yeah
 

11931
03:48:40,960 --> 03:48:42,710
also mean like like automated de yeah
yeah yeah that that's what right so the

11932
03:48:42,710 --> 03:48:42,720
yeah yeah that that's what right so the
 

11933
03:48:42,720 --> 03:48:44,510
yeah yeah that that's what right so the
finding of PODS the finding of shortest

11934
03:48:44,510 --> 03:48:44,520
finding of PODS the finding of shortest
 

11935
03:48:44,520 --> 03:48:46,910
finding of PODS the finding of shortest
parts s or finding a paths at all is

11936
03:48:46,910 --> 03:48:46,920
parts s or finding a paths at all is
 

11937
03:48:46,920 --> 03:48:48,950
parts s or finding a paths at all is
what automated theorem provs do and

11938
03:48:48,950 --> 03:48:48,960
what automated theorem provs do and
 

11939
03:48:48,960 --> 03:48:51,229
what automated theorem provs do and
actually what what we've been doing so

11940
03:48:51,229 --> 03:48:51,239
actually what what we've been doing so
 

11941
03:48:51,239 --> 03:48:52,790
actually what what we've been doing so
we've you know we've actually been using

11942
03:48:52,790 --> 03:48:52,800
we've you know we've actually been using
 

11943
03:48:52,800 --> 03:48:54,189
we've you know we've actually been using
automated theorem proving both in the

11944
03:48:54,189 --> 03:48:54,199
automated theorem proving both in the
 

11945
03:48:54,199 --> 03:48:57,030
automated theorem proving both in the
physics project to prove things and

11946
03:48:57,030 --> 03:48:57,040
physics project to prove things and
 

11947
03:48:57,040 --> 03:48:58,990
physics project to prove things and
using that as a way to understand

11948
03:48:58,990 --> 03:48:59,000
using that as a way to understand
 

11949
03:48:59,000 --> 03:49:02,229
using that as a way to understand
multi-way graphs and because what an

11950
03:49:02,229 --> 03:49:02,239
multi-way graphs and because what an
 

11951
03:49:02,239 --> 03:49:04,149
multi-way graphs and because what an
automated theorem prover is doing is

11952
03:49:04,149 --> 03:49:04,159
automated theorem prover is doing is
 

11953
03:49:04,159 --> 03:49:05,790
automated theorem prover is doing is
it's trying to find a path through a

11954
03:49:05,790 --> 03:49:05,800
it's trying to find a path through a
 

11955
03:49:05,800 --> 03:49:08,429
it's trying to find a path through a
multi-way graph and its critical pair

11956
03:49:08,429 --> 03:49:08,439
multi-way graph and its critical pair
 

11957
03:49:08,439 --> 03:49:11,910
multi-way graph and its critical pair
lemas are precisely little stubs of

11958
03:49:11,910 --> 03:49:11,920
lemas are precisely little stubs of
 

11959
03:49:11,920 --> 03:49:14,070
lemas are precisely little stubs of
Branch pairs going off into branchial

11960
03:49:14,070 --> 03:49:14,080
Branch pairs going off into branchial
 

11961
03:49:14,080 --> 03:49:16,309
Branch pairs going off into branchial
space and that's I mean it's really

11962
03:49:16,309 --> 03:49:16,319
space and that's I mean it's really
 

11963
03:49:16,319 --> 03:49:17,469
space and that's I mean it's really
weird you know we have these

11964
03:49:17,469 --> 03:49:17,479
weird you know we have these
 

11965
03:49:17,479 --> 03:49:20,550
weird you know we have these
visualizations in W language of our of

11966
03:49:20,550 --> 03:49:20,560
visualizations in W language of our of
 

11967
03:49:20,560 --> 03:49:22,910
visualizations in W language of our of
of um proof graphs from our automative

11968
03:49:22,910 --> 03:49:22,920
of um proof graphs from our automative
 

11969
03:49:22,920 --> 03:49:24,830
of um proof graphs from our automative
theorem proving system and they look

11970
03:49:24,830 --> 03:49:24,840
theorem proving system and they look
 

11971
03:49:24,840 --> 03:49:26,830
theorem proving system and they look
reminiscent of well it's just bizarre

11972
03:49:26,830 --> 03:49:26,840
reminiscent of well it's just bizarre
 

11973
03:49:26,840 --> 03:49:28,670
reminiscent of well it's just bizarre
because we made these up a few years ago

11974
03:49:28,670 --> 03:49:28,680
because we made these up a few years ago
 

11975
03:49:28,680 --> 03:49:30,070
because we made these up a few years ago
and they have these little triangle

11976
03:49:30,070 --> 03:49:30,080
and they have these little triangle
 

11977
03:49:30,080 --> 03:49:32,070
and they have these little triangle
things and they are they are we we

11978
03:49:32,070 --> 03:49:32,080
things and they are they are we we
 

11979
03:49:32,080 --> 03:49:33,349
things and they are they are we we
didn't quite get it right we didn't

11980
03:49:33,349 --> 03:49:33,359
didn't quite get it right we didn't
 

11981
03:49:33,359 --> 03:49:35,030
didn't quite get it right we didn't
quite get the analogy perfectly right

11982
03:49:35,030 --> 03:49:35,040
quite get the analogy perfectly right
 

11983
03:49:35,040 --> 03:49:37,389
quite get the analogy perfectly right
but it's very close you know just to say

11984
03:49:37,389 --> 03:49:37,399
but it's very close you know just to say
 

11985
03:49:37,399 --> 03:49:39,429
but it's very close you know just to say
in terms of the how these things are

11986
03:49:39,429 --> 03:49:39,439
in terms of the how these things are
 

11987
03:49:39,439 --> 03:49:41,030
in terms of the how these things are
connected so there's another bizarre

11988
03:49:41,030 --> 03:49:41,040
connected so there's another bizarre
 

11989
03:49:41,040 --> 03:49:42,670
connected so there's another bizarre
connection that I I have to mention

11990
03:49:42,670 --> 03:49:42,680
connection that I I have to mention
 

11991
03:49:42,680 --> 03:49:45,269
connection that I I have to mention
because because um um

11992
03:49:45,269 --> 03:49:45,279
because because um um
 

11993
03:49:45,279 --> 03:49:47,149
because because um um
which is uh which again we don't fully

03:49:47,149 --> 03:49:47,159
which is uh which again we don't fully
 

11995

which is uh which again we don't fully
know but it's a connection to uh uh

11996
03:49:50,590 --> 03:49:50,600
know but it's a connection to uh uh
 

11997
03:49:50,600 --> 03:49:51,630

something else you might not have

11998
03:49:51,630 --> 03:49:51,640
something else you might not have
 

11999
03:49:51,640 --> 03:49:52,830
something else you might not have
thought was in the slightest bit

12000
03:49:52,830 --> 03:49:52,840
thought was in the slightest bit
 

12001
03:49:52,840 --> 03:49:54,790
thought was in the slightest bit

03:49:57,229 --> 03:49:57,239
blockchain like things now you might
 

12005
03:49:57,239 --> 03:49:58,670
blockchain like things now you might
figure out that that's you you would

03:49:58,670 --> 03:49:58,680
figure out that that's you you would
 

12007
03:49:58,680 --> 03:50:00,429
figure out that that's you you would
figure out that that's connected because

figure out that that's connected because
 

12009
03:50:00,439 --> 03:50:01,870
figure out that that's connected because
because it's a story of distributed

computing yeah and the issue you know

12012
03:50:03,550 --> 03:50:03,560

12013
03:50:03,560 --> 03:50:05,950

03:50:05,950 --> 03:50:05,960
with a blockchain you're saying there's
 

12015
03:50:05,960 --> 03:50:08,670
with a blockchain you're saying there's
going to be this one Ledger that that

12016
03:50:08,670 --> 03:50:08,680
going to be this one Ledger that that
 

12017
03:50:08,680 --> 03:50:10,510
going to be this one Ledger that that
globally says this is what happened in

know this transaction in country a
 

12027

12032
03:50:27,269 --> 03:50:27,279
for a while and that
 

12033
03:50:27,279 --> 03:50:29,630
for a while and that
story is just like what happens when our

12034
03:50:29,630 --> 03:50:29,640
story is just like what happens when our
 

12035
03:50:29,640 --> 03:50:32,469
story is just like what happens when our
causal graphs that whole reconciliation

12036
03:50:32,469 --> 03:50:32,479
causal graphs that whole reconciliation
 

12037
03:50:32,479 --> 03:50:33,750
causal graphs that whole reconciliation
thing is just like what happens with

12038
03:50:33,750 --> 03:50:33,760
thing is just like what happens with
 

12039
03:50:33,760 --> 03:50:36,110
thing is just like what happens with
light cones and all that's where the

12040
03:50:36,110 --> 03:50:36,120
light cones and all that's where the
 

12041
03:50:36,120 --> 03:50:38,149
light cones and all that's where the
cause in variance comes into play I mean

12042
03:50:38,149 --> 03:50:38,159
cause in variance comes into play I mean
 

12043
03:50:38,159 --> 03:50:39,990
cause in variance comes into play I mean
that that's you know most of your

12044
03:50:39,990 --> 03:50:40,000
that that's you know most of your
 

12045
03:50:40,000 --> 03:50:42,469
that that's you know most of your
conversations are about physics but it's

12046
03:50:42,469 --> 03:50:42,479
conversations are about physics but it's
 

12047
03:50:42,479 --> 03:50:46,309
conversations are about physics but it's
kind of funny that the this probably and

12048
03:50:46,309 --> 03:50:46,319
kind of funny that the this probably and
 

12049
03:50:46,319 --> 03:50:49,469
kind of funny that the this probably and
possibly might have even bigger impact

12050
03:50:49,469 --> 03:50:49,479
possibly might have even bigger impact
 

12051
03:50:49,479 --> 03:50:52,510
possibly might have even bigger impact
and uh revolutionary ideas in totally

12052
03:50:52,510 --> 03:50:52,520
and uh revolutionary ideas in totally
 

12053
03:50:52,520 --> 03:50:55,030
and uh revolutionary ideas in totally
other disciplines right well see see

12054
03:50:55,030 --> 03:50:55,040
other disciplines right well see see
 

12055
03:50:55,040 --> 03:50:56,309
other disciplines right well see see
yeah right so the question is why is

12056
03:50:56,309 --> 03:50:56,319
yeah right so the question is why is
 

12057
03:50:56,319 --> 03:50:58,110
yeah right so the question is why is
that happening right and and the reason

12058
03:50:58,110 --> 03:50:58,120
that happening right and and the reason
 

12059
03:50:58,120 --> 03:51:00,189
that happening right and and the reason
it's happening I I've thought about this

12060
03:51:00,189 --> 03:51:00,199
it's happening I I've thought about this
 

12061
03:51:00,199 --> 03:51:01,710
it's happening I I've thought about this
obviously because I like to think about

12062
03:51:01,710 --> 03:51:01,720
obviously because I like to think about
 

12063
03:51:01,720 --> 03:51:03,950
obviously because I like to think about
these meta questions of you know what's

12064
03:51:03,950 --> 03:51:03,960
these meta questions of you know what's
 

12065
03:51:03,960 --> 03:51:06,429
these meta questions of you know what's
happening is this model that we have is

12066
03:51:06,429 --> 03:51:06,439
happening is this model that we have is
 

12067
03:51:06,439 --> 03:51:09,070
happening is this model that we have is
an incredibly minimal model yeah and

12068
03:51:09,070 --> 03:51:09,080
an incredibly minimal model yeah and
 

12069
03:51:09,080 --> 03:51:10,469
an incredibly minimal model yeah and
once you have an incredibly minimal

12070
03:51:10,469 --> 03:51:10,479
once you have an incredibly minimal
 

12071
03:51:10,479 --> 03:51:12,349
once you have an incredibly minimal
model and this happened with cellular

12072
03:51:12,349 --> 03:51:12,359
model and this happened with cellular
 

12073
03:51:12,359 --> 03:51:14,550
model and this happened with cellular
autometer as well cellular autometer

12074
03:51:14,550 --> 03:51:14,560
autometer as well cellular autometer
 

12075
03:51:14,560 --> 03:51:17,110
autometer as well cellular autometer
inedibly minimal model and so it's

12076
03:51:17,110 --> 03:51:17,120
inedibly minimal model and so it's
 

12077
03:51:17,120 --> 03:51:19,469
inedibly minimal model and so it's
inevitable that it gets you sort of an

12078
03:51:19,469 --> 03:51:19,479
inevitable that it gets you sort of an
 

12079
03:51:19,479 --> 03:51:21,469
inevitable that it gets you sort of an
upstream thing that gets used in lots of

12080
03:51:21,469 --> 03:51:21,479
upstream thing that gets used in lots of
 

12081
03:51:21,479 --> 03:51:23,950
upstream thing that gets used in lots of
different places and it's like you know

12082
03:51:23,950 --> 03:51:23,960
different places and it's like you know
 

12083
03:51:23,960 --> 03:51:25,389
different places and it's like you know
the fact that it gets used you know

12084
03:51:25,389 --> 03:51:25,399
the fact that it gets used you know
 

12085
03:51:25,399 --> 03:51:26,990
the fact that it gets used you know
cellular autometer as sort of a minimal

12086
03:51:26,990 --> 03:51:27,000
cellular autometer as sort of a minimal
 

12087
03:51:27,000 --> 03:51:28,790
cellular autometer as sort of a minimal
model of let's say road traffic flow or

12088
03:51:28,790 --> 03:51:28,800
model of let's say road traffic flow or
 

12089
03:51:28,800 --> 03:51:29,910
model of let's say road traffic flow or
something and they're also a minimal

12090
03:51:29,910 --> 03:51:29,920
something and they're also a minimal
 

12091
03:51:29,920 --> 03:51:31,950
something and they're also a minimal
model of something in you know chemistry

12092
03:51:31,950 --> 03:51:31,960
model of something in you know chemistry
 

12093
03:51:31,960 --> 03:51:33,189
model of something in you know chemistry
and they're also a minimal model of

12094
03:51:33,189 --> 03:51:33,199
and they're also a minimal model of
 

12095
03:51:33,199 --> 03:51:36,070
and they're also a minimal model of
something in in epidemiology right it's

12096
03:51:36,070 --> 03:51:36,080
something in in epidemiology right it's
 

12097
03:51:36,080 --> 03:51:37,590
something in in epidemiology right it's
because they're such a simple model that

12098
03:51:37,590 --> 03:51:37,600
because they're such a simple model that
 

12099
03:51:37,600 --> 03:51:39,070
because they're such a simple model that
they can that they use apply to all

12100
03:51:39,070 --> 03:51:39,080
they can that they use apply to all
 

12101
03:51:39,080 --> 03:51:40,950
they can that they use apply to all
these different things similarly this

12102
03:51:40,950 --> 03:51:40,960
these different things similarly this
 

12103
03:51:40,960 --> 03:51:42,189
these different things similarly this
model that we have with the physics

12104
03:51:42,189 --> 03:51:42,199
model that we have with the physics
 

12105
03:51:42,199 --> 03:51:45,149

it's a cellular autometer are a minimal

12108
03:51:46,990 --> 03:51:47,000
it's a cellular autometer are a minimal
 

12109
03:51:47,000 --> 03:51:49,590
it's a cellular autometer are a minimal
model of parallel of of basically of

12110
03:51:49,590 --> 03:51:49,600
model of parallel of of basically of
 

12111
03:51:49,600 --> 03:51:50,870
model of parallel of of basically of
parallel computation where you've

12112
03:51:50,870 --> 03:51:50,880
parallel computation where you've
 

12113
03:51:50,880 --> 03:51:53,990
parallel computation where you've
defined space and time these models are

12114
03:51:53,990 --> 03:51:54,000
defined space and time these models are
 

12115
03:51:54,000 --> 03:51:55,349
defined space and time these models are
minimal models where you have not

12116
03:51:55,349 --> 03:51:55,359
minimal models where you have not
 

12117
03:51:55,359 --> 03:51:57,750
minimal models where you have not
defined space and time and they have

12118
03:51:57,750 --> 03:51:57,760
defined space and time and they have
 

12119
03:51:57,760 --> 03:52:00,349
defined space and time and they have
been very hard to understand in the past

12120
03:52:00,349 --> 03:52:00,359
been very hard to understand in the past
 

12121
03:52:00,359 --> 03:52:02,750
been very hard to understand in the past
but the I think the perhaps the most

12122
03:52:02,750 --> 03:52:02,760
but the I think the perhaps the most
 

12123
03:52:02,760 --> 03:52:04,750
but the I think the perhaps the most
important breakthrough there is the

12124
03:52:04,750 --> 03:52:04,760
important breakthrough there is the
 

12125
03:52:04,760 --> 03:52:06,429
important breakthrough there is the
realization that these are models of

12126
03:52:06,429 --> 03:52:06,439
realization that these are models of
 

12127
03:52:06,439 --> 03:52:08,790
realization that these are models of
physics and therefore that you can use

12128
03:52:08,790 --> 03:52:08,800
physics and therefore that you can use
 

12129
03:52:08,800 --> 03:52:10,030
physics and therefore that you can use
everything that's been developed in

12130
03:52:10,030 --> 03:52:10,040
everything that's been developed in
 

12131
03:52:10,040 --> 03:52:12,389
everything that's been developed in
physics to get intuition about how

12132
03:52:12,389 --> 03:52:12,399
physics to get intuition about how
 

12133
03:52:12,399 --> 03:52:15,030
physics to get intuition about how
things like that work and that's why you

12134
03:52:15,030 --> 03:52:15,040
things like that work and that's why you
 

12135
03:52:15,040 --> 03:52:17,349
things like that work and that's why you
can potentially use ideas from physics

12136
03:52:17,349 --> 03:52:17,359
can potentially use ideas from physics
 

12137
03:52:17,359 --> 03:52:18,670
can potentially use ideas from physics
to get intuition about how to do

12138
03:52:18,670 --> 03:52:18,680
to get intuition about how to do
 

12139
03:52:18,680 --> 03:52:21,670
to get intuition about how to do
parallel Computing and because the

12140
03:52:21,670 --> 03:52:21,680
parallel Computing and because the
 

12141
03:52:21,680 --> 03:52:25,110
parallel Computing and because the
underlying model is the same and but but

12142
03:52:25,110 --> 03:52:25,120
underlying model is the same and but but
 

12143
03:52:25,120 --> 03:52:26,590
underlying model is the same and but but
we have all of this achievement in

12144
03:52:26,590 --> 03:52:26,600
we have all of this achievement in
 

12145
03:52:26,600 --> 03:52:28,510
we have all of this achievement in
physics I mean you know you might say oh

12146
03:52:28,510 --> 03:52:28,520
physics I mean you know you might say oh
 

12147
03:52:28,520 --> 03:52:29,469
physics I mean you know you might say oh
you've come up with the fundamental

12148
03:52:29,469 --> 03:52:29,479
you've come up with the fundamental
 

12149
03:52:29,479 --> 03:52:31,189
you've come up with the fundamental
Theory of physics that throws out what

12150
03:52:31,189 --> 03:52:31,199
Theory of physics that throws out what
 

12151
03:52:31,199 --> 03:52:32,590
Theory of physics that throws out what
people have done in physics before well

12152
03:52:32,590 --> 03:52:32,600
people have done in physics before well
 

12153
03:52:32,600 --> 03:52:35,790
people have done in physics before well
it doesn't but also the real power is to

12154
03:52:35,790 --> 03:52:35,800
it doesn't but also the real power is to
 

12155
03:52:35,800 --> 03:52:37,790
it doesn't but also the real power is to
use what's been done before in physics

12156
03:52:37,790 --> 03:52:37,800
use what's been done before in physics
 

12157
03:52:37,800 --> 03:52:40,070
use what's been done before in physics
to apply it in these other places yes

12158
03:52:40,070 --> 03:52:40,080
to apply it in these other places yes
 

12159
03:52:40,080 --> 03:52:42,990
to apply it in these other places yes
and absolutely this kind of brings up I

12160
03:52:42,990 --> 03:52:43,000
and absolutely this kind of brings up I
 

12161
03:52:43,000 --> 03:52:45,590
and absolutely this kind of brings up I
know you probably don't

12162
03:52:45,590 --> 03:52:45,600
know you probably don't
 

12163
03:52:45,600 --> 03:52:48,229
know you probably don't

if you're familiar with her she uh she
 

12177
03:53:01,920 --> 03:53:04,910
if you're familiar with her she uh she
wrote this book uh that I need to read

12178

wrote this book uh that I need to read
 

12179
03:53:04,920 --> 03:53:06,950
wrote this book uh that I need to read
but it Bas I forget what the title is

03:53:11,760 --> 03:53:14,030
physics is a subtitle something like
that which so much about what we're

12186
03:53:14,030 --> 03:53:14,040
that which so much about what we're
 

12187
03:53:14,040 --> 03:53:15,870
that which so much about what we're
talking about now like the

12188
03:53:15,870 --> 03:53:15,880
talking about now like the
 

12189
03:53:15,880 --> 03:53:19,630
talking about now like the
simplification is uh to us humans seems

12190
03:53:19,630 --> 03:53:19,640
simplification is uh to us humans seems
 

12191
03:53:19,640 --> 03:53:21,710
simplification is uh to us humans seems
to be beautiful like there's a certain

12192
03:53:21,710 --> 03:53:21,720
to be beautiful like there's a certain
 

12193
03:53:21,720 --> 03:53:24,830
to be beautiful like there's a certain
intuition with physicists with people

12194
03:53:24,830 --> 03:53:24,840
intuition with physicists with people
 

12195
03:53:24,840 --> 03:53:27,189
intuition with physicists with people
that A Simple Theory like this

12196
03:53:27,189 --> 03:53:27,199
that A Simple Theory like this
 

12197
03:53:27,199 --> 03:53:29,189
that A Simple Theory like this
reducibility pockets of reducibility is

12198
03:53:29,189 --> 03:53:29,199
reducibility pockets of reducibility is
 

12199
03:53:29,199 --> 03:53:31,550
reducibility pockets of reducibility is
the ultimate goal and I think what she

12200
03:53:31,550 --> 03:53:31,560
the ultimate goal and I think what she
 

12201
03:53:31,560 --> 03:53:35,349
the ultimate goal and I think what she
tries to argue is uh no we just need to

12202
03:53:35,349 --> 03:53:35,359
tries to argue is uh no we just need to
 

12203
03:53:35,359 --> 03:53:38,229
tries to argue is uh no we just need to
come up with theories that are just

12204
03:53:38,229 --> 03:53:38,239
come up with theories that are just
 

12205
03:53:38,239 --> 03:53:39,710
come up with theories that are just
really good at predicting physical

12206
03:53:39,710 --> 03:53:39,720
really good at predicting physical
 

12207
03:53:39,720 --> 03:53:42,389
really good at predicting physical
phenomena it's okay to have a bunch of

12208
03:53:42,389 --> 03:53:42,399
phenomena it's okay to have a bunch of
 

12209
03:53:42,399 --> 03:53:44,870
phenomena it's okay to have a bunch of
uh disperate theories as as opposed to

12210
03:53:44,870 --> 03:53:44,880
uh disperate theories as as opposed to
 

12211
03:53:44,880 --> 03:53:47,149
uh disperate theories as as opposed to
trying to chase this

12212
03:53:47,149 --> 03:53:47,159
trying to chase this
 

12213
03:53:47,159 --> 03:53:49,309
trying to chase this
beautiful Theory of Everything Is the

beautiful Theory of Everything Is the
 

12215
03:53:49,319 --> 03:53:51,750
beautiful Theory of Everything Is the
ultimate beautiful Theory uh a simple

12216
03:53:51,750 --> 03:53:51,760
ultimate beautiful Theory uh a simple
 

12217
03:53:51,760 --> 03:53:53,830
ultimate beautiful Theory uh a simple
one you know it's always what's your

12218
03:53:53,830 --> 03:53:53,840
one you know it's always what's your
 

12219
03:53:53,840 --> 03:53:55,590
one you know it's always what's your
response to that well so what you're

12220
03:53:55,590 --> 03:53:55,600
response to that well so what you're
 

12221
03:53:55,600 --> 03:53:58,149
response to that well so what you're
quoting so I don't know the Sabine

12222
03:53:58,149 --> 03:53:58,159
quoting so I don't know the Sabine

mean the the question is you know does

12240
03:54:23,309 --> 03:54:23,319
mean the the question is you know does
 

12241
03:54:23,319 --> 03:54:25,349
mean the the question is you know does
is beauty a guide to whether something

12242
03:54:25,349 --> 03:54:25,359
is beauty a guide to whether something
 

12243
03:54:25,359 --> 03:54:27,030
is beauty a guide to whether something
is correct that's right which is kind of

12244
03:54:27,030 --> 03:54:27,040
is correct that's right which is kind of
 

12245
03:54:27,040 --> 03:54:29,110
is correct that's right which is kind of
also the story of aam's Razer you know

12246
03:54:29,110 --> 03:54:29,120
also the story of aam's Razer you know
 

12247
03:54:29,120 --> 03:54:30,110
also the story of aam's Razer you know
if you've got a bunch of different

12248
03:54:30,110 --> 03:54:30,120
if you've got a bunch of different
 

12249
03:54:30,120 --> 03:54:32,630
if you've got a bunch of different
explanations of things you know is the

12250
03:54:32,630 --> 03:54:32,640
explanations of things you know is the
 

12251
03:54:32,640 --> 03:54:34,429
explanations of things you know is the
thing that is the simplest explanation

12252
03:54:34,429 --> 03:54:34,439
thing that is the simplest explanation
 

12253
03:54:34,439 --> 03:54:36,630
thing that is the simplest explanation
likely to be the correct explanation and

12254
03:54:36,630 --> 03:54:36,640
likely to be the correct explanation and
 

12255
03:54:36,640 --> 03:54:37,990
likely to be the correct explanation and
there are situations where that's true

12256
03:54:37,990 --> 03:54:38,000
there are situations where that's true
 

12257
03:54:38,000 --> 03:54:39,309
there are situations where that's true
and there are situations where it isn't

12258
03:54:39,309 --> 03:54:39,319
and there are situations where it isn't
 

12259
03:54:39,319 --> 03:54:41,630
and there are situations where it isn't
true sometimes in human systems it is

12260
03:54:41,630 --> 03:54:41,640
true sometimes in human systems it is
 

12261
03:54:41,640 --> 03:54:42,950
true sometimes in human systems it is
true because people have kind of you

12262
03:54:42,950 --> 03:54:42,960
true because people have kind of you
 

12263
03:54:42,960 --> 03:54:44,710
true because people have kind of you
know in evolutionary systems sometimes

12264
03:54:44,710 --> 03:54:44,720
know in evolutionary systems sometimes
 

12265
03:54:44,720 --> 03:54:46,429
know in evolutionary systems sometimes
it's true because it's sort of been

12266
03:54:46,429 --> 03:54:46,439
it's true because it's sort of been
 

12267
03:54:46,439 --> 03:54:48,830
it's true because it's sort of been
kicked to the point where it's minimized

12268
03:54:48,830 --> 03:54:48,840
kicked to the point where it's minimized
 

12269
03:54:48,840 --> 03:54:51,590
kicked to the point where it's minimized
um but uh you know in physics does

12270
03:54:51,590 --> 03:54:51,600
um but uh you know in physics does
 

12271
03:54:51,600 --> 03:54:54,590
um but uh you know in physics does
Arkham's Razer work you know is there a

12272
03:54:54,590 --> 03:54:54,600
Arkham's Razer work you know is there a
 

12273
03:54:54,600 --> 03:54:56,990
Arkham's Razer work you know is there a
simple quotes beautiful explanation for

12274
03:54:56,990 --> 03:54:57,000
simple quotes beautiful explanation for
 

12275
03:54:57,000 --> 03:54:59,710
simple quotes beautiful explanation for
things or is it a big mess um you know

12276
03:54:59,710 --> 03:54:59,720
things or is it a big mess um you know
 

12277
03:54:59,720 --> 03:55:02,070
things or is it a big mess um you know
we don't intrinsically no you know I

12278
03:55:02,070 --> 03:55:02,080
we don't intrinsically no you know I
 

12279
03:55:02,080 --> 03:55:04,309
we don't intrinsically no you know I
think that the I wouldn't before I

12280
03:55:04,309 --> 03:55:04,319
think that the I wouldn't before I
 

12281
03:55:04,319 --> 03:55:07,429
think that the I wouldn't before I
worked on the project in recent times I

12282
03:55:07,429 --> 03:55:07,439
worked on the project in recent times I
 

12283
03:55:07,439 --> 03:55:09,309
worked on the project in recent times I
would have said we do not know how

12284
03:55:09,309 --> 03:55:09,319
would have said we do not know how
 

12285
03:55:09,319 --> 03:55:10,870
would have said we do not know how
complicated the rule for the universe

12286
03:55:10,870 --> 03:55:10,880
complicated the rule for the universe
 

12287
03:55:10,880 --> 03:55:13,750
complicated the rule for the universe
will be and and I would have said you

12288
03:55:13,750 --> 03:55:13,760
will be and and I would have said you
 

12289
03:55:13,760 --> 03:55:16,309
will be and and I would have said you
know the one thing we know which is a

12290
03:55:16,309 --> 03:55:16,319
know the one thing we know which is a
 

12291
03:55:16,319 --> 03:55:17,950
know the one thing we know which is a
fundamental fact about science that's

12292
03:55:17,950 --> 03:55:17,960
fundamental fact about science that's
 

12293
03:55:17,960 --> 03:55:19,790
fundamental fact about science that's
the thing that makes science possible is

12294
03:55:19,790 --> 03:55:19,800
the thing that makes science possible is
 

12295
03:55:19,800 --> 03:55:21,950
the thing that makes science possible is
that there is order in the universe I

12296
03:55:21,950 --> 03:55:21,960
that there is order in the universe I
 

12297
03:55:21,960 --> 03:55:24,229
that there is order in the universe I
mean you know early theologians would

12298
03:55:24,229 --> 03:55:24,239
mean you know early theologians would
 

12299
03:55:24,239 --> 03:55:25,590
mean you know early theologians would
have used that as an argument for the

12300
03:55:25,590 --> 03:55:25,600
have used that as an argument for the
 

12301
03:55:25,600 --> 03:55:28,149
have used that as an argument for the
existence of God because it's like why

12302
03:55:28,149 --> 03:55:28,159
existence of God because it's like why
 

12303
03:55:28,159 --> 03:55:29,630
existence of God because it's like why
is there order in the universe why

12304
03:55:29,630 --> 03:55:29,640
is there order in the universe why
 

12305
03:55:29,640 --> 03:55:31,110
is there order in the universe why
doesn't every single particle in the

12306
03:55:31,110 --> 03:55:31,120
doesn't every single particle in the
 

12307
03:55:31,120 --> 03:55:33,710
doesn't every single particle in the
universe just do its own thing yeah um

12308
03:55:33,710 --> 03:55:33,720
universe just do its own thing yeah um
 

12309
03:55:33,720 --> 03:55:35,229
universe just do its own thing yeah um
you know something must be making there

12310
03:55:35,229 --> 03:55:35,239
you know something must be making there
 

12311
03:55:35,239 --> 03:55:39,189
you know something must be making there
be order in the universe we you know in

12312
03:55:39,189 --> 03:55:39,199
be order in the universe we you know in
 

12313
03:55:39,199 --> 03:55:41,070
be order in the universe we you know in
in the sort of early theology point of

12314
03:55:41,070 --> 03:55:41,080
in the sort of early theology point of
 

12315
03:55:41,080 --> 03:55:43,550
in the sort of early theology point of
view that's you know the role of God is

12316
03:55:43,550 --> 03:55:43,560
view that's you know the role of God is
 

12317
03:55:43,560 --> 03:55:46,469
view that's you know the role of God is
to do that so to speak in our uh you

12318
03:55:46,469 --> 03:55:46,479
to do that so to speak in our uh you
 

12319
03:55:46,479 --> 03:55:48,309
to do that so to speak in our uh you
know we might say it's the role of a

12320
03:55:48,309 --> 03:55:48,319
know we might say it's the role of a
 

12321
03:55:48,319 --> 03:55:50,510
know we might say it's the role of a
formal Theory to do that and then the

12322
03:55:50,510 --> 03:55:50,520
formal Theory to do that and then the
 

12323
03:55:50,520 --> 03:55:52,149
formal Theory to do that and then the
question is but how simple should that

12324
03:55:52,149 --> 03:55:52,159
question is but how simple should that
 

12325
03:55:52,159 --> 03:55:54,750
question is but how simple should that
theory be and should that theory be one

12326
03:55:54,750 --> 03:55:54,760
theory be and should that theory be one
 

12327
03:55:54,760 --> 03:55:58,990
theory be and should that theory be one
that that you know where I think the

12328
03:55:58,990 --> 03:55:59,000
that that you know where I think the
 

12329
03:55:59,000 --> 03:56:01,149
that that you know where I think the
point is if it's simple it's almost

12330
03:56:01,149 --> 03:56:01,159
point is if it's simple it's almost
 

12331
03:56:01,159 --> 03:56:03,469
point is if it's simple it's almost
inevitably somewhat beautiful in the

12332
03:56:03,469 --> 03:56:03,479
inevitably somewhat beautiful in the
 

12333
03:56:03,479 --> 03:56:06,110
inevitably somewhat beautiful in the
sense that because all the stuff that we

12334
03:56:06,110 --> 03:56:06,120
sense that because all the stuff that we
 

12335
03:56:06,120 --> 03:56:07,870
sense that because all the stuff that we

Theory and the way it does that has to

12338
03:56:10,349 --> 03:56:10,359
Theory and the way it does that has to
 

12339
03:56:10,359 --> 03:56:12,790
Theory and the way it does that has to
be you know it it depends on your notion

12340
03:56:12,790 --> 03:56:12,800
be you know it it depends on your notion
 

12341
03:56:12,800 --> 03:56:16,030
be you know it it depends on your notion
of beauty but I mean in for me the the

12342
03:56:16,030 --> 03:56:16,040
of beauty but I mean in for me the the
 

12343
03:56:16,040 --> 03:56:18,630
of beauty but I mean in for me the the
sort of the surprising con connectivity

12344
03:56:18,630 --> 03:56:18,640
sort of the surprising con connectivity
 

12345
03:56:18,640 --> 03:56:22,269
sort of the surprising con connectivity
of it is at least in my aesthetic that's

12346
03:56:22,269 --> 03:56:22,279
of it is at least in my aesthetic that's
 

12347
03:56:22,279 --> 03:56:24,590
of it is at least in my aesthetic that's
something that uh respond to my

12348
03:56:24,590 --> 03:56:24,600
something that uh respond to my
 

12349
03:56:24,600 --> 03:56:27,149
something that uh respond to my
aesthetic but the question is uh I mean

12350
03:56:27,149 --> 03:56:27,159
aesthetic but the question is uh I mean
 

12351
03:56:27,159 --> 03:56:29,670
aesthetic but the question is uh I mean
you're you you're a fascinating person

12352
03:56:29,670 --> 03:56:29,680
you're you you're a fascinating person
 

12353
03:56:29,680 --> 03:56:32,990
you're you you're a fascinating person
in the sense that you're at once talking

12354
03:56:32,990 --> 03:56:33,000
in the sense that you're at once talking
 

12355
03:56:33,000 --> 03:56:35,030
in the sense that you're at once talking
about computational the fundamental

12356
03:56:35,030 --> 03:56:35,040
about computational the fundamental
 

12357
03:56:35,040 --> 03:56:37,030
about computational the fundamental
computational reducibility of the

12358
03:56:37,030 --> 03:56:37,040
computational reducibility of the
 

12359
03:56:37,040 --> 03:56:40,670
computational reducibility of the
universe and and the other hand trying

12360
03:56:40,670 --> 03:56:40,680
universe and and the other hand trying
 

12361
03:56:40,680 --> 03:56:42,630
universe and and the other hand trying
to come up with a Theory of Everything

12362
03:56:42,630 --> 03:56:42,640
to come up with a Theory of Everything
 

12363
03:56:42,640 --> 03:56:46,830
to come up with a Theory of Everything
which simply describes the

12364
03:56:46,830 --> 03:56:46,840
which simply describes the
 

12365
03:56:46,840 --> 03:56:49,750
which simply describes the
the the simple origins of that

12366
03:56:49,750 --> 03:56:49,760
the the simple origins of that
 

12367
03:56:49,760 --> 03:56:51,750
the the simple origins of that
computational reducibility right I mean

12368
03:56:51,750 --> 03:56:51,760
computational reducibility right I mean
 

12369
03:56:51,760 --> 03:56:53,990
computational reducibility right I mean
both of those things are kind of it's

12370
03:56:53,990 --> 03:56:54,000
both of those things are kind of it's
 

12371
03:56:54,000 --> 03:56:55,790
both of those things are kind of it's
paralyzing to think that we can't make

12372
03:56:55,790 --> 03:56:55,800
paralyzing to think that we can't make
 

12373
03:56:55,800 --> 03:56:57,790
paralyzing to think that we can't make
any sense of the universe in the general

12374
03:56:57,790 --> 03:56:57,800
any sense of the universe in the general
 

12375
03:56:57,800 --> 03:57:01,189
any sense of the universe in the general
case but in it's hopeful to think like

12376
03:57:01,189 --> 03:57:01,199
case but in it's hopeful to think like
 

12377
03:57:01,199 --> 03:57:04,110
case but in it's hopeful to think like
one we can think of a rule and uh that

12378
03:57:04,110 --> 03:57:04,120
one we can think of a rule and uh that
 

12379
03:57:04,120 --> 03:57:06,510
one we can think of a rule and uh that
generates this whole complexity and two

12380
03:57:06,510 --> 03:57:06,520
generates this whole complexity and two
 

12381
03:57:06,520 --> 03:57:10,269
generates this whole complexity and two
we can find uh pockets of uh

12382
03:57:10,269 --> 03:57:10,279
we can find uh pockets of uh
 

12383
03:57:10,279 --> 03:57:12,910
we can find uh pockets of uh
reducibility that are powerful for our

12384
03:57:12,910 --> 03:57:12,920
reducibility that are powerful for our
 

12385
03:57:12,920 --> 03:57:14,790
reducibility that are powerful for our
everyday life to do different kinds of

12386
03:57:14,790 --> 03:57:14,800
everyday life to do different kinds of
 

12387

predictions I suppose sine would wants

12388
03:57:17,990 --> 03:57:18,000
predictions I suppose sine would wants
 

12389
03:57:18,000 --> 03:57:20,910

to find focus on the finding of small

12390
03:57:20,910 --> 03:57:20,920
to find focus on the finding of small
 

12391

Theory of Everything You know it's a

12394
03:57:27,790 --> 03:57:27,800
Theory of Everything You know it's a
 

12395
03:57:27,800 --> 03:57:29,710
Theory of Everything You know it's a
funny thing because because you know a

12396
03:57:29,710 --> 03:57:29,720
funny thing because because you know a
 

12397
03:57:29,720 --> 03:57:31,149
funny thing because because you know a
bunch of people have started working on

12398
03:57:31,149 --> 03:57:31,159
bunch of people have started working on
 

12399
03:57:31,159 --> 03:57:33,189
bunch of people have started working on
this this you know physics project

12400
03:57:33,189 --> 03:57:33,199
this this you know physics project
 

12401
03:57:33,199 --> 03:57:35,389
this this you know physics project
people who are you know physicists

12402
03:57:35,389 --> 03:57:35,399
people who are you know physicists
 

12403
03:57:35,399 --> 03:57:38,269
people who are you know physicists
basically um and it is really a

12404
03:57:38,269 --> 03:57:38,279
basically um and it is really a
 

12405
03:57:38,279 --> 03:57:40,110
basically um and it is really a
fascinating sociological phenomenon

12406
03:57:40,110 --> 03:57:40,120
fascinating sociological phenomenon
 

12407
03:57:40,120 --> 03:57:43,309
fascinating sociological phenomenon
because what you know when I was working

12408
03:57:43,309 --> 03:57:43,319
because what you know when I was working
 

12409
03:57:43,319 --> 03:57:46,229
because what you know when I was working
on this before and the 1990s you know

12410
03:57:46,229 --> 03:57:46,239
on this before and the 1990s you know
 

12411
03:57:46,239 --> 03:57:49,149
on this before and the 1990s you know
wrote it up put it it's 100 pages of

12412
03:57:49,149 --> 03:57:49,159
wrote it up put it it's 100 pages of
 

12413
03:57:49,159 --> 03:57:50,830
wrote it up put it it's 100 pages of
this 1200 page book that I wrote new

12414
03:57:50,830 --> 03:57:50,840
this 1200 page book that I wrote new
 

12415
03:57:50,840 --> 03:57:52,309
this 1200 page book that I wrote new
kind of science it's you know 100 pages

12416
03:57:52,309 --> 03:57:52,319
kind of science it's you know 100 pages
 

12417
03:57:52,319 --> 03:57:55,229
kind of science it's you know 100 pages
of that is about physics right I I saw

12418
03:57:55,229 --> 03:57:55,239
of that is about physics right I I saw
 

12419
03:57:55,239 --> 03:57:58,349
of that is about physics right I I saw
it at in that at that time not as a

12420
03:57:58,349 --> 03:57:58,359
it at in that at that time not as a
 

12421
03:57:58,359 --> 03:58:01,030
it at in that at that time not as a
pinnacle achievement but rather as a use

12422
03:58:01,030 --> 03:58:01,040
pinnacle achievement but rather as a use
 

12423
03:58:01,040 --> 03:58:02,990
pinnacle achievement but rather as a use
case so to speak I mean my main point

12424
03:58:02,990 --> 03:58:03,000
case so to speak I mean my main point
 

12425
03:58:03,000 --> 03:58:04,590
case so to speak I mean my main point
was this new kind of Science and it's

12426
03:58:04,590 --> 03:58:04,600
was this new kind of Science and it's
 

12427
03:58:04,600 --> 03:58:06,389
was this new kind of Science and it's
like you can apply it to biology you can

12428
03:58:06,389 --> 03:58:06,399
like you can apply it to biology you can
 

12429
03:58:06,399 --> 03:58:08,229
like you can apply it to biology you can
apply it to you know other kinds of

12430
03:58:08,229 --> 03:58:08,239
apply it to you know other kinds of
 

12431
03:58:08,239 --> 03:58:09,630
apply it to you know other kinds of
physics you can apply it to fundamental

12432
03:58:09,630 --> 03:58:09,640
physics you can apply it to fundamental
 

12433
03:58:09,640 --> 03:58:11,389
physics you can apply it to fundamental
physics it's just it's just an

12434
03:58:11,389 --> 03:58:11,399
physics it's just it's just an
 

12435
03:58:11,399 --> 03:58:13,670
physics it's just it's just an
application so to speak it's not the

12436
03:58:13,670 --> 03:58:13,680
application so to speak it's not the
 

12437
03:58:13,680 --> 03:58:17,389
application so to speak it's not the
core thing but um but then you know one

12438
03:58:17,389 --> 03:58:17,399
core thing but um but then you know one
 

12439
03:58:17,399 --> 03:58:18,790
core thing but um but then you know one
of the things was interesting with that

12440
03:58:18,790 --> 03:58:18,800
of the things was interesting with that
 

12441
03:58:18,800 --> 03:58:21,790
of the things was interesting with that
with that book was you know book comes

12442
03:58:21,790 --> 03:58:21,800
with that book was you know book comes
 

12443
03:58:21,800 --> 03:58:24,110
with that book was you know book comes
out lots of people think it's pretty

12444
03:58:24,110 --> 03:58:24,120
out lots of people think it's pretty
 

12445
03:58:24,120 --> 03:58:25,750
out lots of people think it's pretty
interesting and lots of people start

12446
03:58:25,750 --> 03:58:25,760
interesting and lots of people start
 

12447
03:58:25,760 --> 03:58:27,309
interesting and lots of people start
using what it has in different kinds of

12448
03:58:27,309 --> 03:58:27,319
using what it has in different kinds of
 

12449
03:58:27,319 --> 03:58:30,149
using what it has in different kinds of
fields the one field where there was

12450
03:58:30,149 --> 03:58:30,159
fields the one field where there was
 

12451
03:58:30,159 --> 03:58:33,070
fields the one field where there was
sort of a a heavy pitchforking was from

12452
03:58:33,070 --> 03:58:33,080
sort of a a heavy pitchforking was from
 

12453
03:58:33,080 --> 03:58:35,269
sort of a a heavy pitchforking was from
my friends the fundamental physics

12454
03:58:35,269 --> 03:58:35,279
my friends the fundamental physics
 

12455
03:58:35,279 --> 03:58:37,790
my friends the fundamental physics
people yeah which was it's like no this

12456
03:58:37,790 --> 03:58:37,800
people yeah which was it's like no this
 

12457
03:58:37,800 --> 03:58:39,309
people yeah which was it's like no this
can't possibly be right and you know

12458
03:58:39,309 --> 03:58:39,319
can't possibly be right and you know
 

12459
03:58:39,319 --> 03:58:41,189
can't possibly be right and you know
it's like you know if what you're doing

12460
03:58:41,189 --> 03:58:41,199
it's like you know if what you're doing
 

12461
03:58:41,199 --> 03:58:43,309
it's like you know if what you're doing
is right it'll overturn 50 years of what

12462
03:58:43,309 --> 03:58:43,319
is right it'll overturn 50 years of what
 

12463
03:58:43,319 --> 03:58:45,469
is right it'll overturn 50 years of what
we've been doing and it's like no it

12464
03:58:45,469 --> 03:58:45,479
we've been doing and it's like no it
 

12465
03:58:45,479 --> 03:58:47,469
we've been doing and it's like no it
won't was what I was saying and it's

12466
03:58:47,469 --> 03:58:47,479
won't was what I was saying and it's
 

12467
03:58:47,479 --> 03:58:51,149
won't was what I was saying and it's
like um but uh you know for a while when

12468
03:58:51,149 --> 03:58:51,159
like um but uh you know for a while when
 

12469
03:58:51,159 --> 03:58:53,030
like um but uh you know for a while when
I started you know I I was going to go

12470
03:58:53,030 --> 03:58:53,040
I started you know I I was going to go
 

12471
03:58:53,040 --> 03:58:56,189
I started you know I I was going to go
on back in 2002 well 2004 actually I was

12472
03:58:56,189 --> 03:58:56,199
on back in 2002 well 2004 actually I was
 

12473
03:58:56,199 --> 03:58:58,630
on back in 2002 well 2004 actually I was
going to go on working on this project

12474
03:58:58,630 --> 03:58:58,640
going to go on working on this project
 

12475
03:58:58,640 --> 03:59:00,790
going to go on working on this project
and I actually stopped partly because

12476
03:59:00,790 --> 03:59:00,800
and I actually stopped partly because
 

12477
03:59:00,800 --> 03:59:04,070
and I actually stopped partly because
it's like why am I you know this is like

12478
03:59:04,070 --> 03:59:04,080
it's like why am I you know this is like
 

12479
03:59:04,080 --> 03:59:05,590
it's like why am I you know this is like
I've been in business a long time right

12480
03:59:05,590 --> 03:59:05,600
I've been in business a long time right
 

12481
03:59:05,600 --> 03:59:07,870
I've been in business a long time right
I'm I'm building a product for a target

12482
03:59:07,870 --> 03:59:07,880
I'm I'm building a product for a target
 

12483
03:59:07,880 --> 03:59:09,990
I'm I'm building a product for a target
market that doesn't want the product and

12484

12485
03:59:10,000 --> 03:59:12,750
market that doesn't want the product and
it's like why work yeah yeah why why

12486
03:59:12,750 --> 03:59:12,760
it's like why work yeah yeah why why
 

12487
03:59:12,760 --> 03:59:14,149
it's like why work yeah yeah why why
work against the swim against the

12488
03:59:14,149 --> 03:59:14,159
work against the swim against the
 

12489
03:59:14,159 --> 03:59:15,710
work against the swim against the
current or whatever but but you see

12490
03:59:15,710 --> 03:59:15,720
current or whatever but but you see
 

12491
03:59:15,720 --> 03:59:16,870
current or whatever but but you see
what's happened which is sort of

12492
03:59:16,870 --> 03:59:16,880
what's happened which is sort of
 

12493
03:59:16,880 --> 03:59:18,710
what's happened which is sort of
interesting is is that so A couple of

12494
03:59:18,710 --> 03:59:18,720
interesting is is that so A couple of
 

12495
03:59:18,720 --> 03:59:22,110
interesting is is that so A couple of
things happened and it was it was like

12496
03:59:22,110 --> 03:59:22,120
things happened and it was it was like
 

12497
03:59:22,120 --> 03:59:24,790
things happened and it was it was like
uh you know it was like I I I don't want

12498
03:59:24,790 --> 03:59:24,800
uh you know it was like I I I don't want
 

12499
03:59:24,800 --> 03:59:27,469
uh you know it was like I I I don't want
to do this project because I can do so

12500
03:59:27,469 --> 03:59:27,479
to do this project because I can do so
 

12501
03:59:27,479 --> 03:59:29,229
to do this project because I can do so
many other things which I'm really

12502
03:59:29,229 --> 03:59:29,239
many other things which I'm really
 

12503
03:59:29,239 --> 03:59:32,950
many other things which I'm really
interested in where you know people say

12504
03:59:32,950 --> 03:59:32,960
interested in where you know people say
 

12505
03:59:32,960 --> 03:59:34,790
interested in where you know people say
great thanks for those tools thanks for

03:59:34,790 --> 03:59:34,800
great thanks for those tools thanks for
 

12507
03:59:34,800 --> 03:59:37,349
great thanks for those tools thanks for
those ideas Etc whereas you know if

12508
03:59:37,349 --> 03:59:37,359
those ideas Etc whereas you know if
 

12509
03:59:37,359 --> 03:59:40,269
those ideas Etc whereas you know if
you're dealing with kind of a a uh you

12510
03:59:40,269 --> 03:59:40,279
you're dealing with kind of a a uh you
 

12511
03:59:40,279 --> 03:59:42,469
you're dealing with kind of a a uh you
know sort of a structure where people

12512
03:59:42,469 --> 03:59:42,479
know sort of a structure where people
 

12513
03:59:42,479 --> 03:59:44,189
know sort of a structure where people
are saying no no we don't want this new

12514
03:59:44,189 --> 03:59:44,199
are saying no no we don't want this new
 

12515
03:59:44,199 --> 03:59:45,670
are saying no no we don't want this new
stuff we don't need any new stuff we're

12516
03:59:45,670 --> 03:59:45,680
stuff we don't need any new stuff we're
 

12517
03:59:45,680 --> 03:59:47,110
stuff we don't need any new stuff we're
really fine with what what we there's

12518
03:59:47,110 --> 03:59:47,120
really fine with what what we there's
 

12519
03:59:47,120 --> 03:59:48,429
really fine with what what we there's
like literally like I don't know

12520
03:59:48,429 --> 03:59:48,439
like literally like I don't know

different crowd than uh the theoretical

12528
03:59:56,830 --> 03:59:56,840
different crowd than uh the theoretical
 

12529
03:59:56,840 --> 03:59:58,309
different crowd than uh the theoretical
physics Community perhaps yeah well

12530
03:59:58,309 --> 03:59:58,319
physics Community perhaps yeah well
 

12531
03:59:58,319 --> 03:59:59,670
physics Community perhaps yeah well
right but you know the theoretical

12532
03:59:59,670 --> 03:59:59,680
right but you know the theoretical
 

12533
03:59:59,680 --> 04:00:00,790
right but you know the theoretical
physics Community pretty much

12534
04:00:00,790 --> 04:00:00,800

uniformally uses uh W from language and
 

12537
04:00:03,479 --> 04:00:05,750
uniformally uses uh W from language and
Mathematica right and so it's it's kind

12538
04:00:05,750 --> 04:00:05,760
Mathematica right and so it's it's kind
 

12539
04:00:05,760 --> 04:00:08,550
Mathematica right and so it's it's kind
of like like um you know and that that's

12540
04:00:08,550 --> 04:00:08,560
of like like um you know and that that's
 

12541
04:00:08,560 --> 04:00:11,309
of like like um you know and that that's
but the thing is what happens you know

12542
04:00:11,309 --> 04:00:11,319
but the thing is what happens you know
 

12543
04:00:11,319 --> 04:00:14,149
but the thing is what happens you know
this is what happens mature fields do

12544
04:00:14,149 --> 04:00:14,159
this is what happens mature fields do
 

12545
04:00:14,159 --> 04:00:16,070
this is what happens mature fields do
not you know it's like we're doing what

12546
04:00:16,070 --> 04:00:16,080
not you know it's like we're doing what
 

12547
04:00:16,080 --> 04:00:17,590
not you know it's like we're doing what
we're doing we have the methods that we

12548
04:00:17,590 --> 04:00:17,600
we're doing we have the methods that we
 

12549
04:00:17,600 --> 04:00:20,670
we're doing we have the methods that we
have and we're we're just fine here now

12550
04:00:20,670 --> 04:00:20,680
have and we're we're just fine here now
 

12551
04:00:20,680 --> 04:00:22,950
have and we're we're just fine here now
what's happened in the last 18 years or

12552
04:00:22,950 --> 04:00:22,960
what's happened in the last 18 years or
 

12553
04:00:22,960 --> 04:00:25,110
what's happened in the last 18 years or
so I think there's a couple of things

12554
04:00:25,110 --> 04:00:25,120
so I think there's a couple of things
 

12555
04:00:25,120 --> 04:00:28,229
so I think there's a couple of things
have happened first of all the the hope

12556
04:00:28,229 --> 04:00:28,239
have happened first of all the the hope
 

12557
04:00:28,239 --> 04:00:30,510
have happened first of all the the hope
that you know String Theory or whatever

12558
04:00:30,510 --> 04:00:30,520
that you know String Theory or whatever
 

12559
04:00:30,520 --> 04:00:31,870
that you know String Theory or whatever
would would deliver the fundamental

12560
04:00:31,870 --> 04:00:31,880
would would deliver the fundamental
 

12561
04:00:31,880 --> 04:00:33,830
would would deliver the fundamental
Theory of physics that hope has

12562
04:00:33,830 --> 04:00:33,840
Theory of physics that hope has
 

12563
04:00:33,840 --> 04:00:36,429
Theory of physics that hope has
disappeared that the another thing

12564
04:00:36,429 --> 04:00:36,439
disappeared that the another thing
 

12565
04:00:36,439 --> 04:00:38,309
disappeared that the another thing
that's happened is the the sort of the

12566
04:00:38,309 --> 04:00:38,319
that's happened is the the sort of the
 

12567
04:00:38,319 --> 04:00:41,229
that's happened is the the sort of the
interest in computation around physics

12568
04:00:41,229 --> 04:00:41,239
interest in computation around physics
 

12569
04:00:41,239 --> 04:00:42,950
interest in computation around physics
has been greatly enhanced by the whole

12570
04:00:42,950 --> 04:00:42,960

12575
04:00:47,359 --> 04:00:48,910

computational uh related to physics is

12578
04:00:51,349 --> 04:00:51,359
computational uh related to physics is
 

12579
04:00:51,359 --> 04:00:54,070
computational uh related to physics is
somehow somehow growing and I think you

12580
04:00:54,070 --> 04:00:54,080
somehow somehow growing and I think you
 

12581
04:00:54,080 --> 04:00:55,990
somehow somehow growing and I think you
know it's it's sort of interesting I

12582
04:00:55,990 --> 04:00:56,000
know it's it's sort of interesting I
 

12583
04:00:56,000 --> 04:00:58,469
know it's it's sort of interesting I
mean right now if we say you know it's

12584
04:00:58,469 --> 04:00:58,479
mean right now if we say you know it's
 

12585
04:00:58,479 --> 04:01:00,550
mean right now if we say you know it's
like if you're like who else is trying

12586
04:01:00,550 --> 04:01:00,560
like if you're like who else is trying
 

12587
04:01:00,560 --> 04:01:01,710
like if you're like who else is trying
to come up with the fundamental Theory

12588
04:01:01,710 --> 04:01:01,720
to come up with the fundamental Theory
 

12589
04:01:01,720 --> 04:01:04,070
to come up with the fundamental Theory
of physics it's like there aren't

12590
04:01:04,070 --> 04:01:04,080
of physics it's like there aren't
 

12591

your uh I mean you've talked with him
but just as a matter of personalities CU

12603
04:01:16,359 --> 04:01:20,070

work I you know I I think his his um I

12604
04:01:20,070 --> 04:01:20,080
work I you know I I think his his um I
 

12605
04:01:20,080 --> 04:01:22,790
work I you know I I think his his um I
mean he did a PhD thesis in mathematical

12606
04:01:22,790 --> 04:01:22,800
mean he did a PhD thesis in mathematical
 

12607
04:01:22,800 --> 04:01:24,110
mean he did a PhD thesis in mathematical
physics at Harvard mathematical

12608

12609
04:01:24,120 --> 04:01:26,229
physics at Harvard mathematical
physicist and and you know

12610
04:01:26,229 --> 04:01:26,239
physicist and and you know
 

12611
04:01:26,239 --> 04:01:29,510
physicist and and you know
it's it seems like it's kind of you know

12612
04:01:29,510 --> 04:01:29,520
it's it seems like it's kind of you know
 

12613
04:01:29,520 --> 04:01:32,229
it's it seems like it's kind of you know
it's in that framework and it's kind of

12614
04:01:32,229 --> 04:01:32,239
it's in that framework and it's kind of
 

12615
04:01:32,239 --> 04:01:34,349
it's in that framework and it's kind of
like I'm not sure how much further it's

12616
04:01:34,349 --> 04:01:34,359
like I'm not sure how much further it's
 

12617
04:01:34,359 --> 04:01:36,910
like I'm not sure how much further it's
got than his PhD thesis which was 20

12618
04:01:36,910 --> 04:01:36,920
got than his PhD thesis which was 20
 

12619
04:01:36,920 --> 04:01:38,950
got than his PhD thesis which was 20
years ago or something and I think that

12620
04:01:38,950 --> 04:01:38,960
years ago or something and I think that
 

12621
04:01:38,960 --> 04:01:41,710
years ago or something and I think that
you know the the you know it's a fairly

12622
04:01:41,710 --> 04:01:41,720
you know the the you know it's a fairly
 

12623
04:01:41,720 --> 04:01:43,990
you know the the you know it's a fairly
specific piece of mathematical physics

12624
04:01:43,990 --> 04:01:44,000
specific piece of mathematical physics
 

12625
04:01:44,000 --> 04:01:46,670
specific piece of mathematical physics
that's quite nice and um what trajectory

12626
04:01:46,670 --> 04:01:46,680
that's quite nice and um what trajectory
 

12627
04:01:46,680 --> 04:01:49,349
that's quite nice and um what trajectory
do you hope it takes I mean well I think

12628
04:01:49,349 --> 04:01:49,359
do you hope it takes I mean well I think
 

12629
04:01:49,359 --> 04:01:50,990
do you hope it takes I mean well I think
in his particular case I mean from what

12630
04:01:50,990 --> 04:01:51,000
in his particular case I mean from what
 

12631
04:01:51,000 --> 04:01:52,790
in his particular case I mean from what
I understand which is not everything at

12632
04:01:52,790 --> 04:01:52,800
I understand which is not everything at
 

12633
04:01:52,800 --> 04:01:54,229
I understand which is not everything at
all but you know I think I know the

12634
04:01:54,229 --> 04:01:54,239
all but you know I think I know the
 

12635
04:01:54,239 --> 04:01:56,510
all but you know I think I know the
rough Tradition at least he's operating

12636
04:01:56,510 --> 04:01:56,520
rough Tradition at least he's operating
 

12637
04:01:56,520 --> 04:01:59,189
rough Tradition at least he's operating
in is sort of theory gauge theories

12638
04:01:59,189 --> 04:01:59,199
in is sort of theory gauge theories
 

12639
04:01:59,199 --> 04:02:00,510
in is sort of theory gauge theories
gauge theories yeah local gauge and

12640
04:02:00,510 --> 04:02:00,520
gauge theories yeah local gauge and
 

12641
04:02:00,520 --> 04:02:02,830
gauge theories yeah local gauge and
variance and so on okay we are very

12642
04:02:02,830 --> 04:02:02,840
variance and so on okay we are very
 

12643
04:02:02,840 --> 04:02:04,950
variance and so on okay we are very
close to understanding how local gauge

12644
04:02:04,950 --> 04:02:04,960
close to understanding how local gauge
 

12645
04:02:04,960 --> 04:02:06,469
close to understanding how local gauge
and variance Works in our models and

12646
04:02:06,469 --> 04:02:06,479
and variance Works in our models and
 

12647
04:02:06,479 --> 04:02:10,070
and variance Works in our models and
it's very beautiful and it's very um and

12648
04:02:10,070 --> 04:02:10,080
it's very beautiful and it's very um and
 

12649
04:02:10,080 --> 04:02:11,950
it's very beautiful and it's very um and
you know does some of the mathematical

12650
04:02:11,950 --> 04:02:11,960
you know does some of the mathematical
 

12651
04:02:11,960 --> 04:02:14,030
you know does some of the mathematical
structure that he's enthusiastic about

12652
04:02:14,030 --> 04:02:14,040
structure that he's enthusiastic about
 

12653
04:02:14,040 --> 04:02:16,510
structure that he's enthusiastic about
fit quite possibly yes so there might be

12654
04:02:16,510 --> 04:02:16,520
fit quite possibly yes so there might be
 

12655
04:02:16,520 --> 04:02:17,910
fit quite possibly yes so there might be
a possibility of trying to understand

12656
04:02:17,910 --> 04:02:17,920
a possibility of trying to understand
 

12657
04:02:17,920 --> 04:02:19,670
a possibility of trying to understand
how those things fit how gauge Theory

12658
04:02:19,670 --> 04:02:19,680
how those things fit how gauge Theory
 

12659
04:02:19,680 --> 04:02:22,269
how those things fit how gauge Theory
fits well the question is you know so

12660
04:02:22,269 --> 04:02:22,279
fits well the question is you know so
 

12661
04:02:22,279 --> 04:02:23,269
fits well the question is you know so
there are a couple of things one might

12662
04:02:23,269 --> 04:02:23,279
there are a couple of things one might
 

12663
04:02:23,279 --> 04:02:25,389
there are a couple of things one might
try to get in the world so for example

12664
04:02:25,389 --> 04:02:25,399
try to get in the world so for example
 

12665
04:02:25,399 --> 04:02:26,950
try to get in the world so for example
it's like can we get three dimensions of

12666
04:02:26,950 --> 04:02:26,960
it's like can we get three dimensions of
 

12667
04:02:26,960 --> 04:02:29,030
it's like can we get three dimensions of
space we haven't managed to get that yet

12668
04:02:29,030 --> 04:02:29,040
space we haven't managed to get that yet
 

12669
04:02:29,040 --> 04:02:31,070
space we haven't managed to get that yet
gauge Theory the standard model of

12670
04:02:31,070 --> 04:02:31,080
gauge Theory the standard model of
 

12671
04:02:31,080 --> 04:02:33,830
gauge Theory the standard model of
particle physics says that it's su3

12672
04:02:33,830 --> 04:02:33,840
particle physics says that it's su3
 

12673
04:02:33,840 --> 04:02:36,309
particle physics says that it's su3
cross su2 cross U1 those are the

12674
04:02:36,309 --> 04:02:36,319
cross su2 cross U1 those are the
 

12675
04:02:36,319 --> 04:02:40,309
cross su2 cross U1 those are the
designations of these um Le groups um it

12676
04:02:40,309 --> 04:02:40,319
designations of these um Le groups um it
 

12677
04:02:40,319 --> 04:02:42,309
designations of these um Le groups um it
doesn't but but anyway so those are

12678
04:02:42,309 --> 04:02:42,319
doesn't but but anyway so those are
 

12679
04:02:42,319 --> 04:02:44,349
doesn't but but anyway so those are
those are sort of representations of

12680
04:02:44,349 --> 04:02:44,359
those are sort of representations of
 

12681
04:02:44,359 --> 04:02:48,189
those are sort of representations of
symmetries of the theory and um so you

12682
04:02:48,189 --> 04:02:48,199
symmetries of the theory and um so you
 

12683
04:02:48,199 --> 04:02:50,990
symmetries of the theory and um so you
know it is conceivable that it is

12684
04:02:50,990 --> 04:02:51,000
know it is conceivable that it is
 

12685
04:02:51,000 --> 04:02:53,870
know it is conceivable that it is
generically true okay so all those are

12686
04:02:53,870 --> 04:02:53,880
generically true okay so all those are
 

12687
04:02:53,880 --> 04:02:55,790
generically true okay so all those are
subgroups of a group called E8 which is

12688
04:02:55,790 --> 04:02:55,800
subgroups of a group called E8 which is
 

12689
04:02:55,800 --> 04:03:00,070
subgroups of a group called E8 which is
a weird exceptional Le group okay it is

12690
04:03:00,070 --> 04:03:00,080
a weird exceptional Le group okay it is
 

12691
04:03:00,080 --> 04:03:01,349
a weird exceptional Le group okay it is
conceivable I don't know whether it's

12692
04:03:01,349 --> 04:03:01,359
conceivable I don't know whether it's
 

12693
04:03:01,359 --> 04:03:04,269
conceivable I don't know whether it's
the case that that will be generic in

12694
04:03:04,269 --> 04:03:04,279
the case that that will be generic in
 

12695
04:03:04,279 --> 04:03:07,030
the case that that will be generic in
these models that it will be generic

12696
04:03:07,030 --> 04:03:07,040
these models that it will be generic
 

12697
04:03:07,040 --> 04:03:11,389
these models that it will be generic
that the gaug and variance of the model

12698
04:03:11,389 --> 04:03:11,399
that the gaug and variance of the model
 

12699
04:03:11,399 --> 04:03:13,910
that the gaug and variance of the model
has this property just as things like

12700
04:03:13,910 --> 04:03:13,920
has this property just as things like
 

12701
04:03:13,920 --> 04:03:17,590
has this property just as things like
general relativity which corresponds to

12702
04:03:17,590 --> 04:03:17,600
general relativity which corresponds to
 

12703
04:03:17,600 --> 04:03:20,950
general relativity which corresponds to
thing called U general covariance which

12704
04:03:20,950 --> 04:03:20,960
thing called U general covariance which
 

12705
04:03:20,960 --> 04:03:24,389
thing called U general covariance which
is another GA like invariance it could

12706
04:03:24,389 --> 04:03:24,399
is another GA like invariance it could
 

12707
04:03:24,399 --> 04:03:26,590
is another GA like invariance it could
conceivably be the case that the kind of

12708
04:03:26,590 --> 04:03:26,600
conceivably be the case that the kind of
 

12709
04:03:26,600 --> 04:03:28,550
conceivably be the case that the kind of
local gauge invariance that we see in

12710
04:03:28,550 --> 04:03:28,560
local gauge invariance that we see in
 

12711
04:03:28,560 --> 04:03:31,630
local gauge invariance that we see in
particle physics is somehow generic and

12712
04:03:31,630 --> 04:03:31,640
particle physics is somehow generic and
 

12713
04:03:31,640 --> 04:03:33,389
particle physics is somehow generic and
and that would be a you know the thing

12714
04:03:33,389 --> 04:03:33,399
and that would be a you know the thing
 

12715
04:03:33,399 --> 04:03:35,830
and that would be a you know the thing
that's that's really cool I think you

12716
04:03:35,830 --> 04:03:35,840
that's that's really cool I think you
 

12717
04:03:35,840 --> 04:03:37,389
that's that's really cool I think you
know sociologically although this hasn't

12718
04:03:37,389 --> 04:03:37,399
know sociologically although this hasn't
 

12719
04:03:37,399 --> 04:03:40,070
know sociologically although this hasn't
really hit yet is that all of these

12720
04:03:40,070 --> 04:03:40,080
really hit yet is that all of these
 

12721
04:03:40,080 --> 04:03:41,110
really hit yet is that all of these
different things all these different

12722
04:03:41,110 --> 04:03:41,120
different things all these different
 

12723
04:03:41,120 --> 04:03:42,469
different things all these different
things people have been working on in

12724
04:03:42,469 --> 04:03:42,479
things people have been working on in
 

12725
04:03:42,479 --> 04:03:45,309
things people have been working on in
these in some cases is quite abstruse

12726
04:03:45,309 --> 04:03:45,319
these in some cases is quite abstruse
 

12727
04:03:45,319 --> 04:03:47,630
these in some cases is quite abstruse
areas of mathematical physics an awful

12728
04:03:47,630 --> 04:03:47,640
areas of mathematical physics an awful
 

12729
04:03:47,640 --> 04:03:49,349
areas of mathematical physics an awful
lot of them seem to tie into what we're

12730
04:03:49,349 --> 04:03:49,359
lot of them seem to tie into what we're
 

12731
04:03:49,359 --> 04:03:51,510
lot of them seem to tie into what we're
doing and you know it might not be that

12732
04:03:51,510 --> 04:03:51,520
doing and you know it might not be that
 

12733
04:03:51,520 --> 04:03:53,349
doing and you know it might not be that
way yeah absolutely that's a beautiful

12734
04:03:53,349 --> 04:03:53,359
way yeah absolutely that's a beautiful
 

12735
04:03:53,359 --> 04:03:55,070
way yeah absolutely that's a beautiful
thing in the theory I mean but the

12736
04:03:55,070 --> 04:03:55,080
thing in the theory I mean but the
 

12737
04:03:55,080 --> 04:03:57,630
thing in the theory I mean but the
reason I so the reason Eric Weinstein is

12738
04:03:57,630 --> 04:03:57,640
reason I so the reason Eric Weinstein is
 

12739
04:03:57,640 --> 04:03:59,750
reason I so the reason Eric Weinstein is
important is to the point that you

12740
04:03:59,750 --> 04:03:59,760
important is to the point that you
 

12741
04:03:59,760 --> 04:04:02,469
important is to the point that you
mentioned before which is it's strange

12742
04:04:02,469 --> 04:04:02,479
mentioned before which is it's strange
 

12743
04:04:02,479 --> 04:04:06,030
mentioned before which is it's strange
that The Theory of Everything Is Not at

you know the world is made of platonic

12760
04:04:25,790 --> 04:04:25,800
you know the world is made of platonic
 

12761
04:04:25,800 --> 04:04:27,349
you know the world is made of platonic
solids it's you know water is a

12765
04:04:29,239 --> 04:04:31,990

12778
04:04:46,149 --> 04:04:46,159
is Fields everything is The Ether you
 

12779
04:04:46,159 --> 04:04:48,710
is Fields everything is The Ether you
know then the whole time we're making

12780
04:04:48,710 --> 04:04:48,720
know then the whole time we're making
 

12781
04:04:48,720 --> 04:04:51,189
know then the whole time we're making
big progress though oh yes absolutely

12782
04:04:51,189 --> 04:04:51,199
big progress though oh yes absolutely
 

12783
04:04:51,199 --> 04:04:53,349
big progress though oh yes absolutely
but the fundamental Theory of physics is

12784

but the fundamental Theory of physics is
 

12785
04:04:53,359 --> 04:04:56,469
but the fundamental Theory of physics is
almost a footnote because it's like it's

12786
04:04:56,469 --> 04:04:56,479
almost a footnote because it's like it's
 

12787
04:04:56,479 --> 04:04:58,469
almost a footnote because it's like it's
the machine code it's like we're

12788
04:04:58,469 --> 04:04:58,479
the machine code it's like we're
 

12789
04:04:58,479 --> 04:05:00,309
the machine code it's like we're
operating in the high level languages

12790
04:05:00,309 --> 04:05:00,319
operating in the high level languages
 

12791
04:05:00,319 --> 04:05:02,110
operating in the high level languages
yeah um you know that's what we really

12792
04:05:02,110 --> 04:05:02,120
yeah um you know that's what we really
 

12793
04:05:02,120 --> 04:05:03,510
yeah um you know that's what we really
care about that's what's relevant for

12794
04:05:03,510 --> 04:05:03,520
care about that's what's relevant for
 

12795
04:05:03,520 --> 04:05:05,229
care about that's what's relevant for
our everyday physics you talked about

12796
04:05:05,229 --> 04:05:05,239
our everyday physics you talked about
 

12797
04:05:05,239 --> 04:05:07,070
our everyday physics you talked about
different centuries and the 21st century

12798
04:05:07,070 --> 04:05:07,080
different centuries and the 21st century
 

12799
04:05:07,080 --> 04:05:10,229
different centuries and the 21st century
will be uh everything is computation yes

12800
04:05:10,229 --> 04:05:10,239
will be uh everything is computation yes
 

12801
04:05:10,239 --> 04:05:11,950
will be uh everything is computation yes
if that takes us all the way we don't

12802
04:05:11,950 --> 04:05:11,960
if that takes us all the way we don't
 

12803
04:05:11,960 --> 04:05:14,590
if that takes us all the way we don't
know but it might take us pretty far yes

12804
04:05:14,590 --> 04:05:14,600
know but it might take us pretty far yes
 

12805
04:05:14,600 --> 04:05:16,070
know but it might take us pretty far yes
right that's right and but I think the

12806
04:05:16,070 --> 04:05:16,080
right that's right and but I think the
 

12807
04:05:16,080 --> 04:05:17,670
right that's right and but I think the
point is that it's like you know if

12808
04:05:17,670 --> 04:05:17,680
point is that it's like you know if
 

12809
04:05:17,680 --> 04:05:19,550
point is that it's like you know if
you're doing biology you might say how

12810
04:05:19,550 --> 04:05:19,560
you're doing biology you might say how
 

12811
04:05:19,560 --> 04:05:20,990
you're doing biology you might say how
can you not be really interested in the

12812
04:05:20,990 --> 04:05:21,000
can you not be really interested in the
 

12813
04:05:21,000 --> 04:05:22,870
can you not be really interested in the
origin of life and the definition of

12814
04:05:22,870 --> 04:05:22,880
origin of life and the definition of
 

12815
04:05:22,880 --> 04:05:24,469
origin of life and the definition of
life well it's irrelevant you know

12816
04:05:24,469 --> 04:05:24,479
life well it's irrelevant you know
 

12817
04:05:24,479 --> 04:05:25,990
life well it's irrelevant you know
you're studying the properties of some

12818
04:05:25,990 --> 04:05:26,000
you're studying the properties of some
 

12819
04:05:26,000 --> 04:05:28,349
you're studying the properties of some
virus it doesn't matter you know where

12820
04:05:28,349 --> 04:05:28,359
virus it doesn't matter you know where
 

12821
04:05:28,359 --> 04:05:30,189
virus it doesn't matter you know where
you know you're you're operating at some

12822
04:05:30,189 --> 04:05:30,199
you know you're you're operating at some
 

12823
04:05:30,199 --> 04:05:32,510
you know you're you're operating at some
much higher level and it's the same what

12824
04:05:32,510 --> 04:05:32,520
much higher level and it's the same what
 

12825
04:05:32,520 --> 04:05:35,149
much higher level and it's the same what
what's happened with physics is I was

12826
04:05:35,149 --> 04:05:35,159
what's happened with physics is I was
 

12827
04:05:35,159 --> 04:05:36,469
what's happened with physics is I was
sort of surprised actually I was sort of

12828
04:05:36,469 --> 04:05:36,479
sort of surprised actually I was sort of
 

12829
04:05:36,479 --> 04:05:38,950
sort of surprised actually I was sort of
mapping out this history of of people's

12830
04:05:38,950 --> 04:05:38,960
mapping out this history of of people's
 

12831
04:05:38,960 --> 04:05:40,590
mapping out this history of of people's
efforts to understand the fundamental

12832
04:05:40,590 --> 04:05:40,600
efforts to understand the fundamental
 

12833
04:05:40,600 --> 04:05:42,910
efforts to understand the fundamental
Theory of physics and it's remarkable

12834
04:05:42,910 --> 04:05:42,920
Theory of physics and it's remarkable
 

12835
04:05:42,920 --> 04:05:44,990
Theory of physics and it's remarkable
how little has been done on this

12836
04:05:44,990 --> 04:05:45,000
how little has been done on this
 

12837
04:05:45,000 --> 04:05:47,469
how little has been done on this
question and it's you know because you

12838
04:05:47,469 --> 04:05:47,479
question and it's you know because you
 

12839
04:05:47,479 --> 04:05:48,670
question and it's you know because you
know there have been times when there's

12840
04:05:48,670 --> 04:05:48,680
know there have been times when there's
 

12841
04:05:48,680 --> 04:05:50,229
know there have been times when there's
been bursts of enthusiasm and we're

12842
04:05:50,229 --> 04:05:50,239
been bursts of enthusiasm and we're
 

12843
04:05:50,239 --> 04:05:53,309
been bursts of enthusiasm and we're
almost there and and then it decays and

12844
04:05:53,309 --> 04:05:53,319
almost there and and then it decays and
 

12845
04:05:53,319 --> 04:05:56,269
almost there and and then it decays and
and people just say oh it's too hard but

12846
04:05:56,269 --> 04:05:56,279
and people just say oh it's too hard but
 

12847
04:05:56,279 --> 04:05:58,269
and people just say oh it's too hard but
it's not relevant anyway and I think

12848
04:05:58,269 --> 04:05:58,279
it's not relevant anyway and I think
 

12849
04:05:58,279 --> 04:06:01,710
it's not relevant anyway and I think
that the um the thing that um you know

12850
04:06:01,710 --> 04:06:01,720
that the um the thing that um you know
 

12851
04:06:01,720 --> 04:06:04,870
that the um the thing that um you know
so so the question of of you know one

12852
04:06:04,870 --> 04:06:04,880
so so the question of of you know one
 

12853
04:06:04,880 --> 04:06:06,469
so so the question of of you know one
question is why does anybody why should

12854
04:06:06,469 --> 04:06:06,479
question is why does anybody why should
 

12855
04:06:06,479 --> 04:06:08,750
question is why does anybody why should
anybody care right why should anybody

12856
04:06:08,750 --> 04:06:08,760
anybody care right why should anybody
 

12857
04:06:08,760 --> 04:06:09,950
anybody care right why should anybody
care what the fundamental Theory of

12858
04:06:09,950 --> 04:06:09,960
care what the fundamental Theory of
 

12859
04:06:09,960 --> 04:06:12,189
care what the fundamental Theory of
physics is I think it's intellectually

12860
04:06:12,189 --> 04:06:12,199
physics is I think it's intellectually
 

12861
04:06:12,199 --> 04:06:14,750
physics is I think it's intellectually
interesting but what will be the sort of

12862
04:06:14,750 --> 04:06:14,760
interesting but what will be the sort of
 

12863
04:06:14,760 --> 04:06:16,910
interesting but what will be the sort of
what will be the impact of this what I

12864
04:06:16,910 --> 04:06:16,920
what will be the impact of this what I
 

12865
04:06:16,920 --> 04:06:19,070
what will be the impact of this what I
mean this is the key question what do

12866
04:06:19,070 --> 04:06:19,080
mean this is the key question what do
 

12867
04:06:19,080 --> 04:06:22,590
mean this is the key question what do
you think will happen if we figure out

12868
04:06:22,590 --> 04:06:22,600
you think will happen if we figure out
 

12869
04:06:22,600 --> 04:06:25,710
you think will happen if we figure out
the fundamental Theory of physics right

12870
04:06:25,710 --> 04:06:25,720
the fundamental Theory of physics right
 

12871
04:06:25,720 --> 04:06:28,189
the fundamental Theory of physics right
outside of the intellectual curiosity of

12872
04:06:28,189 --> 04:06:28,199
outside of the intellectual curiosity of
 

12873
04:06:28,199 --> 04:06:31,630
outside of the intellectual curiosity of
us this my best guess okay so if you

12874
04:06:31,630 --> 04:06:31,640
us this my best guess okay so if you
 

12875
04:06:31,640 --> 04:06:34,429
us this my best guess okay so if you
look at the history of science I think a

12876
04:06:34,429 --> 04:06:34,439
look at the history of science I think a
 

12877
04:06:34,439 --> 04:06:36,389
look at the history of science I think a
very interesting analogy is

12878
04:06:36,389 --> 04:06:36,399
very interesting analogy is
 

12879
04:06:36,399 --> 04:06:39,830
very interesting analogy is
cernus okay so what did cernus do there

12880
04:06:39,830 --> 04:06:39,840
cernus okay so what did cernus do there
 

12881
04:06:39,840 --> 04:06:41,590
cernus okay so what did cernus do there
had been this toic system for working

12882
04:06:41,590 --> 04:06:41,600
had been this toic system for working
 

12883
04:06:41,600 --> 04:06:43,910
had been this toic system for working
out the motion of planets it did pretty

12884
04:06:43,910 --> 04:06:43,920
out the motion of planets it did pretty
 

12885
04:06:43,920 --> 04:06:47,149
out the motion of planets it did pretty
well it used epicycles etc etc etc it

12886
04:06:47,149 --> 04:06:47,159
well it used epicycles etc etc etc it
 

12887
04:06:47,159 --> 04:06:49,349
well it used epicycles etc etc etc it
had all this computational ways of

12888
04:06:49,349 --> 04:06:49,359
had all this computational ways of
 

12889
04:06:49,359 --> 04:06:51,269
had all this computational ways of
working out where planets will be when

12890
04:06:51,269 --> 04:06:51,279
working out where planets will be when
 

12891
04:06:51,279 --> 04:06:52,670
working out where planets will be when
we work out where planets are today

12892
04:06:52,670 --> 04:06:52,680
we work out where planets are today
 

12893
04:06:52,680 --> 04:06:54,990
we work out where planets are today
we're basically using epicycles but

12894
04:06:54,990 --> 04:06:55,000
we're basically using epicycles but
 

12895
04:06:55,000 --> 04:06:56,590
we're basically using epicycles but
cernus had this different way of

12896
04:06:56,590 --> 04:06:56,600
cernus had this different way of
 

12897
04:06:56,600 --> 04:06:59,670
cernus had this different way of
formulating things in which he said you

12898
04:06:59,670 --> 04:06:59,680
formulating things in which he said you
 

12899
04:06:59,680 --> 04:07:01,990
formulating things in which he said you
know and the Earth is going around the

12900
04:07:01,990 --> 04:07:02,000
know and the Earth is going around the
 

12901
04:07:02,000 --> 04:07:04,269
know and the Earth is going around the
Sun and that had a consequence the

12902
04:07:04,269 --> 04:07:04,279
Sun and that had a consequence the
 

12903
04:07:04,279 --> 04:07:06,309
Sun and that had a consequence the
consequence was you can use this

12904
04:07:06,309 --> 04:07:06,319
consequence was you can use this
 

12905
04:07:06,319 --> 04:07:08,790
consequence was you can use this
mathematical Theory to conclude

12906
04:07:08,790 --> 04:07:08,800
mathematical Theory to conclude
 

12907
04:07:08,800 --> 04:07:10,830
mathematical Theory to conclude
something which is absolutely not what

12908
04:07:10,830 --> 04:07:10,840
something which is absolutely not what
 

12909
04:07:10,840 --> 04:07:13,750
something which is absolutely not what
we can tell from common sense

12910
04:07:13,750 --> 04:07:13,760
we can tell from common sense
 

12911
04:07:13,760 --> 04:07:15,950
we can tell from common sense
right so it's like trust the mathematics

12912
04:07:15,950 --> 04:07:15,960
right so it's like trust the mathematics
 

12913
04:07:15,960 --> 04:07:19,550
right so it's like trust the mathematics
trust the science okay now fast forward

12914
04:07:19,550 --> 04:07:19,560
trust the science okay now fast forward
 

12915
04:07:19,560 --> 04:07:22,710
trust the science okay now fast forward
400 years and um you know and now we're

12916
04:07:22,710 --> 04:07:22,720
400 years and um you know and now we're
 

12917
04:07:22,720 --> 04:07:24,870
400 years and um you know and now we're
in this pandemic and it's kind of like

12918
04:07:24,870 --> 04:07:24,880
in this pandemic and it's kind of like
 

12919
04:07:24,880 --> 04:07:26,870
in this pandemic and it's kind of like
everybody thinks the science will figure

12920
04:07:26,870 --> 04:07:26,880
everybody thinks the science will figure
 

12921
04:07:26,880 --> 04:07:29,630
everybody thinks the science will figure
out everything it's like from the

12922
04:07:29,630 --> 04:07:29,640
out everything it's like from the
 

12923
04:07:29,640 --> 04:07:31,109
out everything it's like from the
science we can just figure out what to

12924
04:07:31,109 --> 04:07:31,119
science we can just figure out what to
 

12925
04:07:31,119 --> 04:07:33,510
science we can just figure out what to
do we can figure out everything that was

12926
04:07:33,510 --> 04:07:33,520
do we can figure out everything that was
 

12927
04:07:33,520 --> 04:07:36,149
do we can figure out everything that was
before cernus nobody would have thought

12928
04:07:36,149 --> 04:07:36,159
before cernus nobody would have thought
 

12929
04:07:36,159 --> 04:07:37,950
before cernus nobody would have thought
if the science says something that

12930
04:07:37,950 --> 04:07:37,960
if the science says something that
 

12931
04:07:37,960 --> 04:07:39,790
if the science says something that
doesn't agree with our everyday

12932
04:07:39,790 --> 04:07:39,800
doesn't agree with our everyday
 

12933
04:07:39,800 --> 04:07:41,910
doesn't agree with our everyday
experience where we just have to you

12934
04:07:41,910 --> 04:07:41,920
experience where we just have to you
 

12935
04:07:41,920 --> 04:07:43,670
experience where we just have to you
know compute the science and then figure

12936
04:07:43,670 --> 04:07:43,680
know compute the science and then figure
 

12937
04:07:43,680 --> 04:07:45,030
know compute the science and then figure
out what to do people say that's

12938
04:07:45,030 --> 04:07:45,040
out what to do people say that's
 

12939
04:07:45,040 --> 04:07:47,590
out what to do people say that's
completely crazy and so your sense is

12940
04:07:47,590 --> 04:07:47,600
completely crazy and so your sense is
 

12941
04:07:47,600 --> 04:07:49,269
completely crazy and so your sense is
once we figure out the framework of

12942
04:07:49,269 --> 04:07:49,279
once we figure out the framework of
 

12943
04:07:49,279 --> 04:07:52,109
once we figure out the framework of
computation that can basically do any

12944
04:07:52,109 --> 04:07:52,119
computation that can basically do any
 

12945
04:07:52,119 --> 04:07:53,750
computation that can basically do any
understand the the fabric of reality

12946
04:07:53,750 --> 04:07:53,760
understand the the fabric of reality
 

12947
04:07:53,760 --> 04:07:55,229
understand the the fabric of reality
will be able

12948
04:07:55,229 --> 04:07:55,239
will be able
 

12949
04:07:55,239 --> 04:07:58,189
will be able
to derive totally counterintuitive

12950
04:07:58,189 --> 04:07:58,199
to derive totally counterintuitive
 

12951
04:07:58,199 --> 04:08:00,590
to derive totally counterintuitive
things no the the the point I think is

12952
04:08:00,590 --> 04:08:00,600
things no the the the point I think is
 

12953
04:08:00,600 --> 04:08:02,670
things no the the the point I think is
the following that that right now you

12954
04:08:02,670 --> 04:08:02,680
the following that that right now you
 

12955
04:08:02,680 --> 04:08:04,790
the following that that right now you
know I talk about computational

12956
04:08:04,790 --> 04:08:04,800
know I talk about computational
 

12957
04:08:04,800 --> 04:08:07,189
know I talk about computational
irreducibility people you know I was was

12958
04:08:07,189 --> 04:08:07,199
irreducibility people you know I was was
 

12959
04:08:07,199 --> 04:08:08,590
irreducibility people you know I was was
very proud that I managed to get the

12960
04:08:08,590 --> 04:08:08,600
very proud that I managed to get the
 

12961
04:08:08,600 --> 04:08:10,309
very proud that I managed to get the
term computational irreducibility into

12962
04:08:10,309 --> 04:08:10,319
term computational irreducibility into
 

12963
04:08:10,319 --> 04:08:13,109
term computational irreducibility into
the Congressional record last year um

12964
04:08:13,109 --> 04:08:13,119
the Congressional record last year um
 

12965
04:08:13,119 --> 04:08:14,469
the Congressional record last year um
that's right that's a whole another

12966
04:08:14,469 --> 04:08:14,479
that's right that's a whole another
 

12967
04:08:14,479 --> 04:08:16,229
that's right that's a whole another
topic we could talk about different

12968
04:08:16,229 --> 04:08:16,239
topic we could talk about different
 

12969
04:08:16,239 --> 04:08:17,990
topic we could talk about different
different topic different different

12970
04:08:17,990 --> 04:08:18,000
different topic different different
 

12971
04:08:18,000 --> 04:08:20,469
different topic different different
topic but but um um in any case you know

12972
04:08:20,469 --> 04:08:20,479
topic but but um um in any case you know
 

12973
04:08:20,479 --> 04:08:22,429
topic but but um um in any case you know
but so computational reducibility is one

12974
04:08:22,429 --> 04:08:22,439
but so computational reducibility is one
 

12975
04:08:22,439 --> 04:08:24,229
but so computational reducibility is one
of these sort of Concepts that I think

12976
04:08:24,229 --> 04:08:24,239
of these sort of Concepts that I think
 

12977
04:08:24,239 --> 04:08:25,710
of these sort of Concepts that I think
is important in understanding lots of

12978
04:08:25,710 --> 04:08:25,720
is important in understanding lots of
 

12979
04:08:25,720 --> 04:08:28,229
is important in understanding lots of
things in the world but the question is

12980
04:08:28,229 --> 04:08:28,239
things in the world but the question is
 

12981
04:08:28,239 --> 04:08:29,830
things in the world but the question is
it's only important if you believe the

12982
04:08:29,830 --> 04:08:29,840
it's only important if you believe the
 

12983
04:08:29,840 --> 04:08:32,229
it's only important if you believe the
world is fundamentally computational

12984
04:08:32,229 --> 04:08:32,239
world is fundamentally computational
 

12985
04:08:32,239 --> 04:08:34,710
world is fundamentally computational
right and but if you if you know the

12986
04:08:34,710 --> 04:08:34,720
right and but if you if you know the
 

12987
04:08:34,720 --> 04:08:36,389
right and but if you if you know the
fundamental Theory of physics and it's

12988
04:08:36,389 --> 04:08:36,399
fundamental Theory of physics and it's
 

12989
04:08:36,399 --> 04:08:38,990
fundamental Theory of physics and it's
fundamentally computational then you've

12990
04:08:38,990 --> 04:08:39,000
fundamentally computational then you've
 

12991
04:08:39,000 --> 04:08:41,830
fundamentally computational then you've
rooted the whole thing that is you know

12992
04:08:41,830 --> 04:08:41,840
rooted the whole thing that is you know
 

12993
04:08:41,840 --> 04:08:43,990
rooted the whole thing that is you know
the world is computational and while you

12994
04:08:43,990 --> 04:08:44,000
the world is computational and while you
 

12995
04:08:44,000 --> 04:08:47,990
the world is computational and while you
can discuss whether you know uh it's not

12996
04:08:47,990 --> 04:08:48,000
can discuss whether you know uh it's not
 

12997
04:08:48,000 --> 04:08:49,429
can discuss whether you know uh it's not
the case that people say well you have

12998
04:08:49,429 --> 04:08:49,439
the case that people say well you have
 

12999
04:08:49,439 --> 04:08:50,950
the case that people say well you have
this whole computational reducibility

13000
04:08:50,950 --> 04:08:50,960
this whole computational reducibility
 

13001
04:08:50,960 --> 04:08:52,710
this whole computational reducibility
all these features of computation we

13002
04:08:52,710 --> 04:08:52,720
all these features of computation we
 

13003
04:08:52,720 --> 04:08:54,830
all these features of computation we
don't care about those because after all

13004
04:08:54,830 --> 04:08:54,840
don't care about those because after all
 

13005
04:08:54,840 --> 04:08:56,630
don't care about those because after all
the world isn't computational you might

13006
04:08:56,630 --> 04:08:56,640
the world isn't computational you might
 

13007
04:08:56,640 --> 04:08:59,710
the world isn't computational you might
say but if you know you know Bas space

13008
04:08:59,710 --> 04:08:59,720
say but if you know you know Bas space
 

13009
04:08:59,720 --> 04:09:03,229
say but if you know you know Bas space
based thing physics is computational

13010
04:09:03,229 --> 04:09:03,239
based thing physics is computational
 

13011
04:09:03,239 --> 04:09:05,349
based thing physics is computational
then you know that that stuff is you

13012
04:09:05,349 --> 04:09:05,359
then you know that that stuff is you
 

13013
04:09:05,359 --> 04:09:07,149
then you know that that stuff is you
know that's kind of the grounding for

13014
04:09:07,149 --> 04:09:07,159
know that's kind of the grounding for
 

13015
04:09:07,159 --> 04:09:09,870
know that's kind of the grounding for
that stuff just as in a sense cernus was

13016
04:09:09,870 --> 04:09:09,880
that stuff just as in a sense cernus was
 

13017
04:09:09,880 --> 04:09:11,870
that stuff just as in a sense cernus was
the grounding for the idea that you

13018
04:09:11,870 --> 04:09:11,880
the grounding for the idea that you
 

13019
04:09:11,880 --> 04:09:13,750
the grounding for the idea that you
could figure out something with math

13020
04:09:13,750 --> 04:09:13,760
could figure out something with math
 

13021
04:09:13,760 --> 04:09:17,790
could figure out something with math
science that was not what you would

13022
04:09:17,790 --> 04:09:17,800
science that was not what you would
 

13023
04:09:17,800 --> 04:09:20,469
science that was not what you would
intuitively think from your senses so

13024
04:09:20,469 --> 04:09:20,479
intuitively think from your senses so
 

13025
04:09:20,479 --> 04:09:22,389
intuitively think from your senses so
now we've got to this point where for

13026
04:09:22,389 --> 04:09:22,399
now we've got to this point where for
 

13027
04:09:22,399 --> 04:09:24,870
now we've got to this point where for
example we say you know once we have the

13028
04:09:24,870 --> 04:09:24,880
example we say you know once we have the
 

13029
04:09:24,880 --> 04:09:26,469
example we say you know once we have the
idea that computation is the

13030
04:09:26,469 --> 04:09:26,479
idea that computation is the
 

13031
04:09:26,479 --> 04:09:28,710
idea that computation is the
foundational thing that explains our

13032
04:09:28,710 --> 04:09:28,720
foundational thing that explains our
 

13033
04:09:28,720 --> 04:09:31,309
foundational thing that explains our
whole universe then we have to say well

13034
04:09:31,309 --> 04:09:31,319
whole universe then we have to say well
 

13035
04:09:31,319 --> 04:09:33,269
whole universe then we have to say well
what does it mean for other things like

13036
04:09:33,269 --> 04:09:33,279
what does it mean for other things like
 

13037
04:09:33,279 --> 04:09:34,429
what does it mean for other things like
it means there's computational

13038
04:09:34,429 --> 04:09:34,439
it means there's computational
 

13039
04:09:34,439 --> 04:09:36,229
it means there's computational
irreducibility that means science is

13040
04:09:36,229 --> 04:09:36,239
irreducibility that means science is
 

13041
04:09:36,239 --> 04:09:38,630
irreducibility that means science is
limited in certain ways that means this

13042
04:09:38,630 --> 04:09:38,640
limited in certain ways that means this
 

13043
04:09:38,640 --> 04:09:40,710
limited in certain ways that means this
that means that but the fact that we

13044
04:09:40,710 --> 04:09:40,720
that means that but the fact that we
 

13045
04:09:40,720 --> 04:09:43,950
that means that but the fact that we
have that grounding means that you know

13046
04:09:43,950 --> 04:09:43,960
have that grounding means that you know
 

13047
04:09:43,960 --> 04:09:46,189
have that grounding means that you know
and I think for example for kernus for

13048
04:09:46,189 --> 04:09:46,199
and I think for example for kernus for
 

13049
04:09:46,199 --> 04:09:49,349
and I think for example for kernus for
instance the implications of his work on

13050
04:09:49,349 --> 04:09:49,359
instance the implications of his work on
 

13051
04:09:49,359 --> 04:09:51,630
instance the implications of his work on
the sort of mathematics of astronomy

13052
04:09:51,630 --> 04:09:51,640
the sort of mathematics of astronomy
 

13053
04:09:51,640 --> 04:09:53,550
the sort of mathematics of astronomy
were cool but they involved a very small

13054
04:09:53,550 --> 04:09:53,560
were cool but they involved a very small
 

13055
04:09:53,560 --> 04:09:55,469
were cool but they involved a very small
number of people the implications of his

13056
04:09:55,469 --> 04:09:55,479
number of people the implications of his
 

13057
04:09:55,479 --> 04:09:57,109
number of people the implications of his
work for sort of the philosophy of how

13058
04:09:57,109 --> 04:09:57,119
work for sort of the philosophy of how
 

13059
04:09:57,119 --> 04:10:00,030
work for sort of the philosophy of how
you think about things were vast and

13060
04:10:00,030 --> 04:10:00,040
you think about things were vast and
 

13061
04:10:00,040 --> 04:10:02,870
you think about things were vast and
involved you know everybody more or less

13062
04:10:02,870 --> 04:10:02,880
involved you know everybody more or less
 

13063
04:10:02,880 --> 04:10:04,510
involved you know everybody more or less
but do you think so that's actually the

13064
04:10:04,510 --> 04:10:04,520
but do you think so that's actually the
 

13065
04:10:04,520 --> 04:10:08,030
but do you think so that's actually the
way scientists and people see the world

13066
04:10:08,030 --> 04:10:08,040
way scientists and people see the world
 

13067
04:10:08,040 --> 04:10:09,870
way scientists and people see the world
around us so it has a huge impact in

13068
04:10:09,870 --> 04:10:09,880
around us so it has a huge impact in
 

13069
04:10:09,880 --> 04:10:12,309
around us so it has a huge impact in
that sense do you think it might have an

13070
04:10:12,309 --> 04:10:12,319
that sense do you think it might have an
 

13071
04:10:12,319 --> 04:10:16,149
that sense do you think it might have an
impact more directly to engineering

13072
04:10:16,149 --> 04:10:16,159
impact more directly to engineering
 

13073
04:10:16,159 --> 04:10:18,990
impact more directly to engineering
derivations from physics like propulsion

13074
04:10:18,990 --> 04:10:19,000
derivations from physics like propulsion
 

13075
04:10:19,000 --> 04:10:21,670

systems our ability to colonize the

13076
04:10:21,670 --> 04:10:21,680
systems our ability to colonize the
 

13077
04:10:21,680 --> 04:10:23,590
systems our ability to colonize the
world like for example okay this is like

13078
04:10:23,590 --> 04:10:23,600
world like for example okay this is like
 

13079
04:10:23,600 --> 04:10:27,349
world like for example okay this is like
sci-fi but if you if you

13080
04:10:27,349 --> 04:10:27,359
sci-fi but if you if you
 

13081
04:10:27,359 --> 04:10:30,630
sci-fi but if you if you
understand the computational nature say

13082
04:10:30,630 --> 04:10:30,640
understand the computational nature say
 

13083
04:10:30,640 --> 04:10:33,950
understand the computational nature say
of uh of the different forces of physics

13084
04:10:33,950 --> 04:10:33,960
of uh of the different forces of physics
 

13085
04:10:33,960 --> 04:10:36,189
of uh of the different forces of physics
you know there's there's a notion of

13086
04:10:36,189 --> 04:10:36,199
you know there's there's a notion of
 

13087
04:10:36,199 --> 04:10:38,429
you know there's there's a notion of
being able to you know warp gravity

13088
04:10:38,429 --> 04:10:38,439
being able to you know warp gravity
 

13089
04:10:38,439 --> 04:10:40,070
being able to you know warp gravity
things like this like can we make warp

13090
04:10:40,070 --> 04:10:40,080
things like this like can we make warp
 

13091
04:10:40,080 --> 04:10:42,630
things like this like can we make warp
drive warp drive yeah so like would we

13092
04:10:42,630 --> 04:10:42,640
drive warp drive yeah so like would we
 

13093
04:10:42,640 --> 04:10:45,870
drive warp drive yeah so like would we
be able to will it will uh you know will

13094
04:10:45,870 --> 04:10:45,880
be able to will it will uh you know will
 

13095
04:10:45,880 --> 04:10:47,670
be able to will it will uh you know will
like Elon Musk start paying attention

13096
04:10:47,670 --> 04:10:47,680
like Elon Musk start paying attention
 

13097
04:10:47,680 --> 04:10:50,030
like Elon Musk start paying attention
like it's awfully costly to launch these

13098
04:10:50,030 --> 04:10:50,040
like it's awfully costly to launch these
 

13099
04:10:50,040 --> 04:10:51,590
like it's awfully costly to launch these
Rockets do you think we'll be able to

13100
04:10:51,590 --> 04:10:51,600
Rockets do you think we'll be able to
 

13101
04:10:51,600 --> 04:10:53,990
Rockets do you think we'll be able to
yeah create warp drive and uh you know I

13102
04:10:53,990 --> 04:10:54,000
yeah create warp drive and uh you know I
 

13103
04:10:54,000 --> 04:10:55,830
yeah create warp drive and uh you know I
I I set myself some homework I agreed to

13104
04:10:55,830 --> 04:10:55,840
I I set myself some homework I agreed to
 

13105
04:10:55,840 --> 04:10:57,750
I I set myself some homework I agreed to
give a talk at some NASA Workshop in a

13106
04:10:57,750 --> 04:10:57,760
give a talk at some NASA Workshop in a
 

13107
04:10:57,760 --> 04:10:59,910
give a talk at some NASA Workshop in a
few weeks about faster than light travel

13108
04:10:59,910 --> 04:10:59,920
few weeks about faster than light travel
 

13109
04:10:59,920 --> 04:11:01,790
few weeks about faster than light travel
so I I haven't figured it out yet but

13110
04:11:01,790 --> 04:11:01,800
so I I haven't figured it out yet but
 

13111
04:11:01,800 --> 04:11:04,149
so I I haven't figured it out yet but
but no but you got two weeks yeah right

13112
04:11:04,149 --> 04:11:04,159
but no but you got two weeks yeah right
 

13113
04:11:04,159 --> 04:11:05,990
but no but you got two weeks yeah right
but do you think that kind of

13114
04:11:05,990 --> 04:11:06,000
but do you think that kind of
 

13115
04:11:06,000 --> 04:11:07,269
but do you think that kind of
understanding of fundamental Theory of

13116
04:11:07,269 --> 04:11:07,279
understanding of fundamental Theory of
 

13117
04:11:07,279 --> 04:11:09,030
understanding of fundamental Theory of
physics can lead to those engineering

13118
04:11:09,030 --> 04:11:09,040
physics can lead to those engineering
 

13119
04:11:09,040 --> 04:11:10,830
physics can lead to those engineering
breakthroughs okay I think it's far away

13120
04:11:10,830 --> 04:11:10,840
breakthroughs okay I think it's far away
 

13121
04:11:10,840 --> 04:11:12,910
breakthroughs okay I think it's far away
but I'm not certain I mean and you know

13122
04:11:12,910 --> 04:11:12,920
but I'm not certain I mean and you know
 

13123
04:11:12,920 --> 04:11:15,030
but I'm not certain I mean and you know
this is the thing that that um I set

13124
04:11:15,030 --> 04:11:15,040
this is the thing that that um I set
 

13125
04:11:15,040 --> 04:11:17,030
this is the thing that that um I set
myself an exercise When Gravity waves

13126
04:11:17,030 --> 04:11:17,040
myself an exercise When Gravity waves
 

13127
04:11:17,040 --> 04:11:18,630
myself an exercise When Gravity waves
gravitational waves were discovered

13128
04:11:18,630 --> 04:11:18,640
gravitational waves were discovered
 

13129
04:11:18,640 --> 04:11:21,269
gravitational waves were discovered
right I set myself the exercise of what

13130
04:11:21,269 --> 04:11:21,279
right I set myself the exercise of what
 

13131
04:11:21,279 --> 04:11:23,870
right I set myself the exercise of what
would black hole technology look like in

13132
04:11:23,870 --> 04:11:23,880
would black hole technology look like in
 

13133
04:11:23,880 --> 04:11:25,469
would black hole technology look like in
other words right now you know black

13134
04:11:25,469 --> 04:11:25,479
other words right now you know black
 

13135
04:11:25,479 --> 04:11:26,910
other words right now you know black
holes are far away they're you know how

13136
04:11:26,910 --> 04:11:26,920
holes are far away they're you know how
 

13137
04:11:26,920 --> 04:11:28,269
holes are far away they're you know how
on Earth can we do things with them but

13138
04:11:28,269 --> 04:11:28,279
on Earth can we do things with them but
 

13139
04:11:28,279 --> 04:11:30,109
on Earth can we do things with them but
just imagine that we could get you know

13140
04:11:30,109 --> 04:11:30,119
just imagine that we could get you know
 

13141
04:11:30,119 --> 04:11:32,429
just imagine that we could get you know
pet black holes right in our backyard

13142
04:11:32,429 --> 04:11:32,439
pet black holes right in our backyard
 

13143
04:11:32,439 --> 04:11:33,870
pet black holes right in our backyard
you know what kind of Technology could

13144
04:11:33,870 --> 04:11:33,880
you know what kind of Technology could
 

13145
04:11:33,880 --> 04:11:35,229
you know what kind of Technology could
we build with them I I got a certain

13146
04:11:35,229 --> 04:11:35,239
we build with them I I got a certain
 

13147
04:11:35,239 --> 04:11:37,950
we build with them I I got a certain
distance not that far but I think in in

13148
04:11:37,950 --> 04:11:37,960
distance not that far but I think in in
 

13149
04:11:37,960 --> 04:11:40,030
distance not that far but I think in in
um you know so there are ideas you know

13150
04:11:40,030 --> 04:11:40,040
um you know so there are ideas you know
 

13151
04:11:40,040 --> 04:11:42,030
um you know so there are ideas you know
I have this one of the weirder ideas is

13152
04:11:42,030 --> 04:11:42,040
I have this one of the weirder ideas is
 

13153
04:11:42,040 --> 04:11:44,189
I have this one of the weirder ideas is
the things I'm calling SpaceTime tunnels

13154
04:11:44,189 --> 04:11:44,199
the things I'm calling SpaceTime tunnels
 

13155
04:11:44,199 --> 04:11:46,070
the things I'm calling SpaceTime tunnels
which are higher dimensional pieces of

13156
04:11:46,070 --> 04:11:46,080
which are higher dimensional pieces of
 

13157
04:11:46,080 --> 04:11:48,910
which are higher dimensional pieces of
the of of SpaceTime where basically you

13158
04:11:48,910 --> 04:11:48,920
the of of SpaceTime where basically you
 

13159
04:11:48,920 --> 04:11:51,469
the of of SpaceTime where basically you
can you know in in our three-dimensional

13160
04:11:51,469 --> 04:11:51,479
can you know in in our three-dimensional
 

13161
04:11:51,479 --> 04:11:53,710
can you know in in our three-dimensional
space there might be a five-dimensional

13162
04:11:53,710 --> 04:11:53,720
space there might be a five-dimensional
 

13163
04:11:53,720 --> 04:11:56,109
space there might be a five-dimensional
you know uh region which actually will

13164
04:11:56,109 --> 04:11:56,119
you know uh region which actually will
 

13165
04:11:56,119 --> 04:11:57,670
you know uh region which actually will
appear as a white hole at one end and a

13166
04:11:57,670 --> 04:11:57,680
appear as a white hole at one end and a
 

13167
04:11:57,680 --> 04:11:59,590
appear as a white hole at one end and a
black hole at the other end you know who

13168
04:11:59,590 --> 04:11:59,600
black hole at the other end you know who
 

13169
04:11:59,600 --> 04:12:01,469
black hole at the other end you know who
knows whether they exist and then the

13170
04:12:01,469 --> 04:12:01,479
knows whether they exist and then the
 

13171
04:12:01,479 --> 04:12:03,229
knows whether they exist and then the
questions another one okay this is

13172
04:12:03,229 --> 04:12:03,239
questions another one okay this is
 

13173
04:12:03,239 --> 04:12:05,149
questions another one okay this is
another crazy one is the thing that I'm

13174
04:12:05,149 --> 04:12:05,159
another crazy one is the thing that I'm
 

13175
04:12:05,159 --> 04:12:09,550
another crazy one is the thing that I'm
calling a vacuum cleaner okay so so so I

13176
04:12:09,550 --> 04:12:09,560
calling a vacuum cleaner okay so so so I
 

13177
04:12:09,560 --> 04:12:11,309
calling a vacuum cleaner okay so so so I
I I mentioned that you know there's all

13178
04:12:11,309 --> 04:12:11,319
I I mentioned that you know there's all
 

13179
04:12:11,319 --> 04:12:12,830
I I mentioned that you know there's all
this activity in the universe which is

13180
04:12:12,830 --> 04:12:12,840
this activity in the universe which is
 

13181
04:12:12,840 --> 04:12:15,030
this activity in the universe which is
meant Ming the structure of space yes

13182
04:12:15,030 --> 04:12:15,040
meant Ming the structure of space yes
 

13183
04:12:15,040 --> 04:12:17,790
meant Ming the structure of space yes
and that leads to a certain uh energy

13184
04:12:17,790 --> 04:12:17,800
and that leads to a certain uh energy
 

13185
04:12:17,800 --> 04:12:21,590
and that leads to a certain uh energy
density effectively in space and so the

13186
04:12:21,590 --> 04:12:21,600
density effectively in space and so the
 

13187
04:12:21,600 --> 04:12:24,550
density effectively in space and so the
question in fact dark energy is a story

13188
04:12:24,550 --> 04:12:24,560
question in fact dark energy is a story
 

13189
04:12:24,560 --> 04:12:28,469
question in fact dark energy is a story
of essentially negative mass produced by

13190
04:12:28,469 --> 04:12:28,479
of essentially negative mass produced by
 

13191
04:12:28,479 --> 04:12:31,309
of essentially negative mass produced by
uh the absence of energy you thought

13192
04:12:31,309 --> 04:12:31,319
uh the absence of energy you thought
 

13193
04:12:31,319 --> 04:12:33,630
uh the absence of energy you thought
would be there so to speak and we don't

13194
04:12:33,630 --> 04:12:33,640
would be there so to speak and we don't
 

13195
04:12:33,640 --> 04:12:35,550
would be there so to speak and we don't
know exactly how it works in in our

13196
04:12:35,550 --> 04:12:35,560
know exactly how it works in in our
 

13197
04:12:35,560 --> 04:12:36,750
know exactly how it works in in our
either our model or the physical

13198
04:12:36,750 --> 04:12:36,760
either our model or the physical
 

13199
04:12:36,760 --> 04:12:39,670
either our model or the physical
universe but this notion of a vacuum

13200
04:12:39,670 --> 04:12:39,680
universe but this notion of a vacuum
 

13201
04:12:39,680 --> 04:12:42,189
universe but this notion of a vacuum
cleaner is a thing where you know you

13202
04:12:42,189 --> 04:12:42,199
cleaner is a thing where you know you
 

13203
04:12:42,199 --> 04:12:43,590
cleaner is a thing where you know you
have all these things that maintaining

13204
04:12:43,590 --> 04:12:43,600
have all these things that maintaining
 

13205
04:12:43,600 --> 04:12:45,790
have all these things that maintaining
the structure of space but what if you

13206
04:12:45,790 --> 04:12:45,800
the structure of space but what if you
 

13207
04:12:45,800 --> 04:12:47,510
the structure of space but what if you
could clean out some of that stuff

13208
04:12:47,510 --> 04:12:47,520
could clean out some of that stuff
 

13209
04:12:47,520 --> 04:12:48,630
could clean out some of that stuff
that's maintaining the structure of

13210
04:12:48,630 --> 04:12:48,640
that's maintaining the structure of
 

13211
04:12:48,640 --> 04:12:50,910
that's maintaining the structure of
space and make a simpler vacuum

13212
04:12:50,910 --> 04:12:50,920
space and make a simpler vacuum
 

13213
04:12:50,920 --> 04:12:52,510
space and make a simpler vacuum
somewhere yeah you know what would that

13214
04:12:52,510 --> 04:12:52,520
somewhere yeah you know what would that
 

13215
04:12:52,520 --> 04:12:54,349
somewhere yeah you know what would that
do a totally different kind of vacuum

13216
04:12:54,349 --> 04:12:54,359
do a totally different kind of vacuum
 

13217
04:12:54,359 --> 04:12:55,590
do a totally different kind of vacuum
right and that that would lead to

13218
04:12:55,590 --> 04:12:55,600
right and that that would lead to
 

13219
04:12:55,600 --> 04:12:57,790
right and that that would lead to
negative energy density which would need

13220
04:12:57,790 --> 04:12:57,800
negative energy density which would need
 

13221
04:12:57,800 --> 04:12:59,870
negative energy density which would need
to so gravity is is usually a purely

13222
04:12:59,870 --> 04:12:59,880
to so gravity is is usually a purely
 

13223
04:12:59,880 --> 04:13:02,630
to so gravity is is usually a purely
attractive Force but negative Mass would

13224
04:13:02,630 --> 04:13:02,640
attractive Force but negative Mass would
 

13225
04:13:02,640 --> 04:13:06,950
attractive Force but negative Mass would
lead to rep repulsive gravity um and uh

13226
04:13:06,950 --> 04:13:06,960
lead to rep repulsive gravity um and uh
 

13227
04:13:06,960 --> 04:13:08,830
lead to rep repulsive gravity um and uh
lead to all kinds of weird things now

13228
04:13:08,830 --> 04:13:08,840
lead to all kinds of weird things now
 

13229
04:13:08,840 --> 04:13:11,429
lead to all kinds of weird things now
can it be done in our universe um you

13230
04:13:11,429 --> 04:13:11,439
can it be done in our universe um you
 

13231
04:13:11,439 --> 04:13:15,349
can it be done in our universe um you
know my immediate thought is no but but

13232
04:13:15,349 --> 04:13:15,359
know my immediate thought is no but but
 

13233
04:13:15,359 --> 04:13:18,269
know my immediate thought is no but but
you know the fact is that okay so so

13234
04:13:18,269 --> 04:13:18,279
you know the fact is that okay so so
 

13235
04:13:18,279 --> 04:13:19,590
you know the fact is that okay so so
here once you understand the fact

13236
04:13:19,590 --> 04:13:19,600
here once you understand the fact
 

13237
04:13:19,600 --> 04:13:21,070
here once you understand the fact
because you're saying like at this level

13238
04:13:21,070 --> 04:13:21,080
because you're saying like at this level
 

13239
04:13:21,080 --> 04:13:23,109
because you're saying like at this level
abstraction can we reach to the lower

13240
04:13:23,109 --> 04:13:23,119
abstraction can we reach to the lower
 

13241
04:13:23,119 --> 04:13:26,429
abstraction can we reach to the lower
levels and mess with it uh once you

13242
04:13:26,429 --> 04:13:26,439
levels and mess with it uh once you
 

13243
04:13:26,439 --> 04:13:28,670
levels and mess with it uh once you
understand the levels I think you can

13244
04:13:28,670 --> 04:13:28,680
understand the levels I think you can
 

13245
04:13:28,680 --> 04:13:30,750
understand the levels I think you can
start and I'm I'm you know I have to say

13246
04:13:30,750 --> 04:13:30,760
start and I'm I'm you know I have to say
 

13247
04:13:30,760 --> 04:13:32,910
start and I'm I'm you know I have to say
that that this reminds me of people

13248
04:13:32,910 --> 04:13:32,920
that that this reminds me of people
 

13249
04:13:32,920 --> 04:13:34,990
that that this reminds me of people
telling one years ago that you know

13250
04:13:34,990 --> 04:13:35,000
telling one years ago that you know
 

13251
04:13:35,000 --> 04:13:36,870
telling one years ago that you know
you'll never transmit data over a copper

13252
04:13:36,870 --> 04:13:36,880
you'll never transmit data over a copper
 

13253
04:13:36,880 --> 04:13:39,990
you'll never transmit data over a copper
wire at more than a th you know a th000

13254
04:13:39,990 --> 04:13:40,000
wire at more than a th you know a th000
 

13255
04:13:40,000 --> 04:13:42,429
wire at more than a th you know a th000
board or something right and and this is

13256
04:13:42,429 --> 04:13:42,439
board or something right and and this is
 

13257
04:13:42,439 --> 04:13:44,510
board or something right and and this is
why did that not happen you know why why

13258
04:13:44,510 --> 04:13:44,520
why did that not happen you know why why
 

13259
04:13:44,520 --> 04:13:46,149
why did that not happen you know why why
did why do we have this much much faster

13260
04:13:46,149 --> 04:13:46,159
did why do we have this much much faster
 

13261
04:13:46,159 --> 04:13:47,389
did why do we have this much much faster
data transmission because we've

13262
04:13:47,389 --> 04:13:47,399
data transmission because we've
 

13263
04:13:47,399 --> 04:13:48,910
data transmission because we've
understood many more of the details of

13264
04:13:48,910 --> 04:13:48,920
understood many more of the details of
 

13265
04:13:48,920 --> 04:13:51,309
understood many more of the details of
what's actually going on and and it's

13266
04:13:51,309 --> 04:13:51,319
what's actually going on and and it's
 

13267
04:13:51,319 --> 04:13:53,030
what's actually going on and and it's
the same exact story here and it it's

13268
04:13:53,030 --> 04:13:53,040
the same exact story here and it it's
 

13269
04:13:53,040 --> 04:13:54,990
the same exact story here and it it's
the same you know I think that this as I

13270
04:13:54,990 --> 04:13:55,000
the same you know I think that this as I
 

13271
04:13:55,000 --> 04:13:57,910
the same you know I think that this as I
say I think one of the features of sort

13272
04:13:57,910 --> 04:13:57,920
say I think one of the features of sort
 

13273
04:13:57,920 --> 04:14:00,630
say I think one of the features of sort
of one of the things about our time that

13274
04:14:00,630 --> 04:14:00,640
of one of the things about our time that
 

13275
04:14:00,640 --> 04:14:03,030
of one of the things about our time that
will seem incredibly naive in the future

13276
04:14:03,030 --> 04:14:03,040
will seem incredibly naive in the future
 

13277
04:14:03,040 --> 04:14:05,830
will seem incredibly naive in the future
is the belief that you know things like

13278
04:14:05,830 --> 04:14:05,840
is the belief that you know things like
 

13279
04:14:05,840 --> 04:14:08,510
is the belief that you know things like
heat is just random motional molecules

13280
04:14:08,510 --> 04:14:08,520
heat is just random motional molecules
 

13281
04:14:08,520 --> 04:14:10,830
heat is just random motional molecules
that that that it's just just throw up

13282
04:14:10,830 --> 04:14:10,840
that that that it's just just throw up
 

13283
04:14:10,840 --> 04:14:13,349
that that that it's just just throw up
your hands it's just random we can't say

13284
04:14:13,349 --> 04:14:13,359
your hands it's just random we can't say
 

13285
04:14:13,359 --> 04:14:16,710
your hands it's just random we can't say
about it that will seem naive yeah the

13286
04:14:16,710 --> 04:14:16,720
about it that will seem naive yeah the
 

13287
04:14:16,720 --> 04:14:18,349
about it that will seem naive yeah the
at the heat depth of the universe those

13288
04:14:18,349 --> 04:14:18,359
at the heat depth of the universe those
 

13289
04:14:18,359 --> 04:14:20,429
at the heat depth of the universe those
particles would be laughing at us humans

13290
04:14:20,429 --> 04:14:20,439
particles would be laughing at us humans
 

13291
04:14:20,439 --> 04:14:23,830
particles would be laughing at us humans
thinking yes right that life is not

13292
04:14:23,830 --> 04:14:23,840
thinking yes right that life is not
 

13293
04:14:23,840 --> 04:14:26,670
thinking yes right that life is not
civilization um you know humans used to

13294
04:14:26,670 --> 04:14:26,680
civilization um you know humans used to
 

13295
04:14:26,680 --> 04:14:28,429
civilization um you know humans used to
think they're special with their little

13296
04:14:28,429 --> 04:14:28,439
think they're special with their little
 

13297
04:14:28,439 --> 04:14:30,429
think they're special with their little
brains well right but but also but but

13298
04:14:30,429 --> 04:14:30,439
brains well right but but also but but
 

13299
04:14:30,439 --> 04:14:31,750
brains well right but but also but but
and they used to think that this would

13300
04:14:31,750 --> 04:14:31,760
and they used to think that this would
 

13301
04:14:31,760 --> 04:14:34,189
and they used to think that this would
just be random and uninteresting but

13302
04:14:34,189 --> 04:14:34,199
just be random and uninteresting but
 

13303
04:14:34,199 --> 04:14:36,349
just be random and uninteresting but
that's but so so this question about

13304
04:14:36,349 --> 04:14:36,359
that's but so so this question about
 

13305
04:14:36,359 --> 04:14:38,590
that's but so so this question about
whether you can you know mess with the

13306
04:14:38,590 --> 04:14:38,600
whether you can you know mess with the
 

13307
04:14:38,600 --> 04:14:40,790
whether you can you know mess with the
underlying structure and how you find a

13308
04:14:40,790 --> 04:14:40,800
underlying structure and how you find a
 

13309
04:14:40,800 --> 04:14:41,950
underlying structure and how you find a
way to mess with the underlying

13310
04:14:41,950 --> 04:14:41,960
way to mess with the underlying
 

13311
04:14:41,960 --> 04:14:44,790
way to mess with the underlying
structure that's a you know I have to

13312
04:14:44,790 --> 04:14:44,800
structure that's a you know I have to
 

13313
04:14:44,800 --> 04:14:47,229
structure that's a you know I have to
say you know my immediate thing is boy

13314
04:14:47,229 --> 04:14:47,239
say you know my immediate thing is boy
 

13315
04:14:47,239 --> 04:14:50,630
say you know my immediate thing is boy
that seems really hard but then and and

13316
04:14:50,630 --> 04:14:50,640
that seems really hard but then and and
 

13317
04:14:50,640 --> 04:14:52,149
that seems really hard but then and and
you know possibly computational

13318
04:14:52,149 --> 04:14:52,159
you know possibly computational
 

13319
04:14:52,159 --> 04:14:54,349
you know possibly computational
irreducibility will bite you but then

13320
04:14:54,349 --> 04:14:54,359
irreducibility will bite you but then
 

13321
04:14:54,359 --> 04:14:55,630
irreducibility will bite you but then
there's always some path of

13322
04:14:55,630 --> 04:14:55,640
there's always some path of
 

13323
04:14:55,640 --> 04:14:57,990
there's always some path of
computational reducibility and that path

13324
04:14:57,990 --> 04:14:58,000
computational reducibility and that path
 

13325
04:14:58,000 --> 04:15:00,030
computational reducibility and that path
of computational reducibility is the

13326
04:15:00,030 --> 04:15:00,040
of computational reducibility is the
 

13327
04:15:00,040 --> 04:15:01,990
of computational reducibility is the
engineering invention exact that has to

13328
04:15:01,990 --> 04:15:02,000
engineering invention exact that has to
 

13329
04:15:02,000 --> 04:15:03,790
engineering invention exact that has to
be made those little pockets can have

13330
04:15:03,790 --> 04:15:03,800
be made those little pockets can have
 

13331
04:15:03,800 --> 04:15:06,830
be made those little pockets can have
huge engineering impact right and and I

13332
04:15:06,830 --> 04:15:06,840
huge engineering impact right and and I
 

13333
04:15:06,840 --> 04:15:08,309
huge engineering impact right and and I
think that that's right and I mean we

13334
04:15:08,309 --> 04:15:08,319
think that that's right and I mean we
 

13335
04:15:08,319 --> 04:15:10,309
think that that's right and I mean we
live in you know we make use of so many

13336
04:15:10,309 --> 04:15:10,319
live in you know we make use of so many
 

13337
04:15:10,319 --> 04:15:12,469
live in you know we make use of so many
of those pockets and the fact is you

13338
04:15:12,469 --> 04:15:12,479
of those pockets and the fact is you
 

13339
04:15:12,479 --> 04:15:16,950
of those pockets and the fact is you
know I I um uh you know this this is yes

13340
04:15:16,950 --> 04:15:16,960
know I I um uh you know this this is yes
 

13341
04:15:16,960 --> 04:15:19,269
know I I um uh you know this this is yes
it's it's a you know it's one of these

13342
04:15:19,269 --> 04:15:19,279
it's it's a you know it's one of these
 

13343
04:15:19,279 --> 04:15:22,429
it's it's a you know it's one of these
things where where you know I am a

13344
04:15:22,429 --> 04:15:22,439
things where where you know I am a
 

13345
04:15:22,439 --> 04:15:24,790
things where where you know I am a
person who likes to figure out ideas and

13346
04:15:24,790 --> 04:15:24,800
person who likes to figure out ideas and
 

13347
04:15:24,800 --> 04:15:27,109
person who likes to figure out ideas and
so on and the sort of tests of my level

13348
04:15:27,109 --> 04:15:27,119
so on and the sort of tests of my level
 

13349
04:15:27,119 --> 04:15:29,990
so on and the sort of tests of my level
of imagination so to speak and so a

13350
04:15:29,990 --> 04:15:30,000
of imagination so to speak and so a
 

13351
04:15:30,000 --> 04:15:32,229
of imagination so to speak and so a
couple of places where there's sort of

13352
04:15:32,229 --> 04:15:32,239
couple of places where there's sort of
 

13353
04:15:32,239 --> 04:15:34,710
couple of places where there's sort of
serious humility in terms of my level of

13354
04:15:34,710 --> 04:15:34,720
serious humility in terms of my level of
 

13355
04:15:34,720 --> 04:15:37,070
serious humility in terms of my level of
imagination one is this thing about

13356
04:15:37,070 --> 04:15:37,080
imagination one is this thing about
 

13357
04:15:37,080 --> 04:15:38,510
imagination one is this thing about
different reference frames for

13358
04:15:38,510 --> 04:15:38,520
different reference frames for
 

13359
04:15:38,520 --> 04:15:40,630
different reference frames for
understanding the universe where like

13360
04:15:40,630 --> 04:15:40,640
understanding the universe where like
 

13361
04:15:40,640 --> 04:15:42,349
understanding the universe where like
imagine the physics of the aliens what

13362
04:15:42,349 --> 04:15:42,359
imagine the physics of the aliens what
 

13363
04:15:42,359 --> 04:15:44,510
imagine the physics of the aliens what
will it be like like and I'm like that's

13364
04:15:44,510 --> 04:15:44,520
will it be like like and I'm like that's
 

13365
04:15:44,520 --> 04:15:47,830
will it be like like and I'm like that's
really hard I don't know you know and

13366
04:15:47,830 --> 04:15:47,840
really hard I don't know you know and
 

13367
04:15:47,840 --> 04:15:49,429
really hard I don't know you know and
and I mean once you have the framework

13368
04:15:49,429 --> 04:15:49,439
and I mean once you have the framework
 

13369
04:15:49,439 --> 04:15:51,910
and I mean once you have the framework
in place you can at least reason about

13370
04:15:51,910 --> 04:15:51,920
in place you can at least reason about
 

13371
04:15:51,920 --> 04:15:54,590
in place you can at least reason about
the things you don't know or maybe can't

13372
04:15:54,590 --> 04:15:54,600
the things you don't know or maybe can't
 

13373
04:15:54,600 --> 04:15:56,870
the things you don't know or maybe can't
know or like it's too hard for for you

13374
04:15:56,870 --> 04:15:56,880
know or like it's too hard for for you
 

13375
04:15:56,880 --> 04:16:00,109
know or like it's too hard for for you
to know but then the the mathematics can

13376
04:16:00,109 --> 04:16:00,119
to know but then the the mathematics can
 

13377
04:16:00,119 --> 04:16:02,550
to know but then the the mathematics can
that's exactly it allow you to reach

13378
04:16:02,550 --> 04:16:02,560
that's exactly it allow you to reach
 

13379
04:16:02,560 --> 04:16:05,550
that's exactly it allow you to reach
beyond what you can uh reason about

13380
04:16:05,550 --> 04:16:05,560
beyond what you can uh reason about
 

13381
04:16:05,560 --> 04:16:07,469
beyond what you can uh reason about
right well so so I'm you know I'm I'm

13382
04:16:07,469 --> 04:16:07,479
right well so so I'm you know I'm I'm
 

13383
04:16:07,479 --> 04:16:09,550
right well so so I'm you know I'm I'm
I'm trying to not have you know if you

13384
04:16:09,550 --> 04:16:09,560
I'm trying to not have you know if you
 

13385
04:16:09,560 --> 04:16:11,670
I'm trying to not have you know if you
think back to Alan Turing for example

13386
04:16:11,670 --> 04:16:11,680
think back to Alan Turing for example
 

13387
04:16:11,680 --> 04:16:13,070
think back to Alan Turing for example
and you know when he invented Turing

13388
04:16:13,070 --> 04:16:13,080
and you know when he invented Turing
 

13389
04:16:13,080 --> 04:16:15,670
and you know when he invented Turing
machines you know and and imagining what

13390
04:16:15,670 --> 04:16:15,680
machines you know and and imagining what
 

13391
04:16:15,680 --> 04:16:17,870
machines you know and and imagining what
computers would end up doing so to speak

13392
04:16:17,870 --> 04:16:17,880
computers would end up doing so to speak
 

13393
04:16:17,880 --> 04:16:20,510
computers would end up doing so to speak
yeah um you know and very difficult it's

13394
04:16:20,510 --> 04:16:20,520
yeah um you know and very difficult it's
 

13395
04:16:20,520 --> 04:16:22,030
yeah um you know and very difficult it's
difficult right and it's it's I mean

13396
04:16:22,030 --> 04:16:22,040
difficult right and it's it's I mean
 

13397
04:16:22,040 --> 04:16:23,630
difficult right and it's it's I mean
made a few reasonable predictions but

13398
04:16:23,630 --> 04:16:23,640
made a few reasonable predictions but
 

13399
04:16:23,640 --> 04:16:25,550
made a few reasonable predictions but
most of it he couldn't predict possibly

13400
04:16:25,550 --> 04:16:25,560
most of it he couldn't predict possibly
 

13401
04:16:25,560 --> 04:16:27,229
most of it he couldn't predict possibly
by the time by 1950 he was making

13402
04:16:27,229 --> 04:16:27,239
by the time by 1950 he was making
 

13403
04:16:27,239 --> 04:16:29,070
by the time by 1950 he was making
reasonable predictions about something

13404
04:16:29,070 --> 04:16:29,080
reasonable predictions about something
 

13405
04:16:29,080 --> 04:16:31,469
reasonable predictions about something
but not the 30s yeah right not not not

13406
04:16:31,469 --> 04:16:31,479
but not the 30s yeah right not not not
 

13407
04:16:31,479 --> 04:16:33,590
but not the 30s yeah right not not not
in the not when he first you know

13408
04:16:33,590 --> 04:16:33,600
in the not when he first you know
 

13409
04:16:33,600 --> 04:16:35,550
in the not when he first you know
conceptualized you know and he

13410
04:16:35,550 --> 04:16:35,560
conceptualized you know and he
 

13411
04:16:35,560 --> 04:16:37,550
conceptualized you know and he
conceptualized Universal Computing for a

13412
04:16:37,550 --> 04:16:37,560
conceptualized Universal Computing for a
 

13413
04:16:37,560 --> 04:16:39,309
conceptualized Universal Computing for a
very specific mathematical reason that

13414
04:16:39,309 --> 04:16:39,319
very specific mathematical reason that
 

13415
04:16:39,319 --> 04:16:41,710
very specific mathematical reason that
wasn't um uh wasn't as general but but

13416
04:16:41,710 --> 04:16:41,720
wasn't um uh wasn't as general but but
 

13417
04:16:41,720 --> 04:16:43,550
wasn't um uh wasn't as general but but
yes it's a it's a good sort of exercise

13418
04:16:43,550 --> 04:16:43,560
yes it's a it's a good sort of exercise
 

13419
04:16:43,560 --> 04:16:45,750
yes it's a it's a good sort of exercise
and humility to realize that that it's

13420
04:16:45,750 --> 04:16:45,760
and humility to realize that that it's
 

13421
04:16:45,760 --> 04:16:48,070
and humility to realize that that it's
kind of like it's it's really hard to

13422
04:16:48,070 --> 04:16:48,080
kind of like it's it's really hard to
 

13423
04:16:48,080 --> 04:16:50,389
kind of like it's it's really hard to
figure these things out the engineering

13424
04:16:50,389 --> 04:16:50,399
figure these things out the engineering
 

13425
04:16:50,399 --> 04:16:52,830
figure these things out the engineering
of of um the universe if we know how the

13426
04:16:52,830 --> 04:16:52,840
of of um the universe if we know how the
 

13427
04:16:52,840 --> 04:16:55,870
of of um the universe if we know how the
universe works how can we engineer it

13428
04:16:55,870 --> 04:16:55,880
universe works how can we engineer it
 

13429
04:16:55,880 --> 04:16:57,750
universe works how can we engineer it
that's such a beautiful Vision that's

13430
04:16:57,750 --> 04:16:57,760
that's such a beautiful Vision that's
 

13431
04:16:57,760 --> 04:16:59,030
that's such a beautiful Vision that's
such a beautiful by the way I have to

13432
04:16:59,030 --> 04:16:59,040
such a beautiful by the way I have to
 

13433
04:16:59,040 --> 04:17:00,309
such a beautiful by the way I have to
mention one more which is the the

13434
04:17:00,309 --> 04:17:00,319
mention one more which is the the
 

13435
04:17:00,319 --> 04:17:04,349
mention one more which is the the
ultimate question of of from physics is

13436
04:17:04,349 --> 04:17:04,359
ultimate question of of from physics is
 

13437
04:17:04,359 --> 04:17:05,910
ultimate question of of from physics is
okay so we have this abstract model of

13438
04:17:05,910 --> 04:17:05,920
okay so we have this abstract model of
 

13439
04:17:05,920 --> 04:17:08,550
okay so we have this abstract model of
the universe why does the universe exist

13440
04:17:08,550 --> 04:17:08,560
the universe why does the universe exist
 

13441
04:17:08,560 --> 04:17:09,670
the universe why does the universe exist
at

13442
04:17:09,670 --> 04:17:09,680
at
 

13443
04:17:09,680 --> 04:17:12,870
at
all right so you know we might say there

13444
04:17:12,870 --> 04:17:12,880
all right so you know we might say there
 

13445
04:17:12,880 --> 04:17:15,750
all right so you know we might say there
there is a a formal model that if you

13446
04:17:15,750 --> 04:17:15,760
there is a a formal model that if you
 

13447
04:17:15,760 --> 04:17:18,189
there is a a formal model that if you
run this model you get the universe or

13448
04:17:18,189 --> 04:17:18,199
run this model you get the universe or
 

13449
04:17:18,199 --> 04:17:21,030
run this model you get the universe or
the model gives you you know a model of

13450
04:17:21,030 --> 04:17:21,040
the model gives you you know a model of
 

13451
04:17:21,040 --> 04:17:23,510
the model gives you you know a model of
the universe right you you you you run

13452
04:17:23,510 --> 04:17:23,520
the universe right you you you you run
 

13453
04:17:23,520 --> 04:17:25,590
the universe right you you you you run
this mathematical thing and the

13454
04:17:25,590 --> 04:17:25,600
this mathematical thing and the
 

13455
04:17:25,600 --> 04:17:27,870
this mathematical thing and the
mathematics unfolds in the way that

13456
04:17:27,870 --> 04:17:27,880
mathematics unfolds in the way that
 

13457
04:17:27,880 --> 04:17:29,590
mathematics unfolds in the way that
corresponds to the universe but the

13458
04:17:29,590 --> 04:17:29,600
corresponds to the universe but the
 

13459
04:17:29,600 --> 04:17:32,590
corresponds to the universe but the
question is why was that actualized why

13460
04:17:32,590 --> 04:17:32,600
question is why was that actualized why
 

13461
04:17:32,600 --> 04:17:35,950
question is why was that actualized why
does the actual Universe actually exist

13462
04:17:35,950 --> 04:17:35,960
does the actual Universe actually exist
 

13463
04:17:35,960 --> 04:17:38,109
does the actual Universe actually exist
and um so this is this is another one of

13464
04:17:38,109 --> 04:17:38,119
and um so this is this is another one of
 

13465
04:17:38,119 --> 04:17:40,830
and um so this is this is another one of
these humility and and um is like can

13466
04:17:40,830 --> 04:17:40,840
these humility and and um is like can
 

13467
04:17:40,840 --> 04:17:43,109
these humility and and um is like can
you figure this out I have a guess okay

13468
04:17:43,109 --> 04:17:43,119
you figure this out I have a guess okay
 

13469
04:17:43,119 --> 04:17:45,750
you figure this out I have a guess okay
about the answer to that and um my guess

13470
04:17:45,750 --> 04:17:45,760
about the answer to that and um my guess
 

13471
04:17:45,760 --> 04:17:48,990
about the answer to that and um my guess
is somewhat unsatisfying but my guess is

13472
04:17:48,990 --> 04:17:49,000
is somewhat unsatisfying but my guess is
 

13473
04:17:49,000 --> 04:17:50,870
is somewhat unsatisfying but my guess is
that it's a little bit similar to girdle

13474
04:17:50,870 --> 04:17:50,880
that it's a little bit similar to girdle
 

13475
04:17:50,880 --> 04:17:52,950
that it's a little bit similar to girdle
second incompleteness theorem which is

13476
04:17:52,950 --> 04:17:52,960
second incompleteness theorem which is
 

13477
04:17:52,960 --> 04:17:55,469
second incompleteness theorem which is
the statement that from within as an

13478
04:17:55,469 --> 04:17:55,479
the statement that from within as an
 

13479
04:17:55,479 --> 04:17:58,109
the statement that from within as an
axiomatic Theory like P arithmetic you

13480
04:17:58,109 --> 04:17:58,119
axiomatic Theory like P arithmetic you
 

13481
04:17:58,119 --> 04:18:00,189
axiomatic Theory like P arithmetic you
cannot from within that theory prove the

13482
04:18:00,189 --> 04:18:00,199
cannot from within that theory prove the
 

13483
04:18:00,199 --> 04:18:04,429
cannot from within that theory prove the
consistency of the theory so my guess is

13484
04:18:04,429 --> 04:18:04,439
consistency of the theory so my guess is
 

13485
04:18:04,439 --> 04:18:07,109
consistency of the theory so my guess is
that for entities within the

13486
04:18:07,109 --> 04:18:07,119
that for entities within the
 

13487
04:18:07,119 --> 04:18:09,349
that for entities within the
universe there is no finite

13488
04:18:09,349 --> 04:18:09,359
universe there is no finite
 

13489
04:18:09,359 --> 04:18:12,550
universe there is no finite
determination that can be made of the

13490
04:18:12,550 --> 04:18:12,560
determination that can be made of the
 

13491
04:18:12,560 --> 04:18:15,229
determination that can be made of the
the statement the universe exists is

13492
04:18:15,229 --> 04:18:15,239
the statement the universe exists is
 

13493
04:18:15,239 --> 04:18:18,389
the statement the universe exists is
essentially undecidable to any entity

13494
04:18:18,389 --> 04:18:18,399
essentially undecidable to any entity
 

13495
04:18:18,399 --> 04:18:20,070
essentially undecidable to any entity
that is embedded in the universe within

13496
04:18:20,070 --> 04:18:20,080
that is embedded in the universe within
 

13497
04:18:20,080 --> 04:18:21,630
that is embedded in the universe within
that Universe how does that make you

13498
04:18:21,630 --> 04:18:21,640
that Universe how does that make you
 

13499
04:18:21,640 --> 04:18:25,349
that Universe how does that make you
feel is that is that does that put you

13500
04:18:25,349 --> 04:18:25,359
feel is that is that does that put you
 

13501
04:18:25,359 --> 04:18:26,910
feel is that is that does that put you
at peace that it's

13502
04:18:26,910 --> 04:18:26,920
at peace that it's
 

13503
04:18:26,920 --> 04:18:29,950
at peace that it's
impossible or is it really ultimately

13504
04:18:29,950 --> 04:18:29,960
impossible or is it really ultimately
 

13505
04:18:29,960 --> 04:18:32,630
impossible or is it really ultimately
frustrating well I think it just says

13506
04:18:32,630 --> 04:18:32,640
frustrating well I think it just says
 

13507
04:18:32,640 --> 04:18:36,189
frustrating well I think it just says
that it's not a kind of question that

13508
04:18:36,189 --> 04:18:36,199
that it's not a kind of question that
 

13509
04:18:36,199 --> 04:18:39,070
that it's not a kind of question that
you know it's there are things that it

13510
04:18:39,070 --> 04:18:39,080
you know it's there are things that it
 

13511
04:18:39,080 --> 04:18:42,429
you know it's there are things that it
is reasonable I mean there's kinds of

13512
04:18:42,429 --> 04:18:42,439
is reasonable I mean there's kinds of
 

13513
04:18:42,439 --> 04:18:43,389
is reasonable I mean there's kinds of
you know you can talk about

13514
04:18:43,389 --> 04:18:43,399
you know you can talk about
 

13515
04:18:43,399 --> 04:18:45,189
you know you can talk about
hypercomputation as well you can say

13516
04:18:45,189 --> 04:18:45,199
hypercomputation as well you can say
 

13517
04:18:45,199 --> 04:18:46,469
hypercomputation as well you can say
imagine there was a hypercom computer

13518
04:18:46,469 --> 04:18:46,479
imagine there was a hypercom computer
 

13519
04:18:46,479 --> 04:18:48,510
imagine there was a hypercom computer
here's what it would do so okay great it

13520
04:18:48,510 --> 04:18:48,520
here's what it would do so okay great it
 

13521
04:18:48,520 --> 04:18:49,670
here's what it would do so okay great it
would be lovely to have a hypercom

13522
04:18:49,670 --> 04:18:49,680
would be lovely to have a hypercom
 

13523
04:18:49,680 --> 04:18:50,910
would be lovely to have a hypercom
computer but unfortunately we can't make

13524
04:18:50,910 --> 04:18:50,920
computer but unfortunately we can't make
 

13525
04:18:50,920 --> 04:18:52,630
computer but unfortunately we can't make
it in the universe like it would be

13526
04:18:52,630 --> 04:18:52,640
it in the universe like it would be
 

13527
04:18:52,640 --> 04:18:53,990
it in the universe like it would be
lovely to answer this but unfortunately

13528
04:18:53,990 --> 04:18:54,000
lovely to answer this but unfortunately
 

13529
04:18:54,000 --> 04:18:56,510
lovely to answer this but unfortunately
we can't do it in the universe um and

13530
04:18:56,510 --> 04:18:56,520
we can't do it in the universe um and
 

13531
04:18:56,520 --> 04:18:59,109
we can't do it in the universe um and
you know this is all we have so to speak

13532
04:18:59,109 --> 04:18:59,119
you know this is all we have so to speak
 

13533
04:18:59,119 --> 04:19:00,950
you know this is all we have so to speak
um and I think it it's it's really just

13534
04:19:00,950 --> 04:19:00,960
um and I think it it's it's really just
 

13535
04:19:00,960 --> 04:19:03,429
um and I think it it's it's really just
a a statement it's sort of in the end

13536
04:19:03,429 --> 04:19:03,439
a a statement it's sort of in the end
 

13537
04:19:03,439 --> 04:19:05,229
a a statement it's sort of in the end
it'll be a a kind of a

13538
04:19:05,229 --> 04:19:05,239
it'll be a a kind of a
 

13539
04:19:05,239 --> 04:19:07,910
it'll be a a kind of a
logical logically inevitable statement I

13540
04:19:07,910 --> 04:19:07,920
logical logically inevitable statement I
 

13541
04:19:07,920 --> 04:19:10,030
logical logically inevitable statement I
think I think it will be something where

13542
04:19:10,030 --> 04:19:10,040
think I think it will be something where
 

13543
04:19:10,040 --> 04:19:12,790
think I think it will be something where
it is as you understand what it means to

13544
04:19:12,790 --> 04:19:12,800
it is as you understand what it means to
 

13545
04:19:12,800 --> 04:19:14,550
it is as you understand what it means to
have what it means to have a sort of

13546
04:19:14,550 --> 04:19:14,560
have what it means to have a sort of
 

13547
04:19:14,560 --> 04:19:16,790
have what it means to have a sort of
predicate of existence and what it means

13548
04:19:16,790 --> 04:19:16,800
predicate of existence and what it means
 

13549
04:19:16,800 --> 04:19:17,950
predicate of existence and what it means
to have these kinds of things it will

13550
04:19:17,950 --> 04:19:17,960
to have these kinds of things it will
 

13551
04:19:17,960 --> 04:19:19,910
to have these kinds of things it will
sort of be inevitable that this has to

13552
04:19:19,910 --> 04:19:19,920
sort of be inevitable that this has to
 

13553
04:19:19,920 --> 04:19:21,229
sort of be inevitable that this has to
be the case that from within that

13554
04:19:21,229 --> 04:19:21,239
be the case that from within that
 

13555
04:19:21,239 --> 04:19:23,750
be the case that from within that
Universe you can't establish the reason

13556
04:19:23,750 --> 04:19:23,760
Universe you can't establish the reason
 

13557
04:19:23,760 --> 04:19:25,349
Universe you can't establish the reason
for its existence so to speak you can't

13558
04:19:25,349 --> 04:19:25,359
for its existence so to speak you can't
 

13559
04:19:25,359 --> 04:19:27,070
for its existence so to speak you can't
prove that it exists and so on and

13560
04:19:27,070 --> 04:19:27,080
prove that it exists and so on and
 

13561
04:19:27,080 --> 04:19:29,109
prove that it exists and so on and
nevertheless because of computation or

13562
04:19:29,109 --> 04:19:29,119
nevertheless because of computation or
 

13563
04:19:29,119 --> 04:19:32,550
nevertheless because of computation or
reducibility the future is uh ultimately

13564
04:19:32,550 --> 04:19:32,560
reducibility the future is uh ultimately
 

13565
04:19:32,560 --> 04:19:34,189
reducibility the future is uh ultimately
not predictable full of mystery and

13566
04:19:34,189 --> 04:19:34,199
not predictable full of mystery and
 

13567
04:19:34,199 --> 04:19:36,950
not predictable full of mystery and
that's what makes life worth living

13568
04:19:36,950 --> 04:19:36,960
that's what makes life worth living
 

13569
04:19:36,960 --> 04:19:38,630
that's what makes life worth living
right I mean right and you know it's

13570
04:19:38,630 --> 04:19:38,640
right I mean right and you know it's
 

13571
04:19:38,640 --> 04:19:40,710
right I mean right and you know it's
funny for me because as a just a pure

13572
04:19:40,710 --> 04:19:40,720
funny for me because as a just a pure
 

13573
04:19:40,720 --> 04:19:43,149
funny for me because as a just a pure
sort of human being doing what I do

13574
04:19:43,149 --> 04:19:43,159
sort of human being doing what I do
 

13575
04:19:43,159 --> 04:19:45,590
sort of human being doing what I do
it's you know I'm I'm uh you know I like

13576
04:19:45,590 --> 04:19:45,600
it's you know I'm I'm uh you know I like
 

13577
04:19:45,600 --> 04:19:47,790
it's you know I'm I'm uh you know I like
I'm interested in people I like sort of

13578
04:19:47,790 --> 04:19:47,800
I'm interested in people I like sort of
 

13579
04:19:47,800 --> 04:19:49,870
I'm interested in people I like sort of
the you know the whole Human Experience

13580
04:19:49,870 --> 04:19:49,880
the you know the whole Human Experience
 

13581
04:19:49,880 --> 04:19:52,469
the you know the whole Human Experience
so to speak and yet it's a little bit

13582
04:19:52,469 --> 04:19:52,479
so to speak and yet it's a little bit
 

13583
04:19:52,479 --> 04:19:54,670
so to speak and yet it's a little bit
weird when I'm thinking you know it's

13584
04:19:54,670 --> 04:19:54,680
weird when I'm thinking you know it's
 

13585
04:19:54,680 --> 04:19:57,109
weird when I'm thinking you know it's
all hypergraphs down there and it's all

13586
04:19:57,109 --> 04:19:57,119
all hypergraphs down there and it's all
 

13587
04:19:57,119 --> 04:19:59,750
all hypergraphs down there and it's all
just uh hypergraphs all the way down

13588
04:19:59,750 --> 04:19:59,760
just uh hypergraphs all the way down
 

13589
04:19:59,760 --> 04:20:01,990
just uh hypergraphs all the way down
right like turtles all the way down

13590
04:20:01,990 --> 04:20:02,000
right like turtles all the way down
 

13591
04:20:02,000 --> 04:20:04,389
right like turtles all the way down
right and and and it's kind of you know

13592
04:20:04,389 --> 04:20:04,399
right and and and it's kind of you know
 

13593
04:20:04,399 --> 04:20:06,750
right and and and it's kind of you know
it's to me it is a funny thing because

13594
04:20:06,750 --> 04:20:06,760
it's to me it is a funny thing because
 

13595
04:20:06,760 --> 04:20:08,269
it's to me it is a funny thing because
every so often I get this you know as

13596
04:20:08,269 --> 04:20:08,279
every so often I get this you know as
 

13597
04:20:08,279 --> 04:20:09,870
every so often I get this you know as
I'm thinking about I think we've really

13598
04:20:09,870 --> 04:20:09,880
I'm thinking about I think we've really
 

13599
04:20:09,880 --> 04:20:11,710
I'm thinking about I think we've really
gotten you know we've really figured out

13600
04:20:11,710 --> 04:20:11,720
gotten you know we've really figured out
 

13601
04:20:11,720 --> 04:20:13,269
gotten you know we've really figured out
kind of the essence of how physics works

13602
04:20:13,269 --> 04:20:13,279
kind of the essence of how physics works
 

13603
04:20:13,279 --> 04:20:15,229
kind of the essence of how physics works
and I'm like thinking to myself you know

13604
04:20:15,229 --> 04:20:15,239
and I'm like thinking to myself you know
 

13605
04:20:15,239 --> 04:20:17,510
and I'm like thinking to myself you know
here's this physical thing and I'm like

13606
04:20:17,510 --> 04:20:17,520
here's this physical thing and I'm like
 

13607
04:20:17,520 --> 04:20:19,349
here's this physical thing and I'm like
you know this feels like a very definite

13608
04:20:19,349 --> 04:20:19,359
you know this feels like a very definite
 

13609
04:20:19,359 --> 04:20:21,030
you know this feels like a very definite
thing how can it be the case that this

13610
04:20:21,030 --> 04:20:21,040
thing how can it be the case that this
 

13611
04:20:21,040 --> 04:20:23,790
thing how can it be the case that this
is just some Ral reference frame of you

13612
04:20:23,790 --> 04:20:23,800
is just some Ral reference frame of you
 

13613
04:20:23,800 --> 04:20:26,710
is just some Ral reference frame of you
know this infinite creature that that is

13614
04:20:26,710 --> 04:20:26,720
know this infinite creature that that is
 

13615
04:20:26,720 --> 04:20:29,550
know this infinite creature that that is
uh so abstract and so on and I kind of

13616
04:20:29,550 --> 04:20:29,560
uh so abstract and so on and I kind of
 

13617
04:20:29,560 --> 04:20:32,510
uh so abstract and so on and I kind of
it is a it's a it's a funny sort of

13618
04:20:32,510 --> 04:20:32,520
it is a it's a it's a funny sort of
 

13619
04:20:32,520 --> 04:20:35,109
it is a it's a it's a funny sort of
feeling that that you know we are we're

13620
04:20:35,109 --> 04:20:35,119
feeling that that you know we are we're
 

13621
04:20:35,119 --> 04:20:38,109
feeling that that you know we are we're
sort of uh um it's like it's in the end

13622
04:20:38,109 --> 04:20:38,119
sort of uh um it's like it's in the end
 

13623
04:20:38,119 --> 04:20:40,830
sort of uh um it's like it's in the end
it's just sort of um be happy we're just

13624
04:20:40,830 --> 04:20:40,840
it's just sort of um be happy we're just
 

13625
04:20:40,840 --> 04:20:42,830
it's just sort of um be happy we're just
humans type thing and and it's it's kind

13626
04:20:42,830 --> 04:20:42,840
humans type thing and and it's it's kind
 

13627
04:20:42,840 --> 04:20:45,670
humans type thing and and it's it's kind
of like but but we're making we make

13628
04:20:45,670 --> 04:20:45,680
of like but but we're making we make
 

13629
04:20:45,680 --> 04:20:49,309
of like but but we're making we make
things as it's not like we're just a

13630
04:20:49,309 --> 04:20:49,319
things as it's not like we're just a
 

13631
04:20:49,319 --> 04:20:53,229
things as it's not like we're just a
tiny Speck we are in a sense the we are

13632
04:20:53,229 --> 04:20:53,239
tiny Speck we are in a sense the we are
 

13633
04:20:53,239 --> 04:20:56,070
tiny Speck we are in a sense the we are
more important by virtue of the fact

13634
04:20:56,070 --> 04:20:56,080
more important by virtue of the fact
 

13635
04:20:56,080 --> 04:21:00,109
more important by virtue of the fact
that in a sense it's not like there's

13636
04:21:00,109 --> 04:21:00,119
that in a sense it's not like there's
 

13637
04:21:00,119 --> 04:21:03,510
that in a sense it's not like there's
there is no ultimate you know it's like

13638
04:21:03,510 --> 04:21:03,520
there is no ultimate you know it's like
 

13639
04:21:03,520 --> 04:21:05,670
there is no ultimate you know it's like
we're important

13640
04:21:05,670 --> 04:21:05,680
we're important
 

13641
04:21:05,680 --> 04:21:08,510
we're important
because because you know we're here so

13642
04:21:08,510 --> 04:21:08,520
because because you know we're here so
 

13643
04:21:08,520 --> 04:21:10,269
because because you know we're here so
to speak and we're not it's not like

13644
04:21:10,269 --> 04:21:10,279
to speak and we're not it's not like
 

13645
04:21:10,279 --> 04:21:13,109
to speak and we're not it's not like
there's a thing where we're saying um

13646
04:21:13,109 --> 04:21:13,119
there's a thing where we're saying um
 

13647
04:21:13,119 --> 04:21:16,070
there's a thing where we're saying um
you know we are just but one sort of

13648
04:21:16,070 --> 04:21:16,080
you know we are just but one sort of
 

13649
04:21:16,080 --> 04:21:17,469
you know we are just but one sort of
intelligence out of all these other

13650
04:21:17,469 --> 04:21:17,479
intelligence out of all these other
 

13651
04:21:17,479 --> 04:21:20,550
intelligence out of all these other
intelligences and so you know ultimately

13652
04:21:20,550 --> 04:21:20,560
intelligences and so you know ultimately
 

13653
04:21:20,560 --> 04:21:22,269
intelligences and so you know ultimately
there'll be the Super intelligence which

13654
04:21:22,269 --> 04:21:22,279
there'll be the Super intelligence which
 

13655
04:21:22,279 --> 04:21:24,189
there'll be the Super intelligence which
is all of these put together and they'll

13656
04:21:24,189 --> 04:21:24,199
is all of these put together and they'll
 

13657
04:21:24,199 --> 04:21:25,590
is all of these put together and they'll
be very different from us no it's

13658
04:21:25,590 --> 04:21:25,600
be very different from us no it's
 

13659
04:21:25,600 --> 04:21:27,550
be very different from us no it's
actually going to be equivalent to us

13660
04:21:27,550 --> 04:21:27,560
actually going to be equivalent to us
 

13661
04:21:27,560 --> 04:21:30,429
actually going to be equivalent to us
and the thing that makes us sort of

13662
04:21:30,429 --> 04:21:30,439
and the thing that makes us sort of
 

13663
04:21:30,439 --> 04:21:34,510
and the thing that makes us sort of
special is just the details of us so to

13664
04:21:34,510 --> 04:21:34,520
special is just the details of us so to
 

13665
04:21:34,520 --> 04:21:35,910
special is just the details of us so to
speak it's not something where we can

13666
04:21:35,910 --> 04:21:35,920
speak it's not something where we can
 

13667
04:21:35,920 --> 04:21:39,070
speak it's not something where we can
say oh there's this other thing you know

13668
04:21:39,070 --> 04:21:39,080
say oh there's this other thing you know
 

13669
04:21:39,080 --> 04:21:41,389
say oh there's this other thing you know
just you think humans are cool just wait

13670
04:21:41,389 --> 04:21:41,399
just you think humans are cool just wait
 

13671
04:21:41,399 --> 04:21:43,229
just you think humans are cool just wait
until you've seen this

13672
04:21:43,229 --> 04:21:43,239
until you've seen this
 

13673
04:21:43,239 --> 04:21:44,510
until you've seen this
you know it's going to be much more

13674
04:21:44,510 --> 04:21:44,520
you know it's going to be much more
 

13675
04:21:44,520 --> 04:21:47,030
you know it's going to be much more
impressive well no it's all going to be

13676
04:21:47,030 --> 04:21:47,040
impressive well no it's all going to be
 

13677
04:21:47,040 --> 04:21:49,229
impressive well no it's all going to be
kind of computationally equivalent and

13678
04:21:49,229 --> 04:21:49,239
kind of computationally equivalent and
 

13679
04:21:49,239 --> 04:21:50,830
kind of computationally equivalent and
the thing that you know it's not going

13680
04:21:50,830 --> 04:21:50,840
the thing that you know it's not going
 

13681
04:21:50,840 --> 04:21:52,990
the thing that you know it's not going
to be oh this thing is is amazingly much

13682
04:21:52,990 --> 04:21:53,000
to be oh this thing is is amazingly much
 

13683
04:21:53,000 --> 04:21:55,269
to be oh this thing is is amazingly much
more impressive and amazingly much more

13684
04:21:55,269 --> 04:21:55,279
more impressive and amazingly much more
 

13685
04:21:55,279 --> 04:21:59,469
more impressive and amazingly much more
meaningful let's say no we're it I mean

13686
04:21:59,469 --> 04:21:59,479
meaningful let's say no we're it I mean
 

13687
04:21:59,479 --> 04:22:01,870
meaningful let's say no we're it I mean
that's that's that that's the um and and

13688
