feel so there's this rapid iterative

164
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,000
feel so there's this rapid iterative
 

165
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,550
feel so there's this rapid iterative
phase where you just build a prototype

166
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:10,560
phase where you just build a prototype
 

167
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,589
phase where you just build a prototype
that works launch it yeah see if people

168
00:03:12,589 --> 00:03:12,599
that works launch it yeah see if people
 

169
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,070
that works launch it yeah see if people
like it improving it really really

little bit more enough to pay and all
 

175
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,229
little bit more enough to pay and all
that that that whole rapid process is

176
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:20,239
that that that whole rapid process is
 

177
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,270

a pretty cool idea to do 12 startup in
 

1085
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:31,390
a pretty cool idea to do 12 startup in
12 months what what's it take to build a

1086
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:31,400
12 months what what's it take to build a
 

1087
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,669
12 months what what's it take to build a
thing in in in 30 days like at that time

1088
00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:34,679
thing in in in 30 days like at that time
 

1089
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:36,190
thing in in in 30 days like at that time
how hard was

1090
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:36,200
how hard was
 

1091
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,470
how hard was
that I think the hard part is like

1092
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:38,480
that I think the hard part is like
 

1093
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,789
that I think the hard part is like
figuring out what you shouldn't add

1094
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:39,799
figuring out what you shouldn't add
 

1095
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:41,230
figuring out what you shouldn't add
right what you shouldn't build because

1096
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:41,240
right what you shouldn't build because
 

1097
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,110
right what you shouldn't build because
you don't have time so you need to build

1098
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,120
you don't have time so you need to build
 

1099
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,870
you don't have time so you need to build

1109
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,990
login system like maybe no you know like
maybe you can build some Scrappy login

1110
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,000
maybe you can build some Scrappy login
 

1111
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,669
maybe you can build some Scrappy login
system like for fot you sign up you pay

1112
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:56,679
system like for fot you sign up you pay
 

1113

strap checkout and you get a login link

1114
00:18:58,990 --> 00:18:59,000
strap checkout and you get a login link
 

1115
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,230
strap checkout and you get a login link
and when I started it was only a login

1116
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:00,240
and when I started it was only a login
 

1117
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,710
and when I started it was only a login
link with a hash and that's just a

1118
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:01,720
link with a hash and that's just a
 

1119
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,710
link with a hash and that's just a
static link so it's very easy to log in

1120
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:03,720
static link so it's very easy to log in
 

1121
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,070
static link so it's very easy to log in
yeah it's not so safe you know what if

1122
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:05,080
yeah it's not so safe you know what if
 

1123
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,789
yeah it's not so safe you know what if
you leak the link and now I have real

1124
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:06,799
you leak the link and now I have real
 

1125
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,789
you leak the link and now I have real

Google login but that took like a year
 

1127
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,110
Google login but that took like a year

00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:04,950
and door knobs just the Design of
Everyday Things forks and spoons it's

1992
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:04,960
Everyday Things forks and spoons it's
 

1993
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,509
Everyday Things forks and spoons it's
going to be hard to come up with a fork

1994
00:34:06,509 --> 00:34:06,519
going to be hard to come up with a fork
 

1995
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:07,990
going to be hard to come up with a fork
that's better than the current Fork

1996
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:08,000
that's better than the current Fork
 

1997
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,349
that's better than the current Fork
designs yeah and the other aspect of it

1998
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:10,359
designs yeah and the other aspect of it
 

1999
00:34:10,359 --> 00:34:11,669
designs yeah and the other aspect of it
is you're saying like in order to come

2000
00:34:11,669 --> 00:34:11,679
is you're saying like in order to come
 

2001
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,909
is you're saying like in order to come
up with interesting ideas you got to try

2002
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:13,919
up with interesting ideas you got to try
 

2003
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:16,430
up with interesting ideas you got to try
to live a more interesting life yeah but

2004
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:16,440
to live a more interesting life yeah but
 

2005
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,230
to live a more interesting life yeah but
that's where travel comes in yeah

2006
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:18,240
that's where travel comes in yeah
 

2007
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,310
that's where travel comes in yeah
because when I started traveling I

2008
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:19,320
because when I started traveling I
 

2009
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,190
because when I started traveling I
started seeing stuff in other countries

2010
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:21,200
started seeing stuff in other countries
 

2011
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,470
started seeing stuff in other countries
that you didn't have in Europe for

2012
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:22,480
that you didn't have in Europe for
 

2013
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,270
that you didn't have in Europe for
example or America even like if you go

2014
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:24,280
example or America even like if you go
 

2015
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:28,349
example or America even like if you go
to Asia uh like dude especially 10 years

2016
00:34:28,349 --> 00:34:28,359
to Asia uh like dude especially 10 years
 

2017
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:30,109
to Asia uh like dude especially 10 years
ago nobody knew about this like weads

2018
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:30,119
ago nobody knew about this like weads
 

2019
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:31,909
ago nobody knew about this like weads
all these apps that they already had

2020
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:31,919
all these apps that they already had
 

2021
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:34,389
all these apps that they already had
before we had them these everything apps

2022
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:34,399
before we had them these everything apps
 

2023
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:35,869
before we had them these everything apps
right like now elon's trying to make X

2024
00:34:35,869 --> 00:34:35,879
right like now elon's trying to make X
 

2025
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:37,510
right like now elon's trying to make X
this everything app like WeChat the same

2026
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:37,520
this everything app like WeChat the same
 

2027
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,950
this everything app like WeChat the same
thing like in Indonesia or tand do you

2028
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:39,960
thing like in Indonesia or tand do you
 

2029
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,069
thing like in Indonesia or tand do you
have one app that you can order food

mechanic um anything you can think of is

2036
00:34:49,109 --> 00:34:49,119
mechanic um anything you can think of is
 

2037
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,710
mechanic um anything you can think of is
in the app and that stuff for example

2038
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:51,720
in the app and that stuff for example
 

2039
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,310
in the app and that stuff for example
you you know that's called like

2040
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:53,320
you you know that's called like
 

2041
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,829
you you know that's called like
Arbitrage you can go to back to your

2042
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:54,839
Arbitrage you can go to back to your
 

2043
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:56,869
Arbitrage you can go to back to your
country and build that same app for your

2044
00:34:56,869 --> 00:34:56,879
country and build that same app for your
 

2045
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,510
country and build that same app for your
country for example so you start seeing

2046
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:00,520
country for example so you start seeing
 

2047
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,430
country for example so you start seeing
um problems you start seeing solutions

2048
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:02,440
um problems you start seeing solutions
 

2049
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,589
um problems you start seeing solutions
that other countries already other

2050
00:35:03,589 --> 00:35:03,599
that other countries already other
 

2051
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:04,710
that other countries already other
people already did in the rest of the

2052
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:04,720
people already did in the rest of the
 

2053
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,790
people already did in the rest of the
world and also traveling in general just

2054
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:06,800
world and also traveling in general just
 

2055
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,190
world and also traveling in general just
gives you more problems cuz travel is

2056
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:10,200
gives you more problems cuz travel is
 

2057
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,790
gives you more problems cuz travel is
uncomfortable you know um airports are

2058
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:12,800
uncomfortable you know um airports are
 

2059
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,109
uncomfortable you know um airports are
horrible airplanes are not comfortable

2060
00:35:15,109 --> 00:35:15,119
horrible airplanes are not comfortable
 

2061
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,990
horrible airplanes are not comfortable
either there's a lot of problems you

2062
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:17,000
either there's a lot of problems you
 

2063
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,310
either there's a lot of problems you
start seeing just getting out of your

2064
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:18,320
start seeing just getting out of your
 

2065
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,430
start seeing just getting out of your
house you know but also you can I mean

2066
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:20,440
house you know but also you can I mean
 

2067
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,510
house you know but also you can I mean
in the digital world you can just go

2068
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:22,520
in the digital world you can just go
 

2069
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,390
in the digital world you can just go
into different communities and see what

2070
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:24,400
into different communities and see what
 

2071
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,109
into different communities and see what
can be improved by the in that yeah yeah

2072
00:35:28,109 --> 00:35:28,119
can be improved by the in that yeah yeah
 

2073
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:29,990
can be improved by the in that yeah yeah
but what specifically is your process of

2074
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:30,000
but what specifically is your process of
 

2075
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,630
but what specifically is your process of
generating ideas do you like do idea

2076
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:32,640
generating ideas do you like do idea
 

2077
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,069
generating ideas do you like do idea
dumps like do you have a document where

2078
00:35:34,069 --> 00:35:34,079
dumps like do you have a document where
 

2079
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:35,310
dumps like do you have a document where
you just keep writing yeah I used to

2080
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:35,320
you just keep writing yeah I used to
 

2081
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,750
you just keep writing yeah I used to
have like a because when I was when I

2082
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:36,760
have like a because when I was when I
 

2083
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,270
have like a because when I was when I
wasn't making money I was trying to like

2084
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:38,280
wasn't making money I was trying to like
 

2085
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,670
wasn't making money I was trying to like
make this list of ideas to see like so I

2086
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:40,680
make this list of ideas to see like so I
 

2087
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,230
make this list of ideas to see like so I
need to build I was thinking

2088
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:42,240
need to build I was thinking
 

2089
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,310
need to build I was thinking
statistically already like I need to

2090
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:43,320
statistically already like I need to
 

2091
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,630
statistically already like I need to
build all these things and one of these

2092
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:44,640
build all these things and one of these
 

2093
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,430
build all these things and one of these
will work out probably you know so I

2094
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:46,440
will work out probably you know so I
 

2095
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,349
will work out probably you know so I
need to have a lot of things to try um

2096
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:49,359
need to have a lot of things to try um
 

2097
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,150
need to have a lot of things to try um
and I did that right now I think like

2098
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:51,160
and I did that right now I think like
 

2099
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,550
and I did that right now I think like
because I already have money I can do

2100
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:52,560
because I already have money I can do
 

2101
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,470
because I already have money I can do
more things uh based on technology so

2102
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:55,480
more things uh based on technology so
 

2103
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,950
more things uh based on technology so
for example AI when I found out about

2104
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:57,960
for example AI when I found out about
 

2105
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,870
for example AI when I found out about
when stable diffusion came or C gbt and

2106
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:00,880
when stable diffusion came or C gbt and
 

2107
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,109
when stable diffusion came or C gbt and
stuff all this thing all these things

2108
00:36:02,109 --> 00:36:02,119
stuff all this thing all these things
 

2109
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:03,309
stuff all this thing all these things
were

2110
00:36:03,309 --> 00:36:03,319
were
 

2111
00:36:03,319 --> 00:36:05,589
were
like I didn't start working with them

2112
00:36:05,589 --> 00:36:05,599
like I didn't start working with them
 

2113
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:06,950
like I didn't start working with them
because I had a problem I had no

2114
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:06,960
because I had a problem I had no
 

2115
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,470
because I had a problem I had no
problems but I was very curious about

2116
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:09,480
problems but I was very curious about
 

2117
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,349
problems but I was very curious about
technology and I was like playing with

2118
00:36:12,349 --> 00:36:12,359
technology and I was like playing with
 

2119
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:14,630
technology and I was like playing with
it and figuring out like first just

2120
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:14,640
it and figuring out like first just
 

2121
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,990
it and figuring out like first just
playing with it and then and then you

2122
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:16,000
playing with it and then and then you
 

2123
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,510
playing with it and then and then you
find something like okay this generates

2124
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:18,520
find something like okay this generates
 

2125
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,030
find something like okay this generates
St Fusion generates houses very

2126
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:20,040
St Fusion generates houses very
 

2127
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,829
St Fusion generates houses very
beautiful and Interiors you know so it's

2128
00:36:21,829 --> 00:36:21,839
beautiful and Interiors you know so it's
 

2129
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,150
beautiful and Interiors you know so it's
less about problem solving it's more

2130
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:23,160
less about problem solving it's more
 

2131
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,630
less about problem solving it's more
about the possibilities of new things

2132
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:24,640
about the possibilities of new things
 

2133
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,390
about the possibilities of new things
you can create yeah but that's very

2134
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:26,400
you can create yeah but that's very
 

2135
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,109
you can create yeah but that's very
risky because that's the G is like a

2136
00:36:28,109 --> 00:36:28,119
risky because that's the G is like a
 

2137
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,990
risky because that's the G is like a
solution trying to find a problem yeah

2138
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:30,000
solution trying to find a problem yeah
 

2139
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,670
solution trying to find a problem yeah
and usually it doesn't work and that's

2140
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:31,680
and usually it doesn't work and that's
 

2141
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,550
and usually it doesn't work and that's
very common with with startup FS I think

2142
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:33,560
very common with with startup FS I think
 

2143
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,950
very common with with startup FS I think
they they have Tech but actually people

2144
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:35,960
they they have Tech but actually people
 

2145
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,309
they they have Tech but actually people
don't need to Tech right can you

2146
00:36:38,309 --> 00:36:38,319
don't need to Tech right can you
 

2147
00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:40,589
don't need to Tech right can you
actually explain it'd be cool to talk

2148
00:36:40,589 --> 00:36:40,599
actually explain it'd be cool to talk
 

2149
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:41,870
actually explain it'd be cool to talk
about some of the stuff you created can

2150
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:41,880
about some of the stuff you created can
 

2151
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,390
about some of the stuff you created can
you explain um this photo.com yeah yeah

2152
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:46,400
you explain um this photo.com yeah yeah
 

2153
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,030
you explain um this photo.com yeah yeah
so it's like fire your photographer the

2154
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:48,040
so it's like fire your photographer the
 

2155
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,030
so it's like fire your photographer the
idea is like you don't need a

2156
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:49,040
idea is like you don't need a
 

2157
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,790
idea is like you don't need a
photographer anymore you can train

2158
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:50,800
photographer anymore you can train
 

2159
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,150
photographer anymore you can train
yourself as AI model and you can take as

2160
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:53,160
yourself as AI model and you can take as
 

2161
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,069
yourself as AI model and you can take as
many photos you want anywhere in any

2162
00:36:55,069 --> 00:36:55,079
many photos you want anywhere in any
 

2163
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:58,349
many photos you want anywhere in any
clothes uh with facial expressions like

2164
00:36:58,349 --> 00:36:58,359
clothes uh with facial expressions like
 

2165
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:02,150
clothes uh with facial expressions like
happy or sad or poses uh all this stuff

2166
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:02,160
happy or sad or poses uh all this stuff
 

2167
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,630
happy or sad or poses uh all this stuff
so how does how does it work so this is

2168
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:04,640
so how does how does it work so this is
 

2169
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,390
so how does how does it work so this is
uh you send me a link to a gallery of

2170
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:08,400
uh you send me a link to a gallery of
 

2171
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,309
uh you send me a link to a gallery of
ones done on me which is so on the left

2172
00:37:10,309 --> 00:37:10,319
ones done on me which is so on the left
 

2173
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:12,030
ones done on me which is so on the left
you have the prompts the Box yeah so you

2174
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:12,040
you have the prompts the Box yeah so you
 

2175
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,790
you have the prompts the Box yeah so you
can write like so model is your model

2176
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:13,800
can write like so model is your model
 

2177
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,630
can write like so model is your model
this Lex Freedman so you can write like

2178
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:15,640
this Lex Freedman so you can write like
 

2179
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:18,069

what are you using for the hosting for

2186
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:23,480
what are you using for the hosting for
 

2187
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,910
what are you using for the hosting for
the compute replicates okay replicate

2188
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:25,920
the compute replicates okay replicate
 

2189
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,270
the compute replicates okay replicate
decom they're very very goods okay it's

2190
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:28,280
decom they're very very goods okay it's
 

2191
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,349
decom they're very very goods okay it's
cool like this interface wise it's cool

2192
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:30,359
cool like this interface wise it's cool
 

2193
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:31,470
cool like this interface wise it's cool
that you're showing how long it's going

2194
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:31,480
that you're showing how long it's going
 

2195
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,109
that you're showing how long it's going
to take this is amazing so it's taking a

2196
00:37:34,109 --> 00:37:34,119
to take this is amazing so it's taking a
 

2197
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:36,030
to take this is amazing so it's taking a
I'm presuming you just loaded in a few

2198
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:36,040
I'm presuming you just loaded in a few
 

2199
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,190
I'm presuming you just loaded in a few
pictures from the internet yeah so I

2200
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:38,200
pictures from the internet yeah so I
 

2201
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,790
pictures from the internet yeah so I
went to Google images St in Lex Freedman

2202
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:39,800
went to Google images St in Lex Freedman
 

2203
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,990
went to Google images St in Lex Freedman
I added like 10 or 20 images you can

2204
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:42,000
I added like 10 or 20 images you can
 

2205
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,230
I added like 10 or 20 images you can
open them in the gallery and you can use

2206
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:44,240
open them in the gallery and you can use
 

2207
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,030
open them in the gallery and you can use
your cursors to yeah so some don't look

2208
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:48,040
your cursors to yeah so some don't look
 

2209
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,630
your cursors to yeah so some don't look
like you so the hit or miss rate is like

2210
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:50,640
like you so the hit or miss rate is like
 

2211
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,630
like you so the hit or miss rate is like
I don't know say like 50/50 or something

2212
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:53,640
I don't know say like 50/50 or something
 

2213
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,069
I don't know say like 50/50 or something
but when I was watching your Tweet like

2214
00:37:55,069 --> 00:37:55,079
but when I was watching your Tweet like
 

2215
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:56,349
but when I was watching your Tweet like
it's been getting better and better and

2216
00:37:56,349 --> 00:37:56,359
it's been getting better and better and
 

2217
00:37:56,359 --> 00:37:58,109
it's been getting better and better and
better it was very bad in beginning it

2218
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:58,119
better it was very bad in beginning it
 

2219
00:37:58,119 --> 00:37:59,910
better it was very bad in beginning it
was so bad but still people sign up to

2220
00:37:59,910 --> 00:37:59,920
was so bad but still people sign up to
 

2221
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,670
was so bad but still people sign up to
it you know

2222
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:01,680
it you know
 

2223
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,190
it you know
uh there's there's two luxes is great

2224
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:05,200
uh there's there's two luxes is great
 

2225
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,589
uh there's there's two luxes is great
it's getting more and more sexual it's

2226
00:38:06,589 --> 00:38:06,599
it's getting more and more sexual it's
 

2227
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:08,349
it's getting more and more sexual it's
making me very uncomfortable man but

2228
00:38:08,349 --> 00:38:08,359
making me very uncomfortable man but
 

2229
00:38:08,359 --> 00:38:10,309
making me very uncomfortable man but
that's the problem with these models cuz

2230
00:38:10,309 --> 00:38:10,319
that's the problem with these models cuz
 

2231
00:38:10,319 --> 00:38:11,589
that's the problem with these models cuz
no we need to talk about this cuz the

2232
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:11,599
no we need to talk about this cuz the
 

2233
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,790
no we need to talk about this cuz the
models the fusion yeah so the

2234
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:13,800
models the fusion yeah so the
 

2235
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,390
models the fusion yeah so the
photorealistic models that are like fine

2236
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:15,400
photorealistic models that are like fine
 

2237
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,829
photorealistic models that are like fine
tuned they were all trained on porn in

2238
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:17,839
tuned they were all trained on porn in
 

2239
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:19,349
tuned they were all trained on porn in
the beginning and there was a guy called

2240
00:38:19,349 --> 00:38:19,359
the beginning and there was a guy called
 

2241
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,390
the beginning and there was a guy called
Hassan so I was trying to figure out how

2242
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:21,400
Hassan so I was trying to figure out how
 

2243
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,069
Hassan so I was trying to figure out how
to do photo realistic AI photos and it

2244
00:38:23,069 --> 00:38:23,079
to do photo realistic AI photos and it
 

2245
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:24,790
to do photo realistic AI photos and it
was stable diffusion by itself is not

2246
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:24,800
was stable diffusion by itself is not
 

2247
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,430
was stable diffusion by itself is not
doing that well like the faces look all

2248
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:26,440
doing that well like the faces look all
 

2249
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,309
doing that well like the faces look all
mangled yep

2250
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:28,319
mangled yep
 

2251
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:29,870
mangled yep
um and it doesn't have enough resolution

2252
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:29,880
um and it doesn't have enough resolution
 

2253
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,390
um and it doesn't have enough resolution
or something to to do that well so but I

2254
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:32,400
or something to to do that well so but I
 

2255
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,270
or something to to do that well so but I
started seeing these these um base

2256
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:34,280
started seeing these these um base
 

2257
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,710
started seeing these these um base
models these fine tune models and people

2258
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:35,720
models these fine tune models and people
 

2259
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,670
models these fine tune models and people
would train on porn and I would try them

2260
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:37,680
would train on porn and I would try them
 

2261
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,710
would train on porn and I would try them
and they would be very photo realistic

2262
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:39,720
and they would be very photo realistic
 

2263
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,109
and they would be very photo realistic
they would have bodies that actually

2264
00:38:41,109 --> 00:38:41,119
they would have bodies that actually
 

2265
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:45,910
they would have bodies that actually
made sense like body uh Anatomy um but

2266
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:45,920
made sense like body uh Anatomy um but
 

2267
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,190
made sense like body uh Anatomy um but
if you look at the photorealistic models

2268
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:47,200
if you look at the photorealistic models
 

2269
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,309
if you look at the photorealistic models
that people use now still there's still

2270
00:38:49,309 --> 00:38:49,319
that people use now still there's still
 

2271
00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:51,470
that people use now still there's still
core of porn there like of naked people

2272
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:51,480
core of porn there like of naked people
 

2273
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,309
core of porn there like of naked people
so I need to prompt out the nak and

2274
00:38:53,309 --> 00:38:53,319
so I need to prompt out the nak and
 

2275
00:38:53,319 --> 00:38:54,349
so I need to prompt out the nak and
everybody needs to do this with AI

2276
00:38:54,349 --> 00:38:54,359

you know naked um you have to keep
 

2283
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:02,109
you know naked um you have to keep
reminding the model you need to put

2284
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:02,119
reminding the model you need to put
 

2285
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:03,589

00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:11,040
because the time I I these things were
 

2451
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,829
because the time I I these things were
growing like this and I was launching

2452
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:12,839
growing like this and I was launching
 

2453
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:14,390
growing like this and I was launching
more project and I never had time it's

2454
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:14,400
more project and I never had time it's
 

2455
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,030
more project and I never had time it's
like one day you know I'll I'll start

2456
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:17,040
like one day you know I'll I'll start
 

2457
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,030
like one day you know I'll I'll start
coding properly and I never got to it I

2458
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:20,040
coding properly and I never got to it I
 

2459
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,589
coding properly and I never got to it I
I sometimes wonder if I need to learn

2460
00:42:21,589 --> 00:42:21,599
I sometimes wonder if I need to learn
 

2461
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,230
I sometimes wonder if I need to learn
that stuff it's still to-do atem for me

2462
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:23,240
that stuff it's still to-do atem for me
 

2463
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:27,230
that stuff it's still to-do atem for me
to really learn node.js or or flask or

2464
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:27,240
to really learn node.js or or flask or
 

2465
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:31,309
to really learn node.js or or flask or
these kind of react yeah react and it's

2466
00:42:31,309 --> 00:42:31,319
these kind of react yeah react and it's
 

2467
00:42:31,319 --> 00:42:34,470
these kind of react yeah react and it's
there it feels like a responsible

2468
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:34,480
there it feels like a responsible
 

2469
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,630
there it feels like a responsible
software engineer should know how to use

2470
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:37,640
software engineer should know how to use
 

2471
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,349
software engineer should know how to use
these but you can get stuff

2472
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:40,359
these but you can get stuff
 

2473
00:42:40,359 --> 00:42:43,870
these but you can get stuff
done so fast with vanilla versions of

2474
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:43,880
done so fast with vanilla versions of
 

2475
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,829
done so fast with vanilla versions of
stuff yeah it's like software developers

2476
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:45,839
stuff yeah it's like software developers
 

2477
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:46,950
stuff yeah it's like software developers
if you want to get a job and there's

2478
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:46,960
if you want to get a job and there's
 

2479
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,549
if you want to get a job and there's
like you know people making stuff like

2480
00:42:49,549 --> 00:42:49,559
like you know people making stuff like
 

2481
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:50,750
like you know people making stuff like
startups and if you want to be

2482
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:50,760
startups and if you want to be
 

2483
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,950
startups and if you want to be
entrepreneur probably you maybe

2484
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:52,960
entrepreneur probably you maybe
 

2485
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,270
entrepreneur probably you maybe
shouldn't I wonder if there's like I

2486
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:55,280
shouldn't I wonder if there's like I
 

2487
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,710
shouldn't I wonder if there's like I
really want to measure performance and

2488
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:57,720
really want to measure performance and
 

2489
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,030
really want to measure performance and
speed I think there's a deep wisdom in

2490
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:00,040
speed I think there's a deep wisdom in
 

2491
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,549
speed I think there's a deep wisdom in
that yeah I do think that Frameworks and

2492
00:43:02,549 --> 00:43:02,559
that yeah I do think that Frameworks and
 

2493
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:04,829
that yeah I do think that Frameworks and
just constantly wanting to learn the new

2494
00:43:04,829 --> 00:43:04,839
just constantly wanting to learn the new
 

2495
00:43:04,839 --> 00:43:07,390
just constantly wanting to learn the new
thing this complicated way of software

2496
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:07,400
thing this complicated way of software
 

2497
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,230
thing this complicated way of software
engineering gets in the way I'm not sure

2498
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:09,240
engineering gets in the way I'm not sure
 

2499
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,309
engineering gets in the way I'm not sure
what to say about that because

2500
00:43:10,309 --> 00:43:10,319
what to say about that because
 

2501
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:11,950
what to say about that because
definitely like you shouldn't build

2502
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:11,960
definitely like you shouldn't build
 

2503
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,510
definitely like you shouldn't build
everything from just vanilla JavaScript

2504
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:14,520
everything from just vanilla JavaScript
 

2505
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,950
everything from just vanilla JavaScript
or vanilla C for example C++ When You're

2506
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:17,960
or vanilla C for example C++ When You're
 

2507
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,030
or vanilla C for example C++ When You're
Building Systems engineering is like

2508
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:20,040
Building Systems engineering is like
 

2509
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,829
Building Systems engineering is like
there's a lot of benefits for a pointer

2510
00:43:22,829 --> 00:43:22,839
there's a lot of benefits for a pointer
 

2511
00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:24,430
there's a lot of benefits for a pointer
safety all that kind of stuff so I I

2512
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:24,440
safety all that kind of stuff so I I
 

2513
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,510
safety all that kind of stuff so I I
don't know but it just feels like you

2514
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:27,520
don't know but it just feels like you
 

2515
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,190
don't know but it just feels like you
can get so much more stuff done if you

2516
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:30,200
can get so much more stuff done if you
 

2517
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,309
can get so much more stuff done if you
don't care about how you do it man this

2518
00:43:33,309 --> 00:43:33,319
don't care about how you do it man this
 

2519
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,990
don't care about how you do it man this
is my most controversial take I think

2520
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:35,000
is my most controversial take I think
 

2521
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,230
is my most controversial take I think
and maybe I'm wrong but I feel like

2522
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:38,240
and maybe I'm wrong but I feel like
 

2523
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,069
and maybe I'm wrong but I feel like
there's Frameworks now that raise money

2524
00:43:40,069 --> 00:43:40,079
there's Frameworks now that raise money
 

2525
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:41,390
there's Frameworks now that raise money
they raise a lot of money like they

2526
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:41,400
they raise a lot of money like they
 

2527
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,549
they raise a lot of money like they
raise 50 million 100 million 300 million

2528
00:43:43,549 --> 00:43:43,559
raise 50 million 100 million 300 million
 

2529
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:46,150
raise 50 million 100 million 300 million
dollars and the idea is that you need to

2530
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:46,160
dollars and the idea is that you need to
 

2531
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,829
dollars and the idea is that you need to
make the developers the new developers

2532
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:47,839
make the developers the new developers
 

2533
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,549
make the developers the new developers
like when you're 18 or 20 years old

2534
00:43:49,549 --> 00:43:49,559
like when you're 18 or 20 years old
 

2535
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:53,430
like when you're 18 or 20 years old
right um get them to use this framework

2536
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:53,440
right um get them to use this framework
 

2537
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,870
right um get them to use this framework
and then add a platform to it like where

2538
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:55,880
and then add a platform to it like where
 

2539
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,589
and then add a platform to it like where
the framework can it's open source but

2540
00:43:58,589 --> 00:43:58,599
the framework can it's open source but
 

2541
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:00,589
the framework can it's open source but
you probably should use the platform

2542
00:44:00,589 --> 00:44:00,599
you probably should use the platform
 

2543
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:04,069
you probably should use the platform
which is paid to use it and the the cost

2544
00:44:04,069 --> 00:44:04,079
which is paid to use it and the the cost
 

2545
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:06,549
which is paid to use it and the the cost
of the platforms to host it are a

2546
00:44:06,549 --> 00:44:06,559
of the platforms to host it are a
 

2547
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:08,790
of the platforms to host it are a
thousand times higher than just hosting

2548
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:08,800
thousand times higher than just hosting
 

2549
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,470
thousand times higher than just hosting
it on a simple AWS server or VPS on

2550
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:11,480
it on a simple AWS server or VPS on
 

2551
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,950
it on a simple AWS server or VPS on
digital ocean right um so there's

2552
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:13,960
digital ocean right um so there's
 

2553
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,390
digital ocean right um so there's
obviously like a monetary incentive here

2554
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:15,400
obviously like a monetary incentive here
 

2555
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,990
obviously like a monetary incentive here
like we want to get a lot of developers

2556
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:17,000
like we want to get a lot of developers
 

2557
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,349
like we want to get a lot of developers
to use this technology and then we need

2558
00:44:18,349 --> 00:44:18,359
to use this technology and then we need
 

2559
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:19,309
to use this technology and then we need
to charge them money because they're

2560
00:44:19,309 --> 00:44:19,319
to charge them money because they're
 

2561
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:21,270
to charge them money because they're
going to use it in startups and then the

2562
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:21,280
going to use it in startups and then the
 

2563
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,510
going to use it in startups and then the
starts can pay for the bills um but what

2564
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:24,520
starts can pay for the bills um but what
 

2565
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:28,430
starts can pay for the bills um but what
that it kind of destroys the

2566
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:28,440
that it kind of destroys the
 

2567
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,309
that it kind of destroys the
the information out there about learning

2568
00:44:30,309 --> 00:44:30,319
the information out there about learning
 

2569
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:32,230
the information out there about learning
to code because they you know they pay

2570
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:32,240
to code because they you know they pay
 

2571
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,069
to code because they you know they pay
YouTubers they pay influencers developer

2572
00:44:35,069 --> 00:44:35,079
YouTubers they pay influencers developer
 

2573
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:37,790
YouTubers they pay influencers developer
influen is a big thing to like um and

2574
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:37,800
influen is a big thing to like um and
 

2575
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,069

nutrition in Fitness or something same
 

2579
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,190

thing happens in developing they pay

2580
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:42,200
thing happens in developing they pay

this influen to promote the stuff use it

2582
00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:44,839
this influen to promote the stuff use it
 

2583

make stuff with it make demo product
 

2585
00:44:46,359 --> 00:44:47,589
make stuff with it make demo product
with it and then a lot of people like

with it and then a lot of people like
 

2587
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,990
with it and then a lot of people like
wow uh use this and I started noticing

2588
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:50,000
wow uh use this and I started noticing
 

2589
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,589
wow uh use this and I started noticing
this because when I was ship my stuff

2590
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:51,599
this because when I was ship my stuff
 

2591
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,750
this because when I was ship my stuff
people would ask me what are you using I

2592
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:53,760
people would ask me what are you using I
 

2593
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,630
people would ask me what are you using I
I would say I just PHP JQ why does it

2594
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:55,640
I would say I just PHP JQ why does it
 

2595
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,030
I would say I just PHP JQ why does it
matter and people would start kind of

2596
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:57,040
matter and people would start kind of
 

2597
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,670
matter and people would start kind of
attacking me like why are you not using

2598
00:44:58,670 --> 00:44:58,680
attacking me like why are you not using
 

2599
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,510
attacking me like why are you not using
this new technology this new framework

2600
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:00,520
this new technology this new framework
 

2601
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,230
this new technology this new framework
this new thing and I say I don't know

2602
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:02,240
this new thing and I say I don't know
 

2603
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,990
this new thing and I say I don't know
cuz this PHP thing works and I don't

2604
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:04,000
cuz this PHP thing works and I don't
 

2605
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,190
cuz this PHP thing works and I don't
really I'm optimizing for anything just

2606
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:06,200
really I'm optimizing for anything just
 

2607
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,470
really I'm optimizing for anything just
doing it just works and I never

2608
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:08,480
doing it just works and I never
 

2609
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,630
doing it just works and I never
understood like why uh like I understand

2610
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:10,640
understood like why uh like I understand
 

2611
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,430
understood like why uh like I understand
there's new technologies that are better

2612
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:12,440
there's new technologies that are better
 

2613
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,430
there's new technologies that are better
and it should be Improvement but I'm

2614
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:14,440
and it should be Improvement but I'm
 

2615
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,630
and it should be Improvement but I'm
very suspicious of money just like

2616
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:16,640
very suspicious of money just like
 

2617
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,309
very suspicious of money just like
lobbying there's money in this developer

2618
00:45:19,309 --> 00:45:19,319
lobbying there's money in this developer
 

2619
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:21,750
lobbying there's money in this developer
framework scene there's hundreds of

2620
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:21,760
framework scene there's hundreds of
 

2621
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,549
framework scene there's hundreds of
millions that goes to ads or influenc or

2622
00:45:24,549 --> 00:45:24,559
millions that goes to ads or influenc or
 

2623
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:26,470
millions that goes to ads or influenc or
whatever it can't all go to developers

2624
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:26,480
whatever it can't all go to developers
 

2625
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,069
whatever it can't all go to developers
you don't need Developers for framework

2626
00:45:28,069 --> 00:45:28,079
you don't need Developers for framework
 

2627
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:29,309
you don't need Developers for framework
and it's open

2628
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:29,319
and it's open
 

2629
00:45:29,319 --> 00:45:31,750
and it's open
source to make a lot of more money on

2630
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:31,760
source to make a lot of more money on
 

2631
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,390
source to make a lot of more money on
these startups so that's a really good

2632
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:33,400
these startups so that's a really good
 

2633
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,270
these startups so that's a really good
perspective but in addition to that is

2634
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:35,280
perspective but in addition to that is
 

2635
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,470
perspective but in addition to that is
like when you say

2636
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:36,480
like when you say
 

2637
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,230
like when you say
better it's

2638
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:39,240
better it's
 

2639
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,150
better it's
like can we get some data on the better

2640
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:42,160
like can we get some data on the better
 

2641
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,030
like can we get some data on the better
because like I want to know from the

2642
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:44,040
because like I want to know from the
 

2643
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,670
because like I want to know from the
individual developer perspective and

2644
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:46,680
individual developer perspective and
 

2645
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,630
individual developer perspective and
then from a team of five team of 10 team

2649
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,589
of 20 developers
yeah uh measure how productive they are

2650
00:45:53,589 --> 00:45:53,599
yeah uh measure how productive they are
 

2651
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:56,510
yeah uh measure how productive they are
in uh shipping features how many bugs

2652
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:56,520
in uh shipping features how many bugs
 

2653
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,790
in uh shipping features how many bugs
they create

2654
00:45:57,790 --> 00:45:57,800
they create
 

2655
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,230
they create
how many security holes uhp was not good

2656
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:01,240
how many security holes uhp was not good
 

2657
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,589
how many security holes uhp was not good
of security for a while but now it's

2658
00:46:02,589 --> 00:46:02,599
of security for a while but now it's
 

2659
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:06,150
of security for a while but now it's
good in theory in theory is it though

00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:06,160
good in theory in theory is it though
 

2661
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,670

now no no now as as you're saying it I
 

2663
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,349
now no no now as as you're saying it I
want to know if that's true because PHP

2664
00:46:12,349 --> 00:46:12,359
want to know if that's true because PHP
 

2665
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:15,069
want to know if that's true because PHP
was just the majority of websites on the

a gigantic number of security holes I

2674
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:24,240
a gigantic number of security holes I
 

2675
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,829
a gigantic number of security holes I
don't know if that's true I I know it

2676
00:46:25,829 --> 00:46:25,839
don't know if that's true I I know it
 

2677
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:28,030
don't know if that's true I I know it
gets attacked a lot because it's so

2681
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,230
popular it definitely does have security
holes but maybe a lot of other systems

00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:32,240
holes but maybe a lot of other systems
 

2683
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,470
holes but maybe a lot of other systems
have security holes as well anyway like

00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:34,480
have security holes as well anyway like

I just sort of questioning the

2686
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:35,800
I just sort of questioning the
 

2687
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,270
I just sort of questioning the
conventional wisdom that keeps wanting

2688
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:37,280
conventional wisdom that keeps wanting
 

2689
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,870
conventional wisdom that keeps wanting

to push software Engineers towards
 

2691
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,510
to push software Engineers towards
Frameworks towards

00:46:45,069 --> 00:46:45,079
complex like uh super complicated sort
 

2695
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:46,710
complex like uh super complicated sort
of software engineering approaches that

2696
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:46,720
of software engineering approaches that
 

2697
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,109
of software engineering approaches that
stretch out the the time it takes to

2698
00:46:49,109 --> 00:46:49,119
stretch out the the time it takes to
 

2699
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,470
stretch out the the time it takes to
actually build a thing 100% And it's the

2700
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:51,480
actually build a thing 100% And it's the
 

2701
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,430
actually build a thing 100% And it's the
same thing with big corporations 80% of

2702
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:53,440
same thing with big corporations 80% of
 

2703
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,990
same thing with big corporations 80% of
the people don't do anything it's like

2704
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:55,000
the people don't do anything it's like
 

2705
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,549
the people don't do anything it's like
it's not efficient and and if you if

2706
00:46:58,549 --> 00:46:58,559
it's not efficient and and if you if
 

2707
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:01,030
it's not efficient and and if you if
your your your benchmark is like uh

2708
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:01,040
your your your benchmark is like uh
 

2709
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,470
your your your benchmark is like uh
people building stuff that actually gets

2710
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:03,480
people building stuff that actually gets
 

2711
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,270
people building stuff that actually gets
done and like for society right like if

2712
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:05,280
done and like for society right like if
 

2713
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,790
done and like for society right like if
we want to save time we should probably

2714
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:06,800
we want to save time we should probably
 

2715
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,230
we want to save time we should probably
use technology that's

2716
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:09,240
use technology that's
 

2717
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,870
use technology that's
um that's simple that's pragmatic that's

2718
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:11,880
um that's simple that's pragmatic that's
 

2719
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,390
um that's simple that's pragmatic that's
like that works uh that's not overly

2720
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:14,400
like that works uh that's not overly
 

2721
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,630
like that works uh that's not overly
complicated doesn't make your life like

00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:16,640
complicated doesn't make your life like
 

2723
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,829
complicated doesn't make your life like
a living hell you know and use a

2724
00:47:18,829 --> 00:47:18,839
a living hell you know and use a
 

2725
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:21,109
a living hell you know and use a
framework when it obviously solves a

2726
00:47:21,109 --> 00:47:21,119
framework when it obviously solves a
 

2727
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:22,829
framework when it obviously solves a
problem a direct problem that you of

2728
00:47:22,829 --> 00:47:22,839
problem a direct problem that you of
 

2729
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:24,230
problem a direct problem that you of
course you yeah of course I'm not saying

2730
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:24,240
course you yeah of course I'm not saying
 

2731
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,870
course you yeah of course I'm not saying
you should code without a framework you

2732
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:25,880
you should code without a framework you
 

2733
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,829
you should code without a framework you
should use whatever you want

2734
00:47:27,829 --> 00:47:27,839
should use whatever you want
 

2735
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,030
should use whatever you want
but yeah I think it's suspicious you

2736
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:30,040
but yeah I think it's suspicious you
 

2737
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,510
but yeah I think it's suspicious you
know and um and I think when I talk

2738
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:32,520
know and um and I think when I talk
 

2739
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,150
know and um and I think when I talk
about on Twitter like there's a lot this

2740
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:34,160
about on Twitter like there's a lot this
 

2741
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,750
about on Twitter like there's a lot this
this Army comes out you know this this

2742
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:35,760
this Army comes out you know this this
 

2743
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,950
this Army comes out you know this this
these framework armies yeah man

2744
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:37,960
these framework armies yeah man
 

2745
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,349
these framework armies yeah man
something my gut tells me you I want to

2746
00:47:40,349 --> 00:47:40,359
something my gut tells me you I want to
 

2747
00:47:40,359 --> 00:47:41,910
something my gut tells me you I want to
ask the framework Army what have they

2748
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:41,920
ask the framework Army what have they
 

2749
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,270
ask the framework Army what have they
built this week it's the Elon question

is pretty incredible I'm also just
 

2765
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,309
is pretty incredible I'm also just
looking at the interface it's really

2766
00:48:00,309 --> 00:48:00,319
looking at the interface it's really
 

2767
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:02,710
looking at the interface it's really
well done so this is all just jQuery and

2768
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:02,720
well done so this is all just jQuery and
 

2769
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,790
well done so this is all just jQuery and
yeah this is really well done so like

2770
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:04,800
yeah this is really well done so like
 

2771
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,510
yeah this is really well done so like
tell take me through the Journey of

2772
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:06,520
tell take me through the Journey of
 

2773
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:10,270
tell take me through the Journey of
photo AI like you don't know much most

2774
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:10,280
photo AI like you don't know much most
 

2775
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,030
photo AI like you don't know much most
of the world doesn't know much about uh

2776
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:12,040
of the world doesn't know much about uh
 

2777
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,309
of the world doesn't know much about uh
stable diffusion or any of this any of

2778
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:14,319
stable diffusion or any of this any of
 

2779
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:16,309
stable diffusion or any of this any of
the generative AI stuff and so you're

2780
00:48:16,309 --> 00:48:16,319
the generative AI stuff and so you're
 

2781
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:18,190
the generative AI stuff and so you're
thinking okay how can I build cool stuff

2782
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:18,200
thinking okay how can I build cool stuff
 

2783
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,790
thinking okay how can I build cool stuff
with this what was the origin story of

2784
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:20,800
with this what was the origin story of
 

2785
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,710
with this what was the origin story of
photo AI I think uh it started cuz

2786
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:22,720
photo AI I think uh it started cuz
 

2787
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,270
photo AI I think uh it started cuz
stable diffusion came out so stable

2788
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:24,280
stable diffusion came out so stable
 

2789
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:25,829
stable diffusion came out so stable
diffusion is like this the first like

2790
00:48:25,829 --> 00:48:25,839
diffusion is like this the first like
 

2791
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:28,549
diffusion is like this the first like
generative image mod model AI model and

2792
00:48:28,549 --> 00:48:28,559
generative image mod model AI model and
 

2793
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:29,990
generative image mod model AI model and
um I started playing with it like you

2794
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:30,000
um I started playing with it like you
 

2795
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,270
um I started playing with it like you
could install it on your Mac like

2796
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:31,280
could install it on your Mac like
 

2797
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,109
could install it on your Mac like
somebody forked it and made it work for

2798
00:48:33,109 --> 00:48:33,119
somebody forked it and made it work for
 

2799
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,549
somebody forked it and made it work for
MacBooks so I downloaded it and uh

2800
00:48:35,549 --> 00:48:35,559
MacBooks so I downloaded it and uh
 

2801
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:37,150
MacBooks so I downloaded it and uh
cloned the repo and started using it to

2802
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:37,160
cloned the repo and started using it to
 

2803
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:41,270
cloned the repo and started using it to
generate images um and it was like

2804
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:41,280
generate images um and it was like
 

2805
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,589
generate images um and it was like
amazing like it would I found it on

2806
00:48:43,589 --> 00:48:43,599
amazing like it would I found it on
 

2807
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,190
amazing like it would I found it on
Twitter because you see things happen on

2808
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:45,200
Twitter because you see things happen on
 

2809
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,270
Twitter because you see things happen on
Twitter and I I would post what I was

2810
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:47,280
Twitter and I I would post what I was
 

2811
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,630
Twitter and I I would post what I was
making on Twitter as well and you could

2812
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:49,640
making on Twitter as well and you could
 

2813
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,589
making on Twitter as well and you could
make any image you could write a prompt

2814
00:48:51,589 --> 00:48:51,599
make any image you could write a prompt
 

2815
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,190
make any image you could write a prompt
to essentially write a prompt and then

2816
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:53,200
to essentially write a prompt and then
 

2817
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,349
to essentially write a prompt and then
it generates a photo of that or image of

2818
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:55,359
it generates a photo of that or image of
 

2819
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:57,789
it generates a photo of that or image of
that um in any style like they would use

2820
00:48:57,789 --> 00:48:57,799
that um in any style like they would use
 

2821
00:48:57,799 --> 00:48:59,870
that um in any style like they would use
like artist names to make like a Picasso

2822
00:48:59,870 --> 00:48:59,880
like artist names to make like a Picasso
 

2823
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,150
like artist names to make like a Picasso
kind of style and stuff um and I was

2824
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:03,160
kind of style and stuff um and I was
 

2825
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:06,390
kind of style and stuff um and I was
trying to see like what is it good at is

2826
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:06,400
trying to see like what is it good at is
 

2827
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,910
trying to see like what is it good at is
it good at people no it's really bad at

2828
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:07,920
it good at people no it's really bad at
 

2829
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,309
it good at people no it's really bad at
people but it was good at houses so

2830
00:49:10,309 --> 00:49:10,319
people but it was good at houses so
 

2831
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:11,349
people but it was good at houses so
architecture for example I would

2832
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:11,359
architecture for example I would
 

2833
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:14,789
architecture for example I would
generate like architecture houses um so

2834
00:49:14,789 --> 00:49:14,799
generate like architecture houses um so
 

2835
00:49:14,799 --> 00:49:17,069
generate like architecture houses um so
I made a website called this house does

2836
00:49:17,069 --> 00:49:17,079
I made a website called this house does
 

2837
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:20,309
I made a website called this house does
exist. org and it generated like they

2838
00:49:20,309 --> 00:49:20,319
exist. org and it generated like they
 

2839
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:23,030
exist. org and it generated like they
called like house porn and that one like

2840
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:23,040
called like house porn and that one like
 

2841
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,950
called like house porn and that one like
house porn it's like a subreddit so and

2842
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:24,960
house porn it's like a subreddit so and
 

2843
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,150
house porn it's like a subreddit so and
this was stable diffusion like the first

2844
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:26,160
this was stable diffusion like the first
 

2845
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,829
this was stable diffusion like the first
version so looks really you can click

2846
00:49:27,829 --> 00:49:27,839
version so looks really you can click
 

2847
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,710
version so looks really you can click
for another photo so it generates like

2848
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:30,720
for another photo so it generates like
 

2849
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,030
for another photo so it generates like
all these kind of non-existing houses it

2850
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:34,040
all these kind of non-existing houses it
 

2851
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,630
all these kind of non-existing houses it
is house point but it looked kind of

2852
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:35,640
is house point but it looked kind of
 

2853
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,309
is house point but it looked kind of
good you know like especially back then

how is this not more popular it was

2882
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:12,760
how is this not more popular it was
 

2883
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,349
how is this not more popular it was
really popular for like a while but then

2884
00:50:14,349 --> 00:50:14,359
really popular for like a while but then
 

2885
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:17,190
really popular for like a while but then
people got so bored of it I think cuz I

2886
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:17,200
people got so bored of it I think cuz I
 

2887
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,630
people got so bored of it I think cuz I
was getting bored of it too like just

2888
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:19,640
was getting bored of it too like just
 

2889
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,069
was getting bored of it too like just
continuous house porn like everything

2890
00:50:21,069 --> 00:50:21,079
continuous house porn like everything
 

2891
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:23,470
continuous house porn like everything
starts looking the same but then I

2892
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:23,480
starts looking the same but then I
 

2893
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,349
starts looking the same but then I
thought it was really good at interior

2894
00:50:25,349 --> 00:50:25,359
thought it was really good at interior
 

2895
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:28,549
thought it was really good at interior
so I pivoted to interior ai.com

2896
00:50:28,549 --> 00:50:28,559
so I pivoted to interior ai.com
 

2897
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:31,589
so I pivoted to interior ai.com
where um I tried to like upload first

2898
00:50:31,589 --> 00:50:31,599
where um I tried to like upload first
 

2899
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,309
where um I tried to like upload first
generate interior designs and then I

2900
00:50:33,309 --> 00:50:33,319
generate interior designs and then I
 

2901
00:50:33,319 --> 00:50:34,670
generate interior designs and then I
tried to do like there was a new

2902
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:34,680
tried to do like there was a new
 

2903
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,630
tried to do like there was a new
technology called image to image where

2904
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:36,640
technology called image to image where
 

2905
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,990
technology called image to image where
you can input an image like a photo and

2906
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:39,000
you can input an image like a photo and
 

2907
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,030
you can input an image like a photo and
it would kind of modify the thing mhm so

2908
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:42,040
it would kind of modify the thing mhm so
 

2909
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,109
it would kind of modify the thing mhm so
you see it looks almost the same as

2910
00:50:43,109 --> 00:50:43,119
you see it looks almost the same as
 

2911
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:46,950
you see it looks almost the same as

00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,950
you look wrong you know mhm so I started
making photo AI which was like a pivot

3094
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:01,960
making photo AI which was like a pivot
 

3095
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,750
making photo AI which was like a pivot
of it where it was like a photo studio

you had to do love curation cuz 99% of

3180
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:44,640
you had to do love curation cuz 99% of
 

3181

remember from that time for like what
 

3199
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:07,829
remember from that time for like what
you have to figure out to make it work

3200
00:56:07,829 --> 00:56:07,839
you have to figure out to make it work
 

3201
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:09,510
you have to figure out to make it work
and for people just listening he

00:56:21,319 --> 00:56:24,710
they're Square photos so they're 512 by
512 mhm because that's stable fusion um

3216
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:24,720
512 mhm because that's stable fusion um
 

3217
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,870
512 mhm because that's stable fusion um
but nevertheless not great captures the

3218
00:56:26,870 --> 00:56:26,880
but nevertheless not great captures the
 

3219
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:31,270
but nevertheless not great captures the
face like it's not it's not like a uh

3220
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:31,280
face like it's not it's not like a uh
 

3221
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,910
face like it's not it's not like a uh
collection of several hundred photos

3222
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:32,920
collection of several hundred photos
 

3223
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:35,510
collection of several hundred photos
that it's like exactly like I I would

3224
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:35,520
that it's like exactly like I I would
 

3225
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,630
that it's like exactly like I I would
imagine that too when I started I was

3226
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:36,640
imagine that too when I started I was
 

3227
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,510
imagine that too when I started I was
like a this must be like some 3D scan

3228
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:38,520
like a this must be like some 3D scan
 

3229
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,190
like a this must be like some 3D scan
technology right yeah so I think the

3230
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:40,200
technology right yeah so I think the
 

3231
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,990
technology right yeah so I think the
cool thing with AI it trains the concept

3232
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:42,000
cool thing with AI it trains the concept
 

3233
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,589
cool thing with AI it trains the concept
of you so it's literally like learning

3234
00:56:44,589 --> 00:56:44,599
of you so it's literally like learning
 

3235
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:46,430
of you so it's literally like learning
just like any AI model leurs it learns

3236
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:46,440
just like any AI model leurs it learns
 

3237
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,950
just like any AI model leurs it learns

3249
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:01,750
like okay this is obviously a business
but I didn't have time to code it uh

3250
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:01,760
but I didn't have time to code it uh
 

3251
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,390
but I didn't have time to code it uh
make a whole like app about it so I made

3252
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:04,400
make a whole like app about it so I made
 

3253
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,589
make a whole like app about it so I made
a HTML page um registered a domain name

3254
00:57:08,589 --> 00:57:08,599
a HTML page um registered a domain name
 

3255
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:10,470
a HTML page um registered a domain name
and this was not even it was a stripe

3256
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:10,480
and this was not even it was a stripe
 

3257
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,390
and this was not even it was a stripe
payment link which means you have uh

3258
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:12,400
payment link which means you have uh
 

3259
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,630
payment link which means you have uh
literally link to stripe to pay but

3260
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:14,640
literally link to stripe to pay but
 

3261
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,670
literally link to stripe to pay but
there's no code in the back so all you

3262
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:16,680
there's no code in the back so all you
 

3263
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,430
there's no code in the back so all you
know is you have customers that paid

3264
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:18,440
know is you have customers that paid
 

3265
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:21,829
know is you have customers that paid
money then I added like a some uh a typ

3266
00:57:21,829 --> 00:57:21,839
money then I added like a some uh a typ
 

3267
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:23,390
money then I added like a some uh a typ
form link so Ty form is a site where you

3268
00:57:23,390 --> 00:57:23,400
form link so Ty form is a site where you
 

3269

can have create like your own um input
 

3271
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,150
can have create like your own um input
form like Google forms so they would get

3272
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:28,160
form like Google forms so they would get
 

3273
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,470
form like Google forms so they would get
a email with a link to the type form or

3274

a email with a link to the type form or

enter their email upload the photos and
um and I launched it and I was like here

3282
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:38,960
um and I launched it and I was like here
 

3283
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,230
um and I launched it and I was like here
first sale so this October

3284
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:41,240
first sale so this October
 

3285
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,789
first sale so this October
2022 and I think within like the first

3286
00:57:43,789 --> 00:57:43,799
2022 and I think within like the first
 

3287
00:57:43,799 --> 00:57:45,990
2022 and I think within like the first
24 hours was like I'm not sure it was

3288
00:57:45,990 --> 00:57:46,000
24 hours was like I'm not sure it was
 

3289
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,190
24 hours was like I'm not sure it was
like a thousand customers or something

3290
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:48,200
like a thousand customers or something
 

3291
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,349
like a thousand customers or something
um but the problem was I didn't have

3292
00:57:50,349 --> 00:57:50,359
um but the problem was I didn't have
 

3293
00:57:50,359 --> 00:57:51,829
um but the problem was I didn't have
code to automate this so I had to do

3294
00:57:51,829 --> 00:57:51,839
code to automate this so I had to do
 

3295
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:54,109
code to automate this so I had to do
manually so the first few hundred I just

3296
00:57:54,109 --> 00:57:54,119
manually so the first few hundred I just
 

3297
00:57:54,119 --> 00:57:56,750
manually so the first few hundred I just
literally took their photos uh train

3298
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:56,760
literally took their photos uh train
 

3299
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,349
literally took their photos uh train
them and then I would generate the

3300
00:57:58,349 --> 00:57:58,359
them and then I would generate the
 

3301
00:57:58,359 --> 00:57:59,910
them and then I would generate the
photos with the prompts and I had this

3302
00:57:59,910 --> 00:57:59,920
photos with the prompts and I had this
 

3303
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,109
photos with the prompts and I had this
text file with the promps and I would do

3304
00:58:01,109 --> 00:58:01,119
text file with the promps and I would do
 

3305
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:02,990
text file with the promps and I would do
everything manually and this quickly

3306
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:03,000
everything manually and this quickly
 

3307
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,109
everything manually and this quickly
became way too much so but that's

3308
00:58:05,109 --> 00:58:05,119
became way too much so but that's
 

3309
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:07,789
became way too much so but that's
another constraint like I was forced to

3310
00:58:07,789 --> 00:58:07,799
another constraint like I was forced to
 

3311
00:58:07,799 --> 00:58:10,109
another constraint like I was forced to
code something up uh that would do that

3312
00:58:10,109 --> 00:58:10,119
code something up uh that would do that
 

3313
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:11,910
code something up uh that would do that
and that was essentially making it into

3314
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:11,920
and that was essentially making it into
 

3315
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,470
and that was essentially making it into
a real website right so first it was the

3316
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:13,480
a real website right so first it was the
 

3317
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:14,910
a real website right so first it was the
type form and they uploaded through the

3318
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:14,920
type form and they uploaded through the
 

3319
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:17,549
type form and they uploaded through the
typ form strip check out form yeah and

3320
00:58:17,549 --> 00:58:17,559
typ form strip check out form yeah and
 

3321
00:58:17,559 --> 00:58:18,710
typ form strip check out form yeah and
then you were like that image is

3322
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:18,720
then you were like that image is
 

3323
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,349
then you were like that image is
downloaded did you write a script to

3324
00:58:20,349 --> 00:58:20,359
downloaded did you write a script to
 

3325
00:58:20,359 --> 00:58:22,549
downloaded did you write a script to
export down download the images myself

3326
00:58:22,549 --> 00:58:22,559
export down download the images myself
 

3327
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:25,069
export down download the images myself
it's a zip file unzip file you unzipped

3328
00:58:25,069 --> 00:58:25,079
it's a zip file unzip file you unzipped
 

3329
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:27,950
it's a zip file unzip file you unzipped
it un yes and then I no I'm because you

any ml model any AI model llms you can
 

3521
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:38,029
any ml model any AI model llms you can
run on here and you can scale yes they

3522
01:01:38,029 --> 01:01:38,039
run on here and you can scale yes they
 

3523
01:01:38,039 --> 01:01:39,950
run on here and you can scale yes they
scale yeah yeah and I mean you can do

3524
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:39,960
scale yeah yeah and I mean you can do
 

3525
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,349
scale yeah yeah and I mean you can do
now you can click on the model and just

3526
01:01:41,349 --> 01:01:41,359
now you can click on the model and just
 

3527
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:43,270
now you can click on the model and just
run it already it's like super easy you

3528
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:43,280
run it already it's like super easy you
 

3529
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,990
run it already it's like super easy you
log in with GitHub um that's great and

3530
01:01:45,990 --> 01:01:46,000
log in with GitHub um that's great and
 

3531
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,390
log in with GitHub um that's great and
by running it on the website then you

3532
01:01:47,390 --> 01:01:47,400
by running it on the website then you
 

3533
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,069
by running it on the website then you
can automate with the API you can make a

3534
01:01:49,069 --> 01:01:49,079
can automate with the API you can make a
 

3535
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:50,950
can automate with the API you can make a
website that runs the model generate

3536
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:50,960
website that runs the model generate
 

3537
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,549
website that runs the model generate
images generate text generate vide

3538
01:01:52,549 --> 01:01:52,559

models do anything yeah it's very cool

3542
01:01:57,349 --> 01:01:57,359
models do anything yeah it's very cool
 

3543
01:01:57,359 --> 01:01:59,990

company nice and you're like growing

3544
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:00,000
company nice and you're like growing
 

3545
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,750
company nice and you're like growing
with them essentially they grew because

3546
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:01,760
with them essentially they grew because
 

3547
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,870
with them essentially they grew because
of you because it's like a big use case

3548
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:03,880
of you because it's like a big use case
 

3549
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:06,109
of you because it's like a big use case
yeah like the the website even looks

3550
01:02:06,109 --> 01:02:06,119
yeah like the the website even looks
 

3551
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:07,589
yeah like the the website even looks
weird now it it started as like a

3552
01:02:07,589 --> 01:02:07,599
weird now it it started as like a
 

3553
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,910
weird now it it started as like a
machine learning platform that was like

3554
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:09,920
machine learning platform that was like
 

3555
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,430
machine learning platform that was like
I didn't even understand what it did it

3556
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:11,440
I didn't even understand what it did it
 

3557
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,349
I didn't even understand what it did it
was just too to ml you know like you

3558
01:02:14,349 --> 01:02:14,359
was just too to ml you know like you
 

3559
01:02:14,359 --> 01:02:15,349
was just too to ml you know like you
would understand because you're in the

3560
01:02:15,349 --> 01:02:15,359
would understand because you're in the
 

3561
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:16,630
would understand because you're in the
ml world I wouldn't understand now it's

3562
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:16,640
ml world I wouldn't understand now it's
 

3563
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:19,470
ml world I wouldn't understand now it's
newb friendly yeah exactly and I didn't

3564
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:19,480
newb friendly yeah exactly and I didn't
 

3565
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:21,470
newb friendly yeah exactly and I didn't
know how it worked and um but I knew

3566
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:21,480
know how it worked and um but I knew
 

3567
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,109
know how it worked and um but I knew
that they could probably do this and

3568
01:02:23,109 --> 01:02:23,119
that they could probably do this and
 

3569
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:24,510
that they could probably do this and
they did it they built the models and

3570
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:24,520
they did it they built the models and
 

3571
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:26,789
they did it they built the models and
now I use them for everything and we

3572
01:02:26,789 --> 01:02:26,799
now I use them for everything and we
 

3573
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:30,069
now I use them for everything and we
trained like I think now like 36,000

3574
01:02:30,069 --> 01:02:30,079
trained like I think now like 36,000
 

3575
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,710
trained like I think now like 36,000
models 36,000 people already but is

3577
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:34,549
models 36,000 people already but is
there some tricks to fine tuning to like

01:02:59,750 --> 01:02:59,760
um yeah they generate photos of
 

3603
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:00,589
um yeah they generate photos of
themselves and then they say ah it

3604
01:03:00,589 --> 01:03:00,599
themselves and then they say ah it
 

3605
01:03:00,599 --> 01:03:04,630
themselves and then they say ah it
doesn't look like me yeah but it then

3606
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:04,640
doesn't look like me yeah but it then
 

3607
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:05,470
doesn't look like me yeah but it then
you know you can check the training

3608
01:03:05,470 --> 01:03:05,480
you know you can check the training
 

3609
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:06,950

this is dark aspect of psychology we
 

3667
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:06,710
this is dark aspect of psychology we
focus on some small flaws yeah this why

3668

focus on some small flaws yeah this why
 

3669
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,589
focus on some small flaws yeah this why
I hate plastic surgery for example

understanding what makes you beautiful

3700
01:04:36,190 --> 01:04:36,200
understanding what makes you beautiful
 

3701
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:37,789
understanding what makes you beautiful
it's the breaking of symmetry makes you

3702
01:04:37,789 --> 01:04:37,799
it's the breaking of symmetry makes you
 

3703
01:04:37,799 --> 01:04:40,150
it's the breaking of symmetry makes you
beautiful it's the breaking of the the

3704
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:40,160
beautiful it's the breaking of the the
 

3705
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,430
beautiful it's the breaking of the the
average face makes you beautiful all

3706
01:04:42,430 --> 01:04:42,440
average face makes you beautiful all
 

3707
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:44,870
average face makes you beautiful all
that yeah and obviously different for

3708
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:44,880
that yeah and obviously different for
 

3709
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,390
that yeah and obviously different for
men and women at different ages all this

3710
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:46,400
men and women at different ages all this
 

3711
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,829
men and women at different ages all this
kind of stuff but be Underneath It All

3712
01:04:48,829 --> 01:04:48,839
kind of stuff but be Underneath It All
 

3713
01:04:48,839 --> 01:04:50,829
kind of stuff but be Underneath It All
the personality all of that when when

3714
01:04:50,829 --> 01:04:50,839
the personality all of that when when
 

3715
01:04:50,839 --> 01:04:51,950
the personality all of that when when
the

3716
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:51,960
the
 

3717
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:55,069
the
face comes alive that also is the thing

3718
01:04:55,069 --> 01:04:55,079
face comes alive that also is the thing
 

3719
01:04:55,079 --> 01:04:56,829
face comes alive that also is the thing
that makes you Beau beautiful but anyway

3720
01:04:56,829 --> 01:04:56,839
that makes you Beau beautiful but anyway
 

3721
01:04:56,839 --> 01:04:58,750
that makes you Beau beautiful but anyway
you have to figure all that out with AI

3722
01:04:58,750 --> 01:04:58,760
you have to figure all that out with AI
 

3723
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,990
you have to figure all that out with AI
yeah one thing that worked was like um

3724
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:01,000
yeah one thing that worked was like um
 

3725
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,190
yeah one thing that worked was like um
people would upload full body photos of

3726
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:03,200
people would upload full body photos of
 

3727
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,269
people would upload full body photos of
themselves so I would crop the face

3728
01:05:05,269 --> 01:05:05,279
themselves so I would crop the face
 

3729
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,789
themselves so I would crop the face
right because and then the model knew

3730
01:05:06,789 --> 01:05:06,799
right because and then the model knew
 

3731
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:08,109
right because and then the model knew
better that we're training mostly the

3732
01:05:08,109 --> 01:05:08,119
better that we're training mostly the
 

3733
01:05:08,119 --> 01:05:10,549
better that we're training mostly the
face here but then I started losing uh

3734
01:05:10,549 --> 01:05:10,559
face here but then I started losing uh
 

3735
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:11,829
face here but then I started losing uh
resemblance of the body because some

3736
01:05:11,829 --> 01:05:11,839
resemblance of the body because some
 

3737
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:13,430
resemblance of the body because some
people are skinny some people are

3738
01:05:13,430 --> 01:05:13,440
people are skinny some people are
 

3739
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:14,789
people are skinny some people are
muscular whatever so you want to have

3740
01:05:14,789 --> 01:05:14,799
muscular whatever so you want to have
 

3741
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:17,029
muscular whatever so you want to have
that too uh so now I mix full body

3742
01:05:17,029 --> 01:05:17,039
that too uh so now I mix full body
 

3743
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:18,950
that too uh so now I mix full body
photos in the training with face photos

3744
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:18,960
photos in the training with face photos
 

3745
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:21,190
photos in the training with face photos
face crops uh and it's all automatic

3746
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:21,200
face crops uh and it's all automatic
 

3747
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,549
face crops uh and it's all automatic
like um and I know that other people

3748
01:05:23,549 --> 01:05:23,559
like um and I know that other people
 

3749
01:05:23,559 --> 01:05:26,269
like um and I know that other people
they they use again AI mod to detect

3750
01:05:26,269 --> 01:05:26,279
they they use again AI mod to detect
 

3751
01:05:26,279 --> 01:05:27,990
they they use again AI mod to detect
like what are the best photos in this

3752
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:28,000
like what are the best photos in this
 

3753
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,990
like what are the best photos in this
training set and then train on those but

3754
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:30,000
training set and then train on those but
 

3755
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,670
training set and then train on those but
it's all it's all about training data

3756
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:31,680
it's all it's all about training data
 

3757
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,990
it's all it's all about training data
and that's with everything in AI like

3758
01:05:33,990 --> 01:05:34,000
and that's with everything in AI like
 

3759
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,190
and that's with everything in AI like
how good your training data is is in

3760
01:05:36,190 --> 01:05:36,200
how good your training data is is in
 

3761
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:38,190
how good your training data is is in
many ways more important than how many

3762
01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:38,200
many ways more important than how many
 

3763
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,109
many ways more important than how many
steps you train for like how many months

3764
01:05:40,109 --> 01:05:40,119
steps you train for like how many months
 

3765
01:05:40,119 --> 01:05:43,029
steps you train for like how many months
or whatever with these gpus like um the

3766
01:05:43,029 --> 01:05:43,039
or whatever with these gpus like um the
 

3767
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:44,630
or whatever with these gpus like um the
golds do you have any guidelines for

3768
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:44,640
golds do you have any guidelines for
 

3769
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,670
golds do you have any guidelines for
people of like how to get good data how

3770
01:05:46,670 --> 01:05:46,680
people of like how to get good data how
 

3771
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,670
people of like how to get good data how
to give good data to find tune on like

3772
01:05:48,670 --> 01:05:48,680
to give good data to find tune on like
 

3773
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:51,109
to give good data to find tune on like
the photos should be diverse so for

3774
01:05:51,109 --> 01:05:51,119
the photos should be diverse so for
 

3775
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:53,430
the photos should be diverse so for
example if I only upload photos with a

3776
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:53,440
example if I only upload photos with a
 

3777
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,069
example if I only upload photos with a
brown shirt or green shirt the mulle

3778
01:05:56,069 --> 01:05:56,079
brown shirt or green shirt the mulle
 

3779
01:05:56,079 --> 01:05:58,670
brown shirt or green shirt the mulle
think that I'm training the green shirt

3780
01:05:58,670 --> 01:05:58,680
think that I'm training the green shirt
 

3781
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:00,670
think that I'm training the green shirt
so the things that are the same every

3782
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:00,680
so the things that are the same every
 

3783
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:03,230
so the things that are the same every
photo are the concepts that are trained

3784
01:06:03,230 --> 01:06:03,240
photo are the concepts that are trained
 

3785
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:05,470
photo are the concepts that are trained
what you want is your face to be the

3786
01:06:05,470 --> 01:06:05,480
what you want is your face to be the
 

3787
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:08,029
what you want is your face to be the
concept that's strains um and everything

3788
01:06:08,029 --> 01:06:08,039
concept that's strains um and everything
 

3789
01:06:08,039 --> 01:06:10,230
concept that's strains um and everything
else to be diverse like different so

3790
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:10,240
else to be diverse like different so
 

3791
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,150
else to be diverse like different so
diverse lighting as well diverse yeah

3792
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:12,160
diverse lighting as well diverse yeah
 

3793
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:14,829
diverse lighting as well diverse yeah
Outside Inside uh but there's no like

3794
01:06:14,829 --> 01:06:14,839
Outside Inside uh but there's no like
 

3795
01:06:14,839 --> 01:06:15,990
Outside Inside uh but there's no like
this is the problem there's no like

3796
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:16,000
this is the problem there's no like
 

3797
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,430
this is the problem there's no like
manual for this and nobody knew we were

3798
01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:18,440
manual for this and nobody knew we were
 

3799
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:19,910
manual for this and nobody knew we were
all just especially two years ago we're

3800
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:19,920
all just especially two years ago we're
 

3801
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,230
all just especially two years ago we're
all hacking trying to test anything

3802
01:06:22,230 --> 01:06:22,240
all hacking trying to test anything
 

3803
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:25,589
all hacking trying to test anything
anything you can think of and uh it's

3804
01:06:25,589 --> 01:06:25,599
anything you can think of and uh it's
 

3805
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:26,910
anything you can think of and uh it's
frustrating it's one of the most

3806
01:06:26,910 --> 01:06:26,920
frustrating it's one of the most
 

3807
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:28,630
frustrating it's one of the most
frustrating and also fun and challenging

3808
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:28,640
frustrating and also fun and challenging
 

3809
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:31,950
frustrating and also fun and challenging
things to do because with AI CU it's a

3810
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:31,960
things to do because with AI CU it's a
 

3811
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:34,309
things to do because with AI CU it's a
black box and like carpati I think says

3812
01:06:34,309 --> 01:06:34,319
black box and like carpati I think says
 

3813
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:36,430
black box and like carpati I think says
this like uh we don't really know how

3814
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:36,440
this like uh we don't really know how
 

3815
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:39,150
this like uh we don't really know how
this thing works but it does something

3816
01:06:39,150 --> 01:06:39,160
this thing works but it does something
 

3817
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:41,150
this thing works but it does something
but nobody really knows why right like

3818
01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:41,160
but nobody really knows why right like
 

3819
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:43,670
but nobody really knows why right like
we cannot look into the the model of an

3820
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:43,680
we cannot look into the the model of an
 

3821
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,470
we cannot look into the the model of an
llm like what is actually in there we

3822
01:06:45,470 --> 01:06:45,480
llm like what is actually in there we
 

3823
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:47,390
llm like what is actually in there we
just know it's like a 3D Matrix of

3824
01:06:47,390 --> 01:06:47,400
just know it's like a 3D Matrix of
 

3825
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:51,990
just know it's like a 3D Matrix of
numbers right um so it's very

3826
01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:52,000
numbers right um so it's very
 

3827
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,630
numbers right um so it's very
frustrating CU some things you that

3828
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:53,640
frustrating CU some things you that
 

3829
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,069
frustrating CU some things you that
would be you think they're obvious that

3830
01:06:55,069 --> 01:06:55,079
would be you think they're obvious that
 

3831
01:06:55,079 --> 01:06:57,190
would be you think they're obvious that
they will improve things will make them

3832
01:06:57,190 --> 01:06:57,200
they will improve things will make them
 

3833
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,910
they will improve things will make them
worse and there's so many parameters you

3834
01:06:58,910 --> 01:06:58,920
worse and there's so many parameters you
 

3835
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:01,589
worse and there's so many parameters you
can tweak so you're testing everything

3836
01:07:01,589 --> 01:07:01,599
can tweak so you're testing everything
 

3837
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:04,349
can tweak so you're testing everything
to you know improve things I mean

to you know improve things I mean
 

3839
01:07:04,359 --> 01:07:06,349
to you know improve things I mean
there's a whole field now of mechanistic

3840
01:07:06,349 --> 01:07:06,359
there's a whole field now of mechanistic
 

3841
01:07:06,359 --> 01:07:08,390
there's a whole field now of mechanistic
interpretability that like studies that

3842
01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:08,400
interpretability that like studies that
 

3843
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,349
interpretability that like studies that
tries to figure out tries to break thing

3844

tries to figure out tries to break thing
 

3845
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:12,829
tries to figure out tries to break thing
apart and understand how it works but

3846
01:07:12,829 --> 01:07:12,839
apart and understand how it works but
 

3847
01:07:12,839 --> 01:07:15,029
apart and understand how it works but
you know there's also the data side and

the the actual like consumer facing
 

3851

the the actual like consumer facing
product side of figuring out how do you

3852
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:19,920
product side of figuring out how do you
 

3853
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,069
product side of figuring out how do you
get it to generate a thing that's

3854

4015
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,110
the content is good enough it's it and
it will probably be original because you

4016
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:27,120
it will probably be original because you
 

4017
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,510
it will probably be original because you
would be using an iPhone for it you know

4018
01:10:29,510 --> 01:10:29,520
would be using an iPhone for it you know
 

4019
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,910
would be using an iPhone for it you know
so that said I so the reason I brought

4020
01:10:31,910 --> 01:10:31,920
so that said I so the reason I brought
 

4021
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,830
so that said I so the reason I brought
that up with

4022
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:33,840
that up with
 

4023
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:36,189
that up with
photography there is wisdom from people

4024
01:10:36,189 --> 01:10:36,199
photography there is wisdom from people
 

4025
01:10:36,199 --> 01:10:38,390
photography there is wisdom from people
and one of one of the things I realized

4026
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:38,400
and one of one of the things I realized
 

4027
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:42,070
and one of one of the things I realized
you probably also realized this but how

4028
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:42,080
you probably also realized this but how
 

4029
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,669
you probably also realized this but how
much power light

4030
01:10:43,669 --> 01:10:43,679
much power light
 

4031
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:47,470
much power light
has to uh to convey emotion you just

4032
01:10:47,470 --> 01:10:47,480
has to uh to convey emotion you just
 

4033
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:49,709
has to uh to convey emotion you just
take one light and move it around say

4034
01:10:49,709 --> 01:10:49,719
take one light and move it around say
 

4035
01:10:49,719 --> 01:10:50,950
take one light and move it around say
you're sitting in the darkness mooving

4036
01:10:50,950 --> 01:10:50,960
you're sitting in the darkness mooving
 

4037
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,510
you're sitting in the darkness mooving
around your face the different positions

4038
01:10:53,510 --> 01:10:53,520
around your face the different positions
 

4039
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,510
around your face the different positions
are having a second light potentially

4040
01:10:55,510 --> 01:10:55,520
are having a second light potentially
 

4041
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:57,270
are having a second light potentially
you can play with how a person feels

4042
01:10:57,270 --> 01:10:57,280
you can play with how a person feels
 

4043
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,350
you can play with how a person feels
just from a generic face it's

4044
01:10:59,350 --> 01:10:59,360
just from a generic face it's
 

4045
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:00,910
just from a generic face it's
interesting like you can make people

4046
01:11:00,910 --> 01:11:00,920
interesting like you can make people
 

4047
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:02,470
interesting like you can make people
attractive you can make them ugly you

4048
01:11:02,470 --> 01:11:02,480
attractive you can make them ugly you
 

4049
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,430
attractive you can make them ugly you
can make them scary you can make them

4050
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:04,440
can make them scary you can make them
 

4051
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:07,830
can make them scary you can make them
lonely all of this and so you kind of

4052
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:07,840
lonely all of this and so you kind of
 

4053
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,990
lonely all of this and so you kind of
real start to realize this and uh I

4054
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:10,000
real start to realize this and uh I
 

4055
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,750
real start to realize this and uh I
would definitely love AI help in uh

4056
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:12,760
would definitely love AI help in uh
 

4057
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:16,510
would definitely love AI help in uh
creating great portraits of people guest

4058
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:16,520
creating great portraits of people guest
 

4059
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:18,229
creating great portraits of people guest
photos yeah guest photos for example

4060
01:11:18,229 --> 01:11:18,239
photos yeah guest photos for example
 

4061
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:20,550
photos yeah guest photos for example
that's a small use case but for me

4062
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:20,560
that's a small use case but for me
 

4063
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,070
that's a small use case but for me
that's

4064
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:22,080
that's
 

4065
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:24,870
that's
a I suppose it's an important use case

4066
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:24,880
a I suppose it's an important use case
 

4067
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,669
a I suppose it's an important use case
because like I want people to look good

4068
01:11:26,669 --> 01:11:26,679
because like I want people to look good
 

4069
01:11:26,679 --> 01:11:30,669
because like I want people to look good
but I also want to capture who they are

4070
01:11:30,669 --> 01:11:30,679
but I also want to capture who they are
 

4071
01:11:30,679 --> 01:11:32,510
but I also want to capture who they are
maybe my conception of who they are what

4072
01:11:32,510 --> 01:11:32,520
maybe my conception of who they are what
 

4073
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,830
maybe my conception of who they are what
makes them beautiful what makes their

4074
01:11:34,830 --> 01:11:34,840
makes them beautiful what makes their
 

4075
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:36,750
makes them beautiful what makes their
appearance powerful in some ways

4076
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:36,760
appearance powerful in some ways
 

4077
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:38,270
appearance powerful in some ways
sometimes it's the eyes often times it's

4078
01:11:38,270 --> 01:11:38,280
sometimes it's the eyes often times it's
 

4079
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:40,189
sometimes it's the eyes often times it's
the eyes but there's certain features of

4080
01:11:40,189 --> 01:11:40,199
the eyes but there's certain features of
 

4081
01:11:40,199 --> 01:11:41,470
the eyes but there's certain features of
the face can sometimes be really

4082
01:11:41,470 --> 01:11:41,480
the face can sometimes be really
 

4083
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:44,310
the face can sometimes be really
powerful and I can't it's it's also kind

4084
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:44,320
powerful and I can't it's it's also kind
 

4085
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,229
powerful and I can't it's it's also kind
of awkward for me to take yeah yeah yeah

4086
01:11:46,229 --> 01:11:46,239
of awkward for me to take yeah yeah yeah
 

4087
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:49,430
of awkward for me to take yeah yeah yeah
photographs so I'm not collecting enough

4088
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:49,440
photographs so I'm not collecting enough
 

4089
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:52,590
photographs so I'm not collecting enough
yeah photographs for myself to do it um

4090
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:52,600
yeah photographs for myself to do it um
 

4091
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,550
yeah photographs for myself to do it um
with just those photographs if I can

4092
01:11:54,550 --> 01:11:54,560
with just those photographs if I can
 

4093
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,870
with just those photographs if I can
load that off fun to Ai and then start

4094
01:11:56,870 --> 01:11:56,880
load that off fun to Ai and then start
 

4095
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,750
load that off fun to Ai and then start
to play with like lighting you should do

4096
01:11:59,750 --> 01:11:59,760
to play with like lighting you should do
 

4097
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:00,669
to play with like lighting you should do
this and you should probably do it

4098
01:12:00,669 --> 01:12:00,679
this and you should probably do it
 

4099
01:12:00,679 --> 01:12:02,189
this and you should probably do it
yourself like you can get use photo but

4100
01:12:02,189 --> 01:12:02,199
yourself like you can get use photo but
 

4101
01:12:02,199 --> 01:12:03,950
yourself like you can get use photo but
it's even more fun if you do it yourself

4102
01:12:03,950 --> 01:12:03,960
it's even more fun if you do it yourself
 

4103
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:06,110
it's even more fun if you do it yourself
so you train the models you can learn

4104
01:12:06,110 --> 01:12:06,120
so you train the models you can learn
 

4105
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:07,830
so you train the models you can learn
about like control net control net is

4106
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:07,840
about like control net control net is
 

4107
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,310
about like control net control net is
where for example your photos and your

4108
01:12:09,310 --> 01:12:09,320
where for example your photos and your
 

4109
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:10,790
where for example your photos and your
podcast are usually like from the angle

4110
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:10,800
podcast are usually like from the angle
 

4111
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,629
podcast are usually like from the angle
right so you can create a control net

4112
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:13,639
right so you can create a control net
 

4113
01:12:13,639 --> 01:12:15,750
right so you can create a control net
face posst that's always like this so

4114
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:15,760
face posst that's always like this so
 

4115
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,430
face posst that's always like this so
every model every photo you generate

4116
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:17,440
every model every photo you generate
 

4117
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:19,629
every model every photo you generate
uses this control net uh pose for

4118
01:12:19,629 --> 01:12:19,639
uses this control net uh pose for
 

4119
01:12:19,639 --> 01:12:21,550
uses this control net uh pose for
example I think it would be very fun for

4120
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:21,560
example I think it would be very fun for
 

4121
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,030
example I think it would be very fun for
you to try out that stuff do you play

4122
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:23,040
you to try out that stuff do you play
 

4123
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,550
you to try out that stuff do you play
with lighting at all do you play with

4124
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:24,560
with lighting at all do you play with
 

4125
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,629
with lighting at all do you play with
lighting with with man actually this

4126
01:12:26,629 --> 01:12:26,639
lighting with with man actually this
 

4127
01:12:26,639 --> 01:12:28,470
lighting with with man actually this
like this week or recently there's a new

4128
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:28,480
like this week or recently there's a new
 

4129
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,910
like this week or recently there's a new
model came out that can adjust the light

4130
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:30,920
model came out that can adjust the light
 

4131
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:33,950
model came out that can adjust the light
of any photo but also AI image uh with

4132
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:33,960
of any photo but also AI image uh with
 

4133
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:36,270
of any photo but also AI image uh with
stable diffusion uh I think it's called

4134
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:36,280
stable diffusion uh I think it's called
 

4135
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:40,229
stable diffusion uh I think it's called
relight and it's amazing like you can

4136
01:12:40,229 --> 01:12:40,239
relight and it's amazing like you can
 

4137
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:43,350
relight and it's amazing like you can
you can upload kind of like a a light

4138
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:43,360
you can upload kind of like a a light
 

4139
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:46,229
you can upload kind of like a a light
map so for example red purple blue and

4140
01:12:46,229 --> 01:12:46,239
map so for example red purple blue and
 

4141
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:48,470
map so for example red purple blue and
it uses that light map to change the

4142
01:12:48,470 --> 01:12:48,480
it uses that light map to change the
 

4143
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,550
it uses that light map to change the
light on the photo to you you input it's

4144
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:50,560
light on the photo to you you input it's
 

4145
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,550
light on the photo to you you input it's
amazing so there's for sure a lot of

4232
01:14:31,910 --> 01:14:31,920
if you want to start go on X and then I
 

4233
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,550
if you want to start go on X and then I
would go to replicate and start trying

4234
01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:33,560
would go to replicate and start trying
 

4235
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:35,430
would go to replicate and start trying
to play with models and when you have

4236
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:35,440
to play with models and when you have
 

4237
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,350
to play with models and when you have
something that kind of you you manually

4238
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:37,360
something that kind of you you manually
 

4239
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:39,270
something that kind of you you manually
enter stuff you set the parameters

4240
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:39,280
enter stuff you set the parameters
 

4241
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,030
enter stuff you set the parameters
something that works you you can make an

4242
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:41,040
something that works you you can make an
 

4243
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,470
something that works you you can make an
app out of it or website can you speak a

4244
01:14:43,470 --> 01:14:43,480
app out of it or website can you speak a
 

4245
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:45,830
app out of it or website can you speak a
little bit more to the process of it

4246
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:45,840
little bit more to the process of it
 

4247
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,110
little bit more to the process of it
becoming better and better and better

4248
01:14:47,110 --> 01:14:47,120
becoming better and better and better
 

4249
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,070

photo yeah so I had this photo and a lot

4250
01:14:49,070 --> 01:14:49,080
photo yeah so I had this photo and a lot
 

4251
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:50,390
photo yeah so I had this photo and a lot
of people using it there was like a

4252
01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:50,400
of people using it there was like a
 

4253
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,590
of people using it there was like a
million or more photos a month being

4254
01:14:52,590 --> 01:14:52,600
million or more photos a month being
 

4255
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:56,590
million or more photos a month being
generated and I discovered I was testing

4256
01:14:56,590 --> 01:14:56,600
generated and I discovered I was testing
 

4257
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,830
generated and I discovered I was testing
parameters like increase the step count

4258
01:14:58,830 --> 01:14:58,840
parameters like increase the step count
 

4259
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:00,470
parameters like increase the step count
of generating a photo or changing the

4260
01:15:00,470 --> 01:15:00,480
of generating a photo or changing the
 

4261
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:02,510
of generating a photo or changing the
sampler like a scheduler like you have

4262
01:15:02,510 --> 01:15:02,520
sampler like a scheduler like you have
 

4263
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:04,790
sampler like a scheduler like you have
DPM two caras all these things I don't

4264
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:04,800
DPM two caras all these things I don't
 

4265
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,070
DPM two caras all these things I don't
know anything about but I know that you

4266
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:06,080
know anything about but I know that you
 

4267
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,629
know anything about but I know that you
can choose them when you generate image

4268
01:15:07,629 --> 01:15:07,639
can choose them when you generate image
 

4269
01:15:07,639 --> 01:15:09,510
can choose them when you generate image
and they have different resulting images

4270
01:15:09,510 --> 01:15:09,520
and they have different resulting images
 

4271
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:11,030
and they have different resulting images
but I didn't know which one was were

4272
01:15:11,030 --> 01:15:11,040
but I didn't know which one was were
 

4273
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,990
but I didn't know which one was were
better so I would do it myself test it

4274
01:15:12,990 --> 01:15:13,000
better so I would do it myself test it
 

4275
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,390
better so I would do it myself test it
but then I was like why don't I test on

4276
01:15:14,390 --> 01:15:14,400
but then I was like why don't I test on
 

4277
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,229
but then I was like why don't I test on
these users because I have a million

4278
01:15:16,229 --> 01:15:16,239
these users because I have a million
 

4279
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:18,830
these users because I have a million
photos generated anyway so un like 10%

4280
01:15:18,830 --> 01:15:18,840
photos generated anyway so un like 10%
 

4281
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:21,709
photos generated anyway so un like 10%
of the users I would um randomly test

4282
01:15:21,709 --> 01:15:21,719
of the users I would um randomly test
 

4283
01:15:21,719 --> 01:15:23,870
of the users I would um randomly test
parameters and then I would see if they

4284
01:15:23,870 --> 01:15:23,880
parameters and then I would see if they
 

4285
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:25,470
parameters and then I would see if they
would because you can favor it photo or

4286
01:15:25,470 --> 01:15:25,480
would because you can favor it photo or
 

4287
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:27,310
would because you can favor it photo or
you can download it I would measure if

4288
01:15:27,310 --> 01:15:27,320
you can download it I would measure if
 

4289
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:30,030
you can download it I would measure if
they favored or like the photo and then

4290
01:15:30,030 --> 01:15:30,040
they favored or like the photo and then
 

4291
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:32,390
they favored or like the photo and then
I would AB test and you test for

4292
01:15:32,390 --> 01:15:32,400
I would AB test and you test for
 

4293
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,870
I would AB test and you test for
significance and stuff uh which

4294
01:15:34,870 --> 01:15:34,880
significance and stuff uh which
 

4295
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:37,110
significance and stuff uh which
parameters were were better and which

4296
01:15:37,110 --> 01:15:37,120
parameters were were better and which
 

4297
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:38,990
parameters were were better and which
were worse so you're starting to figure

4298
01:15:38,990 --> 01:15:39,000
were worse so you're starting to figure
 

4299
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,350
were worse so you're starting to figure
out which Which models are actually

4300
01:15:40,350 --> 01:15:40,360
out which Which models are actually
 

4301
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:41,390
out which Which models are actually
working well and then if it's

4302
01:15:41,390 --> 01:15:41,400
working well and then if it's
 

4303
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:42,830
working well and then if it's
significant enough data you switch to

4304
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:42,840
significant enough data you switch to
 

4305
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:44,510
significant enough data you switch to
that for the whole you know all the

4306
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:44,520
that for the whole you know all the
 

4307
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:46,350
that for the whole you know all the
users and so that was that was like the

4308
01:15:46,350 --> 01:15:46,360
users and so that was that was like the
 

4309
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:47,830
users and so that was that was like the
Breakthrough to make it better just use

4310
01:15:47,830 --> 01:15:47,840
Breakthrough to make it better just use
 

4311
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,149
Breakthrough to make it better just use
the users to improve it themselves and I

4312
01:15:50,149 --> 01:15:50,159
the users to improve it themselves and I
 

4313
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:51,350
the users to improve it themselves and I
tell them when they sign up we do

4314
01:15:51,350 --> 01:15:51,360
tell them when they sign up we do
 

4315
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,270
tell them when they sign up we do
sampling we do testing on your photos

4316
01:15:53,270 --> 01:15:53,280
sampling we do testing on your photos
 

4317
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:55,030
sampling we do testing on your photos
with random parameters and that work

4318
01:15:55,030 --> 01:15:55,040
with random parameters and that work
 

4319
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:56,390
with random parameters and that work
really well I don't do a lot of testing

4320
01:15:56,390 --> 01:15:56,400
really well I don't do a lot of testing
 

4321
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,590
really well I don't do a lot of testing
anymore because it's like I kind of

4322
01:15:57,590 --> 01:15:57,600
anymore because it's like I kind of
 

4323
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:58,910
anymore because it's like I kind of
reached like a diminishing point where

4324
01:15:58,910 --> 01:15:58,920
reached like a diminishing point where
 

4325
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:01,709
reached like a diminishing point where
it's like it's kind of good um but

4326
01:16:01,709 --> 01:16:01,719
it's like it's kind of good um but
 

4327
01:16:01,719 --> 01:16:03,229
it's like it's kind of good um but
that's there was a breakthrough yeah so

4328
01:16:03,229 --> 01:16:03,239
that's there was a breakthrough yeah so
 

4329
01:16:03,239 --> 01:16:04,629
that's there was a breakthrough yeah so
it's really about the parameters and

4330
01:16:04,629 --> 01:16:04,639
it's really about the parameters and
 

4331
01:16:04,639 --> 01:16:06,830
it's really about the parameters and
models that CH and letting the

4332
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:06,840
models that CH and letting the
 

4333
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:10,350
models that CH and letting the
users help do the search in the space of

4334
01:16:10,350 --> 01:16:10,360
users help do the search in the space of
 

4335
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:13,229
users help do the search in the space of
models and parameters for you yeah but

4336
01:16:13,229 --> 01:16:13,239
models and parameters for you yeah but
 

4337
01:16:13,239 --> 01:16:15,470
models and parameters for you yeah but
actually so like stable diff Fusion I

4338
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:15,480
actually so like stable diff Fusion I
 

4339
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:18,669
actually so like stable diff Fusion I
used 1.5 two 2.0 came out as stab Fusion

4340
01:16:18,669 --> 01:16:18,679
used 1.5 two 2.0 came out as stab Fusion
 

4341
01:16:18,679 --> 01:16:20,550
used 1.5 two 2.0 came out as stab Fusion
XL came out all these new versions and

4342
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:20,560
XL came out all these new versions and
 

4343
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,950
XL came out all these new versions and
they were all worse and so the core

4344
01:16:22,950 --> 01:16:22,960
they were all worse and so the core
 

4345
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:24,950
they were all worse and so the core
scene of people are still using 1.5

4346
01:16:24,950 --> 01:16:24,960
scene of people are still using 1.5
 

4347
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:26,709
scene of people are still using 1.5
because it's like it's also not like

4348
01:16:26,709 --> 01:16:26,719
because it's like it's also not like
 

4349
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:28,149
because it's like it's also not like
what do you call neutered like they they

4350
01:16:28,149 --> 01:16:28,159
what do you call neutered like they they
 

4351
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:30,709
what do you call neutered like they they
neutered like to make it super like with

4352
01:16:30,709 --> 01:16:30,719
neutered like to make it super like with
 

4353
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:33,830
neutered like to make it super like with
safety features and stuff so most of the

4354
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:33,840
safety features and stuff so most of the
 

4355
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:36,229
safety features and stuff so most of the
people are still on stable diffusion 1.5

4356
01:16:36,229 --> 01:16:36,239
people are still on stable diffusion 1.5
 

4357
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:38,390
people are still on stable diffusion 1.5
and meanwhile stable diffusion the

4358
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:38,400
and meanwhile stable diffusion the
 

4359
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:42,229
and meanwhile stable diffusion the
company went like the CEO left um a lot

4360
01:16:42,229 --> 01:16:42,239
company went like the CEO left um a lot
 

4361
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:44,590
company went like the CEO left um a lot
of drama happened because they couldn't

4362
01:16:44,590 --> 01:16:44,600
of drama happened because they couldn't
 

4363
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,390
of drama happened because they couldn't
make money and yeah so they gave us it's

4364
01:16:47,390 --> 01:16:47,400
make money and yeah so they gave us it's
 

4365
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:49,550
make money and yeah so they gave us it's
very interesting they gave us this this

4366
01:16:49,550 --> 01:16:49,560
very interesting they gave us this this
 

4367
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:51,709
very interesting they gave us this this
open source model that everybody uses

4368
01:16:51,709 --> 01:16:51,719
open source model that everybody uses
 

4369
01:16:51,719 --> 01:16:53,430
open source model that everybody uses
they raised like hundreds of millions of

4370
01:16:53,430 --> 01:16:53,440
they raised like hundreds of millions of
 

4371
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,390
they raised like hundreds of millions of
dollars it all they didn't make any

4372
01:16:55,390 --> 01:16:55,400
dollars it all they didn't make any
 

4373
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:57,270
dollars it all they didn't make any
money with it or not a lot they did an

4374
01:16:57,270 --> 01:16:57,280
money with it or not a lot they did an
 

4375
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,629
money with it or not a lot they did an
amazing job and now everybody use this

4376
01:16:58,629 --> 01:16:58,639
amazing job and now everybody use this
 

4377
01:16:58,639 --> 01:17:01,350
amazing job and now everybody use this
open source model for free and they did

4378
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:01,360
open source model for free and they did
 

4379
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:03,830
open source model for free and they did
you know it's amazing like it's a it's

4380
01:17:03,830 --> 01:17:03,840
you know it's amazing like it's a it's
 

4381
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,550
you know it's amazing like it's a it's
amazing you're not even using the latest

4382
01:17:05,550 --> 01:17:05,560
amazing you're not even using the latest
 

4383
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:07,070
amazing you're not even using the latest
one you're say no and the strange thing

4384
01:17:07,070 --> 01:17:07,080
one you're say no and the strange thing
 

4385
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:08,229
one you're say no and the strange thing
is that this company raised hundreds of

4386
01:17:08,229 --> 01:17:08,239
is that this company raised hundreds of
 

4387
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:09,189
is that this company raised hundreds of
millions but the people that are

4388
01:17:09,189 --> 01:17:09,199
millions but the people that are
 

4389
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:11,189
millions but the people that are
benefiting from it are really small like

4390
01:17:11,189 --> 01:17:11,199
benefiting from it are really small like
 

4391
01:17:11,199 --> 01:17:13,229
benefiting from it are really small like
people like me who make these small apps

4392
01:17:13,229 --> 01:17:13,239
people like me who make these small apps
 

4393
01:17:13,239 --> 01:17:15,110
people like me who make these small apps
that are using the model and and now

4394
01:17:15,110 --> 01:17:15,120
that are using the model and and now
 

4395
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:16,350
that are using the model and and now
they're starting to charge money for the

4396
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:16,360
they're starting to charge money for the
 

4397
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:17,830
they're starting to charge money for the
new models but the new models are not so

4398
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:17,840
new models but the new models are not so
 

4399
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,510
new models but the new models are not so
good for people do not sell open source

4400
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:20,520
good for people do not sell open source
 

4401
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:23,030
good for people do not sell open source
right yeah it's interesting because open

4402
01:17:23,030 --> 01:17:23,040
right yeah it's interesting because open
 

4403
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:26,550
right yeah it's interesting because open
source is so impact in the AI space but

4404
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:26,560
source is so impact in the AI space but
 

4405
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:27,870
source is so impact in the AI space but
you wonder like what is the business

4406
01:17:27,870 --> 01:17:27,880
you wonder like what is the business
 

4407
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:29,709
you wonder like what is the business
model behind that but it's enabling this

4408
01:17:29,709 --> 01:17:29,719
model behind that but it's enabling this
 

4409
01:17:29,719 --> 01:17:32,430
model behind that but it's enabling this
whole ecosystem of companies that yeah

4410
01:17:32,430 --> 01:17:32,440
whole ecosystem of companies that yeah
 

4411
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:33,950
whole ecosystem of companies that yeah
they're using open source models it's

4412
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:33,960
they're using open source models it's
 

4413
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:35,350
they're using open source models it's
kind of like those Frameworks but then

4414
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:35,360
kind of like those Frameworks but then
 

4415
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:37,510
kind of like those Frameworks but then
they didn't you know bribe enough

4416
01:17:37,510 --> 01:17:37,520
they didn't you know bribe enough
 

4417
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,070
they didn't you know bribe enough
influencers to use it um and they didn't

4418
01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:40,080
influencers to use it um and they didn't
 

4419
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:41,870
influencers to use it um and they didn't
charge money for the platform you know

4420
01:17:41,870 --> 01:17:41,880
charge money for the platform you know
 

4421
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:43,870
charge money for the platform you know
okay so back to your book and the

4422
01:17:43,870 --> 01:17:43,880
okay so back to your book and the
 

4423
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:46,830
okay so back to your book and the
ideas we didn't even get to the first

4424
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:46,840
ideas we didn't even get to the first
 

4425
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:50,350
ideas we didn't even get to the first
step uh generating ideas so you had the

4426
01:17:50,350 --> 01:17:50,360
step uh generating ideas so you had the
 

4427
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:52,790
step uh generating ideas so you had the
notebook and you're filling it up how do

4428
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:52,800
notebook and you're filling it up how do
 

4429
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,189
notebook and you're filling it up how do
you know when an idea is a good one like

4430
01:17:55,189 --> 01:17:55,199
you know when an idea is a good one like
 

4431
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:57,590
you know when an idea is a good one like
what you you have this just flood of

4432
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:57,600
what you you have this just flood of
 

4433
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,870
what you you have this just flood of
ideas how do you pick the one that you

4434
01:17:59,870 --> 01:17:59,880
ideas how do you pick the one that you
 

4435
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:02,030
ideas how do you pick the one that you
actually try to build man mostly you

4436
01:18:02,030 --> 01:18:02,040
actually try to build man mostly you
 

4437
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:03,629
actually try to build man mostly you
don't know like mostly I choose the ones

4438
01:18:03,629 --> 01:18:03,639
don't know like mostly I choose the ones
 

4439
01:18:03,639 --> 01:18:05,390
don't know like mostly I choose the ones
that are most viable for me to build

4440
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:05,400
that are most viable for me to build
 

4441
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:07,030
that are most viable for me to build
like I cannot build a space company now

4442
01:18:07,030 --> 01:18:07,040
like I cannot build a space company now
 

4443
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,990
like I cannot build a space company now
right would be quite challenging but I

4444
01:18:08,990 --> 01:18:09,000
right would be quite challenging but I
 

4445
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,510
right would be quite challenging but I
can build something actually write down

4446
01:18:10,510 --> 01:18:10,520
can build something actually write down
 

4447
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:12,950
can build something actually write down
like space company no I I think asteroid

4448
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:12,960
like space company no I I think asteroid
 

4449
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:14,830
like space company no I I think asteroid
mining would be very cool because like

4450
01:18:14,830 --> 01:18:14,840
mining would be very cool because like
 

4451
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:16,910
mining would be very cool because like
you you go to an asteroid you take some

4452
01:18:16,910 --> 01:18:16,920
you you go to an asteroid you take some
 

4453
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:18,110
you you go to an asteroid you take some
stuff from there you bring it back you

4454
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:18,120
stuff from there you bring it back you
 

4455
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:21,030
stuff from there you bring it back you
sell it you know it's but then you need

4456
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:21,040
sell it you know it's but then you need
 

4457
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:22,590
sell it you know it's but then you need
to do and you can hire someone to launch

4458
01:18:22,590 --> 01:18:22,600
to do and you can hire someone to launch
 

4459
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:24,149
to do and you can hire someone to launch
the thing so all you need is like the

4460
01:18:24,149 --> 01:18:24,159
the thing so all you need is like the
 

4461
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:26,550
the thing so all you need is like the
robot that goes to the asteroid you know

4462
01:18:26,550 --> 01:18:26,560
robot that goes to the asteroid you know
 

4463
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,350
robot that goes to the asteroid you know
and Robotics interesting like I want to

4464
01:18:28,350 --> 01:18:28,360
and Robotics interesting like I want to
 

4465
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:30,350
and Robotics interesting like I want to
also learn robotics so maybe that could

4466
01:18:30,350 --> 01:18:30,360
also learn robotics so maybe that could
 

4467
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:32,189
also learn robotics so maybe that could
be I think both the asteroid Mining and

4468
01:18:32,189 --> 01:18:32,199
be I think both the asteroid Mining and
 

4469
01:18:32,199 --> 01:18:37,350
be I think both the asteroid Mining and
the robotics is yeah

4470
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:37,360

 

4471
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:40,470

together I feel like no exactly this is

4472
01:18:40,470 --> 01:18:40,480
together I feel like no exactly this is
 

4473
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:43,750
together I feel like no exactly this is
it this is says we do this not because

4474
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:43,760
it this is says we do this not because
 

4475
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,149
it this is says we do this not because
it's easy but because we thought it

4476
01:18:45,149 --> 01:18:45,159
it's easy but because we thought it
 

4477
01:18:45,159 --> 01:18:47,149
it's easy but because we thought it
would be easy exactly that's me with

4478
01:18:47,149 --> 01:18:47,159
would be easy exactly that's me with
 

4479
01:18:47,159 --> 01:18:50,590
would be easy exactly that's me with
that's me with Aster mining exactly

4480
01:18:50,590 --> 01:18:50,600
that's me with Aster mining exactly
 

4481
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:51,990
that's me with Aster mining exactly
that's why I should do this it's not

4482
01:18:51,990 --> 01:18:52,000
that's why I should do this it's not
 

4483

01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:45,270
subconscious like stuff that you've been
thinking about for many years that's

4594
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:45,280
thinking about for many years that's
 

4595
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:47,590
thinking about for many years that's
really emerges I wrote it wrong because

4596
01:20:47,590 --> 01:20:47,600
really emerges I wrote it wrong because
 

4597
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,709
really emerges I wrote it wrong because
I don't know I'm not native English but

4598
01:20:49,709 --> 01:20:49,719
I don't know I'm not native English but
 

4599
01:20:49,719 --> 01:20:51,350
I don't know I'm not native English but
it emerges from your subconscious right

4600
01:20:51,350 --> 01:20:51,360
it emerges from your subconscious right
 

4601
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,830
it emerges from your subconscious right
it comes from the like a water here your

4602
01:20:53,830 --> 01:20:53,840
it comes from the like a water here your
 

4603
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:55,750
it comes from the like a water here your
subconscious in here it's boiling and

4604
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:55,760
subconscious in here it's boiling and
 

4605
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:58,070
subconscious in here it's boiling and
then when it's ready it's like ding it's

4606
01:20:58,070 --> 01:20:58,080
then when it's ready it's like ding it's
 

4607
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,030
then when it's ready it's like ding it's
like microwave comes out and there you

4608
01:21:00,030 --> 01:21:00,040
like microwave comes out and there you
 

4609
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:01,990
like microwave comes out and there you
have your idea you think you have ideas

4610
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:02,000
have your idea you think you have ideas
 

4611
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,189
have your idea you think you have ideas
like that yeah all the time 100% it's

4612
01:21:04,189 --> 01:21:04,199
like that yeah all the time 100% it's
 

4613
01:21:04,199 --> 01:21:06,430
like that yeah all the time 100% it's
just stuff that's been like there yes

4614
01:21:06,430 --> 01:21:06,440
just stuff that's been like there yes
 

4615
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:08,870
just stuff that's been like there yes
yeah and I also it comes up and I bring

4616
01:21:08,870 --> 01:21:08,880
yeah and I also it comes up and I bring
 

4617
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,870
yeah and I also it comes up and I bring
it I send it back you know like send it

4618
01:21:10,870 --> 01:21:10,880
it I send it back you know like send it
 

4619
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:13,310
it I send it back you know like send it
back to the kitchen boil more yeah and

4620
01:21:13,310 --> 01:21:13,320
back to the kitchen boil more yeah and
 

4621
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:15,629
back to the kitchen boil more yeah and
it's like a soup that of ideas that's

4622
01:21:15,629 --> 01:21:15,639
it's like a soup that of ideas that's
 

4623
01:21:15,639 --> 01:21:17,270
it's like a soup that of ideas that's
cooking it's 100% this is how my brain

4624
01:21:17,270 --> 01:21:17,280
cooking it's 100% this is how my brain
 

4625
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,110
cooking it's 100% this is how my brain
works and I think most people but it's

4626
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:19,120
works and I think most people but it's
 

4627
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:20,950
works and I think most people but it's
also about the the timing sometimes you

4628
01:21:20,950 --> 01:21:20,960
also about the the timing sometimes you
 

4629
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,229
also about the the timing sometimes you
have to send it back not just because

4630
01:21:22,229 --> 01:21:22,239
have to send it back not just because
 

4631
01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:23,709
have to send it back not just because
you're not ready but the world is not

4632
01:21:23,709 --> 01:21:23,719
you're not ready but the world is not
 

4633
01:21:23,719 --> 01:21:26,149
you're not ready but the world is not
ready yeah so many times like starter

4634
01:21:26,149 --> 01:21:26,159
ready yeah so many times like starter
 

4635
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:29,390
ready yeah so many times like starter
fins are too early with their idea yeah

4636
01:21:29,390 --> 01:21:29,400
fins are too early with their idea yeah
 

4637
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:31,550
fins are too early with their idea yeah
100% robotics is an interesting one for

4638
01:21:31,550 --> 01:21:31,560
100% robotics is an interesting one for
 

4639
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:33,470
100% robotics is an interesting one for
that because like there's been a lot of

4640
01:21:33,470 --> 01:21:33,480
that because like there's been a lot of
 

4641
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:35,709
that because like there's been a lot of
Robotics companies that failed yeah

4642
01:21:35,709 --> 01:21:35,719
Robotics companies that failed yeah
 

4643
01:21:35,719 --> 01:21:37,149
Robotics companies that failed yeah
because it's been very difficult to

4644
01:21:37,149 --> 01:21:37,159
because it's been very difficult to
 

4645
01:21:37,159 --> 01:21:38,669
because it's been very difficult to
build a robotics company make money

4646
01:21:38,669 --> 01:21:38,679
build a robotics company make money
 

4647
01:21:38,679 --> 01:21:40,030
build a robotics company make money
because there the manufacturing like the

4648
01:21:40,030 --> 01:21:40,040
because there the manufacturing like the
 

4649
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:41,790
because there the manufacturing like the
cost of everything the intelligence of

4650
01:21:41,790 --> 01:21:41,800
cost of everything the intelligence of
 

4651
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:45,189
cost of everything the intelligence of
the robot is enough is not sufficient to

4652
01:21:45,189 --> 01:21:45,199
the robot is enough is not sufficient to
 

4653
01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:47,189
the robot is enough is not sufficient to
create a compelling enough product from

4654
01:21:47,189 --> 01:21:47,199
create a compelling enough product from
 

4655
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:49,350
create a compelling enough product from
which to make money so all so there's

4656
01:21:49,350 --> 01:21:49,360
which to make money so all so there's
 

4657
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:51,270
which to make money so all so there's
this long line of Robotics companies

4658
01:21:51,270 --> 01:21:51,280
this long line of Robotics companies
 

4659
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:53,149
this long line of Robotics companies
that' tried they had Big Dreams and they

4660
01:21:53,149 --> 01:21:53,159
that' tried they had Big Dreams and they
 

4661
01:21:53,159 --> 01:21:55,750
that' tried they had Big Dreams and they
failed yeah like Boston Dynamics I still

4662
01:21:55,750 --> 01:21:55,760
failed yeah like Boston Dynamics I still
 

4663
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:56,750
failed yeah like Boston Dynamics I still
don't know what they're doing but they

4664
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:56,760
don't know what they're doing but they
 

4665
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:58,229
don't know what they're doing but they
always upload YouTube videos and it's

4666
01:21:58,229 --> 01:21:58,239
always upload YouTube videos and it's
 

4667
01:21:58,239 --> 01:22:00,790
always upload YouTube videos and it's
amazing but I feel like a lot of these

4668
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:00,800
amazing but I feel like a lot of these
 

4669
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,189
amazing but I feel like a lot of these
companies don't have a it's like a

4670
01:22:02,189 --> 01:22:02,199
companies don't have a it's like a
 

4671
01:22:02,199 --> 01:22:03,629
companies don't have a it's like a
solution looking for a problem for now

4672
01:22:03,629 --> 01:22:03,639
solution looking for a problem for now
 

4673
01:22:03,639 --> 01:22:05,870
solution looking for a problem for now
you know military obviously is usess but

4674
01:22:05,870 --> 01:22:05,880
you know military obviously is usess but
 

4675
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:08,750
you know military obviously is usess but
like and do I do I need like a robotic

4676
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:08,760
like and do I do I need like a robotic
 

4677
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:10,430
like and do I do I need like a robotic
dog now for my house I don't know like

4678
01:22:10,430 --> 01:22:10,440
dog now for my house I don't know like
 

4679
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:11,910
dog now for my house I don't know like
it's fun but it doesn't really solve

4680
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:11,920
it's fun but it doesn't really solve
 

4681
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:14,270
it's fun but it doesn't really solve
anything yet I feel the same kind of

4682
01:22:14,270 --> 01:22:14,280
anything yet I feel the same kind of
 

4683
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:16,070
anything yet I feel the same kind of
with VR like it's really cool like apple

4684
01:22:16,070 --> 01:22:16,080
with VR like it's really cool like apple
 

4685
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,550
with VR like it's really cool like apple
Vision Pro is very cool doesn't really

4686
01:22:17,550 --> 01:22:17,560
Vision Pro is very cool doesn't really
 

4687
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:20,390
Vision Pro is very cool doesn't really
solve something for me yet and that's

4688
01:22:20,390 --> 01:22:20,400
solve something for me yet and that's
 

4689
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:21,950
solve something for me yet and that's
kind of the the tech looking for a

4690
01:22:21,950 --> 01:22:21,960
kind of the the tech looking for a
 

4691
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:24,229
kind of the the tech looking for a
solution right but one day will when the

4692
01:22:24,229 --> 01:22:24,239
solution right but one day will when the
 

4693
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:25,910
solution right but one day will when the
person on computer when the Mac came

4694
01:22:25,910 --> 01:22:25,920
person on computer when the Mac came
 

4695
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:29,430
person on computer when the Mac came
along there was a big switch that

4696
01:22:29,430 --> 01:22:29,440
along there was a big switch that
 

4697
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:30,870
along there was a big switch that
happened it somehow captivated

4698
01:22:30,870 --> 01:22:30,880
happened it somehow captivated
 

4699
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:33,030
happened it somehow captivated
everybody's imagination you could like

4700
01:22:33,030 --> 01:22:33,040
everybody's imagination you could like
 

4701
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:36,030
everybody's imagination you could like
the application the killer apps became

4702
01:22:36,030 --> 01:22:36,040
the application the killer apps became
 

4703
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:38,030
the application the killer apps became
apparent you can type in a computer but

4704
01:22:38,030 --> 01:22:38,040
apparent you can type in a computer but
 

4705
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:39,070
apparent you can type in a computer but
did they became apparent like

4706
01:22:39,070 --> 01:22:39,080
did they became apparent like
 

4707
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:40,830
did they became apparent like
immediately back then they also had like

4708
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:40,840
immediately back then they also had like
 

4709
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:42,629
immediately back then they also had like
this thing like we don't need these

4710
01:22:42,629 --> 01:22:42,639
this thing like we don't need these
 

4711
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:46,350
this thing like we don't need these
computers uh they're like a hype and um

4712
01:22:46,350 --> 01:22:46,360
computers uh they're like a hype and um
 

4713
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:48,189
computers uh they're like a hype and um
and it also went like in kind of like

4714
01:22:48,189 --> 01:22:48,199
and it also went like in kind of like
 

4715
01:22:48,199 --> 01:22:51,430
and it also went like in kind of like
you know W yeah yeah but the hype is the

4716
01:22:51,430 --> 01:22:51,440
you know W yeah yeah but the hype is the
 

4717
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:52,669
you know W yeah yeah but the hype is the
thing that allowed the thing to

4718
01:22:52,669 --> 01:22:52,679
thing that allowed the thing to
 

4719
01:22:52,679 --> 01:22:55,149
thing that allowed the thing to
proliferate sufficiently to where people

4720
01:22:55,149 --> 01:22:55,159
proliferate sufficiently to where people
 

4721
01:22:55,159 --> 01:22:56,750
proliferate sufficiently to where people
Minds would start opening up to it a

4722
01:22:56,750 --> 01:22:56,760
Minds would start opening up to it a
 

4723
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:58,550
Minds would start opening up to it a
little bit the possibility of right now

4724
01:22:58,550 --> 01:22:58,560
little bit the possibility of right now
 

4725
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:00,189
little bit the possibility of right now
for example with the robotics there's

4726
01:23:00,189 --> 01:23:00,199
for example with the robotics there's
 

4727
01:23:00,199 --> 01:23:03,629
for example with the robotics there's
very few robots in the homes of people

4728
01:23:03,629 --> 01:23:03,639
very few robots in the homes of people
 

4729
01:23:03,639 --> 01:23:05,629
very few robots in the homes of people
exactly yeah the the robots that are

4730
01:23:05,629 --> 01:23:05,639
exactly yeah the the robots that are
 

4731
01:23:05,639 --> 01:23:07,790
exactly yeah the the robots that are
there are roombas so the vacuum cleaners

4732
01:23:07,790 --> 01:23:07,800
there are roombas so the vacuum cleaners
 

4733
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:11,310
there are roombas so the vacuum cleaners
or they're Amazon Alexa yeah or

4734
01:23:11,310 --> 01:23:11,320
or they're Amazon Alexa yeah or
 

4735
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:12,830
or they're Amazon Alexa yeah or
dishwasher I mean it's essentially a

4736
01:23:12,830 --> 01:23:12,840
dishwasher I mean it's essentially a
 

4737
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:15,189
dishwasher I mean it's essentially a
robot yes but the the intelligence is

4738
01:23:15,189 --> 01:23:15,199
robot yes but the the intelligence is
 

4739
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:16,750
robot yes but the the intelligence is
very limited I guess there one way we

4740
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:16,760
very limited I guess there one way we
 

4741
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:19,030
very limited I guess there one way we
can summarize all of them except Alexa

4742
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:19,040
can summarize all of them except Alexa
 

4743
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:21,270
can summarize all of them except Alexa
which is pretty intelligent

4744
01:23:21,270 --> 01:23:21,280
which is pretty intelligent
 

4745

kaasa that lesson is deeply within me
already that you can't control anything

4904
01:26:14,510 --> 01:26:14,520
already that you can't control anything
 

4905
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:16,390
already that you can't control anything
yes I think I probably learned that the

4906
01:26:16,390 --> 01:26:16,400
yes I think I probably learned that the

most in Jiu-Jitsu so just let go and
relax yeah and that's why I had just an

4910
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:21,600
relax yeah and that's why I had just an
 

4911
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:22,870
relax yeah and that's why I had just an
incredible experience there's like

4912
01:26:22,870 --> 01:26:22,880
incredible experience there's like
 

4913
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:25,310
incredible experience there's like
literally no negative aspect to my iasa

4914
01:26:25,310 --> 01:26:25,320
literally no negative aspect to my iasa
 

4915
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:27,310
literally no negative aspect to my iasa
experience or any psychedelics I've ever

4916
01:26:27,310 --> 01:26:27,320
experience or any psychedelics I've ever
 

4917
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:29,149
experience or any psychedelics I've ever
had some of that could be with my

4918
01:26:29,149 --> 01:26:29,159
had some of that could be with my
 

4919
01:26:29,159 --> 01:26:31,350
had some of that could be with my
biology or my genetics whatever but some

4920
01:26:31,350 --> 01:26:31,360
biology or my genetics whatever but some
 

4921
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,830
biology or my genetics whatever but some
of it was just not trying to control and

4922
01:26:33,830 --> 01:26:33,840
of it was just not trying to control and
 

4923
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,550
of it was just not trying to control and
just surf the way for sure I think most

4924
01:26:35,550 --> 01:26:35,560
just surf the way for sure I think most
 

4925
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:37,629
just surf the way for sure I think most
stress in life comes from trying to

4926
01:26:37,629 --> 01:26:37,639
stress in life comes from trying to
 

4927
01:26:37,639 --> 01:26:40,950
stress in life comes from trying to
control so once you have the idea yeah

4928
01:26:40,950 --> 01:26:40,960
control so once you have the idea yeah
 

4929
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:43,310
control so once you have the idea yeah
step two build how do you think about

4930
01:26:43,310 --> 01:26:43,320
step two build how do you think about
 

4931
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:44,629
step two build how do you think about
building The Thing Once you have the

4932
01:26:44,629 --> 01:26:44,639
building The Thing Once you have the
 

4933
01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:46,550
building The Thing Once you have the
idea I think you should build with the

4934
01:26:46,550 --> 01:26:46,560
idea I think you should build with the
 

4935
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:49,189
idea I think you should build with the
technology that you know so for example

4936
01:26:49,189 --> 01:26:49,199
technology that you know so for example
 

4937
01:26:49,199 --> 01:26:51,629
technology that you know so for example
um Nomad list which is like this website

4938
01:26:51,629 --> 01:26:51,639
um Nomad list which is like this website
 

4939
01:26:51,639 --> 01:26:53,310
um Nomad list which is like this website
I made to figure out the best cities to

4940
01:26:53,310 --> 01:26:53,320
I made to figure out the best cities to
 

4941
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:56,390
I made to figure out the best cities to
live and work as digital Nomad uh it

4942
01:26:56,390 --> 01:26:56,400
live and work as digital Nomad uh it
 

4943
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,790
live and work as digital Nomad uh it
wasn't a website it launched as a Google

4944
01:26:58,790 --> 01:26:58,800
wasn't a website it launched as a Google
 

4945
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,870
wasn't a website it launched as a Google
spreadsheet so it was a public Google

4946
01:27:00,870 --> 01:27:00,880
spreadsheet so it was a public Google
 

4947
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,870
spreadsheet so it was a public Google
spreadsheet anybody could edit and I was

4948
01:27:02,870 --> 01:27:02,880
spreadsheet anybody could edit and I was
 

4949
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:04,550
spreadsheet anybody could edit and I was
like I'm collecting like cities where we

4950
01:27:04,550 --> 01:27:04,560
like I'm collecting like cities where we
 

4951
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:06,109
like I'm collecting like cities where we
we can live as eom with the internet

4952
01:27:06,109 --> 01:27:06,119
we can live as eom with the internet
 

4953
01:27:06,119 --> 01:27:09,149
we can live as eom with the internet
speed the cost of living um you know

4954
01:27:09,149 --> 01:27:09,159
speed the cost of living um you know
 

4955
01:27:09,159 --> 01:27:11,470
speed the cost of living um you know
other stuff and I would I tweeted it and

4956
01:27:11,470 --> 01:27:11,480
other stuff and I would I tweeted it and
 

4957
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:12,590
other stuff and I would I tweeted it and
I would and back then I didn't have a

4958
01:27:12,590 --> 01:27:12,600
I would and back then I didn't have a
 

4959
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:13,910
I would and back then I didn't have a
lot of followers I had like a few

4960
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:13,920
lot of followers I had like a few
 

4961
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,550
lot of followers I had like a few
thousand followers or something and it

4962
01:27:15,550 --> 01:27:15,560
thousand followers or something and it
 

4963
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:17,790
thousand followers or something and it
went like viral for my skill viral back

4964
01:27:17,790 --> 01:27:17,800
went like viral for my skill viral back
 

4965
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:18,910
went like viral for my skill viral back
then you know which was like five

4966
01:27:18,910 --> 01:27:18,920
then you know which was like five
 

4967
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:21,270
then you know which was like five
retweets and um and a lot of people

4968
01:27:21,270 --> 01:27:21,280
retweets and um and a lot of people
 

4969
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:22,430
retweets and um and a lot of people
started editing it and there was like

4970
01:27:22,430 --> 01:27:22,440
started editing it and there was like
 

4971
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:23,870
started editing it and there was like
hundreds of cities in this list like

4972
01:27:23,870 --> 01:27:23,880
hundreds of cities in this list like
 

4973
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:25,950
hundreds of cities in this list like
from of the world with all the data was

4974
01:27:25,950 --> 01:27:25,960
from of the world with all the data was
 

4975
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:28,030
from of the world with all the data was
very crowdsourced and then I made that

4976
01:27:28,030 --> 01:27:28,040
very crowdsourced and then I made that
 

4977
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:31,629
very crowdsourced and then I made that
into a website so figuring out like what

4978
01:27:31,629 --> 01:27:31,639
into a website so figuring out like what
 

4979
01:27:31,639 --> 01:27:33,149
into a website so figuring out like what
technology you can use that you already

4980
01:27:33,149 --> 01:27:33,159
technology you can use that you already
 

4981
01:27:33,159 --> 01:27:34,790
technology you can use that you already
know so if you cannot code you can use a

4982
01:27:34,790 --> 01:27:34,800
know so if you cannot code you can use a
 

4983
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:37,270
know so if you cannot code you can use a
spreadsheet if you cannot um use a

4984
01:27:37,270 --> 01:27:37,280
spreadsheet if you cannot um use a
 

4985
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:39,830
spreadsheet if you cannot um use a
spreadsheet like whatever you can always

4986
01:27:39,830 --> 01:27:39,840
spreadsheet like whatever you can always
 

4987
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:41,750
spreadsheet like whatever you can always
use a for example a website generator

4988
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:41,760
use a for example a website generator
 

4989
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:43,270
use a for example a website generator
like weeks or something or Squarespace

4990
01:27:43,270 --> 01:27:43,280
like weeks or something or Squarespace
 

4991
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:45,550
like weeks or something or Squarespace
right like you don't need to code to

4992
01:27:45,550 --> 01:27:45,560
right like you don't need to code to
 

4993
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:47,950
right like you don't need to code to
build a startup all you need is a idea

4994
01:27:47,950 --> 01:27:47,960
build a startup all you need is a idea
 

4995
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:50,430
build a startup all you need is a idea
for a product um build something like a

4996
01:27:50,430 --> 01:27:50,440
for a product um build something like a
 

4997
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:52,870
for a product um build something like a
landing page or something um put a

4998
01:27:52,870 --> 01:27:52,880
landing page or something um put a
 

4999
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:55,390
landing page or something um put a
stripe button on there and then make it

5000
01:27:55,390 --> 01:27:55,400
stripe button on there and then make it
 

5001
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:57,229
stripe button on there and then make it
um and if you can code use the language

5002
01:27:57,229 --> 01:27:57,239
um and if you can code use the language
 

5003
01:27:57,239 --> 01:27:58,950
um and if you can code use the language
that you already you know and start

5004
01:27:58,950 --> 01:27:58,960
that you already you know and start
 

5005
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,470
that you already you know and start
coding with that and see how far you can

5006
01:28:00,470 --> 01:28:00,480
coding with that and see how far you can
 

5007
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:02,669
coding with that and see how far you can
get you can always rewrite the code

5008
01:28:02,669 --> 01:28:02,679
get you can always rewrite the code
 

5009
01:28:02,679 --> 01:28:05,030
get you can always rewrite the code
later like the tax stack is not actually

5010
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:05,040
later like the tax stack is not actually
 

5011
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:06,070
later like the tax stack is not actually
it's not the most important of a

5012
01:28:06,070 --> 01:28:06,080
it's not the most important of a
 

5013
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:07,149
it's not the most important of a
business when you're starting out a

5014
01:28:07,149 --> 01:28:07,159
business when you're starting out a
 

5015
01:28:07,159 --> 01:28:08,350
business when you're starting out a
business the important thing is that you

5016
01:28:08,350 --> 01:28:08,360
business the important thing is that you
 

5017
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:09,910
business the important thing is that you
validate that there's a market that

5018
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:09,920
validate that there's a market that
 

5019
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:10,870
validate that there's a market that
there's a product that people want to

5020
01:28:10,870 --> 01:28:10,880
there's a product that people want to
 

5021
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:14,310
there's a product that people want to
pay for um so use whatever you can use

5022
01:28:14,310 --> 01:28:14,320
pay for um so use whatever you can use
 

5023
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:17,470
pay for um so use whatever you can use
and if you canot code use you know

5024
01:28:17,470 --> 01:28:17,480
and if you canot code use you know
 

5025
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:19,270
and if you canot code use you know
spreadsheets landing page generators

5026
01:28:19,270 --> 01:28:19,280
spreadsheets landing page generators
 

5027
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:21,390

whatever yeah and the crowdsourcing
 

5029
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:22,590
whatever yeah and the crowdsourcing
element is

5030
01:28:22,590 --> 01:28:22,600
element is
 

5031
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:25,470

5033
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:26,950
fascinating uh it's cool it's cool when
a lot of people start using it you get

5034
01:28:26,950 --> 01:28:26,960
a lot of people start using it you get
 

5035
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:30,390
a lot of people start using it you get
to learn so fast yeah uh like i' I've

5036
01:28:30,390 --> 01:28:30,400
to learn so fast yeah uh like i' I've

interesting things start happening yeah
 

5045
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:42,149
interesting things start happening yeah
I did it for like a a workout thing cuz

5046
01:28:42,149 --> 01:28:42,159
I did it for like a a workout thing cuz
 

5047
01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:43,910
I did it for like a a workout thing cuz
I was doing a large amount of push-ups

5048
01:28:43,910 --> 01:28:43,920
I was doing a large amount of push-ups
 

5049
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,030
I was doing a large amount of push-ups
and pull-ups every day yeah I remember

01:29:20,950 --> 01:29:20,960
spreadsheet and then there's the out
 

5081
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:22,510
spreadsheet and then there's the out
Outcast who go to the bottom of the

know anything about so canvas is a way

5224
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:51,760
know anything about so canvas is a way
 

5225
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:55,030
know anything about so canvas is a way
is HTM yes HTML

5226
01:31:55,030 --> 01:31:55,040
is HTM yes HTML
 

5227
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:57,830
is HTM yes HTML
five thing that allows you to draw

5228
01:31:57,830 --> 01:31:57,840
five thing that allows you to draw
 

5229
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:59,790
five thing that allows you to draw
shapes draw images just draw pixels

5230
01:31:59,790 --> 01:31:59,800
shapes draw images just draw pixels
 

5231
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:01,750
shapes draw images just draw pixels
essentially so yeah and that's there was

5232
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:01,760
essentially so yeah and that's there was
 

5233
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:03,390
essentially so yeah and that's there was
special back then because before you

5234
01:32:03,390 --> 01:32:03,400
special back then because before you
 

5235
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:04,669
special back then because before you
could only have like elements right so

5236
01:32:04,669 --> 01:32:04,679
could only have like elements right so
 

5237
01:32:04,679 --> 01:32:07,270
could only have like elements right so
you want to draw a pixel use a convos

5238
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:07,280
you want to draw a pixel use a convos
 

5239
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:08,709
you want to draw a pixel use a convos
and I knew I needed to draw pixels

5240
01:32:08,709 --> 01:32:08,719
and I knew I needed to draw pixels
 

5241
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:10,550
and I knew I needed to draw pixels
because I need to draw these colors and

5242
01:32:10,550 --> 01:32:10,560
because I need to draw these colors and
 

5243
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,149
because I need to draw these colors and
I thought like okay I'll get like a

5244
01:32:12,149 --> 01:32:12,159
I thought like okay I'll get like a
 

5245
01:32:12,159 --> 01:32:15,189
I thought like okay I'll get like a
Google Maps iframe embed and then I'll

5246
01:32:15,189 --> 01:32:15,199
Google Maps iframe embed and then I'll
 

5247
01:32:15,199 --> 01:32:17,990
Google Maps iframe embed and then I'll
put a div on top of it with the colors

5248
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:18,000
put a div on top of it with the colors
 

5249
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,790
put a div on top of it with the colors
and I'll do like opacity 50 you know so

5250
01:32:19,790 --> 01:32:19,800
and I'll do like opacity 50 you know so
 

5251
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:22,990
and I'll do like opacity 50 you know so
it kind of shows um so I did that with

5252
01:32:22,990 --> 01:32:23,000
it kind of shows um so I did that with
 

5253
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,390
it kind of shows um so I did that with
convos and then I started drawing um and

5254
01:32:25,390 --> 01:32:25,400
convos and then I started drawing um and
 

5255
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:27,270
convos and then I started drawing um and
then I felt like obviously other people

5256
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:27,280
then I felt like obviously other people
 

5257
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:29,030
then I felt like obviously other people
need to edit this cuz I cannot draw all

5258
01:32:29,030 --> 01:32:29,040
need to edit this cuz I cannot draw all
 

5259
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:31,470
need to edit this cuz I cannot draw all
these things myself so I crowdsourced it

5260
01:32:31,470 --> 01:32:31,480
these things myself so I crowdsourced it
 

5261
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:33,910
these things myself so I crowdsourced it
again and I uh you would draw on the map

5262
01:32:33,910 --> 01:32:33,920
again and I uh you would draw on the map
 

5263
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:35,470
again and I uh you would draw on the map
and then it would send the pixel data to

5264
01:32:35,470 --> 01:32:35,480
and then it would send the pixel data to
 

5265
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:36,629
and then it would send the pixel data to
the server it would put it in the

5266
01:32:36,629 --> 01:32:36,639
the server it would put it in the
 

5267
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:38,750
the server it would put it in the
database and then I would have a robot

5268
01:32:38,750 --> 01:32:38,760
database and then I would have a robot
 

5269
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:40,790
database and then I would have a robot
running like a Cron job MH which every

5270
01:32:40,790 --> 01:32:40,800
running like a Cron job MH which every
 

5271
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,070
running like a Cron job MH which every
week would calculate or every day would

5272
01:32:42,070 --> 01:32:42,080
week would calculate or every day would
 

5273
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:44,590
week would calculate or every day would
calculate like okay so mm Center there's

5274
01:32:44,590 --> 01:32:44,600
calculate like okay so mm Center there's
 

5275
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:47,629
calculate like okay so mm Center there's
like six people say it's tourist this

5276
01:32:47,629 --> 01:32:47,639
like six people say it's tourist this
 

5277
01:32:47,639 --> 01:32:49,550
like six people say it's tourist this
part of the center but two people say

5278
01:32:49,550 --> 01:32:49,560
part of the center but two people say
 

5279
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:51,990
part of the center but two people say
it's like hipster okay so the tourist

5280
01:32:51,990 --> 01:32:52,000
it's like hipster okay so the tourist
 

5281
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,910
it's like hipster okay so the tourist
part wins right it's just an array so so

5282
01:32:53,910 --> 01:32:53,920
part wins right it's just an array so so
 

5283
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:56,229
part wins right it's just an array so so
find the most common value in a little

5284
01:32:56,229 --> 01:32:56,239
find the most common value in a little
 

5285
01:32:56,239 --> 01:32:59,590
find the most common value in a little
pixel area on a map so so that so most

5286
01:32:59,590 --> 01:32:59,600
pixel area on a map so so that so most
 

5287
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:00,870
pixel area on a map so so that so most
people say it's tourist it's tourist and

5288
01:33:00,870 --> 01:33:00,880
people say it's tourist it's tourist and
 

5289
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:03,350
people say it's tourist it's tourist and
it becomes redh and I would do that for

5290
01:33:03,350 --> 01:33:03,360
it becomes redh and I would do that for
 

5291
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,430
it becomes redh and I would do that for
you know older GPS Corners in the world

5292
01:33:05,430 --> 01:33:05,440
you know older GPS Corners in the world
 

5293
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:08,390
you know older GPS Corners in the world
can we just clarify do you have to be as

5294
01:33:08,390 --> 01:33:08,400
can we just clarify do you have to be as
 

5295
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:09,990
can we just clarify do you have to be as
a human that's contributing to this do

5296
01:33:09,990 --> 01:33:10,000
a human that's contributing to this do
 

5297
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,550
a human that's contributing to this do
you have to be in that location to make

5298
01:33:11,550 --> 01:33:11,560
you have to be in that location to make
 

5299
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:13,550
you have to be in that location to make
the label or no people just type in

5300
01:33:13,550 --> 01:33:13,560
the label or no people just type in
 

5301
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:15,750
the label or no people just type in
cities and go like go berserk and start

5302
01:33:15,750 --> 01:33:15,760
cities and go like go berserk and start
 

5303
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:17,350
cities and go like go berserk and start
drawing everywhere would they draw

5304
01:33:17,350 --> 01:33:17,360
drawing everywhere would they draw
 

5305
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:18,669
drawing everywhere would they draw
shapes or would they draw pixels man

5306
01:33:18,669 --> 01:33:18,679
shapes or would they draw pixels man
 

5307
01:33:18,679 --> 01:33:19,950
shapes or would they draw pixels man
they drew that crazy stuff like

5308
01:33:19,950 --> 01:33:19,960
they drew that crazy stuff like
 

5309
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:21,790
they drew that crazy stuff like
offensive symbols I cannot mention they

5310
01:33:21,790 --> 01:33:21,800
offensive symbols I cannot mention they
 

5311
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:24,270
offensive symbols I cannot mention they
would draw penises I mean that's

5312
01:33:24,270 --> 01:33:24,280
would draw penises I mean that's
 

5313
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:26,350
would draw penises I mean that's
that's obviously a guy I would do the

5314
01:33:26,350 --> 01:33:26,360
that's obviously a guy I would do the
 

5315
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:27,950
that's obviously a guy I would do the
same thing draw penises that's the first

5316
01:33:27,950 --> 01:33:27,960
same thing draw penises that's the first
 

5317
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:29,830
same thing draw penises that's the first
thing when I show up to Mars and there's

5318
01:33:29,830 --> 01:33:29,840
thing when I show up to Mars and there's
 

5319
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:31,790
thing when I show up to Mars and there's
no cameras I'm drawing penis on the same

5320
01:33:31,790 --> 01:33:31,800
no cameras I'm drawing penis on the same
 

5321
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:33,510
no cameras I'm drawing penis on the same
man I do it in the snow you know but the

5322
01:33:33,510 --> 01:33:33,520
man I do it in the snow you know but the
 

5323
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:35,350
man I do it in the snow you know but the
penises did not become a problem because

5324
01:33:35,350 --> 01:33:35,360
penises did not become a problem because
 

5325
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,629
penises did not become a problem because
I knew that not everybody would draw a

5326
01:33:36,629 --> 01:33:36,639
I knew that not everybody would draw a
 

5327
01:33:36,639 --> 01:33:38,830
I knew that not everybody would draw a
penis and not in the same place so most

5328
01:33:38,830 --> 01:33:38,840
penis and not in the same place so most
 

5329
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:41,070
penis and not in the same place so most
people would use it fairly so just if I

5330
01:33:41,070 --> 01:33:41,080
people would use it fairly so just if I
 

5331
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:43,390
people would use it fairly so just if I
had enough crowdsource data so you have

5332
01:33:43,390 --> 01:33:43,400
had enough crowdsource data so you have
 

5333
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:44,669
had enough crowdsource data so you have
all these pixels on top of each it's

5334
01:33:44,669 --> 01:33:44,679
all these pixels on top of each it's
 

5335
01:33:44,679 --> 01:33:46,629
all these pixels on top of each it's
like a layer of pixels and you choose

5336
01:33:46,629 --> 01:33:46,639
like a layer of pixels and you choose
 

5337
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:49,070
like a layer of pixels and you choose
the most common pixel so yeah it's just

5338
01:33:49,070 --> 01:33:49,080
the most common pixel so yeah it's just
 

5339
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:51,709
the most common pixel so yeah it's just
like a bow but in visual format and it

5340
01:33:51,709 --> 01:33:51,719
like a bow but in visual format and it
 

5341
01:33:51,719 --> 01:33:54,350
like a bow but in visual format and it
worked and uh we didn't we had enough

5342
01:33:54,350 --> 01:33:54,360
worked and uh we didn't we had enough
 

5343
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:56,790
worked and uh we didn't we had enough
data and and and it was like cities that

5344
01:33:56,790 --> 01:33:56,800
data and and and it was like cities that
 

5345
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:59,070
data and and and it was like cities that
did really well like Los Angeles a lot

5346
01:33:59,070 --> 01:33:59,080
did really well like Los Angeles a lot
 

5347
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:01,030
did really well like Los Angeles a lot
of people started using it uh like most

5348
01:34:01,030 --> 01:34:01,040
of people started using it uh like most
 

5349
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:03,229
of people started using it uh like most
datas in Los Angeles because uh Los

5350
01:34:03,229 --> 01:34:03,239
datas in Los Angeles because uh Los
 

5351
01:34:03,239 --> 01:34:06,149
datas in Los Angeles because uh Los
Angeles is has defined neighborhoods

5352
01:34:06,149 --> 01:34:06,159
Angeles is has defined neighborhoods
 

5353
01:34:06,159 --> 01:34:08,950
Angeles is has defined neighborhoods
yeah and not just in terms of the the

5354
01:34:08,950 --> 01:34:08,960

5510
01:37:12,510 --> 01:37:12,520
how do you combine that to be a thing
 

5511
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:14,270
how do you combine that to be a thing
that actually makes some sense I think

5512
01:37:14,270 --> 01:37:14,280
that actually makes some sense I think
 

5513
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:15,709
that actually makes some sense I think
here the problem was that you have this

5514
01:37:15,709 --> 01:37:15,719
here the problem was that you have this
 

5515
01:37:15,719 --> 01:37:18,629
here the problem was that you have this
data but it's like it's not locked to

5516
01:37:18,629 --> 01:37:18,639
data but it's like it's not locked to
 

5517
01:37:18,639 --> 01:37:21,030
data but it's like it's not locked to
one location yeah so I had to normalize

5518
01:37:21,030 --> 01:37:21,040
one location yeah so I had to normalize
 

5519
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:22,950
one location yeah so I had to normalize
it so when you click when you draw on a

5520
01:37:22,950 --> 01:37:22,960
it so when you click when you draw on a
 

5521
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:25,270
it so when you click when you draw on a
map it will show you the specific pixel

5522
01:37:25,270 --> 01:37:25,280
map it will show you the specific pixel
 

5523
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:26,590
map it will show you the specific pixel
location and you can convert the pixel

5524
01:37:26,590 --> 01:37:26,600
location and you can convert the pixel
 

5525
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:28,270
location and you can convert the pixel
location to a GPS coordinate right like

5526
01:37:28,270 --> 01:37:28,280
location to a GPS coordinate right like
 

5527
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:30,310
location to a GPS coordinate right like
latitude longitudes but the number will

5528
01:37:30,310 --> 01:37:30,320
latitude longitudes but the number will
 

5529
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:31,510
latitude longitudes but the number will
have a lot of commas or a lot of

5530
01:37:31,510 --> 01:37:31,520
have a lot of commas or a lot of
 

5531
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:32,590
have a lot of commas or a lot of
decimals right because it's very

5532
01:37:32,590 --> 01:37:32,600
decimals right because it's very
 

5533
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:34,030
decimals right because it's very
specific like it's like this specific

5534
01:37:34,030 --> 01:37:34,040
specific like it's like this specific
 

5535
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:35,750
specific like it's like this specific
part of the table so what you want to do

5536
01:37:35,750 --> 01:37:35,760
part of the table so what you want to do
 

5537
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:37,470
part of the table so what you want to do
is you want to take that pixel and you

5538
01:37:37,470 --> 01:37:37,480
is you want to take that pixel and you
 

5539
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:39,510
is you want to take that pixel and you
want to normalize it by removing like

5540
01:37:39,510 --> 01:37:39,520
want to normalize it by removing like
 

5541
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:42,229
want to normalize it by removing like
decimals um which I discovered so that

5542
01:37:42,229 --> 01:37:42,239
decimals um which I discovered so that
 

5543
01:37:42,239 --> 01:37:43,030
decimals um which I discovered so that
you you're talking about this

5544
01:37:43,030 --> 01:37:43,040
you you're talking about this
 

5545
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:45,070
you you're talking about this
neighborhood this or this street right

5546
01:37:45,070 --> 01:37:45,080
neighborhood this or this street right
 

5547
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:46,390
neighborhood this or this street right
so that's what I did I just took the

5548
01:37:46,390 --> 01:37:46,400
so that's what I did I just took the
 

5549
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:48,109
so that's what I did I just took the
decimals off and then I saved it like

5550
01:37:48,109 --> 01:37:48,119
decimals off and then I saved it like
 

5551
01:37:48,119 --> 01:37:51,189
decimals off and then I saved it like
this and then it starts um going to like

5552
01:37:51,189 --> 01:37:51,199
this and then it starts um going to like
 

5553
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:53,790
this and then it starts um going to like
a grid and then you have like a grid of

5554
01:37:53,790 --> 01:37:53,800
a grid and then you have like a grid of
 

5555
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:56,390
a grid and then you have like a grid of
data you get like a pixel map kind of

5556
01:37:56,390 --> 01:37:56,400
data you get like a pixel map kind of
 

5557
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,149
data you get like a pixel map kind of
and then you said it looks kind of ugly

5558
01:37:58,149 --> 01:37:58,159
and then you said it looks kind of ugly
 

5559
01:37:58,159 --> 01:38:00,550
and then you said it looks kind of ugly
so then you smooth it yeah I started

5560
01:38:00,550 --> 01:38:00,560
so then you smooth it yeah I started
 

5561
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:02,669
so then you smooth it yeah I started
adding blurring and stuff I think now

5562
01:38:02,669 --> 01:38:02,679
adding blurring and stuff I think now
 

5563
01:38:02,679 --> 01:38:04,350
adding blurring and stuff I think now
it's it's not smooth again because I

5564
01:38:04,350 --> 01:38:04,360
it's it's not smooth again because I
 

5565
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:06,070
it's it's not smooth again because I
liked it better people like the pixel

5566
01:38:06,070 --> 01:38:06,080
liked it better people like the pixel
 

5567
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:08,149
liked it better people like the pixel
look kind of yeah a lot of people use it

5568
01:38:08,149 --> 01:38:08,159
look kind of yeah a lot of people use it
 

5569
01:38:08,159 --> 01:38:09,950
look kind of yeah a lot of people use it
and it keeps going viral and every time

5570
01:38:09,950 --> 01:38:09,960
and it keeps going viral and every time
 

5571
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:13,669
and it keeps going viral and every time
my my maps Bill uh like map box I had to

5572
01:38:13,669 --> 01:38:13,679
my my maps Bill uh like map box I had to
 

5573
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:15,310
my my maps Bill uh like map box I had to
stop using first used Google Maps it

5574
01:38:15,310 --> 01:38:15,320
stop using first used Google Maps it
 

5575
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:17,790
stop using first used Google Maps it
went viral and Google Maps it was out of

5576
01:38:17,790 --> 01:38:17,800
went viral and Google Maps it was out of
 

5577
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:21,109
went viral and Google Maps it was out of
credits so I and I had to so funny

5578
01:38:21,109 --> 01:38:21,119
credits so I and I had to so funny
 

5579
01:38:21,119 --> 01:38:24,430
credits so I and I had to so funny
during when I launched it went viral um

5580
01:38:24,430 --> 01:38:24,440
during when I launched it went viral um
 

5581
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:26,109
during when I launched it went viral um
Google Maps the map didn't load anymore

5582
01:38:26,109 --> 01:38:26,119
Google Maps the map didn't load anymore
 

5583
01:38:26,119 --> 01:38:27,830
Google Maps the map didn't load anymore
it says over the limit you need to

5584
01:38:27,830 --> 01:38:27,840
it says over the limit you need to
 

5585
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:30,830
it says over the limit you need to
contact Enterprise sales and I'm like I

5586
01:38:30,830 --> 01:38:30,840
contact Enterprise sales and I'm like I
 

5587
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:32,950
contact Enterprise sales and I'm like I
but I need now like a map so and I don't

5588
01:38:32,950 --> 01:38:32,960
but I need now like a map so and I don't
 

5589
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:34,229
but I need now like a map so and I don't
want to contact Enterprise sales I don't

5590
01:38:34,229 --> 01:38:34,239
want to contact Enterprise sales I don't
 

5591
01:38:34,239 --> 01:38:36,109
want to contact Enterprise sales I don't
want to go on a call schedule with some

5592
01:38:36,109 --> 01:38:36,119
want to go on a call schedule with some
 

5593
01:38:36,119 --> 01:38:38,350
want to go on a call schedule with some
calendar so I switched to mapbox and

5594
01:38:38,350 --> 01:38:38,360
calendar so I switched to mapbox and
 

5595
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:40,950
calendar so I switched to mapbox and
then had mapbox for years and then it

5596
01:38:40,950 --> 01:38:40,960
then had mapbox for years and then it
 

5597
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:43,430
then had mapbox for years and then it
went viral and I had a bill of $20,000

5598
01:38:43,430 --> 01:38:43,440
went viral and I had a bill of $20,000
 

5599
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:46,070
went viral and I had a bill of $20,000
was like last year um so they helped me

5600
01:38:46,070 --> 01:38:46,080
was like last year um so they helped me
 

5601
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:47,950
was like last year um so they helped me
with the bill they said you know you can

5602
01:38:47,950 --> 01:38:47,960
with the bill they said you know you can
 

5603
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:50,229
with the bill they said you know you can
pay less and then I now switch to like a

5604
01:38:50,229 --> 01:38:50,239
pay less and then I now switch to like a
 

5605
01:38:50,239 --> 01:38:52,790
pay less and then I now switch to like a
open source kind of um map platform so

5606
01:38:52,790 --> 01:38:52,800
open source kind of um map platform so
 

5607
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,830
open source kind of um map platform so
it's very expensive project and it never

5608
01:38:54,830 --> 01:38:54,840
it's very expensive project and it never
 

5609
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:57,030
it's very expensive project and it never
made any dollar money but it's very fun

5610
01:38:57,030 --> 01:38:57,040
made any dollar money but it's very fun
 

5611
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:58,390
made any dollar money but it's very fun
but it's very expensive what do you

5612
01:38:58,390 --> 01:38:58,400
but it's very expensive what do you
 

5613
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:02,070
but it's very expensive what do you
learn from that so like from that

5614
01:39:02,070 --> 01:39:02,080
learn from that so like from that
 

5615
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:04,070
learn from that so like from that
experience cuz when you leverage

5616
01:39:04,070 --> 01:39:04,080
experience cuz when you leverage
 

5617
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:07,030
experience cuz when you leverage
somebody else's through the API yeah I

5618
01:39:07,030 --> 01:39:07,040
somebody else's through the API yeah I
 

5619
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:09,709
somebody else's through the API yeah I
mean I don't think a map hosting service

5620
01:39:09,709 --> 01:39:09,719
mean I don't think a map hosting service
 

5621
01:39:09,719 --> 01:39:12,750
mean I don't think a map hosting service
should cost this much you know but uh I

5622
01:39:12,750 --> 01:39:12,760
should cost this much you know but uh I
 

5623
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:14,910
should cost this much you know but uh I
could host it myself but that would be I

5624
01:39:14,910 --> 01:39:14,920
could host it myself but that would be I
 

5625
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:16,270
could host it myself but that would be I
don't know how to do that you know but I

5626
01:39:16,270 --> 01:39:16,280
don't know how to do that you know but I
 

5627
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:19,109
don't know how to do that you know but I
could do that yes it's super complicated

5628
01:39:19,109 --> 01:39:19,119
could do that yes it's super complicated
 

5629
01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:20,310
could do that yes it's super complicated
I think that the thing is more about

5630
01:39:20,310 --> 01:39:20,320
I think that the thing is more about
 

5631
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:21,830
I think that the thing is more about
like you can't make money with this

5632
01:39:21,830 --> 01:39:21,840
like you can't make money with this
 

5633
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:23,709
like you can't make money with this
project I tried to do many things to

5634
01:39:23,709 --> 01:39:23,719
project I tried to do many things to
 

5635
01:39:23,719 --> 01:39:25,589
project I tried to do many things to
make money with it and it's it's uh it

5636
01:39:25,589 --> 01:39:25,599
make money with it and it's it's uh it
 

5637
01:39:25,599 --> 01:39:27,550
make money with it and it's it's uh it
hasn't worked you talked about like

5638
01:39:27,550 --> 01:39:27,560
hasn't worked you talked about like
 

5639
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:29,470
hasn't worked you talked about like
possibly doing advertisements on it or

5640
01:39:29,470 --> 01:39:29,480
possibly doing advertisements on it or
 

5641
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:32,030
possibly doing advertisements on it or
some somehow or people sponsoring it

5642
01:39:32,030 --> 01:39:32,040
some somehow or people sponsoring it
 

5643
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:33,870
some somehow or people sponsoring it
yeah well it's really surprising to me

5644
01:39:33,870 --> 01:39:33,880
yeah well it's really surprising to me
 

5645
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:36,589
yeah well it's really surprising to me
that people don't want to advertise on

5646
01:39:36,589 --> 01:39:36,599
that people don't want to advertise on
 

5647
01:39:36,599 --> 01:39:38,709
that people don't want to advertise on
it I think map apps are very hard to

5648
01:39:38,709 --> 01:39:38,719
it I think map apps are very hard to
 

5649
01:39:38,719 --> 01:39:40,229
it I think map apps are very hard to
like monetize like Google Maps also

5650
01:39:40,229 --> 01:39:40,239
like monetize like Google Maps also
 

5651
01:39:40,239 --> 01:39:41,430
like monetize like Google Maps also
doesn't really make money like sometimes

5652
01:39:41,430 --> 01:39:41,440
doesn't really make money like sometimes
 

5653
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,149
doesn't really make money like sometimes
you see these ads but I don't think

5654
01:39:43,149 --> 01:39:43,159
you see these ads but I don't think
 

5655
01:39:43,159 --> 01:39:45,390
you see these ads but I don't think
there's a lot of money there um you

5656
01:39:45,390 --> 01:39:45,400
there's a lot of money there um you
 

5657
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:46,830
there's a lot of money there um you
could put like a banner ad but it's kind

5658
01:39:46,830 --> 01:39:46,840
could put like a banner ad but it's kind
 

5659
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:48,910
could put like a banner ad but it's kind
of ugly and the project is kind of like

5660
01:39:48,910 --> 01:39:48,920
of ugly and the project is kind of like
 

5661
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:50,709
of ugly and the project is kind of like
it's kind of cool so it's it's kind of

little bit part of nomad list like I put

5666
01:39:54,350 --> 01:39:54,360
little bit part of nomad list like I put
 

5667
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:56,550
little bit part of nomad list like I put
it on Nomad list in the cities as well

5668

it on Nomad list in the cities as well
 

5669
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:58,870
it on Nomad list in the cities as well
um but I also realized like you don't

5670
01:39:58,870 --> 01:39:58,880
um but I also realized like you don't
 

5671
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:00,709
um but I also realized like you don't
need to monetize everything like some

5672
01:40:00,709 --> 01:40:00,719
need to monetize everything like some
 

5673
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:03,350
need to monetize everything like some
projects are just cool and you know it's

5674
01:40:03,350 --> 01:40:03,360
projects are just cool and you know it's
 

5675

I I want this to exist right yeah
 

5679
01:40:08,679 --> 01:40:09,990
I I want this to exist right yeah
there's a bunch of stuff you've created

5680
01:40:09,990 --> 01:40:10,000
there's a bunch of stuff you've created
 

5681
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,589
there's a bunch of stuff you've created
that I'm just glad exists in this world

5682
01:40:11,589 --> 01:40:11,599
that I'm just glad exists in this world
 

5683
01:40:11,599 --> 01:40:13,430
that I'm just glad exists in this world
that's true and it's a whole another

5684
01:40:13,430 --> 01:40:13,440
that's true and it's a whole another
 

5685
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:16,149
that's true and it's a whole another
puzzle and I'm surprised to figure out

5686
01:40:16,149 --> 01:40:16,159
puzzle and I'm surprised to figure out
 

5687
01:40:16,159 --> 01:40:17,750
puzzle and I'm surprised to figure out
how to make money off of it I'm

5688
01:40:17,750 --> 01:40:17,760
how to make money off of it I'm
 

5689
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:19,750
how to make money off of it I'm
surprised Maps don't make money but

5690
01:40:19,750 --> 01:40:19,760
surprised Maps don't make money but
 

5691
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:21,790
surprised Maps don't make money but
you're right it's it's hard it's hard to

5692
01:40:21,790 --> 01:40:21,800
you're right it's it's hard it's hard to
 

5693
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:23,790
you're right it's it's hard it's hard to
make money cuz there's there's a lot of

5694
01:40:23,790 --> 01:40:23,800
make money cuz there's there's a lot of
 

5695
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:25,470
make money cuz there's there's a lot of
compute required to actually bring it to

5696
01:40:25,470 --> 01:40:25,480
compute required to actually bring it to
 

5697
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:27,430
compute required to actually bring it to
life also where do you put the ad right

5698
01:40:27,430 --> 01:40:27,440
life also where do you put the ad right
 

5699
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:29,669
life also where do you put the ad right
like if you have a website you can put

5700
01:40:29,669 --> 01:40:29,679
like if you have a website you can put
 

5701
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:30,950
like if you have a website you can put
like a ad box or you can do like a

5702
01:40:30,950 --> 01:40:30,960
like a ad box or you can do like a
 

5703
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:32,669
like a ad box or you can do like a
product placement or something but

5704
01:40:32,669 --> 01:40:32,679
product placement or something but
 

5705
01:40:32,679 --> 01:40:34,070
product placement or something but
you're talking about a map app that

5706
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:34,080
you're talking about a map app that
 

5707
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:36,709
you're talking about a map app that
where 90% of the interface is a map so

5708
01:40:36,709 --> 01:40:36,719
where 90% of the interface is a map so
 

5709
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:37,629
where 90% of the interface is a map so
what are you going to do you're going to

5710
01:40:37,629 --> 01:40:37,639
what are you going to do you're going to
 

5711
01:40:37,639 --> 01:40:39,669
what are you going to do you're going to
like like it's hard to figure out where

5712
01:40:39,669 --> 01:40:39,679
like like it's hard to figure out where
 

5713
01:40:39,679 --> 01:40:41,629
like like it's hard to figure out where
is this yeah and people don't want to

5714
01:40:41,629 --> 01:40:41,639
is this yeah and people don't want to
 

5715
01:40:41,639 --> 01:40:43,870
is this yeah and people don't want to
pay for it no exactly because if you

5716
01:40:43,870 --> 01:40:43,880
pay for it no exactly because if you
 

5717
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:46,109
pay for it no exactly because if you
make people pay for it you lose 99% of

5718
01:40:46,109 --> 01:40:46,119
make people pay for it you lose 99% of
 

5719
01:40:46,119 --> 01:40:47,550
make people pay for it you lose 99% of
the user base and you lose the

5720
01:40:47,550 --> 01:40:47,560
the user base and you lose the
 

5721
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:49,430
the user base and you lose the
crowdsource data so it's not fun anymore

5722
01:40:49,430 --> 01:40:49,440
crowdsource data so it's not fun anymore
 

5723
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:52,149
crowdsource data so it's not fun anymore
it stops being accurate right so you

5724
01:40:52,149 --> 01:40:52,159
it stops being accurate right so you
 

5725
01:40:52,159 --> 01:40:54,870
it stops being accurate right so you
kind of they pay for it by crowdsourcing

5726
01:40:54,870 --> 01:40:54,880
kind of they pay for it by crowdsourcing
 

5727
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:57,149
kind of they pay for it by crowdsourcing
the data but then yeah it's fine you

5728
01:40:57,149 --> 01:40:57,159
the data but then yeah it's fine you
 

5729
01:40:57,159 --> 01:40:58,669
the data but then yeah it's fine you
know it doesn't make money but it's it's

5730
01:40:58,669 --> 01:40:58,679
know it doesn't make money but it's it's
 

5731
01:40:58,679 --> 01:41:02,589
know it doesn't make money but it's it's
cool but that said NAD list makes money

5732
01:41:02,589 --> 01:41:02,599
cool but that said NAD list makes money
 

5733
01:41:02,599 --> 01:41:04,750
cool but that said NAD list makes money

5746
01:41:19,030 --> 01:41:19,040
this seems like a cool thing to do like
 

5747
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:20,629

work on your laptop in a different

5748
01:41:20,629 --> 01:41:20,639
work on your laptop in a different
 

5749

country kind of travel around uh but
 

5751
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:24,510
country kind of travel around uh but
back then the internet everywhere was

5752
01:41:24,510 --> 01:41:24,520
back then the internet everywhere was
 

5753
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:26,550
back then the internet everywhere was
very slow so the internet was fast in

5754
01:41:26,550 --> 01:41:26,560
very slow so the internet was fast in
 

5755
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:29,070
very slow so the internet was fast in
for example Holland or United States but

5756
01:41:29,070 --> 01:41:29,080
for example Holland or United States but
 

5757
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:30,950
for example Holland or United States but
in a lot of parts in in you know South

5758
01:41:30,950 --> 01:41:30,960
in a lot of parts in in you know South
 

5759
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:33,109
in a lot of parts in in you know South
America or Asia was very slow like 0.5

5760
01:41:33,109 --> 01:41:33,119
America or Asia was very slow like 0.5
 

5761
01:41:33,119 --> 01:41:34,990
America or Asia was very slow like 0.5
megabits so you you couldn't watch a

5762
01:41:34,990 --> 01:41:35,000
megabits so you you couldn't watch a
 

5763
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,830
megabits so you you couldn't watch a
Youtube video um Thailand weirdly had

5764
01:41:37,830 --> 01:41:37,840
Youtube video um Thailand weirdly had
 

5765
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:40,189
Youtube video um Thailand weirdly had
like quite fast internet but I wanted to

5766
01:41:40,189 --> 01:41:40,199
like quite fast internet but I wanted to
 

5767
01:41:40,199 --> 01:41:43,709
like quite fast internet but I wanted to
find like other cities where I could go

5768
01:41:43,709 --> 01:41:43,719
find like other cities where I could go
 

5769
01:41:43,719 --> 01:41:45,870
find like other cities where I could go
to like work on my laptop whatever and

5770
01:41:45,870 --> 01:41:45,880
to like work on my laptop whatever and
 

5771
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:47,750
to like work on my laptop whatever and
travel and but we needed like fast

5772
01:41:47,750 --> 01:41:47,760
travel and but we needed like fast
 

5773
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:50,390
travel and but we needed like fast
internet so I was like let's you know

5774
01:41:50,390 --> 01:41:50,400
internet so I was like let's you know
 

5775
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:52,430
internet so I was like let's you know
crowdsource this information uh with a

5776
01:41:52,430 --> 01:41:52,440
crowdsource this information uh with a
 

5777
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:53,589
crowdsource this information uh with a
spreadsheet and I also also needed to

5778
01:41:53,589 --> 01:41:53,599
spreadsheet and I also also needed to
 

5779
01:41:53,599 --> 01:41:54,589
spreadsheet and I also also needed to
know the cost of living cuz I didn't

5780
01:41:54,589 --> 01:41:54,599
know the cost of living cuz I didn't
 

5781
01:41:54,599 --> 01:41:56,629
know the cost of living cuz I didn't
have a lot of money I had $500 a month

5782
01:41:56,629 --> 01:41:56,639
have a lot of money I had $500 a month
 

5783
01:41:56,639 --> 01:41:57,910
have a lot of money I had $500 a month
so I had to find a place where like the

5784
01:41:57,910 --> 01:41:57,920
so I had to find a place where like the
 

5785
01:41:57,920 --> 01:41:59,709
so I had to find a place where like the
rent was like you know $200 per month or

5786
01:41:59,709 --> 01:41:59,719
rent was like you know $200 per month or
 

5787

rent was like you know $200 per month or
something where I had you know some

5788
01:42:00,790 --> 01:42:00,800
something where I had you know some
 

5789
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:02,709
something where I had you know some
money uh that I could actually rent

5790
01:42:02,709 --> 01:42:02,719
money uh that I could actually rent
 

5791
01:42:02,719 --> 01:42:06,149
money uh that I could actually rent
something and um and there was NAD list

5792
01:42:06,149 --> 01:42:06,159
something and um and there was NAD list
 

5793
01:42:06,159 --> 01:42:08,350
something and um and there was NAD list
and it still runs now I think it's now

5794
01:42:08,350 --> 01:42:08,360
and it still runs now I think it's now
 

5795
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:10,350
and it still runs now I think it's now
almost 10 years so just to describe how

5796
01:42:10,350 --> 01:42:10,360
almost 10 years so just to describe how
 

5797
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:12,950
almost 10 years so just to describe how
it works like I'm looking at Chang ma

5798
01:42:12,950 --> 01:42:12,960
it works like I'm looking at Chang ma
 

5799
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:15,310
it works like I'm looking at Chang ma
here there's a total score it's rank

5800
01:42:15,310 --> 01:42:15,320
here there's a total score it's rank
 

5801
01:42:15,320 --> 01:42:16,870
here there's a total score it's rank
number two yeah that's like a number

5802
01:42:16,870 --> 01:42:16,880
number two yeah that's like a number
 

5803
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:20,990
number two yeah that's like a number
score 4.82 uh like by members but it's

5804
01:42:20,990 --> 01:42:21,000
score 4.82 uh like by members but it's
 

5805
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,390
score 4.82 uh like by members but it's
uh it's looking at the internet in this

5806
01:42:23,390 --> 01:42:23,400
uh it's looking at the internet in this
 

5807
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:26,430
uh it's looking at the internet in this
case it's fast yeah fun temperature

I started getting FR cross data where

5872
01:43:40,030 --> 01:43:40,040
I started getting FR cross data where
 

5873
01:43:40,040 --> 01:43:42,109
I started getting FR cross data where
for example people from India they

5874
01:43:42,109 --> 01:43:42,119
for example people from India they
 

5875
01:43:42,119 --> 01:43:45,270
for example people from India they
really love India and they would submit

5876
01:43:45,270 --> 01:43:45,280
really love India and they would submit
 

5877

know but uh that's not valid data so you

5886
01:43:55,990 --> 01:43:56,000
know but uh that's not valid data so you
 

5887
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,430
know but uh that's not valid data so you
started getting discrepancy in the data

5888
01:43:57,430 --> 01:43:57,440
started getting discrepancy in the data
 

5889
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:59,229
started getting discrepancy in the data
between people where people wear from

5890
01:43:59,229 --> 01:43:59,239
between people where people wear from
 

5891
01:43:59,239 --> 01:44:01,830
between people where people wear from
and stuff so I I started switching to

5892
01:44:01,830 --> 01:44:01,840
and stuff so I I started switching to
 

5893
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:04,229
and stuff so I I started switching to
data sets and um and now it's mostly

5894
01:44:04,229 --> 01:44:04,239
data sets and um and now it's mostly
 

5895
01:44:04,239 --> 01:44:05,270
data sets and um and now it's mostly
data sets but one thing that's still

5896
01:44:05,270 --> 01:44:05,280
data sets but one thing that's still
 

5897
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:07,750
data sets but one thing that's still
crowdsource is so people add where they

with a lot of places like United States

5962
01:45:16,669 --> 01:45:16,679
with a lot of places like United States
 

5963
01:45:16,679 --> 01:45:18,790
with a lot of places like United States
is that it depends per area right so if

5964
01:45:18,790 --> 01:45:18,800
is that it depends per area right so if
 

5965
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:20,629
is that it depends per area right so if
you get like City level data or Nation

5966
01:45:20,629 --> 01:45:20,639
you get like City level data or Nation
 

5967
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:23,390
you get like City level data or Nation
level data it's like Brazil's worst

5968
01:45:23,390 --> 01:45:23,400
level data it's like Brazil's worst
 

5969
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:26,430
level data it's like Brazil's worst
because the the range in like safe and

5970
01:45:26,430 --> 01:45:26,440
because the the range in like safe and
 

5971
01:45:26,440 --> 01:45:29,470
because the the range in like safe and
wealthy and and not safe is like huge so

5972
01:45:29,470 --> 01:45:29,480
wealthy and and not safe is like huge so
 

5973
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:31,390
wealthy and and not safe is like huge so
you can't say many things about Brazil

5974
01:45:31,390 --> 01:45:31,400
you can't say many things about Brazil
 

5975

01:48:05,070 --> 01:48:05,080
create a service that allows you to have
 

6115
01:48:05,080 --> 01:48:07,270
create a service that allows you to have
like high resolution data about a hotel

6116
01:48:07,270 --> 01:48:07,280
like high resolution data about a hotel
 

6117
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:09,709
like high resolution data about a hotel
then one hotel sign signs up for that I

6118
01:48:09,709 --> 01:48:09,719
then one hotel sign signs up for that I
 

6119
01:48:09,719 --> 01:48:12,229
then one hotel sign signs up for that I
would 100% use that website to look for

6120
01:48:12,229 --> 01:48:12,239
would 100% use that website to look for
 

6121
01:48:12,239 --> 01:48:14,589
would 100% use that website to look for
a hotel instead of the crappy

6122
01:48:14,589 --> 01:48:14,599
a hotel instead of the crappy
 

6123
01:48:14,599 --> 01:48:16,350
a hotel instead of the crappy
Alternatives that don't give any

6124
01:48:16,350 --> 01:48:16,360
Alternatives that don't give any
 

6125
01:48:16,360 --> 01:48:17,910
Alternatives that don't give any
information and I feel like there'll be

6126
01:48:17,910 --> 01:48:17,920
information and I feel like there'll be
 

6127
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:19,910
information and I feel like there'll be
this pressure for all the hotels to join

6128
01:48:19,910 --> 01:48:19,920
this pressure for all the hotels to join
 

6129
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:22,030
this pressure for all the hotels to join
that site and you can make a shit ton of

6130
01:48:22,030 --> 01:48:22,040
that site and you can make a shit ton of
 

6131
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:24,149
that site and you can make a shit ton of
money cuz hotels make a lot of money I

6132
01:48:24,149 --> 01:48:24,159
money cuz hotels make a lot of money I
 

6133
01:48:24,159 --> 01:48:25,270
money cuz hotels make a lot of money I
think it's true but the problem is with

6134
01:48:25,270 --> 01:48:25,280
think it's true but the problem is with
 

6135
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:26,709
think it's true but the problem is with
these hotels like it's it's same with

6136
01:48:26,709 --> 01:48:26,719
these hotels like it's it's same with
 

6137
01:48:26,719 --> 01:48:28,350
these hotels like it's it's same with
airline industry why does every Airline

6138
01:48:28,350 --> 01:48:28,360
airline industry why does every Airline
 

6139
01:48:28,360 --> 01:48:30,229
airline industry why does every Airline
website suck when you try book book a

6140
01:48:30,229 --> 01:48:30,239
website suck when you try book book a
 

6141
01:48:30,239 --> 01:48:31,629
website suck when you try book book a
flights yeah it's like very strange like

6142
01:48:31,629 --> 01:48:31,639
flights yeah it's like very strange like
 

6143
01:48:31,639 --> 01:48:32,790
flights yeah it's like very strange like
why does it have to suck obviously

6144
01:48:32,790 --> 01:48:32,800
why does it have to suck obviously
 

6145
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:34,470
why does it have to suck obviously
there's competition here why doesn't the

6146
01:48:34,470 --> 01:48:34,480
there's competition here why doesn't the
 

6147
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:36,030
there's competition here why doesn't the
best website win what's the explanation

6148
01:48:36,030 --> 01:48:36,040
best website win what's the explanation
 

6149
01:48:36,040 --> 01:48:37,510
best website win what's the explanation
of that man I thought about this for

6150
01:48:37,510 --> 01:48:37,520
of that man I thought about this for
 

6151
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:39,910
of that man I thought about this for
years so I think it's like I have to

6152
01:48:39,910 --> 01:48:39,920
years so I think it's like I have to
 

6153
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:41,709
years so I think it's like I have to
book the flight anyway like I know

6154
01:48:41,709 --> 01:48:41,719
book the flight anyway like I know
 

6155
01:48:41,719 --> 01:48:43,310
book the flight anyway like I know
there's a route that they take and I

6156
01:48:43,310 --> 01:48:43,320
there's a route that they take and I
 

6157
01:48:43,320 --> 01:48:44,790
there's a route that they take and I
need like I need to buy book for example

6158
01:48:44,790 --> 01:48:44,800
need like I need to buy book for example
 

6159
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:47,109
need like I need to buy book for example
Qatar airlines and I and I need to get

6160
01:48:47,109 --> 01:48:47,119
Qatar airlines and I and I need to get
 

6161
01:48:47,119 --> 01:48:48,510
Qatar airlines and I and I need to get
through this process

6162
01:48:48,510 --> 01:48:48,520
through this process
 

6163
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:50,910
through this process
so the the the and with a hotel is

6164
01:48:50,910 --> 01:48:50,920
so the the the and with a hotel is
 

6165
01:48:50,920 --> 01:48:53,589
so the the the and with a hotel is
similar you need a hotel anyway so so do

6166
01:48:53,589 --> 01:48:53,599
similar you need a hotel anyway so so do
 

6167
01:48:53,599 --> 01:48:55,270
similar you need a hotel anyway so so do
you have time to like figure out the

6168
01:48:55,270 --> 01:48:55,280
you have time to like figure out the
 

6169
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:57,030
you have time to like figure out the
best one not really you kind of just

6170
01:48:57,030 --> 01:48:57,040
best one not really you kind of just
 

6171
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:58,950
best one not really you kind of just
need to get the place booked and you

6172
01:48:58,950 --> 01:48:58,960
need to get the place booked and you
 

6173
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:00,990
need to get the place booked and you
know you need to get the flight and

6174
01:49:00,990 --> 01:49:01,000
know you need to get the flight and
 

6175
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:02,790
know you need to get the flight and
you'll go through the pain of this

6176
01:49:02,790 --> 01:49:02,800
you'll go through the pain of this
 

6177
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:03,990
you'll go through the pain of this
process and that's why this process

6178
01:49:03,990 --> 01:49:04,000
process and that's why this process
 

6179
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,510
process and that's why this process
always sucks so much with hotels and

6180
01:49:05,510 --> 01:49:05,520
always sucks so much with hotels and
 

6181
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:07,430
always sucks so much with hotels and
Airline websites and stuff because they

6182
01:49:07,430 --> 01:49:07,440
Airline websites and stuff because they
 

6183
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:09,550
Airline websites and stuff because they
don't have an incentive to improve it

6184
01:49:09,550 --> 01:49:09,560
don't have an incentive to improve it
 

6185
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:11,990
don't have an incentive to improve it
because generally only for like a super

6186
01:49:11,990 --> 01:49:12,000
because generally only for like a super
 

6187
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:13,669
because generally only for like a super
upper segment of the market I think like

6188
01:49:13,669 --> 01:49:13,679
upper segment of the market I think like
 

6189
01:49:13,679 --> 01:49:16,350
upper segment of the market I think like
super high luxury it affects the actual

6190
01:49:16,350 --> 01:49:16,360
super high luxury it affects the actual
 

6191
01:49:16,360 --> 01:49:18,709
super high luxury it affects the actual
booking right I don't know I think that

6192
01:49:18,709 --> 01:49:18,719
booking right I don't know I think that
 

6193
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:20,390
booking right I don't know I think that
that's a good interesting Theory I think

6194
01:49:20,390 --> 01:49:20,400
that's a good interesting Theory I think
 

6195
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:22,270
that's a good interesting Theory I think
that must be a different Theory my my

6196
01:49:22,270 --> 01:49:22,280
that must be a different Theory my my
 

6197
01:49:22,280 --> 01:49:24,709
that must be a different Theory my my
theory would would be that great

6198
01:49:24,709 --> 01:49:24,719
theory would would be that great
 

6199
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:26,470
theory would would be that great
Engineers like great software Engineers

6200
01:49:26,470 --> 01:49:26,480
Engineers like great software Engineers
 

6201
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:28,550
Engineers like great software Engineers
are not allowed to make changes yeah

6202
01:49:28,550 --> 01:49:28,560
are not allowed to make changes yeah
 

6203
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:30,109
are not allowed to make changes yeah
basically like there's some kind of

6204
01:49:30,109 --> 01:49:30,119
basically like there's some kind of
 

6205
01:49:30,119 --> 01:49:31,709
basically like there's some kind of
bureaucracy there's way too many

6206
01:49:31,709 --> 01:49:31,719
bureaucracy there's way too many
 

6207
01:49:31,719 --> 01:49:33,629
bureaucracy there's way too many
managers there's a lot of

6208
01:49:33,629 --> 01:49:33,639
managers there's a lot of
 

6209
01:49:33,639 --> 01:49:36,189
managers there's a lot of
bureaucracy and uh great Engineers show

6210
01:49:36,189 --> 01:49:36,199
bureaucracy and uh great Engineers show
 

6211
01:49:36,199 --> 01:49:37,790
bureaucracy and uh great Engineers show
up they try to work there and they

6212
01:49:37,790 --> 01:49:37,800
up they try to work there and they
 

6213
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:39,189
up they try to work there and they
they're not allowed to really make any

6214
01:49:39,189 --> 01:49:39,199
they're not allowed to really make any
 

6215
01:49:39,199 --> 01:49:40,830
they're not allowed to really make any
contributions and then they leave and so

6216
01:49:40,830 --> 01:49:40,840
contributions and then they leave and so
 

6217
01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:42,669
contributions and then they leave and so
you have a lot of mediocre software

6218
01:49:42,669 --> 01:49:42,679
you have a lot of mediocre software
 

6219
01:49:42,679 --> 01:49:43,990
you have a lot of mediocre software
Engineers they're not really interested

6220
01:49:43,990 --> 01:49:44,000
Engineers they're not really interested
 

6221
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,950
Engineers they're not really interested
in improving any of the thing and like

6222
01:49:45,950 --> 01:49:45,960
in improving any of the thing and like
 

6223
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:47,790
in improving any of the thing and like
literally they would like to improve the

6224
01:49:47,790 --> 01:49:47,800
literally they would like to improve the
 

6225
01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:49,510
literally they would like to improve the
stuff but the

6226
01:49:49,510 --> 01:49:49,520
stuff but the
 

6227
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:52,229
stuff but the
bureaucracy um of the place plus all the

6232
01:49:56,550 --> 01:49:56,560
technical people probably they don't
 

6233
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:58,589
technical people probably they don't
know much about web web dev they don't

6234

know much about web web dev they don't
 

6235
01:49:58,599 --> 01:50:01,070
know much about web web dev they don't
know much about programming so they just

6236
01:50:01,070 --> 01:50:01,080
know much about programming so they just
 

6237
01:50:01,080 --> 01:50:03,950
know much about programming so they just
don't give any respect like you have to

6238
01:50:03,950 --> 01:50:03,960
don't give any respect like you have to

give the freedom and the respect to
 

6241
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:08,830
give the freedom and the respect to
Great Engineers as they try to do great

6242
01:50:08,830 --> 01:50:08,840
Great Engineers as they try to do great
 

6243
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:11,109
Great Engineers as they try to do great
things that feels like an explanation

6244
01:50:11,109 --> 01:50:11,119
things that feels like an explanation
 

6245
01:50:11,119 --> 01:50:13,030
things that feels like an explanation
like if you were a great programmer

6246
01:50:13,030 --> 01:50:13,040
like if you were a great programmer
 

6247
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:15,430
like if you were a great programmer
would you want to work at America

6248
01:50:15,430 --> 01:50:15,440

much suffering you alleviated how
 

6265
01:50:36,679 --> 01:50:39,270
much suffering you alleviated how
much just oh you imagine all the

6266
01:50:39,270 --> 01:50:39,280
much just oh you imagine all the
 

6267
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:41,149
much just oh you imagine all the

the idea of like

6676
01:57:53,069 --> 01:57:53,079
the idea of like
 

6677
01:57:53,079 --> 01:57:55,669
the idea of like
12 startups in 12 months or

6678
01:57:55,669 --> 01:57:55,679
12 startups in 12 months or
 

6679
01:57:55,679 --> 01:57:58,790
12 startups in 12 months or
like build a project almost every day

6680
01:57:58,790 --> 01:57:58,800
like build a project almost every day
 

6681
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:01,189
like build a project almost every day
just build a thing yeah and get it to

6682
01:58:01,189 --> 01:58:01,199
just build a thing yeah and get it to
 

6683
01:58:01,199 --> 01:58:03,750
just build a thing yeah and get it to
work and finish it every single day

6684
01:58:03,750 --> 01:58:03,760
work and finish it every single day
 

6685
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:05,430
work and finish it every single day
that's a cool experiment I think that

6686
01:58:05,430 --> 01:58:05,440
that's a cool experiment I think that
 

6687
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:07,270
that's a cool experiment I think that
was the inspiration there was a girl who

6688
01:58:07,270 --> 01:58:07,280
was the inspiration there was a girl who
 

6689
01:58:07,280 --> 01:58:08,430
was the inspiration there was a girl who
did

6690
01:58:08,430 --> 01:58:08,440
did
 

6691
01:58:08,440 --> 01:58:10,950
did
160 websites in 160 days or something

6692
01:58:10,950 --> 01:58:10,960
160 websites in 160 days or something
 

6693
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:13,990
160 websites in 160 days or something
like lit mini websites yeah and uh and

6694
01:58:13,990 --> 01:58:14,000
like lit mini websites yeah and uh and
 

6695
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,149
like lit mini websites yeah and uh and
she learned to go that way so I think

6696
01:58:16,149 --> 01:58:16,159
she learned to go that way so I think
 

6697
01:58:16,159 --> 01:58:17,589
she learned to go that way so I think
it's good to set yourself challenges you

6698
01:58:17,589 --> 01:58:17,599
it's good to set yourself challenges you
 

6699
01:58:17,599 --> 01:58:20,310
it's good to set yourself challenges you
know like don't you can go to some

6700
01:58:20,310 --> 01:58:20,320
know like don't you can go to some
 

6701
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:21,589
know like don't you can go to some
coding boot camp but I don't think they

6702
01:58:21,589 --> 01:58:21,599
coding boot camp but I don't think they
 

6703
01:58:21,599 --> 01:58:23,629
coding boot camp but I don't think they
actually work I think it's better to do

6704
01:58:23,629 --> 01:58:23,639
actually work I think it's better to do
 

6705
01:58:23,639 --> 01:58:25,870
actually work I think it's better to do
like for me outto deduct like

like for me outto deduct like
 

6707
01:58:25,880 --> 01:58:27,709
like for me outto deduct like
selflearning and setting yourself like

how hard it's going to be so you should
 

6777
01:59:43,400 --> 01:59:45,629
how hard it's going to be so you should
only look like for the next thing the

6981
02:03:12,760 --> 02:03:15,390
they test your content on a small subset
like 300 people if they like it it will

like 300 people if they like it it will
 

6983
02:03:15,400 --> 02:03:17,030
like 300 people if they like it it will

gets tested to thousand people and on
and on so if the thing is good it will

6986
02:03:19,910 --> 02:03:19,920
and on so if the thing is good it will
 

6987
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:21,310
and on so if the thing is good it will
rise anyway it doesn't matter if you

6988
02:03:21,310 --> 02:03:21,320
rise anyway it doesn't matter if you
 

6989
02:03:21,320 --> 02:03:23,189
rise anyway it doesn't matter if you
have million followers or a th000

6990
02:03:23,189 --> 02:03:23,199
have million followers or a th000
 

6991
02:03:23,199 --> 02:03:25,229
have million followers or a th000
followers or 100 what's your philosophy

6992
02:03:25,229 --> 02:03:25,239
followers or 100 what's your philosophy
 

6993
02:03:25,239 --> 02:03:26,870
followers or 100 what's your philosophy
of monetizing how to make money from the

6994
02:03:26,870 --> 02:03:26,880
of monetizing how to make money from the
 

6995
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:29,270
of monetizing how to make money from the
thing you build yeah so a lot of stter

6996
02:03:29,270 --> 02:03:29,280
thing you build yeah so a lot of stter
 

6997
02:03:29,280 --> 02:03:30,870
thing you build yeah so a lot of stter
they do like free users so you could

6998
02:03:30,870 --> 02:03:30,880
they do like free users so you could
 

6999
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:32,910
they do like free users so you could
sign up and can use the app for free

7000
02:03:32,910 --> 02:03:32,920
sign up and can use the app for free
 

7001
02:03:32,920 --> 02:03:35,910
sign up and can use the app for free
which is um it never worked for me well

7002
02:03:35,910 --> 02:03:35,920
which is um it never worked for me well
 

7003
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:38,189
which is um it never worked for me well
because I I think free users generally

7004
02:03:38,189 --> 02:03:38,199
because I I think free users generally
 

7005
02:03:38,199 --> 02:03:40,830
because I I think free users generally
don't convert and I think if you have VC

7006
02:03:40,830 --> 02:03:40,840
don't convert and I think if you have VC
 

7007
02:03:40,840 --> 02:03:42,990
don't convert and I think if you have VC
funding it makes sense to get free users

7008
02:03:42,990 --> 02:03:43,000
funding it makes sense to get free users
 

7009
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:44,149
funding it makes sense to get free users
because you can spend your funding on

7010
02:03:44,149 --> 02:03:44,159
because you can spend your funding on
 

7011
02:03:44,159 --> 02:03:45,430
because you can spend your funding on
ads and you can get like millions of

7012
02:03:45,430 --> 02:03:45,440
ads and you can get like millions of
 

7013
02:03:45,440 --> 02:03:47,510
ads and you can get like millions of
people com in predictably how much they

7014
02:03:47,510 --> 02:03:47,520
people com in predictably how much they
 

7015
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:50,350
people com in predictably how much they
convert and give them like a free trial

7016
02:03:50,350 --> 02:03:50,360
convert and give them like a free trial
 

7017
02:03:50,360 --> 02:03:52,149
convert and give them like a free trial
whatever and then they sign up but you

7018
02:03:52,149 --> 02:03:52,159
whatever and then they sign up but you
 

7019
02:03:52,159 --> 02:03:53,790
whatever and then they sign up but you
need to have that flow worked out so

7020
02:03:53,790 --> 02:03:53,800
need to have that flow worked out so
 

7021
02:03:53,800 --> 02:03:55,470
need to have that flow worked out so
well for you to to make it work that you

7022
02:03:55,470 --> 02:03:55,480
well for you to to make it work that you
 

7023
02:03:55,480 --> 02:03:57,430
well for you to to make it work that you
need like it's very difficult I think

7024
02:03:57,430 --> 02:03:57,440
need like it's very difficult I think
 

7025
02:03:57,440 --> 02:03:59,830
need like it's very difficult I think
it's best to start and just um start

7026
02:03:59,830 --> 02:03:59,840

um rate the thing based on how well

7464
02:11:52,750 --> 02:11:52,760
um rate the thing based on how well
 

7465
02:11:52,760 --> 02:11:55,069
um rate the thing based on how well
thought out it is and how well argued it

7466
02:11:55,069 --> 02:11:55,079
thought out it is and how well argued it
 

7467
02:11:55,079 --> 02:11:58,310
thought out it is and how well argued it
is yeah that that seems more doable that

7475
02:12:02,920 --> 02:12:04,669
less about the truth and it's more about
the rigor of the thing exactly and you

7476
02:12:04,669 --> 02:12:04,679
the rigor of the thing exactly and you
 

7477
02:12:04,679 --> 02:12:06,549
the rigor of the thing exactly and you
can ask that you can ask in the prompt

7478
02:12:06,549 --> 02:12:06,559
can ask that you can ask in the prompt
 

7479
02:12:06,559 --> 02:12:08,430
can ask that you can ask in the prompt
like I don't know like for example do

it's done it sends a tweet out on the

7634
02:14:51,030 --> 02:14:51,040
it's done it sends a tweet out on the
 

7635
02:14:51,040 --> 02:14:53,030
it's done it sends a tweet out on the
nist account there's a Meetup here it

7636
02:14:53,030 --> 02:14:53,040
nist account there's a Meetup here it
 

7637
02:14:53,040 --> 02:14:54,430
nist account there's a Meetup here it
sends a direct message to everybody in

7638
02:14:54,430 --> 02:14:54,440
sends a direct message to everybody in
 

7639
02:14:54,440 --> 02:14:56,470
sends a direct message to everybody in
the city who are there who are going to

7640
02:14:56,470 --> 02:14:56,480
the city who are there who are going to
 

7641
02:14:56,480 --> 02:14:58,310
the city who are there who are going to
be there and then people show up on a

7642
02:14:58,310 --> 02:14:58,320
be there and then people show up on a
 

7643
02:14:58,320 --> 02:14:59,589
be there and then people show up on a
bar and there's a Meetup and that's

7644
02:14:59,589 --> 02:14:59,599
bar and there's a Meetup and that's
 

7645
02:14:59,599 --> 02:15:02,430
bar and there's a Meetup and that's
fully automated and for me it's like

7646
02:15:02,430 --> 02:15:02,440
fully automated and for me it's like
 

7647
02:15:02,440 --> 02:15:04,310
fully automated and for me it's like
it's not it's so obvious to make this

7648
02:15:04,310 --> 02:15:04,320
it's not it's so obvious to make this
 

7649
02:15:04,320 --> 02:15:06,350
it's not it's so obvious to make this
automatic why would you why would you

7650
02:15:06,350 --> 02:15:06,360
automatic why would you why would you
 

7651
02:15:06,360 --> 02:15:09,069
automatic why would you why would you
have somebody organize this like um it

7652
02:15:09,069 --> 02:15:09,079
have somebody organize this like um it
 

7653
02:15:09,079 --> 02:15:10,430
have somebody organize this like um it
makes more sense to automate it and this

7654
02:15:10,430 --> 02:15:10,440
makes more sense to automate it and this
 

7655
02:15:10,440 --> 02:15:12,149
makes more sense to automate it and this
with most of my things like I figure out

7656
02:15:12,149 --> 02:15:12,159
with most of my things like I figure out
 

7657
02:15:12,159 --> 02:15:14,990
with most of my things like I figure out
like how to do it with code and I think

7658
02:15:14,990 --> 02:15:15,000
like how to do it with code and I think
 

7659
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:16,430
like how to do it with code and I think
especially now with AI like you can

7660
02:15:16,430 --> 02:15:16,440
especially now with AI like you can
 

7661
02:15:16,440 --> 02:15:18,589
especially now with AI like you can
automate so much more stuff than before

7662
02:15:18,589 --> 02:15:18,599
automate so much more stuff than before
 

7663
02:15:18,599 --> 02:15:20,990
automate so much more stuff than before
because AI understands things so well

7664
02:15:20,990 --> 02:15:21,000
because AI understands things so well
 

7665
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:22,470
because AI understands things so well
like before I would use if statements

7666
02:15:22,470 --> 02:15:22,480
like before I would use if statements
 

7667
02:15:22,480 --> 02:15:24,189
like before I would use if statements
right now you ask GPT you put something

7668
02:15:24,189 --> 02:15:24,199
right now you ask GPT you put something
 

7669
02:15:24,199 --> 02:15:26,750
right now you ask GPT you put something
in GPT for and in the API and it sends

7670
02:15:26,750 --> 02:15:26,760
in GPT for and in the API and it sends
 

7671
02:15:26,760 --> 02:15:29,310
in GPT for and in the API and it sends
back like this is good this is bad yeah

7672
02:15:29,310 --> 02:15:29,320
back like this is good this is bad yeah
 

7673
02:15:29,320 --> 02:15:32,390
back like this is good this is bad yeah
so you basically can now even uh

7674
02:15:32,390 --> 02:15:32,400
so you basically can now even uh
 

7675
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:34,870
so you basically can now even uh
automate sort of subjective type of

7676
02:15:34,870 --> 02:15:34,880
automate sort of subjective type of
 

7677
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:36,549
automate sort of subjective type of
things this is the difference now and

7678
02:15:36,549 --> 02:15:36,559
things this is the difference now and
 

7679
02:15:36,559 --> 02:15:39,189
things this is the difference now and
that's very recent right but it's still

7680
02:15:39,189 --> 02:15:39,199
that's very recent right but it's still
 

7681
02:15:39,199 --> 02:15:40,510
that's very recent right but it's still
difficult to I mean that step of

7682
02:15:40,510 --> 02:15:40,520
difficult to I mean that step of
 

7683
02:15:40,520 --> 02:15:42,589
difficult to I mean that step of
automation is difficult

7684
02:15:42,589 --> 02:15:42,599
automation is difficult
 

7685
02:15:42,599 --> 02:15:46,109
automation is difficult
to figure out how to is you're basically

7686
02:15:46,109 --> 02:15:46,119
to figure out how to is you're basically
 

7687
02:15:46,119 --> 02:15:48,270
to figure out how to is you're basically
delegating everything to code and it's

7688
02:15:48,270 --> 02:15:48,280
delegating everything to code and it's
 

7689
02:15:48,280 --> 02:15:50,510
delegating everything to code and it's
not trivial to take that step for a lot

7690
02:15:50,510 --> 02:15:50,520
not trivial to take that step for a lot
 

7691
02:15:50,520 --> 02:15:51,629
not trivial to take that step for a lot
of people

7692
02:15:51,629 --> 02:15:51,639
of people
 

7693
02:15:51,639 --> 02:15:53,709
of people
So when you say automate are you are you

7694
02:15:53,709 --> 02:15:53,719
So when you say automate are you are you
 

7695
02:15:53,719 --> 02:15:56,750
So when you say automate are you are you
talking about like Crown jobs Yes Man a

7696
02:15:56,750 --> 02:15:56,760
talking about like Crown jobs Yes Man a
 

7697
02:15:56,760 --> 02:15:58,830
talking about like Crown jobs Yes Man a
lot of crown jobs a lot of crown jobs

7698
02:15:58,830 --> 02:15:58,840
lot of crown jobs a lot of crown jobs
 

7699
02:15:58,840 --> 02:16:01,950
lot of crown jobs a lot of crown jobs
it's like uh I literally I log into the

7700
02:16:01,950 --> 02:16:01,960
it's like uh I literally I log into the
 

7701
02:16:01,960 --> 02:16:04,709
it's like uh I literally I log into the
server and I do like pseudo Chron tab d

7702
02:16:04,709 --> 02:16:04,719
server and I do like pseudo Chron tab d
 

7703
02:16:04,719 --> 02:16:06,390
server and I do like pseudo Chron tab d
e and then I go into the editor and I

7704
02:16:06,390 --> 02:16:06,400
e and then I go into the editor and I
 

7705
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:09,030
e and then I go into the editor and I
write like hourly and then I write

7706
02:16:09,030 --> 02:16:09,040
write like hourly and then I write
 

7707
02:16:09,040 --> 02:16:12,990
write like hourly and then I write
PHP uh you know do this thing. PHP and

7708
02:16:12,990 --> 02:16:13,000
PHP uh you know do this thing. PHP and
 

7709
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:14,830
PHP uh you know do this thing. PHP and
that's a script and that script does a

7710
02:16:14,830 --> 02:16:14,840
that's a script and that script does a
 

7711
02:16:14,840 --> 02:16:17,350
that's a script and that script does a
thing and it does it then hourly that's

7712
02:16:17,350 --> 02:16:17,360
thing and it does it then hourly that's
 

7713
02:16:17,360 --> 02:16:19,149
thing and it does it then hourly that's
it and that's how all my websites work

7714
02:16:19,149 --> 02:16:19,159
it and that's how all my websites work
 

7715
02:16:19,159 --> 02:16:20,910
it and that's how all my websites work
do you have a thing where it like emails

7716
02:16:20,910 --> 02:16:20,920
do you have a thing where it like emails
 

7717
02:16:20,920 --> 02:16:22,149
do you have a thing where it like emails
emils you or something like this or

7718
02:16:22,149 --> 02:16:22,159
emils you or something like this or
 

7719
02:16:22,159 --> 02:16:23,669
emils you or something like this or
email somebody managing the thing if

7720
02:16:23,669 --> 02:16:23,679
email somebody managing the thing if
 

7721
02:16:23,679 --> 02:16:25,709
email somebody managing the thing if
something goes wrong I have these web

7722
02:16:25,709 --> 02:16:25,719
something goes wrong I have these web
 

7723
02:16:25,719 --> 02:16:27,310
something goes wrong I have these web
pages I make they're called like health

7724
02:16:27,310 --> 02:16:27,320
pages I make they're called like health
 

7725
02:16:27,320 --> 02:16:30,030
pages I make they're called like health
checks so like Health check. PHP and

7726
02:16:30,030 --> 02:16:30,040
checks so like Health check. PHP and
 

7727
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:32,549
checks so like Health check. PHP and
then it has like emojis like a has like

7728
02:16:32,549 --> 02:16:32,559
then it has like emojis like a has like
 

7729
02:16:32,559 --> 02:16:34,190
then it has like emojis like a has like
a green check mark if it's good and a

7730
02:16:34,190 --> 02:16:34,200
a green check mark if it's good and a
 

7731
02:16:34,200 --> 02:16:36,389
a green check mark if it's good and a
red one if it's bad and then it does

7732
02:16:36,389 --> 02:16:36,399
red one if it's bad and then it does
 

7733
02:16:36,399 --> 02:16:37,910
red one if it's bad and then it does
like database curious for example like

7734
02:16:37,910 --> 02:16:37,920
like database curious for example like
 

7735
02:16:37,920 --> 02:16:39,830
like database curious for example like
what's the internet speed in for example

7736
02:16:39,830 --> 02:16:39,840
what's the internet speed in for example
 

7737
02:16:39,840 --> 02:16:42,629
what's the internet speed in for example
um Amsterdam MH okay it's a number it's

7738
02:16:42,629 --> 02:16:42,639
um Amsterdam MH okay it's a number it's
 

7739
02:16:42,639 --> 02:16:44,549
um Amsterdam MH okay it's a number it's
like 27 point megabit so it's accurate

7740
02:16:44,549 --> 02:16:44,559
like 27 point megabit so it's accurate
 

7741
02:16:44,559 --> 02:16:46,629
like 27 point megabit so it's accurate
number okay check good and it goes to

7742
02:16:46,629 --> 02:16:46,639
number okay check good and it goes to
 

7743
02:16:46,639 --> 02:16:48,190
number okay check good and it goes to
the next and it goes on all the data

7744
02:16:48,190 --> 02:16:48,200
the next and it goes on all the data
 

7745
02:16:48,200 --> 02:16:50,629
the next and it goes on all the data
points did people sign up in the last 24

7746
02:16:50,629 --> 02:16:50,639
points did people sign up in the last 24
 

7747
02:16:50,639 --> 02:16:52,150
points did people sign up in the last 24
hours it's important because maybe the

7748
02:16:52,150 --> 02:16:52,160
hours it's important because maybe the
 

7749
02:16:52,160 --> 02:16:53,990
hours it's important because maybe the
sign up broke okay check somebody sign

7750
02:16:53,990 --> 02:16:54,000
sign up broke okay check somebody sign
 

7751
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,950
sign up broke okay check somebody sign
up then I have um uptime robot.com which

7752
02:16:56,950 --> 02:16:56,960
up then I have um uptime robot.com which
 

7753
02:16:56,960 --> 02:16:58,549
up then I have um uptime robot.com which
is like for uptime but it can also check

7754
02:16:58,549 --> 02:16:58,559
is like for uptime but it can also check
 

7755
02:16:58,559 --> 02:17:01,150
is like for uptime but it can also check
keywords it checks for an emoji which is

7756
02:17:01,150 --> 02:17:01,160
keywords it checks for an emoji which is
 

7757
02:17:01,160 --> 02:17:03,830
keywords it checks for an emoji which is
like the Red X which is if something is

7758
02:17:03,830 --> 02:17:03,840
like the Red X which is if something is
 

7759
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:06,110
like the Red X which is if something is
bad and so it opens that health check

7760
02:17:06,110 --> 02:17:06,120
bad and so it opens that health check
 

7761
02:17:06,120 --> 02:17:07,990
bad and so it opens that health check
page every minute to check if something

7762
02:17:07,990 --> 02:17:08,000
page every minute to check if something
 

7763
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,030
page every minute to check if something
is bad then if it's bad it sends a

7764
02:17:10,030 --> 02:17:10,040
is bad then if it's bad it sends a
 

7765
02:17:10,040 --> 02:17:12,270
is bad then if it's bad it sends a
message to me on telegram saying hey

7766
02:17:12,270 --> 02:17:12,280
message to me on telegram saying hey
 

7767
02:17:12,280 --> 02:17:13,830
message to me on telegram saying hey
what's up uh it doesn't say hey what's

7768
02:17:13,830 --> 02:17:13,840
what's up uh it doesn't say hey what's
 

7769
02:17:13,840 --> 02:17:16,629
what's up uh it doesn't say hey what's
up it sends me like alert like this

7770
02:17:16,629 --> 02:17:16,639
up it sends me like alert like this
 

7771
02:17:16,639 --> 02:17:18,150
up it sends me like alert like this
thing is down and then I check so within

7772
02:17:18,150 --> 02:17:18,160
thing is down and then I check so within
 

7773
02:17:18,160 --> 02:17:21,110
thing is down and then I check so within
a minute of something breaking I know it

7774
02:17:21,110 --> 02:17:21,120
a minute of something breaking I know it
 

7775
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:23,070
a minute of something breaking I know it
and then I can open my laptop and fix it

7776
02:17:23,070 --> 02:17:23,080
and then I can open my laptop and fix it
 

7777
02:17:23,080 --> 02:17:24,669
and then I can open my laptop and fix it
yeah but the good thing is like the last

7778
02:17:24,669 --> 02:17:24,679
yeah but the good thing is like the last
 

7779
02:17:24,679 --> 02:17:27,950
yeah but the good thing is like the last
few years things don't break anymore and

7780
02:17:27,950 --> 02:17:27,960
few years things don't break anymore and
 

7781
02:17:27,960 --> 02:17:29,150
few years things don't break anymore and
like definitely 10 years ago when I

7782
02:17:29,150 --> 02:17:29,160
like definitely 10 years ago when I
 

7783
02:17:29,160 --> 02:17:30,549
like definitely 10 years ago when I

8239
02:25:42,040 --> 02:25:44,269
to lower because you're already so
invested so it's like a negotiation

8240
02:25:44,269 --> 02:25:44,279
invested so it's like a negotiation
 

8241
02:25:44,279 --> 02:25:46,190
invested so it's like a negotiation
tactic right I'm like no then I don't

8242
02:25:46,190 --> 02:25:46,200
tactic right I'm like no then I don't
 

8243
02:25:46,200 --> 02:25:47,990
tactic right I'm like no then I don't
want to sell right and the problem with

8244
02:25:47,990 --> 02:25:48,000
want to sell right and the problem with
 

8245
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,309
want to sell right and the problem with
my companies is like they make you know

8246
02:25:50,309 --> 02:25:50,319
my companies is like they make you know
 

8247
02:25:50,319 --> 02:25:53,990
my companies is like they make you know
90% profit margin so the multiple they

8248
02:25:53,990 --> 02:25:54,000
90% profit margin so the multiple they
 

8249
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:55,469
90% profit margin so the multiple they
companies get sold with multiples kind

8250
02:25:55,469 --> 02:25:55,479
companies get sold with multiples kind
 

8251
02:25:55,479 --> 02:25:58,269
companies get sold with multiples kind
of multiples of profit or revenue and

8252
02:25:58,269 --> 02:25:58,279
of multiples of profit or revenue and
 

8253
02:25:58,279 --> 02:25:59,790
of multiples of profit or revenue and
often the multiples like three times

8254
02:25:59,790 --> 02:25:59,800
often the multiples like three times
 

8255
02:25:59,800 --> 02:26:01,870
often the multiples like three times
three times or four times or five times

8256
02:26:01,870 --> 02:26:01,880
three times or four times or five times
 

8257
02:26:01,880 --> 02:26:05,269
three times or four times or five times
revenue or profit so in my case they're

8258
02:26:05,269 --> 02:26:05,279
revenue or profit so in my case they're
 

8259
02:26:05,279 --> 02:26:07,030
revenue or profit so in my case they're
all automated so I might as as well wait

8260
02:26:07,030 --> 02:26:07,040
all automated so I might as as well wait
 

8261
02:26:07,040 --> 02:26:09,469
all automated so I might as as well wait
three years and I get the same money as

8262
02:26:09,469 --> 02:26:09,479
three years and I get the same money as
 

8263
02:26:09,479 --> 02:26:11,070
three years and I get the same money as
when I sell and then I can still sell

8264
02:26:11,070 --> 02:26:11,080
when I sell and then I can still sell
 

8265
02:26:11,080 --> 02:26:12,710
when I sell and then I can still sell
the same company you know what I mean I

8266
02:26:12,710 --> 02:26:12,720
the same company you know what I mean I
 

8267
02:26:12,720 --> 02:26:15,190
the same company you know what I mean I
can still sell for three five times so

8268
02:26:15,190 --> 02:26:15,200
can still sell for three five times so
 

8269
02:26:15,200 --> 02:26:16,950
can still sell for three five times so
financially it doesn't really make sense

8270
02:26:16,950 --> 02:26:16,960
financially it doesn't really make sense
 

8271
02:26:16,960 --> 02:26:19,590
financially it doesn't really make sense
to sell yeah unless the price high

8272
02:26:19,590 --> 02:26:19,600
to sell yeah unless the price high
 

8273
02:26:19,600 --> 02:26:21,389
to sell yeah unless the price high
enough like if the gets to like six or

8274
02:26:21,389 --> 02:26:21,399
enough like if the gets to like six or
 

8275
02:26:21,399 --> 02:26:23,110
enough like if the gets to like six or
seven or eight I don't want to wait six

8276
02:26:23,110 --> 02:26:23,120
seven or eight I don't want to wait six
 

8277
02:26:23,120 --> 02:26:24,670
seven or eight I don't want to wait six
years for the money you know but if you

8278
02:26:24,670 --> 02:26:24,680
years for the money you know but if you
 

8279
02:26:24,680 --> 02:26:26,429
years for the money you know but if you

like I can wait so I mean the really

8282
02:26:29,750 --> 02:26:29,760
like I can wait so I mean the really
 

8283
02:26:29,760 --> 02:26:31,830
like I can wait so I mean the really
valuable stuff about the companies you

8284
02:26:31,830 --> 02:26:31,840
valuable stuff about the companies you
 

8285
02:26:31,840 --> 02:26:34,150
valuable stuff about the companies you
created is not just the interface and

8286
02:26:34,150 --> 02:26:34,160
created is not just the interface and
 

8287
02:26:34,160 --> 02:26:36,670
created is not just the interface and
the and the crowdsource content but the

8288
02:26:36,670 --> 02:26:36,680
the and the crowdsource content but the
 

8289
02:26:36,680 --> 02:26:39,269
the and the crowdsource content but the
people themselves like the user base

8290
02:26:39,269 --> 02:26:39,279
people themselves like the user base
 

8291
02:26:39,279 --> 02:26:41,550
people themselves like the user base
yeah but nor list it's a community yeah

8292
02:26:41,550 --> 02:26:41,560
yeah but nor list it's a community yeah
 

8293
02:26:41,560 --> 02:26:43,110
yeah but nor list it's a community yeah
so I could see that being extremely

8294
02:26:43,110 --> 02:26:43,120
so I could see that being extremely
 

8295
02:26:43,120 --> 02:26:44,870
so I could see that being extremely
valuable I'm surprised but normally this

8296
02:26:44,870 --> 02:26:44,880
valuable I'm surprised but normally this
 

8297
02:26:44,880 --> 02:26:46,150
valuable I'm surprised but normally this

to make the world get better if you

8318
02:27:03,389 --> 02:27:03,399
to make the world get better if you
 

8319
02:27:03,399 --> 02:27:04,750
to make the world get better if you
learn if you go to China and live in

8320

learn if you go to China and live in
 

8321
02:27:04,760 --> 02:27:06,750

retire you know I think retirement is
bad probably so you usually build the

8366
02:27:53,349 --> 02:27:53,359
bad probably so you usually build the
 

8367
02:27:53,359 --> 02:27:55,710
bad probably so you usually build the
stuff solo and mostly work

8368
02:27:55,710 --> 02:27:55,720
stuff solo and mostly work
 

8369
02:27:55,720 --> 02:27:58,790
stuff solo and mostly work
solo what's the thinking behind that I

that place have a conversation about

8556
02:31:13,950 --> 02:31:13,960
that place have a conversation about
 

8557
02:31:13,960 --> 02:31:15,429
that place have a conversation about
what is the better approach yeah but

8558
02:31:15,429 --> 02:31:15,439
what is the better approach yeah but
 

8559
02:31:15,439 --> 02:31:17,710
what is the better approach yeah but
those are the top tier developers yeah

8560
02:31:17,710 --> 02:31:17,720
those are the top tier developers yeah
 

8561
02:31:17,720 --> 02:31:19,630
those are the top tier developers yeah
and they those are the ones that are

8562
02:31:19,630 --> 02:31:19,640
and they those are the ones that are
 

8563
02:31:19,640 --> 02:31:22,150
and they those are the ones that are
Tech ambiguous so they can work with

8564
02:31:22,150 --> 02:31:22,160
Tech ambiguous so they can work with
 

8565
02:31:22,160 --> 02:31:23,750
Tech ambiguous so they can work with
they can learn any teex Tech and they

8566
02:31:23,750 --> 02:31:23,760
they can learn any teex Tech and they
 

8567
02:31:23,760 --> 02:31:25,790
they can learn any teex Tech and they
can and that's like really few like it's

8568
02:31:25,790 --> 02:31:25,800
can and that's like really few like it's
 

8569
02:31:25,800 --> 02:31:28,510
can and that's like really few like it's
like top 5% cuz if you try hire deps

8570
02:31:28,510 --> 02:31:28,520
like top 5% cuz if you try hire deps
 

8571
02:31:28,520 --> 02:31:29,950
like top 5% cuz if you try hire deps
like no offense to devs but most devs

8572
02:31:29,950 --> 02:31:29,960
like no offense to devs but most devs
 

8573
02:31:29,960 --> 02:31:32,190
like no offense to devs but most devs
are not man most people in general jobs

8574
02:31:32,190 --> 02:31:32,200
are not man most people in general jobs
 

8575
02:31:32,200 --> 02:31:34,110
are not man most people in general jobs
are not so good at their job like even

8576
02:31:34,110 --> 02:31:34,120
are not so good at their job like even
 

8577
02:31:34,120 --> 02:31:36,590
are not so good at their job like even
doctors and stuff when you realize this

8578
02:31:36,590 --> 02:31:36,600
doctors and stuff when you realize this
 

8579
02:31:36,600 --> 02:31:38,630
doctors and stuff when you realize this
people are very average at the job

8580
02:31:38,630 --> 02:31:38,640
people are very average at the job
 

8581
02:31:38,640 --> 02:31:40,469
people are very average at the job
especially with death with coding I

8582
02:31:40,469 --> 02:31:40,479
especially with death with coding I
 

8583
02:31:40,479 --> 02:31:42,429
especially with death with coding I
think so sorry I think that's a really

8584
02:31:42,429 --> 02:31:42,439
think so sorry I think that's a really
 

8585
02:31:42,439 --> 02:31:44,190
think so sorry I think that's a really
important skill for for developer to

8586
02:31:44,190 --> 02:31:44,200
important skill for for developer to
 

8587
02:31:44,200 --> 02:31:46,510
important skill for for developer to
roll in and like understand the

8588
02:31:46,510 --> 02:31:46,520
roll in and like understand the
 

8589
02:31:46,520 --> 02:31:49,510
roll in and like understand the
musicality the the style of and like

musicality the the style of and like
 

8591
02:31:49,520 --> 02:31:51,190
musicality the the style of and like
empathy it's like code empathy right

8592
02:31:51,190 --> 02:31:51,200
empathy it's like code empathy right
 

8593
02:31:51,200 --> 02:31:52,990
empathy it's like code empathy right
code empathy yeah it's a new word but

8594
02:31:52,990 --> 02:31:53,000
code empathy yeah it's a new word but
 

8595
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,429
code empathy yeah it's a new word but
that's it you need to understand like go

8596
02:31:55,429 --> 02:31:55,439
that's it you need to understand like go
 

8597
02:31:55,439 --> 02:31:56,950
that's it you need to understand like go
over all the code get a holistic view of

8598
02:31:56,950 --> 02:31:56,960
over all the code get a holistic view of
 

8599
02:31:56,960 --> 02:31:59,870
over all the code get a holistic view of
it and man you can suggest we we change

8600
02:31:59,870 --> 02:31:59,880
it and man you can suggest we we change
 

8601
02:31:59,880 --> 02:32:03,110
it and man you can suggest we we change
stuff for sure but um and look jur is

8602
02:32:03,110 --> 02:32:03,120
stuff for sure but um and look jur is
 

8603
02:32:03,120 --> 02:32:05,030
stuff for sure but um and look jur is
crazy it's crazy I'm using J Cur we can

8604
02:32:05,030 --> 02:32:05,040
crazy it's crazy I'm using J Cur we can
 

8605
02:32:05,040 --> 02:32:07,309
crazy it's crazy I'm using J Cur we can
change that it's not crazy at all jQuery

8606
02:32:07,309 --> 02:32:07,319
change that it's not crazy at all jQuery
 

8607
02:32:07,319 --> 02:32:09,150
change that it's not crazy at all jQuery
is also like beautiful and powerful and

8608
02:32:09,150 --> 02:32:09,160
is also like beautiful and powerful and
 

8609
02:32:09,160 --> 02:32:11,269
is also like beautiful and powerful and
PHP is beautiful and Powerful especially

8613
02:32:13,439 --> 02:32:17,550
as you said recently in the in the in
the as the versions evolved it's much

8614
02:32:17,550 --> 02:32:17,560
the as the versions evolved it's much
 

8615
02:32:17,560 --> 02:32:19,190
the as the versions evolved it's much
more serious programming language now

8616
02:32:19,190 --> 02:32:19,200
more serious programming language now
 

8617
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:20,469
more serious programming language now
it's super

8618
02:32:20,469 --> 02:32:20,479
it's super
 

8619
02:32:20,479 --> 02:32:23,870
it's super
like PHP is really fast now it's cat

8620
02:32:23,870 --> 02:32:23,880
like PHP is really fast now it's cat
 

8621
02:32:23,880 --> 02:32:27,230
like PHP is really fast now it's cat
JavaScript much Ruby really fast now so

8622
02:32:27,230 --> 02:32:27,240
JavaScript much Ruby really fast now so
 

8623
02:32:27,240 --> 02:32:28,590
JavaScript much Ruby really fast now so
if speed is something you care about

8624
02:32:28,590 --> 02:32:28,600
if speed is something you care about
 

8625
02:32:28,600 --> 02:32:30,870
if speed is something you care about
it's super fast um and like there's

8626
02:32:30,870 --> 02:32:30,880
it's super fast um and like there's
 

8627
02:32:30,880 --> 02:32:32,630
it's super fast um and like there's
gigantic communities of people using

8628
02:32:32,630 --> 02:32:32,640
gigantic communities of people using
 

8629
02:32:32,640 --> 02:32:34,070
gigantic communities of people using
those programming languages and there's

8630
02:32:34,070 --> 02:32:34,080
those programming languages and there's
 

8631
02:32:34,080 --> 02:32:35,710
those programming languages and there's
Frameworks if you like the framework so

8632
02:32:35,710 --> 02:32:35,720
Frameworks if you like the framework so
 

8633
02:32:35,720 --> 02:32:37,150

02:36:40,950 --> 02:36:40,960
to like H round is probably the better
 

8851
02:36:40,960 --> 02:36:42,750
to like H round is probably the better
way but if you wanted to be rectangular

8852
02:36:42,750 --> 02:36:42,760
way but if you wanted to be rectangular
 

8853
02:36:42,760 --> 02:36:44,750
way but if you wanted to be rectangular

command F and I search border radius
 

8859
02:36:50,760 --> 02:36:52,950
command F and I search border radius
12px and then I replace with border

8860

12px and then I replace with border
 

8861
02:36:52,960 --> 02:36:56,190
12px and then I replace with border
radius zero and then I do command enter

8862
02:36:56,190 --> 02:36:56,200
radius zero and then I do command enter
 

8863
02:36:56,200 --> 02:36:58,830
radius zero and then I do command enter
and it's G deploys it it pushes to the

GitHub GitHub sends a web to my server

8902
02:37:41,070 --> 02:37:41,080
GitHub GitHub sends a web to my server
 

8903
02:37:41,080 --> 02:37:43,590
GitHub GitHub sends a web to my server
web server pulls it deploys the

8904
02:37:43,590 --> 02:37:43,600
web server pulls it deploys the
 

8905
02:37:43,600 --> 02:37:45,190
web server pulls it deploys the
production and it's there what's the

8906
02:37:45,190 --> 02:37:45,200
production and it's there what's the
 

8907
02:37:45,200 --> 02:37:47,630
production and it's there what's the
latency of that from you pressing one

8908
02:37:47,630 --> 02:37:47,640
latency of that from you pressing one
 

8909
02:37:47,640 --> 02:37:50,230
latency of that from you pressing one
second can be one two seconds to make a

8910
02:37:50,230 --> 02:37:50,240
second can be one two seconds to make a
 

8911
02:37:50,240 --> 02:37:51,790
second can be one two seconds to make a
change and then you're getting really

8912
02:37:51,790 --> 02:37:51,800
change and then you're getting really
 

8913
02:37:51,800 --> 02:37:53,190
change and then you're getting really
good at like not making mistakes

8914
02:37:53,190 --> 02:37:53,200
good at like not making mistakes
 

8915
02:37:53,200 --> 02:37:54,469
good at like not making mistakes
basically man 100% you're right like

8916

8919
02:37:55,520 --> 02:37:56,750
people are like how can you do this why
you get good at not taking the server

8920

you get good at not taking the server
 

8921
02:37:56,760 --> 02:37:58,429
you get good at not taking the server
down you know like because you need to

8922

down you know like because you need to
 

8923
02:37:58,439 --> 02:38:01,590
down you know like because you need to
code more carefully but it's look it's

8924
02:38:01,590 --> 02:38:01,600
code more carefully but it's look it's
 

8925

code more carefully but it's look it's
idiotic in any big company but for me it

where there's a a phase of like testing
 

8959
02:38:37,560 --> 02:38:39,349
where there's a a phase of like testing
and there's the staging and there's a

02:44:42,279 --> 02:44:43,950
again was so good times and you would
design everything like now I'm going to

9300
02:44:43,950 --> 02:44:43,960
design everything like now I'm going to
 

9301
02:44:43,960 --> 02:44:45,269
design everything like now I'm going to
install it properly now I'm going to

9302
02:44:45,269 --> 02:44:45,279
install it properly now I'm going to
 

9303
02:44:45,279 --> 02:44:47,070
install it properly now I'm going to
design my desktop properly you know like

9304
02:44:47,070 --> 02:44:47,080
design my desktop properly you know like
 

9305
02:44:47,080 --> 02:44:48,309
design my desktop properly you know like
yeah I don't know if it's peer pressure

9306
02:44:48,309 --> 02:44:48,319
yeah I don't know if it's peer pressure
 

9307
02:44:48,319 --> 02:44:51,150
yeah I don't know if it's peer pressure
but like I use zMAX for many many years

9308
02:44:51,150 --> 02:44:51,160
but like I use zMAX for many many years
 

9309
02:44:51,160 --> 02:44:53,190
but like I use zMAX for many many years
and I know you know I love lisp so a lot

9310
02:44:53,190 --> 02:44:53,200
and I know you know I love lisp so a lot
 

9311
02:44:53,200 --> 02:44:54,030
and I know you know I love lisp so a lot
of the

9312
02:44:54,030 --> 02:44:54,040
of the
 

9313
02:44:54,040 --> 02:44:56,190
of the
customization is done in lisp it's a

9314
02:44:56,190 --> 02:44:56,200
customization is done in lisp it's a
 

9315
02:44:56,200 --> 02:44:57,910
customization is done in lisp it's a
programming language it partially was

9316
02:44:57,910 --> 02:44:57,920
programming language it partially was
 

9317
02:44:57,920 --> 02:45:00,070
programming language it partially was
peer pressure but part of was realizing

9318
02:45:00,070 --> 02:45:00,080
peer pressure but part of was realizing
 

9319
02:45:00,080 --> 02:45:02,550
peer pressure but part of was realizing
like you need to keep learning stuff

9320
02:45:02,550 --> 02:45:02,560
like you need to keep learning stuff
 

9321
02:45:02,560 --> 02:45:05,550
like you need to keep learning stuff
like the same issue with jQuery like I

9322
02:45:05,550 --> 02:45:05,560
like the same issue with jQuery like I
 

9323
02:45:05,560 --> 02:45:07,349
like the same issue with jQuery like I
still think I need to learn node.js for

9324
02:45:07,349 --> 02:45:07,359
still think I need to learn node.js for
 

9325
02:45:07,359 --> 02:45:09,790
still think I need to learn node.js for
example yeah even though that's not my

9326
02:45:09,790 --> 02:45:09,800
example yeah even though that's not my
 

9327
02:45:09,800 --> 02:45:11,309
example yeah even though that's not my
main thing or even close to the main

9328
02:45:11,309 --> 02:45:11,319
main thing or even close to the main
 

9329
02:45:11,319 --> 02:45:13,150
main thing or even close to the main
thing but I feel like you need to keep

9330
02:45:13,150 --> 02:45:13,160
thing but I feel like you need to keep
 

9331
02:45:13,160 --> 02:45:14,790
thing but I feel like you need to keep
learning this

9332
02:45:14,790 --> 02:45:14,800
learning this
 

9333
02:45:14,800 --> 02:45:17,469
learning this
stuff and even if you don't choose to

9334
02:45:17,469 --> 02:45:17,479
stuff and even if you don't choose to
 

9335
02:45:17,479 --> 02:45:20,110
stuff and even if you don't choose to
use it long term you need to give it a

9336
02:45:20,110 --> 02:45:20,120
use it long term you need to give it a
 

9337
02:45:20,120 --> 02:45:22,790
use it long term you need to give it a
chance so you your understanding of the

9338
02:45:22,790 --> 02:45:22,800
chance so you your understanding of the
 

9339
02:45:22,800 --> 02:45:24,670
chance so you your understanding of the
world expands yeah you want to

9340
02:45:24,670 --> 02:45:24,680
world expands yeah you want to
 

9341
02:45:24,680 --> 02:45:25,630
world expands yeah you want to
understand the new technological

9342
02:45:25,630 --> 02:45:25,640
understand the new technological
 

9343
02:45:25,640 --> 02:45:28,030
understand the new technological
Concepts and see if they can benefit you

9344
02:45:28,030 --> 02:45:28,040
Concepts and see if they can benefit you
 

9345
02:45:28,040 --> 02:45:29,269
Concepts and see if they can benefit you
you know it would be stupid not to even

9346
02:45:29,269 --> 02:45:29,279
you know it would be stupid not to even
 

9347
02:45:29,279 --> 02:45:31,309
you know it would be stupid not to even
try it's more about the concepts I would

9348
02:45:31,309 --> 02:45:31,319
try it's more about the concepts I would
 

9349
02:45:31,319 --> 02:45:34,590
try it's more about the concepts I would
say than the actual tools like expanding

9350
02:45:34,590 --> 02:45:34,600
say than the actual tools like expanding
 

9351
02:45:34,600 --> 02:45:35,990
say than the actual tools like expanding
and that can be a challenging thing so

9352
02:45:35,990 --> 02:45:36,000
and that can be a challenging thing so
 

9353
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:37,429
and that can be a challenging thing so
going to VSS code and like really

9354
02:45:37,429 --> 02:45:37,439
going to VSS code and like really
 

9355
02:45:37,439 --> 02:45:39,030
going to VSS code and like really
learning it like all the shortcuts all

9356
02:45:39,030 --> 02:45:39,040
learning it like all the shortcuts all
 

9357
02:45:39,040 --> 02:45:40,550
learning it like all the shortcuts all
the extensions and actually installing

9358
02:45:40,550 --> 02:45:40,560
the extensions and actually installing
 

9359
02:45:40,560 --> 02:45:42,950
the extensions and actually installing
different stuff and playing with it that

9360
02:45:42,950 --> 02:45:42,960
different stuff and playing with it that
 

9361
02:45:42,960 --> 02:45:44,790
different stuff and playing with it that
was a interesting challenge it was

9362
02:45:44,790 --> 02:45:44,800
was a interesting challenge it was
 

9363
02:45:44,800 --> 02:45:46,790
was a interesting challenge it was
uncomfortable at first yeah for me too

9364
02:45:46,790 --> 02:45:46,800
uncomfortable at first yeah for me too
 

9365
02:45:46,800 --> 02:45:48,670
uncomfortable at first yeah for me too
yeah yeah but you just dive in it's like

9366
02:45:48,670 --> 02:45:48,680
yeah yeah but you just dive in it's like
 

9367
02:45:48,680 --> 02:45:50,429
yeah yeah but you just dive in it's like
neur Flex like you keep your brain fresh

9368
02:45:50,429 --> 02:45:50,439
neur Flex like you keep your brain fresh
 

9369
02:45:50,439 --> 02:45:52,190
neur Flex like you keep your brain fresh
you know like this kind of stuff I got

9370
02:45:52,190 --> 02:45:52,200
you know like this kind of stuff I got
 

9371
02:45:52,200 --> 02:45:53,990
you know like this kind of stuff I got
to do that more like have you given

9372
02:45:53,990 --> 02:45:54,000
to do that more like have you given
 

9373
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:57,150
to do that more like have you given
react a chance no but I I want to I want

9374
02:45:57,150 --> 02:45:57,160
react a chance no but I I want to I want
 

9375
02:45:57,160 --> 02:45:58,910
react a chance no but I I want to I want
to learn I want to I I understand the

9376
02:45:58,910 --> 02:45:58,920
to learn I want to I I understand the
 

9377
02:45:58,920 --> 02:46:00,630
to learn I want to I I understand the
basics right

9378
02:46:00,630 --> 02:46:00,640
basics right
 

9379
02:46:00,640 --> 02:46:03,389
basics right
um I don't really know where to start

9380
02:46:03,389 --> 02:46:03,399
um I don't really know where to start
 

9381
02:46:03,399 --> 02:46:05,469
um I don't really know where to start
but would you like I guess you got to

9382
02:46:05,469 --> 02:46:05,479
but would you like I guess you got to
 

9383
02:46:05,479 --> 02:46:07,830
but would you like I guess you got to
use your own model which is like build

9384
02:46:07,830 --> 02:46:07,840
use your own model which is like build
 

9385
02:46:07,840 --> 02:46:10,590
use your own model which is like build
the thing using it no man you're so I

9386
02:46:10,590 --> 02:46:10,600
the thing using it no man you're so I
 

9387
02:46:10,600 --> 02:46:12,190
the thing using it no man you're so I
kind of did that like I kind like the

9388
02:46:12,190 --> 02:46:12,200
kind of did that like I kind like the
 

9389
02:46:12,200 --> 02:46:14,590
kind of did that like I kind like the
the the stuff I do in Jer is essentially

9390
02:46:14,590 --> 02:46:14,600
the the stuff I do in Jer is essentially
 

9391
02:46:14,600 --> 02:46:18,070
the the stuff I do in Jer is essentially
a lot of it is like I start rebuilding

9392
02:46:18,070 --> 02:46:18,080
a lot of it is like I start rebuilding
 

9393
02:46:18,080 --> 02:46:20,150
a lot of it is like I start rebuilding
whatever Tech is already out there not

9394
02:46:20,150 --> 02:46:20,160
whatever Tech is already out there not
 

9395
02:46:20,160 --> 02:46:21,910
whatever Tech is already out there not
based on that but just an accident like

9396
02:46:21,910 --> 02:46:21,920
based on that but just an accident like
 

9397
02:46:21,920 --> 02:46:23,230
based on that but just an accident like
I keep goinging long enough that I built

9398
02:46:23,230 --> 02:46:23,240
I keep goinging long enough that I built
 

9399
02:46:23,240 --> 02:46:24,630
I keep goinging long enough that I built
the same I start getting the same

9400
02:46:24,630 --> 02:46:24,640
the same I start getting the same
 

9401
02:46:24,640 --> 02:46:26,190
the same I start getting the same
problems everybody else had and you

9402
02:46:26,190 --> 02:46:26,200
problems everybody else had and you
 

9403
02:46:26,200 --> 02:46:27,389
problems everybody else had and you
start building the same Frameworks kind

9404
02:46:27,389 --> 02:46:27,399
start building the same Frameworks kind
 

9405
02:46:27,399 --> 02:46:29,110
start building the same Frameworks kind
of so I essentially I use my own kind of

9406
02:46:29,110 --> 02:46:29,120
of so I essentially I use my own kind of
 

9407
02:46:29,120 --> 02:46:30,510
of so I essentially I use my own kind of
framework of so you basically build a

9408
02:46:30,510 --> 02:46:30,520
framework of so you basically build a
 

9409
02:46:30,520 --> 02:46:32,110
framework of so you basically build a
framework from scratch that's your own

9410
02:46:32,110 --> 02:46:32,120
framework from scratch that's your own
 

9411
02:46:32,120 --> 02:46:33,510
framework from scratch that's your own
that you understand it kind of yeah with

9412
02:46:33,510 --> 02:46:33,520
that you understand it kind of yeah with
 

9413
02:46:33,520 --> 02:46:35,510
that you understand it kind of yeah with
ax calls but essentially it's same same

9414
02:46:35,510 --> 02:46:35,520
ax calls but essentially it's same same
 

9415
02:46:35,520 --> 02:46:37,190
ax calls but essentially it's same same
thing look I don't have the time I don't

9416
02:46:37,190 --> 02:46:37,200
thing look I don't have the time I don't
 

9417
02:46:37,200 --> 02:46:39,389
thing look I don't have the time I don't
and this is I think saying you don't

9418
02:46:39,389 --> 02:46:39,399
and this is I think saying you don't
 

9419
02:46:39,399 --> 02:46:40,910
and this is I think saying you don't
have the time is like always a lie

9420
02:46:40,910 --> 02:46:40,920
have the time is like always a lie
 

9421
02:46:40,920 --> 02:46:42,710
have the time is like always a lie
because you just don't prioritize it

9422
02:46:42,710 --> 02:46:42,720
because you just don't prioritize it
 

9423
02:46:42,720 --> 02:46:45,230
because you just don't prioritize it
enough my priority is still like the the

9424
02:46:45,230 --> 02:46:45,240
enough my priority is still like the the
 

9425
02:46:45,240 --> 02:46:46,550
enough my priority is still like the the
running the businesses and improving

9426
02:46:46,550 --> 02:46:46,560
running the businesses and improving
 

9427
02:46:46,560 --> 02:46:48,349
running the businesses and improving
that and and AI I think learning AI is

9428
02:46:48,349 --> 02:46:48,359
that and and AI I think learning AI is
 

9429
02:46:48,359 --> 02:46:50,630
that and and AI I think learning AI is
much more Val out and learning uh a

9430
02:46:50,630 --> 02:46:50,640
much more Val out and learning uh a
 

9431
02:46:50,640 --> 02:46:52,750
much more Val out and learning uh a
front end framework yeah like it's just

9432
02:46:52,750 --> 02:46:52,760
front end framework yeah like it's just
 

9433
02:46:52,760 --> 02:46:55,150
front end framework yeah like it's just
more impact I guess you should be just

9434
02:46:55,150 --> 02:46:55,160
more impact I guess you should be just
 

9435
02:46:55,160 --> 02:46:58,710
more impact I guess you should be just
learning every single day a thing yeah

9436
02:46:58,710 --> 02:46:58,720
learning every single day a thing yeah
 

9437
02:46:58,720 --> 02:46:59,870
learning every single day a thing yeah
you can learn a little bit every day

9438
02:46:59,870 --> 02:46:59,880
you can learn a little bit every day
 

9439
02:46:59,880 --> 02:47:01,910
you can learn a little bit every day
like a little bit of react or I think

9440
02:47:01,910 --> 02:47:01,920
like a little bit of react or I think
 

9441
02:47:01,920 --> 02:47:03,830
like a little bit of react or I think
now like next is very big so learn a

9442
02:47:03,830 --> 02:47:03,840
now like next is very big so learn a
 

9443
02:47:03,840 --> 02:47:06,269
now like next is very big so learn a
little bit of next you know but I I call

9444
02:47:06,269 --> 02:47:06,279
little bit of next you know but I I call
 

9445
02:47:06,279 --> 02:47:07,790
little bit of next you know but I I call
them the military industrial complex so

9446
02:47:07,790 --> 02:47:07,800
them the military industrial complex so
 

9447
02:47:07,800 --> 02:47:10,030
them the military industrial complex so
if I but you need to know you need to

9448
02:47:10,030 --> 02:47:10,040
if I but you need to know you need to
 

9449
02:47:10,040 --> 02:47:12,349
if I but you need to know you need to
know it anyway so you got to learn how

9450
02:47:12,349 --> 02:47:12,359
know it anyway so you got to learn how
 

9451
02:47:12,359 --> 02:47:14,389
know it anyway so you got to learn how
to use the weapons of war and then and

9452
02:47:14,389 --> 02:47:14,399
to use the weapons of war and then and
 

9453
02:47:14,399 --> 02:47:16,670
to use the weapons of war and then and
then you can be a peace neck yeah yeah I

9454
02:47:16,670 --> 02:47:16,680
then you can be a peace neck yeah yeah I
 

9455
02:47:16,680 --> 02:47:19,790
then you can be a peace neck yeah yeah I
mean but you got to learn in in in the

9456
02:47:19,790 --> 02:47:19,800
mean but you got to learn in in in the
 

9457
02:47:19,800 --> 02:47:21,550
mean but you got to learn in in in the
same exact ways we were talking about

9458
02:47:21,550 --> 02:47:21,560
same exact ways we were talking about
 

9459
02:47:21,560 --> 02:47:23,389
same exact ways we were talking about
which is learning by trying to build

9460
02:47:23,389 --> 02:47:23,399
which is learning by trying to build
 

9461
02:47:23,399 --> 02:47:25,429
which is learning by trying to build
something with it and actually deploy it

9462
02:47:25,429 --> 02:47:25,439
something with it and actually deploy it
 

9463
02:47:25,439 --> 02:47:27,150
something with it and actually deploy it
the Frameworks are so complicated and it

9464
02:47:27,150 --> 02:47:27,160
the Frameworks are so complicated and it
 

9465
02:47:27,160 --> 02:47:29,870
the Frameworks are so complicated and it
changes so fast so it's like where do I

9466
02:47:29,870 --> 02:47:29,880
changes so fast so it's like where do I
 

9467
02:47:29,880 --> 02:47:31,429
changes so fast so it's like where do I
start you know and I guess it's the same

9468
02:47:31,429 --> 02:47:31,439
start you know and I guess it's the same
 

9469
02:47:31,439 --> 02:47:32,389
start you know and I guess it's the same
thing when you're starting out making

9470
02:47:32,389 --> 02:47:32,399
thing when you're starting out making
 

9471
02:47:32,399 --> 02:47:34,750
thing when you're starting out making
websites like how where do you start as

9472
02:47:34,750 --> 02:47:34,760
websites like how where do you start as
 

9473
02:47:34,760 --> 02:47:38,510
websites like how where do you start as
gp4 I guess but it yeah it's just so

9474
02:47:38,510 --> 02:47:38,520
gp4 I guess but it yeah it's just so
 

9475
02:47:38,520 --> 02:47:40,030
gp4 I guess but it yeah it's just so
Dynamic it changes so fast that I don't

9476
02:47:40,030 --> 02:47:40,040
Dynamic it changes so fast that I don't
 

9477
02:47:40,040 --> 02:47:41,510
Dynamic it changes so fast that I don't
know if it would be a good idea for me

9478
02:47:41,510 --> 02:47:41,520
know if it would be a good idea for me
 

9479
02:47:41,520 --> 02:47:43,990
know if it would be a good idea for me
to learn it you know um maybe some

9480
02:47:43,990 --> 02:47:44,000
to learn it you know um maybe some
 

9481
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:47,469
to learn it you know um maybe some
combination of like few next with PHP

9482
02:47:47,469 --> 02:47:47,479
combination of like few next with PHP
 

9483
02:47:47,479 --> 02:47:49,510
combination of like few next with PHP
laravel laravel is like a framework for

9484
02:47:49,510 --> 02:47:49,520
laravel laravel is like a framework for
 

9485
02:47:49,520 --> 02:47:52,790
laravel laravel is like a framework for
PHP I think that would be uh it could

9486
02:47:52,790 --> 02:47:52,800
PHP I think that would be uh it could
 

9487
02:47:52,800 --> 02:47:54,590
PHP I think that would be uh it could
benefit me you know maybe Tailwind for

9488
02:47:54,590 --> 02:47:54,600
benefit me you know maybe Tailwind for
 

9489
02:47:54,600 --> 02:47:57,190
benefit me you know maybe Tailwind for
CS like a styling engine that that stuff

9490
02:47:57,190 --> 02:47:57,200
CS like a styling engine that that stuff
 

9491
02:47:57,200 --> 02:47:59,150
CS like a styling engine that that stuff
could probably save me time yeah but

9492
02:47:59,150 --> 02:47:59,160
could probably save me time yeah but
 

9493
02:47:59,160 --> 02:48:00,910
could probably save me time yeah but
like you you won't know until you really

9494
02:48:00,910 --> 02:48:00,920
like you you won't know until you really
 

9495
02:48:00,920 --> 02:48:02,469
like you you won't know until you really
give it a try and it feels like you have

9496
02:48:02,469 --> 02:48:02,479
give it a try and it feels like you have
 

9497
02:48:02,479 --> 02:48:05,030
give it a try and it feels like you have
to build like if maybe I'm talking to

9498
02:48:05,030 --> 02:48:05,040
to build like if maybe I'm talking to
 

9499
02:48:05,040 --> 02:48:07,190
to build like if maybe I'm talking to
myself but like I I should

9500
02:48:07,190 --> 02:48:07,200
myself but like I I should
 

9501
02:48:07,200 --> 02:48:10,670
myself but like I I should
probably recode like my personal one

9502
02:48:10,670 --> 02:48:10,680
probably recode like my personal one
 

9503
02:48:10,680 --> 02:48:14,790
probably recode like my personal one
page in laral or yeah and even though it

9504
02:48:14,790 --> 02:48:14,800
page in laral or yeah and even though it
 

9505
02:48:14,800 --> 02:48:16,429
page in laral or yeah and even though it
might not have almost any Dynamic

9506
02:48:16,429 --> 02:48:16,439
might not have almost any Dynamic
 

9507
02:48:16,439 --> 02:48:18,469
might not have almost any Dynamic
elements maybe have one Dynamic element

9508
02:48:18,469 --> 02:48:18,479
elements maybe have one Dynamic element
 

9509
02:48:18,479 --> 02:48:21,030
elements maybe have one Dynamic element
but it has to go end to end in that

9510
02:48:21,030 --> 02:48:21,040
but it has to go end to end in that
 

9511
02:48:21,040 --> 02:48:23,389
but it has to go end to end in that
framework or like end to end build it in

9512
02:48:23,389 --> 02:48:23,399
framework or like end to end build it in
 

9513
02:48:23,399 --> 02:48:26,550
framework or like end to end build it in
node.js some of it is I don't figuring

9514
02:48:26,550 --> 02:48:26,560
node.js some of it is I don't figuring
 

9515
02:48:26,560 --> 02:48:28,510
node.js some of it is I don't figuring
out how to you even deploy the thing

9516
02:48:28,510 --> 02:48:28,520
out how to you even deploy the thing
 

9517
02:48:28,520 --> 02:48:30,389
out how to you even deploy the thing
have no idea all I know is right now I

9518
02:48:30,389 --> 02:48:30,399
have no idea all I know is right now I
 

9519
02:48:30,399 --> 02:48:31,950
have no idea all I know is right now I
would send it to GitHub and it sends it

9520
02:48:31,950 --> 02:48:31,960
would send it to GitHub and it sends it
 

9521
02:48:31,960 --> 02:48:33,510
would send it to GitHub and it sends it
to my server I don't know how to get

9522
02:48:33,510 --> 02:48:33,520
to my server I don't know how to get
 

9523
02:48:33,520 --> 02:48:36,110
to my server I don't know how to get
JavaScript running I have no clue yeah

9524
02:48:36,110 --> 02:48:36,120
JavaScript running I have no clue yeah
 

9525
02:48:36,120 --> 02:48:39,790
JavaScript running I have no clue yeah
so I guess I need like a a pass like a

9526
02:48:39,790 --> 02:48:39,800
so I guess I need like a a pass like a
 

9527
02:48:39,800 --> 02:48:42,950
so I guess I need like a a pass like a
like versal right or uh you know Heroku

9528
02:48:42,950 --> 02:48:42,960
like versal right or uh you know Heroku
 

9529
02:48:42,960 --> 02:48:44,550
like versal right or uh you know Heroku
kind of those kind of platforms I

9530
02:48:44,550 --> 02:48:44,560
kind of those kind of platforms I
 

9531
02:48:44,560 --> 02:48:46,670
kind of those kind of platforms I
actually kind of just my gave myself the

9532
02:48:46,670 --> 02:48:46,680
actually kind of just my gave myself the
 

9533
02:48:46,680 --> 02:48:49,070
actually kind of just my gave myself the
idea of like I kind of just want to

9534
02:48:49,070 --> 02:48:49,080
idea of like I kind of just want to
 

9535
02:48:49,080 --> 02:48:52,269
idea of like I kind of just want to
build a single web page like one web

9536
02:48:52,269 --> 02:48:52,279
build a single web page like one web
 

9537
02:48:52,279 --> 02:48:55,830
build a single web page like one web
page that has like one Dynamic element

9538
02:48:55,830 --> 02:48:55,840
page that has like one Dynamic element
 

9539
02:48:55,840 --> 02:48:57,910
page that has like one Dynamic element
and just do it in every single like in a

9540
02:48:57,910 --> 02:48:57,920
and just do it in every single like in a
 

9541
02:48:57,920 --> 02:49:00,070
and just do it in every single like in a
lot of Frameworks like just ah on the

9542
02:49:00,070 --> 02:49:00,080
lot of Frameworks like just ah on the
 

9543
02:49:00,080 --> 02:49:03,590
lot of Frameworks like just ah on the
same page same same page kind page

9544
02:49:03,590 --> 02:49:03,600
same page same same page kind page
 

9545
02:49:03,600 --> 02:49:05,110
same page same same page kind page
that's a cool prodct like learn all

9546
02:49:05,110 --> 02:49:05,120
that's a cool prodct like learn all
 

9547
02:49:05,120 --> 02:49:06,590
that's a cool prodct like learn all
these Frameworks and you can see the

9548
02:49:06,590 --> 02:49:06,600
these Frameworks and you can see the
 

9549
02:49:06,600 --> 02:49:08,750
these Frameworks and you can see the
differences yeah that's interesting how

9550
02:49:08,750 --> 02:49:08,760
differences yeah that's interesting how
 

9551
02:49:08,760 --> 02:49:10,830
differences yeah that's interesting how
long it takes to do it yeah stopwatch I

9552
02:49:10,830 --> 02:49:10,840
long it takes to do it yeah stopwatch I
 

9553
02:49:10,840 --> 02:49:12,790
long it takes to do it yeah stopwatch I
have to figure out actually something

9554
02:49:12,790 --> 02:49:12,800
have to figure out actually something
 

9555
02:49:12,800 --> 02:49:15,030
have to figure out actually something
sufficiently complicated because it

9556
02:49:15,030 --> 02:49:15,040
sufficiently complicated because it
 

9557
02:49:15,040 --> 02:49:17,389
sufficiently complicated because it
should probably do it should probably do

9558
02:49:17,389 --> 02:49:17,399
should probably do it should probably do
 

9559
02:49:17,399 --> 02:49:19,510
should probably do it should probably do
some kind of

9560
02:49:19,510 --> 02:49:19,520
some kind of
 

9561
02:49:19,520 --> 02:49:21,750
some kind of
thing where it accesses the database and

9562
02:49:21,750 --> 02:49:21,760
thing where it accesses the database and
 

9563
02:49:21,760 --> 02:49:23,830
thing where it accesses the database and
dynamically is changing stuff some AI

9564
02:49:23,830 --> 02:49:23,840
dynamically is changing stuff some AI
 

9565
02:49:23,840 --> 02:49:26,269
dynamically is changing stuff some AI
stuff some llm stuff yeah maybe some it

9566
02:49:26,269 --> 02:49:26,279
stuff some llm stuff yeah maybe some it
 

9567
02:49:26,279 --> 02:49:27,429
stuff some llm stuff yeah maybe some it
doesn't have to be

9568
02:49:27,429 --> 02:49:27,439
doesn't have to be
 

9569
02:49:27,439 --> 02:49:30,349
doesn't have to be
aii call Api call to something to to

9570
02:49:30,349 --> 02:49:30,359
aii call Api call to something to to
 

9571
02:49:30,359 --> 02:49:32,389
aii call Api call to something to to
replicate for example and then you have

9572
02:49:32,389 --> 02:49:32,399
replicate for example and then you have
 

9573
02:49:32,399 --> 02:49:33,950
replicate for example and then you have
yeah that would be a very cool project

9574
02:49:33,950 --> 02:49:33,960
yeah that would be a very cool project
 

9575
02:49:33,960 --> 02:49:37,150
yeah that would be a very cool project
yeah yeah and like time it and also

9576
02:49:37,150 --> 02:49:37,160
yeah yeah and like time it and also
 

9577
02:49:37,160 --> 02:49:40,229
yeah yeah and like time it and also
report on my happiness yeah I'm going to

9578
02:49:40,229 --> 02:49:40,239
report on my happiness yeah I'm going to
 

9579
02:49:40,239 --> 02:49:42,269
report on my happiness yeah I'm going to
totally do this cuz nobody benchmarks

9580
02:49:42,269 --> 02:49:42,279
totally do this cuz nobody benchmarks
 

9581
02:49:42,279 --> 02:49:43,790
totally do this cuz nobody benchmarks
this nobody's Benchmark happy developer

9582
02:49:43,790 --> 02:49:43,800
this nobody's Benchmark happy developer
 

9583
02:49:43,800 --> 02:49:45,469
this nobody's Benchmark happy developer
happiness with Frameworks yeah nobody's

9584
02:49:45,469 --> 02:49:45,479
happiness with Frameworks yeah nobody's
 

9585
02:49:45,479 --> 02:49:48,150
happiness with Frameworks yeah nobody's
benchmarked the shipping time just take

9586
02:49:48,150 --> 02:49:48,160
benchmarked the shipping time just take
 

9587
02:49:48,160 --> 02:49:50,110
benchmarked the shipping time just take
like a month do this how many Frameworks

9588
02:49:50,110 --> 02:49:50,120
like a month do this how many Frameworks
 

9589
02:49:50,120 --> 02:49:52,710
like a month do this how many Frameworks
are there there's how many how many

9590
02:49:52,710 --> 02:49:52,720
are there there's how many how many
 

9591
02:49:52,720 --> 02:49:54,790
are there there's how many how many
there there's like five main ways of

9592
02:49:54,790 --> 02:49:54,800
there there's like five main ways of
 

9593
02:49:54,800 --> 02:49:57,070
there there's like five main ways of
doing it so there's like this is no

9594
02:49:57,070 --> 02:49:57,080
doing it so there's like this is no
 

9595
02:49:57,080 --> 02:49:58,790
doing it so there's like this is no
there's back end front end and this

9596
02:49:58,790 --> 02:49:58,800
there's back end front end and this
 

9597
02:49:58,800 --> 02:50:00,429
there's back end front end and this
stuff confused me too like react now

9598
02:50:00,429 --> 02:50:00,439
stuff confused me too like react now
 

9599
02:50:00,439 --> 02:50:02,469
stuff confused me too like react now
apparently has become back end yeah or

9600
02:50:02,469 --> 02:50:02,479
apparently has become back end yeah or
 

9601
02:50:02,479 --> 02:50:04,229
apparently has become back end yeah or
something used to be only front end and

9602
02:50:04,229 --> 02:50:04,239
something used to be only front end and
 

9603
02:50:04,239 --> 02:50:06,110
something used to be only front end and
you're forced to do now backend also I

9604
02:50:06,110 --> 02:50:06,120

that's the problem yeah maybe LMS can

9642
02:50:51,309 --> 02:50:51,319
that's the problem yeah maybe LMS can
 

9643
02:50:51,319 --> 02:50:53,710
that's the problem yeah maybe LMS can
help maybe you should explicitly ask

they give answers that are like the most
 

9651
02:50:58,439 --> 02:51:00,349
they give answers that are like the most
probable kind of yeah so that makes

9652
02:51:00,349 --> 02:51:00,359
probable kind of yeah so that makes

and that makes Mac a very good platform
 

9911
02:55:38,359 --> 02:55:40,349
and that makes Mac a very good platform
for Linux stuff I

9912
02:55:40,349 --> 02:55:40,359
for Linux stuff I
 

9913
02:55:40,359 --> 02:55:44,190
for Linux stuff I
think yeah yeah real Ubuntu is like

9914
02:55:44,190 --> 02:55:44,200
think yeah yeah real Ubuntu is like
 

9915
02:55:44,200 --> 02:55:47,309
think yeah yeah real Ubuntu is like
better of course but yeah I'm in this

9916
02:55:47,309 --> 02:55:47,319
better of course but yeah I'm in this
 

9917
02:55:47,319 --> 02:55:50,150
better of course but yeah I'm in this
weird situation where

9918
02:55:50,150 --> 02:55:50,160
weird situation where
 

9919
02:55:50,160 --> 02:55:53,229
weird situation where
I'm somewhat of a power user in Windows

9920
02:55:53,229 --> 02:55:53,239
I'm somewhat of a power user in Windows
 

9921
02:55:53,239 --> 02:55:57,910
I'm somewhat of a power user in Windows
and let's say Android and all the much

9922
02:55:57,910 --> 02:55:57,920
and let's say Android and all the much
 

9923
02:55:57,920 --> 02:56:01,630
and let's say Android and all the much
smarter friends I have all using Mac and

9924
02:56:01,630 --> 02:56:01,640
smarter friends I have all using Mac and
 

9925
02:56:01,640 --> 02:56:03,910
smarter friends I have all using Mac and
iPhone and it's like but you don't want

9926
02:56:03,910 --> 02:56:03,920
iPhone and it's like but you don't want
 

9927
02:56:03,920 --> 02:56:05,950
iPhone and it's like but you don't want
to go through the peer pressure you know

9928
02:56:05,950 --> 02:56:05,960
to go through the peer pressure you know
 

9929
02:56:05,960 --> 02:56:08,070
to go through the peer pressure you know
it's not peer pressure it's

9930
02:56:08,070 --> 02:56:08,080
it's not peer pressure it's
 

9931
02:56:08,080 --> 02:56:10,110
it's not peer pressure it's
like like one of the reasons I want to

9932
02:56:10,110 --> 02:56:10,120
like like one of the reasons I want to
 

9933
02:56:10,120 --> 02:56:12,510
like like one of the reasons I want to
have kids is that there's a lot of like

9934
02:56:12,510 --> 02:56:12,520
have kids is that there's a lot of like
 

9935
02:56:12,520 --> 02:56:14,550
have kids is that there's a lot of like
I I would love to have kids as a base as

9936
02:56:14,550 --> 02:56:14,560
I I would love to have kids as a base as
 

9937
02:56:14,560 --> 02:56:16,630
I I would love to have kids as a base as
a baseline but you know there's like a

9938
02:56:16,630 --> 02:56:16,640
a baseline but you know there's like a
 

9939
02:56:16,640 --> 02:56:17,870
a baseline but you know there's like a
concern maybe there's going to be a

9940
02:56:17,870 --> 02:56:17,880
concern maybe there's going to be a
 

9941
02:56:17,880 --> 02:56:19,269
concern maybe there's going to be a
tradeoff for all this kind of stuff but

9942
02:56:19,269 --> 02:56:19,279
tradeoff for all this kind of stuff but
 

9943
02:56:19,279 --> 02:56:21,309
tradeoff for all this kind of stuff but
you see like these extremely successful

9944
02:56:21,309 --> 02:56:21,319
you see like these extremely successful
 

9945
02:56:21,319 --> 02:56:23,510
you see like these extremely successful
smart people who are friends of mine who

9946
02:56:23,510 --> 02:56:23,520
smart people who are friends of mine who
 

9947
02:56:23,520 --> 02:56:25,070
smart people who are friends of mine who
have kids and are really happy they have

have kids and are really happy they have
 

9949
02:56:25,080 --> 02:56:26,990
have kids and are really happy they have
kids so that's that's not peer pressure

9950
02:56:26,990 --> 02:56:27,000
kids so that's that's not peer pressure
 

9951
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:29,389

9977
02:56:57,560 --> 02:56:59,349
really I need to give it a real chance
especially for development since more

9978
02:56:59,349 --> 02:56:59,359
especially for development since more
 

9979
02:56:59,359 --> 02:57:00,670
especially for development since more
