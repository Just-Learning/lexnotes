missiles because of what they thought
 

2505
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,670
missiles because of what they thought
was an incoming attack and I it turned

2506
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:28,680
was an incoming attack and I it turned
 

2507
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,950
was an incoming attack and I it turned
out to be a complete mistake or misread

2508
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:30,960
out to be a complete mistake or misread
 

2509
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,270
out to be a complete mistake or misread
on the radar but that's what we're

2510
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:33,280
on the radar but that's what we're
 

2511
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,150
on the radar but that's what we're
facing but by the way there's so many

2512
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:35,160
facing but by the way there's so many
 

2513
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:36,510
facing but by the way there's so many
things to say there but one of the

2514
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:36,520
things to say there but one of the
 

2515
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:39,910
things to say there but one of the
things that an Annie Jacobson details is

2516
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:39,920
things that an Annie Jacobson details is
 

2517
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,270
things that an Annie Jacobson details is
just how organized the Machinery of all

2518
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:42,280
just how organized the Machinery of all
 

2519
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:46,069
just how organized the Machinery of all
this is where the humans involved don't

2520
00:55:46,069 --> 00:55:46,079
this is where the humans involved don't
 

2521
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:49,270
this is where the humans involved don't
have to think they just follow orders

2522
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:49,280
have to think they just follow orders
 

2523
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,910
have to think they just follow orders
there's a very clear set of steps you

2524
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:51,920
there's a very clear set of steps you
 

2525
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,549
there's a very clear set of steps you
take and there there's very few places

2526
00:55:54,549 --> 00:55:54,559
take and there there's very few places
 

2527
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:55,990
take and there there's very few places
where you can inject your humanity and

2528
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:56,000
where you can inject your humanity and
 

2529
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,190
where you can inject your humanity and

00:56:00,029 --> 00:56:00,039
picture of this the only
 

2533
00:56:00,039 --> 00:56:03,910
picture of this the only
person that can think is the president

2534
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:03,920
person that can think is the president
 

2535
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,390

Tesla who does business in a lot of
countries including China and therefore

3082
01:08:22,749 --> 01:08:22,759
countries including China and therefore
 

3083
01:08:22,759 --> 01:08:25,910
countries including China and therefore
he must be investigated it is is not at

all a stretch of imagination to say that

3086
01:08:28,149 --> 01:08:28,159
all a stretch of imagination to say that
 

3087
01:08:28,159 --> 01:08:31,030
all a stretch of imagination to say that
X could be the next platform that the

3095
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,910
adversary and therefore his business

experiences and and things that I have
 

3899
01:26:36,119 --> 01:26:39,189
experiences and and things that I have
seen and learned along the way but I

3900
01:26:39,189 --> 01:26:39,199
seen and learned along the way but I
 

3901
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:41,390
seen and learned along the way but I
also point out exactly that fact in the

3902
01:26:41,390 --> 01:26:41,400
also point out exactly that fact in the
 

3903
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:42,830
also point out exactly that fact in the
book but from the from the very

3904
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:42,840
book but from the from the very
 

3905
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:45,109
book but from the from the very
beginning with the prologue is we should

3906
01:26:45,109 --> 01:26:45,119
beginning with the prologue is we should
 

3907
01:26:45,119 --> 01:26:46,870
beginning with the prologue is we should
not be naive to think that this only

3908
01:26:46,870 --> 01:26:46,880
not be naive to think that this only
 

3909
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:49,270
not be naive to think that this only
exists within the Democratic party there

3910
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:49,280
exists within the Democratic party there
 

3911
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:52,709
exists within the Democratic party there
are very serious problems within both of

01:26:52,709 --> 01:26:52,719
are very serious problems within both of
 

3913
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:56,109
are very serious problems within both of
our political parties uh specifically

3914
01:26:56,109 --> 01:26:56,119
our political parties uh specifically
 

3915
01:26:56,119 --> 01:26:59,270
our political parties uh specifically
coming from politicians who are driven

3916
01:26:59,270 --> 01:26:59,280
coming from politicians who are driven
 

3917
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:03,270
coming from politicians who are driven
by this desire for power and who are so

3918
01:27:03,270 --> 01:27:03,280
by this desire for power and who are so
 

3919
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:06,189
by this desire for power and who are so
afraid of losing that power that they're

3920
01:27:06,189 --> 01:27:06,199
afraid of losing that power that they're
 

3921
01:27:06,199 --> 01:27:07,950
afraid of losing that power that they're
willing to do whatever they feel they

3922
01:27:07,950 --> 01:27:07,960
willing to do whatever they feel they
 

3923
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:10,790
willing to do whatever they feel they
need to do which centers around taking

3924
01:27:10,790 --> 01:27:10,800
need to do which centers around taking
 

3925
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,950
need to do which centers around taking
away our freedom because the more free

3926
01:27:12,950 --> 01:27:12,960
away our freedom because the more free
 

3927
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:16,350
away our freedom because the more free
we are to make our own decisions even if

3928
01:27:16,350 --> 01:27:16,360
we are to make our own decisions even if
 

3929
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:17,790
we are to make our own decisions even if
they may end up being the wrong

3930
01:27:17,790 --> 01:27:17,800
they may end up being the wrong
 

3931
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:20,109
they may end up being the wrong
decisions but to learn from those things

3932
01:27:20,109 --> 01:27:20,119
decisions but to learn from those things
 

3933
01:27:20,119 --> 01:27:21,830
decisions but to learn from those things
and know that we've got to live with the

3934
01:27:21,830 --> 01:27:21,840
and know that we've got to live with the
 

3935
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:24,550
and know that we've got to live with the
consequences that the the beauty and

3936
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:24,560
consequences that the the beauty and
 

3937
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:26,750
consequences that the the beauty and
messiness of what a free society looks

3938
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:26,760
messiness of what a free society looks
 

3939
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:29,709
messiness of what a free society looks
like they're so afraid of us because

3940
01:27:29,709 --> 01:27:29,719
like they're so afraid of us because
 

3941
01:27:29,719 --> 01:27:32,550
like they're so afraid of us because
they see us as the people and our

3942
01:27:32,550 --> 01:27:32,560
they see us as the people and our
 

3943
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:35,109
they see us as the people and our
freedom as the central threat to their

3944
01:27:35,109 --> 01:27:35,119
freedom as the central threat to their
 

3945
01:27:35,119 --> 01:27:39,030
freedom as the central threat to their
ability to remain in power uh I think

3946
01:27:39,030 --> 01:27:39,040
ability to remain in power uh I think
 

3947
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:41,229
ability to remain in power uh I think
the difference that we're seeing

3948
01:27:41,229 --> 01:27:41,239
the difference that we're seeing
 

3949
01:27:41,239 --> 01:27:43,310
the difference that we're seeing
today is that

3950
01:27:43,310 --> 01:27:43,320
today is that
 

3951
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:45,229
today is that
unfortunately um we talked about this a

3952
01:27:45,229 --> 01:27:45,239
unfortunately um we talked about this a
 

3953
01:27:45,239 --> 01:27:47,470
unfortunately um we talked about this a
little bit how the Democratic party has

3954
