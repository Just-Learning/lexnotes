should be big not necessarily I notice
that when liberals talk about government

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,750
that when liberals talk about government

00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:22,360
opportunity as possible and also in so
 

193
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,949
opportunity as possible and also in so
far as the government should do the

194
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:25,959
far as the government should do the
 

195

certain functions particularly at the
local level so a lot of governmental

202
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:34,799
local level so a lot of governmental
 

203

discussions on a pragmatic level end up

204
00:03:36,589 --> 00:03:36,599
discussions on a pragmatic level end up
 

205
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,429
discussions on a pragmatic level end up
being discussions about where government

206
00:03:38,429 --> 00:03:38,439
being discussions about where government
 

207
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,710
being discussions about where government
ought to be involved but also at what

208
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:39,720
ought to be involved but also at what
 

209
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,710
ought to be involved but also at what
level government ought to be involved

210
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:42,720
level government ought to be involved
 

211
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,229
level government ought to be involved
and I have an incredibly subsidiary view

212
00:03:45,229 --> 00:03:45,239
and I have an incredibly subsidiary view
 

213
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,070
and I have an incredibly subsidiary view
of government I I think that you know

214
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:47,080
of government I I think that you know
 

215
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,589
of government I I think that you know
local governments because you have

216
00:03:48,589 --> 00:03:48,599
local governments because you have
 

217
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,830
local governments because you have
higher levels of homogenity and and

218
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:50,840
higher levels of homogenity and and
 

219
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,470
higher levels of homogenity and and
consent uh are capable of doing more

220
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:53,480
consent uh are capable of doing more
 

221
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,789
consent uh are capable of doing more
things and as you abstract up the chain

222
00:03:55,789 --> 00:03:55,799
things and as you abstract up the chain
 

223
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,390
things and as you abstract up the chain
it becomes more and more impractical and

224
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:57,400
it becomes more and more impractical and
 

225
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,229
it becomes more and more impractical and
more and more divisive to to do more

226
00:03:59,229 --> 00:03:59,239
more and more divisive to to do more
 

227
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,270
more and more divisive to to do more
things in in my view government is

229
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,509
things in in my view government is
basically there to preserve certain key

257
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,070
and the Constitution now that doesn't
mean by the way that you can't do more

mean by the way that you can't do more
 

259
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,749
mean by the way that you can't do more
on a governmental level again as you get

00:04:34,749 --> 00:04:34,759
on a governmental level again as you get
 

261
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,310
on a governmental level again as you get
closer to the ground which by the way is

262
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,320
closer to the ground which by the way is
 

263
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,710
closer to the ground which by the way is
also embedded in the Constitution people

also embedded in the Constitution people
 

265
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,150
also embedded in the Constitution people
forget the Constitution was originally

269
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,270
applied to the federal government not to
local and state government um but you

270
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,280
local and state government um but you
 

271
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,310
local and state government um but you
know if I going to Define conservatism

272
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:45,320
know if I going to Define conservatism
 

273
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,230
know if I going to Define conservatism
it would actually be a little broader

274
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,240
it would actually be a little broader
 

275
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,469
it would actually be a little broader
than that because I think to understand

276
00:04:47,469 --> 00:04:47,479
than that because I think to understand
 

277
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:48,909
than that because I think to understand
how people interact with government you

278
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:48,919
how people interact with government you
 

279
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:50,950
how people interact with government you
have to go to kind of core values and

280
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
have to go to kind of core values and
 

281
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,830
have to go to kind of core values and
and so for me there there are a couple

282
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:52,840
and so for me there there are a couple
 

283
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,230
and so for me there there are a couple
of premises one human beings have a

00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,240
of premises one human beings have a
 

285

sinful we have temptations and what that
 

293
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,270
sinful we have temptations and what that
means is that we have to be careful not

294
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,280
means is that we have to be careful not
 

295
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,110
means is that we have to be careful not

second the basic idea of human nature
 

309
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,430
second the basic idea of human nature
there is an idea in my view that all

310
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:22,440
there is an idea in my view that all
 

311
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,870
there is an idea in my view that all
human beings have equal value before the

00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:24,880
human beings have equal value before the
 

313
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,950
human beings have equal value before the

314
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:26,960
law I'm I'm a religious person so I'd
 

315
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,270
law I'm I'm a religious person so I'd
say equal value before God but I think

316
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:28,280
say equal value before God but I think
 

317
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,629
say equal value before God but I think
that's also sort of a key tend of

318
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:29,639
that's also sort of a key tend of
 

319
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,189
that's also sort of a key tend of

these kids are taking home iPads and
 

481
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,629
these kids are taking home iPads and
like first grade uh they've got like

482
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:13,639
like first grade uh they've got like
 

483
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:16,390
like first grade uh they've got like
huge computer labs and everything do you

484
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,400
huge computer labs and everything do you
 

485
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,230
huge computer labs and everything do you
think that there is some type of I don't

486
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:19,240
think that there is some type of I don't
 

487
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,869
think that there is some type of I don't
want to say Injustice or unfairness

00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:20,879
want to say Injustice or unfairness
 

489
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,950
want to say Injustice or unfairness
because I'm not even looking at it that

490
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:21,960
because I'm not even looking at it that
 

491
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,230
because I'm not even looking at it that
way just pragmatically that there might

492
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,240
way just pragmatically that there might
 

493
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,550
way just pragmatically that there might
be children that are in certain schools

494
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:26,560
be children that are in certain schools
 

495
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,350
be children that are in certain schools
that if they just had better funding or

496
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:28,360
that if they just had better funding or
 

497
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,110
that if they just had better funding or
more uh access to Technologies or things

498
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,120
more uh access to Technologies or things
 

499
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,389
more uh access to Technologies or things
available to them that those kids would

500
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:32,399
available to them that those kids would
 

501
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,269
available to them that those kids would
become more productive members of

502
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:34,279
become more productive members of
 

503
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,829
become more productive members of
society that with like a little bit of a

504
00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:35,839
society that with like a little bit of a
 

505
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,509
society that with like a little bit of a
help they they could actually achieve

506
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:37,519
help they they could actually achieve
 

507
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,509
help they they could actually achieve
more and do better for all of society so

508
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:39,519
more and do better for all of society so
 

509
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,029
more and do better for all of society so
I think that on the list of priorities

510
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:41,039
I think that on the list of priorities
 

511
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,709
I think that on the list of priorities
when it comes to education the

512
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:42,719
when it comes to education the
 

513
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,110
when it comes to education the
availability of technology is actually

514
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:44,120
availability of technology is actually
 

515
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,150
availability of technology is actually
fairly low on the list of priorities

516
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,160
fairly low on the list of priorities
 

517
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,110
fairly low on the list of priorities
sure the two things I've heard are food

00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:48,120
sure the two things I've heard are food
 

519
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,310
sure the two things I've heard are food
availability and I think air

520
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:49,320
availability and I think air
 

521
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,509
availability and I think air
conditioning I think are the two biggest

522
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:50,519
conditioning I think are the two biggest
 

523
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:51,829
conditioning I think are the two biggest
ones that I hear but sure well I mean

the biggest thing in terms of Education
 

527
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,870
the biggest thing in terms of Education

that we're talking about would actually
 

531
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,910
that we're talking about would actually
be two parent family house households

532
00:08:59,910 --> 00:08:59,920
be two parent family house households
 

533
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,030
be two parent family house households

sure communities that that have fathers
 

535
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,470

00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:03,480
in them is actually the number one

many studies done on this particular
 

541
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,430
many studies done on this particular
topic and the idea that that money alone

00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:09,440
topic and the idea that that money alone
 

543
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,829
topic and the idea that that money alone
that investment of resources is the top

priority in schooling is boted by the

546
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:13,480
priority in schooling is boted by the
 

547
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,230
priority in schooling is boted by the
fact that LUSD which is where I went to

548
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:15,240
fact that LUSD which is where I went to
 

549
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,030
fact that LUSD which is where I went to
school when I was younger they pour an

550
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,040
school when I was younger they pour an
 

551
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,870
school when I was younger they pour an
enormous amount of money into La USD

552
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:18,880
enormous amount of money into La USD
 

553
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,750
enormous amount of money into La USD
we're talking about tens of thousands of

554
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:20,760
we're talking about tens of thousands of
 

555
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,630
we're talking about tens of thousands of
dollars very often per student and it

556
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:22,640
dollars very often per student and it
 

557
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,949
dollars very often per student and it
does not result in better schooling

558
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:24,959
does not result in better schooling
 

559
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,190
does not result in better schooling
outcomes and so when you say if we could

560
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:28,200
outcomes and so when you say if we could
 

561
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,670
outcomes and so when you say if we could
give every kid an iPad would you give

562
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:29,680
give every kid an iPad would you give
 

563
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,430
give every kid an iPad would you give
every kid an iPad the question is not if

564
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:32,440
every kid an iPad the question is not if
 

565
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,710
every kid an iPad the question is not if
I had a replicator machine from Star

566
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:33,720
I had a replicator machine from Star
 

567
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,150
I had a replicator machine from Star
Trek would I give everybody an enormous

568
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:35,160
Trek would I give everybody an enormous
 

569
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,829
Trek would I give everybody an enormous
amount of stuff sure I I would every

570
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:36,839
amount of stuff sure I I would every
 

571
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:38,430
amount of stuff sure I I would every
every resource is f it every resource is

572
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:38,440
every resource is f it every resource is
 

573
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,910
every resource is f it every resource is
limited you have to prioritize what are

574
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:40,920
limited you have to prioritize what are
 

575
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,990
limited you have to prioritize what are
the what are the outcomes that you seek

576
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,000
the what are the outcomes that you seek
 

577
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,910
the what are the outcomes that you seek
in terms of the means with which you are

578
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:45,920
in terms of the means with which you are
 

579
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,069
in terms of the means with which you are
seeking them and so again I think that

580
00:09:49,069 --> 00:09:49,079
seeking them and so again I think that
 

581
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:51,190
seeking them and so again I think that
the question is is I I quibble with the

582
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,200
the question is is I I quibble with the
 

583
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,350
the question is is I I quibble with the
with the premise of the question which

584
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:52,360
with the premise of the question which
 

585
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,310
with the premise of the question which
is that again the the chief Injustice

586
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:55,320
is that again the the chief Injustice
 

587
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,630
is that again the the chief Injustice
when it comes to education on the list

588
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:56,640
when it comes to education on the list
 

589
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,230
when it comes to education on the list
of of injustices is lack of availability

590
00:09:59,230 --> 00:09:59,240
of of injustices is lack of availability
 

591
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,509
of of injustices is lack of availability
to technology or that it's a funding

592
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:01,519
to technology or that it's a funding
 

593
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,630
to technology or that it's a funding
problem I just don't think that's the

594
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:02,640
problem I just don't think that's the
 

595
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,630
problem I just don't think that's the
case sure and I can half agree with you

596
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:04,640
case sure and I can half agree with you
 

597
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,310
case sure and I can half agree with you
there but I don't think any amount of

598
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:06,320
there but I don't think any amount of
 

599
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,910
there but I don't think any amount of
changes in the schools will create two

600
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:08,920
changes in the schools will create two
 

601
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,350
changes in the schools will create two
parent households right we can't bring a

602
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:11,360
parent households right we can't bring a
 

603
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,870
parent households right we can't bring a
I totally agree with you that's why I

604
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:12,880
I totally agree with you that's why I
 

605
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,790
I totally agree with you that's why I
think that the the fundamental

606
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:13,800
think that the the fundamental
 

607
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,269
think that the the fundamental
educational problem is not in fact a

608
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:15,279
educational problem is not in fact a
 

609
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,430
educational problem is not in fact a
schooling problem I think that it

610
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:16,440
schooling problem I think that it
 

611
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,509
schooling problem I think that it
pre-exists that sure but then I feel

612
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:18,519
pre-exists that sure but then I feel
 

613
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:19,949
pre-exists that sure but then I feel
like we're now I feel like this is kind

614
00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:19,959
like we're now I feel like this is kind
 

615
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:21,630
like we're now I feel like this is kind
of the conservative marry go around

616
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:21,640
of the conservative marry go around
 

617
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,389
of the conservative marry go around
where it's like what can we do to help

618
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:23,399
where it's like what can we do to help
 

619
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,310
where it's like what can we do to help
with schools so two of the things that

620
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:25,320
with schools so two of the things that
 

621
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,670
with schools so two of the things that
I've seen I think that are usually

622
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:26,680
I've seen I think that are usually
 

623
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,150
I've seen I think that are usually
brought up in research is one is air

624
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,160
brought up in research is one is air
 

625
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,750
brought up in research is one is air
conditioning that children in hotter

626
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:29,760
conditioning that children in hotter
 

627
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,430
conditioning that children in hotter
environments just don't learn as well um

628
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:32,440
environments just don't learn as well um
 

629
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,710
environments just don't learn as well um
and then the second one is access to

630
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:33,720
and then the second one is access to
 

631
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,269
and then the second one is access to
food so like kids that are given like a

632
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:35,279
food so like kids that are given like a
 

633
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,710
food so like kids that are given like a
breakfast or a lunch that's provided at

634
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:36,720
breakfast or a lunch that's provided at
 

635
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,230
breakfast or a lunch that's provided at
school like increases educational

636
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,240
school like increases educational
 

637
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,910
school like increases educational

the topic my my topic was how to get
 

1111
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,669
the topic my my topic was how to get
more people married and what I'm s and

1112
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:14,679
more people married and what I'm s and
 

1113
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:16,470
more people married and what I'm s and
and then you suggested that higher

1114
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:16,480
and then you suggested that higher
 

1115
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,990
and then you suggested that higher
levels of Education are delaying

1116
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:18,000
levels of Education are delaying
 

1117
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,870
levels of Education are delaying
marriage and making it less probable and

1118
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:19,880
marriage and making it less probable and
 

1119
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,429
marriage and making it less probable and
what I'm telling you because this is

1120
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:21,439
what I'm telling you because this is
 

1121
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,350
what I'm telling you because this is
what the data suggests is that actually

1122
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:23,360
what the data suggests is that actually
 

1123
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,510
what the data suggests is that actually
as you raise up the the educational

1124
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:25,520
as you raise up the the educational
 

1125
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,630
as you raise up the the educational
ladder people tend to be married more

1126
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:27,640
ladder people tend to be married more
 

1127
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,669
ladder people tend to be married more
than they are lower down on the

1128
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:28,679
than they are lower down on the
 

1129
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:29,990
than they are lower down on the
educational ladder if you're a high

00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,000
educational ladder if you're a high
 

1131
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,430
educational ladder if you're a high
school graduate you're less likely to be

1132
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:31,440
school graduate you're less likely to be
 

1133
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,150
school graduate you're less likely to be
married than if you're a postdoc I agree

1134
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:34,160
married than if you're a postdoc I agree
 

1135
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,310
married than if you're a postdoc I agree
with you but that's because one of the

1136
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:35,320
with you but that's because one of the
 

1137
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,950
with you but that's because one of the
biggest precursors to getting married is

1138
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:36,960
biggest precursors to getting married is
 

1139
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,029
biggest precursors to getting married is
having like a level of economic

1140
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:38,039
having like a level of economic
 

1141
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,669
having like a level of economic
stability so as people get more educated

1142
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:39,679
stability so as people get more educated
 

1143
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,110
stability so as people get more educated
they obtain this economic stability and

1144
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,120
they obtain this economic stability and
 

1145
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,029
they obtain this economic stability and
then they're in a more comfortable

1146
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:42,039
then they're in a more comfortable
 

1147
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:42,990
then they're in a more comfortable
position to explore more serious

1148
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:43,000
position to explore more serious
 

1149
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,190
position to explore more serious
relation there's another confound there

1150
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:44,200
relation there's another confound there
 

1151
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,789
relation there's another confound there
I mean the confound is that people in

1152
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:46,799
I mean the confound is that people in
 

1153
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,270
I mean the confound is that people in
stable marriages tend to be the children

1154
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:48,280
stable marriages tend to be the children
 

1155
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,549
stable marriages tend to be the children
of stable marriages and there's only one

1156
00:17:49,549 --> 00:17:49,559
of stable marriages and there's only one
 

1157
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:50,789
of stable marriages and there's only one
way to break that cycle which is to

1158
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:50,799
way to break that cycle which is to
 

1159
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,110
way to break that cycle which is to
create a stable marriage and that is

1160
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:52,120
create a stable marriage and that is
 

1161
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,950
create a stable marriage and that is
something that is in everyone's hands

1162
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:53,960
something that is in everyone's hands
 

1163
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,669
something that is in everyone's hands
again this notion that it is somehow an

again this notion that it is somehow an

00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,870
again this notion that it is somehow an

unbreakable unshadow barrier to get

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,990
History suggests that people are never
going to get married again well I mean

1240
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:05,000
going to get married again well I mean
 

1241
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,909
going to get married again well I mean
actually what the Arc of History

1242
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:05,919
actually what the Arc of History
 

1243
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,590
actually what the Arc of History
suggests realistically speaking is that

1244
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:07,600
suggests realistically speaking is that
 

1245
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,750
suggests realistically speaking is that
the people who are not getting married

1246
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:08,760
the people who are not getting married
 

1247
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,549
the people who are not getting married
are not going to be having kids and what

1248
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:10,559
are not going to be having kids and what
 

1249
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:11,750
are not going to be having kids and what
it also suggests the people who are

1250
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:11,760
it also suggests the people who are
 

1251
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,350
it also suggests the people who are
married are going to be having kids and

1252
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:13,360
married are going to be having kids and
 

1253
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,029
married are going to be having kids and
so the demographic profile actually over

1254
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:15,039
so the demographic profile actually over
 

1255
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,830
so the demographic profile actually over
time is rather going to shift toward

1256
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:16,840
time is rather going to shift toward
 

1257
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,070
time is rather going to shift toward
people who are having lots and lots of

1258
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,080
people who are having lots and lots of
 

1259
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,510
people who are having lots and lots of
kids I'm married I have four kids

1260
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:20,520
kids I'm married I have four kids
 

1261
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,990
kids I'm married I have four kids
everyone in my community is married

1262
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,000
everyone in my community is married
 

1263
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,070
everyone in my community is married
that's like minimum buying in my

00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:23,080
that's like minimum buying in my
 

1265
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,909
that's like minimum buying in my
community is four kids okay and so

1266
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:24,919
community is four kids okay and so
 

1267
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:26,510
community is four kids okay and so
what's happening actually in terms of

1268
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:26,520
what's happening actually in terms of
 

1269
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,510
what's happening actually in terms of
demographics is that the people who are

1270
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:28,520
demographics is that the people who are
 

1271
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,909
demographics is that the people who are
more religious and getting married are

1272
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:29,919
more religious and getting married are
 

1273

more religious and getting married are
having more kids and so if you're

00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:31,360
having more kids and so if you're
 

1275
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,350

1345
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:30,830
the society me the state and I generally
don't mean the federal state I mean like

1346
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:30,840
don't mean the federal state I mean like
 

1347
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,350
don't mean the federal state I mean like
the state of California for example

1348
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:32,360
the state of California for example
 

1349
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,950
the state of California for example

1353
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,470
conditioning people will vote for air
conditioning and that's perfectly legal

1354
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:36,480
conditioning and that's perfectly legal
 

1355
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,470
conditioning and that's perfectly legal
and I don't think there's anything

morally objectionable about that per se
 

1359
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,390
morally objectionable about that per se
I also don't think that that's going to

1360
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:41,400
I also don't think that that's going to
 

1361
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,990
I also don't think that that's going to
heal anything remotely like the central

with with people who are drunk searching
under the the lamp for their keys the

1422
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:42,440
under the the lamp for their keys the
 

1423
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,350
under the the lamp for their keys the
problems they want to look at are the

1424
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:43,360
problems they want to look at are the
 

1425
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,990
problems they want to look at are the
problems that are solvable by government

1426
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:45,000
problems that are solvable by government
 

1427
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,909
problems that are solvable by government
and then all the problems they don't

1428
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:45,919
and then all the problems they don't
 

1429
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,230
and then all the problems they don't
want to look at which are the actual

00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:47,240
want to look at which are the actual
 

1431
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,269
want to look at which are the actual
giant monsters luring in the dark and

1432
00:21:49,269 --> 00:21:49,279
giant monsters luring in the dark and
 

1433
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:50,750
giant monsters luring in the dark and
not particularly solvable by government

1434
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:50,760
not particularly solvable by government
 

1435
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,950
not particularly solvable by government
are the ones they want to ignore and

1436
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:51,960
are the ones they want to ignore and
 

1437
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,430
are the ones they want to ignore and
assume are just the natural state of

1438
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:53,440
assume are just the natural state of
 

1439
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,549
assume are just the natural state of
things and I don't think that's correct

1440
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:54,559
things and I don't think that's correct
 

1441
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,269
things and I don't think that's correct
at all and I 1 billion per agree but

1442
00:21:56,269 --> 00:21:56,279
at all and I 1 billion per agree but
 

1443
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:57,310
at all and I 1 billion per agree but
then obviously my criticism for the

1444
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:57,320
then obviously my criticism for the
 

1445
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,430
then obviously my criticism for the
conservative side is the the exact

1446
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:58,440
conservative side is the the exact
 

1447
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,830
conservative side is the the exact

opposite where where there are Parts
where government could remedy some

1450
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,120
where government could remedy some
 

1451
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,230
where government could remedy some

site the wire's real life example but

1480
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:24,000
site the wire's real life example but
 

1481
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,390
site the wire's real life example but
like obviously there's only so much you

1482

not like the solution to Broken families
 

1495
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,909
not like the solution to Broken families
that would never be the case and it's

1496
00:22:36,909 --> 00:22:36,919
that would never be the case and it's
 

1497
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:39,549
that would never be the case and it's
actually not the solution to education

1498
00:22:39,549 --> 00:22:39,559
actually not the solution to education
 

1499
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:41,590
actually not the solution to education
depending on the kind of solutions that

1500
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:41,600
depending on the kind of solutions that
 

1501
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,870
depending on the kind of solutions that
you're talking about some solutions yes

1502
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:42,880
you're talking about some solutions yes
 

1503
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,510
you're talking about some solutions yes
some solutions no yeah the only thing

1504
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:44,520
some solutions no yeah the only thing
 

1505
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,909
some solutions no yeah the only thing
I'm looking at is as I said earlier just

1506
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:45,919
I'm looking at is as I said earlier just
 

1507
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,310
I'm looking at is as I said earlier just
like these minimum threshold things

1508
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:47,320
like these minimum threshold things
 

1509
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,350
like these minimum threshold things
where it's like where can government

1510
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:48,360
where it's like where can government
 

1511
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,630
where it's like where can government
make because you mentioned marginal

1512
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:49,640
make because you mentioned marginal
 

1513
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,470
make because you mentioned marginal
which I think is a really good way to

1514
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:50,480
which I think is a really good way to
 

1515
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,710
which I think is a really good way to
look at things there marginal cost and

1516
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:51,720
look at things there marginal cost and
 

1517
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,870
look at things there marginal cost and
margin utility to things where the first

1518
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:53,880
margin utility to things where the first
 

1519
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,029
margin utility to things where the first
$1,000 per student you spend might give

1520
00:22:56,029 --> 00:22:56,039
$1,000 per student you spend might give
 

1521
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:58,470
$1,000 per student you spend might give
you a huge return but the extra 20,000

1522
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:58,480
you a huge return but the extra 20,000
 

1523
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,909
you a huge return but the extra 20,000
after I think these are all pragmatic

1524
00:22:59,909 --> 00:22:59,919
after I think these are all pragmatic
 

1525
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,430
after I think these are all pragmatic
discussions actually this is what we

1526
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:01,440
discussions actually this is what we
 

1527
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,909
discussions actually this is what we
used to hash out in legislatures before

1528
00:23:02,909 --> 00:23:02,919
used to hash out in legislatures before
 

1529
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:04,430
used to hash out in legislatures before
they turned into platforms for people

1530
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:04,440
they turned into platforms for people
 

1531
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,669
they turned into platforms for people
Grand standing but yes sure okay yeah as

00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:08,400
we descend from the heavens of

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,190
we descend from the heavens of
philosophical discussion of conservatism

1536
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:10,200
philosophical discussion of conservatism
 

1537
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,310
philosophical discussion of conservatism
and liberalism let's go to the pragmatic

1538
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:12,320
and liberalism let's go to the pragmatic
 

1539
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,710
and liberalism let's go to the pragmatic
muck of

1540
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:13,720
muck of
 

1541
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,909

two of them who was in their first term

1544
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:20,360
two of them who was in their first term
 

1545
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,470
two of them who was in their first term
uh the better president and thus who

1546
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:22,480
uh the better president and thus who
 

1547
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,789
uh the better president and thus who
should win if the two of them are in

1548
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:24,799
should win if the two of them are in
 

1549
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,750
should win if the two of them are in
fact our choices should win a second

1550
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:26,760
fact our choices should win a second
 

1551
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,470
fact our choices should win a second

Ben sure so in terms of actual job

1554
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:33,559
Ben sure so in terms of actual job
 

1555
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:35,070
Ben sure so in terms of actual job
performance you have to separate it into

1556
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:35,080
performance you have to separate it into
 

1557
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,549
performance you have to separate it into
a few categories uh in terms of actual

1558
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:38,559
a few categories uh in terms of actual
 

1559
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,909
a few categories uh in terms of actual
performance in foreign policy I think

1560
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:39,919
performance in foreign policy I think
 

1561
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,269
performance in foreign policy I think
Trump's foreign policy record is

1562
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:41,279
Trump's foreign policy record is
 

1563
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,870
Trump's foreign policy record is
significantly better than Biden's the

1564
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:42,880
significantly better than Biden's the
 

1565
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,350
significantly better than Biden's the
world being on fire right now being

00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:45,360
world being on fire right now being
 

1567
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,430
world being on fire right now being
fairly good example of that uh and we

1568
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:47,440
fairly good example of that uh and we
 

1569
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,070
fairly good example of that uh and we
can get into each aspect of the world

1570
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:49,080
can get into each aspect of the world
 

1571
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,430
can get into each aspect of the world
being on fire and where the incentive

1572
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:50,440
being on fire and where the incentive
 

1573
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,950
being on fire and where the incentive
structures came from and how all of that

1574
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:51,960
structures came from and how all of that
 

1575
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,710
structures came from and how all of that
happen in a moment when it comes to the

00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:53,720
happen in a moment when it comes to the
 

1577
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,070
happen in a moment when it comes to the
economy I think that Trump's economic

1578
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:55,080
economy I think that Trump's economic
 

1579
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,110
economy I think that Trump's economic
record was better than Biden's doesn't

1580
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:57,120
record was better than Biden's doesn't
 

1581
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,390
record was better than Biden's doesn't
mean he didn't overspend he did he

1582
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:58,400
mean he didn't overspend he did he
 

1583
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,230
mean he didn't overspend he did he
wildly overspent uh but he also had a

1584
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:02,240
wildly overspent uh but he also had a
 

1585
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,149
wildly overspent uh but he also had a
very solid record of job creation a huge

1586
00:24:05,149 --> 00:24:05,159
very solid record of job creation a huge
 

1587
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:06,549
very solid record of job creation a huge
percentage of the gains in the economy

1588
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:06,559
percentage of the gains in the economy
 

1589
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,350
percentage of the gains in the economy
went to people on the lower end of the

1590
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:08,360
went to people on the lower end of the
 

1591
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,789
went to people on the lower end of the
economic spectrum actually uh the gross

1592
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:11,799
economic spectrum actually uh the gross
 

1593
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:13,390
economic spectrum actually uh the gross
income to the average American was about

1594
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:13,400
income to the average American was about
 

1595
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,990
income to the average American was about
$6,000 during his term the unemployment

1596
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,000
$6,000 during his term the unemployment
 

1597
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,230
$6,000 during his term the unemployment
rates were very very low before covid

1598
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:18,240
rates were very very low before covid
 

1599
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,430
rates were very very low before covid
you I think that you almost have to

1600
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:19,440
you I think that you almost have to
 

1601
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,630
you I think that you almost have to
separate the Trump Administration into

1602
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:20,640
separate the Trump Administration into
 

1603
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,990
separate the Trump Administration into
sort of before covid and during covid

1604
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:22,000
sort of before covid and during covid
 

1605
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,590
sort of before covid and during covid
because Co obviously is sort of a Black

1606
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:23,600
because Co obviously is sort of a Black
 

1607
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,269
because Co obviously is sort of a Black
Swan event the the most signal change in

1609
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,669
Swan event the the most signal change in
in politics In Our Lifetime uh and so

1610
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:29,679
in politics In Our Lifetime uh and so
 

1611
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,110
in politics In Our Lifetime uh and so
you know governance during Co is almost

1612
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:31,120
you know governance during Co is almost
 

1613
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,110
you know governance during Co is almost
its own category which we can discuss um

1614
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:33,120
its own category which we can discuss um
 

1615
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,389
its own category which we can discuss um
but you know in terms of foreign policy

1616
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:34,399

1617
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:35,630
but you know in terms of foreign policy
in terms of domestic policy I think that

1618
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:35,640
in terms of domestic policy I think that
 

1619
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,269
in terms of domestic policy I think that
Trump was significantly better uh than

1620
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:37,279

Trump was significantly better uh than
than Biden has been and that's on the

1622
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:39,200
than Biden has been and that's on the
 

1623
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,590
than Biden has been and that's on the
upside for Trump on the downside for

1624
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:40,600
upside for Trump on the downside for
 

1625
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,310
upside for Trump on the downside for

is ignoring human nature which is at the
beginning when you see something very

1678
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:32,480
beginning when you see something very
 

1679
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,029
beginning when you see something very
shocking it's very shocking and then if

1680
00:25:34,029 --> 00:25:34,039
shocking it's very shocking and then if
 

1681
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:35,230
shocking it's very shocking and then if
you see it over and over and over and

1682
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:35,240
you see it over and over and over and
 

1683
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,789
you see it over and over and over and
over for years on end it is no longer

1684
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:36,799
over for years on end it is no longer
 

1685
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:37,750
over for years on end it is no longer
shocking it is just part of the

1686
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:37,760
shocking it is just part of the
 

1687
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,510
shocking it is just part of the
background noise like tontis it just

1688
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:39,520
background noise like tontis it just
 

1689
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,870
background noise like tontis it just
becomes you know something that your

1690
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:40,880
becomes you know something that your
 

1691
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,110
becomes you know something that your
brain adjusts for uh and so do I like a

1692
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:44,120
brain adjusts for uh and so do I like a
 

1693
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,029

not when it comes to Biden again I think

1700
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:52,640
not when it comes to Biden again I think
 

1701
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,110
not when it comes to Biden again I think
he's underperforming economically I

1702
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:54,120
he's underperforming economically I
 

1703
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,590
he's underperforming economically I
think that his foreign policy has been

1704
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:55,600
think that his foreign policy has been
 

1705
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,110
think that his foreign policy has been
really a a problem even the things I

1706
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:58,120
really a a problem even the things I
 

1707
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,750
really a a problem even the things I
think he's done right are I think

1708
00:25:59,750 --> 00:25:59,760
think he's done right are I think
 

1709
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,630
think he's done right are I think
bandaids for things that he created by

1710
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:01,640
bandaids for things that he created by
 

1711
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,950
bandaids for things that he created by
doing wrong uh and when it comes to his

1712
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:03,960
doing wrong uh and when it comes to his
 

1713
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,710
doing wrong uh and when it comes to his
his own

1714
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:05,720
his own
 

1715
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,630
his own
rhetoric you can argue that it's grading

1716
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:07,640
rhetoric you can argue that it's grading
 

1717
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,669
rhetoric you can argue that it's grading
on a curve because Trump was coming in

1718
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:09,679
on a curve because Trump was coming in
 

1719
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,230
on a curve because Trump was coming in
with such wild rhetoric that just the

1720
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:11,240
with such wild rhetoric that just the
 

1721
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,430
with such wild rhetoric that just the
maintenance of that wild rhetoric

1722
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:12,440
maintenance of that wild rhetoric
 

1723
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,350
maintenance of that wild rhetoric
doesn't really change again the Baseline

1724
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:14,360
doesn't really change again the Baseline
 

1725
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,470
doesn't really change again the Baseline
for Biden he came in in the same way

1726
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:17,480
for Biden he came in in the same way
 

1727
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,789
for Biden he came in in the same way
that Obama did on the sort of soaring

1728
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:18,799
that Obama did on the sort of soaring
 

1729
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,350

00:36:06,109 --> 00:36:06,119
you about that though is I agree
 

2343
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:06,829
you about that though is I agree
especially when you look at the

2344
00:36:06,829 --> 00:36:06,839
especially when you look at the
 

2345
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:09,349
especially when you look at the
favorability but sometimes when I look

2346
00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:09,359
favorability but sometimes when I look
 

2347
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,309
favorability but sometimes when I look
at these polls when you start to

2348
00:36:10,309 --> 00:36:10,319
at these polls when you start to
 

2349
00:36:10,319 --> 00:36:12,309
at these polls when you start to
disaggregate them by party I wonder if

2350
00:36:12,309 --> 00:36:12,319
disaggregate them by party I wonder if
 

2351
00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:14,670
disaggregate them by party I wonder if
it's actually is Biden historically

2352

it's actually is Biden historically
 

2353
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,069
it's actually is Biden historically
divisive or um I'm trying to think of a

divisive or um I'm trying to think of a
 

2355
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:18,829
divisive or um I'm trying to think of a
really polite way to say this the people

2356
00:36:18,829 --> 00:36:18,839
really polite way to say this the people
 

2357
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:21,150
really polite way to say this the people
that like Trump worship Trump I don't

things that Trump could have probably

2362
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:23,760
things that Trump could have probably
 

2363
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,069
things that Trump could have probably
ever said was that I could kill someone

ever said was that I could kill someone
 

2365
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:27,270

is itally divisive or is it that every
 

2369
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,109

single Trump supporter will always say

2370
00:36:31,109 --> 00:36:31,119
single Trump supporter will always say
 

2371
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,069
single Trump supporter will always say
that Trump is great and the reason I

2372
00:36:33,069 --> 00:36:33,079
that Trump is great and the reason I
 

2373
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:34,309
that Trump is great and the reason I
would say that that Biden is in fact

2374
00:36:34,309 --> 00:36:34,319
would say that that Biden is in fact
 

2375
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:35,790
would say that that Biden is in fact
historically divisive is because

2376
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:35,800
historically divisive is because
 

2377
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,109
historically divisive is because
Republicans felt much more strongly

00:36:37,109 --> 00:36:37,119
Republicans felt much more strongly
 

2379
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,950
Republicans felt much more strongly
about Barack Obama than Joe Biden

2380
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:39,960
about Barack Obama than Joe Biden
 

2381
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,150
about Barack Obama than Joe Biden
actually but they didn't feel as

2382
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:41,160
actually but they didn't feel as
 

2383
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,270
actually but they didn't feel as
strongly about Trump as they did about

2384
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:42,280
strongly about Trump as they did about
 

2385
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,510
strongly about Trump as they did about
like Romney or McCain right in in what

2386
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:44,520
like Romney or McCain right in in what
 

2387
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,550
like Romney or McCain right in in what
way I mean and that the allegiance to

2388
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:46,560
way I mean and that the allegiance to
 

2389
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,589
way I mean and that the allegiance to
Trump oh no there's certainly more

2390
00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:47,599
Trump oh no there's certainly more
 

2391
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:48,790
Trump oh no there's certainly more
allegiance to Trump than it is to Romney

2392
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:48,800
allegiance to Trump than it is to Romney
 

2393
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,230
allegiance to Trump than it is to Romney
or McCain largely because Trump won in

2394
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:50,240
or McCain largely because Trump won in
 

2395
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,390
or McCain largely because Trump won in
2016 but beyond that the the point that

2396
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:53,400
2016 but beyond that the the point that
 

2397
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,349
2016 but beyond that the the point that
I'm making is that if you're looking at

2398
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:55,359
I'm making is that if you're looking at
 

2399
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,670
I'm making is that if you're looking at
the stats in terms of divisiveness

2400
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:57,680
the stats in terms of divisiveness

apart in terms of the divisive effects
of what they say right and I'm

of what they say right and I'm
 

2423
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,190

inherent content of what they say
 

2427
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,670
inherent content of what they say
because obviously what Trump says is is

2428
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:18,680
because obviously what Trump says is is
 

2429
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,230
because obviously what Trump says is is
more divisive just on like the raw level

00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:48,640
me just one quick thing I guess like
 

2465
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,990
me just one quick thing I guess like
because we can say the reality of it and

am I so that there's that I think that's
 

2497
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,309
am I so that there's that I think that's
mostly a state and local they were in

2498
00:38:19,309 --> 00:38:19,319
mostly a state and local they were in
 

2499
00:38:19,319 --> 00:38:20,950
mostly a state and local they were in
favor of mass spending for tax guns

2500
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:20,960
favor of mass spending for tax guns
 

2501
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,030
favor of mass spending for tax guns
that's not a spending I mean we I mean

2502
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:23,040
that's not a spending I mean we I mean
 

2503
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,870
that's not a spending I mean we I mean
effectively it is right like effectively

2504
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:24,880
effectively it is right like effectively

effectively it is right like effectively
it's not well if you're cutting receipts

2506
00:38:27,069 --> 00:38:27,079
it's not well if you're cutting receipts
 

2507
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:28,309
it's not well if you're cutting receipts
but you're not changing the level of

2508
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:28,319
but you're not changing the level of
 

2509
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:30,710
but you're not changing the level of
spending like Biden did with the uh Ira

2510
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:30,720
spending like Biden did with the uh Ira
 

2511
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,109
spending like Biden did with the uh Ira
again we we have a fundamental

2512
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:32,119
again we we have a fundamental
 

2513
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:33,230
again we we have a fundamental
philosophical difference here I think

2514
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:33,240
philosophical difference here I think
 

2515
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,309
philosophical difference here I think
that when when the government takes my

government somehow being more fiscally
 

2521
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,109
government somehow being more fiscally
responsible and when the government

00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:40,119
responsible and when the government
 

2523
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:41,550
responsible and when the government
allows me to keep my money I don't see

2524
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:41,560
allows me to keep my money I don't see
 

2525
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,870
allows me to keep my money I don't see
that as the government spending I see

2526
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:42,880
that as the government spending I see

I think the Republican Party itself is
 

2583
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,109
I think the Republican Party itself is
is quite divided and think that Trump

00:39:27,109 --> 00:39:27,119
is quite divided and think that Trump
 

2585
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,630
is quite divided and think that Trump
but isn't that his job he's the head of

Republican president of the United
States I mean again I don't think that

2592
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:32,400
States I mean again I don't think that
 

2593
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,589

Joe Biden has passed wildly historic

2594
00:39:35,589 --> 00:39:35,599
Joe Biden has passed wildly historic
 

2595

legislation was the largest like so here

2596
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:38,200
legislation was the largest like so here
 

2597
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:38,990
legislation was the largest like so here
here's the problem if you're a

2598
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:39,000
here's the problem if you're a
 

2599
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,069
here's the problem if you're a
republican the only bills that you can

2600
00:39:41,069 --> 00:39:41,079
republican the only bills that you can
 

2601
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:43,510
republican the only bills that you can
get consensus on tend to be bills that

2602
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:43,520
get consensus on tend to be bills that
 

2603
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,150
get consensus on tend to be bills that
either that that let's be real about

2604
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:46,160
either that that let's be real about
 

2605
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,190
either that that let's be real about
this that are tax cuts because as you

2606
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:50,200
this that are tax cuts because as you
 

2607
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,510
this that are tax cuts because as you
would I think agree with when it comes

2608
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:52,520
would I think agree with when it comes
 

2609
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,990
would I think agree with when it comes
to polling data Americans constantly say

they want to cut the government and then

2612
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:55,040
they want to cut the government and then
 

2613
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,470
they want to cut the government and then
the minute you ask them which program

2614
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:56,480
the minute you ask them which program
 

2615
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,150
the minute you ask them which program
they have no idea what right exactly and

2616
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:58,160
they have no idea what right exactly and
 

2617
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,950
they have no idea what right exactly and
so trying to it's much harder to come up

2618
00:39:59,950 --> 00:39:59,960
so trying to it's much harder to come up
 

2619
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,190
so trying to it's much harder to come up
with a bill to cut things than it is to

2620
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:02,200
with a bill to cut things than it is to
 

2621
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,109
with a bill to cut things than it is to
come up with a bill to add things coming

2622
00:40:04,109 --> 00:40:04,119
come up with a bill to add things coming
 

2623
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:05,430
come up with a bill to add things coming
which is why spending was out of control

2624
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:05,440
which is why spending was out of control
 

2625
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,190
which is why spending was out of control
under under Trump as well but there are

2626
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:07,200
under under Trump as well but there are
 

2627
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,309
under under Trump as well but there are
some Republicans who still don't want to

some Republicans who still don't want to
 

2629
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:09,790
some Republicans who still don't want to
spend on those things right so

2630
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:09,800
spend on those things right so
 

2631
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,069
spend on those things right so
inherently the the task that this goes

Republicans think government is there to

economy is heading for potential
recession so here's the thing I don't

2806
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:32,200
recession so here's the thing I don't
 

2807
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,270
recession so here's the thing I don't
think that the economy was actually

2808
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:33,280
think that the economy was actually
 

2809
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,870
think that the economy was actually
headed for recession in in fact if you

2810
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:35,880
headed for recession in in fact if you
 

2811
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,670
headed for recession in in fact if you
look at the economics Economist said

2812
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:37,680
look at the economics Economist said
 

2813
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,470
look at the economics Economist said
they it was Economist they're still

2814
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:39,480
they it was Economist they're still
 

2815
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,390
they it was Economist they're still
saying that there's like a recession

2816
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:40,400
saying that there's like a recession
 

2817
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,349
saying that there's like a recession
coming right right but that that was

2818
00:42:41,349 --> 00:42:41,359
coming right right but that that was
 

2819
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:42,750
coming right right but that that was
largely because the after effects of

2820
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:42,760
largely because the after effects of
 

2821
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,150
largely because the after effects of
inflation meaning if you inflate the

2822
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:44,160
inflation meaning if you inflate the
 

2823
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,589
inflation meaning if you inflate the
economy what you are going to end up

2824
00:42:45,589 --> 00:42:45,599
economy what you are going to end up
 

2825
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,150
economy what you are going to end up
doing is bursting a bubble and then when

2826
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:47,160
doing is bursting a bubble and then when
 

2827
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,069
doing is bursting a bubble and then when
that bubble bursts you'll get a

2828
00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:48,079
that bubble bursts you'll get a
 

2829
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:49,510
that bubble bursts you'll get a
recession I mean that was the basic idea

2830
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:49,520
recession I mean that was the basic idea
 

2831
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,750
recession I mean that was the basic idea
right the idea the question was whether

2832
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:50,760
right the idea the question was whether
 

2833
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,270
right the idea the question was whether
you're going to get the soft Landing but

2834
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:52,280
you're going to get the soft Landing but
 

2835
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,829
you're going to get the soft Landing but
if you actually look at for example the

2836
00:42:53,829 --> 00:42:53,839
if you actually look at for example the
 

2837
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,150
if you actually look at for example the
employment statistics or the economic

2838
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:55,160
employment statistics or the economic
 

2839
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,510
employment statistics or the economic
growth statistics in the unit States

2840
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:56,520
growth statistics in the unit States
 

2841
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,030
growth statistics in the unit States
what they look like under the last

2842
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:58,040
what they look like under the last
 

2843
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,270
what they look like under the last
year's Obama and then Trump I mean this

2844
00:42:59,270 --> 00:42:59,280
year's Obama and then Trump I mean this
 

2845
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,510
year's Obama and then Trump I mean this
is what the chart looks like is it looks

2846
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:00,520
is what the chart looks like is it looks
 

2847
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,750
is what the chart looks like is it looks
like this and then it hits March of 2020

2848
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:02,760
like this and then it hits March of 2020
 

2849
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,870
like this and then it hits March of 2020
it goes like that right and then by like

2850
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:04,880
it goes like that right and then by like
 

2851
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,349
it goes like that right and then by like
September it bounces back up right it's

2852
00:43:06,349 --> 00:43:06,359
September it bounces back up right it's
 

2853
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:08,069
September it bounces back up right it's
a v-shaped recovery and then it starts

2854
00:43:08,069 --> 00:43:08,079
a v-shaped recovery and then it starts
 

2855
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:09,790
a v-shaped recovery and then it starts
to Peter out sure a lot because of the

2856
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:09,800
to Peter out sure a lot because of the
 

2857
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,349
to Peter out sure a lot because of the
American Recovery plan right that Biden

2858
00:43:11,349 --> 00:43:11,359
American Recovery plan right that Biden
 

2859
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:14,630
American Recovery plan right that Biden
did as well I mean four million jobs

2860
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:14,640
did as well I mean four million jobs
 

2861
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,630
did as well I mean four million jobs
yeah no I don't I'm not going to

2862
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:15,640
yeah no I don't I'm not going to
 

2863
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,710
yeah no I don't I'm not going to
attribute it to that because this the

2864
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:16,720
attribute it to that because this the
 

2865
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,950
attribute it to that because this the
rates of growth in in job growth from

2866
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:18,960
rates of growth in in job growth from
 

2867
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,470
rates of growth in in job growth from
September October November were actually

2868
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:20,480
September October November were actually
 

2869
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,349
September October November were actually
very similar to the rates of job growth

2870
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:22,359
very similar to the rates of job growth
 

2871
00:43:22,359 --> 00:43:24,670
very similar to the rates of job growth
after Joe Biden took office what you see

2872
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:24,680
after Joe Biden took office what you see
 

2873
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,670
after Joe Biden took office what you see
is actually kind of a straight line I me

2874
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:26,680
is actually kind of a straight line I me
 

2875
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,270
is actually kind of a straight line I me
looks like in any case Okay so on the

2876
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:29,280
looks like in any case Okay so on the
 

2877
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,309
looks like in any case Okay so on the
foreign policy stuff this is getting

2878
00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:30,319
foreign policy stuff this is getting
 

2879
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:33,870
foreign policy stuff this is getting
obrus but on the foreign policy stuff um

2880
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:33,880
obrus but on the foreign policy stuff um
 

2881
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,750
obrus but on the foreign policy stuff um
so the the questions that I have with

2882
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:36,760
so the the questions that I have with
 

2883
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:40,030
so the the questions that I have with
regard to to Biden on foreign policy uh

2884
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:40,040
regard to to Biden on foreign policy uh
 

2885
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,950
regard to to Biden on foreign policy uh
very very simple question do you think

2886
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:42,960
very very simple question do you think
 

2887
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,349
very very simple question do you think
that the situation in the Middle East is

2888
00:43:44,349 --> 00:43:44,359
that the situation in the Middle East is
 

2889
00:43:44,359 --> 00:43:50,270
that the situation in the Middle East is
better now than it was under Donald

2890
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:50,280

 

2891
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,910

Trump

2892
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:51,920
Trump
 

2893
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,710
Trump
probably um that's a hard one the factor

2894
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:55,720
probably um that's a hard one the factor
 

2895
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:59,349
probably um that's a hard one the factor
that right now are like obviously you've

2896
00:43:59,349 --> 00:43:59,359
that right now are like obviously you've
 

2897
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,990
that right now are like obviously you've
got the Israel Palestinian War that's

2898
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:01,000
got the Israel Palestinian War that's
 

2899
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,549
got the Israel Palestinian War that's
going on right now which is kind of bad

2900
00:44:02,549 --> 00:44:02,559
going on right now which is kind of bad
 

2901
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:04,309
going on right now which is kind of bad
but like broadly speaking I'm not sure

2902
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:04,319
but like broadly speaking I'm not sure
 

2903
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:05,630
but like broadly speaking I'm not sure
how much that affects the Middle East as

2904
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:05,640
how much that affects the Middle East as
 

2905
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,829
how much that affects the Middle East as
much as like the collapse of Syria 2013

2906
00:44:07,829 --> 00:44:07,839
much as like the collapse of Syria 2013
 

2907
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:10,430
much as like the collapse of Syria 2013

did Syria end up as a Preserve of Russia
 

2923
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,069
did Syria end up as a Preserve of Russia
yes why did it end up being essentially

2924
00:44:26,069 --> 00:44:26,079
yes why did it end up being essentially
 

2925
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,430

cin state of Russia um I know that Putin

2926
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:28,440
cin state of Russia um I know that Putin
 

2927
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:31,349
cin state of Russia um I know that Putin
enjoys access to the ports down there um

2928
00:44:31,349 --> 00:44:31,359
enjoys access to the ports down there um
 

2929
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,870
enjoys access to the ports down there um
I don't know you I mean the reason is

2930
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:32,880
I don't know you I mean the reason is
 

2931
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,069
I don't know you I mean the reason is
because Barack Obama suggested that

2932
00:44:34,069 --> 00:44:34,079
because Barack Obama suggested that
 

2933
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:35,510
because Barack Obama suggested that
there was a red line that would be drawn

2934
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:35,520
there was a red line that would be drawn
 

2935
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,750
there was a red line that would be drawn
in the face of chemical weapons used

2936
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:36,760
in the face of chemical weapons used
 

2937
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,430
in the face of chemical weapons used
Bashar Assad then used chemical weapons

2938
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:38,440
Bashar Assad then used chemical weapons
 

2939
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,829
Bashar Assad then used chemical weapons
in Syria and Barack Obama was UN

2940
00:44:40,829 --> 00:44:40,839
in Syria and Barack Obama was UN
 

2941
00:44:40,839 --> 00:44:43,710
in Syria and Barack Obama was UN
unwilling to then essentially create

2942
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:43,720
unwilling to then essentially create
 

2943
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,230
unwilling to then essentially create
consequences for Syria in the form of

2944
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:45,240
consequences for Syria in the form of
 

2945
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,670
consequences for Syria in the form of
any sort of Western strike and so

2946
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:46,680
any sort of Western strike and so
 

2947
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,990
any sort of Western strike and so
instead he outsourced it to Russia this

2948
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:48,000
instead he outsourced it to Russia this
 

2949
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,349
instead he outsourced it to Russia this
is 2013 2014 sure think there might have

2950
00:44:50,349 --> 00:44:50,359
is 2013 2014 sure think there might have
 

2951
00:44:50,359 --> 00:44:51,790
is 2013 2014 sure think there might have
been some hesitancy after like seeing

2952
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:51,800
been some hesitancy after like seeing
 

2953
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,990
been some hesitancy after like seeing
how Libya ended up that maybe us like

2954
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:54,000
how Libya ended up that maybe us like
 

2955
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,589
how Libya ended up that maybe us like
intervening pres during Libya

2956
00:44:56,589 --> 00:44:56,599
intervening pres during Libya
 

2957
00:44:56,599 --> 00:44:58,710
intervening pres during Libya
yeah I mean sure but what does that have

2958
00:44:58,710 --> 00:44:58,720
yeah I mean sure but what does that have
 

2959
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,750
yeah I mean sure but what does that have

00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,589
Donald Trump I mean it's very difficult
to make the case that either before or

00:45:08,589 --> 00:45:08,599
to make the case that either before or
 

2973

to make the case that either before or
after Trump were better than during

Donald Trump the Syrian I don't think
 

2977
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,470
Donald Trump the Syrian I don't think
that that Trump contributed to the

2978
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:14,480
that that Trump contributed to the
 

2979
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,309
that that Trump contributed to the
Syrian situation improving much um I

00:45:48,109 --> 00:45:48,119
is originating in Syria um and uh
 

3011
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:49,549
is originating in Syria um and uh
baghdaddy and all of the growth of that

3012
00:45:49,549 --> 00:45:49,559
baghdaddy and all of the growth of that
 

3013
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:51,630
baghdaddy and all of the growth of that
is necessarily Obama's fault I know that

3014
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:51,640
is necessarily Obama's fault I know that
 

3015
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,630
is necessarily Obama's fault I know that
we like to say that Obama created Isis I

3016
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:53,640
we like to say that Obama created Isis I
 

3017
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,510
we like to say that Obama created Isis I
don't know if you say that but I've

3018
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:54,520
don't know if you say that but I've
 

3019
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,670
don't know if you say that but I've
heard that saying a lot I think that's a

3020
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:55,680
heard that saying a lot I think that's a
 

3021
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,870
heard that saying a lot I think that's a
little a little bit simplistic um I I

3022
00:45:57,870 --> 00:45:57,880
little a little bit simplistic um I I
 

3023
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,069
little a little bit simplistic um I I
don't think that when I'm looking at

3024
00:45:59,069 --> 00:45:59,079
don't think that when I'm looking at
 

3025
00:45:59,079 --> 00:46:00,630
don't think that when I'm looking at
like actions that presidents have taken

3026
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:00,640
like actions that presidents have taken
 

3027
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,549
like actions that presidents have taken
the the big the biggest criticism I have

3028
00:46:02,549 --> 00:46:02,559
the the big the biggest criticism I have
 

3029
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:04,190
the the big the biggest criticism I have
for like Middle Eastern policy is I

3030
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:04,200
for like Middle Eastern policy is I
 

3031
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,750
for like Middle Eastern policy is I
think the Doha Accords were a disaster

3032
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:05,760
think the Doha Accords were a disaster
 

3033
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,549
think the Doha Accords were a disaster
and I think that's like one of the

3034
00:46:06,549 --> 00:46:06,559
and I think that's like one of the
 

3035
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:08,390
and I think that's like one of the
biggest blemishes that we have right now

3036
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:08,400
biggest blemishes that we have right now
 

3037
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,069
biggest blemishes that we have right now
I would also argue that moving the um

3038
00:46:10,069 --> 00:46:10,079
I would also argue that moving the um
 

3039
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:11,990
I would also argue that moving the um
Embassy to Jerusalem was also kind of

3040
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:12,000
Embassy to Jerusalem was also kind of
 

3041
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,390
Embassy to Jerusalem was also kind of
silly um and arguably contributed to

3042
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:14,400
silly um and arguably contributed to
 

3043
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,589
silly um and arguably contributed to
some of the conflict we see right now is

3044
00:46:16,589 --> 00:46:16,599
some of the conflict we see right now is
 

3045
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:17,829
some of the conflict we see right now is
I'll argue precisely the opposite

3046
00:46:17,829 --> 00:46:17,839
I'll argue precisely the opposite
 

3047
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:19,190
I'll argue precisely the opposite
especially given the fact that after the

3048
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:19,200
especially given the fact that after the
 

3049
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,950
especially given the fact that after the
movement of the embassy to Jerusalem the

3050
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:20,960
movement of the embassy to Jerusalem the
 

3051
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,309
movement of the embassy to Jerusalem the
Abraham Accords continued to sign and

3052
00:46:22,309 --> 00:46:22,319
Abraham Accords continued to sign and
 

3053
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:24,710
Abraham Accords continued to sign and
actually expand and that if Donald Trump

3054
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:24,720
actually expand and that if Donald Trump
 

3055
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,670
actually expand and that if Donald Trump
had been elected I have no doubt in my

3056
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:26,680
had been elected I have no doubt in my
 

3057
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,349
had been elected I have no doubt in my
mind that Saudi Arabia would now be a

3058
00:46:28,349 --> 00:46:28,359
mind that Saudi Arabia would now be a
 

3059
00:46:28,359 --> 00:46:29,829
mind that Saudi Arabia would now be a
part of the Abraham Accords in fact that

3060
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:29,839
part of the Abraham Accords in fact that
 

3061
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:31,950
part of the Abraham Accords in fact that
was basically pre-negotiated and then

3062
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:31,960
was basically pre-negotiated and then
 

3063
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,630
was basically pre-negotiated and then
when Joe Biden took office Joe Biden

3064
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:33,640
when Joe Biden took office Joe Biden
 

3065
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,710
when Joe Biden took office Joe Biden
took a very anti-saudi stand on a wide

3066
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:35,720
took a very anti-saudi stand on a wide
 

3067
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:38,270
took a very anti-saudi stand on a wide
variety of issues the the biggest single

3068
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:38,280
variety of issues the the biggest single
 

3069
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,750
variety of issues the the biggest single
effect in the Middle East of Joe Biden's

3070
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:39,760
effect in the Middle East of Joe Biden's
 

3071
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,549
effect in the Middle East of Joe Biden's
presidency and again I agree with you

3072
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:41,559
presidency and again I agree with you
 

3073
00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:42,829
presidency and again I agree with you
that not every foreign policy issue can

3074
00:46:42,829 --> 00:46:42,839
that not every foreign policy issue can
 

3075
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:45,030
that not every foreign policy issue can
be laid at the hands of a President Joe

3076
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:45,040
be laid at the hands of a President Joe
 

3077
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,790
be laid at the hands of a President Joe
Biden's main approach to the Middle East

3078
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:46,800
Biden's main approach to the Middle East
 

3079
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,270
Biden's main approach to the Middle East
was very similar to the Obama approach

3080
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:48,280
was very similar to the Obama approach
 

3081
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,430
was very similar to the Obama approach
which is why the Middle East was chaotic

3082
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:49,440
which is why the Middle East was chaotic
 

3083
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,270
which is why the Middle East was chaotic
under Obama and chaotic under Biden and

3084
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:51,280
under Obama and chaotic under Biden and
 

3085
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,950
under Obama and chaotic under Biden and
that was to alienate allies like Saudi

3086
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:53,960
that was to alienate allies like Saudi
 

3087
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:57,910
that was to alienate allies like Saudi
Arabia and Israel and and instead to try

3088
00:46:57,910 --> 00:46:57,920
Arabia and Israel and and instead to try
 

3089
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,190
Arabia and Israel and and instead to try
to make common cause or cut deals with

3090
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:00,200
to make common cause or cut deals with
 

3091
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,950
to make common cause or cut deals with
Iran what that did is incentivize

3092
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:01,960
Iran what that did is incentivize
 

3093
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,230
Iran what that did is incentivize
terrorism from Iran what we're watching

3094
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:03,240
terrorism from Iran what we're watching
 

3095
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,030
terrorism from Iran what we're watching
in the Middle East is Iran attempting to

3096
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:05,040
in the Middle East is Iran attempting to
 

3097
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,630
in the Middle East is Iran attempting to
use every one of its Terror proxies in

3098
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:06,640
use every one of its Terror proxies in
 

3099
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,270
use every one of its Terror proxies in
the Middle East and it was specifically

3100
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:08,280
the Middle East and it was specifically
 

3101
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,510
the Middle East and it was specifically
launched in an attempt to avoid what

3102
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:10,520
launched in an attempt to avoid what
 

3103
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,589
launched in an attempt to avoid what
Biden actually was trying to do which

3104
00:47:11,589 --> 00:47:11,599
Biden actually was trying to do which
 

3105
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:13,950
Biden actually was trying to do which
was good which was after two years of

3106
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:13,960
was good which was after two years of
 

3107
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,190
was good which was after two years of
failure with Saudi Arabia triy to bring

3108
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:15,200
failure with Saudi Arabia triy to bring
 

3109
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,510
failure with Saudi Arabia triy to bring
them into the Abraham Accords right that

3110
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:16,520
them into the Abraham Accords right that
 

3111
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,069
them into the Abraham Accords right that
was what was burgeoning at the end of La

to end the conflict is be lied by the
history of what just happened with the

history of what just happened with the
 

4239

history of what just happened with the
Gaza Strip so when we talk about

so for for those who are not familiar
with the oso cords and again this is

4294
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:36,440
with the oso cords and again this is
 

4295
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,430
with the oso cords and again this is
getting very abstruse but the oso cords

4296
01:05:38,430 --> 01:05:38,440
getting very abstruse but the oso cords
 

4297
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:40,710
getting very abstruse but the oso cords
are broken down into three areas of the

01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,630
provides some level of military security
and control uh and then there's area C

4312
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:53,640
and control uh and then there's area C
 

4313
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:55,670
and control uh and then there's area C
and area was like to be decided later it

4314
01:05:55,670 --> 01:05:55,680
and area was like to be decided later it
 

4315
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:59,829
and area was like to be decided later it
was left up for possible concessions to

01:06:03,079 --> 01:06:04,870
cords had moved forward those are
disputed territories there is building

01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:04,880
disputed territories there is building
 

4323
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,549
disputed territories there is building
taking place in areas by both actually

4324
01:06:06,549 --> 01:06:06,559
taking place in areas by both actually
 

4325
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:07,750
taking place in areas by both actually
no one talks about this but by by

4326
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:07,760
no one talks about this but by by
 

4327
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,630
no one talks about this but by by
Palestinians as well as Israelis uh and

4328
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:10,640
Palestinians as well as Israelis uh and
 

4329
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,829
Palestinians as well as Israelis uh and
the the you know question as to whether

4330
01:06:12,829 --> 01:06:12,839
the the you know question as to whether
 

4331
01:06:12,839 --> 01:06:14,029
the the you know question as to whether
if Israel stopped building there have

4332
01:06:14,029 --> 01:06:14,039
if Israel stopped building there have
 

4333
01:06:14,039 --> 01:06:15,430
if Israel stopped building there have
been many settlement freees in the past

4334
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:15,440
been many settlement freees in the past
 

4335
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,750
been many settlement freees in the past
including some undertaken by Netanyahu

4336
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:17,760
including some undertaken by Netanyahu
 

4337
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,910
including some undertaken by Netanyahu
and and it actually has not done one

4338
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:19,920
and and it actually has not done one
 

4339
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,269
and and it actually has not done one
iota of good in moving the ball forward

4340
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:22,279
iota of good in moving the ball forward
 

4341
01:06:22,279 --> 01:06:24,829
iota of good in moving the ball forward
in terms of actual negot NE iations

4342
01:06:24,829 --> 01:06:24,839
in terms of actual negot NE iations
 

4343
01:06:24,839 --> 01:06:26,230
in terms of actual negot NE iations
again the the biggest problem is that

4344
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:26,240
again the the biggest problem is that
 

4345
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:28,230
again the the biggest problem is that
the leadership for Palestinians has

4346
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:28,240
the leadership for Palestinians has
 

4347
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:31,230
the leadership for Palestinians has
spent every day since really 67 it's not

4348
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:31,240
spent every day since really 67 it's not
 

4349
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:33,510
spent every day since really 67 it's not
even 48 because after 40 between 48 and

4350
01:06:33,510 --> 01:06:33,520
even 48 because after 40 between 48 and
 

4351
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:34,990
even 48 because after 40 between 48 and
67 Jordan was in charge of the West Bank

4352
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:35,000

line they'll greet me as a Liberator and

4816
01:13:24,390 --> 01:13:24,400
line they'll greet me as a Liberator and
 

4817
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,310
line they'll greet me as a Liberator and
because the United States just

4818
01:13:25,310 --> 01:13:25,320
because the United States just
 

4819
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:26,990
because the United States just
surrendered in Afghanistan essentially

4820
01:13:26,990 --> 01:13:27,000
surrendered in Afghanistan essentially
 

4821
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,270
surrendered in Afghanistan essentially
they won't do anything and the West is

4822
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:28,280
they won't do anything and the West is
 

4823
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:29,709
they won't do anything and the West is
fragmenting because NATO's fragmenting

4824
01:13:29,709 --> 01:13:29,719
fragmenting because NATO's fragmenting
 

4825
01:13:29,719 --> 01:13:30,669
fragmenting because NATO's fragmenting
and all the rest of this and obviously

4826
01:13:30,669 --> 01:13:30,679
and all the rest of this and obviously
 

4827
01:13:30,679 --> 01:13:32,709
and all the rest of this and obviously
he was wrong on on all of those scores

4828
01:13:32,709 --> 01:13:32,719
he was wrong on on all of those scores
 

4829
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:35,510
he was wrong on on all of those scores
the problem for for Biden is that as

4830
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:35,520
the problem for for Biden is that as
 

4831
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:38,950
the problem for for Biden is that as
with virtually every war no end line was

4832
01:13:38,950 --> 01:13:38,960
with virtually every war no end line was
 

4833
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,750
with virtually every war no end line was
set and so it became out recently it was

4834
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:41,760
set and so it became out recently it was
 

4835
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:42,910
set and so it became out recently it was
widely reported that actually there was

4836
01:13:42,910 --> 01:13:42,920
widely reported that actually there was
 

4837
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:44,390
widely reported that actually there was
a peace deal that was on the table in

4838
01:13:44,390 --> 01:13:44,400
a peace deal that was on the table in
 

4839
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:45,990
a peace deal that was on the table in
the first few months that Putin was on

4840
01:13:45,990 --> 01:13:46,000
the first few months that Putin was on
 

4841
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,950
the first few months that Putin was on
board with uh that basically would have

4842
01:13:47,950 --> 01:13:47,960
board with uh that basically would have
 

4843
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:50,870
board with uh that basically would have
seeded luhansk and denet and Crimea to

4844
01:13:50,870 --> 01:13:50,880
seeded luhansk and denet and Crimea to
 

4845
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,910
seeded luhansk and denet and Crimea to
Russia in return for solidification of

4846
01:13:52,910 --> 01:13:52,920
Russia in return for solidification of
 

4847
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:53,990
Russia in return for solidification of
those lines

4848
01:13:53,990 --> 01:13:54,000
those lines
 

4849
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,030
those lines
American and Western Security guarantees

4850
01:13:56,030 --> 01:13:56,040
American and Western Security guarantees
 

4851
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:57,709
American and Western Security guarantees
to Ukraine right Ukraine wouldn't

4852
01:13:57,709 --> 01:13:57,719
to Ukraine right Ukraine wouldn't
 

4853
01:13:57,719 --> 01:13:58,910
to Ukraine right Ukraine wouldn't
formally join NATO but there would be

4854
01:13:58,910 --> 01:13:58,920
formally join NATO but there would be
 

4855
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,750
formally join NATO but there would be
security guarantees to Ukraine we're

4856
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:00,760
security guarantees to Ukraine we're
 

4857
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:02,390
security guarantees to Ukraine we're
ending up there anyway it's just taking

4858
01:14:02,390 --> 01:14:02,400
ending up there anyway it's just taking
 

4859
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,149
ending up there anyway it's just taking
a lot more money and a lot more time to

4860
01:14:04,149 --> 01:14:04,159
a lot more money and a lot more time to
 

4861
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:05,390
a lot more money and a lot more time to
get there and do you think Trump would

4862
01:14:05,390 --> 01:14:05,400
get there and do you think Trump would
 

4863
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:07,669
get there and do you think Trump would
have helped push that piece yes and I

4864
01:14:07,669 --> 01:14:07,679
have helped push that piece yes and I
 

4865
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:08,990
have helped push that piece yes and I
think and I think that Biden actually

4866
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:09,000
think and I think that Biden actually
 

4867
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,430
think and I think that Biden actually
did zeny a bit of a disservice because

4868
01:14:10,430 --> 01:14:10,440
did zeny a bit of a disservice because
 

4869
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:11,709
did zeny a bit of a disservice because
zinsky knows where this war is going to

4870
01:14:11,709 --> 01:14:11,719
zinsky knows where this war is going to
 

4871
01:14:11,719 --> 01:14:12,910
zinsky knows where this war is going to
end and it's not going to end with

4872
01:14:12,910 --> 01:14:12,920
end and it's not going to end with
 

4873
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:15,030
end and it's not going to end with
lanskin denes and Crimea in Ukrainian

4874
01:14:15,030 --> 01:14:15,040
lanskin denes and Crimea in Ukrainian
 

4875
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,189
lanskin denes and Crimea in Ukrainian
hands it's just not going to and he

4876
01:14:16,189 --> 01:14:16,199
hands it's just not going to and he
 

4877
01:14:16,199 --> 01:14:19,830
hands it's just not going to and he
knows that what actually in my opinion

4878
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:19,840
knows that what actually in my opinion
 

4879
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:23,110
knows that what actually in my opinion
zilinski needed was for Joe Biden to be

4880
01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:23,120
zilinski needed was for Joe Biden to be
 

4881
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,390
zilinski needed was for Joe Biden to be
the person who foed that deal upon him

4882
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:25,400
the person who foed that deal upon him
 

4883
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:26,830
the person who foed that deal upon him
so that he could then go back to his own

4884
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:26,840
so that he could then go back to his own
 

4885
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,910
so that he could then go back to his own
people and say listen guys I wanted all

4886
01:14:28,910 --> 01:14:28,920
people and say listen guys I wanted all
 

4887
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:30,550
people and say listen guys I wanted all
those things but the Americans weren't

4888
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:30,560
those things but the Americans weren't
 

4889
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,110
those things but the Americans weren't
willing to allow me to have all those

4890
01:14:32,110 --> 01:14:32,120
willing to allow me to have all those
 

4891
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:34,669
willing to allow me to have all those
things and so we did an amazing job we

4892
01:14:34,669 --> 01:14:34,679
things and so we did an amazing job we
 

4893
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:35,990
things and so we did an amazing job we
did a heroic job in defending our own

4894
01:14:35,990 --> 01:14:36,000
did a heroic job in defending our own
 

4895
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,830
did a heroic job in defending our own
land we devastated the Russian military

4896
01:14:37,830 --> 01:14:37,840
land we devastated the Russian military
 

4897
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,870
land we devastated the Russian military
even though no one expected us to but we

4898
01:14:39,870 --> 01:14:39,880
even though no one expected us to but we
 

4899
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:41,229
even though no one expected us to but we
can't get back those things because it's

4900
01:14:41,229 --> 01:14:41,239
can't get back those things because it's
 

4901
01:14:41,239 --> 01:14:42,510
can't get back those things because it's
unrealistic to get back those things

4902
01:14:42,510 --> 01:14:42,520
unrealistic to get back those things
 

4903
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:44,510
unrealistic to get back those things
because America basically they're big

4904
01:14:44,510 --> 01:14:44,520
because America basically they're big
 

4905
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:45,870
because America basically they're big
funer and they're the ones who want the

4906
01:14:45,870 --> 01:14:45,880
funer and they're the ones who want the
 

4907
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:47,750
funer and they're the ones who want the
deal instead what Biden said and this

4908
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:47,760
deal instead what Biden said and this
 

4909
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:49,110
deal instead what Biden said and this
was reported in the Washington Post last

4910
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:49,120
was reported in the Washington Post last
 

4911
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:50,870
was reported in the Washington Post last
year the Biden Administration said we're

01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:50,880
year the Biden Administration said we're
 

4913
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:52,590
year the Biden Administration said we're
going to fight for as long as it takes

4914
01:14:52,590 --> 01:14:52,600
going to fight for as long as it takes
 

4915
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:53,950
going to fight for as long as it takes
with as much as it takes takes and when

4916
01:14:53,950 --> 01:14:53,960
with as much as it takes takes and when
 

4917
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:56,669
with as much as it takes takes and when
they were asked until when they said

4918
01:14:56,669 --> 01:14:56,679
they were asked until when they said
 

4919
01:14:56,679 --> 01:15:00,030
they were asked until when they said
whatever zinski says and that's not a

4920
01:15:00,030 --> 01:15:00,040
whatever zinski says and that's not a
 

4921
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:02,510
whatever zinski says and that's not a
policy that's just a recipe for a frozen

4922
01:15:02,510 --> 01:15:02,520
policy that's just a recipe for a frozen
 

4923
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:05,270
policy that's just a recipe for a frozen
conflict with endless funding now it may

4924
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:05,280
conflict with endless funding now it may
 

4925
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:06,350
conflict with endless funding now it may
be that Putin's walked away from the

4926
01:15:06,350 --> 01:15:06,360
be that Putin's walked away from the
 

4927
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:07,470
be that Putin's walked away from the
table and that deal is no longer

4928
01:15:07,470 --> 01:15:07,480
table and that deal is no longer
 

4929
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:09,390
table and that deal is no longer
available if that deal is is available

4930
01:15:09,390 --> 01:15:09,400
available if that deal is is available
 

4931
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:10,830
available if that deal is is available
right now I certainly hope that's being

4932
01:15:10,830 --> 01:15:10,840
right now I certainly hope that's being
 

4933
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:13,350
right now I certainly hope that's being
pursued behind closed doors my main

01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:13,360
pursued behind closed doors my main

critique again of Biden is that when you

4936
01:15:15,870 --> 01:15:15,880
critique again of Biden is that when you
 

4937
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:18,149
critique again of Biden is that when you
Outsource the end goal to another

4938
01:15:18,149 --> 01:15:18,159
Outsource the end goal to another
 

4939
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:20,030
Outsource the end goal to another
country without stating what America's

4940
01:15:20,030 --> 01:15:20,040
country without stating what America's
 

4941
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:21,629
country without stating what America's
interest is that's a problem I also

4942
01:15:21,629 --> 01:15:21,639
interest is that's a problem I also
 

4943
01:15:21,639 --> 01:15:23,510
interest is that's a problem I also
think that Biden did really quite poor

4944
01:15:23,510 --> 01:15:23,520
think that Biden did really quite poor
 

4945
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,030
think that Biden did really quite poor
job of sort of explaining what America's

realistic interests are I I I don't like

realistic interests are I I I don't like
 

4949
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:30,270

01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:42,790
entire United States learned a lesson
from Iraq and Afghanistan that

5160
01:18:42,790 --> 01:18:42,800
from Iraq and Afghanistan that
 

5161

5165
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,709
budgets and no clear goal are like the
worst foreign policy decisions you can

worst foreign policy decisions you can
 

5167
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:50,990
worst foreign policy decisions you can
ever do they've like defined US foreign

5168
01:18:50,990 --> 01:18:51,000
ever do they've like defined US foreign
 

5169
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,790
ever do they've like defined US foreign
policy for the past two or three decades

5170
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:52,800
policy for the past two or three decades
 

5171
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,390
policy for the past two or three decades
which which is unfortunate but seems to

5172
01:18:54,390 --> 01:18:54,400
which which is unfortunate but seems to
 

5173
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:58,030
which which is unfortunate but seems to
be the case um my my feeling would be

5174
01:18:58,030 --> 01:18:58,040
be the case um my my feeling would be
 

5175
01:18:58,040 --> 01:18:59,110
be the case um my my feeling would be
and this is just a feeling I don't know

5176
01:18:59,110 --> 01:18:59,120
and this is just a feeling I don't know
 

5177
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:00,629
and this is just a feeling I don't know
if internal cables have leaked that say

5178
01:19:00,629 --> 01:19:00,639
if internal cables have leaked that say
 

5179
01:19:00,639 --> 01:19:03,270
if internal cables have leaked that say
otherwise is the uh the Biden

5180
01:19:03,270 --> 01:19:03,280
otherwise is the uh the Biden
 

5181
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,550
otherwise is the uh the Biden
Administration has probably always had a

5182
01:19:05,550 --> 01:19:05,560
Administration has probably always had a
 

5183
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:07,510
Administration has probably always had a
quiet position of at some point there's

5184
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:07,520
quiet position of at some point there's
 

5185
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,110
quiet position of at some point there's
going to be an off-ramp here and I think

5186
01:19:09,110 --> 01:19:09,120
going to be an off-ramp here and I think
 

5187
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,590
going to be an off-ramp here and I think
even a month or two ago I think those

5188
01:19:10,590 --> 01:19:10,600
even a month or two ago I think those
 

5189
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:12,550
even a month or two ago I think those
talks were being leaked that discussion

5190
01:19:12,550 --> 01:19:12,560

had begun with zilinsky looking for an
 

5193
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:16,629
had begun with zilinsky looking for an

obviously that can't be the statement
 

5205
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,550
obviously that can't be the statement
it's always going to be that we're going

01:19:44,149 --> 01:19:44,159
any other statement would be absurd so I
 

5231
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:46,189
any other statement would be absurd so I
can understand why it feels like on a

5232
01:19:46,189 --> 01:19:46,199
can understand why it feels like on a
 

5233
01:19:46,199 --> 01:19:47,990
can understand why it feels like on a
public level a blank check and an

5234
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:48,000
public level a blank check and an
 

5235
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,430
public level a blank check and an
indefinite time period was granted to

indefinite time period was granted to
 

5237
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:50,910
indefinite time period was granted to
zalinsky but I don't think that's going

01:19:50,910 --> 01:19:50,920
zalinsky but I don't think that's going
 

5239
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:52,990
zalinsky but I don't think that's going
to be the case I think I again I hope

5240
01:19:52,990 --> 01:19:53,000
to be the case I think I again I hope

we've learned our lessons in the Middle
East about the forever Wars that this

want um I do disagree I feel like we're
 

5251
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,470
want um I do disagree I feel like we're
playing a little bit retrospectively

5252
01:20:02,470 --> 01:20:02,480
playing a little bit retrospectively
 

5253
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:03,990
playing a little bit retrospectively
saying that like well it's obvious that

5254
01:20:03,990 --> 01:20:04,000
saying that like well it's obvious that
 

5255
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,030
saying that like well it's obvious that
they're not going to capture the Don

5256
01:20:05,030 --> 01:20:05,040
they're not going to capture the Don
 

5257
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,030
they're not going to capture the Don
boss it's obvious that they're not going

5258
01:20:06,030 --> 01:20:06,040
boss it's obvious that they're not going
 

5259
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:07,709
boss it's obvious that they're not going
to capture Crimea I agree for Crimea

5260
01:20:07,709 --> 01:20:07,719
to capture Crimea I agree for Crimea
 

5261
01:20:07,719 --> 01:20:09,110
to capture Crimea I agree for Crimea
that was incredibly obvious but it was

5262
01:20:09,110 --> 01:20:09,120
that was incredibly obvious but it was
 

5263
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:10,750
that was incredibly obvious but it was
also really obvious that in two weeks

5264
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:10,760
also really obvious that in two weeks
 

5265
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:12,870
also really obvious that in two weeks
Russia would own Kiev and Ukraine was

5266
01:20:12,870 --> 01:20:12,880
Russia would own Kiev and Ukraine was
 

5267
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:14,990
Russia would own Kiev and Ukraine was
going to be Belarus 2.0 I think that

5268
01:20:14,990 --> 01:20:15,000
going to be Belarus 2.0 I think that
 

5269
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,950
going to be Belarus 2.0 I think that
even for a lot of uh military people um

5270
01:20:17,950 --> 01:20:17,960
even for a lot of uh military people um
 

5271
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:19,950
even for a lot of uh military people um
and analysts around the world uh that

5272
01:20:19,950 --> 01:20:19,960
and analysts around the world uh that
 

5273
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:21,910
and analysts around the world uh that
that that was an expectation or at least

5274
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:21,920
that that was an expectation or at least
 

5275

01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:29,760
Trump he used a phrase that that Trump
 

5809
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,430
Trump he used a phrase that that Trump
was disseminating knowingly false

was disseminating knowingly false
information the word that's carrying a

01:28:33,189 --> 01:28:33,199
information the word that's carrying a
 

5813
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:34,590
information the word that's carrying a
lot of weight there is the word

5814
01:28:34,590 --> 01:28:34,600
lot of weight there is the word
 

5815
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:38,350
lot of weight there is the word
knowingly um so knowingly implies a no

knowingly um so knowingly implies a no

01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:40,070
knowingly um so knowingly implies a no
were do I think the information he was

5818
01:28:40,070 --> 01:28:40,080
were do I think the information he was
 

5819
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:41,790
were do I think the information he was
disseminating was false yes do I think

5820
01:28:41,790 --> 01:28:41,800
disseminating was false yes do I think
 

5821
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:43,390
disseminating was false yes do I think
that Donald Trump has a unique capacity

5822
01:28:43,390 --> 01:28:43,400
that Donald Trump has a unique capacity
 

5823
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:45,070
that Donald Trump has a unique capacity
to convince himself of nearly anything

5824
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:45,080
to convince himself of nearly anything
 

5825
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:47,149
to convince himself of nearly anything
that is to his own benefit absolutely

5826
01:28:47,149 --> 01:28:47,159
that is to his own benefit absolutely
 

5827
01:28:47,159 --> 01:28:49,229
that is to his own benefit absolutely
and I think that that's actually what

5828
01:28:49,229 --> 01:28:49,239
and I think that that's actually what
 

5829
01:28:49,239 --> 01:28:50,510
and I think that that's actually what
Donald Trump was doing there and the

5830
01:28:50,510 --> 01:28:50,520
Donald Trump was doing there and the
 

5831
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:51,990
Donald Trump was doing there and the
evidence of that is Donald Trump being a

5832
01:28:51,990 --> 01:28:52,000
evidence of that is Donald Trump being a
 

5833
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,189
evidence of that is Donald Trump being a
human in all of us watching him for the

5834
01:28:53,189 --> 01:28:53,199
human in all of us watching him for the
 

5835
01:28:53,199 --> 01:28:55,189
human in all of us watching him for the
last several years uh so you know the

5836
01:28:55,189 --> 01:28:55,199
last several years uh so you know the
 

5837
01:28:55,199 --> 01:28:58,149
last several years uh so you know the
idea that that he knew it to be false

5838
01:28:58,149 --> 01:28:58,159
idea that that he knew it to be false
 

5839
01:28:58,159 --> 01:29:00,550
idea that that he knew it to be false
I'm not even sure those standards apply

I'm not even sure those standards apply
 

5841
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:02,189
I'm not even sure those standards apply
in any like and just assessing him as a

in any like and just assessing him as a
 

5843
01:29:02,199 --> 01:29:03,149
in any like and just assessing him as a
human which is really what we're being

5844
01:29:03,149 --> 01:29:03,159
human which is really what we're being
 

5845
01:29:03,159 --> 01:29:04,270
human which is really what we're being
asked to do because there's an intent

5846
01:29:04,270 --> 01:29:04,280
asked to do because there's an intent
 

5847
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:07,109

5861
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:19,669
area when we're looking at certain
criminal statutes where intent is

5862
01:29:19,669 --> 01:29:19,679
criminal statutes where intent is
 

5863
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:21,149
criminal statutes where intent is
required it's a reasonable person

required it's a reasonable person
 

5865
01:29:21,159 --> 01:29:22,910
required it's a reasonable person
standard right like would a reasonable

01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:27,990
depends on the ment right standard so
it's not the same in every case if you

it's not the same in every case if you
 

5873
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,189
it's not the same in every case if you
have to establish individual intent then

have to establish individual intent then
 

5875
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:32,550

establish the intent necessary to
convict under a seditious conspiracy or

6008
01:31:27,550 --> 01:31:27,560
convict under a seditious conspiracy or
 

6009
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:29,430
convict under a seditious conspiracy or
or an Insurrection I agree with that but

6010
01:31:29,430 --> 01:31:29,440
or an Insurrection I agree with that but
 

6011
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:30,830
or an Insurrection I agree with that but
I think a lot of the underlying facts

6012
01:31:30,830 --> 01:31:30,840
I think a lot of the underlying facts
 

6013
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:32,229
I think a lot of the underlying facts
though because he does bring up those

6014
01:31:32,229 --> 01:31:32,239

01:31:32,239 --> 01:31:34,350

6017
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:35,750

that they were knowingly false
information so it seems like that's

6022
01:31:38,550 --> 01:31:38,560
information so it seems like that's
 

6023
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:39,750

going to be part of the case maybe not

6024
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:39,760
going to be part of the case maybe not

01:31:42,709 --> 01:31:42,719
charges that he mentioned but it seems
 

6029
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:44,629
charges that he mentioned but it seems
like that's probably going to be part of

6030

like that's probably going to be part of
 

6031
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:46,629
like that's probably going to be part of
um what he's going to have to establish

01:31:46,629 --> 01:31:46,639
um what he's going to have to establish

01:35:10,790 --> 01:35:10,800
incredibly Troublesome I mean the
 

6253
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:14,270
incredibly Troublesome I mean the
question to me is the bigger question

6254
01:35:14,270 --> 01:35:14,280
question to me is the bigger question
 

6255
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:15,470
question to me is the bigger question
that I think the Democrats are trying to

6256
01:35:15,470 --> 01:35:15,480
that I think the Democrats are trying to
 

6257
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:17,030
that I think the Democrats are trying to
promoe in this election cycle which is

6258
01:35:17,030 --> 01:35:17,040
promoe in this election cycle which is

this means he is a threat to democracy

6260
01:35:18,750 --> 01:35:18,760
this means he is a threat to democracy
 

6261
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:20,310
this means he is a threat to democracy
sufficient that if he were to win the

6262
01:35:20,310 --> 01:35:20,320
sufficient that if he were to win the
 

6263
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:22,270
sufficient that if he were to win the
election there would not be another is

6264
01:35:22,270 --> 01:35:22,280
election there would not be another is
 

6265
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:24,590
election there would not be another is
that but he tried to do that last time

6266
01:35:24,590 --> 01:35:24,600
that but he tried to do that last time
 

6267
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:26,870
that but he tried to do that last time
could he not try to next time and I mean

6268
01:35:26,870 --> 01:35:26,880
could he not try to next time and I mean
 

6269
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:28,390
could he not try to next time and I mean
he could try to do whatever he wants

6270
01:35:28,390 --> 01:35:28,400
he could try to do whatever he wants
 

6271
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:29,870
he could try to do whatever he wants
presumably and he would fail the same

6272
01:35:29,870 --> 01:35:29,880
presumably and he would fail the same
 

6273
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:31,270
presumably and he would fail the same
way that he did last time why do we

6274
01:35:31,270 --> 01:35:31,280
way that he did last time why do we
 

6275
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:33,870
way that he did last time why do we
think that because he failed because so

6276
01:35:33,870 --> 01:35:33,880
think that because he failed because so
 

6277
01:35:33,880 --> 01:35:37,590

01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:36,950
maybe agree maybe disagree I think that
Trump kind of thought one I don't think

6344

Trump kind of thought one I don't think
 

6345
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:38,550
Trump kind of thought one I don't think
Trump knows much at all about how the

6346
01:36:38,550 --> 01:36:38,560
Trump knows much at all about how the
 

6347
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:39,790
Trump knows much at all about how the
government works I think we probably

6348
01:36:39,790 --> 01:36:39,800
government works I think we probably
 

6349
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:41,270
government works I think we probably
agree with that um I think Trump

6350
01:36:41,270 --> 01:36:41,280
agree with that um I think Trump
 

6351
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:42,910
agree with that um I think Trump
probably thought that if he had people

6352
01:36:42,910 --> 01:36:42,920
probably thought that if he had people
 

6353
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:44,390
probably thought that if he had people
that were like at least in his party and

6354
01:36:44,390 --> 01:36:44,400
that were like at least in his party and
 

6355
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:46,270
that were like at least in his party and
kind of camp that they'll basically do

6356
01:36:46,270 --> 01:36:46,280
kind of camp that they'll basically do
 

6357
01:36:46,280 --> 01:36:48,189
kind of camp that they'll basically do
whatever needs to be done to give him

6358
01:36:48,189 --> 01:36:48,199

6551
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:34,589

don't think it'll happen because of how

6552
01:39:34,589 --> 01:39:34,599
don't think it'll happen because of how
 

6553

01:39:35,910 --> 01:39:35,920
the polling looks now but if Trump
 

6555
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:37,550
the polling looks now but if Trump
didn't get the nomination I think Trump

6556
01:39:37,550 --> 01:39:37,560
didn't get the nomination I think Trump
 

6557
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:38,669
didn't get the nomination I think Trump
would say screw it and run as an

independent because he thinks he can win
 

6561
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:42,109
independent because he thinks he can win
or whatever right um I I doubt that he

6562
01:39:42,109 --> 01:39:42,119
or whatever right um I I doubt that he
 

6563
01:39:42,119 --> 01:39:45,109
or whatever right um I I doubt that he
would do that but theoretically again

6564
01:39:45,109 --> 01:39:45,119
would do that but theoretically again
 

6565
01:39:45,119 --> 01:39:46,910
would do that but theoretically again

6574
01:39:53,870 --> 01:39:53,880
what is all this in service of what's
 

6575
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:55,149
what is all this in service of what's
the what's the generalized argument that

6576
01:39:55,149 --> 01:39:55,159
the what's the generalized argument that
 

6577
01:39:55,159 --> 01:39:57,270
the what's the generalized argument that
you're making do you believe I'll go

you're making do you believe I'll go
 

6579

back to my question you think if Trump

6580
01:39:59,430 --> 01:39:59,440
back to my question you think if Trump
 

6581
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:01,709
back to my question you think if Trump
wins there will be no more elections is

6582
01:40:01,709 --> 01:40:01,719
wins there will be no more elections is
 

6583
01:40:01,719 --> 01:40:03,070
wins there will be no more elections is
that is that like what what put

6584
01:40:03,070 --> 01:40:03,080
that is that like what what put
 

6585
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:04,270
that is that like what what put
percentage on it what what percentage do

6586
01:40:04,270 --> 01:40:04,280
percentage on it what what percentage do
 

6587
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:05,709
percentage on it what what percentage do
you think that that's a reality that if

6588
01:40:05,709 --> 01:40:05,719
you think that that's a reality that if
 

6589
01:40:05,719 --> 01:40:07,589
you think that that's a reality that if
Donal Trum Trump wins I think there is a

6590
01:40:07,589 --> 01:40:07,599
Donal Trum Trump wins I think there is a
 

6591
01:40:07,599 --> 01:40:09,750
Donal Trum Trump wins I think there is a
100% chance that he will try to prevent

6592
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:09,760
100% chance that he will try to prevent
 

6593

the peaceful transfer power in terms of
would he succeed I can guarantee you he

6596
01:40:13,109 --> 01:40:13,119
would he succeed I can guarantee you he
 

6597
01:40:13,119 --> 01:40:14,550
would he succeed I can guarantee you he
will not do that why is that because

6598
01:40:14,550 --> 01:40:14,560
will not do that why is that because
 

6599
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:15,550
will not do that why is that because
he's in the second term and he's no

7140
01:47:50,350 --> 01:47:50,360
when he's not on the ballot so so now
 

7141
01:47:50,360 --> 01:47:51,350
when he's not on the ballot so so now
now your theory is that he's going to

get he's going to get reelected and then
in 2028 he's not even going to be on the

in 2028 he's not even going to be on the

01:47:59,960 --> 01:48:01,790
him president of the United States when
he has not been on a ballot I don't know

7154
01:48:01,790 --> 01:48:01,800
he has not been on a ballot I don't know
 

7155
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:03,390
he has not been on a ballot I don't know
what the I don't know what the scheme

7156
01:48:03,390 --> 01:48:03,400
what the I don't know what the scheme
 

7157
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:04,950
what the I don't know what the scheme
would be I think we can kind of like

7158
01:48:04,950 --> 01:48:04,960
would be I think we can kind of like
 

7159
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:06,510
would be I think we can kind of like
laugh and say there's no scheme we could

7160
01:48:06,510 --> 01:48:06,520
laugh and say there's no scheme we could
 

7161
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:09,149
laugh and say there's no scheme we could
even concoct but I think like with the

7162
01:48:09,149 --> 01:48:09,159
even concoct but I think like with the
 

7163
01:48:09,159 --> 01:48:10,790
even concoct but I think like with the
machine gun he's going to walk I think I

7164
01:48:10,790 --> 01:48:10,800
machine gun he's going to walk I think I
 

7165
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:12,270
machine gun he's going to walk I think I
think the issue though is that like the

7166
01:48:12,270 --> 01:48:12,280
think the issue though is that like the
 

7167
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:14,350
think the issue though is that like the
idea of electing another president that

7168
01:48:14,350 --> 01:48:14,360
idea of electing another president that
 

7169
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:15,750
idea of electing another president that
has tried to circumvent the peaceful

transfer of power using extra legal
 

7173
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:18,589
transfer of power using extra legal
means and then pretending like we can't

7174
01:48:18,589 --> 01:48:18,599
means and then pretending like we can't
 

7175
01:48:18,599 --> 01:48:20,950
means and then pretending like we can't
concoct a single scheme he could try to

7176
01:48:20,950 --> 01:48:20,960
concoct a single scheme he could try to
 

7177
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:23,149
concoct a single scheme he could try to
circumvent um other legal processes to

7178
01:48:23,149 --> 01:48:23,159
circumvent um other legal processes to
 

7179
01:48:23,159 --> 01:48:25,229
circumvent um other legal processes to

him agrees with that when every single
 

7191
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:35,550
him agrees with that when every single
person that's worked with him save for

01:48:35,550 --> 01:48:35,560
person that's worked with him save for
 

7193
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:37,790
person that's worked with him save for
the what Sydney pal uh Eastman and

7194
01:48:37,790 --> 01:48:37,800
the what Sydney pal uh Eastman and
 

7195
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:39,390
the what Sydney pal uh Eastman and
Giuliani which I don't think even I

7196
01:48:39,390 --> 01:48:39,400
Giuliani which I don't think even I
 

7197
01:48:39,400 --> 01:48:40,310
Giuliani which I don't think even I
don't think anybody would want to throw

7198
01:48:40,310 --> 01:48:40,320
don't think anybody would want to throw
 

7199
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:42,350
don't think anybody would want to throw
their lot in with those three um it just

7200
01:48:42,350 --> 01:48:42,360
their lot in with those three um it just
 

7201
01:48:42,360 --> 01:48:43,870
their lot in with those three um it just
seems wild to me that we would say like

7202
01:48:43,870 --> 01:48:43,880
seems wild to me that we would say like
 

7203
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:44,709
seems wild to me that we would say like
yeah we're just going to go ahead and

7204
01:48:44,709 --> 01:48:44,719
yeah we're just going to go ahead and
 

7205
01:48:44,719 --> 01:48:46,270
yeah we're just going to go ahead and
trust this guy with another ter of

7206
01:48:46,270 --> 01:48:46,280
trust this guy with another ter of
 

7207
01:48:46,280 --> 01:48:47,270
trust this guy with another ter of
president but like he can't run for a

7208
01:48:47,270 --> 01:48:47,280
president but like he can't run for a
 

7209
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:48,709
president but like he can't run for a
third term so it's fine when there's

7210
01:48:48,709 --> 01:48:48,719
third term so it's fine when there's
 

7211
01:48:48,719 --> 01:48:50,550
third term so it's fine when there's
like 50 million other things make you

7212
01:48:50,550 --> 01:48:50,560
like 50 million other things make you
 

7213
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:51,510
like 50 million other things make you
the case that if you want him not to

7214
01:48:51,510 --> 01:48:51,520
the case that if you want him not to
 

7215
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:52,709
the case that if you want him not to
make election trouble you should elect

7216
01:48:52,709 --> 01:48:52,719
make election trouble you should elect
 

7217
01:48:52,719 --> 01:48:54,589
make election trouble you should elect
him president in the next election cycle

7218
01:48:54,589 --> 01:48:54,599
him president in the next election cycle
 

7219
01:48:54,599 --> 01:48:57,350
him president in the next election cycle
and then he will be ineligible that okay

7220
01:48:57,350 --> 01:48:57,360
and then he will be ineligible that okay
 

7221
01:48:57,360 --> 01:48:59,189
and then he will be ineligible that okay
well I that be a wholly unconvincing

7222
01:48:59,189 --> 01:48:59,199
well I that be a wholly unconvincing
 

7223
01:48:59,199 --> 01:49:02,390
well I that be a wholly unconvincing
argument but okay well recently in the

7224
01:49:02,390 --> 01:49:02,400
argument but okay well recently in the
 

7225
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:05,550
argument but okay well recently in the
news the presidents of Harvard pen and

7226
01:49:05,550 --> 01:49:05,560
news the presidents of Harvard pen and
 

7227
01:49:05,560 --> 01:49:09,149
news the presidents of Harvard pen and
MIT fail to fully denounce calls for

7228
01:49:09,149 --> 01:49:09,159
MIT fail to fully denounce calls for
 

7229
01:49:09,159 --> 01:49:12,149
MIT fail to fully denounce calls for
genocide and that Rose questions about

7230
01:49:12,149 --> 01:49:12,159
genocide and that Rose questions about
 

7231
01:49:12,159 --> 01:49:14,510
genocide and that Rose questions about
the influence of Dei programs at

7232
01:49:14,510 --> 01:49:14,520
the influence of Dei programs at
 

7233
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:17,350
the influence of Dei programs at
universities and so maybe either looking

7234
01:49:17,350 --> 01:49:17,360
universities and so maybe either looking
 

7235
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:20,229
universities and so maybe either looking
at this or zooming out more broadly at

7236
01:49:20,229 --> 01:49:20,239
at this or zooming out more broadly at
 

7237
01:49:20,239 --> 01:49:22,149
at this or zooming out more broadly at
identity politics at universities or

7238
01:49:22,149 --> 01:49:22,159
identity politics at universities or
 

7239
01:49:22,159 --> 01:49:25,470
identity politics at universities or
identity politics wokeism at in our

7240
01:49:25,470 --> 01:49:25,480
identity politics wokeism at in our
 

7241
01:49:25,480 --> 01:49:28,149
identity politics wokeism at in our
culture how big of a threat is it to our

7242
01:49:28,149 --> 01:49:28,159
culture how big of a threat is it to our
 

7243
01:49:28,159 --> 01:49:30,550
culture how big of a threat is it to our
culture to Western civilization so

7244
01:49:30,550 --> 01:49:30,560
culture to Western civilization so
 

7245
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:32,270
culture to Western civilization so
obviously st's a huge threat um the

7246
01:49:32,270 --> 01:49:32,280
obviously st's a huge threat um the
 

7247
01:49:32,280 --> 01:49:33,750
obviously st's a huge threat um the
reason that I think this a huge threat I

7248
01:49:33,750 --> 01:49:33,760
reason that I think this a huge threat I
 

7249
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:35,229
reason that I think this a huge threat I
want to give a definition of wokeism

7250
01:49:35,229 --> 01:49:35,239
want to give a definition of wokeism
 

7251
01:49:35,239 --> 01:49:36,629
want to give a definition of wokeism
because people are very often accused of

7252
01:49:36,629 --> 01:49:36,639
because people are very often accused of
 

7253
01:49:36,639 --> 01:49:38,510
because people are very often accused of
not using wokeism properly or believing

7254
01:49:38,510 --> 01:49:38,520
not using wokeism properly or believing
 

7255
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:39,990
not using wokeism properly or believing
that it's sort of a catch-all phrase I

7256
01:49:39,990 --> 01:49:40,000
that it's sort of a catch-all phrase I
 

7257
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,550
that it's sort of a catch-all phrase I
don't think it's a catch-all term uh I

7258
01:49:41,550 --> 01:49:41,560
don't think it's a catch-all term uh I
 

7259
01:49:41,560 --> 01:49:44,790
don't think it's a catch-all term uh I
think that wokeism has its root in

7260
01:49:44,790 --> 01:49:44,800
think that wokeism has its root in
 

7261
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:47,390
think that wokeism has its root in
postmodernism which essentially suggests

7262
01:49:47,390 --> 01:49:47,400
postmodernism which essentially suggests
 

7263
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:51,510
postmodernism which essentially suggests
that every principle is a reflection of

7264
01:49:51,510 --> 01:49:51,520
that every principle is a reflection of
 

7265
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:53,990
that every principle is a reflection of
underlying structures of power and that

7266
01:49:53,990 --> 01:49:54,000
underlying structures of power and that
 

7267
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,950
underlying structures of power and that
therefore any inequality that emerges

7268
01:49:56,950 --> 01:49:56,960
therefore any inequality that emerges
 

7269
01:49:56,960 --> 01:49:59,109
therefore any inequality that emerges
under such a system is a reflection

7270
01:49:59,109 --> 01:49:59,119
under such a system is a reflection
 

7271
01:49:59,119 --> 01:50:01,189
under such a system is a reflection
again of that structure of power that

7272
01:50:01,189 --> 01:50:01,199
again of that structure of power that
 

7273
01:50:01,199 --> 01:50:02,510
again of that structure of power that
used to be applied in sort of marxist

7274
01:50:02,510 --> 01:50:02,520
used to be applied in sort of marxist
 

7275
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:03,990
used to be applied in sort of marxist
ways the suggestion being that economic

7276
01:50:03,990 --> 01:50:04,000
ways the suggestion being that economic
 

7277
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,229
ways the suggestion being that economic
inequality was the result of

extreme and then we have to fight on
 

7507
01:53:59,360 --> 01:54:02,430
extreme and then we have to fight on
those extremes like I would argue that

it has just taken way too far but you

7646
01:56:00,030 --> 01:56:00,040
it has just taken way too far but you
 

7647
01:56:00,040 --> 01:56:01,870
it has just taken way too far but you
know what I will blame on some of this

7648
01:56:01,870 --> 01:56:01,880
know what I will blame on some of this
 

7649
01:56:01,880 --> 01:56:03,709
know what I will blame on some of this
is I will blame conservatives for some

7650
01:56:03,709 --> 01:56:03,719
is I will blame conservatives for some
 

7651
01:56:03,719 --> 01:56:05,229
is I will blame conservatives for some
of this because I think one issue that

7652
01:56:05,229 --> 01:56:05,239
of this because I think one issue that
 

7653
01:56:05,239 --> 01:56:06,669
of this because I think one issue that
happens and I think Ben might even agree

7654
01:56:06,669 --> 01:56:06,679
happens and I think Ben might even agree
 

7655
01:56:06,679 --> 01:56:08,629
happens and I think Ben might even agree
with me here too is I think there

7656
01:56:08,629 --> 01:56:08,639
with me here too is I think there
 

7657
01:56:08,639 --> 01:56:09,990
with me here too is I think there
there's two huge problems that have

7658
01:56:09,990 --> 01:56:10,000
there's two huge problems that have
 

7659
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:11,390
there's two huge problems that have
happened in the United States I think

7660
01:56:11,390 --> 01:56:11,400
happened in the United States I think
 

7661
01:56:11,400 --> 01:56:13,350
happened in the United States I think
broadly speaking is that one we've

7662
01:56:13,350 --> 01:56:13,360
broadly speaking is that one we've
 

7663
01:56:13,360 --> 01:56:15,350
broadly speaking is that one we've
become more different than we ever have

7664
01:56:15,350 --> 01:56:15,360
become more different than we ever have
 

7665
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:17,430
become more different than we ever have
been and two we become more similar than

7666
01:56:17,430 --> 01:56:17,440
been and two we become more similar than
 

7667
01:56:17,440 --> 01:56:19,270
been and two we become more similar than
we ever have been and when I say this

7668
01:56:19,270 --> 01:56:19,280
we ever have been and when I say this
 

7669
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:20,790
we ever have been and when I say this
what I is it like we're splitting off

7670
01:56:20,790 --> 01:56:20,800
what I is it like we're splitting off
 

7671
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:22,270
what I is it like we're splitting off
into these groups and then these groups

7672
01:56:22,270 --> 01:56:22,280
into these groups and then these groups
 

7673
01:56:22,280 --> 01:56:24,510
into these groups and then these groups
are enforcing this insane homogeneity

7674
01:56:24,510 --> 01:56:24,520
are enforcing this insane homogeneity
 

7675
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:26,470
are enforcing this insane homogeneity
between these two separate groups and I

7676
01:56:26,470 --> 01:56:26,480
between these two separate groups and I
 

7677
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:28,069
between these two separate groups and I
think one of these schisms has been

7678
01:56:28,069 --> 01:56:28,079
think one of these schisms has been
 

7679
01:56:28,079 --> 01:56:30,030
think one of these schisms has been
conservatives reluctancy to participate

7680
01:56:30,030 --> 01:56:30,040
conservatives reluctancy to participate
 

7681
01:56:30,040 --> 01:56:32,709
conservatives reluctancy to participate
in things related to higher uh education

7682
01:56:32,709 --> 01:56:32,719
in things related to higher uh education
 

7683
01:56:32,719 --> 01:56:34,109
in things related to higher uh education
uh so for a long time conservatives are

7684
01:56:34,109 --> 01:56:34,119
uh so for a long time conservatives are
 

7685
01:56:34,119 --> 01:56:35,669
uh so for a long time conservatives are
saying like oh you know the educational

7686
01:56:35,669 --> 01:56:35,679
saying like oh you know the educational
 

7687
01:56:35,679 --> 01:56:37,149
saying like oh you know the educational
institutions are against us you know

7688
01:56:37,149 --> 01:56:37,159
institutions are against us you know
 

7689
01:56:37,159 --> 01:56:38,430
institutions are against us you know
Russ lb talks about how evil the

7690
01:56:38,430 --> 01:56:38,440
Russ lb talks about how evil the
 

7691
01:56:38,440 --> 01:56:39,950
Russ lb talks about how evil the
colleges are and blah blah blah and then

7692
01:56:39,950 --> 01:56:39,960
colleges are and blah blah blah and then
 

7693
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:41,229
colleges are and blah blah blah and then
what happens is is conservatives are

7694
01:56:41,229 --> 01:56:41,239
what happens is is conservatives are
 

7695
01:56:41,239 --> 01:56:42,990
what happens is is conservatives are
less and less willing to engage in them

7696
01:56:42,990 --> 01:56:43,000
less and less willing to engage in them
 

7697
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:44,830
less and less willing to engage in them
so then you get this scenario or this

7698
01:56:44,830 --> 01:56:44,840
so then you get this scenario or this
 

7699
01:56:44,840 --> 01:56:46,030
so then you get this scenario or this
environment where everybody that's

7700
01:56:46,030 --> 01:56:46,040
environment where everybody that's
 

7701

like even more into their insane
directions uh I feel like that's a big

7748
01:57:29,149 --> 01:57:29,159
directions uh I feel like that's a big
 

7749
01:57:29,159 --> 01:57:30,550
directions uh I feel like that's a big
problem that we run into in the country

7750
01:57:30,550 --> 01:57:30,560
problem that we run into in the country
 

7751
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:32,030
problem that we run into in the country
to where conservatives have totally

7752
01:57:32,030 --> 01:57:32,040
to where conservatives have totally
 

7753
01:57:32,040 --> 01:57:34,109
to where conservatives have totally
broken off some conversations broken

7754
01:57:34,109 --> 01:57:34,119
broken off some conversations broken
 

7755
01:57:34,119 --> 01:57:35,310
broken off some conversations broken
away from where they won't participate

7756
01:57:35,310 --> 01:57:35,320
away from where they won't participate
 

7757
01:57:35,320 --> 01:57:36,669
away from where they won't participate
in them anymore and then the people that

7758
01:57:36,669 --> 01:57:36,679
in them anymore and then the people that
 

7759
01:57:36,679 --> 01:57:38,510
in them anymore and then the people that
you have left just run as as far to the

7760
01:57:38,510 --> 01:57:38,520
you have left just run as as far to the
 

7761
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:40,189
you have left just run as as far to the
left as possible certainly when you look

7762
01:57:40,189 --> 01:57:40,199
left as possible certainly when you look
 

7763
01:57:40,199 --> 01:57:41,669
left as possible certainly when you look
at certain institutions I think that one

7764
01:57:41,669 --> 01:57:41,679
at certain institutions I think that one
 

7765
01:57:41,679 --> 01:57:43,030
at certain institutions I think that one
of the things that people on both sides

7766
01:57:43,030 --> 01:57:43,040
of the things that people on both sides
 

7767
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:44,229
of the things that people on both sides
of the aisle are constantly looking at

7768
01:57:44,229 --> 01:57:44,239
of the aisle are constantly looking at
 

7769
01:57:44,239 --> 01:57:46,470
of the aisle are constantly looking at
is has the institution suffered such

7770
01:57:46,470 --> 01:57:46,480
is has the institution suffered such
 

7771
01:57:46,480 --> 01:57:48,470
is has the institution suffered such
capture that there is just no capacity

7772
01:57:48,470 --> 01:57:48,480
capture that there is just no capacity
 

7773
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:50,390
capture that there is just no capacity
to fix it and when you talk about the

7774
01:57:50,390 --> 01:57:50,400
to fix it and when you talk about the
 

7775
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:51,830
to fix it and when you talk about the
universities I'm not going to blame

7776
01:57:51,830 --> 01:57:51,840
universities I'm not going to blame
 

7777
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:53,030
universities I'm not going to blame
conservatives for the failure of the

7778
01:57:53,030 --> 01:57:53,040
conservatives for the failure of the
 

7779
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:54,550
conservatives for the failure of the
universities because they haven't been

7780

universities because they haven't been
 

7781
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:56,390

7846
01:58:56,910 --> 01:58:56,920
of these things but you're acting like a
 

7847
01:58:56,920 --> 01:58:58,750
of these things but you're acting like a
jackass and what you see in the late

7848
01:58:58,750 --> 01:58:58,760
jackass and what you see in the late
 

7849
01:58:58,760 --> 01:59:00,950
jackass and what you see in the late

7850
01:59:00,950 --> 01:59:00,960
1960s and early 1970s is in fact the
 

7851
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:02,709
1960s and early 1970s is in fact the
collapse of these institutions to the

7852
01:59:02,709 --> 01:59:02,719
collapse of these institutions to the
 

7853
01:59:02,719 --> 01:59:04,149
collapse of these institutions to the
point where by the time I was going to

7854
01:59:04,149 --> 01:59:04,159
point where by the time I was going to
 

7855
01:59:04,159 --> 01:59:05,709
point where by the time I was going to
college there was this radical

7856
01:59:05,709 --> 01:59:05,719
college there was this radical
 

7857
01:59:05,719 --> 01:59:07,430
college there was this radical
disproportion between conservatives and

7858
01:59:07,430 --> 01:59:07,440
disproportion between conservatives and
 

7859
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:08,750
disproportion between conservatives and
liberals and the problem is that when it

7860
01:59:08,750 --> 01:59:08,760
liberals and the problem is that when it
 

7861
01:59:08,760 --> 01:59:10,990
liberals and the problem is that when it
comes to a system like the universities

7862
01:59:10,990 --> 01:59:11,000
comes to a system like the universities
 

7863
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:11,830
comes to a system like the universities
basically you have to separate the

7864
01:59:11,830 --> 01:59:11,840
basically you have to separate the
 

7865
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:12,950
basically you have to separate the
universities off into two separate

7866
01:59:12,950 --> 01:59:12,960
universities off into two separate
 

7867
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:14,669
universities off into two separate
categories one is stem where the

7868
01:59:14,669 --> 01:59:14,679
categories one is stem where the
 

7869
01:59:14,679 --> 01:59:16,470
categories one is stem where the
universities are still pretty damn good

7870
01:59:16,470 --> 01:59:16,480
universities are still pretty damn good
 

7871
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:17,669
universities are still pretty damn good
American universities when it comes to

7872
01:59:17,669 --> 01:59:17,679
American universities when it comes to
 

7873
01:59:17,679 --> 01:59:19,870
American universities when it comes to
stem are still leading universities in

7874
01:59:19,870 --> 01:59:19,880

the world Harvard's main Creations these
 

7877
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:23,750
the world Harvard's main Creations these
days are coming from actual hard science

7878
01:59:23,750 --> 01:59:23,760
days are coming from actual hard science

Fields then you have the liberal arts

7880
01:59:26,030 --> 01:59:26,040
Fields then you have the liberal arts

01:59:26,040 --> 01:59:27,790
Fields then you have the liberal arts
field in which you basically have a

field in which you basically have a
 

7883
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:29,430
field in which you basically have a
self-perpetuating elite because that's

self-perpetuating elite because that's

01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:31,350
self-perpetuating elite because that's
actually how dissertations work if you

7886
01:59:31,350 --> 01:59:31,360
actually how dissertations work if you
 

7887
01:59:31,360 --> 01:59:32,550
actually how dissertations work if you
have somebody who's very far to the left

Sciences in prestigious positions was
 

7967
02:00:35,159 --> 02:00:37,550

due to possibly two factors that people

due to possibly two factors that people

were refusing to talk about one was the
 

7971
02:00:39,639 --> 02:00:41,790
were refusing to talk about one was the
possibility that women actually didn't

possibility that women actually didn't
 

7973
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:43,149

02:00:44,760 --> 02:00:48,109
the rates that men do which happens to

you certainly were not allowed to talk

7982
02:00:50,950 --> 02:00:50,960
you certainly were not allowed to talk
 

7983
02:00:50,960 --> 02:00:52,990
you certainly were not allowed to talk
about the idea that that the men's bell

7984
02:00:52,990 --> 02:00:53,000
about the idea that that the men's bell
 

7985
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:54,629
about the idea that that the men's bell
curve when it comes to IQ particularly

7986
02:00:54,629 --> 02:00:54,639
curve when it comes to IQ particularly
 

7987
02:00:54,639 --> 02:00:56,149
curve when it comes to IQ particularly
on stem subjects tends to be shallower

7988
02:00:56,149 --> 02:00:56,159
on stem subjects tends to be shallower
 

7989
02:00:56,159 --> 02:00:57,069
on stem subjects tends to be shallower
than the women's bell curves when you

7990
02:00:57,069 --> 02:00:57,079
than the women's bell curves when you
 

7991
02:00:57,079 --> 02:00:58,270
than the women's bell curves when you
get to the very end of the bell curve

7992
02:00:58,270 --> 02:00:58,280
get to the very end of the bell curve
 

7993
02:00:58,280 --> 02:00:59,750
get to the very end of the bell curve
what you tend to see is a lot of really

7994
02:00:59,750 --> 02:00:59,760
what you tend to see is a lot of really
 

7995
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:01,350
what you tend to see is a lot of really
dumb guys and a lot of really smart guys

7996
02:01:01,350 --> 02:01:01,360
dumb guys and a lot of really smart guys
 

7997
02:01:01,360 --> 02:01:02,430
dumb guys and a lot of really smart guys
and so when you're talking about the top

7998
02:01:02,430 --> 02:01:02,440
and so when you're talking about the top
 

7999
02:01:02,440 --> 02:01:04,189
and so when you're talking about the top
universities maybe that has something to

8000
02:01:04,189 --> 02:01:04,199
universities maybe that has something to
 

8001
02:01:04,199 --> 02:01:05,910
universities maybe that has something to
do with the disproportion and he's

8002
02:01:05,910 --> 02:01:05,920
do with the disproportion and he's
 

8003
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:07,709
do with the disproportion and he's
trying to explain that to say that our

8004
02:01:07,709 --> 02:01:07,719
trying to explain that to say that our
 

8005
02:01:07,719 --> 02:01:09,030
trying to explain that to say that our
systems are not discriminating if we end

8006
02:01:09,030 --> 02:01:09,040
systems are not discriminating if we end
 

8007
02:01:09,040 --> 02:01:10,189
systems are not discriminating if we end
up with more men than women maybe more

8008
02:01:10,189 --> 02:01:10,199
up with more men than women maybe more
 

8009
02:01:10,199 --> 02:01:11,510
up with more men than women maybe more
men are applying and more men are

8010
02:01:11,510 --> 02:01:11,520
men are applying and more men are
 

8011
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:13,109
men are applying and more men are
qualified that's that's quite he was

8012
02:01:13,109 --> 02:01:13,119
qualified that's that's quite he was
 

8013
02:01:13,119 --> 02:01:15,990
qualified that's that's quite he was
ousted for that by a left-wing faculty

8014
02:01:15,990 --> 02:01:16,000
ousted for that by a left-wing faculty
 

8015
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:19,069
ousted for that by a left-wing faculty
and and you know General Alum Network at

8016
02:01:19,069 --> 02:01:19,079
and and you know General Alum Network at
 

8017
02:01:19,079 --> 02:01:21,069
and and you know General Alum Network at
at Harvard University so there's a lot

8018
02:01:21,069 --> 02:01:21,079
at Harvard University so there's a lot
 

8019
02:01:21,079 --> 02:01:22,109
at Harvard University so there's a lot
to blame conservatives for for

8020
02:01:22,109 --> 02:01:22,119
to blame conservatives for for
 

8021
02:01:22,119 --> 02:01:23,510
to blame conservatives for for
surrendering the playing field I totally

8022
02:01:23,510 --> 02:01:23,520
surrendering the playing field I totally
 

8023
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:24,709
surrendering the playing field I totally
agree that conservatives should not have

8024
02:01:24,709 --> 02:01:24,719
agree that conservatives should not have
 

8025
02:01:24,719 --> 02:01:26,189
agree that conservatives should not have
surrendered the playing field in some

8026
02:01:26,189 --> 02:01:26,199
surrendered the playing field in some
 

8027
02:01:26,199 --> 02:01:28,030
surrendered the playing field in some
institutions colleges were surrendered a

8028
02:01:28,030 --> 02:01:28,040
institutions colleges were surrendered a
 

8029
02:01:28,040 --> 02:01:29,350
institutions colleges were surrendered a
lot earlier than 20 years ago they were

8030
02:01:29,350 --> 02:01:29,360
lot earlier than 20 years ago they were
 

8031
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:30,950
lot earlier than 20 years ago they were
surrendered in the late 1960s early

8032
02:01:30,950 --> 02:01:30,960
surrendered in the late 1960s early
 

8033
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:33,790
surrendered in the late 1960s early
1970s yeah so I think that um a couple

8034
02:01:33,790 --> 02:01:33,800
1970s yeah so I think that um a couple
 

8035
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:35,950
1970s yeah so I think that um a couple
things so uh one of the big issues that

8036
02:01:35,950 --> 02:01:35,960
things so uh one of the big issues that
 

8037
02:01:35,960 --> 02:01:37,629
things so uh one of the big issues that
I have with kind of like this uh I don't

8038
02:01:37,629 --> 02:01:37,639
I have with kind of like this uh I don't
 

8039
02:01:37,639 --> 02:01:39,430
I have with kind of like this uh I don't
know if we call it error of trumpism or

8040
02:01:39,430 --> 02:01:39,440
know if we call it error of trumpism or
 

8041
02:01:39,440 --> 02:01:42,189
know if we call it error of trumpism or
populism is this total disregard for

8042
02:01:42,189 --> 02:01:42,199
populism is this total disregard for
 

8043
02:01:42,199 --> 02:01:44,149
populism is this total disregard for
institutions and this disconnect from

8044
02:01:44,149 --> 02:01:44,159
institutions and this disconnect from
 

8045
02:01:44,159 --> 02:01:45,830
institutions and this disconnect from
participation in the system so it's one

8046
02:01:45,830 --> 02:01:45,840
participation in the system so it's one
 

8047
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:46,669
participation in the system so it's one
of the big things that I F with

8048
02:01:46,669 --> 02:01:46,679
of the big things that I F with
 

8049
02:01:46,679 --> 02:01:48,189
of the big things that I F with
progressives about who who cares cuz

8050
02:01:48,189 --> 02:01:48,199
progressives about who who cares cuz
 

8051
02:01:48,199 --> 02:01:49,189
progressives about who who cares cuz
they're all 20 years old they don't vote

8052
02:01:49,189 --> 02:01:49,199
they're all 20 years old they don't vote
 

8053
02:01:49,199 --> 02:01:50,709
they're all 20 years old they don't vote
anyway um but it's another thing that I

8054
02:01:50,709 --> 02:01:50,719
anyway um but it's another thing that I
 

8055
02:01:50,719 --> 02:01:53,629
anyway um but it's another thing that I
Noti with a lot of people that are uh

this idea where we say this institution

8060
02:01:58,510 --> 02:01:58,520
this idea where we say this institution
 

8061
02:01:58,520 --> 02:02:00,430
this idea where we say this institution
is uh irrevocably destroyed it it's

8062
02:02:00,430 --> 02:02:00,440
is uh irrevocably destroyed it it's
 

8063
02:02:00,440 --> 02:02:02,109
is uh irrevocably destroyed it it's
irredeemable it can't be saved it can't

8064
02:02:02,109 --> 02:02:02,119
irredeemable it can't be saved it can't
 

8065
02:02:02,119 --> 02:02:04,910
irredeemable it can't be saved it can't
nothing that we do can can fix it um and

8066
02:02:04,910 --> 02:02:04,920
nothing that we do can can fix it um and
 

8067
02:02:04,920 --> 02:02:06,189
nothing that we do can can fix it um and
I think that what that leads people to

8068
02:02:06,189 --> 02:02:06,199
I think that what that leads people to
 

8069
02:02:06,199 --> 02:02:08,310
I think that what that leads people to
doing is one they disconnect further and

doing is one they disconnect further and
 

8071
02:02:08,320 --> 02:02:10,950
doing is one they disconnect further and
then two there's a general hopelessness

8072
02:02:10,950 --> 02:02:10,960
then two there's a general hopelessness
 

8073
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:12,510
then two there's a general hopelessness

think that when you start driving people

8084
02:02:21,030 --> 02:02:21,040
think that when you start driving people
 

8085
02:02:21,040 --> 02:02:22,990
think that when you start driving people
into that direction all it does is it

8086
02:02:22,990 --> 02:02:23,000
into that direction all it does is it
 

8087
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:24,750
into that direction all it does is it
further amplifies all the problems that

02:02:24,750 --> 02:02:24,760
further amplifies all the problems that

02:02:24,760 --> 02:02:26,910
further amplifies all the problems that
you're complaining about so that's one

you're complaining about so that's one
 

8091
02:02:26,920 --> 02:02:27,790
you're complaining about so that's one
of the reasons why when we talk about

of the reasons why when we talk about
 

8093
02:02:27,800 --> 02:02:29,550
of the reasons why when we talk about
like conservative participation I want

8094
02:02:29,550 --> 02:02:29,560
like conservative participation I want
 

8095
02:02:29,560 --> 02:02:31,189
like conservative participation I want
there to be more conservatives that are

8096
02:02:31,189 --> 02:02:31,199
there to be more conservatives that are
 

8097
02:02:31,199 --> 02:02:32,589
there to be more conservatives that are
trying to participate in Academia but I

leading speaking out against it is
 

8103
02:02:36,400 --> 02:02:37,390
leading speaking out against it is
basically saying it's a waste of time

basically saying it's a waste of time
 

8105
02:02:37,400 --> 02:02:38,790

it's completely lost so I I think that
 

8107
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:40,390
it's completely lost so I I think that
the alternative to that is that the you

8177
02:03:37,320 --> 02:03:38,589
degrees up is so wild and crazy there's
so many jobs in the United States that

8178
02:03:38,589 --> 02:03:38,599
so many jobs in the United States that
 

8179
02:03:38,599 --> 02:03:40,229
so many jobs in the United States that
should not require a college degree that

8180
02:03:40,229 --> 02:03:40,239
should not require a college degree that
 

8181
02:03:40,239 --> 02:03:41,550
should not require a college degree that
we now require a college degree to do

8182
02:03:41,550 --> 02:03:41,560
we now require a college degree to do
 

8183
02:03:41,560 --> 02:03:42,830
we now require a college degree to do
because there was this weird idea that

02:03:42,840 --> 02:03:44,950
because there was this weird idea that

correlation for causation they would say

8188
02:03:46,750 --> 02:03:46,760
correlation for causation they would say
 

8189
02:03:46,760 --> 02:03:48,069
correlation for causation they would say
oh look people who go to college are

8190
02:03:48,069 --> 02:03:48,079
oh look people who go to college are
 

8191
02:03:48,079 --> 02:03:49,030
oh look people who go to college are
making more money than people who don't

8192
02:03:49,030 --> 02:03:49,040
making more money than people who don't
 

8193
02:03:49,040 --> 02:03:50,549
making more money than people who don't
go to college therefore everyone should

8194
02:03:50,549 --> 02:03:50,559
go to college therefore everyone should
 

8195
02:03:50,559 --> 02:03:53,149
go to college therefore everyone should
go to college well maybe the reason is

8196
02:03:53,149 --> 02:03:53,159
go to college well maybe the reason is
 

8197
02:03:53,159 --> 02:03:55,030
go to college well maybe the reason is
because people who are going to college

8198
02:03:55,030 --> 02:03:55,040
because people who are going to college
 

8199
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:56,629
because people who are going to college
were better qualified for particular

8200
02:03:56,629 --> 02:03:56,639
were better qualified for particular
 

8201
02:03:56,639 --> 02:03:58,750
were better qualified for particular
jobs because on average not all the time

8202
02:03:58,750 --> 02:03:58,760
jobs because on average not all the time
 

8203
02:03:58,760 --> 02:03:59,870
jobs because on average not all the time
but on average a lot of those people

8204
02:03:59,870 --> 02:03:59,880
but on average a lot of those people
 

8205
02:03:59,880 --> 02:04:01,189
but on average a lot of those people
were smarter and making more money

8206
02:04:01,189 --> 02:04:01,199
were smarter and making more money
 

8207
02:04:01,199 --> 02:04:02,950
were smarter and making more money
because of that and so all you've done

8208
02:04:02,950 --> 02:04:02,960
because of that and so all you've done
 

8209
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:04,109
because of that and so all you've done
is you've now created these additional

8210

02:06:19,800 --> 02:06:21,709
then throw them overboard I think that
some of that is earned by people who are

8364
02:06:21,709 --> 02:06:21,719
some of that is earned by people who are
 

8365
02:06:21,719 --> 02:06:23,270
some of that is earned by people who are
in positions of power at institutions

8366
02:06:23,270 --> 02:06:23,280
in positions of power at institutions
 

8367
02:06:23,280 --> 02:06:25,510
in positions of power at institutions
who have completely undermined the faith

8368
02:06:25,510 --> 02:06:25,520
who have completely undermined the faith
 

8369
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:27,510
who have completely undermined the faith
and credibility of those institutions I

8370
02:06:27,510 --> 02:06:27,520
and credibility of those institutions I
 

8371
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:29,069
and credibility of those institutions I
think you have to examine institution by

8372
02:06:29,069 --> 02:06:29,079
think you have to examine institution by
 

8373
02:06:29,079 --> 02:06:30,589
think you have to examine institution by
institutions which ones are salvageable

8374
02:06:30,589 --> 02:06:30,599
institutions which ones are salvageable
 

8375
02:06:30,599 --> 02:06:32,069
institutions which ones are salvageable
and which ones are not so I'm not a a

8376
02:06:32,069 --> 02:06:32,079
and which ones are not so I'm not a a
 

8377
02:06:32,079 --> 02:06:34,149
and which ones are not so I'm not a a
full anti- disestablishmentarianism I'd

8378
02:06:34,149 --> 02:06:34,159
full anti- disestablishmentarianism I'd
 

8379
02:06:34,159 --> 02:06:35,790
full anti- disestablishmentarianism I'd
be partially in that camp there are

8380
02:06:35,790 --> 02:06:35,800
be partially in that camp there are
 

8381
02:06:35,800 --> 02:06:37,109
be partially in that camp there are
certain institutions like higher

8382
02:06:37,109 --> 02:06:37,119
certain institutions like higher
 

8383
02:06:37,119 --> 02:06:38,709
certain institutions like higher
education in the liberal arts that I

8384
02:06:38,709 --> 02:06:38,719
education in the liberal arts that I
 

8385
02:06:38,719 --> 02:06:40,350
education in the liberal arts that I
think we may be better off without and

8386
02:06:40,350 --> 02:06:40,360
think we may be better off without and
 

8387
02:06:40,360 --> 02:06:41,910
think we may be better off without and
then there are certain institutions like

8388
02:06:41,910 --> 02:06:41,920
then there are certain institutions like
 

8389
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:43,549
then there are certain institutions like
say participation American government

8390
02:06:43,549 --> 02:06:43,559
say participation American government
 

8391
02:06:43,559 --> 02:06:44,910
say participation American government
where when people talk about we need a

8429
02:07:14,119 --> 02:07:16,350
Biden would and then I think that he
would tear out the face of the

8430
02:07:16,350 --> 02:07:16,360
would tear out the face of the
 

8431

think that his use of executive power
 

8441
02:07:25,719 --> 02:07:27,270
think that his use of executive power
was greater than that of Donald Trump

8442
02:07:27,270 --> 02:07:27,280
was greater than that of Donald Trump
 

8443
02:07:27,280 --> 02:07:29,030
was greater than that of Donald Trump
the power that he had he used to Greater

again thrashed up against the sides of

8448
02:07:31,790 --> 02:07:31,800
again thrashed up against the sides of
 

8449
02:07:31,800 --> 02:07:34,109
again thrashed up against the sides of
the box but could not get out of it okay

8450
02:07:34,109 --> 02:07:34,119
the box but could not get out of it okay
 

8451
02:07:34,119 --> 02:07:36,030
the box but could not get out of it okay
um for just on real quick because on the

8452
02:07:36,030 --> 02:07:36,040
um for just on real quick because on the
 

8453
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:37,510
um for just on real quick because on the
that that answer went a lot further than

8454
02:07:37,510 --> 02:07:37,520
that that answer went a lot further than
 

8455
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:39,069
that that answer went a lot further than
the initial question but yeah just on

8456
02:07:39,069 --> 02:07:39,079
the initial question but yeah just on
 

8457
02:07:39,079 --> 02:07:40,750
the initial question but yeah just on
the real quick thing the reason why I

8458
02:07:40,750 --> 02:07:40,760
the real quick thing the reason why I
 

8459
02:07:40,760 --> 02:07:42,270
the real quick thing the reason why I
again my main problem that I feel like

8460
02:07:42,270 --> 02:07:42,280
again my main problem that I feel like
 

8461
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:43,470
again my main problem that I feel like
we have today in society is people are

8462
02:07:43,470 --> 02:07:43,480
we have today in society is people are
 

8463
02:07:43,480 --> 02:07:44,750
we have today in society is people are
getting into their own bubbles the idea

8464
02:07:44,750 --> 02:07:44,760
getting into their own bubbles the idea
 

8465
02:07:44,760 --> 02:07:46,390
getting into their own bubbles the idea
of having like conservative schools and

8466
02:07:46,390 --> 02:07:46,400
of having like conservative schools and
 

8467
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:47,790
of having like conservative schools and
liberal schools seems like the saddest

8468
02:07:47,790 --> 02:07:47,800
liberal schools seems like the saddest
 

8469
02:07:47,800 --> 02:07:49,629
liberal schools seems like the saddest
thing in the world to me like I would

8470
02:07:49,629 --> 02:07:49,639
thing in the world to me like I would
 

8471
02:07:49,639 --> 02:07:51,310
thing in the world to me like I would
want conservatives and liberals going to

8472
02:07:51,310 --> 02:07:51,320
want conservatives and liberals going to
 

8473
02:07:51,320 --> 02:07:52,549
want conservatives and liberals going to
school together because I think these

8474
02:07:52,549 --> 02:07:52,559
school together because I think these
 

8475
02:07:52,559 --> 02:07:53,750
school together because I think these
people need to interact with each other

8476
02:07:53,750 --> 02:07:53,760
people need to interact with each other
 

8477
02:07:53,760 --> 02:07:55,109
people need to interact with each other
more if for no other reason than to say

8478
02:07:55,109 --> 02:07:55,119
more if for no other reason than to say
 

8479
02:07:55,119 --> 02:07:56,629
more if for no other reason than to say
that the other person is not like an

8480
02:07:56,629 --> 02:07:56,639
that the other person is not like an
 

8481
02:07:56,639 --> 02:07:58,549
that the other person is not like an
actual monstrous horrible entity that

8482
02:07:58,549 --> 02:07:58,559
actual monstrous horrible entity that
 

8483
02:07:58,559 --> 02:08:00,030
actual monstrous horrible entity that
wants to destroy the country listen I

8484
02:08:00,030 --> 02:08:00,040
wants to destroy the country listen I
 

8485
02:08:00,040 --> 02:08:01,430
wants to destroy the country listen I
think a classically liberal idea for

8486
02:08:01,430 --> 02:08:01,440
think a classically liberal idea for
 

8487
02:08:01,440 --> 02:08:02,629
think a classically liberal idea for
many schools would not be a bad thing I

8488
02:08:02,629 --> 02:08:02,639
many schools would not be a bad thing I
 

8489
02:08:02,639 --> 02:08:03,589
many schools would not be a bad thing I
think it would be a good thing I just

8490
02:08:03,589 --> 02:08:03,599
think it would be a good thing I just
 

8491
02:08:03,599 --> 02:08:05,149
think it would be a good thing I just
wonder if that's salvageable and if it's

8492
02:08:05,149 --> 02:08:05,159
wonder if that's salvageable and if it's
 

8493
02:08:05,159 --> 02:08:06,950
wonder if that's salvageable and if it's
not salvageable then the answer to that

8494
02:08:06,950 --> 02:08:06,960
not salvageable then the answer to that
 

8495
02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:08,669
not salvageable then the answer to that
is to actually create alter in I feel

8496
02:08:08,669 --> 02:08:08,679
is to actually create alter in I feel
 

8497
02:08:08,679 --> 02:08:09,910
is to actually create alter in I feel
like I feel like the biggest issue that

8498
02:08:09,910 --> 02:08:09,920
like I feel like the biggest issue that
 

8499
02:08:09,920 --> 02:08:12,270
like I feel like the biggest issue that
we have is people are they sort into

8500
02:08:12,270 --> 02:08:12,280
we have is people are they sort into
 

8501
02:08:12,280 --> 02:08:14,069
we have is people are they sort into
these different like Phantom worlds to

8502
02:08:14,069 --> 02:08:14,079
these different like Phantom worlds to
 

8503
02:08:14,079 --> 02:08:15,589
these different like Phantom worlds to
where even if you live in the same city

8504
02:08:15,589 --> 02:08:15,599
where even if you live in the same city
 

8505
02:08:15,599 --> 02:08:16,669
where even if you live in the same city
there are totally different worlds that

8506
02:08:16,669 --> 02:08:16,679
there are totally different worlds that
 

8507
02:08:16,679 --> 02:08:17,910
there are totally different worlds that
exist between liberals and conservatives

8508
02:08:17,910 --> 02:08:17,920
exist between liberals and conservatives
 

8509
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:19,149
exist between liberals and conservatives
and I feel like one of the barriers to

8510
02:08:19,149 --> 02:08:19,159
and I feel like one of the barriers to
 

8511
02:08:19,159 --> 02:08:20,669
and I feel like one of the barriers to
people understanding the other side

8512
02:08:20,669 --> 02:08:20,679
people understanding the other side
 

8513
02:08:20,679 --> 02:08:21,830
people understanding the other side
sometimes it's just a little bit of

8514
02:08:21,830 --> 02:08:21,840
sometimes it's just a little bit of
 

8515
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:23,629
sometimes it's just a little bit of
information or a little bit of like

8516
02:08:23,629 --> 02:08:23,639
information or a little bit of like
 

8517
02:08:23,639 --> 02:08:26,030
information or a little bit of like
firsthand experience um when I so in

8518
02:08:26,030 --> 02:08:26,040

something that's really important is we

something that's really important is we
 

8757

children are being discussed or not um
 

8761
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:04,629
children are being discussed or not um
because I think once you introduce the

8762
02:12:04,629 --> 02:12:04,639
because I think once you introduce the
 

8763
02:12:04,639 --> 02:12:06,589
because I think once you introduce the
child aspect I think the style or the

8764
02:12:06,589 --> 02:12:06,599
child aspect I think the style or the
 

8765
02:12:06,599 --> 02:12:07,709
child aspect I think the style or the
type of relationship that you do is

8766
02:12:07,709 --> 02:12:07,719
type of relationship that you do is
 

8767
02:12:07,719 --> 02:12:09,510
type of relationship that you do is
going to become way more important than

8768
02:12:09,510 --> 02:12:09,520
going to become way more important than
 

8769
02:12:09,520 --> 02:12:11,750
going to become way more important than
whatever exists prior to that um like I

8770
02:12:11,750 --> 02:12:11,760
whatever exists prior to that um like I
 

8771
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:13,149
whatever exists prior to that um like I
would agree for instance for in terms of

8772
02:12:13,149 --> 02:12:13,159
would agree for instance for in terms of
 

8773
02:12:13,159 --> 02:12:14,870
would agree for instance for in terms of
what Ben is saying that um there's

8774
02:12:14,870 --> 02:12:14,880
what Ben is saying that um there's
 

8775
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:16,510
what Ben is saying that um there's
probably going to be some structure that

8776
02:12:16,510 --> 02:12:16,520
probably going to be some structure that
 

8777
02:12:16,520 --> 02:12:18,950
probably going to be some structure that
is ideal for the care and the raising of

8778
02:12:18,950 --> 02:12:18,960
is ideal for the care and the raising of
 

8779
02:12:18,960 --> 02:12:20,990
is ideal for the care and the raising of
a child um I think that having a child

8780
02:12:20,990 --> 02:12:21,000
a child um I think that having a child
 

8781
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:22,830
a child um I think that having a child
gives you a much bigger Buy in to

8782
02:12:22,830 --> 02:12:22,840
gives you a much bigger Buy in to
 

8783
02:12:22,840 --> 02:12:24,229
gives you a much bigger Buy in to
society because now all of a sudden you

8784
02:12:24,229 --> 02:12:24,239
society because now all of a sudden you
 

8785
02:12:24,239 --> 02:12:25,229
society because now all of a sudden you
care about a lot of things that you

8786
02:12:25,229 --> 02:12:25,239
care about a lot of things that you
 

8787
02:12:25,239 --> 02:12:26,709
care about a lot of things that you
might not have before because not only

8788
02:12:26,709 --> 02:12:26,719
might not have before because not only
 

8789
02:12:26,719 --> 02:12:28,149
might not have before because not only
do you exist in society you can't just

8790
02:12:28,149 --> 02:12:28,159
do you exist in society you can't just
 

8791
02:12:28,159 --> 02:12:29,669
do you exist in society you can't just
run uh now you've got a child that

8792
02:12:29,669 --> 02:12:29,679
run uh now you've got a child that
 

8793
02:12:29,679 --> 02:12:30,790
run uh now you've got a child that
exists there and you've got to ensure

8794
02:12:30,790 --> 02:12:30,800
exists there and you've got to ensure
 

8795
02:12:30,800 --> 02:12:32,229
exists there and you've got to ensure
that everything functions smoothly not

8796
02:12:32,229 --> 02:12:32,239
that everything functions smoothly not
 

8797
02:12:32,239 --> 02:12:34,430
that everything functions smoothly not
just for you but for that child as well

8798
02:12:34,430 --> 02:12:34,440
just for you but for that child as well
 

8799
02:12:34,440 --> 02:12:36,629
just for you but for that child as well
um and arguably although we're getting

8800
02:12:36,629 --> 02:12:36,639
um and arguably although we're getting
 

8801
02:12:36,639 --> 02:12:38,390
um and arguably although we're getting
into weird places I guess in the world

8802
02:12:38,390 --> 02:12:38,400
into weird places I guess in the world
 

8803
02:12:38,400 --> 02:12:40,870
into weird places I guess in the world
now like children are the primary

8804
02:12:40,870 --> 02:12:40,880
now like children are the primary

02:12:43,559 --> 02:12:45,709
transmit like cultural values and
everything um the one kind of weird

02:12:45,709 --> 02:12:45,719
everything um the one kind of weird
 

8811
02:12:45,719 --> 02:12:47,229
everything um the one kind of weird
thing that we're coming up against that

8812
02:12:47,229 --> 02:12:47,239
thing that we're coming up against that
 

8813
02:12:47,239 --> 02:12:49,669
thing that we're coming up against that
we have been coming up up against um now

8814
02:12:49,669 --> 02:12:49,679
we have been coming up up against um now
 

8815
02:12:49,679 --> 02:12:50,950
we have been coming up up against um now
for for some number of decades and we'll

8816
02:12:50,950 --> 02:12:50,960
for for some number of decades and we'll
 

8817
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:54,189
for for some number of decades and we'll
continue to is as societies progress

I think it's really important to have
mental safeguards for bad opinions um so

9058
02:16:52,990 --> 02:16:53,000
mental safeguards for bad opinions um so
 

9059
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:54,469
mental safeguards for bad opinions um so
for instance like a couple things that

9060
02:16:54,469 --> 02:16:54,479
for instance like a couple things that
 

9061
02:16:54,479 --> 02:16:56,309
for instance like a couple things that
I'll ask myself is for a particular

I'll ask myself is for a particular
 

9063
02:16:56,319 --> 02:16:57,870

debate that I'm having like can I argue

9064
02:16:57,870 --> 02:16:57,880
debate that I'm having like can I argue
 

9065
02:16:57,880 --> 02:16:59,469
debate that I'm having like can I argue
convincingly both sides of the debate if

9066
02:16:59,469 --> 02:16:59,479
convincingly both sides of the debate if
 

9067
02:16:59,479 --> 02:17:00,750
convincingly both sides of the debate if
I can't I won't bother having the debate

9068
02:17:00,750 --> 02:17:00,760
I can't I won't bother having the debate
 

9069
02:17:00,760 --> 02:17:02,230
I can't I won't bother having the debate
because I realize that I'm probably too

9070
02:17:02,230 --> 02:17:02,240
because I realize that I'm probably too
 

9071
02:17:02,240 --> 02:17:03,830
because I realize that I'm probably too
partisan dug in if I can't even

9072
02:17:03,830 --> 02:17:03,840
partisan dug in if I can't even
 

9073
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:06,309
partisan dug in if I can't even
represent like an opposite argument here

9074
02:17:06,309 --> 02:17:06,319
represent like an opposite argument here
 

9075
02:17:06,319 --> 02:17:07,709
represent like an opposite argument here
um another question that you might ask

9076
02:17:07,709 --> 02:17:07,719
um another question that you might ask
 

9077
02:17:07,719 --> 02:17:08,870
um another question that you might ask
yourself is like well what would it take

9078
02:17:08,870 --> 02:17:08,880
yourself is like well what would it take
 

9079
02:17:08,880 --> 02:17:09,990
yourself is like well what would it take
to convince you out of a certain

9080
02:17:09,990 --> 02:17:10,000
to convince you out of a certain
 

9081
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,150
to convince you out of a certain
position um if you know if you feel very

9082
02:17:12,150 --> 02:17:12,160
position um if you know if you feel very
 

9083
02:17:12,160 --> 02:17:14,469
position um if you know if you feel very
strongly that uh you know Medicare for

9084
02:17:14,469 --> 02:17:14,479
strongly that uh you know Medicare for
 

9085
02:17:14,479 --> 02:17:16,429
strongly that uh you know Medicare for
all is a good you know system by which

9086
02:17:16,429 --> 02:17:16,439
all is a good you know system by which
 

9087
02:17:16,439 --> 02:17:17,910
all is a good you know system by which
to run the United States Healthcare and

9088
02:17:17,910 --> 02:17:17,920
to run the United States Healthcare and
 

9089
02:17:17,920 --> 02:17:18,750
to run the United States Healthcare and
somebody says well what would it take

9090
02:17:18,750 --> 02:17:18,760
somebody says well what would it take
 

9091
02:17:18,760 --> 02:17:19,750
somebody says well what would it take
you to convince you otherwise if you

9092
02:17:19,750 --> 02:17:19,760
you to convince you otherwise if you
 

9093
02:17:19,760 --> 02:17:21,030
you to convince you otherwise if you
can't even fathom like what would it

9094
02:17:21,030 --> 02:17:21,040
can't even fathom like what would it
 

9095
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:21,950
can't even fathom like what would it
take you to convince me otherwise you're

9096
02:17:21,950 --> 02:17:21,960
take you to convince me otherwise you're
 

9097
02:17:21,960 --> 02:17:23,830
take you to convince me otherwise you're
probably too dug into a position so I

9098
02:17:23,830 --> 02:17:23,840
probably too dug into a position so I
 

9099
02:17:23,840 --> 02:17:26,110
probably too dug into a position so I
think if you go through life saying like

9100
02:17:26,110 --> 02:17:26,120
think if you go through life saying like
 

9101
02:17:26,120 --> 02:17:28,790
think if you go through life saying like
well I try my best to be unbiased rather

9102
02:17:28,790 --> 02:17:28,800
well I try my best to be unbiased rather
 

9103
02:17:28,800 --> 02:17:30,790
well I try my best to be unbiased rather
than saying I try to best my best to be

9104
02:17:30,790 --> 02:17:30,800
than saying I try to best my best to be
 

9105
02:17:30,800 --> 02:17:32,870
than saying I try to best my best to be
aware of my biases because the latter is

9106
02:17:32,870 --> 02:17:32,880
aware of my biases because the latter is
 

9107
02:17:32,880 --> 02:17:34,070
aware of my biases because the latter is
more realistic in the former is

9108
02:17:34,070 --> 02:17:34,080
more realistic in the former is
 

9109
02:17:34,080 --> 02:17:35,389
more realistic in the former is
literally impossible unless you're a

9110
02:17:35,389 --> 02:17:35,399
literally impossible unless you're a
 

9111
02:17:35,399 --> 02:17:37,549
literally impossible unless you're a
computer uh yeah so I think having like

9112
02:17:37,549 --> 02:17:37,559
computer uh yeah so I think having like
 

9113
02:17:37,559 --> 02:17:39,870
computer uh yeah so I think having like
actual mental practices that you engage

9114
02:17:39,870 --> 02:17:39,880
actual mental practices that you engage
 

9115
02:17:39,880 --> 02:17:42,309
actual mental practices that you engage
in to try to counter some of the biases

9116
02:17:42,309 --> 02:17:42,319
in to try to counter some of the biases
 

9117
02:17:42,319 --> 02:17:43,549
in to try to counter some of the biases
that you have is more important than

9118
02:17:43,549 --> 02:17:43,559
that you have is more important than
 

9119
02:17:43,559 --> 02:17:44,709
that you have is more important than
trying to pretend that you're free of

9120
02:17:44,709 --> 02:17:44,719
trying to pretend that you're free of
 

9121
02:17:44,719 --> 02:17:46,389
trying to pretend that you're free of
all biases and then consuming all your

9122
02:17:46,389 --> 02:17:46,399
all biases and then consuming all your
 

9123
02:17:46,399 --> 02:17:49,429
all biases and then consuming all your
media from One Source yeah Ben uh so I

9124
02:17:49,429 --> 02:17:49,439
media from One Source yeah Ben uh so I
 

9125
02:17:49,439 --> 02:17:50,709
media from One Source yeah Ben uh so I
mean I agree with a lot of that I I

9126
02:17:50,709 --> 02:17:50,719
mean I agree with a lot of that I I
 

9127
02:17:50,719 --> 02:17:52,589
mean I agree with a lot of that I I
think that the easiest practical guide

9128
02:17:52,589 --> 02:17:52,599
think that the easiest practical guide
 

9129
02:17:52,599 --> 02:17:53,990
think that the easiest practical guide
is read a bunch of different things from

9130
02:17:53,990 --> 02:17:54,000
is read a bunch of different things from
 

9131
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:55,429
is read a bunch of different things from
a bunch of different sources and where

9132
02:17:55,429 --> 02:17:55,439
a bunch of different sources and where
 

9133
02:17:55,439 --> 02:17:58,150
a bunch of different sources and where
they cross is probably the set of fact

9134
02:17:58,150 --> 02:17:58,160
they cross is probably the set of fact
 

9135
02:17:58,160 --> 02:18:00,030
they cross is probably the set of fact
and then everything else is extrapolated

9136
02:18:00,030 --> 02:18:00,040
and then everything else is extrapolated
 

9137
02:18:00,040 --> 02:18:02,309
