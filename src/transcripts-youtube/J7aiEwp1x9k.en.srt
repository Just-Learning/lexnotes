00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:17,399
my lifestyle actually on that first trip
 

641
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,509
my lifestyle actually on that first trip
as well something else that I probably

642
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:18,519
as well something else that I probably
 

643
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:19,910
as well something else that I probably
shouldn't have been allowed to do was go

644
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:19,920
shouldn't have been allowed to do was go
 

645
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,189
shouldn't have been allowed to do was go
to Chernobyl yeah so

646
00:12:22,189 --> 00:12:22,199
to Chernobyl yeah so
 

647
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,949
to Chernobyl yeah so
Chernobyl I believe troops came through

648
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:24,959
Chernobyl I believe troops came through
 

649
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,790
Chernobyl I believe troops came through
bellarus and there was some fighting

650
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:26,800
bellarus and there was some fighting
 

651
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,189
bellarus and there was some fighting
going on in Chernobyl I think the whole

652
00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:29,199
going on in Chernobyl I think the whole
 

653
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:31,030
going on in Chernobyl I think the whole
World got concerned at that point if any

654
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,040
World got concerned at that point if any
 

655
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,150
World got concerned at that point if any
sort of radiation leaked but Chernobyl

656
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,160
sort of radiation leaked but Chernobyl
 

657
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,870
sort of radiation leaked but Chernobyl
as it stands the troops backed down and

658
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:36,880
as it stands the troops backed down and
 

659
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,550
as it stands the troops backed down and
it's completely covered in Minds very

660
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:39,560
it's completely covered in Minds very
 

661
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,629
it's completely covered in Minds very
very difficult to go to go to Cho

662
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:41,639
very difficult to go to go to Cho
 

663
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:45,030
very difficult to go to go to Cho

guess a idiot like myself should really
 

667
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:49,389
guess a idiot like myself should really
probably not be allowed in a place like

to see it under these conditions very
 

709
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,990
to see it under these conditions very
very strange yeah what was that like so

710
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:37,000
very strange yeah what was that like so
 

711
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,710
very strange yeah what was that like so

00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:41,760
completely empty I guess it's kind of
 

715
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,230
completely empty I guess it's kind of
like the fantasy you have I I imagine

716
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:44,240
like the fantasy you have I I imagine
 

717
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,269
like the fantasy you have I I imagine
people going tours of Chernobyl back in

718
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:46,279
people going tours of Chernobyl back in
 

719
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:47,750
people going tours of Chernobyl back in
the tourist days when it was a tourist

720
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:47,760
the tourist days when it was a tourist
 

721
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,470
the tourist days when it was a tourist
spot and it would be busy full of

722
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:49,480
spot and it would be busy full of
 

723
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,629
spot and it would be busy full of
tourists we got basically a private tour

tourists we got basically a private tour
 

725
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:54,710
tourists we got basically a private tour
so we got to really feel that abandoned

726
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:54,720
so we got to really feel that abandoned
 

727
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,670
so we got to really feel that abandoned
sort of Vibes I guess I was interested

sort of Vibes I guess I was interested
 

729
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,790
sort of Vibes I guess I was interested
in it from playing Call of Duty and then

730
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:58,800
in it from playing Call of Duty and then
 

731
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,150
in it from playing Call of Duty and then
right Chernobyl series all the

732
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:00,160
right Chernobyl series all the
 

733
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,550
right Chernobyl series all the
documentaries and stuff but very very

734
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:02,560
documentaries and stuff but very very
 

735
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,269
documentaries and stuff but very very
strange place to go visit and it is now

736
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:05,279
strange place to go visit and it is now
 

737
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,150
strange place to go visit and it is now
a Minefield like a lot of parts of

738
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:07,160
a Minefield like a lot of parts of
 

739
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,030
a Minefield like a lot of parts of
Ukraine that's one of

740
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,040
Ukraine that's one of
 

741
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,269
Ukraine that's one of
the dark terrifying aspects of war is

742
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:14,279
the dark terrifying aspects of war is
 

743
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:16,749
the dark terrifying aspects of war is
how many mines are left even when the

744
00:14:16,749 --> 00:14:16,759
how many mines are left even when the
 

745
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:19,990
how many mines are left even when the
war ends for decades after there's mines

746
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,000
war ends for decades after there's mines
 

747
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,310
war ends for decades after there's mines
everywhere because Dem mining is

748
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:21,320
everywhere because Dem mining is
 

749
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,550
everywhere because Dem mining is
extremely difficult and

750
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:24,560
extremely difficult and
 

751
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,269
extremely difficult and
that that could continually kill people

752
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:28,279
that that could continually kill people
 

753
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:30,269
that that could continually kill people
I don't think it'll be a spot for a very

754
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:30,279
I don't think it'll be a spot for a very
 

755
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:31,389
I don't think it'll be a spot for a very
long time because if you were thinking

756
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:31,399
long time because if you were thinking
 

757
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:33,310
long time because if you were thinking
about areas to demine when the conflict

758
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:33,320
about areas to demine when the conflict
 

759
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,350
about areas to demine when the conflict
ends an area where if you accidentally

760
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:35,360
ends an area where if you accidentally
 

761
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,389
ends an area where if you accidentally
trigger a mine could cause a radiation

762
00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:37,399
trigger a mine could cause a radiation
 

763
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:38,829
trigger a mine could cause a radiation
leag it's probably going to be very low

764
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:38,839
leag it's probably going to be very low
 

765
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:42,470

the city and kerson used to be kind of
 

961
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,110
the city and kerson used to be kind of
like a beautiful beach city by the Neo

962
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:26,120
like a beautiful beach city by the Neo
 

963
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,230

that separat Ates Russia from uh well I
 

967
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,830
that separat Ates Russia from uh well I
guess the Russian land they've they've

968
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:34,840
guess the Russian land they've they've
 

969
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,350
guess the Russian land they've they've
taken from kerson so Kon split across

970
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:38,360
taken from kerson so Kon split across

00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:41,080
the other side of the river and
 

975
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,549
the other side of the river and
ukrainians on this side so very very

976
00:18:43,549 --> 00:18:43,559
ukrainians on this side so very very
 

977
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:46,110
ukrainians on this side so very very
dangerous spot K makes a lot of press

978
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:46,120
dangerous spot K makes a lot of press
 

979
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,990
dangerous spot K makes a lot of press
because of the longrange missiles that

980
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:48,000
because of the longrange missiles that
 

981
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,350
because of the longrange missiles that
hit but kon's just being hit all the

982
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:50,360
hit but kon's just being hit all the
 

983
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,190
hit but kon's just being hit all the
time so we took this tour we went along

984
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:53,200
time so we took this tour we went along
 

985
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,830
time so we took this tour we went along
the river we went to within 1 kilometer

986
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:55,840
the river we went to within 1 kilometer
 

987
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,990
the river we went to within 1 kilometer
of the front line so that was the

988
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:57,000
of the front line so that was the
 

989
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,510
of the front line so that was the
closest we got after this point we heard

990
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:01,520
closest we got after this point we heard
 

991
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,789
closest we got after this point we heard
artillery strike and because you're in

992
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:04,799
artillery strike and because you're in
 

993
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,549
artillery strike and because you're in
an armored vehicle it sounds further

994
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:07,559
an armored vehicle it sounds further
 

995
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:09,789
an armored vehicle it sounds further
away than it is obviously the sound

996
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:09,799
away than it is obviously the sound
 

997
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:12,950
away than it is obviously the sound
doesn't get in so I thought it sounded

998
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:12,960
doesn't get in so I thought it sounded
 

999
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,950
doesn't get in so I thought it sounded
far away we could see some smoke that

1000
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:14,960
far away we could see some smoke that
 

1001
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,350
far away we could see some smoke that
actually appeared closer in the distance

1002
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:16,360
actually appeared closer in the distance
 

1003
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,669
actually appeared closer in the distance
the guy driving us took us to a point

1004
00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:18,679
the guy driving us took us to a point
 

1005
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:21,230
the guy driving us took us to a point
where a large building was blocking us

1006
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:21,240
where a large building was blocking us
 

1007
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,029
where a large building was blocking us
from I guess the angle at which the

1008
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:23,039
from I guess the angle at which the
 

1009
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,950
from I guess the angle at which the
missile would have came from and I

1010
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:24,960
missile would have came from and I
 

1011
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,270
missile would have came from and I
thought well I thought everything was

1012
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:26,280
thought well I thought everything was
 

1013
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,350
thought well I thought everything was
cool thought it was that must have been

1014
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:28,360
cool thought it was that must have been
 

1015
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,270
cool thought it was that must have been
off the disc distance and then we heard

1016
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:30,280
off the disc distance and then we heard
 

1017
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,110
off the disc distance and then we heard
two more strikes hit very very close

1018
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,120
two more strikes hit very very close
 

1019
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,430
two more strikes hit very very close
they sounded really loud and then I

1020
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:35,440
they sounded really loud and then I
 

1021
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,310
they sounded really loud and then I
think um he's radio in to see if

1022
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:37,320
think um he's radio in to see if
 

1023
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,950
think um he's radio in to see if
everything's safe if we can leave this

1024
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:38,960
everything's safe if we can leave this
 

1025
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,110
everything's safe if we can leave this
point and then we basically race back

1026
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,120
point and then we basically race back
 

1027
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,909
point and then we basically race back
but we kind I started to realize we're

1028
00:19:42,909 --> 00:19:42,919
but we kind I started to realize we're
 

1029
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:44,549
but we kind I started to realize we're
in danger at any point where he really

1030
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:44,559
in danger at any point where he really
 

1031
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,830
in danger at any point where he really
sped the car up or sort of took sort of

1032
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:46,840
sped the car up or sort of took sort of
 

1033
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,430
sped the car up or sort of took sort of
evasive movements in the car but we got

1034
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:48,440
evasive movements in the car but we got
 

1035
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,270
evasive movements in the car but we got
out of there and I think I had someone

1036
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:50,280
out of there and I think I had someone
 

1037
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,029
out of there and I think I had someone
translate it later and basically yeah he

1038
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:53,039
translate it later and basically yeah he
 

1039
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,270
translate it later and basically yeah he
was checking to see if the roads were

1040
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:54,280
was checking to see if the roads were
 

1041
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,350
was checking to see if the roads were
clear for us to leave ultimately it

1042
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:56,360
clear for us to leave ultimately it
 

1043
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,990
clear for us to leave ultimately it
ended up being someone died and a people

00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:01,240
injured from that blast which was less
 

1047
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,029
injured from that blast which was less
than half a kilometer from us and

1048
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:04,039
than half a kilometer from us and
 

1049
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:05,710

00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:10,240
the shooting range to basically give us
 

1215
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,110
the shooting range to basically give us
10 minutes or so so we could take the

1216
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:13,120
10 minutes or so so we could take the
 

1217
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,029
10 minutes or so so we could take the
photos I don't know if they didn't wait

00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:18,480
long but they started firing at the
 

1223
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,549
long but they started firing at the
targets anyway and then the ricochets

1224
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:20,559
targets anyway and then the ricochets
 

1225
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,830
targets anyway and then the ricochets

1233
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,390
here obviously not much safety concerns
at that point but we survived basically

1234
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:32,400
at that point but we survived basically
 

1235
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,470
at that point but we survived basically
artillery strikes we survived a bit of

1236
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:34,480
artillery strikes we survived a bit of
 

1237
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,830
artillery strikes we survived a bit of
friendly fire with the bullets coming

00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:35,840
friendly fire with the bullets coming
 

1239

perspective on like those they feel
different to the regular people fighting

1440
00:27:24,029 --> 00:27:24,039
different to the regular people fighting
 

1441
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:26,909
different to the regular people fighting
in Ukraine from my perspective yeah

1442
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:26,919
in Ukraine from my perspective yeah

yeah like Japan was coming for Australia
 

1447
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,909
yeah like Japan was coming for Australia
I guess in World War II they attacked

1448
00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:33,919
I guess in World War II they attacked
 

1449
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,990
I guess in World War II they attacked
the north but really there was no foot

1450
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:37,000
the north but really there was no foot
 

1451
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,549
the north but really there was no foot
battle and there was no soldiers on the

1452
00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:38,559
battle and there was no soldiers on the
 

1453
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,389
battle and there was no soldiers on the
ground within Australia guess us too

1454
00:27:41,389 --> 00:27:41,399
ground within Australia guess us too
 

1455
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:42,830
ground within Australia guess us too
during World War II so it's like a

1456
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:42,840
during World War II so it's like a
 

1457
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,310
during World War II so it's like a
completely different

1458
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:44,320
completely different
 

1459
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,549
completely different
perspective from our recent histories

1460
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:46,559
perspective from our recent histories
 

1461
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,789
perspective from our recent histories
compared to like if you were a Ukrainian

1462
00:27:49,789 --> 00:27:49,799
compared to like if you were a Ukrainian
 

1463
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:52,590
compared to like if you were a Ukrainian
and there's Russians within the defined

1464
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:52,600
and there's Russians within the defined
 

1465
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,149
and there's Russians within the defined
border their responsibility to protect

1466
00:27:55,149 --> 00:27:55,159
border their responsibility to protect
 

1467
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:57,190
border their responsibility to protect
their Homeland and their family is just

1468
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:57,200
their Homeland and their family is just
 

1469
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,269
their Homeland and their family is just
something you can't imagine but also

1470
00:28:00,269 --> 00:28:00,279
something you can't imagine but also
 

1471
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:01,789
something you can't imagine but also
after having spent time with them you

1472
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:01,799
after having spent time with them you
 

1473
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:04,310
after having spent time with them you
can see why they feel such a strong

1474
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:04,320
can see why they feel such a strong
 

1475
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,029
can see why they feel such a strong
sense of obligation to protect uh to

1476
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:07,039
sense of obligation to protect uh to
 

1477
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,789
sense of obligation to protect uh to
protect Ukraine protect their family and

00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:11,960
friends and in a lot of cases
 

1481
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,990
friends and in a lot of cases
uh the the soldiers are using their own

1482
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:15,000
uh the the soldiers are using their own
 

1483
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,310
uh the the soldiers are using their own
funds to buy

1484
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:17,320
funds to buy
 

1485
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,230
funds to buy
equipment uh whether it's bullets

1486
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:19,240
equipment uh whether it's bullets
 

1487
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,710
equipment uh whether it's bullets
whether it's guns whether it's armor is

1488
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:21,720
whether it's guns whether it's armor is
 

1489
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,269
whether it's guns whether it's armor is
that's still what you saw yeah I mean in

1490
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:24,279
that's still what you saw yeah I mean in
 

1491
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:27,269
that's still what you saw yeah I mean in
terms of the weapons America provides

1492
00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:27,279
terms of the weapons America provides
 

1493
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,190
terms of the weapons America provides
weapons so we saw a wide selection of

1494
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:31,200
weapons so we saw a wide selection of
 

1495
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,389
weapons so we saw a wide selection of
weapons some of those would be old

1496
00:28:33,389 --> 00:28:33,399
weapons some of those would be old
 

1497
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:36,350
weapons some of those would be old
Soviet weapons like obviously the RPG we

shot and what we shot out of it is all
 

1501
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,870
shot and what we shot out of it is all
Soviet it's very old weaponry and then

1502
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:41,880
Soviet it's very old weaponry and then
 

1503
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,190
Soviet it's very old weaponry and then
you've got us weapons that have been

1504
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:44,200
you've got us weapons that have been
 

1505
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,430
you've got us weapons that have been
given as well but in terms of the basic

1506
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:46,440
given as well but in terms of the basic
 

1507
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,070
given as well but in terms of the basic
soldiers equipment like if they want

soldiers equipment like if they want
good quality stuff that might be the

1510
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:50,640
good quality stuff that might be the
 

1511
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,909
good quality stuff that might be the
difference between them surviving the

1512
00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:51,919
difference between them surviving the
 

1513
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,630
difference between them surviving the
winter or the summer just an extreme

1514
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:54,640
winter or the summer just an extreme
 

1515
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,630
winter or the summer just an extreme
temperature range like they have to pay

1516
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:56,640
temperature range like they have to pay
 

1517
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,789
temperature range like they have to pay
for that all themselves so they always

1518
00:28:58,789 --> 00:28:58,799
for that all themselves so they always
 

1519
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,070
for that all themselves so they always
joke about when foreign soldiers come

1533
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,789
from most countries is basically
supplied all the good quality standard

1534
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:15,799
supplied all the good quality standard
 

1535
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:17,710

the government but in Ukraine obviously
 

1539
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:22,750
the government but in Ukraine obviously
funding is very stretched so these guys

1540
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:22,760
funding is very stretched so these guys
 

1541
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,269
funding is very stretched so these guys
to have the best equipment they have to

1542
00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:25,279
to have the best equipment they have to
 

1543
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,430
to have the best equipment they have to
basically find money to pay for it

1544
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:27,440
basically find money to pay for it
 

1545
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,990
basically find money to pay for it
themselves and they'll do that by

1546
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:29,000
themselves and they'll do that by
 

1547
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,669
themselves and they'll do that by
seeking donations best way to get

1548
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:31,679
seeking donations best way to get
 

1549
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,909
seeking donations best way to get
donations would be to grow social media

1550
00:29:33,909 --> 00:29:33,919
donations would be to grow social media
 

1551
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,789
donations would be to grow social media
profiles so that's when you see a lot of

1552
00:29:35,789 --> 00:29:35,799
profiles so that's when you see a lot of
 

1553
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:37,669

and more
 

1599
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,110
and more
prevalent of consumer level cheap drones

1600
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,120
prevalent of consumer level cheap drones
 

1601
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,710
prevalent of consumer level cheap drones
can you speak to that have you seen have

1602
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:30,720
can you speak to that have you seen have
 

1603
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,310
can you speak to that have you seen have
you seen the use of fbv fpv drones yeah

1604
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:33,320
you seen the use of fbv fpv drones yeah
 

1605
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,350
you seen the use of fbv fpv drones yeah
so I mean basically like a $300 to $500

1606
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:35,360
so I mean basically like a $300 to $500
 

1607
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,269
so I mean basically like a $300 to $500
drone I think it's like carbon fiber 3D

1608
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:38,279
drone I think it's like carbon fiber 3D
 

1609
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:40,950
drone I think it's like carbon fiber 3D
printed they can add attach different

1610
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:40,960
printed they can add attach different
 

1611
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,430
printed they can add attach different
forms of Weaponry to it whether it's

1612
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:43,440
forms of Weaponry to it whether it's
 

1613
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,509
forms of Weaponry to it whether it's
just dropping a frag they could drop a

1614
00:30:45,509 --> 00:30:45,519
just dropping a frag they could drop a
 

1615
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:47,190
just dropping a frag they could drop a
mine out of it I know they were talking

1616
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:47,200
mine out of it I know they were talking
 

1617
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,630
mine out of it I know they were talking
about how they had a liquid that could

1618
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:49,640
about how they had a liquid that could
 

1619
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,070
about how they had a liquid that could
basically burn through sort of a lot of

1620
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:52,080
basically burn through sort of a lot of
 

1621
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,310
basically burn through sort of a lot of
cars and tanks so the person inside

1622
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:54,320
cars and tanks so the person inside
 

1623
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,269
cars and tanks so the person inside
would basically melt alive which sounds

1624
00:30:56,269 --> 00:30:56,279
would basically melt alive which sounds
 

1625
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:58,310
would basically melt alive which sounds
horrible but what's mind- blowing me you

1626
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:58,320
horrible but what's mind- blowing me you
 

1627

could have like a $3 million Russian
 

1629
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,110
could have like a $3 million Russian
tank that could be destroyed by a

1630
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:03,120
tank that could be destroyed by a
 

1631
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,470
tank that could be destroyed by a
$300 drone which is just crazy how fast

1632
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:06,480
$300 drone which is just crazy how fast
 

1633

elaborate uh massive drones I did see
 

1643
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:20,389
elaborate uh massive drones I did see
some higher budget bigger drones over

1644
00:31:20,389 --> 00:31:20,399
some higher budget bigger drones over
 

1645
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,029
some higher budget bigger drones over
there but for the most part those fpv

1646
00:31:22,029 --> 00:31:22,039
there but for the most part those fpv

1711
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:35,629
the beach and there was some tourists
there flying a drone and you just saw

1712
00:32:35,629 --> 00:32:35,639
there flying a drone and you just saw
 

1713
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:38,110
there flying a drone and you just saw
his instinctual reaction to that drone

1714
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:38,120
his instinctual reaction to that drone
 

1715
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:42,950
his instinctual reaction to that drone
sound in the sky flashback to

1716
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:42,960
sound in the sky flashback to
 

1717
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,590
sound in the sky flashback to
that currently they're all as far as I

1718
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:46,600
that currently they're all as far as I
 

1719
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,029
that currently they're all as far as I
know all human controlled so fpv but to

00:32:50,029 --> 00:32:50,039
know all human controlled so fpv but to

me increasingly terrifying notion is of

1722
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:53,240
me increasingly terrifying notion is of
 

1723
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,110
me increasingly terrifying notion is of
them becoming autonomous it's the best

1724
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:55,120
them becoming autonomous it's the best
 

1725
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,789
them becoming autonomous it's the best
way to defend against the Drone that's

1726
00:32:56,789 --> 00:32:56,799
way to defend against the Drone that's
 

1727
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,909
way to defend against the Drone that's
fpv controlled is for AI to be

1728
00:32:58,909 --> 00:32:58,919
fpv controlled is for AI to be
 

1729
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:01,269
fpv controlled is for AI to be
controlling that drone just have swarms

1730
00:33:01,269 --> 00:33:01,279
controlling that drone just have swarms
 

1731
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,310
controlling that drone just have swarms
of drones that are $500 controlled by AI

1732
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:04,320
of drones that are $500 controlled by AI
 

1733
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,509
of drones that are $500 controlled by AI
systems and that's

1734
00:33:06,509 --> 00:33:06,519
systems and that's
 

1735
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:09,029
systems and that's
a terrifying possibility that the future

1736
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:09,039
a terrifying possibility that the future
 

1737
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,710
a terrifying possibility that the future
of warfare is essentially swarms of

1738
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:10,720
of warfare is essentially swarms of
 

1739
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,230
of warfare is essentially swarms of
drones on both sides and then maybe

1740
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:13,240
drones on both sides and then maybe
 

1741
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,430
drones on both sides and then maybe
swarms of drones say between us and

1742
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:16,440
swarms of drones say between us and
 

1743
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,549
swarms of drones say between us and
China over Taiwan that would be wild

1744
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:18,559
China over Taiwan that would be wild
 

1745
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,789
China over Taiwan that would be wild
because I mean they do those crazy drone

1746
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:20,799
because I mean they do those crazy drone

L shows where they do those performances

1748
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:22,720
L shows where they do those performances
 

1749
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,750
L shows where they do those performances
with the lights and stuff so they're

1750
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:23,760
with the lights and stuff so they're
 

1751
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,669

of pre-programming those are
 

1755
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:29,750

00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:31,880
flight control of those is done
 

1759
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,070
flight control of those is done
autonomously but there's a interface for

1760
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,080
autonomously but there's a interface for
 

1761
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,909
autonomously but there's a interface for
doing the choreography that's hardcoded

1762
00:33:36,909 --> 00:33:36,919
doing the choreography that's hardcoded
 

1763
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:39,430
doing the choreography that's hardcoded
in but adding increasing levels of

00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:39,440
in but adding increasing levels of
 

1765
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,310
in but adding increasing levels of
intelligence to a drone where you can

1766
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:41,320
intelligence to a drone where you can
 

1767
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,310
intelligence to a drone where you can
detect another drone follow it and

1768
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:43,320
detect another drone follow it and
 

1769
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,190
detect another drone follow it and
defend yourself like in terms of the the

1770
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:46,200
defend yourself like in terms of the the
 

1771
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,950
defend yourself like in terms of the the
military on both sides of the Ukraine

1772
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:47,960
military on both sides of the Ukraine
 

1773
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,149
military on both sides of the Ukraine
war that's that's a that's a technology

1774
00:33:51,149 --> 00:33:51,159
war that's that's a that's a technology
 

1775
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:52,990
war that's that's a that's a technology
that's like the Most Wanted technology

1776
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:53,000
that's like the Most Wanted technology
 

1777
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,149
that's like the Most Wanted technology
is drone defense like how do you defend

1778
00:33:55,149 --> 00:33:55,159
is drone defense like how do you defend
 

1779
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:57,430
is drone defense like how do you defend
against drones on both sides and anybody

1780
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:57,440
against drones on both sides and anybody
 

1781
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,350
against drones on both sides and anybody
that come up with an autonomous drone

1782
00:33:59,350 --> 00:33:59,360
that come up with an autonomous drone
 

1783
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,350
that come up with an autonomous drone
technology is going toh help whichever

1784
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:02,360
technology is going toh help whichever
 

1785
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,789
technology is going toh help whichever
side uses that technology to gain a

1786
00:34:03,789 --> 00:34:03,799
side uses that technology to gain a
 

1787
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:05,470
side uses that technology to gain a
military advantage and so there's a huge

1788
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:05,480
military advantage and so there's a huge
 

1789
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,470
military advantage and so there's a huge
incentive to build that technology but

1790
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:07,480
incentive to build that technology but
 

1791
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,430
incentive to build that technology but
then of course once both sides are

1792
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:09,440
then of course once both sides are
 

1793
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,950
then of course once both sides are
starting using that technology then

1794
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:10,960
starting using that technology then
 

1795
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,869
starting using that technology then
there's swarms of autonomous drones who

1796
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:13,879
there's swarms of autonomous drones who
 

1797
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:16,869
there's swarms of autonomous drones who
don't give a about humans just

1798
00:34:16,869 --> 00:34:16,879
don't give a about humans just
 

1799
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:19,230
don't give a about humans just
killing everything in sight on both

1800
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:19,240
killing everything in sight on both
 

1801
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,510
killing everything in sight on both
sides and that that that's that's

1802
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:21,520
sides and that that that's that's
 

1803
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,510
sides and that that that's that's
terrifying there civilian deaths that

1804
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:24,520
terrifying there civilian deaths that
 

1805
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,109
terrifying there civilian deaths that
are possible that are terrifying

1806
00:34:26,109 --> 00:34:26,119
are possible that are terrifying
 

1807
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:29,069
are possible that are terrifying
especially when you look 10 20 30 40 50

1808
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:29,079
especially when you look 10 20 30 40 50
 

1809
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:31,230
especially when you look 10 20 30 40 50
years from now yes I mean surreal like

1810
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:31,240
years from now yes I mean surreal like
 

1811
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,030
years from now yes I mean surreal like
when we went to Kon he was like uh the

1812
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:33,040
when we went to Kon he was like uh the
 

1813
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,310
when we went to Kon he was like uh the
entire sky is just full of full of

1814
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:36,320
entire sky is just full of full of
 

1815
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,310
entire sky is just full of full of
drones at any given time they could

1816
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:38,320
drones at any given time they could
 

1817
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,750
drones at any given time they could
decide to come and attack so like just

1818
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:40,760
decide to come and attack so like just
 

1819
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,710
decide to come and attack so like just
the they could just sit there forever

1820
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:42,720
the they could just sit there forever
 

1821
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,149
the they could just sit there forever
waiting waiting for you to come out of

1822
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:44,159
waiting waiting for you to come out of
 

1823
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,710
waiting waiting for you to come out of
that building they'll wait a long time

1824
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:46,720
that building they'll wait a long time
 

1825
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,950
that building they'll wait a long time
when someone goes and hides inside or

1826
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:48,960
when someone goes and hides inside or
 

1827
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,389
when someone goes and hides inside or
potentially if it's open window fly

1828
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:50,399
potentially if it's open window fly
 

1829
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:51,550
potentially if it's open window fly
straight through the open window to get

1830
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:51,560
straight through the open window to get
 

1831
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,190
straight through the open window to get
it to get people yeah so you're not even

1832
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:53,200
it to get people yeah so you're not even
 

1833
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,069
it to get people yeah so you're not even
safe indoors yeah there's nowhere to

1834
00:34:55,069 --> 00:34:55,079
safe indoors yeah there's nowhere to
 

1835
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:57,430
safe indoors yeah there's nowhere to
hide and they can wait for a very very

1836
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:57,440
hide and they can wait for a very very
 

1837
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,310
hide and they can wait for a very very
long time and as far as I know even

1838
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:00,320
long time and as far as I know even
 

1839
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,150
long time and as far as I know even
politicians like you're in danger

1840
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:02,160
politicians like you're in danger
 

1841
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,589
politicians like you're in danger
everywhere in

1842
00:35:03,589 --> 00:35:03,599
everywhere in
 

1843
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,230
everywhere in
Ukraine so if if you want to do a public

1844
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:06,240
Ukraine so if if you want to do a public
 

1845
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,190
Ukraine so if if you want to do a public
speaking thing and doing it outside

1846
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:08,200
speaking thing and doing it outside
 

1847
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,710
speaking thing and doing it outside
you're in danger because it's very

1848
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:09,720
you're in danger because it's very
 

1849
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,230
you're in danger because it's very
difficult to detect those drones it

1850
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:11,240
difficult to detect those drones it
 

1851
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,030
difficult to detect those drones it
could be anywhere so it's a

1852
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:14,040
could be anywhere so it's a
 

1853
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,030
could be anywhere so it's a
terrifying life where you don't know if

1854
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:17,040
terrifying life where you don't know if
 

1855
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,630
terrifying life where you don't know if
you're safe at any moment anywhere in

1856
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:18,640
you're safe at any moment anywhere in
 

1857
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,349
you're safe at any moment anywhere in
Ukraine well sure I mean it's crazy with

1858
00:35:20,349 --> 00:35:20,359
Ukraine well sure I mean it's crazy with
 

1859
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:22,390
Ukraine well sure I mean it's crazy with
what happened to Trump I thought maybe

1860
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:22,400
what happened to Trump I thought maybe
 

1861
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,069
what happened to Trump I thought maybe
the next attack on a public figure might

1862
00:35:25,069 --> 00:35:25,079
the next attack on a public figure might
 

1863
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:27,430
the next attack on a public figure might
come in the form of drone technology

1864
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:27,440
come in the form of drone technology
 

1865
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,670
come in the form of drone technology
something sort of something along those

1866
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:29,680
something sort of something along those
 

1867
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,030
something sort of something along those
lines I wonder how they protect against

1868
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:32,040
lines I wonder how they protect against
 

1869
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,710
lines I wonder how they protect against
that here if that happens just imagine

1870
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:35,720
that here if that happens just imagine
 

1871
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,430
that here if that happens just imagine
the insanity that would ensue cuz we

1872
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:38,440
the insanity that would ensue cuz we
 

1873
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,750
the insanity that would ensue cuz we
understand the idea of a gunman with a

1874
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:40,760
understand the idea of a gunman with a
 

1875
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:44,150
understand the idea of a gunman with a
rifle shooting somebody but just like a

1876
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:44,160
rifle shooting somebody but just like a
 

1877
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,550
rifle shooting somebody but just like a
drone they just imagine the conspiracy

1878
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:46,560
drone they just imagine the conspiracy
 

1879
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,630
drone they just imagine the conspiracy
theories who controlled that drone where

1880
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:48,640
theories who controlled that drone where
 

1881
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,230
theories who controlled that drone where
did it come from yeah and now everybody

1882
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:51,240
did it come from yeah and now everybody
 

1883
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,910
did it come from yeah and now everybody
I mean that would just cause chaos and

1884
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:53,920
I mean that would just cause chaos and
 

1885
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,910
I mean that would just cause chaos and
the range is ever increasing one of the

1886
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:55,920
the range is ever increasing one of the
 

1887
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,150
the range is ever increasing one of the
battalions in Ukraine cuz the those fpv

1888
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:58,160
battalions in Ukraine cuz the those fpv
 

1889
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,990
battalions in Ukraine cuz the those fpv
drones have short range pretty short

1890
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:00,000
drones have short range pretty short
 

1891
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,470
drones have short range pretty short
range but they were able to attach it to

1892
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:02,480
range but they were able to attach it to
 

1893
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,309
range but they were able to attach it to
one of the larger drones with a signal

1894
00:36:04,309 --> 00:36:04,319
one of the larger drones with a signal
 

1895
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:06,270
one of the larger drones with a signal
booster so that it could potentially go

1896
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:06,280
booster so that it could potentially go
 

1897
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,470
booster so that it could potentially go
up to 30 40 km into the distance so the

1898
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:09,480
up to 30 40 km into the distance so the
 

1899
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,230
up to 30 40 km into the distance so the
Drone that hits you could be flown by

1900
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:11,240
Drone that hits you could be flown by
 

1901
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,790
Drone that hits you could be flown by
someone so far away from you and if they

1902
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:13,800
someone so far away from you and if they
 

1903
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,710
someone so far away from you and if they
did that domestically that would be very

1904
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:16,720
did that domestically that would be very
 

1905
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,030
did that domestically that would be very
frightening to think of the sphere of

1906
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:19,040
frightening to think of the sphere of
 

1907
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,950
frightening to think of the sphere of
where it could have come from do they

1908
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:21,960
where it could have come from do they
 

1909
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,309
where it could have come from do they
when you talked to the soldiers there

1910
00:36:24,309 --> 00:36:24,319
when you talked to the soldiers there
 

1911
00:36:24,319 --> 00:36:26,670
when you talked to the soldiers there
did they have a hope or a vision how the

1912
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:26,680
did they have a hope or a vision how the
 

1913
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,349
did they have a hope or a vision how the
war will end

1914
00:36:28,349 --> 00:36:28,359
war will end
 

1915
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:30,910
war will end
not really it just see I guess it just

1916
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:30,920
not really it just see I guess it just
 

1917
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,150
not really it just see I guess it just
seems to everyone that it's sort of

1918
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:33,160
seems to everyone that it's sort of
 

1919
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,950
seems to everyone that it's sort of
there's going to be no middle ground

1920
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:35,960
there's going to be no middle ground
 

1921
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,230
there's going to be no middle ground
when I was there there's a kind of

1922
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:37,240
when I was there there's a kind of
 

1923
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,550
when I was there there's a kind of
optimism that they would be

1924
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:39,560
optimism that they would be
 

1925
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,349
optimism that they would be
victorious like

1926
00:36:42,349 --> 00:36:42,359
victorious like
 

1927
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:45,990
victorious like
definitively and uh so is there still

1928
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:46,000
definitively and uh so is there still
 

1929
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,309
definitively and uh so is there still
that optimism and

1930
00:36:48,309 --> 00:36:48,319
that optimism and
 

1931
00:36:48,319 --> 00:36:52,309
that optimism and
also are they ready for prolonged War I

1932
00:36:52,309 --> 00:36:52,319
also are they ready for prolonged War I
 

1933
00:36:52,319 --> 00:36:53,550
also are they ready for prolonged War I
mean I think it would be a soldier by

1934
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:53,560
mean I think it would be a soldier by
 

1935
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:57,069
mean I think it would be a soldier by
Soldier basis I know like um each of

1936
00:36:57,069 --> 00:36:57,079
Soldier basis I know like um each of
 

1937
00:36:57,079 --> 00:36:58,750
Soldier basis I know like um each of
them had a different perspective I

1938
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:58,760
them had a different perspective I
 

1939
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,270
them had a different perspective I
remember I would ask him about like in

1940
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:00,280
remember I would ask him about like in
 

1941
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,349
remember I would ask him about like in
terms of us politics and their fears cuz

1942
00:37:03,349 --> 00:37:03,359
terms of us politics and their fears cuz
 

1943
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:07,069
terms of us politics and their fears cuz
the first trip I went there us hadn't

1944
00:37:07,069 --> 00:37:07,079
the first trip I went there us hadn't
 

1945
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:09,470
the first trip I went there us hadn't
agreed to resupply weapons so it was a

1946
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:09,480
agreed to resupply weapons so it was a
 

1947
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,829
agreed to resupply weapons so it was a
very different feeling in the air there

1948
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:10,839
very different feeling in the air there
 

1949
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:13,109
very different feeling in the air there
of concern over what was going to happen

1950
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:13,119
of concern over what was going to happen
 

1951
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,150
of concern over what was going to happen
but they still remained quite optimistic

1952
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:15,160
but they still remained quite optimistic
 

1953
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,230
but they still remained quite optimistic
that no matter who got in they felt

1954
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:17,240
that no matter who got in they felt
 

1955
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:21,069
that no matter who got in they felt
would do the right thing but in terms of

1956
00:37:21,069 --> 00:37:21,079
would do the right thing but in terms of
 

1957
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:23,910
would do the right thing but in terms of
prolonged War most people think it's

1958
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:23,920
prolonged War most people think it's
 

1959
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,710
prolonged War most people think it's
going to go for a very long time like

1960
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:25,720
going to go for a very long time like
 

1961
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,230
going to go for a very long time like
the Children's Hospital that just uh was

1962
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:28,240
the Children's Hospital that just uh was
 

1963
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,829
the Children's Hospital that just uh was
bombed in ke anytime there's a moment

1964
00:37:30,829 --> 00:37:30,839
bombed in ke anytime there's a moment
 

1965
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:33,390
bombed in ke anytime there's a moment
like that that reignites everything and

1966
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:33,400
like that that reignites everything and
 

1967
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,510
like that that reignites everything and
I think it happens on both sides so I

1968
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:35,520
I think it happens on both sides so I
 

1969
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,870
I think it happens on both sides so I
know that there was an attack in uh

1970
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:38,880
know that there was an attack in uh
 

1971
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,790
know that there was an attack in uh
cremier there was an attack on a beach I

1972
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:41,800
cremier there was an attack on a beach I
 

1973
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,510
cremier there was an attack on a beach I
guess um and I don't know attacking the

1974
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:44,520
guess um and I don't know attacking the
 

1975
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,190
guess um and I don't know attacking the
hospital was retribution for that but

1976
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:46,200
hospital was retribution for that but
 

1977
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,950
hospital was retribution for that but
that's sort of the energy that is felt

1978
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:48,960
that's sort of the energy that is felt
 

1979
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,430
that's sort of the energy that is felt
like um they might have battle fatigue

1980
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:52,440
like um they might have battle fatigue
 

1981
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,670
like um they might have battle fatigue
but when something happens to civilians

1982
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:54,680
but when something happens to civilians
 

1983
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,270
but when something happens to civilians
especially kids on your side kind of

1984
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:58,280
especially kids on your side kind of
 

1985
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,230
especially kids on your side kind of
reinvigorates the energy to fight for as

1986
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:01,240
reinvigorates the energy to fight for as
 

1987
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,190
reinvigorates the energy to fight for as
long as necessary and in terms of a

1988
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:03,200
long as necessary and in terms of a
 

1989
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,309
long as necessary and in terms of a
case-by case basis one of my friends

1990
00:38:05,309 --> 00:38:05,319
case-by case basis one of my friends
 

1991
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:08,790
case-by case basis one of my friends
Demitri over there who transitu own jym

1992
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:08,800
Demitri over there who transitu own jym
 

1993
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,589
Demitri over there who transitu own jym
he was very passionate about it just

1994
00:38:10,589 --> 00:38:10,599
he was very passionate about it just
 

1995
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:12,109
he was very passionate about it just
because of the history like he brought

1996
00:38:12,109 --> 00:38:12,119
because of the history like he brought
 

1997
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:15,030
because of the history like he brought
out documents of his grandfather being

out documents of his grandfather being
executed by the USSR so I know that when

the war started he basically he took a a
 

2003
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:22,670
the war started he basically he took a a
bicycle helmet in his AK-47 and went out

for the streaming rights I can't comment
on what that number would be and then

2566
00:49:22,349 --> 00:49:22,359
on what that number would be and then
 

2567
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:24,549
on what that number would be and then
you go home despite having put in all

2568
00:49:24,549 --> 00:49:24,559
you go home despite having put in all
 

2569
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:26,829
you go home despite having put in all
that effort with only 6,000 and they

2570
00:49:26,829 --> 00:49:26,839
that effort with only 6,000 and they
 

2571
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:29,190
that effort with only 6,000 and they
basically the argument is you're paid an

2572
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:29,200
basically the argument is you're paid an
 

2573
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,870
basically the argument is you're paid an
exposure but again there's many ways to

2574
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:31,880
exposure but again there's many ways to
 

2575
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,390
exposure but again there's many ways to
expose yourself you know what I mean

2576
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:33,400
expose yourself you know what I mean
 

2577
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,870

2579
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,829
that's just one of the platforms to do
so yeah my problem was that they

2580
00:49:38,829 --> 00:49:38,839
so yeah my problem was that they
 

2581
00:49:38,839 --> 00:49:39,950
so yeah my problem was that they
announced they were going to go from

2582
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:39,960
announced they were going to go from
 

2583

but you might watch an ADCC match where
 

3203
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,870
but you might watch an ADCC match where
90 seconds of a 10-minute match is the

01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:03,880
90 seconds of a 10-minute match is the
 

3205
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,910
90 seconds of a 10-minute match is the
referee grabbing them bringing them back

something of a position that landed
 

3211
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,870
something of a position that landed
outside not only is that sort of boring

01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:14,880
outside not only is that sort of boring
 

3213
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,950
outside not only is that sort of boring
to me it and it sort of could be biased

3214
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:17,960
to me it and it sort of could be biased
 

3215
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,390
to me it and it sort of could be biased
you know like again it's happened to me

3216
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:19,400
you know like again it's happened to me
 

3217
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:22,390
you know like again it's happened to me
in events where like I've the ref's gone

3218
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:22,400
in events where like I've the ref's gone
 

3219
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,430
in events where like I've the ref's gone
stop I've stopped he's moved a little

3221
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:26,630
stop I've stopped he's moved a little
bit more and then the an adjustment in

3222
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:26,640
bit more and then the an adjustment in
 

3223
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:30,309
bit more and then the an adjustment in
the reset I mean it's cheating to a

3224
01:02:30,309 --> 01:02:30,319
the reset I mean it's cheating to a
 

3225
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:31,829
the reset I mean it's cheating to a
certain extent it's just more of an

3226
01:02:31,829 --> 01:02:31,839
certain extent it's just more of an
 

3227
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:33,990
certain extent it's just more of an
annoyance they bring it back they reset

3228
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:34,000
annoyance they bring it back they reset
 

3229
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,069
annoyance they bring it back they reset
it to the best of their ability in the

3230
01:02:35,069 --> 01:02:35,079
it to the best of their ability in the
 

3231
01:02:35,079 --> 01:02:38,309
it to the best of their ability in the

is a disadvantage to be pushed up
against the angled wall you're very

against the angled wall you're very
 

3239
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,069
against the angled wall you're very
easily taken down against the angled

yeah you and Tony Robbins are like this

3364
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:10,720
yeah you and Tony Robbins are like this
 

3365
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:13,190
yeah you and Tony Robbins are like this
same size at least but in terms of the

3366
01:05:13,190 --> 01:05:13,200
same size at least but in terms of the
 

3367
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,589
same size at least but in terms of the
training for obviously the athletes very

3368
01:05:15,589 --> 01:05:15,599
training for obviously the athletes very
 

3369
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:16,470
training for obviously the athletes very
difficult some of these guys have gone

3370
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:16,480
difficult some of these guys have gone
 

3371
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:17,950
difficult some of these guys have gone
out there and built their own angled

3372
01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:17,960
out there and built their own angled
 

3373
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:19,789
out there and built their own angled
walls yeah I saw that that's a cool

3374
01:05:19,789 --> 01:05:19,799
walls yeah I saw that that's a cool
 

3375
01:05:19,799 --> 01:05:21,349
walls yeah I saw that that's a cool
video that they're getting into that

3376
01:05:21,349 --> 01:05:21,359
video that they're getting into that
 

3377
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:22,549
video that they're getting into that
that's a smart thing to do there's a

3378
01:05:22,549 --> 01:05:22,559
that's a smart thing to do there's a
 

3379
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:24,349
that's a smart thing to do there's a
million dollars on the line you should

3380
01:05:24,349 --> 01:05:24,359
million dollars on the line you should
 

3381
01:05:24,359 --> 01:05:26,269
million dollars on the line you should
probably invest in that but also like a

3382
01:05:26,269 --> 01:05:26,279
probably invest in that but also like a
 

3383
01:05:26,279 --> 01:05:28,710
probably invest in that but also like a
new Surface that no one's competed on no

3384
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:28,720
new Surface that no one's competed on no
 

3385
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,470
new Surface that no one's competed on no
one's gamed it yet no one's like we're

3386
01:05:31,470 --> 01:05:31,480
one's gamed it yet no one's like we're
 

3387
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:34,549
one's gamed it yet no one's like we're
going to see it unfold like like when

3388
01:05:34,549 --> 01:05:34,559
going to see it unfold like like when
 

3389
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:36,069
going to see it unfold like like when
UFC when people started figuring out how

to use the C we're going to see this
 

3393
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:41,150
to use the C we're going to see this

behind a pay but I just don't think
 

3531
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:24,070
behind a pay but I just don't think
where they at yeah I think million

3532
01:08:24,070 --> 01:08:24,080
where they at yeah I think million
 

3533
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,709
where they at yeah I think million
dollars is a lot of money but the the

3534
01:08:25,709 --> 01:08:25,719
dollars is a lot of money but the the
 

3535
01:08:25,719 --> 01:08:27,870
dollars is a lot of money but the the
opportunity here because it's open and

3536
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:27,880
opportunity here because it's open and
 

3537
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:30,309

01:34:46,990 --> 01:34:47,000
would make a lot of sense I think it
 

4887
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:50,109

5236
01:41:33,709 --> 01:41:33,719
rounds it depends at what point in your
 

5237
01:41:33,719 --> 01:41:36,070
rounds it depends at what point in your
career you are you know like I think

5238
01:41:36,070 --> 01:41:36,080
career you are you know like I think
 

5239
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:38,430
career you are you know like I think
like someone like Niki Ryan might almost

5240
01:41:38,430 --> 01:41:38,440
like someone like Niki Ryan might almost
 

5241
01:41:38,440 --> 01:41:41,149
like someone like Niki Ryan might almost
train to technically too often and when

5242
01:41:41,149 --> 01:41:41,159
train to technically too often and when
 

5243
01:41:41,159 --> 01:41:42,470
train to technically too often and when
he comes to competition it's a

5244
01:41:42,470 --> 01:41:42,480
he comes to competition it's a
 

5245
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:44,790
he comes to competition it's a
confronting experience when someone hits

5246
01:41:44,790 --> 01:41:44,800
confronting experience when someone hits
 

5247
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:48,229
confronting experience when someone hits
him hard and he feels that pressure so I

5248
01:41:48,229 --> 01:41:48,239
him hard and he feels that pressure so I
 

5249
01:41:48,239 --> 01:41:49,669
him hard and he feels that pressure so I
think different people require different

5250
01:41:49,669 --> 01:41:49,679
think different people require different
 

5251
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:52,350
think different people require different
things when Nikki when Nicki Rod is

5252
01:41:52,350 --> 01:41:52,360
things when Nikki when Nicki Rod is
 

5253
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:54,550
things when Nikki when Nicki Rod is
breaking the spine of a 37y old father a

5254
01:41:54,550 --> 01:41:54,560
breaking the spine of a 37y old father a
 

5255
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,950
breaking the spine of a 37y old father a
three bus driver it might be time for

5256
01:41:56,950 --> 01:41:56,960
three bus driver it might be time for
 

5257
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:59,270
three bus driver it might be time for
him to train in a more technical manner

5258
01:41:59,270 --> 01:41:59,280
him to train in a more technical manner
 

5259
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:01,270
him to train in a more technical manner
so it's like you got to cater it to what

5260
01:42:01,270 --> 01:42:01,280
so it's like you got to cater it to what
 

5261
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:03,109
so it's like you got to cater it to what
they need and again depending on the

5262
01:42:03,109 --> 01:42:03,119
they need and again depending on the
 

5263
01:42:03,119 --> 01:42:04,550
they need and again depending on the
opponent it's a game of strategy you

5264
01:42:04,550 --> 01:42:04,560
opponent it's a game of strategy you
 

5265
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:08,390
opponent it's a game of strategy you
know like for me when I was more active

5266
01:42:08,390 --> 01:42:08,400
know like for me when I was more active
 

5267
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:10,910
know like for me when I was more active
I look at an opponent that I want that I

5268
01:42:10,910 --> 01:42:10,920
I look at an opponent that I want that I
 

5269
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:12,950
I look at an opponent that I want that I
could steal some clout from of which the

5270
01:42:12,950 --> 01:42:12,960
could steal some clout from of which the
 

5271
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:14,430
could steal some clout from of which the
clout you can make money and I think to

5272
01:42:14,430 --> 01:42:14,440
clout you can make money and I think to
 

5273
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:15,709
clout you can make money and I think to
myself what's the best rul set I can

5274
01:42:15,709 --> 01:42:15,719
myself what's the best rul set I can
 

5275
01:42:15,719 --> 01:42:18,510
myself what's the best rul set I can
beat him in mhm that's the strategy and

5276
01:42:18,510 --> 01:42:18,520
beat him in mhm that's the strategy and
 

5277
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:19,830
beat him in mhm that's the strategy and
then how would I beat him in that rule

5278
01:42:19,830 --> 01:42:19,840
then how would I beat him in that rule
 

5279
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:21,589
then how would I beat him in that rule
set so there's so many strategic layers

5280
01:42:21,589 --> 01:42:21,599
set so there's so many strategic layers
 

5281
01:42:21,599 --> 01:42:24,550
set so there's so many strategic layers
to to go above and beyond

provide excellent technique excellent
question and answer time and I think you

5358
01:43:58,589 --> 01:43:58,599
question and answer time and I think you
 

5359
01:43:58,599 --> 01:44:00,310
question and answer time and I think you
should roll a little bit for the most

5360
01:44:00,310 --> 01:44:00,320
should roll a little bit for the most
 

5361

it's just about like
 

6219
02:00:43,239 --> 02:00:45,790
it's just about like
uh it's how they train like it's a fight

6220
02:00:45,790 --> 02:00:45,800
uh it's how they train like it's a fight

6225
02:00:49,239 --> 02:00:53,030
it's just built in them they don't want
to concede an inch ever I think for MMA

6226
02:00:53,030 --> 02:00:53,040
to concede an inch ever I think for MMA
 

6227
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:55,629
to concede an inch ever I think for MMA
and wrestling that can be very very good

6228
02:00:55,629 --> 02:00:55,639
and wrestling that can be very very good
 

6229
02:00:55,639 --> 02:00:56,910
and wrestling that can be very very good
I think sometimes when those guys come

6230
02:00:56,910 --> 02:00:56,920
I think sometimes when those guys come
 

6231
02:00:56,920 --> 02:00:59,629
I think sometimes when those guys come
over to Jitsu specific events they get

6232
02:00:59,629 --> 02:00:59,639
over to Jitsu specific events they get
 

6233
02:00:59,639 --> 02:01:01,470
over to Jitsu specific events they get
leg lock they fall into traps overly

6234
02:01:01,470 --> 02:01:01,480
leg lock they fall into traps overly
 

6235
02:01:01,480 --> 02:01:03,709
leg lock they fall into traps overly
aggressive or overly evasive but I think

6236
02:01:03,709 --> 02:01:03,719
aggressive or overly evasive but I think
 

6237
02:01:03,719 --> 02:01:06,109
aggressive or overly evasive but I think
the way they train just is perfect for a

6238
02:01:06,109 --> 02:01:06,119
the way they train just is perfect for a
 

6239
02:01:06,119 --> 02:01:08,990
the way they train just is perfect for a
fight a fight they can just forward

6240
02:01:08,990 --> 02:01:09,000
fight a fight they can just forward
 

6241
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,189
fight a fight they can just forward
pressure eat some shots grind a guy

6242
02:01:11,189 --> 02:01:11,199
pressure eat some shots grind a guy
 

6243
02:01:11,199 --> 02:01:12,189
pressure eat some shots grind a guy
against the

6244
02:01:12,189 --> 02:01:12,199
against the
 

6245
02:01:12,199 --> 02:01:15,750
against the
wall fence resing is technical Jiu-Jitsu

6246
02:01:15,750 --> 02:01:15,760
wall fence resing is technical Jiu-Jitsu
 

6247
02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:18,589
wall fence resing is technical Jiu-Jitsu
is far more technical there's way more

6248
02:01:18,589 --> 02:01:18,599
is far more technical there's way more
 

6249
02:01:18,599 --> 02:01:20,149
is far more technical there's way more
things you can do in a grappling

6250
02:01:20,149 --> 02:01:20,159
things you can do in a grappling
 

6251
02:01:20,159 --> 02:01:21,990
things you can do in a grappling
scenario from top and bottom than I I

6252
02:01:21,990 --> 02:01:22,000
scenario from top and bottom than I I
 

6253
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,629
scenario from top and bottom than I I
think against the wall so a grinding

6254
02:01:24,629 --> 02:01:24,639
think against the wall so a grinding
 

6255
02:01:24,639 --> 02:01:26,950
think against the wall so a grinding
nature of how they train works really

6256
02:01:26,950 --> 02:01:26,960
nature of how they train works really
 

6257
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:29,270
nature of how they train works really
good to walk a guy down and take him

6258
02:01:29,270 --> 02:01:29,280
good to walk a guy down and take him
 

6259
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:31,310
good to walk a guy down and take him
down against the wall and then obviously

6260
02:01:31,310 --> 02:01:31,320
down against the wall and then obviously
 

6261
02:01:31,320 --> 02:01:33,830
down against the wall and then obviously
would ground and pound very good to hold

6262
02:01:33,830 --> 02:01:33,840
would ground and pound very good to hold
 

6263
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:36,870
would ground and pound very good to hold
a guy down so I think just never

6264
02:01:36,870 --> 02:01:36,880
a guy down so I think just never
 

6265
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:39,510
a guy down so I think just never
conceding an inch and training it's just

6266
02:01:39,510 --> 02:01:39,520
conceding an inch and training it's just
 

6267
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:41,510
conceding an inch and training it's just
they've done that since they were born

6268
02:01:41,510 --> 02:01:41,520
they've done that since they were born
 

6269
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:43,149
they've done that since they were born
basically so you learn how to grind

6270
02:01:43,149 --> 02:01:43,159
basically so you learn how to grind
 

6271
02:01:43,159 --> 02:01:44,589
basically so you learn how to grind
somebody down yeah like they're just

6272
02:01:44,589 --> 02:01:44,599
somebody down yeah like they're just
 

6273
02:01:44,599 --> 02:01:46,550
somebody down yeah like they're just
trying to break each other at all times

6274
02:01:46,550 --> 02:01:46,560
trying to break each other at all times
 

6275
02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:50,470
trying to break each other at all times
trying to have some dominance over other

6276
02:01:50,470 --> 02:01:50,480
trying to have some dominance over other
 

6277
02:01:50,480 --> 02:01:52,790
trying to have some dominance over other
over their friends and train with but

6278
02:01:52,790 --> 02:01:52,800
over their friends and train with but
 

6279
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:54,149
over their friends and train with but
you think in the grappling context

6280
02:01:54,149 --> 02:01:54,159
you think in the grappling context
 

6281
02:01:54,159 --> 02:01:55,709
you think in the grappling context
that's that that will not always

6282
02:01:55,709 --> 02:01:55,719
that's that that will not always
 

6283
02:01:55,719 --> 02:01:59,390
that's that that will not always
translate no not when you can pull guard

6284
02:01:59,390 --> 02:01:59,400
translate no not when you can pull guard
 

6285
02:01:59,400 --> 02:02:01,270
translate no not when you can pull guard
and submit from your back I think that

6286
02:02:01,270 --> 02:02:01,280
and submit from your back I think that
 

6287
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:03,030
and submit from your back I think that
sort of negates some of that grinding

6288
02:02:03,030 --> 02:02:03,040
sort of negates some of that grinding
 

6289
02:02:03,040 --> 02:02:06,149
sort of negates some of that grinding
pressure I think that has to be met with

6290
02:02:06,149 --> 02:02:06,159
pressure I think that has to be met with
 

6291
02:02:06,159 --> 02:02:09,750
pressure I think that has to be met with
more slow technical lateral movement I

6292
02:02:09,750 --> 02:02:09,760
more slow technical lateral movement I
 

6293
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:11,589
more slow technical lateral movement I
think that's the way you like that's

6294
02:02:11,589 --> 02:02:11,599
think that's the way you like that's
 

6295
02:02:11,599 --> 02:02:13,350
think that's the way you like that's
that would be the dream for me is a guy

6296
02:02:13,350 --> 02:02:13,360
that would be the dream for me is a guy
 

6297
02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:15,550
that would be the dream for me is a guy
just comes straight forward into my

6298
02:02:15,550 --> 02:02:15,560
just comes straight forward into my
 

6299
02:02:15,560 --> 02:02:17,669
just comes straight forward into my

progress is
basically folk style wrestling but an

basically folk style wrestling but an
 

6469

basically folk style wrestling but an
integration of submissions from a

submission that leads to a sweep or a
 

6479
02:05:46,719 --> 02:05:49,109
submission that leads to a sweep or a
sweep and you should be trying to avoid

sweep and you should be trying to avoid
 

6481
02:05:49,119 --> 02:05:51,830
sweep and you should be trying to avoid
being pinned and as long as the Gang

02:07:49,549 --> 02:07:49,559
secret secret thing I personally think
 

6587
02:07:49,559 --> 02:07:51,990
secret secret thing I personally think
it's almost impossible to say

6588
02:07:51,990 --> 02:07:52,000
it's almost impossible to say
 

6589
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:53,669
it's almost impossible to say
but the but occasionally you look at a

6590
02:07:53,669 --> 02:07:53,679
but the but occasionally you look at a
 

6591
02:07:53,679 --> 02:07:55,589
but the but occasionally you look at a
guy and you you're pretty certain you

6592
02:07:55,589 --> 02:07:55,599
guy and you you're pretty certain you
 

6593
02:07:55,599 --> 02:07:58,790
guy and you you're pretty certain you
know yeah the looks of it but it could

6594
02:07:58,790 --> 02:07:58,800
know yeah the looks of it but it could
 

6595
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:00,229
know yeah the looks of it but it could
also go the other way certain people are

6596
02:08:00,229 --> 02:08:00,239
also go the other way certain people are
 

6597
02:08:00,239 --> 02:08:02,950
also go the other way certain people are
just genetically built and they look

6598
02:08:02,950 --> 02:08:02,960
just genetically built and they look
 

6599
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:04,430
just genetically built and they look
like they are and then there's probably

6600
02:08:04,430 --> 02:08:04,440
like they are and then there's probably
 

6601
02:08:04,440 --> 02:08:07,629
like they are and then there's probably
others like yourself it's a it's a

6602
02:08:07,629 --> 02:08:07,639
others like yourself it's a it's a
 

6603
02:08:07,639 --> 02:08:09,149
others like yourself it's a it's a
self-defense mechanism because you'd

6604
02:08:09,149 --> 02:08:09,159
