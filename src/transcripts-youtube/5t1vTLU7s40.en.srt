I see the danger of this concentration

00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:02,080
I see the danger of this concentration

I see the danger of this concentration
of power to to proprietary AI systems as

00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,230
of power to to proprietary AI systems as
a much bigger danger than everything

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,950
a much bigger danger than everything
else what works against this is people

who think that for reasons of security
 

11
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,670
who think that for reasons of security
we should keep AI systems under lock and

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:17,680
we should keep AI systems under lock and

through proprietary systems I believe

24
00:00:32,749 --> 00:00:32,759
through proprietary systems I believe
 

25
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,470
through proprietary systems I believe
that people are fundamentally good and

recently throughout your career actually
but recently as well uh you've said that

108
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,080
but recently as well uh you've said that
 

109
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,670
but recently as well uh you've said that
autoaggressive llms are uh not the way

110
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:34,680
autoaggressive llms are uh not the way
 

111
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,030
autoaggressive llms are uh not the way
we're going to make progress towards

112
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,040
we're going to make progress towards

llama 2 and 3 soon and so on how do they

118
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:44,720
llama 2 and 3 soon and so on how do they
 

119
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,509
llama 2 and 3 soon and so on how do they
work and why are they not going to take

120
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:46,519
work and why are they not going to take
 

121
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:49,030
work and why are they not going to take
us all the way for a number of reasons

122
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,040
us all the way for a number of reasons
 

123
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,990
us all the way for a number of reasons
the first is that there is a number of

124
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,000
the first is that there is a number of
 

125
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,390
the first is that there is a number of
characteristics of intelligent

126
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:53,400
characteristics of intelligent
 

127
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,430
characteristics of intelligent
behavior for example the capacity to

128
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:57,440
behavior for example the capacity to
 

129
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,229
behavior for example the capacity to
understand the world understand the

130
00:02:59,229 --> 00:02:59,239
understand the world understand the
 

131
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:01,350
understand the world understand the
physical world

132
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:01,360
physical world
 

133
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,630
physical world
the ability to remember and retrieve

134
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:05,640
the ability to remember and retrieve
 

135
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,350
the ability to remember and retrieve
things um persistent memory the ability

136
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:09,360
things um persistent memory the ability
 

137
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,470
things um persistent memory the ability
to reason and the ability to plan those

138
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,480
to reason and the ability to plan those
 

139
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,589
to reason and the ability to plan those
are four essential characteristic of

140
00:03:14,589 --> 00:03:14,599
are four essential characteristic of
 

141
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:18,030
are four essential characteristic of
intelligent um systems or entities

142
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:18,040
intelligent um systems or entities
 

143
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,430

humans

144
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,440
humans
 

145
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,390
humans
animals lnms can do none of those or

146
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:23,400
animals lnms can do none of those or
 

147
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,470
animals lnms can do none of those or
they can only do them in a very

148
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:25,480
they can only do them in a very
 

149
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,750
they can only do them in a very
primitive way and uh they don't really

150
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:28,760
primitive way and uh they don't really
 

151
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,910
primitive way and uh they don't really
understand the physical world don't

152
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:29,920
understand the physical world don't
 

153
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,589
understand the physical world don't
really have persistent memory they can't

154
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:31,599
really have persistent memory they can't
 

155
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,429
really have persistent memory they can't
really reason and they certainly can't

156
00:03:33,429 --> 00:03:33,439
really reason and they certainly can't
 

157
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,309
really reason and they certainly can't
plan and so you know if if if you expect

158
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:37,319
plan and so you know if if if you expect
 

159
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,229
plan and so you know if if if you expect
the system to become intelligent just

160
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:40,239
the system to become intelligent just
 

161
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,190
the system to become intelligent just
you know without having the possibility

162
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:42,200
you know without having the possibility
 

163
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,869
you know without having the possibility
of doing those things you're making a

164
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879

enormous amounts of text basically the

188
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:18,040
enormous amounts of text basically the
 

189
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,550
enormous amounts of text basically the

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,390
entirety of all publicly available text
on the internet right that's

192
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,400
on the internet right that's
 

193
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,990
on the internet right that's
typically on the order of 10 to the 13

194
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,000
typically on the order of 10 to the 13

00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:28,199
tokens each token is typically two byes
 

197
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,590
tokens each token is typically two byes
so that's two 10 to the 13 bytes as

00:04:39,469 --> 00:04:39,479
at eight hours a day uh so it seems like
 

205
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,230

that language is already very compressed
it already contains a lot more

it already contains a lot more
 

293
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,309
it already contains a lot more

information than the bytes it takes to
 

295
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,350
information than the bytes it takes to
store them if you compare it to visual

store them if you compare it to visual
 

297
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,550
store them if you compare it to visual
data so there's a lot of wisdom and

301
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:34,670
language there's words and the way we
stitch them together it already contains

stitch them together it already contains
 

303
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,350
stitch them together it already contains
a lot of information so is it possible

304
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:38,360
a lot of information so is it possible
 

305
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,790
a lot of information so is it possible
that language alone already has

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,309
enough wisdom and knowledge in there to
be able to from that language construct

310
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:49,319
be able to from that language construct
 

311
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,070
be able to from that language construct

and also cognitive scientists like
 

321
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:03,629

00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,269
matter um and uh a classical way of
doing this is uh you train a vision

484
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:47,279
doing this is uh you train a vision
 

485
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,870
doing this is uh you train a vision
system in some way and we have a number

486
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:49,880
system in some way and we have a number
 

487
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,430
system in some way and we have a number
of ways to train Vision systems either

488
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:51,440
of ways to train Vision systems either
 

489
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,629
of ways to train Vision systems either

uh typical llm takes as an input and
 

505
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,230
uh typical llm takes as an input and
then you just feed that to the llm in

506
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:15,240
then you just feed that to the llm in
 

507
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,269
then you just feed that to the llm in
addition to the text and you just expect

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,629
those line for for quite a long time um
and now you see those systems right I

520
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:32,639
and now you see those systems right I
 

521
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,670
and now you see those systems right I
mean there are llms that can that have

522
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:34,680
mean there are llms that can that have
 

523
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,790
mean there are llms that can that have
some Vision extension but they're

00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
for example uh they don't really
 

535
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,150
for example uh they don't really
understand intuitive physics at least

536
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:49,160
understand intuitive physics at least
 

537
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,069
understand intuitive physics at least
not at the moment so you don't think

00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:52,079
not at the moment so you don't think
 

539
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,350
not at the moment so you don't think
there's something special to about

there's something special to about

you is a giant leap that llms are just

548
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:01,519
you is a giant leap that llms are just
 

549
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,230
you is a giant leap that llms are just
not able to do we're not going to be

550
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:03,240
not able to do we're not going to be
 

551
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,110
not able to do we're not going to be
able to do this with the type of llms

552
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,120
able to do this with the type of llms
 

553
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,790
able to do this with the type of llms
that we are uh working with today and

554
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:07,800
that we are uh working with today and
 

555
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,670
that we are uh working with today and
there's a number of reasons for this but

556
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:09,680
there's a number of reasons for this but
 

557
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,350
there's a number of reasons for this but
uh the main reason

558
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:11,360
uh the main reason
 

559
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,550
uh the main reason
is the way llm LMS are trained is that

560
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:14,560
is the way llm LMS are trained is that
 

561
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,230
is the way llm LMS are trained is that
you you take a piece of text you remove

562
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:18,240
you you take a piece of text you remove
 

563
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,910
you you take a piece of text you remove
some of the words in that text you Mass

564
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:19,920
some of the words in that text you Mass
 

565
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,750
some of the words in that text you Mass
them you replace by replace them by

566
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:21,760
them you replace by replace them by
 

567
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,670
them you replace by replace them by
blank markers and you train a gtic

568
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:23,680
blank markers and you train a gtic
 

569
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,150
blank markers and you train a gtic
neural net to predict the words that are

570
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,160
neural net to predict the words that are
 

571
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,750
neural net to predict the words that are
missing uh and if you build this neural

572
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:28,760
missing uh and if you build this neural
 

573
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,790
missing uh and if you build this neural
net in a particular way so that it can

574
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:30,800
net in a particular way so that it can
 

575
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,509
net in a particular way so that it can
only look at u words that are to the

576
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:33,519
only look at u words that are to the
 

577
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,990
only look at u words that are to the
left of the one is trying to predict

578
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,000
left of the one is trying to predict
 

579
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,470
left of the one is trying to predict
then what you have is a system that

580
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:37,480
then what you have is a system that
 

581
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,949
then what you have is a system that
basically is trying to predict the next

582
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:38,959
basically is trying to predict the next
 

583
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,470
basically is trying to predict the next
word in a text right so then you can

584
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:40,480
word in a text right so then you can
 

585
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,069
word in a text right so then you can
feed it um a text a prompt and you can

586
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:44,079
feed it um a text a prompt and you can
 

587
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,949
feed it um a text a prompt and you can
ask it to predict the next word it can

588
00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:45,959
ask it to predict the next word it can
 

589
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,110
ask it to predict the next word it can
never predict the next word exactly and

590
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:48,120
never predict the next word exactly and
 

591
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,389
never predict the next word exactly and
so what it's going to do is uh produce a

592
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:51,399
so what it's going to do is uh produce a
 

593
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:53,069
so what it's going to do is uh produce a
probability distribution over all the

594
00:12:53,069 --> 00:12:53,079
probability distribution over all the
 

595
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:55,030
probability distribution over all the
possible words in your dictionary in

596
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,040
possible words in your dictionary in
 

597
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,189
possible words in your dictionary in
fact it doesn't predict words it

598
00:12:56,189 --> 00:12:56,199
fact it doesn't predict words it
 

599
00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:57,829
fact it doesn't predict words it
predicts tokens that are kind of subword

600
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:57,839
predicts tokens that are kind of subword
 

601
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,069
predicts tokens that are kind of subword
units and so it's easy to handle the

602
00:13:01,069 --> 00:13:01,079
units and so it's easy to handle the
 

603
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:02,750
units and so it's easy to handle the
uncertainty in the prediction there

604
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:02,760
uncertainty in the prediction there
 

605
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,710
uncertainty in the prediction there
because there's only a finite number of

606
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:04,720
because there's only a finite number of
 

607
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,430
because there's only a finite number of
possible words in the dictionary and you

608
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:07,440
possible words in the dictionary and you
 

609
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,230
possible words in the dictionary and you
can just compute a distribution over

610
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:09,240
can just compute a distribution over
 

611
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,150
can just compute a distribution over
them um then what you what the system

612
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,160
them um then what you what the system
 

613
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,509
them um then what you what the system
does is that it it picks a word from

614
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:15,519
does is that it it picks a word from
 

615
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,509
does is that it it picks a word from
that distribution of course there's a

616
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:17,519
that distribution of course there's a
 

617
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,870
that distribution of course there's a
higher chance of picking words that have

618
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:18,880
higher chance of picking words that have
 

619
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,790
higher chance of picking words that have
a higher probability within that

620
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:20,800
a higher probability within that
 

621
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,150
a higher probability within that
distribution so you sample from that

622
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,160
distribution so you sample from that
 

623
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,150
distribution so you sample from that
distribution to actually produce a word

624
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:25,160
distribution to actually produce a word
 

625
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,189
distribution to actually produce a word
and then you shift that word into the

626
00:13:27,189 --> 00:13:27,199
and then you shift that word into the
 

627
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:29,790
and then you shift that word into the
input and so that allows the system not

628
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:29,800
input and so that allows the system not
 

629
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,269
input and so that allows the system not
to predict the second word right and

630
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:32,279
to predict the second word right and
 

631
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,910
to predict the second word right and
once you do this you shift it into the

632
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:33,920
once you do this you shift it into the
 

633
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,269
once you do this you shift it into the
input Etc that's called Auto regressive

634
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:37,279
input Etc that's called Auto regressive
 

635
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,750
input Etc that's called Auto regressive
prediction and which is why those llms

636
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:39,760
prediction and which is why those llms
 

637
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,310
prediction and which is why those llms
should be called Auto regressive llms uh

638
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:43,320
should be called Auto regressive llms uh
 

639
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,310
should be called Auto regressive llms uh
but we just call them

640
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:45,320

00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,040
uh that goes before language yeah maps
 

679
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,629
uh that goes before language yeah maps
onto language right it's certainly true

00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:31,639
onto language right it's certainly true

you're saying your thinking is same in
 

687
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,710
you're saying your thinking is same in
French as it is in English yeah pretty

French as it is in English yeah pretty
 

689
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,949

there's a probability

if it's like producing puns I get much

700
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:54,639
if it's like producing puns I get much
 

701
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,870
if it's like producing puns I get much
better in French than English about that

702
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:56,880
better in French than English about that
 

703
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,230
better in French than English about that
no but so worse is an abstract

704
00:14:59,230 --> 00:14:59,240
no but so worse is an abstract
 

705
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,870
no but so worse is an abstract
representation of puns like is your

706
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:00,880
representation of puns like is your
 

707
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,350
representation of puns like is your
humor an abstract like when you tweet

708
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:03,360
humor an abstract like when you tweet
 

709
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,710
humor an abstract like when you tweet
and your tweets are sometimes a little

710
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:04,720
and your tweets are sometimes a little
 

711
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,870
and your tweets are sometimes a little
bit spicy uh what's is there an abstract

712
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:07,880
bit spicy uh what's is there an abstract
 

713
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,670
bit spicy uh what's is there an abstract
representation in your brain of a tweet

714
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:09,680
representation in your brain of a tweet
 

715
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,110
representation in your brain of a tweet
before it maps onto English there is an

716
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:12,120
before it maps onto English there is an
 

717
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,870
before it maps onto English there is an
abstract representation of uh Imagining

718
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:14,880
abstract representation of uh Imagining
 

719
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,629
abstract representation of uh Imagining
the reaction of a reader to that uh text

720
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:18,639
the reaction of a reader to that uh text
 

721
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,150
the reaction of a reader to that uh text
or you start with laughter and then

722
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,160
or you start with laughter and then
 

723
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,030
or you start with laughter and then
figure out how to make that happen or

724
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,040
figure out how to make that happen or
 

725
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,069
figure out how to make that happen or
figure out like a reaction you want to

726
00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:25,079
figure out like a reaction you want to
 

727
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:26,949
figure out like a reaction you want to
cause and and then figure out how to say

728
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:26,959
cause and and then figure out how to say
 

729
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,030
cause and and then figure out how to say
it right so that it causes that reaction

730
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,040
it right so that it causes that reaction
 

731
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,710
it right so that it causes that reaction
but that's like really close to language

732
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:30,720
but that's like really close to language
 

733
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,309
but that's like really close to language
but think about like a math mathematical

734
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:33,319
but think about like a math mathematical
 

735
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:36,430
but think about like a math mathematical
concept or um you know imagining you

736
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:36,440
concept or um you know imagining you
 

737
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,790
concept or um you know imagining you
know something you want to build out of

738
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:37,800
know something you want to build out of
 

739
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,069
know something you want to build out of
wood or something like this right the

740
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:40,079
wood or something like this right the
 

741
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,230
wood or something like this right the
kind of thinking you're doing has

742
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:41,240
kind of thinking you're doing has
 

743
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,710
kind of thinking you're doing has
absolutely nothing to do with language

744
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:42,720
absolutely nothing to do with language
 

745
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,269
absolutely nothing to do with language
really like it's not like you have

746
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:44,279
really like it's not like you have
 

747
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,230
really like it's not like you have
necessarily like an internal monologue

748
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:46,240
necessarily like an internal monologue
 

749
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,509
necessarily like an internal monologue
in any particular language you're you're

750
00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:48,519
in any particular language you're you're
 

751
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:51,350
in any particular language you're you're
you know imagining mental models of of

752
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:51,360
you know imagining mental models of of
 

753
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,069
you know imagining mental models of of
the thing right I mean if I if I ask you

754
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:53,079
the thing right I mean if I if I ask you
 

755
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:55,550
the thing right I mean if I if I ask you
to like imagine what this uh water

756
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:55,560
to like imagine what this uh water
 

757
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,949
to like imagine what this uh water
bottle will look like if I rotate it 90

758
00:15:57,949 --> 00:15:57,959
bottle will look like if I rotate it 90
 

759
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:59,189
bottle will look like if I rotate it 90
degrees

760
00:15:59,189 --> 00:15:59,199
degrees
 

761
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,470
degrees
um that has nothing to do with

762
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:01,480
um that has nothing to do with
 

763
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,309
um that has nothing to do with
language and so uh so clearly there is

764
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:05,319
language and so uh so clearly there is
 

765
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:07,790
language and so uh so clearly there is
you know a more abstract level of

766
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:07,800
you know a more abstract level of
 

767
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,670
you know a more abstract level of
representation uh in which we we do most

768
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:10,680
representation uh in which we we do most
 

769
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,309
representation uh in which we we do most
of our thinking and we plan what we're

770
00:16:13,309 --> 00:16:13,319
of our thinking and we plan what we're
 

771
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:16,230
of our thinking and we plan what we're
going to say if the output is

772
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:16,240
going to say if the output is
 

773
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,710
going to say if the output is
is you know uttered words as opposed to

774
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:20,720
is you know uttered words as opposed to
 

775
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,629
is you know uttered words as opposed to
an output being uh you know muscle

776
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:23,639
an output being uh you know muscle
 

777
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:27,790
an output being uh you know muscle
actions right um we we plan our answer

778
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:27,800
actions right um we we plan our answer
 

779
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,110
actions right um we we plan our answer
before we produce it and LMS don't do

780
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:30,120
before we produce it and LMS don't do
 

781
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,269
before we produce it and LMS don't do
that they just produce one word after

782
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:32,279
that they just produce one word after
 

783
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:35,150
that they just produce one word after
the other instinctively if you want it's

00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:35,160
the other instinctively if you want it's
 

785
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,430
the other instinctively if you want it's
like it's a bit like the you know

786
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:38,440
like it's a bit like the you know
 

787
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,790
like it's a bit like the you know
subconscious uh actions where you don't

788
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:41,800
subconscious uh actions where you don't
 

789
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,110
subconscious uh actions where you don't
like you're distracted you're doing

790
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:43,120
like you're distracted you're doing
 

791
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,990
like you're distracted you're doing
something you're completely concentrated

something you're completely concentrated

and someone comes to you and you know
 

795
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,710
and someone comes to you and you know
asks you a question and you kind of

asks you a question and you kind of
 

797
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,309
asks you a question and you kind of
answer the question you don't have time

798
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:50,319
answer the question you don't have time
 

799
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:51,829
answer the question you don't have time
to think about the answer but the answer

800
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:51,839
to think about the answer but the answer
 

801
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,110
to think about the answer but the answer
is easy so you don't need to pay

802
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:53,120
is easy so you don't need to pay
 

803
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,030
is easy so you don't need to pay
attention you sort of respond

804
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,040
attention you sort of respond
 

805
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,230
attention you sort of respond
automatically that's kind of what an llm

806
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:57,240
automatically that's kind of what an llm
 

807
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,350
automatically that's kind of what an llm
does right it doesn't think about it

808
00:16:59,350 --> 00:16:59,360
does right it doesn't think about it
 

809
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,269
does right it doesn't think about it
sensor really uh it retrieves it because

810
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:02,279
sensor really uh it retrieves it because
 

811
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,510
sensor really uh it retrieves it because
it's accumulated a lot of knowledge so

812
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:04,520
it's accumulated a lot of knowledge so
 

813
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,150
it's accumulated a lot of knowledge so
it can retrieve some some things but

814
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:06,160
it can retrieve some some things but
 

815
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,150
it can retrieve some some things but
it's going

816
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:07,160
it's going
 

817
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,470
it's going
to just spit out one token after the

818
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:10,480
to just spit out one token after the
 

819
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,549
to just spit out one token after the
other without planning the answer but

820
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:14,559
other without planning the answer but
 

821
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,510
other without planning the answer but
you're making it sound just one token

822
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:16,520
you're making it sound just one token
 

823
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,829
you're making it sound just one token
after the other one token at a time

824
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:18,839
after the other one token at a time
 

825
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:24,230
after the other one token at a time
generation is uh bound to be

826
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,240
generation is uh bound to be
 

827
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,789
generation is uh bound to be
simplistic but if the world model is

828
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:26,799
simplistic but if the world model is
 

829
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,830
simplistic but if the world model is
sufficiently sophisticated that one

830
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:28,840
sufficiently sophisticated that one
 

831
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,390
sufficiently sophisticated that one
token at a

832
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:30,400
token at a
 

833
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,750
token at a
time the the most likely thing it

834
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:33,760
time the the most likely thing it
 

835
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,470
time the the most likely thing it
generates is a sequence of tokens is

836
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:35,480
generates is a sequence of tokens is
 

837
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,390
generates is a sequence of tokens is
going to be a deeply profound thing okay

838
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:39,400
going to be a deeply profound thing okay
 

839
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,710
going to be a deeply profound thing okay
but then that assumes that those systems

840
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:42,720
but then that assumes that those systems
 

841
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,750
but then that assumes that those systems
actually possess an internal World model

842
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:44,760
actually possess an internal World model
 

843
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,990
actually possess an internal World model
so it really goes to the I I think the

844
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:47,000
so it really goes to the I I think the
 

845
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,950
so it really goes to the I I think the
fundamental question is can you build a

846
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:49,960
fundamental question is can you build a
 

847
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,909
fundamental question is can you build a
a

848
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:51,919
a
 

849
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,870
a
really complete World model not complete

850
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:54,880
really complete World model not complete
 

851
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,149
really complete World model not complete
but a uh one that has a deep

852
00:17:57,149 --> 00:17:57,159
but a uh one that has a deep
 

853
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,830
but a uh one that has a deep
understanding of the world yeah so can

854
00:17:59,830 --> 00:17:59,840
understanding of the world yeah so can
 

855
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,590
understanding of the world yeah so can
you build this first of all by

856
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:02,600
you build this first of all by
 

857
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,830
you build this first of all by
prediction right and the answer is

858
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:04,840
prediction right and the answer is
 

859
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,950
prediction right and the answer is
probably yes can you predict can you

860
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:07,960
probably yes can you predict can you
 

861
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,870
probably yes can you predict can you
build it by predicting words and the

862
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:10,880
build it by predicting words and the
 

863
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,950
build it by predicting words and the
answer is most probably no because

864
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:14,960
answer is most probably no because
 

865
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,789
answer is most probably no because
language is very poor in terms or weak

866
00:18:17,789 --> 00:18:17,799
language is very poor in terms or weak
 

867
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,390
language is very poor in terms or weak
or low bandwidth if you want there's

868
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:19,400
or low bandwidth if you want there's
 

869
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,510
or low bandwidth if you want there's
just not enough information there so

870
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:22,520
just not enough information there so
 

871
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,470
just not enough information there so
building World models means observing

872
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:25,480
building World models means observing
 

873
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,230
building World models means observing
the

874
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:26,240
the
 

875
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,950
the
world and uh

876
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:28,960
world and uh
 

877
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,270
world and uh
understanding why the world is evolving

878
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:31,280
understanding why the world is evolving
 

879
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,510
understanding why the world is evolving
the way the way it is and then uh the

880
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:35,520
the way the way it is and then uh the
 

881
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,669
the way the way it is and then uh the
the extra component of a world model is

882
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:39,679
the extra component of a world model is
 

883
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,710
the extra component of a world model is
something that can predict how the world

884
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:41,720
something that can predict how the world
 

885
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,510
something that can predict how the world
is going to evolve as a consequence of

886
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:43,520
is going to evolve as a consequence of
 

887
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,789
is going to evolve as a consequence of
an action you might take right so what

888
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:45,799
an action you might take right so what
 

889
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,909
an action you might take right so what
model really is here is my idea of the

890
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:47,919
model really is here is my idea of the
 

891
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,510
model really is here is my idea of the
state of the world at time te here is an

892
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:49,520
state of the world at time te here is an
 

893
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,230
state of the world at time te here is an
action I might take what is the

894
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:52,240
action I might take what is the
 

895
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,669
action I might take what is the
predicted state of the world at Mt plus1

896
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:55,679
predicted state of the world at Mt plus1
 

897
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,029
predicted state of the world at Mt plus1
now that state of the world doesn't does

898
00:18:58,029 --> 00:18:58,039
now that state of the world doesn't does
 

899
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:59,830
now that state of the world doesn't does
not need to represent everything about

900
00:18:59,830 --> 00:18:59,840
not need to represent everything about
 

901
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,270
not need to represent everything about
the world it just needs to represent

902
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:02,280
the world it just needs to represent
 

903
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,590
the world it just needs to represent
enough that's relevant for this planning

904
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:04,600
enough that's relevant for this planning
 

905
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,029
enough that's relevant for this planning
of of the action but not necessarily all

906
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:07,039
of of the action but not necessarily all
 

907
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,149
of of the action but not necessarily all
the details now here is the problem um

908
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:10,159
the details now here is the problem um
 

909
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:11,990
the details now here is the problem um
you're not going to be able to do this

910
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,000
you're not going to be able to do this
 

911
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,669
you're not going to be able to do this
with generative models so genery model

912
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:15,679
with generative models so genery model
 

913
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,310
with generative models so genery model
has trained on video and we've tried to

914
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:17,320
has trained on video and we've tried to
 

915
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,270
has trained on video and we've tried to
do this for 10 years you take a video

916
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:20,280
do this for 10 years you take a video
 

917
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,630
do this for 10 years you take a video
show a system a piece of video and then

918
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:22,640
show a system a piece of video and then
 

919
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,830
show a system a piece of video and then
ask you to predict the reminder of the

920
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:24,840
ask you to predict the reminder of the
 

921
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,310
ask you to predict the reminder of the
video basically predict what's going to

922
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:27,320
video basically predict what's going to
 

923
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,830
video basically predict what's going to
happen one frame at a time do the same

924
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:29,840
happen one frame at a time do the same
 

925
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,070
happen one frame at a time do the same
thing as sort of the autoaggressive llms

926
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:33,080
thing as sort of the autoaggressive llms
 

927
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,510
thing as sort of the autoaggressive llms
do but for video right either one FR at

928
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:35,520
do but for video right either one FR at
 

929
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,830
do but for video right either one FR at
a time or a group of friends at a time

930
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:37,840
a time or a group of friends at a time
 

931
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,590
a time or a group of friends at a time
um but yeah uh a large video model if

932
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:40,600
um but yeah uh a large video model if
 

933
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,230
um but yeah uh a large video model if
you

934
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:41,240
you
 

935
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,470
you
want uh the idea of of doing this has

936
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:45,480
want uh the idea of of doing this has
 

937
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,350
want uh the idea of of doing this has
been floating around for a long time and

938
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:47,360
been floating around for a long time and
 

939
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,070
been floating around for a long time and
at at Fair uh some colleagues and I have

940
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:51,080
at at Fair uh some colleagues and I have
 

941
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,029
at at Fair uh some colleagues and I have
been trying to do this for about 10

942
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:53,039
been trying to do this for about 10
 

943
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,750
been trying to do this for about 10
years um and you can't you can't really

944
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:56,760
years um and you can't you can't really
 

945
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,710
years um and you can't you can't really
do the same trick as with LM because uh

946
00:19:59,710 --> 00:19:59,720
do the same trick as with LM because uh
 

947
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,430
do the same trick as with LM because uh
you know llms as I said you can't

948
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:02,440
you know llms as I said you can't
 

949
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,470
you know llms as I said you can't
predict exactly which word is going to

950
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:04,480
predict exactly which word is going to
 

951
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,110
predict exactly which word is going to
follow a sequence of words we can

952
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:07,120
follow a sequence of words we can
 

953
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,909
follow a sequence of words we can
predict the distribution over words now

954
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:09,919
predict the distribution over words now
 

955
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,029
predict the distribution over words now
if you go to video what you would have

956
00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:12,039
if you go to video what you would have
 

957
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:13,669
if you go to video what you would have
to do is predict the distribution over

958
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:13,679
to do is predict the distribution over
 

959
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,590
to do is predict the distribution over
all possible frames in a video and we

960
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:16,600
all possible frames in a video and we
 

961
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,510
all possible frames in a video and we
don't really know how to do that

962
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:18,520
don't really know how to do that
 

963
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,070
don't really know how to do that
properly uh we we do not know how to

964
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:21,080
properly uh we we do not know how to
 

965
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,870
properly uh we we do not know how to
represent distributions over High

966
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:22,880
represent distributions over High
 

967
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,909
represent distributions over High
dimensional continuous spaces in ways

968
00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:24,919
dimensional continuous spaces in ways
 

969
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:26,029
dimensional continuous spaces in ways
that are

970
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:26,039
that are
 

971
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:29,750
that are
useful uh and and that's that there lies

972
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:29,760
useful uh and and that's that there lies
 

973
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,750
useful uh and and that's that there lies
the main issue and the reason we can do

974
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:32,760
the main issue and the reason we can do
 

975
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,590
the main issue and the reason we can do
this is because the world is incredibly

976
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:35,600
this is because the world is incredibly
 

977
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,549
this is because the world is incredibly
more complicated and richer in terms of

978
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:38,559
more complicated and richer in terms of
 

979
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,870
more complicated and richer in terms of
information than than text text is

980
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:41,880
information than than text text is
 

981
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,149
information than than text text is
discret video is high dimensional and

982
00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:44,159
discret video is high dimensional and
 

983
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,190
discret video is high dimensional and
continuous a lot of details in this um

984
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:47,200
continuous a lot of details in this um
 

985
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,070
continuous a lot of details in this um
so if I take a a video of this room uh

986
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:51,080
so if I take a a video of this room uh
 

987
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,510
so if I take a a video of this room uh
and the video is you know a camera

988
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:53,520
and the video is you know a camera
 

989
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,310
and the video is you know a camera
panning around MH um there is no way I

990
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:57,320
panning around MH um there is no way I
 

991
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,510
panning around MH um there is no way I
can predict everything that's going to

992
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:58,520
can predict everything that's going to
 

993
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,070
can predict everything that's going to
be in the room as I pan around the

994
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:00,080
be in the room as I pan around the
 

995
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,390
be in the room as I pan around the
system cannot predict what's going to be

996
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:01,400
system cannot predict what's going to be
 

997
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,310
system cannot predict what's going to be
in the room as the camera is panning

998
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:04,320
in the room as the camera is panning
 

999
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,430
in the room as the camera is panning
maybe it's going to predict this is this

1000
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:06,440
maybe it's going to predict this is this
 

1001
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,789
maybe it's going to predict this is this
is a room where there's a light and

1002
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:07,799
is a room where there's a light and
 

1003
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,310
is a room where there's a light and
there is a wall and things like that it

1004
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:09,320
there is a wall and things like that it
 

1005
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,909
there is a wall and things like that it
can't predict what the painting on the

1006
00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:10,919
can't predict what the painting on the
 

1007
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:12,470
can't predict what the painting on the
wall looks like or what the texture of

1008
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:12,480
wall looks like or what the texture of
 

1009
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,950
wall looks like or what the texture of
the couch looks like certainly not the

1010
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:14,960
the couch looks like certainly not the
 

1011
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,390
the couch looks like certainly not the
texture of the carpet so there's no way

1012
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:17,400
texture of the carpet so there's no way
 

1013
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,230
texture of the carpet so there's no way
I can predict all those details so the

1014
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:20,240
I can predict all those details so the
 

1015
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,830
I can predict all those details so the
the way to handle this is one way

1016
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:23,840
the way to handle this is one way
 

1017
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,470
the way to handle this is one way
possibly to handle this which we've been

1018
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:25,480
possibly to handle this which we've been
 

1019
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,190
possibly to handle this which we've been
working for a long time is to have a

1020
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:27,200
working for a long time is to have a
 

1021
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,630
working for a long time is to have a
model that has

1022
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:28,640
model that has
 

1023
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,870
model that has
what's called a latent variable and the

1024
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:29,880
what's called a latent variable and the
 

1025
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,110
what's called a latent variable and the
latent variable is fed to an Nal net and

1026
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:33,120
latent variable is fed to an Nal net and
 

1027
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,669
latent variable is fed to an Nal net and
it's supposed to represent all the

1028
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:34,679
it's supposed to represent all the
 

1029
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:35,830
it's supposed to represent all the
information about the world that you

1030
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:35,840
information about the world that you
 

1031
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,430
information about the world that you
don't perceive yet and uh that you need

00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:40,440
don't perceive yet and uh that you need
 

1033
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,310

00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:41,320
to
 

1035
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,430
to
augment uh the the system for the

00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:44,440
augment uh the the system for the

um uh that has been a complete failure

1048
00:21:59,110 --> 00:21:59,120
um uh that has been a complete failure
 

1049
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,870
um uh that has been a complete failure
essentially and we've tried lots of

1050
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:00,880
essentially and we've tried lots of
 

1051
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,510
essentially and we've tried lots of
things we tried uh just straight neural

1052
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:03,520
things we tried uh just straight neural
 

1053
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,590
things we tried uh just straight neural
Nets we tried Gans we tried uh you know

1054
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:07,600
Nets we tried Gans we tried uh you know
 

1055
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,990

1057
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,230
Vees all kinds of regularized Auto
encoders we tried um many things we also

1058
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:14,240
encoders we tried um many things we also
 

1059
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,630
encoders we tried um many things we also
tried those kind of methods to learn uh

1060
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:17,640
tried those kind of methods to learn uh
 

1061
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,110
tried those kind of methods to learn uh
good representations of images or video

1062
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,120
good representations of images or video
 

1063
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,269
good representations of images or video
um that could then be used as input to

1064
00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:24,279
um that could then be used as input to
 

1065
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:25,990
um that could then be used as input to
for example an image classification

1066
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:26,000
for example an image classification
 

1067
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,830
for example an image classification
system mhm and that also was basically

1068
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:28,840
system mhm and that also was basically
 

1069
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,909
system mhm and that also was basically
failed like all the systems that attempt

1070
00:22:30,909 --> 00:22:30,919
failed like all the systems that attempt
 

1071
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:34,870
failed like all the systems that attempt
to predict missing parts of an image or

1072
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:34,880
to predict missing parts of an image or
 

1073
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,149
to predict missing parts of an image or
video um you know from a corrupted

1074
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:39,159
video um you know from a corrupted
 

1075
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:40,870
video um you know from a corrupted
version of it basically so right take an

1076
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:40,880
version of it basically so right take an
 

1077
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,590
version of it basically so right take an
image or a video corrupt it or transform

1078
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:42,600
image or a video corrupt it or transform
 

1079
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,669
image or a video corrupt it or transform
it in some way and then try to

1080
00:22:44,669 --> 00:22:44,679
it in some way and then try to
 

1081
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:47,430
it in some way and then try to
reconstruct the complete video or image

1082
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:47,440
reconstruct the complete video or image
 

1083
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,669
reconstruct the complete video or image
from the corrupted

1084
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:49,679
from the corrupted
 

1085
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,110
from the corrupted
version and then hope that internally

1086
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:52,120
version and then hope that internally
 

1087
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,549
version and then hope that internally
the system will develop a good

1088
00:22:53,549 --> 00:22:53,559
the system will develop a good
 

1089
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:55,190
the system will develop a good

1091
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,510
representations of images that you can
use for object recognition segmentation

1092
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:57,520
use for object recognition segmentation
 

1093
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,630
use for object recognition segmentation
whatever it is

1094
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:58,640
whatever it is
 

1095
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,710
whatever it is
is that has been essentially a complete

1096
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:01,720
is that has been essentially a complete
 

1097
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,950
is that has been essentially a complete
failure and it works really well for

1098
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:03,960
failure and it works really well for
 

1099
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,630
failure and it works really well for
text that's the principle that is used

1100
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:05,640
text that's the principle that is used
 

1101
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,750
text that's the principle that is used
for LMS right so where is the failure

1102
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:08,760
for LMS right so where is the failure
 

1103
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,510
for LMS right so where is the failure
exactly is that that it's very difficult

1104
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:10,520
exactly is that that it's very difficult
 

1105
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,549
exactly is that that it's very difficult
to form a good representation of an

00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:13,559
to form a good representation of an
 

1107
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,549
to form a good representation of an
image a good in like a good embedding of

00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:16,559
image a good in like a good embedding of
 

1109
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,830

00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:18,840
all all the important information in the
 

1111
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,990
all all the important information in the
image is it in terms of the consistency

1112
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:21,000
image is it in terms of the consistency
 

1113

00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:22,679
of image to image to image the image
 

1115
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:25,070
of image to image to image the image
that forms the video like where what are

1116
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:25,080
that forms the video like where what are
 

1117
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,390
that forms the video like where what are
the if we do a highlight reel of all the

1118
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:27,400
the if we do a highlight reel of all the
 

1119
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,070
the if we do a highlight reel of all the
ways you failed what what's that look

1120
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:30,080
ways you failed what what's that look
 

1121
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,590
ways you failed what what's that look
like okay so the reason this doesn't

1122
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:32,600
like okay so the reason this doesn't
 

1123
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,029
like okay so the reason this doesn't
work uh is first of all I have to tell

1124
00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:36,039
work uh is first of all I have to tell
 

1125
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,630
work uh is first of all I have to tell
you exactly what doesn't work because

1126
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:37,640
you exactly what doesn't work because
 

1127
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,830
you exactly what doesn't work because
there is something else that does work

1128
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:39,840
there is something else that does work
 

1129
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,510
there is something else that does work
uh so the thing that does not work is

1130
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:42,520
uh so the thing that does not work is
 

1131
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,710
uh so the thing that does not work is
training a system to learn

1132
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:45,720
training a system to learn
 

1133
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,549
training a system to learn
representations of images by training it

1134
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:48,559
representations of images by training it
 

1135
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,149
representations of images by training it
to

1136
00:23:50,149 --> 00:23:50,159
to
 

1137
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,269
to
reconstruct uh a good image from a

1138
00:23:52,269 --> 00:23:52,279
reconstruct uh a good image from a
 

1139
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:54,310
reconstruct uh a good image from a
corrupted version of it okay that's what

1140
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:54,320
corrupted version of it okay that's what
 

1141
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,510
corrupted version of it okay that's what
doesn't work and we have a whole slew of

1142
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:57,520
doesn't work and we have a whole slew of
 

1143
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,630
doesn't work and we have a whole slew of
technique for this uh that are you know

00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:00,640
technique for this uh that are you know
 

1145
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,710

colleagues at Fair Max Doo encoder so

1150
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:07,039
colleagues at Fair Max Doo encoder so
 

1151
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,549
colleagues at Fair Max Doo encoder so
it's basically like

1152
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:08,559
it's basically like
 

1153
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,789
it's basically like
the you know llms or or or or things

1154
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:11,799
the you know llms or or or or things
 

1155
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:13,149
the you know llms or or or or things
like this where you train the system by

1156
00:24:13,149 --> 00:24:13,159
like this where you train the system by
 

1157
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:14,669
like this where you train the system by
corrupting text except you corrupt

1158
00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:14,679
corrupting text except you corrupt
 

1159
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:16,590
corrupting text except you corrupt
images you remove Patches from it and

1160
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:16,600
images you remove Patches from it and
 

1161
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,350
images you remove Patches from it and
you train a gigantic neet to reconstruct

1162
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:19,360
you train a gigantic neet to reconstruct
 

1163
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,029
you train a gigantic neet to reconstruct
the features you get are not good and

1164
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:21,039
the features you get are not good and
 

1165
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,549
the features you get are not good and
you know they're not good because if you

1166
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:23,559
you know they're not good because if you
 

1167
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:25,549
you know they're not good because if you
now train the same architecture but you

1168
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:25,559
now train the same architecture but you
 

1169
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:28,710
now train the same architecture but you
train it supervised mhm with with uh

1170
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:28,720
train it supervised mhm with with uh
 

1171
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,789
train it supervised mhm with with uh
label data with Tex textual descriptions

1172
00:24:31,789 --> 00:24:31,799
label data with Tex textual descriptions
 

1173
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:34,630
label data with Tex textual descriptions
of images Etc you do get good

1174
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:34,640
of images Etc you do get good
 

1175
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,029
of images Etc you do get good
representations and the performance on

1176
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:37,039
representations and the performance on
 

1177
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,110
representations and the performance on
recognition tasks is much better than if

1178
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:40,120
recognition tasks is much better than if
 

1179
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,470
recognition tasks is much better than if
you do this self-supervised free trining

1180
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:42,480
you do this self-supervised free trining
 

1181
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,510
you do this self-supervised free trining
so the architecture is good the

1182
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:44,520
so the architecture is good the
 

1183
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,750
so the architecture is good the
architecture is good the architecture of

1184
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:45,760
architecture is good the architecture of
 

1185
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,389
architecture is good the architecture of
the encoder is good okay but the fact

1186
00:24:48,389 --> 00:24:48,399
the encoder is good okay but the fact
 

1187
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:50,310
the encoder is good okay but the fact
that you train the system to reconstruct

1188
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:50,320
that you train the system to reconstruct
 

1189
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,710
that you train the system to reconstruct
images does not lead it to produce to

1190
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:53,720
images does not lead it to produce to
 

1191
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,149
images does not lead it to produce to
learn good generic features of images

1192
00:24:56,149 --> 00:24:56,159
learn good generic features of images
 

1193
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,149
learn good generic features of images
when you train in a self-supervised way

1194
00:24:58,149 --> 00:24:58,159
when you train in a self-supervised way
 

1195
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,549
when you train in a self-supervised way
self-supervised by reconstruction Yeah

1196
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:00,559
self-supervised by reconstruction Yeah
 

1197
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,310
self-supervised by reconstruction Yeah
by reconstruction okay so what's the

1198
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:03,320
by reconstruction okay so what's the
 

1199
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,470
by reconstruction okay so what's the
alternative the alternative is joint

1200
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:06,480
alternative the alternative is joint
 

1201
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,909
alternative the alternative is joint
embedding what is joint embedding what

1202
00:25:08,909 --> 00:25:08,919
embedding what is joint embedding what
 

1203
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:10,149
embedding what is joint embedding what
are what are these architectures that

1204
00:25:10,149 --> 00:25:10,159
are what are these architectures that
 

1205
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,870
are what are these architectures that
you're so excited about okay so now

1206
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:11,880
you're so excited about okay so now
 

1207
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,070
you're so excited about okay so now
instead of training a system to encode

1208
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:14,080
instead of training a system to encode
 

1209
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,070
instead of training a system to encode
the image and then training it to

1210
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,080
the image and then training it to
 

1211
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,430
the image and then training it to
reconstruct the the full image from a

1212
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:18,440
reconstruct the the full image from a
 

1213
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,630
reconstruct the the full image from a
corrupted version you take the full

1214
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:20,640
corrupted version you take the full
 

1215
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,590
corrupted version you take the full
image you take

1216
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:22,600
image you take
 

1217
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,389
image you take
the corrupted or transformed version you

1218
00:25:25,389 --> 00:25:25,399
the corrupted or transformed version you
 

1219
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:28,470
the corrupted or transformed version you
run them both through encoders mhm which

1220
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:28,480
run them both through encoders mhm which
 

1221
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,549
run them both through encoders mhm which
in general are identical but not

1222
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:30,559
in general are identical but not
 

1223
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,149
in general are identical but not
necessarily and then you you

1224
00:25:33,149 --> 00:25:33,159
necessarily and then you you
 

1225
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:36,750
necessarily and then you you
train a predictor on top of those uh

1226
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:36,760
train a predictor on top of those uh
 

1227
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,710
train a predictor on top of those uh
encoders um to predict the

1228
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:39,720
encoders um to predict the
 

1229
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,070
encoders um to predict the
representation of the full input from

1230
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:43,080
representation of the full input from
 

1231
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,830
representation of the full input from
the representation of the corrupted

1232
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:45,840
the representation of the corrupted
 

1233
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,149
the representation of the corrupted
one okay so joint embedding because

1234
00:25:49,149 --> 00:25:49,159
one okay so joint embedding because
 

1235
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:51,029
one okay so joint embedding because
you're you're taking the the full input

1236
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:51,039
you're you're taking the the full input
 

1237
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,230
you're you're taking the the full input
and the corrupted version or transform

1238
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:53,240
and the corrupted version or transform
 

1239
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,230
and the corrupted version or transform
version run them both through encoders

1240
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:55,240
version run them both through encoders
 

1241
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,389
version run them both through encoders
so you get a joint embedding and then

1242
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:57,399
so you get a joint embedding and then
 

1243
00:25:57,399 --> 00:25:59,470
so you get a joint embedding and then
you and then you're you're saying can I

1244
00:25:59,470 --> 00:25:59,480
you and then you're you're saying can I
 

1245
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,710
you and then you're you're saying can I
predict the representation of the full

1246
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:01,720
predict the representation of the full
 

1247
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,029
predict the representation of the full
one from the representation of the

1248
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:03,039
one from the representation of the
 

1249
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:07,350
one from the representation of the
corrupted one okay um and I call this a

1250
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:07,360
corrupted one okay um and I call this a
 

1251
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,830
corrupted one okay um and I call this a
JEA so that means joint embedding

1252
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:08,840
JEA so that means joint embedding
 

1253
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,510
JEA so that means joint embedding
predictive architecture because it's

1254
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:10,520
predictive architecture because it's
 

1255
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,669
predictive architecture because it's
joint embedding and there is this

1256
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:11,679
joint embedding and there is this
 

1257
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:12,710
joint embedding and there is this
predictor that predicts the

1258
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:12,720
predictor that predicts the
 

1259
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,549
predictor that predicts the
representation of the good guy from from

1260
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:14,559
representation of the good guy from from
 

1261
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:15,590
representation of the good guy from from
the bad

1262
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:15,600
the bad
 

1263
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,510
the bad
guy um and the big question is how do

1264
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:18,520
guy um and the big question is how do
 

1265
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,110
guy um and the big question is how do
you train something like this uh and

1266
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:21,120
you train something like this uh and
 

1267
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,870
you train something like this uh and
until five years ago or six years ago we

1268
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:23,880
until five years ago or six years ago we
 

1269
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,149
until five years ago or six years ago we
didn't have particularly good answers

1270
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:26,159
didn't have particularly good answers
 

1271
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,990
didn't have particularly good answers

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,909
for how you train those things except
for one um called contrastive

1279
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,190
learning
where um and the IDE contrastive

1280
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:36,200
where um and the IDE contrastive
 

1281
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,230
where um and the IDE contrastive
learning is you you take a pair of

1282
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:38,240
learning is you you take a pair of
 

1283
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,510
learning is you you take a pair of
images that are again an image and a

1284
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:41,520
images that are again an image and a
 

1285
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,750
images that are again an image and a
corrupted version or degraded version

1286
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:43,760
corrupted version or degraded version
 

1287
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,510
corrupted version or degraded version
somehow or transform version of the

1288
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:45,520
somehow or transform version of the
 

1289
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,269
somehow or transform version of the
original one and you train the predicted

1290
00:26:49,269 --> 00:26:49,279
original one and you train the predicted
 

1291
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,789
original one and you train the predicted
representation to be the same as as that

1292
00:26:51,789 --> 00:26:51,799
representation to be the same as as that
 

1293
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:53,870
representation to be the same as as that
if you only do this the system collapses

1294
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:53,880
if you only do this the system collapses
 

1295
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,269
if you only do this the system collapses
it basically completely ignores the

1296
00:26:55,269 --> 00:26:55,279
it basically completely ignores the
 

1297
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,230
it basically completely ignores the
input and produces representations that

1298
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:57,240
input and produces representations that
 

1299
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,990
input and produces representations that
are con

1300
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:00,000

 

1301
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,830

so the contrastive methods avoid this

1302
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:02,840
so the contrastive methods avoid this
 

1303
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,149
so the contrastive methods avoid this
and and those things have been around

1304
00:27:04,149 --> 00:27:04,159
and and those things have been around
 

1305
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,070
and and those things have been around
since the early 90s had a paper on this

1306
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:06,080
since the early 90s had a paper on this
 

1307
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,710
since the early 90s had a paper on this
in

1308
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:06,720
in
 

1309
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,190
in
1993 um is you also show pairs of images

1310
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:12,200
1993 um is you also show pairs of images
 

1311
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,110
1993 um is you also show pairs of images
that you know are different and then you

1312
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:15,120
that you know are different and then you
 

1313
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,190
that you know are different and then you
push away the representations from each

1314
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:17,200
push away the representations from each
 

1315
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,070
push away the representations from each
other so you say not only do

1316
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:19,080
other so you say not only do
 

1317
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,789
other so you say not only do
representations of things that we know

1318
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:20,799
representations of things that we know
 

1319
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,750
representations of things that we know
are the same should be the same or

1320
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:22,760
are the same should be the same or
 

1321
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,750
are the same should be the same or
should be similar but representation of

1322
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:24,760
should be similar but representation of
 

1323
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,830
should be similar but representation of
things that we know are different should

1324
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:25,840
things that we know are different should
 

1325
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,510
things that we know are different should
be

1326
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:26,520
be
 

1327
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,909
be
different and that prevents the collapse

1328
00:27:28,909 --> 00:27:28,919
different and that prevents the collapse
 

1329
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:30,389
different and that prevents the collapse
but it has some limitation and there's a

1330
00:27:30,389 --> 00:27:30,399
but it has some limitation and there's a
 

1331
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,269
but it has some limitation and there's a
whole bunch of uh techniques that have

1332
00:27:32,269 --> 00:27:32,279
whole bunch of uh techniques that have
 

1333
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:35,430
whole bunch of uh techniques that have
appeared over the last six seven years

1334
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:35,440
appeared over the last six seven years
 

1335
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,870
appeared over the last six seven years
um that can revive this this type of

00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:37,880
um that can revive this this type of
 

1337
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,590
um that can revive this this type of
method um some of them from Far some of

1341
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,310

um but there are limitations to those

1342
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:46,320
um but there are limitations to those
 

1343
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,110
um but there are limitations to those
contrasting method what has changed in

uh you know three four years is now now

1348
00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:53,039
uh you know three four years is now now
 

1349
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,710
uh you know three four years is now now
we have methods that are non-contrastive

1350
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:54,720
we have methods that are non-contrastive
 

1351
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,830
we have methods that are non-contrastive
so they don't require those negative

1352
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:57,840
so they don't require those negative
 

1353
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,350
so they don't require those negative
contractive samples of images that are

00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:00,360
contractive samples of images that are
 

1355
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,350
contractive samples of images that are
that we know are different you can only

1356
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:02,360
that we know are different you can only
 

1357
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,310
that we know are different you can only
you turn them only with images that are

1358
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:05,320
you turn them only with images that are
 

1359
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,630
you turn them only with images that are
you know different versions or different

1360
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:06,640
you know different versions or different
 

1361
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,870
you know different versions or different
views of the same thing uh and you rely

1362
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:09,880
views of the same thing uh and you rely
 

1363
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,230
views of the same thing uh and you rely
on some other tricks to prevent the

1364
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:11,240
on some other tricks to prevent the
 

1365
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,509
on some other tricks to prevent the
system from collapsing and we have have

1366
00:28:13,509 --> 00:28:13,519
system from collapsing and we have have
 

1367
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:16,029
system from collapsing and we have have
a dozen different methods for this now

1368
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:16,039
a dozen different methods for this now
 

1369
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:17,870
a dozen different methods for this now
so what is the fundamental difference

1370
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:17,880
so what is the fundamental difference
 

1371
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,830
so what is the fundamental difference
between joint embedding architectures

1372
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:20,840
between joint embedding architectures
 

1373
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:26,230
between joint embedding architectures
and llms so can uh can japa take us to

1374
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:26,240
and llms so can uh can japa take us to
 

1375
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,389
and llms so can uh can japa take us to
AGI whether we should say that you don't

1376
00:28:29,389 --> 00:28:29,399
AGI whether we should say that you don't
 

1377
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:32,310
AGI whether we should say that you don't
like uh the term AGI and we'll probably

1378
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:32,320
like uh the term AGI and we'll probably
 

1379
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,350
like uh the term AGI and we'll probably
argue I think every single time I've

1380
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:34,360
argue I think every single time I've
 

1381
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,990
argue I think every single time I've
talked to you with argued about the G

1382
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:36,000
talked to you with argued about the G
 

1383
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,470
talked to you with argued about the G
and AGI yes get I get it I get it we

1384
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:40,480
and AGI yes get I get it I get it we
 

1385
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,070
and AGI yes get I get it I get it we
we'll probably continue to argue about

1386
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,080
we'll probably continue to argue about
 

1387
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,470
we'll probably continue to argue about
it it's great uh you you like uh I me

1388
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:45,480
it it's great uh you you like uh I me
 

1389
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,190
it it's great uh you you like uh I me
this because cuz you like French and um

1390
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:48,200
this because cuz you like French and um
 

1391
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,029
this because cuz you like French and um
I me is is is uh I guess friend in

1392
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:51,039
I me is is is uh I guess friend in
 

1393
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,350
I me is is is uh I guess friend in
French yes and Ami stands for advanced

1394
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:54,360
French yes and Ami stands for advanced
 

1395
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,990
French yes and Ami stands for advanced
machine intelligence right um but either

1396
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:58,000
machine intelligence right um but either
 

1397
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,789
machine intelligence right um but either
way can japa take us to that towards

1398
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:00,799
way can japa take us to that towards
 

1399
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,789
way can japa take us to that towards
that advanced machine intelligence well

1400
00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:02,799
that advanced machine intelligence well
 

1401
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,070
that advanced machine intelligence well
so it's a it's a first step okay so

1402
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:05,080
so it's a it's a first step okay so
 

1403
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,870
so it's a it's a first step okay so
first of all uh what What's the

1404
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:06,880
first of all uh what What's the
 

1405
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,430
first of all uh what What's the
difference with generative architectures

1406
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:09,440
difference with generative architectures
 

1407
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,870
difference with generative architectures
like llms um so llms um

1408
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:13,880
like llms um so llms um
 

1409
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,630
like llms um so llms um
or Vision systems that are trained by

reconstruction generate the inputs right

1412
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:19,960
reconstruction generate the inputs right
 

1413
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,070
reconstruction generate the inputs right
they generate the original input that is

1414
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:24,080
they generate the original input that is
 

1415
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,909
they generate the original input that is
non-corrupted

1416
00:29:25,909 --> 00:29:25,919
non-corrupted
 

1417
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,710
non-corrupted
non-transformed right so you have to

1418
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:27,720
non-transformed right so you have to
 

1419
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,830
non-transformed right so you have to
predict all the

1420
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:28,840
predict all the
 

1421
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,870
predict all the
pixels and there is a huge amount of

1422
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:31,880
pixels and there is a huge amount of
 

1423
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,549
pixels and there is a huge amount of

00:29:33,549 --> 00:29:33,559
resources spent in the system to
 

1425
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:34,990
resources spent in the system to
actually predict all those pixels all

1426
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:35,000
actually predict all those pixels all
 

1427
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,070
actually predict all those pixels all

1430
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:39,360
details uh in a jepa you're not trying
 

1431
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,110
details uh in a jepa you're not trying
to predict all the pixels you're only

1432
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:41,120
to predict all the pixels you're only
 

1433
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,029
to predict all the pixels you're only
trying to predict an abstract

1434
00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:43,039
trying to predict an abstract
 

1435
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,950
trying to predict an abstract
representation of of the inputs right

1436
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:46,960
representation of of the inputs right
 

1437
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,630
representation of of the inputs right
and that's much easier in many ways so

1438
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:49,640
and that's much easier in many ways so
 

1439
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,029
and that's much easier in many ways so
what the japa system when it's being

1440
00:29:51,029 --> 00:29:51,039
what the japa system when it's being
 

1441
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,269
what the japa system when it's being
trained is trying to do is extract as

1442
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:53,279
trained is trying to do is extract as
 

1443
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,110
trained is trying to do is extract as
much information as possible from the

1444
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:55,120
much information as possible from the
 

1445
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,149
much information as possible from the
input but yet only EXT ract information

1446
00:29:58,149 --> 00:29:58,159
input but yet only EXT ract information
 

1447
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,789
input but yet only EXT ract information
that is relatively easily

1448
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:00,799
that is relatively easily
 

1449
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,029
that is relatively easily
predictable okay so there's a lot of

1450
00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:03,039
predictable okay so there's a lot of
 

1451
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,149
predictable okay so there's a lot of
things in the world that we cannot

1452
00:30:04,149 --> 00:30:04,159
things in the world that we cannot
 

1453
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:05,950
things in the world that we cannot
predict like for example if you have a s

1454
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:05,960
predict like for example if you have a s
 

1455
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,549
predict like for example if you have a s
driving car driving down the street or

1456
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:08,559
driving car driving down the street or
 

1457
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,750
driving car driving down the street or
road uh there may be uh trees around the

1458
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:11,760
road uh there may be uh trees around the
 

1459
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,430
road uh there may be uh trees around the
around the road and it could be a windy

1460
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:14,440
around the road and it could be a windy
 

1461
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,590
around the road and it could be a windy
day so the the leaves on the tree are

1462
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:16,600
day so the the leaves on the tree are
 

1463
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,990
day so the the leaves on the tree are
kind of moving in kind of semi chaotic

1464
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:19,000
kind of moving in kind of semi chaotic
 

1465
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,029
kind of moving in kind of semi chaotic
random ways that you can't predict and

1466
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:21,039
random ways that you can't predict and
 

1467
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,669
random ways that you can't predict and
you don't care you don't want to predict

1468
00:30:23,669 --> 00:30:23,679
you don't care you don't want to predict
 

1469
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,389
you don't care you don't want to predict
so what you want is your encoder to

1470
00:30:25,389 --> 00:30:25,399
so what you want is your encoder to
 

1471
00:30:25,399 --> 00:30:27,310
so what you want is your encoder to
basically eliminate all those details

1472
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:27,320
basically eliminate all those details
 

1473
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,830
basically eliminate all those details
will tell you there's moving leaves but

1474
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:28,840
will tell you there's moving leaves but
 

1475
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,110
will tell you there's moving leaves but
it's not going to keep the details of

1476
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:30,120
it's not going to keep the details of
 

1477
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,710
it's not going to keep the details of
exactly what's going on um and so when

1478
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:33,720
exactly what's going on um and so when
 

1479
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,549
exactly what's going on um and so when
you do the prediction in representation

1480
00:30:35,549 --> 00:30:35,559
you do the prediction in representation
 

1481
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:36,870
you do the prediction in representation
space you're not going to have to

1482
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:36,880
space you're not going to have to
 

1483
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,830
space you're not going to have to
predict every single Pixel of a

1484
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:38,840
predict every single Pixel of a
 

1485
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,830
predict every single Pixel of a
relief and that you know um not only is

1486
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:42,840
relief and that you know um not only is
 

1487
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,269
relief and that you know um not only is
a lot simpler but also it allows the

1488
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:45,279
a lot simpler but also it allows the
 

1489
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,029
a lot simpler but also it allows the
system to essentially learn an abstract

1490
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:48,039
system to essentially learn an abstract
 

1491
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:50,549
system to essentially learn an abstract
representation of of the world where you

1492
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:50,559
representation of of the world where you
 

1493
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,470
representation of of the world where you
know what can be modeled and predicted

1494
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:53,480
know what can be modeled and predicted
 

1495
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,909
know what can be modeled and predicted
is preserved and the rest is viewed as

1496
00:30:56,909 --> 00:30:56,919
is preserved and the rest is viewed as
 

1497
00:30:56,919 --> 00:30:59,230
is preserved and the rest is viewed as
noise and eliminated by the encoder so

1498
00:30:59,230 --> 00:30:59,240
noise and eliminated by the encoder so
 

1499
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,350
noise and eliminated by the encoder so
it kind of lifts the level of

1500
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:00,360
it kind of lifts the level of
 

1501
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,470
it kind of lifts the level of
abstraction of the representation if you

1502
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:02,480
abstraction of the representation if you
 

1503
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,830
abstraction of the representation if you
think about this this is something we do

1504
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:03,840
think about this this is something we do
 

1505
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,870
think about this this is something we do
absolutely all the time whenever we

1506
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:05,880
absolutely all the time whenever we
 

1507
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,750
absolutely all the time whenever we
describe a phenomenon we describe it at

1508
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:07,760
describe a phenomenon we describe it at
 

1509
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,269
describe a phenomenon we describe it at
a particular level of abstraction and we

1510
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:10,279
a particular level of abstraction and we
 

1511
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:12,830
a particular level of abstraction and we
don't always describe every natural

1512
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:12,840
don't always describe every natural
 

1513
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,629
don't always describe every natural
phenomenon in terms of quantum field

1514
00:31:14,629 --> 00:31:14,639
phenomenon in terms of quantum field
 

1515
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:17,269
phenomenon in terms of quantum field
Theory right that would be impossible

1516
00:31:17,269 --> 00:31:17,279
Theory right that would be impossible
 

1517
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,430
Theory right that would be impossible
right so we have multiple levels of

1518
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:19,440
right so we have multiple levels of
 

1519
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,029
right so we have multiple levels of
abstraction to describe what happens in

1520
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:21,039
abstraction to describe what happens in
 

1521
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,470
abstraction to describe what happens in
the world you know starting from Quantum

1522
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:23,480
the world you know starting from Quantum
 

1523
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,710
the world you know starting from Quantum
field Theory to like atomic theory and

1524
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:25,720
field Theory to like atomic theory and
 

1525
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,110
field Theory to like atomic theory and
molecules you know in chemistry

1526
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:28,120
molecules you know in chemistry
 

1527
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,310
molecules you know in chemistry
materials and you know all the way up to

1528
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:31,320
materials and you know all the way up to
 

1529
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,870
materials and you know all the way up to
you know kind of concrete objects in the

1530
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:32,880
you know kind of concrete objects in the
 

1531
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,230
you know kind of concrete objects in the
real world and things like that so the

1532
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:35,240
real world and things like that so the
 

1533
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,269
real world and things like that so the
we we can't just only model everything

1534
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:39,279
we we can't just only model everything
 

1535
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,830
we we can't just only model everything
at the lowest level and that that's what

1536
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:41,840
at the lowest level and that that's what
 

1537
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,110
at the lowest level and that that's what
the idea of JEA is really on is really

1538
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:44,120
the idea of JEA is really on is really
 

1539
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:48,029
the idea of JEA is really on is really
about learn abstract representation in a

1540
00:31:48,029 --> 00:31:48,039
about learn abstract representation in a
 

1541
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:50,310
about learn abstract representation in a
self-supervised uh Manner and you know

1542
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:50,320
self-supervised uh Manner and you know
 

1543
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,590
self-supervised uh Manner and you know
you can do it hierarchically as well so

1544
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:52,600
you can do it hierarchically as well so
 

1545
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,590
you can do it hierarchically as well so
that I think is an essential component

1546
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:54,600
that I think is an essential component
 

1547
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,950
that I think is an essential component
of an intelligent system and in language

1548
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:56,960
of an intelligent system and in language
 

1549
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,509
of an intelligent system and in language
we can get away without doing this

1550
00:31:58,509 --> 00:31:58,519
we can get away without doing this
 

1551
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:00,389
we can get away without doing this
because language is already to some

1552
00:32:00,389 --> 00:32:00,399
because language is already to some
 

1553
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,750
because language is already to some
level abstract and already has

1554
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:03,760
level abstract and already has
 

1555
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,669
level abstract and already has
eliminated a lot of information that is

1556
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:05,679
eliminated a lot of information that is
 

1557
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,310
eliminated a lot of information that is
not predictable and um so we can get

1558
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:08,320
not predictable and um so we can get
 

1559
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,710
not predictable and um so we can get
away without doing the tring without you

1560
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:11,720
away without doing the tring without you
 

1561
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,909
away without doing the tring without you
know lifting the abstraction level and

1562
00:32:13,909 --> 00:32:13,919
know lifting the abstraction level and
 

1563
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,830
know lifting the abstraction level and
by directly predicting words so joint

1564
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:16,840
by directly predicting words so joint
 

1565
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,389
by directly predicting words so joint
embedding it's still generative but it's

1566
00:32:20,389 --> 00:32:20,399
embedding it's still generative but it's
 

1567
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,230
embedding it's still generative but it's
generative in this abstract

1568
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:22,240
generative in this abstract
 

1569
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,350
generative in this abstract
representation space yeah and you're

1570
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:24,360
representation space yeah and you're
 

1571
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,750
representation space yeah and you're
saying language we were lazy with

1572
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:26,760
saying language we were lazy with
 

1573
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,789
saying language we were lazy with
language cuz we already got the abstract

1574
00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:28,799
language cuz we already got the abstract
 

1575
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,870
language cuz we already got the abstract
representation for free and now we have

1576
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:30,880
representation for free and now we have
 

1577
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,710
representation for free and now we have
to zoom out actually think about

1578
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:32,720
to zoom out actually think about
 

1579
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,950
to zoom out actually think about
generally intelligent systems we have

1580
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:35,960
generally intelligent systems we have
 

1581
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,710
generally intelligent systems we have
to deal with a full mess of physical

1582
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:38,720
to deal with a full mess of physical
 

1583
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,350
to deal with a full mess of physical
reality of reality and you can't you you

1584
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:41,360
reality of reality and you can't you you
 

1585
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,509
reality of reality and you can't you you
do have to do this step of jumping

1586
00:32:45,509 --> 00:32:45,519
do have to do this step of jumping
 

1587
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:51,269
do have to do this step of jumping
from uh the full Rich detailed reality

1588
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:51,279
from uh the full Rich detailed reality
 

1589
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,909
from uh the full Rich detailed reality
to a uh abstract representation of that

1590
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:53,919
to a uh abstract representation of that
 

1591
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,870
to a uh abstract representation of that
reality based on which you can then

1592
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:55,880
reality based on which you can then
 

1593
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,669
reality based on which you can then
reason and all that kind of stuff right

1594
00:32:57,669 --> 00:32:57,679
reason and all that kind of stuff right
 

1595
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,990
reason and all that kind of stuff right
and the thing is those cell supervised

1596
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:00,000
and the thing is those cell supervised
 

1597
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,070
and the thing is those cell supervised
algorithm that that learn by

1598
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:02,080
algorithm that that learn by
 

1599
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,389
algorithm that that learn by
prediction even in representation space

1600
00:33:05,389 --> 00:33:05,399
prediction even in representation space
 

1601
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:09,909
prediction even in representation space
uh they learn more uh concept if the

1602
00:33:09,909 --> 00:33:09,919
uh they learn more uh concept if the
 

1603
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,269
uh they learn more uh concept if the
input data you Feit them is more

1604
00:33:11,269 --> 00:33:11,279
input data you Feit them is more
 

1605
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,269
input data you Feit them is more
redundant the more redundancy there is

1606
00:33:13,269 --> 00:33:13,279
redundant the more redundancy there is
 

1607
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,870
redundant the more redundancy there is
in the data the more they're able to

1608
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:14,880
in the data the more they're able to
 

1609
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,710
in the data the more they're able to
capture some internal structure of it

1610
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:17,720
capture some internal structure of it
 

1611
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,789
capture some internal structure of it
and so there there is way more

1612
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:19,799
and so there there is way more
 

1613
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:23,509
and so there there is way more
redundancy in structure in perceptual uh

1614
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:23,519
redundancy in structure in perceptual uh
 

1615
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,430
redundancy in structure in perceptual uh
inputs sensory input like like like

00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:27,559
Vision than there is in
 

1619
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:29,990
Vision than there is in
uh text which is not nearly as redundant

1620
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:30,000
uh text which is not nearly as redundant
 

1621
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,310
uh text which is not nearly as redundant
this is back to the question you were

1622
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:31,320
this is back to the question you were
 

1623
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,950
this is back to the question you were
asking a few minutes ago language might

1624
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:33,960
asking a few minutes ago language might
 

1625
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,470
asking a few minutes ago language might
represent more information really

1626
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:35,480
represent more information really
 

1627
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,830
represent more information really
because it's already compressed you're

1629
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,029
because it's already compressed you're
you're right about that but that means

1630
00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:38,039
you're right about that but that means
 

1631
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:41,590
you're right about that but that means
it's also less redundant and so self

1632
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:41,600
it's also less redundant and so self
 

1633
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,269
it's also less redundant and so self

1635
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:48,830

techniques one set is based on
distillation and there's a number of uh

00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:28,160
there's another one also called Dino or
 

1767
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,829
there's another one also called Dino or
dyo also produced from at fair and the

1768
00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:31,839
dyo also produced from at fair and the
 

1769
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,030
dyo also produced from at fair and the
idea of those things is that you take

1770
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:33,040
idea of those things is that you take
 

1771
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,710
idea of those things is that you take
the full input let's say an image uh you

1772
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:35,720
the full input let's say an image uh you
 

1773
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,910
the full input let's say an image uh you
run it through an

1774
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:37,920
run it through an
 

1775
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,349
run it through an
encoder uh produces a representation and

1776
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:41,359
encoder uh produces a representation and
 

1777
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,109
encoder uh produces a representation and
then you corrupt that input or transform

1778
00:36:43,109 --> 00:36:43,119
then you corrupt that input or transform
 

1779
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,030
then you corrupt that input or transform
it running to the essentially what

1780
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:45,040
it running to the essentially what
 

1781
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,670
it running to the essentially what
amounts to the same encoder with some

1782
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:46,680
amounts to the same encoder with some
 

1783
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,470
amounts to the same encoder with some

differences and then train a predictor

1786
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:50,480
differences and then train a predictor
 

1787
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,829
differences and then train a predictor
sometimes to predictor is very simple

1788
00:36:51,829 --> 00:36:51,839
sometimes to predictor is very simple
 

1789
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,390
sometimes to predictor is very simple
sometime doesn't exist but train a

00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:53,400
sometime doesn't exist but train a
 

1791
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,270
sometime doesn't exist but train a
predictor to predict a representation of

the first first uh uncorrupted input

1794
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:58,480
the first first uh uncorrupted input
 

1795
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,589
the first first uh uncorrupted input
from the corrupted input um but you only

1796
00:37:02,589 --> 00:37:02,599
from the corrupted input um but you only
 

1797
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:05,670
from the corrupted input um but you only
train the the second Branch um you only

1798
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:05,680
train the the second Branch um you only
 

1799
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,430
train the the second Branch um you only
train the part of the network that is

1800
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:08,440
train the part of the network that is
 

1801
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,109
train the part of the network that is
fed with the corrupted input the other

1802
00:37:11,109 --> 00:37:11,119
fed with the corrupted input the other
 

1803
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,910
fed with the corrupted input the other
network you don't you don't train but

1804
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:12,920
network you don't you don't train but
 

1805
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,270
network you don't you don't train but
since they share the same weight when

1806
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:14,280
since they share the same weight when
 

1807
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,190
since they share the same weight when
you modify the first one it also

1808
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:16,200
you modify the first one it also
 

1809
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,950
you modify the first one it also
modifies the second one uh and with

1810
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:18,960
modifies the second one uh and with
 

1811
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,230
modifies the second one uh and with
various tricks you can prevent the

1812
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:20,240
various tricks you can prevent the
 

1813
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,790
various tricks you can prevent the
system from collapsing uh with the

1814
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:22,800
system from collapsing uh with the
 

1815
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,309
system from collapsing uh with the
collapse of the type I was explaining

1816
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:24,319
collapse of the type I was explaining
 

1817
00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:25,390
collapse of the type I was explaining
before where the system basically

1818
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:25,400
before where the system basically
 

1819
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,470
before where the system basically
ignores the input

1820
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:27,480
ignores the input
 

1821
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,430
ignores the input
um so that works very well the the

1822
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:31,440
um so that works very well the the
 

1823
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,190
um so that works very well the the
technique with the two techniques we

1824
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:33,200
technique with the two techniques we
 

1825
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,309
technique with the two techniques we
develop at Fair uh dino and uh and IA

1826
00:37:37,309 --> 00:37:37,319
develop at Fair uh dino and uh and IA
 

1827
00:37:37,319 --> 00:37:39,790
develop at Fair uh dino and uh and IA
work really well for that so what kind

1828
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:39,800
work really well for that so what kind
 

1829
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,190
work really well for that so what kind
of data are we talking about here so

1830
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:42,200
of data are we talking about here so
 

1831
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,349
of data are we talking about here so
this the several scenario one uh one

1832
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:44,359
this the several scenario one uh one
 

1833
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:47,870
this the several scenario one uh one
scenario is you take an image you

1834
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:47,880
scenario is you take an image you
 

1835
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,510
scenario is you take an image you
corrupt it by um changing the cropping

1836
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:52,520
corrupt it by um changing the cropping
 

1837
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,030
corrupt it by um changing the cropping
for example changing the size a little

1838
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:54,040
for example changing the size a little
 

1839
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,630
for example changing the size a little
bit maybe changing the orientation

1840
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:55,640
bit maybe changing the orientation
 

1841
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,349
bit maybe changing the orientation
blurring it changing the colors doing

1842
00:37:58,349 --> 00:37:58,359
blurring it changing the colors doing
 

1843
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,150
blurring it changing the colors doing
all kinds of horrible things to it but

1844
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:00,160
all kinds of horrible things to it but
 

1845
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,190
all kinds of horrible things to it but
basic horrible things basic horrible

1846
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:02,200
basic horrible things basic horrible
 

1847
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,630
basic horrible things basic horrible
things that sort of degrade the quality

1848
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:03,640
things that sort of degrade the quality
 

1849
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,990
things that sort of degrade the quality
a little bit and change the framing uh

1850
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:06,000
a little bit and change the framing uh
 

1851
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,710
a little bit and change the framing uh
you know crop the image um or and in

1852
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:10,720
you know crop the image um or and in
 

1853
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,150
you know crop the image um or and in
some cases in the case of a JEA you

1854
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:12,160
some cases in the case of a JEA you
 

1855
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,510
some cases in the case of a JEA you
don't need to do any of this you just

1856
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:13,520
don't need to do any of this you just
 

1857
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,390
don't need to do any of this you just
you just mask some parts of it right you

1858
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:16,400
you just mask some parts of it right you
 

1859
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,470
you just mask some parts of it right you
just basically remove some regions like

1860
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:19,480
just basically remove some regions like
 

1861
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,870
just basically remove some regions like
a big block

1862
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:20,880
a big block
 

1863
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,309
a big block
essentially and and then you know run

1864
00:38:23,309 --> 00:38:23,319
essentially and and then you know run
 

1865
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:25,670
essentially and and then you know run
through the encoders um and train the

1866
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:25,680
through the encoders um and train the
 

1867
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,790
through the encoders um and train the
entire system and and predictor to

1868
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:27,800
entire system and and predictor to
 

1869
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,190
entire system and and predictor to
predict the representation of the good

1870
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:29,200
predict the representation of the good
 

1871
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,550
predict the representation of the good
one from the representation of the

1872
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:30,560
one from the representation of the
 

1873
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,510
one from the representation of the
corrupted

1874
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:31,520
corrupted
 

1875
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,990
corrupted
one um so that's the Ia doesn't need to

1876
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:36,000
one um so that's the Ia doesn't need to
 

1877
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,270
one um so that's the Ia doesn't need to
know that it's an image for example

1878
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:38,280
know that it's an image for example
 

1879
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,470
know that it's an image for example
because the only thing it needs to know

1880
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:39,480
because the only thing it needs to know
 

1881
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,670
because the only thing it needs to know
is how to do this masking um whereas

1882
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:42,680
is how to do this masking um whereas
 

1883
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,309
is how to do this masking um whereas
with doo you need to know it's an image

1884
00:38:44,309 --> 00:38:44,319
with doo you need to know it's an image
 

1885
00:38:44,319 --> 00:38:45,910
with doo you need to know it's an image
because you need to do things like you

1886
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:45,920
because you need to do things like you
 

1887
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,910
because you need to do things like you
know geometri transformation and

1888
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:47,920
know geometri transformation and
 

1889
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,390
know geometri transformation and
blurring and things like that that are

1890
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:49,400
blurring and things like that that are
 

1891
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,670
blurring and things like that that are
really image

1892
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:50,680
really image
 

1893
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,150
really image
specific uh a more recent version of of

1894
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:53,160
specific uh a more recent version of of
 

1895
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,790
specific uh a more recent version of of
this that we have is called V JEA so is

1896
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:54,800
this that we have is called V JEA so is
 

1897
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,150
this that we have is called V JEA so is
basically the same idea as I except um

1898
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:58,160
basically the same idea as I except um
 

1899
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,630
basically the same idea as I except um
it's applied to video so now you take a

1900
00:38:59,630 --> 00:38:59,640
it's applied to video so now you take a
 

1901
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,630
it's applied to video so now you take a
whole video and you mask a whole chunk

1902
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:01,640
whole video and you mask a whole chunk
 

1903
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,829
whole video and you mask a whole chunk
of it and what we mask is actually kind

1904
00:39:03,829 --> 00:39:03,839
of it and what we mask is actually kind
 

1905
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,710
of it and what we mask is actually kind
of a temple tube so an all like a whole

1906
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:06,720
of a temple tube so an all like a whole
 

1907
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,550
of a temple tube so an all like a whole
uh segment of each frame in the video

1908
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:08,560
uh segment of each frame in the video
 

1909
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,910
uh segment of each frame in the video
over the entire video and that tube was

1910
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:10,920
over the entire video and that tube was
 

1911
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,630
over the entire video and that tube was
like statically position throughout the

1912
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:13,640
like statically position throughout the
 

1913
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,069
like statically position throughout the
frames lit straight tube the tube yeah

1914
00:39:17,069 --> 00:39:17,079
frames lit straight tube the tube yeah
 

1915
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:18,950
frames lit straight tube the tube yeah
typically is 16 frames or something and

1916
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:18,960
typically is 16 frames or something and
 

1917
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,230
typically is 16 frames or something and
we mask the same region over the entire

1918
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:21,240
we mask the same region over the entire
 

1919
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,710
we mask the same region over the entire
16 frames it's a different one for every

1920
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:23,720
16 frames it's a different one for every
 

1921
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,069
16 frames it's a different one for every
video obviously and um and then again

1922
00:39:27,069 --> 00:39:27,079
video obviously and um and then again
 

1923
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:29,790
video obviously and um and then again
train that system so as to predict the

1924
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:29,800
train that system so as to predict the
 

1925
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,589
train that system so as to predict the
representation of the full video from

1926
00:39:31,589 --> 00:39:31,599
representation of the full video from
 

1927
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:34,309
representation of the full video from
The partially matched video uh that

1928
00:39:34,309 --> 00:39:34,319
The partially matched video uh that
 

1929
00:39:34,319 --> 00:39:35,990
The partially matched video uh that
works really well it's the first system

1930
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:36,000
works really well it's the first system
 

1931
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,670
works really well it's the first system
that we have that learns good

1932
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:38,680
that we have that learns good
 

1933
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,309
that we have that learns good
representations of video so that when

1934
00:39:40,309 --> 00:39:40,319
representations of video so that when
 

1935
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:42,710
representations of video so that when
you feed those representations to a

1936
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:42,720
you feed those representations to a
 

1937
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,470
you feed those representations to a
supervised uh classifier head it can it

1938
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:45,480
supervised uh classifier head it can it
 

1939
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,950
supervised uh classifier head it can it
can tell you what action is taking place

1940
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:46,960
can tell you what action is taking place
 

1941
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,870
can tell you what action is taking place
in the video with you know pretty good

1942
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:49,880
in the video with you know pretty good
 

1943
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,589
in the video with you know pretty good
accuracy um so that that's it's the

1944
00:39:52,589 --> 00:39:52,599
accuracy um so that that's it's the
 

1945
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,829
accuracy um so that that's it's the
first time we get something of that uh

1946
00:39:54,829 --> 00:39:54,839
first time we get something of that uh
 

1947
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:56,670
first time we get something of that uh
of that quality so that that's a a good

1948
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:56,680
of that quality so that that's a a good
 

1949
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,270
of that quality so that that's a a good
test that a good representation is

1950
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:58,280
test that a good representation is
 

1951
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,670
test that a good representation is
formed that means there's something to

1952
00:39:59,670 --> 00:39:59,680
formed that means there's something to
 

1953
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,470
formed that means there's something to
this yeah um we also preliminary result

1954
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:03,480
this yeah um we also preliminary result
 

1955
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,589
this yeah um we also preliminary result
that seem to indicate that the

1956
00:40:05,589 --> 00:40:05,599
that seem to indicate that the
 

1957
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,470
that seem to indicate that the
representation allows us allow our

1958
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:07,480
representation allows us allow our
 

1959
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:11,309
representation allows us allow our
system to tell whether the video is

1960
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:11,319
system to tell whether the video is
 

1961
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:13,270
system to tell whether the video is
physically possible or completely

1962
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:13,280
physically possible or completely
 

1963
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,670
physically possible or completely
impossible because some object

1964
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:14,680
impossible because some object
 

1965
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,829
impossible because some object
disappeared or an object you know

1966
00:40:16,829 --> 00:40:16,839
disappeared or an object you know
 

1967
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:18,550
disappeared or an object you know
suddenly jumped from one location to

1968
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:18,560
suddenly jumped from one location to
 

1969
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,750
suddenly jumped from one location to
another or or change shape or something

1970
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:21,760
another or or change shape or something
 

1971
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,630
another or or change shape or something
so it's able to capture some physical

1972
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:25,640
so it's able to capture some physical
 

1973
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,510
so it's able to capture some physical
con some physic based constraints about

1974
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:27,520
con some physic based constraints about
 

1975
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,270
con some physic based constraints about
the reality represented in the video

1976
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:29,280
the reality represented in the video
 

1977
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,309
the reality represented in the video
yeah about the appearance and The

1978
00:40:31,309 --> 00:40:31,319
yeah about the appearance and The
 

1979
00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:34,349
yeah about the appearance and The
Disappearance of objects yeah that's

1980
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:34,359
Disappearance of objects yeah that's
 

1981
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:39,109
Disappearance of objects yeah that's
really you okay but C can this

1982
00:40:39,109 --> 00:40:39,119
really you okay but C can this
 

1983
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,550
really you okay but C can this
actually get us to this kind of uh World

1984
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:42,560
actually get us to this kind of uh World
 

1985
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,870
actually get us to this kind of uh World
model

1986
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:43,880
model
 

1987
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,030
model
that understands enough about the world

1988
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:46,040
that understands enough about the world
 

1989
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:50,230
that understands enough about the world
to be able to drive a car uh possibly um

1990
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:50,240
to be able to drive a car uh possibly um
 

1991
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,870
to be able to drive a car uh possibly um
this is going to take a while before we

1992
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:51,880
this is going to take a while before we
 

1993
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,630
this is going to take a while before we
get to that point but um um and there

1994
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:54,640
get to that point but um um and there
 

1995
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,430
get to that point but um um and there
are systems already you know everybody

1996
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:56,440
are systems already you know everybody
 

1997
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,550
are systems already you know everybody
systems that are based on this uh idea

1998
00:40:59,550 --> 00:40:59,560
systems that are based on this uh idea
 

1999
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,109
systems that are based on this uh idea
uh and the what you need for this is a

2000
00:41:03,109 --> 00:41:03,119
uh and the what you need for this is a
 

2001
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,550
uh and the what you need for this is a
slightly modified version of this where

2002
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:05,560
slightly modified version of this where
 

2003
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,750
slightly modified version of this where
um imagine that you

2004
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:07,760
um imagine that you
 

2005
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,510
um imagine that you
have uh a video and the a complete video

2006
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:12,520
have uh a video and the a complete video
 

2007
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,069
have uh a video and the a complete video
and what you're doing to this video is

2008
00:41:14,069 --> 00:41:14,079
and what you're doing to this video is
 

2009
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:17,030
and what you're doing to this video is
that you're either translating it in

2010
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:17,040
that you're either translating it in
 

2011
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,950
that you're either translating it in
time towards the future so you only see

2012
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:18,960
time towards the future so you only see
 

2013
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,270
time towards the future so you only see
the beginning of the video but you don't

2014
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:20,280
the beginning of the video but you don't
 

2015
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,510
the beginning of the video but you don't
see the latter part of it that is in the

2016
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:22,520
see the latter part of it that is in the
 

2017
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,510
see the latter part of it that is in the
original one or you just mask the second

2018
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:25,520
original one or you just mask the second
 

2019
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,190
original one or you just mask the second
half of the video for example um and

2020
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:28,200
half of the video for example um and
 

2021
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,109
half of the video for example um and
then you you train a JEA system of the

2022
00:41:31,109 --> 00:41:31,119
then you you train a JEA system of the
 

2023
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,710
then you you train a JEA system of the
type I describe to predict the

2024
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:32,720
type I describe to predict the
 

2025
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,190
type I describe to predict the
representation of the full video from

2026
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:34,200
representation of the full video from
 

2027
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,470
representation of the full video from
the the shifted one but you also feed

2028
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:37,480
the the shifted one but you also feed
 

2029
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,430
the the shifted one but you also feed
the predictor with an action for example

2030
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:40,440
the predictor with an action for example
 

2031
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,750
the predictor with an action for example
you know the wheel is turned 10 degrees

2032
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:42,760
you know the wheel is turned 10 degrees
 

2033
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,470
you know the wheel is turned 10 degrees
to the to the right or something right

2034
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:45,480
to the to the right or something right
 

2035
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,870
to the to the right or something right
so if it's a you know a dash cam in a

2036
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:48,880
so if it's a you know a dash cam in a
 

2037
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,270
so if it's a you know a dash cam in a
car and you know the angle of the wheel

2038
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:51,280
car and you know the angle of the wheel
 

2039
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,550
car and you know the angle of the wheel
you should be able to predict to some

2040
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:52,560
you should be able to predict to some
 

2041
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,150
you should be able to predict to some
extent what's going what's going to go

2042
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:54,160
extent what's going what's going to go
 

2043
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,550
extent what's going what's going to go
what's going to happen to which to see

2044
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:57,560
what's going to happen to which to see
 

2045
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,750
what's going to happen to which to see
uh you're not going to be able to

2046
00:41:58,750 --> 00:41:58,760
uh you're not going to be able to
 

2047
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,589
uh you're not going to be able to
predict all the details of you know

2048
00:42:00,589 --> 00:42:00,599
predict all the details of you know
 

2049
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:02,230
predict all the details of you know
objects that appear in the view

2050
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:02,240
objects that appear in the view
 

2051
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,829
objects that appear in the view
obviously but at a abstract

2052
00:42:04,829 --> 00:42:04,839
obviously but at a abstract
 

2053
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:06,670
obviously but at a abstract
representation level you can you can

2054
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:06,680
representation level you can you can
 

2055
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,589
representation level you can you can
probably predict what's going to happen

2056
00:42:08,589 --> 00:42:08,599
probably predict what's going to happen
 

2057
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:10,510
probably predict what's going to happen
so now what you have

2058
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:10,520
so now what you have
 

2059
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,550
so now what you have
is a internal model that says here is my

2060
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:13,560
is a internal model that says here is my
 

2061
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,190
is a internal model that says here is my
idea of state of the world at time T

2062
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:15,200
idea of state of the world at time T
 

2063
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,150
idea of state of the world at time T
here is an action I'm taking here's a

2064
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:18,160
here is an action I'm taking here's a
 

2065
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,390
here is an action I'm taking here's a
prediction of the state of the world at

2066
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:19,400
prediction of the state of the world at
 

2067
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,589
prediction of the state of the world at
time t plus one t plus Delta t t plus 2

2068
00:42:22,589 --> 00:42:22,599
time t plus one t plus Delta t t plus 2
 

2069
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:24,710
time t plus one t plus Delta t t plus 2
seconds whatever it is if you have a

2070
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:24,720
seconds whatever it is if you have a
 

2071
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,990
seconds whatever it is if you have a
model of this type you can use it for

2072
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:27,000
model of this type you can use it for
 

2073
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,309
model of this type you can use it for
planning so now you can do what llms

2074
00:42:30,309 --> 00:42:30,319
planning so now you can do what llms
 

2075
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:32,910
planning so now you can do what llms
cannot do which is planning what you're

2076
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:32,920
cannot do which is planning what you're
 

2077
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,630
cannot do which is planning what you're
going to do so as to arrive at a

2078
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:35,640
going to do so as to arrive at a
 

2079
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,670
going to do so as to arrive at a
particular uh outcome or satisfy a

2080
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:38,680
particular uh outcome or satisfy a
 

2081
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,150
particular uh outcome or satisfy a
particular objective right so you can

2082
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:41,160
particular objective right so you can
 

2083
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,150
particular objective right so you can
have a number of

2084
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:43,160
have a number of
 

2085
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,190
have a number of
objectives um right if you know I can I

2086
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:46,200
objectives um right if you know I can I
 

2087
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,710
objectives um right if you know I can I
can predict that uh if I have uh an

2088
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:49,720
can predict that uh if I have uh an
 

2089
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,790
can predict that uh if I have uh an
object like this right and I open my

2090
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:51,800
object like this right and I open my
 

2091
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,950
object like this right and I open my
hand it's going to fall right and uh and

2092
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:55,960
hand it's going to fall right and uh and
 

2093
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,589
hand it's going to fall right and uh and
if if I push it with a particular force

2094
00:42:57,589 --> 00:42:57,599
if if I push it with a particular force
 

2095
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,030
if if I push it with a particular force
on the table it's going to move if I

2096
00:42:59,030 --> 00:42:59,040
on the table it's going to move if I
 

2097
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,470
on the table it's going to move if I
push the table itself it's probably not

2098
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:00,480
push the table itself it's probably not
 

2099
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,549
push the table itself it's probably not
going to move uh with the same Force um

2100
00:43:03,549 --> 00:43:03,559
going to move uh with the same Force um
 

2101
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:05,990
going to move uh with the same Force um
so we have we have this internal model

2102
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:06,000
so we have we have this internal model
 

2103
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,710
so we have we have this internal model
of the world in our in our mind uh which

2104
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:09,720
of the world in our in our mind uh which
 

2105
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,670
of the world in our in our mind uh which
allows us to plan sequences of actions

2106
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:11,680
allows us to plan sequences of actions
 

2107
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,549
allows us to plan sequences of actions
to arrive at a particular goal um and so

2108
00:43:15,549 --> 00:43:15,559
to arrive at a particular goal um and so
 

2109
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:18,549
to arrive at a particular goal um and so
um so now if you have this world model

2110
00:43:18,549 --> 00:43:18,559
um so now if you have this world model
 

2111
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:21,549
um so now if you have this world model
we can imagine a sequence of actions

2112
00:43:21,549 --> 00:43:21,559
we can imagine a sequence of actions
 

2113
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:23,150
we can imagine a sequence of actions
predict what the outcome of the sequence

2114
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:23,160
predict what the outcome of the sequence
 

2115
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,829
predict what the outcome of the sequence
of action is going to be measure to what

2116
00:43:25,829 --> 00:43:25,839
of action is going to be measure to what
 

2117
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:26,670
of action is going to be measure to what
extent

2118
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:26,680
extent
 

2119
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,990
extent
the final State satisfies a particular

2120
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:30,000
the final State satisfies a particular
 

2121
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,990
the final State satisfies a particular
objective like you know moving the

2122
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:33,000
objective like you know moving the
 

2123
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,069
objective like you know moving the
bottle to the left of the

2124
00:43:35,069 --> 00:43:35,079
bottle to the left of the
 

2125
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:37,990
bottle to the left of the
table um and then plan a sequence of

2126
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:38,000
table um and then plan a sequence of
 

2127
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,910
table um and then plan a sequence of
actions that will minimize this

2128
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:39,920
actions that will minimize this
 

2129
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,790
actions that will minimize this
objective at run time we're not talking

2130
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:41,800
objective at run time we're not talking
 

2131
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,030
objective at run time we're not talking
about learning we're talking about

2132
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:43,040
about learning we're talking about
 

2133
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,030
about learning we're talking about
inference time right so this is planning

2134
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:45,040
inference time right so this is planning
 

2135
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,470
inference time right so this is planning
really and in optimal control this is a

2136
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:47,480
really and in optimal control this is a
 

2137
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,190
really and in optimal control this is a
very classical thing it's called Uh

2138
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:49,200
very classical thing it's called Uh
 

2139
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,470
very classical thing it's called Uh
model predictive control you have a

2140
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:51,480
model predictive control you have a
 

2141
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,750
model predictive control you have a
model of the system you want to control

2142
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:53,760
model of the system you want to control
 

2143
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,750
model of the system you want to control
that you know can predict the sequence

2144
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:55,760
that you know can predict the sequence
 

2145
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,309
that you know can predict the sequence
of State St corresponding to a sequence

2146
00:43:57,309 --> 00:43:57,319
of State St corresponding to a sequence
 

2147
00:43:57,319 --> 00:43:58,069
of State St corresponding to a sequence
of

2148
00:43:58,069 --> 00:43:58,079
of
 

2149
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,710
of
commands and you're planning a sequence

2150
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:00,720
commands and you're planning a sequence
 

2151
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,510
commands and you're planning a sequence
of commands so that according to your

2152
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:03,520
of commands so that according to your
 

2153
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,950
of commands so that according to your
world model the the the end state of the

2154
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:05,960
world model the the the end state of the
 

2155
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,790
world model the the the end state of the
system will uh satisfy an objectives

2156
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:09,800
system will uh satisfy an objectives
 

2157
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,190
system will uh satisfy an objectives
that you fix this is the

2158
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:12,200
that you fix this is the
 

2159
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,630
that you fix this is the
way uh you know rocket trajectories have

2160
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:15,640
way uh you know rocket trajectories have
 

2161
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,349
way uh you know rocket trajectories have
been planned since computers have been

2162
00:44:17,349 --> 00:44:17,359
been planned since computers have been
 

2163
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:19,030
been planned since computers have been
around so since the early 60s

2164
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:19,040
around so since the early 60s
 

2165
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,390
around so since the early 60s
essentially so yes for model predictive

2166
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:21,400
essentially so yes for model predictive
 

2167
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,630
essentially so yes for model predictive
control but you also often talk about

2168
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:24,640
control but you also often talk about
 

2169
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,990
control but you also often talk about
hierarchical planning can hierarchical

2170
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:27,000
hierarchical planning can hierarchical
 

2171
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,109
hierarchical planning can hierarchical
planning emerge from this somehow well

2172
00:44:29,109 --> 00:44:29,119
planning emerge from this somehow well
 

2173
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:31,630
planning emerge from this somehow well
so no you you will have to build

2174
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:31,640
so no you you will have to build
 

2175
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,630
so no you you will have to build
specific architecture to allow for

2176
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:33,640
specific architecture to allow for
 

2177
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,069
specific architecture to allow for
hierarchical planning so hierarchical

2178
00:44:35,069 --> 00:44:35,079
hierarchical planning so hierarchical
 

2179
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:36,990
hierarchical planning so hierarchical
planning is absolutely necessary if you

2180
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:37,000
planning is absolutely necessary if you
 

2181
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,430
planning is absolutely necessary if you
want to plan complex

2182
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:39,440
want to plan complex
 

2183
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,910
want to plan complex
actions uh if I want to go from let's

2184
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:41,920
actions uh if I want to go from let's
 

2185
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,470
actions uh if I want to go from let's
say from New York to Paris this the

2186
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:43,480
say from New York to Paris this the
 

2187
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,510
say from New York to Paris this the
example I use all the time and I'm

2188
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:45,520
example I use all the time and I'm
 

2189
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,430
example I use all the time and I'm
sitting uh in my office at NYU my

2190
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:48,440
sitting uh in my office at NYU my
 

2191
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,589
sitting uh in my office at NYU my
objective that I need to minimize is my

2192
00:44:50,589 --> 00:44:50,599
objective that I need to minimize is my
 

2193
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:53,710
objective that I need to minimize is my
distance to Paris at a high level a very

2194
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:53,720
distance to Paris at a high level a very
 

2195
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:56,230
distance to Paris at a high level a very
astract representation of my uh my

2196
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:56,240
astract representation of my uh my
 

2197
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,270
astract representation of my uh my
location I would have to decompose this

2198
00:44:58,270 --> 00:44:58,280
location I would have to decompose this
 

2199
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,630
location I would have to decompose this
into two sub goals first one is um go to

2200
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:01,640
into two sub goals first one is um go to
 

2201
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,150
into two sub goals first one is um go to
the airport second one is catch a plane

2202
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:03,160
the airport second one is catch a plane
 

2203
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,390
the airport second one is catch a plane
to Paris okay so my sub goal is

2204
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:06,400
to Paris okay so my sub goal is
 

2205
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,630
to Paris okay so my sub goal is
now uh going to the airport my objective

2206
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:09,640
now uh going to the airport my objective
 

2207
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,510
now uh going to the airport my objective
function is my distance to the

2208
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:11,520
function is my distance to the
 

2209
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,150
function is my distance to the
airport how do I go to the airport where

2210
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:14,160
airport how do I go to the airport where
 

2211
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,150
airport how do I go to the airport where

2214
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:19,400
which you can do in New
 

2215
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,589
which you can do in New
York um okay now I have another sub goal

go down on the street uh well that means

2218
00:45:26,109 --> 00:45:26,119
go down on the street uh well that means
 

2219
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:28,230
go down on the street uh well that means
going to the elevator going down the

2220

going to the elevator going down the
 

2221
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,270
going to the elevator going down the
elevator walk out the street how do I go

2222
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:31,280
elevator walk out the street how do I go
 

2223
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,950
elevator walk out the street how do I go
to the elevator I have to

2224
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:33,960
to the elevator I have to
 

2225
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,750
to the elevator I have to
uh stand up from my chair open the door

2226
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:36,760
uh stand up from my chair open the door
 

2227
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,349
uh stand up from my chair open the door
of my office go to the elevator push

2228
00:45:39,349 --> 00:45:39,359
of my office go to the elevator push
 

2229
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,430
of my office go to the elevator push
push the button how do I get up from my

2230
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:41,440
push the button how do I get up from my
 

2231
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,349
push the button how do I get up from my
chair like you know you can imagine

2232
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:43,359
chair like you know you can imagine
 

2233
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:46,870
chair like you know you can imagine
going down all the way down to basically

2234
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:46,880
going down all the way down to basically
 

2235
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,069
going down all the way down to basically
what amounts to millisecond by

2236
00:45:48,069 --> 00:45:48,079
what amounts to millisecond by
 

2237
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,470
what amounts to millisecond by
millisecond muscle

2238
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:49,480
millisecond muscle
 

2239
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,589
millisecond muscle
control okay and obviously you're not

2240
00:45:52,589 --> 00:45:52,599
control okay and obviously you're not
 

2241
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:55,190
control okay and obviously you're not
going to plan your entire trip from New

2242
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:55,200
going to plan your entire trip from New
 

2243
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,470
going to plan your entire trip from New
York to Paris

2244
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:56,480
York to Paris
 

2245
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,549
York to Paris
in terms of millisecond by millisecond

2246
00:45:58,549 --> 00:45:58,559
in terms of millisecond by millisecond
 

2247
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:00,750
in terms of millisecond by millisecond
muscle control first that would be

2248
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:00,760
muscle control first that would be
 

2249
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,870
muscle control first that would be
incredibly expensive but it will also be

2250
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:02,880
incredibly expensive but it will also be
 

2251
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,390
incredibly expensive but it will also be
completely impossible because you don't

2252
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:04,400
completely impossible because you don't
 

2253
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,790
completely impossible because you don't
know all the conditions of what's going

2254
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:06,800
know all the conditions of what's going
 

2255
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,990
know all the conditions of what's going
to happen uh you know how long it's

2256
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:09,000
to happen uh you know how long it's
 

2257
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,230
to happen uh you know how long it's
going to take to catch a taxi um or to

2258
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:12,240
going to take to catch a taxi um or to
 

2259
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,109
going to take to catch a taxi um or to
go to the airport with traffic you know

2260
00:46:14,109 --> 00:46:14,119
go to the airport with traffic you know
 

2261
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:16,109
go to the airport with traffic you know
uh I mean you you would have to know

2262
00:46:16,109 --> 00:46:16,119
uh I mean you you would have to know
 

2263
00:46:16,119 --> 00:46:17,990
uh I mean you you would have to know
exactly the condition of everything to

2264
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:18,000
exactly the condition of everything to

00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,270
be able to do this planning and you
don't have the information so you you

00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:22,280
don't have the information so you you
 

2269
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,030
don't have the information so you you
have to do this hierarchical planning so

00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,270
a list of 10 steps to make each one of
those until you're moving your mus

2310
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:14,280
those until you're moving your mus
 

2311
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:18,190

you can actually act upon using your
 

2315
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:23,069
you can actually act upon using your
mind right so there's a lot of questions

2316
00:47:23,069 --> 00:47:23,079
mind right so there's a lot of questions
 

2317
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:24,589
mind right so there's a lot of questions
that are sort implied by this right so

2318
00:47:24,589 --> 00:47:24,599
that are sort implied by this right so

00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:27,349
that are sort implied by this right so
the first thing is llms will be able to

the first thing is llms will be able to
 

2321
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,030
the first thing is llms will be able to
answer some of those questions down to

00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:29,040
answer some of those questions down to
 

2323
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,309
answer some of those questions down to
some level of

exraction under the condition that
 

2327
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,069
exraction under the condition that
they've been trained with similar

they've been trained with similar
 

2329
00:47:35,079 --> 00:47:37,390
they've been trained with similar
scenarios in their training set they

00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:37,400
scenarios in their training set they
 

2331
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,230
scenarios in their training set they
would be able to answer all those

2332
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:39,240
would be able to answer all those
 

2333
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:42,109
would be able to answer all those
questions but some of them may be

2334
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:42,119
questions but some of them may be
 

2335
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:44,390
questions but some of them may be
hallucinated meaning non-factual yeah

2336
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:44,400
hallucinated meaning non-factual yeah

true I mean they will probably produce
 

2339
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,990
true I mean they will probably produce
some answer except they're not going to

00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:47,000
some answer except they're not going to
 

2341
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,430
some answer except they're not going to
be able to really kind of produce

00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:48,440
be able to really kind of produce

00:48:11,319 --> 00:48:12,910
going to have to regurgitate the
template that they've been trained on

2368
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:12,920
template that they've been trained on
 

2369
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,950
template that they've been trained on
but where like just for the example of

2370
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:14,960
but where like just for the example of
 

2371
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,710
but where like just for the example of
New York to Paris is is it going to

2372
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:16,720
New York to Paris is is it going to
 

2373
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,309
New York to Paris is is it going to
start getting into trouble like at which

2374
00:48:19,309 --> 00:48:19,319
start getting into trouble like at which
 

2375
00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:21,670
start getting into trouble like at which
layer layer of abstraction do you think

2376
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:21,680
layer layer of abstraction do you think
 

2377
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,430
layer layer of abstraction do you think
you'll start cuz like I can imagine

2378
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:23,440
you'll start cuz like I can imagine
 

2379
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,750
you'll start cuz like I can imagine
almost every single part of that anal

2380
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:25,760
almost every single part of that anal
 

2381
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:26,829
almost every single part of that anal
will be able to answer somewhat

2382
00:48:26,829 --> 00:48:26,839
will be able to answer somewhat
 

2383
00:48:26,839 --> 00:48:28,309
will be able to answer somewhat
accurately especially when you're

2384
00:48:28,309 --> 00:48:28,319
accurately especially when you're
 

2385
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:30,030
accurately especially when you're
talking about New York and Paris major

2386
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:30,040
talking about New York and Paris major
 

2387
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,430
talking about New York and Paris major
cities so I mean certainly uh LM would

2388
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:33,440
cities so I mean certainly uh LM would
 

2389
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,069
cities so I mean certainly uh LM would
be able to solve that problem if you f

2390
00:48:35,069 --> 00:48:35,079
be able to solve that problem if you f
 

2391
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:39,030
be able to solve that problem if you f
tun need for it you know just uh and and

2392
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:39,040
tun need for it you know just uh and and
 

2393
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,109
tun need for it you know just uh and and
so uh I can't say that nlm cannot do

2394
00:48:42,109 --> 00:48:42,119
so uh I can't say that nlm cannot do
 

2395
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:43,589
so uh I can't say that nlm cannot do
this it can do this if you train it for

2396
00:48:43,589 --> 00:48:43,599
this it can do this if you train it for
 

2397
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:46,109
this it can do this if you train it for
it there's no question uh down to a

2398
00:48:46,109 --> 00:48:46,119
it there's no question uh down to a
 

2399
00:48:46,119 --> 00:48:49,190
it there's no question uh down to a
certain level where things can be

2400
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:49,200
certain level where things can be
 

2401
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,589
certain level where things can be
formulated in terms of words but like if

2402
00:48:51,589 --> 00:48:51,599
formulated in terms of words but like if
 

2403
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,430
formulated in terms of words but like if
you want to go down to like how do you

2404
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:53,440
you want to go down to like how do you
 

2405
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,069
you want to go down to like how do you
you know climb down the stairs or just

2406
00:48:55,069 --> 00:48:55,079
you know climb down the stairs or just
 

2407
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:57,150
you know climb down the stairs or just
stand up from your chair in terms of uh

2408
00:48:57,150 --> 00:48:57,160
stand up from your chair in terms of uh
 

2409
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,270
stand up from your chair in terms of uh
words like you you can't you can't do it

2410
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:00,280
words like you you can't you can't do it
 

2411
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,589
words like you you can't you can't do it
um you you need that's one of the

2412
00:49:02,589 --> 00:49:02,599
um you you need that's one of the
 

2413
00:49:02,599 --> 00:49:05,390
um you you need that's one of the
reasons you need experience of the

2414
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:05,400
reasons you need experience of the
 

2415
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,069
reasons you need experience of the
physical world which is much higher

2416
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:07,079
physical world which is much higher
 

2417
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:08,870
physical world which is much higher
bandwidth than what you can express in

2418
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:08,880
bandwidth than what you can express in
 

2419
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,470
bandwidth than what you can express in
words in human language so everything

2420
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:11,480
words in human language so everything
 

2421
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:12,910
words in human language so everything
we've been talking about on the joint

2422
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:12,920
we've been talking about on the joint
 

2423
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,750
we've been talking about on the joint
embedding space is it possible that

2424
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:15,760
embedding space is it possible that
 

2425
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,430
embedding space is it possible that
that's what we need for like the

2426
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:17,440
that's what we need for like the
 

2427
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,270
that's what we need for like the
interaction with physical reality for on

2428
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:19,280
interaction with physical reality for on
 

2429
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,030
interaction with physical reality for on
the robotics front and then just the

2430
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:22,040
the robotics front and then just the
 

2431
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,349
the robotics front and then just the
llms are the thing that sits on top of

2432
00:49:24,349 --> 00:49:24,359
llms are the thing that sits on top of
 

2433
00:49:24,359 --> 00:49:27,670
llms are the thing that sits on top of
it for the bigger reasoning about like

2434
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:27,680
it for the bigger reasoning about like
 

2435
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,710
it for the bigger reasoning about like
yeah the fact that I need to book a

2436
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:29,720
yeah the fact that I need to book a
 

2437
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,870
yeah the fact that I need to book a
plane ticket and I need to know I know

2438
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:31,880
plane ticket and I need to know I know
 

2439
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,109
plane ticket and I need to know I know
how to go to the websites and so on sure

2440
00:49:34,109 --> 00:49:34,119
how to go to the websites and so on sure
 

2441
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:36,270
how to go to the websites and so on sure
and you know a lot of plans that people

2442
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:36,280
and you know a lot of plans that people
 

2443
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,430
and you know a lot of plans that people
know about um that are relatively high

2444
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:39,440
know about um that are relatively high
 

2445
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,349
know about um that are relatively high
level are actually learned they're not

2446
00:49:41,349 --> 00:49:41,359
level are actually learned they're not
 

2447
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:44,950
level are actually learned they're not
people most people don't invent the you

2448
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:44,960
people most people don't invent the you
 

2449
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,390
people most people don't invent the you
know plans um uh they

2450
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:48,400
know plans um uh they
 

2451
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,390
know plans um uh they
they by themselves they uh you know we

2452
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:51,400
they by themselves they uh you know we
 

2453
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,470
they by themselves they uh you know we
have some ability to do this of course

2454
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:53,480
have some ability to do this of course
 

2455
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,190
have some ability to do this of course
uh obviously but um but but most plants

2456
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:56,200
uh obviously but um but but most plants
 

2457
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,109
uh obviously but um but but most plants
that people use are plants that they've

2458
00:49:58,109 --> 00:49:58,119
that people use are plants that they've
 

2459
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:00,190
that people use are plants that they've
been trained on like they've seen other

2460
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:00,200
been trained on like they've seen other
 

2461
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,549
been trained on like they've seen other
people use those plants or they've been

2462
00:50:01,549 --> 00:50:01,559
people use those plants or they've been
 

2463
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:04,309
people use those plants or they've been
told how to do things right um that you

2464
00:50:04,309 --> 00:50:04,319
told how to do things right um that you
 

2465
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:07,589
told how to do things right um that you
can't invent how you like take a person

2466
00:50:07,589 --> 00:50:07,599
can't invent how you like take a person
 

2467
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:09,789
can't invent how you like take a person
who's never heard of airplanes and tell

2468
00:50:09,789 --> 00:50:09,799
who's never heard of airplanes and tell
 

2469
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:11,109
who's never heard of airplanes and tell
them like how do you go from New York to

2470
00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:11,119
them like how do you go from New York to
 

2471
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,630
them like how do you go from New York to
Paris and they're probably not going to

2472
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:13,640
Paris and they're probably not going to
 

2473
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,309
Paris and they're probably not going to
be able to kind of you know deconstruct

2474
00:50:15,309 --> 00:50:15,319
be able to kind of you know deconstruct
 

2475
00:50:15,319 --> 00:50:16,950
be able to kind of you know deconstruct
the whole plan unless they've seen

2476
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:16,960
the whole plan unless they've seen
 

2477
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,230
the whole plan unless they've seen
examples of that before um so certainly

2478
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:19,240
examples of that before um so certainly
 

2479
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,109
examples of that before um so certainly
LMS are going to be able to do this but

2480
00:50:21,109 --> 00:50:21,119
LMS are going to be able to do this but
 

2481
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,670
LMS are going to be able to do this but
but then um how you link this from the

2482
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:24,680
but then um how you link this from the
 

2483
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,270
but then um how you link this from the
the low level

2484
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:26,280
the low level
 

2485
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:30,190
the low level
of of of actions uh that needs to be

2486
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:30,200
of of of actions uh that needs to be
 

2487
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,910
of of of actions uh that needs to be
done with things like like Jad that

2488
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:31,920
done with things like like Jad that
 

2489
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,789
done with things like like Jad that
basically lift the abstraction level of

2490
00:50:33,789 --> 00:50:33,799
basically lift the abstraction level of
 

2491
00:50:33,799 --> 00:50:35,430
basically lift the abstraction level of
the representation without attempting to

2492
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:35,440
the representation without attempting to
 

2493
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,069
the representation without attempting to
reconstruct every detail of the

2494
00:50:37,069 --> 00:50:37,079
reconstruct every detail of the
 

2495
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:40,789
reconstruct every detail of the
situation that's why we need Jass for I

2496
00:50:40,789 --> 00:50:40,799
situation that's why we need Jass for I
 

2497
00:50:40,799 --> 00:50:43,470
situation that's why we need Jass for I
would love to sort of Linger on your

2498
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:43,480
would love to sort of Linger on your
 

2499
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:44,910
would love to sort of Linger on your
skepticism

2500
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:44,920
skepticism
 

2501
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:47,470
skepticism
around uh autoaggressive

2502
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:47,480
around uh autoaggressive
 

2503
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:51,030
around uh autoaggressive
llms so one way I would like to test

2504
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:51,040
llms so one way I would like to test
 

2505
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,670
llms so one way I would like to test
that skepticism is everything you say

2506
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:53,680
that skepticism is everything you say
 

2507
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,549
that skepticism is everything you say
makes a lot of sense

2508
00:50:57,549 --> 00:50:57,559

 

2509
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:00,510

but if I apply everything you said today

2510
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:00,520
but if I apply everything you said today
 

2511
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,549
but if I apply everything you said today
and in general to like I don't know 10

2512
00:51:03,549 --> 00:51:03,559
and in general to like I don't know 10
 

2513
00:51:03,559 --> 00:51:05,630
and in general to like I don't know 10
years ago maybe a little bit less no

2514
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:05,640
years ago maybe a little bit less no
 

2515
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:08,270
years ago maybe a little bit less no
let's say three years ago I wouldn't be

2516
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:08,280
let's say three years ago I wouldn't be
 

2517
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,549
let's say three years ago I wouldn't be
able to

2518
00:51:09,549 --> 00:51:09,559
able to
 

2519
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:14,150
able to
predict the uh success of llms so does

2520
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:14,160
predict the uh success of llms so does
 

2521
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,309
predict the uh success of llms so does
it make sense to you that autoaggressive

2522
00:51:16,309 --> 00:51:16,319
it make sense to you that autoaggressive
 

2523
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:19,710
it make sense to you that autoaggressive
llms are able to be so damn

2524
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:19,720
llms are able to be so damn

good yes can you explain your intuition

2526
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:24,240
good yes can you explain your intuition
 

2527
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,270
good yes can you explain your intuition
because if I were to take your wisdom

2528
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:27,280
because if I were to take your wisdom
 

2529
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,030
because if I were to take your wisdom
and

2530
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:28,040
and
 

2531
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,549
and
intuition at face value I would say

2532
00:51:30,549 --> 00:51:30,559
intuition at face value I would say
 

2533
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:33,069
intuition at face value I would say
there's no way autoaggressive LMS one

kind of things they're doing no there's
 

2539
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:40,150
kind of things they're doing no there's
one thing that auto llms uh or that llms

it's self-supervised learning and I've
 

2549
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,270
it's self-supervised learning and I've
been a very very strong advocate of self

that are come before right and you do
 

2617
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,390
that are come before right and you do
this by the constraining the

2678
00:54:27,349 --> 00:54:27,359
learning yeah yes but again the same

00:54:30,069 --> 00:54:30,079
intuition you're applying to saying that

00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:33,430
intuition you're applying to saying that
autor regressive llms cannot have a deep

autor regressive llms cannot have a deep
understanding of the world if we just

2684
00:54:35,589 --> 00:54:35,599
understanding of the world if we just
 

2685
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:38,470
understanding of the world if we just
apply that same intuition does it make

2686
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:38,480
apply that same intuition does it make
 

2687
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,630
apply that same intuition does it make
sense to you that they're able to form

enough of a representation of the world

2690
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:43,640
enough of a representation of the world
 

2691
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:46,270
enough of a representation of the world
to be damn convincing

fooled by their fluency right we just
 

2699
00:54:53,559 --> 00:54:56,510
fooled by their fluency right we just

hanging out with it an Turing would
 

2715
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,430
hanging out with it an Turing would
decide that a Turing test is a really

decide that a Turing test is a really
 

2717
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,190
decide that a Turing test is a really

00:55:25,309 --> 00:55:25,319
marvac say about the about the large
 

2727
00:55:25,319 --> 00:55:27,349
marvac say about the about the large
language models hence Marv would say the

everybody would be impressed but uh you
 

2737
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,069
everybody would be impressed but uh you
know uh it's not a question of being

00:55:41,069 --> 00:55:41,079
impressed or not it's a question of
 

2741
00:55:41,079 --> 00:55:42,589
impressed or not it's a question of

2745
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,789
can do like there again they are
impressive they can do a lot of useful

2751
00:55:50,039 --> 00:55:52,910
being built around them they're going to
make progress uh but there is a lot of

00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:52,920
make progress uh but there is a lot of
 

2753
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,069
make progress uh but there is a lot of
things they cannot do and we have to

2754
00:55:54,069 --> 00:55:54,079
things they cannot do and we have to
 

2755
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:56,670
things they cannot do and we have to
realize what they cannot do do and uh

2756
00:55:56,670 --> 00:55:56,680
realize what they cannot do do and uh
 

2757
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:59,390
realize what they cannot do do and uh
and then figure out you know how we get

2758
00:55:59,390 --> 00:55:59,400
and then figure out you know how we get
 

2759
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,069
and then figure out you know how we get
there and you know and and I'm not

back more than 10 years but the IDE of
 

2771
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,829
back more than 10 years but the IDE of
cell supervis learning so basically

00:56:15,829 --> 00:56:15,839
cell supervis learning so basically
 

2773
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:18,630

2783
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,589

um you know the the conference I

2784
00:56:27,589 --> 00:56:27,599
um you know the the conference I
 

2785
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:29,829
um you know the the conference I
co-founded 14 years ago is called inter

2786
00:56:29,829 --> 00:56:29,839
co-founded 14 years ago is called inter

International Conference on learning

2788
00:56:31,029 --> 00:56:31,039
International Conference on learning
 

2789
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:33,270
International Conference on learning
representations that's the entire issue

2790
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:33,280
representations that's the entire issue
 

2791
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,069
representations that's the entire issue
that deep learning is is dealing with

2792
00:56:35,069 --> 00:56:35,079
that deep learning is is dealing with
 

2793
00:56:35,079 --> 00:56:37,230
that deep learning is is dealing with
right and it's been my obsession for you

2794
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:37,240
right and it's been my obsession for you
 

2795
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,870
right and it's been my obsession for you
know almost 40 years now so um so

2796
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:39,880
know almost 40 years now so um so
 

2797
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,309
know almost 40 years now so um so
learning representation is really the

2798
00:56:41,309 --> 00:56:41,319
learning representation is really the
 

2799
00:56:41,319 --> 00:56:43,630
learning representation is really the
thing uh for the longest time we could

2800
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:43,640
thing uh for the longest time we could
 

2801
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,589
thing uh for the longest time we could
only do this with supervised learning

2802
00:56:45,589 --> 00:56:45,599
only do this with supervised learning
 

2803
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,870
only do this with supervised learning
and then we started working on uh you

2804
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:47,880
and then we started working on uh you
 

2805
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,670
and then we started working on uh you
know what we used to call unsupervised

2806
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:49,680
know what we used to call unsupervised
 

2807
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:53,390
know what we used to call unsupervised
learning uh and sort of revive the idea

2808
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:53,400
learning uh and sort of revive the idea
 

2809
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,910
learning uh and sort of revive the idea
of unsupervised learning uh in the early

2810
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:55,920
of unsupervised learning uh in the early
 

2811
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,150
of unsupervised learning uh in the early
2000s with yosha benju and Jeff Hinton

2812
00:56:59,150 --> 00:56:59,160
2000s with yosha benju and Jeff Hinton
 

2813
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,670
2000s with yosha benju and Jeff Hinton
then discovered that supervisor leing

2814
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:00,680
then discovered that supervisor leing
 

2815
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,390
then discovered that supervisor leing
actually works pretty well if you can

2816
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:02,400
actually works pretty well if you can
 

2817
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,190
actually works pretty well if you can
collect enough data and so the whole

2818
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:05,200
collect enough data and so the whole
 

2819
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,589
collect enough data and so the whole
idea of you know unsupervised supervisor

2820
00:57:07,589 --> 00:57:07,599
idea of you know unsupervised supervisor
 

2821
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:10,829
idea of you know unsupervised supervisor
kind I took a a backseat for for a bit

2822
00:57:10,829 --> 00:57:10,839
kind I took a a backseat for for a bit
 

2823
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:15,069
kind I took a a backseat for for a bit
and then I kind of tried to revive it um

2824
00:57:15,069 --> 00:57:15,079
and then I kind of tried to revive it um
 

2825
00:57:15,079 --> 00:57:17,870
and then I kind of tried to revive it um
uh in a big way you know starting in

2826
00:57:17,870 --> 00:57:17,880
uh in a big way you know starting in
 

2827
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:21,309
uh in a big way you know starting in
2014 basically when we started fair and

2828
00:57:21,309 --> 00:57:21,319
2014 basically when we started fair and
 

2829
00:57:21,319 --> 00:57:23,710
2014 basically when we started fair and
uh and really pushing for like finding

2830
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:23,720
uh and really pushing for like finding
 

2831
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:25,750
uh and really pushing for like finding
new new methods to do cell supervised

2832
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:25,760
new new methods to do cell supervised

many times we published lots of papers
 

2939
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:20,750
many times we published lots of papers
on it you know they kind of sort of work

2940
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:20,760
on it you know they kind of sort of work
 

2941
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,549
on it you know they kind of sort of work
but not really great they started

2942
00:59:23,549 --> 00:59:23,559
but not really great they started

working we we have been this idea of

2944
00:59:27,069 --> 00:59:27,079
working we we have been this idea of
 

2945
00:59:27,079 --> 00:59:28,750
working we we have been this idea of
predicting every pixel and basically

2946
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:28,760
predicting every pixel and basically
 

2947
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,470
predicting every pixel and basically
just doing the joint embedding and

2948
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:30,480
just doing the joint embedding and
 

2949
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,670
just doing the joint embedding and
predicting in representation space that

2950
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:32,680
predicting in representation space that
 

2951
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:36,549
predicting in representation space that
works MH so there's ample evidence that

2952
00:59:36,549 --> 00:59:36,559
works MH so there's ample evidence that
 

2953
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:38,990
works MH so there's ample evidence that
we're not going to be able to learn good

2954
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:39,000
we're not going to be able to learn good
 

2955
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,870
we're not going to be able to learn good
we representations of the real world

2956
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:41,880
we representations of the real world
 

2957
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,630
we representations of the real world
using generative model so I'm telling

2958
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:43,640
using generative model so I'm telling
 

2959
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,270
using generative model so I'm telling
people everybody is talking about

2960
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:45,280
people everybody is talking about
 

2961
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,190
people everybody is talking about
generative AI if you're really

2962
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:47,200
generative AI if you're really
 

2963
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,230
generative AI if you're really
interested in human level AI abandon the

2964
00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:49,240
interested in human level AI abandon the
 

2965
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,549
interested in human level AI abandon the
idea of generate

2966
00:59:50,549 --> 00:59:50,559
idea of generate
 

2967
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:53,430
idea of generate
AI okay but you you you really think

2968
00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:53,440
AI okay but you you you really think
 

2969
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,270
AI okay but you you you really think
it's possible to get far with the joint

2970
00:59:56,270 --> 00:59:56,280
it's possible to get far with the joint
 

2971
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:58,870
it's possible to get far with the joint
embedding representation so like there's

2972
00:59:58,870 --> 00:59:58,880
embedding representation so like there's
 

2973
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:03,230
embedding representation so like there's
Common Sense reasoning and then there's

2974
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:03,240
Common Sense reasoning and then there's
 

2975
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:06,470
Common Sense reasoning and then there's
highlevel reasoning like I I feel like

2976
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:06,480
highlevel reasoning like I I feel like
 

2977
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,470
highlevel reasoning like I I feel like
those are

2978
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:07,480
those are

01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:10,910
those are
two the kind of reasoning that LMS are

two the kind of reasoning that LMS are
 

2981
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:13,069
two the kind of reasoning that LMS are
able to do okay let me not use the word

2982
01:00:13,069 --> 01:00:13,079
able to do okay let me not use the word
 

2983
01:00:13,079 --> 01:00:14,870
able to do okay let me not use the word
reasoning but the kind of stuff that LMS

2984
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:14,880
reasoning but the kind of stuff that LMS
 

2985
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,950
reasoning but the kind of stuff that LMS
are able to do seems fundamentally

2986
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:16,960
are able to do seems fundamentally
 

2987
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,589

yeah it seems like we're going to need

2992
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:21,920
yeah it seems like we're going to need
 

2993
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,950
yeah it seems like we're going to need
both you're not would you be able to get

2994
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:24,960
both you're not would you be able to get
 

2995
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,230
both you're not would you be able to get
with the joint embedding would is the

01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:26,240
with the joint embedding would is the
 

2997
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:29,029
with the joint embedding would is the
JEA type of approach looking at video

2998
01:00:29,029 --> 01:00:29,039
JEA type of approach looking at video
 

2999
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:31,230
JEA type of approach looking at video
would you be able to

3000
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:31,240
would you be able to
 

3001
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:34,029
would you be able to
learn let's see well how to get from New

3002
01:00:34,029 --> 01:00:34,039
learn let's see well how to get from New
 

3003
01:00:34,039 --> 01:00:37,150
learn let's see well how to get from New
York to Paris or

3004
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:37,160
York to Paris or
 

3005
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:41,190
York to Paris or
um how to uh understate understand the

3006
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:41,200
um how to uh understate understand the
 

3007
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,829
um how to uh understate understand the
state of politics in the world today

3008
01:00:43,829 --> 01:00:43,839
state of politics in the world today
 

3009
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:45,230
state of politics in the world today
right these these are things where

3010
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:45,240
right these these are things where
 

3011
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,510
right these these are things where
various humans generate a lot of

3012
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:47,520
various humans generate a lot of
 

3013
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,589
various humans generate a lot of
language and opinions on in the space of

3014
01:00:49,589 --> 01:00:49,599
language and opinions on in the space of
 

3015
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:52,549
language and opinions on in the space of
language but don't visually represent

3016
01:00:52,549 --> 01:00:52,559
language but don't visually represent
 

3017
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:56,109
language but don't visually represent
that and you clearly uh compressible way

3018
01:00:56,109 --> 01:00:56,119
that and you clearly uh compressible way
 

3019
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:58,029
that and you clearly uh compressible way
right well there's a lot of situations

3020
01:00:58,029 --> 01:00:58,039
right well there's a lot of situations
 

3021
01:00:58,039 --> 01:01:00,950
right well there's a lot of situations
that you know might be difficult to for

3022
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:00,960
that you know might be difficult to for
 

3023
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,390
that you know might be difficult to for
a purely language based system to um to

3024
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:04,400
a purely language based system to um to
 

3025
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,190
a purely language based system to um to
know like okay you can probably learn

3026
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:07,200
know like okay you can probably learn
 

3027
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,390
know like okay you can probably learn
from Reading text the entirety of the

01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:09,400
from Reading text the entirety of the

3035
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,750
by snapping my fingers that's not going
to work right yes uh but there's you

3036
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:18,760
to work right yes uh but there's you
 

3037
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,910
to work right yes uh but there's you
know probably sort of more complex uh

3038
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:20,920
know probably sort of more complex uh
 

3039
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:24,630
know probably sort of more complex uh
scenarios of this type which an nlm May

3040
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:24,640
scenarios of this type which an nlm May
 

3041
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,710
scenarios of this type which an nlm May
never have encountered and may not be

3042
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:26,720
never have encountered and may not be
 

3043
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,390
never have encountered and may not be
able to determine whether it's possible

3044
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:28,400
able to determine whether it's possible
 

3045
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:33,029
able to determine whether it's possible
or not um so um so that that link you

3046
01:01:33,029 --> 01:01:33,039
or not um so um so that that link you
 

3047
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:34,630
or not um so um so that that link you
know from the the low level to the high

3048
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:34,640
know from the the low level to the high
 

3049
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,270
know from the the low level to the high
level the the thing is that the high

3050
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:36,280
level the the thing is that the high
 

3051
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:39,990
level the the thing is that the high
level that language expresses is based

3052
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:40,000
level that language expresses is based
 

3053
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,190
level that language expresses is based
on the common experience of the low

3054
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:42,200
on the common experience of the low
 

3055

you know we when we talk to each other

3058
01:01:47,549 --> 01:01:47,559
you know we when we talk to each other
 

3059
01:01:47,559 --> 01:01:49,710
you know we when we talk to each other
we know we have a common experience of

we know we have a common experience of
 

3061
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:51,990
we know we have a common experience of
the of the world like you know a lot of

3062
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:52,000
the of the world like you know a lot of
 

3063
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,109
the of the world like you know a lot of
it is is similar

3064
01:01:55,109 --> 01:01:55,119
it is is similar
 

3065
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:56,630
it is is similar
uh

3066
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:56,640
uh
 

3067
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:59,589
uh
and LMS don't have that but see there

3068
01:01:59,589 --> 01:01:59,599
and LMS don't have that but see there
 

3069
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:01,910
and LMS don't have that but see there
it's present you and I have a common

3070
01:02:01,910 --> 01:02:01,920
it's present you and I have a common
 

3071
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,269
it's present you and I have a common
experience of the world in terms of the

3072
01:02:03,269 --> 01:02:03,279
experience of the world in terms of the
 

3073
01:02:03,279 --> 01:02:06,109
experience of the world in terms of the
physics of how gravity works and stuff

3074
01:02:06,109 --> 01:02:06,119
physics of how gravity works and stuff
 

3075
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:08,029
physics of how gravity works and stuff
like this and

3076
01:02:08,029 --> 01:02:08,039
like this and
 

3077
01:02:08,039 --> 01:02:11,750
like this and
that common knowledge of the world I

3078
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:11,760
that common knowledge of the world I
 

3079
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,549
that common knowledge of the world I
feel like is there in the language we

3080
01:02:15,549 --> 01:02:15,559
feel like is there in the language we
 

3081
01:02:15,559 --> 01:02:17,990
feel like is there in the language we
don't explicitly express it but if you

3082
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:18,000
don't explicitly express it but if you
 

3083
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,670
don't explicitly express it but if you
have a huge amount of text you're going

3084
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:21,680
have a huge amount of text you're going
 

3085
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,470
have a huge amount of text you're going
to get this stuff that's between the

3086
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:23,480
to get this stuff that's between the
 

3087
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:25,589
to get this stuff that's between the
lines you're going to you're going in

3088
01:02:25,589 --> 01:02:25,599
lines you're going to you're going in
 

3089
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:28,670
lines you're going to you're going in
order to um form a consistent world mod

3090
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:28,680
order to um form a consistent world mod
 

3091
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,549
order to um form a consistent world mod
you're going to have to understand how

3092
01:02:30,549 --> 01:02:30,559
you're going to have to understand how
 

3093
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:32,589
you're going to have to understand how
gravity works even if you don't have an

3094
01:02:32,589 --> 01:02:32,599
gravity works even if you don't have an
 

3095
01:02:32,599 --> 01:02:36,069
gravity works even if you don't have an
explicit explanation of gravity so even

3096
01:02:36,069 --> 01:02:36,079
explicit explanation of gravity so even
 

3097
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:37,630
explicit explanation of gravity so even
though in the case of gravity there is

3098
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:37,640
though in the case of gravity there is
 

3099
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,150
though in the case of gravity there is
explicit explanations of gravity and

3100
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:39,160
explicit explanations of gravity and
 

3101
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:43,750
explicit explanations of gravity and
wiia but uh you're like the stuff that

3102
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:43,760
wiia but uh you're like the stuff that
 

3103
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,470
wiia but uh you're like the stuff that
we think of as common sense reasoning I

3104
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:46,480
we think of as common sense reasoning I
 

3105
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,190
we think of as common sense reasoning I
feel like to generate language correctly

3106
01:02:49,190 --> 01:02:49,200
feel like to generate language correctly
 

3107
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,750
feel like to generate language correctly
you're going to have to figure that out

3108
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:51,760
you're going to have to figure that out
 

3109
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,549
you're going to have to figure that out
now you could say as you have there's

3110
01:02:53,549 --> 01:02:53,559
now you could say as you have there's
 

3111
01:02:53,559 --> 01:02:57,190
now you could say as you have there's
not enough text okay so what you don't

3112
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:57,200
not enough text okay so what you don't
 

3113
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:58,870
not enough text okay so what you don't
think so no I agree with what you just

3114
01:02:58,870 --> 01:02:58,880
think so no I agree with what you just
 

3115
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,789
think so no I agree with what you just
said which is that to be able to do high

3116
01:03:00,789 --> 01:03:00,799
said which is that to be able to do high
 

3117
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:04,029
said which is that to be able to do high
LEL um uh common sense to have high

3118
01:03:04,029 --> 01:03:04,039
LEL um uh common sense to have high
 

3119
01:03:04,039 --> 01:03:05,870
LEL um uh common sense to have high
level common sense you need to have the

3120
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:05,880
level common sense you need to have the
 

3121
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,470
level common sense you need to have the
low level common sense to build on top

3122
01:03:07,470 --> 01:03:07,480
low level common sense to build on top
 

3123
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:10,309
low level common sense to build on top
of yeah um but that's not there and

3124
01:03:10,309 --> 01:03:10,319
of yeah um but that's not there and
 

3125
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,349
of yeah um but that's not there and
that's not there in llms llms are purely

3126
01:03:12,349 --> 01:03:12,359
that's not there in llms llms are purely
 

3127
01:03:12,359 --> 01:03:14,029
that's not there in llms llms are purely
trained from Tex so so then the other

3128
01:03:14,029 --> 01:03:14,039
trained from Tex so so then the other
 

3129
01:03:14,039 --> 01:03:16,109
trained from Tex so so then the other
statement you made um I would not I

3130
01:03:16,109 --> 01:03:16,119
statement you made um I would not I
 

3131
01:03:16,119 --> 01:03:18,349
statement you made um I would not I
would not agree with the fact that

3132
01:03:18,349 --> 01:03:18,359
would not agree with the fact that
 

3133
01:03:18,359 --> 01:03:20,430
would not agree with the fact that
implicit in all languages in the world

3134
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:20,440
implicit in all languages in the world
 

3135
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:23,230
implicit in all languages in the world
is the underlying reality there's a lot

3136
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:23,240
is the underlying reality there's a lot
 

3137
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:25,190
is the underlying reality there's a lot
about underlying reality which is not

3138
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:25,200
about underlying reality which is not
 

3139
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,589
about underlying reality which is not
expressed in language is that obvious to

3140
01:03:27,589 --> 01:03:27,599
expressed in language is that obvious to
 

3141
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:29,269
expressed in language is that obvious to
you yeah

3142
01:03:29,269 --> 01:03:29,279
you yeah
 

3143
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:31,309
you yeah
totally so like

3144
01:03:31,309 --> 01:03:31,319
totally so like
 

3145
01:03:31,319 --> 01:03:34,430
totally so like
all all the conversations we have what

3146
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:34,440
all all the conversations we have what
 

3147
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,990
all all the conversations we have what
okay there's the Dark web meaning uh

3148
01:03:36,990 --> 01:03:37,000
okay there's the Dark web meaning uh
 

3149
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,069
okay there's the Dark web meaning uh
whatever the private conversations like

3150
01:03:39,069 --> 01:03:39,079
whatever the private conversations like
 

3151
01:03:39,079 --> 01:03:41,829
whatever the private conversations like
DMS and stuff like this which is much

3152
01:03:41,829 --> 01:03:41,839
DMS and stuff like this which is much
 

3153
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:44,150
DMS and stuff like this which is much
much larger probably than what's

3154
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:44,160
much larger probably than what's
 

3155
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,870
much larger probably than what's
available what what llms are trained on

3156
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:46,880
available what what llms are trained on
 

3157
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,309
available what what llms are trained on
you don't need to communicate the stuff

3158
01:03:48,309 --> 01:03:48,319
you don't need to communicate the stuff
 

3159
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:51,269
you don't need to communicate the stuff
that is coming but the humor all of it

3160
01:03:51,269 --> 01:03:51,279
that is coming but the humor all of it
 

3161
01:03:51,279 --> 01:03:53,069
that is coming but the humor all of it
no you do like when you you don't need

3162
01:03:53,069 --> 01:03:53,079
no you do like when you you don't need
 

3163
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:55,470
no you do like when you you don't need
to but it comes through through like you

3164
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:55,480
to but it comes through through like you
 

3165
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:57,589
to but it comes through through like you
like if I accidentally uh knock this

3166
01:03:57,589 --> 01:03:57,599
like if I accidentally uh knock this
 

3167
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:59,750
like if I accidentally uh knock this
over you'll probably make fun of me and

3168
01:03:59,750 --> 01:03:59,760
over you'll probably make fun of me and
 

3169
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,910
over you'll probably make fun of me and
in the content of the you making fun of

3170
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:01,920
in the content of the you making fun of
 

3171
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:05,349
in the content of the you making fun of
me will be a explanation of the fact

3172
01:04:05,349 --> 01:04:05,359
me will be a explanation of the fact
 

3173
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:08,549
me will be a explanation of the fact
that cups fall and then you know gravity

3174
01:04:08,549 --> 01:04:08,559
that cups fall and then you know gravity
 

3175
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:10,670
that cups fall and then you know gravity
Works in this way and then you you'll

3176
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:10,680
Works in this way and then you you'll
 

3177
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,589
Works in this way and then you you'll
have some very vague information about

3178
01:04:13,589 --> 01:04:13,599
have some very vague information about
 

3179
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:15,549
have some very vague information about
what kind of things explode when they

3180
01:04:15,549 --> 01:04:15,559
what kind of things explode when they
 

3181
01:04:15,559 --> 01:04:17,349
what kind of things explode when they
hit the ground and then maybe you'll

3182
01:04:17,349 --> 01:04:17,359
hit the ground and then maybe you'll
 

3183
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:19,349
hit the ground and then maybe you'll
make a joke about entropy or something

3184
01:04:19,349 --> 01:04:19,359
make a joke about entropy or something
 

3185
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:20,510
make a joke about entropy or something
like this and you will'll never be able

3186
01:04:20,510 --> 01:04:20,520
like this and you will'll never be able
 

3187
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:22,789
like this and you will'll never be able
to reconstruct this again like okay you

3188
01:04:22,789 --> 01:04:22,799
to reconstruct this again like okay you
 

3189
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:25,069
to reconstruct this again like okay you
make a a little joke like this and

3190
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:25,079
make a a little joke like this and
 

3191
01:04:25,079 --> 01:04:27,309
make a a little joke like this and
there'll be trillion of other jokes and

3192
01:04:27,309 --> 01:04:27,319
there'll be trillion of other jokes and
 

3193
01:04:27,319 --> 01:04:29,069
there'll be trillion of other jokes and
from the jokes you can piece together

3194
01:04:29,069 --> 01:04:29,079
from the jokes you can piece together
 

3195
01:04:29,079 --> 01:04:31,470
from the jokes you can piece together
the fact that gravity works and mugs can

3196
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:31,480
the fact that gravity works and mugs can
 

3197
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:32,829
the fact that gravity works and mugs can
break and all this kind of stuff you

3198
01:04:32,829 --> 01:04:32,839
break and all this kind of stuff you
 

3199
01:04:32,839 --> 01:04:33,870
break and all this kind of stuff you
don't need to

3200
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:33,880
don't need to
 

3201
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:36,950
don't need to
see uh it'll be very inefficient it's

3202
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:36,960
see uh it'll be very inefficient it's
 

3203
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:41,029
see uh it'll be very inefficient it's
easier for like to not knock the thing

3204
01:04:41,029 --> 01:04:41,039
easier for like to not knock the thing
 

3205
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:44,109
easier for like to not knock the thing
over yeah but uh I feel like it would be

3206
01:04:44,109 --> 01:04:44,119
over yeah but uh I feel like it would be
 

3207
01:04:44,119 --> 01:04:46,870
over yeah but uh I feel like it would be
there if you have enough of that data I

3208
01:04:46,870 --> 01:04:46,880
there if you have enough of that data I
 

3209
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:50,029
there if you have enough of that data I
just think that most of the information

3210
01:04:50,029 --> 01:04:50,039
just think that most of the information
 

3211
01:04:50,039 --> 01:04:52,910
just think that most of the information
of this type that we have accumulated

3212
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:52,920
of this type that we have accumulated
 

3213
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:55,029
of this type that we have accumulated
when when we were babies is just not

3214
01:04:55,029 --> 01:04:55,039
when when we were babies is just not
 

3215
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:58,470
when when we were babies is just not
present in uh in in text any in any

01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:00,480
description essentially and the sensory
 

3219
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,269

getting that kind of understanding I

3222
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:04,440
getting that kind of understanding I
 

3223
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:07,309
getting that kind of understanding I
mean that's the 16,000 hours of of wake

3224
01:05:07,309 --> 01:05:07,319
mean that's the 16,000 hours of of wake
 

3225
01:05:07,319 --> 01:05:10,549
mean that's the 16,000 hours of of wake
time of a four-year-old and uh 10 to the

3226
01:05:10,549 --> 01:05:10,559
time of a four-year-old and uh 10 to the
 

3227
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:12,430

15 bytes you know going through vision

3228
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:12,440
15 bytes you know going through vision
 

3229
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:14,670
15 bytes you know going through vision
just Vision right there is a

3230
01:05:14,670 --> 01:05:14,680
just Vision right there is a
 

3231
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:17,630
just Vision right there is a
similar uh bandwidth you know of touch

3232
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:17,640
similar uh bandwidth you know of touch
 

3233
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:20,549
similar uh bandwidth you know of touch
and uh a little less through audio and

then text doesn't language doesn't come

3236
01:05:22,190 --> 01:05:22,200
then text doesn't language doesn't come
 

3237
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:26,069
then text doesn't language doesn't come
in until like you know year uh in in

3238
01:05:26,069 --> 01:05:26,079
in until like you know year uh in in
 

3239
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:28,510
in until like you know year uh in in
life and by the time you are 9 years old

3240
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:28,520
life and by the time you are 9 years old
 

3241
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:31,069
life and by the time you are 9 years old
you've learned about gravity you know

3242
01:05:31,069 --> 01:05:31,079
you've learned about gravity you know
 

3243
01:05:31,079 --> 01:05:32,710
you've learned about gravity you know
about inertia you know about gravity you

3244
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:32,720
about inertia you know about gravity you
 

3245
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,269
about inertia you know about gravity you
know the stability you know you know

3246
01:05:35,269 --> 01:05:35,279
know the stability you know you know
 

3247
01:05:35,279 --> 01:05:36,910
know the stability you know you know
about the distinction between animate

3248
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:36,920
about the distinction between animate
 

3249
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:39,309
about the distinction between animate
and inanimate objects you know by 18

3250
01:05:39,309 --> 01:05:39,319
and inanimate objects you know by 18
 

3251
01:05:39,319 --> 01:05:42,269
and inanimate objects you know by 18
months you know about like uh why people

3252
01:05:42,269 --> 01:05:42,279
months you know about like uh why people
 

3253
01:05:42,279 --> 01:05:44,510
months you know about like uh why people
want to do things and you help them if

3254
01:05:44,510 --> 01:05:44,520
want to do things and you help them if
 

3255
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,910
want to do things and you help them if
they can't you know I mean there's a lot

3256
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:46,920
they can't you know I mean there's a lot
 

3257
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,630
they can't you know I mean there's a lot
of things that you learn mostly by

3258
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:48,640
of things that you learn mostly by
 

3259
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:51,710
of things that you learn mostly by
observation really uh not even through

3260
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:51,720
observation really uh not even through
 

3261
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:53,109
observation really uh not even through
interaction in the first few months of

3263
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:54,990

life babies don't don't really have any

3264
01:05:54,990 --> 01:05:55,000
life babies don't don't really have any
 

3265
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,349
life babies don't don't really have any
influence on the world they can only

influence on the world they can only
 

3267
01:05:56,359 --> 01:05:59,150
influence on the world they can only
observe right and you accumulate like a

3268
01:05:59,150 --> 01:05:59,160
observe right and you accumulate like a
 

3269
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:02,349
observe right and you accumulate like a
gigantic amount of uh of knowledge just

3270
01:06:02,349 --> 01:06:02,359
gigantic amount of uh of knowledge just
 

3271
01:06:02,359 --> 01:06:03,670
gigantic amount of uh of knowledge just
just from that so that that's what we're

3272
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:03,680
just from that so that that's what we're
 

3273
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:06,430
just from that so that that's what we're
missing from uh current AI

3274
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:06,440
missing from uh current AI
 

3275
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,589
missing from uh current AI
systems I think in one of your slides

3276
01:06:08,589 --> 01:06:08,599
systems I think in one of your slides
 

3277
01:06:08,599 --> 01:06:11,309
systems I think in one of your slides
you have this nice plot that is one of

3278
01:06:11,309 --> 01:06:11,319
you have this nice plot that is one of
 

3279
01:06:11,319 --> 01:06:13,870
you have this nice plot that is one of
the ways you show that llms are limited

3280
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:13,880
the ways you show that llms are limited
 

3281
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:15,269
the ways you show that llms are limited
I wonder if you could talk about

3282
01:06:15,269 --> 01:06:15,279
I wonder if you could talk about
 

3283
01:06:15,279 --> 01:06:17,309
I wonder if you could talk about
hallucinations from your

3284
01:06:17,309 --> 01:06:17,319
hallucinations from your
 

3285
01:06:17,319 --> 01:06:20,630
hallucinations from your
perspectives the why hallucinations

3286
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:20,640
perspectives the why hallucinations
 

3287
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:23,670
perspectives the why hallucinations
happen from large language models and

3288
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:23,680
happen from large language models and
 

3289
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:24,589
happen from large language models and
why

3290
01:06:24,589 --> 01:06:24,599
why
 

3291
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:26,430
why
and to what degree is that a fundamental

3292
01:06:26,430 --> 01:06:26,440
and to what degree is that a fundamental
 

3293
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:30,309
and to what degree is that a fundamental
flaw of large language models right so

3294
01:06:30,309 --> 01:06:30,319
flaw of large language models right so
 

3295
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:33,109
flaw of large language models right so
because of the auto regressive

3296
01:06:33,109 --> 01:06:33,119
because of the auto regressive
 

3297
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:36,029
because of the auto regressive
prediction every time an LM produces a

01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:39,480
token or word uh there is some level of
 

3301
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:41,230
token or word uh there is some level of
probability for that word to take you

3302
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:41,240
probability for that word to take you
 

3303
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:44,390
probability for that word to take you
out of the set of reasonable

3304
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:44,400
out of the set of reasonable
 

3305
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,910
out of the set of reasonable
answers uh and if you assume which is a

3306
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:46,920
answers uh and if you assume which is a
 

3307
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,950
answers uh and if you assume which is a
very strong assumption that the

3308
01:06:48,950 --> 01:06:48,960
very strong assumption that the
 

3309
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,910
very strong assumption that the
probability of such

3310
01:06:50,910 --> 01:06:50,920
probability of such
 

3311
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:54,549
probability of such
error um is that those errors are

3312
01:06:54,549 --> 01:06:54,559
error um is that those errors are
 

3313
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:57,829
error um is that those errors are
independent across a a sequence of

3314
01:06:57,829 --> 01:06:57,839
independent across a a sequence of
 

3315
01:06:57,839 --> 01:06:59,990
independent across a a sequence of
tokens being produced M what that means

3316
01:06:59,990 --> 01:07:00,000
tokens being produced M what that means
 

3317
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,349
tokens being produced M what that means
is that every time you produce a token

3318
01:07:02,349 --> 01:07:02,359
is that every time you produce a token
 

3319
01:07:02,359 --> 01:07:04,109
is that every time you produce a token
the probability that you rest you you

3320
01:07:04,109 --> 01:07:04,119
the probability that you rest you you
 

3321
01:07:04,119 --> 01:07:05,910
the probability that you rest you you
stay within the the set of correct

3322
01:07:05,910 --> 01:07:05,920
stay within the the set of correct
 

3323
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,589
stay within the the set of correct
answer decreases and it decreases

3324
01:07:07,589 --> 01:07:07,599
answer decreases and it decreases
 

3325
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:09,470
answer decreases and it decreases
exponentially so there's a strong like

3326
01:07:09,470 --> 01:07:09,480
exponentially so there's a strong like
 

3327
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:12,710
exponentially so there's a strong like
you said assumption there that if uh

3328
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:12,720
you said assumption there that if uh
 

3329
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,230
you said assumption there that if uh
there's a non-zero probability of making

3330
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:14,240
there's a non-zero probability of making
 

3331
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,549
there's a non-zero probability of making
a mistake which there appears to be then

3332
01:07:16,549 --> 01:07:16,559
a mistake which there appears to be then
 

3333
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:19,750
a mistake which there appears to be then
there's going to be a kind of drift yeah

3334
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:19,760
there's going to be a kind of drift yeah
 

3335
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,710
there's going to be a kind of drift yeah
and that drift is exponential it's like

3336
01:07:21,710 --> 01:07:21,720
and that drift is exponential it's like
 

3337
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:24,510
and that drift is exponential it's like
errors accumulate right so so the

3338
01:07:24,510 --> 01:07:24,520
errors accumulate right so so the
 

3339
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:26,990
errors accumulate right so so the
probability that an answer would be

3340
01:07:26,990 --> 01:07:27,000
probability that an answer would be
 

3341
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,870
probability that an answer would be
nonsensical increases exponentially with

3342
01:07:29,870 --> 01:07:29,880
nonsensical increases exponentially with
 

3343
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:32,069
nonsensical increases exponentially with
the number of tokens is that obvious to

3344
01:07:32,069 --> 01:07:32,079
the number of tokens is that obvious to
 

3345
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:35,390
the number of tokens is that obvious to
you by the way like well so

3346
01:07:35,390 --> 01:07:35,400
you by the way like well so
 

3347
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,269
you by the way like well so
mathematically speaking maybe but like

3348
01:07:37,269 --> 01:07:37,279
mathematically speaking maybe but like
 

3349
01:07:37,279 --> 01:07:40,190
mathematically speaking maybe but like
isn't there a kind of gravitational pull

3350
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:40,200
isn't there a kind of gravitational pull
 

3351
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:43,349
isn't there a kind of gravitational pull
towards the truth because on on average

3352
01:07:43,349 --> 01:07:43,359
towards the truth because on on average
 

3353
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:46,950
towards the truth because on on average
hopefully the truth is well represented

3354
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:46,960
hopefully the truth is well represented
 

3355
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:50,230
hopefully the truth is well represented
in the uh training set no it's basically

3356
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:50,240
in the uh training set no it's basically
 

3357
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:54,589
in the uh training set no it's basically
a struggle against uh the curse of

3358
01:07:54,589 --> 01:07:54,599
a struggle against uh the curse of
 

3359
01:07:54,599 --> 01:07:56,190
a struggle against uh the curse of
dimensionality so the way you can

3360
01:07:56,190 --> 01:07:56,200
dimensionality so the way you can
 

3361
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,990
dimensionality so the way you can
correct for this is that you fine-tune

3362
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:58,000
correct for this is that you fine-tune
 

3363
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:58,710
correct for this is that you fine-tune
the

3364
01:07:58,710 --> 01:07:58,720
the
 

3365
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,630
the
system by having it produce answers for

3366
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:01,640
system by having it produce answers for
 

3367
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:03,269
system by having it produce answers for
all kinds of questions that people might

3368
01:08:03,269 --> 01:08:03,279
all kinds of questions that people might
 

3369
01:08:03,279 --> 01:08:07,029
all kinds of questions that people might
come up with M and people are people so

3370
01:08:07,029 --> 01:08:07,039
come up with M and people are people so
 

3371
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,349
come up with M and people are people so
they a lot of the questions that they

3372
01:08:08,349 --> 01:08:08,359
they a lot of the questions that they
 

3373
01:08:08,359 --> 01:08:10,349
they a lot of the questions that they
have are very similar to each other so

3374
01:08:10,349 --> 01:08:10,359
have are very similar to each other so
 

3375
01:08:10,359 --> 01:08:12,710
have are very similar to each other so
you can probably cover you know 80% or

3376
01:08:12,710 --> 01:08:12,720
you can probably cover you know 80% or
 

3377
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:15,430
you can probably cover you know 80% or
whatever of questions that people will

3378
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:15,440
whatever of questions that people will
 

3379
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:20,030
whatever of questions that people will
will ask um by you know collecting data

3380
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:20,040
will ask um by you know collecting data
 

3381
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:22,829
will ask um by you know collecting data
and then um and then you fine tune the

3382
01:08:22,829 --> 01:08:22,839
and then um and then you fine tune the
 

3383
01:08:22,839 --> 01:08:24,829
and then um and then you fine tune the
system to produce good answers for all

3384
01:08:24,829 --> 01:08:24,839
system to produce good answers for all
 

3385
01:08:24,839 --> 01:08:27,110
system to produce good answers for all
of those things and it's probably going

3386
01:08:27,110 --> 01:08:27,120
of those things and it's probably going
 

3387
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,630
of those things and it's probably going
to be able to learn that because it's

3388
01:08:28,630 --> 01:08:28,640
to be able to learn that because it's
 

3389
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,990
to be able to learn that because it's
got a lot of capacity to to learn um but

3390
01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:32,000
got a lot of capacity to to learn um but
 

3391
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,309
got a lot of capacity to to learn um but
then there is you know the enormous set

3392
01:08:36,309 --> 01:08:36,319
then there is you know the enormous set
 

3393
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:38,510
then there is you know the enormous set
of prompts that you have not covered

3394
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:38,520
of prompts that you have not covered
 

3395
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,990
of prompts that you have not covered
during training and that set is enormous

3396
01:08:40,990 --> 01:08:41,000
during training and that set is enormous
 

3397
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,590
during training and that set is enormous
like within the set of all possible

3398
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:42,600
like within the set of all possible
 

3399
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,550
like within the set of all possible
prompts the proportion of prompts that

3400
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:44,560
prompts the proportion of prompts that
 

3401
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:45,269
prompts the proportion of prompts that
have

3402
01:08:45,269 --> 01:08:45,279
have
 

3403
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:48,829
have
been uh used for training is absolutely

3404
01:08:48,829 --> 01:08:48,839
been uh used for training is absolutely
 

3405
01:08:48,839 --> 01:08:51,510
been uh used for training is absolutely
tiny um it's a it's a tiny tiny tiny

3406
01:08:51,510 --> 01:08:51,520
tiny um it's a it's a tiny tiny tiny
 

3407
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:54,189
tiny um it's a it's a tiny tiny tiny
subset of all possible prompts and so

3408
01:08:54,189 --> 01:08:54,199
subset of all possible prompts and so
 

3409
01:08:54,199 --> 01:08:56,269
subset of all possible prompts and so
the system will behave properly on the

3410
01:08:56,269 --> 01:08:56,279
the system will behave properly on the
 

3411
01:08:56,279 --> 01:08:57,910
the system will behave properly on the
prompts that it's been either trained

3412
01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:57,920
prompts that it's been either trained
 

3413
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,669
prompts that it's been either trained
pre-trained or

3414
01:08:59,669 --> 01:08:59,679
pre-trained or
 

3415
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:02,510
pre-trained or
fine-tuned um but then there is an

3416
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:02,520
fine-tuned um but then there is an
 

3417
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:05,709
fine-tuned um but then there is an
entire space of things that it cannot

3418
01:09:05,709 --> 01:09:05,719
entire space of things that it cannot
 

3419
01:09:05,719 --> 01:09:07,030
entire space of things that it cannot
possibly have been trained on because

3420
01:09:07,030 --> 01:09:07,040
possibly have been trained on because
 

3421
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:10,229
possibly have been trained on because
it's just the the number is gigantic so

3422
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:10,239
it's just the the number is gigantic so
 

3423
01:09:10,239 --> 01:09:13,229
it's just the the number is gigantic so
um so whatever training the

3424
01:09:13,229 --> 01:09:13,239
um so whatever training the
 

3425
01:09:13,239 --> 01:09:16,910
um so whatever training the
system uh has been subject to to produce

3426
01:09:16,910 --> 01:09:16,920
system uh has been subject to to produce
 

3427
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:19,349
system uh has been subject to to produce
appropriate tensors you can break it by

3428
01:09:19,349 --> 01:09:19,359
appropriate tensors you can break it by
 

3429
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:21,430
appropriate tensors you can break it by
finding out a prompt that will be

3430
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:21,440
finding out a prompt that will be
 

3431
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:24,550
finding out a prompt that will be
outside of the the the set of promps has

3432
01:09:24,550 --> 01:09:24,560
outside of the the the set of promps has
 

3433
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,269
outside of the the the set of promps has
been trained on or things that are

3434
01:09:26,269 --> 01:09:26,279
been trained on or things that are
 

3435
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:29,189
been trained on or things that are
similar and then it will just P complete

3436
01:09:29,189 --> 01:09:29,199
similar and then it will just P complete
 

3437
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:31,390
similar and then it will just P complete
nonsense do you when you say prompt do

3438
01:09:31,390 --> 01:09:31,400
nonsense do you when you say prompt do
 

3439
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,709
nonsense do you when you say prompt do
you mean that exact prompt or do you

3440
01:09:33,709 --> 01:09:33,719
you mean that exact prompt or do you
 

3441
01:09:33,719 --> 01:09:37,149
you mean that exact prompt or do you
mean a prompt that's like in many parts

3442
01:09:37,149 --> 01:09:37,159
mean a prompt that's like in many parts
 

3443
01:09:37,159 --> 01:09:40,910
mean a prompt that's like in many parts
very different than like is that easy to

3444
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:40,920
very different than like is that easy to
 

3445
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,590
very different than like is that easy to
ask a question or to say a thing that

3446
01:09:43,590 --> 01:09:43,600
ask a question or to say a thing that
 

3447
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,269
ask a question or to say a thing that
hasn't been said before on the internet

3448
01:09:46,269 --> 01:09:46,279
hasn't been said before on the internet
 

3449
01:09:46,279 --> 01:09:47,990
hasn't been said before on the internet
I mean people have come up with uh

3450
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:48,000
I mean people have come up with uh
 

3451
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,709
I mean people have come up with uh
things where like you you put a

3452
01:09:50,709 --> 01:09:50,719
things where like you you put a
 

3453
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,349
things where like you you put a
essentially a random sequence of

3454
01:09:52,349 --> 01:09:52,359
essentially a random sequence of
 

3455
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:54,070
essentially a random sequence of
characters in The Prompt and that's

3456
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:54,080
characters in The Prompt and that's
 

3457
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,990
characters in The Prompt and that's
enough to kind of throw the system uh

3458
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:57,000
enough to kind of throw the system uh
 

3459
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,910
enough to kind of throw the system uh
into a mode where you know it it's going

3460
01:09:58,910 --> 01:09:58,920
into a mode where you know it it's going
 

3461
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:00,350
into a mode where you know it it's going
to answer something completely different

3462
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:00,360
to answer something completely different
 

3463
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:03,270
to answer something completely different
than it would have answered without this

3464
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:03,280
than it would have answered without this
 

3465
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,910
than it would have answered without this
so that's a way to jailbreak the system

3466
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:04,920
so that's a way to jailbreak the system
 

3467
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:06,830
so that's a way to jailbreak the system
basically get it you know go outside of

3468
01:10:06,830 --> 01:10:06,840
basically get it you know go outside of
 

3469
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:09,510
basically get it you know go outside of
its uh of its conditioning right so that

3470
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:09,520
its uh of its conditioning right so that
 

3471
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,229
its uh of its conditioning right so that
that's a very clear demonstration of it

3472
01:10:11,229 --> 01:10:11,239
that's a very clear demonstration of it
 

3473
01:10:11,239 --> 01:10:12,910
that's a very clear demonstration of it
but of

3474
01:10:12,910 --> 01:10:12,920
but of
 

3475
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:16,350
but of
course uh you know that's uh that goes

3476
01:10:16,350 --> 01:10:16,360
course uh you know that's uh that goes
 

3477
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:19,149
course uh you know that's uh that goes
outside of what is designed to do right

3478
01:10:19,149 --> 01:10:19,159
outside of what is designed to do right
 

3479
01:10:19,159 --> 01:10:20,790
outside of what is designed to do right
if you actually stitch together

3480
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:20,800
if you actually stitch together
 

3481
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,350
if you actually stitch together
reasonably grammatical sentences is that

3482
01:10:23,350 --> 01:10:23,360
reasonably grammatical sentences is that
 

3483
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:26,790
reasonably grammatical sentences is that
the is it that easy to break it yeah

3484
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:26,800
the is it that easy to break it yeah
 

3485
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,310
the is it that easy to break it yeah
some people have done things like you

3486
01:10:29,310 --> 01:10:29,320
some people have done things like you
 

3487
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:30,990
some people have done things like you
you you write a sentence in English

3488
01:10:30,990 --> 01:10:31,000
you you write a sentence in English
 

3489
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,189
you you write a sentence in English
right that has and or you ask a question

3490
01:10:33,189 --> 01:10:33,199
right that has and or you ask a question
 

3491
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:35,070
right that has and or you ask a question
in English and it it produces a

3492
01:10:35,070 --> 01:10:35,080
in English and it it produces a
 

3493
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,229
in English and it it produces a
perfectly fine answer and then you just

3494
01:10:37,229 --> 01:10:37,239
perfectly fine answer and then you just
 

3495
01:10:37,239 --> 01:10:38,790
perfectly fine answer and then you just
substitute a few

3496
01:10:38,790 --> 01:10:38,800
substitute a few
 

3497
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:41,590
substitute a few
words by the same word in another

3498
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:41,600
words by the same word in another
 

3499
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,390
words by the same word in another
language and all of a sudden the answer

3500
01:10:43,390 --> 01:10:43,400
language and all of a sudden the answer
 

3501
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,110
language and all of a sudden the answer
is complete nonsense yeah so so I guess

3502
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:45,120
is complete nonsense yeah so so I guess
 

3503
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:48,630
is complete nonsense yeah so so I guess
what I'm saying is like which fraction

3504
01:10:48,630 --> 01:10:48,640
what I'm saying is like which fraction
 

3505
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:51,470
what I'm saying is like which fraction
of prompts that humans are likely to

3506
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:51,480
of prompts that humans are likely to
 

3507
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:54,350
of prompts that humans are likely to
generate are going to break the system

3508
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:54,360
generate are going to break the system
 

3509
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:56,390
generate are going to break the system
so the the problem is that there is a

3510
01:10:56,390 --> 01:10:56,400
so the the problem is that there is a
 

3511
01:10:56,400 --> 01:11:00,350
so the the problem is that there is a
long tail yes uh this is a an issue that

3512
01:11:00,350 --> 01:11:00,360
long tail yes uh this is a an issue that
 

3513
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:02,750
long tail yes uh this is a an issue that
a lot of people have realize you know in

3514
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:02,760
a lot of people have realize you know in
 

3515
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:04,070
a lot of people have realize you know in
social networks and stuff like that

3516
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:04,080
social networks and stuff like that
 

3517
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,790
social networks and stuff like that
which is uh there's a very very long

3518
01:11:05,790 --> 01:11:05,800
which is uh there's a very very long
 

3519
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:08,189
which is uh there's a very very long
taale of of things that people will ask

3520
01:11:08,189 --> 01:11:08,199
taale of of things that people will ask
 

3521
01:11:08,199 --> 01:11:10,950
taale of of things that people will ask
and you can find tune the system for the

3522
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:10,960
and you can find tune the system for the
 

3523
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:14,229
and you can find tune the system for the
80% or whatever of uh of the things that

3524
01:11:14,229 --> 01:11:14,239
80% or whatever of uh of the things that
 

3525
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:16,430
80% or whatever of uh of the things that
most people will will ask and then this

3526
01:11:16,430 --> 01:11:16,440
most people will will ask and then this
 

3527
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:19,070
most people will will ask and then this
long tail is is so large that you're not

3528
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:19,080
long tail is is so large that you're not
 

3529
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:20,790
long tail is is so large that you're not
going to be able to fun the system for

3530
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:20,800
going to be able to fun the system for
 

3531
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,870
going to be able to fun the system for
all the conditions and in the end the

3532
01:11:22,870 --> 01:11:22,880
all the conditions and in the end the
 

3533
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,350
all the conditions and in the end the
system has a being kind of a giant

3534
01:11:24,350 --> 01:11:24,360
system has a being kind of a giant
 

3535
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:26,910
system has a being kind of a giant
lookup table right essentially which is

3536
01:11:26,910 --> 01:11:26,920
lookup table right essentially which is
 

3537
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:27,950
lookup table right essentially which is
not really what you want you want

3538
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:27,960
not really what you want you want
 

3539
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:30,030
not really what you want you want
systems that can reason certainly they

3540
01:11:30,030 --> 01:11:30,040
systems that can reason certainly they
 

3541
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:32,229
systems that can reason certainly they
can plan so the type of reasoning that

3542
01:11:32,229 --> 01:11:32,239
can plan so the type of reasoning that
 

3543
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:34,390
can plan so the type of reasoning that
takes place in llm is very very

3544
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:34,400
takes place in llm is very very
 

3545
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,510
takes place in llm is very very
primitive and the reason you can tell is

3546
01:11:36,510 --> 01:11:36,520
primitive and the reason you can tell is
 

3547
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:38,750
primitive and the reason you can tell is
primitive is because the amount of

3548
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:38,760
primitive is because the amount of
 

3549
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:41,510
primitive is because the amount of
computation that is spent per token

3550
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:41,520
computation that is spent per token
 

3551
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,189
computation that is spent per token
produced is constant so if you ask a

3552
01:11:45,189 --> 01:11:45,199
produced is constant so if you ask a
 

3553
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:47,870
produced is constant so if you ask a
question and that question has an answer

3554
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:47,880
question and that question has an answer
 

3555
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:50,590
question and that question has an answer
in a given number of token the amount of

3556
01:11:50,590 --> 01:11:50,600
in a given number of token the amount of
 

3557
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,189
in a given number of token the amount of
competition devoted to Computing that

3558
01:11:52,189 --> 01:11:52,199
competition devoted to Computing that
 

3559
01:11:52,199 --> 01:11:54,149
competition devoted to Computing that
answer can be exactly

3560
01:11:54,149 --> 01:11:54,159
answer can be exactly
 

3561
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:57,110
answer can be exactly
estimated it's like you know it's it's

3562
01:11:57,110 --> 01:11:57,120
estimated it's like you know it's it's
 

3563
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,709
estimated it's like you know it's it's
the the size of the prediction Network

3564
01:11:59,709 --> 01:11:59,719
the the size of the prediction Network
 

3565
01:11:59,719 --> 01:12:02,070
the the size of the prediction Network
you know with its 36 layers on 92 layers

3566
01:12:02,070 --> 01:12:02,080
you know with its 36 layers on 92 layers
 

3567
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:04,629
you know with its 36 layers on 92 layers
or whatever it is uh multiply by number

3568
01:12:04,629 --> 01:12:04,639
or whatever it is uh multiply by number
 

3569
01:12:04,639 --> 01:12:08,229
or whatever it is uh multiply by number
of tokens that's it and so essentially

3570
01:12:08,229 --> 01:12:08,239
of tokens that's it and so essentially
 

3571
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:10,430
of tokens that's it and so essentially
it doesn't matter if the question being

3572
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:10,440
it doesn't matter if the question being
 

3573
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:15,310
it doesn't matter if the question being
asked is is simple to answer complicated

3574
01:12:15,310 --> 01:12:15,320
asked is is simple to answer complicated
 

3575
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,950
asked is is simple to answer complicated
to answer impossible to answer because

3576
01:12:17,950 --> 01:12:17,960
to answer impossible to answer because
 

3577
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:21,189
to answer impossible to answer because
it's undecidable or something um the

3578
01:12:21,189 --> 01:12:21,199
it's undecidable or something um the
 

3579
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:22,750
it's undecidable or something um the
amount of computation the system will be

3580
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:22,760
amount of computation the system will be
 

3581
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:24,629
amount of computation the system will be
able to devote to to the answer is

3582
01:12:24,629 --> 01:12:24,639
able to devote to to the answer is
 

3583
01:12:24,639 --> 01:12:27,030
able to devote to to the answer is
constant or is proportional to number of

3584
01:12:27,030 --> 01:12:27,040
constant or is proportional to number of
 

3585
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,629
constant or is proportional to number of
token produced in the answer right this

3586
01:12:29,629 --> 01:12:29,639
token produced in the answer right this
 

3587
01:12:29,639 --> 01:12:32,830
token produced in the answer right this
is not the way we work the way we reason

3588
01:12:32,830 --> 01:12:32,840
is not the way we work the way we reason
 

3589
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:36,390
is not the way we work the way we reason
is that when we're faced with a complex

3590
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:36,400
is that when we're faced with a complex
 

3591
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,830
is that when we're faced with a complex
problem or a complex question we spend

3592
01:12:38,830 --> 01:12:38,840
problem or a complex question we spend
 

3593
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:41,229
problem or a complex question we spend
more time trying to solve it and answer

3594
01:12:41,229 --> 01:12:41,239
more time trying to solve it and answer
 

3595
01:12:41,239 --> 01:12:43,750
more time trying to solve it and answer
it right because it's more difficult

3596
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:43,760
it right because it's more difficult
 

3597
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,110
it right because it's more difficult
there's a prediction element there's a

3598
01:12:46,110 --> 01:12:46,120
there's a prediction element there's a
 

3599
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:49,510
there's a prediction element there's a
iterative element where you're like

3600
01:12:49,510 --> 01:12:49,520
iterative element where you're like
 

3601
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,070
iterative element where you're like
uh adjusting your understanding of a

3602
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:52,080
uh adjusting your understanding of a
 

3603
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,030
uh adjusting your understanding of a
thing by going over over and over and

3604
01:12:54,030 --> 01:12:54,040
thing by going over over and over and
 

3605
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:56,149
thing by going over over and over and
over there's a hierarchical element so

3606
01:12:56,149 --> 01:12:56,159
over there's a hierarchical element so
 

3607
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:58,070
over there's a hierarchical element so
on does this mean that a fundamental

3608
01:12:58,070 --> 01:12:58,080
on does this mean that a fundamental
 

3609
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,629
on does this mean that a fundamental
flaw of llms or does it mean

3610
01:13:00,629 --> 01:13:00,639
flaw of llms or does it mean
 

3611
01:13:00,639 --> 01:13:03,590
flaw of llms or does it mean
that there more part to that

3612
01:13:03,590 --> 01:13:03,600
that there more part to that
 

3613
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,629
that there more part to that
question now you're just behaving like

3614
01:13:05,629 --> 01:13:05,639
question now you're just behaving like
 

3615
01:13:05,639 --> 01:13:06,470
question now you're just behaving like
an

3616

an
 

3617
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:11,350
an
llm immediately answer no that that it's

3618
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:11,360
llm immediately answer no that that it's
 

3619
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:14,669
llm immediately answer no that that it's
just the lowlevel world model on top of

3620
01:13:14,669 --> 01:13:14,679
just the lowlevel world model on top of
 

3621
01:13:14,679 --> 01:13:17,669
just the lowlevel world model on top of
which we can then build some of these

3622
01:13:17,669 --> 01:13:17,679
which we can then build some of these
 

3623
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:19,510
which we can then build some of these
kinds of mechanisms like you said

3624
01:13:19,510 --> 01:13:19,520
kinds of mechanisms like you said
 

3625
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,910
kinds of mechanisms like you said
persistent long-term memory

3626
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:21,920
persistent long-term memory
 

3627
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:26,030
persistent long-term memory
or uh reasoning so on but we need that

3628
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:26,040
or uh reasoning so on but we need that
 

3629
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:28,510
or uh reasoning so on but we need that
world model that comes from language is

3630
01:13:28,510 --> 01:13:28,520
world model that comes from language is
 

3631
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:31,390
world model that comes from language is
it maybe it is not so difficult to build

3632
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:31,400
it maybe it is not so difficult to build
 

3633
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:34,310
it maybe it is not so difficult to build
this kind of uh reasoning system on top

3634
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:34,320
this kind of uh reasoning system on top
 

3635
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:37,270
this kind of uh reasoning system on top
of a well constructed World model OKAY

3636
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:37,280
of a well constructed World model OKAY
 

3637
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:39,510
of a well constructed World model OKAY
whether it's difficult or not the near

3638
01:13:39,510 --> 01:13:39,520
whether it's difficult or not the near
 

3639
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,709
whether it's difficult or not the near
future will will say because a lot of

3640
01:13:41,709 --> 01:13:41,719
future will will say because a lot of
 

3641
01:13:41,719 --> 01:13:43,750
future will will say because a lot of
people are working on reasoning and

3642
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:43,760
people are working on reasoning and
 

3643
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:46,229
people are working on reasoning and
planning abilities for for dialog

3644
01:13:46,229 --> 01:13:46,239
planning abilities for for dialog
 

3645
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:49,070
planning abilities for for dialog
systems um I mean if we're even if we

3646
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:49,080
systems um I mean if we're even if we
 

3647
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:50,669
systems um I mean if we're even if we
restrict ourselves to

3648
01:13:50,669 --> 01:13:50,679
restrict ourselves to
 

3649
01:13:50,679 --> 01:13:53,830
restrict ourselves to
language uh just having the ability to

3650
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:53,840
language uh just having the ability to
 

3651
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,790
language uh just having the ability to
plan your answer before you

3652
01:13:55,790 --> 01:13:55,800
plan your answer before you
 

3653
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:58,149
plan your answer before you
answer uh in terms that are not

3654
01:13:58,149 --> 01:13:58,159
answer uh in terms that are not
 

3655
01:13:58,159 --> 01:13:59,990
answer uh in terms that are not
necessarily linked with the language

3656
01:13:59,990 --> 01:14:00,000
necessarily linked with the language
 

3657
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,229
necessarily linked with the language
you're going to use to produce the

3658
01:14:01,229 --> 01:14:01,239
you're going to use to produce the
 

3659
01:14:01,239 --> 01:14:03,629
you're going to use to produce the
answer right so this idea of this mental

3660
01:14:03,629 --> 01:14:03,639
answer right so this idea of this mental
 

3661
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:05,189
answer right so this idea of this mental
model that allows you to plan what

3662
01:14:05,189 --> 01:14:05,199
model that allows you to plan what
 

3663
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:08,669
model that allows you to plan what
you're going to say before you say it

3664
01:14:08,669 --> 01:14:08,679
you're going to say before you say it
 

3665
01:14:08,679 --> 01:14:11,950
you're going to say before you say it
um that is very important I think

3666
01:14:11,950 --> 01:14:11,960
um that is very important I think
 

3667
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:13,750
um that is very important I think
there's going to be a lot of systems

3668
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:13,760
there's going to be a lot of systems
 

3669
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,350
there's going to be a lot of systems
over the next few years that are going

3670
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:15,360
over the next few years that are going
 

3671
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:18,110
over the next few years that are going
to have this capability but the

3672
01:14:18,110 --> 01:14:18,120
to have this capability but the
 

3673
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:19,870
to have this capability but the
blueprint of those systems would be

3674
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:19,880
blueprint of those systems would be
 

3675
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:22,070
blueprint of those systems would be
extremely different from autoregressive

3676
01:14:22,070 --> 01:14:22,080
extremely different from autoregressive
 

3677
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:25,550
extremely different from autoregressive
LMS so so

3678
01:14:25,550 --> 01:14:25,560
LMS so so
 

3679
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:28,709
LMS so so
um it's the same difference as the

3680
01:14:28,709 --> 01:14:28,719
um it's the same difference as the
 

3681
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:30,390
um it's the same difference as the
difference between what psychology is

3682
01:14:30,390 --> 01:14:30,400
difference between what psychology is
 

3683
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:31,910
difference between what psychology is
called system one and system two in

3684
01:14:31,910 --> 01:14:31,920
called system one and system two in
 

3685
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:34,350
called system one and system two in
humans right so system one is the type

3686
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:34,360
humans right so system one is the type
 

3687
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:36,310
humans right so system one is the type
of task that you can accomplish without

3688
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:36,320
of task that you can accomplish without
 

3689
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,070
of task that you can accomplish without
like deliberately consciously think

3690
01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:38,080
like deliberately consciously think
 

3691
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:41,990
like deliberately consciously think
about how you do them you just do them

3692
01:14:41,990 --> 01:14:42,000
about how you do them you just do them
 

3693
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,590
about how you do them you just do them
you've done them enough that you can

3694
01:14:43,590 --> 01:14:43,600
you've done them enough that you can
 

3695
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,629
you've done them enough that you can
just do it subconsciously right without

3696
01:14:45,629 --> 01:14:45,639
just do it subconsciously right without
 

3697
01:14:45,639 --> 01:14:46,950
just do it subconsciously right without
thinking about them if you're an

3698
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:46,960
thinking about them if you're an
 

3699
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:50,110
thinking about them if you're an
experience driver you can drive without

3700
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:50,120
experience driver you can drive without
 

3701
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:51,430
experience driver you can drive without
really thinking about it and you can

3702
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:51,440
really thinking about it and you can
 

3703
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:52,669
really thinking about it and you can
talk to someone at the same time or

3704
01:14:52,669 --> 01:14:52,679
talk to someone at the same time or
 

3705
01:14:52,679 --> 01:14:53,830
talk to someone at the same time or
listen to the radio

3706
01:14:53,830 --> 01:14:53,840
listen to the radio
 

3707
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:57,629
listen to the radio
right um if you are a very experienced

3708
01:14:57,629 --> 01:14:57,639
right um if you are a very experienced
 

3709
01:14:57,639 --> 01:14:59,750
right um if you are a very experienced
chess player you can play against a

3710
01:14:59,750 --> 01:14:59,760
chess player you can play against a
 

3711
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,390
chess player you can play against a
non-experienced chess player without

3712
01:15:01,390 --> 01:15:01,400
non-experienced chess player without
 

3713
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:02,790
non-experienced chess player without
really thinking either you just

3714
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:02,800
really thinking either you just
 

3715
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:05,110
really thinking either you just
recognize the pattern and you play MH

3716
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:05,120
recognize the pattern and you play MH
 

3717
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:08,510
recognize the pattern and you play MH
right that's system one um so all the

3718
01:15:08,510 --> 01:15:08,520
right that's system one um so all the
 

3719
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:10,110
right that's system one um so all the
things that you do instinctively without

3720
01:15:10,110 --> 01:15:10,120
things that you do instinctively without
 

3721
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:12,709
things that you do instinctively without
really having to deliberately plan and

3722
01:15:12,709 --> 01:15:12,719
really having to deliberately plan and
 

3723
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:14,070
really having to deliberately plan and
think about it and then there is all

3724
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:14,080
think about it and then there is all
 

3725
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:15,910
think about it and then there is all
tasks what you need to plan so if you

3726
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:15,920
tasks what you need to plan so if you
 

3727
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:19,510
tasks what you need to plan so if you
are not to experienced uh chess player

3728
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:19,520
are not to experienced uh chess player
 

3729
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:20,990
are not to experienced uh chess player
or you are experienced with you play

3730
01:15:20,990 --> 01:15:21,000
or you are experienced with you play
 

3731
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,830
or you are experienced with you play
against another experienced chess player

3732
01:15:22,830 --> 01:15:22,840
against another experienced chess player
 

3733
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:24,550
against another experienced chess player
you think about all kinds of options

3734
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:24,560
you think about all kinds of options
 

3735
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,990
you think about all kinds of options
right you you think about it for a while

3736
01:15:26,990 --> 01:15:27,000
right you you think about it for a while
 

3737
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,229
right you you think about it for a while
right and you you you're much better if

3738
01:15:29,229 --> 01:15:29,239
right and you you you're much better if
 

3739
01:15:29,239 --> 01:15:30,669
right and you you you're much better if
you have time to think about it than you

3740
01:15:30,669 --> 01:15:30,679
you have time to think about it than you
 

3741
01:15:30,679 --> 01:15:33,790
you have time to think about it than you
are if you if you play Blitz uh with

3742
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:33,800
are if you if you play Blitz uh with
 

3743
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:37,750
are if you if you play Blitz uh with
limited time so and um so this type of

3744
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:37,760
limited time so and um so this type of
 

3745
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:41,189
limited time so and um so this type of
deliberate uh planning which uses your

3746
01:15:41,189 --> 01:15:41,199
deliberate uh planning which uses your
 

3747
01:15:41,199 --> 01:15:44,510
deliberate uh planning which uses your
internal World model um that system to

3748
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:44,520
internal World model um that system to
 

3749
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:46,790
internal World model um that system to
this is what LMS currently cannot do so

3750
01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:46,800
this is what LMS currently cannot do so
 

3751
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,910
this is what LMS currently cannot do so
how how do we get them to do this right

3752
01:15:48,910 --> 01:15:48,920
how how do we get them to do this right
 

3753
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:51,070
how how do we get them to do this right
how do we build a system that can do

3754
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:51,080
how do we build a system that can do
 

3755
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:54,510
how do we build a system that can do
this kind of uh planning that or

3756
01:15:54,510 --> 01:15:54,520
this kind of uh planning that or
 

3757
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:57,470
this kind of uh planning that or
reasoning that devotes more resources to

3758
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:57,480
reasoning that devotes more resources to
 

3759
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:00,390
reasoning that devotes more resources to
complex problems than to simple problems

3760
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:00,400
complex problems than to simple problems
 

3761
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,270
complex problems than to simple problems
and it's not going to be Auto regressive

01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:02,280
and it's not going to be Auto regressive
 

3763

01:16:04,390 --> 01:16:04,400
prediction of tokens it's going to be
 

3765
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:08,310
prediction of tokens it's going to be
more something akin to inference of

01:16:08,310 --> 01:16:08,320
more something akin to inference of
 

3767
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:12,750
more something akin to inference of
Laten variables in um you know what used

3768
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:12,760
Laten variables in um you know what used
 

3769
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:15,350
Laten variables in um you know what used
to be called problemistic models or

3770
01:16:15,350 --> 01:16:15,360
to be called problemistic models or
 

3771
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:17,590
to be called problemistic models or
graphical models and things of that type

3772
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:17,600
graphical models and things of that type
 

3773
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,590
graphical models and things of that type
so basically the principle is like this

3774
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:19,600
so basically the principle is like this
 

3775
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,270
so basically the principle is like this
you you know the prompt is like a

3776
01:16:22,270 --> 01:16:22,280
you you know the prompt is like a
 

3777
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:27,390
you you know the prompt is like a
observed uh variables M and what your

3778
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:27,400
observed uh variables M and what your
 

3779
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:30,470
observed uh variables M and what your
what the model does is that it's

3780
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:30,480
what the model does is that it's
 

3781
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:31,790
what the model does is that it's
basically a

3782
01:16:31,790 --> 01:16:31,800
basically a
 

3783
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:35,030
basically a
measure of it can measure to what extent

3784
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:35,040
measure of it can measure to what extent
 

3785
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:38,470
measure of it can measure to what extent
an answer is a good answer for a prompt

3786
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:38,480
an answer is a good answer for a prompt
 

3787
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:40,510
an answer is a good answer for a prompt
okay so think of it as some gigantic

3788
01:16:40,510 --> 01:16:40,520
okay so think of it as some gigantic
 

3789
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,510
okay so think of it as some gigantic
neural net but it's got only one output

3790
01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:42,520
neural net but it's got only one output
 

3791
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:45,310
neural net but it's got only one output
and that output is a scalar number which

3792
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:45,320
and that output is a scalar number which
 

3793
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:48,030
and that output is a scalar number which
is let's say zero if the answer is a

3794
01:16:48,030 --> 01:16:48,040
is let's say zero if the answer is a
 

3795
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:50,430
is let's say zero if the answer is a
good answer for the question and a large

3796
01:16:50,430 --> 01:16:50,440
good answer for the question and a large
 

3797
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:52,070
good answer for the question and a large
number if the answer is not a good

3798
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:52,080
number if the answer is not a good
 

3799
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,110
number if the answer is not a good
answer for the question imagine you had

3800
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:54,120
answer for the question imagine you had
 

3801
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:56,629
answer for the question imagine you had
this model if you had such a model you

3802
01:16:56,629 --> 01:16:56,639
this model if you had such a model you
 

3803
01:16:56,639 --> 01:16:58,910
this model if you had such a model you
could use it to produce good answers the

3804
01:16:58,910 --> 01:16:58,920
could use it to produce good answers the
 

3805
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:00,350
could use it to produce good answers the
way you would do

3806
01:17:00,350 --> 01:17:00,360
way you would do
 

3807
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:03,030
way you would do
is you know produce the pumpt and then

3808
01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:03,040
is you know produce the pumpt and then
 

3809
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,709
is you know produce the pumpt and then
search through the space of possible

3810
01:17:04,709 --> 01:17:04,719
search through the space of possible
 

3811
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:07,790
search through the space of possible
answers for one that minimizes that

3812
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:07,800
answers for one that minimizes that
 

3813
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:11,070
answers for one that minimizes that
number um that's called an energy based

3814
01:17:11,070 --> 01:17:11,080
number um that's called an energy based
 

3815
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:14,189
number um that's called an energy based
model but that energy based model would

3816
01:17:14,189 --> 01:17:14,199
model but that energy based model would
 

3817
01:17:14,199 --> 01:17:17,510
model but that energy based model would
need the the model constructed by the

3818
01:17:17,510 --> 01:17:17,520
need the the model constructed by the
 

3819
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:20,550
need the the model constructed by the
llm well so uh really what you need to

3820
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:20,560
llm well so uh really what you need to
 

3821
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,629
llm well so uh really what you need to
do would be to not uh search over

3822
01:17:23,629 --> 01:17:23,639
do would be to not uh search over
 

3823
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:25,550
do would be to not uh search over
possible strings of text that minimize

3824
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:25,560
possible strings of text that minimize
 

3825
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:28,870
possible strings of text that minimize
that uh energy but what you would do it

3826
01:17:28,870 --> 01:17:28,880
that uh energy but what you would do it
 

3827
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:31,030
that uh energy but what you would do it
do this in abstract representation space

3828
01:17:31,030 --> 01:17:31,040
do this in abstract representation space
 

3829
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:33,430
do this in abstract representation space
so in in sort of the space of abstract

3830
01:17:33,430 --> 01:17:33,440
so in in sort of the space of abstract
 

3831
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:36,430
so in in sort of the space of abstract
thoughts you would elaborate a thought

3832
01:17:36,430 --> 01:17:36,440
thoughts you would elaborate a thought
 

3833
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:40,149
thoughts you would elaborate a thought
right using this process of minimizing

3834
01:17:40,149 --> 01:17:40,159
right using this process of minimizing
 

3835
01:17:40,159 --> 01:17:42,709
right using this process of minimizing
the output of your your model okay which

3836
01:17:42,709 --> 01:17:42,719
the output of your your model okay which
 

3837
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:45,790
the output of your your model okay which
is just a scalar um it's an optimization

3838
01:17:45,790 --> 01:17:45,800
is just a scalar um it's an optimization
 

3839
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,950
is just a scalar um it's an optimization
process right so now the the way the

3840
01:17:47,950 --> 01:17:47,960
process right so now the the way the
 

3841
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:50,990
process right so now the the way the
system produces its answer is through

3842
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:51,000
system produces its answer is through
 

3843
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,510
system produces its answer is through
optimization um by you know minimizing

3844
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:53,520
optimization um by you know minimizing
 

3845
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:56,310
optimization um by you know minimizing
an objective function basically right uh

3846
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:56,320
an objective function basically right uh
 

3847
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:57,229
an objective function basically right uh
and this is we're talking about

3848
01:17:57,229 --> 01:17:57,239
and this is we're talking about
 

3849
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:58,470
and this is we're talking about
inference we're not talking about

3850
01:17:58,470 --> 01:17:58,480
inference we're not talking about
 

3851
01:17:58,480 --> 01:17:59,870
inference we're not talking about
training right the system has been

3852
01:17:59,870 --> 01:17:59,880
training right the system has been
 

3853
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:01,709
training right the system has been
trained already so now we have an

3854
01:18:01,709 --> 01:18:01,719
trained already so now we have an
 

3855
01:18:01,719 --> 01:18:04,189
trained already so now we have an
abstract representation of the thought

3856
01:18:04,189 --> 01:18:04,199
abstract representation of the thought
 

3857
01:18:04,199 --> 01:18:05,669
abstract representation of the thought
of the answer representation of the

3858
01:18:05,669 --> 01:18:05,679
of the answer representation of the
 

3859
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:08,550
of the answer representation of the
answer we feed that to basically an auto

3860
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:08,560
answer we feed that to basically an auto
 

3861
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:11,149
answer we feed that to basically an auto
regive decoder uh which can be very

3862
01:18:11,149 --> 01:18:11,159
regive decoder uh which can be very
 

3863
01:18:11,159 --> 01:18:13,590
regive decoder uh which can be very
simple that turns this into a text that

3864
01:18:13,590 --> 01:18:13,600
simple that turns this into a text that
 

3865
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,350
simple that turns this into a text that
expresses this thought okay so that that

3866
01:18:16,350 --> 01:18:16,360
expresses this thought okay so that that
 

3867
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:19,070
expresses this thought okay so that that
in my opinion is the blueprint of future

3868
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:19,080
in my opinion is the blueprint of future
 

3869
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:22,350
in my opinion is the blueprint of future
dialog systems um they will think about

3870
01:18:22,350 --> 01:18:22,360
dialog systems um they will think about
 

3871
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:24,790
dialog systems um they will think about
their answer plan their answer by

3872
01:18:24,790 --> 01:18:24,800
their answer plan their answer by
 

3873
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,310
their answer plan their answer by
optimization before turning it into

3874
01:18:27,310 --> 01:18:27,320
optimization before turning it into
 

3875
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:31,430
optimization before turning it into
text uh and that is tur complete can you

3876
01:18:31,430 --> 01:18:31,440
text uh and that is tur complete can you
 

3877
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:33,229
text uh and that is tur complete can you
explain exactly what the optimization

3878
01:18:33,229 --> 01:18:33,239
explain exactly what the optimization
 

3879
01:18:33,239 --> 01:18:35,750
explain exactly what the optimization
problem there is like what's the

3880
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:35,760
problem there is like what's the
 

3881
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:38,590
problem there is like what's the
objective function just link on it you

3882
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:38,600
objective function just link on it you
 

3883
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:41,270
objective function just link on it you
you kind of briefly described it but

3884
01:18:41,270 --> 01:18:41,280
you kind of briefly described it but
 

3885
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:43,830
you kind of briefly described it but
over what space are you optimizing the

3886
01:18:43,830 --> 01:18:43,840
over what space are you optimizing the
 

3887
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:44,790
over what space are you optimizing the
space of

3888
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:44,800
space of
 

3889
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,470
space of
representations those abstract

3890
01:18:46,470 --> 01:18:46,480
representations those abstract
 

3891
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,830
representations those abstract
representation abstract repr so you have

3892
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:48,840
representation abstract repr so you have
 

3893
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:51,110
representation abstract repr so you have
an abstract representation inside the

3894
01:18:51,110 --> 01:18:51,120
an abstract representation inside the
 

3895
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:52,950
an abstract representation inside the
system you have a prompt The Prompt goes

3896
01:18:52,950 --> 01:18:52,960
system you have a prompt The Prompt goes
 

3897
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,310
system you have a prompt The Prompt goes
through an encoder produces a

3898
01:18:54,310 --> 01:18:54,320
through an encoder produces a
 

3899
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:55,910
through an encoder produces a
representation perhaps goes through a

3900
01:18:55,910 --> 01:18:55,920
representation perhaps goes through a
 

3901
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:57,550
representation perhaps goes through a
predictor that predicts a representation

3902
01:18:57,550 --> 01:18:57,560
predictor that predicts a representation
 

3903
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:59,830
predictor that predicts a representation
of the answer of the proper answer but

3904
01:18:59,830 --> 01:18:59,840
of the answer of the proper answer but
 

3905
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:03,669
of the answer of the proper answer but
that representation may not be a good

3906
01:19:03,669 --> 01:19:03,679
that representation may not be a good
 

3907
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,110
that representation may not be a good
answer because there might there might

3908
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:05,120
answer because there might there might
 

3909
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,669
answer because there might there might
be some complicated reasoning you need

3910
01:19:06,669 --> 01:19:06,679
be some complicated reasoning you need
 

3911
01:19:06,679 --> 01:19:10,149
be some complicated reasoning you need
to do right so um so then you have

3912
01:19:10,149 --> 01:19:10,159
to do right so um so then you have
 

3913
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:12,669
to do right so um so then you have
another process that takes the

3914
01:19:12,669 --> 01:19:12,679
another process that takes the
 

3915
01:19:12,679 --> 01:19:14,510
another process that takes the
representation of the answers and

3916
01:19:14,510 --> 01:19:14,520
representation of the answers and
 

3917
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:17,590
representation of the answers and
modifies it so as to

3918
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:17,600
modifies it so as to
 

3919
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:20,070
modifies it so as to
minimize uh a cost function that

3920
01:19:20,070 --> 01:19:20,080
minimize uh a cost function that
 

3921
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,590
minimize uh a cost function that
measures to what extent the answer is a

3922
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:21,600
measures to what extent the answer is a
 

3923
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:24,629
measures to what extent the answer is a
good answer for the question now we we

3924
01:19:24,629 --> 01:19:24,639
good answer for the question now we we
 

3925
01:19:24,639 --> 01:19:28,189
good answer for the question now we we
sort of ignore the the fact for I mean

3926
01:19:28,189 --> 01:19:28,199
sort of ignore the the fact for I mean
 

3927
01:19:28,199 --> 01:19:30,350
sort of ignore the the fact for I mean
the issue for a moment of how you train

3928
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:30,360
the issue for a moment of how you train
 

3929
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:33,910
the issue for a moment of how you train
that system to measure whether an answer

3930
01:19:33,910 --> 01:19:33,920
that system to measure whether an answer
 

3931
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:36,189
that system to measure whether an answer
is a good answer for for a question but

3932
01:19:36,189 --> 01:19:36,199
is a good answer for for a question but
 

3933
01:19:36,199 --> 01:19:38,870
is a good answer for for a question but
suppos such a system could be created

3934
01:19:38,870 --> 01:19:38,880
suppos such a system could be created
 

3935
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,950
suppos such a system could be created
but what's the process this kind of

3936
01:19:40,950 --> 01:19:40,960
but what's the process this kind of
 

3937
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:43,590
but what's the process this kind of
search like process it's a optimization

3938
01:19:43,590 --> 01:19:43,600
search like process it's a optimization
 

3939
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,709
search like process it's a optimization
process you can do this if if the entire

3940
01:19:45,709 --> 01:19:45,719
process you can do this if if the entire
 

3941
01:19:45,719 --> 01:19:46,709
process you can do this if if the entire
system is

3942
01:19:46,709 --> 01:19:46,719
system is
 

3943
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:49,669
system is
differentiable that scalar output is the

3944
01:19:49,669 --> 01:19:49,679
differentiable that scalar output is the
 

3945
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:51,709
differentiable that scalar output is the
result of you know running through some

3946
01:19:51,709 --> 01:19:51,719
result of you know running through some
 

3947
01:19:51,719 --> 01:19:54,550
result of you know running through some
neural net mhm uh running the answer the

3948
01:19:54,550 --> 01:19:54,560
neural net mhm uh running the answer the
 

3949
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:55,910
neural net mhm uh running the answer the
representation of the answer to some

3950
01:19:55,910 --> 01:19:55,920
representation of the answer to some
 

3951
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:58,350
representation of the answer to some
neural net then by gradient descent by

3952
01:19:58,350 --> 01:19:58,360
neural net then by gradient descent by
 

3953
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,550
neural net then by gradient descent by
back propag back propagating gradients

3954
01:20:00,550 --> 01:20:00,560
back propag back propagating gradients
 

3955
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,470
back propag back propagating gradients
you can figure out like how to modify

3956
01:20:02,470 --> 01:20:02,480
you can figure out like how to modify
 

3957
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,030
you can figure out like how to modify
the representation of the answer so has

3958
01:20:04,030 --> 01:20:04,040
the representation of the answer so has
 

3959
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:05,709
the representation of the answer so has
to minimize that so that's still a

3960
01:20:05,709 --> 01:20:05,719
to minimize that so that's still a
 

3961
01:20:05,719 --> 01:20:07,669
to minimize that so that's still a
gradient based it's gradient based

3962
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:07,679
gradient based it's gradient based
 

3963
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,149
gradient based it's gradient based
inference so now you have a

3964
01:20:09,149 --> 01:20:09,159
inference so now you have a
 

3965
01:20:09,159 --> 01:20:11,149
inference so now you have a
representation of the answer in abstract

3966
01:20:11,149 --> 01:20:11,159
representation of the answer in abstract
 

3967
01:20:11,159 --> 01:20:13,709
representation of the answer in abstract
space now you can turn it into

3968
01:20:13,709 --> 01:20:13,719
space now you can turn it into
 

3969
01:20:13,719 --> 01:20:17,590
space now you can turn it into
text right and the cool thing about this

3970
01:20:17,590 --> 01:20:17,600
text right and the cool thing about this
 

3971
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:20,830
text right and the cool thing about this
is that the representation now can be

3972
01:20:20,830 --> 01:20:20,840
is that the representation now can be
 

3973
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:23,270
is that the representation now can be
optimized through gr and descent but so

3974
01:20:23,270 --> 01:20:23,280
optimized through gr and descent but so
 

3975
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:24,750
optimized through gr and descent but so
is independent of the language in which

3976
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:24,760
is independent of the language in which
 

3977
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:26,629
is independent of the language in which
you're going to express the

3978
01:20:26,629 --> 01:20:26,639
you're going to express the
 

3979
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:28,870
you're going to express the
answer right so you're operating in the

3980
01:20:28,870 --> 01:20:28,880
answer right so you're operating in the
 

3981
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:30,350
answer right so you're operating in the
substract representation I mean this

3982
01:20:30,350 --> 01:20:30,360
substract representation I mean this
 

3983
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:32,550
substract representation I mean this
goes back to the Joint embedding right

3984
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:32,560
goes back to the Joint embedding right
 

3985
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:35,310
goes back to the Joint embedding right
that is better to work in the uh in the

3986
01:20:35,310 --> 01:20:35,320
that is better to work in the uh in the
 

3987
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:38,750
that is better to work in the uh in the
space of I don't know to romanticize the

3988
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:38,760
space of I don't know to romanticize the
 

3989
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:41,350
space of I don't know to romanticize the
notion like space of Concepts versus

3990
01:20:41,350 --> 01:20:41,360
notion like space of Concepts versus
 

3991
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:43,430
notion like space of Concepts versus
yeah the space of

3992
01:20:43,430 --> 01:20:43,440
yeah the space of
 

3993
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:46,390
yeah the space of
concrete sensory information

3994
01:20:46,390 --> 01:20:46,400
concrete sensory information
 

3995
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:49,430
concrete sensory information
right okay but this can can this do

3996
01:20:49,430 --> 01:20:49,440
right okay but this can can this do
 

3997
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:50,910
right okay but this can can this do
something like reasoning which is what

3998
01:20:50,910 --> 01:20:50,920
something like reasoning which is what
 

3999
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:52,910
something like reasoning which is what
we're talking about well not really in

4000
01:20:52,910 --> 01:20:52,920
we're talking about well not really in
 

4001
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:54,310
we're talking about well not really in
only in a very simple way I mean

4002
01:20:54,310 --> 01:20:54,320
only in a very simple way I mean
 

4003
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,229
only in a very simple way I mean
basically you can think of those things

4004
01:20:56,229 --> 01:20:56,239
basically you can think of those things
 

4005
01:20:56,239 --> 01:20:58,669
basically you can think of those things
that's doing the kind of optimization I

4006
01:20:58,669 --> 01:20:58,679
that's doing the kind of optimization I
 

4007
01:20:58,679 --> 01:21:00,669
that's doing the kind of optimization I
was I was talking about except the

4008
01:21:00,669 --> 01:21:00,679
was I was talking about except the
 

4009
01:21:00,679 --> 01:21:02,470
was I was talking about except the
optimize in a discrete space which is

4010
01:21:02,470 --> 01:21:02,480
optimize in a discrete space which is
 

4011
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:04,750
optimize in a discrete space which is
the space of possible sequences of of

4012
01:21:04,750 --> 01:21:04,760
the space of possible sequences of of
 

4013
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:06,990
the space of possible sequences of of
tokens and they do it they do this

4014
01:21:06,990 --> 01:21:07,000
tokens and they do it they do this
 

4015
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,990
tokens and they do it they do this
optimization in a horribly inefficient

4016
01:21:08,990 --> 01:21:09,000
optimization in a horribly inefficient
 

4017
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,550
optimization in a horribly inefficient
way which is generate a lot of

4018
01:21:10,550 --> 01:21:10,560
way which is generate a lot of
 

4019
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:13,310
way which is generate a lot of
hypothesis and then select the best ones

4020
01:21:13,310 --> 01:21:13,320
hypothesis and then select the best ones
 

4021
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:14,669
hypothesis and then select the best ones
and that's

4022
01:21:14,669 --> 01:21:14,679
and that's
 

4023
01:21:14,679 --> 01:21:17,830
and that's
incredibly wasteful in terms of uh

4024
01:21:17,830 --> 01:21:17,840
incredibly wasteful in terms of uh
 

4025
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,590
incredibly wasteful in terms of uh
computation because you have you run you

4026
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:19,600
computation because you have you run you
 

4027
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,629
computation because you have you run you
basically have to run your LM for like

4028
01:21:21,629 --> 01:21:21,639
basically have to run your LM for like
 

4029
01:21:21,639 --> 01:21:26,030
basically have to run your LM for like
every you know Genera sequence um and

4030
01:21:26,030 --> 01:21:26,040
every you know Genera sequence um and
 

4031
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:29,470
every you know Genera sequence um and
it's incredibly wasteful um so it's much

4032
01:21:29,470 --> 01:21:29,480
it's incredibly wasteful um so it's much
 

4033
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:32,470
it's incredibly wasteful um so it's much
better to do an optimization in

4034
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:32,480
better to do an optimization in
 

4035
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:34,229
better to do an optimization in
continuous space where you can do great

4036
01:21:34,229 --> 01:21:34,239
continuous space where you can do great

4039
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,990

tons of things and then select the best

4040
01:21:37,990 --> 01:21:38,000

4041
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,950
tons of things and then select the best
you just iteratively refine your answer

4042
01:21:40,950 --> 01:21:40,960
you just iteratively refine your answer
 

4043
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:42,990
you just iteratively refine your answer
to to go towards the best right that's

4044
01:21:42,990 --> 01:21:43,000
to to go towards the best right that's
 

4045
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,830
to to go towards the best right that's
much more efficient you can only do this

4046
01:21:44,830 --> 01:21:44,840
much more efficient you can only do this
 

4047
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:47,350
much more efficient you can only do this
in continuous spaces with differentiable

4048
01:21:47,350 --> 01:21:47,360
in continuous spaces with differentiable
 

4049
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:49,229
in continuous spaces with differentiable
functions you're talking about the

4050
01:21:49,229 --> 01:21:49,239
functions you're talking about the
 

4051
01:21:49,239 --> 01:21:52,270
functions you're talking about the
reasoning like ability to think deeply

4052
01:21:52,270 --> 01:21:52,280
reasoning like ability to think deeply
 

4053
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:54,070
reasoning like ability to think deeply
or to reason

4054
01:21:54,070 --> 01:21:54,080
or to reason
 

4055
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:56,950
or to reason
deeply how do you know

4056
01:21:56,950 --> 01:21:56,960
deeply how do you know
 

4057
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,950
deeply how do you know
what is an

4058
01:21:59,950 --> 01:21:59,960
what is an
 

4059
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:03,110
what is an
answer uh that's better or worse based

4060
01:22:03,110 --> 01:22:03,120
answer uh that's better or worse based
 

4061
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:05,550
answer uh that's better or worse based
on deep reasoning right so then we're

4062
01:22:05,550 --> 01:22:05,560
on deep reasoning right so then we're
 

4063
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:07,430
on deep reasoning right so then we're
asking the question of conceptually how

4064
01:22:07,430 --> 01:22:07,440
asking the question of conceptually how
 

4065
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,270
asking the question of conceptually how
do you train an energy base model right

4066
01:22:09,270 --> 01:22:09,280
do you train an energy base model right
 

4067
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,990
do you train an energy base model right
so en based model is a function with a

4068
01:22:11,990 --> 01:22:12,000
so en based model is a function with a
 

4069
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,830
so en based model is a function with a
scalar output just a

4070
01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:13,840
scalar output just a
 

4071
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:18,070
scalar output just a
number you give it two inputs X and Y

4072
01:22:18,070 --> 01:22:18,080
number you give it two inputs X and Y
 

4073
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,510
number you give it two inputs X and Y
and it tells you whether Y is compatible

4074
01:22:19,510 --> 01:22:19,520
and it tells you whether Y is compatible
 

4075
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,910
and it tells you whether Y is compatible
with X or not X You observe let's say

4076
01:22:21,910 --> 01:22:21,920
with X or not X You observe let's say
 

4077
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:25,149
with X or not X You observe let's say
it's a pump image video whatever and why

4078
01:22:25,149 --> 01:22:25,159
it's a pump image video whatever and why
 

4079
01:22:25,159 --> 01:22:28,110
it's a pump image video whatever and why
is a proposal for an answer a

4080
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:28,120
is a proposal for an answer a
 

4081
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:31,350
is a proposal for an answer a
continuation of video um you know

4082
01:22:31,350 --> 01:22:31,360
continuation of video um you know
 

4083
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:33,350

01:22:33,350 --> 01:22:33,360
whatever and it tells you whether Y is
 

4085
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:35,950
whatever and it tells you whether Y is
compatible with X and the way it tells

4086
01:22:35,950 --> 01:22:35,960
compatible with X and the way it tells
 

4087
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,830
compatible with X and the way it tells
you that Y is compatible with X is that

4088
01:22:37,830 --> 01:22:37,840
you that Y is compatible with X is that
 

4089
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,189
you that Y is compatible with X is that
the output of that function would be

4090
01:22:39,189 --> 01:22:39,199
the output of that function would be
 

4091
01:22:39,199 --> 01:22:41,629
the output of that function would be
zero if Y is compatible with X it would

4092
01:22:41,629 --> 01:22:41,639
zero if Y is compatible with X it would
 

4093
01:22:41,639 --> 01:22:45,110
zero if Y is compatible with X it would
be a positive number non zero if Y is

4094
01:22:45,110 --> 01:22:45,120
be a positive number non zero if Y is
 

4095
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,830
be a positive number non zero if Y is
not compatible with X okay how do you

4096
01:22:47,830 --> 01:22:47,840
not compatible with X okay how do you
 

4097
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:50,310
not compatible with X okay how do you
train a system like this at a completely

4098
01:22:50,310 --> 01:22:50,320
train a system like this at a completely
 

4099
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:54,590
train a system like this at a completely
General level is you show it pairs of X

4100
01:22:54,590 --> 01:22:54,600
General level is you show it pairs of X
 

4101
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,790
General level is you show it pairs of X
and Y that are compatible a question and

4102
01:22:56,790 --> 01:22:56,800
and Y that are compatible a question and
 

4103
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:59,149
and Y that are compatible a question and
the corresponding answer and you train

4104
01:22:59,149 --> 01:22:59,159
the corresponding answer and you train
 

4105
01:22:59,159 --> 01:23:01,350
the corresponding answer and you train
the parameters of the big neural net

4106
01:23:01,350 --> 01:23:01,360
the parameters of the big neural net
 

4107
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:03,709
the parameters of the big neural net
inside U to produce

4108
01:23:03,709 --> 01:23:03,719
inside U to produce
 

4109
01:23:03,719 --> 01:23:06,910
inside U to produce
zero okay now that doesn't completely

4110
01:23:06,910 --> 01:23:06,920
zero okay now that doesn't completely
 

4111
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:08,830
zero okay now that doesn't completely
work because the system might decide

4112
01:23:08,830 --> 01:23:08,840
work because the system might decide
 

4113
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:10,510
work because the system might decide
well I'm just going to say zero for

4114
01:23:10,510 --> 01:23:10,520
well I'm just going to say zero for
 

4115
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:12,470
well I'm just going to say zero for
everything so now you have to have a

4116
01:23:12,470 --> 01:23:12,480
everything so now you have to have a
 

4117
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:15,470
everything so now you have to have a
process to make sure that for a a wrong

4118
01:23:15,470 --> 01:23:15,480
process to make sure that for a a wrong
 

4119
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:18,750
process to make sure that for a a wrong
y the energy would be larger than zero

4120
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:18,760
y the energy would be larger than zero
 

4121
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,870
y the energy would be larger than zero
and there you have two options one is

4122
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:20,880
and there you have two options one is
 

4123
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,750
and there you have two options one is
contrastive Method so contrastive method

4124
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:22,760
contrastive Method so contrastive method
 

4125
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:25,189
contrastive Method so contrastive method
is you show an X and a bad

4126
01:23:25,189 --> 01:23:25,199
is you show an X and a bad
 

4127
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:27,990
is you show an X and a bad
Y and you tell the system well that's

4128
01:23:27,990 --> 01:23:28,000
Y and you tell the system well that's
 

4129
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,750
Y and you tell the system well that's
you know give a high energy to this like

4130
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:29,760
you know give a high energy to this like
 

4131
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,189
you know give a high energy to this like
push up the energy right change the

4132
01:23:31,189 --> 01:23:31,199
push up the energy right change the
 

4133
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:32,590
push up the energy right change the
weights in the neural net that comput

4134
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:32,600
weights in the neural net that comput
 

4135
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:35,189
weights in the neural net that comput
the energy so that it goes

4136
01:23:35,189 --> 01:23:35,199
the energy so that it goes
 

4137
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:37,709
the energy so that it goes
up um so that's contrasting methods the

4138
01:23:37,709 --> 01:23:37,719
up um so that's contrasting methods the
 

4139
01:23:37,719 --> 01:23:40,350
up um so that's contrasting methods the
problem with this is if the space of Y

4140
01:23:40,350 --> 01:23:40,360
problem with this is if the space of Y
 

4141
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:44,189
problem with this is if the space of Y
is large the number of such contrasty

4142
01:23:44,189 --> 01:23:44,199
is large the number of such contrasty
 

4143
01:23:44,199 --> 01:23:45,550
is large the number of such contrasty
samples you're going to have to

4144
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:45,560
samples you're going to have to
 

4145
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:47,470
samples you're going to have to
show is

4146
01:23:47,470 --> 01:23:47,480
show is
 

4147
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:50,550
show is
gigantic but people do this they they do

4148
01:23:50,550 --> 01:23:50,560
gigantic but people do this they they do
 

4149
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:53,510
gigantic but people do this they they do
this when you train a system with RF

4150
01:23:53,510 --> 01:23:53,520
this when you train a system with RF
 

4151
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:56,590
this when you train a system with RF
basically what you're training is what's

4152
01:23:56,590 --> 01:23:56,600
basically what you're training is what's
 

4153
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:58,669
basically what you're training is what's
called a reward model which is basically

4154
01:23:58,669 --> 01:23:58,679
called a reward model which is basically
 

4155
01:23:58,679 --> 01:24:00,870
called a reward model which is basically
an objective function that tells you

4156
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:00,880
an objective function that tells you
 

4157
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,629
an objective function that tells you
whether an answer is good or bad and

4158
01:24:02,629 --> 01:24:02,639
whether an answer is good or bad and
 

4159
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:05,870
whether an answer is good or bad and
that's basically exactly what what this

4160
01:24:05,870 --> 01:24:05,880
that's basically exactly what what this
 

4161
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:08,390
that's basically exactly what what this
is so we already do this to some extent

4162
01:24:08,390 --> 01:24:08,400
is so we already do this to some extent
 

4163
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:09,790
is so we already do this to some extent
we're just not using it for inference

4164
01:24:09,790 --> 01:24:09,800
we're just not using it for inference
 

4165
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:13,910
we're just not using it for inference
we're just using it for training um uh

4166
01:24:13,910 --> 01:24:13,920
we're just using it for training um uh
 

4167
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,910
we're just using it for training um uh
there is another set of methods which

4168
01:24:15,910 --> 01:24:15,920
there is another set of methods which
 

4169
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:19,110
there is another set of methods which
are non contrastive and I prefer those

4170
01:24:19,110 --> 01:24:19,120
are non contrastive and I prefer those
 

4171
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:20,870
are non contrastive and I prefer those
uh and those non-contrastive method

4172
01:24:20,870 --> 01:24:20,880
uh and those non-contrastive method
 

4173
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,950
uh and those non-contrastive method
basically say

4174
01:24:22,950 --> 01:24:22,960
basically say
 

4175
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:26,510
basically say
uh okay the energy function needs to

4176
01:24:26,510 --> 01:24:26,520
uh okay the energy function needs to
 

4177
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:29,510
uh okay the energy function needs to
have low energy on pairs of xys that are

4178
01:24:29,510 --> 01:24:29,520
have low energy on pairs of xys that are
 

4179
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:31,310
have low energy on pairs of xys that are
compatible that come from your training

4180
01:24:31,310 --> 01:24:31,320
compatible that come from your training
 

4181
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:34,070
compatible that come from your training
set how do you make sure that the energy

4182
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:34,080
set how do you make sure that the energy
 

4183
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:36,110
set how do you make sure that the energy
is going to be higher everywhere

4184
01:24:36,110 --> 01:24:36,120
is going to be higher everywhere
 

4185
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:40,030
is going to be higher everywhere
else and the way you do this is by um

4186
01:24:40,030 --> 01:24:40,040
else and the way you do this is by um
 

4187
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:43,709
else and the way you do this is by um
having a regularizer a Criterion a term

4188
01:24:43,709 --> 01:24:43,719
having a regularizer a Criterion a term
 

4189
01:24:43,719 --> 01:24:45,870
having a regularizer a Criterion a term
in your cost function that basically

4190
01:24:45,870 --> 01:24:45,880
in your cost function that basically
 

4191
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:49,390
in your cost function that basically
minimizes the volume of space that can

4192
01:24:49,390 --> 01:24:49,400
minimizes the volume of space that can
 

4193
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:50,709
minimizes the volume of space that can
take low

4194
01:24:50,709 --> 01:24:50,719
take low
 

4195
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:53,189
take low
energy and the precise way to do this is

4196
01:24:53,189 --> 01:24:53,199
energy and the precise way to do this is
 

4197
01:24:53,199 --> 01:24:54,910
energy and the precise way to do this is
all kinds of different specific ways to

4198
01:24:54,910 --> 01:24:54,920
all kinds of different specific ways to
 

4199
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:56,350
all kinds of different specific ways to
do this depending on the architecture

4200
01:24:56,350 --> 01:24:56,360
do this depending on the architecture
 

4201
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:58,950
do this depending on the architecture
but that's the basic principle so that

4202
01:24:58,950 --> 01:24:58,960
but that's the basic principle so that
 

4203
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,310
but that's the basic principle so that
if you push down the energy function for

4204
01:25:01,310 --> 01:25:01,320
if you push down the energy function for
 

4205
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:04,030
if you push down the energy function for
particular regions in the XY space it

4206
01:25:04,030 --> 01:25:04,040
particular regions in the XY space it
 

4207
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:06,149
particular regions in the XY space it
will automatically go up in other places

4208
01:25:06,149 --> 01:25:06,159
will automatically go up in other places
 

4209
01:25:06,159 --> 01:25:08,910
will automatically go up in other places
because there's only a limited volume of

4210
01:25:08,910 --> 01:25:08,920
because there's only a limited volume of
 

4211
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:12,070
because there's only a limited volume of
space that can take low energy okay by

4212
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:12,080
space that can take low energy okay by
 

4213
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:13,790
space that can take low energy okay by
the construction of the system or by the

4214
01:25:13,790 --> 01:25:13,800
the construction of the system or by the
 

4215
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:16,750
the construction of the system or by the
regularizer regularizing function we've

4216
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:16,760
regularizer regularizing function we've
 

4217
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:19,350
regularizer regularizing function we've
been talking very generally but what is

4218
01:25:19,350 --> 01:25:19,360
been talking very generally but what is
 

4219
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,790
been talking very generally but what is
a good X and a good Y what is a good

4220
01:25:21,790 --> 01:25:21,800
a good X and a good Y what is a good
 

4221
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:22,870
a good X and a good Y what is a good
representation

4222
01:25:22,870 --> 01:25:22,880
representation
 

4223
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:26,350
representation
of X and Y because we've been talking

4224
01:25:26,350 --> 01:25:26,360
of X and Y because we've been talking
 

4225
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:28,270
of X and Y because we've been talking
about language and if you just take

4226
01:25:28,270 --> 01:25:28,280
about language and if you just take
 

4227
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:31,590
about language and if you just take
language directly that presumably is not

4228
01:25:31,590 --> 01:25:31,600
language directly that presumably is not
 

4229
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,189
language directly that presumably is not
good so there has to be some kind of

4230
01:25:33,189 --> 01:25:33,199
good so there has to be some kind of
 

4231
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:35,149
good so there has to be some kind of
abstract representation of

4232
01:25:35,149 --> 01:25:35,159
abstract representation of
 

4233
01:25:35,159 --> 01:25:37,669
abstract representation of
ideas yeah so you I mean you can do this

4234
01:25:37,669 --> 01:25:37,679
ideas yeah so you I mean you can do this
 

4235
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:40,350
ideas yeah so you I mean you can do this
with language directly um by just you

4236
01:25:40,350 --> 01:25:40,360
with language directly um by just you
 

4237
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:42,910
with language directly um by just you
know X is a text and Y is a continuation

4238
01:25:42,910 --> 01:25:42,920
know X is a text and Y is a continuation
 

4239
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:46,669
know X is a text and Y is a continuation
of that text yes um or X is a question

4240
01:25:46,669 --> 01:25:46,679
of that text yes um or X is a question
 

4241
01:25:46,679 --> 01:25:48,510
of that text yes um or X is a question
why is the answer but you're you're

4242
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:48,520
why is the answer but you're you're
 

4243
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:49,669
why is the answer but you're you're
saying that's not going to take it I

4244
01:25:49,669 --> 01:25:49,679
saying that's not going to take it I
 

4245
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:51,270
saying that's not going to take it I
mean that's going to do what llms are

4246
01:25:51,270 --> 01:25:51,280
mean that's going to do what llms are
 

4247
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:54,750
mean that's going to do what llms are
doing well no it depends on how you how

4248
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:54,760
doing well no it depends on how you how
 

4249
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:56,669
doing well no it depends on how you how
the internal structure of the system is

4250
01:25:56,669 --> 01:25:56,679
the internal structure of the system is
 

4251
01:25:56,679 --> 01:25:58,470
the internal structure of the system is
built if the if the internal structure

4252
01:25:58,470 --> 01:25:58,480
built if the if the internal structure
 

4253
01:25:58,480 --> 01:25:59,950
built if the if the internal structure
of the system is built in such a way

4254
01:25:59,950 --> 01:25:59,960
of the system is built in such a way
 

4255
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:02,750
of the system is built in such a way
that inside of this system there is a

4256
01:26:02,750 --> 01:26:02,760
that inside of this system there is a
 

4257
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:06,109
that inside of this system there is a
latent variable it's called Z that

4258
01:26:06,109 --> 01:26:06,119
latent variable it's called Z that
 

4259
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:10,310
latent variable it's called Z that
uh you can manipulate so as to minimize

4260
01:26:10,310 --> 01:26:10,320
uh you can manipulate so as to minimize
 

4261
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:11,990
uh you can manipulate so as to minimize
the output

4262
01:26:11,990 --> 01:26:12,000
the output
 

4263
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,030
the output
energy then that Z can be viewed as a

4264
01:26:15,030 --> 01:26:15,040
energy then that Z can be viewed as a
 

4265
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,870
energy then that Z can be viewed as a
representation of a good answer that you

4266
01:26:16,870 --> 01:26:16,880
representation of a good answer that you
 

4267
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:20,030
representation of a good answer that you
can translate into a y that is a good

4268
01:26:20,030 --> 01:26:20,040
can translate into a y that is a good
 

4269
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:22,310
can translate into a y that is a good
answer so this kind of system could be

4270
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:22,320
answer so this kind of system could be
 

4271
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:24,990
answer so this kind of system could be
train in a very similar way very similar

4272
01:26:24,990 --> 01:26:25,000
train in a very similar way very similar
 

4273
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,950
train in a very similar way very similar
way but you have to have this way of

4274
01:26:26,950 --> 01:26:26,960
way but you have to have this way of
 

4275
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:29,790
way but you have to have this way of
preventing collapse of of ensuring that

4276
01:26:29,790 --> 01:26:29,800
preventing collapse of of ensuring that
 

4277
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:31,910
preventing collapse of of ensuring that
you know there is high energy for things

4278
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:31,920
you know there is high energy for things
 

4279
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:35,669
you know there is high energy for things
you don't train it on um and and

4280
01:26:35,669 --> 01:26:35,679
you don't train it on um and and
 

4281
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:38,629
you don't train it on um and and
currently it's it's very implicit in llm

4282
01:26:38,629 --> 01:26:38,639
currently it's it's very implicit in llm
 

4283
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:39,750
currently it's it's very implicit in llm
is done in a way that people don't

4284
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:39,760
is done in a way that people don't
 

4285
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,270
is done in a way that people don't
realize it's being done but is it is

4286
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:41,280
realize it's being done but is it is
 

4287
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:43,750
realize it's being done but is it is
being done is is due to the fact that

4288
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:43,760
being done is is due to the fact that
 

4289
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:48,189
being done is is due to the fact that
when you give a high probability to a a

4290
01:26:48,189 --> 01:26:48,199
when you give a high probability to a a
 

4291
01:26:48,199 --> 01:26:50,229
when you give a high probability to a a
word automatically you give low

4292
01:26:50,229 --> 01:26:50,239
word automatically you give low
 

4293
01:26:50,239 --> 01:26:51,950
word automatically you give low
probability to other words because you

4294
01:26:51,950 --> 01:26:51,960
probability to other words because you
 

4295
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:54,830
probability to other words because you
only have a finite amount of probability

4296
01:26:54,830 --> 01:26:54,840
only have a finite amount of probability
 

4297
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:56,629
only have a finite amount of probability
to go around right there have to some to

4298
01:26:56,629 --> 01:26:56,639
to go around right there have to some to
 

4299
01:26:56,639 --> 01:26:58,870
to go around right there have to some to
one so when you minimize the cross

4300
01:26:58,870 --> 01:26:58,880

4301
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:01,310

01:27:07,070 --> 01:27:07,080
word uh you're increasing the
 

4309
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:08,550
word uh you're increasing the

4310
01:27:08,550 --> 01:27:08,560
probability your system will give to the
 

4311
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:09,990
probability your system will give to the
correct word but you're also decreasing

4312
01:27:09,990 --> 01:27:10,000
correct word but you're also decreasing
 

4313
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,070
correct word but you're also decreasing
the probability will give to the

01:27:11,070 --> 01:27:11,080
the probability will give to the
 

4315
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:14,790
the probability will give to the
incorrect words now indirectly that

4316
01:27:14,790 --> 01:27:14,800
incorrect words now indirectly that
 

4317
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:17,229
incorrect words now indirectly that
gives a low probability to a high

4318
01:27:17,229 --> 01:27:17,239
gives a low probability to a high
 

4319
01:27:17,239 --> 01:27:18,830
gives a low probability to a high
probability to sequences of words that

4320
01:27:18,830 --> 01:27:18,840
probability to sequences of words that
 

4321
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:20,430
probability to sequences of words that
are good and low probability to

4322
01:27:20,430 --> 01:27:20,440
are good and low probability to
 

4323
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:21,790
are good and low probability to
sequences of words that are bad but it's

4324
01:27:21,790 --> 01:27:21,800
sequences of words that are bad but it's
 

4325
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:24,790
sequences of words that are bad but it's
very direct mhm and it's not it's not

4326
01:27:24,790 --> 01:27:24,800
very direct mhm and it's not it's not
 

4327
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:26,750
very direct mhm and it's not it's not
obvious why this actually works at all

4328
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:26,760
obvious why this actually works at all
 

4329
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:29,709
obvious why this actually works at all
but um because you're not doing it on a

4330
01:27:29,709 --> 01:27:29,719
but um because you're not doing it on a
 

4331
01:27:29,719 --> 01:27:31,910
but um because you're not doing it on a
joint probability of all the symbols in

4332
01:27:31,910 --> 01:27:31,920
joint probability of all the symbols in
 

4333
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:33,669
joint probability of all the symbols in
a in a sequence you're just doing it

4334
01:27:33,669 --> 01:27:33,679
a in a sequence you're just doing it
 

4335
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:36,950
a in a sequence you're just doing it
kind of uh you sort of factorize that

4336
01:27:36,950 --> 01:27:36,960
kind of uh you sort of factorize that
 

4337
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,910
kind of uh you sort of factorize that
probability in terms of conditional

4338
01:27:38,910 --> 01:27:38,920
probability in terms of conditional
 

4339
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:41,430
probability in terms of conditional
probabilities over successive tokens so

4340
01:27:41,430 --> 01:27:41,440
probabilities over successive tokens so
 

4341
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:44,189
probabilities over successive tokens so
how do you do this for visual data so

4342
01:27:44,189 --> 01:27:44,199
how do you do this for visual data so
 

4343
01:27:44,199 --> 01:27:45,430
how do you do this for visual data so
we've been doing this with all jepa

4344
01:27:45,430 --> 01:27:45,440
we've been doing this with all jepa
 

4345
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:49,390
we've been doing this with all jepa
architectures basically the joint I so

4346
01:27:49,390 --> 01:27:49,400
architectures basically the joint I so
 

4347
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:51,750
architectures basically the joint I so
uh there are the compatibility between

4348
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:51,760
uh there are the compatibility between
 

4349
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:54,990
uh there are the compatibility between
two things is uh you know here's here's

4350
01:27:54,990 --> 01:27:55,000
two things is uh you know here's here's
 

4351
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,870
two things is uh you know here's here's
an image or a video here's a corrupted

4352
01:27:56,870 --> 01:27:56,880
an image or a video here's a corrupted
 

4353
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:58,510
an image or a video here's a corrupted
shifted or transformed version of that

4354
01:27:58,510 --> 01:27:58,520
shifted or transformed version of that
 

4355
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:02,350
shifted or transformed version of that
image or video or masked okay and then

4356
01:28:02,350 --> 01:28:02,360
image or video or masked okay and then
 

4357
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:05,189
image or video or masked okay and then
uh the energy of the system is the

4358
01:28:05,189 --> 01:28:05,199
uh the energy of the system is the
 

4359
01:28:05,199 --> 01:28:08,350
uh the energy of the system is the
prediction error of

4360
01:28:08,350 --> 01:28:08,360
prediction error of
 

4361
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:11,070
prediction error of
the

4362
01:28:11,070 --> 01:28:11,080
the
 

4363
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:13,350
the
representation uh the the predicted

4364
01:28:13,350 --> 01:28:13,360
representation uh the the predicted
 

4365
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:14,990
representation uh the the predicted
representation of the Good Thing versus

4366
01:28:14,990 --> 01:28:15,000
representation of the Good Thing versus
 

4367
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,430
representation of the Good Thing versus
the actual representation of the good

4368
01:28:16,430 --> 01:28:16,440
the actual representation of the good
 

4369
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:19,950
the actual representation of the good
thing right so so you run the corrupted

4370
01:28:19,950 --> 01:28:19,960
thing right so so you run the corrupted
 

4371
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:21,430
thing right so so you run the corrupted
image to the system predict the

4372
01:28:21,430 --> 01:28:21,440
image to the system predict the
 

4373
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:23,750
image to the system predict the
representation of the the good input

4374
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:23,760
representation of the the good input
 

4375
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:25,350
representation of the the good input
uncorrupted and then compute the

4376
01:28:25,350 --> 01:28:25,360
uncorrupted and then compute the
 

4377
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:27,149
uncorrupted and then compute the
prediction error that's the energy of

4378
01:28:27,149 --> 01:28:27,159
prediction error that's the energy of
 

4379
01:28:27,159 --> 01:28:30,030
prediction error that's the energy of
the system so this system will tell you

4380
01:28:30,030 --> 01:28:30,040
the system so this system will tell you
 

4381
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:32,590
the system so this system will tell you
this is a

4382
01:28:32,590 --> 01:28:32,600
this is a
 

4383
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:35,070
this is a
good you know if this is a good image

4384
01:28:35,070 --> 01:28:35,080
good you know if this is a good image
 

4385
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:36,990
good you know if this is a good image
and this is a corrupted version it will

4386
01:28:36,990 --> 01:28:37,000
and this is a corrupted version it will
 

4387
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,109
and this is a corrupted version it will
give you Zero Energy if those two things

4388
01:28:39,109 --> 01:28:39,119
give you Zero Energy if those two things
 

4389
01:28:39,119 --> 01:28:41,669
give you Zero Energy if those two things
are effectively one of them is a

4390
01:28:41,669 --> 01:28:41,679
are effectively one of them is a
 

4391
01:28:41,679 --> 01:28:43,470
are effectively one of them is a
corrupted version of the other give you

4392
01:28:43,470 --> 01:28:43,480
corrupted version of the other give you
 

4393
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:45,430
corrupted version of the other give you
a high energy if if the two images are

4394
01:28:45,430 --> 01:28:45,440
a high energy if if the two images are
 

4395
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:47,229
a high energy if if the two images are
completely different and hopefully that

4396
01:28:47,229 --> 01:28:47,239
completely different and hopefully that
 

4397
01:28:47,239 --> 01:28:49,950
completely different and hopefully that
whole process gives you a really nice

4398
01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:49,960
whole process gives you a really nice
 

4399
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:53,430
whole process gives you a really nice
compressed representation of of reality

4400
01:28:53,430 --> 01:28:53,440
compressed representation of of reality
 

4401
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:55,510
compressed representation of of reality
of visual reality and we know it does

4402
01:28:55,510 --> 01:28:55,520
of visual reality and we know it does
 

4403
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:56,790
of visual reality and we know it does
because then we use those for our

4404
01:28:56,790 --> 01:28:56,800
because then we use those for our
 

4405
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,310
because then we use those for our
presentations as input to a

4406
01:28:58,310 --> 01:28:58,320

works really nicely okay well so to

4410
01:29:03,390 --> 01:29:03,400
works really nicely okay well so to
 

4411
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:08,109
works really nicely okay well so to
summarize you recommend in a in a in a

4412
01:29:08,109 --> 01:29:08,119
summarize you recommend in a in a in a
 

4413
01:29:08,119 --> 01:29:10,510
summarize you recommend in a in a in a
spicy way that only Yan laon can you

4414
01:29:10,510 --> 01:29:10,520
spicy way that only Yan laon can you
 

4415
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:12,189
spicy way that only Yan laon can you
recommend that we abandon generative

4416
01:29:12,189 --> 01:29:12,199
recommend that we abandon generative
 

4417
01:29:12,199 --> 01:29:13,950
recommend that we abandon generative
models in favor of joint embedding

4418

architectures yes abandon autor

4420
01:29:16,149 --> 01:29:16,159
architectures yes abandon autor
 

4421
01:29:16,159 --> 01:29:19,590
architectures yes abandon autor
regressive generation yes abandon Pro

4422
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:19,600
regressive generation yes abandon Pro
 

4423
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:21,990
regressive generation yes abandon Pro
this feels like a court testimony uh

4424
01:29:21,990 --> 01:29:22,000
this feels like a court testimony uh
 

4425
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,070
this feels like a court testimony uh
abandon probabilistic models in favor of

4426
01:29:24,070 --> 01:29:24,080
abandon probabilistic models in favor of
 

4427
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:26,149
abandon probabilistic models in favor of
energy based models as we talked about

4428
01:29:26,149 --> 01:29:26,159
energy based models as we talked about
 

4429
01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:28,350
energy based models as we talked about
abandon contrastive methods in favor of

4430
01:29:28,350 --> 01:29:28,360
abandon contrastive methods in favor of
 

4431
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:31,109
abandon contrastive methods in favor of
regularized methods and uh let me ask

4432
01:29:31,109 --> 01:29:31,119
regularized methods and uh let me ask
 

4433
01:29:31,119 --> 01:29:34,590
regularized methods and uh let me ask
you about this you've been for a while a

4434
01:29:34,590 --> 01:29:34,600
you about this you've been for a while a
 

4435
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:37,470
you about this you've been for a while a
Critic of reinforcement learning yes so

4436
01:29:37,470 --> 01:29:37,480
Critic of reinforcement learning yes so
 

4437
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:39,550
Critic of reinforcement learning yes so
what uh the last recommendation is that

4438
01:29:39,550 --> 01:29:39,560
what uh the last recommendation is that
 

4439
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:42,590
what uh the last recommendation is that
we abandon RL in favor of Mo model

4440
01:29:42,590 --> 01:29:42,600
we abandon RL in favor of Mo model
 

4441
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:44,270
we abandon RL in favor of Mo model
predictive control as you were talking

4442
01:29:44,270 --> 01:29:44,280
predictive control as you were talking
 

4443
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:47,229
predictive control as you were talking
about and only use RL when planning

4444
01:29:47,229 --> 01:29:47,239
about and only use RL when planning
 

4445
01:29:47,239 --> 01:29:50,510
about and only use RL when planning
doesn't yield the pr predicted outcome

4446
01:29:50,510 --> 01:29:50,520
doesn't yield the pr predicted outcome
 

4447
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:53,189
doesn't yield the pr predicted outcome
and uh we use RL in that case to adjust

4448
01:29:53,189 --> 01:29:53,199
and uh we use RL in that case to adjust
 

4449
01:29:53,199 --> 01:29:57,550
and uh we use RL in that case to adjust
the world model or the critic yes so uh

4450
01:29:57,550 --> 01:29:57,560
the world model or the critic yes so uh
 

4451
01:29:57,560 --> 01:30:00,870
the world model or the critic yes so uh
you mentioned uh rlf reinforcement

4452
01:30:00,870 --> 01:30:00,880
you mentioned uh rlf reinforcement
 

4453
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:03,390
you mentioned uh rlf reinforcement
learning with human feedback uh why do

4454
01:30:03,390 --> 01:30:03,400
learning with human feedback uh why do
 

4455
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:05,709
learning with human feedback uh why do
you still hate uh reinforcement learning

4456
01:30:05,709 --> 01:30:05,719
you still hate uh reinforcement learning
 

4457
01:30:05,719 --> 01:30:07,070
you still hate uh reinforcement learning
I don't hate reinforcement learning and

4458
01:30:07,070 --> 01:30:07,080
I don't hate reinforcement learning and
 

4459
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:10,390
I don't hate reinforcement learning and
I think all of I think it should not be

4460
01:30:10,390 --> 01:30:10,400
I think all of I think it should not be
 

4461
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,950
I think all of I think it should not be
uh abandoned completely but I think its

4462
01:30:12,950 --> 01:30:12,960
uh abandoned completely but I think its
 

4463
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:15,109
uh abandoned completely but I think its
use should be minimized because it's

4464
01:30:15,109 --> 01:30:15,119
use should be minimized because it's
 

4465
01:30:15,119 --> 01:30:17,350
use should be minimized because it's
incredibly inefficient in terms of

4466
01:30:17,350 --> 01:30:17,360
incredibly inefficient in terms of
 

4467
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:19,830
incredibly inefficient in terms of
samples and so the the proper way to

4468
01:30:19,830 --> 01:30:19,840
samples and so the the proper way to
 

4469
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:23,350
samples and so the the proper way to
train a system is to First just have it

4470
01:30:23,350 --> 01:30:23,360
train a system is to First just have it
 

4471
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:26,270
train a system is to First just have it
learn uh good representations of the

4472
01:30:26,270 --> 01:30:26,280
learn uh good representations of the
 

4473
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:28,709
learn uh good representations of the
world and World models from Mostly

4474
01:30:28,709 --> 01:30:28,719
world and World models from Mostly
 

4475
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:30,430
world and World models from Mostly
observation maybe a little bit of

4476
01:30:30,430 --> 01:30:30,440
observation maybe a little bit of
 

4477
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:32,790
observation maybe a little bit of
interactions and then steered based on

4478
01:30:32,790 --> 01:30:32,800
interactions and then steered based on
 

4479
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,310
interactions and then steered based on
that if the representation is good then

4480
01:30:34,310 --> 01:30:34,320
that if the representation is good then
 

4481
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:35,990
that if the representation is good then
the adjustment should be

4482
01:30:35,990 --> 01:30:36,000
the adjustment should be
 

4483
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,109
the adjustment should be
minimal yeah now there's two things you

4484
01:30:38,109 --> 01:30:38,119
minimal yeah now there's two things you
 

4485
01:30:38,119 --> 01:30:39,910
minimal yeah now there's two things you
can use if you've learned a world model

4486
01:30:39,910 --> 01:30:39,920
can use if you've learned a world model
 

4487
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:41,790
can use if you've learned a world model
you can use the world model to plan a

4488
01:30:41,790 --> 01:30:41,800
you can use the world model to plan a
 

4489
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:43,270
you can use the world model to plan a
sequence of actions to arrive at a

4490
01:30:43,270 --> 01:30:43,280
sequence of actions to arrive at a
 

4491
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:44,790
sequence of actions to arrive at a
particular

4492
01:30:44,790 --> 01:30:44,800
particular
 

4493
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:48,910
particular
objective you don't need a unless the

4494
01:30:48,910 --> 01:30:48,920
objective you don't need a unless the
 

4495
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:50,270
objective you don't need a unless the
way you measure whether you succeed

4496
01:30:50,270 --> 01:30:50,280
way you measure whether you succeed
 

4497
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:54,550
way you measure whether you succeed
might be inexact your idea of you know

4498
01:30:54,550 --> 01:30:54,560
might be inexact your idea of you know
 

4499
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:57,350
might be inexact your idea of you know
whether you're going to fall from your

4500
01:30:57,350 --> 01:30:57,360
whether you're going to fall from your
 

4501
01:30:57,360 --> 01:31:00,629
whether you're going to fall from your
bike might be wrong or whether the

4502
01:31:00,629 --> 01:31:00,639
bike might be wrong or whether the
 

4503
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:02,350
bike might be wrong or whether the
person you're fighting with MMA is going

4504
01:31:02,350 --> 01:31:02,360
person you're fighting with MMA is going
 

4505
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:05,470
person you're fighting with MMA is going
to do something and do something else um

4506
01:31:05,470 --> 01:31:05,480
to do something and do something else um
 

4507
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:09,030
to do something and do something else um
so there uh so there's two ways you can

4508
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:09,040
so there uh so there's two ways you can
 

4509
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:11,790
so there uh so there's two ways you can
be wrong either your your objective

4510
01:31:11,790 --> 01:31:11,800
be wrong either your your objective
 

4511
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:14,030
be wrong either your your objective
function does not reflect the actual

4512
01:31:14,030 --> 01:31:14,040
function does not reflect the actual
 

4513
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:16,350
function does not reflect the actual
objective function you want to optimize

4514
01:31:16,350 --> 01:31:16,360
objective function you want to optimize
 

4515
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:18,550
objective function you want to optimize
or your world model is

4516
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:18,560
or your world model is
 

4517
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:21,070
or your world model is
inaccurate right so you didn't you the

4518
01:31:21,070 --> 01:31:21,080
inaccurate right so you didn't you the
 

4519
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:22,470
inaccurate right so you didn't you the
prediction you were making about what

4520
01:31:22,470 --> 01:31:22,480
prediction you were making about what
 

4521
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,350
prediction you were making about what
was going to happen in the world is

4522
01:31:24,350 --> 01:31:24,360
was going to happen in the world is
 

4523
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:26,709
was going to happen in the world is
inaccurate so if you want to adjust your

4524
01:31:26,709 --> 01:31:26,719
inaccurate so if you want to adjust your
 

4525
01:31:26,719 --> 01:31:29,910
inaccurate so if you want to adjust your
world model while you are operating the

4526
01:31:29,910 --> 01:31:29,920
world model while you are operating the
 

4527
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:34,149
world model while you are operating the
world or your objective function that is

4528
01:31:34,149 --> 01:31:34,159
world or your objective function that is
 

4529
01:31:34,159 --> 01:31:36,109
world or your objective function that is
basically in the realm of RL this is

4530
01:31:36,109 --> 01:31:36,119
basically in the realm of RL this is
 

4531
01:31:36,119 --> 01:31:39,030
basically in the realm of RL this is
what RL deal deals with uh to some

4532
01:31:39,030 --> 01:31:39,040
what RL deal deals with uh to some
 

4533
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:40,990
what RL deal deals with uh to some
extent right so adjust your world model

4534
01:31:40,990 --> 01:31:41,000
extent right so adjust your world model
 

4535
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,990
extent right so adjust your world model
and the way to adjust your world model

4536
01:31:42,990 --> 01:31:43,000
and the way to adjust your world model
 

4537
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:46,830
and the way to adjust your world model
even in advance uh is to explore parts

4538
01:31:46,830 --> 01:31:46,840
even in advance uh is to explore parts
 

4539
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:48,189
even in advance uh is to explore parts
of the space where your world model

4540
01:31:48,189 --> 01:31:48,199
of the space where your world model
 

4541
01:31:48,199 --> 01:31:49,669
of the space where your world model
where you know that your world model is

4542
01:31:49,669 --> 01:31:49,679
where you know that your world model is
 

4543
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:52,070
where you know that your world model is
inaccurate that's called curiosity

4544
01:31:52,070 --> 01:31:52,080
inaccurate that's called curiosity
 

4545
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:55,669
inaccurate that's called curiosity
basically or play right when you play

4546
01:31:55,669 --> 01:31:55,679
basically or play right when you play
 

4547
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:58,750
basically or play right when you play
you kind of explore part of the St space

4548
01:31:58,750 --> 01:31:58,760
you kind of explore part of the St space
 

4549
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:00,310
you kind of explore part of the St space
that

4550
01:32:00,310 --> 01:32:00,320
that
 

4551
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:04,189
that
um you know you don't want to do in for

4552
01:32:04,189 --> 01:32:04,199
um you know you don't want to do in for
 

4553
01:32:04,199 --> 01:32:06,390
um you know you don't want to do in for
real because it might be dangerous but

4554
01:32:06,390 --> 01:32:06,400
real because it might be dangerous but
 

4555
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:09,750
real because it might be dangerous but
but you can adjust your world model uh

4556
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:09,760
but you can adjust your world model uh
 

4557
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:13,189
but you can adjust your world model uh
without killing yourself basically um so

4558
01:32:13,189 --> 01:32:13,199
without killing yourself basically um so
 

4559
01:32:13,199 --> 01:32:15,189
without killing yourself basically um so
that's what you want to use ourl for

4560
01:32:15,189 --> 01:32:15,199
that's what you want to use ourl for
 

4561
01:32:15,199 --> 01:32:16,910
that's what you want to use ourl for
when when when it comes time to learning

4562
01:32:16,910 --> 01:32:16,920
when when when it comes time to learning
 

4563
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:19,510
when when when it comes time to learning
a particular task you already have all

4564
01:32:19,510 --> 01:32:19,520
a particular task you already have all
 

4565
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:20,910
a particular task you already have all
the good representations you already

4566
01:32:20,910 --> 01:32:20,920
the good representations you already
 

4567
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:22,390
the good representations you already
have your world model but you want you

4568
01:32:22,390 --> 01:32:22,400
have your world model but you want you
 

4569
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:24,149
have your world model but you want you
need to adjust it for the situation at

4570
01:32:24,149 --> 01:32:24,159
need to adjust it for the situation at
 

4571
01:32:24,159 --> 01:32:26,910
need to adjust it for the situation at
hand that's when you use RL why do you

4572
01:32:26,910 --> 01:32:26,920
hand that's when you use RL why do you
 

4573
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:30,390
hand that's when you use RL why do you
think rhf works so well this

4574
01:32:30,390 --> 01:32:30,400
think rhf works so well this
 

4575
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:31,669
think rhf works so well this
reinforcement learning with human

4576
01:32:31,669 --> 01:32:31,679
reinforcement learning with human
 

4577
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:33,750
reinforcement learning with human
feedback why did it have such a

4578
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:33,760
feedback why did it have such a
 

4579
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:36,070
feedback why did it have such a
transformational effect on large

4580
01:32:36,070 --> 01:32:36,080
transformational effect on large
 

4581
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:38,390
transformational effect on large
language models that before what's had

4582
01:32:38,390 --> 01:32:38,400
language models that before what's had
 

4583
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:41,109
language models that before what's had
the transformational effect is human

4584
01:32:41,109 --> 01:32:41,119
the transformational effect is human
 

4585
01:32:41,119 --> 01:32:43,629
the transformational effect is human
feedback there's many ways to use it and

4586
01:32:43,629 --> 01:32:43,639
feedback there's many ways to use it and
 

4587
01:32:43,639 --> 01:32:45,430
feedback there's many ways to use it and
some of it is just purely supervised

4588
01:32:45,430 --> 01:32:45,440
some of it is just purely supervised
 

4589
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,790
some of it is just purely supervised
actually it's not really reinforcement

4590
01:32:46,790 --> 01:32:46,800
actually it's not really reinforcement
 

4591
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:50,229
actually it's not really reinforcement
rning so it's the the HF it's the HF

4592
01:32:50,229 --> 01:32:50,239
rning so it's the the HF it's the HF
 

4593
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:52,390
rning so it's the the HF it's the HF
yeah uh and then there is ways to use

4594
01:32:52,390 --> 01:32:52,400
yeah uh and then there is ways to use
 

4595
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:54,390
yeah uh and then there is ways to use
human feedback right so you can you can

4596
01:32:54,390 --> 01:32:54,400
human feedback right so you can you can
 

4597
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:57,590
human feedback right so you can you can
ask humans to rate answers multiple

4598
01:32:57,590 --> 01:32:57,600
ask humans to rate answers multiple
 

4599
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:00,830
ask humans to rate answers multiple
answers that are produced by World model

4600
01:33:00,830 --> 01:33:00,840
answers that are produced by World model
 

4601
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:04,109
answers that are produced by World model
and uh and and then what you do is you

4602
01:33:04,109 --> 01:33:04,119
and uh and and then what you do is you
 

4603
01:33:04,119 --> 01:33:06,430
and uh and and then what you do is you
train an objective function to predict

4604
01:33:06,430 --> 01:33:06,440
train an objective function to predict
 

4605
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:07,189
train an objective function to predict
that

4606
01:33:07,189 --> 01:33:07,199
that
 

4607
01:33:07,199 --> 01:33:09,590
that
rating and then you can use that

4608
01:33:09,590 --> 01:33:09,600
rating and then you can use that
 

4609
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:12,590
rating and then you can use that
objective function to predict you know

4610
01:33:12,590 --> 01:33:12,600
objective function to predict you know
 

4611
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:13,870
objective function to predict you know
whether an answer is good and you can

4612
01:33:13,870 --> 01:33:13,880
whether an answer is good and you can
 

4613
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:15,070
whether an answer is good and you can
back propagate gradient through this to

4614
01:33:15,070 --> 01:33:15,080
back propagate gradient through this to
 

4615
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:16,830
back propagate gradient through this to
find you new system so that it only

4616
01:33:16,830 --> 01:33:16,840
find you new system so that it only
 

4617
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:19,790
find you new system so that it only
produces High highly rated

4618
01:33:19,790 --> 01:33:19,800
produces High highly rated
 

4619
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:22,109
produces High highly rated
answers okay so that's

4620
01:33:22,109 --> 01:33:22,119
answers okay so that's
 

4621
01:33:22,119 --> 01:33:25,430
answers okay so that's
one way so that's like in ourl that

4622
01:33:25,430 --> 01:33:25,440
one way so that's like in ourl that
 

4623
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:27,990
one way so that's like in ourl that
means uh training what's called a reward

4624
01:33:27,990 --> 01:33:28,000
means uh training what's called a reward
 

4625
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,669
means uh training what's called a reward
model right so something that you know

4626
01:33:30,669 --> 01:33:30,679
model right so something that you know
 

4627
01:33:30,679 --> 01:33:32,310
model right so something that you know
basically a small on that that estimates

4628
01:33:32,310 --> 01:33:32,320
basically a small on that that estimates
 

4629
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:35,030
basically a small on that that estimates
to what extent an answer is good right

4630
01:33:35,030 --> 01:33:35,040
to what extent an answer is good right
 

4631
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:37,030
to what extent an answer is good right
it's very similar to The Objective I was

4632
01:33:37,030 --> 01:33:37,040
it's very similar to The Objective I was
 

4633
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:38,709
it's very similar to The Objective I was
I was talking about talking about

01:33:38,709 --> 01:33:38,719
I was talking about talking about
 

4635
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:40,350
I was talking about talking about

4638
01:33:41,830 --> 01:33:41,840
used for planning it's it's used for
 

4639
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,350

01:33:43,350 --> 01:33:43,360
fine-tuning your
 

4641
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:45,109
fine-tuning your
system I think it would be much more

4642
01:33:45,109 --> 01:33:45,119
system I think it would be much more
 

4643
01:33:45,119 --> 01:33:48,390
system I think it would be much more
efficient to use it for planning but um

4644
01:33:48,390 --> 01:33:48,400
efficient to use it for planning but um
 

4645
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:50,709
efficient to use it for planning but um
but but uh currently it's used to fine

tune the parameters the system now there

4648
01:33:52,870 --> 01:33:52,880

there's several ways to do this um you

4650
01:33:54,950 --> 01:33:54,960
there's several ways to do this um you
 

4651
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:57,430
there's several ways to do this um you
know some of some of them are supervised

4652
01:33:57,430 --> 01:33:57,440
know some of some of them are supervised
 

4653
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:59,669
know some of some of them are supervised
you just you know ask a human person

4654
01:33:59,669 --> 01:33:59,679
you just you know ask a human person
 

4655
01:33:59,679 --> 01:34:02,030
you just you know ask a human person
like what is a good answer for this

4656
01:34:02,030 --> 01:34:02,040
like what is a good answer for this
 

4657
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:05,750
like what is a good answer for this
right then you just type the answer um

4658
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:05,760
right then you just type the answer um
 

4659
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:07,030
right then you just type the answer um
uh I mean there's there's lots of ways

4660
01:34:07,030 --> 01:34:07,040
uh I mean there's there's lots of ways
 

4661
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:09,669
uh I mean there's there's lots of ways

all that kind of stuff so you uh

4710
01:35:20,390 --> 01:35:20,400
all that kind of stuff so you uh
 

4711
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:23,070
all that kind of stuff so you uh
commented on Twitter saying that open

4712
01:35:23,070 --> 01:35:23,080
commented on Twitter saying that open
 

4713
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:26,830
commented on Twitter saying that open
source is the answer yeah essentially so

4714
01:35:26,830 --> 01:35:26,840
source is the answer yeah essentially so
 

4715
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:28,629
source is the answer yeah essentially so
um can you

4716
01:35:28,629 --> 01:35:28,639
um can you
 

4717
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:31,109
um can you
explain I I actually made that comment

4718
01:35:31,109 --> 01:35:31,119

and I've I I've uh I've made that point
 

4723
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:40,550
and I've I I've uh I've made that point
multiple times in in various forums um

4724
01:35:40,550 --> 01:35:40,560
multiple times in in various forums um
 

4725
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:43,109
multiple times in in various forums um
uh here's my my point of view on this uh

4726
01:35:43,109 --> 01:35:43,119
uh here's my my point of view on this uh
 

4727
01:35:43,119 --> 01:35:46,510
uh here's my my point of view on this uh
people can complain that AI systems are

4728
01:35:46,510 --> 01:35:46,520
people can complain that AI systems are
 

4729
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:50,109
people can complain that AI systems are
biased and they generally are biased by

4730
01:35:50,109 --> 01:35:50,119
biased and they generally are biased by
 

4731
01:35:50,119 --> 01:35:52,070
biased and they generally are biased by
the distribution of the training data

4732
01:35:52,070 --> 01:35:52,080
the distribution of the training data
 

4733
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:55,470
the distribution of the training data
that they've been trained on um that

4734
01:35:55,470 --> 01:35:55,480
that they've been trained on um that
 

4735
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:57,550
that they've been trained on um that
reflects biases in

4736
01:35:57,550 --> 01:35:57,560
reflects biases in
 

4737
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:02,550
reflects biases in
society um and that is potentially

4738
01:36:02,550 --> 01:36:02,560
society um and that is potentially
 

4739
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,870
society um and that is potentially
offensive to some

4740
01:36:03,870 --> 01:36:03,880
offensive to some
 

4741
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:08,470
offensive to some
people or potentially not and and some

4742
01:36:08,470 --> 01:36:08,480
people or potentially not and and some
 

4743
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:09,629
people or potentially not and and some
techniques to

4744
01:36:09,629 --> 01:36:09,639
techniques to
 

4745
01:36:09,639 --> 01:36:13,189
techniques to
debias then become offensive to some

4746
01:36:13,189 --> 01:36:13,199
debias then become offensive to some
 

4747
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:18,669
debias then become offensive to some
people um because of you know historical

4748
01:36:18,669 --> 01:36:18,679
people um because of you know historical
 

4749
01:36:18,679 --> 01:36:22,149
people um because of you know historical
uh incorrectness and things like that

4750
01:36:22,149 --> 01:36:22,159
uh incorrectness and things like that
 

4751
01:36:22,159 --> 01:36:25,430
uh incorrectness and things like that
um and so you can ask the question you

4752
01:36:25,430 --> 01:36:25,440
um and so you can ask the question you
 

4753
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:26,830
um and so you can ask the question you
can ask two questions the first question

4754
01:36:26,830 --> 01:36:26,840
can ask two questions the first question
 

4755
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:29,510
can ask two questions the first question
is is it possible to produce an AI

4756
01:36:29,510 --> 01:36:29,520
is is it possible to produce an AI
 

4757
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:31,350
is is it possible to produce an AI
system that is not biased and the answer

4758
01:36:31,350 --> 01:36:31,360
system that is not biased and the answer
 

4759
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:33,830
system that is not biased and the answer
is absolutely not and it's not because

4760
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:33,840
is absolutely not and it's not because
 

4761
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:35,030
is absolutely not and it's not because
of

4762
01:36:35,030 --> 01:36:35,040
of
 

4763
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:37,790
of
technological uh challenges although

4764
01:36:37,790 --> 01:36:37,800
technological uh challenges although
 

4765
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:40,430
technological uh challenges although
there are technological challenges to

4766
01:36:40,430 --> 01:36:40,440
there are technological challenges to
 

4767
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:42,629
there are technological challenges to
that it's

4768
01:36:42,629 --> 01:36:42,639
that it's
 

4769
01:36:42,639 --> 01:36:45,510
that it's
because bias is in the eye of the

4770
01:36:45,510 --> 01:36:45,520
because bias is in the eye of the
 

4771
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:47,629
because bias is in the eye of the
beholder um different people may have

4772
01:36:47,629 --> 01:36:47,639
beholder um different people may have
 

4773
01:36:47,639 --> 01:36:49,990
beholder um different people may have
different ideas about what constitutes

4774
01:36:49,990 --> 01:36:50,000
different ideas about what constitutes
 

4775
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,990
different ideas about what constitutes
bias um you know for a lot of uh a lot

4776
01:36:52,990 --> 01:36:53,000
bias um you know for a lot of uh a lot
 

4777
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,310
bias um you know for a lot of uh a lot
of things I mean there are facts that

4778
01:36:54,310 --> 01:36:54,320
of things I mean there are facts that
 

4779
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:57,669
of things I mean there are facts that
are you know indisputable but there are

4780
01:36:57,669 --> 01:36:57,679
are you know indisputable but there are
 

4781
01:36:57,679 --> 01:36:59,830
are you know indisputable but there are
a lot of opinions or or things that can

4782
01:36:59,830 --> 01:36:59,840
a lot of opinions or or things that can
 

4783
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:03,189
a lot of opinions or or things that can
be expressed in different ways U and so

4784
01:37:03,189 --> 01:37:03,199
be expressed in different ways U and so
 

4785
01:37:03,199 --> 01:37:04,870
be expressed in different ways U and so
you cannot have an unbiased system

4786
01:37:04,870 --> 01:37:04,880
you cannot have an unbiased system
 

4787
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:06,669
you cannot have an unbiased system
that's just an

4788
01:37:06,669 --> 01:37:06,679
that's just an
 

4789
01:37:06,679 --> 01:37:10,270
that's just an
impossibility um and so what's

4790
01:37:10,270 --> 01:37:10,280
impossibility um and so what's
 

4791
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:12,910
impossibility um and so what's
the what's the answer to this and the

4792
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:12,920
the what's the answer to this and the
 

4793
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:15,510
the what's the answer to this and the
the answer is the same answer that we

4794
01:37:15,510 --> 01:37:15,520
the answer is the same answer that we
 

4795
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:19,790
the answer is the same answer that we
found in Liberal democracy about the

4796
01:37:19,790 --> 01:37:19,800
found in Liberal democracy about the
 

4797
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:24,270
found in Liberal democracy about the
press the Press to be free and uh

4798
01:37:24,270 --> 01:37:24,280
press the Press to be free and uh
 

4799
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:27,070
press the Press to be free and uh
diverse we have free speech for a good

4800
01:37:27,070 --> 01:37:27,080
diverse we have free speech for a good
 

4801
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:30,910
diverse we have free speech for a good
reason is because uh we don't want all

4802
01:37:30,910 --> 01:37:30,920
reason is because uh we don't want all
 

4803
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:34,669
reason is because uh we don't want all
of our information to be uh to come from

4804
01:37:34,669 --> 01:37:34,679
of our information to be uh to come from
 

4805
01:37:34,679 --> 01:37:37,550
of our information to be uh to come from
a unique Source um because that's

4806
01:37:37,550 --> 01:37:37,560
a unique Source um because that's
 

4807
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:40,390
a unique Source um because that's
opposite to the whole idea of democracy

4808
01:37:40,390 --> 01:37:40,400
opposite to the whole idea of democracy
 

4809
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:43,589
opposite to the whole idea of democracy
and uh you know progress of ideas and

4810
01:37:43,589 --> 01:37:43,599
and uh you know progress of ideas and
 

4811
01:37:43,599 --> 01:37:45,910
and uh you know progress of ideas and
even science right in in science people

4812
01:37:45,910 --> 01:37:45,920
even science right in in science people
 

4813
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:48,990
even science right in in science people
have to argue for different opinions and

4814
01:37:48,990 --> 01:37:49,000
have to argue for different opinions and
 

4815
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,790
have to argue for different opinions and
and science makes progress when people

4816
01:37:50,790 --> 01:37:50,800
and science makes progress when people
 

4817
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:52,470
and science makes progress when people
disagree and they come up with an answer

4818
01:37:52,470 --> 01:37:52,480
disagree and they come up with an answer
 

4819
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:54,629
disagree and they come up with an answer
and you know a consensus forms right and

4820
01:37:54,629 --> 01:37:54,639
and you know a consensus forms right and
 

4821
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:56,990
and you know a consensus forms right and
it's true in all democracies around the

4822
01:37:56,990 --> 01:37:57,000
it's true in all democracies around the
 

4823
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,830
it's true in all democracies around the
world so there is a

4824
01:37:59,830 --> 01:37:59,840
world so there is a
 

4825
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:03,750
world so there is a
future which is already happening where

4826
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:03,760
future which is already happening where
 

4827
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:06,229
future which is already happening where
every single one of our interaction with

4828
01:38:06,229 --> 01:38:06,239
every single one of our interaction with
 

4829
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:09,229
every single one of our interaction with
the digital world will be mediated by ai

4830
01:38:09,229 --> 01:38:09,239
the digital world will be mediated by ai
 

4831
01:38:09,239 --> 01:38:12,990
the digital world will be mediated by ai
ai systems AI assistants right we're

4832
01:38:12,990 --> 01:38:13,000
ai systems AI assistants right we're
 

4833
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:14,910
ai systems AI assistants right we're
going to have smart glasses you can

4834
01:38:14,910 --> 01:38:14,920
going to have smart glasses you can
 

4835
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:18,189
going to have smart glasses you can
already buy them from MAA the ran MAA

4836
01:38:18,189 --> 01:38:18,199
already buy them from MAA the ran MAA
 

4837
01:38:18,199 --> 01:38:20,550
already buy them from MAA the ran MAA
where um you know you can talk to them

4838
01:38:20,550 --> 01:38:20,560
where um you know you can talk to them
 

4839
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:22,430
where um you know you can talk to them
and they are connected with an llm and

4840
01:38:22,430 --> 01:38:22,440
and they are connected with an llm and
 

4841
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:24,790
and they are connected with an llm and
you can get answers on any question you

4842
01:38:24,790 --> 01:38:24,800
you can get answers on any question you
 

4843
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:28,669
you can get answers on any question you
have or you can be looking at a monument

4844
01:38:28,669 --> 01:38:28,679
have or you can be looking at a monument
 

4845
01:38:28,679 --> 01:38:30,629
have or you can be looking at a monument
and there is a camera in the in the

4846
01:38:30,629 --> 01:38:30,639
and there is a camera in the in the
 

4847
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:32,589
and there is a camera in the in the
system that in in the glasses you can

4848
01:38:32,589 --> 01:38:32,599
system that in in the glasses you can
 

4849
01:38:32,599 --> 01:38:34,030
system that in in the glasses you can
ask it like can what can you tell me

4850
01:38:34,030 --> 01:38:34,040
ask it like can what can you tell me
 

4851
01:38:34,040 --> 01:38:36,310
ask it like can what can you tell me
about this uh building or this Monument

4852
01:38:36,310 --> 01:38:36,320
about this uh building or this Monument
 

4853
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:38,390
about this uh building or this Monument
you can be looking at a menu in a

4854
01:38:38,390 --> 01:38:38,400
you can be looking at a menu in a
 

4855
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:39,709
you can be looking at a menu in a
foreign language and I thing will

4856
01:38:39,709 --> 01:38:39,719
foreign language and I thing will
 

4857
01:38:39,719 --> 01:38:41,870
foreign language and I thing will
translate it for you or we can do real

4858
01:38:41,870 --> 01:38:41,880
translate it for you or we can do real
 

4859
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:44,189
translate it for you or we can do real
time translation if we speak different

4860
01:38:44,189 --> 01:38:44,199
time translation if we speak different
 

4861
01:38:44,199 --> 01:38:47,270
time translation if we speak different
languages so a lot of our interactions

4862
01:38:47,270 --> 01:38:47,280
languages so a lot of our interactions
 

4863
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:48,550
languages so a lot of our interactions
with the digital world are going to be

4864
01:38:48,550 --> 01:38:48,560
with the digital world are going to be
 

4865
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:50,270
with the digital world are going to be

build a system that allows a customer to
just just ask a question about any about

just just ask a question about any about
 

5041
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,589
just just ask a question about any about

need to train on their proprietary data
 

5045
01:42:39,679 --> 01:42:42,709

within meta it's called metam and it's

5048
01:42:44,990 --> 01:42:45,000
within meta it's called metam and it's

about the the company U very useful a

5054
01:42:53,310 --> 01:42:53,320
about the the company U very useful a
 

5055
01:42:53,320 --> 01:42:55,270

lot of companies want this right a lot

5056
01:42:55,270 --> 01:42:55,280
lot of companies want this right a lot
 

5057
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:57,070
lot of companies want this right a lot
of companies want this not just for

5058
01:42:57,070 --> 01:42:57,080
of companies want this not just for
 

5059
01:42:57,080 --> 01:42:58,390
of companies want this not just for
their employees but also for their

5060
01:42:58,390 --> 01:42:58,400
their employees but also for their

so the only way you're going to have an

5064
01:43:02,830 --> 01:43:02,840
so the only way you're going to have an
 

5065
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:05,030
so the only way you're going to have an
AI industry the only way you're going to

5066
01:43:05,030 --> 01:43:05,040
AI industry the only way you're going to
 

5067
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:07,589
AI industry the only way you're going to
have ai systems that are not uniquely

5068
01:43:07,589 --> 01:43:07,599
have ai systems that are not uniquely
 

5069
01:43:07,599 --> 01:43:09,750
have ai systems that are not uniquely
biased is if you have open source

5070
01:43:09,750 --> 01:43:09,760
biased is if you have open source
 

5071
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:13,189
biased is if you have open source
platforms on top of which uh any group

5072
01:43:13,189 --> 01:43:13,199
platforms on top of which uh any group
 

5073
01:43:13,199 --> 01:43:17,229
platforms on top of which uh any group
Can U build specialized systems

5074
01:43:17,229 --> 01:43:17,239
Can U build specialized systems
 

5075
01:43:17,239 --> 01:43:21,629
Can U build specialized systems
so the the direction of of inevitable

5076
01:43:21,629 --> 01:43:21,639
so the the direction of of inevitable
 

5077
01:43:21,639 --> 01:43:24,310
so the the direction of of inevitable
direction of history is that the vast

5078
01:43:24,310 --> 01:43:24,320
direction of history is that the vast
 

5079
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:26,669
direction of history is that the vast
majority of AI systems will be built on

5080
01:43:26,669 --> 01:43:26,679
majority of AI systems will be built on
 

5081
01:43:26,679 --> 01:43:28,830
majority of AI systems will be built on
top of Open Source platforms so that's a

5082
01:43:28,830 --> 01:43:28,840
top of Open Source platforms so that's a
 

5083
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:32,109
top of Open Source platforms so that's a
beautiful Vision so meaning

5084
01:43:32,109 --> 01:43:32,119

possible
 

5095
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:51,790
possible
basically can meta afford to do that no

5096
01:43:51,790 --> 01:43:51,800
basically can meta afford to do that no
 

5097
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:53,830
basically can meta afford to do that no
so I don't know if you you know this but

5098
01:43:53,830 --> 01:43:53,840
so I don't know if you you know this but
 

5099
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:55,350
so I don't know if you you know this but
companies are supposed to make money

5100
01:43:55,350 --> 01:43:55,360
companies are supposed to make money
 

5101
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:59,310
companies are supposed to make money
somehow and uh open source is is is like

01:43:59,310 --> 01:43:59,320
somehow and uh open source is is is like
 

5103
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:01,750
somehow and uh open source is is is like
giving away I don't know Mark made a

h100s yeah the the math of that is just
 

5115
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:17,589
h100s yeah the the math of that is just
for the gpus that's 100

5116
01:44:17,589 --> 01:44:17,599
for the gpus that's 100

guy but how do you make money on that so

5122
01:44:27,790 --> 01:44:27,800
guy but how do you make money on that so
 

5123
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:29,109
guy but how do you make money on that so
the division you payt is a really

5124
01:44:29,109 --> 01:44:29,119
the division you payt is a really
 

5125
01:44:29,119 --> 01:44:31,790
the division you payt is a really
powerful one but how is it possible to

5126
01:44:31,790 --> 01:44:31,800
powerful one but how is it possible to
 

5127
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:34,830
powerful one but how is it possible to
make money okay so you have several

5128
01:44:34,830 --> 01:44:34,840
make money okay so you have several
 

5129
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:37,430
make money okay so you have several
business models right the business model

5130
01:44:37,430 --> 01:44:37,440
business models right the business model
 

5131
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:39,669
business models right the business model
that uh MAA is built

5132
01:44:39,669 --> 01:44:39,679
that uh MAA is built
 

5133
01:44:39,679 --> 01:44:41,229
that uh MAA is built
around

5134
01:44:41,229 --> 01:44:41,239
around
 

5135
01:44:41,239 --> 01:44:44,189
around
is um youer a

5136
01:44:44,189 --> 01:44:44,199
is um youer a
 

5137
01:44:44,199 --> 01:44:47,750
is um youer a
service and the the financing of that

5138
01:44:47,750 --> 01:44:47,760
service and the the financing of that
 

5139
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:50,990
service and the the financing of that
service is uh either through ads or

5140
01:44:50,990 --> 01:44:51,000
service is uh either through ads or
 

5141
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:52,910
service is uh either through ads or
through business customers so for

5142
01:44:52,910 --> 01:44:52,920
through business customers so for
 

5143
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:55,910
through business customers so for
example if you have an llm that uh you

5144
01:44:55,910 --> 01:44:55,920
example if you have an llm that uh you
 

5145
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:59,629
example if you have an llm that uh you
know can help a mom and pop pizza place

5146
01:44:59,629 --> 01:44:59,639
know can help a mom and pop pizza place
 

5147
01:44:59,639 --> 01:45:01,709
know can help a mom and pop pizza place
um by you know talking to their

5148
01:45:01,709 --> 01:45:01,719
um by you know talking to their
 

5149
01:45:01,719 --> 01:45:03,910
um by you know talking to their
customers through WhatsApp and so the

5150
01:45:03,910 --> 01:45:03,920
customers through WhatsApp and so the
 

5151
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:06,790
customers through WhatsApp and so the
customers can just order a pizza and the

5152
01:45:06,790 --> 01:45:06,800
customers can just order a pizza and the
 

5153
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:08,589
customers can just order a pizza and the
system will just you know ask them like

5154
01:45:08,589 --> 01:45:08,599
system will just you know ask them like
 

5155
01:45:08,599 --> 01:45:10,070
system will just you know ask them like
what topping do you want or what sites

5156
01:45:10,070 --> 01:45:10,080
what topping do you want or what sites
 

5157
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:13,149
what topping do you want or what sites
blah blah blah um the business will pay

5158
01:45:13,149 --> 01:45:13,159
blah blah blah um the business will pay
 

5159
01:45:13,159 --> 01:45:15,270
blah blah blah um the business will pay
for that okay that's a

5160
01:45:15,270 --> 01:45:15,280
for that okay that's a
 

5161
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:18,310
for that okay that's a
model

5162
01:45:18,310 --> 01:45:18,320

 

5163
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:21,270

um and otherwise you know if it's a

5164
01:45:21,270 --> 01:45:21,280
um and otherwise you know if it's a
 

5165
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:23,350
um and otherwise you know if it's a
system that is on the more kind of

5166
01:45:23,350 --> 01:45:23,360
system that is on the more kind of
 

5167
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:25,709
system that is on the more kind of
classical Services it can be uh ad

5168
01:45:25,709 --> 01:45:25,719
classical Services it can be uh ad
 

5169
01:45:25,719 --> 01:45:27,589
classical Services it can be uh ad
supported or you know there's several

5170
01:45:27,589 --> 01:45:27,599
supported or you know there's several
 

5171
01:45:27,599 --> 01:45:29,270
supported or you know there's several
models but the point

5172
01:45:29,270 --> 01:45:29,280
models but the point
 

5173
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:33,189
models but the point
is uh if you have a big enough um

5174
01:45:33,189 --> 01:45:33,199
is uh if you have a big enough um
 

5175
01:45:33,199 --> 01:45:35,149
is uh if you have a big enough um
potential customer base and you need to

5176
01:45:35,149 --> 01:45:35,159
potential customer base and you need to
 

5177
01:45:35,159 --> 01:45:36,350
potential customer base and you need to
build that

5178
01:45:36,350 --> 01:45:36,360
build that
 

5179
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:38,990
build that
system anyway for

5180
01:45:38,990 --> 01:45:39,000
system anyway for
 

5181
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,470
system anyway for
them it doesn't hurt you to actually

5182
01:45:41,470 --> 01:45:41,480
them it doesn't hurt you to actually
 

5183
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:43,589
them it doesn't hurt you to actually
distribute it in open source again I'm

5184
01:45:43,589 --> 01:45:43,599
distribute it in open source again I'm
 

5185
01:45:43,599 --> 01:45:46,629
distribute it in open source again I'm
no business guy but if you release the

5186
01:45:46,629 --> 01:45:46,639
no business guy but if you release the
 

5187
01:45:46,639 --> 01:45:49,109
no business guy but if you release the
open source model then other people can

5188
01:45:49,109 --> 01:45:49,119
open source model then other people can
 

5189
01:45:49,119 --> 01:45:51,149
open source model then other people can
do the same kind of

5190
01:45:51,149 --> 01:45:51,159
do the same kind of
 

5191
01:45:51,159 --> 01:45:54,550
do the same kind of
task and compete on it basically provide

5192
01:45:54,550 --> 01:45:54,560
task and compete on it basically provide
 

5193
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:57,750
task and compete on it basically provide
fine-tune models for businesses the is

5194
01:45:57,750 --> 01:45:57,760
fine-tune models for businesses the is
 

5195
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:59,950
fine-tune models for businesses the is
the bet that meta is making by the way

5196
01:45:59,950 --> 01:45:59,960
the bet that meta is making by the way
 

5197
01:45:59,960 --> 01:46:02,149
the bet that meta is making by the way
I'm a huge fan of all this but is is the

5198
01:46:02,149 --> 01:46:02,159
I'm a huge fan of all this but is is the
 

5199
01:46:02,159 --> 01:46:04,070
I'm a huge fan of all this but is is the
bet that meta is making is like we'll do

5200
01:46:04,070 --> 01:46:04,080
bet that meta is making is like we'll do
 

5201
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:07,229
bet that meta is making is like we'll do
a better job of it well no the the bet

5202
01:46:07,229 --> 01:46:07,239
a better job of it well no the the bet
 

5203
01:46:07,239 --> 01:46:10,270
a better job of it well no the the bet
is is more we have we already have a

5204
01:46:10,270 --> 01:46:10,280
is is more we have we already have a
 

5205
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:13,390
is is more we have we already have a
huge user base and customer base ah

5206
01:46:13,390 --> 01:46:13,400
huge user base and customer base ah
 

5207
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:14,629
huge user base and customer base ah
right right so it's going to be useful

5208
01:46:14,629 --> 01:46:14,639
right right so it's going to be useful
 

5209
01:46:14,639 --> 01:46:16,830
right right so it's going to be useful
to them whatever we offer them is going

5210
01:46:16,830 --> 01:46:16,840
to them whatever we offer them is going
 

5211
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:19,270
to them whatever we offer them is going
to be useful and there is a way to

5212
01:46:19,270 --> 01:46:19,280
to be useful and there is a way to
 

5213
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:21,470
to be useful and there is a way to
derive revenue from this

5214
01:46:21,470 --> 01:46:21,480
derive revenue from this
 

5215
01:46:21,480 --> 01:46:25,430
derive revenue from this
uh and it doesn't hurt that you know we

5216
01:46:25,430 --> 01:46:25,440
uh and it doesn't hurt that you know we
 

5217
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:26,790
uh and it doesn't hurt that you know we
provide that

5218
01:46:26,790 --> 01:46:26,800
provide that
 

5219
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:29,310
provide that
system or the Bas the base model right

5220
01:46:29,310 --> 01:46:29,320
system or the Bas the base model right
 

5221
01:46:29,320 --> 01:46:32,550
system or the Bas the base model right
the foundation model uh in open source

5222
01:46:32,550 --> 01:46:32,560
the foundation model uh in open source
 

5223
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:34,669
the foundation model uh in open source
for others to build applications on top

5224
01:46:34,669 --> 01:46:34,679
for others to build applications on top
 

5225
01:46:34,679 --> 01:46:36,790
for others to build applications on top
of it too if those applications are not

5226
01:46:36,790 --> 01:46:36,800
of it too if those applications are not
 

5227
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:38,430
of it too if those applications are not
to be useful for our customers we can

5228
01:46:38,430 --> 01:46:38,440
to be useful for our customers we can
 

5229
01:46:38,440 --> 01:46:42,709
to be useful for our customers we can
just buy it from them um uh it could be

5230
01:46:42,709 --> 01:46:42,719
just buy it from them um uh it could be
 

5231
01:46:42,719 --> 01:46:44,310
just buy it from them um uh it could be
that they will improve the platform in

progress to make the system available to
 

5247
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:05,470
progress to make the system available to
a sort of a a wide community of people

5248

criticism that Gemini is getting is that

5266
01:47:29,350 --> 01:47:29,360
criticism that Gemini is getting is that
 

5267
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:31,310
criticism that Gemini is getting is that
as you point out on the west coast just

5268
01:47:31,310 --> 01:47:31,320
as you point out on the west coast just
 

5269
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:33,709
as you point out on the west coast just
to just to clarify we're currently in

5270
01:47:33,709 --> 01:47:33,719
to just to clarify we're currently in
 

5271
01:47:33,719 --> 01:47:36,149
to just to clarify we're currently in
the east coast where I would suppose

5272
01:47:36,149 --> 01:47:36,159
the east coast where I would suppose
 

5273
01:47:36,159 --> 01:47:38,390
the east coast where I would suppose
meta AI headquarters would

5274
01:47:38,390 --> 01:47:38,400
meta AI headquarters would
 

5275
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:41,910
meta AI headquarters would
be so there uh strong words about the

5276
01:47:41,910 --> 01:47:41,920
be so there uh strong words about the
 

5277
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:44,950
be so there uh strong words about the
West Coast but uh I guess the issue that

5278
01:47:44,950 --> 01:47:44,960
West Coast but uh I guess the issue that
 

5279
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:48,070
West Coast but uh I guess the issue that
happens is I think it's fair to say that

5280
01:47:48,070 --> 01:47:48,080
happens is I think it's fair to say that
 

5281
01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:51,350
happens is I think it's fair to say that
most tech people have

5282
01:47:51,350 --> 01:47:51,360
most tech people have
 

5283
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:53,030
most tech people have
a political affiliation with the left

5284
01:47:53,030 --> 01:47:53,040
a political affiliation with the left
 

5285
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:56,270
a political affiliation with the left
wing they're they lean left and so the

5286
01:47:56,270 --> 01:47:56,280
wing they're they lean left and so the
 

5287
01:47:56,280 --> 01:47:57,709
wing they're they lean left and so the
problem that people are criticizing

5288
01:47:57,709 --> 01:47:57,719
problem that people are criticizing
 

5289
01:47:57,719 --> 01:47:59,990
problem that people are criticizing

push it in one way one set of people are

5348
01:49:12,910 --> 01:49:12,920
push it in one way one set of people are
 

5349
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:14,910
push it in one way one set of people are
going to see it as biased and then you

5350
01:49:14,910 --> 01:49:14,920
going to see it as biased and then you
 

5351
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:16,310
going to see it as biased and then you
push it the other way and another set of

5352
01:49:16,310 --> 01:49:16,320
push it the other way and another set of
 

5353
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:18,589
push it the other way and another set of
people is going to see it that's biased

5354
01:49:18,589 --> 01:49:18,599
people is going to see it that's biased
 

5355
01:49:18,599 --> 01:49:20,189
people is going to see it that's biased
and then in addition to this there's the

5356
01:49:20,189 --> 01:49:20,199
and then in addition to this there's the
 

5357
01:49:20,199 --> 01:49:22,870
and then in addition to this there's the
issue of if you push the system perhaps

5358
01:49:22,870 --> 01:49:22,880
issue of if you push the system perhaps
 

5359
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:24,310
issue of if you push the system perhaps
a little too far in One Direction it's

5360
01:49:24,310 --> 01:49:24,320
a little too far in One Direction it's
 

5361
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:25,910
a little too far in One Direction it's
going to be non-factual right you're

5362
01:49:25,910 --> 01:49:25,920
going to be non-factual right you're
 

5363
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:28,870
going to be non-factual right you're
going to have you know you know black

5364
01:49:28,870 --> 01:49:28,880
going to have you know you know black
 

5365
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:32,109
going to have you know you know black
Nazi uh soldiers in the we should we

5366
01:49:32,109 --> 01:49:32,119
Nazi uh soldiers in the we should we
 

5367
01:49:32,119 --> 01:49:35,430
Nazi uh soldiers in the we should we
should mention image generation of of uh

5368
01:49:35,430 --> 01:49:35,440
should mention image generation of of uh
 

5369
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:37,510
should mention image generation of of uh
black Nazi soldiers which is not

5370
01:49:37,510 --> 01:49:37,520
black Nazi soldiers which is not
 

5371
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:39,990
black Nazi soldiers which is not
factually accurate right and can be

5372
01:49:39,990 --> 01:49:40,000
factually accurate right and can be
 

5373
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,310
factually accurate right and can be
offensive for some people as well right

5374
01:49:42,310 --> 01:49:42,320
offensive for some people as well right
 

5375
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:43,870
offensive for some people as well right
so

5376
01:49:43,870 --> 01:49:43,880
so
 

5377
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:46,149
so
uh so you know it's going to be

5378
01:49:46,149 --> 01:49:46,159
uh so you know it's going to be
 

5379
01:49:46,159 --> 01:49:47,790
uh so you know it's going to be
impossible to kind of produce systems

5380
01:49:47,790 --> 01:49:47,800
impossible to kind of produce systems
 

5381
01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:49,870
impossible to kind of produce systems
that are unbiased for everyone so the

5382
01:49:49,870 --> 01:49:49,880
that are unbiased for everyone so the
 

5383
01:49:49,880 --> 01:49:52,990
that are unbiased for everyone so the

01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:25,229
second they want to preserve their
business so um it's essentially

5496
01:52:25,229 --> 01:52:25,239
business so um it's essentially
 

5497
01:52:25,239 --> 01:52:26,990
business so um it's essentially
impossible for systems like this that

5498
01:52:26,990 --> 01:52:27,000
impossible for systems like this that
 

5499
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:30,270
impossible for systems like this that
can inevitably formulate political

5500
01:52:30,270 --> 01:52:30,280
can inevitably formulate political
 

5501
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:32,189
can inevitably formulate political
opinions and you know opinions about

5502
01:52:32,189 --> 01:52:32,199
opinions and you know opinions about
 

5503
01:52:32,199 --> 01:52:33,750
opinions and you know opinions about
various things that may be political or

5504
01:52:33,750 --> 01:52:33,760
various things that may be political or
 

5505
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:36,149
various things that may be political or
not but that people may disagree about

5506
01:52:36,149 --> 01:52:36,159
not but that people may disagree about
 

5507
01:52:36,159 --> 01:52:40,430
not but that people may disagree about
about you know moral issues and you know

5508
01:52:40,430 --> 01:52:40,440
about you know moral issues and you know
 

5509
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:42,950
about you know moral issues and you know
um things about like questions about

5510
01:52:42,950 --> 01:52:42,960
um things about like questions about
 

5511
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:44,589
um things about like questions about
religion and things like that right or

5512
01:52:44,589 --> 01:52:44,599
religion and things like that right or
 

5513
01:52:44,599 --> 01:52:47,189
religion and things like that right or
or cultural issues that people from

5514
01:52:47,189 --> 01:52:47,199
or cultural issues that people from
 

5515
01:52:47,199 --> 01:52:48,430
or cultural issues that people from
different communities would disagree

5516
01:52:48,430 --> 01:52:48,440
different communities would disagree
 

5517
01:52:48,440 --> 01:52:50,390
different communities would disagree
with in the first place um so there's

5518
01:52:50,390 --> 01:52:50,400
with in the first place um so there's
 

5519
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:52,069
with in the first place um so there's
only kind of a relatively small number

5520
01:52:52,069 --> 01:52:52,079
only kind of a relatively small number
 

5521
01:52:52,079 --> 01:52:53,430
only kind of a relatively small number
of things that people

5522
01:52:53,430 --> 01:52:53,440
of things that people
 

5523
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:57,229
of things that people
will uh sort of agree on you know basic

5524
01:52:57,229 --> 01:52:57,239
will uh sort of agree on you know basic
 

5525
01:52:57,239 --> 01:52:59,430
will uh sort of agree on you know basic
principles but beyond that if you if you

5526
01:52:59,430 --> 01:52:59,440
principles but beyond that if you if you
 

5527
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:01,910
principles but beyond that if you if you
want those systems to be useful they

5528
01:53:01,910 --> 01:53:01,920
want those systems to be useful they
 

5529
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:05,109
want those systems to be useful they
will necessarily have to uh

5530
01:53:05,109 --> 01:53:05,119
will necessarily have to uh
 

5531
01:53:05,119 --> 01:53:08,069
will necessarily have to uh
offend a number of people

5532
01:53:08,069 --> 01:53:08,079
offend a number of people
 

5533
01:53:08,079 --> 01:53:10,470
offend a number of people
inevitably and so open source is just

5534
01:53:10,470 --> 01:53:10,480
inevitably and so open source is just
 

5535
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:12,669
inevitably and so open source is just
better and then diversity is better

5536
01:53:12,669 --> 01:53:12,679
better and then diversity is better
 

5537
01:53:12,679 --> 01:53:15,470
better and then diversity is better
right and open source enables diversity

5538
01:53:15,470 --> 01:53:15,480
right and open source enables diversity
 

5539
01:53:15,480 --> 01:53:16,790
right and open source enables diversity
that's right open source enables

5540
01:53:16,790 --> 01:53:16,800
that's right open source enables
 

5541
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:19,229
that's right open source enables
diversity that this can be fascinating

5542
01:53:19,229 --> 01:53:19,239
diversity that this can be fascinating
 

5543
01:53:19,239 --> 01:53:20,790
diversity that this can be fascinating
world where

5544
01:53:20,790 --> 01:53:20,800
world where
 

5545
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:22,830
world where
if it's true that the open source world

5546
01:53:22,830 --> 01:53:22,840
if it's true that the open source world
 

5547
01:53:22,840 --> 01:53:24,910
if it's true that the open source world
if meta leads the way and creates this

5548
01:53:24,910 --> 01:53:24,920
if meta leads the way and creates this
 

5549
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:26,669
if meta leads the way and creates this
kind of Open Source Foundation model

5550
01:53:26,669 --> 01:53:26,679
kind of Open Source Foundation model
 

5551
01:53:26,679 --> 01:53:28,750
kind of Open Source Foundation model
world there's going to be like

5552
01:53:28,750 --> 01:53:28,760
world there's going to be like
 

5553
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:31,629
world there's going to be like
governments will have a find new model

5554
01:53:31,629 --> 01:53:31,639
governments will have a find new model
 

5555
01:53:31,639 --> 01:53:34,629
governments will have a find new model
and yeah and and then

5556
01:53:34,629 --> 01:53:34,639
and yeah and and then
 

5557
01:53:34,639 --> 01:53:38,390
and yeah and and then
potentially uh you know people that vote

5558
01:53:38,390 --> 01:53:38,400
potentially uh you know people that vote
 

5559
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:39,950
potentially uh you know people that vote
left and right will have their own model

5560
01:53:39,950 --> 01:53:39,960
left and right will have their own model
 

5561
01:53:39,960 --> 01:53:42,069
left and right will have their own model
and preference and be able to choose and

5562
01:53:42,069 --> 01:53:42,079
and preference and be able to choose and
 

5563
01:53:42,079 --> 01:53:44,510
and preference and be able to choose and
it will potentially divide us even more

5564
01:53:44,510 --> 01:53:44,520
it will potentially divide us even more
 

5565
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:47,629
it will potentially divide us even more
but that's on us humans we get to figure

5566
01:53:47,629 --> 01:53:47,639
but that's on us humans we get to figure
 

5567
01:53:47,639 --> 01:53:50,149
but that's on us humans we get to figure
out basically the technology enables

5568
01:53:50,149 --> 01:53:50,159
out basically the technology enables
 

5569
01:53:50,159 --> 01:53:54,430
out basically the technology enables
humans to human more effectively and all

5570
01:53:54,430 --> 01:53:54,440
humans to human more effectively and all
 

5571
01:53:54,440 --> 01:53:56,430
humans to human more effectively and all
the difficult ethical questions that

5572
01:53:56,430 --> 01:53:56,440
the difficult ethical questions that
 

5573
01:53:56,440 --> 01:54:00,470
the difficult ethical questions that
humans raise will just it'll um leave it

5574
01:54:00,470 --> 01:54:00,480
humans raise will just it'll um leave it
 

5575
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:03,229
humans raise will just it'll um leave it
up to us to figure it out yeah I mean

5576
01:54:03,229 --> 01:54:03,239
up to us to figure it out yeah I mean
 

5577
01:54:03,239 --> 01:54:04,709
up to us to figure it out yeah I mean
there are some limits to what you know

5578
01:54:04,709 --> 01:54:04,719
there are some limits to what you know
 

5579
01:54:04,719 --> 01:54:06,069
there are some limits to what you know
the same way there are limits to free

5580
01:54:06,069 --> 01:54:06,079
the same way there are limits to free
 

5581
01:54:06,079 --> 01:54:08,270
the same way there are limits to free
speech there has to be some limit to the

5582
01:54:08,270 --> 01:54:08,280
speech there has to be some limit to the
 

5583
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:10,470
speech there has to be some limit to the
kind of stuff that those systems might

5584
01:54:10,470 --> 01:54:10,480
kind of stuff that those systems might
 

5585
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:11,750
kind of stuff that those systems might
be authorized

5586
01:54:11,750 --> 01:54:11,760
be authorized
 

5587
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:15,830
be authorized
to um to produce um you know some guard

5588
01:54:15,830 --> 01:54:15,840
to um to produce um you know some guard
 

5589
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:17,470
to um to produce um you know some guard
rails so I mean that's one thing I've

5590
01:54:17,470 --> 01:54:17,480
rails so I mean that's one thing I've
 

5591
01:54:17,480 --> 01:54:20,030
rails so I mean that's one thing I've
been interested in which is uh in the

5592
01:54:20,030 --> 01:54:20,040
been interested in which is uh in the
 

5593
01:54:20,040 --> 01:54:21,310
been interested in which is uh in the
type of architecture that we were

5594
01:54:21,310 --> 01:54:21,320
type of architecture that we were
 

5595
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:25,030
type of architecture that we were
discussing before where the output of a

01:54:25,030 --> 01:54:25,040
discussing before where the output of a
 

5597
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:27,910
discussing before where the output of a
system is the result of an inference to

01:54:27,910 --> 01:54:27,920
system is the result of an inference to
 

5599
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:30,669
system is the result of an inference to
satisfy an objective that objective can

5600
01:54:30,669 --> 01:54:30,679
satisfy an objective that objective can

include guard

5602
01:54:31,990 --> 01:54:32,000
include guard
 

5603
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:36,069
include guard
rails and uh we can put guard rails in

5604
01:54:36,069 --> 01:54:36,079
rails and uh we can put guard rails in
 

5605
01:54:36,079 --> 01:54:38,030
rails and uh we can put guard rails in
open source systems I mean if we

5606
01:54:38,030 --> 01:54:38,040
open source systems I mean if we
 

5607
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:39,669
open source systems I mean if we
eventually have systems that are built

5608
01:54:39,669 --> 01:54:39,679
eventually have systems that are built
 

5609
01:54:39,679 --> 01:54:42,350
eventually have systems that are built
with this blueprint uh we can put guard

5610
01:54:42,350 --> 01:54:42,360
with this blueprint uh we can put guard
 

5611
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:44,750
with this blueprint uh we can put guard
rails uh in those systems that guarantee

5612
01:54:44,750 --> 01:54:44,760
rails uh in those systems that guarantee
 

5613
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:47,790
rails uh in those systems that guarantee
that there is sort of a minimum set of

that there is sort of a minimum set of

01:54:47,800 --> 01:54:49,350
that there is sort of a minimum set of

5616
01:54:49,350 --> 01:54:49,360
guardrails that make the system non-
 

5617
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:51,430
guardrails that make the system non-
dangerous and nontoxic Etc you know

5618
01:54:51,430 --> 01:54:51,440
dangerous and nontoxic Etc you know
 

5619
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:53,350
dangerous and nontoxic Etc you know
basic things that everybody would agree

5620
01:54:53,350 --> 01:54:53,360
basic things that everybody would agree
 

5621
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:56,910
basic things that everybody would agree
on um and and then you know the the fine

5622
01:54:56,910 --> 01:54:56,920
on um and and then you know the the fine
 

5623
01:54:56,920 --> 01:54:58,629
on um and and then you know the the fine
tuning that people will add or the

5624
01:54:58,629 --> 01:54:58,639
tuning that people will add or the
 

5625
01:54:58,639 --> 01:55:00,109
tuning that people will add or the
additional guardwell that people will

01:55:00,109 --> 01:55:00,119
additional guardwell that people will
 

5627
01:55:00,119 --> 01:55:03,069
additional guardwell that people will
add will kind of cater to their um

5628
01:55:03,069 --> 01:55:03,079
add will kind of cater to their um
 

5629
01:55:03,079 --> 01:55:06,030
add will kind of cater to their um
Community whatever it is and yeah the

01:55:06,030 --> 01:55:06,040
Community whatever it is and yeah the
 

5631
01:55:06,040 --> 01:55:07,589
Community whatever it is and yeah the
fine doing will be more about the gray

5632
01:55:07,589 --> 01:55:07,599
fine doing will be more about the gray
 

5633
01:55:07,599 --> 01:55:09,870
fine doing will be more about the gray
areas of what is hate speech what is

5634
01:55:09,870 --> 01:55:09,880
areas of what is hate speech what is
 

5635
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:11,470
areas of what is hate speech what is
dangerous and all that kind of stuff I

5636
01:55:11,470 --> 01:55:11,480
dangerous and all that kind of stuff I
 

5637
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:13,629
dangerous and all that kind of stuff I
mean you've different value systems

5638
01:55:13,629 --> 01:55:13,639
mean you've different value systems
 

5639
01:55:13,639 --> 01:55:15,790
mean you've different value systems
value systems I mean like uh but still

5640
01:55:15,790 --> 01:55:15,800
value systems I mean like uh but still
 

5641
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:17,470
value systems I mean like uh but still
even with the objectives of how to build

5642
01:55:17,470 --> 01:55:17,480
even with the objectives of how to build
 

5643
01:55:17,480 --> 01:55:19,030
even with the objectives of how to build
a bioweapon for example I think

5644
01:55:19,030 --> 01:55:19,040
a bioweapon for example I think
 

5645
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:20,950
a bioweapon for example I think
something you've commented on or at

5646
01:55:20,950 --> 01:55:20,960
something you've commented on or at
 

5647
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:22,310
something you've commented on or at
least there's a

5648
01:55:22,310 --> 01:55:22,320
least there's a
 

5649
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:24,550
least there's a
paper where a collection of researchers

5650
01:55:24,550 --> 01:55:24,560
paper where a collection of researchers
 

5651
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:26,910
paper where a collection of researchers
is trying to understand the social

5652
01:55:26,910 --> 01:55:26,920
is trying to understand the social
 

5653
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:28,510
is trying to understand the social
impacts of these

5654
01:55:28,510 --> 01:55:28,520
impacts of these
 

5655
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:31,830
impacts of these
llms and I guess one threshold is nice

5656
01:55:31,830 --> 01:55:31,840
llms and I guess one threshold is nice
 

5657
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:35,109
llms and I guess one threshold is nice
is like does the llm make it any easier

5658
01:55:35,109 --> 01:55:35,119
is like does the llm make it any easier
 

5659
01:55:35,119 --> 01:55:38,470
is like does the llm make it any easier
than a than a search would like a Google

5660
01:55:38,470 --> 01:55:38,480
than a than a search would like a Google
 

5661
01:55:38,480 --> 01:55:42,589
than a than a search would like a Google
search would right so the increasing uh

5662
01:55:42,589 --> 01:55:42,599
search would right so the increasing uh
 

5663
01:55:42,599 --> 01:55:46,550
search would right so the increasing uh
number of studies on this seems to point

5664
01:55:46,550 --> 01:55:46,560
number of studies on this seems to point
 

5665
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:50,109
number of studies on this seems to point
to the fact that it doesn't help so

5666
01:55:50,109 --> 01:55:50,119
to the fact that it doesn't help so
 

5667
01:55:50,119 --> 01:55:54,390
to the fact that it doesn't help so
having an llm doesn't help you design or

5668
01:55:54,390 --> 01:55:54,400
having an llm doesn't help you design or
 

5669
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:57,149
having an llm doesn't help you design or
build a bioweapon or a chemical weapon

5670
01:55:57,149 --> 01:55:57,159
build a bioweapon or a chemical weapon
 

5671
01:55:57,159 --> 01:55:59,189
build a bioweapon or a chemical weapon
if you already have access to uh you

5672
01:55:59,189 --> 01:55:59,199
if you already have access to uh you
 

5673
01:55:59,199 --> 01:56:02,390
if you already have access to uh you
know a search engine and a library uh

5674
01:56:02,390 --> 01:56:02,400
know a search engine and a library uh
 

5675
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:03,950
know a search engine and a library uh
and and so the the S of increased

5676
01:56:03,950 --> 01:56:03,960
and and so the the S of increased
 

5677
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:05,390
and and so the the S of increased
information you get or the ease with

5678
01:56:05,390 --> 01:56:05,400
information you get or the ease with
 

5679
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:07,550
information you get or the ease with
which you get it doesn't really help you

5680
01:56:07,550 --> 01:56:07,560
which you get it doesn't really help you
 

5681
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:09,229
which you get it doesn't really help you
um that's the first thing the second

5682
01:56:09,229 --> 01:56:09,239
um that's the first thing the second
 

5683
01:56:09,239 --> 01:56:11,870
um that's the first thing the second
thing is it's one thing to have a list

5684
01:56:11,870 --> 01:56:11,880
thing is it's one thing to have a list
 

5685
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:14,790
thing is it's one thing to have a list
of instructions of how to make a

5686
01:56:14,790 --> 01:56:14,800
of instructions of how to make a
 

5687
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:16,950
of instructions of how to make a
chemical weapon for example or bioweapon

5688
01:56:16,950 --> 01:56:16,960
chemical weapon for example or bioweapon
 

5689
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:19,790
chemical weapon for example or bioweapon
it's another thing to actually build it

5690
01:56:19,790 --> 01:56:19,800
it's another thing to actually build it
 

5691
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:21,709
it's another thing to actually build it
and it's much harder than you might

5692
01:56:21,709 --> 01:56:21,719
and it's much harder than you might
 

5693
01:56:21,719 --> 01:56:23,790
and it's much harder than you might
think and then LM will not help you with

5694
01:56:23,790 --> 01:56:23,800
think and then LM will not help you with
 

5695
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:26,669
think and then LM will not help you with
that um in fact you know nobody in the

5696
01:56:26,669 --> 01:56:26,679
that um in fact you know nobody in the
 

5697
01:56:26,679 --> 01:56:28,310
that um in fact you know nobody in the
world not even like you know countries

5698
01:56:28,310 --> 01:56:28,320
world not even like you know countries
 

5699
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:31,390
world not even like you know countries
use bioweapons because most of the time

5700
01:56:31,390 --> 01:56:31,400
use bioweapons because most of the time
 

5701
01:56:31,400 --> 01:56:32,830
use bioweapons because most of the time
they have no idea how to protect their

5702
01:56:32,830 --> 01:56:32,840
they have no idea how to protect their
 

5703
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:35,870
they have no idea how to protect their
own populations against it so um so it's

5704
01:56:35,870 --> 01:56:35,880
own populations against it so um so it's
 

5705
01:56:35,880 --> 01:56:37,910
own populations against it so um so it's
too dangerous actually to kind of ever

5706
01:56:37,910 --> 01:56:37,920
too dangerous actually to kind of ever
 

5707
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:42,229
too dangerous actually to kind of ever
use um and it's in fact banned by uh

5708
01:56:42,229 --> 01:56:42,239
use um and it's in fact banned by uh
 

5709
01:56:42,239 --> 01:56:44,510
use um and it's in fact banned by uh
International treaties um chemical

5710
01:56:44,510 --> 01:56:44,520
International treaties um chemical
 

5711
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:46,229
International treaties um chemical
weapons is different it's also banned by

5712
01:56:46,229 --> 01:56:46,239
weapons is different it's also banned by
 

5713
01:56:46,239 --> 01:56:50,229
weapons is different it's also banned by
treaties U but um uh but it's the same

5714
01:56:50,229 --> 01:56:50,239
treaties U but um uh but it's the same
 

5715
01:56:50,239 --> 01:56:52,350
treaties U but um uh but it's the same
problem it's difficult to use in

5716
01:56:52,350 --> 01:56:52,360
problem it's difficult to use in
 

5717
01:56:52,360 --> 01:56:55,470
problem it's difficult to use in
situations that doesn't turn against the

5718
01:56:55,470 --> 01:56:55,480
situations that doesn't turn against the
 

5719
01:56:55,480 --> 01:56:57,510
situations that doesn't turn against the
perpetrators but we could ask you on

5720
01:56:57,510 --> 01:56:57,520
perpetrators but we could ask you on
 

5721
01:56:57,520 --> 01:57:00,430
perpetrators but we could ask you on
musk like I can I can give you a very

5722
01:57:00,430 --> 01:57:00,440
musk like I can I can give you a very
 

5723
01:57:00,440 --> 01:57:01,990
musk like I can I can give you a very
precise list of instructions of how you

5724
01:57:01,990 --> 01:57:02,000
precise list of instructions of how you
 

5725
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:05,030
precise list of instructions of how you
build a rocket engine M and even if you

5726
01:57:05,030 --> 01:57:05,040
build a rocket engine M and even if you
 

5727
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:07,069
build a rocket engine M and even if you
have a team of 50 Engineers that of re

5728
01:57:07,069 --> 01:57:07,079
have a team of 50 Engineers that of re
 

5729
01:57:07,079 --> 01:57:08,629
have a team of 50 Engineers that of re
experienc building it you're still going

5730
01:57:08,629 --> 01:57:08,639
experienc building it you're still going
 

5731
01:57:08,639 --> 01:57:10,069
experienc building it you're still going
to have to blow up a dozen of them

5732
01:57:10,069 --> 01:57:10,079
to have to blow up a dozen of them
 

5733
01:57:10,079 --> 01:57:11,470
to have to blow up a dozen of them
before you get when that

5734
01:57:11,470 --> 01:57:11,480
before you get when that
 

5735
01:57:11,480 --> 01:57:15,030
before you get when that
works um and you know it's the same with

5736
01:57:15,030 --> 01:57:15,040
works um and you know it's the same with
 

5737
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:18,470
works um and you know it's the same with
uh you know chemical weapons or biow

5738
01:57:18,470 --> 01:57:18,480
uh you know chemical weapons or biow
 

5739
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:20,470
uh you know chemical weapons or biow
weapons or things like this it requires

5740
01:57:20,470 --> 01:57:20,480
weapons or things like this it requires
 

5741
01:57:20,480 --> 01:57:22,669
weapons or things like this it requires
expertise you know in the in the real

5742
01:57:22,669 --> 01:57:22,679
expertise you know in the in the real
 

5743
01:57:22,679 --> 01:57:24,750

world that n is not going to help you

5744
01:57:24,750 --> 01:57:24,760
world that n is not going to help you
 

5745
01:57:24,760 --> 01:57:27,189
world that n is not going to help you
with and it requires even the common

5746
01:57:27,189 --> 01:57:27,199
with and it requires even the common
 

5747
01:57:27,199 --> 01:57:28,750

01:57:28,750 --> 01:57:28,760
sense expertise that we've been talking
 

5749
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:32,470
sense expertise that we've been talking
about which is how to take uh

5750
01:57:32,470 --> 01:57:32,480
about which is how to take uh
 

5751
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:34,109
about which is how to take uh
language-based instructions and

5752
01:57:34,109 --> 01:57:34,119
language-based instructions and
 

5753
01:57:34,119 --> 01:57:36,830
language-based instructions and
materialize them in the physical world

5754
01:57:36,830 --> 01:57:36,840
materialize them in the physical world
 

5755
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:39,830
materialize them in the physical world
requires a lot of knowledge that's not

5756
01:57:39,830 --> 01:57:39,840
requires a lot of knowledge that's not
 

5757
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:42,470
requires a lot of knowledge that's not
in the instructions yeah exactly a lot

5758
01:57:42,470 --> 01:57:42,480
in the instructions yeah exactly a lot
 

5759
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:44,069
in the instructions yeah exactly a lot
of biologists have posted on this

5760
01:57:44,069 --> 01:57:44,079
of biologists have posted on this
 

5761
01:57:44,079 --> 01:57:45,629
of biologists have posted on this
actually in response to those things

5762
01:57:45,629 --> 01:57:45,639
actually in response to those things
 

5763
01:57:45,639 --> 01:57:47,270
actually in response to those things
saying like do you realize how hard it

5764
01:57:47,270 --> 01:57:47,280
saying like do you realize how hard it
 

5765
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:49,470
saying like do you realize how hard it
is to actually do the the lab work I you

5766
01:57:49,470 --> 01:57:49,480
is to actually do the the lab work I you
 

5767
01:57:49,480 --> 01:57:51,109
is to actually do the the lab work I you
know this is not

5768
01:57:51,109 --> 01:57:51,119
know this is not
 

5769
01:57:51,119 --> 01:57:54,910
know this is not
trivial yeah and that's Hans Marik comes

5770
01:57:54,910 --> 01:57:54,920
trivial yeah and that's Hans Marik comes
 

5771
01:57:54,920 --> 01:57:57,430
trivial yeah and that's Hans Marik comes
comes to light once again uh just the

5772
01:57:57,430 --> 01:57:57,440
comes to light once again uh just the
 

5773
01:57:57,440 --> 01:57:59,910
comes to light once again uh just the
Linger on llama you know Mark announced

5774
01:57:59,910 --> 01:57:59,920
Linger on llama you know Mark announced
 

5775
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:01,790
Linger on llama you know Mark announced
that llama 3 is coming out eventually I

5776
01:58:01,790 --> 01:58:01,800
that llama 3 is coming out eventually I
 

5777
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:04,390
that llama 3 is coming out eventually I
don't think there's a release date but

5778
01:58:04,390 --> 01:58:04,400
don't think there's a release date but
 

5779
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:06,790
don't think there's a release date but
what what are you most excited about

01:58:06,790 --> 01:58:06,800
what what are you most excited about
 

5781
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:08,470
what what are you most excited about
first of all llama 2 that's already out

01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:41,189
are trained from video so they have some
World model maybe you know capable of

5808
01:58:41,189 --> 01:58:41,199
World model maybe you know capable of
 

5809
01:58:41,199 --> 01:58:42,709
World model maybe you know capable of
the type of reasoning and planning I was

5810
01:58:42,709 --> 01:58:42,719
the type of reasoning and planning I was
 

5811
01:58:42,719 --> 01:58:44,629
the type of reasoning and planning I was
talking about earlier like how long is

5812
01:58:44,629 --> 01:58:44,639
talking about earlier like how long is
 

5813
01:58:44,639 --> 01:58:46,510
talking about earlier like how long is
that going to take like when is the

5814
01:58:46,510 --> 01:58:46,520
that going to take like when is the
 

5815
01:58:46,520 --> 01:58:47,950
that going to take like when is the
research that is doing going in that

5816
01:58:47,950 --> 01:58:47,960
research that is doing going in that
 

5817
01:58:47,960 --> 01:58:50,830
research that is doing going in that
direction going to sort of feed into the

5818
01:58:50,830 --> 01:58:50,840
direction going to sort of feed into the
 

5819
01:58:50,840 --> 01:58:53,790
direction going to sort of feed into the
product line if you want of L I don't

5820
01:58:53,790 --> 01:58:53,800
product line if you want of L I don't
 

5821
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:55,390
product line if you want of L I don't
know I can't tell you and there's you

5822
01:58:55,390 --> 01:58:55,400
know I can't tell you and there's you
 

5823
01:58:55,400 --> 01:58:57,390
know I can't tell you and there's you
know a few breakthroughs that we have to

5824
01:58:57,390 --> 01:58:57,400
know a few breakthroughs that we have to
 

5825
01:58:57,400 --> 01:59:00,950
know a few breakthroughs that we have to
basically uh go through before we can

5826
01:59:00,950 --> 01:59:00,960
basically uh go through before we can
 

5827
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:03,669
basically uh go through before we can
get there but you'll be able to monitor

5828
01:59:03,669 --> 01:59:03,679
get there but you'll be able to monitor
 

5829
01:59:03,679 --> 01:59:06,350
get there but you'll be able to monitor
our progress because we publish our

5830
01:59:06,350 --> 01:59:06,360
our progress because we publish our
 

5831
01:59:06,360 --> 01:59:09,550
our progress because we publish our
research right so you know if last week

5832
01:59:09,550 --> 01:59:09,560
research right so you know if last week
 

5833
01:59:09,560 --> 01:59:12,430
research right so you know if last week
we published the Via work which is sort

5834
01:59:12,430 --> 01:59:12,440
we published the Via work which is sort
 

5835
01:59:12,440 --> 01:59:14,229
we published the Via work which is sort
of a first step towards Training Systems

5836
01:59:14,229 --> 01:59:14,239
of a first step towards Training Systems
 

5837
01:59:14,239 --> 01:59:17,030
of a first step towards Training Systems
from video um and then the next step is

5838
01:59:17,030 --> 01:59:17,040
from video um and then the next step is
 

5839
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:20,149
from video um and then the next step is
going to be World models based on on

5840
01:59:20,149 --> 01:59:20,159
going to be World models based on on
 

5841
01:59:20,159 --> 01:59:22,030
going to be World models based on on
kind of this type of idea training

kind of this type of idea training
 

5843
01:59:22,040 --> 01:59:24,470
kind of this type of idea training
training from video there similar work

5844
01:59:24,470 --> 01:59:24,480
training from video there similar work
 

5845
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:27,750
training from video there similar work
at at Deep Mind also and um the taking

5846
01:59:27,750 --> 01:59:27,760
at at Deep Mind also and um the taking
 

5847
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:31,709
at at Deep Mind also and um the taking
place people and also at UC brookley on

5848
01:59:31,709 --> 01:59:31,719
place people and also at UC brookley on
 

5849
01:59:31,719 --> 01:59:33,990
place people and also at UC brookley on
uh World models from video a lot of

5850
01:59:33,990 --> 01:59:34,000
uh World models from video a lot of
 

5851
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:35,510
uh World models from video a lot of
people are working on this I think a lot

5852
01:59:35,510 --> 01:59:35,520
people are working on this I think a lot
 

5853
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:38,470
people are working on this I think a lot
of good ideas are coming are appearing

5854
01:59:38,470 --> 01:59:38,480
of good ideas are coming are appearing
 

5855
01:59:38,480 --> 01:59:40,870
of good ideas are coming are appearing
my bet is that those systems are going

5856
01:59:40,870 --> 01:59:40,880
my bet is that those systems are going
 

5857
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:42,550
my bet is that those systems are going
to be Jep alike they're not going to be

5858
01:59:42,550 --> 01:59:42,560
to be Jep alike they're not going to be
 

5859
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:46,750
to be Jep alike they're not going to be
gener generative models um and uh we'll

details of how to train on that how to

5962
02:02:07,910 --> 02:02:07,920
details of how to train on that how to
 

5963
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:09,550
details of how to train on that how to
build the infrastructure and the the

5964
02:02:09,550 --> 02:02:09,560
build the infrastructure and the the
 

5965
02:02:09,560 --> 02:02:11,310
build the infrastructure and the the
hardware the cooling all of this kind of

5966
02:02:11,310 --> 02:02:11,320
hardware the cooling all of this kind of
 

5967
02:02:11,320 --> 02:02:13,669
hardware the cooling all of this kind of
stuff U or you just still the most of

5968
02:02:13,669 --> 02:02:13,679
stuff U or you just still the most of
 

5969
02:02:13,679 --> 02:02:15,589
stuff U or you just still the most of
your excitement is in the the theory

5970
02:02:15,589 --> 02:02:15,599
your excitement is in the the theory
 

5971
02:02:15,599 --> 02:02:18,109
your excitement is in the the theory
aspect of it the meaning like the

5972
02:02:18,109 --> 02:02:18,119
aspect of it the meaning like the
 

5973
02:02:18,119 --> 02:02:19,629
aspect of it the meaning like the
software

5974
02:02:19,629 --> 02:02:19,639
software
 

5975
02:02:19,639 --> 02:02:20,950
software
well I used to be a hardware guy many

5976
02:02:20,950 --> 02:02:20,960
well I used to be a hardware guy many
 

5977
02:02:20,960 --> 02:02:23,109
well I used to be a hardware guy many
years ago yes yes that's decades ago

5978
02:02:23,109 --> 02:02:23,119
years ago yes yes that's decades ago
 

5979
02:02:23,119 --> 02:02:25,629
years ago yes yes that's decades ago
Hardware has improved a little bit

5980
02:02:25,629 --> 02:02:25,639
Hardware has improved a little bit
 

5981
02:02:25,639 --> 02:02:27,990
Hardware has improved a little bit
changed a little bit yeah I mean

5982
02:02:27,990 --> 02:02:28,000
changed a little bit yeah I mean
 

5983
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:31,350
changed a little bit yeah I mean
certainly scale is necessary but not

5984
02:02:31,350 --> 02:02:31,360
certainly scale is necessary but not
 

5985
02:02:31,360 --> 02:02:33,790
certainly scale is necessary but not
sufficient absolutely so we certainly

5986
02:02:33,790 --> 02:02:33,800
sufficient absolutely so we certainly
 

5987
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:35,470
sufficient absolutely so we certainly
need competition I mean we're still far

5988
02:02:35,470 --> 02:02:35,480
need competition I mean we're still far
 

5989
02:02:35,480 --> 02:02:37,030
need competition I mean we're still far
in terms of compute

5990
02:02:37,030 --> 02:02:37,040
in terms of compute
 

5991
02:02:37,040 --> 02:02:39,310
in terms of compute
power uh from you know what we would

5992
02:02:39,310 --> 02:02:39,320
power uh from you know what we would
 

5993
02:02:39,320 --> 02:02:41,189
power uh from you know what we would
need to match the compute power of the

5994
02:02:41,189 --> 02:02:41,199
need to match the compute power of the
 

5995
02:02:41,199 --> 02:02:43,430
need to match the compute power of the
human brain um you know this may occur

5996
02:02:43,430 --> 02:02:43,440
human brain um you know this may occur
 

5997
02:02:43,440 --> 02:02:46,189
human brain um you know this may occur
in the next couple decades but um but

5998
02:02:46,189 --> 02:02:46,199
in the next couple decades but um but
 

5999
02:02:46,199 --> 02:02:48,030
in the next couple decades but um but
we're still some ways away and certainly

6000
02:02:48,030 --> 02:02:48,040
we're still some ways away and certainly
 

6001
02:02:48,040 --> 02:02:50,709
we're still some ways away and certainly
in terms of power efficiency were really

6002
02:02:50,709 --> 02:02:50,719
in terms of power efficiency were really
 

6003
02:02:50,719 --> 02:02:53,629
in terms of power efficiency were really
far um so a lot of progress to make in

6004
02:02:53,629 --> 02:02:53,639
far um so a lot of progress to make in
 

6005
02:02:53,639 --> 02:02:57,629
far um so a lot of progress to make in
uh in in in hardware and you know right

6006
02:02:57,629 --> 02:02:57,639
uh in in in hardware and you know right
 

6007
02:02:57,639 --> 02:03:00,189
uh in in in hardware and you know right
now a lot of progress is is is not I

6008
02:03:00,189 --> 02:03:00,199
now a lot of progress is is is not I
 

6009
02:03:00,199 --> 02:03:02,350
now a lot of progress is is is not I
mean there's a bit coming from Silicon

6010
02:03:02,350 --> 02:03:02,360
mean there's a bit coming from Silicon
 

6011
02:03:02,360 --> 02:03:04,550
mean there's a bit coming from Silicon
technology but a lot of it coming from

6012
02:03:04,550 --> 02:03:04,560
technology but a lot of it coming from
 

6013
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:06,910
technology but a lot of it coming from
architectural Innovation and quite a bit

6014
02:03:06,910 --> 02:03:06,920
architectural Innovation and quite a bit
 

6015
02:03:06,920 --> 02:03:10,109
architectural Innovation and quite a bit
coming from uh like more efficient ways

6016
02:03:10,109 --> 02:03:10,119
coming from uh like more efficient ways
 

6017
02:03:10,119 --> 02:03:11,629
coming from uh like more efficient ways
of you know implementing the

6018
02:03:11,629 --> 02:03:11,639
of you know implementing the
 

6019
02:03:11,639 --> 02:03:13,589
of you know implementing the
architectures that have become popular

6020
02:03:13,589 --> 02:03:13,599
architectures that have become popular
 

6021
02:03:13,599 --> 02:03:16,390
architectures that have become popular
basically combination of Transformers

6022
02:03:16,390 --> 02:03:16,400
basically combination of Transformers
 

6023
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:19,910
basically combination of Transformers
and cets right and uh so you know

6024
02:03:19,910 --> 02:03:19,920
and cets right and uh so you know
 

6025
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:23,470
and cets right and uh so you know
there's still some ways to go

6026
02:03:23,470 --> 02:03:23,480
there's still some ways to go
 

6027
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:27,589
there's still some ways to go
until uh we're going to saturate we're

6028
02:03:27,589 --> 02:03:27,599
until uh we're going to saturate we're
 

6029
02:03:27,599 --> 02:03:29,270
until uh we're going to saturate we're
going to have to come up with like new

6030
02:03:29,270 --> 02:03:29,280
going to have to come up with like new
 

6031
02:03:29,280 --> 02:03:30,910
going to have to come up with like new
new principles new fabrication

6032
02:03:30,910 --> 02:03:30,920
new principles new fabrication
 

6033
02:03:30,920 --> 02:03:34,470

technology new uh basic
 

6035
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:37,350
technology new uh basic
components um perhaps you know based on

6036
02:03:37,350 --> 02:03:37,360
components um perhaps you know based on
 

6037
02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:39,390
components um perhaps you know based on
sort of different principles than those

6038
02:03:39,390 --> 02:03:39,400
sort of different principles than those
 

6039
02:03:39,400 --> 02:03:42,510
sort of different principles than those
classical digital semas interesting so

6040
02:03:42,510 --> 02:03:42,520
classical digital semas interesting so
 

6041
02:03:42,520 --> 02:03:43,229
classical digital semas interesting so
you

6042
02:03:43,229 --> 02:03:43,239
you
 

6043
02:03:43,239 --> 02:03:48,950

6054
02:04:02,669 --> 02:04:02,679
know comput the power consumption a GPU
 

6055
02:04:02,679 --> 02:04:05,790

you know turn on a machine and then we
 

6095
02:04:54,239 --> 02:04:56,510
you know turn on a machine and then we
have a gii that's just not going to

6096
02:04:56,510 --> 02:04:56,520
have a gii that's just not going to

yeah before we get them to the scale and

6108
02:05:12,350 --> 02:05:12,360
yeah before we get them to the scale and
 

6109
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:13,870
yeah before we get them to the scale and
performance that we observe in humans

6110
02:05:13,870 --> 02:05:13,880
performance that we observe in humans
 

6111
02:05:13,880 --> 02:05:15,589
performance that we observe in humans
it's going to take quite a while it's

6112
02:05:15,589 --> 02:05:15,599
it's going to take quite a while it's
 

6113
02:05:15,599 --> 02:05:19,510
it's going to take quite a while it's
not going to happen in one day um uh are

6114
02:05:19,510 --> 02:05:19,520
not going to happen in one day um uh are
 

6115
02:05:19,520 --> 02:05:22,270
not going to happen in one day um uh are
we going to get systems that can uh have

we going to get systems that can uh have
 

6117
02:05:22,280 --> 02:05:24,629
we going to get systems that can uh have
large amount of associative memory so

6118
02:05:24,629 --> 02:05:24,639
large amount of associative memory so
 

6119
02:05:24,639 --> 02:05:26,870
large amount of associative memory so
they can they can remember stuff yeah

6120
02:05:26,870 --> 02:05:26,880
they can they can remember stuff yeah
 

6121
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:28,149
they can they can remember stuff yeah
but same it's not going to happen

6122
02:05:28,149 --> 02:05:28,159
but same it's not going to happen
 

6123
02:05:28,159 --> 02:05:29,990
but same it's not going to happen
tomorrow I mean there is some basic

6124
02:05:29,990 --> 02:05:30,000
tomorrow I mean there is some basic
 

6125
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:31,510
tomorrow I mean there is some basic
techniques that need to be developed we

6126
02:05:31,510 --> 02:05:31,520
techniques that need to be developed we
 

6127
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:33,669
techniques that need to be developed we
have a lot of them but like you know to

6128
02:05:33,669 --> 02:05:33,679
have a lot of them but like you know to
 

6129
02:05:33,679 --> 02:05:35,629
have a lot of them but like you know to
get this to work together with full

6130
02:05:35,629 --> 02:05:35,639
get this to work together with full
 

6131
02:05:35,639 --> 02:05:37,310
get this to work together with full
system is another story how we going to

6132
02:05:37,310 --> 02:05:37,320
system is another story how we going to
 

6133
02:05:37,320 --> 02:05:39,189
system is another story how we going to
have system that can reason and plan

6134
02:05:39,189 --> 02:05:39,199
have system that can reason and plan
 

6135
02:05:39,199 --> 02:05:41,750
have system that can reason and plan
perhaps along the lines of the objective

6136
02:05:41,750 --> 02:05:41,760
perhaps along the lines of the objective
 

6137
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:43,709
perhaps along the lines of the objective
driven AI architectures that I I

6138
02:05:43,709 --> 02:05:43,719
driven AI architectures that I I
 

6139
02:05:43,719 --> 02:05:45,870
driven AI architectures that I I
described before yeah but like before we

6140
02:05:45,870 --> 02:05:45,880
described before yeah but like before we
 

6141
02:05:45,880 --> 02:05:47,510
described before yeah but like before we
get this to work you know properly it's

6142
02:05:47,510 --> 02:05:47,520
get this to work you know properly it's
 

6143
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:49,229
get this to work you know properly it's
going to take a while so

6144
02:05:49,229 --> 02:05:49,239
going to take a while so
 

6145
02:05:49,239 --> 02:05:50,510
going to take a while so
and before we get all those things to

6146
02:05:50,510 --> 02:05:50,520
and before we get all those things to
 

6147
02:05:50,520 --> 02:05:52,709
and before we get all those things to
work together and then on top of this

6148
02:05:52,709 --> 02:05:52,719
work together and then on top of this
 

6149
02:05:52,719 --> 02:05:54,109
work together and then on top of this
have systems that can learn like

6150
02:05:54,109 --> 02:05:54,119
have systems that can learn like
 

6151
02:05:54,119 --> 02:05:55,750
have systems that can learn like

6159
02:06:01,800 --> 02:06:05,589

brain can um you know all of this is

6160
02:06:05,589 --> 02:06:05,599
brain can um you know all of this is
 

6161
02:06:05,599 --> 02:06:07,629
brain can um you know all of this is
going to take you know at least a decade

6162
02:06:07,629 --> 02:06:07,639
going to take you know at least a decade
 

6163
02:06:07,639 --> 02:06:10,149
going to take you know at least a decade
and probably much more because there are

6164
02:06:10,149 --> 02:06:10,159
and probably much more because there are
 

6165
02:06:10,159 --> 02:06:12,149
and probably much more because there are
a lot of problems that we're not seeing

6166
02:06:12,149 --> 02:06:12,159
a lot of problems that we're not seeing
 

6167
02:06:12,159 --> 02:06:15,310
a lot of problems that we're not seeing
right now we have not encountered and so

6168
02:06:15,310 --> 02:06:15,320
right now we have not encountered and so
 

6169
02:06:15,320 --> 02:06:16,629
right now we have not encountered and so
we don't know if there is a easy

6170
02:06:16,629 --> 02:06:16,639
we don't know if there is a easy
 

6171
02:06:16,639 --> 02:06:19,430
we don't know if there is a easy
solution within this framework

6172
02:06:19,430 --> 02:06:19,440
solution within this framework
 

6173
02:06:19,440 --> 02:06:22,669
solution within this framework
um so you know it's it's not just around

6174
02:06:22,669 --> 02:06:22,679
um so you know it's it's not just around
 

6175
02:06:22,679 --> 02:06:24,510
um so you know it's it's not just around
the corner I mean I've I've been hearing

6176
02:06:24,510 --> 02:06:24,520
the corner I mean I've I've been hearing
 

6177
02:06:24,520 --> 02:06:27,990
the corner I mean I've I've been hearing
people for the last 12 15 years claiming

6178
02:06:27,990 --> 02:06:28,000
people for the last 12 15 years claiming
 

6179
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:29,510
people for the last 12 15 years claiming
that you know edgi is just around the

02:06:29,510 --> 02:06:29,520
that you know edgi is just around the
 

6181

02:06:33,470 --> 02:06:33,480
and I knew they were wrong when they
 

6185
02:06:33,480 --> 02:06:35,510
and I knew they were wrong when they
were saying it I call their

02:06:35,510 --> 02:06:35,520
were saying it I call their

02:07:48,840 --> 02:07:52,109
relatively kind of uniform form right
right uh but it only measures one type

6242
02:07:52,109 --> 02:07:52,119
right uh but it only measures one type
 

6243
02:07:52,119 --> 02:07:54,709
right uh but it only measures one type
of uh ability that you know may be

and uh but then if you talking about

6250
02:08:00,629 --> 02:08:00,639
and uh but then if you talking about
 

6251
02:08:00,639 --> 02:08:04,069
and uh but then if you talking about
other intelligent entities for which

6252

other intelligent entities for which
 

6253
02:08:04,079 --> 02:08:06,350
other intelligent entities for which
the you know the the basic things that

6254
02:08:06,350 --> 02:08:06,360
the you know the the basic things that
 

6255
02:08:06,360 --> 02:08:07,950
the you know the the basic things that
are easy to them is very

6256
02:08:07,950 --> 02:08:07,960
are easy to them is very
 

6257
02:08:07,960 --> 02:08:11,390
are easy to them is very
different then it doesn't mean anything

6258
02:08:11,390 --> 02:08:11,400
different then it doesn't mean anything
 

6259
02:08:11,400 --> 02:08:17,109
different then it doesn't mean anything
so intelligence is a collection of

6260
02:08:17,109 --> 02:08:17,119
so intelligence is a collection of

02:08:17,119 --> 02:08:19,750
so intelligence is a collection of
skills and an ability to acquire new

the collection skills of another one and
 

6275
02:08:35,360 --> 02:08:37,270
the collection skills of another one and
because it's a multi-dimensional thing

6276
02:08:37,270 --> 02:08:37,280
because it's a multi-dimensional thing
 

6277
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:38,709
because it's a multi-dimensional thing
the set of skills is high dimensional

6278
02:08:38,709 --> 02:08:38,719
the set of skills is high dimensional
 

6279
02:08:38,719 --> 02:08:41,189
the set of skills is high dimensional
space you can't measure you can compare

6280
02:08:41,189 --> 02:08:41,199
space you can't measure you can compare
 

6281
02:08:41,199 --> 02:08:43,109
space you can't measure you can compare
you cannot compare two things as to

6282
02:08:43,109 --> 02:08:43,119
you cannot compare two things as to
 

6283
02:08:43,119 --> 02:08:44,549
you cannot compare two things as to
whether one is more intelligent than the

6284
02:08:44,549 --> 02:08:44,559
whether one is more intelligent than the
 

6285
02:08:44,559 --> 02:08:47,390
whether one is more intelligent than the
other it's

6286
02:08:47,390 --> 02:08:47,400
other it's
 

6287
02:08:47,400 --> 02:08:50,910
other it's
multi-dimensional so you push back

6288
02:08:50,910 --> 02:08:50,920
multi-dimensional so you push back
 

6289
02:08:50,920 --> 02:08:55,669
multi-dimensional so you push back
against what are called AI doomers a lot

6290
02:08:55,669 --> 02:08:55,679
against what are called AI doomers a lot
 

6291
02:08:55,679 --> 02:08:57,870
against what are called AI doomers a lot
uh can you explain their perspective and

6292
02:08:57,870 --> 02:08:57,880
uh can you explain their perspective and
 

6293
02:08:57,880 --> 02:09:00,430
uh can you explain their perspective and
why you think they're wrong okay so a I

6294
02:09:00,430 --> 02:09:00,440
why you think they're wrong okay so a I
 

6295
02:09:00,440 --> 02:09:02,790
why you think they're wrong okay so a I
doomers imagine all kinds of catastrophe

6296
02:09:02,790 --> 02:09:02,800
doomers imagine all kinds of catastrophe
 

6297
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:06,510
doomers imagine all kinds of catastrophe
scenarios of how AI could Escape or

6298
02:09:06,510 --> 02:09:06,520
scenarios of how AI could Escape or
 

6299
02:09:06,520 --> 02:09:09,910
scenarios of how AI could Escape or
control and basically kill us

6300
02:09:09,910 --> 02:09:09,920
control and basically kill us
 

6301
02:09:09,920 --> 02:09:13,109
control and basically kill us
all uh and that relies on a whole bunch

6302
02:09:13,109 --> 02:09:13,119
all uh and that relies on a whole bunch
 

6303
02:09:13,119 --> 02:09:15,549
all uh and that relies on a whole bunch
of assumptions that are mostly

6304
02:09:15,549 --> 02:09:15,559
of assumptions that are mostly
 

6305
02:09:15,559 --> 02:09:18,669
of assumptions that are mostly
false so the first assumption is that

6306
02:09:18,669 --> 02:09:18,679
false so the first assumption is that
 

6307
02:09:18,679 --> 02:09:20,069
false so the first assumption is that
the emergence of super intelligence is

6308
02:09:20,069 --> 02:09:20,079
the emergence of super intelligence is
 

6309
02:09:20,079 --> 02:09:21,069
the emergence of super intelligence is
going to be an

6310
02:09:21,069 --> 02:09:21,079
going to be an
 

6311
02:09:21,079 --> 02:09:23,149
going to be an
event that at some point we're going to

6312
02:09:23,149 --> 02:09:23,159
event that at some point we're going to
 

6313
02:09:23,159 --> 02:09:24,549
event that at some point we're going to
have we're going to figure out the

6314
02:09:24,549 --> 02:09:24,559
have we're going to figure out the
 

6315
02:09:24,559 --> 02:09:26,350
have we're going to figure out the
secret and we'll turn on a machine that

6316
02:09:26,350 --> 02:09:26,360
secret and we'll turn on a machine that
 

6317
02:09:26,360 --> 02:09:27,350
secret and we'll turn on a machine that
is super

6318
02:09:27,350 --> 02:09:27,360
is super
 

6319
02:09:27,360 --> 02:09:29,790
is super
intelligent and because we've never done

6320
02:09:29,790 --> 02:09:29,800
intelligent and because we've never done
 

6321
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:31,069
intelligent and because we've never done
it before it's going to take over the

6322
02:09:31,069 --> 02:09:31,079
it before it's going to take over the
 

6323
02:09:31,079 --> 02:09:33,910
it before it's going to take over the
world and kill us all that is false it's

6324
02:09:33,910 --> 02:09:33,920
world and kill us all that is false it's
 

6325
02:09:33,920 --> 02:09:36,109
world and kill us all that is false it's
not going to be an event we're going to

6326
02:09:36,109 --> 02:09:36,119
not going to be an event we're going to
 

6327
02:09:36,119 --> 02:09:38,910
not going to be an event we're going to
have systems that are like as smart as a

6328
02:09:38,910 --> 02:09:38,920
have systems that are like as smart as a
 

6329
02:09:38,920 --> 02:09:40,669
have systems that are like as smart as a
cat has all the have all the

6330
02:09:40,669 --> 02:09:40,679
cat has all the have all the
 

6331
02:09:40,679 --> 02:09:43,790
cat has all the have all the
characteristics of you know human level

6332
02:09:43,790 --> 02:09:43,800
characteristics of you know human level
 

6333
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:45,430
characteristics of you know human level
intelligence but their level of

6334
02:09:45,430 --> 02:09:45,440
intelligence but their level of
 

6335
02:09:45,440 --> 02:09:47,629
intelligence but their level of
intelligence would be like a cat or a

6336
02:09:47,629 --> 02:09:47,639
intelligence would be like a cat or a
 

6337
02:09:47,639 --> 02:09:49,030
intelligence would be like a cat or a
pirrot maybe

6338
02:09:49,030 --> 02:09:49,040
pirrot maybe
 

6339
02:09:49,040 --> 02:09:49,750
pirrot maybe
or

6340
02:09:49,750 --> 02:09:49,760
or
 

6341
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:52,189
or
something um and then we're going to

6342
02:09:52,189 --> 02:09:52,199
something um and then we're going to
 

6343
02:09:52,199 --> 02:09:54,430
something um and then we're going to
work our way up to kind of make those

6344
02:09:54,430 --> 02:09:54,440
work our way up to kind of make those
 

6345
02:09:54,440 --> 02:09:55,870
work our way up to kind of make those
things more intelligent and as we make

6346
02:09:55,870 --> 02:09:55,880
things more intelligent and as we make
 

6347
02:09:55,880 --> 02:09:57,109
things more intelligent and as we make
them more intelligent we're also going

6348
02:09:57,109 --> 02:09:57,119
them more intelligent we're also going
 

6349
02:09:57,119 --> 02:09:58,549
them more intelligent we're also going
to put some guard rails in them and

6350
02:09:58,549 --> 02:09:58,559
to put some guard rails in them and
 

6351
02:09:58,559 --> 02:10:00,030
to put some guard rails in them and
learn how to kind of put some guard

6352
02:10:00,030 --> 02:10:00,040
learn how to kind of put some guard
 

6353
02:10:00,040 --> 02:10:02,030
learn how to kind of put some guard
rails so they behave properly and we're

6354
02:10:02,030 --> 02:10:02,040
rails so they behave properly and we're
 

6355
02:10:02,040 --> 02:10:03,790
rails so they behave properly and we're
not going to do this with just one it's

6356
02:10:03,790 --> 02:10:03,800
not going to do this with just one it's
 

6357
02:10:03,800 --> 02:10:04,990
not going to do this with just one it's
not going to be one effort there's going

6358
02:10:04,990 --> 02:10:05,000
not going to be one effort there's going
 

6359
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:06,709
not going to be one effort there's going
to be lots of different people doing

6360
02:10:06,709 --> 02:10:06,719
to be lots of different people doing
 

6361
02:10:06,719 --> 02:10:08,669
to be lots of different people doing
this and some of them are going to

6362
02:10:08,669 --> 02:10:08,679
this and some of them are going to
 

6363
02:10:08,679 --> 02:10:10,589
this and some of them are going to
succeed at making intelligent systems

6364
02:10:10,589 --> 02:10:10,599
succeed at making intelligent systems
 

6365
02:10:10,599 --> 02:10:13,149
succeed at making intelligent systems
that are uh controllable and safe and

6366
02:10:13,149 --> 02:10:13,159
that are uh controllable and safe and
 

6367
02:10:13,159 --> 02:10:14,910
that are uh controllable and safe and
have the right guard rails and if some

6368
02:10:14,910 --> 02:10:14,920
have the right guard rails and if some
 

6369
02:10:14,920 --> 02:10:17,750
have the right guard rails and if some
other goes wrog then we can use the the

6370
02:10:17,750 --> 02:10:17,760
other goes wrog then we can use the the
 

6371
02:10:17,760 --> 02:10:20,149
other goes wrog then we can use the the
good ones to go against the Rogue ones

6372
02:10:20,149 --> 02:10:20,159
good ones to go against the Rogue ones
 

6373
02:10:20,159 --> 02:10:22,430
good ones to go against the Rogue ones
uh so it's going to be my you know smart

6374
02:10:22,430 --> 02:10:22,440
uh so it's going to be my you know smart
 

6375
02:10:22,440 --> 02:10:25,589
uh so it's going to be my you know smart
AI police against your Rogue AI um so

6376
02:10:25,589 --> 02:10:25,599
AI police against your Rogue AI um so
 

6377
02:10:25,599 --> 02:10:26,709
AI police against your Rogue AI um so
it's not going to be like you know we're

6378
02:10:26,709 --> 02:10:26,719
it's not going to be like you know we're
 

6379
02:10:26,719 --> 02:10:28,310
it's not going to be like you know we're
going to be exposed to like a single

6380
02:10:28,310 --> 02:10:28,320
going to be exposed to like a single
 

6381
02:10:28,320 --> 02:10:29,830
going to be exposed to like a single
Rogue AI that's going to kill us all

6382
02:10:29,830 --> 02:10:29,840
Rogue AI that's going to kill us all
 

6383
02:10:29,840 --> 02:10:32,149
Rogue AI that's going to kill us all
that's just not not happening now there

6384
02:10:32,149 --> 02:10:32,159
that's just not not happening now there
 

6385
02:10:32,159 --> 02:10:34,030
that's just not not happening now there
is another fallacy which is the fact

6386
02:10:34,030 --> 02:10:34,040
is another fallacy which is the fact
 

6387
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:36,229
is another fallacy which is the fact
that because the system is intelligent

6388
02:10:36,229 --> 02:10:36,239
that because the system is intelligent
 

6389
02:10:36,239 --> 02:10:40,589
that because the system is intelligent
it necessarily wants to take over MH um

6390
02:10:40,589 --> 02:10:40,599
it necessarily wants to take over MH um
 

6391
02:10:40,599 --> 02:10:42,350
it necessarily wants to take over MH um
and there is several

6392
02:10:42,350 --> 02:10:42,360
and there is several
 

6393
02:10:42,360 --> 02:10:44,750
and there is several
arguments that make people scare of this

6394
02:10:44,750 --> 02:10:44,760
arguments that make people scare of this
 

6395
02:10:44,760 --> 02:10:48,030
arguments that make people scare of this
which I think are completely false uh as

6396
02:10:48,030 --> 02:10:48,040
which I think are completely false uh as
 

6397
02:10:48,040 --> 02:10:52,310
which I think are completely false uh as
well so one of them is um you know in

6398
02:10:52,310 --> 02:10:52,320
well so one of them is um you know in
 

6399
02:10:52,320 --> 02:10:54,510
well so one of them is um you know in
nature it seems to be that the more

6400
02:10:54,510 --> 02:10:54,520
nature it seems to be that the more
 

6401
02:10:54,520 --> 02:10:56,310
nature it seems to be that the more
intelligent species otherwi that end up

6402
02:10:56,310 --> 02:10:56,320
intelligent species otherwi that end up
 

6403
02:10:56,320 --> 02:11:00,310
intelligent species otherwi that end up
dominating the other and uh and

6404
02:11:00,310 --> 02:11:00,320
dominating the other and uh and
 

6405
02:11:00,320 --> 02:11:03,510
dominating the other and uh and
even you know extinguishing the others

6406
02:11:03,510 --> 02:11:03,520
even you know extinguishing the others
 

6407
02:11:03,520 --> 02:11:07,030
even you know extinguishing the others
uh sometimes by Design sometimes just by

6408
02:11:07,030 --> 02:11:07,040
uh sometimes by Design sometimes just by
 

6409
02:11:07,040 --> 02:11:08,589
uh sometimes by Design sometimes just by
mistake

6410
02:11:08,589 --> 02:11:08,599
mistake
 

6411
02:11:08,599 --> 02:11:12,589
mistake
and and so you know there is sort of uh

6412
02:11:12,589 --> 02:11:12,599
and and so you know there is sort of uh
 

6413
02:11:12,599 --> 02:11:15,510
and and so you know there is sort of uh
Thinking by which you say well if AI

6414
02:11:15,510 --> 02:11:15,520
Thinking by which you say well if AI
 

6415
02:11:15,520 --> 02:11:17,270
Thinking by which you say well if AI
systems are more intelligent than us

6416
02:11:17,270 --> 02:11:17,280
systems are more intelligent than us
 

6417
02:11:17,280 --> 02:11:19,910
systems are more intelligent than us
surely they're going to eliminate us if

6418
02:11:19,910 --> 02:11:19,920
surely they're going to eliminate us if
 

6419
02:11:19,920 --> 02:11:22,350
surely they're going to eliminate us if
not by Design simply because they don't

6420
02:11:22,350 --> 02:11:22,360
not by Design simply because they don't
 

6421
02:11:22,360 --> 02:11:24,709
not by Design simply because they don't
care about us and that's just

6422
02:11:24,709 --> 02:11:24,719
care about us and that's just
 

6423
02:11:24,719 --> 02:11:27,470
care about us and that's just
Preposterous for for a number of reasons

6424
02:11:27,470 --> 02:11:27,480
Preposterous for for a number of reasons
 

6425
02:11:27,480 --> 02:11:29,069
Preposterous for for a number of reasons
um first reason is they're not going to

6426
02:11:29,069 --> 02:11:29,079
um first reason is they're not going to
 

6427
02:11:29,079 --> 02:11:30,830
um first reason is they're not going to
be a species they're not going to be a

6428
02:11:30,830 --> 02:11:30,840
be a species they're not going to be a
 

6429

not going to have the desire to dominate
 

6433
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:36,790
not going to have the desire to dominate
because the desire to dominate is

02:12:10,910 --> 02:12:10,920
we are almost right and to you there's
 

6461
02:12:10,920 --> 02:12:12,709
we are almost right and to you there's
not significant incentive for humans to

not significant incentive for humans to
 

6463

not significant incentive for humans to
encode that into the AI systems and to

encode that into the AI systems and to
 

6465
02:12:15,679 --> 02:12:20,149
encode that into the AI systems and to
the degree they do there'll be AIS that

6466
02:12:20,149 --> 02:12:20,159
the degree they do there'll be AIS that
 

6467
02:12:20,159 --> 02:12:22,149
the degree they do there'll be AIS that
um sort of punish them for it I'll

6468
02:12:22,149 --> 02:12:22,159
um sort of punish them for it I'll
 

6469
02:12:22,159 --> 02:12:23,549
um sort of punish them for it I'll
compete them over well there's all kinds

sometimes they're going to do something

sometimes they're going to do something
that you know was unexpected because the

that you know was unexpected because the
 

6535
02:13:37,400 --> 02:13:38,629
that you know was unexpected because the
guardare wasn't right and we're going to

02:13:38,629 --> 02:13:38,639
guardare wasn't right and we're going to
 

6537
02:13:38,639 --> 02:13:40,990
guardare wasn't right and we're going to
correct them so that they do it right uh

6538
02:13:40,990 --> 02:13:41,000
correct them so that they do it right uh
 

6539
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,109

6541
02:13:43,119 --> 02:13:44,709
the idea somehow that we can't get it
slightly wrong because if we get it

02:13:44,709 --> 02:13:44,719
slightly wrong because if we get it
 

6543
02:13:44,719 --> 02:13:47,069
slightly wrong because if we get it
slightly wrong we all die is is

slightly wrong we all die is is
 

6545
02:13:47,079 --> 02:13:48,629
slightly wrong we all die is is
ridiculous

6546
02:13:48,629 --> 02:13:48,639
ridiculous
 

6547
02:13:48,639 --> 02:13:50,390
ridiculous
um we we're just going to go

6548
02:13:50,390 --> 02:13:50,400
um we we're just going to go
 

6549
02:13:50,400 --> 02:13:52,270
um we we're just going to go
progressively and it's it's just going

02:13:52,270 --> 02:13:52,280
progressively and it's it's just going
 

6551
02:13:52,280 --> 02:13:54,709
progressively and it's it's just going
to be the the analogy I've used many

6552
02:13:54,709 --> 02:13:54,719
to be the the analogy I've used many
 

6553
02:13:54,719 --> 02:14:00,750
to be the the analogy I've used many
times is um is uh turbojet design um how

6554
02:14:00,750 --> 02:14:00,760
times is um is uh turbojet design um how
 

6555
02:14:00,760 --> 02:14:02,510
times is um is uh turbojet design um how
how did we figure out how to make

6556
02:14:02,510 --> 02:14:02,520
how did we figure out how to make
 

6557
02:14:02,520 --> 02:14:06,709
how did we figure out how to make
turbojet so unbelievably reliable right

6558
02:14:06,709 --> 02:14:06,719
turbojet so unbelievably reliable right
 

6559
02:14:06,719 --> 02:14:08,109
turbojet so unbelievably reliable right
uh I mean those are like you know

6560
02:14:08,109 --> 02:14:08,119
uh I mean those are like you know
 

6561
02:14:08,119 --> 02:14:11,109
uh I mean those are like you know
incredibly complex uh pieces of Hardware

6562

kind of fine-tune the design of those

6586
02:14:40,510 --> 02:14:40,520
kind of fine-tune the design of those
 

6587
02:14:40,520 --> 02:14:43,870
kind of fine-tune the design of those
systems so that they they were safe is

6588
02:14:43,870 --> 02:14:43,880
systems so that they they were safe is
 

6589
02:14:43,880 --> 02:14:48,430
systems so that they they were safe is
there a separate uh group Within General

6590
02:14:48,430 --> 02:14:48,440
there a separate uh group Within General
 

6591
02:14:48,440 --> 02:14:51,750
there a separate uh group Within General
Electric or snma or whatever that is

6592
02:14:51,750 --> 02:14:51,760
Electric or snma or whatever that is
 

6593
02:14:51,760 --> 02:14:56,030
Electric or snma or whatever that is
specialized in turo jet safety no it's

6594
02:14:56,030 --> 02:14:56,040
specialized in turo jet safety no it's
 

6595
02:14:56,040 --> 02:14:59,270
specialized in turo jet safety no it's
the design is all about safety because a

6596
02:14:59,270 --> 02:14:59,280
the design is all about safety because a
 

6597
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:00,990
the design is all about safety because a
better Turbo Jet is also a safer Turbo

6598
02:15:00,990 --> 02:15:01,000
better Turbo Jet is also a safer Turbo
 

6599
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,750
better Turbo Jet is also a safer Turbo
Jet so um a more reliable one it's the

6600
02:15:03,750 --> 02:15:03,760
Jet so um a more reliable one it's the
 

6601
02:15:03,760 --> 02:15:06,589
Jet so um a more reliable one it's the
same for AI like do you do you need you

6602
02:15:06,589 --> 02:15:06,599
same for AI like do you do you need you
 

6603
02:15:06,599 --> 02:15:08,510
same for AI like do you do you need you
know specific Provisions to make AI safe

6604
02:15:08,510 --> 02:15:08,520
know specific Provisions to make AI safe
 

6605
02:15:08,520 --> 02:15:10,390
know specific Provisions to make AI safe
no you need to make better AI systems

6606
02:15:10,390 --> 02:15:10,400
no you need to make better AI systems
 

6607
02:15:10,400 --> 02:15:12,270
no you need to make better AI systems
and they will be safe because they are

6608
02:15:12,270 --> 02:15:12,280
and they will be safe because they are
 

6609
02:15:12,280 --> 02:15:13,990
and they will be safe because they are
designed to be more

6610
02:15:13,990 --> 02:15:14,000
designed to be more
 

6611
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:17,189
designed to be more
useful uh and more controllable so let's

6612
02:15:17,189 --> 02:15:17,199
useful uh and more controllable so let's
 

6613
02:15:17,199 --> 02:15:19,709
useful uh and more controllable so let's
imagine a system AI system that's able

6614
02:15:19,709 --> 02:15:19,719
imagine a system AI system that's able
 

6615
02:15:19,719 --> 02:15:22,229
imagine a system AI system that's able
to be incredibly

6616
02:15:22,229 --> 02:15:22,239
to be incredibly
 

6617
02:15:22,239 --> 02:15:24,950
to be incredibly
convincing and can convince you of

6618
02:15:24,950 --> 02:15:24,960
convincing and can convince you of
 

6619
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:28,270
convincing and can convince you of
anything I I can at least imagine such a

6620
02:15:28,270 --> 02:15:28,280
anything I I can at least imagine such a
 

6621
02:15:28,280 --> 02:15:31,589
anything I I can at least imagine such a
system and I can see such a system

6622
02:15:31,589 --> 02:15:31,599
system and I can see such a system
 

6623
02:15:31,599 --> 02:15:34,790
system and I can see such a system
be weapon-like because it can control

6624
02:15:34,790 --> 02:15:34,800
be weapon-like because it can control
 

6625
02:15:34,800 --> 02:15:37,310
be weapon-like because it can control
people's minds we're pretty gullible we

6626
02:15:37,310 --> 02:15:37,320
people's minds we're pretty gullible we
 

6627
02:15:37,320 --> 02:15:39,069
people's minds we're pretty gullible we
we want to believe a thing you can have

6628
02:15:39,069 --> 02:15:39,079
we want to believe a thing you can have
 

6629
02:15:39,079 --> 02:15:41,229
we want to believe a thing you can have
an A system that controls it and you

6630
02:15:41,229 --> 02:15:41,239
an A system that controls it and you
 

6631
02:15:41,239 --> 02:15:43,790
an A system that controls it and you
could see governments using that as a

6632
02:15:43,790 --> 02:15:43,800
could see governments using that as a
 

6633
02:15:43,800 --> 02:15:46,589
could see governments using that as a
weapon so do you think if you imagine

6634
02:15:46,589 --> 02:15:46,599
weapon so do you think if you imagine
 

6635
02:15:46,599 --> 02:15:48,589
weapon so do you think if you imagine
such a system

6636
02:15:48,589 --> 02:15:48,599
such a system
 

6637
02:15:48,599 --> 02:15:51,350
such a system
there's any parallel to something like

6638
02:15:51,350 --> 02:15:51,360
there's any parallel to something like
 

6639
02:15:51,360 --> 02:15:57,470
there's any parallel to something like
nuclear weapons no so is why why why is

6640
02:15:57,470 --> 02:15:57,480
nuclear weapons no so is why why why is
 

6641
02:15:57,480 --> 02:15:58,990
nuclear weapons no so is why why why is
that technology different so you're

6642
02:15:58,990 --> 02:15:59,000
that technology different so you're
 

6643
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:00,470
that technology different so you're
saying there's going to be gradual

6644
02:16:00,470 --> 02:16:00,480
saying there's going to be gradual
 

6645
02:16:00,480 --> 02:16:03,149
saying there's going to be gradual
development yeah there's going to be I

6646
02:16:03,149 --> 02:16:03,159
development yeah there's going to be I
 

6647
02:16:03,159 --> 02:16:04,870
development yeah there's going to be I
mean it might be rapid but they'll be

6648
02:16:04,870 --> 02:16:04,880
mean it might be rapid but they'll be
 

6649
02:16:04,880 --> 02:16:06,990
mean it might be rapid but they'll be
iterative and then we'll be able to kind

6650
02:16:06,990 --> 02:16:07,000
iterative and then we'll be able to kind
 

6651
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,790
iterative and then we'll be able to kind
of respond and and so on so that AI

6652
02:16:09,790 --> 02:16:09,800
of respond and and so on so that AI
 

6653
02:16:09,800 --> 02:16:12,109
of respond and and so on so that AI
system designed by Vladimir Putin or

02:16:20,189 --> 02:16:20,199
is going to be uh like talking to trying
 

6659
02:16:20,199 --> 02:16:22,790
is going to be uh like talking to trying
to talk to every American to uh convince

6660
02:16:22,790 --> 02:16:22,800
to talk to every American to uh convince
 

6661

02:16:38,110 --> 02:16:38,120
trying to
 

6671
02:16:38,120 --> 02:16:40,589
trying to
do they're not going to be talking to

you they're going to be talking to your
 

6675
02:16:42,120 --> 02:16:45,549
you they're going to be talking to your
AI assistant mhm which is going to be as

02:16:45,549 --> 02:16:45,559
AI assistant mhm which is going to be as
 

6677
02:16:45,559 --> 02:16:48,990
AI assistant mhm which is going to be as
smart as theirs MH right right that AI

6678
02:16:48,990 --> 02:16:49,000
smart as theirs MH right right that AI
 

6679
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,230
smart as theirs MH right right that AI
because as I said in the future every

6680
02:16:51,230 --> 02:16:51,240
because as I said in the future every
 

6681
02:16:51,240 --> 02:16:52,669
because as I said in the future every
single one of your interaction with the

6682
02:16:52,669 --> 02:16:52,679
single one of your interaction with the
 

6683
02:16:52,679 --> 02:16:54,709
single one of your interaction with the
digital world will be mediated by your

6684
02:16:54,709 --> 02:16:54,719
digital world will be mediated by your
 

6685
02:16:54,719 --> 02:16:56,309
digital world will be mediated by your
AI assistant so the first thing you're

6686
02:16:56,309 --> 02:16:56,319
AI assistant so the first thing you're
 

6687
02:16:56,319 --> 02:16:58,910
AI assistant so the first thing you're
going to ask is is this a scam like is

6688
02:16:58,910 --> 02:16:58,920
going to ask is is this a scam like is
 

6689
02:16:58,920 --> 02:17:00,669
going to ask is is this a scam like is
this thing like telling me the truth

6690
02:17:00,669 --> 02:17:00,679
this thing like telling me the truth
 

6691
02:17:00,679 --> 02:17:02,589
this thing like telling me the truth
like it's not even going to be able to

6692
02:17:02,589 --> 02:17:02,599
like it's not even going to be able to
 

6693
02:17:02,599 --> 02:17:04,589
like it's not even going to be able to
get to you because it's only going to

6694
02:17:04,589 --> 02:17:04,599
get to you because it's only going to
 

6695
02:17:04,599 --> 02:17:06,110
get to you because it's only going to
talk to your AI assistant and your AI

6696
02:17:06,110 --> 02:17:06,120
talk to your AI assistant and your AI
 

6697
02:17:06,120 --> 02:17:08,589
talk to your AI assistant and your AI
assistant is not not even going to it's

6698
02:17:08,589 --> 02:17:08,599
assistant is not not even going to it's
 

6699
02:17:08,599 --> 02:17:10,589
assistant is not not even going to it's
going to be like a spam filter right

6700
02:17:10,589 --> 02:17:10,599
going to be like a spam filter right
 

6701
02:17:10,599 --> 02:17:12,790
going to be like a spam filter right
you're not even seeing the email the

6702
02:17:12,790 --> 02:17:12,800
you're not even seeing the email the
 

6703
02:17:12,800 --> 02:17:14,990
you're not even seeing the email the
spam email right it's automatically put

6704
02:17:14,990 --> 02:17:15,000
spam email right it's automatically put
 

6705
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,309
spam email right it's automatically put
in a folder that you never see um it's

6706
02:17:17,309 --> 02:17:17,319
in a folder that you never see um it's
 

6707
02:17:17,319 --> 02:17:19,790
in a folder that you never see um it's
going to be same thing that AI system

6708
02:17:19,790 --> 02:17:19,800
going to be same thing that AI system
 

6709
02:17:19,800 --> 02:17:21,389
going to be same thing that AI system
that tries to convince you of something

6710
02:17:21,389 --> 02:17:21,399
that tries to convince you of something
 

6711
02:17:21,399 --> 02:17:23,150
that tries to convince you of something
is going to be talking to a assistant

6712
02:17:23,150 --> 02:17:23,160
is going to be talking to a assistant
 

6713
02:17:23,160 --> 02:17:24,469
is going to be talking to a assistant
which is going to be at least as smart

6714
02:17:24,469 --> 02:17:24,479
which is going to be at least as smart
 

6715
02:17:24,479 --> 02:17:25,349
which is going to be at least as smart
as

6716
02:17:25,349 --> 02:17:25,359
as
 

6717
02:17:25,359 --> 02:17:28,629
as
it and is going to say this is spam you

6718
02:17:28,629 --> 02:17:28,639
it and is going to say this is spam you
 

6719
02:17:28,639 --> 02:17:31,150
it and is going to say this is spam you
know U it's not even going to bring it

6720
02:17:31,150 --> 02:17:31,160
know U it's not even going to bring it
 

6721
02:17:31,160 --> 02:17:33,669
know U it's not even going to bring it
to your attention so to you it's very

6722
02:17:33,669 --> 02:17:33,679
to your attention so to you it's very
 

6723
02:17:33,679 --> 02:17:35,509
to your attention so to you it's very
difficult for any one AI system to take

6724
02:17:35,509 --> 02:17:35,519
difficult for any one AI system to take
 

6725
02:17:35,519 --> 02:17:37,870
difficult for any one AI system to take
such a big leap ahead to where it can

6726
02:17:37,870 --> 02:17:37,880
such a big leap ahead to where it can
 

6727
02:17:37,880 --> 02:17:40,150
such a big leap ahead to where it can
convince even the other AI systems so

6728
02:17:40,150 --> 02:17:40,160
convince even the other AI systems so
 

6729
02:17:40,160 --> 02:17:42,950
convince even the other AI systems so
like it there's always going to be this

6730
02:17:42,950 --> 02:17:42,960
like it there's always going to be this
 

6731
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:46,669
like it there's always going to be this
kind of race where nobody's way ahead

6732
02:17:46,669 --> 02:17:46,679
kind of race where nobody's way ahead
 

6733
02:17:46,679 --> 02:17:49,030
kind of race where nobody's way ahead
that's the history of the world history

6734
02:17:49,030 --> 02:17:49,040
that's the history of the world history
 

6735
02:17:49,040 --> 02:17:50,509
that's the history of the world history
of the world is you know whenever there

6736
02:17:50,509 --> 02:17:50,519
of the world is you know whenever there
 

6737
02:17:50,519 --> 02:17:53,110
of the world is you know whenever there
is a prog at some someplace there is a

is a prog at some someplace there is a
 

6739
02:17:53,120 --> 02:17:56,230
is a prog at some someplace there is a
countermeasure and and you know it's a

6740
02:17:56,230 --> 02:17:56,240
countermeasure and and you know it's a
 

6741
02:17:56,240 --> 02:17:58,349
countermeasure and and you know it's a
it's a Katan mous game well this is why

6742
02:17:58,349 --> 02:17:58,359
it's a Katan mous game well this is why
 

6743
02:17:58,359 --> 02:18:00,270
it's a Katan mous game well this is why
mostly yes but this is why nuclear

6744
02:18:00,270 --> 02:18:00,280
mostly yes but this is why nuclear
 

6745
02:18:00,280 --> 02:18:02,469
mostly yes but this is why nuclear
weapons are so interesting because that

6746
02:18:02,469 --> 02:18:02,479
weapons are so interesting because that
 

6747
02:18:02,479 --> 02:18:05,589
weapons are so interesting because that
was such a powerful weapon that it

6748
02:18:05,589 --> 02:18:05,599
was such a powerful weapon that it
 

6749
02:18:05,599 --> 02:18:07,509
was such a powerful weapon that it
mattered who got it

6750
02:18:07,509 --> 02:18:07,519
mattered who got it
 

6751
02:18:07,519 --> 02:18:11,070
mattered who got it

States getting the weapon first but to
 

6763
02:18:24,519 --> 02:18:27,950

you nuclear weapons is is like you you

6764
02:18:27,950 --> 02:18:27,960
you nuclear weapons is is like you you
 

6765
02:18:27,960 --> 02:18:31,669
you nuclear weapons is is like you you
don't imagine a uh breakthrough

6766
02:18:31,669 --> 02:18:31,679
don't imagine a uh breakthrough

6769
02:18:33,719 --> 02:18:37,910

like effort for AI no as I said it's not

6770
02:18:37,910 --> 02:18:37,920
like effort for AI no as I said it's not
 

6771
02:18:37,920 --> 02:18:40,070
like effort for AI no as I said it's not
going to be an event it's going to be

02:18:40,070 --> 02:18:40,080
going to be an event it's going to be
 

6773
02:18:40,080 --> 02:18:43,589
going to be an event it's going to be
you know continuous progress and and

02:18:43,589 --> 02:18:43,599
you know continuous progress and and
 

6775
02:18:43,599 --> 02:18:45,549

whenever you know one breakthrough
 

6777
02:18:45,559 --> 02:18:46,910

02:18:48,950 --> 02:18:48,960
disseminated really quickly yeah
 

6781
02:18:48,960 --> 02:18:51,230
disseminated really quickly yeah
probably first within industry I mean

6782
02:18:51,230 --> 02:18:51,240
probably first within industry I mean
 

6783
02:18:51,240 --> 02:18:53,790

this is not a domain where you know

particularly Innovative and they're in
 

6789
02:18:58,200 --> 02:19:01,309
particularly Innovative and they're in
fact way behind um and so this is going

6790
02:19:01,309 --> 02:19:01,319
fact way behind um and so this is going
 

6791
02:19:01,319 --> 02:19:03,349
fact way behind um and so this is going
to come from industry and and this kind

6792
02:19:03,349 --> 02:19:03,359
to come from industry and and this kind
 

6793
02:19:03,359 --> 02:19:04,990
to come from industry and and this kind
of information disseminates extremely

6794
02:19:04,990 --> 02:19:05,000
of information disseminates extremely
 

6795
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,070
of information disseminates extremely
quickly we've seen this over the last

6796
02:19:07,070 --> 02:19:07,080
quickly we've seen this over the last
 

6797
02:19:07,080 --> 02:19:10,230
quickly we've seen this over the last
few years right where you have a new

02:19:10,230 --> 02:19:10,240
few years right where you have a new
 

6799
02:19:10,240 --> 02:19:12,230

02:19:12,230 --> 02:19:12,240
like you know even take alphao this was
 

6801
02:19:12,240 --> 02:19:13,830
like you know even take alphao this was
reproduced within three

6802
02:19:13,830 --> 02:19:13,840

02:19:18,349 --> 02:19:18,359
detailed information right yeah this is
 

6807
02:19:18,359 --> 02:19:21,270
detailed information right yeah this is
an industry that's not good at secrecy

6808

an industry that's not good at secrecy
 

6809
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:23,309
an industry that's not good at secrecy
no but even even if there is just the

02:19:23,309 --> 02:19:23,319
no but even even if there is just the
 

6811
02:19:23,319 --> 02:19:24,589
no but even even if there is just the
fact that you know that something is

6812
02:19:24,589 --> 02:19:24,599
fact that you know that something is
 

6813
02:19:24,599 --> 02:19:28,870
fact that you know that something is
possible yeah uh makes you like realize

6814
02:19:28,870 --> 02:19:28,880
possible yeah uh makes you like realize
 

6815
02:19:28,880 --> 02:19:30,309
possible yeah uh makes you like realize
that it's worth investing the time to

6816
02:19:30,309 --> 02:19:30,319
that it's worth investing the time to
 

6817
02:19:30,319 --> 02:19:32,190
that it's worth investing the time to
actually do it you you may be the second

02:19:32,190 --> 02:19:32,200
actually do it you you may be the second
 

6819
02:19:32,200 --> 02:19:34,389
actually do it you you may be the second
person to do it but you know you'll

then it's getting reproduced and then

02:19:55,560 --> 02:19:58,150
then it's getting reproduced and then
you know people who work for those

companies move they go from one company
 

6843
02:20:01,200 --> 02:20:04,150
companies move they go from one company
to another and you know the information

6844
02:20:04,150 --> 02:20:04,160
to another and you know the information
 

6845
02:20:04,160 --> 02:20:07,670

disseminates what makes the success of

02:20:07,670 --> 02:20:07,680
disseminates what makes the success of

Valley in particular is exactly that is

6850
02:20:11,830 --> 02:20:11,840
Valley in particular is exactly that is
 

6851
02:20:11,840 --> 02:20:13,230
Valley in particular is exactly that is
because information circulates really

6852
02:20:13,230 --> 02:20:13,240
because information circulates really
 

6853
02:20:13,240 --> 02:20:15,429
because information circulates really
really quickly and this you know

6854
02:20:15,429 --> 02:20:15,439
really quickly and this you know
 

6855
02:20:15,439 --> 02:20:18,150
really quickly and this you know
disseminates very quickly and so you

6856
02:20:18,150 --> 02:20:18,160
disseminates very quickly and so you
 

6857
02:20:18,160 --> 02:20:21,270
disseminates very quickly and so you
know the the whole region sort of is

6858
02:20:21,270 --> 02:20:21,280
know the the whole region sort of is
 

6859
02:20:21,280 --> 02:20:23,469
know the the whole region sort of is
ahead because of that circulation of

6861
02:20:23,479 --> 02:20:26,510

7015
02:23:55,840 --> 02:23:57,389
thing they worry about with big Tech
something we've been talking about over

7016
02:23:57,389 --> 02:23:57,399
something we've been talking about over
 

7017
02:23:57,399 --> 02:23:59,990
something we've been talking about over
and over but I think

7018
02:23:59,990 --> 02:24:00,000
and over but I think
 

7019
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:03,230

worth mentioning again they worry about
how powerful AI will be and they worry

7022

how powerful AI will be and they worry
 

7023
02:24:06,439 --> 02:24:08,990
how powerful AI will be and they worry
about it being in the hands of one

yeah again I think the answer to this is
 

7089
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:46,830
yeah again I think the answer to this is
open source platforms and then en

value systems across the world um so

7100
02:26:00,150 --> 02:26:00,160

7101
02:26:00,160 --> 02:26:03,190

that you're not bound to just uh you

7102
02:26:03,190 --> 02:26:03,200
that you're not bound to just uh you

know be brainwashed by a particular way

7104
02:26:06,349 --> 02:26:06,359
know be brainwashed by a particular way
 

7105
02:26:06,359 --> 02:26:10,469
know be brainwashed by a particular way
of thinking because of single AI entity

7106
02:26:10,469 --> 02:26:10,479
of thinking because of single AI entity
 

7107
02:26:10,479 --> 02:26:12,830
of thinking because of single AI entity
um so I mean I I think it's really

7108
02:26:12,830 --> 02:26:12,840
um so I mean I I think it's really
 

7109
02:26:12,840 --> 02:26:14,870
um so I mean I I think it's really
really important question for society

7110
02:26:14,870 --> 02:26:14,880
really important question for society
 

7111
02:26:14,880 --> 02:26:17,550
really important question for society
and the problem I'm seeing is

7112
02:26:17,550 --> 02:26:17,560
and the problem I'm seeing is
 

7113
02:26:17,560 --> 02:26:21,230
and the problem I'm seeing is
um is that um which is why I've been so

7114
02:26:21,230 --> 02:26:21,240
um is that um which is why I've been so
 

7115
02:26:21,240 --> 02:26:24,750
um is that um which is why I've been so

7174
02:27:46,830 --> 02:27:46,840
systems do you trust humans with this
 

7175
02:27:46,840 --> 02:27:50,590
systems do you trust humans with this
technology to uh to build systems that

7176
02:27:50,590 --> 02:27:50,600
technology to uh to build systems that
 

7177
02:27:50,600 --> 02:27:53,510
technology to uh to build systems that
are on the whole good for Humanity isn't

7178
02:27:53,510 --> 02:27:53,520
are on the whole good for Humanity isn't

that what democracy and free speech is

7180
02:27:55,750 --> 02:27:55,760
that what democracy and free speech is
 

7181
02:27:55,760 --> 02:27:58,190
that what democracy and free speech is
all about I think so do you trust

7182
02:27:58,190 --> 02:27:58,200
all about I think so do you trust
 

7183
02:27:58,200 --> 02:28:00,389
all about I think so do you trust
institutions to do the right thing do

7184
02:28:00,389 --> 02:28:00,399
institutions to do the right thing do
 

7185
02:28:00,399 --> 02:28:03,110
institutions to do the right thing do
you trust people to do the right thing

7186
02:28:03,110 --> 02:28:03,120
you trust people to do the right thing
 

7187
02:28:03,120 --> 02:28:04,469
you trust people to do the right thing
and and yeah there's bad people who are

7188
02:28:04,469 --> 02:28:04,479
and and yeah there's bad people who are
 

7189
02:28:04,479 --> 02:28:06,190
and and yeah there's bad people who are
going to do bad things but they're not

7190
02:28:06,190 --> 02:28:06,200
going to do bad things but they're not
 

7191
02:28:06,200 --> 02:28:07,910
going to do bad things but they're not
going to have Superior technology to the

7192
02:28:07,910 --> 02:28:07,920
going to have Superior technology to the
 

7193
02:28:07,920 --> 02:28:09,670
going to have Superior technology to the
good people so then it's going to be my

7194
02:28:09,670 --> 02:28:09,680
good people so then it's going to be my
 

7195
02:28:09,680 --> 02:28:12,670
good people so then it's going to be my
good AI against your bad AI right I mean

7196
02:28:12,670 --> 02:28:12,680
good AI against your bad AI right I mean
 

7197
02:28:12,680 --> 02:28:15,590
good AI against your bad AI right I mean
there the examples that we were just

7198
02:28:15,590 --> 02:28:15,600
there the examples that we were just
 

7199
02:28:15,600 --> 02:28:18,269
there the examples that we were just
talking about of you you know maybe uh

7200
02:28:18,269 --> 02:28:18,279
talking about of you you know maybe uh
 

7201
02:28:18,279 --> 02:28:20,510
talking about of you you know maybe uh
some Rogue country will build you know

7202
02:28:20,510 --> 02:28:20,520
some Rogue country will build you know
 

7203
02:28:20,520 --> 02:28:22,830
some Rogue country will build you know
some AI system that's going to try to

7204
02:28:22,830 --> 02:28:22,840
some AI system that's going to try to
 

7205
02:28:22,840 --> 02:28:24,670
some AI system that's going to try to
convince everybody

7206
02:28:24,670 --> 02:28:24,680
convince everybody
 

7207
02:28:24,680 --> 02:28:27,670
convince everybody
to go into a civil war or something or

7208
02:28:27,670 --> 02:28:27,680
to go into a civil war or something or
 

7209
02:28:27,680 --> 02:28:33,230
to go into a civil war or something or
or or elect a favorable U ruler and um

7210
02:28:33,230 --> 02:28:33,240
or or elect a favorable U ruler and um
 

7211
02:28:33,240 --> 02:28:34,790
or or elect a favorable U ruler and um
but then they will have to go past our

7212
02:28:34,790 --> 02:28:34,800
but then they will have to go past our
 

7213
02:28:34,800 --> 02:28:37,630
but then they will have to go past our
AI systems right an AI system with a

7214
02:28:37,630 --> 02:28:37,640
AI systems right an AI system with a
 

7215
02:28:37,640 --> 02:28:39,110
AI systems right an AI system with a
strong Russian accent will be trying to

7216
02:28:39,110 --> 02:28:39,120
strong Russian accent will be trying to
 

7217
02:28:39,120 --> 02:28:42,190
strong Russian accent will be trying to
conv our and doesn't put any uh articles

7218
02:28:42,190 --> 02:28:42,200
conv our and doesn't put any uh articles
 

7219
02:28:42,200 --> 02:28:44,030
conv our and doesn't put any uh articles
in their

7220
02:28:44,030 --> 02:28:44,040
in their
 

7221
02:28:44,040 --> 02:28:47,309
in their
sentences um well it'll be at the very

7222
02:28:47,309 --> 02:28:47,319
sentences um well it'll be at the very
 

7223
02:28:47,319 --> 02:28:50,870
sentences um well it'll be at the very
least absurdly comedic okay uh

7224
02:28:50,870 --> 02:28:50,880
least absurdly comedic okay uh
 

7225
02:28:50,880 --> 02:28:53,750
least absurdly comedic okay uh
so I uh since we talked about sort of

7226
02:28:53,750 --> 02:28:53,760
so I uh since we talked about sort of
 

7227
02:28:53,760 --> 02:28:56,110
so I uh since we talked about sort of
the uh physical reality I'd love to ask

7228
02:28:56,110 --> 02:28:56,120
the uh physical reality I'd love to ask
 

7229
02:28:56,120 --> 02:28:58,550
the uh physical reality I'd love to ask
your vision of the future with with

7230
02:28:58,550 --> 02:28:58,560
your vision of the future with with
 

7231
02:28:58,560 --> 02:29:00,870
your vision of the future with with
robots in in this physical reality so

7232
02:29:00,870 --> 02:29:00,880
robots in in this physical reality so
 

7233
02:29:00,880 --> 02:29:03,510
robots in in this physical reality so
many of the kinds of intelligence you've

7234
02:29:03,510 --> 02:29:03,520
many of the kinds of intelligence you've
 

7235
02:29:03,520 --> 02:29:06,550
many of the kinds of intelligence you've
been speaking about would Empower robots

7236
02:29:06,550 --> 02:29:06,560
been speaking about would Empower robots
 

7237
02:29:06,560 --> 02:29:09,429
been speaking about would Empower robots
to be more effective collaborators with

7238
02:29:09,429 --> 02:29:09,439
to be more effective collaborators with
 

7239
02:29:09,439 --> 02:29:13,670
to be more effective collaborators with
us humans so um since uh Tesla's Optimus

7240
02:29:13,670 --> 02:29:13,680
us humans so um since uh Tesla's Optimus
 

7241
02:29:13,680 --> 02:29:15,269
us humans so um since uh Tesla's Optimus
uh team has been showing off some

7242
02:29:15,269 --> 02:29:15,279
uh team has been showing off some
 

7243
02:29:15,279 --> 02:29:17,070
uh team has been showing off some
progress on humanoid robots

7244
02:29:17,070 --> 02:29:17,080
progress on humanoid robots
 

7245
02:29:17,080 --> 02:29:19,309
progress on humanoid robots
I think it really reinvigorated the

7246
02:29:19,309 --> 02:29:19,319
I think it really reinvigorated the
 

7247
02:29:19,319 --> 02:29:21,230
I think it really reinvigorated the
whole industry that's that I think

7248
02:29:21,230 --> 02:29:21,240
whole industry that's that I think
 

7249
02:29:21,240 --> 02:29:22,990
whole industry that's that I think
Boston Dynamics has been leading for a

7250
02:29:22,990 --> 02:29:23,000
Boston Dynamics has been leading for a
 

7251
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:24,830
Boston Dynamics has been leading for a
very very long time so now there's all

7252
02:29:24,830 --> 02:29:24,840
very very long time so now there's all
 

7253
02:29:24,840 --> 02:29:27,389
very very long time so now there's all
kinds of companies figure AI obviously

7254
02:29:27,389 --> 02:29:27,399
kinds of companies figure AI obviously
 

7255
02:29:27,399 --> 02:29:32,150
kinds of companies figure AI obviously
Boston Dynamics um un tree un tree uh

7256
02:29:32,150 --> 02:29:32,160
Boston Dynamics um un tree un tree uh
 

7257
02:29:32,160 --> 02:29:33,710
Boston Dynamics um un tree un tree uh
but there's like a lot of them it's

7258
02:29:33,710 --> 02:29:33,720
but there's like a lot of them it's
 

7259
02:29:33,720 --> 02:29:38,590
but there's like a lot of them it's
great it's great I mean I love it uh so

7260
02:29:38,590 --> 02:29:38,600
great it's great I mean I love it uh so
 

7261
02:29:38,600 --> 02:29:41,469
great it's great I mean I love it uh so
do you think there'll be uh millions of

7262
02:29:41,469 --> 02:29:41,479
do you think there'll be uh millions of
 

7263
02:29:41,479 --> 02:29:44,110
do you think there'll be uh millions of
humanoid robots walking around soon not

7264
02:29:44,110 --> 02:29:44,120
humanoid robots walking around soon not
 

7265
02:29:44,120 --> 02:29:45,910
humanoid robots walking around soon not
soon but it's going to it's going to

7266
02:29:45,910 --> 02:29:45,920
soon but it's going to it's going to
 

7267
02:29:45,920 --> 02:29:47,349
soon but it's going to it's going to
happen like the next decade I think is

7268
02:29:47,349 --> 02:29:47,359
happen like the next decade I think is
 

7269
02:29:47,359 --> 02:29:49,550
happen like the next decade I think is
going to be really interesting in robots

7270
02:29:49,550 --> 02:29:49,560
going to be really interesting in robots
 

7271
02:29:49,560 --> 02:29:53,110
going to be really interesting in robots
like the the emergence of the robotics

7272
02:29:53,110 --> 02:29:53,120
like the the emergence of the robotics
 

7273
02:29:53,120 --> 02:29:56,389
like the the emergence of the robotics
industry has been in the waiting for you

7274
02:29:56,389 --> 02:29:56,399
industry has been in the waiting for you
 

7275
02:29:56,399 --> 02:29:58,630
industry has been in the waiting for you
know 10 20 years without really emerging

7276
02:29:58,630 --> 02:29:58,640
know 10 20 years without really emerging
 

7277
02:29:58,640 --> 02:30:00,630
know 10 20 years without really emerging
other than for like you know kind of

7278
02:30:00,630 --> 02:30:00,640
other than for like you know kind of
 

7279
02:30:00,640 --> 02:30:03,230
other than for like you know kind of
preprogram behavior and stuff like that

7280
02:30:03,230 --> 02:30:03,240
preprogram behavior and stuff like that
 

7281
02:30:03,240 --> 02:30:07,670
preprogram behavior and stuff like that
um and uh and the main issue is again

7282
02:30:07,670 --> 02:30:07,680
um and uh and the main issue is again
 

7283
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:09,110
um and uh and the main issue is again
the Maric Paradox like you know how do

7284
02:30:09,110 --> 02:30:09,120
the Maric Paradox like you know how do
 

7285
02:30:09,120 --> 02:30:10,389
the Maric Paradox like you know how do
we get those system to understand how

7286
02:30:10,389 --> 02:30:10,399
we get those system to understand how
 

7287
02:30:10,399 --> 02:30:12,309
we get those system to understand how
the world works and and kind of you know

7288
02:30:12,309 --> 02:30:12,319
the world works and and kind of you know
 

7289
02:30:12,319 --> 02:30:14,269
the world works and and kind of you know
plan actions and so we can do it for

7290
02:30:14,269 --> 02:30:14,279
plan actions and so we can do it for
 

7291
02:30:14,279 --> 02:30:19,309
plan actions and so we can do it for
really specialized tasks um and uh the

7292
02:30:19,309 --> 02:30:19,319
really specialized tasks um and uh the
 

7293
02:30:19,319 --> 02:30:21,550
really specialized tasks um and uh the
way Boston Dynamics goes about it is you

7294
02:30:21,550 --> 02:30:21,560
way Boston Dynamics goes about it is you
 

7295
02:30:21,560 --> 02:30:23,590
way Boston Dynamics goes about it is you
know basically with a lot of um

7296
02:30:23,590 --> 02:30:23,600
know basically with a lot of um
 

7297
02:30:23,600 --> 02:30:27,230
know basically with a lot of um
handcrafted dynamical models and careful

02:30:31,230 --> 02:30:31,240
classical robotics with a lot of
 

7303
02:30:31,240 --> 02:30:34,150
classical robotics with a lot of
innovation a little bit of perception um

7304
02:30:34,150 --> 02:30:34,160
innovation a little bit of perception um
 

7305
02:30:34,160 --> 02:30:36,469
innovation a little bit of perception um
but it's still not like they can't build

7306
02:30:36,469 --> 02:30:36,479
but it's still not like they can't build
 

7307
02:30:36,479 --> 02:30:41,870
but it's still not like they can't build
a domestic robot right um and you know

7308
02:30:41,870 --> 02:30:41,880
a domestic robot right um and you know
 

7309
02:30:41,880 --> 02:30:43,990
a domestic robot right um and you know
we're still some distance away from

7310
02:30:43,990 --> 02:30:44,000
we're still some distance away from
 

7311
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,429
we're still some distance away from

completely autonomous level five driving
 

7313
02:30:46,439 --> 02:30:49,429

mhm uh and we're certainly very far away

7314
02:30:49,429 --> 02:30:49,439
mhm uh and we're certainly very far away
 

7315
02:30:49,439 --> 02:30:52,309
mhm uh and we're certainly very far away
from having uh you know level five

train Itself by driving 20 hours like
 

7321
02:30:58,240 --> 02:30:59,790
train Itself by driving 20 hours like
any 17y

any 17y
 

7323
02:30:59,800 --> 02:31:03,870
any 17y
old uh so until we

7324
02:31:03,870 --> 02:31:03,880
old uh so until we
 

7325
02:31:03,880 --> 02:31:08,469
old uh so until we
have uh again World models systems that

7326
02:31:08,469 --> 02:31:08,479
have uh again World models systems that
 

7327
02:31:08,479 --> 02:31:10,190
have uh again World models systems that
can train themselves to understand how

7328
02:31:10,190 --> 02:31:10,200
can train themselves to understand how
 

7329
02:31:10,200 --> 02:31:11,469
can train themselves to understand how
the world

7330
02:31:11,469 --> 02:31:11,479
the world
 

7331
02:31:11,479 --> 02:31:13,870
the world
Works uh we're not going to we're not

7332
02:31:13,870 --> 02:31:13,880
Works uh we're not going to we're not
 

7333
02:31:13,880 --> 02:31:15,990
Works uh we're not going to we're not
going to have significant progress in

02:31:15,990 --> 02:31:16,000
going to have significant progress in
 

7335
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:16,950
going to have significant progress in

robotic
 

7337
02:31:16,960 --> 02:31:19,550
robotic
so a lot of the people working on

7338
02:31:19,550 --> 02:31:19,560
so a lot of the people working on
 

7339
02:31:19,560 --> 02:31:22,230
so a lot of the people working on
robotic Hardware at the moment are are

7340
02:31:22,230 --> 02:31:22,240
robotic Hardware at the moment are are
 

7341
02:31:22,240 --> 02:31:25,550
robotic Hardware at the moment are are
betting or banking on the fact that AI

7342
02:31:25,550 --> 02:31:25,560
betting or banking on the fact that AI
 

7343
02:31:25,560 --> 02:31:26,910
betting or banking on the fact that AI
is going to make sufficient progress

7344
02:31:26,910 --> 02:31:26,920
is going to make sufficient progress
 

7345
02:31:26,920 --> 02:31:29,230
is going to make sufficient progress
towards that and they're hoping to

7346
02:31:29,230 --> 02:31:29,240
towards that and they're hoping to
 

7347
02:31:29,240 --> 02:31:32,550
towards that and they're hoping to
discover a product in it too is uh yeah

7348
02:31:32,550 --> 02:31:32,560
discover a product in it too is uh yeah
 

7349
02:31:32,560 --> 02:31:34,190
discover a product in it too is uh yeah
before you have a really strong World

7350
02:31:34,190 --> 02:31:34,200
before you have a really strong World
 

7351
02:31:34,200 --> 02:31:37,070
before you have a really strong World
model there'll be an almost Strong World

7352
02:31:37,070 --> 02:31:37,080
model there'll be an almost Strong World
 

7353
02:31:37,080 --> 02:31:40,950
model there'll be an almost Strong World
model and um people are trying to find a

7354
02:31:40,950 --> 02:31:40,960
model and um people are trying to find a
 

7355
02:31:40,960 --> 02:31:43,870
model and um people are trying to find a
product in a clumsy robot I suppose like

7356
02:31:43,870 --> 02:31:43,880
product in a clumsy robot I suppose like
 

7357
02:31:43,880 --> 02:31:45,790
product in a clumsy robot I suppose like
not a perfectly efficient robot so

7358
02:31:45,790 --> 02:31:45,800
not a perfectly efficient robot so
 

7359
02:31:45,800 --> 02:31:47,349
not a perfectly efficient robot so
there's the fact factory setting where

7360
02:31:47,349 --> 02:31:47,359
there's the fact factory setting where
 

7361
02:31:47,359 --> 02:31:49,389
there's the fact factory setting where
uh humanoid robots can help automate

7362
02:31:49,389 --> 02:31:49,399
uh humanoid robots can help automate
 

7363
02:31:49,399 --> 02:31:51,550
uh humanoid robots can help automate
some aspects of the factory I think

7364
02:31:51,550 --> 02:31:51,560
some aspects of the factory I think
 

7365
02:31:51,560 --> 02:31:53,710
some aspects of the factory I think
that's a crazy difficult task because of

7366
02:31:53,710 --> 02:31:53,720
that's a crazy difficult task because of
 

7367
02:31:53,720 --> 02:31:55,230
that's a crazy difficult task because of
all the safety required and all this

7368
02:31:55,230 --> 02:31:55,240
all the safety required and all this
 

7369
02:31:55,240 --> 02:31:57,269
all the safety required and all this
kind of stuff I think in the home is

7370
02:31:57,269 --> 02:31:57,279
kind of stuff I think in the home is
 

7371
02:31:57,279 --> 02:31:59,389
kind of stuff I think in the home is
more interesting but then you start to

7372
02:31:59,389 --> 02:31:59,399
more interesting but then you start to
 

7373
02:31:59,399 --> 02:32:01,790
more interesting but then you start to
think I think you mentioned loading the

7374
02:32:01,790 --> 02:32:01,800
think I think you mentioned loading the
 

7375
02:32:01,800 --> 02:32:04,990
think I think you mentioned loading the
dishwasher right yeah like I suppose

7376
02:32:04,990 --> 02:32:05,000
dishwasher right yeah like I suppose
 

7377
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:06,710
dishwasher right yeah like I suppose
that's one of the main problems you're

7378
02:32:06,710 --> 02:32:06,720
that's one of the main problems you're
 

7379
02:32:06,720 --> 02:32:09,790
that's one of the main problems you're
working on I mean there's you know uh

7380
02:32:09,790 --> 02:32:09,800
working on I mean there's you know uh
 

7381
02:32:09,800 --> 02:32:13,590
working on I mean there's you know uh
cleaning up cleaning the house uh clear

7382
02:32:13,590 --> 02:32:13,600
cleaning up cleaning the house uh clear
 

7383
02:32:13,600 --> 02:32:16,950
cleaning up cleaning the house uh clear
clearing up the table after

7384
02:32:16,950 --> 02:32:16,960
clearing up the table after
 

7385
02:32:16,960 --> 02:32:19,750

7386
02:32:19,750 --> 02:32:19,760
meal washing the dishes you know all
 

7387
02:32:19,760 --> 02:32:21,790

those tasks you know cooking I mean all

7388
02:32:21,790 --> 02:32:21,800
those tasks you know cooking I mean all
 

7389
02:32:21,800 --> 02:32:23,309
those tasks you know cooking I mean all
the tasks that you know in principle

7390
02:32:23,309 --> 02:32:23,319
the tasks that you know in principle
 

7391
02:32:23,319 --> 02:32:24,670
the tasks that you know in principle
could be automated but are actually

7392
02:32:24,670 --> 02:32:24,680
could be automated but are actually
 

7393
02:32:24,680 --> 02:32:27,150
could be automated but are actually
incredibly sophisticated really

7394
02:32:27,150 --> 02:32:27,160
incredibly sophisticated really
 

7395
02:32:27,160 --> 02:32:29,030
incredibly sophisticated really
complicated but even just basic

7396
02:32:29,030 --> 02:32:29,040
complicated but even just basic

02:32:31,309 --> 02:32:31,319
navigation around an un Space full of
 

7399
02:32:31,319 --> 02:32:33,269

7400
02:32:33,269 --> 02:32:33,279
uncertainty that's sort of works like
 

7401
02:32:33,279 --> 02:32:35,990
uncertainty that's sort of works like
you can sort of do this now navigation

7402
02:32:35,990 --> 02:32:36,000
you can sort of do this now navigation
 

7403
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:39,429
you can sort of do this now navigation
is fine well navigation in a way that's

7404
02:32:39,429 --> 02:32:39,439
is fine well navigation in a way that's
 

7405
02:32:39,439 --> 02:32:41,710
is fine well navigation in a way that's
compelling to us humans is is is a

7406
02:32:41,710 --> 02:32:41,720
compelling to us humans is is is a
 

7407
02:32:41,720 --> 02:32:43,630
compelling to us humans is is is a
different thing yeah it's not going to

7408
02:32:43,630 --> 02:32:43,640
different thing yeah it's not going to
 

7409
02:32:43,640 --> 02:32:45,670
different thing yeah it's not going to
be you know necessarily I mean we have

7410
02:32:45,670 --> 02:32:45,680
be you know necessarily I mean we have
 

7411
02:32:45,680 --> 02:32:47,550
be you know necessarily I mean we have
demos actually because you know there is

7412
02:32:47,550 --> 02:32:47,560
demos actually because you know there is
 

7413
02:32:47,560 --> 02:32:52,190
demos actually because you know there is
a So-Cal embodied AI group at at fair

7414
02:32:52,190 --> 02:32:52,200
a So-Cal embodied AI group at at fair
 

7415
02:32:52,200 --> 02:32:54,070
a So-Cal embodied AI group at at fair
and uh you know they've been not

7416
02:32:54,070 --> 02:32:54,080
and uh you know they've been not
 

7417
02:32:54,080 --> 02:32:55,870
and uh you know they've been not
building their own robots but using

7418
02:32:55,870 --> 02:32:55,880
building their own robots but using
 

7419
02:32:55,880 --> 02:32:58,550
building their own robots but using
commercial robots um and you can you can

7420
02:32:58,550 --> 02:32:58,560
commercial robots um and you can you can
 

7421
02:32:58,560 --> 02:33:01,349
commercial robots um and you can you can
tell a robot dog like you know go to the

7422
02:33:01,349 --> 02:33:01,359
tell a robot dog like you know go to the
 

7423
02:33:01,359 --> 02:33:03,190
tell a robot dog like you know go to the
fridge and they can actually open the

7424
02:33:03,190 --> 02:33:03,200
fridge and they can actually open the
 

7425
02:33:03,200 --> 02:33:04,910
fridge and they can actually open the
fridge and they can probably pick up a

7426
02:33:04,910 --> 02:33:04,920
fridge and they can probably pick up a
 

7427
02:33:04,920 --> 02:33:06,670
fridge and they can probably pick up a
can in the fridge and stuff like that

7428
02:33:06,670 --> 02:33:06,680
can in the fridge and stuff like that
 

7429
02:33:06,680 --> 02:33:09,630
can in the fridge and stuff like that
and and bring it to you you know so it

7430
02:33:09,630 --> 02:33:09,640
and and bring it to you you know so it
 

7431
02:33:09,640 --> 02:33:13,030
and and bring it to you you know so it
can navigate can grab objects as long as

7432
02:33:13,030 --> 02:33:13,040
can navigate can grab objects as long as
 

7433
02:33:13,040 --> 02:33:14,910
can navigate can grab objects as long as
it's been trying to recognize them which

7434
02:33:14,910 --> 02:33:14,920
it's been trying to recognize them which
 

7435
02:33:14,920 --> 02:33:16,950
it's been trying to recognize them which
you know Vision systems work pretty well

7436
02:33:16,950 --> 02:33:16,960
you know Vision systems work pretty well
 

7437
02:33:16,960 --> 02:33:20,110
you know Vision systems work pretty well
nowadays um but but it's not like a

7438
02:33:20,110 --> 02:33:20,120
nowadays um but but it's not like a
 

7439
02:33:20,120 --> 02:33:21,990
nowadays um but but it's not like a
completely you know

7440
02:33:21,990 --> 02:33:22,000
completely you know
 

7441
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,630
completely you know
General robot that would be you know

7442
02:33:24,630 --> 02:33:24,640
General robot that would be you know
 

7443
02:33:24,640 --> 02:33:27,590
General robot that would be you know
sophisticated enough to do things like

7444
02:33:27,590 --> 02:33:27,600
sophisticated enough to do things like
 

7445
02:33:27,600 --> 02:33:29,910
sophisticated enough to do things like
clearing up the dinner

7446
02:33:29,910 --> 02:33:29,920
clearing up the dinner
 

7447
02:33:29,920 --> 02:33:32,429
clearing up the dinner
table Yeah to me that's an exciting

7448
02:33:32,429 --> 02:33:32,439
table Yeah to me that's an exciting
 

7449
02:33:32,439 --> 02:33:35,269
table Yeah to me that's an exciting
future of getting humanoid robots robots

7450
02:33:35,269 --> 02:33:35,279
future of getting humanoid robots robots
 

7451
02:33:35,279 --> 02:33:36,630
future of getting humanoid robots robots
in general in the whole more and more

7452
02:33:36,630 --> 02:33:36,640
in general in the whole more and more
 

7453
02:33:36,640 --> 02:33:39,070
in general in the whole more and more
because that gets uh humans to really

7454
02:33:39,070 --> 02:33:39,080
because that gets uh humans to really
 

7455
02:33:39,080 --> 02:33:41,230
because that gets uh humans to really
directly interact with AI systems in the

7456
02:33:41,230 --> 02:33:41,240
directly interact with AI systems in the
 

7457
02:33:41,240 --> 02:33:44,070
directly interact with AI systems in the
physical space and in so doing it allows

7458
02:33:44,070 --> 02:33:44,080
physical space and in so doing it allows
 

7459
02:33:44,080 --> 02:33:45,790
physical space and in so doing it allows
us to philosophically psychologically

7460
02:33:45,790 --> 02:33:45,800
us to philosophically psychologically
 

7461
02:33:45,800 --> 02:33:47,950
us to philosophically psychologically
explore our relationships with robots

7462
02:33:47,950 --> 02:33:47,960
explore our relationships with robots
 

7463
02:33:47,960 --> 02:33:50,670
explore our relationships with robots
can be really really really interesting

7464
02:33:50,670 --> 02:33:50,680
can be really really really interesting
 

7465
02:33:50,680 --> 02:33:52,630
can be really really really interesting
so I hope you make progress on the whole

7466
02:33:52,630 --> 02:33:52,640
so I hope you make progress on the whole
 

7467
02:33:52,640 --> 02:33:55,510
so I hope you make progress on the whole
uh japa thing soon well I I mean I hope

7468
02:33:55,510 --> 02:33:55,520
uh japa thing soon well I I mean I hope
 

7469
02:33:55,520 --> 02:33:57,550
uh japa thing soon well I I mean I hope
I hope things kind of you know work as

7470
02:33:57,550 --> 02:33:57,560
I hope things kind of you know work as
 

7471
02:33:57,560 --> 02:33:59,389
I hope things kind of you know work as
uh as planned

7472
02:33:59,389 --> 02:33:59,399
uh as planned
 

7473
02:33:59,399 --> 02:34:02,110
uh as planned
um I mean again we've been kind of

7474
02:34:02,110 --> 02:34:02,120
um I mean again we've been kind of
 

7475
02:34:02,120 --> 02:34:03,750
um I mean again we've been kind of
working on this idea of self supervised

7476
02:34:03,750 --> 02:34:03,760
working on this idea of self supervised
 

7477
02:34:03,760 --> 02:34:08,030
working on this idea of self supervised
learning of from video for for 10 years

7478
02:34:08,030 --> 02:34:08,040
learning of from video for for 10 years
 

7479
02:34:08,040 --> 02:34:10,150
learning of from video for for 10 years
and and you know only made significant

7480
02:34:10,150 --> 02:34:10,160
and and you know only made significant
 

7481
02:34:10,160 --> 02:34:12,190
and and you know only made significant
progress in the last two or three and

7482
02:34:12,190 --> 02:34:12,200
progress in the last two or three and
 

7483
02:34:12,200 --> 02:34:13,590
progress in the last two or three and
actually you've you've mentioned that

7484
02:34:13,590 --> 02:34:13,600
actually you've you've mentioned that
 

7485
02:34:13,600 --> 02:34:14,510
actually you've you've mentioned that
there's a lot of interesting

7486
02:34:14,510 --> 02:34:14,520
there's a lot of interesting
 

7487
02:34:14,520 --> 02:34:16,190
there's a lot of interesting
breakthroughs that can happen without

7488
02:34:16,190 --> 02:34:16,200
breakthroughs that can happen without
 

7489
02:34:16,200 --> 02:34:18,309
breakthroughs that can happen without
having access to a lot of compute yeah

7490
02:34:18,309 --> 02:34:18,319
having access to a lot of compute yeah
 

7491
02:34:18,319 --> 02:34:20,269
having access to a lot of compute yeah
so if you're interested in doing a PhD

7492
02:34:20,269 --> 02:34:20,279
so if you're interested in doing a PhD
 

7493
02:34:20,279 --> 02:34:22,429
so if you're interested in doing a PhD
and this kind of stuff there's a lot of

7494
02:34:22,429 --> 02:34:22,439
and this kind of stuff there's a lot of
 

7495
02:34:22,439 --> 02:34:24,309
and this kind of stuff there's a lot of
possibilities still yeah to do

7496
02:34:24,309 --> 02:34:24,319
possibilities still yeah to do
 

7497
02:34:24,319 --> 02:34:26,269
possibilities still yeah to do
Innovative work so like what advice

7498
02:34:26,269 --> 02:34:26,279
Innovative work so like what advice
 

7499
02:34:26,279 --> 02:34:28,269
Innovative work so like what advice
would you give to a undergrad that's

7500
02:34:28,269 --> 02:34:28,279
would you give to a undergrad that's
 

7501
02:34:28,279 --> 02:34:31,389
would you give to a undergrad that's
looking to uh go to grad school and do a

7502
02:34:31,389 --> 02:34:31,399
looking to uh go to grad school and do a
 

7503
02:34:31,399 --> 02:34:34,190
looking to uh go to grad school and do a
PhD so basically I've listed them

7504
02:34:34,190 --> 02:34:34,200
PhD so basically I've listed them
 

7505
02:34:34,200 --> 02:34:37,070
PhD so basically I've listed them
already uh this idea of how do you train

7506
02:34:37,070 --> 02:34:37,080
already uh this idea of how do you train
 

7507
02:34:37,080 --> 02:34:38,750
already uh this idea of how do you train
a world model by

7508
02:34:38,750 --> 02:34:38,760
a world model by
 

7509
02:34:38,760 --> 02:34:40,710
a world model by
observation and you don't have to train

7510
02:34:40,710 --> 02:34:40,720
observation and you don't have to train
 

7511
02:34:40,720 --> 02:34:44,550
observation and you don't have to train
necessarily on gigantic data sets

7512
02:34:44,550 --> 02:34:44,560
necessarily on gigantic data sets
 

7513
02:34:44,560 --> 02:34:46,990
necessarily on gigantic data sets
or I mean you could out to be necessary

7514
02:34:46,990 --> 02:34:47,000
or I mean you could out to be necessary
 

7515
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:48,870
or I mean you could out to be necessary
to actually train on large data sets to

7516
02:34:48,870 --> 02:34:48,880
to actually train on large data sets to
 

7517
02:34:48,880 --> 02:34:50,590
to actually train on large data sets to
have emerging properties like like we

7518
02:34:50,590 --> 02:34:50,600
have emerging properties like like we
 

7519
02:34:50,600 --> 02:34:52,389
have emerging properties like like we
have with LMS but I think there's a lot

7520
02:34:52,389 --> 02:34:52,399
have with LMS but I think there's a lot
 

7521
02:34:52,399 --> 02:34:54,190
have with LMS but I think there's a lot
of good ideas that can be done

7522
02:34:54,190 --> 02:34:54,200
of good ideas that can be done
 

7523
02:34:54,200 --> 02:34:56,830
of good ideas that can be done

7524
02:34:56,830 --> 02:34:56,840
without necessarily scaling up then
 

7525
02:34:56,840 --> 02:34:59,150
without necessarily scaling up then
there is how you do planning with a

7526
02:34:59,150 --> 02:34:59,160
there is how you do planning with a
 

7527
02:34:59,160 --> 02:35:01,510
there is how you do planning with a
learn World model if the world the

7528
02:35:01,510 --> 02:35:01,520
learn World model if the world the
 

7529
02:35:01,520 --> 02:35:03,349
learn World model if the world the
system evolves in is not the physical

7530
02:35:03,349 --> 02:35:03,359
system evolves in is not the physical
 

7531
02:35:03,359 --> 02:35:06,150
system evolves in is not the physical
world but it's the world of let's say

7532
02:35:06,150 --> 02:35:06,160
world but it's the world of let's say
 

7533
02:35:06,160 --> 02:35:09,630
world but it's the world of let's say
the internet or you know some sort of uh

7534
02:35:09,630 --> 02:35:09,640
the internet or you know some sort of uh
 

7535
02:35:09,640 --> 02:35:12,150
the internet or you know some sort of uh
world of where an action consists in

7536
02:35:12,150 --> 02:35:12,160
world of where an action consists in
 

7537
02:35:12,160 --> 02:35:14,110
world of where an action consists in
doing a search in a search engine or

7538
02:35:14,110 --> 02:35:14,120
doing a search in a search engine or
 

7539
02:35:14,120 --> 02:35:16,429
doing a search in a search engine or
interrogating a data database or running

7540
02:35:16,429 --> 02:35:16,439
interrogating a data database or running
 

7541
02:35:16,439 --> 02:35:19,750
interrogating a data database or running
a simulation or calling a calculator or

7542
02:35:19,750 --> 02:35:19,760
a simulation or calling a calculator or
 

7543
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:21,429
a simulation or calling a calculator or
solving a differential

7544
02:35:21,429 --> 02:35:21,439
solving a differential
 

7545
02:35:21,439 --> 02:35:23,710
solving a differential
equation how do you get a system to

7546
02:35:23,710 --> 02:35:23,720
equation how do you get a system to
 

7547
02:35:23,720 --> 02:35:26,309
equation how do you get a system to
actually plan a sequence of actions to

7548
02:35:26,309 --> 02:35:26,319
actually plan a sequence of actions to
 

7549
02:35:26,319 --> 02:35:28,950
actually plan a sequence of actions to
you know give the solution to a problem

7550
02:35:28,950 --> 02:35:28,960
you know give the solution to a problem
 

7551
02:35:28,960 --> 02:35:32,269
you know give the solution to a problem
um and so the question of planning is

7552
02:35:32,269 --> 02:35:32,279
um and so the question of planning is
 

7553
02:35:32,279 --> 02:35:35,110
um and so the question of planning is
not just a question of planning physical

7554
02:35:35,110 --> 02:35:35,120
not just a question of planning physical
 

7555
02:35:35,120 --> 02:35:37,670
not just a question of planning physical
actions could be you know planning

7556
02:35:37,670 --> 02:35:37,680
actions could be you know planning
 

7557
02:35:37,680 --> 02:35:40,070
actions could be you know planning
actions to use tools for a dialog system

7558
02:35:40,070 --> 02:35:40,080
actions to use tools for a dialog system
 

7559
02:35:40,080 --> 02:35:42,269
actions to use tools for a dialog system
or for any kind of intelligent

7560
02:35:42,269 --> 02:35:42,279
or for any kind of intelligent
 

7561
02:35:42,279 --> 02:35:45,389
or for any kind of intelligent
system and um there's some work on this

7562
02:35:45,389 --> 02:35:45,399
system and um there's some work on this
 

7563
02:35:45,399 --> 02:35:47,389
system and um there's some work on this
but not like not a huge amount some work

7564
02:35:47,389 --> 02:35:47,399
but not like not a huge amount some work
 

7565
02:35:47,399 --> 02:35:51,389
but not like not a huge amount some work
at Fair um one called tool former which

7566
02:35:51,389 --> 02:35:51,399
at Fair um one called tool former which
 

7567
02:35:51,399 --> 02:35:53,630
at Fair um one called tool former which
was couple years ago and some more

7568
02:35:53,630 --> 02:35:53,640
was couple years ago and some more
 

7569
02:35:53,640 --> 02:35:56,910
was couple years ago and some more
recent work on planning U but um but I

7570
02:35:56,910 --> 02:35:56,920
recent work on planning U but um but I
 

7571
02:35:56,920 --> 02:35:59,590
recent work on planning U but um but I
don't think we have like a good solution

7572
02:35:59,590 --> 02:35:59,600
don't think we have like a good solution
 

7573
02:35:59,600 --> 02:36:02,309
don't think we have like a good solution
for any of that then there is the

7574
02:36:02,309 --> 02:36:02,319
for any of that then there is the
 

7575
02:36:02,319 --> 02:36:04,790
for any of that then there is the
question of hierarchical planning so the

7576
02:36:04,790 --> 02:36:04,800
question of hierarchical planning so the
 

7577
02:36:04,800 --> 02:36:07,110
question of hierarchical planning so the
example I I mentioned of you know

7578
02:36:07,110 --> 02:36:07,120
example I I mentioned of you know
 

7579
02:36:07,120 --> 02:36:10,510
example I I mentioned of you know
planning a trip from New York to Paris

7580
02:36:10,510 --> 02:36:10,520
planning a trip from New York to Paris
 

7581
02:36:10,520 --> 02:36:12,269
planning a trip from New York to Paris
that's hierarchical but almost every

7582
02:36:12,269 --> 02:36:12,279
that's hierarchical but almost every
 

7583
02:36:12,279 --> 02:36:14,389
that's hierarchical but almost every
action that we take involves

7584
02:36:14,389 --> 02:36:14,399
action that we take involves
 

7585
02:36:14,399 --> 02:36:16,429
action that we take involves
hierarchical planning in some in some

7586
02:36:16,429 --> 02:36:16,439
hierarchical planning in some in some
 

7587
02:36:16,439 --> 02:36:19,510
hierarchical planning in some in some
sense and we really have absolutely no

7588
02:36:19,510 --> 02:36:19,520
sense and we really have absolutely no
 

7589
02:36:19,520 --> 02:36:21,710
sense and we really have absolutely no
idea how to do this like this's zero

7590
02:36:21,710 --> 02:36:21,720
idea how to do this like this's zero
 

7591
02:36:21,720 --> 02:36:24,230
idea how to do this like this's zero
demonstration of hierarchical

7592
02:36:24,230 --> 02:36:24,240
demonstration of hierarchical
 

7593
02:36:24,240 --> 02:36:27,150
demonstration of hierarchical
planning uh in

7594
02:36:27,150 --> 02:36:27,160
planning uh in
 

7595
02:36:27,160 --> 02:36:32,590
planning uh in
AI where the various levels of

7596
02:36:32,590 --> 02:36:32,600
AI where the various levels of
 

7597
02:36:32,600 --> 02:36:34,790
AI where the various levels of
representations that are necessary have

7598
02:36:34,790 --> 02:36:34,800
representations that are necessary have
 

7599
02:36:34,800 --> 02:36:37,790
representations that are necessary have
been learned we can do like two level

7600
02:36:37,790 --> 02:36:37,800
been learned we can do like two level
 

7601
02:36:37,800 --> 02:36:39,670
been learned we can do like two level
hierarchy hierarchical planning when we

7602
02:36:39,670 --> 02:36:39,680
hierarchy hierarchical planning when we
 

7603
02:36:39,680 --> 02:36:41,389
hierarchy hierarchical planning when we
design the two the two levels so for

7604
02:36:41,389 --> 02:36:41,399
design the two the two levels so for
 

7605
02:36:41,399 --> 02:36:44,389
design the two the two levels so for
example you have like a a dog lag robot

7606
02:36:44,389 --> 02:36:44,399
example you have like a a dog lag robot
 

7607
02:36:44,399 --> 02:36:46,830
example you have like a a dog lag robot
right you want it to go from

7608
02:36:46,830 --> 02:36:46,840
right you want it to go from
 

7609
02:36:46,840 --> 02:36:48,469
right you want it to go from
the living room to the kitchen you can

7610
02:36:48,469 --> 02:36:48,479
the living room to the kitchen you can
 

7611
02:36:48,479 --> 02:36:51,630
the living room to the kitchen you can
plan a path that avoids the obstacle and

7612
02:36:51,630 --> 02:36:51,640
plan a path that avoids the obstacle and
 

7613
02:36:51,640 --> 02:36:54,230
plan a path that avoids the obstacle and
then um you can send this to a lower

7614
02:36:54,230 --> 02:36:54,240
then um you can send this to a lower
 

7615
02:36:54,240 --> 02:36:56,110
then um you can send this to a lower
lower level planner that figures out how

7616
02:36:56,110 --> 02:36:56,120
lower level planner that figures out how
 

7617
02:36:56,120 --> 02:36:57,870
lower level planner that figures out how
to move the legs to kind of Follow that

7618
02:36:57,870 --> 02:36:57,880
to move the legs to kind of Follow that
 

7619
02:36:57,880 --> 02:37:00,389
to move the legs to kind of Follow that
trajectories right so that works but

7620
02:37:00,389 --> 02:37:00,399
trajectories right so that works but
 

7621
02:37:00,399 --> 02:37:03,550
trajectories right so that works but
that twole planning is designed by hand

7622
02:37:03,550 --> 02:37:03,560
that twole planning is designed by hand
 

7623
02:37:03,560 --> 02:37:08,389
that twole planning is designed by hand
right um we specify what the proper

7624
02:37:08,389 --> 02:37:08,399
right um we specify what the proper
 

7625
02:37:08,399 --> 02:37:10,429
right um we specify what the proper

learn that hierarchical representation

7632
02:37:16,510 --> 02:37:16,520
learn that hierarchical representation
 

7633
02:37:16,520 --> 02:37:18,550
learn that hierarchical representation
of action

7634
02:37:18,550 --> 02:37:18,560
of action

deep learning we we can train the system

7638
02:37:23,389 --> 02:37:23,399
deep learning we we can train the system
 

7639
02:37:23,399 --> 02:37:25,550
deep learning we we can train the system
to learn hierarchical representations of

percepts mhm what is the equivalent when

7642
02:37:28,670 --> 02:37:28,680
percepts mhm what is the equivalent when
 

7643
02:37:28,680 --> 02:37:29,990
percepts mhm what is the equivalent when
what you're trying to represent our

02:37:29,990 --> 02:37:30,000
what you're trying to represent our
 

7645
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,230
what you're trying to represent our
action plans for action plans yeah so

7646
02:37:32,230 --> 02:37:32,240
action plans for action plans yeah so
 

7647
02:37:32,240 --> 02:37:34,309
action plans for action plans yeah so
you want you want basically a robot dog

7648
02:37:34,309 --> 02:37:34,319
you want you want basically a robot dog
 

7649
02:37:34,319 --> 02:37:37,190
you want you want basically a robot dog
or humanoid robot that turns on and

7650
02:37:37,190 --> 02:37:37,200
or humanoid robot that turns on and
 

7651
02:37:37,200 --> 02:37:39,990
or humanoid robot that turns on and
travels from New York to Paris all by

7652
02:37:39,990 --> 02:37:40,000
travels from New York to Paris all by
 

7653
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:43,349
travels from New York to Paris all by
itself for example all right they might

7654
02:37:43,349 --> 02:37:43,359
itself for example all right they might
 

7655
02:37:43,359 --> 02:37:46,870
itself for example all right they might
have some uh trouble at the at the TSA

7656
02:37:46,870 --> 02:37:46,880
have some uh trouble at the at the TSA
 

7657
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:48,429
have some uh trouble at the at the TSA
but yeah no but even doing something

7658
02:37:48,429 --> 02:37:48,439
but yeah no but even doing something
 

7659
02:37:48,439 --> 02:37:50,990
but yeah no but even doing something
fairly simple like a household task sure

7660
02:37:50,990 --> 02:37:51,000
fairly simple like a household task sure
 

7661
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,830
fairly simple like a household task sure
like you know uh cooking or something

7662
02:37:53,830 --> 02:37:53,840
like you know uh cooking or something
 

7663
02:37:53,840 --> 02:37:55,469
like you know uh cooking or something
yeah that there's a lot involved it's a

7664
02:37:55,469 --> 02:37:55,479
yeah that there's a lot involved it's a
 

7665
02:37:55,479 --> 02:37:57,870
yeah that there's a lot involved it's a
super complex task we take and once

7666
02:37:57,870 --> 02:37:57,880
super complex task we take and once
 

7667
02:37:57,880 --> 02:37:59,590
super complex task we take and once
again we take it for

7668
02:37:59,590 --> 02:37:59,600
again we take it for
 

7669
02:37:59,600 --> 02:38:03,790
again we take it for
granted what hope do you have for um the

7670
02:38:03,790 --> 02:38:03,800
granted what hope do you have for um the
 

7671
02:38:03,800 --> 02:38:04,950
granted what hope do you have for um the
future of

7672
02:38:04,950 --> 02:38:04,960

years if you look at social media media

7682
02:38:16,070 --> 02:38:16,080
years if you look at social media media
 

7683
02:38:16,080 --> 02:38:17,670
years if you look at social media media
there's a lot of there's there's Wars

there's a lot of there's there's Wars
 

7685
02:38:17,680 --> 02:38:19,469
there's a lot of there's there's Wars
going on there's

7686
02:38:19,469 --> 02:38:19,479
going on there's
 

7687
02:38:19,479 --> 02:38:22,070
going on there's
division uh there's hatred all this kind

7688
02:38:22,070 --> 02:38:22,080
division uh there's hatred all this kind
 

7689
02:38:22,080 --> 02:38:24,590
division uh there's hatred all this kind
of stuff that's also part of humanity

7690
02:38:24,590 --> 02:38:24,600
of stuff that's also part of humanity
 

7691
02:38:24,600 --> 02:38:27,910
of stuff that's also part of humanity
but amidst all that what gives you

7692
02:38:27,910 --> 02:38:27,920
but amidst all that what gives you
 

7693
02:38:27,920 --> 02:38:33,429
but amidst all that what gives you
hope I don't have that question

7694
02:38:33,429 --> 02:38:33,439

 

7695
02:38:33,439 --> 02:38:38,429

uh we can make Humanity Smarter with

7696
02:38:38,429 --> 02:38:38,439
uh we can make Humanity Smarter with
 

7697
02:38:38,439 --> 02:38:43,070
uh we can make Humanity Smarter with
AI okay I mean AI basically will amplify

7698
02:38:43,070 --> 02:38:43,080
AI okay I mean AI basically will amplify
 

7699
02:38:43,080 --> 02:38:44,190
AI okay I mean AI basically will amplify
human

7700

7701
02:38:44,200 --> 02:38:47,429
human
intelligence it's as if if every one of

7702
02:38:47,429 --> 02:38:47,439
intelligence it's as if if every one of
 

7703
02:38:47,439 --> 02:38:51,550
intelligence it's as if if every one of
us will have a staff of smart AI

7704
02:38:51,550 --> 02:38:51,560
us will have a staff of smart AI
 

7705
02:38:51,560 --> 02:38:54,510
us will have a staff of smart AI
assistants they might be smarter than us

7706
02:38:54,510 --> 02:38:54,520
assistants they might be smarter than us
 

7707
02:38:54,520 --> 02:38:57,830
assistants they might be smarter than us
they'll do our

7708
02:38:57,830 --> 02:38:57,840

 

7709
02:38:57,840 --> 02:39:02,150

bidding perhaps execute a task in ways

7710
02:39:02,150 --> 02:39:02,160
bidding perhaps execute a task in ways
 

7711
02:39:02,160 --> 02:39:04,230
bidding perhaps execute a task in ways
that are much better than we could do

7712
02:39:04,230 --> 02:39:04,240
that are much better than we could do
 

7713
02:39:04,240 --> 02:39:06,110
that are much better than we could do
ourselves because they'll be smarter

7714
02:39:06,110 --> 02:39:06,120
ourselves because they'll be smarter
 

7715
02:39:06,120 --> 02:39:09,070
ourselves because they'll be smarter
than us and so it's like everyone would

7716
02:39:09,070 --> 02:39:09,080
than us and so it's like everyone would
 

7717
02:39:09,080 --> 02:39:12,870
than us and so it's like everyone would
be the the boss of a staff of super

7718
02:39:12,870 --> 02:39:12,880
be the the boss of a staff of super
 

7719
02:39:12,880 --> 02:39:14,630
be the the boss of a staff of super

02:39:17,269 --> 02:39:17,279
people so we shouldn't feel threatened
 

7723
02:39:17,279 --> 02:39:19,389
people so we shouldn't feel threatened
by by this any more than we should feel

7724

by by this any more than we should feel
 

7725
02:39:19,399 --> 02:39:22,510
by by this any more than we should feel
threatened by being the manager of a

group of people some of whom are more
 

7729
02:39:23,880 --> 02:39:26,150
group of people some of whom are more
intelligent than

7730
02:39:26,150 --> 02:39:26,160
intelligent than
 

7731
02:39:26,160 --> 02:39:28,710
intelligent than
us I certainly have a lot of experience

7732
02:39:28,710 --> 02:39:28,720
us I certainly have a lot of experience
 

7733
02:39:28,720 --> 02:39:32,750
us I certainly have a lot of experience
with this of uh you know having people

working with me who are smarter than me
 

7737
02:39:34,960 --> 02:39:37,630
working with me who are smarter than me
um that's actually a wonderful thing so

7738
02:39:37,630 --> 02:39:37,640
um that's actually a wonderful thing so
 

7739
02:39:37,640 --> 02:39:39,990
um that's actually a wonderful thing so
uh having machines that are smarter than

7740
02:39:39,990 --> 02:39:40,000
uh having machines that are smarter than
 

7741
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:43,070
uh having machines that are smarter than
us that assist us in our all of our

7742
02:39:43,070 --> 02:39:43,080
us that assist us in our all of our
 

7743

be absolutely wonderful thing because
 

7749
02:39:48,479 --> 02:39:50,389
be absolutely wonderful thing because
intelligence is the

7750
02:39:50,389 --> 02:39:50,399
intelligence is the
 

7751
02:39:50,399 --> 02:39:53,389
intelligence is the
most um is the commodity that is most in

7752
02:39:53,389 --> 02:39:53,399
most um is the commodity that is most in
 

7753
02:39:53,399 --> 02:39:55,750
most um is the commodity that is most in
demand that that's really what I mean

7754
02:39:55,750 --> 02:39:55,760
demand that that's really what I mean
 

7755
02:39:55,760 --> 02:39:57,389
demand that that's really what I mean
all the mistakes that Humanity makes is

7756
02:39:57,389 --> 02:39:57,399
all the mistakes that Humanity makes is
 

7757
02:39:57,399 --> 02:39:59,150
all the mistakes that Humanity makes is
because of lack of intelligence really

7758
02:39:59,150 --> 02:39:59,160
because of lack of intelligence really
 

7759
02:39:59,160 --> 02:40:01,990
because of lack of intelligence really
or lack of knowledge which is you know

7760
02:40:01,990 --> 02:40:02,000
or lack of knowledge which is you know
 

7761
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:05,190
or lack of knowledge which is you know
related so um making people smarter

7762
02:40:05,190 --> 02:40:05,200
related so um making people smarter
 

7763
02:40:05,200 --> 02:40:08,030
related so um making people smarter
would just can only be better I mean for

7764
02:40:08,030 --> 02:40:08,040
would just can only be better I mean for
 

7765
02:40:08,040 --> 02:40:09,389
would just can only be better I mean for
the same reason that you know public

7766
02:40:09,389 --> 02:40:09,399
the same reason that you know public
 

7767
02:40:09,399 --> 02:40:11,630
the same reason that you know public
education is a good

7768
02:40:11,630 --> 02:40:11,640
education is a good
 

7769

internet is also a good thing
intrinsically and even social networks

7774
02:40:18,590 --> 02:40:18,600
intrinsically and even social networks
 

7775
02:40:18,600 --> 02:40:20,670
intrinsically and even social networks
are a good thing if you run them

7776
02:40:20,670 --> 02:40:20,680
are a good thing if you run them
 

7777
02:40:20,680 --> 02:40:23,110
are a good thing if you run them
properly it's difficult but you know you

7778
02:40:23,110 --> 02:40:23,120
properly it's difficult but you know you
 

7779
02:40:23,120 --> 02:40:24,790
properly it's difficult but you know you
can

7780
02:40:24,790 --> 02:40:24,800
can
 

7781
02:40:24,800 --> 02:40:29,030
can
um uh because you know it

7782
02:40:29,030 --> 02:40:29,040
um uh because you know it
 

7783
02:40:29,040 --> 02:40:31,389
um uh because you know it
it's helps the communication of

7784
02:40:31,389 --> 02:40:31,399
it's helps the communication of
 

7785
02:40:31,399 --> 02:40:33,150
it's helps the communication of
information and knowledge and the

7786
02:40:33,150 --> 02:40:33,160
information and knowledge and the
 

7787
02:40:33,160 --> 02:40:34,870
information and knowledge and the
transmission of knowledge so AI is going

7788
02:40:34,870 --> 02:40:34,880
transmission of knowledge so AI is going
 

7789
02:40:34,880 --> 02:40:36,910
transmission of knowledge so AI is going
to make Humanity

7790
02:40:36,910 --> 02:40:36,920
to make Humanity
 

7791
02:40:36,920 --> 02:40:39,630
to make Humanity
smarter and the analogy I've been

7792
02:40:39,630 --> 02:40:39,640
smarter and the analogy I've been
 

7793
02:40:39,640 --> 02:40:43,710
smarter and the analogy I've been
using is the fact that perhaps an

7794
02:40:43,710 --> 02:40:43,720
using is the fact that perhaps an
 

7795
02:40:43,720 --> 02:40:46,950
using is the fact that perhaps an
equivalent event in a history of

7796
02:40:46,950 --> 02:40:46,960
equivalent event in a history of
 

7797
02:40:46,960 --> 02:40:52,150
equivalent event in a history of
humanity to what might be provided by

7798
02:40:52,150 --> 02:40:52,160
humanity to what might be provided by
 

7799
02:40:52,160 --> 02:40:54,150
humanity to what might be provided by
journalized is the invention of the

02:40:54,150 --> 02:40:54,160
journalized is the invention of the
 

7801
02:40:54,160 --> 02:40:55,830
journalized is the invention of the
printing the printing press it made

7802
02:40:55,830 --> 02:40:55,840
printing the printing press it made
 

7803
02:40:55,840 --> 02:40:58,269
printing the printing press it made
everybody smarter the fact

7804
02:40:58,269 --> 02:40:58,279
everybody smarter the fact
 

7805
02:40:58,279 --> 02:41:02,269
everybody smarter the fact
that people could uh have access to um

7806
02:41:02,269 --> 02:41:02,279
that people could uh have access to um
 

7807
02:41:02,279 --> 02:41:04,790
that people could uh have access to um
two books books were a lot cheaper than

7808
02:41:04,790 --> 02:41:04,800
two books books were a lot cheaper than
 

7809
02:41:04,800 --> 02:41:08,389
two books books were a lot cheaper than
they were before and so a lot more

7810
02:41:08,389 --> 02:41:08,399
they were before and so a lot more
 

7811
02:41:08,399 --> 02:41:10,710
they were before and so a lot more
people had an incentive to learn to read

7812
02:41:10,710 --> 02:41:10,720
people had an incentive to learn to read
 

7813
02:41:10,720 --> 02:41:16,750
people had an incentive to learn to read
which wasn't the case before um and

7814
02:41:16,750 --> 02:41:16,760
which wasn't the case before um and
 

7815
02:41:16,760 --> 02:41:19,630
which wasn't the case before um and
people became smarter it it enabled the

7816
02:41:19,630 --> 02:41:19,640
people became smarter it it enabled the
 

7817
02:41:19,640 --> 02:41:21,910
people became smarter it it enabled the
enlightenment right there wouldn't be an

feudal regimes perhaps um and so it

7842
02:41:54,309 --> 02:41:54,319
feudal regimes perhaps um and so it
 

7843
02:41:54,319 --> 02:41:57,950
feudal regimes perhaps um and so it
completely transformed the the world

7844
02:41:57,950 --> 02:41:57,960
completely transformed the the world
 

7845
02:41:57,960 --> 02:42:00,150
completely transformed the the world
because people became smarter and kind

of learn learn about things now it also
created 200 years of essentially

7850
02:42:06,469 --> 02:42:06,479

religious conflicts in Europe right
because the first thing that people read

7854
02:42:10,750 --> 02:42:10,760
because the first thing that people read
 

7855
02:42:10,760 --> 02:42:14,950
because the first thing that people read
was the Bible and uh realized that

7856
02:42:14,950 --> 02:42:14,960
was the Bible and uh realized that
 

7857
02:42:14,960 --> 02:42:16,550
was the Bible and uh realized that
perhaps was a different interpretation

7858
02:42:16,550 --> 02:42:16,560
perhaps was a different interpretation
 

7859
02:42:16,560 --> 02:42:17,990
perhaps was a different interpretation
of the Bible than what the priests were

7860
02:42:17,990 --> 02:42:18,000
of the Bible than what the priests were
 

7861
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:18,830
of the Bible than what the priests were
telling

7862
02:42:18,830 --> 02:42:18,840
telling
 

7863
02:42:18,840 --> 02:42:21,670
telling
them and so that created the Protestant

7864
02:42:21,670 --> 02:42:21,680
them and so that created the Protestant
 

7865
02:42:21,680 --> 02:42:23,990
them and so that created the Protestant
movement and created the rift and in

7866
02:42:23,990 --> 02:42:24,000
movement and created the rift and in
 

7867
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,150
movement and created the rift and in
fact the Catholic School the Catholic

7868
02:42:26,150 --> 02:42:26,160
fact the Catholic School the Catholic
 

7869
02:42:26,160 --> 02:42:27,670
fact the Catholic School the Catholic
Church didn't like the idea of the

7870
02:42:27,670 --> 02:42:27,680
Church didn't like the idea of the
 

7871
02:42:27,680 --> 02:42:29,910
Church didn't like the idea of the
printing price but they had no choice

7872
02:42:29,910 --> 02:42:29,920
printing price but they had no choice
 

7873
02:42:29,920 --> 02:42:31,950
printing price but they had no choice
and so it had some bad effects and some

7874
02:42:31,950 --> 02:42:31,960
and so it had some bad effects and some
 

7875
02:42:31,960 --> 02:42:33,429
and so it had some bad effects and some
some good effects I don't think anyone

7876
02:42:33,429 --> 02:42:33,439
some good effects I don't think anyone
 

7877
02:42:33,439 --> 02:42:34,950
some good effects I don't think anyone
today would say that the invention of

7878
02:42:34,950 --> 02:42:34,960
today would say that the invention of
 

7879
02:42:34,960 --> 02:42:36,950
today would say that the invention of
the printing press had a overall

02:42:36,950 --> 02:42:36,960
the printing press had a overall
 

7881
02:42:36,960 --> 02:42:39,550
the printing press had a overall
negative effect despite the fact that it

7882
02:42:39,550 --> 02:42:39,560
negative effect despite the fact that it
 

7883
02:42:39,560 --> 02:42:42,230
negative effect despite the fact that it
created 200 years of religious

7884
02:42:42,230 --> 02:42:42,240
created 200 years of religious
 

7885
02:42:42,240 --> 02:42:46,670

7889
02:42:49,080 --> 02:42:51,670
and I I thought uh I was very proud of
myself to come and put this analogy but

7890
02:42:51,670 --> 02:42:51,680
myself to come and put this analogy but
 

7891
02:42:51,680 --> 02:42:53,670
myself to come and put this analogy but
realized someone else uh came with the

7892
02:42:53,670 --> 02:42:53,680
realized someone else uh came with the
 

7893
02:42:53,680 --> 02:42:56,150
realized someone else uh came with the
same idea before me um compare this with

7894
02:42:56,150 --> 02:42:56,160
same idea before me um compare this with
 

7895
02:42:56,160 --> 02:42:58,910
same idea before me um compare this with
what happened in the Ottoman Empire the

7951
02:44:20,359 --> 02:44:22,670

business now what's the analogy for AI

7952
02:44:22,670 --> 02:44:22,680
business now what's the analogy for AI
 

7953
02:44:22,680 --> 02:44:24,429
business now what's the analogy for AI
today like who are we protecting by

7954
02:44:24,429 --> 02:44:24,439
today like who are we protecting by
 

7955
02:44:24,439 --> 02:44:26,070
today like who are we protecting by
Banning AI like who are the people who

7956
02:44:26,070 --> 02:44:26,080
Banning AI like who are the people who
 

7957
02:44:26,080 --> 02:44:28,950
Banning AI like who are the people who
are asking that AI be regulated to

7958
02:44:28,950 --> 02:44:28,960
are asking that AI be regulated to
 

7959
02:44:28,960 --> 02:44:32,110
are asking that AI be regulated to
protect their their jobs and of course

7960
02:44:32,110 --> 02:44:32,120
protect their their jobs and of course
 

7961
02:44:32,120 --> 02:44:34,230

02:44:34,230 --> 02:44:34,240
you know there's it's it's a it's a real
 

7963
02:44:34,240 --> 02:44:37,110
you know there's it's it's a it's a real
question of what is going to be the

7964
02:44:37,110 --> 02:44:37,120
question of what is going to be the
 

7965
02:44:37,120 --> 02:44:38,309
question of what is going to be the
effect

7966
02:44:38,309 --> 02:44:38,319
effect
 

7967
02:44:38,319 --> 02:44:40,830
effect
of you know technological transformation

7968
02:44:40,830 --> 02:44:40,840
of you know technological transformation
 

7969
02:44:40,840 --> 02:44:44,429
of you know technological transformation
like AI on the on the job market and the

7970
02:44:44,429 --> 02:44:44,439
like AI on the on the job market and the
 

7971
02:44:44,439 --> 02:44:46,790
like AI on the on the job market and the
labor market and there are economists

7972
02:44:46,790 --> 02:44:46,800
labor market and there are economists
 

7973
02:44:46,800 --> 02:44:48,830
labor market and there are economists
who are much more expert at this than I

7974
02:44:48,830 --> 02:44:48,840
who are much more expert at this than I
 

7975
02:44:48,840 --> 02:44:50,990
who are much more expert at this than I
am but when I talk to them they they

7976
02:44:50,990 --> 02:44:51,000
am but when I talk to them they they
 

7977
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:52,150
am but when I talk to them they they
tell

7978
02:44:52,150 --> 02:44:52,160
tell
 

7979
02:44:52,160 --> 02:44:54,110
tell
us you know we're not going to run out

7980
02:44:54,110 --> 02:44:54,120
us you know we're not going to run out
 

7981
02:44:54,120 --> 02:44:55,910
us you know we're not going to run out
of job this this not this is not going

7982
02:44:55,910 --> 02:44:55,920
of job this this not this is not going
 

7983
02:44:55,920 --> 02:44:58,269
of job this this not this is not going
to cause mass unemployment this this

7984
02:44:58,269 --> 02:44:58,279
to cause mass unemployment this this
 

7985
02:44:58,279 --> 02:45:01,269
to cause mass unemployment this this
just going to be gradual uh shift of

7986
02:45:01,269 --> 02:45:01,279
just going to be gradual uh shift of
 

7987
02:45:01,279 --> 02:45:02,910
just going to be gradual uh shift of
different professions the professions

7988
02:45:02,910 --> 02:45:02,920
different professions the professions
 

7989
02:45:02,920 --> 02:45:05,870
different professions the professions
are going to be hot 10 or 15 years from

7990
02:45:05,870 --> 02:45:05,880
are going to be hot 10 or 15 years from
 

7991
02:45:05,880 --> 02:45:08,030
are going to be hot 10 or 15 years from
now we have no idea today what they're

7992
02:45:08,030 --> 02:45:08,040
now we have no idea today what they're
 

7993
02:45:08,040 --> 02:45:10,429
now we have no idea today what they're
going to be the same way if we go back

7994
02:45:10,429 --> 02:45:10,439
going to be the same way if we go back
 

7995
02:45:10,439 --> 02:45:13,030
going to be the same way if we go back
20 years in the past like who could have

7996
02:45:13,030 --> 02:45:13,040
20 years in the past like who could have
 

7997
02:45:13,040 --> 02:45:15,830
20 years in the past like who could have
thought 20 years ago that like the

7998
02:45:15,830 --> 02:45:15,840
thought 20 years ago that like the

mobile app developer like smartphones
weren't invented most of the jobs of the

8004
02:45:24,269 --> 02:45:24,279
weren't invented most of the jobs of the
 

8005
02:45:24,279 --> 02:45:25,990
weren't invented most of the jobs of the
future might be in in the

8006
02:45:25,990 --> 02:45:26,000
future might be in in the
 

8007
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:29,550
future might be in in the
metaverse well it could be yeah but the

8008
02:45:29,550 --> 02:45:29,560
metaverse well it could be yeah but the
 

8009
02:45:29,560 --> 02:45:32,550
metaverse well it could be yeah but the
point is you can't possibly predict but

8010
02:45:32,550 --> 02:45:32,560
point is you can't possibly predict but
 

8011
02:45:32,560 --> 02:45:34,030
point is you can't possibly predict but
you're right I mean you made a lot of

8012
02:45:34,030 --> 02:45:34,040
you're right I mean you made a lot of
 

8013

strong points
and I I believe that people are

8016
02:45:37,349 --> 02:45:37,359
and I I believe that people are
 

8017
02:45:37,359 --> 02:45:40,309
and I I believe that people are
fundamentally good and so if

8018
02:45:40,309 --> 02:45:40,319
fundamentally good and so if
 

8019
02:45:40,319 --> 02:45:44,469
fundamentally good and so if
AI especially open source AI can um make

8021
02:45:44,479 --> 02:45:45,710
AI especially open source AI can um make
them smarter

8022
02:45:45,710 --> 02:45:45,720
