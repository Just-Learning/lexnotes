00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:38,240
cover or maybe a couple of years yes but
 

329
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,469
cover or maybe a couple of years yes but
so let's start if it's okay

330
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:40,479
so let's start if it's okay
 

331
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,550
so let's start if it's okay
uh you said you wanted to challenge some

you disagree with okay there are two
 

341
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,710
you disagree with okay there are two
major areas that i study uh one is what

342
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:52,720
major areas that i study uh one is what
 

343
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,469

fell off a cliff in 2013 it was very
 

347
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,670
fell off a cliff in 2013 it was very
sudden um and then the other is what is

348
00:05:59,670 --> 00:05:59,680
sudden um and then the other is what is
 

349
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,270
sudden um and then the other is what is
happening to our democratic and

350
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:01,280
happening to our democratic and
 

351
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,110
happening to our democratic and
epistemic institutions that means

352
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,120
epistemic institutions that means
 

353
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,870
epistemic institutions that means
knowledge generating like the

354
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:04,880
knowledge generating like the
 

355
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,029

universities journalism

356
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:07,039
universities journalism
 

357
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,270
universities journalism
so so my main areas of research where

358
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:09,280
so so my main areas of research where
 

359
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,550
so so my main areas of research where
i'm collecting the empirical research

360
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:10,560
i'm collecting the empirical research
 

361
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,950
i'm collecting the empirical research
and trying to make sense of it is

362
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
and trying to make sense of it is
 

363
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,309
and trying to make sense of it is
what's happened to mental health and

364
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:14,319
what's happened to mental health and
 

365
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,230
what's happened to mental health and
what's the evidence that social media is

366
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,240
what's the evidence that social media is
 

367
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,629
what's the evidence that social media is
a contributor and then the other areas

368
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639
a contributor and then the other areas
 

369
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,390
a contributor and then the other areas
what's happening to

370
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400
what's happening to
 

371
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,469
what's happening to
democracies not just america and what's

372
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:22,479
democracies not just america and what's
 

373
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,749
democracies not just america and what's
the evidence that social media is a

374
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:23,759
the evidence that social media is a
 

375
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,749
the evidence that social media is a
contributor to the dysfunction so well

376
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:25,759
contributor to the dysfunction so well
 

377
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,710
contributor to the dysfunction so well
i'm sure we'll get to that because

378
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:26,720
i'm sure we'll get to that because
 

379
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,909
i'm sure we'll get to that because
that's what the atlantic article is

380
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:27,919
that's what the atlantic article is
 

381
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,390
that's what the atlantic article is
about but if we focus first on what's

382
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:30,400
about but if we focus first on what's
 

383
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,230
about but if we focus first on what's
happened to teen mental health

384
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,240
happened to teen mental health
 

385
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,469
happened to teen mental health
so before i read the quotes from mark i

386
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:34,479
so before i read the quotes from mark i
 

387
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,749
so before i read the quotes from mark i
i'd like to just give the overview um uh

388
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:37,759
i'd like to just give the overview um uh
 

389
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,590
i'd like to just give the overview um uh
and it is this

390
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:39,600
and it is this
 

391
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,070
and it is this
there's a lot of data tracking

392
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,080
there's a lot of data tracking
 

393
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,430
there's a lot of data tracking
adolescents

394
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:43,440
adolescents
 

395
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,110
adolescents
there's self-reports of how depressed

396
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,120
there's self-reports of how depressed
 

397
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,870
there's self-reports of how depressed
anxious lonely

398
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:46,880
anxious lonely
 

399
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,309
anxious lonely
there's data on hospital admissions for

400
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:48,319
there's data on hospital admissions for
 

401
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,629
there's data on hospital admissions for
self-harm there's data on suicide

402
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:50,639
self-harm there's data on suicide
 

403
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,070
self-harm there's data on suicide
and all of these things they bounce

404
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,080
and all of these things they bounce
 

405
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,990
and all of these things they bounce
around somewhat um but they're

406
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,000
around somewhat um but they're
 

407
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,790
around somewhat um but they're
relatively level in the early 2000s and

408
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
relatively level in the early 2000s and
 

409
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,469
relatively level in the early 2000s and
then all of a sudden around you know

410
00:06:58,469 --> 00:06:58,479
then all of a sudden around you know
 

411
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,029
then all of a sudden around you know
around 2010 to 2013 depending on which

412
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039
around 2010 to 2013 depending on which
 

413
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,629
around 2010 to 2013 depending on which
statistic you're looking at

414
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
statistic you're looking at
 

415
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,790
statistic you're looking at
all of a sudden they begin to shoot

416
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
all of a sudden they begin to shoot
 

417
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,510
all of a sudden they begin to shoot
upwards um more so for girls in some

418
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:07,520
upwards um more so for girls in some
 

419
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,589
upwards um more so for girls in some
cases but on the whole it's like up for

420
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:09,599
cases but on the whole it's like up for
 

421
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,350
cases but on the whole it's like up for
both sexes it's just that boys have

422
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:11,360
both sexes it's just that boys have
 

423
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,950
both sexes it's just that boys have
lower levels of anxiety and depression

424
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:12,960
lower levels of anxiety and depression
 

425
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,110
lower levels of anxiety and depression
so the curve is not quite as dramatic

426
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,120
so the curve is not quite as dramatic
 

427
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,350
so the curve is not quite as dramatic
but what we see is not small increase

428
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:17,360
but what we see is not small increase
 

429
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,070
but what we see is not small increase
it's not like oh 10 20

430
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,080
it's not like oh 10 20
 

431
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,830
it's not like oh 10 20
no the increases are between 50 and 150

432
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:23,840
no the increases are between 50 and 150
 

433
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,270
no the increases are between 50 and 150
um depending on which group you're

434
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,280
um depending on which group you're
 

435
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,749
um depending on which group you're
looking at um you know suicide for

436
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:27,759
looking at um you know suicide for
 

437
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,909
looking at um you know suicide for
pre-teen girls think thankfully it's not

438
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:29,919
pre-teen girls think thankfully it's not
 

439
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,710
pre-teen girls think thankfully it's not
very common um but it's two to three

440
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:32,720
very common um but it's two to three
 

441
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,909
very common um but it's two to three
times more common now or by 2015 it had

442
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:35,919
times more common now or by 2015 it had
 

443
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,550
times more common now or by 2015 it had
doubled between 2010 and 2015 it doubled

444
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:38,560
doubled between 2010 and 2015 it doubled
 

445
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,550
doubled between 2010 and 2015 it doubled
so something is going radically wrong in

446
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:40,560
so something is going radically wrong in
 

447
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,350
so something is going radically wrong in
the world of american preteens

448
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,360
the world of american preteens
 

449
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,950
the world of american preteens
and what we so as i've been studying it

450
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:44,960
and what we so as i've been studying it
 

451
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,629
and what we so as i've been studying it
i found first of all it's not just

452
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:46,639
i found first of all it's not just
 

453
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,189
i found first of all it's not just
america it's identical in canada and the

454
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:49,199
america it's identical in canada and the
 

455
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,230
america it's identical in canada and the
uk

456
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:50,240
uk
 

457
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,830
uk
um australia new zealand are very

458
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:51,840
um australia new zealand are very
 

459
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,950
um australia new zealand are very
similar they're just after a little

460
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:52,960
similar they're just after a little
 

461
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,869
similar they're just after a little
delay so whatever we're looking for here

462
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:54,879
delay so whatever we're looking for here
 

463
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,550
delay so whatever we're looking for here
but but yet it's not it's not as clear

464
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560
but but yet it's not it's not as clear
 

465
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,550
but but yet it's not it's not as clear
uh in the germanic countries it's in

466
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:58,560
uh in the germanic countries it's in
 

467
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,670
uh in the germanic countries it's in
continental europe it's a little

468
00:07:59,670 --> 00:07:59,680
continental europe it's a little
 

469
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,869
continental europe it's a little
different and we can get into that when

470
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:00,879
different and we can get into that when
 

471
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,469
different and we can get into that when
we talk about childhood

472
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:02,479
we talk about childhood
 

473
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,589
we talk about childhood
but

474
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:03,599
but
 

475
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,670
but
something's happening in many countries

476
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:05,680
something's happening in many countries
 

477
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,150
something's happening in many countries
um that and it started right around 2012

478
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,160
um that and it started right around 2012
 

479
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,950
um that and it started right around 2012
2013 it wasn't gradual um it hit girls

480
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:10,960
2013 it wasn't gradual um it hit girls
 

481
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,790
2013 it wasn't gradual um it hit girls
hardest and it hit pre-teen girls the

482
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:12,800
hardest and it hit pre-teen girls the
 

483
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,589
hardest and it hit pre-teen girls the
hardest so what could it be

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,070
up in the 50s and 60 in the 60s and 70s
doesn't mean that that was the cause of

00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:36,080
doesn't mean that that was the cause of
 

507
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,230
doesn't mean that that was the cause of
the crime so what i've done

eye glasses it was a very catchy claim

548
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:20,720
eye glasses it was a very catchy claim
 

549
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,230
eye glasses it was a very catchy claim
and it's caught on and i keep hearing

550
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:22,240
and it's caught on and i keep hearing
 

551
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,030
and it's caught on and i keep hearing
that

552
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,040
that
 

553
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,190
that
um but let me unpack why that's not true

554
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,200
um but let me unpack why that's not true
 

555
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,150
um but let me unpack why that's not true
and then we'll get to what mark said

556
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160
and then we'll get to what mark said
 

557
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,750
and then we'll get to what mark said
because what mark basically said here

558
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,760
because what mark basically said here
 

559
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,110
because what mark basically said here
actually i'll read it

560
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,120
actually i'll read it
 

561
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,110
actually i'll read it
by the way just to pause real quick uh

562
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,120
by the way just to pause real quick uh
 

563
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,310
by the way just to pause real quick uh
is

564
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:32,320
is
 

565
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,310
is
you you implied but just make it

566
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:34,320
you you implied but just make it
 

567
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,310
you you implied but just make it
explicit that the best explanation we

568
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:36,320
explicit that the best explanation we
 

569
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,470
explicit that the best explanation we
have now as you're proposing is that a

570
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:38,480
have now as you're proposing is that a
 

571
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,550
have now as you're proposing is that a

is there is a cause which is not just
social media but the the like button and

the retweet a certain mechanism of
virality that that was

00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:50,399
virality that that was
 

581
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,550
virality that that was
invented or perhaps yeah some aspect of

582
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:52,560
invented or perhaps yeah some aspect of
 

583
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,150
invented or perhaps yeah some aspect of
social media is the cause good idea

00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:27,360
could be now this is harder to
 

677
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,430
could be now this is harder to
measure and we'll probably

678
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:29,440
measure and we'll probably
 

679
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,509
measure and we'll probably
i'll try to mention it because

680
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:31,519
i'll try to mention it because

twitter

694
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:45,839
twitter
 

695

not the promotion or any of that kind of

00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
not the promotion or any of that kind of
 

697
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,069
not the promotion or any of that kind of
stuff it makes me

698
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:50,079
stuff it makes me
 

699
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,150
stuff it makes me
feel less lonely

700
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,160
feel less lonely
 

701
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,310
feel less lonely
to connect with people to make me smile

702
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,320
to connect with people to make me smile
 

703
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,629
to connect with people to make me smile
a little bit of humor here and there it

704
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:56,639
a little bit of humor here and there it
 

705
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,550
a little bit of humor here and there it
and that at scale is a very interesting

706
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:58,560
and that at scale is a very interesting
 

707
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,629
and that at scale is a very interesting
effect being connected across the globe

708
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:00,639
effect being connected across the globe
 

709
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,870
effect being connected across the globe
especially during times of covert and so

710
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:02,880
especially during times of covert and so
 

711
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,790
especially during times of covert and so
on it's very difficult to measure that

712
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:04,800
on it's very difficult to measure that
 

713
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,949
on it's very difficult to measure that
so we kind of have to consider that and

714
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:06,959
so we kind of have to consider that and
 

715
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,389
so we kind of have to consider that and
be honest

716
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:08,399
be honest
 

717
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,550
be honest
that there is a trade-off

718
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:10,560
that there is a trade-off
 

719
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,150
that there is a trade-off
uh we have to be honest about the

720
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,160
uh we have to be honest about the
 

721
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,389
uh we have to be honest about the
positive and the negative and sometimes

722
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:14,399
positive and the negative and sometimes
 

723
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,550
positive and the negative and sometimes
we're not sufficiently positive or in a

724
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560
we're not sufficiently positive or in a
 

725
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,790
we're not sufficiently positive or in a
rigorous scientific way about the uh

726
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:18,800
rigorous scientific way about the uh
 

727
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,829
rigorous scientific way about the uh
we're not

728
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:19,839
we're not
 

729
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,910
we're not
rigorous in a scientific way about the

730
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:21,920
rigorous in a scientific way about the
 

731
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,590
rigorous in a scientific way about the
negative and that's what we're trying to

732
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:23,600
negative and that's what we're trying to
 

733
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,629
negative and that's what we're trying to
do

734
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:24,639
do
 

735
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,590
do

so
that brings us to

742
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:29,839
that brings us to
 

743
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,829

and it's hit many countries so i go
through the data on that so we have a

1156
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:11,039
through the data on that so we have a
 

1157
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,230
through the data on that so we have a
pretty clear characterization and

1158
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:12,240
pretty clear characterization and
 

1159
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,750

part so can we just pause real quick

1162
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:15,840
part so can we just pause real quick
 

1163
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,990

self-report just how you kind of collect
 

1167
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,549
self-report just how you kind of collect
data on this kind of thing sure you have

1168

data on this kind of thing sure you have
 

1169
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,590
data on this kind of thing sure you have
a

1170
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:23,600
a
 

1171
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,549
a
self-reported survey you ask people

social media
that kind of stuff and then you do

1180
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:34,160
that kind of stuff and then you do
 

1181
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,549
that kind of stuff and then you do
it's maybe

1182
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:36,559
it's maybe
 

1183
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,150
it's maybe
you can collect large amounts of data

1184
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:38,160
you can collect large amounts of data
 

1185
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,350
you can collect large amounts of data
that way because you can ask a large

1186
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:39,360
that way because you can ask a large
 

1187
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,950
that way because you can ask a large
number of people that kind of question

1188
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:40,960
number of people that kind of question
 

1189
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,630
number of people that kind of question
and but then there's uh i forget the

1190
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:42,640
and but then there's uh i forget the
 

1191
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,390
and but then there's uh i forget the
term you use but more

uh so non-self-report data behavioral

1194
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:46,559
uh so non-self-report data behavioral

around between 2009 and 2012 you have an
 

1275
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,029
around between 2009 and 2012 you have an
elbow and then it goes up up up so that

1276
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:11,039
elbow and then it goes up up up so that
 

1277
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,710

so we have a catastrophe and this was

1284
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:17,280
so we have a catastrophe and this was
 

1285
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,350
so we have a catastrophe and this was
all true before kovid covet made things

all true before kovid covet made things
 

1287
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,669
all true before kovid covet made things
worse but we have to realize um you know

00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:21,679
worse but we have to realize um you know
 

1289
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,430
worse but we have to realize um you know

therefore range from about r equals 0.15

1386
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:05,440
therefore range from about r equals 0.15
 

1387
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,470
therefore range from about r equals 0.15

to r equals 0.10 um
 

1389
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,750
to r equals 0.10 um
so that's the range we're talking about

1390
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:09,760
so that's the range we're talking about
 

1391

um and a lot of research including hers
 

1395
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,669
um and a lot of research including hers
and mine show that girls it's higher so

and mine show that girls it's higher so
 

1397
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:16,549
and mine show that girls it's higher so
for girls we're talking about

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,430
that thing that actually is dangerous
and it can explain when you multiply it

1428
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:47,440
and it can explain when you multiply it
 

1429
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,310
and it can explain when you multiply it
over

1430
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:48,320
over
 

1431
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,230
over
tens of millions of kids spending you

1432
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:50,240
tens of millions of kids spending you
 

1433
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,830
tens of millions of kids spending you
know years of their lives

1434
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:51,840
know years of their lives
 

1435
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,190
know years of their lives
you actually can explain the mental

1436
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:53,200
you actually can explain the mental
 

1437
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,190
you actually can explain the mental
health epidemic just from

1438
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:55,200
health epidemic just from
 

1439
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,710
health epidemic just from
social media use

1440
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:56,720
social media use
 

1441
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,390
social media use
well and then there's questions by the

1442
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:58,400
well and then there's questions by the
 

1443
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,630
well and then there's questions by the
way uh this is really good to learn

1444
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:00,640
way uh this is really good to learn
 

1445
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,520
way uh this is really good to learn
because i quit potatoes and it had no

1446
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:02,530
because i quit potatoes and it had no
 

1447
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:03,669
because i quit potatoes and it had no
[Laughter]

1448
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:03,679
[Laughter]
 

1449
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,110
[Laughter]
uh and it's a russian that was a big

1450
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,120
uh and it's a russian that was a big
 

1451
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,470
uh and it's a russian that was a big
sacrifice

1452
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:06,480
sacrifice
 

1453
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,070
sacrifice
um they're quite literal actually

1454
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,080
um they're quite literal actually
 

1455
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,669
um they're quite literal actually
because i'm mostly eating keto these

1456
00:24:09,669 --> 00:24:09,679
because i'm mostly eating keto these
 

1457
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,190
because i'm mostly eating keto these
days but that's that's

1458
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:11,200
days but that's that's
 

1459
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,549
days but that's that's
that's funny that they're actually

1460
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:12,559
that's funny that they're actually
 

1461
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,110
that's funny that they're actually
literally called the potato studies okay

1462
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:15,120
literally called the potato studies okay
 

1463
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,390
literally called the potato studies okay
uh but

1464
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:16,400
uh but
 

1465
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,990
uh but
given this and there's a lot of

1466
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:18,000
given this and there's a lot of
 

1467
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,310
given this and there's a lot of
fascinating data here there's also a

1468
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:20,320
fascinating data here there's also a
 

1469
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,750
fascinating data here there's also a
discussion of how to how to fix it

1470
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:23,760
discussion of how to how to fix it
 

1471
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,590
discussion of how to how to fix it
what are the aspects

1472
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:27,600

 

1473
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,310

that if fixed would start to reverse

1474
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:30,320
that if fixed would start to reverse
 

1475
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,390
that if fixed would start to reverse
some of these trends

1476
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:32,400
some of these trends
 

1477
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,149
some of these trends
so if we just

1478
00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:34,159
so if we just
 

1479
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,269
so if we just
linger on the sort of the mark

1480
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:35,279
linger on the sort of the mark
 

1481
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,710
linger on the sort of the mark
zuckerberg

1482
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:36,720
zuckerberg
 

1483
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,909
zuckerberg
statements

1484
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:37,919
statements
 

1485
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,430
statements
so first of all do you think

1486
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:39,440
so first of all do you think
 

1487
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,750
so first of all do you think
mark is aware of some of these

1488
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:41,760
mark is aware of some of these
 

1489
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,110
mark is aware of some of these
studies

1490
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:43,120
studies
 

1491
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,110
studies
so

1492
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:45,120
so
 

1493
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,190
so
if we if you put yourself in the shoes

1494
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:47,200
if we if you put yourself in the shoes
 

1495
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,430
if we if you put yourself in the shoes
of mark zuckerberg and the executives

1496
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:49,440
of mark zuckerberg and the executives
 

1497
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,350
of mark zuckerberg and the executives
that facebook and twitter

1498
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:51,360
that facebook and twitter
 

1499
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,190
that facebook and twitter
how can you try to understand the

1500
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:53,200
how can you try to understand the
 

1501
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,710
how can you try to understand the
studies like the google docs you put

1502
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:54,720
studies like the google docs you put
 

1503
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,470
studies like the google docs you put
together

1504
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:56,480
together
 

1505
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,190
together
to try to make decisions that fix things

1506
00:24:59,190 --> 00:24:59,200
to try to make decisions that fix things
 

1507
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,070
to try to make decisions that fix things
is is is there a stable science now that

1508
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:02,080
is is is there a stable science now that
 

1509
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,990
is is is there a stable science now that
you can start to investigate and and

1510
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:04,000
you can start to investigate and and
 

1511
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,630
you can start to investigate and and
also maybe uh if you can comment

1512
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:06,640
also maybe uh if you can comment
 

1513
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,549
also maybe uh if you can comment
on the depth of data that's available

1514
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:08,559
on the depth of data that's available
 

1515
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,390
on the depth of data that's available
because ultimately

1516
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:10,400
because ultimately
 

1517
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,990
because ultimately
this is something you argue that the

1518
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:12,000
this is something you argue that the
 

1519
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,390
this is something you argue that the
data should be more transparent should

1520
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:14,400
data should be more transparent should
 

1521
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,870
data should be more transparent should
be provided but currently if it's not

1522
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:18,880
be provided but currently if it's not
 

1523
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,510
be provided but currently if it's not
all you have is maybe some leaks of

1524
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:21,520
all you have is maybe some leaks of
 

1525
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,870
all you have is maybe some leaks of
internal data

1526
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:22,880
internal data
 

1527
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,789
internal data
that's right and we could talk about the

1528
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:24,799
that's right and we could talk about the
 

1529
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,470
that's right and we could talk about the
potential you have to be very sort of

1530
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:26,480
potential you have to be very sort of
 

1531
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,310
potential you have to be very sort of
objective about the potential bias in

1532
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:28,320
objective about the potential bias in
 

1533
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,710
objective about the potential bias in
those kinds of leaks you want to

1534
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:30,720
those kinds of leaks you want to
 

1535
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,590
those kinds of leaks you want to
it would be nice to have a non-leak data

1536
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:33,600
it would be nice to have a non-leak data
 

1537
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,549
it would be nice to have a non-leak data
like

1538
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:34,559
like
 

1539
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,230
like
like yeah it'd be nice to be able to

1540
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:36,240
like yeah it'd be nice to be able to
 

1541
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,310
like yeah it'd be nice to be able to
actually have academic researchers able

1542
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:38,320
actually have academic researchers able
 

1543
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,230
actually have academic researchers able
to access in de-individuated

1544
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:40,240
to access in de-individuated
 

1545
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,510
to access in de-individuated
de-identified form um the actual data on

1546
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:43,520
de-identified form um the actual data on
 

1547
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,269
de-identified form um the actual data on
what kids are doing and how their mood

1548
00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:45,279
what kids are doing and how their mood
 

1549
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,870
what kids are doing and how their mood
changes and and you know when people

1550
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:46,880
changes and and you know when people
 

1551
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,549
changes and and you know when people
commit suicide what was happening before

1552
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:48,559
commit suicide what was happening before
 

1553
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:49,750
commit suicide what was happening before
and it'd be great to know that we have

1554
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:49,760
and it'd be great to know that we have
 

1555
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,870
and it'd be great to know that we have
no idea

1556
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:50,880
no idea
 

1557
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,350
no idea
so what how do we begin

1558
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:53,360
so what how do we begin
 

1559
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,909
so what how do we begin
to fix social media would you say okay

1560
00:25:55,909 --> 00:25:55,919
to fix social media would you say okay
 

1561
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,029
to fix social media would you say okay
so here's the most important thing to

1562
00:25:57,029 --> 00:25:57,039
so here's the most important thing to
 

1563
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,070
so here's the most important thing to
understand

1564
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:58,080
understand
 

1565
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,830
understand
in the social sciences

1566
00:25:59,830 --> 00:25:59,840
in the social sciences
 

1567
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,669
in the social sciences
you know we say is social media harmful

1568
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:01,679
you know we say is social media harmful
 

1569
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,350
you know we say is social media harmful
to kids that's a broad question you

1570
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:03,360
to kids that's a broad question you
 

1571
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,110
to kids that's a broad question you
can't answer that directly you have to

1572
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:05,120
can't answer that directly you have to
 

1573
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,630
can't answer that directly you have to
have much more specific questions you

1574
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:06,640
have much more specific questions you
 

1575
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,789
have much more specific questions you
have to operationalize it and have a

1576
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:08,799
have to operationalize it and have a
 

1577
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,750
have to operationalize it and have a
theory of how it's harming kids and so

1578
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:11,760
theory of how it's harming kids and so
 

1579
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,070
theory of how it's harming kids and so
almost all of the research is done on

1580
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:14,080
almost all of the research is done on
 

1581
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,230
almost all of the research is done on
what's called the dose response model

1582
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:16,240
what's called the dose response model
 

1583
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,269
what's called the dose response model
that is

1584
00:26:17,269 --> 00:26:17,279
that is
 

1585
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,190
that is
everybody including the researchers are

1586
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:19,200
everybody including the researchers are
 

1587
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,630
everybody including the researchers are
thinking about this like let's they

1588
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:20,640

for girls between 11 and 13. so there is
no way to make it safe for pre-teens or

1744
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:50,480
no way to make it safe for pre-teens or
 

1745
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,470
no way to make it safe for pre-teens or
even 13 14 year olds we've gotta kids

1746
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:52,480
even 13 14 year olds we've gotta kids
 

1747
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,029
even 13 14 year olds we've gotta kids
should simply not be allowed on

1748
00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:55,039
should simply not be allowed on
 

1749
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,630
should simply not be allowed on
these business models

1750
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:56,640
these business models
 

1751
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,070
these business models
where you're the product they should not

1752
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:58,080
where you're the product they should not
 

1753
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,669
where you're the product they should not
be allowed until you're 16. we need to

1754
00:28:59,669 --> 00:28:59,679
be allowed until you're 16. we need to
 

1755
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,110
be allowed until you're 16. we need to
raise the agent and force it that's the

1756
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:01,120
raise the agent and force it that's the
 

1757
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,710
raise the agent and force it that's the
biggest thing so i think that's a really

1758
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:02,720
biggest thing so i think that's a really
 

1759
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,870
biggest thing so i think that's a really
powerful solution but

1760
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:04,880
powerful solution but
 

1761
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,110
powerful solution but
it's a

1762
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:07,120
it's a
 

1763
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,549
it's a
it makes me wonder if there's other

1764
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:08,559
it makes me wonder if there's other
 

1765
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,830
it makes me wonder if there's other
solutions

1766
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:10,840
solutions
 

1767
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,510
solutions
like controlling the virality of

1768
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:13,520
like controlling the virality of
 

1769
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,510
like controlling the virality of
bullying

1770
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:15,520
bullying
 

1771
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,070
bullying
so sort of if there's a way that's more

1772
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:18,080
so sort of if there's a way that's more
 

1773
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,310
so sort of if there's a way that's more
productive to childhood

1774
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:20,320
productive to childhood
 

1775
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,149
productive to childhood
to use social media so of course one

1776
00:29:22,149 --> 00:29:22,159
to use social media so of course one
 

1777
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,310
to use social media so of course one
thing is putting your phone down but

1778
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:24,320
thing is putting your phone down but
 

1779
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,669
thing is putting your phone down but
first of all from the perspective of

1780
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:25,679
first of all from the perspective of
 

1781
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,909
first of all from the perspective of
social media companies i it might be

1782
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:27,919
social media companies i it might be
 

1783
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,990
social media companies i it might be
difficult to convince them to do so

1784
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:30,000
difficult to convince them to do so
 

1785
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,950
difficult to convince them to do so
uh

1786
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:30,960
uh
 

1787
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,310
uh
and also

1788
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:32,320
and also
 

1789
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,789
and also
for me as an adult who grew up without

1790
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:34,799
for me as an adult who grew up without
 

1791
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,549
for me as an adult who grew up without
social media

1792
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:36,559
social media
 

1793
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:37,750
social media
it's so

1794
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:37,760
it's so
 

1795
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,669
it's so
social media is a source of joy so i

1796
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:39,679
social media is a source of joy so i
 

1797
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:40,630
social media is a source of joy so i
wonder

1798
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:40,640
wonder
 

1799
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,149
wonder
if it's possible to design the

1800
00:29:42,149 --> 00:29:42,159
if it's possible to design the
 

1801
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,430
if it's possible to design the
mechanisms

1802
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:43,440
mechanisms
 

1803
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,269
mechanisms
both the

1804
00:29:45,269 --> 00:29:45,279
both the
 

1805
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,350
both the
challenge the ad driven model but

1806
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:47,360
challenge the ad driven model but
 

1807
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,549
challenge the ad driven model but
actually just technically the

1808
00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:48,559
actually just technically the
 

1809
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,870
actually just technically the
recommender system

1810
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:50,880
recommender system
 

1811
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,350
recommender system
and how viral

1812
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:53,360
and how viral
 

1813
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,430
and how viral
how virality works on these platforms if

1814
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:55,440
how virality works on these platforms if
 

1815
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,230
how virality works on these platforms if
it's possible to design a platform that

1816
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:58,240
it's possible to design a platform that
 

1817
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,950
it's possible to design a platform that
leads to growth anti-fragility but does

1818
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:00,960
leads to growth anti-fragility but does
 

1819
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,590
leads to growth anti-fragility but does
not lead to depression

1820
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:03,600
not lead to depression
 

1821
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,389
not lead to depression
self-harm and suicide that like finding

1822
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:06,399
self-harm and suicide that like finding
 

1823
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,630
self-harm and suicide that like finding
that balance and making that is the

1824
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:08,640
that balance and making that is the
 

1825
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,630
that balance and making that is the
objective function not

1826
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:10,640
objective function not
 

1827
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,190
objective function not
not engagement yeah or

1828
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:13,200
not engagement yeah or
 

1829
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,950
not engagement yeah or
i don't think i don't think that can be

1830
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:14,960
i don't think i don't think that can be
 

1831
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,430
i don't think i don't think that can be
done for kids so i am very reluctant to

1832
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:17,440
done for kids so i am very reluctant to
 

1833
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,029
done for kids so i am very reluctant to
tell adults what to do i have a lot of

1834
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:19,039
tell adults what to do i have a lot of

tell adults what to do i have a lot of
libertarian friends and i would lose

1836
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:20,799
libertarian friends and i would lose
 

1837
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,470
libertarian friends and i would lose
their friendship if i started saying oh

1838
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:22,480
their friendship if i started saying oh
 

1839
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,230
their friendship if i started saying oh
it's bad for adults and we should stop

1840
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:24,240
it's bad for adults and we should stop
 

1841
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,070
it's bad for adults and we should stop
adults from using it yeah but by the

1842

adults from using it yeah but by the
 

1843
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,750
adults from using it yeah but by the

thing which is healthy for kids which is
 

1875
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,149
thing which is healthy for kids which is
free play we already robbed them of most

1876
00:30:58,149 --> 00:30:58,159
free play we already robbed them of most
 

1877
00:30:58,159 --> 00:30:59,669
free play we already robbed them of most
of it in the 90s

1878
00:30:59,669 --> 00:30:59,679
of it in the 90s
 

1879
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:00,789
of it in the 90s
the more time they spend on their

1880
00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:00,799
the more time they spend on their
 

1881
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,870
the more time they spend on their
devices the less they have free play

1882
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:02,880
devices the less they have free play
 

1883
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,389
devices the less they have free play
video games is a kind of play i'm not

1884
00:31:04,389 --> 00:31:04,399
video games is a kind of play i'm not
 

1885
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,549
video games is a kind of play i'm not
saying that these things are all bad

1886
00:31:06,549 --> 00:31:06,559
saying that these things are all bad
 

1887
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,310
saying that these things are all bad
but you know 12 hours of video game play

1888
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:08,320
but you know 12 hours of video game play
 

1889
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,389
but you know 12 hours of video game play
means you don't get any physical play

1890
00:31:10,389 --> 00:31:10,399
means you don't get any physical play
 

1891
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,470
means you don't get any physical play
um so and ultimately physical play is

1892
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:12,480
um so and ultimately physical play is
 

1893
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,909
um so and ultimately physical play is
the way

1894
00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:13,919
the way
 

1895
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:14,950
the way
uh to

1896
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:14,960
uh to
 

1897
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,310
uh to
to develop

1898
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:16,320
to develop
 

1899
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,230
to develop
physical to fragility and especially

1900
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:18,240
physical to fragility and especially
 

1901
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,549
physical to fragility and especially

the correlational studies are pretty
 

1923
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,269
the correlational studies are pretty
clear and the effect sizes are coming in

1924
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:39,279
clear and the effect sizes are coming in
 

1925
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,909
clear and the effect sizes are coming in
around 0.1 to 0.15 whether you call that

1926
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:41,919
around 0.1 to 0.15 whether you call that

a correlation coefficient or a beta it's
 

1929
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,029
a correlation coefficient or a beta it's
all in the standardized beta it's all in

all in the standardized beta it's all in
 

1931
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,269
all in the standardized beta it's all in
that sort of sort of range

1932

that sort of sort of range
 

1933

there's also experimental evidence we

1934
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:48,720
there's also experimental evidence we
 

1935
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,310
there's also experimental evidence we
collect uh true experiments with random

1936

collect uh true experiments with random
 

1937

to maximize the long-term happiness and

2104
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:34,720
to maximize the long-term happiness and
 

2105
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,389

so not just engagement so consider but
 

2109
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,869
so not just engagement so consider but
the person is not the customer so the

2110
00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:40,879
the person is not the customer so the
 

2111
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,470
the person is not the customer so the
thing is not to make them happy it's to

2112
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:42,480
thing is not to make them happy it's to
 

2113
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,589
thing is not to make them happy it's to
keep them on

2114
00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:43,599
keep them on
 

2115
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:44,950

that's the way it is currently right

2116
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:44,960
that's the way it is currently right
 

2117
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,310
that's the way it is currently right
that driven if we can get a business

2118
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:46,320
that driven if we can get a business
 

2119
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,310
that driven if we can get a business
model as you're saying i'd be all for it

2120
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:48,320
model as you're saying i'd be all for it
 

2121
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,230
model as you're saying i'd be all for it
and and i think that's the way to make

2122
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:50,240
and and i think that's the way to make
 

2123
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,149
and and i think that's the way to make
much more money so like a subscription

2124
00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:52,159
much more money so like a subscription
 

2125
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,349
much more money so like a subscription
model where

2126
00:34:53,349 --> 00:34:53,359
model where
 

2127
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,510
model where
the money comes from paying it's

2128
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:55,520
the money comes from paying it's
 

2129
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,030
the money comes from paying it's
it's not

2130
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:57,040
it's not
 

2131
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,069
it's not
that would work wouldn't it that would

2132
00:34:58,069 --> 00:34:58,079
that would work wouldn't it that would
 

2133
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,510
that would work wouldn't it that would
help so subscription definitely would

2134
00:34:59,510 --> 00:34:59,520
help so subscription definitely would
 

2135
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,829
help so subscription definitely would
help but i'm not sure it's so much i

2136
00:35:01,829 --> 00:35:01,839
help but i'm not sure it's so much i
 

2137

2909
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:37,750
omar wasau
and wasa's study showed that when you

2910
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:37,760
and wasa's study showed that when you
 

2911
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,270
and wasa's study showed that when you
look back at the 60s you see that where

2912
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:39,280
look back at the 60s you see that where
 

2913
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,790
look back at the 60s you see that where
there were violent protests it tended to

there were violent protests it tended to
backfire peaceful protests tend to work

2916
00:47:43,589 --> 00:47:43,599
backfire peaceful protests tend to work
 

2917
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,150
backfire peaceful protests tend to work
and so he simply tweeted that study

2918
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:46,160
and so he simply tweeted that study
 

2919
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,829
and so he simply tweeted that study
and there was a twitter mob after him

2920
00:47:47,829 --> 00:47:47,839
and there was a twitter mob after him
 

2921
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:50,390
and there was a twitter mob after him
this was insensitive this was

2922
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:50,400
this was insensitive this was
 

2923
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,870
this was insensitive this was
anti-black it i think he was accused of

anti-black it i think he was accused of
and he was fired within a day or two

2926
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:54,960
and he was fired within a day or two
 

2927
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,030
and he was fired within a day or two
so this is the kind of dynamic this is

2928
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:57,040
so this is the kind of dynamic this is
 

2929
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,270

00:59:03,109 --> 00:59:03,119
um so he's got those duties and i think
 

3619
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:04,470
um so he's got those duties and i think
he you know you can say he's being

figured out um for how to do this and so
 

4133
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:30,470

see
 

4221
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:01,030
see
you're saying it's a step in the right

4222
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:01,040
you're saying it's a step in the right
 

4223

you're saying it's a step in the right
direction

4224
01:09:02,149 --> 01:09:02,159
direction
 

4225
01:09:02,159 --> 01:09:05,349
direction
to at least verify the humanness

4226
01:09:05,349 --> 01:09:05,359
to at least verify the humanness
 

4227
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:06,630
to at least verify the humanness
of

4228
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:06,640
of
 

4229
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,789
of
of a person while maintaining anonymity

4230
01:09:08,789 --> 01:09:08,799
of a person while maintaining anonymity
 

4231
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:10,149
of a person while maintaining anonymity
but the

4232
01:09:10,149 --> 01:09:10,159
but the
 

4233
01:09:10,159 --> 01:09:12,630
but the
so that's one step but the further step

4234
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:12,640
so that's one step but the further step
 

4235
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:14,309
so that's one step but the further step
that's maybe

4236
01:09:14,309 --> 01:09:14,319
that's maybe
 

4237
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:15,910
that's maybe
doesn't go all the way because you can

4238
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:15,920
doesn't go all the way because you can
 

4239
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,749
doesn't go all the way because you can
still figure out ways to create multiple

4240
01:09:17,749 --> 01:09:17,759
still figure out ways to create multiple
 

4241
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:19,349
still figure out ways to create multiple
accounts and you can but it's a lot

4242
01:09:19,349 --> 01:09:19,359
accounts and you can but it's a lot
 

4243
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:21,269
accounts and you can but it's a lot
harder so actually there's a lot of ways

4244
01:09:21,269 --> 01:09:21,279
harder so actually there's a lot of ways
 

4245
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:22,709
harder so actually there's a lot of ways
to do this there's a lot of creativity

4246
01:09:22,709 --> 01:09:22,719
to do this there's a lot of creativity
 

4247
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:24,229
to do this there's a lot of creativity
out there about solving this problem so

is keyed to your phone so you do have to
 

4285
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,550
is keyed to your phone so you do have to
have a phone number

4286
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:02,560
have a phone number
 

4287
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,709
have a phone number
um and of course you can

4288
01:10:04,709 --> 01:10:04,719
um and of course you can
 

4289
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:06,229
um and of course you can
buy seven different phone numbers if you

4290
01:10:06,229 --> 01:10:06,239
buy seven different phone numbers if you
 

4291
01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:07,669
buy seven different phone numbers if you
want but it's going to be about 20 or 30

4292
01:10:07,669 --> 01:10:07,679
want but it's going to be about 20 or 30
 

4293
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:09,590
want but it's going to be about 20 or 30
dollars a month so nobody's gonna buy a

4294
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:09,600
dollars a month so nobody's gonna buy a
 

4295
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,390
dollars a month so nobody's gonna buy a
thousand phones um so yeah you know you

4296
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:12,400
thousand phones um so yeah you know you
 

4297
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,870
thousand phones um so yeah you know you
can uh um you don't have just one unique

4298
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:14,880
can uh um you don't have just one unique
 

4299
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,510
can uh um you don't have just one unique
id but most people do and nobody has a

4300
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:17,520
id but most people do and nobody has a
 

4301
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,910
id but most people do and nobody has a
thousand so just there just things like

4302
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:19,920
thousand so just there just things like
 

4303
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,430
thousand so just there just things like
this that would make an enormous

4304
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:21,440
this that would make an enormous
 

4305
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:23,110
this that would make an enormous
difference so here's the way that i

4306
01:10:23,110 --> 01:10:23,120
difference so here's the way that i
 

4307
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:24,709
difference so here's the way that i
think about it

4308
01:10:24,709 --> 01:10:24,719
think about it
 

4309
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:26,550
think about it
imagine a public square in which the

4310
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:26,560

know one troll can ruin it for everybody
if there's a thousand of us in the

4326
01:10:42,630 --> 01:10:42,640
if there's a thousand of us in the
 

4327
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:45,350
if there's a thousand of us in the
public square and ten are incentivized

4328
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:45,360

it's bringing us down
 

4343
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:01,350
it's bringing us down
imagine if we change the incentives

4344
01:11:01,350 --> 01:11:01,360
imagine if we change the incentives
 

4345
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,630
imagine if we change the incentives
imagine if the incentive was to be

4346
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:02,640
imagine if the incentive was to be
 

4347
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:04,870
imagine if the incentive was to be
constructive um and so this is an idea

4348
01:11:04,870 --> 01:11:04,880
constructive um and so this is an idea
 

4349
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:05,910
constructive um and so this is an idea
that i've been kicking around i talked

4350
01:11:05,910 --> 01:11:05,920
that i've been kicking around i talked
 

4351
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,669
that i've been kicking around i talked
about with reid hoffman last week and he

4352
01:11:07,669 --> 01:11:07,679
about with reid hoffman last week and he
 

4353
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:10,149
about with reid hoffman last week and he
seemed to think it's a good idea

4354
01:11:10,149 --> 01:11:10,159
seemed to think it's a good idea
 

4355
01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:11,510
seemed to think it's a good idea
and it is

4356
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:11,520
and it is
 

4357
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:13,350
and it is
uh it would be very easy

4358
01:11:13,350 --> 01:11:13,360
uh it would be very easy
 

4359
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,910
uh it would be very easy
to um rather than trying to focus on

4360
01:11:15,910 --> 01:11:15,920
to um rather than trying to focus on

4364
01:11:21,830 --> 01:11:21,840
focus on users what users are incredibly
 

4365
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:23,830
focus on users what users are incredibly
aggressive and so people just use a lot

4366
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:23,840
aggressive and so people just use a lot
 

4367
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,750
aggressive and so people just use a lot
of obstetry and explanation exclamation

learning models involved
 

4433
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,470

and i believe that the nastiness

01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:26,480
and i believe that the nastiness
 

4435
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,550
and i believe that the nastiness
classification is a difficult problem

classification is a difficult problem
 

4437
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,229
classification is a difficult problem
automatically i'm sure it is so i

01:12:30,229 --> 01:12:30,239
automatically i'm sure it is so i
 

4439

automatically i'm sure it is so i
personally believe

01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:33,350
personally believe
in

in
 

4443

in
uh crowdsourced nastiness labeling but

01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:36,560
uh crowdsourced nastiness labeling but
 

4445
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,790
uh crowdsourced nastiness labeling but
in an objective way where it doesn't

01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:38,800
in an objective way where it doesn't
 

4447

um but more sort of objectively is is

4452
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:46,640
um but more sort of objectively is is
 

4453
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:49,669
um but more sort of objectively is is
this a shitty almost out of context

4454
01:12:49,669 --> 01:12:49,679
this a shitty almost out of context
 

4455
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:52,310
this a shitty almost out of context
with only local context

4456
01:12:52,310 --> 01:12:52,320
with only local context
 

4457
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:53,830
with only local context
is this a shitty thing to say at this

4458
01:12:53,830 --> 01:12:53,840
is this a shitty thing to say at this
 

4459
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,910
is this a shitty thing to say at this
moment because here's the thing no but

4460
01:12:55,910 --> 01:12:55,920
moment because here's the thing no but
 

4461
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,750
moment because here's the thing no but
we don't care about individual posts no

4462
01:12:57,750 --> 01:12:57,760
we don't care about individual posts no
 

4463
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,189
we don't care about individual posts no
no but it's all that matters is the

4464
01:12:59,189 --> 01:12:59,199
no but it's all that matters is the
 

4465
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:01,270
no but it's all that matters is the
average the posts make the man they do

4466
01:13:01,270 --> 01:13:01,280
average the posts make the man they do
 

4467
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:03,189
average the posts make the man they do
but but the point is as long as we're

4468
01:13:03,189 --> 01:13:03,199
but but the point is as long as we're
 

4469
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:04,709
but but the point is as long as we're
talking about averages here if one

4470
01:13:04,709 --> 01:13:04,719
talking about averages here if one
 

4471
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:06,630
talking about averages here if one
person has a misclassified post it

4472
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:06,640
person has a misclassified post it
 

4473
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,149
person has a misclassified post it
doesn't matter right

4474
01:13:08,149 --> 01:13:08,159
doesn't matter right
 

4475
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:10,070
doesn't matter right
yeah yeah so but you need to classify

4476
01:13:10,070 --> 01:13:10,080
yeah yeah so but you need to classify
 

4477
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,830
yeah yeah so but you need to classify
posts in order to build up the average

4478
01:13:11,830 --> 01:13:11,840
posts in order to build up the average
 

4479
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,990
posts in order to build up the average
that's that's what i mean and so

4480
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:14,000
that's that's what i mean and so
 

4481
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,790
that's that's what i mean and so
i i really like that idea whatev the

4482
01:13:16,790 --> 01:13:16,800
i i really like that idea whatev the
 

4483
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,790
i i really like that idea whatev the
high level idea of

4484
01:13:18,790 --> 01:13:18,800
high level idea of
 

4485
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,709
high level idea of
incentivizing people

4486
01:13:20,709 --> 01:13:20,719
incentivizing people
 

4487
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:22,550
incentivizing people
to be less shitty yeah because that's

4488
01:13:22,550 --> 01:13:22,560
to be less shitty yeah because that's
 

4489
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:25,110
to be less shitty yeah because that's
what we have that incentive in real life

4490
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:25,120
what we have that incentive in real life
 

4491
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:26,709
what we have that incentive in real life
yeah that's right it's actually really

4492
01:13:26,709 --> 01:13:26,719
yeah that's right it's actually really
 

4493
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:29,030
yeah that's right it's actually really
painful to be in a full-time asshole i

4494
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:29,040
painful to be in a full-time asshole i
 

4495
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:30,830
painful to be in a full-time asshole i
think in physical

4496
01:13:30,830 --> 01:13:30,840
think in physical
 

4497
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:32,149
think in physical
reality right and it's shut off it

4498
01:13:32,149 --> 01:13:32,159
reality right and it's shut off it
 

4499
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:34,470
reality right and it's shut off it
should be it should be also a pain

4500
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:34,480
should be it should be also a pain
 

4501
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,550
should be it should be also a pain
to be an asshole on on the internet and

4502
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:36,560
to be an asshole on on the internet and
 

4503
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:37,910
to be an asshole on on the internet and
there could be different mechanisms for

4504
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:37,920
there could be different mechanisms for
 

4505
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:40,310
there could be different mechanisms for
that i wish ai was there machine

4506
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:40,320
that i wish ai was there machine
 

4507
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:41,750
that i wish ai was there machine
learning models were there i did they

4508
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:41,760
learning models were there i did they
 

4509
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,590
learning models were there i did they
just aren't yet but how about how about

4510
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:43,600
just aren't yet but how about how about
 

4511
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,750
just aren't yet but how about how about
we have so one track is we have ai

4512
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:45,760
we have so one track is we have ai
 

4513
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,270
we have so one track is we have ai
machine learning models and they render

4514
01:13:47,270 --> 01:13:47,280
machine learning models and they render
 

4515
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:49,590
machine learning models and they render
a verdict another class is crowdsourcing

4516
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:49,600
a verdict another class is crowdsourcing
 

4517
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:50,950
a verdict another class is crowdsourcing
you get correct and then and then

4518
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:50,960
you get correct and then and then
 

4519
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,110
you get correct and then and then
whenever the two disagree you have

4520
01:13:53,110 --> 01:13:53,120
whenever the two disagree you have

you know staff at twitter or whatever

4522
01:13:55,110 --> 01:13:55,120
you know staff at twitter or whatever
 

4523
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:56,229
you know staff at twitter or whatever
you know they look at it and they say

4524
01:13:56,229 --> 01:13:56,239
you know they look at it and they say
 

4525
01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:57,830
you know they look at it and they say
what's going on here and that way you

4526
01:13:57,830 --> 01:13:57,840
what's going on here and that way you
 

4527
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,910
what's going on here and that way you
can refine both the ai and you can

4528
01:13:59,910 --> 01:13:59,920
can refine both the ai and you can
 

4529
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:01,270
can refine both the ai and you can
refine whatever the algorithms are for

4530
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:01,280
refine whatever the algorithms are for
 

4531
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:02,470
refine whatever the algorithms are for
the crowd source and because of course

4532
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:02,480
the crowd source and because of course
 

4533
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:03,990
the crowd source and because of course
that can be gamed and people can only

01:14:03,990 --> 01:14:04,000
that can be gamed and people can only

01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,430
that can be gamed and people can only

aggressive you know so so you wouldn't

4538
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:07,600
aggressive you know so so you wouldn't
 

4539
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,350

want just to rely on one single track

4540
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:09,360
want just to rely on one single track
 

4541
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:10,870
want just to rely on one single track
but if you have two tracks i think you

4542
01:14:10,870 --> 01:14:10,880
but if you have two tracks i think you
 

4543
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,790
but if you have two tracks i think you
could do it

4544
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:12,800
could do it
 

4545
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:13,910
could do it
what do you think about this word

4546
01:14:13,910 --> 01:14:13,920
what do you think about this word
 

4547
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:17,110
what do you think about this word
misinformation that maybe connects to

4548
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:17,120
misinformation that maybe connects to
 

4549
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:19,430
misinformation that maybe connects to
our two discussions now so one is a

4550
01:14:19,430 --> 01:14:19,440
our two discussions now so one is a
 

4551
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:21,669
our two discussions now so one is a
discussion of social media and uh

4552
01:14:21,669 --> 01:14:21,679
discussion of social media and uh
 

4553
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:23,510
discussion of social media and uh

01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:12,400
can we stop them from existing the
 

4895
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:13,750
can we stop them from existing the
question is

4896
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:13,760
question is
 

4897
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,750
question is
what platforms what are the platforms by

4898
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:15,760
what platforms what are the platforms by
 

4899
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:17,590
what platforms what are the platforms by
which they spread all over the world and

4900
01:20:17,590 --> 01:20:17,600
which they spread all over the world and
 

4901
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:19,590
which they spread all over the world and
into every little town so that the one

4902
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:19,600
into every little town so that the one
 

4903
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,750
into every little town so that the one
percent of whatever whatever percentage

4904
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:21,760
percent of whatever whatever percentage
 

4905
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,669
percent of whatever whatever percentage
of young men are vulnerable to this that

4906
01:20:23,669 --> 01:20:23,679
of young men are vulnerable to this that
 

4907
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:25,830
of young men are vulnerable to this that
they they get exposed to it it's in the

4908
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:25,840
they they get exposed to it it's in the
 

4909
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,669
they they get exposed to it it's in the
dynamics in the architecture

4910
01:20:27,669 --> 01:20:27,679
dynamics in the architecture
 

4911
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:29,590
dynamics in the architecture
it's a fascinating point to think about

4912
01:20:29,590 --> 01:20:29,600
it's a fascinating point to think about
 

4913
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,830
it's a fascinating point to think about
because we often

4914
01:20:31,830 --> 01:20:31,840
because we often
 

4915
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,390
because we often
debate and think about the

4916
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:34,400
debate and think about the
 

4917
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:35,990
debate and think about the
the content moderation the censorship

4918
01:20:35,990 --> 01:20:36,000
the content moderation the censorship
 

4919
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,430
the content moderation the censorship
the ideas of free speech but you're

4920
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:37,440
the ideas of free speech but you're
 

4921
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:38,470
the ideas of free speech but you're
saying

4922
01:20:38,470 --> 01:20:38,480
saying
 

4923
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,629
saying
yes that's important to talk about but

4924
01:20:40,629 --> 01:20:40,639
yes that's important to talk about but
 

4925
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:42,149
yes that's important to talk about but
much more important is fixing the

4926
01:20:42,149 --> 01:20:42,159
much more important is fixing the
 

4927
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:43,669
much more important is fixing the
dynamics that's right because everyone

4928
01:20:43,669 --> 01:20:43,679
dynamics that's right because everyone
 

4929
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:45,110
dynamics that's right because everyone
thinks if there's regulation it means

4930
01:20:45,110 --> 01:20:45,120
thinks if there's regulation it means
 

4931
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,470
thinks if there's regulation it means
censorship at least people on the right

4932
01:20:46,470 --> 01:20:46,480
censorship at least people on the right
 

4933
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:49,110
censorship at least people on the right
think regulation equals censorship and

4934
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:49,120
think regulation equals censorship and
 

4935
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:51,430
think regulation equals censorship and
i'm trying to say no no that's only if

4936
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:51,440
i'm trying to say no no that's only if
 

4937
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:52,950
i'm trying to say no no that's only if
all we talk about is content moderation

4938
01:20:52,950 --> 01:20:52,960
all we talk about is content moderation
 

4939
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:55,110
all we talk about is content moderation
well then yes that is the framework you

4940
01:20:55,110 --> 01:20:55,120
well then yes that is the framework you
 

4941
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:56,790
well then yes that is the framework you
know how much or how little do we you

4942
01:20:56,790 --> 01:20:56,800
know how much or how little do we you
 

4943
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:59,110
know how much or how little do we you
know but i don't want to talk about that

4944
01:20:59,110 --> 01:20:59,120
know but i don't want to talk about that
 

4945
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,310
know but i don't want to talk about that
because all the action is in the

4946
01:21:00,310 --> 01:21:00,320
because all the action is in the
 

4947
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:01,910
because all the action is in the
dynamics that's the point of my article

4948
01:21:01,910 --> 01:21:01,920
dynamics that's the point of my article
 

4949
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:03,669
dynamics that's the point of my article
it's the architecture changed and our

4950
01:21:03,669 --> 01:21:03,679
it's the architecture changed and our
 

4951
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:05,350
it's the architecture changed and our
social world went insane

4952
01:21:05,350 --> 01:21:05,360
social world went insane
 

4953
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,070
social world went insane
so

4954
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:06,080
so
 

4955
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:09,350
so
can you try to steal man the other side

4956
01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:09,360
can you try to steal man the other side
 

4957
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:10,229
can you try to steal man the other side
so

4958
01:21:10,229 --> 01:21:10,239
so
 

4959
01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:12,149
so
the people that might say that social

4960
01:21:12,149 --> 01:21:12,159
the people that might say that social
 

4961
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:15,350
the people that might say that social
media is good for society overall

4962
01:21:15,350 --> 01:21:15,360
media is good for society overall
 

4963
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:17,669
media is good for society overall
both in the dimension of mental health

4964
01:21:17,669 --> 01:21:17,679
both in the dimension of mental health
 

4965
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:21,750
both in the dimension of mental health
as as mark said for teenagers teenage

4966
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:21,760
as as mark said for teenagers teenage
 

4967
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:22,950
as as mark said for teenagers teenage
girls

4968
01:21:22,950 --> 01:21:22,960
girls
 

4969
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:25,350
girls
and for our democracy yes there's a lot

4970
01:21:25,350 --> 01:21:25,360
and for our democracy yes there's a lot
 

4971
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:28,790
and for our democracy yes there's a lot
of negative things but that's

4972
01:21:28,790 --> 01:21:28,800
of negative things but that's
 

4973
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,430
of negative things but that's
slices of data if you look at the whole

4974
01:21:31,430 --> 01:21:31,440
slices of data if you look at the whole
 

4975
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,350
slices of data if you look at the whole
which is difficult to measure it's

4976
01:21:33,350 --> 01:21:33,360
which is difficult to measure it's
 

4977
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:36,310
which is difficult to measure it's
actually good for society and it to the

4978
01:21:36,310 --> 01:21:36,320
actually good for society and it to the
 

4979
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:37,750
actually good for society and it to the
degree that it's not good it's getting

4980
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:37,760
degree that it's not good it's getting
 

4981
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,110
degree that it's not good it's getting
better and better is it possible to

4982
01:21:39,110 --> 01:21:39,120
better and better is it possible to
 

4983
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,350
better and better is it possible to
steal another point yeah

4984
01:21:41,350 --> 01:21:41,360
steal another point yeah
 

4985
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:43,110
steal another point yeah
it's it's hard but i should be able to

4986
01:21:43,110 --> 01:21:43,120
it's it's hard but i should be able to
 

4987
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:44,390
it's it's hard but i should be able to
do it um

4988
01:21:44,390 --> 01:21:44,400
do it um
 

4989
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:45,750
do it um
i need to put my money where my mouth is

4990
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:45,760
i need to put my money where my mouth is
 

4991
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:47,270
i need to put my money where my mouth is
and that's a good question so on the

4992
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:47,280
and that's a good question so on the
 

4993
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:49,030
and that's a good question so on the
mental health front

4994
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:49,040
mental health front
 

4995
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:50,870
mental health front
um you know the argument is usually what

4996
01:21:50,870 --> 01:21:50,880
um you know the argument is usually what
 

4997
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:53,030
um you know the argument is usually what
the the what they say is well you know

4998
01:21:53,030 --> 01:21:53,040
the the what they say is well you know
 

4999
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:54,550
the the what they say is well you know
for communities that are cut off

5000
01:21:54,550 --> 01:21:54,560
for communities that are cut off
 

5001
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:57,750
for communities that are cut off
especially lgbtq kids they can find each

5002
01:21:57,750 --> 01:21:57,760
especially lgbtq kids they can find each
 

5003
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,870
especially lgbtq kids they can find each
other

5004
01:21:58,870 --> 01:21:58,880
other
 

5005
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:01,189
other
so it's it's it it connects kids

5006
01:22:01,189 --> 01:22:01,199
so it's it's it it connects kids
 

5007
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:02,310
so it's it's it it connects kids
especially kids who wouldn't find

5008
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:02,320
especially kids who wouldn't find
 

5009
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,709
especially kids who wouldn't find
connection otherwise

5010
01:22:04,709 --> 01:22:04,719
connection otherwise
 

5011
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:05,910
connection otherwise
it

5012
01:22:05,910 --> 01:22:05,920
it
 

5013
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:08,229
it
exposes you to a range of ideas and

5014
01:22:08,229 --> 01:22:08,239
exposes you to a range of ideas and
 

5015
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:10,870
exposes you to a range of ideas and
content

5016
01:22:10,870 --> 01:22:10,880
content
 

5017
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,550
content
and

5018
01:22:12,550 --> 01:22:12,560
and
 

5019
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,790
and
it's fun

5020
01:22:14,790 --> 01:22:14,800
it's fun
 

5021
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,709
it's fun
is there in the studies you looked at is

5022
01:22:16,709 --> 01:22:16,719
is there in the studies you looked at is
 

5023
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:18,390
is there in the studies you looked at is
there inklings of

5024
01:22:18,390 --> 01:22:18,400
there inklings of
 

5025
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,470
there inklings of
of data that's

5026
01:22:20,470 --> 01:22:20,480
of data that's
 

5027
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:22,629
of data that's
maybe early data that shows that there

5028
01:22:22,629 --> 01:22:22,639
maybe early data that shows that there
 

5029
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:24,070
maybe early data that shows that there
is positive effects in terms of

5030
01:22:24,070 --> 01:22:24,080
is positive effects in terms of
 

5031
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:25,910
is positive effects in terms of
self-report data or

5032
01:22:25,910 --> 01:22:25,920
self-report data or
 

5033
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,270
self-report data or
how would you measure behavioral

5034
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:27,280
how would you measure behavioral
 

5035
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:28,550
how would you measure behavioral
positive uh

5036
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:28,560
positive uh
 

5037
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:31,270
positive uh
it's difficult right so um

5038
01:22:31,270 --> 01:22:31,280
it's difficult right so um
 

5039
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,189
it's difficult right so um
so if you look at how do you feel when

5040
01:22:33,189 --> 01:22:33,199
so if you look at how do you feel when
 

5041
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:35,270
so if you look at how do you feel when
you're on the platform you get a mix of

5042
01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:35,280
you're on the platform you get a mix of
 

5043
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:37,510
you're on the platform you get a mix of
positive and negative uh and people say

5044
01:22:37,510 --> 01:22:37,520
positive and negative uh and people say
 

5045
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:38,950
positive and negative uh and people say
they feel supported and this is what

5046
01:22:38,950 --> 01:22:38,960
they feel supported and this is what
 

5047
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:41,110
they feel supported and this is what
mark was referring to when he said you

5048
01:22:41,110 --> 01:22:41,120
mark was referring to when he said you
 

5049
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,030
mark was referring to when he said you
know there was like 18 criteria and on

5050
01:22:43,030 --> 01:22:43,040
know there was like 18 criteria and on
 

5051
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:44,629
know there was like 18 criteria and on
most it was positive and on some was

5052
01:22:44,629 --> 01:22:44,639
most it was positive and on some was
 

5053
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:45,510
most it was positive and on some was
negative

spain and in a lot of areas martin guri
talks about this

5220
01:25:21,669 --> 01:25:21,679
talks about this
 

5221
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:24,709
talks about this
so there certainly was a case to be made

5222
01:25:24,709 --> 01:25:24,719
so there certainly was a case to be made
 

5223
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:25,750
so there certainly was a case to be made
that

5224
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:25,760
that
 

5225
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,270

democracy

5230
01:25:30,790 --> 01:25:30,800
democracy
 

5231
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,629
democracy
what dictator could possibly keep out

5232
01:25:32,629 --> 01:25:32,639
what dictator could possibly keep out
 

5233
01:25:32,639 --> 01:25:34,950
what dictator could possibly keep out
the internet what dictator could stand

5234
01:25:34,950 --> 01:25:34,960
the internet what dictator could stand
 

5235
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:36,790
the internet what dictator could stand
up to people connected on these digital

5236
01:25:36,790 --> 01:25:36,800
up to people connected on these digital
 

5237
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,790
up to people connected on these digital
media platforms so that's the strong

5238
01:25:38,790 --> 01:25:38,800
media platforms so that's the strong
 

5239
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:39,910
media platforms so that's the strong
case that this is gonna be good for

5240
01:25:39,910 --> 01:25:39,920
case that this is gonna be good for
 

5241
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:41,430
case that this is gonna be good for
democracy

5242

democracy
 

5243
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:42,470
democracy
and then we can see what happened in the

5244
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:42,480
and then we can see what happened in the
 

5245
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:46,070
and then we can see what happened in the
years after now first of all um so in

5246
01:25:46,070 --> 01:25:46,080
years after now first of all um so in
 

5247
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:48,149
years after now first of all um so in
uh in mark's response to you so here let

5248

uh in mark's response to you so here let
 

5249
01:25:48,159 --> 01:25:49,990
uh in mark's response to you so here let
me read from what he said when you

5250
01:25:49,990 --> 01:25:50,000
me read from what he said when you
 

5251
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,350
me read from what he said when you
interviewed him

5252
01:25:51,350 --> 01:25:51,360
interviewed him
 

5253
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:52,870
interviewed him
he says

5254
01:25:52,870 --> 01:25:52,880
he says
 

5255
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:54,470
he says
uh i think it's worth grounding this

5256
01:25:54,470 --> 01:25:54,480
uh i think it's worth grounding this
 

5257
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:56,310
uh i think it's worth grounding this
conversation in the actual research that

5258
01:25:56,310 --> 01:25:56,320
conversation in the actual research that
 

5259
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:58,149
conversation in the actual research that
has been done on this which by and large

5260
01:25:58,149 --> 01:25:58,159
has been done on this which by and large
 

5261
01:25:58,159 --> 01:26:00,070
has been done on this which by and large
finds that social media is not a large

5262
01:26:00,070 --> 01:26:00,080
finds that social media is not a large
 

5263
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:02,550
finds that social media is not a large
driver of polarization he says that then

5264
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:02,560
driver of polarization he says that then
 

5265
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:03,510
driver of polarization he says that then
he says

5266
01:26:03,510 --> 01:26:03,520
he says
 

5267
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,350
he says
most academic studies that i've seen

5268
01:26:05,350 --> 01:26:05,360
most academic studies that i've seen
 

5269
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,270
most academic studies that i've seen
actually show that social media use is

5270
01:26:07,270 --> 01:26:07,280
actually show that social media use is
 

5271
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:09,350
actually show that social media use is
correlated with lower polarization

5272
01:26:09,350 --> 01:26:09,360
correlated with lower polarization
 

5273
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,110
correlated with lower polarization
that's the factual claim that he makes

5274
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:11,120
that's the factual claim that he makes
 

5275
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,629
that's the factual claim that he makes
which is not true

5276
01:26:12,629 --> 01:26:12,639
which is not true
 

5277
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:14,950
which is not true
but he asserts that um study well

5278
01:26:14,950 --> 01:26:14,960
but he asserts that um study well
 

5279
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:16,149
but he asserts that um study well
actually wait it's tricky because he

5280
01:26:16,149 --> 01:26:16,159
actually wait it's tricky because he
 

5281
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:18,070
actually wait it's tricky because he
says the studies he has seen

5282
01:26:18,070 --> 01:26:18,080
says the studies he has seen
 

5283
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:19,510
says the studies he has seen
so i can't so it might be that studies

5284
01:26:19,510 --> 01:26:19,520
so i can't so it might be that studies
 

5285
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:21,669
so i can't so it might be that studies
he has seen say that but if you go to

5286
01:26:21,669 --> 01:26:21,679
he has seen say that but if you go to
 

5287
01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:23,669
he has seen say that but if you go to
the google doc with chris bale you see

5288
01:26:23,669 --> 01:26:23,679
the google doc with chris bale you see
 

5289
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:25,110
the google doc with chris bale you see
there's seven different questions that

5290
01:26:25,110 --> 01:26:25,120
there's seven different questions that
 

5291
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:27,350
there's seven different questions that
can be addressed and on one of them

5292
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:27,360
can be addressed and on one of them
 

5293
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:28,390
can be addressed and on one of them
which is

5294
01:26:28,390 --> 01:26:28,400
which is
 

5295
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:29,910
which is
filter bubbles the evidence is very

5296
01:26:29,910 --> 01:26:29,920
filter bubbles the evidence is very
 

5297
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:31,590
filter bubbles the evidence is very
mixed and you might be right that

5298
01:26:31,590 --> 01:26:31,600
mixed and you might be right that
 

5299
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:33,030
mixed and you might be right that
facebook overall doesn't contribute to

5300
01:26:33,030 --> 01:26:33,040
facebook overall doesn't contribute to
 

5301
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:34,950
facebook overall doesn't contribute to
filter bubbles but on the other six the

5302
01:26:34,950 --> 01:26:34,960
filter bubbles but on the other six the
 

5303
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:36,950
filter bubbles but on the other six the
evidence is pretty strongly on the yes

5304
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:36,960
evidence is pretty strongly on the yes
 

5305
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:39,430
evidence is pretty strongly on the yes
side it is a cause he also draws a line

5306
01:26:39,430 --> 01:26:39,440
side it is a cause he also draws a line
 

5307
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:40,790
side it is a cause he also draws a line
between the united states versus the

5308
01:26:40,790 --> 01:26:40,800
between the united states versus the
 

5309
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:42,629
between the united states versus the
rest of the world right and there's one

5310
01:26:42,629 --> 01:26:42,639
rest of the world right and there's one
 

5311
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:44,070
rest of the world right and there's one
thing true about that which is that

5312
01:26:44,070 --> 01:26:44,080
thing true about that which is that
 

5313
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:46,390
thing true about that which is that
polarization has been rising much faster

01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:47,350
populist movements and then there's
other uh sections as you mentioned yeah

5374
01:27:47,350 --> 01:27:47,360
other uh sections as you mentioned yeah
 

5375
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:49,110
other uh sections as you mentioned yeah
that's right but if you once you once

5376
01:27:49,110 --> 01:27:49,120
that's right but if you once you once
 

5377
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:51,430
that's right but if you once you once
you operationalize it as seven different

5378
01:27:51,430 --> 01:27:51,440
you operationalize it as seven different
 

5379
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:53,830
you operationalize it as seven different
questions um you know like so one is

5380
01:27:53,830 --> 01:27:53,840
questions um you know like so one is
 

5381
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,110
questions um you know like so one is
about polarization and there are

5382
01:27:55,110 --> 01:27:55,120
about polarization and there are
 

5383
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:56,470
about polarization and there are
measures of that the degree to which

5384
01:27:56,470 --> 01:27:56,480
measures of that the degree to which
 

5385
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,390
measures of that the degree to which
people say they hate the other side and

5386
01:27:58,390 --> 01:27:58,400
people say they hate the other side and
 

5387
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:00,950
people say they hate the other side and
so in this study by uh by boxell against

5388
01:28:00,950 --> 01:28:00,960
so in this study by uh by boxell against
 

5389
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:03,110
so in this study by uh by boxell against
cow and shapiro 2021

5390
01:28:03,110 --> 01:28:03,120
cow and shapiro 2021
 

5391
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:05,830
cow and shapiro 2021
um they looked at all the measures of

5392
01:28:05,830 --> 01:28:05,840
um they looked at all the measures of
 

5393
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:07,669
um they looked at all the measures of
polarization they could find going back

5394
01:28:07,669 --> 01:28:07,679
polarization they could find going back
 

5395
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:09,830
polarization they could find going back
to the 1970s for about 20 different

5396
01:28:09,830 --> 01:28:09,840
to the 1970s for about 20 different
 

5397
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:12,310
to the 1970s for about 20 different
countries and they show plots you have

5398
01:28:12,310 --> 01:28:12,320
countries and they show plots you have
 

5399
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:14,229
countries and they show plots you have
these nice plots with red lines showing

5400
01:28:14,229 --> 01:28:14,239
these nice plots with red lines showing
 

5401
01:28:14,239 --> 01:28:15,750
these nice plots with red lines showing
that in some countries it's going up

5402
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:15,760
that in some countries it's going up
 

5403
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:17,510
that in some countries it's going up
like the united states especially in

5404
01:28:17,510 --> 01:28:17,520
like the united states especially in
 

5405
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:19,189
like the united states especially in
some countries it's going down and in

5406
01:28:19,189 --> 01:28:19,199
some countries it's going down and in
 

5407
01:28:19,199 --> 01:28:21,110
some countries it's going down and in
some countries it's pretty flat and so

5408
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:21,120
some countries it's pretty flat and so
 

5409
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:23,110
some countries it's pretty flat and so
mark says well you know if if

5410
01:28:23,110 --> 01:28:23,120
mark says well you know if if
 

5411
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:24,790
mark says well you know if if
polarization's going up a lot in the us

5412
01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:24,800
polarization's going up a lot in the us
 

5413
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,229
polarization's going up a lot in the us
but not in most other countries well

5414
01:28:26,229 --> 01:28:26,239
but not in most other countries well
 

5415
01:28:26,239 --> 01:28:29,270
but not in most other countries well
maybe facebook isn't responsible but so

5416
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:29,280
maybe facebook isn't responsible but so
 

5417
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:31,110
maybe facebook isn't responsible but so
much depends on how you operationalize

5418
01:28:31,110 --> 01:28:31,120
much depends on how you operationalize
 

5419
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:33,189
much depends on how you operationalize
things are we interested in the straight

5420
01:28:33,189 --> 01:28:33,199
things are we interested in the straight
 

5421
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:35,910
things are we interested in the straight
line regression line going back to the

5422
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:35,920
line regression line going back to the
 

5423
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:37,030
line regression line going back to the
70s

5424
01:28:37,030 --> 01:28:37,040
70s
 

5425
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:38,870
70s
and if so well then he's right in what

5426
01:28:38,870 --> 01:28:38,880
and if so well then he's right in what
 

5427
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,149
and if so well then he's right in what
he says

5428
01:28:40,149 --> 01:28:40,159
he says
 

5429
01:28:40,159 --> 01:28:41,830
he says
but that's not the argument the argument

5430
01:28:41,830 --> 01:28:41,840
but that's not the argument the argument
 

5431
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:42,950
but that's not the argument the argument
isn't that

5432
01:28:42,950 --> 01:28:42,960
isn't that
 

5433
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:43,990
isn't that
you know it's been rising or falling

5434
01:28:43,990 --> 01:28:44,000
you know it's been rising or falling
 

5435
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,430
you know it's been rising or falling
since the 70s the argument is it's been

5436
01:28:45,430 --> 01:28:45,440
since the 70s the argument is it's been
 

5437
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:47,510
since the 70s the argument is it's been
rising and falling since 2012

5438
01:28:47,510 --> 01:28:47,520
rising and falling since 2012
 

5439
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:50,310
rising and falling since 2012
or so and for that now i just spoke with

5440
01:28:50,310 --> 01:28:50,320
or so and for that now i just spoke with
 

5441
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:51,430
or so and for that now i just spoke with
i just i've been emailing with the

5442
01:28:51,430 --> 01:28:51,440
i just i've been emailing with the
 

5443
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:53,270
i just i've been emailing with the
authors of the study and they say

5444
01:28:53,270 --> 01:28:53,280
authors of the study and they say
 

5445
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:54,709
authors of the study and they say
there's not really enough data to do it

5446
01:28:54,709 --> 01:28:54,719
there's not really enough data to do it
 

5447
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:56,149
there's not really enough data to do it
statistically reliably because there's

5448
01:28:56,149 --> 01:28:56,159
statistically reliably because there's
 

5449
01:28:56,159 --> 01:28:58,149
statistically reliably because there's
only a few observations after 2012. but

5450
01:28:58,149 --> 01:28:58,159
only a few observations after 2012. but
 

5451
01:28:58,159 --> 01:29:00,310
only a few observations after 2012. but
if you look at the graphs in their study

5452
01:29:00,310 --> 01:29:00,320
if you look at the graphs in their study
 

5453
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:01,750
if you look at the graphs in their study
and they actually do provide as they

5454
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:01,760
and they actually do provide as they
 

5455
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:03,430
and they actually do provide as they
pointed out to me they do provide a

5456
01:29:03,430 --> 01:29:03,440
pointed out to me they do provide a
 

5457
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:05,669
pointed out to me they do provide a
statistical test if you break the data

5458
01:29:05,669 --> 01:29:05,679
statistical test if you break the data
 

5459
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:08,310
statistical test if you break the data
at the year 2000 so actually a

5460
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:08,320
at the year 2000 so actually a
 

5461
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:11,430
at the year 2000 so actually a
polarization is going up pretty widely

5462
01:29:11,430 --> 01:29:11,440
polarization is going up pretty widely
 

5463
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:13,110
polarization is going up pretty widely
if you just look after 2000 which is

5464
01:29:13,110 --> 01:29:13,120
if you just look after 2000 which is
 

5465
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:15,750
if you just look after 2000 which is
when the internet would be influential

5466
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:15,760
when the internet would be influential
 

5467
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:17,750
when the internet would be influential
and if you look just after 2012 you have

5468
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:17,760
and if you look just after 2012 you have
 

5469
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,750
and if you look just after 2012 you have
to just do it by eye but if you do it on

5470
01:29:19,750 --> 01:29:19,760
to just do it by eye but if you do it on
 

5471
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:21,430
to just do it by eye but if you do it on
their graphs by eye you see that

5472
01:29:21,430 --> 01:29:21,440
their graphs by eye you see that
 

5473
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:23,110
their graphs by eye you see that
actually a number of countries do see a

5474
01:29:23,110 --> 01:29:23,120
actually a number of countries do see a
 

5475
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:25,110
actually a number of countries do see a
sudden sharp upturn not all not all by

5476
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:25,120
sudden sharp upturn not all not all by
 

5477
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:28,310
sudden sharp upturn not all not all by
any means but my point is mark asserts

5478
01:29:28,310 --> 01:29:28,320
any means but my point is mark asserts
 

5479
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,669
any means but my point is mark asserts
he points to one study and he points

5480
01:29:29,669 --> 01:29:29,679
he points to one study and he points
 

5481
01:29:29,679 --> 01:29:30,950
he points to one study and he points
this over and over again i have had two

5482
01:29:30,950 --> 01:29:30,960
this over and over again i have had two
 

5483
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:32,310
this over and over again i have had two
conversations with him he pointed this

5484
01:29:32,310 --> 01:29:32,320
conversations with him he pointed this
 

5485
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:34,709
conversations with him he pointed this
study both times

5486
01:29:34,709 --> 01:29:34,719
study both times
 

5487
01:29:34,719 --> 01:29:37,510
study both times
he asserts that this study shows that

5488
01:29:37,510 --> 01:29:37,520
he asserts that this study shows that
 

5489
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:39,270
he asserts that this study shows that
polarization is up some places down

5490
01:29:39,270 --> 01:29:39,280
polarization is up some places down
 

5491
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:41,830
polarization is up some places down
other places there's no association

5492
01:29:41,830 --> 01:29:41,840
other places there's no association
 

5493
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:43,110
other places there's no association
but actually

5494
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:43,120
but actually
 

5495
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:44,629
but actually
we have another section in the google

5496
01:29:44,629 --> 01:29:44,639
we have another section in the google
 

5497
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:46,310
we have another section in the google
doc where we review all the data on the

5498
01:29:46,310 --> 01:29:46,320
doc where we review all the data on the
 

5499
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:48,550
doc where we review all the data on the
decline of democracy and the high point

5500
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:48,560
decline of democracy and the high point
 

5501
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:49,990
decline of democracy and the high point
of democracy of course it was rising in

5502
01:29:49,990 --> 01:29:50,000
of democracy of course it was rising in
 

5503
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,310
of democracy of course it was rising in
the 90s but if you look around the world

5504
01:29:52,310 --> 01:29:52,320
the 90s but if you look around the world
 

5505
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:53,990
the 90s but if you look around the world
by some measures it begins to drop in

5506
01:29:53,990 --> 01:29:54,000
by some measures it begins to drop in
 

5507
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,590
by some measures it begins to drop in
the late 2000s around 20 2007 2008 by

5508
01:29:57,590 --> 01:29:57,600
the late 2000s around 20 2007 2008 by
 

5509
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:00,709
the late 2000s around 20 2007 2008 by
others it's in the early to mid uh 2010s

5510
01:30:00,709 --> 01:30:00,719
others it's in the early to mid uh 2010s
 

5511
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:03,350
others it's in the early to mid uh 2010s
the point is there is a by many measures

5512
01:30:03,350 --> 01:30:03,360
the point is there is a by many measures
 

5513
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:05,669
the point is there is a by many measures
there's a drop in the quality and the

5514
01:30:05,669 --> 01:30:05,679
there's a drop in the quality and the
 

5515
01:30:05,679 --> 01:30:07,990
there's a drop in the quality and the
number of democracies on this planet

5516
01:30:07,990 --> 01:30:08,000
number of democracies on this planet
 

5517
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,430
number of democracies on this planet
that began in the 2010s and so um yes

5518
01:30:11,430 --> 01:30:11,440
that began in the 2010s and so um yes
 

5519
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:13,350
that began in the 2010s and so um yes
mark can point to one study

5520
01:30:13,350 --> 01:30:13,360
mark can point to one study
 

5521
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:14,550
mark can point to one study
but if you look in the google doc there

5522
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:14,560
but if you look in the google doc there
 

5523
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:15,830
but if you look in the google doc there
are a lot of other studies that point

5524
01:30:15,830 --> 01:30:15,840
are a lot of other studies that point
 

5525
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,430
are a lot of other studies that point
the other way and especially about

if it's a better world yeah so you have
 

5571
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:04,070
if it's a better world yeah so you have
to look at each the dynamics of each

5572
01:31:04,070 --> 01:31:04,080
to look at each the dynamics of each
 

5573
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:05,830
to look at each the dynamics of each
change that needs to be made and you

5574
01:31:05,830 --> 01:31:05,840
change that needs to be made and you
 

5575
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:07,990
change that needs to be made and you
have to look at it systemically and so

5576
01:31:07,990 --> 01:31:08,000
have to look at it systemically and so
 

5577
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,350
have to look at it systemically and so
the biggest change for teen mental

5578
01:31:09,350 --> 01:31:09,360
the biggest change for teen mental
 

5579
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:11,910
the biggest change for teen mental
health i think is to raise the age from

13 it was set to 13 in kappa in like

5582
01:31:14,350 --> 01:31:14,360
13 it was set to 13 in kappa in like
 

5583
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:16,550
13 it was set to 13 in kappa in like
1997 or six or whatever that eight

5584
01:31:16,550 --> 01:31:16,560
1997 or six or whatever that eight
 

5585
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:17,750
1997 or six or whatever that eight
whatever it was

5586
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:17,760
whatever it was
 

5587
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,430
whatever it was
it was set to 13 with no enforcement i

5588
01:31:19,430 --> 01:31:19,440
it was set to 13 with no enforcement i
 

5589
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:21,590
it was set to 13 with no enforcement i
think it needs to go to 16 or 18 with

5590
01:31:21,590 --> 01:31:21,600
think it needs to go to 16 or 18 with
 

5591
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:24,229
think it needs to go to 16 or 18 with
enforcement now there's no way that

5592
01:31:24,229 --> 01:31:24,239
enforcement now there's no way that
 

5593
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:25,990
enforcement now there's no way that
facebook can say

5594
01:31:25,990 --> 01:31:26,000
facebook can say
 

5595
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:26,870
facebook can say
um

5596
01:31:26,870 --> 01:31:26,880
um
 

5597
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:28,550
um
actually so look at instagram the age is

5598
01:31:28,550 --> 01:31:28,560
actually so look at instagram the age is
 

5599
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:30,390
actually so look at instagram the age is
13 but they don't enforce it

5600
01:31:30,390 --> 01:31:30,400
13 but they don't enforce it
 

5601
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,149
13 but they don't enforce it
and and they're under pressure to not

5602
01:31:32,149 --> 01:31:32,159
and and they're under pressure to not
 

5603
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:33,750
and and they're under pressure to not
enforce it because if they did enforce

5604
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:33,760
enforce it because if they did enforce
 

5605
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,590
enforce it because if they did enforce
it then all the kids would just go to

5606
01:31:35,590 --> 01:31:35,600
it then all the kids would just go to
 

5607
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:37,030
it then all the kids would just go to
tick-tock which they're doing anyway but

5608
01:31:37,030 --> 01:31:37,040
tick-tock which they're doing anyway but
 

5609
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:39,270
tick-tock which they're doing anyway but
if we go back a couple years when they

5610
01:31:39,270 --> 01:31:39,280
if we go back a couple years when they
 

5611
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:41,110
if we go back a couple years when they
they were talking about rolling out

5612
01:31:41,110 --> 01:31:41,120
they were talking about rolling out
 

5613
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:42,950
they were talking about rolling out
facebook for kids because they need to

5614
01:31:42,950 --> 01:31:42,960
facebook for kids because they need to
 

5615
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:44,390
facebook for kids because they need to
get those kids they need to get kids

5616
01:31:44,390 --> 01:31:44,400
get those kids they need to get kids
 

5617
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:45,990
get those kids they need to get kids
under 13. there's a business imperative

5618
01:31:45,990 --> 01:31:46,000
under 13. there's a business imperative
 

5619
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,390
under 13. there's a business imperative
to hook them early and keep them

5620
01:31:48,390 --> 01:31:48,400
to hook them early and keep them
 

5621
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:50,470
to hook them early and keep them
so i don't expect facebook to act on its

5622
01:31:50,470 --> 01:31:50,480
so i don't expect facebook to act on its
 

5623
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:51,910
so i don't expect facebook to act on its
own accord and do the right thing

5624
01:31:51,910 --> 01:31:51,920
own accord and do the right thing
 

5625
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:53,430
own accord and do the right thing
because

5626
01:31:53,430 --> 01:31:53,440
because
 

5627
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:55,750
because
exactly when you have a social dilemma

5628
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:55,760
exactly when you have a social dilemma
 

5629
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:57,430
exactly when you have a social dilemma
you know like what economists call like

5630
01:31:57,430 --> 01:31:57,440
you know like what economists call like
 

5631
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:58,950
you know like what economists call like
a prisoner's dilemma or a social dilemma

5632
01:31:58,950 --> 01:31:58,960
a prisoner's dilemma or a social dilemma
 

5633
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,229
a prisoner's dilemma or a social dilemma
is you know generalized to multiple

5634
01:32:00,229 --> 01:32:00,239
is you know generalized to multiple
 

5635
01:32:00,239 --> 01:32:01,750
is you know generalized to multiple
people and when you have a social

5636
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:01,760
people and when you have a social
 

5637
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:03,030
people and when you have a social
dilemma

5638
01:32:03,030 --> 01:32:03,040
dilemma
 

5639
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:04,790
dilemma
each player can't opt out because

5640
01:32:04,790 --> 01:32:04,800
each player can't opt out because
 

5641
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:06,629
each player can't opt out because
they're going to lose you have to have

5642
01:32:06,629 --> 01:32:06,639
they're going to lose you have to have
 

5643
01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:08,229
they're going to lose you have to have
central regulation so i think we have to

5644
01:32:08,229 --> 01:32:08,239
central regulation so i think we have to
 

5645
01:32:08,239 --> 01:32:10,550
central regulation so i think we have to
raise the age um the uk parliament is

5646
01:32:10,550 --> 01:32:10,560
raise the age um the uk parliament is
 

5647
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,070
raise the age um the uk parliament is
way ahead of us i think they're actually

5648
01:32:12,070 --> 01:32:12,080
way ahead of us i think they're actually
 

5649
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:13,590
way ahead of us i think they're actually
functional the us congress is not

5650
01:32:13,590 --> 01:32:13,600
functional the us congress is not
 

5651
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:14,629
functional the us congress is not
functional

5652
01:32:14,629 --> 01:32:14,639
functional
 

5653
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:17,189
functional
so the parliament is implementing the

5654
01:32:17,189 --> 01:32:17,199
so the parliament is implementing the
 

5655
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:19,350
so the parliament is implementing the
age-appropriate design code that may put

5656
01:32:19,350 --> 01:32:19,360
age-appropriate design code that may put
 

5657
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:21,750
age-appropriate design code that may put
pressure on the platforms globally to

5658
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:21,760
pressure on the platforms globally to
 

5659
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:23,910
pressure on the platforms globally to
change certain so anyway my point is

5660
01:32:23,910 --> 01:32:23,920
change certain so anyway my point is
 

5661
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:26,550
change certain so anyway my point is
we have to have regulation to force them

5662
01:32:26,550 --> 01:32:26,560
we have to have regulation to force them
 

5663
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:29,270
we have to have regulation to force them
to be transparent and share what they're

5664
01:32:29,270 --> 01:32:29,280
to be transparent and share what they're
 

5665
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:31,189
to be transparent and share what they're
doing there are some good bills out

5666
01:32:31,189 --> 01:32:31,199
doing there are some good bills out
 

5667
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:33,430
doing there are some good bills out
there so i think that if the companies

5668
01:32:33,430 --> 01:32:33,440
there so i think that if the companies
 

5669
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:35,030
there so i think that if the companies
and the and the users if we're all stuck

5670
01:32:35,030 --> 01:32:35,040
and the and the users if we're all stuck
 

5671
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:37,270
and the and the users if we're all stuck
in a social dilemma um in which the

5672
01:32:37,270 --> 01:32:37,280
in a social dilemma um in which the
 

5673
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:39,030
in a social dilemma um in which the
incentives to the

5674
01:32:39,030 --> 01:32:39,040
incentives to the
 

5675
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,790
incentives to the
incentives against doing the right thing

5676
01:32:40,790 --> 01:32:40,800
incentives against doing the right thing
 

5677
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:41,910
incentives against doing the right thing
are strong

5678
01:32:41,910 --> 01:32:41,920
are strong
 

5679
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:43,830
are strong
we do need we do need regulation on

5680
01:32:43,830 --> 01:32:43,840
we do need we do need regulation on
 

5681
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,750
we do need we do need regulation on
certain matters and again it's not about

5682
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:45,760
certain matters and again it's not about
 

5683

the the um
uh the state of california is actually

5735
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:40,870
uk's um the age-appropriate design code
which would force the companies to do

5736
01:33:40,870 --> 01:33:40,880
which would force the companies to do
 

5737
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:43,590
which would force the companies to do
some simple things like not be sending

5738
01:33:43,590 --> 01:33:43,600
some simple things like not be sending

5741
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:47,510
alerts and notifications to children at
10 or 11 o'clock at night just things

5742
01:33:47,510 --> 01:33:47,520
10 or 11 o'clock at night just things
 

5743
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:49,510
10 or 11 o'clock at night just things
like that to make

5744
01:33:49,510 --> 01:33:49,520
like that to make
 

5745
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:52,310
like that to make
make platforms just less damaging

5746
01:33:52,310 --> 01:33:52,320
make platforms just less damaging
 

5747
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:54,229
make platforms just less damaging
so i think there's an essential role for

5748
01:33:54,229 --> 01:33:54,239
so i think there's an essential role for
 

5749
01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:55,750
so i think there's an essential role for
regulation and i think if the us

5750
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:55,760
regulation and i think if the us
 

5751
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:58,229
regulation and i think if the us
congress is too paralyzed by politics if

5752
01:33:58,229 --> 01:33:58,239
congress is too paralyzed by politics if
 

5753
01:33:58,239 --> 01:34:00,709
congress is too paralyzed by politics if
the uk and the eu and the state of

5754
01:34:00,709 --> 01:34:00,719
the uk and the eu and the state of
 

5755
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:02,229
the uk and the eu and the state of
california and the state a few other

5756
01:34:02,229 --> 01:34:02,239
california and the state a few other
 

5757
01:34:02,239 --> 01:34:05,030
california and the state a few other
states if they enact legislation the

5758
01:34:05,030 --> 01:34:05,040
states if they enact legislation the
 

5759
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:06,470
states if they enact legislation the
platforms don't want to have different

5760
01:34:06,470 --> 01:34:06,480
platforms don't want to have different
 

5761
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:07,750
platforms don't want to have different
versions in different states or

5762
01:34:07,750 --> 01:34:07,760
versions in different states or
 

5763
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:09,510
versions in different states or
countries so i think there actually is

5764
01:34:09,510 --> 01:34:09,520
countries so i think there actually is
 

5765
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:11,669
countries so i think there actually is
some hope even if the us congress is

5766
01:34:11,669 --> 01:34:11,679
some hope even if the us congress is
 

5767
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:14,070
some hope even if the us congress is
dysfunctional so there is because i've

5768
01:34:14,070 --> 01:34:14,080
dysfunctional so there is because i've
 

5769
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:15,430
dysfunctional so there is because i've
been interacting with certain

avoiding world war three it seems like
 

5841
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:37,990
avoiding world war three it seems like
