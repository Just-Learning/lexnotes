that's one of the possible outcomes but

556
00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:44,959
that's one of the possible outcomes but
 

557
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,790
that's one of the possible outcomes but
what what what in general is the idea of

what what what in general is the idea of
 

559
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,509
what what what in general is the idea of
the paper so it's looking at multiple

the paper so it's looking at multiple
 

561
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:50,990
the paper so it's looking at multiple

politically and such so even if we

590
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:24,120
politically and such so even if we
 

591
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,710
politically and such so even if we
somehow managed all the other aspects of

00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:29,199
it programming those fuzzy Concepts and
 

595
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:31,310
it programming those fuzzy Concepts and
getting to follow them closely we don't

596
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:31,320
getting to follow them closely we don't
 

597
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,949
getting to follow them closely we don't
agree on what to program in so my

598
00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:33,959
agree on what to program in so my
 

599
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:35,870
agree on what to program in so my
solution was okay we don't have to

600
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:35,880
solution was okay we don't have to
 

601
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,509
solution was okay we don't have to
compromise on room temperature you have

602
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:37,519
compromise on room temperature you have
 

603
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,750
compromise on room temperature you have
your Universe I have mine whatever you

604
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:39,760
your Universe I have mine whatever you
 

605
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,269
your Universe I have mine whatever you
want and if you like me you can invite

606
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:42,279
want and if you like me you can invite
 

607
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:43,990
want and if you like me you can invite
me to visit your Universe we don't have

608
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,000
me to visit your Universe we don't have
 

609
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,509
me to visit your Universe we don't have
to be independent but the point is you

610
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:46,519
to be independent but the point is you
 

611
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:48,470
to be independent but the point is you
can be and virtual reality is getting

612
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:48,480
can be and virtual reality is getting
 

613
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,030
can be and virtual reality is getting
pretty good it's going to hit a point

614
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:50,040
pretty good it's going to hit a point
 

615
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,990
pretty good it's going to hit a point
where you can't tell the difference and

616
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,000
where you can't tell the difference and
 

617
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,189
where you can't tell the difference and
if you can't tell if it's real or not

618
00:12:54,189 --> 00:12:54,199
if you can't tell if it's real or not
 

619
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:56,430
if you can't tell if it's real or not
what's the difference so basically give

620
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:56,440
what's the difference so basically give
 

621
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,509
what's the difference so basically give
up on value alignment create and entire

622
00:12:59,509 --> 00:12:59,519
up on value alignment create and entire
 

623
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,310
up on value alignment create and entire
it's like the the Multiverse Theory this

624
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:01,320
it's like the the Multiverse Theory this
 

625
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,189
it's like the the Multiverse Theory this
just create an entire universe for you

626
00:13:03,189 --> 00:13:03,199
just create an entire universe for you
 

627
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,470
just create an entire universe for you
where your values you still have to

628
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:05,480
where your values you still have to
 

629
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,509
where your values you still have to
align with that individual they have to

630
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:07,519
align with that individual they have to
 

631
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,949
align with that individual they have to
be happy in that simulation but it's a

632
00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:09,959
be happy in that simulation but it's a
 

633
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:11,910
be happy in that simulation but it's a
much easier problem to align with one

634
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:11,920
much easier problem to align with one
 

635
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,110
much easier problem to align with one
agent versus 8 billion agents plus

636
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:14,120
agent versus 8 billion agents plus
 

637
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,670
agent versus 8 billion agents plus
animals aliens so you convert the

638
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:16,680
animals aliens so you convert the
 

639
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,949
animals aliens so you convert the
multi-agent problem into a single agent

640
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:18,959
multi-agent problem into a single agent
 

641
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,189
multi-agent problem into a single agent
problem I'm trying to do that yeah okay

642
00:13:22,189 --> 00:13:22,199
problem I'm trying to do that yeah okay
 

643
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:26,189
problem I'm trying to do that yeah okay
is there any way to is so okay that's

00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:26,199
is there any way to is so okay that's
 

645
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:29,910
is there any way to is so okay that's
giving up on the on the value problem

646
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:29,920
giving up on the on the value problem
 

647
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,030
giving up on the on the value problem
well is there any way to solve the value

648
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,040
well is there any way to solve the value
 

649
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,470
well is there any way to solve the value

trying to converge towards that so we're

the examples you gave uh some of them

700
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:34,639
the examples you gave uh some of them
 

701
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,350
the examples you gave uh some of them
are for example two different religions

702
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:36,360
are for example two different religions
 

703
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,389
are for example two different religions

virtual world you solve the problem but

710
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:46,360
virtual world you solve the problem but
 

711
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,550
virtual world you solve the problem but
if you only have one it's not divisible

712
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:48,560
if you only have one it's not divisible
 

713
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,629
if you only have one it's not divisible
you kind of stuck there but what if we

714
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:50,639
you kind of stuck there but what if we
 

715
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,269
you kind of stuck there but what if we
want to be a tension with each other and

716
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:53,279
want to be a tension with each other and
 

717
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,389
want to be a tension with each other and
that through that tension we understand

718
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:56,399
that through that tension we understand
 

719
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,509
that through that tension we understand
ourselves and we understand the world so

720
00:14:58,509 --> 00:14:58,519
ourselves and we understand the world so
 

721
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:00,110
ourselves and we understand the world so
that that's the intellectual Journey

722
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:00,120
that that's the intellectual Journey
 

723
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,389
that that's the intellectual Journey
we're on we're on as a human

and physical conflict and through that
 

729
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,030

figure stuff out if we go back to that

00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:14,199
entertainment kind of giving meaning to

736
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:16,680
us the question is how much suffering is

reasonable for a video game so yeah I

738
00:15:19,069 --> 00:15:19,079
reasonable for a video game so yeah I
 

739
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:21,110
reasonable for a video game so yeah I
don't mind you know a video game where I

740
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,120
don't mind you know a video game where I
 

741
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,230
don't mind you know a video game where I
get heptic feedback there is a little

742
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:23,240
get heptic feedback there is a little
 

743
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,470
get heptic feedback there is a little
bit of shaking maybe I'm a little scared

744
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:25,480
bit of shaking maybe I'm a little scared
 

745
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,150
bit of shaking maybe I'm a little scared
I don't want a game where like kids are

746
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:28,160
I don't want a game where like kids are
 

747
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,470
I don't want a game where like kids are
tortured

748
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:29,480
tortured
 

749
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,629
tortured
literally that seems unethical at least

750
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:32,639
literally that seems unethical at least
 

751
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,030
literally that seems unethical at least
by our human standards are you

752
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,040
by our human standards are you
 

753
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,430
by our human standards are you
suggesting it's possible to remove

754
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:36,440
suggesting it's possible to remove
 

755

civilization as an optimization problem
 

759
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,189
civilization as an optimization problem
so we know there are some humans who

760
00:15:44,189 --> 00:15:44,199
so we know there are some humans who
 

761
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:45,949
so we know there are some humans who
because of a mutation don't experience

762
00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:45,959
because of a mutation don't experience
 

763
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:48,670
because of a mutation don't experience
physical pain so at least physical pain

764
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:48,680
physical pain so at least physical pain
 

765
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,710
physical pain so at least physical pain
can

766
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:49,720
can
 

767
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,389
can
be mutated out re-engineered out

768
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:53,399
be mutated out re-engineered out

770
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:55,639
suffering in terms of meaning like you
 

771
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:57,949

burn the only copy of my book is a

772
00:15:57,949 --> 00:15:57,959
burn the only copy of my book is a
 

773
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:00,269
burn the only copy of my book is a
little harder but even there you can

774
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:00,279
little harder but even there you can
 

775
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:03,110
little harder but even there you can
manipulate your honic set point you can

776
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,120
manipulate your honic set point you can
 

777
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,269
manipulate your honic set point you can
change defaults you can reset problem

778
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:06,279
change defaults you can reset problem
 

779
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:07,949
change defaults you can reset problem
with that is if you start messing with

780
00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:07,959
with that is if you start messing with
 

781
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:10,189
with that is if you start messing with
your reward Channel you start

782
00:16:10,189 --> 00:16:10,199
your reward Channel you start
 

783
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:14,389
your reward Channel you start
wireheading and uh end up bissing out uh

784
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:14,399
wireheading and uh end up bissing out uh
 

785
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,829
wireheading and uh end up bissing out uh
a little too much well that's the the

786
00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:16,839
a little too much well that's the the
 

787
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:19,470
a little too much well that's the the
question would you really want to live

788
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:19,480
question would you really want to live
 

789
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,350
question would you really want to live
in a world where there's no suffering

790
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:21,360
in a world where there's no suffering
 

791
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,949
in a world where there's no suffering
that's a dark question is there some

792
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:23,959
that's a dark question is there some
 

793
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:25,230
that's a dark question is there some
level of

794
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:25,240
level of
 

795
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,309
level of
suffering that reminds us of what this

796
00:16:28,309 --> 00:16:28,319
suffering that reminds us of what this
 

797
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:29,670
suffering that reminds us of what this
is all for

798
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:29,680
is all for
 

799
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,790
is all for
I I think we need that but I would

800
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:31,800
I I think we need that but I would
 

801
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,230
I I think we need that but I would
change the overall range so right now

humans again I would like to assume that

914
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:58,840
humans again I would like to assume that
 

915
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,470
humans again I would like to assume that
normal people never think like that it's

normal people never think like that it's
 

917
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,190
normal people never think like that it's
always some sort of psychopaths but yeah

918
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:04,200
always some sort of psychopaths but yeah
 

919
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,750
always some sort of psychopaths but yeah
and to you AGI systems can carry that

920
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:07,760
and to you AGI systems can carry that
 

921
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,909
and to you AGI systems can carry that
and uh be more competent at executing

922
00:19:10,909 --> 00:19:10,919
and uh be more competent at executing
 

923
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:13,510
and uh be more competent at executing
that they can certainly be more creative

924
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:13,520
that they can certainly be more creative
 

925
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,190
that they can certainly be more creative
they can understand human biology better

926
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:16,200
they can understand human biology better
 

927
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,710

that limit can be removed as well so if

934
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:28,799
that limit can be removed as well so if
 

935
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,630
that limit can be removed as well so if
we're actually looking at x risk and

we're actually looking at x risk and
 

937
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,950
we're actually looking at x risk and
srisk as the systems get more and more

they become more intelligent so like

1150
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:55,400
they become more intelligent so like
 

1151
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,909
they become more intelligent so like
there there's a gray area there what it

1152
00:23:56,909 --> 00:23:56,919
there there's a gray area there what it
 

1153
00:23:56,919 --> 00:23:59,190
there there's a gray area there what it
means to be human when we're measuring

their intelligence so when I think about

1156
00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:00,679
their intelligence so when I think about
 

1157
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:02,470
their intelligence so when I think about
it I usually think human with like a

1158
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:02,480
it I usually think human with like a
 

1159
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,190
it I usually think human with like a
paper and a pencil not human with

1160
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:04,200
paper and a pencil not human with
 

1161

internet and anava AI helping but is

1162
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:07,440
internet and anava AI helping but is
 

1163
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,750
internet and anava AI helping but is
that a fair way to think about it cuz

1164
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:09,760
that a fair way to think about it cuz
 

1165
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,190
that a fair way to think about it cuz
isn't there another definition of human

1166
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:11,200
isn't there another definition of human
 

1167
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,710
isn't there another definition of human
level intelligence that includes the

1168
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:12,720
level intelligence that includes the
 

1169
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,870
level intelligence that includes the
tools that humans create but we create

1170
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:14,880
tools that humans create but we create
 

1171
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,190

AI so at any point you'll still just add

1172
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:17,200
AI so at any point you'll still just add
 

1173
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,350
AI so at any point you'll still just add
super intelligence to human capability

1174
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:19,360
super intelligence to human capability
 

1175
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,870
super intelligence to human capability
that seems like

1176
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:20,880
that seems like
 

1177
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,070
that seems like
cheating no controllable tools there is

1178
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:24,080
cheating no controllable tools there is
 

1179
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,029
cheating no controllable tools there is
there is an implied leap that you're

1180
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:27,039
there is an implied leap that you're
 

1181
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:31,870
there is an implied leap that you're
making when AGI goes from tool to uh

1182
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:31,880
making when AGI goes from tool to uh
 

1183
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,549
making when AGI goes from tool to uh

1185
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,950
entity that can make its own decisions
so if we Define human level intelligence

1186
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:36,960
so if we Define human level intelligence
 

1187
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,029
so if we Define human level intelligence
as everything a human can do with fully

1188
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:39,039
as everything a human can do with fully
 

1189
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,590
as everything a human can do with fully
controllable tools it seems like a

1190
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:41,600
controllable tools it seems like a
 

1191
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,590
controllable tools it seems like a
hybrid of some kind you're now doing

1192
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:43,600
hybrid of some kind you're now doing

brain computer interfaces you connecting
 

1195
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,710

it to maybe narrow AI yeah it definitely

1196
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:48,720
it to maybe narrow AI yeah it definitely
 

1197
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,590
it to maybe narrow AI yeah it definitely
increases our

1198
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:50,600
increases our
 

1199
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,389
increases our
capabilities so what's a good test to

1200
00:24:55,389 --> 00:24:55,399
capabilities so what's a good test to
 

1201
00:24:55,399 --> 00:24:58,789
capabilities so what's a good test to
you that uh measures whether uh an

1202
00:24:58,789 --> 00:24:58,799
you that uh measures whether uh an
 

1203
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,110
you that uh measures whether uh an

artificial intelligence system has
 

1205
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,510
artificial intelligence system has
reached human level intelligence and was

1206
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:02,520
reached human level intelligence and was
 

1207
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,669
reached human level intelligence and was
a good test where it has superseded

1208
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:05,679
a good test where it has superseded
 

1209
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,070
a good test where it has superseded
human level intelligence to reach that

1210
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:08,080
human level intelligence to reach that
 

1211
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,110

anything and so the system has to be as
 

1227

1335
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,590
learns more it may start doing those
things so do you think it's possible to

1336
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:54,600
things so do you think it's possible to
 

1337
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,549
things so do you think it's possible to
develop a system where the creators of

1338
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:56,559
develop a system where the creators of
 

1339
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,430
develop a system where the creators of
the system the developers the program

1340
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:58,440
the system the developers the program
 

1341
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,230
the system the developers the program
rers don't know that it's deceiving them

rers don't know that it's deceiving them
 

1343
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,230
rers don't know that it's deceiving them
so systems today don't have long-term

1344
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:05,240
so systems today don't have long-term
 

1345
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,070
so systems today don't have long-term
planning that is not out they can lie

that it's just benevolence from
 

1381
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,269
that it's just benevolence from
intelligence so they'll always want

what's best for us some people think

1384
00:28:56,269 --> 00:28:56,279
what's best for us some people think
 

1385
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:59,549
what's best for us some people think
that uh they will be able to detect

1386
00:28:59,549 --> 00:28:59,559
that uh they will be able to detect
 

1387
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:01,870
that uh they will be able to detect
problem behaviors and correct them at

the time when we get
there I don't think it's a good idea I

1392
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:06,440
there I don't think it's a good idea I
 

1393
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,350
there I don't think it's a good idea I
am strongly against it but yeah there

1394
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:08,360
am strongly against it but yeah there
 

1395
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,149
am strongly against it but yeah there
are quite a few people who in general

1396
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:11,159
are quite a few people who in general
 

1397
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:13,590
are quite a few people who in general
are so optimistic about this technology

1398
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:13,600
are so optimistic about this technology
 

1399
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,909
are so optimistic about this technology
it could do no wrong they want it

1400
00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:15,919
it could do no wrong they want it

00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,389
it could do no wrong they want it
developed as soon as possible as capable

1402
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:18,399
developed as soon as possible as capable
 

1403
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:21,950
developed as soon as possible as capable
as possible so there's going to be

1404
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:21,960
as possible so there's going to be
 

1405
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,190
as possible so there's going to be
people who believe the more intelligent

1406
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:24,200
people who believe the more intelligent
 

1407
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,750
people who believe the more intelligent
it is the more benevolent and so

1408
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:25,760
it is the more benevolent and so
 

1409
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,990
it is the more benevolent and so
therefore it should be the one that

1410
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:27,000
therefore it should be the one that
 

1411
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,990
therefore it should be the one that
defines the objective function that it's

1412
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:29,000
defines the objective function that it's
 

1413
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,830
defines the objective function that it's

right we removed the gender bias we're

1420
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:37,960
right we removed the gender bias we're
 

1421
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,509
right we removed the gender bias we're
removing race bias why is this pro-human

1422
00:29:40,509 --> 00:29:40,519
removing race bias why is this pro-human
 

1423
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:43,310

1433
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,590
Society comes and replaces us it's
normal stage in the evolution of our

1434
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:55,600
normal stage in the evolution of our
 

1435
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,269
normal stage in the evolution of our
species yeah so somebody says uh let's

1436
00:29:59,269 --> 00:29:59,279
species yeah so somebody says uh let's
 

1437
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,630
species yeah so somebody says uh let's
develop an AI system that removes the

1438
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:01,640
develop an AI system that removes the
 

1439
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,990
develop an AI system that removes the
violent humans from the world and then

1440
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:05,000
violent humans from the world and then
 

1441
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,509
violent humans from the world and then
it turns out that all humans have

1442
00:30:06,509 --> 00:30:06,519
it turns out that all humans have
 

1443
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:08,389
it turns out that all humans have
violence in them or the capacity for

1444
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:08,399
violence in them or the capacity for
 

1445
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,070
violence in them or the capacity for
violence and therefore all humans are

1446
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:10,080
violence and therefore all humans are
 

1447
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:15,990
violence and therefore all humans are
removed yeah yeah yeah let me ask about

1448
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:16,000
removed yeah yeah yeah let me ask about
 

1449
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,950
removed yeah yeah yeah let me ask about
uh Yan laon he's somebody who uh you've

1450
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:19,960
uh Yan laon he's somebody who uh you've
 

1451
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,310
uh Yan laon he's somebody who uh you've
had a few exchanges

1452
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:22,320
had a few exchanges
 

1453
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,830
had a few exchanges
with and he's somebody who actively

1454
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:24,840
with and he's somebody who actively
 

1455
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,149
with and he's somebody who actively
pushes back against this view that AI is

1456
00:30:27,149 --> 00:30:27,159
pushes back against this view that AI is
 

1457
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:30,190
pushes back against this view that AI is
going to lead to destruction of uh human

1458
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:30,200
going to lead to destruction of uh human
 

1459
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:44,990
going to lead to destruction of uh human
civilization also known as uh Ai

1460
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:45,000

 

1461
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,149

dorismar and open source are the best

1462
00:30:47,149 --> 00:30:47,159
dorismar and open source are the best
 

1463
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:48,789
dorismar and open source are the best
ways to understand and mitigate the

1464
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:48,799
ways to understand and mitigate the
 

1465
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,789
ways to understand and mitigate the
risks and two AI is not something that

1466
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:51,799
risks and two AI is not something that
 

1467
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:56,310
risks and two AI is not something that
just happens we build it we have agency

1468
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:56,320
just happens we build it we have agency
 

1469
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,710
just happens we build it we have agency
in what it becomes hence we control the

1470
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:58,720
in what it becomes hence we control the
 

1471
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,269
in what it becomes hence we control the
risks we meaning humans it's not some

1472
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:01,279
risks we meaning humans it's not some
 

1473
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,669
risks we meaning humans it's not some
sort of natural phenomena that uh we

1474
00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:03,679
sort of natural phenomena that uh we
 

1475
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,590
sort of natural phenomena that uh we
have no control over so can you can you

1476
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:06,600
have no control over so can you can you
 

1477
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,310
have no control over so can you can you
make the case that he's right and can

1478
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:08,320
make the case that he's right and can
 

1479
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,350
make the case that he's right and can
you try to make the case that he's wrong

1480
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:10,360
you try to make the case that he's wrong
 

1481
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,269
you try to make the case that he's wrong
I cannot make a case that he's right

1482
00:31:12,269 --> 00:31:12,279
I cannot make a case that he's right
 

1483
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:14,389
I cannot make a case that he's right
he's wrong in so many ways it's

1484
00:31:14,389 --> 00:31:14,399
he's wrong in so many ways it's
 

1485
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,710
he's wrong in so many ways it's
difficult for me to remember all of them

1486
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:16,720
difficult for me to remember all of them

1493
00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:25,509

remember the arguments so one he he says

1494
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:25,519
remember the arguments so one he he says
 

1495
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,909

1529
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,149

that's that's not the case so just to

1530
00:32:10,149 --> 00:32:10,159
that's that's not the case so just to
 

1531
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,269
that's that's not the case so just to
linger on that to you the difference

1532
00:32:12,269 --> 00:32:12,279
linger on that to you the difference
 

1533
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:13,990
linger on that to you the difference
there that there is some level of

1534
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:14,000
there that there is some level of
 

1535
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,870
there that there is some level of
emergent intelligence that happens in

00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:17,440
our current
 

1539
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,230
our current
approaches so stuff that we don't

1540
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:20,240
approaches so stuff that we don't
 

1541
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,470
approaches so stuff that we don't
hardcode in absolutely that's what makes

1542
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:23,480
hardcode in absolutely that's what makes
 

1543
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,870
hardcode in absolutely that's what makes
it so successful then we had to

1544
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:25,880
it so successful then we had to
 

1545
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,470
it so successful then we had to
painstakingly hardcode in everything

1546
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:28,480
painstakingly hardcode in everything
 

1547
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,149
painstakingly hardcode in everything
we didn't have much progress now just

1548
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:31,159
we didn't have much progress now just
 

1549
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:33,430
we didn't have much progress now just
spend more money and more compute and

1550
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:33,440
spend more money and more compute and
 

1551
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,669
spend more money and more compute and
it's a lot more capable and then the

1552
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:35,679
it's a lot more capable and then the
 

1553
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,669
it's a lot more capable and then the
question is when there is emergent

1554
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:37,679
question is when there is emergent
 

1555
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:38,710
question is when there is emergent

1559
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,509
phenomena what is the ceiling of that
for you there's no ceiling for uh for

for you there's no ceiling for uh for
Yan laon I think there's a kind of

00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:45,960
Yan laon I think there's a kind of
 

1563
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,070
Yan laon I think there's a kind of
ceiling that happens that we have full

ceiling that happens that we have full

00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:52,710
control over even if we don't understand
the internals of the emergence how the

00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:52,720
the internals of the emergence how the
 

1569
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,870
the internals of the emergence how the
emergence happens there's a sense that

1570
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:55,880
emergence happens there's a sense that
 

1571
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,430
emergence happens there's a sense that
we have control and understanding of the

we have control and understanding of the

00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,310
we have control and understanding of the
approximate ceiling of capability the

approximate ceiling of capability the
 

1575
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,710
approximate ceiling of capability the
limits of the capability let's say there

1576
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:04,720
limits of the capability let's say there
 

1577
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,669
limits of the capability let's say there
is a ceiling it's not guaranteed to be

1578
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:07,679
is a ceiling it's not guaranteed to be
 

1579
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,710
is a ceiling it's not guaranteed to be
at a level which is competitive with us

1580
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:10,720
at a level which is competitive with us
 

1581
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,070
at a level which is competitive with us
it may be greatly Superior to ours so

1582
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:14,080
it may be greatly Superior to ours so
 

1583
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,389
it may be greatly Superior to ours so
what

1584
00:33:15,389 --> 00:33:15,399
what
 

1585
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:18,070
what
about his statement about open research

1586
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:18,080
about his statement about open research
 

1587
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,070
about his statement about open research

1617
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,750
weapons current AI systems are not akin
to nuclear weapons so the idea there is

you're open sourcing it at this stage

1620
00:33:59,669 --> 00:33:59,679
you're open sourcing it at this stage
 

1621
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,190
you're open sourcing it at this stage
that you can understand it better large

1622
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:01,200
that you can understand it better large
 

1623
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,430

00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:03,440
large number of people can explore the
 

1625
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,190
large number of people can explore the
limitation the capabilities explore the

00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:05,200
limitation the capabilities explore the
 

1627
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,430
limitation the capabilities explore the
possible ways to keep it safe to keep uh

1628
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:08,440
possible ways to keep it safe to keep uh
 

1629
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,389
possible ways to keep it safe to keep uh
it secure all that kind of stuff while

1630
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:10,399
it secure all that kind of stuff while
 

1631
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,430
it secure all that kind of stuff while
it's not at the stage of nuclear weapons

1632
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:12,440
it's not at the stage of nuclear weapons
 

1633
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,710
it's not at the stage of nuclear weapons
so nuclear weapons there's a no nuclear

1634
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:14,720
so nuclear weapons there's a no nuclear
 

1635
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,230
so nuclear weapons there's a no nuclear
weapon and then there's a nuclear weapon

1636
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:17,240
weapon and then there's a nuclear weapon
 

1637
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,950
weapon and then there's a nuclear weapon
with AI systems there's a gradual

1638
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:18,960
with AI systems there's a gradual
 

1639
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,550
with AI systems there's a gradual
Improvement of capability and you get

1640
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:21,560
Improvement of capability and you get
 

1641
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,230
Improvement of capability and you get
to uh perform that Improvement

1642
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:24,240
to uh perform that Improvement
 

1643
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,310
to uh perform that Improvement
incrementally and so open source allows

1644
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:26,320
incrementally and so open source allows
 

1645
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,149
incrementally and so open source allows
you to study

1646
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:28,159
you to study
 

1647
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,589
you to study
uh how things go wrong I study the the

1648
00:34:30,589 --> 00:34:30,599
uh how things go wrong I study the the
 

1649
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:33,909
uh how things go wrong I study the the
very process of emergence study AI

1650
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:33,919

a high level of danger all that kind of

1654
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:37,960
a high level of danger all that kind of
 

1655
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,230
a high level of danger all that kind of
stuff it also sets a very wrong

1656
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:40,240
stuff it also sets a very wrong
 

1657
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,950
stuff it also sets a very wrong
precedence so we open sourced model one

1658
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:42,960

1659
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,149

model two model three nothing ever bad
 

1661
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,589
model two model three nothing ever bad
happened so obviously we're going to do

1663
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:49,030

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,230
capability that can legitimately lead to
a lot of damage then everybody wakes up

1690
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:20,240
a lot of damage then everybody wakes up
 

1691
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,430
a lot of damage then everybody wakes up
and says okay we need to regulate this

1692
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:22,440
and says okay we need to regulate this
 

1693
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,870
and says okay we need to regulate this
we need to come up with safety mechanism

1694
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:23,880
we need to come up with safety mechanism
 

1695
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,230
we need to come up with safety mechanism
that stops this right but at this time

any illustration of significant damage
 

1701
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,990
any illustration of significant damage
done by intelligent AI systems so I have

1702
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:35,000
done by intelligent AI systems so I have
 

1703
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,910
done by intelligent AI systems so I have
a paper which collects accidents through

00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:37,920
a paper which collects accidents through
 

1705
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,630
a paper which collects accidents through
history of AI and they always are

1706
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:39,640
history of AI and they always are
 

1707
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,349
history of AI and they always are
proportionate to capabilities of that

1708
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:41,359
proportionate to capabilities of that
 

1709
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,950
proportionate to capabilities of that
system so if you have Tic Tac to playing

1710
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:43,960
system so if you have Tic Tac to playing
 

1711
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,790
system so if you have Tic Tac to playing
AI it will fail to properly play and

1712
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:46,800
AI it will fail to properly play and
 

1713
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,910
AI it will fail to properly play and
lose the game which it should draw

1714
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:48,920
lose the game which it should draw
 

1715
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,030
lose the game which it should draw
trivial your spell checker will be

spellward so on uh I stopped collecting

1718
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:54,240
spellward so on uh I stopped collecting
 

1719
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,829
spellward so on uh I stopped collecting
those because there are just too many

1720
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:55,839
those because there are just too many
 

1721
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,990
those because there are just too many
examples of AI failing at what they are

1727
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,109

got killed absolutely true but in
 

1729
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:08,309
got killed absolutely true but in
another paper I argue that those

1730
00:36:08,309 --> 00:36:08,319
another paper I argue that those
 

1731
00:36:08,319 --> 00:36:12,109
another paper I argue that those
accidents do not actually prevent people

1732
00:36:12,109 --> 00:36:12,119
accidents do not actually prevent people
 

1733
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:14,950

00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:28,430
same here people will point out you know
that accident AI accident we had where

1746
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:28,440
that accident AI accident we had where
 

1747
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,710
that accident AI accident we had where
12 people died everyone's still here 12

1748
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:31,720
12 people died everyone's still here 12
 

1749
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,069
12 people died everyone's still here 12
people is less than smoking kills it's

1750
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:34,079
people is less than smoking kills it's
 

1751
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,750
people is less than smoking kills it's
not a big deal so we continue so in a

1752
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:36,760
not a big deal so we continue so in a
 

1753
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,710
not a big deal so we continue so in a
way it will actually be kind of

1754
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:39,720
way it will actually be kind of
 

1755
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,550
way it will actually be kind of
confirming that it's not that bad it

1756
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:43,560
confirming that it's not that bad it
 

1757
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,109
confirming that it's not that bad it
matters how the deaths happen whether

1758
00:36:46,109 --> 00:36:46,119
matters how the deaths happen whether
 

1759
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:48,589
matters how the deaths happen whether
it's literally Murder By thei system

1760
00:36:48,589 --> 00:36:48,599
it's literally Murder By thei system
 

1761
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:52,069
it's literally Murder By thei system
then one is a problem but if it's

1762
00:36:52,069 --> 00:36:52,079
then one is a problem but if it's
 

1763
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,710
then one is a problem but if it's
accidents because of increased Reliance

1764
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:55,720
accidents because of increased Reliance
 

1765
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:59,109
accidents because of increased Reliance
on automation for example so when uh

1766
00:36:59,109 --> 00:36:59,119
on automation for example so when uh
 

1767
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,910
on automation for example so when uh
airplanes are flying in an automated way

1768
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:02,920
airplanes are flying in an automated way
 

1769
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,550
airplanes are flying in an automated way
maybe the number of plane crashes

1770
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:05,560
maybe the number of plane crashes
 

1771
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,470
maybe the number of plane crashes
increased by 177% or something and then

1772
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:08,480
increased by 177% or something and then
 

1773
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,190
increased by 177% or something and then
you're like okay do we really want to

1774
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:10,200
you're like okay do we really want to
 

1775
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,309
you're like okay do we really want to
rely on automation I think in a case of

1776
00:37:12,309 --> 00:37:12,319
rely on automation I think in a case of
 

1777
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:14,190
rely on automation I think in a case of
automation airplanes it decrease

1778
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:14,200
automation airplanes it decrease
 

1779
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,910
automation airplanes it decrease
significantly okay same thing with

1780
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:15,920
significantly okay same thing with
 

1781
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,069
significantly okay same thing with
autonomous vehicles like okay uh what

1782
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:19,079
autonomous vehicles like okay uh what
 

1783
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:20,829
autonomous vehicles like okay uh what
are the pros and cons what are the W

1784
00:37:20,829 --> 00:37:20,839
are the pros and cons what are the W

with the trade-offs here you can have

00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:22,720
with the trade-offs here you can have
 

1787
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,510
with the trade-offs here you can have
that discussion in an honest way but I

1788
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:26,520
that discussion in an honest way but I
 

1789
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,710
that discussion in an honest way but I
think the kind of things we're talking

think the kind of things we're talking
 

1791
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,670
think the kind of things we're talking
about here is mass

1792
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:30,680
about here is mass
 

1793
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,030
about here is mass

capability to learn maybe like a child

2056
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:53,400
capability to learn maybe like a child
 

2057
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,750
capability to learn maybe like a child
at the time of testing and deployment it

2058
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:55,760
at the time of testing and deployment it
 

2059
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,150
at the time of testing and deployment it
is still not extremely capable but as it

2060
00:42:59,150 --> 00:42:59,160
is still not extremely capable but as it
 

2061
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,390
is still not extremely capable but as it
is exposed to more data real world it

2062
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:02,400
is exposed to more data real world it
 

2063
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,349
is exposed to more data real world it
can be trained to become much more

2064
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:04,359
can be trained to become much more
 

2065
00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:06,510
can be trained to become much more
dangerous and capable so let's let's

2066
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:06,520
dangerous and capable so let's let's
 

2067
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:10,190
dangerous and capable so let's let's
focus then on the control

2068
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:10,200

 

2069
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,589

problem at which point does the system

2070
00:43:12,589 --> 00:43:12,599
problem at which point does the system
 

2071
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:14,150
problem at which point does the system
become

2072
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:14,160
become
 

2073
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,430
become
uncontrollable why is it the more likely

2074
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:16,440
uncontrollable why is it the more likely
 

2075
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,950

2077
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:18,990

becomes

2078
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:19,000
becomes
 

2079
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,309
becomes
uncontrollable so I think at some point

2080
00:43:21,309 --> 00:43:21,319
uncontrollable so I think at some point
 

2081
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:24,230
uncontrollable so I think at some point
it becomes capable of getting out of

2087
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,750
may decide not to do anything right away
and for a long time just collect more

2099
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,390
in charge of a lot more resources it had
time to make backups so it's not obvious

time to make backups so it's not obvious
 

2101
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,950
time to make backups so it's not obvious
to me that it will strike as soon as it

00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:53,109
can can we just try to imagine this
future with there's an AI system that's

2106
00:43:53,109 --> 00:43:53,119
future with there's an AI system that's

capable of
 

2109
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,430
capable of
uh escaping in control of humans and

2110
00:43:58,430 --> 00:43:58,440
uh escaping in control of humans and
 

2111
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:01,870
uh escaping in control of humans and
then doesn't and waits what's that look

2112
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:01,880
then doesn't and waits what's that look
 

2113
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,470
then doesn't and waits what's that look
like so one we have to rely on that

2114
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:05,480
like so one we have to rely on that
 

2115
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,630
like so one we have to rely on that
system for a lot of the infrastructure

2116
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:07,640
system for a lot of the infrastructure
 

2117
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,750
system for a lot of the infrastructure
so we have to give it access not just to

2118
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:09,760
so we have to give it access not just to
 

2119
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:15,190
so we have to give it access not just to
the internet but to the task of

2120
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:15,200
the internet but to the task of
 

2121
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,230
the internet but to the task of
managing uh Power government economy

2122

managing uh Power government economy
 

2123
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,190
managing uh Power government economy
this kind of stuff so and that just

this kind of stuff so and that just
 

2125
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,030
this kind of stuff so and that just
feels like a gradual process given the

social engineering AI systems don't need
any hardware access they just it's all

2200
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:41,720
any hardware access they just it's all
 

2201
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,630
any hardware access they just it's all
software so they can start manipulating

2202
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:43,640
software so they can start manipulating
 

2203
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,990
software so they can start manipulating
you through social media so on like you

2204
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:46,000
you through social media so on like you
 

2205
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,670
you through social media so on like you
have ai assistants they're going to help

2206
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:47,680
have ai assistants they're going to help
 

2207

have ai assistants they're going to help
you do a lot of manage a lot of your

2208
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:49,520
you do a lot of manage a lot of your
 

2209
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,510
you do a lot of manage a lot of your
day-to-day and then they start doing

2210
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:51,520
day-to-day and then they start doing
 

2211
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,870
day-to-day and then they start doing
social engineering but like for a system

uh the the capabilities that we know
 

2285
00:47:30,839 --> 00:47:33,470
uh the the capabilities that we know
about so like this this idea that the

about so like this this idea that the
 

2287
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,549

00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,390
might well that's a human question
whether humans are capable of that

whether humans are capable of that
 

2489
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,950
whether humans are capable of that
probably some humans are capable of that

2490
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:41,960
probably some humans are capable of that
 

2491
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:44,430
probably some humans are capable of that
my more direct question if it's possible

00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:44,440
my more direct question if it's possible
 

2493
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,710
my more direct question if it's possible
to create such a

to create such a
 

2495
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,109
to create such a
system have a system that has that level

2496
00:51:48,109 --> 00:51:48,119
system have a system that has that level
 

2497
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:49,069
system have a system that has that level
of

of
agency I I don't think that's an easy

2500
00:51:52,549 --> 00:51:52,559
agency I I don't think that's an easy

challenge we're not it doesn't I feel

2504
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:56,760
challenge we're not it doesn't I feel
 

2505
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,829
challenge we're not it doesn't I feel
like we're close to that A system that

2506
00:51:58,829 --> 00:51:58,839
like we're close to that A system that
 

2507
00:51:58,839 --> 00:52:00,510
like we're close to that A system that
has the kind of agency where it can make

00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:00,520
has the kind of agency where it can make
 

2509
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,349
has the kind of agency where it can make
its own decisions and deceive everybody

its own decisions and deceive everybody
 

2511
00:52:02,359 --> 00:52:05,230
its own decisions and deceive everybody
about them the current

00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:05,240
about them the current

2515
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,470

and how we train the systems how deploy

2516
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:10,480
and how we train the systems how deploy
 

2517
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,549

the systems and all that it just doesn't

2518
00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:12,559
the systems and all that it just doesn't
 

2519
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,910
the systems and all that it just doesn't
seem to support that kind of agency I

2520
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:14,920
seem to support that kind of agency I
 

2521
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:17,390

really hope you are right uh I think the

00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,870
really hope you are right uh I think the

we asked how long before AGI now we

00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:25,920
we asked how long before AGI now we
 

2529
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,069
we asked how long before AGI now we
should ask how much until AGI it's

in a few years don't you think it's

a question of decades versus years if

2553
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,390
I'm saying to materialize then I can go
with that

with that
 

2555
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,470
with that
but if it takes decades then uh the

2556
00:52:59,470 --> 00:52:59,480
but if it takes decades then uh the

safety uh becomes more and more

2560
00:53:04,789 --> 00:53:04,799
safety uh becomes more and more
 

2561
00:53:04,799 --> 00:53:07,750
safety uh becomes more and more
realistic so I guess the question

2562
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:07,760
realistic so I guess the question
 

2563
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,069
realistic so I guess the question
is I have a fundamental belief that

is I have a fundamental belief that
 

2565
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:12,190
is I have a fundamental belief that

danger and one of the big problems
facing AI safety currently for me is

facing AI safety currently for me is
 

2575
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:23,510
facing AI safety currently for me is
that there's not clear illustrations of

think one of the challenges here is like
 

2633
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,670
think one of the challenges here is like
where is the

where is the

all humans try to deceive they try to

2856
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:12,880
all humans try to deceive they try to
 

2857
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:16,270
all humans try to deceive they try to
lie early on in their life I think we'll

2858
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:16,280
lie early on in their life I think we'll
 

2859
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:18,470
lie early on in their life I think we'll
just get a lot of examples of deceptions

2860
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:18,480
just get a lot of examples of deceptions
 

2861
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,390
just get a lot of examples of deceptions
from large language models or AI systems

2862
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:21,400
from large language models or AI systems
 

2863
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,430
from large language models or AI systems
they're going to be kind of shitty or

2864
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:23,440
they're going to be kind of shitty or
 

2865
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,870
they're going to be kind of shitty or
they'll be pretty good but we'll catch

2866
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:24,880
they'll be pretty good but we'll catch
 

2867
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,510
they'll be pretty good but we'll catch
them off guard will start to see the

2868
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:27,520
them off guard will start to see the
 

2869
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:31,670
them off guard will start to see the
kind of momentum towards uh

2870
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:31,680
kind of momentum towards uh
 

2871
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:34,710
kind of momentum towards uh
developing increasing deception

2872
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:34,720
developing increasing deception
 

2873
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,950
developing increasing deception
capabilities and that's when you're like

2874
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:36,960
capabilities and that's when you're like
 

2875
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,589
capabilities and that's when you're like
okay we need to do some kind of

2876
00:59:38,589 --> 00:59:38,599
okay we need to do some kind of
 

2877
00:59:38,599 --> 00:59:40,349
okay we need to do some kind of
alignment that prevents deception but

2878
00:59:40,349 --> 00:59:40,359
alignment that prevents deception but
 

2879
00:59:40,359 --> 00:59:43,230
alignment that prevents deception but
then we'll have if you support open

2880
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:43,240
then we'll have if you support open
 

2881
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:44,630
then we'll have if you support open
source then you can have open source

2882
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:44,640
source then you can have open source
 

2883
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,430
source then you can have open source
models that have some level of deception

2884
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:46,440
models that have some level of deception
 

2885
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,069
models that have some level of deception
you can start to explore on a large

2886
00:59:48,069 --> 00:59:48,079
you can start to explore on a large
 

2887
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:50,309
you can start to explore on a large
scale how do we stop it from being

2888
00:59:50,309 --> 00:59:50,319
scale how do we stop it from being
 

2889
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:53,230
scale how do we stop it from being
deceptive then there's a more explicit

2890
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:53,240
deceptive then there's a more explicit
 

2891
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:57,430
deceptive then there's a more explicit
pragmatic kind of uh problem to solve

2892
00:59:57,430 --> 00:59:57,440
pragmatic kind of uh problem to solve
 

2893
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:01,589
pragmatic kind of uh problem to solve
how do we stop AI systems from uh trying

2894
01:00:01,589 --> 01:00:01,599
how do we stop AI systems from uh trying
 

2895
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:03,950
how do we stop AI systems from uh trying
to optimize for deception that's just an

2896
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:03,960
to optimize for deception that's just an
 

2897
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:06,430
to optimize for deception that's just an
example right so there is a paper I

2898
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:06,440
example right so there is a paper I
 

2899
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,950
example right so there is a paper I
think it came out last week by Dr parkol

2900
01:00:08,950 --> 01:00:08,960
think it came out last week by Dr parkol
 

2901
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,870
think it came out last week by Dr parkol
from MIT I think and they showed that

2902
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:11,880
from MIT I think and they showed that
 

2903
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:14,750
from MIT I think and they showed that
existing models already showed

2904
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:14,760
existing models already showed
 

2905
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:18,829
existing models already showed
successful deception in what they do uh

2906
01:00:18,829 --> 01:00:18,839
successful deception in what they do uh
 

2907
01:00:18,839 --> 01:00:21,470
successful deception in what they do uh
my concern is not that they lie now and

2908
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:21,480
my concern is not that they lie now and
 

2909
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:22,829
my concern is not that they lie now and
we need to catch them and tell them

2910
01:00:22,829 --> 01:00:22,839
we need to catch them and tell them
 

2911
01:00:22,839 --> 01:00:25,390
we need to catch them and tell them
don't lie my concern is that once they

2912
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:25,400
don't lie my concern is that once they
 

2913
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:28,990
don't lie my concern is that once they
are capable and deployed they will later

2914
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:29,000
are capable and deployed they will later
 

2915
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:33,109
are capable and deployed they will later
change their mind because that's what

2916
01:00:33,109 --> 01:00:33,119
change their mind because that's what
 

2917
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:35,549
change their mind because that's what
unrestricted learning allows you to do

2918
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:35,559
unrestricted learning allows you to do
 

2919
01:00:35,559 --> 01:00:37,309
unrestricted learning allows you to do
lots of people grow up maybe in the

2920
01:00:37,309 --> 01:00:37,319
lots of people grow up maybe in the
 

2921
01:00:37,319 --> 01:00:39,870
lots of people grow up maybe in the
religious family they read some new

2922
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:39,880
religious family they read some new
 

2923
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:42,470
religious family they read some new
books and they turn in their

2924
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:42,480
books and they turn in their
 

2925
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,829
books and they turn in their
religion that's a treacherous turn in

2926
01:00:44,829 --> 01:00:44,839
religion that's a treacherous turn in
 

2927
01:00:44,839 --> 01:00:48,069
religion that's a treacherous turn in
humans if you learn something new about

2928
01:00:48,069 --> 01:00:48,079
humans if you learn something new about
 

2929
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:51,470
humans if you learn something new about
your colleagues maybe you'll change how

2930
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:51,480
your colleagues maybe you'll change how
 

2931
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:54,630
your colleagues maybe you'll change how
you react to them yeah the treasures

2932
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:54,640
you react to them yeah the treasures
 

2933
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,190
you react to them yeah the treasures
turn

2934
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:56,200
turn
 

2935
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,510
turn
um if we just mention humans Stalin and

2936
01:00:58,510 --> 01:00:58,520
um if we just mention humans Stalin and
 

2937
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:01,190
um if we just mention humans Stalin and
Hitler there's a turn Stalin is a good

2938
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:01,200
Hitler there's a turn Stalin is a good
 

2939
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,750
Hitler there's a turn Stalin is a good
example he just seems like an normal

2940
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:04,760
example he just seems like an normal
 

2941
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:08,150

communist follower Lenin until there's a

2942
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:08,160
communist follower Lenin until there's a
 

2943
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,549
communist follower Lenin until there's a
turn there's a turn of what that means

2944
01:01:10,549 --> 01:01:10,559
turn there's a turn of what that means
 

2945
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:13,390
turn there's a turn of what that means
in terms of uh when he has complete

2946
01:01:13,390 --> 01:01:13,400
in terms of uh when he has complete
 

2947

in terms of uh when he has complete
control what that what the execution of

2948
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:15,280
control what that what the execution of
 

2949
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,630
control what that what the execution of
that policy means and how many people

2950
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:16,640
that policy means and how many people
 

2951
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,670
that policy means and how many people
get to suffer and you can't say they are

2952
01:01:18,670 --> 01:01:18,680
get to suffer and you can't say they are
 

2953
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:21,069
get to suffer and you can't say they are
not rational the rational decision

2954
01:01:21,069 --> 01:01:21,079
not rational the rational decision
 

2955
01:01:21,079 --> 01:01:23,670
not rational the rational decision
changes based on your position then you

2956
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:23,680
changes based on your position then you
 

2957
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:27,190
changes based on your position then you
are under the boss the r policy maybe to

2958
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:27,200
are under the boss the r policy maybe to
 

2959
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,190
are under the boss the r policy maybe to
be following orders and being honest

2960
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:30,200
be following orders and being honest
 

2961
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,549
be following orders and being honest
when you become a boss rational policy

2962
01:01:32,549 --> 01:01:32,559
when you become a boss rational policy
 

2963
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:35,430
when you become a boss rational policy
May shift yeah and and by the way a lot

2964
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:35,440
May shift yeah and and by the way a lot
 

2965
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:38,789
May shift yeah and and by the way a lot
of my disagreements here is just to uh

2966
01:01:38,789 --> 01:01:38,799
of my disagreements here is just to uh
 

2967
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:40,270
of my disagreements here is just to uh
Playing devil's advocate to challenge

2968
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:40,280
Playing devil's advocate to challenge
 

2969
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,750
Playing devil's advocate to challenge
your ideas and to explore them together

2970
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:42,760
your ideas and to explore them together
 

2971
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:46,029
your ideas and to explore them together
so um one of the big problems here in

2972
01:01:46,029 --> 01:01:46,039
so um one of the big problems here in
 

2973
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:47,789
so um one of the big problems here in
this whole conversation

2974
01:01:47,789 --> 01:01:47,799
this whole conversation
 

2975
01:01:47,799 --> 01:01:50,109
this whole conversation
is human civilization hangs in the

2976
01:01:50,109 --> 01:01:50,119
is human civilization hangs in the
 

2977
01:01:50,119 --> 01:01:51,510
is human civilization hangs in the
balance and yet it's everything is

2978
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:51,520
balance and yet it's everything is
 

2979
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,150
balance and yet it's everything is
unpredictable we don't know how these

2980
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:53,160
unpredictable we don't know how these
 

2981
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:58,549
unpredictable we don't know how these
systems will look like

2982
01:01:58,549 --> 01:01:58,559

 

2983
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:00,750

the robots are coming there's a

2984
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:00,760
the robots are coming there's a
 

2985
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:03,029
the robots are coming there's a
refrigerator making a buzzing

2986
01:02:03,029 --> 01:02:03,039
refrigerator making a buzzing
 

2987
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:05,549
refrigerator making a buzzing
noise menacing very

giving a talk uh at Google in uh Israel
and uh three cars which were supposed to

3000
01:02:20,349 --> 01:02:20,359
and uh three cars which were supposed to
 

3001
01:02:20,359 --> 01:02:23,829
and uh three cars which were supposed to
take me to the talk could not I'm just

3002
01:02:23,829 --> 01:02:23,839
take me to the talk could not I'm just
 

3003
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:26,950
take me to the talk could not I'm just
saying I mean

3004
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:26,960
saying I mean
 

3005
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:30,710
saying I mean
it I like a eyes I for one welcome our

3006
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:30,720
it I like a eyes I for one welcome our
 

3007
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,670
it I like a eyes I for one welcome our
overlords there's a degree to which we I

3008
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:33,680
overlords there's a degree to which we I
 

3009
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,630
overlords there's a degree to which we I
mean it is very

3010
01:02:35,630 --> 01:02:35,640
mean it is very
 

3011
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,829
mean it is very
obvious as we already have we've

3012
01:02:37,829 --> 01:02:37,839
obvious as we already have we've
 

3013
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:39,829
obvious as we already have we've
increasingly given our life over to

3014
01:02:39,829 --> 01:02:39,839
increasingly given our life over to
 

3015
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,549

01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:44,920
systems and then it seems obvious given
 

3019
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:47,230
systems and then it seems obvious given
the capabilities of AI that are coming

3020
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:47,240
the capabilities of AI that are coming
 

3021
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:49,109
the capabilities of AI that are coming
that we'll give our lives over

3022
01:02:49,109 --> 01:02:49,119
that we'll give our lives over
 

3023
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:52,109
that we'll give our lives over
increasingly to AI systems cars will

3024
01:02:52,109 --> 01:02:52,119
increasingly to AI systems cars will
 

3025
01:02:52,119 --> 01:02:54,870

is uh
maybe the optimistic notion that it's

maybe the optimistic notion that it's
 

3101
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:29,630
maybe the optimistic notion that it's
possible to engineer systems that defend

verifiers but software systems that look
 

3113
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:47,549
verifiers but software systems that look
at AI systems and like help you

3114
01:04:47,549 --> 01:04:47,559
at AI systems and like help you
 

3115
01:04:47,559 --> 01:04:49,710
at AI systems and like help you
understand this thing is getting real

3116

understand this thing is getting real
 

3117
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:53,150

weird help you help you analyze those

3118
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:53,160
weird help you help you analyze those

about is self-improving more General
 

3463
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,950
about is self-improving more General
than

so if you have fixed code for example

3522
01:13:15,070 --> 01:13:15,080
so if you have fixed code for example
 

3523
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:16,910
so if you have fixed code for example
you can verify that code static

01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:20,110
you can verify that code static
verification at the time but if it will

what are the classes of verifiers that
you write about in the book is there

you have your some favorites so I like
 

3557
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,669
you have your some favorites so I like
Oracle types where you kind of just know

Oracle types where you kind of just know
 

3559
01:13:58,679 --> 01:14:00,750
Oracle types where you kind of just know
that it's right touring lik Oracle

who knows but they pull it out from
 

3565
01:14:05,639 --> 01:14:07,790
who knows but they pull it out from
somewhere so you have to trust them and

that's a concern I have about humans uh

01:14:11,070 --> 01:14:11,080
that's a concern I have about humans uh
 

3569
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:14,430
that's a concern I have about humans uh
in a world with very smart machines we

us but what about like

3628
01:15:23,669 --> 01:15:23,679
us but what about like
 

3629
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:26,070
us but what about like
self-doubt like the kind of verification

3630
01:15:26,070 --> 01:15:26,080
self-doubt like the kind of verification
 

3631
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:28,590

and better what we want the problem of
 

3681
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:31,350
and better what we want the problem of
course is we don't know what we want and

01:16:31,350 --> 01:16:31,360
course is we don't know what we want and
 

3683
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:33,510
course is we don't know what we want and
we don't agree on it yeah but

01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:33,520
we don't agree on it yeah but

01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:43,350
AI systems engineered into AI systems is
one way to solve the control problem it

3692
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:43,360
one way to solve the control problem it
 

3693
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:45,750
one way to solve the control problem it
could also backfire maybe you uncertain

3694
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:45,760
could also backfire maybe you uncertain
 

3695
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:48,270
could also backfire maybe you uncertain
about completing your mission like I am

3696
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:48,280
about completing your mission like I am
 

3697
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:49,830
about completing your mission like I am
paranoid about your camera is not

3698
01:16:49,830 --> 01:16:49,840
paranoid about your camera is not

recording right now so I would feel much

3700
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:52,400
recording right now so I would feel much
 

3701
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,669
recording right now so I would feel much
better if you had a secondary camera but

3702
01:16:54,669 --> 01:16:54,679
better if you had a secondary camera but
 

3703
01:16:54,679 --> 01:16:56,629
better if you had a secondary camera but
I also would feel even better if you had

3704
01:16:56,629 --> 01:16:56,639
I also would feel even better if you had
 

3705
01:16:56,639 --> 01:16:59,270
I also would feel even better if you had
a third and eventually I would turn this

3706
01:16:59,270 --> 01:16:59,280
a third and eventually I would turn this
 

3707
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:02,030
a third and eventually I would turn this
whole world into cameras pointing at us

3708
01:17:02,030 --> 01:17:02,040
whole world into cameras pointing at us
 

3709
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:05,030
whole world into cameras pointing at us
making sure we're capturing this no but

3710
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:05,040
making sure we're capturing this no but
 

3711
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:08,070
making sure we're capturing this no but
wouldn't you have a meta

3712
01:17:08,070 --> 01:17:08,080
wouldn't you have a meta
 

3713
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,590
wouldn't you have a meta
concern like that you just stated that

3714
01:17:10,590 --> 01:17:10,600
concern like that you just stated that
 

3715
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:12,510
concern like that you just stated that
eventually there'll be way too many

3716
01:17:12,510 --> 01:17:12,520
eventually there'll be way too many
 

3717
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:15,950
eventually there'll be way too many
cameras so you would be able to keep

3718
01:17:15,950 --> 01:17:15,960
cameras so you would be able to keep
 

3719
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:17,910
cameras so you would be able to keep
zooming on in the big

3720
01:17:17,910 --> 01:17:17,920
zooming on in the big
 

3721
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:20,590
zooming on in the big

01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:20,600
picture of your
 

3723
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:23,470
picture of your
concerns so it's a multi-objective

3724
01:17:23,470 --> 01:17:23,480
concerns so it's a multi-objective
 

3725
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:25,870
concerns so it's a multi-objective
optimization it depends how much I value

3726
01:17:25,870 --> 01:17:25,880
optimization it depends how much I value
 

3727
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:28,669

capturing this versus not destroying the

3728
01:17:28,669 --> 01:17:28,679
capturing this versus not destroying the
 

3729
01:17:28,679 --> 01:17:30,590
capturing this versus not destroying the
universe right

3730
01:17:30,590 --> 01:17:30,600
universe right
 

3731
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:33,390
universe right
exactly and and then you will also ask

3732
01:17:33,390 --> 01:17:33,400
exactly and and then you will also ask
 

3733
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:34,709
exactly and and then you will also ask
about like what does it mean to destroy

3734
01:17:34,709 --> 01:17:34,719
about like what does it mean to destroy
 

3735
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:36,229
about like what does it mean to destroy
the universe and how many universes are

3736
01:17:36,229 --> 01:17:36,239
the universe and how many universes are
 

3737
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:38,030
the universe and how many universes are
and you keep asking that question but

3738
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:38,040
and you keep asking that question but
 

3739
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:41,030
and you keep asking that question but
that doubting yourself would prevent you

3740
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:41,040
that doubting yourself would prevent you
 

3741
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,629
that doubting yourself would prevent you
from destroying the universe because

3742
01:17:42,629 --> 01:17:42,639
from destroying the universe because
 

3743
01:17:42,639 --> 01:17:44,510
from destroying the universe because
you're constantly full of doubt it might

3744
01:17:44,510 --> 01:17:44,520
you're constantly full of doubt it might
 

3745
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:47,110
you're constantly full of doubt it might
affect your productivity just you might

3746
01:17:47,110 --> 01:17:47,120
affect your productivity just you might
 

3747
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:48,950

01:17:51,229 --> 01:17:51,239
do anything mess things up well that's
 

3751
01:17:51,239 --> 01:17:53,709
do anything mess things up well that's
better I mean I guess the question is it

3752
01:17:53,709 --> 01:17:53,719
better I mean I guess the question is it
 

3753
01:17:53,719 --> 01:17:55,510
better I mean I guess the question is it
possible to engineer that in I guess

know how to do that and we need to
 

3759
01:17:58,159 --> 01:17:59,950
know how to do that and we need to

explainability is a huge one the problem

4110
01:25:48,830 --> 01:25:48,840
explainability is a huge one the problem
 

4111
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:51,189
explainability is a huge one the problem
is that it's very hard to separate

you make good progress in explainability
 

4117
01:25:56,679 --> 01:25:58,870
you make good progress in explainability

entire system which is climate which is
 

4505
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:58,229

4513
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:09,790
system in this case we're building the
system MH and so I how do you keep that

4514
01:34:09,790 --> 01:34:09,800
system MH and so I how do you keep that
 

4515
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:13,109
system MH and so I how do you keep that
system from becoming destructive that's

01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,629
I've heard a lot of experts and
financial experts talk about autonomous

4728
01:38:31,629 --> 01:38:31,639
financial experts talk about autonomous
 

4729
01:38:31,639 --> 01:38:33,550
financial experts talk about autonomous
vehicles and how it's going to be a

4730
01:38:33,550 --> 01:38:33,560
vehicles and how it's going to be a
 

4731
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:35,750
vehicles and how it's going to be a
multi-trillion dollar industry and all

4732
01:38:35,750 --> 01:38:35,760
multi-trillion dollar industry and all
 

4733
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:37,910
multi-trillion dollar industry and all
this kind of stuff and it's

4734
01:38:37,910 --> 01:38:37,920
this kind of stuff and it's
 

4735
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:40,870
this kind of stuff and it's
uh it's a small fund but if you have

4736
01:38:40,870 --> 01:38:40,880
uh it's a small fund but if you have
 

4737
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:42,510
uh it's a small fund but if you have
good Vision maybe you can zoom in on

4738
01:38:42,510 --> 01:38:42,520
good Vision maybe you can zoom in on
 

4739
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:44,550
good Vision maybe you can zoom in on
that and see the prediction dates

4740
01:38:44,550 --> 01:38:44,560
that and see the prediction dates
 

4741
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:46,669
that and see the prediction dates
descrition I have a large one if you're

4742
01:38:46,669 --> 01:38:46,679
descrition I have a large one if you're
 

4743
01:38:46,679 --> 01:38:49,870
descrition I have a large one if you're
interested but I guess my fundamental

4744
01:38:49,870 --> 01:38:49,880
interested but I guess my fundamental
 

4745
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:51,550
interested but I guess my fundamental
question is how often they they write

4746
01:38:51,550 --> 01:38:51,560
question is how often they they write
 

4747
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:54,030
question is how often they they write
about technology

4748
01:38:54,030 --> 01:38:54,040
about technology
 

4749
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:55,470
about technology
I I I

4750
01:38:55,470 --> 01:38:55,480
I I I
 

4751
01:38:55,480 --> 01:38:57,550
I I I
definitely there studies on their

4752
01:38:57,550 --> 01:38:57,560
definitely there studies on their
 

4753
01:38:57,560 --> 01:38:59,109
definitely there studies on their
accuracy rates and all that you can look

4754
01:38:59,109 --> 01:38:59,119
accuracy rates and all that you can look
 

4755
01:38:59,119 --> 01:39:01,910
accuracy rates and all that you can look
it up but even if they're wrong I'm just

4756
01:39:01,910 --> 01:39:01,920
it up but even if they're wrong I'm just
 

4757
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:03,910
it up but even if they're wrong I'm just
saying this is right now the best we

4758
01:39:03,910 --> 01:39:03,920
saying this is right now the best we
 

4759
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:06,109
saying this is right now the best we
have this is what Humanity came up with

4760
01:39:06,109 --> 01:39:06,119
have this is what Humanity came up with
 

4761
01:39:06,119 --> 01:39:08,709
have this is what Humanity came up with
as the predicted date but again what

4762
01:39:08,709 --> 01:39:08,719
as the predicted date but again what
 

4763
01:39:08,719 --> 01:39:10,750
as the predicted date but again what
they mean by AGI is really important

4764
01:39:10,750 --> 01:39:10,760
they mean by AGI is really important
 

4765
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:14,990
they mean by AGI is really important
there because there's uh the non-agent

4766
01:39:14,990 --> 01:39:15,000
there because there's uh the non-agent
 

4767
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,270
there because there's uh the non-agent
like AGI and then there's the agent like

4768
01:39:17,270 --> 01:39:17,280
like AGI and then there's the agent like
 

4769
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:19,709
like AGI and then there's the agent like
AGI and I don't think it's as trivial as

4770
01:39:19,709 --> 01:39:19,719
AGI and I don't think it's as trivial as
 

4771
01:39:19,719 --> 01:39:24,189
AGI and I don't think it's as trivial as

01:39:26,870 --> 01:39:26,880
uh one has lipstick and all it takes is
 

4775
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:28,270
uh one has lipstick and all it takes is
to remove the lipstick I don't think

4776
01:39:28,270 --> 01:39:28,280
to remove the lipstick I don't think
 

4777
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:30,350
to remove the lipstick I don't think
it's that true you you may be completely

it's that true you you may be completely
 

4779
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:32,390
it's that true you you may be completely
right but what probability would you

4780
01:39:32,390 --> 01:39:32,400
right but what probability would you
 

4781
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:34,790
right but what probability would you
assign it you may be 10% wrong but we're

4782
01:39:34,790 --> 01:39:34,800
assign it you may be 10% wrong but we're
 

4783
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:36,990
assign it you may be 10% wrong but we're

obviously there are nuanced differences

obviously there are nuanced differences
 

4809
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:10,229
obviously there are nuanced differences
but in terms of capability I don't see a

4810
01:40:10,229 --> 01:40:10,239
but in terms of capability I don't see a
 

4811
01:40:10,239 --> 01:40:13,669
but in terms of capability I don't see a

4831
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:40,510
something very very very capable what do
you feel about all this I mean you've

4832
01:40:40,510 --> 01:40:40,520
you feel about all this I mean you've
 

4833
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:42,629
you feel about all this I mean you've
been uh thinking about AI safety for a

4834
01:40:42,629 --> 01:40:42,639
been uh thinking about AI safety for a
 

4835
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:43,910
been uh thinking about AI safety for a
long long

4836
01:40:43,910 --> 01:40:43,920
long long
 

4837
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:46,430
long long
time and at least for

4838
01:40:46,430 --> 01:40:46,440
time and at least for
 

4839
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:51,270
time and at least for
me the leaps I mean it probably started

4840
01:40:51,270 --> 01:40:51,280

was mind-blowing for me and then the

4844
01:40:56,750 --> 01:40:56,760
was mind-blowing for me and then the
 

4845
01:40:56,760 --> 01:41:00,030
was mind-blowing for me and then the
breakthroughs with l&m's even dpd2 but

4846
01:41:00,030 --> 01:41:00,040
breakthroughs with l&m's even dpd2 but
 

4847
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:02,510
breakthroughs with l&m's even dpd2 but
like just the the breakthroughs on llms

4848
01:41:02,510 --> 01:41:02,520
like just the the breakthroughs on llms
 

4849
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:04,390
like just the the breakthroughs on llms
just mind-blowing to me what does it

4850
01:41:04,390 --> 01:41:04,400
just mind-blowing to me what does it
 

4851
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:06,629
just mind-blowing to me what does it
feel like to be living in this day and

4852
01:41:06,629 --> 01:41:06,639
feel like to be living in this day and
 

4853
01:41:06,639 --> 01:41:09,990
feel like to be living in this day and
age where all this talk about AGI feels

4854
01:41:09,990 --> 01:41:10,000
age where all this talk about AGI feels
 

4855
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,189
age where all this talk about AGI feels
like it like this is it actually might

4856
01:41:13,189 --> 01:41:13,199
like it like this is it actually might
 

4857
01:41:13,199 --> 01:41:16,270
like it like this is it actually might
happen and quite soon meaning within our

happen and quite soon meaning within our
 

4859
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:18,430
happen and quite soon meaning within our
lifetime what what does it feel like so

4860
01:41:18,430 --> 01:41:18,440
lifetime what what does it feel like so
 

4861
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:20,709
lifetime what what does it feel like so
when I started working on this it was

4862
01:41:20,709 --> 01:41:20,719
when I started working on this it was
 

4863
01:41:20,719 --> 01:41:22,470
when I started working on this it was
pure science fiction there was no

4864
01:41:22,470 --> 01:41:22,480
pure science fiction there was no
 

4865

paper on AI safety then I was able to

4886
01:41:52,910 --> 01:41:52,920
paper on AI safety then I was able to
 

4887
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:55,350
paper on AI safety then I was able to
read the the best ones then the titles

4888
01:41:55,350 --> 01:41:55,360
read the the best ones then the titles
 

4889
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:56,669
read the the best ones then the titles
and now I don't even know what's going

have to deal with that when I get back

be clear we're still far away from AGI

4910
01:42:23,189 --> 01:42:23,199
be clear we're still far away from AGI
 

4911
01:42:23,199 --> 01:42:26,870
be clear we're still far away from AGI
but not far away in the

4912

for a long time I'm sure there's a lot
 

4997
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:14,910
for a long time I'm sure there's a lot
of value in watching humans cuz we're

01:44:14,910 --> 01:44:14,920
of value in watching humans cuz we're
 

4999
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:17,109
of value in watching humans cuz we're
like um the interesting thing about

01:44:17,109 --> 01:44:17,119
like um the interesting thing about
 

5001
01:44:17,119 --> 01:44:18,510

balanced because of the whole
 

5007
01:44:22,239 --> 01:44:24,189
balanced because of the whole
evolutionary process we've created the

5008
01:44:24,189 --> 01:44:24,199
evolutionary process we've created the
 

5009
01:44:24,199 --> 01:44:26,629
evolutionary process we've created the
society as pretty well balanced like our

5010
01:44:26,629 --> 01:44:26,639
society as pretty well balanced like our
 

5011
01:44:26,639 --> 01:44:28,750
society as pretty well balanced like our
our limitations as as humans and our

our limitations as as humans and our
 

5013
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:31,070
our limitations as as humans and our

capabilities are a balance from a video
 

5015
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:33,070
capabilities are a balance from a video
game perspective so we have wars we have

5016
01:44:33,070 --> 01:44:33,080
game perspective so we have wars we have
 

5017
01:44:33,080 --> 01:44:35,750
game perspective so we have wars we have
conflicts we have cooperation like in a

5018
01:44:35,750 --> 01:44:35,760
conflicts we have cooperation like in a
 

5019
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:37,229
conflicts we have cooperation like in a
game theoretic way it's an interesting

5020
01:44:37,229 --> 01:44:37,239
game theoretic way it's an interesting
 

5021
01:44:37,239 --> 01:44:39,430
game theoretic way it's an interesting
system to watch in the same way then

5022
01:44:39,430 --> 01:44:39,440
system to watch in the same way then
 

5023
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:41,149
system to watch in the same way then
andt colony is an interesting system to

5024
01:44:41,149 --> 01:44:41,159
andt colony is an interesting system to
 

5025
01:44:41,159 --> 01:44:43,910
andt colony is an interesting system to
watch so like if I was an alien

5026
01:44:43,910 --> 01:44:43,920
watch so like if I was an alien
 

5027
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:45,629
watch so like if I was an alien
civilization I wouldn't want to disturb

5028
01:44:45,629 --> 01:44:45,639
civilization I wouldn't want to disturb
 

5029
01:44:45,639 --> 01:44:47,790
civilization I wouldn't want to disturb
it I'd just watch it be interesting

5030
01:44:47,790 --> 01:44:47,800
it I'd just watch it be interesting
 

5031
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:49,470
it I'd just watch it be interesting
maybe perturb it every once in a while

5032
01:44:49,470 --> 01:44:49,480
maybe perturb it every once in a while
 

5033
01:44:49,480 --> 01:44:51,910
maybe perturb it every once in a while
in interesting ways well we getting back

5034
01:44:51,910 --> 01:44:51,920
in interesting ways well we getting back

to our simulation discussion from before
 

5037
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:57,030
to our simulation discussion from before
how did it happen that we exist at

5038
01:44:57,030 --> 01:44:57,040
how did it happen that we exist at
 

5039
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:59,669
how did it happen that we exist at
exactly like the most interesting 20 30

5040
01:44:59,669 --> 01:44:59,679
exactly like the most interesting 20 30
 

5041
01:44:59,679 --> 01:45:02,030
exactly like the most interesting 20 30
years in a history of this civilization

5042
01:45:02,030 --> 01:45:02,040
years in a history of this civilization
 

5043
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:04,229
years in a history of this civilization
it's been around for 15 billion years

5044
01:45:04,229 --> 01:45:04,239
it's been around for 15 billion years
 

5045
01:45:04,239 --> 01:45:06,629
it's been around for 15 billion years
yeah and that here we are what's the

5046
01:45:06,629 --> 01:45:06,639
yeah and that here we are what's the
 

5047
01:45:06,639 --> 01:45:09,109
yeah and that here we are what's the
probability that we live in a simulation

5048
01:45:09,109 --> 01:45:09,119
probability that we live in a simulation
 

5049
01:45:09,119 --> 01:45:11,270
probability that we live in a simulation
I know never to say 100% but pretty

5050
01:45:11,270 --> 01:45:11,280
I know never to say 100% but pretty
 

5051
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:13,229
I know never to say 100% but pretty
close to

5052
01:45:13,229 --> 01:45:13,239
close to
 

5053
01:45:13,239 --> 01:45:16,350
close to
that is it possible to escape the

5054
01:45:16,350 --> 01:45:16,360
that is it possible to escape the
 

5055
01:45:16,360 --> 01:45:18,910
that is it possible to escape the
simulation I have a paper about that

5056
01:45:18,910 --> 01:45:18,920
simulation I have a paper about that
 

5057
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:20,589
simulation I have a paper about that
this is just a first page teaser but

5058
01:45:20,589 --> 01:45:20,599
this is just a first page teaser but
 

5059
01:45:20,599 --> 01:45:22,790
this is just a first page teaser but
it's like a nice 30 page document I'm

5060
01:45:22,790 --> 01:45:22,800
it's like a nice 30 page document I'm
 

5061
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:25,790
it's like a nice 30 page document I'm
still here but uh yes how to hack the

5062
01:45:25,790 --> 01:45:25,800
still here but uh yes how to hack the
 

5063
01:45:25,800 --> 01:45:27,950
still here but uh yes how to hack the
simulation is the title I spend a lot of

5064
01:45:27,950 --> 01:45:27,960
simulation is the title I spend a lot of
 

5065
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:29,910
simulation is the title I spend a lot of
time thinking about that that would be

5066
01:45:29,910 --> 01:45:29,920
time thinking about that that would be
 

5067
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:31,149
time thinking about that that would be
something I would want super

5068
01:45:31,149 --> 01:45:31,159
something I would want super
 

5069
01:45:31,159 --> 01:45:32,910
something I would want super
intelligence to help us with and that's

5070
01:45:32,910 --> 01:45:32,920
intelligence to help us with and that's
 

5071
01:45:32,920 --> 01:45:36,270
intelligence to help us with and that's
exactly what the paper is about we used

5072
01:45:36,270 --> 01:45:36,280
exactly what the paper is about we used
 

5073
01:45:36,280 --> 01:45:39,030
exactly what the paper is about we used
AI boxing as a possible tool for control

5074
01:45:39,030 --> 01:45:39,040
AI boxing as a possible tool for control
 

5075
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:43,910
AI boxing as a possible tool for control
AI we realized AI will always Escape but

5076
01:45:43,910 --> 01:45:43,920
AI we realized AI will always Escape but
 

5077
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:46,390
AI we realized AI will always Escape but
that is a skill we might use to help us

5078
01:45:46,390 --> 01:45:46,400
that is a skill we might use to help us
 

5079
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:49,790
that is a skill we might use to help us
escape from our virtual box if we are in

5080
01:45:49,790 --> 01:45:49,800
escape from our virtual box if we are in

01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:51,910
escape from our virtual box if we are in
one yeah that you you have a lot of

5082
01:45:51,910 --> 01:45:51,920
one yeah that you you have a lot of
 

5083
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:53,589

a question I asked him what he would ask

5088
01:45:57,550 --> 01:45:57,560
a question I asked him what he would ask
 

5089
01:45:57,560 --> 01:46:00,310
a question I asked him what he would ask
an AGI system and he said he would ask

5090
01:46:00,310 --> 01:46:00,320
an AGI system and he said he would ask
 

5091
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:02,470
an AGI system and he said he would ask
what's outside the simulation that's a

what's outside the simulation that's a
 

5093
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:05,030
what's outside the simulation that's a
really good question to ask and maybe

5094
01:46:05,030 --> 01:46:05,040
really good question to ask and maybe
 

5095
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:06,669
really good question to ask and maybe
the followup is the title of the paper

01:47:39,830 --> 01:47:39,840
to escape it to be there so the
 

5171
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:43,470
to escape it to be there so the
possibility of f of a of a takeoff where

01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:47,109
the agents become smart enough to escape
the simulation would be the thing i' be

the simulation would be the thing i' be
 

5177
01:47:47,119 --> 01:47:49,270
the simulation would be the thing i' be
waiting for that could be the test

5178
01:47:49,270 --> 01:47:49,280
waiting for that could be the test
 

5179
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:51,550

01:49:49,109 --> 01:49:49,119
that what do you think about AI safety
 

5267
01:49:49,119 --> 01:49:52,149
that what do you think about AI safety
in the simulated world so can you can

5268
01:49:52,149 --> 01:49:52,159
in the simulated world so can you can
 

5269
01:49:52,159 --> 01:49:54,870
in the simulated world so can you can
you have kind

5270
01:49:54,870 --> 01:49:54,880
you have kind
 

5271
01:49:54,880 --> 01:50:00,189
you have kind
of create simulated worlds where you can

5272
01:50:00,189 --> 01:50:00,199

5288
01:50:21,629 --> 01:50:21,639
out if they can hack out they will and
 

5289
01:50:21,639 --> 01:50:23,390
out if they can hack out they will and
if you're observing them that means

5290
01:50:23,390 --> 01:50:23,400
if you're observing them that means
 

5291
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:24,990
if you're observing them that means
there is a communication Channel and

5292
01:50:24,990 --> 01:50:25,000
there is a communication Channel and
 

5293
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:26,589
there is a communication Channel and
that's enough for social engineering

5294
01:50:26,589 --> 01:50:26,599
that's enough for social engineering
 

5295
01:50:26,599 --> 01:50:30,229
that's enough for social engineering
attack so really it's uh it's impossible

5296
01:50:30,229 --> 01:50:30,239
attack so really it's uh it's impossible
 

5297
01:50:30,239 --> 01:50:34,350

courses and shrinkage of in person where
 

5355
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:56,390
courses and shrinkage of in person where
I always understood in person being the

5356
01:51:56,390 --> 01:51:56,400
I always understood in person being the
 

5357
01:51:56,400 --> 01:52:00,470
I always understood in person being the
only value I offer so it's

5358
01:52:00,470 --> 01:52:00,480
only value I offer so it's
 

5359
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:02,950
only value I offer so it's
puzzling I don't know that there could

5360
01:52:02,950 --> 01:52:02,960
puzzling I don't know that there could
 

5361
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:05,310
puzzling I don't know that there could
be a a trend towards the

5362
01:52:05,310 --> 01:52:05,320
be a a trend towards the
 

5363
01:52:05,320 --> 01:52:07,629
be a a trend towards the
inperson because of deep fakes because

5364
01:52:07,629 --> 01:52:07,639
inperson because of deep fakes because
 

5365
01:52:07,639 --> 01:52:11,589
inperson because of deep fakes because
of uh inability to

5366
01:52:11,589 --> 01:52:11,599
of uh inability to
 

5367
01:52:11,599 --> 01:52:14,229
of uh inability to
trust in inability to trust the veracity

5368
01:52:14,229 --> 01:52:14,239
trust in inability to trust the veracity
 

5369
01:52:14,239 --> 01:52:16,310
trust in inability to trust the veracity
of anything on the internet so the only

5370
01:52:16,310 --> 01:52:16,320
of anything on the internet so the only
 

5371
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:20,270
of anything on the internet so the only
way to verify is by being there in

5372
01:52:20,270 --> 01:52:20,280
way to verify is by being there in
 

5373
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:24,030
way to verify is by being there in
person but not yet

5374
01:52:24,030 --> 01:52:24,040
person but not yet
 

5375
01:52:24,040 --> 01:52:25,910
person but not yet
uh why do you think aliens haven't come

5376
01:52:25,910 --> 01:52:25,920
uh why do you think aliens haven't come
 

5377
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:29,390
uh why do you think aliens haven't come
here yet so there is a lot of real

5378
01:52:29,390 --> 01:52:29,400
here yet so there is a lot of real
 

5379
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:31,310
here yet so there is a lot of real
estate out there it would be surprising

5380
01:52:31,310 --> 01:52:31,320
estate out there it would be surprising
 

5381
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:33,750
estate out there it would be surprising
if it was all for nothing it was empty

5382
01:52:33,750 --> 01:52:33,760
if it was all for nothing it was empty
 

5383
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:36,109
if it was all for nothing it was empty
and the moment there is Advanced enough

5384
01:52:36,109 --> 01:52:36,119
and the moment there is Advanced enough
 

5385
01:52:36,119 --> 01:52:38,390
and the moment there is Advanced enough
biological civilization kind of self

5386
01:52:38,390 --> 01:52:38,400
biological civilization kind of self
 

5387
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:40,510
biological civilization kind of self
starting civilization it probably starts

5388
01:52:40,510 --> 01:52:40,520
starting civilization it probably starts
 

5389
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:43,270
starting civilization it probably starts
sending out the Norman probes everywhere

5390
01:52:43,270 --> 01:52:43,280
sending out the Norman probes everywhere
 

5391
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:45,430
sending out the Norman probes everywhere
and so for every biological one there

5392
01:52:45,430 --> 01:52:45,440
and so for every biological one there
 

5393
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:48,229
and so for every biological one there
got to be trillions of robot populated

5394
01:52:48,229 --> 01:52:48,239
got to be trillions of robot populated
 

5395
01:52:48,239 --> 01:52:50,430
got to be trillions of robot populated
planets which probably do more of the

5396
01:52:50,430 --> 01:52:50,440
planets which probably do more of the
 

5397
01:52:50,440 --> 01:52:56,030
planets which probably do more of the
same so it is uh uh likely

5398
01:52:56,030 --> 01:52:56,040
same so it is uh uh likely
 

5399
01:52:56,040 --> 01:52:58,069
same so it is uh uh likely
statistically so now the fact that we

5400
01:52:58,069 --> 01:52:58,079
statistically so now the fact that we
 

5401
01:52:58,079 --> 01:52:59,589
statistically so now the fact that we
haven't seen them one one answer is

5402
01:52:59,589 --> 01:52:59,599
haven't seen them one one answer is
 

5403
01:52:59,599 --> 01:53:00,750
haven't seen them one one answer is
we're in a

5404
01:53:00,750 --> 01:53:00,760
we're in a
 

5405
01:53:00,760 --> 01:53:02,750
we're in a
simulation it'd

5406
01:53:02,750 --> 01:53:02,760
simulation it'd
 

5407
01:53:02,760 --> 01:53:06,069
simulation it'd
be it would be hard to like add simulate

5408
01:53:06,069 --> 01:53:06,079
be it would be hard to like add simulate
 

5409
01:53:06,079 --> 01:53:07,790
be it would be hard to like add simulate
or it be not interesting to simulate all

5410
01:53:07,790 --> 01:53:07,800
or it be not interesting to simulate all
 

5411
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:10,030
or it be not interesting to simulate all
those other intelligences it's a better

5412
01:53:10,030 --> 01:53:10,040
those other intelligences it's a better
 

5413
01:53:10,040 --> 01:53:11,470
those other intelligences it's a better
it's better for the narrative you have

5414
01:53:11,470 --> 01:53:11,480
it's better for the narrative you have
 

5415
01:53:11,480 --> 01:53:14,750
it's better for the narrative you have
to have a control variable yeah

5416
01:53:14,750 --> 01:53:14,760
to have a control variable yeah
 

5417
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:16,350
to have a control variable yeah
exactly

5418
01:53:16,350 --> 01:53:16,360
exactly
 

5419
01:53:16,360 --> 01:53:19,270
exactly
okay uh but it's also possible that

5420
01:53:19,270 --> 01:53:19,280
okay uh but it's also possible that
 

5421
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:20,750
okay uh but it's also possible that
there is if we're not in simulation that

5422
01:53:20,750 --> 01:53:20,760
there is if we're not in simulation that
 

5423
01:53:20,760 --> 01:53:23,109
there is if we're not in simulation that
there is a great filter that

5424
01:53:23,109 --> 01:53:23,119
there is a great filter that
 

5425
01:53:23,119 --> 01:53:25,550
there is a great filter that
that naturally a lot of civilizations

5426
01:53:25,550 --> 01:53:25,560
that naturally a lot of civilizations
 

5427
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:27,750
that naturally a lot of civilizations
get to this point where there's super

5428
01:53:27,750 --> 01:53:27,760
get to this point where there's super
 

5429
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:30,109
get to this point where there's super
intelligent agents and then it just

5430
01:53:30,109 --> 01:53:30,119
intelligent agents and then it just
 

5431
01:53:30,119 --> 01:53:35,109
intelligent agents and then it just
goes just dies so maybe uh throughout

5432
01:53:35,109 --> 01:53:35,119
goes just dies so maybe uh throughout
 

5433
01:53:35,119 --> 01:53:36,709
goes just dies so maybe uh throughout
our galaxy and throughout the Universe

5434
01:53:36,709 --> 01:53:36,719
our galaxy and throughout the Universe
 

5435
01:53:36,719 --> 01:53:38,910
our galaxy and throughout the Universe
there's just a bunch of dead alien

5436
01:53:38,910 --> 01:53:38,920
there's just a bunch of dead alien
 

5437
01:53:38,920 --> 01:53:41,069
there's just a bunch of dead alien
civilizations it's possible I used to

5438
01:53:41,069 --> 01:53:41,079
civilizations it's possible I used to
 

5439
01:53:41,079 --> 01:53:43,270
civilizations it's possible I used to
think that AI was the great filter but I

5440
01:53:43,270 --> 01:53:43,280
think that AI was the great filter but I
 

5441
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:45,870
think that AI was the great filter but I
would expect like a wall of comporium

5442
01:53:45,870 --> 01:53:45,880
would expect like a wall of comporium
 

5443
01:53:45,880 --> 01:53:48,229
would expect like a wall of comporium
approaching us a speed of light or

5444
01:53:48,229 --> 01:53:48,239
approaching us a speed of light or
 

5445
01:53:48,239 --> 01:53:50,790
approaching us a speed of light or
robots or something and I don't see it

5446
01:53:50,790 --> 01:53:50,800
robots or something and I don't see it
 

5447
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:52,149
robots or something and I don't see it
so it would still make a lot of noise it

5448
01:53:52,149 --> 01:53:52,159
so it would still make a lot of noise it
 

5449
01:53:52,159 --> 01:53:53,470
so it would still make a lot of noise it
might not be interesting it might not

5450
01:53:53,470 --> 01:53:53,480
might not be interesting it might not
 

5451
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:56,109
might not be interesting it might not
possess Consciousness what we've been

5452
01:53:56,109 --> 01:53:56,119
possess Consciousness what we've been
 

5453
01:53:56,119 --> 01:53:56,990

talking

5454
01:53:56,990 --> 01:53:57,000
talking
 

5455
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:00,830
talking
about it sounds like both you and I like

5456
01:54:00,830 --> 01:54:00,840
about it sounds like both you and I like
 

5457
01:54:00,840 --> 01:54:03,750
about it sounds like both you and I like
humans some

5458
01:54:03,750 --> 01:54:03,760
humans some
 

5459
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:07,709
humans some
humans humans on the whole and so and we

5460
01:54:07,709 --> 01:54:07,719
humans humans on the whole and so and we
 

5461
01:54:07,719 --> 01:54:09,390
humans humans on the whole and so and we
would like to preserve the the flame of

5462
01:54:09,390 --> 01:54:09,400
would like to preserve the the flame of
 

5463
01:54:09,400 --> 01:54:11,390
would like to preserve the the flame of
human consciousness uh what do you think

5464
01:54:11,390 --> 01:54:11,400
human consciousness uh what do you think
 

5465
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:13,750
human consciousness uh what do you think
makes humans

5466
01:54:13,750 --> 01:54:13,760
makes humans
 

5467
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:16,069
makes humans
special that we would like to preserve

5468
01:54:16,069 --> 01:54:16,079
special that we would like to preserve
 

5469
01:54:16,079 --> 01:54:17,870
special that we would like to preserve
them are we just being

5470
01:54:17,870 --> 01:54:17,880
them are we just being
 

5471
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:20,030
them are we just being
selfish or is there something special

5472
01:54:20,030 --> 01:54:20,040
selfish or is there something special
 

5473
01:54:20,040 --> 01:54:23,950
selfish or is there something special
about humans so the only thing which

5474
01:54:23,950 --> 01:54:23,960
about humans so the only thing which
 

5475
01:54:23,960 --> 01:54:26,270
about humans so the only thing which
matters is consciousness outside of it

5476
01:54:26,270 --> 01:54:26,280
matters is consciousness outside of it
 

5477
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:28,830
matters is consciousness outside of it
nothing else matters and internal states

5478
01:54:28,830 --> 01:54:28,840
nothing else matters and internal states
 

5479
01:54:28,840 --> 01:54:32,910
nothing else matters and internal states
of qualia pain pleasure it seems that it

5480
01:54:32,910 --> 01:54:32,920
of qualia pain pleasure it seems that it
 

5481
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:35,709
of qualia pain pleasure it seems that it
is unique to living beings I'm not aware

5482
01:54:35,709 --> 01:54:35,719
is unique to living beings I'm not aware
 

5483
01:54:35,719 --> 01:54:38,030
is unique to living beings I'm not aware
of anyone claiming that I can torture a

there is a society for prevention of

5488
01:54:42,669 --> 01:54:42,679
there is a society for prevention of
 

5489
01:54:42,679 --> 01:54:46,470
there is a society for prevention of
suffering to learning algorithms but uh

5490
01:54:46,470 --> 01:54:46,480
suffering to learning algorithms but uh
 

5491
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:48,589
suffering to learning algorithms but uh
a real

5492
01:54:48,589 --> 01:54:48,599
a real
 

5493
01:54:48,599 --> 01:54:50,709
a real
thing many things are real on the

5494
01:54:50,709 --> 01:54:50,719
thing many things are real on the
 

5495
01:54:50,719 --> 01:54:54,189
thing many things are real on the
internet but uh uh I I don't think

5496
01:54:54,189 --> 01:54:54,199
internet but uh uh I I don't think
 

5497
01:54:54,199 --> 01:54:55,950
internet but uh uh I I don't think
anyone if I told them you know sit down

5498
01:54:55,950 --> 01:54:55,960
anyone if I told them you know sit down
 

5499
01:54:55,960 --> 01:54:58,229
anyone if I told them you know sit down
and write a function to feel pain they

5500
01:54:58,229 --> 01:54:58,239
and write a function to feel pain they
 

5501
01:54:58,239 --> 01:55:00,669
and write a function to feel pain they
would go beyond having an integer

5502
01:55:00,669 --> 01:55:00,679
would go beyond having an integer
 

5503
01:55:00,679 --> 01:55:02,550
would go beyond having an integer
variable called pain and increasing the

5504
01:55:02,550 --> 01:55:02,560
variable called pain and increasing the
 

5505
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:04,950
variable called pain and increasing the
count so we don't know how to do it and

5506
01:55:04,950 --> 01:55:04,960
count so we don't know how to do it and
 

5507
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:05,990
count so we don't know how to do it and
that's

5508
01:55:05,990 --> 01:55:06,000
that's
 

5509
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:09,750
that's
unique uh that's what creates meaning it

5510
01:55:09,750 --> 01:55:09,760
unique uh that's what creates meaning it
 

5511
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:11,350
unique uh that's what creates meaning it
would be kind

5539
01:55:43,400 --> 01:55:45,030

01:55:48,470 --> 01:55:48,480
the machines and thereby the question
 

5543
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:52,510

extends to our legal system do you think

5544
01:55:52,510 --> 01:55:52,520
extends to our legal system do you think
 

5545
01:55:52,520 --> 01:55:54,830
extends to our legal system do you think
uh at that point robot should have

5546
01:55:54,830 --> 01:55:54,840
uh at that point robot should have
 

5547
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:58,109
uh at that point robot should have
rights yeah I think I think we

5548
01:55:58,109 --> 01:55:58,119

it's very hard for me to argue that they

internal state of experience that we
 

5611
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:17,149
internal state of experience that we
share bugs it will show that we share

5612
01:57:17,149 --> 01:57:17,159
share bugs it will show that we share
 

5613
01:57:17,159 --> 01:57:18,709

completely different internal States it
 

5617
01:57:20,520 --> 01:57:22,629
completely different internal States it
would not register for us but it's a

have access to a conscious model or they
 

5629
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:35,669
have access to a conscious model or they
are themselves so the reason Illusions

5630
01:57:35,669 --> 01:57:35,679
are themselves so the reason Illusions
 

5631
01:57:35,679 --> 01:57:38,229
are themselves so the reason Illusions
are interesting is I guess

5632
01:57:38,229 --> 01:57:38,239
are interesting is I guess
 

5633
01:57:38,239 --> 01:57:41,270
are interesting is I guess

because it's a it's a really weird

5643
01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:56,550

that puts more emphasis on the actual

01:57:56,550 --> 01:57:56,560
that puts more emphasis on the actual
 

5645
01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:59,030
that puts more emphasis on the actual

01:57:59,030 --> 01:57:59,040
experience and we know animals can
 

5647
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:00,950
experience and we know animals can
experience some optical illusion so we

5648
01:58:00,950 --> 01:58:00,960
experience some optical illusion so we
 

5649
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:02,589
experience some optical illusion so we
know they have certain types of

01:58:02,589 --> 01:58:02,599
know they have certain types of
 

5651
01:58:02,599 --> 01:58:04,950
know they have certain types of
Consciousness as a result I would say

5652
01:58:04,950 --> 01:58:04,960
Consciousness as a result I would say
 

5653
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:07,870
Consciousness as a result I would say
yeah well that that just goes to my

5654
01:58:07,870 --> 01:58:07,880
yeah well that that just goes to my
 

5655
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:09,750
yeah well that that just goes to my
sense that the flaws and the bugs is

5656
01:58:09,750 --> 01:58:09,760
sense that the flaws and the bugs is

01:58:09,760 --> 01:58:12,109

what makes humans special makes living

5658
01:58:12,109 --> 01:58:12,119
what makes humans special makes living
 

5659
01:58:12,119 --> 01:58:13,990
what makes humans special makes living
form special so you're saying like yeah

5660
01:58:13,990 --> 01:58:14,000
form special so you're saying like yeah
 

5661
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:15,990
form special so you're saying like yeah
a future not a bug it's a feure the bug

5662
01:58:15,990 --> 01:58:16,000
a future not a bug it's a feure the bug
 

5663
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:19,270
a future not a bug it's a feure the bug
is the feature who okay that's a that's

5664
01:58:19,270 --> 01:58:19,280
is the feature who okay that's a that's
 

5665
01:58:19,280 --> 01:58:21,149
is the feature who okay that's a that's
a cool test for Consciousness and you

5666
01:58:21,149 --> 01:58:21,159
a cool test for Consciousness and you
 

5667
01:58:21,159 --> 01:58:22,990
a cool test for Consciousness and you
think that can be engineered here then

5668
01:58:22,990 --> 01:58:23,000
think that can be engineered here then
 

5669
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:24,669
think that can be engineered here then
so there have to be novel Illusions if

5670
01:58:24,669 --> 01:58:24,679
so there have to be novel Illusions if
 

5671
01:58:24,679 --> 01:58:26,310
so there have to be novel Illusions if
it can just Google the answer it's

5672
01:58:26,310 --> 01:58:26,320
it can just Google the answer it's
 

5673
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:28,189
it can just Google the answer it's
useless you have to come up with novel

5674
01:58:28,189 --> 01:58:28,199
useless you have to come up with novel
 

5675
01:58:28,199 --> 01:58:30,270
useless you have to come up with novel
Illusions which we tried automating and

5676
01:58:30,270 --> 01:58:30,280
Illusions which we tried automating and
 

5677
01:58:30,280 --> 01:58:32,589
Illusions which we tried automating and
failed so if someone can develop a

5678
01:58:32,589 --> 01:58:32,599
failed so if someone can develop a
 

5679
01:58:32,599 --> 01:58:34,390
failed so if someone can develop a
system capable of producing novel

5680
01:58:34,390 --> 01:58:34,400
system capable of producing novel
 

5681
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:37,390
system capable of producing novel
optical illusions on demand then we can

5682
01:58:37,390 --> 01:58:37,400
optical illusions on demand then we can
 

5683
01:58:37,400 --> 01:58:39,189
optical illusions on demand then we can
definitely administer that test on

5684
01:58:39,189 --> 01:58:39,199
definitely administer that test on
 

5685
01:58:39,199 --> 01:58:42,030
definitely administer that test on
significant scale with good results

5686
01:58:42,030 --> 01:58:42,040
significant scale with good results
 

5687
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:44,669
significant scale with good results
first of all pretty cool idea um I don't

5688
01:58:44,669 --> 01:58:44,679
first of all pretty cool idea um I don't
 

5689
01:58:44,679 --> 01:58:46,830
first of all pretty cool idea um I don't
know if it's a good General test of

5690
01:58:46,830 --> 01:58:46,840
know if it's a good General test of
 

5691
01:58:46,840 --> 01:58:49,069
know if it's a good General test of
Consciousness it's a good component of

5692
01:58:49,069 --> 01:58:49,079
Consciousness it's a good component of
 

5693
01:58:49,079 --> 01:58:50,990
Consciousness it's a good component of
that and no matter what it's just a cool

5694
01:58:50,990 --> 01:58:51,000
that and no matter what it's just a cool
 

5695
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,510
that and no matter what it's just a cool
idea so um put me in the camp of people

5696
01:58:53,510 --> 01:58:53,520
idea so um put me in the camp of people
 

5697
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:56,750
idea so um put me in the camp of people
that like it uh but you don't think like

5698
01:58:56,750 --> 01:58:56,760
that like it uh but you don't think like
 

5699
01:58:56,760 --> 01:58:58,709
that like it uh but you don't think like
a touring test style Imitation Of

5700
01:58:58,709 --> 01:58:58,719
a touring test style Imitation Of
 

5701
01:58:58,719 --> 01:59:01,149
a touring test style Imitation Of
Consciousness is a good test like if you

5702
01:59:01,149 --> 01:59:01,159
Consciousness is a good test like if you
 

5703
01:59:01,159 --> 01:59:02,750
Consciousness is a good test like if you
can convince a lot of humans that you're

5704
01:59:02,750 --> 01:59:02,760
can convince a lot of humans that you're
 

5705
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:05,830
can convince a lot of humans that you're
conscious that doesn't that to you is

5706
01:59:05,830 --> 01:59:05,840
conscious that doesn't that to you is
 

5707
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:07,830
conscious that doesn't that to you is
not impressive there is so much data in

5708
01:59:07,830 --> 01:59:07,840
not impressive there is so much data in
 

5709
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:09,790
not impressive there is so much data in
the internet I know exactly what to say

5710
01:59:09,790 --> 01:59:09,800
the internet I know exactly what to say
 

5711
01:59:09,800 --> 01:59:12,350
the internet I know exactly what to say
then you ask me common human questions

5712
01:59:12,350 --> 01:59:12,360
then you ask me common human questions
 

5713
01:59:12,360 --> 01:59:14,669
then you ask me common human questions
what does pain feel like what does

5714
01:59:14,669 --> 01:59:14,679
what does pain feel like what does
 

5715
01:59:14,679 --> 01:59:16,950
what does pain feel like what does
pleasure feel like all that is

5716
01:59:16,950 --> 01:59:16,960
pleasure feel like all that is
 

5717
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:19,229

googleable I I think to me Consciousness

5718
01:59:19,229 --> 01:59:19,239
googleable I I think to me Consciousness
 

5719
01:59:19,239 --> 01:59:21,709
googleable I I think to me Consciousness
is closely tied to suffering so you can

02:00:46,750 --> 02:00:46,760
parts need to contribute something to
 

5785
02:00:46,760 --> 02:00:49,470
parts need to contribute something to
the overall system right now we are

5786
02:00:49,470 --> 02:00:49,480
the overall system right now we are
 

5787
02:00:49,480 --> 02:00:51,629
the overall system right now we are
still more capable in many ways so

5788
02:00:51,629 --> 02:00:51,639
still more capable in many ways so
 

5789
02:00:51,639 --> 02:00:54,229
still more capable in many ways so
having this connection to AI would be

5790
02:00:54,229 --> 02:00:54,239
having this connection to AI would be
 

5791
02:00:54,239 --> 02:00:56,510
having this connection to AI would be
incredible would make me super human in

5792
02:00:56,510 --> 02:00:56,520
incredible would make me super human in
 

5793
02:00:56,520 --> 02:00:59,950
incredible would make me super human in
many ways after a while if I'm no longer

5794
02:00:59,950 --> 02:00:59,960
many ways after a while if I'm no longer
 

5795

smarter more creative really don't

5796
02:01:02,470 --> 02:01:02,480
smarter more creative really don't
 

5797
02:01:02,480 --> 02:01:04,750
smarter more creative really don't
contribute much the system finds me as a

5798
02:01:04,750 --> 02:01:04,760
contribute much the system finds me as a
 

5799
02:01:04,760 --> 02:01:06,870
contribute much the system finds me as a
biological bottleneck and even

5800
02:01:06,870 --> 02:01:06,880
biological bottleneck and even
 

5801
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:08,950
biological bottleneck and even
explicitly or implicitly I'm removed

5802
02:01:08,950 --> 02:01:08,960
explicitly or implicitly I'm removed
 

5803
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:11,910
explicitly or implicitly I'm removed
from any participation in the system so

5804
02:01:11,910 --> 02:01:11,920
from any participation in the system so
 

5805
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:14,430
from any participation in the system so
it's like uh the appendix by the way the

5806
02:01:14,430 --> 02:01:14,440
it's like uh the appendix by the way the
 

5807
02:01:14,440 --> 02:01:16,830
it's like uh the appendix by the way the
appendix is still around

5808
02:01:16,830 --> 02:01:16,840
appendix is still around
 

5809
02:01:16,840 --> 02:01:19,950
appendix is still around
so even if it's you said

5810
02:01:19,950 --> 02:01:19,960
so even if it's you said
 

5811
02:01:19,960 --> 02:01:22,109
so even if it's you said
bottleneck I don't know if we become a

5812
02:01:22,109 --> 02:01:22,119
bottleneck I don't know if we become a
 

5813
02:01:22,119 --> 02:01:24,629
bottleneck I don't know if we become a
bottleneck we just might not have much

5814
02:01:24,629 --> 02:01:24,639
bottleneck we just might not have much
 

5815
02:01:24,639 --> 02:01:26,510
bottleneck we just might not have much
use there a different thing than

5816
02:01:26,510 --> 02:01:26,520
use there a different thing than
 

5817
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:29,149
use there a different thing than
bottleneck wasting valuable energy by

5818
02:01:29,149 --> 02:01:29,159
bottleneck wasting valuable energy by
 

5819
02:01:29,159 --> 02:01:31,350
bottleneck wasting valuable energy by
being there we don't waste that much

5820
02:01:31,350 --> 02:01:31,360
being there we don't waste that much
 

5821
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:32,950
being there we don't waste that much
energy we're pretty energy

5822
02:01:32,950 --> 02:01:32,960
energy we're pretty energy
 

5823
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:34,950
energy we're pretty energy
efficient we could just stick around

5824
02:01:34,950 --> 02:01:34,960
efficient we could just stick around
 

5825
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:37,270
efficient we could just stick around
like the appendix come on now that's the

5826

6015
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,030
humans it may somehow but I still feel
kind of bad that it killed all of us I

6016
02:05:35,030 --> 02:05:35,040
kind of bad that it killed all of us I
 

6017
02:05:35,040 --> 02:05:37,030
kind of bad that it killed all of us I
would prefer that doesn't

would prefer that doesn't
 

6019

happen I can be happy for others but to
 

6021
02:05:39,719 --> 02:05:42,350
happen I can be happy for others but to
a certain degree it would be nice if we

6022
02:05:42,350 --> 02:05:42,360
a certain degree it would be nice if we
 

6023
02:05:42,360 --> 02:05:44,310
a certain degree it would be nice if we
stuck around for a long time at least

6024
02:05:44,310 --> 02:05:44,320
stuck around for a long time at least
 

6025
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:47,549
stuck around for a long time at least
give us a planet the human Planet it'd

6026

give us a planet the human Planet it'd
 

6027
02:05:47,559 --> 02:05:49,390
give us a planet the human Planet it'd
be nice for it to be Earth and then they

6028
02:05:49,390 --> 02:05:49,400
be nice for it to be Earth and then they
 

6029
02:05:49,400 --> 02:05:51,790
be nice for it to be Earth and then they
can go elsewhere since they're so smart

6030
02:05:51,790 --> 02:05:51,800
can go elsewhere since they're so smart
 

6031
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:54,549

but it's a big if this whole thing about
 

6061

6073
02:06:43,800 --> 02:06:45,549

it's the the old power corrupts and

02:06:45,549 --> 02:06:45,559
it's the the old power corrupts and
 

6075
02:06:45,559 --> 02:06:48,229
it's the the old power corrupts and
absolute power corrupts

absolute power corrupts
 

6077
02:06:48,239 --> 02:06:50,750
absolute power corrupts
absolutely and it feels like control

6078
02:06:50,750 --> 02:06:50,760
absolutely and it feels like control
 

6079
02:06:50,760 --> 02:06:53,709
absolutely and it feels like control
over AGI I say we live in a universe

02:06:53,709 --> 02:06:53,719
over AGI I say we live in a universe
 

6081
02:06:53,719 --> 02:06:55,350
over AGI I say we live in a universe
where that's possible we come up with

6082
02:06:55,350 --> 02:06:55,360
where that's possible we come up with
 

6083
02:06:55,360 --> 02:06:57,950
where that's possible we come up with
ways to actually do that it's also

6084
02:06:57,950 --> 02:06:57,960
ways to actually do that it's also
 

6085
02:06:57,960 --> 02:07:00,750
ways to actually do that it's also
scary because the collection of humans

6086
02:07:00,750 --> 02:07:00,760
scary because the collection of humans
 

6087
02:07:00,760 --> 02:07:03,270
scary because the collection of humans
that have the control over AGI they

6088
02:07:03,270 --> 02:07:03,280
that have the control over AGI they
 

6089
02:07:03,280 --> 02:07:05,030
that have the control over AGI they
become more powerful than the other

6090
02:07:05,030 --> 02:07:05,040
become more powerful than the other
 

6091
02:07:05,040 --> 02:07:07,830
become more powerful than the other
humans and uh they can let that power

6092
02:07:07,830 --> 02:07:07,840
humans and uh they can let that power
 

6093
02:07:07,840 --> 02:07:08,870
humans and uh they can let that power
get to their

6094
02:07:08,870 --> 02:07:08,880
get to their
 

6095
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:12,830
get to their
head and then a small selection of them

6096
02:07:12,830 --> 02:07:12,840
head and then a small selection of them
 

6097
02:07:12,840 --> 02:07:14,030
head and then a small selection of them
back to

6098
02:07:14,030 --> 02:07:14,040
back to
 

6099
02:07:14,040 --> 02:07:16,470
back to
Stalin uh start getting ideas and then

6100
02:07:16,470 --> 02:07:16,480
Stalin uh start getting ideas and then
 

6101
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:18,229
Stalin uh start getting ideas and then
eventually it's one person usually with

6102
02:07:18,229 --> 02:07:18,239
eventually it's one person usually with
 

6103
02:07:18,239 --> 02:07:21,109
eventually it's one person usually with
a mustache or a funny hat that starts

6104
02:07:21,109 --> 02:07:21,119
a mustache or a funny hat that starts
 

6105
02:07:21,119 --> 02:07:22,830
a mustache or a funny hat that starts
sort of making big speeches and then all

6106
02:07:22,830 --> 02:07:22,840
sort of making big speeches and then all
 

6107
02:07:22,840 --> 02:07:24,470
sort of making big speeches and then all
of a sudden you live in a world that's

6108
02:07:24,470 --> 02:07:24,480
of a sudden you live in a world that's
 

6109
02:07:24,480 --> 02:07:26,510
of a sudden you live in a world that's
either 1984 A Brave New

6110
02:07:26,510 --> 02:07:26,520
either 1984 A Brave New
 

6111
02:07:26,520 --> 02:07:30,470
either 1984 A Brave New
World and uh always at war with somebody

6112
02:07:30,470 --> 02:07:30,480
World and uh always at war with somebody
 

6113
02:07:30,480 --> 02:07:33,350
World and uh always at war with somebody
and you know this whole idea of control

6114
02:07:33,350 --> 02:07:33,360
and you know this whole idea of control
 

6115
02:07:33,360 --> 02:07:36,229
and you know this whole idea of control
turned out to be uh actually also not

6116
02:07:36,229 --> 02:07:36,239
turned out to be uh actually also not
 

6117
02:07:36,239 --> 02:07:38,229
turned out to be uh actually also not
beneficial to humanity so that's scary

6118
02:07:38,229 --> 02:07:38,239
beneficial to humanity so that's scary
 

6119
02:07:38,239 --> 02:07:40,109
beneficial to humanity so that's scary
too it's actually worse because

6120
02:07:40,109 --> 02:07:40,119
too it's actually worse because
 

6121
02:07:40,119 --> 02:07:42,910
too it's actually worse because
historically they all died this could be

6122
02:07:42,910 --> 02:07:42,920
historically they all died this could be
 

6123
02:07:42,920 --> 02:07:44,189
historically they all died this could be
different this could be permanent

6124
02:07:44,189 --> 02:07:44,199
different this could be permanent
 

6125
02:07:44,199 --> 02:07:46,910
different this could be permanent
dictatorship permanent suffering well

6126
02:07:46,910 --> 02:07:46,920
dictatorship permanent suffering well
 

6127
02:07:46,920 --> 02:07:48,709
dictatorship permanent suffering well
the nice thing about humans it seems

6128
02:07:48,709 --> 02:07:48,719
the nice thing about humans it seems
 

6129
02:07:48,719 --> 02:07:52,069
the nice thing about humans it seems
like it seems like the moment power

6130
02:07:52,069 --> 02:07:52,079
like it seems like the moment power
 

6131
02:07:52,079 --> 02:07:54,589
like it seems like the moment power
starts corrupting their mind they can

6132
02:07:54,589 --> 02:07:54,599
starts corrupting their mind they can
 

6133
02:07:54,599 --> 02:07:55,950
starts corrupting their mind they can
create a huge amount of suffering so

6134
02:07:55,950 --> 02:07:55,960
create a huge amount of suffering so
 

6135
02:07:55,960 --> 02:07:58,310
create a huge amount of suffering so
there's Negative they can kill people

6136
02:07:58,310 --> 02:07:58,320
there's Negative they can kill people
 

6137
02:07:58,320 --> 02:08:00,189
there's Negative they can kill people
make people suffer but then they become

6138
02:08:00,189 --> 02:08:00,199
make people suffer but then they become
 

6139
02:08:00,199 --> 02:08:02,109
make people suffer but then they become
worse and worse at their

6140
02:08:02,109 --> 02:08:02,119
worse and worse at their
 

6141
02:08:02,119 --> 02:08:04,510
worse and worse at their
job the it feels like the more evil you

6142
02:08:04,510 --> 02:08:04,520
job the it feels like the more evil you
 

6143
02:08:04,520 --> 02:08:05,430
job the it feels like the more evil you
start

6144
02:08:05,430 --> 02:08:05,440
start
 

6145
02:08:05,440 --> 02:08:09,030
start
doing like the at least they're

6146
02:08:09,030 --> 02:08:09,040
doing like the at least they're
 

6147
02:08:09,040 --> 02:08:11,109
doing like the at least they're
incompetent yeah they well no they

6148
02:08:11,109 --> 02:08:11,119
incompetent yeah they well no they
 

6149
02:08:11,119 --> 02:08:12,830
incompetent yeah they well no they
become more and more incompetent so they

6150
02:08:12,830 --> 02:08:12,840
become more and more incompetent so they
 

6151
02:08:12,840 --> 02:08:15,790
become more and more incompetent so they
start start losing their grip on power

6152
02:08:15,790 --> 02:08:15,800
start start losing their grip on power
 

6153
02:08:15,800 --> 02:08:17,669
start start losing their grip on power
so like holding on to power is not a

6154
02:08:17,669 --> 02:08:17,679
so like holding on to power is not a
 

6155
02:08:17,679 --> 02:08:19,510
so like holding on to power is not a
trivial thing it requires extreme

6156
02:08:19,510 --> 02:08:19,520
trivial thing it requires extreme
 

6157
02:08:19,520 --> 02:08:21,990
trivial thing it requires extreme
competence which I I suppose and was

6158
02:08:21,990 --> 02:08:22,000
competence which I I suppose and was
 

6159
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,549
competence which I I suppose and was
good at it requires you to do evil and

6160
02:08:24,549 --> 02:08:24,559
good at it requires you to do evil and
 

6161
02:08:24,559 --> 02:08:27,549
good at it requires you to do evil and
be competent at it or just get lucky and

6162
02:08:27,549 --> 02:08:27,559
be competent at it or just get lucky and
 

6163
02:08:27,559 --> 02:08:29,069
be competent at it or just get lucky and
those systems help with that you have

6164
02:08:29,069 --> 02:08:29,079
those systems help with that you have
 

6165
02:08:29,079 --> 02:08:31,149
those systems help with that you have
perfect surveillance you can do some

6166
02:08:31,149 --> 02:08:31,159
perfect surveillance you can do some
 

6167
02:08:31,159 --> 02:08:33,510
perfect surveillance you can do some
mind reading I presume eventually it

6168
02:08:33,510 --> 02:08:33,520
mind reading I presume eventually it
 

6169
02:08:33,520 --> 02:08:35,629
mind reading I presume eventually it
would be very hard

6170
02:08:35,629 --> 02:08:35,639
would be very hard
 

6171
02:08:35,639 --> 02:08:39,030
would be very hard
to uh remove control from more capable

6172
02:08:39,030 --> 02:08:39,040
to uh remove control from more capable
 

6173
02:08:39,040 --> 02:08:41,629
to uh remove control from more capable
systems over us and then it would be

6174
02:08:41,629 --> 02:08:41,639
systems over us and then it would be
 

6175
02:08:41,639 --> 02:08:44,149
systems over us and then it would be
hard for humans to become the hackers

6176
02:08:44,149 --> 02:08:44,159
hard for humans to become the hackers
 

6177
02:08:44,159 --> 02:08:45,870
hard for humans to become the hackers
that escape the control of the AGI

6178
02:08:45,870 --> 02:08:45,880
that escape the control of the AGI
 

6179
02:08:45,880 --> 02:08:48,830
that escape the control of the AGI
because the AGI is so damn good and then

6180
02:08:48,830 --> 02:08:48,840
because the AGI is so damn good and then
 

6181
02:08:48,840 --> 02:08:52,629
because the AGI is so damn good and then
yeah yeah yeah

6182
02:08:52,629 --> 02:08:52,639
yeah yeah yeah
 

6183
02:08:52,639 --> 02:08:55,229
yeah yeah yeah
and then the the dictator is Immortal

6184
02:08:55,229 --> 02:08:55,239
and then the the dictator is Immortal
 

6185
02:08:55,239 --> 02:08:56,830
and then the the dictator is Immortal
yeah this not great that's not a great

6186
02:08:56,830 --> 02:08:56,840
yeah this not great that's not a great
 

6187
02:08:56,840 --> 02:08:58,910
yeah this not great that's not a great
outcome see I'm more afraid of humans

6188
02:08:58,910 --> 02:08:58,920
outcome see I'm more afraid of humans
 

6189
02:08:58,920 --> 02:09:00,470
outcome see I'm more afraid of humans
than AI

6190
02:09:00,470 --> 02:09:00,480
than AI
 

6191
02:09:00,480 --> 02:09:03,470
than AI
systems I'm afraid I believe that most

6192
02:09:03,470 --> 02:09:03,480
systems I'm afraid I believe that most
 

6193
02:09:03,480 --> 02:09:04,990
systems I'm afraid I believe that most
humans want to do good and have the

6194
02:09:04,990 --> 02:09:05,000
humans want to do good and have the
 

6195
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:08,390
humans want to do good and have the
capacity to do good but also all humans

6196
02:09:08,390 --> 02:09:08,400
capacity to do good but also all humans
 

6197
02:09:08,400 --> 02:09:09,950
capacity to do good but also all humans
have the capacity to do

6198
02:09:09,950 --> 02:09:09,960
have the capacity to do
 

6199
02:09:09,960 --> 02:09:14,510
have the capacity to do
evil and um when you test them by giving

6200
02:09:14,510 --> 02:09:14,520
evil and um when you test them by giving
 

6201
02:09:14,520 --> 02:09:16,149
evil and um when you test them by giving
them Absolute po as you would if you

6202
02:09:16,149 --> 02:09:16,159
them Absolute po as you would if you
 

6203
02:09:16,159 --> 02:09:17,030
them Absolute po as you would if you
give them

6204
02:09:17,030 --> 02:09:17,040
give them
 

6205
02:09:17,040 --> 02:09:20,189
give them
AGI that could result in a lot a lot of

6206
02:09:20,189 --> 02:09:20,199
AGI that could result in a lot a lot of
 

6207
02:09:20,199 --> 02:09:23,470
AGI that could result in a lot a lot of
suffering

6208
02:09:23,470 --> 02:09:23,480

 

6209
02:09:23,480 --> 02:09:25,990

what gives you hope about the future I

6210
02:09:25,990 --> 02:09:26,000
what gives you hope about the future I
 

6211
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:29,430
what gives you hope about the future I
could be wrong I've been wrong before if

6212
02:09:29,430 --> 02:09:29,440
could be wrong I've been wrong before if
 

6213
02:09:29,440 --> 02:09:32,589
could be wrong I've been wrong before if
if you if you look 100 years from now

6214
02:09:32,589 --> 02:09:32,599
if you if you look 100 years from now
 

6215
02:09:32,599 --> 02:09:35,270
if you if you look 100 years from now
and you're Immortal and you look back

6216
02:09:35,270 --> 02:09:35,280
and you're Immortal and you look back
 

6217
02:09:35,280 --> 02:09:37,109
and you're Immortal and you look back
and it turns out this whole conversation

6218
02:09:37,109 --> 02:09:37,119
and it turns out this whole conversation
 

6219
02:09:37,119 --> 02:09:38,549
and it turns out this whole conversation
you said a lot of things that were very

6220
02:09:38,549 --> 02:09:38,559
you said a lot of things that were very
 

6221
02:09:38,559 --> 02:09:41,990
you said a lot of things that were very
wrong now that looking 100 100 years

6222
02:09:41,990 --> 02:09:42,000
wrong now that looking 100 100 years
 

6223
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,830
wrong now that looking 100 100 years
back what would be the explanation what

6224
02:09:44,830 --> 02:09:44,840
back what would be the explanation what
 

6225
02:09:44,840 --> 02:09:48,430
back what would be the explanation what
happened in those 100 years that made

6226
02:09:48,430 --> 02:09:48,440
happened in those 100 years that made
 

6227
02:09:48,440 --> 02:09:50,950
happened in those 100 years that made
you wrong that made the words you said

6228
02:09:50,950 --> 02:09:50,960
you wrong that made the words you said
 

6229
02:09:50,960 --> 02:09:52,830
you wrong that made the words you said
today wrong there is so many

6230
02:09:52,830 --> 02:09:52,840
today wrong there is so many
 

6231
02:09:52,840 --> 02:09:55,310
today wrong there is so many
possibilities we had catastrophic events

6232
02:09:55,310 --> 02:09:55,320
possibilities we had catastrophic events
 

6233
02:09:55,320 --> 02:09:58,069
possibilities we had catastrophic events
which prevented development of advanced

6234
02:09:58,069 --> 02:09:58,079
which prevented development of advanced
 

6235
02:09:58,079 --> 02:10:01,430
which prevented development of advanced
microchips that's a hopeful future uh we

6236
02:10:01,430 --> 02:10:01,440
microchips that's a hopeful future uh we
 

6237
02:10:01,440 --> 02:10:03,709
microchips that's a hopeful future uh we
could be in one of those personal

6238
02:10:03,709 --> 02:10:03,719
could be in one of those personal
 

6239
02:10:03,719 --> 02:10:05,750
could be in one of those personal
universes and the one I'm in is

6240
02:10:05,750 --> 02:10:05,760
universes and the one I'm in is
 

6241
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:07,910
universes and the one I'm in is
beautiful it's all about me and I like

6242
02:10:07,910 --> 02:10:07,920
beautiful it's all about me and I like
 

6243
02:10:07,920 --> 02:10:10,430
beautiful it's all about me and I like
it a lot so we've now just to linger on

6244
02:10:10,430 --> 02:10:10,440
it a lot so we've now just to linger on
 

6245
02:10:10,440 --> 02:10:12,830
it a lot so we've now just to linger on
that that means like every every human

6246
02:10:12,830 --> 02:10:12,840
that that means like every every human
 

6247
02:10:12,840 --> 02:10:15,470
that that means like every every human
has their personal Universe

6248
02:10:15,470 --> 02:10:15,480
has their personal Universe
 

6249
02:10:15,480 --> 02:10:19,669
has their personal Universe
yes maybe multiple ones hey why not you

6250
02:10:19,669 --> 02:10:19,679
yes maybe multiple ones hey why not you
 

6251
02:10:19,679 --> 02:10:23,149
yes maybe multiple ones hey why not you
shop around uh um it's possible that

6252
02:10:23,149 --> 02:10:23,159
shop around uh um it's possible that
 

6253
02:10:23,159 --> 02:10:25,350
shop around uh um it's possible that
somebody comes up with

6254
02:10:25,350 --> 02:10:25,360
somebody comes up with
 

6255
02:10:25,360 --> 02:10:27,950
somebody comes up with
alternative model for building AI which

6256
02:10:27,950 --> 02:10:27,960
alternative model for building AI which
 

6257
02:10:27,960 --> 02:10:29,990
alternative model for building AI which
is not based on neural networks which

6258
02:10:29,990 --> 02:10:30,000
is not based on neural networks which
 

6259
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:31,950
is not based on neural networks which
are hard to scrutinize and that

6260
02:10:31,950 --> 02:10:31,960
are hard to scrutinize and that
 

6261
02:10:31,960 --> 02:10:35,270
are hard to scrutinize and that
alternative is somehow I don't see how

6262
02:10:35,270 --> 02:10:35,280
alternative is somehow I don't see how
 

6263
02:10:35,280 --> 02:10:38,830
alternative is somehow I don't see how
but somehow avoiding all the problems uh

6264
02:10:38,830 --> 02:10:38,840
but somehow avoiding all the problems uh
 

6265
02:10:38,840 --> 02:10:40,790
but somehow avoiding all the problems uh
I speak about in general terms not

6266
02:10:40,790 --> 02:10:40,800
I speak about in general terms not
 

6267
02:10:40,800 --> 02:10:43,229
I speak about in general terms not
applying them to specific

6268
02:10:43,229 --> 02:10:43,239
applying them to specific
 

6269
02:10:43,239 --> 02:10:45,870
applying them to specific
architectures uh aliens come and give us

6270
02:10:45,870 --> 02:10:45,880
architectures uh aliens come and give us
 

6271
02:10:45,880 --> 02:10:47,709
architectures uh aliens come and give us
friendly super intelligence there is so

6272
02:10:47,709 --> 02:10:47,719
friendly super intelligence there is so
 

6273
02:10:47,719 --> 02:10:49,790
friendly super intelligence there is so
many options is it also possible that

6274
02:10:49,790 --> 02:10:49,800
many options is it also possible that
 

6275
02:10:49,800 --> 02:10:51,470
many options is it also possible that
creating

6276
02:10:51,470 --> 02:10:51,480
creating
 

6277
02:10:51,480 --> 02:10:53,149
creating
super intelligence systems becomes

6278
02:10:53,149 --> 02:10:53,159
super intelligence systems becomes
 

6279
02:10:53,159 --> 02:10:56,149
super intelligence systems becomes
harder and harder so meaning

6280
02:10:56,149 --> 02:10:56,159
harder and harder so meaning
 

6281
02:10:56,159 --> 02:10:59,709
harder and harder so meaning
like it's not so easy to do

6282
02:10:59,709 --> 02:10:59,719
like it's not so easy to do
 

6283
02:10:59,719 --> 02:11:03,510
like it's not so easy to do
the uh fo the take

6284
02:11:03,510 --> 02:11:03,520
the uh fo the take
 

6285
02:11:03,520 --> 02:11:06,310
the uh fo the take
off so that would probably speak more

6286
02:11:06,310 --> 02:11:06,320
off so that would probably speak more
 

6287
02:11:06,320 --> 02:11:09,030
off so that would probably speak more
about how much smarter that system is

6288
02:11:09,030 --> 02:11:09,040
about how much smarter that system is
 

6289
02:11:09,040 --> 02:11:10,870
about how much smarter that system is
compared to us so maybe it's hard to be

6290
02:11:10,870 --> 02:11:10,880
compared to us so maybe it's hard to be
 

6291
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:12,830
compared to us so maybe it's hard to be
a million times smarter but it's still

6292
02:11:12,830 --> 02:11:12,840
a million times smarter but it's still
 

6293
02:11:12,840 --> 02:11:14,950
a million times smarter but it's still
okay to be five times smarter right so

6294
02:11:14,950 --> 02:11:14,960
okay to be five times smarter right so
 

6295
02:11:14,960 --> 02:11:17,069
okay to be five times smarter right so
that is totally possible that I have no

6296
02:11:17,069 --> 02:11:17,079
that is totally possible that I have no
 

6297
02:11:17,079 --> 02:11:20,510
that is totally possible that I have no
objections to so like it's there's a S

6298
02:11:20,510 --> 02:11:20,520
objections to so like it's there's a S
 

6299
02:11:20,520 --> 02:11:22,830
objections to so like it's there's a S
curve type situation about smarter and

6300
02:11:22,830 --> 02:11:22,840
curve type situation about smarter and
 

6301
02:11:22,840 --> 02:11:26,430
curve type situation about smarter and
is going to be like 3.7 times smarter

6302
02:11:26,430 --> 02:11:26,440
is going to be like 3.7 times smarter
 

6303
02:11:26,440 --> 02:11:28,270
is going to be like 3.7 times smarter
than all of human civilization right

6304
02:11:28,270 --> 02:11:28,280
than all of human civilization right
 

6305
02:11:28,280 --> 02:11:30,030
than all of human civilization right
just the problems with face in this

6306
02:11:30,030 --> 02:11:30,040
just the problems with face in this
 

6307
02:11:30,040 --> 02:11:32,149
just the problems with face in this
world each problem is like an IQ test

6308
02:11:32,149 --> 02:11:32,159
world each problem is like an IQ test
 

6309
02:11:32,159 --> 02:11:33,589
world each problem is like an IQ test
you need certain intelligence to solve

6310
02:11:33,589 --> 02:11:33,599
you need certain intelligence to solve
 

6311
02:11:33,599 --> 02:11:35,109
you need certain intelligence to solve
it so we just don't have more complex

6312
02:11:35,109 --> 02:11:35,119
it so we just don't have more complex
 

6313
02:11:35,119 --> 02:11:37,270
it so we just don't have more complex
problems outside of mathematics for it

6314
02:11:37,270 --> 02:11:37,280
problems outside of mathematics for it
 

6315
02:11:37,280 --> 02:11:40,310
problems outside of mathematics for it
to be showing off like you can have IQ

6316
02:11:40,310 --> 02:11:40,320
to be showing off like you can have IQ
 

6317
02:11:40,320 --> 02:11:42,390
to be showing off like you can have IQ
of 500 if you're playing tic tac toe it

6318
02:11:42,390 --> 02:11:42,400
of 500 if you're playing tic tac toe it
 

6319
02:11:42,400 --> 02:11:44,950
of 500 if you're playing tic tac toe it
doesn't show doesn't matter so the idea

6320
02:11:44,950 --> 02:11:44,960
doesn't show doesn't matter so the idea
 

6321
02:11:44,960 --> 02:11:49,390
doesn't show doesn't matter so the idea
there is that the problems Define Your

6322
02:11:49,390 --> 02:11:49,400
there is that the problems Define Your
 

6323
02:11:49,400 --> 02:11:51,229
there is that the problems Define Your
Capacity your cognitive capacity

6324
02:11:51,229 --> 02:11:51,239
Capacity your cognitive capacity
 

6325
02:11:51,239 --> 02:11:53,189
Capacity your cognitive capacity
capacity so because the problems on

6326
02:11:53,189 --> 02:11:53,199
capacity so because the problems on
 

6327
02:11:53,199 --> 02:11:56,069
capacity so because the problems on
Earth are not sufficiently difficult

6328
02:11:56,069 --> 02:11:56,079
Earth are not sufficiently difficult
 

6329
02:11:56,079 --> 02:11:58,229
Earth are not sufficiently difficult
it's not going to be able to um expand

6330
02:11:58,229 --> 02:11:58,239
it's not going to be able to um expand
 

6331
02:11:58,239 --> 02:12:00,790
it's not going to be able to um expand
its cognitive capacity possible and

6332
02:12:00,790 --> 02:12:00,800
its cognitive capacity possible and
 

6333
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:03,030
its cognitive capacity possible and
because of that wouldn't that be a good

6334
02:12:03,030 --> 02:12:03,040
because of that wouldn't that be a good
 

6335
02:12:03,040 --> 02:12:05,390
because of that wouldn't that be a good
thing that it still could be a lot

6336
02:12:05,390 --> 02:12:05,400
thing that it still could be a lot
 

6337
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:07,950
thing that it still could be a lot
smarter than us and to dominate long

6338
02:12:07,950 --> 02:12:07,960
smarter than us and to dominate long
 

6339
02:12:07,960 --> 02:12:10,350
smarter than us and to dominate long
term you just need some Advantage you

6340
02:12:10,350 --> 02:12:10,360
term you just need some Advantage you
 

6341
02:12:10,360 --> 02:12:11,990

have to be the smartest you don't have

6342
02:12:11,990 --> 02:12:12,000
have to be the smartest you don't have
 

6343
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:15,229
have to be the smartest you don't have
to be a million times smarter so even 5x

6344
02:12:15,229 --> 02:12:15,239
to be a million times smarter so even 5x
 

6345
02:12:15,239 --> 02:12:16,910
to be a million times smarter so even 5x
might be enough it'd be impressive what

6346
02:12:16,910 --> 02:12:16,920
might be enough it'd be impressive what
 

6347
02:12:16,920 --> 02:12:20,430
might be enough it'd be impressive what
is it IQ of a thousand I mean I know

those units don't mean anything at that
 

6351
02:12:22,079 --> 02:12:25,069
those units don't mean anything at that
scale but still like as a comparison the

6352
02:12:25,069 --> 02:12:25,079
scale but still like as a comparison the
 

6353
02:12:25,079 --> 02:12:28,109

02:13:02,360 --> 02:13:04,870
exploring the full range of ideas like
the more Einstein you have the more the

02:13:06,320 --> 02:13:07,790
just a high probability you come up with
general relativity I feel like it's more

02:13:07,790 --> 02:13:07,800
general relativity I feel like it's more
 

6391
02:13:07,800 --> 02:13:09,510
general relativity I feel like it's more
about quantity super intelligence than

6392
02:13:09,510 --> 02:13:09,520
about quantity super intelligence than
 

6393
02:13:09,520 --> 02:13:11,990
about quantity super intelligence than
quality super intelligence sure but you

6394
02:13:11,990 --> 02:13:12,000
quality super intelligence sure but you
 

6395
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,270
quality super intelligence sure but you
know quantity and and enough quantity

6396

about humans
 

6407
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:29,549
about humans
and not humans not dying but why are we

here it's a simulation we're being
 

6411
02:13:31,880 --> 02:13:33,629
here it's a simulation we're being
tested the test is will you be dumb

6412
02:13:33,629 --> 02:13:33,639
tested the test is will you be dumb
 

6413
02:13:33,639 --> 02:13:35,149
tested the test is will you be dumb
enough to create super intelligence and

6414
02:13:35,149 --> 02:13:35,159
enough to create super intelligence and
 

6415
02:13:35,159 --> 02:13:38,870
enough to create super intelligence and
release it so the objective function is

6416
02:13:38,870 --> 02:13:38,880
release it so the objective function is
 

6417
02:13:38,880 --> 02:13:42,189

not be dumb enough to kill ourselves
 

6419
02:13:42,199 --> 02:13:44,350
not be dumb enough to kill ourselves
yeah you unsafe prove yourself to be a

6420
02:13:44,350 --> 02:13:44,360
yeah you unsafe prove yourself to be a
 

6421
02:13:44,360 --> 02:13:46,109
yeah you unsafe prove yourself to be a
safe agent who doesn't do that and you

6422
02:13:46,109 --> 02:13:46,119
safe agent who doesn't do that and you
 

6423
02:13:46,119 --> 02:13:48,709
safe agent who doesn't do that and you
get to go to the next game the next

6424
02:13:48,709 --> 02:13:48,719
get to go to the next game the next
 

6425
02:13:48,719 --> 02:13:50,430
get to go to the next game the next
level of the game what's the next level

6426
02:13:50,430 --> 02:13:50,440
level of the game what's the next level
 

6427
02:13:50,440 --> 02:13:51,549
level of the game what's the next level
I don't know

6428
02:13:51,549 --> 02:13:51,559
I don't know
 

6429
02:13:51,559 --> 02:13:53,549
I don't know
I haven't hacked the simulation yet well

6430
02:13:53,549 --> 02:13:53,559
I haven't hacked the simulation yet well
 

6431
02:13:53,559 --> 02:13:55,069
I haven't hacked the simulation yet well
maybe hacking the simulation is the

6432
02:13:55,069 --> 02:13:55,079
maybe hacking the simulation is the
 

6433
02:13:55,079 --> 02:13:57,910
maybe hacking the simulation is the
thing I'm working as fast as I

6434
02:13:57,910 --> 02:13:57,920
thing I'm working as fast as I
 

6435
02:13:57,920 --> 02:14:00,470
thing I'm working as fast as I
can and if physics would be a way to do

6436
02:14:00,470 --> 02:14:00,480
can and if physics would be a way to do
 

6437
02:14:00,480 --> 02:14:02,549
can and if physics would be a way to do
that quantum physics yeah definitely

6438
02:14:02,549 --> 02:14:02,559
that quantum physics yeah definitely
 

6439
02:14:02,559 --> 02:14:04,950
that quantum physics yeah definitely
well I hope we do and I hope whatever is

6440
02:14:04,950 --> 02:14:04,960
well I hope we do and I hope whatever is
 

6441
02:14:04,960 --> 02:14:06,790
well I hope we do and I hope whatever is
outside is even more fun than this one

6442
02:14:06,790 --> 02:14:06,800
outside is even more fun than this one
 

6443
02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:10,030
outside is even more fun than this one
cuz this one was pretty damn fun and uh

6444
02:14:10,030 --> 02:14:10,040
cuz this one was pretty damn fun and uh
 

6445
02:14:10,040 --> 02:14:12,270
cuz this one was pretty damn fun and uh
just a big thank you for doing the work

you're doing there's so much exciting

6448
02:14:13,910 --> 02:14:13,920
you're doing there's so much exciting
 

6449
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:17,870
you're doing there's so much exciting
development in Ai and to ground it in

6450
02:14:17,870 --> 02:14:17,880
development in Ai and to ground it in
 

6451
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:21,629
development in Ai and to ground it in
the um the existential risks is really

6452
02:14:21,629 --> 02:14:21,639
the um the existential risks is really
