2266
00:45:38,109 --> 00:45:38,119
Y how quickly and easily it is for human
 

2267
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:41,150
Y how quickly and easily it is for human
beings to form out groups yeah and to

2268
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:41,160
beings to form out groups yeah and to
 

2269

just read others just as I just did a
 

2271
00:45:44,359 --> 00:45:46,109
just read others just as I just did a
minute ago with the Atlantic completely

2272
00:45:46,109 --> 00:45:46,119
minute ago with the Atlantic completely
 

2273
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:48,790
minute ago with the Atlantic completely
out of the human race and that happens

2274
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:48,800
out of the human race and that happens
 

2275
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,349
out of the human race and that happens
constantly and very easily humans are

2276
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:52,359
constantly and very easily humans are
 

2277
00:45:52,359 --> 00:45:55,549
constantly and very easily humans are
tribal beings so that does not I don't

2278
00:45:55,549 --> 00:45:55,559
tribal beings so that does not I don't
 

2279
00:45:55,559 --> 00:45:56,829
tribal beings so that does not I don't
see how that's compatible with this

2280
00:45:56,829 --> 00:45:56,839
see how that's compatible with this
 

2281
00:45:56,839 --> 00:45:59,430
see how that's compatible with this
essential desire to do good no I I think

2282
00:45:59,430 --> 00:45:59,440
essential desire to do good no I I think
 

2283
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,309
essential desire to do good no I I think
it's like in 1984 the two minutes of

2284
00:46:02,309 --> 00:46:02,319
it's like in 1984 the two minutes of
 

2285
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:05,470
it's like in 1984 the two minutes of
hate there is a part of humans that

2286
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:05,480
hate there is a part of humans that
 

2287
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,190
hate there is a part of humans that
wants to be tribal yeah and wants to

2288
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:08,200
wants to be tribal yeah and wants to
 

2289
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:11,470
wants to be tribal yeah and wants to
direct get angry and hateful and then

2290
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:11,480
direct get angry and hateful and then
 

2291
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,829
direct get angry and hateful and then
that hate is easy to direct yes by

2292
00:46:13,829 --> 00:46:13,839
that hate is easy to direct yes by
 

2293
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:16,750
that hate is easy to direct yes by
especially people as you uh as an

2294
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:16,760
especially people as you uh as an
 

2295
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,950
especially people as you uh as an
anarchist talk about there people in

2296
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:18,960
anarchist talk about there people in
 

2297
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,150
anarchist talk about there people in
power that can direct that anger but I

2298
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:21,160
power that can direct that anger but I
 

2299
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,710
power that can direct that anger but I
think if you just look at recent human

2300
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:23,720
think if you just look at recent human
 

2301
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:27,030
think if you just look at recent human
history the desire for good the communal

2302
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:27,040
history the desire for good the communal
 

2303
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,710
history the desire for good the communal
desire for good outweighs that I think

2304
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:29,720
desire for good outweighs that I think
 

2305

lot of uncertainty States cannot be sure
 

3391
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:17,669
lot of uncertainty States cannot be sure
that other states will not use military

3392
01:09:17,669 --> 01:09:17,679
that other states will not use military
 

3393
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:19,829
that other states will not use military
capabilities against them right they

3394
01:09:19,829 --> 01:09:19,839
capabilities against them right they
 

3395
01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:22,709
capabilities against them right they
want to survive and they want to use

3396

military power
to uh control the

3402
01:09:30,550 --> 01:09:30,560
uncertainty to protect themselves so I I
 

3403
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:33,269
uncertainty to protect themselves so I I
I disagree in that regard and I I see on

3404
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:33,279
I disagree in that regard and I I see on
 

3405
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:35,990
I disagree in that regard and I I see on
your bookshelf uh I think the world is a

3406
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:36,000
your bookshelf uh I think the world is a
 

3407
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,070
your bookshelf uh I think the world is a
lot closer to Brave New World than it is

3408
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:38,080
lot closer to Brave New World than it is
 

3409
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,149
lot closer to Brave New World than it is
to

3410
01:09:39,149 --> 01:09:39,159
to
 

3411
01:09:39,159 --> 01:09:42,550
to
1984 and I think it is if you look at

3412
01:09:42,550 --> 01:09:42,560
1984 and I think it is if you look at
 

3413
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,070
1984 and I think it is if you look at
let's suppose China's influence in

let's suppose China's influence in
 

3415
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:48,149
let's suppose China's influence in
America right the influence is far more

3416
01:09:48,149 --> 01:09:48,159
America right the influence is far more
 

3417
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:51,829
America right the influence is far more
through soft power than military power

3418
01:09:51,829 --> 01:09:51,839
through soft power than military power
 

3419
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:54,110
through soft power than military power
China doesn't threaten America through

3420
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:54,120
China doesn't threaten America through
 

3421
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:55,790
China doesn't threaten America through
you know we're going to kill you it's

01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:55,800
you know we're going to kill you it's
 

3423
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,709
you know we're going to kill you it's
more like their infiltration of

3426
01:09:59,550 --> 01:09:59,560
universities Tik Tock things of that
 

3427
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:01,750
universities Tik Tock things of that
nature maybe this would have worked

3428
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:01,760
nature maybe this would have worked
 

3429
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,270
nature maybe this would have worked
before the pop culture era but I think

3430
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:04,280
before the pop culture era but I think
 

3431
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:06,950
before the pop culture era but I think
one of the reasons we have this kind of

01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,390
it's hard to disentangle the two let's
look at

3468
01:10:49,390 --> 01:10:49,400

01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,350
so scared of having things under control
so like I would never have to get hit in

4458
01:30:48,350 --> 01:30:48,360
so like I would never have to get hit in
 

4459
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:50,270
so like I would never have to get hit in
the face metaphorically and then I

4460
01:30:50,270 --> 01:30:50,280
the face metaphorically and then I
 

4461
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:52,070
the face metaphorically and then I
realized and you realized this as well

4462
01:30:52,070 --> 01:30:52,080
realized and you realized this as well
 

4463

realized and you realized this as well
well everyone who's important gets hit

4464
01:30:54,550 --> 01:30:54,560
well everyone who's important gets hit
 

4465
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:55,669
well everyone who's important gets hit
in the face look at the president

4466
01:30:55,669 --> 01:30:55,679
in the face look at the president
 

4467
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:57,430
in the face look at the president
whoever the president is it becomes a

4468
01:30:57,430 --> 01:30:57,440
whoever the president is it becomes a
 

4469
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:58,550
whoever the president is it becomes a
matter of being strong enough that you

4470
01:30:58,550 --> 01:30:58,560
matter of being strong enough that you
 

4471
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:01,709
matter of being strong enough that you
could take getting hit in the face so

4472
01:31:01,709 --> 01:31:01,719
could take getting hit in the face so
 

4473
01:31:01,719 --> 01:31:04,149
