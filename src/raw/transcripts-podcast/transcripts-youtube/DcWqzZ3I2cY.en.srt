had seen the Earth from space no one
 

327
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,189
had seen the Earth from space no one
knew that we were on this blue planet

328
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:55,199
knew that we were on this blue planet
 

329
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,749
knew that we were on this blue planet
yeah no one knew what it looked like

330
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:56,759
yeah no one knew what it looked like

from out there and gagaran was the first

332
00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,520
from out there and gagaran was the first
 

333
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,550
from out there and gagaran was the first
person to see it one of the things I

334
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:01,560
person to see it one of the things I
 

335
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,110
person to see it one of the things I
think about is how

336
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,120
think about is how
 

337
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,629
think about is how
dangerous those early days were for

338
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:05,639
dangerous those early days were for
 

339
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,909
dangerous those early days were for
gagaran for for Glenn for everybody

340
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:07,919
gagaran for for Glenn for everybody
 

341
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,029
gagaran for for Glenn for everybody
involved like how how big of a risk they

342
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:10,039
involved like how how big of a risk they
 

343
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:11,670
involved like how how big of a risk they
were all taking they were taking huge

344
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:11,680
were all taking they were taking huge
 

345
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,150
were all taking they were taking huge
risks I'm not sure what the uh Soviets

346
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:14,160
risks I'm not sure what the uh Soviets
 

347
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,710
risks I'm not sure what the uh Soviets
thought about gagarin's flight but I

348
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
thought about gagarin's flight but I
 

349
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,510
thought about gagarin's flight but I
think that the Americans thought that

350
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:18,520
think that the Americans thought that
 

351
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,710
think that the Americans thought that
the Allen Shepard flight the flight that

352
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:20,720
the Allen Shepard flight the flight that
 

353
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,510
the Allen Shepard flight the flight that
you know new Shephard is named after the

354
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:22,520
you know new Shephard is named after the
 

355
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,670
you know new Shephard is named after the
first American in space he went on his

356
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:24,680
first American in space he went on his
 

357
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,909
first American in space he went on his
suborbital flight they thought he had

358
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:26,919
suborbital flight they thought he had
 

359
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:30,110
suborbital flight they thought he had
about a 75% chance of

360
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:30,120
about a 75% chance of
 

361
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,110
about a 75% chance of
success um so you know that's a pretty

362
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,120
success um so you know that's a pretty
 

363
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,550
success um so you know that's a pretty
big risk a 25% risk it's it's kind of

364
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:36,560
big risk a 25% risk it's it's kind of
 

365
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,189
big risk a 25% risk it's it's kind of
interesting that Alan Shepard is not

366
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:38,199
interesting that Alan Shepard is not
 

367
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:40,309
interesting that Alan Shepard is not
quite as famous as John Glenn so for

368
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:40,319
quite as famous as John Glenn so for
 

369
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,430
quite as famous as John Glenn so for
people don't know Alan Shepard is the

370
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:42,440
people don't know Alan Shepard is the
 

371
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,869
people don't know Alan Shepard is the
first uh astronaut the first American in

372
00:07:45,869 --> 00:07:45,879
first uh astronaut the first American in
 

373
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:48,390
first uh astronaut the first American in
space American in suborbital Flight

374
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:48,400
space American in suborbital Flight
 

375
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,430
space American in suborbital Flight
correct and and then the first orbital

376
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:50,440
correct and and then the first orbital
 

377
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,909
correct and and then the first orbital
flight is then John Glenn is the first

378
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:52,919
flight is then John Glenn is the first
 

379
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:55,110
flight is then John Glenn is the first
American to orbit the Earth by the way I

380
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,120
American to orbit the Earth by the way I

back to maybe the big picture of space

418
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,240
back to maybe the big picture of space
 

419
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,590
back to maybe the big picture of space
when you look up at the

420
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:45,600
when you look up at the
 

421
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,389
when you look up at the
stars uh and think big what do you hope

422
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:48,399
stars uh and think big what do you hope
 

423
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,949
stars uh and think big what do you hope
is the future of humanity hundreds

424
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:50,959
is the future of humanity hundreds
 

425
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,230
is the future of humanity hundreds
thousands of years from now out in

426
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:53,240
thousands of years from now out in
 

427
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,230
thousands of years from now out in
space I would love to see you know a you

428
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:57,240
space I would love to see you know a you
 

429
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,310
space I would love to see you know a you
know a trillion humans living in the

430
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,320
know a trillion humans living in the
 

431
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,310
know a trillion humans living in the
solar system if we had a trillion humans

432
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:03,320
solar system if we had a trillion humans
 

433
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,269
solar system if we had a trillion humans
we would have at any given time a

434
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:05,279
we would have at any given time a
 

435
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,630
we would have at any given time a
thousand mozarts and a thousand

436
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:07,640
thousand mozarts and a thousand
 

437
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,829
thousand mozarts and a thousand
Einstein um that would you know our

438
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:09,839
Einstein um that would you know our
 

439
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,949
Einstein um that would you know our
solar system would be full of life and

440
00:09:11,949 --> 00:09:11,959
solar system would be full of life and
 

441
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:14,870
solar system would be full of life and
intelligence and energy um and we can

442
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:14,880
intelligence and energy um and we can
 

443
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,509
intelligence and energy um and we can
easily support a civilization that large

444
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519
easily support a civilization that large
 

445
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,990
easily support a civilization that large
with all of the resources um in the

446
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,000
with all of the resources um in the
 

447
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,949
with all of the resources um in the
solar system so what do you think that

448
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:21,959
solar system so what do you think that
 

449
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,870
solar system so what do you think that
looks like giant space stations yeah the

450
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:24,880
looks like giant space stations yeah the
 

451
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,750
looks like giant space stations yeah the
only way to get to that vision is with

452
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:26,760
only way to get to that vision is with
 

453
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,590
only way to get to that vision is with
giant space stations you know the

454
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:28,600
giant space stations you know the
 

455
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,670
giant space stations you know the
planetary surfaces are just way too

456
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:30,680
planetary surfaces are just way too
 

457
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,389
planetary surfaces are just way too
small um so you can I mean unless you

458
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:33,399
small um so you can I mean unless you
 

459
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:35,389
small um so you can I mean unless you
turn them into giant space stations or

460
00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:35,399
turn them into giant space stations or
 

461
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,910
turn them into giant space stations or
something but but yeah we will take

462
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:37,920
something but but yeah we will take
 

463
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,990
something but but yeah we will take
materials from the Moon and from near

464
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:41,000
materials from the Moon and from near
 

465
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,430
materials from the Moon and from near
Earth objects and from the asteroid belt

466
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:43,440
Earth objects and from the asteroid belt
 

467
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,710
Earth objects and from the asteroid belt
and so on and we'll build uh giant

468
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:46,720
and so on and we'll build uh giant
 

469
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,150
and so on and we'll build uh giant
O'Neal style colonies um and people will

470
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,160
O'Neal style colonies um and people will
 

471
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,670
O'Neal style colonies um and people will
live in those and they have a lot of

472
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:51,680
live in those and they have a lot of
 

473
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,190
live in those and they have a lot of
advantages over planetary surfaces you

474
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:54,200
advantages over planetary surfaces you
 

475
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,590
advantages over planetary surfaces you
can spin them to get normal Earth

476
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:56,600
can spin them to get normal Earth
 

477
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,829
can spin them to get normal Earth
gravity you can put them where you want

478
00:09:58,829 --> 00:09:58,839
gravity you can put them where you want
 

479
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:00,430
gravity you can put them where you want
them I think most people are going to

480
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:00,440
them I think most people are going to
 

481
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,190
them I think most people are going to
want to live uh near Earth not

482
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:03,200
want to live uh near Earth not
 

483
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,110
want to live uh near Earth not
necessarily in Earth orbit but in you

484
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:06,120
necessarily in Earth orbit but in you
 

485
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,150
necessarily in Earth orbit but in you
know uh Earth but near Earth vicinity uh

486
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:10,160
know uh Earth but near Earth vicinity uh
 

487
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,310
know uh Earth but near Earth vicinity uh
orbits and so they can move Qui you know

488
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:13,320
orbits and so they can move Qui you know
 

489
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,310
orbits and so they can move Qui you know
relatively quickly uh back and forth

490
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:16,320
relatively quickly uh back and forth
 

491
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,509
relatively quickly uh back and forth
between their station and Earth so I

492
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:19,519
between their station and Earth so I
 

493
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,030
between their station and Earth so I
don't I think a lot of people especially

494
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,040
don't I think a lot of people especially
 

495
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,430
don't I think a lot of people especially
in the early stages are not going to

496
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:22,440
in the early stages are not going to
 

497
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,190
in the early stages are not going to
want to give up Earth altogether they go

498
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:25,200
want to give up Earth altogether they go
 

499
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,870
want to give up Earth altogether they go
to Earth for vacation yeah same way that

500
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:27,880
to Earth for vacation yeah same way that
 

501
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,269
to Earth for vacation yeah same way that
you know you might go to to Yellowstone

502
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:30,279
you know you might go to to Yellowstone
 

503
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:32,389
you know you might go to to Yellowstone
National Park for vacation people will

504
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:32,399
National Park for vacation people will
 

505
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,310
National Park for vacation people will
uh and the ad and no one and people will

506
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:34,320
uh and the ad and no one and people will
 

507
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,829
uh and the ad and no one and people will
get to choose whether they live on earth

508
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:35,839
get to choose whether they live on earth
 

509
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,870
get to choose whether they live on earth
or whether they live in space but

510
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:37,880
or whether they live in space but
 

511
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,509
or whether they live in space but
they'll be able to use much more energy

512
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:40,519
they'll be able to use much more energy
 

513
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:43,069
they'll be able to use much more energy
and much more material resource in space

514
00:10:43,069 --> 00:10:43,079
and much more material resource in space
 

515
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:45,310
and much more material resource in space
than they would be able to use on Earth

516
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:45,320
than they would be able to use on Earth
 

517
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,069
than they would be able to use on Earth
one of the interesting ideas you had is

518
00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:47,079
one of the interesting ideas you had is
 

519
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,030
one of the interesting ideas you had is
to move the heavy industry away from

520
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,040
to move the heavy industry away from
 

521
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,430
to move the heavy industry away from
Earth so people sometimes have this idea

522
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:51,440
Earth so people sometimes have this idea
 

523
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,470
Earth so people sometimes have this idea
that somehow space

524
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:53,480
that somehow space
 

525
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,190
that somehow space
exploration is in conflict with the

526
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:56,200
exploration is in conflict with the
 

527
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,670
exploration is in conflict with the
celebration of the planet Earth that we

528
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:58,680
celebration of the planet Earth that we
 

529
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,350
celebration of the planet Earth that we
should focus on preserving Earth and and

530
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:01,360
should focus on preserving Earth and and
 

531
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,069
should focus on preserving Earth and and
basically your idea is that space travel

532
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:04,079
basically your idea is that space travel
 

533
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,750
basically your idea is that space travel
and space exploration is a way to

534
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:05,760
and space exploration is a way to
 

535
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,910
and space exploration is a way to
preserve Earth exactly this planet we've

536
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:09,920
preserve Earth exactly this planet we've
 

537
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,949
preserve Earth exactly this planet we've
sent robotic probes to all the planets

538
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:12,959
sent robotic probes to all the planets
 

539
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,509
sent robotic probes to all the planets
we know that this is the good

540
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:15,519
we know that this is the good
 

541
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,430
we know that this is the good
one yeah not the play favorites or

542
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:18,440
one yeah not the play favorites or
 

543
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,069
one yeah not the play favorites or
anything but but Earth really is the

544
00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:20,079
anything but but Earth really is the
 

545
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,990
anything but but Earth really is the
good Planet it's an amaz it's it's

546
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,000
good Planet it's an amaz it's it's
 

547
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,230
good Planet it's an amaz it's it's
amazing the ecosystem we have here all

548
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,240
amazing the ecosystem we have here all
 

549
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,389
amazing the ecosystem we have here all
of the life and the Lush uh the plant

550
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:27,399
of the life and the Lush uh the plant
 

551
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:29,870
of the life and the Lush uh the plant
life and you know the water resources

552
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:29,880
life and you know the water resources
 

553
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,150
life and you know the water resources
everything this planet is really

554
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,160
everything this planet is really
 

555
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,230
everything this planet is really
extraordinary and of course we evolved

556
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,240
extraordinary and of course we evolved
 

557
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,069
extraordinary and of course we evolved
on this planet so of course it's perfect

558
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:36,079
on this planet so of course it's perfect
 

559
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,790
on this planet so of course it's perfect
for us but it's also perfect for all the

560
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:38,800
for us but it's also perfect for all the
 

561
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,550
for us but it's also perfect for all the
advanced life forms on this planet all

562
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:40,560
advanced life forms on this planet all
 

563
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,550
advanced life forms on this planet all
the animals and so on and so this is a

564
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:43,560
the animals and so on and so this is a
 

565
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,590
the animals and so on and so this is a
gym we do need to take care of it and as

566
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:46,600
gym we do need to take care of it and as
 

567
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,069
gym we do need to take care of it and as
we enter the anthropos as we get as we

568
00:11:49,069 --> 00:11:49,079
we enter the anthropos as we get as we
 

569
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:52,350
we enter the anthropos as we get as we
humans have gotten so uh sophisticated

570
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:52,360
humans have gotten so uh sophisticated
 

571
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,910
humans have gotten so uh sophisticated
and large and impactful as we stride

572
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:56,920
and large and impactful as we stride
 

573
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,550
and large and impactful as we stride
across this planet you know it's

574
00:11:59,550 --> 00:11:59,560
across this planet you know it's
 

575
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,829
across this planet you know it's
that that is going to as we continue we

576
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:01,839
that that is going to as we continue we
 

577
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,750
that that is going to as we continue we
want to use a lot of energy we want to

578
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:03,760
want to use a lot of energy we want to
 

579
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,389
want to use a lot of energy we want to
use a lot of energy per capita we've

580
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:05,399
use a lot of energy per capita we've
 

581
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,430
use a lot of energy per capita we've
gotten amazing things we we don't want

582
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:07,440
gotten amazing things we we don't want
 

583
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,670
gotten amazing things we we don't want
to go backwards you know if you think

584
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:10,680
to go backwards you know if you think
 

585
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,030
to go backwards you know if you think
about

586
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,040
about
 

587
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,310
about
um the good old days they're mostly an

588
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:16,320
um the good old days they're mostly an
 

589
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,430
um the good old days they're mostly an
illusion like in almost every way life

590
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:19,440
illusion like in almost every way life
 

591
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,870
illusion like in almost every way life
is better for almost everyone today than

592
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:21,880
is better for almost everyone today than
 

593
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,990
is better for almost everyone today than
it was say 50 years ago or 100 years we

594
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:25,000
it was say 50 years ago or 100 years we
 

595
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,710
it was say 50 years ago or 100 years we
all we live better lives by and large

596
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:27,720
all we live better lives by and large
 

597
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,829
all we live better lives by and large
than our grandparents did and then their

598
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:29,839
than our grandparents did and then their
 

599
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,030
than our grandparents did and then their
grandparents did and so on and you can

600
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:32,040
grandparents did and so on and you can
 

601
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,269
grandparents did and so on and you can
see that in global illiteracy rates

602
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:34,279
see that in global illiteracy rates
 

603
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:36,550
see that in global illiteracy rates
Global poverty rates Global infant

604
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:36,560
Global poverty rates Global infant
 

605
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,030
Global poverty rates Global infant
mortality rates like almost any metric

606
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:40,040
mortality rates like almost any metric
 

607
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,069
mortality rates like almost any metric
you choose we're better off than we used

608
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:42,079
you choose we're better off than we used
 

609
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,470
you choose we're better off than we used
to be and we get you know antibiotics

610
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:44,480
to be and we get you know antibiotics
 

611
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,790
to be and we get you know antibiotics
and all kinds of life-saving medical

612
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:46,800
and all kinds of life-saving medical
 

613
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,550
and all kinds of life-saving medical
care and so on and so on and there's one

614
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:50,560
care and so on and so on and there's one
 

615
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,189
care and so on and so on and there's one
thing that is moving backwards and it's

616
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:53,199
thing that is moving backwards and it's
 

617
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:56,590
thing that is moving backwards and it's
the natural world so it is a fact that

618
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:56,600
the natural world so it is a fact that
 

619
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,629
the natural world so it is a fact that
500 years ago pre-industrial age

620
00:12:59,629 --> 00:12:59,639
500 years ago pre-industrial age
 

621
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,230
500 years ago pre-industrial age
the natural world was

622
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:01,240
the natural world was
 

623
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,790
the natural world was
pristine um it was incredible and we

624
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:04,800
pristine um it was incredible and we
 

625
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,870
pristine um it was incredible and we
have traded some of that pristine Beauty

626
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:08,880
have traded some of that pristine Beauty
 

627
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,949
have traded some of that pristine Beauty
for all of these other gifts that we

628
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:10,959
for all of these other gifts that we
 

629
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,910
for all of these other gifts that we
have as an advanced society and we can

630
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:14,920
have as an advanced society and we can
 

631
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,470
have as an advanced society and we can
have both but to do that we have to go

632
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:17,480
have both but to do that we have to go
 

633
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,030
have both but to do that we have to go
to space and all of this really the most

634
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:21,040
to space and all of this really the most
 

635
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,590
to space and all of this really the most
fundamental measure is energy usage per

636
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:24,600
fundamental measure is energy usage per
 

637
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,509
fundamental measure is energy usage per
capita and when you look at you know you

638
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:27,519
capita and when you look at you know you
 

639
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,750
capita and when you look at you know you
do want to continue to use more and more

640
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:29,760
do want to continue to use more and more
 

641
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,790
do want to continue to use more and more
energy it is going to make your life

642
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:31,800
energy it is going to make your life
 

643
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,269
energy it is going to make your life
better in so many ways but that's not

644
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:34,279
better in so many ways but that's not
 

645
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:36,949
better in so many ways but that's not
compatible ultimately with living on a

646
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:36,959
compatible ultimately with living on a
 

647
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,069
compatible ultimately with living on a
finite planet and so we have to go out

648
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:39,079
finite planet and so we have to go out
 

649
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:41,829
finite planet and so we have to go out
into the solar system uh and and really

650
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:41,839
into the solar system uh and and really
 

651
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,430
into the solar system uh and and really
you can argue about when you have to do

652
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:44,440
you can argue about when you have to do
 

653
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,790
you can argue about when you have to do
that but you can't credibly argue about

654
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:47,800
that but you can't credibly argue about
 

655
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,350
that but you can't credibly argue about
whether you have to do that eventually

656
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:50,360
whether you have to do that eventually
 

657
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,910
whether you have to do that eventually
we have to do that exactly well you

658
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:52,920
we have to do that exactly well you
 

659
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,749
we have to do that exactly well you
don't often talk about it but let me ask

660
00:13:54,749 --> 00:13:54,759
don't often talk about it but let me ask
 

661
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:57,269
don't often talk about it but let me ask
you on that topic about the blue ring

662
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:57,279
you on that topic about the blue ring
 

663
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,629
you on that topic about the blue ring
and the orbital Reef uh space

664
00:13:59,629 --> 00:13:59,639
and the orbital Reef uh space
 

665
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,670
and the orbital Reef uh space
infrastructure projects what's your

666
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:01,680
infrastructure projects what's your
 

667
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,230
infrastructure projects what's your
vision for these so blue ring is a very

668
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:05,240
vision for these so blue ring is a very
 

669
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,350
vision for these so blue ring is a very
interesting spacecraft that is uh

670
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:08,360
interesting spacecraft that is uh
 

671
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,269
interesting spacecraft that is uh
designed to take up to 3,000 kilograms

672
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:11,279
designed to take up to 3,000 kilograms
 

673
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,990
designed to take up to 3,000 kilograms
of payload up to geosynchronous orbit or

674
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:15,000
of payload up to geosynchronous orbit or
 

675
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,910
of payload up to geosynchronous orbit or
in lunar vicinity uh it has two

676
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:17,920
in lunar vicinity uh it has two
 

677
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,110
in lunar vicinity uh it has two
different kinds of

678
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,120
different kinds of
 

679
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,189
different kinds of
propulsion it has chemical propulsion

680
00:14:22,189 --> 00:14:22,199
propulsion it has chemical propulsion
 

681
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:25,110
propulsion it has chemical propulsion
and it has electric propulsion and so it

682
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,120
and it has electric propulsion and so it
 

683
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,749
and it has electric propulsion and so it
can you can be you can use blue ring in

684
00:14:27,749 --> 00:14:27,759
can you can be you can use blue ring in
 

685
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:30,430
can you can be you can use blue ring in
a couple different ways you can slowly

686
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:30,440
a couple different ways you can slowly
 

687
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,389
a couple different ways you can slowly
move let's say up to geosynchronous

688
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:32,399
move let's say up to geosynchronous
 

689
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,829
move let's say up to geosynchronous
orbit using electric propulsion that

690
00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:34,839
orbit using electric propulsion that
 

691
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:37,710
orbit using electric propulsion that
might take you know 100 days or 150 days

692
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:37,720
might take you know 100 days or 150 days
 

693
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,389
might take you know 100 days or 150 days
depending on how much mass you're

694
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:39,399
depending on how much mass you're
 

695
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:41,910
depending on how much mass you're
carrying uh and then and reserve your

696
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:41,920
carrying uh and then and reserve your
 

697
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,350
carrying uh and then and reserve your
chemical propulsion so that you can

698
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:43,360
chemical propulsion so that you can
 

699
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,749
chemical propulsion so that you can
change orbits quickly in geosynchronous

700
00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:45,759
change orbits quickly in geosynchronous
 

701
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,670
change orbits quickly in geosynchronous
orbit or you can use the chemical

702
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:48,680
orbit or you can use the chemical
 

703
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,430
orbit or you can use the chemical
propulsion first to quickly get up to

704
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:50,440
propulsion first to quickly get up to
 

705
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,829
propulsion first to quickly get up to
geosynchronous and then use your

706
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:51,839
geosynchronous and then use your
 

707
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,670
geosynchronous and then use your
electrical propulsion to slowly change

708
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:53,680
electrical propulsion to slowly change
 

709
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,389
electrical propulsion to slowly change
your ju synchronous orbit blue ring has

710
00:14:57,389 --> 00:14:57,399
your ju synchronous orbit blue ring has
 

711
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:59,749
your ju synchronous orbit blue ring has
um a couple of interesting features it's

712
00:14:59,749 --> 00:14:59,759
um a couple of interesting features it's
 

713
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,590
um a couple of interesting features it's
a uh it provides a lot of services to

714
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:04,600
a uh it provides a lot of services to
 

715
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,470
a uh it provides a lot of services to
these payloads so the payLo could be one

716
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:06,480
these payloads so the payLo could be one
 

717
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,509
these payloads so the payLo could be one
large payload or it can be a number of

718
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:08,519
large payload or it can be a number of
 

719
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:11,389
large payload or it can be a number of
small payloads and it provides thermal

720
00:15:11,389 --> 00:15:11,399
small payloads and it provides thermal
 

721
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,230
small payloads and it provides thermal
management it provides electric power it

722
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:14,240
management it provides electric power it
 

723
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,030
management it provides electric power it
provides uh compute um provides

724
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:18,040
provides uh compute um provides
 

725
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,030
provides uh compute um provides
Communications and so when you design a

726
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,040
Communications and so when you design a
 

727
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,829
Communications and so when you design a
payload for blue ring you don't have

728
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:23,839
payload for blue ring you don't have
 

729
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,269
payload for blue ring you don't have
it's you don't have to figure out all of

730
00:15:26,269 --> 00:15:26,279
it's you don't have to figure out all of
 

731
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,949
it's you don't have to figure out all of
those things on your own so kind of radi

732
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:28,959
those things on your own so kind of radi
 

733
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,870
those things on your own so kind of radi
tolerant compute is a complicated thing

734
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:31,880
tolerant compute is a complicated thing
 

735
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,949
tolerant compute is a complicated thing
to do and so we have a an unusually

736
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:34,959
to do and so we have a an unusually
 

737
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,110
to do and so we have a an unusually
large amount of radiation tolerant

738
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:37,120
large amount of radiation tolerant
 

739
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,949
large amount of radiation tolerant
compute on board blue ring and you can

740
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:39,959
compute on board blue ring and you can
 

741
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:41,829
compute on board blue ring and you can
your payload can just use that when it

742
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:41,839
your payload can just use that when it
 

743
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,110
your payload can just use that when it
needs to so it's a uh uh it's sort of

744
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:45,120
needs to so it's a uh uh it's sort of
 

745
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,949
needs to so it's a uh uh it's sort of
all these Services it's you know it's

746
00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:47,959
all these Services it's you know it's
 

747
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:49,829
all these Services it's you know it's
it's like a set of apis it's a little

748
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:49,839
it's like a set of apis it's a little
 

749
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,870
it's like a set of apis it's a little
bit like Amazon web services but for

750
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:52,880
bit like Amazon web services but for
 

751
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,350
bit like Amazon web services but for
face payloads that need to move about in

752
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:55,360
face payloads that need to move about in
 

753
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,949
face payloads that need to move about in
Earth vicinity or lunar vicinity uh a

754
00:15:58,949 --> 00:15:58,959
Earth vicinity or lunar vicinity uh a
 

755
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,710
Earth vicinity or lunar vicinity uh a
WSS space okay so uh so Compu in space

756
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:02,720
WSS space okay so uh so Compu in space
 

757
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,430
WSS space okay so uh so Compu in space
so you get you get a giant chemical

758
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:04,440
so you get you get a giant chemical
 

759
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,110
so you get you get a giant chemical
rocket to get a payload out to and then

760
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,120
rocket to get a payload out to and then
 

761
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,030
rocket to get a payload out to and then
you have these admins that show up this

762
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,040
you have these admins that show up this
 

763
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,910
you have these admins that show up this
blue ring uh thing that manages various

764
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:12,920
blue ring uh thing that manages various
 

765
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,350
blue ring uh thing that manages various
things like compute exactly and it can

766
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:15,360
things like compute exactly and it can
 

767
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,189
things like compute exactly and it can
it can also provide transportation and

768
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:17,199
it can also provide transportation and
 

769
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,910
it can also provide transportation and
move you around to different orbits

770
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:18,920
move you around to different orbits
 

771
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,269
move you around to different orbits
including humans you think no but blue

772
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:21,279
including humans you think no but blue
 

773
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,189
including humans you think no but blue
ring is not designed to move humans

774
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:23,199
ring is not designed to move humans
 

775
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,030
ring is not designed to move humans
around um it's designed to move payloads

776
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,040
around um it's designed to move payloads
 

777
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,949
around um it's designed to move payloads
around so we're also building a lunar

778
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:28,959
around so we're also building a lunar
 

779
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,670
around so we're also building a lunar
Lander uh which is of course designed to

780
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:32,680
Lander uh which is of course designed to
 

781
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,150
Lander uh which is of course designed to
to land humans on the surface of the

782
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:34,160
to land humans on the surface of the
 

783
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,670
to land humans on the surface of the
Moon I'm going to ask you about that

784
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:35,680
Moon I'm going to ask you about that
 

785
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,430
Moon I'm going to ask you about that
well let me let me actually just uh step

786
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:38,440
well let me let me actually just uh step
 

787
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,509
well let me let me actually just uh step
back to the old days you were at

788
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:41,519
back to the old days you were at
 

789
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,150
back to the old days you were at
Princeton uh with aspirations to be a

790
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,160
Princeton uh with aspirations to be a
 

791
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,829
Princeton uh with aspirations to be a
theoretical physicist yeah um What

792
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:47,839
theoretical physicist yeah um What
 

793
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,189
theoretical physicist yeah um What
attracted you to physics and why did you

794
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:50,199
attracted you to physics and why did you
 

795
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:53,470
attracted you to physics and why did you
change your mind and not become why why

796
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:53,480
change your mind and not become why why
 

797
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,189
change your mind and not become why why
you're not Jeff bezos's the famous

798
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:55,199
you're not Jeff bezos's the famous
 

799
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,710
you're not Jeff bezos's the famous
theoretical physicist so I loved physics

800
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:58,720
theoretical physicist so I loved physics
 

801
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,509
theoretical physicist so I loved physics
and I studied physics and computer

802
00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:00,519
and I studied physics and computer
 

803
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,509
and I studied physics and computer
science and I was proceeding along uh

804
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:03,519
science and I was proceeding along uh
 

805
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,510
science and I was proceeding along uh
along the physics path I was planning to

806
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:05,520
along the physics path I was planning to
 

807
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,949
along the physics path I was planning to
major in physics and I wanted to be a

808
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:06,959
major in physics and I wanted to be a
 

809
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,429
major in physics and I wanted to be a
theoretical physicist and I and the

810
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:09,439
theoretical physicist and I and the
 

811
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,150
theoretical physicist and I and the
computer science was sort of something I

812
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:11,160
computer science was sort of something I
 

813
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,829
computer science was sort of something I
was doing for fun I really loved

814
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:13,839
was doing for fun I really loved
 

815
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,309
was doing for fun I really loved
it um and I and I was very good at the

816
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:17,319
it um and I and I was very good at the
 

817
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,789
it um and I and I was very good at the
the programming and doing those things

818
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:18,799
the programming and doing those things
 

819
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,789
the programming and doing those things
and I enjoyed all my computer science

820
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:20,799
and I enjoyed all my computer science
 

821
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:21,870
and I enjoyed all my computer science
classes

822
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:21,880
classes
 

823
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,309
classes
immensely but I really was determined to

824
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:24,319
immensely but I really was determined to
 

825
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,189
immensely but I really was determined to
be a theoretical physicist I it's why I

826
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:27,199
be a theoretical physicist I it's why I
 

827
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,150
be a theoretical physicist I it's why I
went to Princeton in the first place it

828
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:29,160
went to Princeton in the first place it
 

829
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,669
went to Princeton in the first place it
was definitely and then I realized I was

830
00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:32,679
was definitely and then I realized I was
 

831
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:34,470
was definitely and then I realized I was
going to be a mediocre theoretical

832
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:34,480
going to be a mediocre theoretical
 

833
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,270
going to be a mediocre theoretical
physicist and there were um uh there

834
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:37,280
physicist and there were um uh there
 

835
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,830
physicist and there were um uh there
were a few people in my classes like in

836
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:39,840
were a few people in my classes like in
 

837
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,190
were a few people in my classes like in
quantum mechanics and so on who they

838
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:42,200
quantum mechanics and so on who they
 

839
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,110
quantum mechanics and so on who they
could effortlessly do things that were

840
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:45,120
could effortlessly do things that were
 

841
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,029
could effortlessly do things that were
so difficult for me and I realized like

842
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:48,039
so difficult for me and I realized like
 

843
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:49,669
so difficult for me and I realized like
you know there are a thousand ways to be

844
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:49,679
you know there are a thousand ways to be
 

845
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,710
you know there are a thousand ways to be
smart and to be a really you know

846
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:52,720
smart and to be a really you know
 

847
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,990
smart and to be a really you know
theoretical physics is not one of those

848
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,000
theoretical physics is not one of those
 

849
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,470
theoretical physics is not one of those
fields where the uh you know only the

850
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:58,480
fields where the uh you know only the
 

851
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,990
fields where the uh you know only the
top few percent actually move the State

852
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:01,000
top few percent actually move the State
 

853
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,110
top few percent actually move the State
ofthe art forward it's one of those

854
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,120
ofthe art forward it's one of those
 

855
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,350
ofthe art forward it's one of those
things where you you have to be really

856
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:05,360
things where you you have to be really
 

857
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,710
things where you you have to be really
uh just your brain has to be wired in a

858
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:07,720
uh just your brain has to be wired in a
 

859
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,750
uh just your brain has to be wired in a
certain way and there was a guy named um

860
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:10,760
certain way and there was a guy named um
 

861
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,710
certain way and there was a guy named um
one of these people who was uh convinced

862
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:13,720
one of these people who was uh convinced
 

863
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,870
one of these people who was uh convinced
me he didn't mean to convince me but

864
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:15,880
me he didn't mean to convince me but
 

865
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,950
me he didn't mean to convince me but
just by observing him he convinced me

866
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:17,960
just by observing him he convinced me
 

867
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,110
just by observing him he convinced me
that I should not try to be a

868
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:19,120
that I should not try to be a
 

869
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,669
that I should not try to be a
theoretical physicist his name was Yos

870

Santa um was from Sri Lanka and he's he
 

875
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,549
Santa um was from Sri Lanka and he's he
was one of the most brilliant people I'd

876
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:29,559
was one of the most brilliant people I'd
 

877
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:33,029
was one of the most brilliant people I'd
ever met my uh friend Joe and I were

878
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:33,039
ever met my uh friend Joe and I were
 

879
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,190
ever met my uh friend Joe and I were
working on a very difficult partial

880
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:35,200
working on a very difficult partial
 

881
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,110
working on a very difficult partial
differential equations problem set one

882
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:37,120
differential equations problem set one
 

883
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,149
differential equations problem set one
night and there was one problem that we

884
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:39,159
night and there was one problem that we
 

885
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:42,870
night and there was one problem that we
worked on for three hours MH and we made

886
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:42,880
worked on for three hours MH and we made
 

887
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,430
worked on for three hours MH and we made
no Headway what soever and we looked up

888
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:46,440
no Headway what soever and we looked up
 

889
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,350
no Headway what soever and we looked up
at each other at the same time and we

890
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:48,360
at each other at the same time and we
 

891
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,909
at each other at the same time and we
said Yos Santa so we went to Yos Santa's

892
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:50,919
said Yos Santa so we went to Yos Santa's
 

893
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:53,190
said Yos Santa so we went to Yos Santa's
dorm room yeah and he was there he was

894
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:53,200
dorm room yeah and he was there he was
 

895
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,310
dorm room yeah and he was there he was
almost always there and we said y Santo

896
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:56,320
almost always there and we said y Santo
 

897
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,950
almost always there and we said y Santo
we're having trouble solving this

898
00:18:58,950 --> 00:18:58,960
we're having trouble solving this
 

899
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,710
we're having trouble solving this
uh partial differential equation would

900
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:00,720
uh partial differential equation would
 

901
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,950
uh partial differential equation would
you mind taking a look and he said of

902
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:02,960
you mind taking a look and he said of
 

903
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,390
you mind taking a look and he said of
course by the way he was the most humble

904
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:05,400
course by the way he was the most humble
 

905
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,870
course by the way he was the most humble
most kind person and so he took our he

906
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:08,880
most kind person and so he took our he
 

907
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,029
most kind person and so he took our he
looked at our problem and he stared at

908
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:11,039
looked at our problem and he stared at
 

909
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,230
looked at our problem and he stared at
it for just a few seconds maybe 10

910
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:13,240
it for just a few seconds maybe 10
 

911
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,630
it for just a few seconds maybe 10
seconds and he said coine and I said

912
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:16,640
seconds and he said coine and I said
 

913
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,110
seconds and he said coine and I said
what do you mean yant what do you mean

914
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:18,120
what do you mean yant what do you mean
 

915
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,870
what do you mean yant what do you mean
cosine he said that's the answer and I

916
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:19,880
cosine he said that's the answer and I
 

917
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,029
cosine he said that's the answer and I
said no no no come on and he said let me

918
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:22,039
said no no no come on and he said let me
 

919
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:23,990
said no no no come on and he said let me
show you and he took out some paper and

920
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,000
show you and he took out some paper and
 

921
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,630
show you and he took out some paper and
he wrote down three pages of equations

922
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:27,640
he wrote down three pages of equations
 

923
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,630
he wrote down three pages of equations
everything came cancelled out M and the

924
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:29,640
everything came cancelled out M and the
 

925
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,430
everything came cancelled out M and the
answer was cosine and I said y Santa did

926
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:33,440
answer was cosine and I said y Santa did
 

927
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,110
answer was cosine and I said y Santa did
you do that in your head and he said oh

928
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:36,120
you do that in your head and he said oh
 

929
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,590
you do that in your head and he said oh
no that would be impossible a few years

930
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:38,600
no that would be impossible a few years
 

931
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,270
no that would be impossible a few years
ago I solved a similar problem and I

932
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:41,280
ago I solved a similar problem and I
 

933
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,549
ago I solved a similar problem and I
could map this problem onto that problem

934
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:43,559
could map this problem onto that problem
 

935
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,149
could map this problem onto that problem
and then it was immediately obvious that

936
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:45,159
and then it was immediately obvious that
 

937
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:47,950
and then it was immediately obvious that
the answer was cosine I had a few you

938
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:47,960
the answer was cosine I had a few you
 

939
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,430
the answer was cosine I had a few you
know you have an experience like that

940
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:49,440
know you have an experience like that
 

941
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,510
know you have an experience like that
you realize maybe being a theoretical

942
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:53,520
you realize maybe being a theoretical
 

943
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,710
you realize maybe being a theoretical
physicist isn't your isn't what your

944
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:56,720
physicist isn't your isn't what your
 

945
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,549
physicist isn't your isn't what your
your your what the universe wants you to

946
00:19:58,549 --> 00:19:58,559
your your what the universe wants you to
 

947
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,230
your your what the universe wants you to
be and so I switched to computer science

948
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:02,240
be and so I switched to computer science
 

949
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,950
be and so I switched to computer science
and um and you know that worked out

950
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:04,960
and um and you know that worked out
 

951
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,710
and um and you know that worked out
really well for me I enjoy I still enjoy

952
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:06,720
really well for me I enjoy I still enjoy
 

953
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,270
really well for me I enjoy I still enjoy
it today yeah there's a particular kind

954
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:08,280
it today yeah there's a particular kind
 

955
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,070
it today yeah there's a particular kind
of intuition you need to be a great

956
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,080
of intuition you need to be a great
 

957
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,190

physicist in applied to physics I think

958
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:13,200
physicist in applied to physics I think
 

959
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,630
physicist in applied to physics I think
the mathematical skill required today is

960
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:16,640
the mathematical skill required today is
 

961
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,669
the mathematical skill required today is
so high you have to be a worldclass

962
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:19,679
so high you have to be a worldclass
 

963
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,789
so high you have to be a worldclass
mathematician to be a successful

mathematician to be a successful
 

965
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:25,590
mathematician to be a successful
theoretical physicist today and it's not

966
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:25,600
theoretical physicist today and it's not
 

967
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,789
theoretical physicist today and it's not
you know it uh probably need other

00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:42,880
you have to be able to really kind of do
 

979
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,669
you have to be able to really kind of do
these kinds of thought experiments and

00:20:44,669 --> 00:20:44,679
these kinds of thought experiments and
 

981
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:46,789

putting it down on paper uh which is
 

1043
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,310
putting it down on paper uh which is
quite rigorous and

how it works if I did I would try to
 

1063
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,590
how it works if I did I would try to
explain it I know it involves lots of

people
um they feel like wandering is

1098
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:19,320
um they feel like wandering is
 

1099
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,750
um they feel like wandering is
inefficient and should you know like

1100
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:22,760
inefficient and should you know like
 

1101
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,230
inefficient and should you know like
when when I sit down at a meeting I

1102
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:26,240
when when I sit down at a meeting I
 

1103
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,070
when when I sit down at a meeting I
don't know how long the meeting is going

1104
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:28,080
don't know how long the meeting is going
 

1105
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,669
don't know how long the meeting is going
to take if we're trying to solve a

1106
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:29,679
to take if we're trying to solve a
 

1107
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,470
to take if we're trying to solve a
problem because if I did then I'd

1108
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:33,480
problem because if I did then I'd
 

1109
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,190
problem because if I did then I'd
already I i' know there's some kind of

1110
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:35,200
already I i' know there's some kind of
 

1111
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,909
already I i' know there's some kind of
straight line that we're drawing to the

1112
00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:36,919
straight line that we're drawing to the
 

1113
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:39,830
straight line that we're drawing to the
solution the reality is we may have to

1114
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:39,840
solution the reality is we may have to
 

1115
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,789
solution the reality is we may have to
wander for a long time and I do like

1116
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:42,799
wander for a long time and I do like
 

1117
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,870
wander for a long time and I do like
group invention I think there's really

1118
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:44,880
group invention I think there's really
 

1119
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,710
group invention I think there's really
nothing more fun than sitting at a

1120
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:47,720
nothing more fun than sitting at a
 

1121
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,190
nothing more fun than sitting at a
whiteboard with a a n you know a group

1122
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:50,200
whiteboard with a a n you know a group
 

1123
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,630
whiteboard with a a n you know a group
of smart people and spitballing and

1124
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:53,640
of smart people and spitballing and
 

1125
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,230
of smart people and spitballing and
coming up with new ideas and objections

1126
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:56,240
coming up with new ideas and objections
 

1127
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,470
coming up with new ideas and objections
to those ideas and then solution to the

1128
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:58,480
to those ideas and then solution to the
 

1129
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,230
to those ideas and then solution to the
objections and going back and forth so

1130
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:02,240
objections and going back and forth so
 

1131
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,630
objections and going back and forth so
like um you know sometimes you wake up

1132
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:04,640
like um you know sometimes you wake up
 

1133
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,750
like um you know sometimes you wake up
with an idea and the middle of the night

1134
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:07,760
with an idea and the middle of the night
 

1135
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,110
with an idea and the middle of the night
and sometimes you sit down with a group

1136
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:10,120
and sometimes you sit down with a group
 

1137
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,549
and sometimes you sit down with a group
of people and go back and forth and both

1138
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:12,559
of people and go back and forth and both
 

1139
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,110
of people and go back and forth and both
things are really pleasurable and when

1140
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:15,120
things are really pleasurable and when
 

1141
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,190
things are really pleasurable and when
you wander I think one key thing is to

1142
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,200
you wander I think one key thing is to
 

1143
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,390
you wander I think one key thing is to
notice a good idea and to to to maybe to

1144
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:24,400
notice a good idea and to to to maybe to
 

1145
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,230
notice a good idea and to to to maybe to
notice the kernel of a good idea maybe

1146
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:26,240
notice the kernel of a good idea maybe
 

1147
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,190
notice the kernel of a good idea maybe
pull at that string cuz I don't think uh

1148
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:29,200
pull at that string cuz I don't think uh
 

1149
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,909
pull at that string cuz I don't think uh
good ideas come fully

1150
00:24:30,909 --> 00:24:30,919
good ideas come fully
 

1151
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:35,669
good ideas come fully
formed 100% right in fact when I come up

1152
00:24:35,669 --> 00:24:35,679
formed 100% right in fact when I come up
 

1153
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,590
formed 100% right in fact when I come up
with what I think is a good idea and it

1154
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:37,600
with what I think is a good idea and it
 

1155
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,190
with what I think is a good idea and it
survives kind of the first level of

1156
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:40,200
survives kind of the first level of
 

1157
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,789
survives kind of the first level of
scrutiny you know that I do in my own

1158
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:41,799
scrutiny you know that I do in my own
 

1159
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:44,190
scrutiny you know that I do in my own
head and I'm ready to tell somebody else

1160
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:44,200
head and I'm ready to tell somebody else
 

1161
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,269
head and I'm ready to tell somebody else
about the idea I will often say look it

1162
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:47,279
about the idea I will often say look it
 

1163
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,789
about the idea I will often say look it
is going to be really easy for you to

1164
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:48,799
is going to be really easy for you to
 

1165
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,350
is going to be really easy for you to
find objections to this idea but work

1166
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:52,360
find objections to this idea but work
 

1167
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,909
find objections to this idea but work
with me there's something there there's

1168
00:24:54,909 --> 00:24:54,919
with me there's something there there's
 

1169
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:57,310
with me there's something there there's
something there and that is intuition

1170
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:57,320
something there and that is intuition
 

1171
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,630
something there and that is intuition
yeah you because it's really easy to

1172
00:24:59,630 --> 00:24:59,640
yeah you because it's really easy to
 

1173
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,870
yeah you because it's really easy to
kill new

1174
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:00,880
kill new
 

1175
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,310
kill new
ideas in the beginning because they do

1176
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:03,320
ideas in the beginning because they do
 

1177
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,269
ideas in the beginning because they do
have so many so many easy objections to

1178
00:25:06,269 --> 00:25:06,279
have so many so many easy objections to
 

1179
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:08,590
have so many so many easy objections to
them so you need to uh you need to kind

1180
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:08,600
them so you need to uh you need to kind
 

1181
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,549
them so you need to uh you need to kind
of forwarn people and say look I know

1182
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:10,559
of forwarn people and say look I know
 

1183
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,549
of forwarn people and say look I know
it's going to take a lot of work to get

1184
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:12,559
it's going to take a lot of work to get
 

1185
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,070
it's going to take a lot of work to get
this to a fully formed idea let's get

1186
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:15,080
this to a fully formed idea let's get
 

1187
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,630
this to a fully formed idea let's get
started on that it'll be fun so you got

1188
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:17,640
started on that it'll be fun so you got
 

1189
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,350
started on that it'll be fun so you got
that ability to say cosign in you

1190
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:19,360
that ability to say cosign in you
 

1191
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,990
that ability to say cosign in you
somewhere after

1192
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:21,000
somewhere after
 

1193
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,669
somewhere after
all maybe not on math in a different

1194
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:23,679
all maybe not on math in a different
 

1195
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,350
all maybe not on math in a different
domain yeah there are a thousand ways to

1196
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:26,360
domain yeah there are a thousand ways to
 

1197
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,310
domain yeah there are a thousand ways to
be smart by the way and that is a really

1198
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:29,320
be smart by the way and that is a really
 

1199
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,269
be smart by the way and that is a really
like when I go around you know and I

1200
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:32,279
like when I go around you know and I
 

1201
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,029
like when I go around you know and I
meet people I'm always looking for the

1202
00:25:34,029 --> 00:25:34,039
meet people I'm always looking for the
 

1203
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:37,230
meet people I'm always looking for the
way that they're smart and you find it

1204
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:37,240
way that they're smart and you find it
 

1205
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,950
way that they're smart and you find it
is that's one of the things that makes

1206
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:38,960
is that's one of the things that makes
 

1207
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,510
is that's one of the things that makes
the world so interesting and fun is that

1208
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:43,520
the world so interesting and fun is that
 

1209
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,870
the world so interesting and fun is that
it is not it's not like IQ is a single y

1210
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:47,880
it is not it's not like IQ is a single y
 

1211
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,430
it is not it's not like IQ is a single y
Dimension there are people who are smart

1212
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:50,440
Dimension there are people who are smart
 

1213
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,269
Dimension there are people who are smart
and so such unique ways yeah you just

1214
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:53,279
and so such unique ways yeah you just
 

1215
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,990
and so such unique ways yeah you just
gave me a good response when somebody

1216
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:55,000
gave me a good response when somebody
 

1217

gave me a good response when somebody
calls me an idiot on the internet you

1218

calls me an idiot on the internet you
 

1219
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,149
calls me an idiot on the internet you
know there's a thousand ways to be smart

1220
00:26:00,149 --> 00:26:00,159
know there's a thousand ways to be smart
 

1221
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,029

00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:20,200
combustion cycle it's a cycle that was
 

1277
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,990
combustion cycle it's a cycle that was
really pioneered by the Russians it's a

00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:22,000
really pioneered by the Russians it's a
 

1279
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,669
really pioneered by the Russians it's a
very good cycle um uh and that engine is

1280
00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:26,679
very good cycle um uh and that engine is
 

1281
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:29,269
very good cycle um uh and that engine is
also going to power the first stage of

1282
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:29,279
also going to power the first stage of
 

1283
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,789
also going to power the first stage of
the Vulcan rocket which is the United

1284
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:30,799
the Vulcan rocket which is the United
 

1285
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,029
the Vulcan rocket which is the United
launch Alliance rocket um then the

1286
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:34,039
launch Alliance rocket um then the
 

1287
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:37,110
launch Alliance rocket um then the
second stage of new Glenn uh is powered

1288
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:37,120
second stage of new Glenn uh is powered
 

1289
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,590
second stage of new Glenn uh is powered
by two b3u engines which is a upper

00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:40,600
by two b3u engines which is a upper
 

1291
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,190
by two b3u engines which is a upper
stage variant of our new Shephard liquid

1292
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:43,200
stage variant of our new Shephard liquid
 

1293
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,269

hydrogen engine so the b3u has 160,000

1294
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:47,279
hydrogen engine so the b3u has 160,000
 

1295
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,230
hydrogen engine so the b3u has 160,000
lounds of thrust so two of those 320,000

1296
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:50,240
lounds of thrust so two of those 320,000
 

1297
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,549
lounds of thrust so two of those 320,000
lounds of thrust and hydrogen is a very

1298
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:53,559
lounds of thrust and hydrogen is a very
 

1299
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:57,230
lounds of thrust and hydrogen is a very
good propellant for upper stages because

1300
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:57,240
good propellant for upper stages because
 

1301
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,870
good propellant for upper stages because
it has has very high ISP it's not a

1302
00:27:59,870 --> 00:27:59,880
it has has very high ISP it's not a
 

1303
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,870
it has has very high ISP it's not a
great propellent in my view for booster

1304
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:02,880
great propellent in my view for booster
 

1305
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,549
great propellent in my view for booster
stages because the stages then get

1306
00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:05,559
stages because the stages then get
 

1307
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:08,549
stages because the stages then get
physically so large hydrogen has very

1308
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:08,559
physically so large hydrogen has very
 

1309
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:12,950
physically so large hydrogen has very
high ISP but liquid hydrogen is uh very

1310
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:12,960
high ISP but liquid hydrogen is uh very
 

1311
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,029
high ISP but liquid hydrogen is uh very
is not dense at all so to store liquid

1312
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:16,039
is not dense at all so to store liquid
 

1313
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:17,830
is not dense at all so to store liquid
hydrogen you know if you need to store

1314
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:17,840
hydrogen you know if you need to store
 

1315
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,310
hydrogen you know if you need to store
many thousands of pounds of liquid

1316
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:19,320
many thousands of pounds of liquid
 

1317
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,990
many thousands of pounds of liquid
hydrogen your tanks your liquid hydrogen

1318
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:21,000
hydrogen your tanks your liquid hydrogen
 

1319
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,710
hydrogen your tanks your liquid hydrogen
tank it's very large so uh you really

1320
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:24,720
tank it's very large so uh you really
 

1321
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,710
tank it's very large so uh you really
you get more benefit from the higher

1322
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:26,720
you get more benefit from the higher
 

1323
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,389
you get more benefit from the higher
isps specific impulse you get more

1324
00:28:29,389 --> 00:28:29,399
isps specific impulse you get more
 

1325
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:31,549
isps specific impulse you get more
benefit from the higher specific impulse

1326
00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:31,559
benefit from the higher specific impulse
 

1327
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:32,950
benefit from the higher specific impulse
on the second

1328
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:32,960
on the second
 

1329
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,470
on the second
stage and that stage carries less

1330
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:36,480
stage and that stage carries less
 

1331
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,509
stage and that stage carries less
propellant so you don't get such

1332
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:38,519
propellant so you don't get such
 

1333
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:42,230
propellant so you don't get such
geometrically gigantic tanks the Delta 4

1334
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:42,240
geometrically gigantic tanks the Delta 4
 

1335
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,430
geometrically gigantic tanks the Delta 4
is an example of a vehicle that is all

1336
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:44,440
is an example of a vehicle that is all
 

1337
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,029

hydrogen the booster stage is also

1338
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:47,039
hydrogen the booster stage is also
 

1339
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,070
hydrogen the booster stage is also
hydrogen and I think that it's a very

1340
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:49,080
hydrogen and I think that it's a very
 

1341
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,190
hydrogen and I think that it's a very
effective vehicle but it never was very

1342
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:51,200
effective vehicle but it never was very
 

1343
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,269
effective vehicle but it never was very
cost effective um so it's operationally

1344
00:28:54,269 --> 00:28:54,279
cost effective um so it's operationally
 

1345
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:56,669
cost effective um so it's operationally
very capable but not very cost effective

1346
00:28:56,669 --> 00:28:56,679
very capable but not very cost effective
 

1347
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:00,789
very capable but not very cost effective
so size is also costly size is costly so

1348
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:00,799
so size is also costly size is costly so
 

1349
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,430
so size is also costly size is costly so
it's interesting Rockets love to be big

1350
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:03,440
it's interesting Rockets love to be big
 

1351
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,470
it's interesting Rockets love to be big
everything works better what do you mean

1352
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:05,480
everything works better what do you mean
 

1353
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,509
everything works better what do you mean
by that you've told me that before it

1354
00:29:07,509 --> 00:29:07,519
by that you've told me that before it
 

1355
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:08,950
by that you've told me that before it
sounds epic but was

1356
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:08,960
sounds epic but was
 

1357
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,269
sounds epic but was
it I mean when you look at the kind of

1358
00:29:12,269 --> 00:29:12,279
it I mean when you look at the kind of
 

1359
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:14,950
it I mean when you look at the kind of
the physics of Rocket

1360
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:14,960
the physics of Rocket
 

1361
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,269
the physics of Rocket
engines uh and also when you look at

1362
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:17,279
engines uh and also when you look at
 

1363
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,230
engines uh and also when you look at
parasitic Mass it doesn't if you have

1364
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:20,240
parasitic Mass it doesn't if you have
 

1365
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,269
parasitic Mass it doesn't if you have
let's say you have an avionic system so

1366
00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:22,279
let's say you have an avionic system so
 

1367
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:24,950
let's say you have an avionic system so
you have a guidance and control system

1368
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:24,960
you have a guidance and control system
 

1369
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,230
you have a guidance and control system
that is going to be about the same mass

1370
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:28,240
that is going to be about the same mass
 

1371
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,310
that is going to be about the same mass
and size for a giant rocket as it is

1372
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:31,320
and size for a giant rocket as it is
 

1373
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,630
and size for a giant rocket as it is
going to be for a tiny rocket and so

1374
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:34,640
going to be for a tiny rocket and so
 

1375
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,029
going to be for a tiny rocket and so
that's just pardic mass that is very

1376
00:29:38,029 --> 00:29:38,039
that's just pardic mass that is very
 

1377
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:40,310
that's just pardic mass that is very
consequential if you're building a very

1378
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:40,320
consequential if you're building a very
 

1379
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,950
consequential if you're building a very
small rocket but is Trivial if you're

1380
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:42,960
small rocket but is Trivial if you're
 

1381
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,350
small rocket but is Trivial if you're
building a very large rocket so you have

1382
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:44,360
building a very large rocket so you have
 

1383
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,430
building a very large rocket so you have
the parasitic Mass thing and then if you

1384
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:46,440
the parasitic Mass thing and then if you
 

1385
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,549
the parasitic Mass thing and then if you
look at for example rocket engines have

1386
00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:49,559
look at for example rocket engines have
 

1387
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:51,750
look at for example rocket engines have
turbo pumps they have to pressurize the

1388
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:51,760
turbo pumps they have to pressurize the
 

1389
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,509
turbo pumps they have to pressurize the
fuel and the oxidizer up to a very high

1390
00:29:54,509 --> 00:29:54,519
fuel and the oxidizer up to a very high
 

1391
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:56,990
fuel and the oxidizer up to a very high
pressure level in order to inject it

1392
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:57,000
pressure level in order to inject it
 

1393
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,950
pressure level in order to inject it
into to the thrust chamber where it

1394
00:29:58,950 --> 00:29:58,960
into to the thrust chamber where it
 

1395
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,789
into to the thrust chamber where it
burns and those pumps all rotating

1396
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:02,799
burns and those pumps all rotating
 

1397
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,269
burns and those pumps all rotating
machines in fact get more efficient as

1398
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:05,279
machines in fact get more efficient as
 

1399
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:09,070
machines in fact get more efficient as
they get larger so really tiny turbo

1400
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:09,080
they get larger so really tiny turbo
 

1401
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,029
they get larger so really tiny turbo
pumps are very challenging to

1402
00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:12,039
pumps are very challenging to
 

1403
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:15,190
pumps are very challenging to
manufacturer and any kind of gaps you

1404
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:15,200
manufacturer and any kind of gaps you
 

1405
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,830
manufacturer and any kind of gaps you
know uh are like between the housing for

1406
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:18,840
know uh are like between the housing for
 

1407
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,710
know uh are like between the housing for
example and the rotating impeller that

1408
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:21,720
example and the rotating impeller that
 

1409
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,470
example and the rotating impeller that
pressurizes the fuel there has to be

1410
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:23,480
pressurizes the fuel there has to be
 

1411
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,990
pressurizes the fuel there has to be
some Gap there you can't have those

1412
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:25,000
some Gap there you can't have those
 

1413
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,669
some Gap there you can't have those
parts scraping against one another and

1414
00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:27,679
parts scraping against one another and
 

1415
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,110
parts scraping against one another and
those gaps drive

1416
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:30,120
those gaps drive
 

1417
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,110
those gaps drive
inefficiencies and so you know if you

1418
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:32,120
inefficiencies and so you know if you
 

1419
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,990
inefficiencies and so you know if you
have a very large turbo pump those gaps

1420
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:36,000
have a very large turbo pump those gaps
 

1421
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,789
have a very large turbo pump those gaps
and percentage terms end up being very

1422
00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:38,799
and percentage terms end up being very
 

1423
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,870
and percentage terms end up being very
small and so there's a bunch of things

1424
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:41,880
small and so there's a bunch of things
 

1425
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,750
small and so there's a bunch of things
that that you end up loving about having

1426
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:44,760
that that you end up loving about having
 

1427
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,669
that that you end up loving about having
a large rocket and that you end up

1428
00:30:46,669 --> 00:30:46,679
a large rocket and that you end up
 

1429
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:49,029
a large rocket and that you end up
hating for a small rocket but there's a

1430
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:49,039
hating for a small rocket but there's a
 

1431
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,269
hating for a small rocket but there's a
giant exception to this Rule and it is

1432
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:52,279
giant exception to this Rule and it is
 

1433
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:55,269
giant exception to this Rule and it is
manufacturing so manufacturing large

1434
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:55,279
manufacturing so manufacturing large
 

1435
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,029
manufacturing so manufacturing large
structures is very very challenging it's

1436
00:30:58,029 --> 00:30:58,039
structures is very very challenging it's
 

1437
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:00,590
structures is very very challenging it's
a pain in the butt and so you know it's

1438
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:00,600
a pain in the butt and so you know it's
 

1439
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,029
a pain in the butt and so you know it's
just you know if you have if you're

1440
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:02,039
just you know if you have if you're
 

1441
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:03,470
just you know if you have if you're
making a small rocket engine you can

1442
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:03,480
making a small rocket engine you can
 

1443
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,950
making a small rocket engine you can
move all the pieces by hand you can

1444
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:04,960
move all the pieces by hand you can
 

1445
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,549
move all the pieces by hand you can
assemble it on a table one person can do

1446
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:07,559
assemble it on a table one person can do
 

1447
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:10,669
assemble it on a table one person can do
it um you know you don't need cranes and

1448
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:10,679
it um you know you don't need cranes and
 

1449
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:13,710
it um you know you don't need cranes and
heavy lift operations and tooling and so

1450
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:13,720
heavy lift operations and tooling and so
 

1451
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,590
heavy lift operations and tooling and so
on and so on when you start building big

1452
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:16,600
on and so on when you start building big
 

1453
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,509
on and so on when you start building big
objects infrastructure civil

1454
00:31:19,509 --> 00:31:19,519
objects infrastructure civil
 

1455
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,830
objects infrastructure civil
infrastructure just like the launch pad

1456
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:21,840
infrastructure just like the launch pad
 

1457
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,590
infrastructure just like the launch pad
and the you know all this we we went and

1458
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:23,600
and the you know all this we we went and
 

1459
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,950
and the you know all this we we went and
visited I took you to the launch pad and

1460
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:25,960
visited I took you to the launch pad and
 

1461
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,029
visited I took you to the launch pad and
you can see it's so Monument mental yeah

1462
00:31:28,029 --> 00:31:28,039
you can see it's so Monument mental yeah
 

1463
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:30,990
you can see it's so Monument mental yeah
it um and so just these things become

1464
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:31,000
it um and so just these things become
 

1465
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,509
it um and so just these things become
major uh undertakings both from an

1466
00:31:33,509 --> 00:31:33,519
major uh undertakings both from an
 

1467
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,870
major uh undertakings both from an
engineering point of view but also from

1468
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:35,880
engineering point of view but also from
 

1469
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,789
engineering point of view but also from
a construction and cost point of view

1470
00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:37,799
a construction and cost point of view
 

1471
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:39,509
a construction and cost point of view
and even the uh the foundation of the

1472
00:31:39,509 --> 00:31:39,519
and even the uh the foundation of the
 

1473
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,950
and even the uh the foundation of the
Launchpad I mean this is Florida like

1474
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:41,960
Launchpad I mean this is Florida like
 

1475
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,029
Launchpad I mean this is Florida like
isn't it like swamp land like how deep

1476
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:44,039
isn't it like swamp land like how deep
 

1477
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:46,750
isn't it like swamp land like how deep
go you have at Cape Canaveral yeah um in

1478
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:46,760
go you have at Cape Canaveral yeah um in
 

1479
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,549
go you have at Cape Canaveral yeah um in
fact most ocean you know most launchpads

1480
00:31:49,549 --> 00:31:49,559
fact most ocean you know most launchpads
 

1481
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:52,190
fact most ocean you know most launchpads
are on beaches somewhere on the oceans

1482
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:52,200
are on beaches somewhere on the oceans
 

1483
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,590
are on beaches somewhere on the oceans
side because you want to launch over

1484
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:53,600
side because you want to launch over
 

1485
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,310
side because you want to launch over
water for safety reasons um the uh yes

1486
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:58,320
water for safety reasons um the uh yes
 

1487
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,310
water for safety reasons um the uh yes
you have to drive pilings you know

1488
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:01,320
you have to drive pilings you know
 

1489
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,029
you have to drive pilings you know
dozens and dozens and dozens of pilings

1490
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:04,039
dozens and dozens and dozens of pilings
 

1491
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:08,070
dozens and dozens and dozens of pilings
you know 50 100 150 ft deep to get

1492
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:08,080
you know 50 100 150 ft deep to get
 

1493
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,669
you know 50 100 150 ft deep to get
enough structural Integrity for these

1494
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:09,679
enough structural Integrity for these
 

1495
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,070
enough structural Integrity for these
very large you know it's it's uh yes

1496
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:12,080
very large you know it's it's uh yes
 

1497
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,070
very large you know it's it's uh yes
these turned into major civil

1498
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:14,080
these turned into major civil
 

1499
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,029
these turned into major civil
engineering projects I just have to say

1500
00:32:16,029 --> 00:32:16,039
engineering projects I just have to say
 

1501
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:18,029
engineering projects I just have to say
everything about that factory is pretty

1502
00:32:18,029 --> 00:32:18,039
everything about that factory is pretty
 

1503
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:20,350
everything about that factory is pretty
badass you said tooling the bigger it

1504
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:20,360
badass you said tooling the bigger it
 

1505
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,710
badass you said tooling the bigger it
gets the more the more epic it is it

1506
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:22,720
gets the more the more epic it is it
 

1507
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,789
gets the more the more epic it is it
does make it epic it's fun to look at

1508
00:32:24,789 --> 00:32:24,799
does make it epic it's fun to look at
 

1509
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,230
does make it epic it's fun to look at
it's extraordinary it's humbling also

1510
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:27,240
it's extraordinary it's humbling also
 

1511
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,269
it's extraordinary it's humbling also
cuz your humans are so small compared to

1512
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:29,279
cuz your humans are so small compared to
 

1513
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,389
cuz your humans are so small compared to
it we are building these enormous

1514
00:32:32,389 --> 00:32:32,399
it we are building these enormous
 

1515
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,190
it we are building these enormous
machines that are harnessing enormous

1516
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:35,200
machines that are harnessing enormous
 

1517
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,149
machines that are harnessing enormous
amounts of uh chemical uh Power um you

1518
00:32:40,149 --> 00:32:40,159
amounts of uh chemical uh Power um you
 

1519
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,070
amounts of uh chemical uh Power um you
know in very very compact packages it's

1520
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:43,080
know in very very compact packages it's
 

1521
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,870
know in very very compact packages it's
truly extraordinary but then there's all

1522
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:44,880
truly extraordinary but then there's all
 

1523
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,750
truly extraordinary but then there's all
the different components uh and you you

1524
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:47,760
the different components uh and you you
 

1525
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,070
the different components uh and you you
know the materials involved is there

1526
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:50,080
know the materials involved is there
 

1527
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,629
know the materials involved is there
something interesting that's you can

1528
00:32:51,629 --> 00:32:51,639
something interesting that's you can
 

1529
00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:53,950
something interesting that's you can
describe about the

1530
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:53,960
describe about the
 

1531
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,269
describe about the
materials uh that comprise the rocket so

1532
00:32:57,269 --> 00:32:57,279
materials uh that comprise the rocket so
 

1533
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,230
materials uh that comprise the rocket so
it has to be as light as possible I

1534
00:32:59,230 --> 00:32:59,240
it has to be as light as possible I
 

1535
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,590
it has to be as light as possible I
guess whilst withstanding the Heat and

1536
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:01,600
guess whilst withstanding the Heat and
 

1537
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,070
guess whilst withstanding the Heat and
the harsh conditions yeah I play a

1538
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:04,080
the harsh conditions yeah I play a
 

1539
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,830
the harsh conditions yeah I play a
little kind of game sometimes with other

1540
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:06,840
little kind of game sometimes with other
 

1541
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,549
little kind of game sometimes with other
rocket people that I run into where say

1542
00:33:09,549 --> 00:33:09,559
rocket people that I run into where say
 

1543
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:11,990
rocket people that I run into where say
what are the things that would Amaze the

1544
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:12,000
what are the things that would Amaze the
 

1545
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,350
what are the things that would Amaze the
1960s Engineers like what what's changed

1546
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:15,360
1960s Engineers like what what's changed
 

1547
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,909
1960s Engineers like what what's changed
cuz surprisingly some of Rocket tre's

1548
00:33:17,909 --> 00:33:17,919
cuz surprisingly some of Rocket tre's
 

1549
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,230
cuz surprisingly some of Rocket tre's
Greatest Hits have not changed they are

1550
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:20,240
Greatest Hits have not changed they are
 

1551
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,750
Greatest Hits have not changed they are
still they would recognize immediately a

1552
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:22,760
still they would recognize immediately a
 

1553
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,950
still they would recognize immediately a
lot of what we do today and it's exactly

1554
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:24,960
lot of what we do today and it's exactly
 

1555
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,029
lot of what we do today and it's exactly
what they pioneered back in the 60s but

1557
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:31,230
what they pioneered back in the 60s but
a few things have changed um uh you know

1558
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:31,240
a few things have changed um uh you know
 

1559
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:35,669
a few things have changed um uh you know
the use of carbon composits is is very

1560
00:33:35,669 --> 00:33:35,679
the use of carbon composits is is very
 

1561
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,350
the use of carbon composits is is very
different today um you know we can build

1562
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:38,360
different today um you know we can build
 

1563
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,269
different today um you know we can build
very sophisticated you saw our carbon

1564
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:41,279
very sophisticated you saw our carbon
 

1565
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,190

remarkable technology it was invented
 

1595
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,069
remarkable technology it was invented
decades ago but has become very

00:34:26,069 --> 00:34:26,079
decades ago but has become very
 

1597
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,869

practical over the just the last couple
 

1599
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:31,990
practical over the just the last couple
of decades and instead of using heat to

weld two pieces of metal together it
 

1603
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,829
weld two pieces of metal together it
literally stirs the two pieces there's a

00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:37,839
literally stirs the two pieces there's a
 

1605
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,069
literally stirs the two pieces there's a
a pin that rotates at a certain rate and

1606
00:34:41,069 --> 00:34:41,079
a pin that rotates at a certain rate and
 

1607
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,589
a pin that rotates at a certain rate and
you put that pin between the two plates

1608
00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:43,599
you put that pin between the two plates
 

1609
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,990
you put that pin between the two plates
of metal that you want to weld together

of metal that you want to weld together
 

1611
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,349
of metal that you want to weld together
and then you move it at a at a very

00:34:48,349 --> 00:34:48,359
and then you move it at a at a very
 

1613
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:52,349
and then you move it at a at a very
precise speed um and instead of heating

00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:52,359
precise speed um and instead of heating
 

1615
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:53,869

after welding with stir friction welding
 

1623
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,430
after welding with stir friction welding
you can touch the material and it's just

00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:00,440
you can touch the material and it's just
 

1625
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,589
you can touch the material and it's just
barely warm um it's it literally stir

00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,349
underlying strength characteristics of
the material are you end up with weak

the material are you end up with weak
 

1645
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:25,150
the material are you end up with weak
regions where you weld and with Fric and

regions where you weld and with Fric and
 

1647
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,829
regions where you weld and with Fric and
stir welding the weld are just as strong

00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:27,839
stir welding the weld are just as strong
 

1649
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:31,190
stir welding the weld are just as strong
as the bulk material so it really allows

1653
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,109
you and so because when you're you know
let's say you're building a tank that

1654
00:35:34,109 --> 00:35:34,119
let's say you're building a tank that
 

1655
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:35,990
let's say you're building a tank that
you're going to pressurize you know a

00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:36,000
you're going to pressurize you know a
 

1657
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,270
you're going to pressurize you know a

1663
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:44,510
example you know if you are welding that
with traditional methods you have to

1664
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:44,520
with traditional methods you have to
 

1665
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,870
with traditional methods you have to
size those weld lands the thickness of

1666
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:46,880
size those weld lands the thickness of
 

1667

whatever damage you're doing with the
 

1671
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:52,069
whatever damage you're doing with the
Weld and that's going to add a lot of

1672
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:52,079
Weld and that's going to add a lot of
 

1673
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,430
Weld and that's going to add a lot of
weight to that tank I mean even just uh

1674
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:55,440
weight to that tank I mean even just uh

looking at the fairings the result of

1676
00:35:57,109 --> 00:35:57,119
looking at the fairings the result of
 

1677
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,670
looking at the fairings the result of
that the the complex shape that it takes

1678
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:00,680
that the the complex shape that it takes
 

1679
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,829
that the the complex shape that it takes
and yeah and like what it's supposed to

1680
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:02,839
and yeah and like what it's supposed to
 

1681
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:05,430
and yeah and like what it's supposed to
do is is kind of incredible CU so people

1682
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:05,440
do is is kind of incredible CU so people
 

1683
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,630
do is is kind of incredible CU so people
don't know it's on top of the rocket

1684
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:06,640
don't know it's on top of the rocket
 

1685
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,550
don't know it's on top of the rocket
it's going to fall apart that's its task

1686
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:09,560
it's going to fall apart that's its task
 

1687
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,030
it's going to fall apart that's its task
but it has to stay strong sometimes yes

1688
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:12,040
but it has to stay strong sometimes yes
 

1689
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,910
but it has to stay strong sometimes yes
and then uh disappear when it needs to

1690
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:14,920
and then uh disappear when it needs to
 

1691
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,670
and then uh disappear when it needs to
that's right which is a very difficult

1692
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:16,680
that's right which is a very difficult
 

1693
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,309
that's right which is a very difficult
task yes when you need something that

1694
00:36:19,309 --> 00:36:19,319
task yes when you need something that
 

1695
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:22,829
task yes when you need something that
needs to have 100% integrity and tell it

1696
00:36:22,829 --> 00:36:22,839
needs to have 100% integrity and tell it
 

1697
00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:25,870
needs to have 100% integrity and tell it
needs to have 0% Integrity it needs to

1698
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:25,880
needs to have 0% Integrity it needs to
 

1699
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,829
needs to have 0% Integrity it needs to
stay attached until it's ready to go

1700
00:36:27,829 --> 00:36:27,839
stay attached until it's ready to go
 

1701
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,109
stay attached until it's ready to go
away and then when it goes away it has

1702
00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:29,119
away and then when it goes away it has
 

1703
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,270
away and then when it goes away it has
to go away completely you use explosive

1704
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:32,280
to go away completely you use explosive
 

1705
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,430
to go away completely you use explosive
charges for that and so it's a very

1706
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:35,440
charges for that and so it's a very
 

1707
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,190
charges for that and so it's a very
robust way of separating

1708
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:38,200
robust way of separating
 

1709
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,309
robust way of separating
structure uh when you need to exploding

1710
00:36:41,309 --> 00:36:41,319
structure uh when you need to exploding
 

1711
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:44,309
structure uh when you need to exploding
yeah a little tiny bits of explosive

1712
00:36:44,309 --> 00:36:44,319
yeah a little tiny bits of explosive
 

1713
00:36:44,319 --> 00:36:48,390
yeah a little tiny bits of explosive
material um and uh it just it'll sever

1714
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:48,400
material um and uh it just it'll sever
 

1715
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,870
material um and uh it just it'll sever
the whole connection so if you want to

1716
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:50,880
the whole connection so if you want to
 

1717
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,829
the whole connection so if you want to
go from 100% structural Integrity To

1718
00:36:54,829 --> 00:36:54,839
go from 100% structural Integrity To
 

1719
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:57,349
go from 100% structural Integrity To
Zero as fast as possible possible is

1720
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:57,359
Zero as fast as possible possible is
 

1721
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:58,829
Zero as fast as possible possible is
explosives use

1722
00:36:58,829 --> 00:36:58,839
explosives use
 

1723
00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:01,030
explosives use
explosives the entirety of this thing is

1724
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:01,040
explosives the entirety of this thing is
 

1725
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,190
explosives the entirety of this thing is
so badass okay so we're back to the two

1726
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:03,200
so badass okay so we're back to the two
 

1727
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,309
so badass okay so we're back to the two
stages so the the first stage is

1728
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:05,319
stages so the the first stage is
 

1729
00:37:05,319 --> 00:37:08,750
stages so the the first stage is
reusable yeah second stage is Expendable

1730
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:08,760
reusable yeah second stage is Expendable
 

1731
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,790
reusable yeah second stage is Expendable
second stage is liquid hydrogen liquid

1732
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:10,800
second stage is liquid hydrogen liquid
 

1733
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,630
second stage is liquid hydrogen liquid
oxygen so we get take advantage of the

1734
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:12,640
oxygen so we get take advantage of the
 

1735
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,190
oxygen so we get take advantage of the
higher specific impulse um the uh the

1736
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:16,200
higher specific impulse um the uh the
 

1737
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,710
higher specific impulse um the uh the
first stage uh lands downrange on a

1738
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:19,720
first stage uh lands downrange on a
 

1739
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,550
first stage uh lands downrange on a
landing platform in the ocean um comes

1740
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:22,560
landing platform in the ocean um comes
 

1741
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,150
landing platform in the ocean um comes
back for maintenance and get ready to do

1742
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:25,160
back for maintenance and get ready to do
 

1743
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,630
back for maintenance and get ready to do
the next mission um I mean there's a

1744
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:27,640
the next mission um I mean there's a
 

1745
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,710
the next mission um I mean there's a
million questions but also is there a a

1746
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:29,720
million questions but also is there a a
 

1747
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,710
million questions but also is there a a
path towards reusability for the second

1748
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:31,720
path towards reusability for the second
 

1749
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,550
path towards reusability for the second
stage there is and we know how to do

1750
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:34,560
stage there is and we know how to do
 

1751
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,390
stage there is and we know how to do
that um right now I we're going to work

1752
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:37,400
that um right now I we're going to work
 

1753
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,870
that um right now I we're going to work
on manufacturing that second stage to

1754
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:39,880
on manufacturing that second stage to
 

1755
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,990
on manufacturing that second stage to
make it as inexpensive as possible sort

1756
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:43,000
make it as inexpensive as possible sort
 

1757
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,470
make it as inexpensive as possible sort
of two paths for a second stage make it

1758
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:46,480
of two paths for a second stage make it
 

1759
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,150
of two paths for a second stage make it
reusable um uh or work really hard to

1760
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:50,160
reusable um uh or work really hard to
 

1761
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,550
reusable um uh or work really hard to
make it inexpensive so you can afford to

1762
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:52,560
make it inexpensive so you can afford to
 

1763
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:57,270
make it inexpensive so you can afford to
expend it and th that trade is

1764
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:57,280
expend it and th that trade is
 

1765
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,670
expend it and th that trade is
actually not obvious which one is better

1766
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:00,680
actually not obvious which one is better
 

1767
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,470
actually not obvious which one is better
even in terms of cost even like time

1768
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:02,480
even in terms of cost even like time
 

1769
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,829
even in terms of cost even like time
even in terms of I'm talking about cost

1770
00:38:04,829 --> 00:38:04,839
even in terms of I'm talking about cost
 

1771
00:38:04,839 --> 00:38:07,309
even in terms of I'm talking about cost
is you know space flight getting into

1772
00:38:07,309 --> 00:38:07,319
is you know space flight getting into
 

1773
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:09,270
is you know space flight getting into
orbit is a solved problem we solved it

1774
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:09,280
orbit is a solved problem we solved it
 

1775
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,630
orbit is a solved problem we solved it
back in you know the 50s and 60s you're

1776
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:11,640
back in you know the 50s and 60s you're
 

1777
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,710
back in you know the 50s and 60s you're
making it Sol easy the only thing that

1778
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:13,720
making it Sol easy the only thing that
 

1779
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,270
making it Sol easy the only thing that
the only interesting problem is

1780
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:15,280
the only interesting problem is
 

1781
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,390
the only interesting problem is
dramatically reducing the cost of access

1782
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:18,400
dramatically reducing the cost of access
 

1783
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,190
dramatically reducing the cost of access
to

1784
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:19,200
to
 

1785
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,030
to
orbit which is if you can do that you

1786
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:22,040
orbit which is if you can do that you
 

1787
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,910
orbit which is if you can do that you
open up a bunch of

1788
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:23,920
open up a bunch of
 

1789
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,190
open up a bunch of
new uh you know Endeavors that lots of

1790
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:27,200
new uh you know Endeavors that lots of
 

1791
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,790
new uh you know Endeavors that lots of
startup companies everybody else can do

1792
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:28,800
startup companies everybody else can do
 

1793
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,270
startup companies everybody else can do
so that's we really that's our one of

1794
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:32,280
so that's we really that's our one of
 

1795
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,309
so that's we really that's our one of
our missions is to you know be part of

1796
00:38:35,309 --> 00:38:35,319
our missions is to you know be part of
 

1797
00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:37,270
our missions is to you know be part of
this industry and lower the cost to

1798
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:37,280
this industry and lower the cost to
 

1799
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,589
this industry and lower the cost to
orbit so that there can be you know a

1800
00:38:40,589 --> 00:38:40,599
orbit so that there can be you know a
 

1801
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:44,150
orbit so that there can be you know a
kind of a Renaissance uh a golden age of

1802
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:44,160
kind of a Renaissance uh a golden age of
 

1803
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,950
kind of a Renaissance uh a golden age of
people doing all kinds of interesting

1804
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:45,960
people doing all kinds of interesting
 

1805
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,270
people doing all kinds of interesting
things in space I like how you said uh

1806
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:48,280
things in space I like how you said uh
 

1807
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,829
things in space I like how you said uh
getting to orbit is a solved problem

1808
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:50,839
getting to orbit is a solved problem
 

1809
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:52,630
getting to orbit is a solved problem
it's just the only interesting thing is

1810
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:52,640
it's just the only interesting thing is
 

1811
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,349
it's just the only interesting thing is
reducing the C you know you can describe

1812
00:38:54,349 --> 00:38:54,359
reducing the C you know you can describe
 

1813
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:55,670
reducing the C you know you can describe
every single problem facing human

1814
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:55,680
every single problem facing human
 

1815
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,910
every single problem facing human
civilization that way way the physicist

1816
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:57,920
civilization that way way the physicist
 

1817
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,670
civilization that way way the physicist
would say everything is a solved problem

1818
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:00,680
would say everything is a solved problem
 

1819
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,910
would say everything is a solved problem
we've solved everything the rest is just

1820
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:02,920
we've solved everything the rest is just
 

1821
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,270
we've solved everything the rest is just
uh what the ruford said that it's just

1822
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:05,280
uh what the ruford said that it's just
 

1823
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,870
uh what the ruford said that it's just
stamp collecting it's just the detail

1824
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:07,880
stamp collecting it's just the detail
 

1825
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,430
stamp collecting it's just the detail
some of the greatest Innovations and

1826
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:09,440
some of the greatest Innovations and
 

1827
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,870
some of the greatest Innovations and
inventions and you know Brilliance is uh

1828
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:12,880
inventions and you know Brilliance is uh
 

1829
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,270
inventions and you know Brilliance is uh
in that cost reduction stage right and

1830
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:15,280
in that cost reduction stage right and
 

1831
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,150
in that cost reduction stage right and
you you've had a long career of cost

1832
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:17,160
you you've had a long career of cost
 

1833
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,829
you you've had a long career of cost
reduction for sure and if you know when

1834
00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:19,839
reduction for sure and if you know when
 

1835
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,550
reduction for sure and if you know when
you what does cost reduction really mean

1836
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:22,560
you what does cost reduction really mean
 

1837
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,870
you what does cost reduction really mean
it means inventing a better way yeah

1838
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:24,880
it means inventing a better way yeah
 

1839
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,470
it means inventing a better way yeah
exactly right and when you invent a

1840
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:26,480
exactly right and when you invent a
 

1841
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,950
exactly right and when you invent a
better way you make the whole world

1842
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:27,960
better way you make the whole world
 

1843
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,349
better way you make the whole world
richer so you know whatever it was I

1844
00:39:30,349 --> 00:39:30,359
richer so you know whatever it was I
 

1845
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:31,710
richer so you know whatever it was I
don't know how many thousands of years

1846
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:31,720
don't know how many thousands of years
 

1847
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,430
don't know how many thousands of years
ago somebody invented the plow and when

1848
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:34,440
ago somebody invented the plow and when
 

1849
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,230
ago somebody invented the plow and when
they invented the plow they made the

1850
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:36,240
they invented the plow they made the
 

1851
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,870
they invented the plow they made the
whole world richer because they made

1852
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:37,880
whole world richer because they made
 

1853
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,390
whole world richer because they made
farming less

1854
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:39,400
farming less
 

1855
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,750
farming less
expensive um and so it it is a big deal

1856
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:43,760
expensive um and so it it is a big deal
 

1857
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,309
expensive um and so it it is a big deal
to to invent better ways that's how the

1858
00:39:46,309 --> 00:39:46,319
to to invent better ways that's how the
 

1859
00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:47,430
to to invent better ways that's how the
world gets

1860
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:47,440
world gets
 

1861
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,470
world gets
richer so uh what are some of the the

1862
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:50,480
richer so uh what are some of the the
 

1863
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,270
richer so uh what are some of the the
biggest challenges on the manufacturing

1864
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:53,280
biggest challenges on the manufacturing
 

1865
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,390
biggest challenges on the manufacturing

first launch of new Glenn the first

1870
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:01,680
first launch of new Glenn the first
 

1871
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,030
first launch of new Glenn the first
launch is one thing we and we'll do that

1872
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:04,040
launch is one thing we and we'll do that
 

1873
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,030
launch is one thing we and we'll do that
in 20124 coming up in this coming year

1874
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:07,040
in 20124 coming up in this coming year
 

1875
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,910
in 20124 coming up in this coming year
the real thing that's the bigger

1876
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:08,920
the real thing that's the bigger
 

1877
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,750
the real thing that's the bigger
challenge is making sure that our

1878
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:11,760
challenge is making sure that our
 

1879
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,750
challenge is making sure that our
Factory is efficiently uh uh

1880
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:15,760
Factory is efficiently uh uh
 

1881
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,870
Factory is efficiently uh uh
manufacturing at rate so rate production

1882
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:19,880
manufacturing at rate so rate production
 

1883
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,910
manufacturing at rate so rate production
so consider if you want to launch new

1884
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:22,920
so consider if you want to launch new
 

1885
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,150
so consider if you want to launch new
Glenn you know 24 times a year you need

1886
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:26,160
Glenn you know 24 times a year you need
 

1887
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,470
Glenn you know 24 times a year you need
to

1888
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:27,480
to
 

1889
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,230
to
manufacture a upper stage since they're

1890
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:31,240
manufacture a upper stage since they're
 

1891
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,510

Expendable uh every you know twice a

1892
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:34,520
Expendable uh every you know twice a
 

1893
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,190
Expendable uh every you know twice a
month you need to do one every two weeks

1894
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:36,200
month you need to do one every two weeks
 

1895
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,950
month you need to do one every two weeks
so you need to be you need to have all

1896
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:37,960
so you need to be you need to have all
 

1897
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,230
so you need to be you need to have all
of your manufacturing facilities and

1898
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:41,240
of your manufacturing facilities and
 

1899
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,550
of your manufacturing facilities and
processes and inspection techniques and

1900
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:43,560
processes and inspection techniques and
 

1901
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,829
processes and inspection techniques and
acceptance tests and everything

1902
00:40:45,829 --> 00:40:45,839
acceptance tests and everything
 

1903
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:49,710
acceptance tests and everything
operating at rate and rate manufacturing

1904
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:49,720
operating at rate and rate manufacturing
 

1905
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,270
operating at rate and rate manufacturing
is at least as difficult

1906
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:52,280
is at least as difficult
 

1907
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,910
is at least as difficult
as designing the vehicle in the first

1908
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:54,920
as designing the vehicle in the first
 

1909
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,589
as designing the vehicle in the first
place and the same thing so every every

1910
00:40:58,589 --> 00:40:58,599
place and the same thing so every every
 

1911
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:03,349
place and the same thing so every every
uh uh upper stage has two b3u engines so

1912
00:41:03,349 --> 00:41:03,359
uh uh upper stage has two b3u engines so
 

1913
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,510
uh uh upper stage has two b3u engines so
those engines you know you need if

1914
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:05,520
those engines you know you need if
 

1915
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,910
those engines you know you need if
you're going to launch this the vehicle

1916
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:07,920
you're going to launch this the vehicle
 

1917
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,470
you're going to launch this the vehicle
twice a month you need four engines a

1918
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:09,480
twice a month you need four engines a
 

1919
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,550
twice a month you need four engines a
month so you need an engine every week

1920
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:11,560
month so you need an engine every week
 

1921
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,710
month so you need an engine every week
so you need to be that engine needs to

1922
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:13,720
so you need to be that engine needs to
 

1923
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,589
so you need to be that engine needs to
be being produced at rate and and that's

1924
00:41:17,589 --> 00:41:17,599
be being produced at rate and and that's
 

1925
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,790
be being produced at rate and and that's
a um and there's all the things that you

1926
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:19,800
a um and there's all the things that you
 

1927
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,589
a um and there's all the things that you
need to do that all the right Machine

1928
00:41:21,589 --> 00:41:21,599
need to do that all the right Machine
 

1929
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,510
need to do that all the right Machine
Tools all the right fixtures uh the

1930
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:24,520
Tools all the right fixtures uh the
 

1931
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,990
Tools all the right fixtures uh the
right people process Etc

1932
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:27,000
right people process Etc
 

1933
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,670
right people process Etc
so it's one thing to build a first

1934
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:29,680
so it's one thing to build a first
 

1935
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,870
so it's one thing to build a first
article right so that's you know we to

1936
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:32,880
article right so that's you know we to
 

1937
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,030
article right so that's you know we to
launch new Glenn for the first time you

1938
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:35,040
launch new Glenn for the first time you
 

1939
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,829
launch new Glenn for the first time you
need to produce a first article but

1940
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:37,839
need to produce a first article but
 

1941
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,670
need to produce a first article but
that's not the hard part the hard part

1942
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:40,680
that's not the hard part the hard part
 

1943
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,990
that's not the hard part the hard part
is everything that's going on behind the

1944
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:43,000
is everything that's going on behind the
 

1945
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,710
is everything that's going on behind the
scenes to build a factory that can

1946
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:45,720
scenes to build a factory that can
 

1947
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,069
scenes to build a factory that can
produce new glends at rate so the first

1948
00:41:48,069 --> 00:41:48,079
produce new glends at rate so the first
 

1949
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,750
produce new glends at rate so the first
one is produced in a way that's enables

1950
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:50,760
one is produced in a way that's enables
 

1951
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,069
one is produced in a way that's enables
the production of the second third and

1952
00:41:52,069 --> 00:41:52,079
the production of the second third and
 

1953
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,270
the production of the second third and
the fourth and the fifth and sixth you

1954
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:53,280
the fourth and the fifth and sixth you
 

1955
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,990
the fourth and the fifth and sixth you
could think of the first article as kind

1956
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:56,000
could think of the first article as kind
 

1957
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,030
could think of the first article as kind
of pushing it it pushes all of the rate

1958
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:00,040
of pushing it it pushes all of the rate
 

1959
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,589
of pushing it it pushes all of the rate
manufacturing uh technology along you

1960
00:42:02,589 --> 00:42:02,599
manufacturing uh technology along you
 

1961
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:06,150
manufacturing uh technology along you
know in other words it's kind of the uh

1962
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:06,160
know in other words it's kind of the uh
 

1963
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,030
know in other words it's kind of the uh
you know it's the test article in a way

1964
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:09,040
you know it's the test article in a way
 

1965
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,950
you know it's the test article in a way
that's testing out your your

1966
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:10,960
that's testing out your your
 

1967
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,270
that's testing out your your
Manufacturing Technologies the

1968
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:13,280
Manufacturing Technologies the
 

1969
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,230
Manufacturing Technologies the
manufacturing is the Big Challenge yes I

1970
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:16,240
manufacturing is the Big Challenge yes I
 

1971
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,790
manufacturing is the Big Challenge yes I
mean I don't want to make it sound like

1972
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:17,800
mean I don't want to make it sound like
 

1973
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,710
mean I don't want to make it sound like
any of it is easy I mean the people who

1974
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:19,720
any of it is easy I mean the people who
 

1975
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:22,109
any of it is easy I mean the people who
are designning the engines and all this

1976
00:42:22,109 --> 00:42:22,119
are designning the engines and all this
 

1977
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:25,910
are designning the engines and all this
so all of it is hard um for sure but the

1978
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:25,920
so all of it is hard um for sure but the
 

1979
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,030
so all of it is hard um for sure but the
but the challenge right now is driving

1980
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:29,040
but the challenge right now is driving
 

1981
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,829
but the challenge right now is driving
really hard to get to uh is to get to

1982
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:31,839
really hard to get to uh is to get to
 

1983
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,470
really hard to get to uh is to get to
rate manufacturing and to do that in an

1984
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:33,480
rate manufacturing and to do that in an
 

1985
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,190
rate manufacturing and to do that in an
efficient way again kind of back to our

1986
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:35,200
efficient way again kind of back to our
 

1987
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,710
efficient way again kind of back to our
cost point if you get to rate

1988
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:37,720
cost point if you get to rate
 

1989
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,910
cost point if you get to rate
Manufacturing in an inefficient way you

1990
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:39,920
Manufacturing in an inefficient way you
 

1991
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,910
Manufacturing in an inefficient way you
haven't really solved the cost problem

1992
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:41,920
haven't really solved the cost problem
 

1993
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,670
haven't really solved the cost problem
and maybe you're haven't really moved

1994
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:43,680
and maybe you're haven't really moved
 

1995
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,829
and maybe you're haven't really moved
the state-ofthe-art forward all this has

1996
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:45,839
the state-ofthe-art forward all this has
 

1997
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,349
the state-ofthe-art forward all this has
to be about moving the state-ofthe-art

1998
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:47,359
to be about moving the state-ofthe-art
 

1999
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,309
to be about moving the state-ofthe-art
forward there are easier easier

2000
00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:49,319
forward there are easier easier
 

2001
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:50,950
forward there are easier easier
businesses to do I always tell people

2002
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:50,960
businesses to do I always tell people
 

2003

the people going to steal
 

2017
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:10,470
the people going to steal
it but yeah it's hard you see what I'm

2018
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:10,480
it but yeah it's hard you see what I'm
 

2019

2025
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,069
its own reward it's it's it's uh it's
fascinating it's worthwhile it's

2026
00:43:21,069 --> 00:43:21,079
fascinating it's worthwhile it's
 

2027
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:23,790
fascinating it's worthwhile it's
meaningful and so you know I you know

2028
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:23,800
meaningful and so you know I you know
 

2029
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,510
meaningful and so you know I you know
not I don't want to pick on salty snack

2030
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:25,520
not I don't want to pick on salty snack
 

2031
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,390
not I don't want to pick on salty snack
food companies but I think it's it's

2032
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:27,400
food companies but I think it's it's
 

2033
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,910
food companies but I think it's it's
less meaningful you know at the end of

2034
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:28,920
less meaningful you know at the end of
 

2035
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,109
less meaningful you know at the end of
the day you're not going to you're not

2036
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:31,119
the day you're not going to you're not
 

2037
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:32,510
the day you're not going to you're not
going to have accomplished something

2038
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:32,520
going to have accomplished something
 

2039
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,510
going to have accomplished something
amazing yeah there's even if you do make

2040
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:34,520
amazing yeah there's even if you do make
 

2041
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,030
amazing yeah there's even if you do make
a lot of money out it yeah there's

2042
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:36,040
a lot of money out it yeah there's
 

2043
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,589
a lot of money out it yeah there's
something fundamentally different about

2044
00:43:37,589 --> 00:43:37,599
something fundamentally different about
 

2045
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,390
something fundamentally different about
the quote unquote business of space

2046
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:40,400
the quote unquote business of space
 

2047

2049
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,910

grand project of humanity yes it's one

2050
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:44,920
grand project of humanity yes it's one
 

2051
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,950
grand project of humanity yes it's one
of Humanity's Grand challenges and

2052
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:47,960
of Humanity's Grand challenges and
 

2053
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,030
of Humanity's Grand challenges and
especially as you look at going to the

2054
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:50,040
especially as you look at going to the
 

2055
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,549
especially as you look at going to the
moon and going to Mars and building

2056
00:43:52,549 --> 00:43:52,559
moon and going to Mars and building
 

2057
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:54,870
moon and going to Mars and building
giant O'Neal colonies and unlocking all

2058
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:54,880
giant O'Neal colonies and unlocking all
 

2059
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,030

the things I you know I won't live long

2060
00:43:58,030 --> 00:43:58,040
the things I you know I won't live long
 

2061
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:01,670
the things I you know I won't live long
enough to see the fruits of this but the

2062
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:01,680
enough to see the fruits of this but the
 

2063
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,990
enough to see the fruits of this but the
fruits of this come from building a road

2064
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:06,000
fruits of this come from building a road
 

2065
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,829
fruits of this come from building a road
to space getting the

2066
00:44:07,829 --> 00:44:07,839
to space getting the
 

2067
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:10,390
to space getting the
infrastructure I give you an analogy

2068
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:10,400
infrastructure I give you an analogy
 

2069
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,069
infrastructure I give you an analogy
when I started Amazon I didn't have to

2070
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:14,079
when I started Amazon I didn't have to
 

2071
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,910
when I started Amazon I didn't have to
develop a payment system it already

2072
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:15,920
develop a payment system it already
 

2073
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,069
develop a payment system it already
existed it was called the credit card I

2074
00:44:18,069 --> 00:44:18,079
existed it was called the credit card I
 

2075
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,910
existed it was called the credit card I
didn't have to develop a transportation

2076
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:20,920
didn't have to develop a transportation
 

2077
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,670
didn't have to develop a transportation
system to deliver the packages it

2078
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:22,680
system to deliver the packages it
 

2079
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,829
system to deliver the packages it
already existed it was called the postal

2080
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:24,839
already existed it was called the postal
 

2081
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:28,030
already existed it was called the postal
service and Royal May and Deutsche Post

2082
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:28,040
service and Royal May and Deutsche Post
 

2083
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:31,150
service and Royal May and Deutsche Post
and so on so all this heavy lifting

2084
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:31,160
and so on so all this heavy lifting
 

2085
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,990
and so on so all this heavy lifting
infrastructure was already in place and

2086
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:34,000
infrastructure was already in place and
 

2087
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,790
infrastructure was already in place and
I could stand on its

2088
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:35,800
I could stand on its
 

2089
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,670
I could stand on its
shoulders and that's why when you look

2090
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:38,680
shoulders and that's why when you look
 

2091
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:41,670
shoulders and that's why when you look
at the internet um you know by the way

2092
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:41,680
at the internet um you know by the way
 

2093
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,190
at the internet um you know by the way
another giant piece of infrastructure

2094
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:43,200
another giant piece of infrastructure
 

2095
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,430
another giant piece of infrastructure
that was around in the early I'm taking

2096
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:44,440
that was around in the early I'm taking
 

2097
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,630
that was around in the early I'm taking
you back to like

2098
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:45,640
you back to like
 

2099
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:49,430
you back to like
1994 people were using dialup modems and

2100
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:49,440
1994 people were using dialup modems and
 

2101
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,349
1994 people were using dialup modems and
it was piggybacking on top of the

2102
00:44:51,349 --> 00:44:51,359
it was piggybacking on top of the
 

2103
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:54,030
it was piggybacking on top of the
long-distance phone network that's how

2104
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:54,040
long-distance phone network that's how
 

2105
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,950
long-distance phone network that's how
the internet that's you know how people

2106
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:55,960
the internet that's you know how people
 

2107
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:59,870
the internet that's you know how people
were accessing servers and so on and

2108
00:44:59,870 --> 00:44:59,880
were accessing servers and so on and
 

2109
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,109
were accessing servers and so on and
that again if if that hadn't existed it

2110
00:45:02,109 --> 00:45:02,119
that again if if that hadn't existed it
 

2111
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:04,109
that again if if that hadn't existed it
would have been hundreds of billions of

2112
00:45:04,109 --> 00:45:04,119
would have been hundreds of billions of
 

2113
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:06,950
would have been hundreds of billions of
capex to put that out there no startup

2114
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:06,960
capex to put that out there no startup
 

2115
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,549
capex to put that out there no startup
company could have done that and so the

2116
00:45:10,549 --> 00:45:10,559
company could have done that and so the
 

2117
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:13,309
company could have done that and so the
problem you know you see in if you look

2118
00:45:13,309 --> 00:45:13,319
problem you know you see in if you look
 

2119
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:16,430
problem you know you see in if you look
at the dynamism in the Internet space

2120
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:16,440
at the dynamism in the Internet space
 

2121
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,270
at the dynamism in the Internet space
over the last 20 years it's because you

2122
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:19,280
over the last 20 years it's because you
 

2123
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,910
over the last 20 years it's because you
know you see like two kids in a dorm

2124
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:21,920
know you see like two kids in a dorm
 

2125
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,670
know you see like two kids in a dorm
room could start an Internet company

2126
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:23,680
room could start an Internet company
 

2127
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,390
room could start an Internet company
that could be successful and do amazing

2128
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:25,400
that could be successful and do amazing
 

2129
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,710
that could be successful and do amazing
things because they didn't have to build

2130
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:27,720
things because they didn't have to build
 

2131
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,510
things because they didn't have to build
heavy infrastructure it was already

2132
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:29,520
heavy infrastructure it was already
 

2133
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,870
heavy infrastructure it was already
there and that's what I want to do I

2134
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:32,880
there and that's what I want to do I
 

2135
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,190
there and that's what I want to do I
take you know my Amazon winnings and use

2136
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:37,200
take you know my Amazon winnings and use
 

2137
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,270
take you know my Amazon winnings and use
that to build heavy infrastructure so

2138
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:39,280
that to build heavy infrastructure so
 

2139
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,549
that to build heavy infrastructure so
the Next

2140
00:45:40,549 --> 00:45:40,559
the Next
 

2141
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:43,270
the Next
Generation you know my the generation

2142
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:43,280
Generation you know my the generation
 

2143
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,150
Generation you know my the generation
that's my children and their children

2144
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:45,160
that's my children and their children
 

2145
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,790
that's my children and their children
these you know th those Generations can

2146
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:47,800
these you know th those Generations can
 

2147
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,349
these you know th those Generations can
then use that heavy infrastructure then

2148
00:45:50,349 --> 00:45:50,359
then use that heavy infrastructure then
 

2149
00:45:50,359 --> 00:45:51,950
then use that heavy infrastructure then
there'll be space entrepreneurs Who

2150
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:51,960
there'll be space entrepreneurs Who
 

2151
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,109
there'll be space entrepreneurs Who
start in their dorm room yeah like that

2152
00:45:54,109 --> 00:45:54,119
start in their dorm room yeah like that
 

2153
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:56,589
start in their dorm room yeah like that
that will be a marker of success

2154
00:45:56,589 --> 00:45:56,599
that will be a marker of success
 

2155
00:45:56,599 --> 00:45:58,710
that will be a marker of success
when you can have a really valuable

2156
00:45:58,710 --> 00:45:58,720
when you can have a really valuable
 

2157
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,829
when you can have a really valuable
space company started in a dorm room

2158
00:46:01,829 --> 00:46:01,839
space company started in a dorm room
 

2159
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:03,950

compliment that's how you know you you
 

2193
00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:46,230
compliment that's how you know you you
you invent something that's so used so

2194
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:46,240
you invent something that's so used so
 

2195
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,589
you invent something that's so used so
beneficially used by so many people that

2196
00:46:48,589 --> 00:46:48,599
beneficially used by so many people that

about nobody I every time I use Amazon
 

2201
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,790
about nobody I every time I use Amazon
I'm still amazed how does this work the

2202
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:54,800
I'm still amazed how does this work the
 

2203
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,910
I'm still amazed how does this work the
logistics that proves you're a very

2204
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:56,920
logistics that proves you're a very
 

2205
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,790
logistics that proves you're a very
curious Explorer all right all right

2206
00:46:58,790 --> 00:46:58,800
curious Explorer all right all right

timeline you said

2210
00:47:02,589 --> 00:47:02,599
timeline you said
 

2211
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:06,950
timeline you said
2024 uh as it stands now are both the

2212
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:06,960
2024 uh as it stands now are both the
 

2213
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,150
2024 uh as it stands now are both the
first test launch and the launch of

2214
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:09,160
first test launch and the launch of
 

2215
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,870
first test launch and the launch of
Escapade explorers Tom Mars still

2216
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:10,880
Escapade explorers Tom Mars still
 

2217
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,990
Escapade explorers Tom Mars still
possible in 2024 yeah I think so um for

2218
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:15,000
possible in 2024 yeah I think so um for
 

2219
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,069
possible in 2024 yeah I think so um for
sure the first launch and then we'll see

2220
00:47:17,069 --> 00:47:17,079
sure the first launch and then we'll see
 

2221
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:19,510
sure the first launch and then we'll see
if if Escapade goes on that or not I

2222
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:19,520
if if Escapade goes on that or not I
 

2223
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,950
if if Escapade goes on that or not I
think that the first launch for sure and

2224
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:20,960
think that the first launch for sure and
 

2225
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,910
think that the first launch for sure and
I hope Escapade too hope well I just

2226
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:24,920
I hope Escapade too hope well I just
 

2227
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,990
I hope Escapade too hope well I just
don't know which Miss it's it's actually

2228
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:27,000
don't know which Miss it's it's actually
 

2229
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,430
don't know which Miss it's it's actually
going to be slated on so we also have

2230
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:29,440
going to be slated on so we also have
 

2231
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,950
going to be slated on so we also have
other things that might go on that first

2232
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:30,960
other things that might go on that first
 

2233
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,630
other things that might go on that first
mission oh I got it but you're

mission oh I got it but you're
 

2235
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,710
mission oh I got it but you're
optimistic that uh the launches will

2236
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:34,720
optimistic that uh the launches will
 

2237
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,549
optimistic that uh the launches will
still oh the first launch I'm very

2238
00:47:36,549 --> 00:47:36,559
still oh the first launch I'm very
 

2239
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:38,150
still oh the first launch I'm very
optimistic that the first launch of new

00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:38,160
optimistic that the first launch of new
 

2241
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,990
optimistic that the first launch of new
Glenn will be in 2024 and I'm just not

2242
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:41,000
Glenn will be in 2024 and I'm just not
 

2243
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,630
Glenn will be in 2024 and I'm just not
100% certain what payload will be on

2244
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:43,640
100% certain what payload will be on
 

2245
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,230
100% certain what payload will be on
that first launch are you nervous about

2246
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:45,240
that first launch are you nervous about
 

2247
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:48,230
that first launch are you nervous about
it are you kidding I'm extremely nervous

2248
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:48,240
it are you kidding I'm extremely nervous
 

2249

00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:02,280
always nervous for these launches but
 

2259
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,710
always nervous for these launches but
yes for sure a first launch to have no

2260
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:04,720
yes for sure a first launch to have no
 

2261
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,910
yes for sure a first launch to have no
nervousness about that would be you know

some sign of derangement I think so well
 

2265
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,230
some sign of derangement I think so well
I got to visit the launch but it's

2266
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:11,240
I got to visit the launch but it's
 

2267
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:14,870
I got to visit the launch but it's
pretty um I mean it's epic you know we

2268
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:14,880
pretty um I mean it's epic you know we
 

2269
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,030
pretty um I mean it's epic you know we
have done a tremendous amount of ground

2270
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:18,040
have done a tremendous amount of ground
 

2271
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:20,910
have done a tremendous amount of ground
testing a tremendous amount of uh

problems that we might find in Flight
 

2277
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,630
problems that we might find in Flight
have been resolved but there are some

2278

have been resolved but there are some
 

2279
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,950
have been resolved but there are some
problems you can only find in flight so

00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:50,720
it I know the
 

2481
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:55,750
it I know the
vehicle um the uh I'm very comfortable

2482
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:55,760
vehicle um the uh I'm very comfortable
 

2483
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,390
vehicle um the uh I'm very comfortable
with the like the Escape system we put

2484
00:52:58,390 --> 00:52:58,400
with the like the Escape system we put
 

2485
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,150
with the like the Escape system we put
as much effort into the Escape system on

2486
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:02,160
as much effort into the Escape system on
 

2487
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,430
as much effort into the Escape system on
that vehicle as we put into all the rest

2488
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:04,440
that vehicle as we put into all the rest
 

2489
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,309
that vehicle as we put into all the rest
of the vehicle combined it's one of the

2490
00:53:06,309 --> 00:53:06,319
of the vehicle combined it's one of the
 

2491
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:08,390
of the vehicle combined it's one of the
hardest pieces of Engineering in the

2492
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:08,400
hardest pieces of Engineering in the
 

2493
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,510
hardest pieces of Engineering in the
entire new Shepard architecture can you

2494
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:10,520
entire new Shepard architecture can you
 

2495
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,950
entire new Shepard architecture can you
actually describe what do you mean by

2496
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:11,960
actually describe what do you mean by
 

2497
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,349
actually describe what do you mean by
Escape system what's involved we have a

2498
00:53:14,349 --> 00:53:14,359
Escape system what's involved we have a
 

2499
00:53:14,359 --> 00:53:17,069
Escape system what's involved we have a
solid rocket motor in the base of the

2500
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:17,079
solid rocket motor in the base of the
 

2501
00:53:17,079 --> 00:53:20,950
solid rocket motor in the base of the
crew capsule so that if anything goes

2502
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:20,960
crew capsule so that if anything goes
 

2503
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,309
crew capsule so that if anything goes
wrong on

2504
00:53:22,309 --> 00:53:22,319
wrong on
 

2505
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:24,430
wrong on
asent you know while the main rocket

2506
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:24,440
asent you know while the main rocket
 

2507
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,670
asent you know while the main rocket
engine is fired

00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:25,680
engine is fired
 

2509
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,750
engine is fired
Ing we can ignite this solid rocket

2510
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:29,760
Ing we can ignite this solid rocket
 

2511
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,270
Ing we can ignite this solid rocket

2513
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:36,390
motor in the base of the crew capsule
and escape from the booster it's a very

2514
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:36,400
and escape from the booster it's a very
 

2515
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,109
and escape from the booster it's a very
challenging system to build design

2516
00:53:39,109 --> 00:53:39,119
challenging system to build design
 

2517
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:42,589
challenging system to build design
validate test all of these things it is

2518
00:53:42,589 --> 00:53:42,599
validate test all of these things it is
 

2519
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:45,190
validate test all of these things it is
the reason that I am comfortable letting

2520
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:45,200
the reason that I am comfortable letting
 

2521
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:49,230
the reason that I am comfortable letting
anyone go on new Shephard so the the the

2522
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:49,240
anyone go on new Shephard so the the the
 

2523
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,910
anyone go on new Shephard so the the the
booster is as safe and reliable as we

2524
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:51,920
booster is as safe and reliable as we
 

2525
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,230
booster is as safe and reliable as we
can make it but um we are harnessing

2526
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:56,240
can make it but um we are harnessing
 

2527
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,990
can make it but um we are harnessing
whenever you're talking about rocket

2528
00:53:57,990 --> 00:53:58,000
whenever you're talking about rocket
 

2529
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,109
whenever you're talking about rocket
engines I don't care what rocket engine

2530
00:54:01,109 --> 00:54:01,119
engines I don't care what rocket engine
 

2531
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:03,309
engines I don't care what rocket engine
you're talking about you are harnessing

2532
00:54:03,309 --> 00:54:03,319
you're talking about you are harnessing
 

2533
00:54:03,319 --> 00:54:07,829
you're talking about you are harnessing
such vast power in such a small compact

2534
00:54:07,829 --> 00:54:07,839
such vast power in such a small compact
 

2535
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:12,630
such vast power in such a small compact
geometric space the power density is so

2536
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:12,640
geometric space the power density is so
 

2537
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,630
geometric space the power density is so
enormous that it is impossible to ever

2538
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:15,640
enormous that it is impossible to ever
 

2539
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:19,109
enormous that it is impossible to ever
be sure that nothing will go wrong and

2540
00:54:19,109 --> 00:54:19,119
be sure that nothing will go wrong and
 

2541
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:23,109
be sure that nothing will go wrong and
so the only way to um improve safety is

2542
00:54:23,109 --> 00:54:23,119
so the only way to um improve safety is
 

2543
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:24,910
so the only way to um improve safety is
to have an escape system and you know

2544
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:24,920
to have an escape system and you know
 

2545
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:25,670
to have an escape system and you know
and

2546
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:25,680
and
 

2547
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,390
and
historically Rockets human rated Rockets

2548
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:28,400
historically Rockets human rated Rockets
 

2549
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,109
historically Rockets human rated Rockets
have had Escape systems only the space

2550
00:54:30,109 --> 00:54:30,119
have had Escape systems only the space
 

2551
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:34,510
have had Escape systems only the space
shuttle did not and um but Apollo had

2552
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:34,520
shuttle did not and um but Apollo had
 

2553
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:37,829
shuttle did not and um but Apollo had
one um the you know um all of the

2554
00:54:37,829 --> 00:54:37,839
one um the you know um all of the
 

2555
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:39,829
one um the you know um all of the
previous you know Gemini Etc they all

2556
00:54:39,829 --> 00:54:39,839
previous you know Gemini Etc they all
 

2557
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:41,069
previous you know Gemini Etc they all
had Escape

2558
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:41,079
had Escape
 

2559
00:54:41,079 --> 00:54:45,109
had Escape
systems and uh we have on new Shephard

2560
00:54:45,109 --> 00:54:45,119
systems and uh we have on new Shephard
 

2561
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,349
systems and uh we have on new Shephard
unusual escapes most Escape systems are

2562
00:54:47,349 --> 00:54:47,359
unusual escapes most Escape systems are
 

2563
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:50,309
unusual escapes most Escape systems are
Towers we have a pusher Escape system so

2564
00:54:50,309 --> 00:54:50,319
Towers we have a pusher Escape system so
 

2565
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:51,710
Towers we have a pusher Escape system so
the solid rocket motor is actually

2566
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:51,720
the solid rocket motor is actually
 

2567
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,549
the solid rocket motor is actually
embedded in the base of the crew capsule

2568
00:54:53,549 --> 00:54:53,559
embedded in the base of the crew capsule
 

2569
00:54:53,559 --> 00:54:56,150
embedded in the base of the crew capsule
and it pushes and it's reusable in the

2570
00:54:56,150 --> 00:54:56,160
and it pushes and it's reusable in the
 

2571
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,150
and it pushes and it's reusable in the
sense that if we don't use it so if we

2572
00:54:59,150 --> 00:54:59,160
sense that if we don't use it so if we
 

2573
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,910
sense that if we don't use it so if we
have a nominal Mission we land with it

2574
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:01,920
have a nominal Mission we land with it
 

2575
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,510
have a nominal Mission we land with it
the tower systems have to be ejected at

2576
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:04,520
the tower systems have to be ejected at
 

2577
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,430
the tower systems have to be ejected at
a certain point in the mission and so

2578
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:06,440
a certain point in the mission and so
 

2579
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,309
a certain point in the mission and so
they get wasted even in a nominal

2580
00:55:08,309 --> 00:55:08,319
they get wasted even in a nominal
 

2581
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:10,950
they get wasted even in a nominal
Mission and so again you know costs

2582
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:10,960
Mission and so again you know costs
 

2583
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,470
Mission and so again you know costs
really matters on these things so we

2584
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:12,480
really matters on these things so we
 

2585
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,750
really matters on these things so we
figured out how to have the Escape

2586
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:13,760
figured out how to have the Escape
 

2587
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,109
figured out how to have the Escape
system be a reusable uh in the event

2588
00:55:17,109 --> 00:55:17,119
system be a reusable uh in the event
 

2589
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:19,630
system be a reusable uh in the event
that it's not used you can reuse it um

2590
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:19,640
that it's not used you can reuse it um
 

2591
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,430
that it's not used you can reuse it um
and have it be a pusher system it's a

2592
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:21,440
and have it be a pusher system it's a
 

2593
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,630
and have it be a pusher system it's a
very sophisticated thing so I knew these

2594
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:23,640
very sophisticated thing so I knew these
 

2595
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,829
very sophisticated thing so I knew these
things you asked me about my decision to

2596
00:55:25,829 --> 00:55:25,839
things you asked me about my decision to
 

2597
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:28,630
things you asked me about my decision to
go and so I know the vehicle very well I

2598
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:28,640
go and so I know the vehicle very well I
 

2599
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:31,390
go and so I know the vehicle very well I
know the people who uh designed it I

2600
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:31,400
know the people who uh designed it I
 

2601
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,950
know the people who uh designed it I
have great trust in them um and in the

2602
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:33,960
have great trust in them um and in the
 

2603
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:36,750
have great trust in them um and in the
engineering that we did uh and I thought

2604
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:36,760
engineering that we did uh and I thought
 

2605
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:40,349
engineering that we did uh and I thought
to myself look if I am not ready to go

2606
00:55:40,349 --> 00:55:40,359
to myself look if I am not ready to go
 

2607
00:55:40,359 --> 00:55:43,789
to myself look if I am not ready to go
then I wouldn't want anyone to go a

2608
00:55:43,789 --> 00:55:43,799
then I wouldn't want anyone to go a
 

2609
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:46,430
then I wouldn't want anyone to go a
tourism vehicle has to be designed in my

2610
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:46,440
tourism vehicle has to be designed in my
 

2611
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,510
tourism vehicle has to be designed in my
view to have very to be a safe as one

2612
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:49,520
view to have very to be a safe as one
 

2613
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,510
view to have very to be a safe as one
can make it you can't make it perfectly

2614
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:52,520
can make it you can't make it perfectly
 

2615
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:53,549
can make it you can't make it perfectly
safe it's

2616
00:55:53,549 --> 00:55:53,559
safe it's
 

2617
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:55,390
safe it's
impossible but you know you know you

2618
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:55,400
impossible but you know you know you
 

2619
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:58,230
impossible but you know you know you
have to you people will do things people

2620
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:58,240
have to you people will do things people
 

2621
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,069
have to you people will do things people
take risk you know they climb mountains

2622
00:56:00,069 --> 00:56:00,079
take risk you know they climb mountains
 

2623
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:02,789
take risk you know they climb mountains
they you know they Skydive they you know

2624
00:56:02,789 --> 00:56:02,799
they you know they Skydive they you know
 

2625
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:05,309
they you know they Skydive they you know
do deep underwater scuba diving and so

2626
00:56:05,309 --> 00:56:05,319
do deep underwater scuba diving and so
 

2627
00:56:05,319 --> 00:56:08,549
do deep underwater scuba diving and so
on people are okay taking risk you can't

2628
00:56:08,549 --> 00:56:08,559
on people are okay taking risk you can't
 

2629
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:12,150
on people are okay taking risk you can't
eliminate the risk but it is something

2630
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:12,160
eliminate the risk but it is something
 

2631
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,829
eliminate the risk but it is something
because it's a tourism vehicle you have

2632
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:13,839
because it's a tourism vehicle you have
 

2633
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:16,430
because it's a tourism vehicle you have
to do your utmost to eliminate those

2634
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:16,440
to do your utmost to eliminate those

appropriate technology risk making those

2790
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:33,440
appropriate technology risk making those
 

2791
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,349
appropriate technology risk making those
decisions quickly um you know being bold

2792
00:59:36,349 --> 00:59:36,359
decisions quickly um you know being bold
 

2793
00:59:36,359 --> 00:59:38,549
decisions quickly um you know being bold
on those things that's what and having

2794
00:59:38,549 --> 00:59:38,559
on those things that's what and having
 

2795
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:40,910
on those things that's what and having
the right culture that supports that you

2796
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:40,920
the right culture that supports that you
 

2797
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:43,630
the right culture that supports that you
need people to be ambitious technically

2798
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:43,640
need people to be ambitious technically
 

2799
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:46,109
need people to be ambitious technically
ambitious you know if there are five

2800
00:59:46,109 --> 00:59:46,119
ambitious you know if there are five
 

2801
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:48,109
ambitious you know if there are five
ways to do something we'll study them

2802
00:59:48,109 --> 00:59:48,119
ways to do something we'll study them
 

2803
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:49,710
ways to do something we'll study them
but let's study them very quickly and

2804
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:49,720
but let's study them very quickly and
 

2805
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:52,270
but let's study them very quickly and
make a decision we can always change our

2806
00:59:52,270 --> 00:59:52,280
make a decision we can always change our
 

2807
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,109
make a decision we can always change our
mind uh it doesn't you know changing

2808
00:59:55,109 --> 00:59:55,119
mind uh it doesn't you know changing
 

2809
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:58,349
mind uh it doesn't you know changing
your mind this I talk about oneway doors

2810
00:59:58,349 --> 00:59:58,359
your mind this I talk about oneway doors
 

2811
00:59:58,359 --> 01:00:01,230
your mind this I talk about oneway doors
and two-way doors most

2812
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:01,240
and two-way doors most
 

2813
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,990
and two-way doors most
decisions are two-way doors can you

2814
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:04,000
decisions are two-way doors can you
 

2815
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,109
decisions are two-way doors can you
explain that cuz I I love that uh

2816
01:00:06,109 --> 01:00:06,119
explain that cuz I I love that uh
 

2817
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:09,870
explain that cuz I I love that uh
metaphor if you make the wrong decision

2818
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:09,880
metaphor if you make the wrong decision
 

2819
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:12,029
metaphor if you make the wrong decision
if it's a two-way door decision you walk

2820
01:00:12,029 --> 01:00:12,039
if it's a two-way door decision you walk
 

2821
01:00:12,039 --> 01:00:13,789
if it's a two-way door decision you walk
out the door you pick a door you walk

2822
01:00:13,789 --> 01:00:13,799
out the door you pick a door you walk
 

2823
01:00:13,799 --> 01:00:16,390
out the door you pick a door you walk
out you spend a little time there it

2824
01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:16,400
out you spend a little time there it
 

2825
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,829
out you spend a little time there it
turns out to be the wrong decision you

2826
01:00:17,829 --> 01:00:17,839
turns out to be the wrong decision you
 

2827
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:20,309
turns out to be the wrong decision you
can come back in and pick another door

2828
01:00:20,309 --> 01:00:20,319
can come back in and pick another door
 

2829
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:23,870
can come back in and pick another door
some decisions are so consequential and

2830
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:23,880
some decisions are so consequential and
 

2831
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:27,029
some decisions are so consequential and
so important and so hard to reverse that

2832
01:00:27,029 --> 01:00:27,039
so important and so hard to reverse that
 

2833
01:00:27,039 --> 01:00:28,870
so important and so hard to reverse that
they really are one-way door decisions

2834
01:00:28,870 --> 01:00:28,880
they really are one-way door decisions
 

2835
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,230
they really are one-way door decisions
you go in that door you're not coming

2836
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:31,240
you go in that door you're not coming
 

2837
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:34,390
you go in that door you're not coming
back MH and those decisions have to be

2838
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:34,400
back MH and those decisions have to be
 

2839
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,670
back MH and those decisions have to be
made very deliberately very carefully um

2840
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:38,680
made very deliberately very carefully um
 

2841
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,390
made very deliberately very carefully um
if you can think of yet another way to

2842
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:40,400
if you can think of yet another way to
 

2843
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,109
if you can think of yet another way to
analyze the decision you should slow

2844
01:00:42,109 --> 01:00:42,119
analyze the decision you should slow
 

2845
01:00:42,119 --> 01:00:45,750
analyze the decision you should slow
down and do that so you know uh when I

2846
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:45,760
down and do that so you know uh when I
 

2847
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:49,150
down and do that so you know uh when I
was CEO of Amazon I often found myself

2848
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:49,160
was CEO of Amazon I often found myself
 

2849
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,430
was CEO of Amazon I often found myself
in the position of being the chief

2850
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:50,440
in the position of being the chief
 

2851
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,910
in the position of being the chief
slowdown officer because somebody would

2852
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:52,920
slowdown officer because somebody would
 

2853
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:56,190
slowdown officer because somebody would
be bringing me a one-way door decision

2854
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:56,200
be bringing me a one-way door decision
 

2855
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,029
be bringing me a one-way door decision
and I it's say okay I can think of three

2856
01:00:58,029 --> 01:00:58,039
and I it's say okay I can think of three
 

2857
01:00:58,039 --> 01:01:00,029
and I it's say okay I can think of three
more ways to analyze that so let's go do

2858
01:01:00,029 --> 01:01:00,039
more ways to analyze that so let's go do
 

2859
01:01:00,039 --> 01:01:02,029
more ways to analyze that so let's go do
that because we have we are not going to

2860
01:01:02,029 --> 01:01:02,039
that because we have we are not going to
 

2861
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:04,150
that because we have we are not going to
be able to reverse this one easily maybe

2862
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:04,160
be able to reverse this one easily maybe
 

2863
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,829
be able to reverse this one easily maybe
you can reverse if it's going to be very

2864
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:05,839
you can reverse if it's going to be very
 

2865
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:07,789
you can reverse if it's going to be very
costly and very timec consuming we

2866
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:07,799
costly and very timec consuming we
 

2867
01:01:07,799 --> 01:01:09,029
costly and very timec consuming we
really have to get this one right from

2868
01:01:09,029 --> 01:01:09,039
really have to get this one right from
 

2869
01:01:09,039 --> 01:01:09,750
really have to get this one right from
the

2870
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:09,760
the
 

2871
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:12,710
the
beginning and

2872
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:12,720
beginning and
 

2873
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,950
beginning and
uh what happens

2874
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:14,960
uh what happens
 

2875
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,349
uh what happens
unfortunately in companies what can

2876
01:01:17,349 --> 01:01:17,359
unfortunately in companies what can
 

2877
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:20,670
unfortunately in companies what can
happen is that you have a one siiz

2878
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:20,680
happen is that you have a one siiz
 

2879
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:24,510
happen is that you have a one siiz

fits-all decisionmaking process where
 

2881
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,829
fits-all decisionmaking process where
you end up using the heavyweight

2882
01:01:26,829 --> 01:01:26,839
you end up using the heavyweight
 

2883
01:01:26,839 --> 01:01:30,069
you end up using the heavyweight
process on all decisions yeah including

2884
01:01:30,069 --> 01:01:30,079
process on all decisions yeah including
 

2885
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:32,150

decisions two-way door decisions should
 

2889
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,190
decisions two-way door decisions should
mostly be made by single individuals or

2890
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:37,200
mostly be made by single individuals or
 

2891
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:40,230
mostly be made by single individuals or

are the ones that that are the
 

2897
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,710
are the ones that that are the

irreversible ones those are the ones
 

2899
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:48,549
irreversible ones those are the ones
that should be elevated up to you know

2900
01:01:48,549 --> 01:01:48,559
that should be elevated up to you know
 

2901
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:51,190
that should be elevated up to you know
the senior most Executives who should

2902
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:51,200
the senior most Executives who should
 

2903
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,069
the senior most Executives who should
slow them down and make sure that the

2904
01:01:53,069 --> 01:01:53,079
slow them down and make sure that the
 

2905
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:55,269
slow them down and make sure that the
right thing is being done

2906
01:01:55,269 --> 01:01:55,279
right thing is being done
 

2907
01:01:55,279 --> 01:01:57,230
right thing is being done
yeah I mean part of the skill here is to

2908
01:01:57,230 --> 01:01:57,240
yeah I mean part of the skill here is to
 

2909
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,710
yeah I mean part of the skill here is to
to know the difference between one way

2910
01:01:58,710 --> 01:01:58,720
to know the difference between one way
 

2911
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,990
to know the difference between one way
and two way I think you me yeah I mean I

2912
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:01,000
and two way I think you me yeah I mean I
 

2913
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,630
and two way I think you me yeah I mean I
think you mentioned Amazon

2914
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:02,640
think you mentioned Amazon
 

2915
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:05,309
think you mentioned Amazon
Prime uh the decision to sort of create

2916
01:02:05,309 --> 01:02:05,319

2917
01:02:05,319 --> 01:02:08,510
Prime uh the decision to sort of create
Amazon Prime as a one-way door and I

2918
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:08,520
Amazon Prime as a one-way door and I
 

2919
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,230
Amazon Prime as a one-way door and I
mean it's not it's unclear if it is or

2920
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:10,240
mean it's not it's unclear if it is or
 

2921
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,549
mean it's not it's unclear if it is or
not but it probably is and it's a really

2922
01:02:12,549 --> 01:02:12,559
not but it probably is and it's a really
 

2923
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:14,950
not but it probably is and it's a really
big risk to go there there are a bunch

2924
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:14,960
big risk to go there there are a bunch
 

2925
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,829
big risk to go there there are a bunch
of decisions like that that are you

2926
01:02:17,829 --> 01:02:17,839
of decisions like that that are you
 

2927
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:20,349
of decisions like that that are you
know changing the decision is going to

2928
01:02:20,349 --> 01:02:20,359
know changing the decision is going to
 

2929
01:02:20,359 --> 01:02:22,870
know changing the decision is going to
be very very complicated some of them

2930
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:22,880
be very very complicated some of them
 

2931
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,670
be very very complicated some of them
are technical decisions too the because

2932
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:24,680
are technical decisions too the because
 

2933
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,230
are technical decisions too the because
some technical decisions are like quick

2934
01:02:26,230 --> 01:02:26,240
some technical decisions are like quick
 

2935
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,349
some technical decisions are like quick

to that decision so I'm not going to be
 

3061
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,549
to that decision so I'm not going to be
second guessing it I'm not going to be

to help make sure it works that's a

3068
01:05:15,029 --> 01:05:15,039
to help make sure it works that's a
 

3069
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:18,109
to help make sure it works that's a
really important teammate Behavior

everybody's well intentioned they just
 

3083
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:34,069
everybody's well intentioned they just
have a very different opinion about what

society and inside companies we have a
 

3089
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:43,670
society and inside companies we have a
bunch of um mechanisms that we use to

3090
01:05:43,670 --> 01:05:43,680
bunch of um mechanisms that we use to
 

3091
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:47,269
bunch of um mechanisms that we use to
resolve these kinds of disputes a lot of

3092
01:05:47,269 --> 01:05:47,279

01:05:56,269 --> 01:05:56,279
agreement is
 

3099
01:05:56,279 --> 01:05:59,029
agreement is
compromise so compromise you know look I

3100
01:05:59,029 --> 01:05:59,039
compromise so compromise you know look I
 

3101
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,750
compromise so compromise you know look I
here's we're in a room here and I could

3102
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:00,760
here's we're in a room here and I could
 

3103
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:03,150
here's we're in a room here and I could
say Lex how tall do you think this

3104
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:03,160
say Lex how tall do you think this
 

3105
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,150
say Lex how tall do you think this
ceiling is and you'd be like I don't

3106
01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:05,160
ceiling is and you'd be like I don't
 

3107
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,670
ceiling is and you'd be like I don't
know Jeff maybe 12 feet tall and I would

3108
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:07,680
know Jeff maybe 12 feet tall and I would
 

3109
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:12,190
know Jeff maybe 12 feet tall and I would
say I I think it's 11 feet tall and then

3110
01:06:12,190 --> 01:06:12,200
say I I think it's 11 feet tall and then
 

3111
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:13,789
say I I think it's 11 feet tall and then
um we'd say you know what let's just

3112
01:06:13,789 --> 01:06:13,799
um we'd say you know what let's just
 

3113
01:06:13,799 --> 01:06:15,950
um we'd say you know what let's just
call it 11 and A2

3114
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:15,960
call it 11 and A2
 

3115
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:19,750
call it 11 and A2
feet that's compromised instead of the

3116
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:19,760
feet that's compromised instead of the
 

3117
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,309
feet that's compromised instead of the
right thing to do is you know to get a

3118
01:06:21,309 --> 01:06:21,319
right thing to do is you know to get a
 

3119
01:06:21,319 --> 01:06:24,309
right thing to do is you know to get a
tape measure or figure out some way of

3120
01:06:24,309 --> 01:06:24,319
tape measure or figure out some way of
 

3121
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:26,670
tape measure or figure out some way of
measuring but think getting that tape

3122
01:06:26,670 --> 01:06:26,680
measuring but think getting that tape
 

3123
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:28,109
measuring but think getting that tape
measure and figure how to get it to the

3124
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:28,119
measure and figure how to get it to the
 

3125
01:06:28,119 --> 01:06:29,670
measure and figure how to get it to the
top of the ceiling and all these things

3126
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:29,680
top of the ceiling and all these things
 

3127
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:32,470
top of the ceiling and all these things
that requires energy compromise the

3128
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:32,480
that requires energy compromise the
 

3129
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:35,670
that requires energy compromise the
advantage of compromise as a resolution

3130
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:35,680
advantage of compromise as a resolution
 

3131
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:38,069
advantage of compromise as a resolution
mechanism is that it's low

3132
01:06:38,069 --> 01:06:38,079
mechanism is that it's low
 

3133
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:41,349
mechanism is that it's low
energy um but it doesn't lead to truth

3134
01:06:41,349 --> 01:06:41,359
energy um but it doesn't lead to truth
 

3135
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:43,710
energy um but it doesn't lead to truth
and so uh in things like the height of

3136
01:06:43,710 --> 01:06:43,720
and so uh in things like the height of
 

3137
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:45,829
and so uh in things like the height of
the ceiling where truth is a knowable

3138
01:06:45,829 --> 01:06:45,839
the ceiling where truth is a knowable
 

3139
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:48,230
the ceiling where truth is a knowable
thing you shouldn't allow compromise to

3140
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:48,240
thing you shouldn't allow compromise to
 

3141
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:51,269
thing you shouldn't allow compromise to
be used when you can know the truth MH

3142
01:06:51,269 --> 01:06:51,279
be used when you can know the truth MH
 

3143
01:06:51,279 --> 01:06:53,390
be used when you can know the truth MH
um another really bad resolution

3144
01:06:53,390 --> 01:06:53,400
um another really bad resolution
 

3145
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:56,309
um another really bad resolution
mechanism happens all the time is just

3146
01:06:56,309 --> 01:06:56,319
mechanism happens all the time is just
 

3147
01:06:56,319 --> 01:06:57,789
mechanism happens all the time is just
who's more

3148
01:06:57,789 --> 01:06:57,799
who's more
 

3149
01:06:57,799 --> 01:07:01,430
who's more
stubborn yeah this is also let's say two

3150
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:01,440
stubborn yeah this is also let's say two
 

3151
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,910
stubborn yeah this is also let's say two
Executives who disagree and they just

3152
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:03,920
Executives who disagree and they just
 

3153
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,069
Executives who disagree and they just
have a war of attrition in which

3154
01:07:06,069 --> 01:07:06,079
have a war of attrition in which
 

3155
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:09,390
have a war of attrition in which
everyone gets exhausted first

3156
01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:09,400
everyone gets exhausted first
 

3157
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,430
everyone gets exhausted first
capitulates to the other one again you

3158
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:11,440
capitulates to the other one again you
 

3159
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,670
capitulates to the other one again you
haven't arrived at truth and this is

3160
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:13,680
haven't arrived at truth and this is
 

3161
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:14,950
haven't arrived at truth and this is
very

3162
01:07:14,950 --> 01:07:14,960
very
 

3163
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,390
very
demoralizing so you know this is where

3164
01:07:17,390 --> 01:07:17,400
demoralizing so you know this is where
 

3165
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:21,430
demoralizing so you know this is where
escalation I I try to ask people who you

3166
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:21,440
escalation I I try to ask people who you
 

3167
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:24,950
escalation I I try to ask people who you
know on my team and say never get to a

3168
01:07:24,950 --> 01:07:24,960
know on my team and say never get to a
 

3169
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,589
know on my team and say never get to a
point where you are resolving something

3170
01:07:27,589 --> 01:07:27,599
point where you are resolving something
 

3171
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:30,150
point where you are resolving something
by you know who gets exhausted

3172
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:30,160
by you know who gets exhausted
 

3173
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:33,190
by you know who gets exhausted
first escalate that I'll help you make

3174
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:33,200
first escalate that I'll help you make
 

3175
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,510
first escalate that I'll help you make
the decision like let's because that's

3176
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:35,520
the decision like let's because that's
 

3177
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:38,549
the decision like let's because that's
so de-energizing and such a terrible

3178
01:07:38,549 --> 01:07:38,559
so de-energizing and such a terrible
 

3179
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:41,029
so de-energizing and such a terrible
lousy way to make a decision so you want

3180
01:07:41,029 --> 01:07:41,039
lousy way to make a decision so you want
 

3181
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:42,589
lousy way to make a decision so you want
to get to the resolution as quickly as

3182
01:07:42,589 --> 01:07:42,599
to get to the resolution as quickly as
 

3183
01:07:42,599 --> 01:07:43,910
to get to the resolution as quickly as
possible because that ultimately leads

3184
01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:43,920
possible because that ultimately leads
 

3185
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,990
possible because that ultimately leads
to high velocity of the yes and you want

3186
01:07:45,990 --> 01:07:46,000
to high velocity of the yes and you want
 

3187
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,029
to high velocity of the yes and you want
to try to get as close to truth as

3188
01:07:48,029 --> 01:07:48,039
to try to get as close to truth as
 

3189
01:07:48,039 --> 01:07:51,349
to try to get as close to truth as
possible so you want like you know

3190
01:07:51,349 --> 01:07:51,359
possible so you want like you know
 

3191
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,390
possible so you want like you know
exhausting the other person is not truth

3192
01:07:53,390 --> 01:07:53,400
exhausting the other person is not truth
 

3193
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:57,029
exhausting the other person is not truth
seeking yes and compromise is not truth

3194
01:07:57,029 --> 01:07:57,039
seeking yes and compromise is not truth
 

3195
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:59,589
seeking yes and compromise is not truth
seeking so you know it doesn't mean now

01:07:59,589 --> 01:07:59,599
seeking so you know it doesn't mean now
 

3197
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:01,109
seeking so you know it doesn't mean now
and there are a lot of cases where no

3198
01:08:01,109 --> 01:08:01,119
and there are a lot of cases where no
 

3199
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:02,470
and there are a lot of cases where no
one knows the real truth and that's

3200
01:08:02,470 --> 01:08:02,480
one knows the real truth and that's
 

3201
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,990
one knows the real truth and that's
where disagree and commit can come in um

3202
01:08:05,990 --> 01:08:06,000
where disagree and commit can come in um
 

3203
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,630
where disagree and commit can come in um
but it's it's um escalation is better

3204
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:08,640
but it's it's um escalation is better
 

3205
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:11,269
but it's it's um escalation is better
than War of Attrition escalate to you

3206
01:08:11,269 --> 01:08:11,279
than War of Attrition escalate to you
 

3207
01:08:11,279 --> 01:08:14,069
than War of Attrition escalate to you
know to your boss and say hey we can't

3215
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:21,550
disagree with each other we need you to
you know make a decision here so we can

3216
01:08:21,550 --> 01:08:21,560
you know make a decision here so we can
 

3217
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:24,349
you know make a decision here so we can
move forward but decisiveness

3218
01:08:24,349 --> 01:08:24,359
move forward but decisiveness
 

3219
01:08:24,359 --> 01:08:27,630
move forward but decisiveness
moving forward quickly on on decisions

01:08:27,630 --> 01:08:27,640
moving forward quickly on on decisions
 

3221
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:30,829
moving forward quickly on on decisions
as quickly as as you responsibly can is

3222
01:08:30,829 --> 01:08:30,839
as quickly as as you responsibly can is
 

3223
01:08:30,839 --> 01:08:32,950
as quickly as as you responsibly can is
how you increase velocity most of what

3224
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:32,960
how you increase velocity most of what
 

3225
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,950
how you increase velocity most of what
slows things down is in is taking too

3226
01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:35,960
slows things down is in is taking too

01:08:43,149 --> 01:08:43,159
culture to get high velocity you know

01:08:43,159 --> 01:08:45,590
culture to get high velocity you know
Amazon has a million and a half people

lunar program let me ask you about that
 

3251
01:09:02,679 --> 01:09:06,229

yeah um there's a a lot going on there
 

3253
01:09:06,239 --> 01:09:07,550
yeah um there's a a lot going on there
and you haven't really talked about it

3254
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:07,560
and you haven't really talked about it
 

3255
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,829
and you haven't really talked about it
much so in addition to the Artemis

3256
01:09:09,829 --> 01:09:09,839
much so in addition to the Artemis
 

3257
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:12,269
much so in addition to the Artemis
program with NASA uh blue is doing its

01:09:12,269 --> 01:09:12,279
program with NASA uh blue is doing its
 

3259
01:09:12,279 --> 01:09:14,470
program with NASA uh blue is doing its
own Lander program can you describe it

3260

hydrogen and uh which is for for high
 

3303
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,270
hydrogen and uh which is for for high
energy missions like landing on the

3304
01:10:19,270 --> 01:10:19,280
energy missions like landing on the
 

3305
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,790
energy missions like landing on the
surface of the Moon the high specific

3306
01:10:21,790 --> 01:10:21,800
surface of the Moon the high specific
 

3307
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,910

impulse of hydrogen is a very big advant

3308
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:23,920
impulse of hydrogen is a very big advant
 

3309
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,870

AG the disadvantage of hydrogen has

3310
01:10:26,870 --> 01:10:26,880
AG the disadvantage of hydrogen has
 

3311
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:29,910
AG the disadvantage of hydrogen has
always been that it's since it's such a

3312
01:10:29,910 --> 01:10:29,920
always been that it's since it's such a
 

3313
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:33,550
always been that it's since it's such a
deep cryogen it's not storable so it's

3314
01:10:33,550 --> 01:10:33,560
deep cryogen it's not storable so it's
 

3315
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:35,950
deep cryogen it's not storable so it's
constantly boiling off and you're losing

3316
01:10:35,950 --> 01:10:35,960
constantly boiling off and you're losing
 

3317
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:39,229
constantly boiling off and you're losing
propellant um because it's boiling off

3318
01:10:39,229 --> 01:10:39,239
propellant um because it's boiling off
 

3319
01:10:39,239 --> 01:10:41,830
propellant um because it's boiling off
and so what we're doing as part of the L

3320
01:10:41,830 --> 01:10:41,840
and so what we're doing as part of the L
 

3321
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:44,990
and so what we're doing as part of the L
of our lunar program is developing solar

program the lunar lander and Apollo was
 

3369
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:45,990
program the lunar lander and Apollo was
really two stages it would land on the

01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:46,000
really two stages it would land on the
 

3371
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,110
really two stages it would land on the
surface and then it would leave The

and only the ascent stage would go back
 

3377
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:54,350
and only the ascent stage would go back
up into lunar or orbit where it would

what we're doing is we have a single

3382
01:11:58,550 --> 01:11:58,560
what we're doing is we have a single
 

3383
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,229
what we're doing is we have a single
stage lunar lander that carries down

3384
01:12:01,229 --> 01:12:01,239
stage lunar lander that carries down
 

3385
01:12:01,239 --> 01:12:02,830
stage lunar lander that carries down
enough propellant so it can bring the

3386
01:12:02,830 --> 01:12:02,840
enough propellant so it can bring the
 

3387
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:05,149
enough propellant so it can bring the
whole thing back up so that it can be

3388
01:12:05,149 --> 01:12:05,159
whole thing back up so that it can be
 

3389
01:12:05,159 --> 01:12:07,910
whole thing back up so that it can be
reused over and over and the point of

3390
01:12:07,910 --> 01:12:07,920
reused over and over and the point of
 

3391
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,189
reused over and over and the point of
doing that of course is to reduce cost

3392
01:12:10,189 --> 01:12:10,199
doing that of course is to reduce cost
 

3393
01:12:10,199 --> 01:12:13,030
doing that of course is to reduce cost
so that you can make Lunar missions more

3394
01:12:13,030 --> 01:12:13,040
so that you can make Lunar missions more
 

3395
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,350
so that you can make Lunar missions more
affordable over time which is that's one

3396
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:15,360
affordable over time which is that's one
 

3397
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:18,590
affordable over time which is that's one
of NASA's big objectives because this

3398
01:12:18,590 --> 01:12:18,600
of NASA's big objectives because this
 

3399
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:22,390
of NASA's big objectives because this
time the the whole point of Artemis is

3400
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:22,400
time the the whole point of Artemis is
 

3401
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,790
time the the whole point of Artemis is
go back to the moon but is time to stay

3402
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:24,800
go back to the moon but is time to stay
 

3403
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,270
go back to the moon but is time to stay
MH so you know back in the Apollo

3404
01:12:28,270 --> 01:12:28,280
MH so you know back in the Apollo
 

3405
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:30,189
MH so you know back in the Apollo
program we went to the moon six times

3406
01:12:30,189 --> 01:12:30,199
program we went to the moon six times
 

3407
01:12:30,199 --> 01:12:32,229
program we went to the moon six times
and then ended the program and it really

3408
01:12:32,229 --> 01:12:32,239
and then ended the program and it really
 

3409
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:37,070
and then ended the program and it really
was too expensive to to continue and so

3410
01:12:37,070 --> 01:12:37,080
was too expensive to to continue and so
 

3411
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:38,790
was too expensive to to continue and so
there's a few questions there but one is

3412
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:38,800
there's a few questions there but one is
 

3413
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,950
there's a few questions there but one is
how do you stay in the moon what what

3414
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:40,960
how do you stay in the moon what what
 

3415
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:42,709
how do you stay in the moon what what
ideas do you have

3416
01:12:42,709 --> 01:12:42,719
ideas do you have
 

3417
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:46,750
ideas do you have
about uh yeah like a sustain sustaining

3418
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:46,760
about uh yeah like a sustain sustaining
 

3419
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:49,669
about uh yeah like a sustain sustaining
life where a few folks can stay there

3420
01:12:49,669 --> 01:12:49,679
life where a few folks can stay there
 

3421
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:52,910
life where a few folks can stay there
for prol long periods of time well um

3422
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:52,920
for prol long periods of time well um
 

3423
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:54,470
for prol long periods of time well um
one of the things things we're working

3424
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:54,480
one of the things things we're working
 

3425
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:58,510
one of the things things we're working
on is um using lunar resources like

3426
01:12:58,510 --> 01:12:58,520
on is um using lunar resources like
 

3427
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:01,270
on is um using lunar resources like
lunar regolith to

3428
01:13:01,270 --> 01:13:01,280
lunar regolith to
 

3429
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:04,270
lunar regolith to
manufacture Commodities and even solar

3430
01:13:04,270 --> 01:13:04,280
manufacture Commodities and even solar
 

3431
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:07,070
manufacture Commodities and even solar
cells on the surface of the Moon we've

3432
01:13:07,070 --> 01:13:07,080
cells on the surface of the Moon we've
 

3433
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:09,669
cells on the surface of the Moon we've
already built a solar cell that is

3434
01:13:09,669 --> 01:13:09,679
already built a solar cell that is
 

3435
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:12,470
already built a solar cell that is
completely made from lunar regolith

3436
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:12,480
completely made from lunar regolith
 

3437
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:16,750
completely made from lunar regolith
simulant and this solar cell is only

3438
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:16,760
simulant and this solar cell is only
 

3439
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:19,830
simulant and this solar cell is only
about 7% uh power efficient so it's very

3440
01:13:19,830 --> 01:13:19,840
about 7% uh power efficient so it's very
 

3441
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:21,990
about 7% uh power efficient so it's very
inefficient compared to you know the

3442
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:22,000
inefficient compared to you know the
 

3443
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,910
inefficient compared to you know the
more advanced solar cells that we make

3444
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:23,920
more advanced solar cells that we make
 

3445
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:26,870
more advanced solar cells that we make
here on Earth but if you can figure out

3446
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:26,880
here on Earth but if you can figure out
 

3447
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,030
here on Earth but if you can figure out
how to make a practical solar cell

3448
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:30,040
how to make a practical solar cell
 

3449
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:32,510
how to make a practical solar cell
Factory that you can land on the surface

3450
01:13:32,510 --> 01:13:32,520
Factory that you can land on the surface
 

3451
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:35,590
Factory that you can land on the surface
of the Moon and then the raw material

3452
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:35,600
of the Moon and then the raw material
 

3453
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:38,510
of the Moon and then the raw material
for those solar cells is simply lunar

3454
01:13:38,510 --> 01:13:38,520
for those solar cells is simply lunar
 

3455
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:41,790
for those solar cells is simply lunar
regolith then you can just uh you know

3456
01:13:41,790 --> 01:13:41,800
regolith then you can just uh you know
 

3457
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:44,669
regolith then you can just uh you know
continue to churn out solar cells on the

3458
01:13:44,669 --> 01:13:44,679
continue to churn out solar cells on the
 

3459
01:13:44,679 --> 01:13:46,669
continue to churn out solar cells on the
surface of the Moon have lots of power

3460
01:13:46,669 --> 01:13:46,679
surface of the Moon have lots of power
 

3461
01:13:46,679 --> 01:13:48,350
surface of the Moon have lots of power
on the surface of the Moon that will

3462
01:13:48,350 --> 01:13:48,360
on the surface of the Moon that will
 

3463
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,270
on the surface of the Moon that will
make it easier for people to live on the

3464
01:13:50,270 --> 01:13:50,280
make it easier for people to live on the
 

3465
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:54,110
make it easier for people to live on the
moon uh similarly we're working on

3466
01:13:54,110 --> 01:13:54,120
moon uh similarly we're working on
 

3467
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:58,470
moon uh similarly we're working on
extracting oxygen from lunar regolith so

3468
01:13:58,470 --> 01:13:58,480
extracting oxygen from lunar regolith so
 

3469
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:01,110
extracting oxygen from lunar regolith so
lunar regolith by weight is has a lot of

3470
01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:01,120
lunar regolith by weight is has a lot of
 

3471
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:04,310
lunar regolith by weight is has a lot of
oxygen in it it's bound very tightly you

3472
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:04,320
oxygen in it it's bound very tightly you
 

3473
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:07,629
oxygen in it it's bound very tightly you
know in as oxides with other elements

3474
01:14:07,629 --> 01:14:07,639
know in as oxides with other elements
 

3475
01:14:07,639 --> 01:14:09,550
know in as oxides with other elements
and so it you have to separate the

3476
01:14:09,550 --> 01:14:09,560
and so it you have to separate the
 

3477
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:12,870
and so it you have to separate the
oxygen which is very energy intensive so

3478
01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:12,880
oxygen which is very energy intensive so
 

3479
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:15,830
oxygen which is very energy intensive so
that also could work together with the

3480
01:14:15,830 --> 01:14:15,840
that also could work together with the
 

3481
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:18,550
that also could work together with the
uh solar cells but if you can uh and

3482
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:18,560
uh solar cells but if you can uh and
 

3483
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:19,709
uh solar cells but if you can uh and
then

3484
01:14:19,709 --> 01:14:19,719
then
 

3485
01:14:19,719 --> 01:14:22,189
then
ultimately we may be able to find

3486
01:14:22,189 --> 01:14:22,199
ultimately we may be able to find
 

3487
01:14:22,199 --> 01:14:24,430
ultimately we may be able to find
practical quantities

3488
01:14:24,430 --> 01:14:24,440
practical quantities
 

3489
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:28,430
practical quantities
of Ice uh in the permanently shadowed

3490
01:14:28,430 --> 01:14:28,440
of Ice uh in the permanently shadowed
 

3491
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:30,950
of Ice uh in the permanently shadowed
craters on the poles of the

3492
01:14:30,950 --> 01:14:30,960
craters on the poles of the
 

3493
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:35,189
craters on the poles of the
Moon and we know there is ice water um

3494
01:14:35,189 --> 01:14:35,199
Moon and we know there is ice water um
 

3495
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:38,310
Moon and we know there is ice water um
in in those uh or water ice in those

3496
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:38,320
in in those uh or water ice in those
 

3497
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:41,030
in in those uh or water ice in those
craters and we know that we can break

3498
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:41,040
craters and we know that we can break
 

3499
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:44,430
craters and we know that we can break
that down with electrolysis into

3500
01:14:44,430 --> 01:14:44,440
that down with electrolysis into
 

3501
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:46,669
that down with electrolysis into
hydrogen and oxygen and then youd not

3502
01:14:46,669 --> 01:14:46,679
hydrogen and oxygen and then youd not
 

3503
01:14:46,679 --> 01:14:49,790
hydrogen and oxygen and then youd not
only have oxygen but you'd also have a

3504
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:49,800
only have oxygen but you'd also have a
 

3505
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:54,910
only have oxygen but you'd also have a
very good high efficiency propellent uh

3506
01:14:54,910 --> 01:14:54,920
very good high efficiency propellent uh
 

3507
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:58,270
very good high efficiency propellent uh
fuel in in hydrogen so there's a lot the

3508
01:14:58,270 --> 01:14:58,280
fuel in in hydrogen so there's a lot the
 

3509
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:00,229
fuel in in hydrogen so there's a lot the
there's a lot we can do to make the moon

3510
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:00,239
there's a lot we can do to make the moon
 

3511
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:02,830
there's a lot we can do to make the moon
more sustainable over time but the very

3512
01:15:02,830 --> 01:15:02,840
more sustainable over time but the very
 

3513
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:05,070
more sustainable over time but the very
first step the thing the kind of gate

3514
01:15:05,070 --> 01:15:05,080
first step the thing the kind of gate
 

3515
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:07,870
first step the thing the kind of gate
that all of that has to go through is we

3516
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:07,880
that all of that has to go through is we
 

3517
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,550
that all of that has to go through is we
need to be able to

3518
01:15:09,550 --> 01:15:09,560
need to be able to
 

3519
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:13,590
need to be able to
land uh cargo and humans on the surface

3520
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:13,600
land uh cargo and humans on the surface
 

3521
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,590
land uh cargo and humans on the surface
of the Moon at an acceptable cost to

3522
01:15:16,590 --> 01:15:16,600
of the Moon at an acceptable cost to
 

3523
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:18,830
of the Moon at an acceptable cost to
fast forward a little bit is there any

3524
01:15:18,830 --> 01:15:18,840
fast forward a little bit is there any
 

3525
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:22,870
fast forward a little bit is there any
chance Jeff basil steps foot on the moon

3526
01:15:22,870 --> 01:15:22,880
chance Jeff basil steps foot on the moon
 

3527
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,270
chance Jeff basil steps foot on the moon
and on

3528
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:24,280
and on
 

3529
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:28,870
and on
Mars one or the other or both it's very

3530
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:28,880
Mars one or the other or both it's very
 

3531
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,629
Mars one or the other or both it's very
unlikely I think it's probably something

3532
01:15:31,629 --> 01:15:31,639
unlikely I think it's probably something
 

3533
01:15:31,639 --> 01:15:33,590
unlikely I think it's probably something
that gets done by Future Generations by

3534
01:15:33,590 --> 01:15:33,600
that gets done by Future Generations by
 

3535
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,510
that gets done by Future Generations by
the time it gets to me I think in my

3536
01:15:35,510 --> 01:15:35,520
the time it gets to me I think in my
 

3537
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,229
the time it gets to me I think in my
lifetime that's probably going to be

3538
01:15:38,229 --> 01:15:38,239
lifetime that's probably going to be
 

3539
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:41,590
lifetime that's probably going to be
done by professional astronauts sadly I

3540
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:41,600
done by professional astronauts sadly I
 

3541
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,149
done by professional astronauts sadly I
would love to sign up for that mission

3542
01:15:44,149 --> 01:15:44,159
would love to sign up for that mission
 

3543
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:46,709
would love to sign up for that mission
um so don't count me out yet Lex you

3544
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:46,719
um so don't count me out yet Lex you
 

3545
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:48,790
um so don't count me out yet Lex you
know give me give me a fighting shot

3546
01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:48,800
know give me give me a fighting shot
 

3547
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:51,669
know give me give me a fighting shot
here maybe but I think if we're if we

3548
01:15:51,669 --> 01:15:51,679
here maybe but I think if we're if we
 

3549
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:53,950
here maybe but I think if we're if we
are uh placing

3550
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:53,960
are uh placing
 

3551
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:56,590
are uh placing
uh reasonable bets on such a thing in my

3552
01:15:56,590 --> 01:15:56,600
uh reasonable bets on such a thing in my
 

3553
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,110
uh reasonable bets on such a thing in my
lifetime that will continue to be done

3554
01:15:58,110 --> 01:15:58,120
lifetime that will continue to be done
 

3555
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,830
lifetime that will continue to be done
by professional astronauts yeah so these

3556
01:15:59,830 --> 01:15:59,840
by professional astronauts yeah so these
 

3557
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:02,629
by professional astronauts yeah so these
are risky difficult missions and

3558
01:16:02,629 --> 01:16:02,639
are risky difficult missions and
 

3559
01:16:02,639 --> 01:16:04,149
are risky difficult missions and
probably missions that require a lot of

3560
01:16:04,149 --> 01:16:04,159
probably missions that require a lot of
 

3561
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:06,590
probably missions that require a lot of
training you know you are going there

3562
01:16:06,590 --> 01:16:06,600
training you know you are going there
 

3563
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,590
training you know you are going there
for a very specific purpose to do

3564
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:08,600
for a very specific purpose to do
 

3565
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,310
for a very specific purpose to do
something we're going to be able to do a

3566
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:10,320
something we're going to be able to do a
 

3567
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:13,470
something we're going to be able to do a
lot on the Moon too with automation so

3568
01:16:13,470 --> 01:16:13,480
lot on the Moon too with automation so
 

3569
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:14,870
lot on the Moon too with automation so
you know in terms of setting up these

3570
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:14,880
you know in terms of setting up these
 

3571
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:17,350
you know in terms of setting up these
factories and doing all that we we're

3572
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:17,360
factories and doing all that we we're
 

3573
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:19,430
factories and doing all that we we're
sophisticated enough now with automation

3574
01:16:19,430 --> 01:16:19,440
sophisticated enough now with automation
 

3575
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:21,070
sophisticated enough now with automation
that we probably don't need humans to

3576
01:16:21,070 --> 01:16:21,080
that we probably don't need humans to
 

3577
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:24,229
that we probably don't need humans to
tend those factories and machines

3578
01:16:24,229 --> 01:16:24,239
tend those factories and machines
 

3579
01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:26,669
tend those factories and machines
um so it's there's a lot that's going to

3580
01:16:26,669 --> 01:16:26,679
um so it's there's a lot that's going to
 

3581
01:16:26,679 --> 01:16:29,910
um so it's there's a lot that's going to
be done in both modes so I have to ask

3582
01:16:29,910 --> 01:16:29,920
be done in both modes so I have to ask
 

3583
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:32,750
be done in both modes so I have to ask
the bigger picture question about the

3584
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:32,760
the bigger picture question about the
 

3585
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:34,430
the bigger picture question about the
two companies

3586
01:16:34,430 --> 01:16:34,440
two companies
 

3587
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:36,990
two companies

often but we change them
 

3867
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:53,470
often but we change them
occasionally and um when we work on

3868
01:22:53,470 --> 01:22:53,480
occasionally and um when we work on
 

3869
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:55,110
occasionally and um when we work on
programs that

3870
01:22:55,110 --> 01:22:55,120
programs that
 

3871
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:58,110
programs that
Amazon we often uh make a list of

3872
01:22:58,110 --> 01:22:58,120
Amazon we often uh make a list of
 

3873
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:01,910
Amazon we often uh make a list of
tenants and this the tenants are kind of

3874
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:01,920
tenants and this the tenants are kind of
 

3875
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:03,470
tenants and this the tenants are kind of
they're not principles they're a little

3876
01:23:03,470 --> 01:23:03,480
they're not principles they're a little
 

3877
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:05,510
they're not principles they're a little
more tactical than principles but it's

3878
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:05,520
more tactical than principles but it's
 

3879
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:09,229
more tactical than principles but it's
kind of the the main ideas that we want

3880
01:23:09,229 --> 01:23:09,239
kind of the the main ideas that we want
 

3881
01:23:09,239 --> 01:23:11,629
kind of the the main ideas that we want
this program to embody whatever those

3882
01:23:11,629 --> 01:23:11,639
this program to embody whatever those
 

3883
01:23:11,639 --> 01:23:14,669
this program to embody whatever those
are and one of the things that we do is

01:23:14,669 --> 01:23:14,679
are and one of the things that we do is
 

3885
01:23:14,679 --> 01:23:16,669
are and one of the things that we do is
we put these are the tenants for this

01:23:16,669 --> 01:23:16,679
we put these are the tenants for this
 

3887
01:23:16,679 --> 01:23:19,550
we put these are the tenants for this

never want to get trapped by history it

never want to get trapped by history it
 

3899
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:37,669
never want to get trapped by history it
doesn't mean you discard history or

3900
01:23:37,669 --> 01:23:37,679
doesn't mean you discard history or
 

3901
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:40,590
doesn't mean you discard history or
ignore it there's so much value in what

01:23:40,590 --> 01:23:40,600
ignore it there's so much value in what
 

3903
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:43,750
ignore it there's so much value in what
has worked in the past and but you can't

3904
01:23:43,750 --> 01:23:43,760
has worked in the past and but you can't
 

3905
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:46,310
has worked in the past and but you can't
be blindly following what you've done

a simple answer as you're saying there
 

3917
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:00,030

01:24:19,709 --> 01:24:19,719
velocity decision making so we talked
 

3935
01:24:19,719 --> 01:24:21,990
velocity decision making so we talked
about High Velocity decision making

about High Velocity decision making
 

3937
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,709
about High Velocity decision making
that's more difficult than it

3938
01:24:23,709 --> 01:24:23,719
that's more difficult than it
 

3939
01:24:23,719 --> 01:24:26,629
that's more difficult than it
sounds so maybe you can pick one that

01:24:26,629 --> 01:24:26,639
sounds so maybe you can pick one that

two well you know I'll talk about

3950
01:24:38,110 --> 01:24:38,120
two well you know I'll talk about
 

3951
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:39,830
two well you know I'll talk about
because I think it's the one that is

01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:39,840
because I think it's the one that is
 

3953
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:43,510
because I think it's the one that is
maybe in some ways the hardest to

maybe in some ways the hardest to

01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:48,430
maybe in some ways the hardest to

understand um is the skeptical view of

01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:50,590
understand um is the skeptical view of

01:24:50,590 --> 01:24:50,600
proxies um one of the things that
 

3959
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:53,390
proxies um one of the things that
happens in business probably anything

3960
01:24:53,390 --> 01:24:53,400
happens in business probably anything
 

3961
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:55,790
happens in business probably anything
that you're where you're you know you

3962
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:55,800
that you're where you're you know you
 

3963
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:58,550
that you're where you're you know you
have an ongoing program and something is

3964
01:24:58,550 --> 01:24:58,560
have an ongoing program and something is
 

3965
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:01,870
have an ongoing program and something is
is underway for a number of years is you

3966
01:25:01,870 --> 01:25:01,880
is underway for a number of years is you
 

3967
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:03,750
is underway for a number of years is you
develop certain things that you're

3968
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:03,760
develop certain things that you're
 

3969
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:05,870
develop certain things that you're
managing to like let's say the typical

3970
01:25:05,870 --> 01:25:05,880
managing to like let's say the typical
 

3971
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:07,070
managing to like let's say the typical
case would be a

3972
01:25:07,070 --> 01:25:07,080
case would be a
 

3973
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:10,629
case would be a
metric and that metric isn't the real

3974
01:25:10,629 --> 01:25:10,639
metric and that metric isn't the real
 

3975
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:11,990
metric and that metric isn't the real
underlying

3976
01:25:11,990 --> 01:25:12,000
underlying
 

3977
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,109
underlying
thing and so uh you know maybe the

3978
01:25:15,109 --> 01:25:15,119
thing and so uh you know maybe the
 

3979
01:25:15,119 --> 01:25:19,149
thing and so uh you know maybe the
metric is um efficiency metric around

3980
01:25:19,149 --> 01:25:19,159
metric is um efficiency metric around
 

3981
01:25:19,159 --> 01:25:21,790
metric is um efficiency metric around
customer contacts per unit sold or

customer contacts per unit sold or
 

3983
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:24,229
customer contacts per unit sold or
something like if you sell a million

3984
01:25:24,229 --> 01:25:24,239
something like if you sell a million
 

3985
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:26,430
something like if you sell a million
units how many customer contacts do you

3986
01:25:26,430 --> 01:25:26,440
units how many customer contacts do you
 

3987
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:28,350
units how many customer contacts do you
get or how many returns do you get and

3988
01:25:28,350 --> 01:25:28,360
get or how many returns do you get and
 

3989
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:31,310
get or how many returns do you get and
so on and so on and so what happens is a

3990
01:25:31,310 --> 01:25:31,320
so on and so on and so what happens is a
 

3991
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:34,229
so on and so on and so what happens is a
little bit of a kind of inertia sets

3992
01:25:34,229 --> 01:25:34,239
little bit of a kind of inertia sets
 

3993

in where somebody a long time ago
 

3995
01:25:38,159 --> 01:25:40,830
in where somebody a long time ago
invented that metric and they invented

3996
01:25:40,830 --> 01:25:40,840
invented that metric and they invented
 

3997
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:42,590
invented that metric and they invented
that metric they decided we need to

3998
01:25:42,590 --> 01:25:42,600
that metric they decided we need to

watch for you know customer returns per

4000
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:46,760
watch for you know customer returns per

01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:50,109
watch for you know customer returns per
unit sold as an important metric but

4002
01:25:50,109 --> 01:25:50,119
unit sold as an important metric but
 

4003
01:25:50,119 --> 01:25:52,310
unit sold as an important metric but
they had a reason why they chose that

4004
01:25:52,310 --> 01:25:52,320
they had a reason why they chose that
 

4005
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,790
they had a reason why they chose that
that metric the person who invented that

01:25:54,790 --> 01:25:54,800
that metric the person who invented that
 

4007
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:57,629
that metric the person who invented that
metric and decided it was worth watching

4008
01:25:57,629 --> 01:25:57,639
metric and decided it was worth watching
 

4009
01:25:57,639 --> 01:25:59,510
metric and decided it was worth watching
and then fast forward five years that

and then fast forward five years that
 

4011
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:02,390

case it's a proxy for customer

01:26:13,550 --> 01:26:13,560
actually customer happiness it's a proxy
 

4023
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:16,390
actually customer happiness it's a proxy
for customer happiness the person who

4024
01:26:16,390 --> 01:26:16,400
for customer happiness the person who
 

4025
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:19,310
for customer happiness the person who
invented the metric understood that

4026
01:26:19,310 --> 01:26:19,320
invented the metric understood that
 

4027
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:23,149
invented the metric understood that
connection five years later

4028
01:26:23,149 --> 01:26:23,159
connection five years later
 

4029
01:26:23,159 --> 01:26:27,189
connection five years later
it a kind of inertia can set in and you

4030
01:26:27,189 --> 01:26:27,199
it a kind of inertia can set in and you
 

4031
01:26:27,199 --> 01:26:29,910
it a kind of inertia can set in and you
forget the truth behind why you were

4032
01:26:29,910 --> 01:26:29,920
forget the truth behind why you were
 

4033
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:31,950
forget the truth behind why you were
watching that metric in the first place

4034
01:26:31,950 --> 01:26:31,960
watching that metric in the first place
 

4035
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:34,870
watching that metric in the first place
and the world shifts a little yeah and

4036
01:26:34,870 --> 01:26:34,880
and the world shifts a little yeah and
 

4037
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:37,590
and the world shifts a little yeah and
now that proxy isn't as valuable as it

4038
01:26:37,590 --> 01:26:37,600
now that proxy isn't as valuable as it
 

4039
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:40,510
now that proxy isn't as valuable as it
used to be or it's missing something and

4040
01:26:40,510 --> 01:26:40,520
used to be or it's missing something and
 

4041
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:42,470
used to be or it's missing something and
you have to be on alert for that you

4042
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:42,480
you have to be on alert for that you
 

4043
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:45,030
you have to be on alert for that you
have to know okay this is I don't really

4044
01:26:45,030 --> 01:26:45,040
have to know okay this is I don't really
 

4045
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,270
have to know okay this is I don't really
care about this metric I care about

4046
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:47,280
care about this metric I care about
 

4047
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:48,669
care about this metric I care about
customer

4048
01:26:48,669 --> 01:26:48,679
customer
 

4049
01:26:48,679 --> 01:26:53,350
customer
happiness and this metric is worth

4050
01:26:53,350 --> 01:26:53,360
happiness and this metric is worth
 

4051
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:55,430
happiness and this metric is worth
putting energy into and following and

4052
01:26:55,430 --> 01:26:55,440
putting energy into and following and
 

4053
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:59,430
putting energy into and following and
improving and scrutinizing only in so

4054
01:26:59,430 --> 01:26:59,440
improving and scrutinizing only in so
 

4055
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:02,149
improving and scrutinizing only in so
much as it actually affects customer

4056
01:27:02,149 --> 01:27:02,159
much as it actually affects customer
 

4057
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:04,229
much as it actually affects customer
happiness and so you got to constantly

4058
01:27:04,229 --> 01:27:04,239
happiness and so you got to constantly
 

4059
01:27:04,239 --> 01:27:06,790
happiness and so you got to constantly
be on guard and it's very very common

4060
01:27:06,790 --> 01:27:06,800
be on guard and it's very very common
 

4061
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:09,790
be on guard and it's very very common
this is a nuanced problem it's very

4062
01:27:09,790 --> 01:27:09,800
this is a nuanced problem it's very
 

4063
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:12,550
this is a nuanced problem it's very
common especially in large companies

4064
01:27:12,550 --> 01:27:12,560
common especially in large companies
 

4065
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,910
common especially in large companies
that they are managing to metrics that

4066
01:27:14,910 --> 01:27:14,920
that they are managing to metrics that
 

4067
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:17,310
that they are managing to metrics that
they don't really understand they don't

4068
01:27:17,310 --> 01:27:17,320
they don't really understand they don't
 

4069
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:19,950
they don't really understand they don't
really know why they exist and the world

4070
01:27:19,950 --> 01:27:19,960
really know why they exist and the world
 

4071
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:21,550
really know why they exist and the world
may have shifted out from under them a

4072
01:27:21,550 --> 01:27:21,560
may have shifted out from under them a
 

4073
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:23,669
may have shifted out from under them a
little and the metrics are no longer as

4074
01:27:23,669 --> 01:27:23,679
little and the metrics are no longer as
 

4075
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:26,629
little and the metrics are no longer as
relevant as they were when somebody 10

4076
01:27:26,629 --> 01:27:26,639
relevant as they were when somebody 10
 

4077
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:29,629
relevant as they were when somebody 10
years earlier invented the metric that

4078
01:27:29,629 --> 01:27:29,639
years earlier invented the metric that
 

4079
01:27:29,639 --> 01:27:33,350
years earlier invented the metric that
is a Nuance but uh that's a big problem

4080
01:27:33,350 --> 01:27:33,360
is a Nuance but uh that's a big problem
 

4081
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:36,189
is a Nuance but uh that's a big problem
right there's something so compelling to

4082
01:27:36,189 --> 01:27:36,199
right there's something so compelling to
 

4083
01:27:36,199 --> 01:27:38,750
right there's something so compelling to
have a nice metric to try to optimize

4084
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:38,760
have a nice metric to try to optimize
 

4085
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:41,030
have a nice metric to try to optimize
yes and by the way you do need metrics

4086
01:27:41,030 --> 01:27:41,040
yes and by the way you do need metrics
 

4087
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:42,629
yes and by the way you do need metrics
yes you do you know you can't ignore

4088
01:27:42,629 --> 01:27:42,639
yes you do you know you can't ignore
 

4089
01:27:42,639 --> 01:27:45,350
yes you do you know you can't ignore
them um you want them but you just have

4090
01:27:45,350 --> 01:27:45,360
them um you want them but you just have
 

4091
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:48,550
them um you want them but you just have
to be constantly on guard this is you

4092
01:27:48,550 --> 01:27:48,560
to be constantly on guard this is you
 

4093
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:51,070
to be constantly on guard this is you
know a a way to slip into day two

4094
01:27:51,070 --> 01:27:51,080
know a a way to slip into day two
 

4095
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:52,910
know a a way to slip into day two
thinking would be to manage your

4096
01:27:52,910 --> 01:27:52,920
thinking would be to manage your
 

4097
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:55,350
thinking would be to manage your
business to metrics that you don't

4098
01:27:55,350 --> 01:27:55,360
business to metrics that you don't
 

4099
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,470
business to metrics that you don't
really understand and you're not really

4100
01:27:57,470 --> 01:27:57,480
really understand and you're not really
 

4101
01:27:57,480 --> 01:27:59,189
really understand and you're not really
sure why they were invented in the first

4102
01:27:59,189 --> 01:27:59,199
sure why they were invented in the first
 

4103
01:27:59,199 --> 01:28:00,830
sure why they were invented in the first
place and you're not sure they're still

4104
01:28:00,830 --> 01:28:00,840
place and you're not sure they're still
 

4105
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:03,189
place and you're not sure they're still
as relevant as they used to be uh what

4106
01:28:03,189 --> 01:28:03,199
as relevant as they used to be uh what
 

4107
01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:05,910
as relevant as they used to be uh what
does it take to be the guy or gal who

4108
01:28:05,910 --> 01:28:05,920
does it take to be the guy or gal who
 

4109
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:08,189
does it take to be the guy or gal who
who uh who brings up the point that this

4110
01:28:08,189 --> 01:28:08,199
who uh who brings up the point that this
 

4111
01:28:08,199 --> 01:28:10,350
who uh who brings up the point that this
proxy might be outdated I guess what

4112
01:28:10,350 --> 01:28:10,360
proxy might be outdated I guess what
 

4113
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:12,830
proxy might be outdated I guess what
does it take to have a culture that

4114
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:12,840
does it take to have a culture that
 

4115
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,590
does it take to have a culture that
enables that in the meeting because

4116
01:28:14,590 --> 01:28:14,600
enables that in the meeting because
 

4117
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:16,149
enables that in the meeting because
that's a very uncomfortable thing to

4118
01:28:16,149 --> 01:28:16,159
that's a very uncomfortable thing to
 

4119
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:18,709
that's a very uncomfortable thing to
bring up at a meeting we all showed up

4120
01:28:18,709 --> 01:28:18,719
bring up at a meeting we all showed up

bring up at a meeting we all showed up
here Friday this is such you have just

01:28:59,350 --> 01:28:59,360
teller you might get clubbed to death in
 

4137
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:02,990

the middle of the night truths are often

4138
01:29:02,990 --> 01:29:03,000
the middle of the night truths are often
 

4139
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,669
the middle of the night truths are often
they don't want to be heard because

4140
01:29:05,669 --> 01:29:05,679
they don't want to be heard because
 

4141
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:09,669
they don't want to be heard because
important truths can be um uncomfortable

4142
01:29:09,669 --> 01:29:09,679
important truths can be um uncomfortable
 

4143
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:11,709
important truths can be um uncomfortable
they can be awkward they can be

truthtellah tell people it's not what
we're designed to do as humans it's not

we're designed to do as humans it's not
 

4169
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,470
we're designed to do as humans it's not
really it's kind of a side effect you

4170
01:29:59,470 --> 01:29:59,480
really it's kind of a side effect you
 

4171
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:01,750
really it's kind of a side effect you
know we can do that but it's not how we

4172
01:30:01,750 --> 01:30:01,760
know we can do that but it's not how we
 

4173
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:03,830
know we can do that but it's not how we
survive we mostly Survive by being

social animals um and being cordial and
 

4177
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:09,590
social animals um and being cordial and
cooperative and um that's really

4178
01:30:09,590 --> 01:30:09,600
cooperative and um that's really
 

4179
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:12,870
cooperative and um that's really
important and so there's a you know

4180
01:30:12,870 --> 01:30:12,880
important and so there's a you know
 

4181
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,750
important and so there's a you know
science is all about truth telling it's

4182
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:14,760
science is all about truth telling it's
 

4183
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:20,109
science is all about truth telling it's
actually a very formal mechanism for

4184
01:30:20,109 --> 01:30:20,119
actually a very formal mechanism for
 

4185
01:30:20,119 --> 01:30:22,990
actually a very formal mechanism for
trying to tell the truth and even in

4186
01:30:22,990 --> 01:30:23,000
trying to tell the truth and even in
 

4187
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,030
trying to tell the truth and even in
science you find that it's hard to tell

4188
01:30:26,030 --> 01:30:26,040
science you find that it's hard to tell
 

4189
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:29,550
science you find that it's hard to tell
the truth right H even you know you're

4190
01:30:29,550 --> 01:30:29,560
the truth right H even you know you're
 

4191
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:31,750
the truth right H even you know you're
supposed to have a hypothesis and test

4192
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:31,760
supposed to have a hypothesis and test
 

4193
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,430
supposed to have a hypothesis and test
it and find data and reject the

4194
01:30:33,430 --> 01:30:33,440
it and find data and reject the
 

4195
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:36,830
it and find data and reject the
hypothesis and so on it's not easy but

4196
01:30:36,830 --> 01:30:36,840
hypothesis and so on it's not easy but
 

4197
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:39,550
hypothesis and so on it's not easy but
even in science there's like the senior

4198
01:30:39,550 --> 01:30:39,560
even in science there's like the senior
 

4199
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:41,629
even in science there's like the senior
scientists and the junior scientist and

4200
01:30:41,629 --> 01:30:41,639
scientists and the junior scientist and
 

4201
01:30:41,639 --> 01:30:44,310
scientists and the junior scientist and
then there's a hierarchy of humans where

4202
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:44,320
then there's a hierarchy of humans where
 

4203
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:47,950
then there's a hierarchy of humans where
the seniority somehow seniority matters

4204
01:30:47,950 --> 01:30:47,960
the seniority somehow seniority matters
 

4205
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:49,990
the seniority somehow seniority matters
in the scientific process which is and

4206
01:30:49,990 --> 01:30:50,000
in the scientific process which is and
 

4207
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,550
in the scientific process which is and
that's true inside companies too so you

4208
01:30:52,550 --> 01:30:52,560
that's true inside companies too so you
 

4209
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:56,109
that's true inside companies too so you
want to set up your culture so that the

4210
01:30:56,109 --> 01:30:56,119
want to set up your culture so that the
 

4211
01:30:56,119 --> 01:30:57,790
want to set up your culture so that the
most Junior

4212
01:30:57,790 --> 01:30:57,800
most Junior
 

4213
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:01,550
most Junior
person can overrule the most senior

4214
01:31:01,550 --> 01:31:01,560
person can overrule the most senior
 

4215
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:06,270
person can overrule the most senior
person if they have data um and and and

4216
01:31:06,270 --> 01:31:06,280
person if they have data um and and and
 

4217
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:09,030
person if they have data um and and and
that really is about trying to you know

4218
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:09,040
that really is about trying to you know
 

4219
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,629
that really is about trying to you know
there are little things you can do so

4220
01:31:10,629 --> 01:31:10,639
there are little things you can do so
 

4221
01:31:10,639 --> 01:31:12,629
there are little things you can do so
for example in every meeting that I

4222
01:31:12,629 --> 01:31:12,639
for example in every meeting that I
 

4223
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:15,310
for example in every meeting that I
attend I always speak

4224
01:31:15,310 --> 01:31:15,320
attend I always speak
 

4225
01:31:15,320 --> 01:31:19,109
attend I always speak
last and I know from

4226
01:31:19,109 --> 01:31:19,119
last and I know from
 

4227
01:31:19,119 --> 01:31:22,790
last and I know from
experience that you know

4228
01:31:22,790 --> 01:31:22,800
experience that you know
 

4229
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:26,149
experience that you know
if I speak first even

4230
01:31:26,149 --> 01:31:26,159
if I speak first even
 

4231
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:28,109
if I speak first even

judgment participants in that meeting

4236
01:31:34,830 --> 01:31:34,840
judgment participants in that meeting
 

4237
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:39,030
judgment participants in that meeting
will wonder well if Jeff thinks that I

will wonder well if Jeff thinks that I

01:31:41,149 --> 01:31:41,159
came in this meeting thinking one thing
 

4241
01:31:41,159 --> 01:31:45,629
came in this meeting thinking one thing
but maybe I'm not right and so you can

4242
01:31:45,629 --> 01:31:45,639
but maybe I'm not right and so you can
 

4243
01:31:45,639 --> 01:31:47,750
but maybe I'm not right and so you can
do little things like if you're the most

01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:47,760
do little things like if you're the most
 

4245

then try to go in order of
 

4255
01:32:01,239 --> 01:32:04,270
then try to go in order of
seniority um so that you can hear

4256
01:32:04,270 --> 01:32:04,280
seniority um so that you can hear
 

4257
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:06,030
seniority um so that you can hear
everyone's opinion in a kind of

sometimes you don't even have strong

data but you may know you may know the

to say you know something about that
 

4297
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:57,950
to say you know something about that
feels right let's go collect some data

4298
01:32:57,950 --> 01:32:57,960
feels right let's go collect some data
 

4299
01:32:57,960 --> 01:33:00,590
feels right let's go collect some data
on that let's try to see if we can

4300
01:33:00,590 --> 01:33:00,600
on that let's try to see if we can
 

4301
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:03,109
on that let's try to see if we can
actually know whether it's right but for

4302
01:33:03,109 --> 01:33:03,119
actually know whether it's right but for
 

4303
01:33:03,119 --> 01:33:05,390
actually know whether it's right but for
now let's not disregard it because it

4304
01:33:05,390 --> 01:33:05,400
now let's not disregard it because it
 

4305
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:07,990
now let's not disregard it because it
feels right you can also fight inherent

bias there's an optimism bias like if

4308
01:33:10,790 --> 01:33:10,800
bias there's an optimism bias like if
 

4309
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:12,870

there are two interpretations of a new

there are two interpretations of a new
 

4311
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:15,950
there are two interpretations of a new
set of data and one of them is happy and

4312
01:33:15,950 --> 01:33:15,960
set of data and one of them is happy and

one of them is
 

4315
01:33:17,159 --> 01:33:19,750
one of them is
unhappy it's a little dangerous to jump

unhappy it's a little dangerous to jump
 

4317
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:21,030
unhappy it's a little dangerous to jump
to the conclusion that the happy

4318
01:33:21,030 --> 01:33:21,040
to the conclusion that the happy
 

4319
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:23,990
to the conclusion that the happy
interpretation is right you may want to

4320
01:33:23,990 --> 01:33:24,000
interpretation is right you may want to
 

4321
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,149
interpretation is right you may want to
sort of compensate for that human bias

4322
01:33:27,149 --> 01:33:27,159
sort of compensate for that human bias
 

4323
01:33:27,159 --> 01:33:29,189
sort of compensate for that human bias
of of looking for you know trying to

of of looking for you know trying to
 

4325
01:33:29,199 --> 01:33:31,510
of of looking for you know trying to
find the silver lining and said look

find the silver lining and said look
 

4327
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:33,430
find the silver lining and said look
this that might be good but I'm going to

this that might be good but I'm going to
 

4329
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:35,430
this that might be good but I'm going to
go with it's bad for now until we're

4330
01:33:35,430 --> 01:33:35,440
go with it's bad for now until we're
 

4331
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:39,270
go with it's bad for now until we're

times yeah this is very early in the

4346
01:33:59,229 --> 01:33:59,239
times yeah this is very early in the
 

4347
01:33:59,239 --> 01:34:02,950
times yeah this is very early in the
history of Amazon and uh we were going

4348
01:34:02,950 --> 01:34:02,960
history of Amazon and uh we were going
 

4349
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:05,109
history of Amazon and uh we were going
over a weekly Business review and a set

4350
01:34:05,109 --> 01:34:05,119
over a weekly Business review and a set
 

4351
01:34:05,119 --> 01:34:08,669
over a weekly Business review and a set
of documents and I have I have a saying

4352
01:34:08,669 --> 01:34:08,679
of documents and I have I have a saying
 

4353
01:34:08,679 --> 01:34:11,149
of documents and I have I have a saying
which is when the data and the anecdotes

4354
01:34:11,149 --> 01:34:11,159
which is when the data and the anecdotes
 

4355
01:34:11,159 --> 01:34:14,669
which is when the data and the anecdotes
disagree the anecdotes are usually right

4356
01:34:14,669 --> 01:34:14,679
disagree the anecdotes are usually right
 

4357
01:34:14,679 --> 01:34:16,950
disagree the anecdotes are usually right
and and it doesn't mean you just

4358
01:34:16,950 --> 01:34:16,960
and and it doesn't mean you just
 

4359
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:18,669
and and it doesn't mean you just
slavishly go follow the anecdotes then

4360
01:34:18,669 --> 01:34:18,679
slavishly go follow the anecdotes then
 

4361
01:34:18,679 --> 01:34:20,910
slavishly go follow the anecdotes then
it means you go examine the data because

4362
01:34:20,910 --> 01:34:20,920
it means you go examine the data because
 

4363
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:22,590
it means you go examine the data because
the dat and it's usually not that the

4364
01:34:22,590 --> 01:34:22,600
the dat and it's usually not that the
 

4365
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:26,390
the dat and it's usually not that the
data is being um misc collected it's

4366
01:34:26,390 --> 01:34:26,400
data is being um misc collected it's
 

4367
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,470
data is being um misc collected it's
usually that you're not measuring the

4368
01:34:28,470 --> 01:34:28,480
usually that you're not measuring the
 

4369
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:31,310
usually that you're not measuring the
right thing and so you know if you have

4370
01:34:31,310 --> 01:34:31,320
right thing and so you know if you have
 

4371
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:33,629
right thing and so you know if you have
a bunch of customers complaining about

4372
01:34:33,629 --> 01:34:33,639
a bunch of customers complaining about
 

4373
01:34:33,639 --> 01:34:36,870
a bunch of customers complaining about
something and at the same time you know

4374
01:34:36,870 --> 01:34:36,880
something and at the same time you know
 

4375
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:38,990
something and at the same time you know
your metrics look like why they

4376
01:34:38,990 --> 01:34:39,000
your metrics look like why they
 

4377
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:42,070
your metrics look like why they
shouldn't be complaining um you should

4378
01:34:42,070 --> 01:34:42,080
shouldn't be complaining um you should
 

4379
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:45,590
shouldn't be complaining um you should
doubt the metrics and an early uh

4380
01:34:45,590 --> 01:34:45,600
doubt the metrics and an early uh
 

4381
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:48,990
doubt the metrics and an early uh
example of this was we had metrics that

4382
01:34:48,990 --> 01:34:49,000
example of this was we had metrics that
 

4383
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,790
example of this was we had metrics that
showed that our customers were waiting I

4384
01:34:51,790 --> 01:34:51,800
showed that our customers were waiting I
 

4385
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:54,189
showed that our customers were waiting I
think less than I don't know 60 seconds

4386
01:34:54,189 --> 01:34:54,199
think less than I don't know 60 seconds
 

4387
01:34:54,199 --> 01:34:56,430
think less than I don't know 60 seconds
when they called a 1 1800 number to get

4388
01:34:56,430 --> 01:34:56,440
when they called a 1 1800 number to get
 

4389
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:59,430
when they called a 1 1800 number to get
am you know phone customer service the

4390
01:34:59,430 --> 01:34:59,440
am you know phone customer service the
 

4391
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:01,229
am you know phone customer service the
waight time was supposed to be less than

4392
01:35:01,229 --> 01:35:01,239
waight time was supposed to be less than
 

4393
01:35:01,239 --> 01:35:03,790
waight time was supposed to be less than
60 seconds and but we had a lot of

4394
01:35:03,790 --> 01:35:03,800
60 seconds and but we had a lot of
 

4395
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:06,430
60 seconds and but we had a lot of
complaints that it was longer than that

4396
01:35:06,430 --> 01:35:06,440
complaints that it was longer than that
 

4397
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:09,030
complaints that it was longer than that
and anecdotally it seemed longer than

4398
01:35:09,030 --> 01:35:09,040
and anecdotally it seemed longer than
 

4399
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:10,669
and anecdotally it seemed longer than
that like you know I would call customer

4400
01:35:10,669 --> 01:35:10,679
that like you know I would call customer
 

4401
01:35:10,679 --> 01:35:13,270
that like you know I would call customer
service myself and so one day we're in a

4402
01:35:13,270 --> 01:35:13,280
service myself and so one day we're in a
 

4403
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:15,790
service myself and so one day we're in a
meeting we're going to the wbr and the

4404
01:35:15,790 --> 01:35:15,800
meeting we're going to the wbr and the

01:35:21,590 --> 01:35:21,600
this metric in the deck and the guy who
 

4409
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,629
this metric in the deck and the guy who
leads customer service is to fit in the

4410
01:35:23,629 --> 01:35:23,639
leads customer service is to fit in the
 

4411
01:35:23,639 --> 01:35:28,510
leads customer service is to fit in the
metric and I said okay let's

4412
01:35:28,510 --> 01:35:28,520

 

4413
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:31,669

call picked up the phone and I dialed

4414
01:35:31,669 --> 01:35:31,679
call picked up the phone and I dialed
 

4415
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:33,830
call picked up the phone and I dialed
the 1800 number and called customer

4416
01:35:33,830 --> 01:35:33,840
the 1800 number and called customer
 

4417
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:37,950

4418
01:35:37,950 --> 01:35:37,960
service and we just waited in
 

4419
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:40,149
service and we just waited in
silence what did it turn out to be like

4420
01:35:40,149 --> 01:35:40,159
silence what did it turn out to be like
 

4421
01:35:40,159 --> 01:35:42,350
silence what did it turn out to be like
oh was really long more than 10 minutes

4422
01:35:42,350 --> 01:35:42,360
oh was really long more than 10 minutes
 

4423
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:44,390
oh was really long more than 10 minutes
I think oh wow I mean it was it was many

4424
01:35:44,390 --> 01:35:44,400
I think oh wow I mean it was it was many
 

4425
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:46,990
I think oh wow I mean it was it was many
minutes and so you know it dramatically

4426
01:35:46,990 --> 01:35:47,000
minutes and so you know it dramatically
 

4427
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,629
minutes and so you know it dramatically
made the point that something was wrong

4428
01:35:48,629 --> 01:35:48,639
made the point that something was wrong
 

4429
01:35:48,639 --> 01:35:50,669
made the point that something was wrong
with the data collection we weren't

4430
01:35:50,669 --> 01:35:50,679
with the data collection we weren't
 

4431
01:35:50,679 --> 01:35:52,669
with the data collection we weren't
measuring the right thing and and that

4432
01:35:52,669 --> 01:35:52,679
measuring the right thing and and that
 

4433
01:35:52,679 --> 01:35:54,070
measuring the right thing and and that
you know set off a whole chain of events

4434
01:35:54,070 --> 01:35:54,080
you know set off a whole chain of events
 

4435
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:56,109
you know set off a whole chain of events
where we start measuring it right and

4436
01:35:56,109 --> 01:35:56,119
where we start measuring it right and
 

4437
01:35:56,119 --> 01:35:59,390
where we start measuring it right and
that's an example by the way of of Truth

4438
01:35:59,390 --> 01:35:59,400
that's an example by the way of of Truth
 

4439
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:02,189
that's an example by the way of of Truth
telling is like that's an uncomfortable

4440
01:36:02,189 --> 01:36:02,199
telling is like that's an uncomfortable
 

4441
01:36:02,199 --> 01:36:05,590
telling is like that's an uncomfortable
thing to do yeah but it's but you have

4442
01:36:05,590 --> 01:36:05,600
thing to do yeah but it's but you have
 

4443
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:08,390
thing to do yeah but it's but you have
to seek truth even when it's

4444
01:36:08,390 --> 01:36:08,400
to seek truth even when it's
 

4445
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:09,830
to seek truth even when it's
uncomfortable and you have to get

4446
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:09,840
uncomfortable and you have to get
 

4447
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:11,590
uncomfortable and you have to get
people's attention and they have to buy

4448
01:36:11,590 --> 01:36:11,600
people's attention and they have to buy
 

4449
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:13,950
people's attention and they have to buy
into it and they have to get energized

4450
01:36:13,950 --> 01:36:13,960
into it and they have to get energized
 

4451
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:16,990
into it and they have to get energized
around really fixing things so that that

4452
01:36:16,990 --> 01:36:17,000
around really fixing things so that that
 

4453
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,470
around really fixing things so that that
speaks to the the obsession with the

4454
01:36:18,470 --> 01:36:18,480
speaks to the the obsession with the
 

4455
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:20,390
speaks to the the obsession with the
customer experience so one of the

4456
01:36:20,390 --> 01:36:20,400
customer experience so one of the
 

4457
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:21,830
customer experience so one of the
defining aspects

4458
01:36:21,830 --> 01:36:21,840
defining aspects
 

4459
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:24,510
defining aspects
of your approach to Amazon is just being

4460
01:36:24,510 --> 01:36:24,520
of your approach to Amazon is just being
 

4461
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:27,070
of your approach to Amazon is just being
obsessed with making customers happy I

4462
01:36:27,070 --> 01:36:27,080
obsessed with making customers happy I
 

4463
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:29,629
obsessed with making customers happy I
think uh companies sometimes say that

4464
01:36:29,629 --> 01:36:29,639
think uh companies sometimes say that
 

4465
01:36:29,639 --> 01:36:34,189
think uh companies sometimes say that
but Amazon is really obsessed with that

4466
01:36:34,189 --> 01:36:34,199
but Amazon is really obsessed with that
 

4467
01:36:34,199 --> 01:36:35,390
but Amazon is really obsessed with that
I think there's something really

4468
01:36:35,390 --> 01:36:35,400
I think there's something really
 

4469
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:37,669
I think there's something really
profound to that which is seeing the

4470
01:36:37,669 --> 01:36:37,679
profound to that which is seeing the

repercussions of this I fear but I think

01:43:38,430 --> 01:43:38,440
repercussions of this I fear but I think
 

4803
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:41,910
repercussions of this I fear but I think
one of the things that we've done online

4804
01:43:41,910 --> 01:43:41,920
one of the things that we've done online
 

4805
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:43,709
one of the things that we've done online
you know and largely because of social

4806
01:43:43,709 --> 01:43:43,719
you know and largely because of social
 

4807
01:43:43,719 --> 01:43:46,870
you know and largely because of social
media is we have trained our brains to

01:43:46,870 --> 01:43:46,880
media is we have trained our brains to
 

4809
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:49,669
media is we have trained our brains to
be really good at processing super short

face of this you know you you you do
 

4817
01:43:56,280 --> 01:44:00,229
face of this you know you you you do
these long format things and uh reading

4818
01:44:00,229 --> 01:44:00,239
these long format things and uh reading
 

4819
01:44:00,239 --> 01:44:03,109
these long format things and uh reading
reading books is a long format thing and

4820
01:44:03,109 --> 01:44:03,119
reading books is a long format thing and
 

4821
01:44:03,119 --> 01:44:06,870
reading books is a long format thing and
we all do more of if if you if something

4822
01:44:06,870 --> 01:44:06,880
we all do more of if if you if something
 

4823
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:09,790
we all do more of if if you if something
is convenient we do more of it and so

4824
01:44:09,790 --> 01:44:09,800
is convenient we do more of it and so
 

4825
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:11,910
is convenient we do more of it and so
when you make tools you know that we

4826
01:44:11,910 --> 01:44:11,920
when you make tools you know that we
 

4827
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:12,790
when you make tools you know that we
carry

4828
01:44:12,790 --> 01:44:12,800
carry
 

4829
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:15,350
carry
around um a little we carry around in

4830
01:44:15,350 --> 01:44:15,360
around um a little we carry around in
 

4831
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:18,070
around um a little we carry around in
our pocket a phone and one of the things

4832
01:44:18,070 --> 01:44:18,080
our pocket a phone and one of the things
 

4833
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:20,350
our pocket a phone and one of the things
that phone does for the most part is it

4834
01:44:20,350 --> 01:44:20,360
that phone does for the most part is it
 

4835
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:23,070
that phone does for the most part is it
is an attention shortening device

4836
01:44:23,070 --> 01:44:23,080
is an attention shortening device
 

4837
01:44:23,080 --> 01:44:24,830
is an attention shortening device
because most of the things we do on our

4838
01:44:24,830 --> 01:44:24,840
because most of the things we do on our
 

4839
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:27,870
because most of the things we do on our
phone shorten our attention spans and

4840
01:44:27,870 --> 01:44:27,880
phone shorten our attention spans and
 

4841
01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:29,270
phone shorten our attention spans and
I'm not even going to say we know for

4842
01:44:29,270 --> 01:44:29,280
I'm not even going to say we know for
 

4843
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:31,310
I'm not even going to say we know for
sure that that's bad but I do think it's

4844
01:44:31,310 --> 01:44:31,320
sure that that's bad but I do think it's
 

4845
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:32,430
sure that that's bad but I do think it's
happening it's one of the ways we're

4846
01:44:32,430 --> 01:44:32,440
happening it's one of the ways we're
 

4847
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:35,950
happening it's one of the ways we're
co-evolving with that tool but I think I

4848
01:44:35,950 --> 01:44:35,960
co-evolving with that tool but I think I
 

4849
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:37,709
co-evolving with that tool but I think I
think it's important to spend some of

4850
01:44:37,709 --> 01:44:37,719
think it's important to spend some of
 

4851
01:44:37,719 --> 01:44:39,669
think it's important to spend some of
your time and some of your life doing

4852
01:44:39,669 --> 01:44:39,679
your time and some of your life doing
 

4853
01:44:39,679 --> 01:44:43,149
your time and some of your life doing
long attention span things yeah I think

4854
01:44:43,149 --> 01:44:43,159
long attention span things yeah I think
 

4855
01:44:43,159 --> 01:44:44,589
long attention span things yeah I think
uh you've spoken about the value in your

4856
01:44:44,589 --> 01:44:44,599
uh you've spoken about the value in your
 

4857
01:44:44,599 --> 01:44:46,550
uh you've spoken about the value in your
own life of

4858
01:44:46,550 --> 01:44:46,560
own life of
 

4859
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:49,070

01:44:51,030 --> 01:44:51,040
prolonged periods of time and that's
 

4863
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:52,950
prolonged periods of time and that's
certainly what books do and that's

4864
01:44:52,950 --> 01:44:52,960
certainly what books do and that's
 

4865
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:54,350
certainly what books do and that's

01:44:54,350 --> 01:44:54,360
certainly what that piece of technology
 

4867
01:44:54,360 --> 01:44:56,790
certainly what that piece of technology
does but I bring all that up to to ask

4868
01:44:56,790 --> 01:44:56,800
does but I bring all that up to to ask
 

4869
01:44:56,800 --> 01:45:00,109
does but I bring all that up to to ask
you about another piece of technology

4870

01:47:08,109 --> 01:47:08,119
they're just they could just be very
 

4959
01:47:08,119 --> 01:47:09,270
they're just they could just be very
smart

4960
01:47:09,270 --> 01:47:09,280
smart
 

4961
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:11,270
smart
weapons

4962
01:47:11,270 --> 01:47:11,280
weapons
 

4963
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:14,229
weapons
um and so we have to think about all of

4964
01:47:14,229 --> 01:47:14,239
um and so we have to think about all of
 

4965
01:47:14,239 --> 01:47:16,550
um and so we have to think about all of
those

4966
01:47:16,550 --> 01:47:16,560
those
 

4967
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:20,070
those
things ju I'm very optimistic about this

4968
01:47:20,070 --> 01:47:20,080
things ju I'm very optimistic about this
 

4969
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:23,270
things ju I'm very optimistic about this
so so even in the face of all this

4970
01:47:23,270 --> 01:47:23,280
so so even in the face of all this
 

4971
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:27,709
so so even in the face of all this
uncertainty my own view is that that

4972
01:47:27,709 --> 01:47:27,719
uncertainty my own view is that that
 

4973
01:47:27,719 --> 01:47:31,550
uncertainty my own view is that that
these powerful tools are much more

4974
01:47:31,550 --> 01:47:31,560
these powerful tools are much more
 

4975
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:35,149
these powerful tools are much more
likely to help us and save us even than

4976
01:47:35,149 --> 01:47:35,159
likely to help us and save us even than
 

4977
01:47:35,159 --> 01:47:37,390
likely to help us and save us even than
they are to on balance hurt us and

4978
01:47:37,390 --> 01:47:37,400
they are to on balance hurt us and
 

4979
01:47:37,400 --> 01:47:40,350
they are to on balance hurt us and
destroy us I think you know we humans

4980
01:47:40,350 --> 01:47:40,360
destroy us I think you know we humans
 

4981
01:47:40,360 --> 01:47:43,229
destroy us I think you know we humans
have a lot of ways of um we can make

4982
01:47:43,229 --> 01:47:43,239
have a lot of ways of um we can make
 

4983
01:47:43,239 --> 01:47:45,470
have a lot of ways of um we can make
ourselves go extinct you know these

4984
01:47:45,470 --> 01:47:45,480
ourselves go extinct you know these
 

4985
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:47,950
ourselves go extinct you know these
things may help us not do that you know

4986
01:47:47,950 --> 01:47:47,960
things may help us not do that you know
 

4987
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:50,790
things may help us not do that you know
so we may actually they actually save us

4988
01:47:50,790 --> 01:47:50,800
so we may actually they actually save us
 

4989
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:53,270
so we may actually they actually save us
so the people who are you know overly

4990
01:47:53,270 --> 01:47:53,280
so the people who are you know overly
 

4991
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:55,870
so the people who are you know overly
concerned I in my view overly concerned

4992
01:47:55,870 --> 01:47:55,880
concerned I in my view overly concerned
 

4993
01:47:55,880 --> 01:47:59,629
concerned I in my view overly concerned
it's a valid debate um I I think that I

4994
01:47:59,629 --> 01:47:59,639
it's a valid debate um I I think that I
 

4995
01:47:59,639 --> 01:48:01,390
it's a valid debate um I I think that I
I think that they may be missing part of

4996
01:48:01,390 --> 01:48:01,400
I think that they may be missing part of
 

4997
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:03,310
I think that they may be missing part of
the equation which is how helpful they

4998
01:48:03,310 --> 01:48:03,320
the equation which is how helpful they
 

4999
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:05,790
the equation which is how helpful they
could be in making sure we don't destroy

5000
01:48:05,790 --> 01:48:05,800
could be in making sure we don't destroy
 

5001
01:48:05,800 --> 01:48:09,270
could be in making sure we don't destroy
ourselves um I don't know if you saw the

5002
01:48:09,270 --> 01:48:09,280
ourselves um I don't know if you saw the
 

5003
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:10,270
ourselves um I don't know if you saw the
movie

5004
01:48:10,270 --> 01:48:10,280
movie
 

5005
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:13,709
movie
Oppenheimer but to me I first of all I

5006
01:48:13,709 --> 01:48:13,719
Oppenheimer but to me I first of all I
 

5007
01:48:13,719 --> 01:48:15,990
Oppenheimer but to me I first of all I
loved the movie and I thought the best

5008
01:48:15,990 --> 01:48:16,000
loved the movie and I thought the best
 

5009
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:19,750
loved the movie and I thought the best
part of the movie is this bureaucrat

5010
01:48:19,750 --> 01:48:19,760
part of the movie is this bureaucrat
 

5011
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:22,629
part of the movie is this bureaucrat
played by Robert Downey Jr who you know

5012
01:48:22,629 --> 01:48:22,639
played by Robert Downey Jr who you know
 

5013
01:48:22,639 --> 01:48:23,750
played by Robert Downey Jr who you know
some of people have talked to think

5014
01:48:23,750 --> 01:48:23,760
some of people have talked to think
 

5015
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:25,790
some of people have talked to think
that's the most boring part of the movie

5016
01:48:25,790 --> 01:48:25,800
that's the most boring part of the movie
 

5017
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:28,510
that's the most boring part of the movie
I thought it was the most fascinating

5018
01:48:28,510 --> 01:48:28,520
I thought it was the most fascinating
 

5019
01:48:28,520 --> 01:48:31,229
I thought it was the most fascinating
because what's going on here is you

5020
01:48:31,229 --> 01:48:31,239
because what's going on here is you
 

5021
01:48:31,239 --> 01:48:35,430
because what's going on here is you
realize we have invented these awesome

5022
01:48:35,430 --> 01:48:35,440
realize we have invented these awesome
 

5023
01:48:35,440 --> 01:48:38,669
realize we have invented these awesome
destructive powerful Technologies called

5024
01:48:38,669 --> 01:48:38,679
destructive powerful Technologies called
 

5025
01:48:38,679 --> 01:48:39,669
destructive powerful Technologies called
nuclear

5026
01:48:39,669 --> 01:48:39,679
nuclear
 

5027
01:48:39,679 --> 01:48:43,229
nuclear
weapons and they are managed and you

5028
01:48:43,229 --> 01:48:43,239
weapons and they are managed and you
 

5029
01:48:43,239 --> 01:48:48,270
weapons and they are managed and you
know we we we humans are we're not

5030
01:48:48,270 --> 01:48:48,280
know we we we humans are we're not
 

5031
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:50,550
know we we we humans are we're not
really capable of wielding building

5032
01:48:50,550 --> 01:48:50,560
really capable of wielding building
 

5033
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:53,430
really capable of wielding building
those weapons yeah where you know that's

5034
01:48:53,430 --> 01:48:53,440
those weapons yeah where you know that's
 

5035
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:55,910
those weapons yeah where you know that's
what he represented in that movie is

5036
01:48:55,910 --> 01:48:55,920
what he represented in that movie is
 

5037
01:48:55,920 --> 01:49:00,709
what he represented in that movie is
here's this guy who is uh just he

5038
01:49:00,709 --> 01:49:00,719
here's this guy who is uh just he
 

5039
01:49:00,719 --> 01:49:03,310
here's this guy who is uh just he
wrongly thinks he's like being so petty

5040
01:49:03,310 --> 01:49:03,320
wrongly thinks he's like being so petty
 

5041
01:49:03,320 --> 01:49:04,950
wrongly thinks he's like being so petty
he thinks that he said something that

5042
01:49:04,950 --> 01:49:04,960
he thinks that he said something that
 

5043
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:06,669
he thinks that he said something that
Oppenheimer said something bad to

5044
01:49:06,669 --> 01:49:06,679
Oppenheimer said something bad to
 

5045
01:49:06,679 --> 01:49:08,750
Oppenheimer said something bad to
Einstein about him they didn't talk

5046
01:49:08,750 --> 01:49:08,760
Einstein about him they didn't talk
 

5047
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:10,390
Einstein about him they didn't talk
about him at all as you find out in the

5048
01:49:10,390 --> 01:49:10,400
about him at all as you find out in the
 

5049
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:12,709
about him at all as you find out in the
final scene of the movie and yet he

5050
01:49:12,709 --> 01:49:12,719
final scene of the movie and yet he
 

5051
01:49:12,719 --> 01:49:16,830
final scene of the movie and yet he
spent his career trying to be vengeful

5052
01:49:16,830 --> 01:49:16,840
spent his career trying to be vengeful
 

5053
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:20,830
spent his career trying to be vengeful
and uh and Petty and that's that's the

5054
01:49:20,830 --> 01:49:20,840
and uh and Petty and that's that's the
 

5055
01:49:20,840 --> 01:49:22,510
and uh and Petty and that's that's the
problem we as a

5056
01:49:22,510 --> 01:49:22,520
problem we as a
 

5057
01:49:22,520 --> 01:49:26,550
problem we as a
species are not

5058
01:49:26,550 --> 01:49:26,560
species are not
 

5059
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:30,109
species are not
really sophisticated enough and mature

5060
01:49:30,109 --> 01:49:30,119
really sophisticated enough and mature
 

5061
01:49:30,119 --> 01:49:32,589
really sophisticated enough and mature
enough to handle these Technologies and

5062
01:49:32,589 --> 01:49:32,599
enough to handle these Technologies and
 

5063
01:49:32,599 --> 01:49:35,149
enough to handle these Technologies and
so and and by the way before you get to

5064
01:49:35,149 --> 01:49:35,159
so and and by the way before you get to
 

5065
01:49:35,159 --> 01:49:37,790
so and and by the way before you get to
General Ai and the possibility of AI

5066
01:49:37,790 --> 01:49:37,800
General Ai and the possibility of AI
 

5067
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:39,510
General Ai and the possibility of AI
having agency and there's a lot of

5068
01:49:39,510 --> 01:49:39,520
having agency and there's a lot of
 

5069
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:41,870
having agency and there's a lot of
things would have to happen but um

5070
01:49:41,870 --> 01:49:41,880
things would have to happen but um
 

5071
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:43,390
things would have to happen but um
there's so much benefit that's going to

5072
01:49:43,390 --> 01:49:43,400
there's so much benefit that's going to
 

5073
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:45,270
there's so much benefit that's going to
come from these Technologies in the

5074
01:49:45,270 --> 01:49:45,280
come from these Technologies in the
 

5075
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:48,350
come from these Technologies in the
meantime even before their you know

5076
01:49:48,350 --> 01:49:48,360
meantime even before their you know
 

5077
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:50,950
meantime even before their you know
General AI in terms of better medicines

5078
01:49:50,950 --> 01:49:50,960
General AI in terms of better medicines
 

5079
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:53,910
General AI in terms of better medicines
and uh better tools to develop more

5080
01:49:53,910 --> 01:49:53,920
and uh better tools to develop more
 

5081
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:55,990
and uh better tools to develop more
Technologies and so on so I think it's

5082
01:49:55,990 --> 01:49:56,000
Technologies and so on so I think it's
 

5083
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,070
Technologies and so on so I think it's
an

5084
01:49:57,070 --> 01:49:57,080
an
 

5085
01:49:57,080 --> 01:50:00,189
an
incredible moment to be alive and to

5086
01:50:00,189 --> 01:50:00,199
incredible moment to be alive and to
 

5087
01:50:00,199 --> 01:50:01,990
incredible moment to be alive and to
witness the Transformations that are

5088
01:50:01,990 --> 01:50:02,000
witness the Transformations that are
 

5089
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,669
witness the Transformations that are
going to happen how quickly will happen

5090
01:50:03,669 --> 01:50:03,679
going to happen how quickly will happen
 

5091
01:50:03,679 --> 01:50:05,310
going to happen how quickly will happen
no one knows but over the next 10 years

5092
01:50:05,310 --> 01:50:05,320
no one knows but over the next 10 years
 

5093
01:50:05,320 --> 01:50:07,790
no one knows but over the next 10 years
and 20 years I think we're going to see

5094
01:50:07,790 --> 01:50:07,800
and 20 years I think we're going to see
 

5095
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:10,390
and 20 years I think we're going to see
really remarkable advances and I

5096
01:50:10,390 --> 01:50:10,400
really remarkable advances and I
 

5097
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:12,510
really remarkable advances and I
personally am very excited about it

5098
01:50:12,510 --> 01:50:12,520
personally am very excited about it
 

5099
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:13,830
personally am very excited about it
first of all really interesting to say

5100
01:50:13,830 --> 01:50:13,840
first of all really interesting to say
 

5101
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:17,070
first of all really interesting to say
that it's discoveries that it's true

5102
01:50:17,070 --> 01:50:17,080
that it's discoveries that it's true
 

5103
01:50:17,080 --> 01:50:21,430
that it's discoveries that it's true
that we don't know the limits of what's

5104
01:50:21,430 --> 01:50:21,440
that we don't know the limits of what's
 

5105
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:23,270
that we don't know the limits of what's
possible with the current language

5106
01:50:23,270 --> 01:50:23,280
possible with the current language
 

5107
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:26,470
possible with the current language
models we don't and like it could be a

5108
01:50:26,470 --> 01:50:26,480
models we don't and like it could be a
 

5109
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:29,229
models we don't and like it could be a
few tricks and hacks here and there that

5110
01:50:29,229 --> 01:50:29,239
few tricks and hacks here and there that
 

5111
01:50:29,239 --> 01:50:32,390
few tricks and hacks here and there that
that uh open doors to hold entire new

5112
01:50:32,390 --> 01:50:32,400
that uh open doors to hold entire new
 

5113
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:35,030
that uh open doors to hold entire new
possibilities we do know that humans are

5114
01:50:35,030 --> 01:50:35,040
possibilities we do know that humans are
 

5115
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:36,750
possibilities we do know that humans are
doing something

5116
01:50:36,750 --> 01:50:36,760
doing something
 

5117
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:41,189
doing something
different um from these models in part

5118
01:50:41,189 --> 01:50:41,199
different um from these models in part
 

5119
01:50:41,199 --> 01:50:43,470
different um from these models in part
because you know we're so power

5120
01:50:43,470 --> 01:50:43,480
because you know we're so power
 

5121
01:50:43,480 --> 01:50:46,030
because you know we're so power
efficient you know the human brain does

5122
01:50:46,030 --> 01:50:46,040
efficient you know the human brain does
 

5123
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:49,510
efficient you know the human brain does
remarkable things and it does it on

5124
01:50:49,510 --> 01:50:49,520
remarkable things and it does it on
 

5125
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:53,510
remarkable things and it does it on
about 20 watts of power and you know uh

5126
01:50:53,510 --> 01:50:53,520
about 20 watts of power and you know uh
 

5127
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:55,950
about 20 watts of power and you know uh
the the AI techniques we use today use

5128
01:50:55,950 --> 01:50:55,960
the the AI techniques we use today use
 

5129
01:50:55,960 --> 01:50:58,069
the the AI techniques we use today use
many kilowatts of power to do equivalent

5130
01:50:58,069 --> 01:50:58,079
many kilowatts of power to do equivalent
 

5131
01:50:58,079 --> 01:51:00,310
many kilowatts of power to do equivalent
tasks so there's something interesting

5132
01:51:00,310 --> 01:51:00,320
tasks so there's something interesting
 

5133
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:02,510
tasks so there's something interesting
about the way the human brain does this

5134
01:51:02,510 --> 01:51:02,520
about the way the human brain does this
 

5135
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:04,589
about the way the human brain does this
and also we don't need as much data so

5136
01:51:04,589 --> 01:51:04,599
and also we don't need as much data so
 

5137
01:51:04,599 --> 01:51:08,030
and also we don't need as much data so
you know like self-driving cars are they

5138
01:51:08,030 --> 01:51:08,040
you know like self-driving cars are they
 

5139
01:51:08,040 --> 01:51:09,830
you know like self-driving cars are they
have to drive billions and billions of

5140
01:51:09,830 --> 01:51:09,840
have to drive billions and billions of
 

5141
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:12,510
have to drive billions and billions of
miles to try and to learn how to drive

5142
01:51:12,510 --> 01:51:12,520
miles to try and to learn how to drive
 

5143
01:51:12,520 --> 01:51:15,229
miles to try and to learn how to drive
and you know your average 16-year-old uh

5144
01:51:15,229 --> 01:51:15,239
and you know your average 16-year-old uh
 

5145
01:51:15,239 --> 01:51:16,790
and you know your average 16-year-old uh
figures it

5146
01:51:16,790 --> 01:51:16,800
figures it
 

5147
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:20,350
figures it
out with many fewer miles so there are

5148
01:51:20,350 --> 01:51:20,360
out with many fewer miles so there are
 

5149
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:22,830
out with many fewer miles so there are
still some tricks I think that we have

5150
01:51:22,830 --> 01:51:22,840
still some tricks I think that we have
 

5151
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:24,910
still some tricks I think that we have
yet to learn I don't think we've learned

5152
01:51:24,910 --> 01:51:24,920
yet to learn I don't think we've learned
 

5153
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:26,830
yet to learn I don't think we've learned
the last trick I don't think it's just a

5154
01:51:26,830 --> 01:51:26,840
the last trick I don't think it's just a
 

5155
01:51:26,840 --> 01:51:30,510
the last trick I don't think it's just a
question of scaling things up um but

5156
01:51:30,510 --> 01:51:30,520
question of scaling things up um but
 

5157
01:51:30,520 --> 01:51:32,709
question of scaling things up um but
what's interesting is that just scaling

5158
01:51:32,709 --> 01:51:32,719
what's interesting is that just scaling
 

5159
01:51:32,719 --> 01:51:34,550
what's interesting is that just scaling
things up and I put just in quotes

5160
01:51:34,550 --> 01:51:34,560
things up and I put just in quotes
 

5161
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:35,709
things up and I put just in quotes
because it's actually hard to scale

5162
01:51:35,709 --> 01:51:35,719
because it's actually hard to scale
 

5163
01:51:35,719 --> 01:51:37,950
because it's actually hard to scale
things up but just scaling things up

5164
01:51:37,950 --> 01:51:37,960
things up but just scaling things up
 

5165
01:51:37,960 --> 01:51:40,589
things up but just scaling things up
also appears to pay huge dividends yeah

5166
01:51:40,589 --> 01:51:40,599
also appears to pay huge dividends yeah
 

5167
01:51:40,599 --> 01:51:42,629
also appears to pay huge dividends yeah
and and it's there's some more nuanced

5168
01:51:42,629 --> 01:51:42,639
and and it's there's some more nuanced
 

5169
01:51:42,639 --> 01:51:44,310
and and it's there's some more nuanced
aspect about human beings that's

5170
01:51:44,310 --> 01:51:44,320
aspect about human beings that's
 

5171
01:51:44,320 --> 01:51:46,069
aspect about human beings that's
interesting if it's able to accomplish

5172
01:51:46,069 --> 01:51:46,079
interesting if it's able to accomplish
 

5173
01:51:46,079 --> 01:51:49,350
interesting if it's able to accomplish
like being truly original and novel to

5174
01:51:49,350 --> 01:51:49,360
like being truly original and novel to
 

5175
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:51,669
like being truly original and novel to
you know lot large language models being

5176
01:51:51,669 --> 01:51:51,679
you know lot large language models being
 

5177
01:51:51,679 --> 01:51:54,790
you know lot large language models being
able to come up with some truly new

5178
01:51:54,790 --> 01:51:54,800
able to come up with some truly new
 

5179
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:58,229
able to come up with some truly new
ideas uh that's one and the other one is

5180
01:51:58,229 --> 01:51:58,239
ideas uh that's one and the other one is
 

5181
01:51:58,239 --> 01:51:58,990
ideas uh that's one and the other one is
uh

5182
01:51:58,990 --> 01:51:59,000
uh
 

5183
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,270
uh
truth it seems that large language

5184
01:52:01,270 --> 01:52:01,280
truth it seems that large language
 

5185
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:03,310
truth it seems that large language
models are very good at

5186
01:52:03,310 --> 01:52:03,320
models are very good at
 

5187
01:52:03,320 --> 01:52:05,910
models are very good at
sounding like they're saying a true

5188
01:52:05,910 --> 01:52:05,920
sounding like they're saying a true
 

5189
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:10,390
sounding like they're saying a true
thing but they don't uh require or often

5190
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:10,400
thing but they don't uh require or often
 

5191
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:12,229
thing but they don't uh require or often
have a grounding in sort of a

01:52:12,229 --> 01:52:12,239
have a grounding in sort of a
 

5193
01:52:12,239 --> 01:52:15,390
have a grounding in sort of a
mathematical truth it can just basically

5194
01:52:15,390 --> 01:52:15,400
mathematical truth it can just basically
 

5195
01:52:15,400 --> 01:52:18,229
mathematical truth it can just basically
is a very good bullshitter so if if

5196
01:52:18,229 --> 01:52:18,239
is a very good bullshitter so if if
 

5197
01:52:18,239 --> 01:52:20,069
is a very good bullshitter so if if
there's not enough dat if there's not

5198
01:52:20,069 --> 01:52:20,079
there's not enough dat if there's not
 

5199
01:52:20,079 --> 01:52:23,270
there's not enough dat if there's not
enough sort of data uh in the in the

5200
01:52:23,270 --> 01:52:23,280
enough sort of data uh in the in the
 

5201
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:25,390
enough sort of data uh in the in the
training data about a particular topic

5202
01:52:25,390 --> 01:52:25,400
training data about a particular topic
 

5203
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:26,709
training data about a particular topic
is just going to

5204
01:52:26,709 --> 01:52:26,719
is just going to
 

5205
01:52:26,719 --> 01:52:30,310
is just going to
concoct um accurate sounding narratives

5206
01:52:30,310 --> 01:52:30,320
concoct um accurate sounding narratives
 

5207
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:33,350
concoct um accurate sounding narratives
which is a very fascinating problem to

5208
01:52:33,350 --> 01:52:33,360
which is a very fascinating problem to
 

5209
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:36,830
which is a very fascinating problem to
try to solve how do you get uh language

5210
01:52:36,830 --> 01:52:36,840
try to solve how do you get uh language
 

5211
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:40,149
try to solve how do you get uh language
models to infer what is true and not to

5212
01:52:40,149 --> 01:52:40,159
models to infer what is true and not to
 

5213
01:52:40,159 --> 01:52:42,709
models to infer what is true and not to
sort of introspect yeah they need to be

5214
01:52:42,709 --> 01:52:42,719
sort of introspect yeah they need to be
 

5215
01:52:42,719 --> 01:52:45,790
sort of introspect yeah they need to be
taught to say I don't know more often

5216
01:52:45,790 --> 01:52:45,800
taught to say I don't know more often
 

5217
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:48,750
taught to say I don't know more often
yeah and uh I know several humans who

5218
01:52:48,750 --> 01:52:48,760
yeah and uh I know several humans who
 

5219
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:50,470
yeah and uh I know several humans who
could be taught that as well

5220
01:52:50,470 --> 01:52:50,480
could be taught that as well
 

5221
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:52,550
could be taught that as well
sure and then the other stuff because

5222
01:52:52,550 --> 01:52:52,560
sure and then the other stuff because
 

5223
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:54,310
sure and then the other stuff because
you're still a bit involved in the

5224
01:52:54,310 --> 01:52:54,320
you're still a bit involved in the
 

5225
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:57,069
you're still a bit involved in the
Amazon side with the AI things the other

5226
01:52:57,069 --> 01:52:57,079
Amazon side with the AI things the other
 

5227
01:52:57,079 --> 01:52:59,229
Amazon side with the AI things the other
open question is what kind of products

5228
01:52:59,229 --> 01:52:59,239
open question is what kind of products
 

5229
01:52:59,239 --> 01:53:02,950
open question is what kind of products
are created from this oh so many yeah I

5230
01:53:02,950 --> 01:53:02,960
are created from this oh so many yeah I
 

5231
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:06,030
are created from this oh so many yeah I
mean you know just to you know we have

5232
01:53:06,030 --> 01:53:06,040
mean you know just to you know we have
 

5233
01:53:06,040 --> 01:53:10,229
mean you know just to you know we have
um Alexa and Eko and Alexa has you know

5234
01:53:10,229 --> 01:53:10,239
um Alexa and Eko and Alexa has you know
 

5235
01:53:10,239 --> 01:53:13,470
um Alexa and Eko and Alexa has you know
hundreds of millions of installed base

5236
01:53:13,470 --> 01:53:13,480
hundreds of millions of installed base
 

5237
01:53:13,480 --> 01:53:15,870
hundreds of millions of installed base
you know inputs and so there's this

5238
01:53:15,870 --> 01:53:15,880
you know inputs and so there's this
 

5239
01:53:15,880 --> 01:53:17,310
you know inputs and so there's this
there's you know there's Alexa

5240
01:53:17,310 --> 01:53:17,320
there's you know there's Alexa
 

5241
01:53:17,320 --> 01:53:19,550
there's you know there's Alexa
everywhere and guess what Alexa is about

5242
01:53:19,550 --> 01:53:19,560
everywhere and guess what Alexa is about
 

5243
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:22,750
everywhere and guess what Alexa is about
to a lot smarter yeah and so that's

5244
01:53:22,750 --> 01:53:22,760
to a lot smarter yeah and so that's
 

5245
01:53:22,760 --> 01:53:24,990
to a lot smarter yeah and so that's
really you know from a product point of

with their own corporate data yes
without accidentally contributing their

5270
01:53:54,390 --> 01:53:54,400
without accidentally contributing their
 

5271
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:57,470
without accidentally contributing their
corporate data to that model yes and so

corporate data to that model yes and so
 

5273
01:53:57,480 --> 01:53:58,790
corporate data to that model yes and so
those are the tools we're building for

those are the tools we're building for
 

5275
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:01,430
those are the tools we're building for
them with bedrock so there's tremendous

5276
01:54:01,430 --> 01:54:01,440
them with bedrock so there's tremendous
 

5277
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:03,510
them with bedrock so there's tremendous
opportunity here yeah the security the

5278
01:54:03,510 --> 01:54:03,520
opportunity here yeah the security the
 

5279
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:05,550
opportunity here yeah the security the
Privacy all those things are fascinating

5280
01:54:05,550 --> 01:54:05,560
Privacy all those things are fascinating
 

5281
01:54:05,560 --> 01:54:07,629
Privacy all those things are fascinating
of how to cuz so much value can be

5282
01:54:07,629 --> 01:54:07,639
of how to cuz so much value can be
 

5283
01:54:07,639 --> 01:54:09,750
of how to cuz so much value can be
gained by training on private data but

5284
01:54:09,750 --> 01:54:09,760
gained by training on private data but
 

5285
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:11,750
gained by training on private data but
you want to keep this secure that's a

you want to keep this secure that's a
it's a fascinating technical problem

5288
01:54:13,550 --> 01:54:13,560
it's a fascinating technical problem
 

5289
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:15,390
it's a fascinating technical problem
this is a very challenging technical

5290
01:54:15,390 --> 01:54:15,400
this is a very challenging technical
 

5291
01:54:15,400 --> 01:54:17,229
this is a very challenging technical
problem and it's one that we're you know

5292
01:54:17,229 --> 01:54:17,239
problem and it's one that we're you know
 

5293
01:54:17,239 --> 01:54:18,910
problem and it's one that we're you know
making progress on and dedicated to

customers uh do you think there will be
 

5299
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:25,430
customers uh do you think there will be
a day when humans and robots maybe Alexa

5300
01:54:25,430 --> 01:54:25,440
a day when humans and robots maybe Alexa
 

5301
01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:28,270
a day when humans and robots maybe Alexa
have a romantic relationship like can be

her well I mean think if you look at
 

5305
01:54:31,159 --> 01:54:32,550
her well I mean think if you look at
brainstorming products here if you look

5306
01:54:32,550 --> 01:54:32,560
brainstorming products here if you look
 

5307
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:35,589
brainstorming products here if you look
at the Spectrum of human variety and

5308
01:54:35,589 --> 01:54:35,599
at the Spectrum of human variety and
 

5309
01:54:35,599 --> 01:54:38,350
at the Spectrum of human variety and
what people like you know sexual variety

01:55:50,199 --> 01:55:52,669
it's painful and I'm like why am I here
and I don't want to do why am I here at

5368
01:55:52,669 --> 01:55:52,679
and I don't want to do why am I here at
 

5369
01:55:52,679 --> 01:55:54,430
and I don't want to do why am I here at

the gym why am I here at the gym why
don't I do something else you know this

5372
01:55:57,830 --> 01:55:57,840
don't I do something else you know this
 

5373
01:55:57,840 --> 01:55:59,870
don't I do something else you know this
it's not always easy uh what's your

5374
01:55:59,870 --> 01:55:59,880
it's not always easy uh what's your
 

5375
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:02,470
it's not always easy uh what's your
source of motivation in those moments I

5376
01:56:02,470 --> 01:56:02,480
source of motivation in those moments I
 

5377
01:56:02,480 --> 01:56:05,390
source of motivation in those moments I
know that I'll feel better later if I do

5378
01:56:05,390 --> 01:56:05,400
know that I'll feel better later if I do
 

5379
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:08,189
know that I'll feel better later if I do
it and so like the the real source of

5380
01:56:08,189 --> 01:56:08,199
it and so like the the real source of
 

5381
01:56:08,199 --> 01:56:10,149
it and so like the the real source of
motivation I can tell the days when I

5382
01:56:10,149 --> 01:56:10,159
motivation I can tell the days when I
 

5383
01:56:10,159 --> 01:56:12,990
motivation I can tell the days when I
skip it I'm I'm not quite as alert I

5384
01:56:12,990 --> 01:56:13,000
skip it I'm I'm not quite as alert I
 

5385
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,750
skip it I'm I'm not quite as alert I
don't feel as good um and then there's

5386
01:56:15,750 --> 01:56:15,760
don't feel as good um and then there's
 

5387
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:18,189
don't feel as good um and then there's
harder motivations it's longer term you

5388
01:56:18,189 --> 01:56:18,199
harder motivations it's longer term you
 

5389
01:56:18,199 --> 01:56:20,189
harder motivations it's longer term you
want to be healthy as you age you know

5390
01:56:20,189 --> 01:56:20,199
want to be healthy as you age you know
 

5391
01:56:20,199 --> 01:56:23,229
want to be healthy as you age you know
you want Health span you want ideally

5392
01:56:23,229 --> 01:56:23,239
you want Health span you want ideally
 

5393
01:56:23,239 --> 01:56:24,669
you want Health span you want ideally
you know you want to be healthy and

5394
01:56:24,669 --> 01:56:24,679
you know you want to be healthy and
 

5395
01:56:24,679 --> 01:56:26,510
you know you want to be healthy and
moving around when you're 80 years old

5396
01:56:26,510 --> 01:56:26,520
moving around when you're 80 years old
 

5397
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:30,030
moving around when you're 80 years old
you know and so there's a lot of but

5398
01:56:30,030 --> 01:56:30,040
you know and so there's a lot of but
 

5399
01:56:30,040 --> 01:56:32,189
you know and so there's a lot of but
that kind of motivation is so far in the

5400
01:56:32,189 --> 01:56:32,199
that kind of motivation is so far in the
 

5401
01:56:32,199 --> 01:56:34,629
that kind of motivation is so far in the
future it can be very hard to work in

5402
01:56:34,629 --> 01:56:34,639
future it can be very hard to work in
 

5403
01:56:34,639 --> 01:56:36,990
future it can be very hard to work in
the second so thinking about the fact

5404
01:56:36,990 --> 01:56:37,000
the second so thinking about the fact
 

5405
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:38,990
the second so thinking about the fact
I'll feel better in about four hours if

02:06:11,270 --> 02:06:11,280
Hillis way back in the
 

5877
02:06:11,280 --> 02:06:15,109
Hillis way back in the
80s um the idea is to build a clock as a

5878
02:06:15,109 --> 02:06:15,119
80s um the idea is to build a clock as a
 

5879
02:06:15,119 --> 02:06:18,069
80s um the idea is to build a clock as a
symbol for long-term thinking and you

5880
02:06:18,069 --> 02:06:18,079
symbol for long-term thinking and you
 

5881
02:06:18,079 --> 02:06:20,350
symbol for long-term thinking and you
can kind of just very conceptually think

5882
02:06:20,350 --> 02:06:20,360
can kind of just very conceptually think
 

5883
02:06:20,360 --> 02:06:23,950
can kind of just very conceptually think
of the 10,000 year clock as it it it you

5884
02:06:23,950 --> 02:06:23,960
of the 10,000 year clock as it it it you
 

5885
02:06:23,960 --> 02:06:28,350
of the 10,000 year clock as it it it you
know it ticks once a year um it Chimes

5886
02:06:28,350 --> 02:06:28,360
know it ticks once a year um it Chimes
 

5887
02:06:28,360 --> 02:06:30,350
know it ticks once a year um it Chimes
once you know every hundred years and

5888
02:06:30,350 --> 02:06:30,360
once you know every hundred years and
 

5889
02:06:30,360 --> 02:06:32,790
once you know every hundred years and
the cuckoo comes out once every thousand

5890
02:06:32,790 --> 02:06:32,800
the cuckoo comes out once every thousand
 

5891
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:34,709
the cuckoo comes out once every thousand
years so it just sort of slows

5892
02:06:34,709 --> 02:06:34,719
years so it just sort of slows
 

5893
02:06:34,719 --> 02:06:38,589
years so it just sort of slows
everything down and um it's a completely

5894
02:06:38,589 --> 02:06:38,599
everything down and um it's a completely
 

5895
02:06:38,599 --> 02:06:42,350
everything down and um it's a completely
mechanical clock it is designed to last

5896
02:06:42,350 --> 02:06:42,360
mechanical clock it is designed to last
 

5897
02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:45,149
mechanical clock it is designed to last
10,000 years with no human intervention

5898
02:06:45,149 --> 02:06:45,159
10,000 years with no human intervention
 

5899
02:06:45,159 --> 02:06:47,470
10,000 years with no human intervention
so the material choices and everything

5900
02:06:47,470 --> 02:06:47,480
so the material choices and everything
 

5901
02:06:47,480 --> 02:06:50,549
so the material choices and everything
else um it's in a remote location both

5902
02:06:50,549 --> 02:06:50,559
else um it's in a remote location both
 

5903
02:06:50,559 --> 02:06:53,709
else um it's in a remote location both
to protect it but also so that visitors

5904
02:06:53,709 --> 02:06:53,719
to protect it but also so that visitors
 

5905
02:06:53,719 --> 02:06:56,109
to protect it but also so that visitors
have to kind of make a a

5906
02:06:56,109 --> 02:06:56,119
have to kind of make a a
 

5907
02:06:56,119 --> 02:07:00,350
have to kind of make a a
pilgrimage the idea is that over time

5908
02:07:00,350 --> 02:07:00,360
pilgrimage the idea is that over time
 

5909
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:02,830
pilgrimage the idea is that over time
this will take hundreds of years but

5910
02:07:02,830 --> 02:07:02,840
this will take hundreds of years but
 

5911
02:07:02,840 --> 02:07:05,549
this will take hundreds of years but
over time it will take on the patina of

5912
02:07:05,549 --> 02:07:05,559
over time it will take on the patina of
 

5913
02:07:05,559 --> 02:07:08,830
over time it will take on the patina of
age and then it will become a symbol for

5914
02:07:08,830 --> 02:07:08,840
age and then it will become a symbol for
 

5915
02:07:08,840 --> 02:07:12,030
age and then it will become a symbol for
long-term thinking that will actually

5916
02:07:12,030 --> 02:07:12,040
long-term thinking that will actually
 

5917
02:07:12,040 --> 02:07:16,549
long-term thinking that will actually
hopefully get humans to extend their uh

02:07:16,549 --> 02:07:16,559
hopefully get humans to extend their uh

hopefully get humans to extend their uh
thinking Horizons and

02:07:19,159 --> 02:07:22,350

my view that's really important as we

my view that's really important as we

we're really affecting the planet now

02:07:28,510 --> 02:07:28,520
we're really affecting the planet now

all kinds of things where we can really

all kinds of things where we can really

02:07:36,119 --> 02:07:38,629
all kinds of things where we can really
hurt ourselves and the problems we

hurt ourselves and the problems we
 

5937
02:07:38,639 --> 02:07:41,750
hurt ourselves and the problems we
create can be so large you know the the

02:07:41,750 --> 02:07:41,760
create can be so large you know the the
 

5939
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:44,310

Revolution got a lot of benefits from it
 

5951
02:07:52,079 --> 02:07:54,629
Revolution got a lot of benefits from it
but we've also got this side effect that

5952
02:07:54,629 --> 02:07:54,639
but we've also got this side effect that
 

5953
02:07:54,639 --> 02:07:57,990
but we've also got this side effect that
is very detrimental we need to be we

02:07:57,990 --> 02:07:58,000
is very detrimental we need to be we
 

5955
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:59,270

need to start training ourselves to

need to start training ourselves to

need to start training ourselves to
think longer term long-term thinking is

5958
02:08:01,030 --> 02:08:01,040
think longer term long-term thinking is
 

5959
02:08:01,040 --> 02:08:04,030
think longer term long-term thinking is
a giant lever you can literally solve

5960
02:08:04,030 --> 02:08:04,040
a giant lever you can literally solve
 

5961
02:08:04,040 --> 02:08:06,310
a giant lever you can literally solve
problems if you think longterm that are

problems if you think longterm that are
 

5963
02:08:06,320 --> 02:08:07,990
problems if you think longterm that are
impossible to solve if you think

5964
02:08:07,990 --> 02:08:08,000
impossible to solve if you think
 

5965
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,229
impossible to solve if you think
shortterm and we aren't really good at

5966
02:08:10,229 --> 02:08:10,239
shortterm and we aren't really good at
 

5967
02:08:10,239 --> 02:08:12,709
shortterm and we aren't really good at

5969
02:08:12,719 --> 02:08:15,950
thinking long term as you know it's not
really we're kind of you know five years

5970
02:08:15,950 --> 02:08:15,960
really we're kind of you know five years
 

5971
02:08:15,960 --> 02:08:19,149
really we're kind of you know five years
is a tough time frame for most

5972
02:08:19,149 --> 02:08:19,159
is a tough time frame for most
 

5973
02:08:19,159 --> 02:08:21,149
is a tough time frame for most
uh institutions to think

5974
02:08:21,149 --> 02:08:21,159
uh institutions to think
 

5975
02:08:21,159 --> 02:08:23,990
uh institutions to think
past um and we probably need to stretch

5976
02:08:23,990 --> 02:08:24,000
past um and we probably need to stretch
 

5977
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:25,990
past um and we probably need to stretch
that to 10 years and 15 years and 20

5978
02:08:25,990 --> 02:08:26,000
that to 10 years and 15 years and 20
 

5979
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,109
that to 10 years and 15 years and 20
years and 25 years and we'd do a better

5980
02:08:28,109 --> 02:08:28,119
years and 25 years and we'd do a better
 

5981
02:08:28,119 --> 02:08:29,910
years and 25 years and we'd do a better
job for our children or our

5982
02:08:29,910 --> 02:08:29,920
job for our children or our
 

5983
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:32,149

thinking Horizons and so the clock is in

5986
02:08:35,750 --> 02:08:35,760
thinking Horizons and so the clock is in
 

5987
02:08:35,760 --> 02:08:39,669
thinking Horizons and so the clock is in
a way it's an art project um it's a

5988
02:08:39,669 --> 02:08:39,679
a way it's an art project um it's a
 

5989
02:08:39,679 --> 02:08:43,109
a way it's an art project um it's a
symbol um and it if it ever has any

5990
02:08:43,109 --> 02:08:43,119
symbol um and it if it ever has any
 

5991
02:08:43,119 --> 02:08:45,270
symbol um and it if it ever has any
power to influence people to think

5992
02:08:45,270 --> 02:08:45,280
power to influence people to think
 

5993
02:08:45,280 --> 02:08:46,709

longer term that won't happen for

5994
02:08:46,709 --> 02:08:46,719
longer term that won't happen for
 

5995
02:08:46,719 --> 02:08:48,229
longer term that won't happen for
hundreds of years but we have to you

5996
02:08:48,229 --> 02:08:48,239
hundreds of years but we have to you
 

5997
02:08:48,239 --> 02:08:49,510
hundreds of years but we have to you
know we're going to build it now and let

5998
02:08:49,510 --> 02:08:49,520
know we're going to build it now and let
 

5999
02:08:49,520 --> 02:08:52,390
know we're going to build it now and let
it acre the patina of age do you think

6000
02:08:52,390 --> 02:08:52,400
it acre the patina of age do you think
 

6001
02:08:52,400 --> 02:08:54,109
it acre the patina of age do you think
humans will be here when the clock runs

6002
02:08:54,109 --> 02:08:54,119
humans will be here when the clock runs
 

6003
02:08:54,119 --> 02:08:58,350
humans will be here when the clock runs
out here on Earth I think

6004
02:08:58,350 --> 02:08:58,360
out here on Earth I think
 

6005
02:08:58,360 --> 02:09:00,990
out here on Earth I think
so but you know the United States won't

6006
02:09:00,990 --> 02:09:01,000
so but you know the United States won't
 

6007
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,709
so but you know the United States won't
exist like whole civilization rise and F

6008
02:09:03,709 --> 02:09:03,719
exist like whole civilization rise and F
 

6009
02:09:03,719 --> 02:09:05,669
exist like whole civilization rise and F
10,000 years is so

6010
02:09:05,669 --> 02:09:05,679
10,000 years is so
 

6011
02:09:05,679 --> 02:09:09,030
10,000 years is so
long like no nation state has ever

6012
02:09:09,030 --> 02:09:09,040
long like no nation state has ever
 

6013
02:09:09,040 --> 02:09:11,709
long like no nation state has ever
survived for anywhere close to 10,000

6014
02:09:11,709 --> 02:09:11,719
survived for anywhere close to 10,000
 

6015
02:09:11,719 --> 02:09:13,709
survived for anywhere close to 10,000
years and the increasing rate of

6016
02:09:13,709 --> 02:09:13,719
years and the increasing rate of
 

6017
02:09:13,719 --> 02:09:15,589
years and the increasing rate of
progress makes that even even less

6018
02:09:15,589 --> 02:09:15,599
progress makes that even even less
 

6019
02:09:15,599 --> 02:09:17,310
progress makes that even even less
likely so do I think humans will be here

6020
02:09:17,310 --> 02:09:17,320
likely so do I think humans will be here
 

6021
02:09:17,320 --> 02:09:19,270
likely so do I think humans will be here
yes what you know

6022
02:09:19,270 --> 02:09:19,280
yes what you know
 

6023
02:09:19,280 --> 02:09:20,830
yes what you know
how will we have changed ourselves and

6024
02:09:20,830 --> 02:09:20,840
how will we have changed ourselves and
 

6025
02:09:20,840 --> 02:09:23,430
how will we have changed ourselves and
what will we be and so on so on I I

6026
02:09:23,430 --> 02:09:23,440
what will we be and so on so on I I
 

6027
02:09:23,440 --> 02:09:25,709
what will we be and so on so on I I
don't know but I think we'll be here on

6028
02:09:25,709 --> 02:09:25,719
don't know but I think we'll be here on
 

6029
