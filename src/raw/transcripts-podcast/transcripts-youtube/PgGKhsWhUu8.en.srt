it so I think AI is really going to be a

618
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:34,480
it so I think AI is really going to be a
 

619
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,750
it so I think AI is really going to be a
tool to make artists better artists um

620

tool to make artists better artists um
and and uh you know the I think uh like

622
00:11:41,629 --> 00:11:41,639
and and uh you know the I think uh like
 

623
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:44,550
and and uh you know the I think uh like
a synthesizer right uh really created

624
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:44,560
a synthesizer right uh really created
 

625
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,069
a synthesizer right uh really created
the opportunity for you know one man to

626
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:46,079
the opportunity for you know one man to
 

627
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,470
the opportunity for you know one man to
have an orchestra um maybe a bit of a

628
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:49,480
have an orchestra um maybe a bit of a
 

629
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,550
have an orchestra um maybe a bit of a
threat to uh a

630
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:51,560
threat to uh a
 

631
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,829
threat to uh a
percussionist um but maybe not maybe it

632
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:53,839

00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,789
get a little more efficient in terms of
their operation so we P up low multiple

1564
00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:49,799
their operation so we P up low multiple
 

1565
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:52,310
their operation so we P up low multiple
for their the business um one way to

1566
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:52,320
for their the business um one way to
 

1567
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,430
for their the business um one way to
think about the value of the business is

1568
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:53,440
think about the value of the business is
 

1569
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,149
think about the value of the business is
the price you pay for the earnings or

1570
00:28:56,149 --> 00:28:56,159
the price you pay for the earnings or
 

1571
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,029
the price you pay for the earnings or
alternatively what's the yield if you

1572
00:28:58,029 --> 00:28:58,039
alternatively what's the yield if you
 

1573
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:00,070
alternatively what's the yield if you
flip over the price over the earnings it

1574
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:00,080
flip over the price over the earnings it
 

1575
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,630
flip over the price over the earnings it
gives you kind of the yield of the

1576
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:01,640
gives you kind of the yield of the
 

1577
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,789
gives you kind of the yield of the
business so a 15 multiple is about a

1578
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:04,799
business so a 15 multiple is about a
 

1579
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,110
business so a 15 multiple is about a
almost a 7 a half% yield and that

1580
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:07,120
almost a 7 a half% yield and that
 

1581
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,389
almost a 7 a half% yield and that
earnings yield is growing over time as

1582
00:29:09,389 --> 00:29:09,399
earnings yield is growing over time as
 

1583
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:11,070
earnings yield is growing over time as
the business grows that's a you know

1584
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:11,080
the business grows that's a you know
 

1585
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,430
the business grows that's a you know
compared to uh what you can earn lending

1586
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:14,440
compared to uh what you can earn lending
 

1587
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,269
compared to uh what you can earn lending
your money to the government you know 4%

1588
00:29:16,269 --> 00:29:16,279
your money to the government you know 4%
 

1589
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:17,909
your money to the government you know 4%
that's a very attractive going in yield

1590
00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:17,919
that's a very attractive going in yield
 

1591
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,990
that's a very attractive going in yield
and then there's all kinds of what we

1592
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,000
and then there's all kinds of what we
 

1593
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,909
and then there's all kinds of what we
call optionality in all the various

1594
00:29:21,909 --> 00:29:21,919
call optionality in all the various
 

1595
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,190
call optionality in all the various

put them in the handful versus the

2342
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:45,480
put them in the handful versus the
 

2343
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,190
put them in the handful versus the
thousands and if you're in you know the

2344
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:49,200
thousands and if you're in you know the
 

2345
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,309
thousands and if you're in you know the
thousands I I'd rather someone bought

2346
00:43:52,309 --> 00:43:52,319
thousands I I'd rather someone bought
 

2347
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,990
thousands I I'd rather someone bought
just an index fund basically yeah index

2348
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:55,000
just an index fund basically yeah index
 

2349
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,549
just an index fund basically yeah index
funds but what uh what would be the leap

2350
00:43:57,549 --> 00:43:57,559
funds but what uh what would be the leap
 

2351
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:00,430
funds but what uh what would be the leap
for an everyday investor to go to

2352
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:00,440
for an everyday investor to go to

2363
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,390
don't get that much more benefit of

donut chain and you could buy Wendy's
 

2613
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,710
donut chain and you could buy Wendy's
for basically $5

2614
00:48:57,710 --> 00:48:57,720
for basically $5
 

2615
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:00,109

billion and they owned 100% of Tim

2616
00:49:00,109 --> 00:49:00,119
billion and they owned 100% of Tim
 

2617
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:02,270
billion and they owned 100% of Tim
Horton's which itself was worth more

2618
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:02,280
Horton's which itself was worth more
 

2619
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,870
Horton's which itself was worth more
than 5 billion so you could literally

2620
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:03,880
than 5 billion so you could literally
 

2621
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,829
than 5 billion so you could literally
buy Wendy's separate Tim Hortons and get

2622
00:49:05,829 --> 00:49:05,839
buy Wendy's separate Tim Hortons and get

they couldn't repay and if you kind of
 

3197
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:38,309
they couldn't repay and if you kind of
examine the bankruptcy code um that it's

examine the bankruptcy code um that it's
precisely designed for a situation like

3200
00:59:40,270 --> 00:59:40,280

this where it's kind of this resting
 

3203
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:46,349
this where it's kind of this resting
place you can go uh to kind of re re uh

3204
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:46,359
place you can go uh to kind of re re uh

that had gone bankrupt the shareholders

3210
00:59:53,109 --> 00:59:53,119
that had gone bankrupt the shareholders
 

3211
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:55,029
that had gone bankrupt the shareholders
got wiped out and so so the market

3212
00:59:55,029 --> 00:59:55,039
got wiped out and so so the market
 

3213
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:56,910
got wiped out and so so the market
seeing every previous example the sholds

3214
00:59:56,910 --> 00:59:56,920
seeing every previous example the sholds
 

3215
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,069
seeing every previous example the sholds
get wiped out the assumption is the

3216
00:59:58,069 --> 00:59:58,079
get wiped out the assumption is the
 

3217
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,910
get wiped out the assumption is the
stock is going to go to zero that's not

3218
00:59:59,910 --> 00:59:59,920
stock is going to go to zero that's not

01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:01,480
what the bankruptcy code says what the
 

3221
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,390

01:00:06,789 --> 01:00:06,799
the value gets apportioned based on
 

3225
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:09,270
the value gets apportioned based on
value and if you could prove to a judge

3226
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:09,280
value and if you could prove to a judge
 

3227
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,910
value and if you could prove to a judge
that there was the assets worth more

3228
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:10,920
that there was the assets worth more
 

3229
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:12,510
that there was the assets worth more
than the liabilities then the

3230
01:00:12,510 --> 01:00:12,520
than the liabilities then the
 

3231
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,109
than the liabilities then the
shareholders actually get to keep their

3232
01:00:14,109 --> 01:00:14,119
shareholders actually get to keep their
 

3233
01:00:14,119 --> 01:00:15,150
shareholders actually get to keep their
investment in the

3234
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:15,160
investment in the
 

3235
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,750
investment in the
company and that was the bet we made and

3236
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:17,760
company and that was the bet we made and
 

3237
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,230
company and that was the bet we made and
so we stepped into the market we bought

3238
01:00:19,230 --> 01:00:19,240
so we stepped into the market we bought
 

3239
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,789
so we stepped into the market we bought
25% of the company in the open market

3240
01:00:21,789 --> 01:00:21,799
25% of the company in the open market
 

3241
01:00:21,799 --> 01:00:25,190
25% of the company in the open market
for we had to pay up it started at at 34

3242
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:25,200
for we had to pay up it started at at 34
 

3243
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:28,309
for we had to pay up it started at at 34
I think there were 300 million shares so

3244
01:00:28,309 --> 01:00:28,319
I think there were 300 million shares so
 

3245
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:30,109
I think there were 300 million shares so
it was at a $100 million value by the

3246
01:00:30,109 --> 01:00:30,119
it was at a $100 million value by the
 

3247
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:32,309
it was at a $100 million value by the
time we were done we paid an average of

3248
01:00:32,309 --> 01:00:32,319
time we were done we paid an average of
 

3249
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:34,230
time we were done we paid an average of
we paid 60 million for 25% of the

3250
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:34,240
we paid 60 million for 25% of the
 

3251
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,069
we paid 60 million for 25% of the
business so about $240 million for the

3252
01:00:37,069 --> 01:00:37,079
business so about $240 million for the
 

3253
01:00:37,079 --> 01:00:39,069
business so about $240 million for the
equity of the company and then we had to

3254
01:00:39,069 --> 01:00:39,079
equity of the company and then we had to
 

3255
01:00:39,079 --> 01:00:40,309
equity of the company and then we had to
get on the board to convince the

3256
01:00:40,309 --> 01:00:40,319
get on the board to convince the
 

3257

3259
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,789
director is the right thing to do and
the board was in complete Panic didn't

goodness in the world and the problem

4390
01:21:04,830 --> 01:21:04,840
goodness in the world and the problem
 

4391
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:06,229
goodness in the world and the problem
was he couldn't hire the talent he

4392
01:21:06,229 --> 01:21:06,239
was he couldn't hire the talent he
 

4393
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:07,550
was he couldn't hire the talent he
wanted because he couldn't Grant stock

4394
01:21:07,550 --> 01:21:07,560
wanted because he couldn't Grant stock
 

4395
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:09,669
wanted because he couldn't Grant stock
options he couldn't pay Market salaries

4396
01:21:09,669 --> 01:21:09,679
options he couldn't pay Market salaries
 

4397
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:11,430
options he couldn't pay Market salaries
um and ultimately we ended up he ended

4398
01:21:11,430 --> 01:21:11,440
um and ultimately we ended up he ended
 

4399
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:13,790
um and ultimately we ended up he ended
up selling the business to a for-profit

4400
01:21:13,790 --> 01:21:13,800
up selling the business to a for-profit
 

4401
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:15,910
up selling the business to a for-profit
so it taught me for-profit solutions to

4402
01:21:15,910 --> 01:21:15,920
so it taught me for-profit solutions to
 

4403
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:17,590
so it taught me for-profit solutions to
problems are much better than nonprofits

4404
01:21:17,590 --> 01:21:17,600
problems are much better than nonprofits
 

4405
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:19,189
problems are much better than nonprofits
and here you had kind of a blend right

4406
01:21:19,189 --> 01:21:19,199
and here you had kind of a blend right
 

4407
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:21,550
and here you had kind of a blend right
it was set up as a nonprofit but I think

4408
01:21:21,550 --> 01:21:21,560
it was set up as a nonprofit but I think
 

4409
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:23,030
it was set up as a nonprofit but I think
they found the same thing they couldn't

4410
01:21:23,030 --> 01:21:23,040
they found the same thing they couldn't
 

4411
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,189
they found the same thing they couldn't
hire the talent they wanted without

4412
01:21:24,189 --> 01:21:24,199
hire the talent they wanted without
 

4413
01:21:24,199 --> 01:21:26,790
hire the talent they wanted without
having a for-profit subsidiary um but

4414
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:26,800
having a for-profit subsidiary um but
 

4415
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:31,310
having a for-profit subsidiary um but
the nonprofit entity as I understand it

4416
01:21:31,310 --> 01:21:31,320
the nonprofit entity as I understand it
 

4417
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:35,510
the nonprofit entity as I understand it
owns or a big chunk of open Ai and the

4418
01:21:35,510 --> 01:21:35,520
owns or a big chunk of open Ai and the
 

4419
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:37,709
owns or a big chunk of open Ai and the
investors own sort of a capped interest

4420
01:21:37,709 --> 01:21:37,719
investors own sort of a capped interest
 

4421
01:21:37,719 --> 01:21:40,590
investors own sort of a capped interest
where their upside is capped uh and they

4422
01:21:40,590 --> 01:21:40,600
where their upside is capped uh and they
 

4423
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,350
where their upside is capped uh and they
don't have representation on the

4424
01:21:42,350 --> 01:21:42,360
don't have representation on the
 

4425
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:46,229
don't have representation on the
board and I think that's a you know was

4426
01:21:46,229 --> 01:21:46,239
board and I think that's a you know was
 

4427
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:48,470
board and I think that's a you know was
a setup for a problem and that's clearly

4428
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:48,480
a setup for a problem and that's clearly
 

4429
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:50,990
a setup for a problem and that's clearly
what happened here and there's I guess

4430
01:21:50,990 --> 01:21:51,000
what happened here and there's I guess
 

4431
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,790
what happened here and there's I guess
some kind of complexity in the governor

4432
01:21:53,790 --> 01:21:53,800
some kind of complexity in the governor
 

4433
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:57,070
some kind of complexity in the governor
I mean because of this nonprofit and cap

4434
01:21:57,070 --> 01:21:57,080
I mean because of this nonprofit and cap
 

4435
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:58,790
I mean because of this nonprofit and cap
profit thing it seems like there's a

4436
01:21:58,790 --> 01:21:58,800
profit thing it seems like there's a
 

4437
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:03,030
profit thing it seems like there's a
bunch of complexity and um non-standard

4438
01:22:03,030 --> 01:22:03,040
bunch of complexity and um non-standard
 

4439
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:05,070
bunch of complexity and um non-standard
aspects to it

4440
01:22:05,070 --> 01:22:05,080
aspects to it
 

4441
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:07,750
aspects to it
that perhaps also contributed to the

4442
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:07,760
that perhaps also contributed to the
 

4443
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:11,110
that perhaps also contributed to the
problem yeah uh governance really

01:51:32,719 --> 01:51:34,950
of the Securities so that there's a

01:51:34,950 --> 01:51:34,960
scarcity and then you encourage people
 

6013
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:36,589
scarcity and then you encourage people
to buy the stock and you drive the stock

6024
01:51:48,030 --> 01:51:48,040
don't short stocks that's why I didn't
 

6025
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:50,950
don't short stocks that's why I didn't
short stocks before this but uh this was

02:23:24,960 --> 02:23:26,429
way to look at the world and so I think
there a lot of issues with it but it

02:23:26,429 --> 02:23:26,439
there a lot of issues with it but it
 

7647
02:23:26,439 --> 02:23:28,030
there a lot of issues with it but it
unfortunately it's advancing like

7648
02:23:28,030 --> 02:23:28,040
unfortunately it's advancing like
 

7649
02:23:28,040 --> 02:23:29,110
unfortunately it's advancing like
ultimately

7650
02:23:29,110 --> 02:23:29,120
ultimately
 

7651
02:23:29,120 --> 02:23:33,429

concluded uh racism uh as opposed to
fighting it which is what I thought it

7654
02:23:35,550 --> 02:23:35,560
fighting it which is what I thought it
 

7655
02:23:35,560 --> 02:23:37,990
fighting it which is what I thought it
was ultimately about so maybe you can

7656
02:23:37,990 --> 02:23:38,000
was ultimately about so maybe you can
 

7657
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:39,710
was ultimately about so maybe you can
speak to that book a little bit so

7658
02:23:39,710 --> 02:23:39,720
speak to that book a little bit so
 

7659
02:23:39,720 --> 02:23:42,269
speak to that book a little bit so
there's a history that traces back

7660
02:23:42,269 --> 02:23:42,279
there's a history that traces back
 

7661
02:23:42,279 --> 02:23:44,150
there's a history that traces back
across

7662
02:23:44,150 --> 02:23:44,160
across
 

7663
02:23:44,160 --> 02:23:46,349
across
decades and then that infiltrated

7664
02:23:46,349 --> 02:23:46,359
decades and then that infiltrated
 

7665
02:23:46,359 --> 02:23:47,670

college campuses

7666

02:23:57,510 --> 02:23:57,520
movement and many of the protagonists
 

7675
02:23:57,520 --> 02:24:00,950
movement and many of the protagonists
ended up in jail and uh out of that

7676
02:24:00,950 --> 02:24:00,960
ended up in jail and uh out of that
 

7677
02:24:00,960 --> 02:24:04,670
ended up in jail and uh out of that
movement a number of uh kind of thought

7678
02:24:04,670 --> 02:24:04,680
movement a number of uh kind of thought
 

7679
02:24:04,680 --> 02:24:08,110
movement a number of uh kind of thought
leaders this guy named maruse uh and

7680
02:24:08,110 --> 02:24:08,120
leaders this guy named maruse uh and
 

7681
02:24:08,120 --> 02:24:11,469
leaders this guy named maruse uh and
others built this framework kind of an

7682
02:24:11,469 --> 02:24:11,479
others built this framework kind of an
 

7683
02:24:11,479 --> 02:24:13,070
others built this framework kind of an
approach said look if we're going to be

7684
02:24:13,070 --> 02:24:13,080
approach said look if we're going to be
 

7685

7693
02:24:23,200 --> 02:24:26,550
to uh become part of the faculty and we
need to teach the students and then once

7694
02:24:26,550 --> 02:24:26,560
need to teach the students and then once
 

7695
02:24:26,560 --> 02:24:29,429
need to teach the students and then once
we take over the universities with this

7696
02:24:29,429 --> 02:24:29,439
we take over the universities with this
 

7697
02:24:29,439 --> 02:24:32,349
we take over the universities with this
ideology then we can go into government

7698
02:24:32,349 --> 02:24:32,359
ideology then we can go into government
 

7699

and then we can go into corporations and
 

7701
02:24:34,200 --> 02:24:36,309
and then we can go into corporations and
we can change the world so I thought

7702
02:24:36,309 --> 02:24:36,319
we can change the world so I thought
 

7703
02:24:36,319 --> 02:24:39,510
we can change the world so I thought

7965
02:29:54,160 --> 02:29:56,750
leadership wasn't
even part of the problem as much as they

7966
02:29:56,750 --> 02:29:56,760
even part of the problem as much as they
 

7967
02:29:56,760 --> 02:30:00,790
even part of the problem as much as they
were almost out of touch like

7968
02:30:00,790 --> 02:30:00,800
were almost out of touch like
 

7969
02:30:00,800 --> 02:30:04,309
were almost out of touch like
unaware that this is an important moment

7970
02:30:04,309 --> 02:30:04,319
unaware that this is an important moment
 

7971
02:30:04,319 --> 02:30:06,030
unaware that this is an important moment
it's an important crisis it's an

7972
02:30:06,030 --> 02:30:06,040
it's an important crisis it's an
 

7973
02:30:06,040 --> 02:30:08,750
it's an important crisis it's an
important opportunity to step up as a

7974
02:30:08,750 --> 02:30:08,760
important opportunity to step up as a
 

7975
02:30:08,760 --> 02:30:10,190
important opportunity to step up as a
leader and Define the future of an

7976

institution so I don't even know where

7978
02:30:12,469 --> 02:30:12,479
institution so I don't even know where
 

7979
02:30:12,479 --> 02:30:14,429
institution so I don't even know where
the source of the problem is it could be

7980
02:30:14,429 --> 02:30:14,439
the source of the problem is it could be
 

7981
02:30:14,439 --> 02:30:17,510
the source of the problem is it could be
literally government struct

7982
02:30:17,510 --> 02:30:17,520
literally government struct
 

7983
02:30:17,520 --> 02:30:19,110
literally government struct
as we've been two things I think it's

7984
02:30:19,110 --> 02:30:19,120
as we've been two things I think it's
 

7985
02:30:19,120 --> 02:30:20,870
as we've been two things I think it's
governance structure I also think

7986
02:30:20,870 --> 02:30:20,880
governance structure I also think
 

7987
02:30:20,880 --> 02:30:23,550
governance structure I also think
universities are selecting they're not

7988
02:30:23,550 --> 02:30:23,560
universities are selecting they're not
 

7989
02:30:23,560 --> 02:30:27,190
universities are selecting they're not
selecting leaders yeah U you know it's

7990
02:30:27,190 --> 02:30:27,200
selecting leaders yeah U you know it's
 

7991
02:30:27,200 --> 02:30:30,150
selecting leaders yeah U you know it's
not clear to me that

7992
02:30:30,150 --> 02:30:30,160
not clear to me that
 

7993
02:30:30,160 --> 02:30:33,590
not clear to me that
uh University should necessarily be run

7994
02:30:33,590 --> 02:30:33,600
uh University should necessarily be run
 

7995
02:30:33,600 --> 02:30:36,710
uh University should necessarily be run
by academics right you know the the the

7996
02:30:36,710 --> 02:30:36,720
by academics right you know the the the
 

7997
02:30:36,720 --> 02:30:38,670
by academics right you know the the the
dean of a

7998
02:30:38,670 --> 02:30:38,680
dean of a
 

7999
02:30:38,680 --> 02:30:41,750
dean of a
university uh you know the person who

8000
02:30:41,750 --> 02:30:41,760
university uh you know the person who
 

8001
02:30:41,760 --> 02:30:43,349
university uh you know the person who
helps

8002
02:30:43,349 --> 02:30:43,359
helps
 

8003
02:30:43,359 --> 02:30:45,429
helps
um sort of the business of the

8004
02:30:45,429 --> 02:30:45,439
um sort of the business of the
 

8005
02:30:45,439 --> 02:30:48,070
um sort of the business of the
University right and then there's the

8006
02:30:48,070 --> 02:30:48,080
University right and then there's the
 

8007
02:30:48,080 --> 02:30:50,950
University right and then there's the
academics of the university and having a

8008
02:30:50,950 --> 02:30:50,960
academics of the university and having a
 

8009
02:30:50,960 --> 02:30:53,110

I would argue having a business leader

8010
02:30:53,110 --> 02:30:53,120
I would argue having a business leader
 

8011
02:30:53,120 --> 02:30:54,429
I would argue having a business leader
run these

8012
02:30:54,429 --> 02:30:54,439
run these
 

8013
02:30:54,439 --> 02:30:57,030
run these
institutions uh and then having a board

8014
02:30:57,030 --> 02:30:57,040
institutions uh and then having a board
 

8015
02:30:57,040 --> 02:30:59,469
institutions uh and then having a board
that's invol a board that has itself

8016
02:30:59,469 --> 02:30:59,479
that's invol a board that has itself
 

8017
02:30:59,479 --> 02:31:01,630
that's invol a board that has itself
diverse viewpoints and by the way

8018
02:31:01,630 --> 02:31:01,640
diverse viewpoints and by the way
 

8019
02:31:01,640 --> 02:31:04,389
diverse viewpoints and by the way
permanently structured to have diverse

8020
02:31:04,389 --> 02:31:04,399
permanently structured to have diverse
 

8021
02:31:04,399 --> 02:31:06,710
permanently structured to have diverse
viewpoints uh is a much better way to

8022
02:31:06,710 --> 02:31:06,720
viewpoints uh is a much better way to
 

8023
02:31:06,720 --> 02:31:08,110
viewpoints uh is a much better way to
run a university than picking an

8024
02:31:08,110 --> 02:31:08,120
run a university than picking an
 

8025
02:31:08,120 --> 02:31:10,510
run a university than picking an
academic that the faculty supports

because you know one of the things I

8028
02:31:11,870 --> 02:31:11,880
because you know one of the things I
 

8029
02:31:11,880 --> 02:31:13,429
because you know one of the things I
learned about how faculty get hired at

8030
02:31:13,429 --> 02:31:13,439
learned about how faculty get hired at
 

8031
02:31:13,439 --> 02:31:15,790
learned about how faculty get hired at
universities ultimately it's signed off

8032
02:31:15,790 --> 02:31:15,800
universities ultimately it's signed off
 

8033
02:31:15,800 --> 02:31:17,710
universities ultimately it's signed off
by the board

8034
02:31:17,710 --> 02:31:17,720
by the board
 

8035
02:31:17,720 --> 02:31:20,309
by the board
but you know the new faculty are chosen

8036
02:31:20,309 --> 02:31:20,319
but you know the new faculty are chosen
 

8037
02:31:20,319 --> 02:31:22,349
but you know the new faculty are chosen
by each of the various departments and

8038
02:31:22,349 --> 02:31:22,359
by each of the various departments and
 

8039
02:31:22,359 --> 02:31:25,469
by each of the various departments and
once the Departments tip uh there's sort

8040
02:31:25,469 --> 02:31:25,479
once the Departments tip uh there's sort
 

8041
02:31:25,479 --> 02:31:27,550
once the Departments tip uh there's sort
of a Tipping Point politically where if

8042
02:31:27,550 --> 02:31:27,560
of a Tipping Point politically where if
 

8043
02:31:27,560 --> 02:31:30,070
of a Tipping Point politically where if
once they tip in One Direction The

8044
02:31:30,070 --> 02:31:30,080
once they tip in One Direction The
 

8045
02:31:30,080 --> 02:31:32,349
once they tip in One Direction The
Faculty uh recruit more people like

8046
02:31:32,349 --> 02:31:32,359
Faculty uh recruit more people like
 

8047
02:31:32,359 --> 02:31:34,230
Faculty uh recruit more people like
themselves and so the Departments come

8048
02:31:34,230 --> 02:31:34,240
themselves and so the Departments come
 

8049
02:31:34,240 --> 02:31:37,030
themselves and so the Departments come
more and more Progressive if you will

8050
02:31:37,030 --> 02:31:37,040
more and more Progressive if you will
 

8051
02:31:37,040 --> 02:31:38,510
more and more Progressive if you will
with the passage of time and they only

8052
02:31:38,510 --> 02:31:38,520
with the passage of time and they only
 

8053
02:31:38,520 --> 02:31:41,510
with the passage of time and they only
Advance candidates that that match their

Advance candidates that that match their
U they meet their political objectives

8056
02:31:42,990 --> 02:31:43,000
U they meet their political objectives
 

8057
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:46,030
U they meet their political objectives
it's it's not a great way to to build an

02:33:36,469 --> 02:33:36,479
issues that I would say the initial
 

8151
02:33:36,479 --> 02:33:40,590

footnotes and then over
 

8159
02:33:46,800 --> 02:33:50,110

plagiarism in I think eight of 11 of her

8166
02:34:00,630 --> 02:34:00,640
plagiarism in I think eight of 11 of her
 

8167
02:34:00,640 --> 02:34:02,150
plagiarism in I think eight of 11 of her
articles and one of the other things

8168
02:34:02,150 --> 02:34:02,160
articles and one of the other things
 

8169
02:34:02,160 --> 02:34:05,590

that came forth here is as president of

02:34:05,590 --> 02:34:05,600
that came forth here is as president of
 

8171
02:34:05,600 --> 02:34:06,790
that came forth here is as president of
the University she had sort of the

8172
02:34:06,790 --> 02:34:06,800
the University she had sort of the
 

8173
02:34:06,800 --> 02:34:09,429
the University she had sort of the
thinnest transcript academically of any

8174
02:34:09,429 --> 02:34:09,439
thinnest transcript academically of any
 

8175
02:34:09,439 --> 02:34:11,309
thinnest transcript academically of any
previous president you know very small

8176
02:34:11,309 --> 02:34:11,319
previous president you know very small
 

8177
02:34:11,319 --> 02:34:13,309
previous president you know very small
relatively small body of work and then

8178
02:34:13,309 --> 02:34:13,319
relatively small body of work and then
 

8179
02:34:13,319 --> 02:34:14,710
relatively small body of work and then
when you couple that with the amount of

8180
02:34:14,710 --> 02:34:14,720
when you couple that with the amount of
 

8181
02:34:14,720 --> 02:34:16,630
when you couple that with the amount of
plagiarism that was pervasive

8182
02:34:16,630 --> 02:34:16,640
plagiarism that was pervasive
 

8183
02:34:16,640 --> 02:34:18,550
plagiarism that was pervasive
and then I guess the some of the other

8184
02:34:18,550 --> 02:34:18,560
and then I guess the some of the other
 

8185
02:34:18,560 --> 02:34:19,910
and then I guess the some of the other
examples that surface were not missing

8186
02:34:19,910 --> 02:34:19,920
examples that surface were not missing
 

8187
02:34:19,920 --> 02:34:22,630
examples that surface were not missing
quotation marks where the authors of the

work felt that their ideas had been
 

8191
02:34:25,479 --> 02:34:28,269
work felt that their ideas had been
stolen and really plagiarism is academic

8192
02:34:28,269 --> 02:34:28,279

that many new members but the fact that

8512
02:40:55,429 --> 02:40:55,439
that many new members but the fact that
 

8513
02:40:55,439 --> 02:40:58,670
that many new members but the fact that
the population has grown of the country

8514
02:40:58,670 --> 02:40:58,680
the population has grown of the country
 

8515

1984 uh and the fact that Harvard
 

8521
02:41:05,200 --> 02:41:07,349
1984 uh and the fact that Harvard
recruits people from all over the world

it's really serving a smaller and
 

8525
02:41:09,040 --> 02:41:10,469
it's really serving a smaller and
smaller percentage of the population

8526

by virtue of the products existence the

11006
03:30:03,950 --> 03:30:03,960
by virtue of the products existence the
 

11007
03:30:03,960 --> 03:30:06,670
by virtue of the products existence the
world is a better place you know today

world is a better place you know today
uh you make you know her her world is a

11010
03:30:08,990 --> 03:30:09,000
uh you make you know her her world is a
 

11011
03:30:09,000 --> 03:30:12,389
uh you make you know her her world is a
world where the existence of the new car

11012
03:30:12,389 --> 03:30:12,399
world where the existence of the new car
 

11013
03:30:12,399 --> 03:30:13,830
world where the existence of the new car
actually is better for the environment

actually is better for the environment
 

11015

than if the new car hadn't existed and
 

11017
03:30:15,600 --> 03:30:17,830
than if the new car hadn't existed and
think about that in every product scale

11018
03:30:17,830 --> 03:30:17,840
think about that in every product scale
 

11019
03:30:17,840 --> 03:30:18,870
