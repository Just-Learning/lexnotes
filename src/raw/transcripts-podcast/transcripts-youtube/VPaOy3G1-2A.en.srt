00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,310
randelle one of the things you work on
and right about is dark matter we can't

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:29,320
and right about is dark matter we can't
 

25
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,589
and right about is dark matter we can't
see it but there there's a lot of it in

26
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:30,599
see it but there there's a lot of it in

see what is dark matter how should we

36
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:43,160
see what is dark matter how should we
 

37
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,950
see what is dark matter how should we
think about it given that we can't see

38
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:44,960
think about it given that we can't see
 

39
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,510
think about it given that we can't see
it how should we visualize it in our

40
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:46,520
it how should we visualize it in our
 

41
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,750
it how should we visualize it in our
Mind's Eye I think one of the really

important things that physics teaches

00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,430
important things that physics teaches
you is just our limitations but also our

46
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:53,440
you is just our limitations but also our
 

47
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,630
you is just our limitations but also our
abilities so the fact that we can deduce

48
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:56,640
abilities so the fact that we can deduce
 

49
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,349
abilities so the fact that we can deduce
the existence of something that we don't

50
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:58,359
the existence of something that we don't
 

51
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:01,430
the existence of something that we don't
directly see is really attribute to

52
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,440
directly see is really attribute to
 

53
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,429
directly see is really attribute to
people that we can do that but it's also

54
00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:04,439
people that we can do that but it's also
 

55
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,710
people that we can do that but it's also
something that tells you you can't

56
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:06,720
something that tells you you can't
 

57
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,469
something that tells you you can't
overly rely on your direct senses if you

58
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:10,479
overly rely on your direct senses if you
 

59
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,109
overly rely on your direct senses if you
just relied on just what you see

60
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:12,119
just relied on just what you see
 

61
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:13,910
just relied on just what you see
directly you would miss so much of

62
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:13,920
directly you would miss so much of
 

63
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,190
directly you would miss so much of
what's happening in the world and we can

64
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:16,200
what's happening in the world and we can
 

65
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,990
what's happening in the world and we can
generalize this but we're just for now

66
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,000
generalize this but we're just for now
 

67
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,469
generalize this but we're just for now
to focus on dark matter it's something

68
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:20,479
to focus on dark matter it's something
 

69
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,550
to focus on dark matter it's something
we know is there and it's not just one

70
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,560
we know is there and it's not just one
 

71
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,550
we know is there and it's not just one
way we know it's there in my book dark

72
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:24,560
way we know it's there in my book dark
 

73
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,510
way we know it's there in my book dark
matter and the dinosaurs I talk about

74
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:26,520
matter and the dinosaurs I talk about
 

75
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,510
matter and the dinosaurs I talk about
the many different ways you know this

76
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:28,520
the many different ways you know this
 

77
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,390
the many different ways you know this
eight or nine that we we deduce not just

78
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:31,400
eight or nine that we we deduce not just
 

79
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,190
eight or nine that we we deduce not just
the existence of dark matter but how

80
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,200
the existence of dark matter but how
 

81
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,389
the existence of dark matter but how
much how much is there and they all

82
00:01:35,389 --> 00:01:35,399
much how much is there and they all
 

83
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:37,910
much how much is there and they all
agree now how do we know it's there

84
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:37,920
agree now how do we know it's there
 

85
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,389
agree now how do we know it's there
because of its

86
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:39,399
because of its
 

87
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:43,310
because of its
gravitational force and individually a

88
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:43,320
gravitational force and individually a
 

89
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,709
gravitational force and individually a
particle doesn't have such a big

90
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:44,719
particle doesn't have such a big
 

91
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:46,830
particle doesn't have such a big
gravitational force in fact gravity is

92
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:46,840
gravitational force in fact gravity is
 

93
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,270
gravitational force in fact gravity is
an extremely weak force compared to

94
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,280
an extremely weak force compared to
 

95
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,950
an extremely weak force compared to
other forces we know about in nature but

96
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:51,960
other forces we know about in nature but
 

97
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,550
other forces we know about in nature but
there's a lot of Dark Matter out there

98
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:53,560
there's a lot of Dark Matter out there
 

99
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,149
there's a lot of Dark Matter out there
it carries a lot of energy five times

100
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:55,159
it carries a lot of energy five times
 

101
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:57,069
it carries a lot of energy five times
the amount of energy as the matter we

102
00:01:57,069 --> 00:01:57,079
the amount of energy as the matter we
 

103
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:00,830
the amount of energy as the matter we
know that's in atoms Etc so

104
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:00,840
know that's in atoms Etc so
 

105
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,590
know that's in atoms Etc so
you can ask how should we think about it

106
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:02,600
you can ask how should we think about it
 

107
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,830
you can ask how should we think about it
well it's just another form of matter

108
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:04,840
well it's just another form of matter
 

109
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,830
well it's just another form of matter
that doesn't interact with light or at

110
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:06,840
that doesn't interact with light or at
 

111
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,270
that doesn't interact with light or at
least as far as we know so it interacts

112
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,280
least as far as we know so it interacts
 

113
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,229
least as far as we know so it interacts
gravitationally it clumps it forms

114
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:12,239
gravitationally it clumps it forms
 

115
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,309
gravitationally it clumps it forms
galaxies but it doesn't interact with

116
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:15,319
galaxies but it doesn't interact with
 

117
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,750
galaxies but it doesn't interact with
light which means we just don't see it

118
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:16,760
light which means we just don't see it
 

119
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,790
light which means we just don't see it
and most of our detection before

120
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:18,800
and most of our detection before
 

121
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,509
and most of our detection before
gravitational wave detectors we only saw

122
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:21,519
gravitational wave detectors we only saw
 

123
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:24,110
gravitational wave detectors we only saw
things because of their interactions

124
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:24,120
things because of their interactions
 

125
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,550
things because of their interactions
with light in some sense so in theory it

126
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:26,560
with light in some sense so in theory it
 

127
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,270
with light in some sense so in theory it
it behaves just like any other matter

128
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:28,280
it behaves just like any other matter
 

129
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,430
it behaves just like any other matter
just it just doesn't interact with light

130
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:30,440
just it just doesn't interact with light
 

131
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,589
just it just doesn't interact with light
so when we say it interacts just like

132
00:02:32,589 --> 00:02:32,599
so when we say it interacts just like
 

133
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,830
so when we say it interacts just like
any other form of matter we have to be

134
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:33,840
any other form of matter we have to be
 

135
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,390
any other form of matter we have to be
careful um because gravitationally it

136
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,400
careful um because gravitationally it
 

137
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,190
careful um because gravitationally it
interacts like other forms of matter but

138
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,200
interacts like other forms of matter but
 

139
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,470
interacts like other forms of matter but
it doesn't experience electromagnetism

140
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:41,480
it doesn't experience electromagnetism
 

141
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,350
it doesn't experience electromagnetism
which is why it has a different

142
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:43,360
which is why it has a different
 

143
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,869
which is why it has a different
distribution so in our galaxy it's

144
00:02:45,869 --> 00:02:45,879
distribution so in our galaxy it's
 

145
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:47,110
distribution so in our galaxy it's
roughly

146
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,120
roughly
 

147
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,910
roughly
spherical unless it has its own

148
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:48,920
spherical unless it has its own
 

149
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,270
spherical unless it has its own
interactions that's another story but we

150
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,280
interactions that's another story but we
 

151
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,910
interactions that's another story but we
we know that it's roughly spherical um

152
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:53,920
we know that it's roughly spherical um
 

153
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,350
we know that it's roughly spherical um
whereas ordinary matter can radiate and

154
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:57,360
whereas ordinary matter can radiate and
 

155
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,949
whereas ordinary matter can radiate and
clumps into a dis and that's why we see

156
00:02:59,949 --> 00:02:59,959
clumps into a dis and that's why we see
 

157
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:03,589
clumps into a dis and that's why we see
the Milky Way desk so on large scales in

158
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:03,599
the Milky Way desk so on large scales in
 

159
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,910
the Milky Way desk so on large scales in
some sense yes all the matter is similar

160
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:05,920
some sense yes all the matter is similar
 

161
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,670
some sense yes all the matter is similar
in some sense in fact dark matter is in

162
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:08,680
in some sense in fact dark matter is in
 

163
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,350
in some sense in fact dark matter is in
some sense more important because it can

164
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,360
some sense more important because it can
 

165
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,430
some sense more important because it can
collapse more readily than ordinary

166
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:14,440
collapse more readily than ordinary
 

167
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,630
collapse more readily than ordinary
matter because ordinary

168
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:16,640
matter because ordinary
 

169
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,309
matter because ordinary
matter has has radiative forces which

170
00:03:19,309 --> 00:03:19,319
matter has has radiative forces which
 

171
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,750
matter has has radiative forces which
makes it hard to collapse on small

172
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:20,760
makes it hard to collapse on small
 

173
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,509
makes it hard to collapse on small
scales so actually it's dark matter that

174
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:23,519
scales so actually it's dark matter that
 

175
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,750
scales so actually it's dark matter that
sort of drives um Galaxy formation and

176
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:26,760
sort of drives um Galaxy formation and
 

177
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,670
sort of drives um Galaxy formation and
then ordinary matter kind of comes along

178
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:28,680
then ordinary matter kind of comes along
 

179
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,030
then ordinary matter kind of comes along
with it um and there's also just more of

180
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,040
with it um and there's also just more of
 

181
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,589
with it um and there's also just more of
it and because there's more of it it can

182
00:03:32,589 --> 00:03:32,599
it and because there's more of it it can
 

183
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,910
it and because there's more of it it can
start collapsing sooner that is to say

184
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:34,920
start collapsing sooner that is to say
 

185
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,830
start collapsing sooner that is to say
the energy density in Dark Matter

186
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:37,840
the energy density in Dark Matter
 

187
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,949
the energy density in Dark Matter
dominates over radiation earlier than

188
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:40,959
dominates over radiation earlier than
 

189
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,630
dominates over radiation earlier than
you would if you just had ordinary

190
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:42,640
you would if you just had ordinary
 

191
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,309
you would if you just had ordinary
matter so it's part of the story of the

192
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,319
matter so it's part of the story of the
 

193
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,110
matter so it's part of the story of the
origin of a Galaxy part of the story of

00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:46,120
origin of a Galaxy part of the story of
 

195
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,670
origin of a Galaxy part of the story of
the end of the Galaxy and part of the

196
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:47,680
the end of the Galaxy and part of the
 

197
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,869
the end of the Galaxy and part of the
story of all the various interactions

198
00:03:49,869 --> 00:03:49,879
story of all the various interactions

through exactly I mean in my book I make

200
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:51,920
through exactly I mean in my book I make
 

201
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,190
through exactly I mean in my book I make
kind of sort of jokes about you know

202
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:54,200
kind of sort of jokes about you know
 

203
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,030
kind of sort of jokes about you know
it's like when we think about a building

204
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:56,040
it's like when we think about a building
 

205
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,470
it's like when we think about a building
we think about the architect we think

206
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:57,480
we think about the architect we think
 

207
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,069
we think about the architect we think
about you know the high level but we

208
00:03:59,069 --> 00:03:59,079
about you know the high level but we
 

209
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,509
about you know the high level but we
forget about all the workers that did

210
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:00,519
forget about all the workers that did
 

211
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:02,630
forget about all the workers that did
all the grunt work and in fact Dark

212
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:02,640
all the grunt work and in fact Dark
 

213
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,069
all the grunt work and in fact Dark
Matter was really important in the

214
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:04,079
Matter was really important in the
 

215
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:06,789
Matter was really important in the
formation of our universe and we forget

216
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:06,799
formation of our universe and we forget
 

217
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,670
formation of our universe and we forget
that sometimes that's a a metaphor on

218
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,680
that sometimes that's a a metaphor on
 

219
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,710
that sometimes that's a a metaphor on
top of a metaphor

220
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:11,720
top of a metaphor
 

221
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,030
top of a metaphor
okay the the the unheard voices that do

222
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,040
okay the the the unheard voices that do
 

223
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,789
okay the the the unheard voices that do
the actual work okay exactly no but it

224
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:17,799
the actual work okay exactly no but it
 

225
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,550
the actual work okay exactly no but it
is a metaphor but it also captures

226
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:19,560
is a metaphor but it also captures
 

227
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,469
is a metaphor but it also captures
something because the fact is we don't

228
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:21,479
something because the fact is we don't
 

229
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:24,189
something because the fact is we don't
directly see it so we forget it it's

230
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:24,199
directly see it so we forget it it's
 

231
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,909
directly see it so we forget it it's
there or we don't understand it's there

232
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:25,919
there or we don't understand it's there
 

233
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,670
there or we don't understand it's there
or we think it's not the fact that we

234
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:27,680
or we think it's not the fact that we
 

235
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,270
or we think it's not the fact that we
don't see it makes it no less legitimate

236
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:30,280
don't see it makes it no less legitimate
 

237
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,749
don't see it makes it no less legitimate
it just means that we have challenges in

238
00:04:32,749 --> 00:04:32,759
it just means that we have challenges in
 

239
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,430
it just means that we have challenges in
order to find out exactly what it is

00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,440
order to find out exactly what it is
 

241
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,070
order to find out exactly what it is
yeah but the things we cannot see that

242
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,080
yeah but the things we cannot see that
 

243
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,790
yeah but the things we cannot see that
nevertheless have uh gravitational

00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,000
Layman level is just mind-blowing you
 

251
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,029
Layman level is just mind-blowing you
know it is and it isn't because I think

252
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:53,039
know it is and it isn't because I think
 

253
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:55,150
know it is and it isn't because I think
what it's teaching us is that we're

254
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:55,160
what it's teaching us is that we're
 

255
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,110
what it's teaching us is that we're
human the universe is what it is and

256
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:58,120
human the universe is what it is and
 

257
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,670
human the universe is what it is and
we're trying to interact with that

258
00:04:59,670 --> 00:04:59,680
we're trying to interact with that
 

259
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,909
we're trying to interact with that
universe and discover what it is we've

260
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:01,919
universe and discover what it is we've
 

261
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,510
universe and discover what it is we've
discovered amazing things in fact I

262
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:04,520
discovered amazing things in fact I
 

263
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,990
discovered amazing things in fact I
would say it's more surprising that the

264
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:07,000
would say it's more surprising that the
 

265
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,749
would say it's more surprising that the
mount the matter that we know about is

266
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:09,759
mount the matter that we know about is
 

267
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,469
mount the matter that we know about is
constitutes as big a fraction of the

268
00:05:11,469 --> 00:05:11,479
constitutes as big a fraction of the
 

269
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:13,629
constitutes as big a fraction of the
universe as it does I mean we're limited

270
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:13,639
universe as it does I mean we're limited
 

271
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:17,350
universe as it does I mean we're limited
we're human and the fact that we see 5%

272
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:17,360
we're human and the fact that we see 5%
 

273
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,749
we're human and the fact that we see 5%
of the energy density of the Universe um

274
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:19,759
of the energy density of the Universe um
 

275
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,230
of the energy density of the Universe um
you know about one six of the energy

276
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:21,240
you know about one six of the energy
 

277
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,110
you know about one six of the energy
density in matter that's kind of

278
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,120
density in matter that's kind of
 

279
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,990
density in matter that's kind of
remarkable I mean why should that be

280
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:25,000
remarkable I mean why should that be
 

281
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,510
remarkable I mean why should that be
there could be anything out anything

282

there could be anything out anything
 

283
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,510
there could be anything out anything
could be out there yet the universe that

00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:28,520
could be out there yet the universe that
 

285
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,150
could be out there yet the universe that
we see is the significant fraction yeah

286
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:31,160
we see is the significant fraction yeah
 

287
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,189
we see is the significant fraction yeah
but a lot of our intuition I think

288
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:33,199
but a lot of our intuition I think
 

289
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,830
but a lot of our intuition I think

00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:41,880
how many of our words are based on how
 

297
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,590
how many of our words are based on how
we see the world um and that's true and

00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:45,600
we see the world um and that's true and
 

299
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,550
we see the world um and that's true and
that's actually one of the Fantastic

00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:47,560
that's actually one of the Fantastic

00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,189
that's actually one of the Fantastic

313
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:02,710

00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:07,430
made it the grun work workers oh yeah
that's good yeah you did that's why he

that's good yeah you did that's why he
get paid the big bucks with a and write

320
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:09,599
get paid the big bucks with a and write
 

321
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:13,189
get paid the big bucks with a and write
the great books okay so um you also

322
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:13,199
the great books okay so um you also
 

323
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,950
the great books okay so um you also
write in that book

324
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:14,960
write in that book
 

325
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,830
write in that book
about uh dark matter matter having to do

326
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:17,840
about uh dark matter matter having to do
 

327
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,270
about uh dark matter matter having to do
something with the extinction events the

328
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:20,280
something with the extinction events the
 

329
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,629
something with the extinction events the
extinction of the

330
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:21,639
extinction of the
 

331
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:25,029
extinction of the
dinosaurs um which is kind of a

332
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:25,039
dinosaurs um which is kind of a
 

333
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,909
dinosaurs um which is kind of a
fascinating presentation of how

334
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:26,919
fascinating presentation of how
 

335
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:29,070
fascinating presentation of how
everything is connected so I guess the

336
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:29,080
everything is connected so I guess the
 

337
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,629
everything is connected so I guess the
dist disturbances

338
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:30,639
dist disturbances
 

339
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,870
dist disturbances
from the dark matter they create

340
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:33,880
from the dark matter they create
 

341
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,430
from the dark matter they create
gravitational disturbances in the OR

342
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:35,440
gravitational disturbances in the OR
 

343
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,830
gravitational disturbances in the OR
Cloud at the edge of our solar system

344
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:37,840
Cloud at the edge of our solar system
 

345
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,990
Cloud at the edge of our solar system
and then that increases the rate of

346
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,000
and then that increases the rate of
 

347
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,710
and then that increases the rate of
asteroids hitting Earth so I want to be

348
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:42,720
asteroids hitting Earth so I want to be
 

349
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,150
asteroids hitting Earth so I want to be
really clear this was a speculative

350
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:45,160
really clear this was a speculative
 

351
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,589
really clear this was a speculative
Theory I love it though I mean and I

352
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:48,599
Theory I love it though I mean and I
 

353
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:51,909
Theory I love it though I mean and I
liked it too and um and we still don't

354
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:51,919
liked it too and um and we still don't
 

355
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,309
liked it too and um and we still don't
know for sure but we can what we liked

356
00:06:55,309 --> 00:06:55,319
know for sure but we can what we liked
 

357
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,790
know for sure but we can what we liked
about it so let me take a step back so

358
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:57,800
about it so let me take a step back so
 

359
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,070
about it so let me take a step back so
we usually assume that dark matter is

360
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,080
we usually assume that dark matter is
 

361
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,070
we usually assume that dark matter is
what we being physicists that just one

362
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080
what we being physicists that just one
 

363
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,550
what we being physicists that just one
thing it's just basically non

364
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:04,560
thing it's just basically non
 

365
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,710
thing it's just basically non
interacting in on aside from gravity or

366
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:07,720
interacting in on aside from gravity or
 

367
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,029
interacting in on aside from gravity or
very weakly interacting matter um but

368
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039
very weakly interacting matter um but
 

369
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,950
very weakly interacting matter um but
again we have to get outside this

370
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:12,960
again we have to get outside this
 

371
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,390
again we have to get outside this
mindset of just humans and ask what else

372
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:15,400
mindset of just humans and ask what else
 

373
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,230
mindset of just humans and ask what else
could be there and so what we suggested

374
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,240
could be there and so what we suggested
 

375
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,150
could be there and so what we suggested
is that there's a fraction of dark

376
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,160
is that there's a fraction of dark
 

377
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,309
is that there's a fraction of dark
matter not all the dark matter but some

378
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319
matter not all the dark matter but some
 

379
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,589
matter not all the dark matter but some
of the Dark Matter maybe it has

380
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:23,599
of the Dark Matter maybe it has
 

381
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,070
of the Dark Matter maybe it has
interactions of its own just the same

382
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,080
interactions of its own just the same
 

383
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,430
interactions of its own just the same
way in in our universe we have lots of

384
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:28,440
way in in our universe we have lots of
 

385
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,629
way in in our universe we have lots of
different types of matter we have nuclei

386
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:30,639
different types of matter we have nuclei
 

387
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,150
different types of matter we have nuclei
we have electrons we have mu we have

388
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:33,160
we have electrons we have mu we have
 

389
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,070
we have electrons we have mu we have
forces um we have lots of it's it's not

390
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,080
forces um we have lots of it's it's not
 

391
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,510
forces um we have lots of it's it's not
a simple model the standard model but

392
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:38,520
a simple model the standard model but
 

393
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,350
a simple model the standard model but
but it does have some basic ingredients

394
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:40,360
but it does have some basic ingredients
 

395
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,589
but it does have some basic ingredients
so maybe Dark Matter also has some

396
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:42,599
so maybe Dark Matter also has some
 

397
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:44,990
so maybe Dark Matter also has some
interesting um structure to it so maybe

398
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:45,000
interesting um structure to it so maybe
 

399
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,070
interesting um structure to it so maybe
there's some small fraction and the

400
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:47,080
there's some small fraction and the
 

401
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,070
there's some small fraction and the
interesting thing is that if some of the

402
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,080
interesting thing is that if some of the
 

403
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,790
interesting thing is that if some of the
Dark Matter does radiate and you know I

404
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:52,800
Dark Matter does radiate and you know I
 

405
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,909
Dark Matter does radiate and you know I
like to call it dark light because it's

406
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:54,919
like to call it dark light because it's
 

407
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:56,749
like to call it dark light because it's
light that we don't see but Dark Matter

408
00:07:56,749 --> 00:07:56,759
light that we don't see but Dark Matter
 

409
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,909
light that we don't see but Dark Matter
would see it could radiate that and then

410
00:07:59,909 --> 00:07:59,919
would see it could radiate that and then
 

411
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,869
would see it could radiate that and then
it could perhaps collapse into a disc

412
00:08:01,869 --> 00:08:01,879
it could perhaps collapse into a disc
 

413
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:04,550
it could perhaps collapse into a disc
the same way ordinary matter collapsed

414
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:04,560
the same way ordinary matter collapsed
 

415
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,589
the same way ordinary matter collapsed
into the Milky Way disc so it's not all

416
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:06,599
into the Milky Way disc so it's not all
 

417
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:09,749
into the Milky Way disc so it's not all
the dark matter it's a fraction but it

418
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:09,759
the dark matter it's a fraction but it
 

419
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,790
the dark matter it's a fraction but it
could conceivably be a very thin disc of

420
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:11,800
could conceivably be a very thin disc of
 

421
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,950
could conceivably be a very thin disc of
Dark Matter thin dense disc of dark

422
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:13,960
Dark Matter thin dense disc of dark
 

423
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,070
Dark Matter thin dense disc of dark
matter and so then the question is do

424
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,080
matter and so then the question is do
 

425
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,790
matter and so then the question is do
these exist and people have done studies

426
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:18,800
these exist and people have done studies
 

427
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,950
these exist and people have done studies
now to think about whether they can find

428
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:20,960
now to think about whether they can find
 

429
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,790
now to think about whether they can find
them I mean it's an interesting Target

430
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:22,800
them I mean it's an interesting Target
 

431
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,350
them I mean it's an interesting Target
it's something you can measure by

432
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:24,360
it's something you can measure by
 

433
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,029
it's something you can measure by
measuring the positions and velocities

434
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:26,039
measuring the positions and velocities
 

435
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,189
measuring the positions and velocities
of stars you can find out what the

436
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:28,199
of stars you can find out what the
 

437
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:31,189
of stars you can find out what the
structure of the of the Milky Way is um

438
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:31,199
structure of the of the Milky Way is um
 

439
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,149
structure of the of the Milky Way is um
but the fun proposal was that the solar

440
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:34,159
but the fun proposal was that the solar
 

441
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,630
but the fun proposal was that the solar
system orbits around the Galaxy and as

442
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:36,640
system orbits around the Galaxy and as
 

443
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,829
system orbits around the Galaxy and as
it does so it goes a little bit up and

444
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:38,839
it does so it goes a little bit up and
 

445
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,190
it does so it goes a little bit up and
down kind of like horses on a Carousel

446
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:41,200
down kind of like horses on a Carousel
 

447
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,550
down kind of like horses on a Carousel
and the suggestion was every time it

448
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:42,560
and the suggestion was every time it
 

449
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,630
and the suggestion was every time it
goes through you have an enhanced

450
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:44,640
goes through you have an enhanced
 

451
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,150
goes through you have an enhanced
probability that you would dislodge

452
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,160
probability that you would dislodge
 

453
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,470
probability that you would dislodge
something from the edge of the solar

454
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
something from the edge of the solar
 

455
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,949
something from the edge of the solar
system and something called the or Cloud

456
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:50,959
system and something called the or Cloud
 

457
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,670
system and something called the or Cloud
so the idea was that at those times

458
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:52,680
so the idea was that at those times
 

459
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,269
so the idea was that at those times
you're more likely to have these

460
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:54,279
you're more likely to have these
 

461
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:57,350
you're more likely to have these
cataclysmic events such as the amazing

462
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,360
cataclysmic events such as the amazing
 

463
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,509
cataclysmic events such as the amazing
one that actually caused the last

464
00:08:59,509 --> 00:08:59,519
one that actually caused the last
 

465
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,710
one that actually caused the last
Extinction that we know of for sure it

466
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:01,720
Extinction that we know of for sure it
 

467
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,350
Extinction that we know of for sure it
wasn't so amazing for the dinosaurs or

468
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:04,360
wasn't so amazing for the dinosaurs or
 

469
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,030
wasn't so amazing for the dinosaurs or
for two-thirds of the species on the

470
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,040
for two-thirds of the species on the
 

471
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,710
for two-thirds of the species on the
planet yeah but it gets amazing for

472
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:07,720
planet yeah but it gets amazing for
 

473
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,350
planet yeah but it gets amazing for
humans who wouldn't be what really is

474
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:09,360
humans who wouldn't be what really is
 

475
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,630
humans who wouldn't be what really is
amazing I mean I I do I mean I talk

476
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:11,640
amazing I mean I I do I mean I talk
 

477
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,670
amazing I mean I I do I mean I talk
about this in dark matter in the

478
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:12,680
about this in dark matter in the
 

479
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,310
about this in dark matter in the
dinosaurs I it's just an amazing

480
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:14,320
dinosaurs I it's just an amazing
 

481
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,430
dinosaurs I it's just an amazing
scientific story because it really is

482
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:16,440
scientific story because it really is
 

483
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,750
scientific story because it really is
one of the real stories that combine

484
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:18,760
one of the real stories that combine
 

485
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,630
one of the real stories that combine
together different fields of science

486
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:20,640
together different fields of science
 

487
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,710
together different fields of science
geologists at the time or you know

488
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:23,720
geologists at the time or you know
 

489
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,990
geologists at the time or you know
people thought that things happened

490
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:25,000
people thought that things happened
 

491
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,870
people thought that things happened
slowly and this would be a cataclysmic

492
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:26,880
slowly and this would be a cataclysmic
 

493
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,910
slowly and this would be a cataclysmic
event and also I have to say you know if

494
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:28,920
event and also I have to say you know if
 

495
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,430
event and also I have to say you know if
you if you think about it it sounds like

496
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:30,440
you if you think about it it sounds like
 

497
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,350
you if you think about it it sounds like
a story like a 5-year-old would make up

498
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:32,360
a story like a 5-year-old would make up
 

499
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,069
a story like a 5-year-old would make up
maybe the dinosaurs were killed by some

500
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:34,079
maybe the dinosaurs were killed by some
 

501
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:36,870
maybe the dinosaurs were killed by some
big rock that came and hit the Earth but

502
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:36,880
big rock that came and hit the Earth but
 

503
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,470
big rock that came and hit the Earth but
then there really was a scientific story

504
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:39,480
then there really was a scientific story
 

505
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,230
then there really was a scientific story
behind it and that's also why I like the

506
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:41,240
behind it and that's also why I like the
 

507
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,590
behind it and that's also why I like the
dark disc because there's a scientific

508
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:42,600
dark disc because there's a scientific
 

509
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,750
dark disc because there's a scientific
story behind it so as farfetched as it

510
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:44,760
story behind it so as farfetched as it
 

511
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,990
story behind it so as farfetched as it
might sound you can actually go and look

512
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:47,000
might sound you can actually go and look
 

513
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,949
might sound you can actually go and look
for the experimental consequences or the

514
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:48,959
for the experimental consequences or the
 

515
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,670
for the experimental consequences or the
observational consequences to test

516
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:50,680
observational consequences to test
 

517
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,190
observational consequences to test
whether it's true I wish you could know

518
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,200
whether it's true I wish you could know
 

519
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,710
whether it's true I wish you could know
like high resolution details of where

520
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:56,720
like high resolution details of where
 

521
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,230
like high resolution details of where
that asteroid came from like where in

522
00:09:59,230 --> 00:09:59,240
that asteroid came from like where in
 

523
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,790
that asteroid came from like where in
the OR Cloud why it happened is it in

524
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:01,800
the OR Cloud why it happened is it in
 

525
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,310
the OR Cloud why it happened is it in
fact because of dark matter it's like

526
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:03,320
fact because of dark matter it's like
 

527
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,910
fact because of dark matter it's like
the full tracing back to the origin of

528
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:04,920
the full tracing back to the origin of
 

529
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,710
the full tracing back to the origin of
the universe CU it humans seem to be

530
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:07,720
the universe CU it humans seem to be
 

531
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,110
the universe CU it humans seem to be
somewhat special but just it seems like

532
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:10,120
somewhat special but just it seems like
 

533
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,790
somewhat special but just it seems like
so many fascinating events at all scales

534
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:12,800
so many fascinating events at all scales
 

535
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,470
so many fascinating events at all scales
at all scales of physics had to happen

536
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:15,480
at all scales of physics had to happen
 

537
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,470
at all scales of physics had to happen
for so I'm really really glad you

538
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:17,480
for so I'm really really glad you
 

539
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,430
for so I'm really really glad you
mentioned that because actually that was

540
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:19,440
mentioned that because actually that was
 

541
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,110
mentioned that because actually that was
one of the main points of my book dark

542
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,120
one of the main points of my book dark
 

543
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,470
one of the main points of my book dark
matter in the dinosaurs one of the

544
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:22,480
matter in the dinosaurs one of the
 

545
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,269
matter in the dinosaurs one of the
reasons I wrote it was because I really

546
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:25,279
reasons I wrote it was because I really
 

547
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,750
reasons I wrote it was because I really
think we are abusing the planet we're

548
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:26,760
think we are abusing the planet we're
 

549
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,110
think we are abusing the planet we're
changing the planet way too quickly and

550
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:29,120
changing the planet way too quickly and
 

551
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,509
changing the planet way too quickly and
just like anything else when you alter

552
00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:30,519
just like anything else when you alter
 

553
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:31,750
just like anything else when you alter
things it's good to think about the

554
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:31,760
things it's good to think about the
 

555
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,389
things it's good to think about the
history of what it took to get here and

556
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:34,399
history of what it took to get here and
 

557
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,069
history of what it took to get here and
and as you point out it took many

558
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:37,079
and as you point out it took many
 

559
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:39,190
and as you point out it took many
operations on many different scales you

560
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:39,200
operations on many different scales you
 

561
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,190
operations on many different scales you
know we had to have the formation of of

562
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:41,200
know we had to have the formation of of
 

563
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,069
know we had to have the formation of of
structure the formation of galaxies the

564
00:10:43,069 --> 00:10:43,079
structure the formation of galaxies the
 

565
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:44,430
structure the formation of galaxies the
formation of the solar system the

566
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:44,440

formation of our planet the formation of
 

569
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,230
formation of our planet the formation of
humans I mean there's so many steps that

570
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:48,240
humans I mean there's so many steps that
 

571
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,750
humans I mean there's so many steps that
go into this and humans in some part

572
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:50,760
go into this and humans in some part
 

573
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,230
go into this and humans in some part
were the result of the fact that this

574
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:53,240
were the result of the fact that this
 

575
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,949
were the result of the fact that this
big object hit the earth made the

576
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:54,959
big object hit the earth made the
 

577
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,430
big object hit the earth made the
dinosaurs go extinct and mammals

578
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:56,440
dinosaurs go extinct and mammals
 

579
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,670
dinosaurs go extinct and mammals
developed I mean it is an incredible

580
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:58,680
developed I mean it is an incredible
 

581
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,870
developed I mean it is an incredible
story

582
00:10:59,870 --> 00:10:59,880
story
 

583
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,430
story
and yes something else might come of it

584
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:02,440
and yes something else might come of it
 

585
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,470
and yes something else might come of it
but it won't be us if we mess with it

586
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:04,480
but it won't be us if we mess with it
 

587
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,750
but it won't be us if we mess with it
too much but it is an a grand scale

588
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:07,760
too much but it is an a grand scale
 

589
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,710
too much but it is an a grand scale
Earth is a pretty resilient

590
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:11,720
Earth is a pretty resilient
 

591
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,910
Earth is a pretty resilient
system uh C can you just clarify just

592
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:14,920
system uh C can you just clarify just
 

593
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,550
system uh C can you just clarify just
fascinating uh the shape of things so

594
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:18,560
fascinating uh the shape of things so
 

595
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,870
fascinating uh the shape of things so
the shape of the Milky Ways of the

596
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:20,880
the shape of the Milky Ways of the
 

597
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,430
the shape of the Milky Ways of the
observable stuff is mostly

598
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:23,440
observable stuff is mostly
 

599
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,350
observable stuff is mostly
flat and then you said Dark Matter tends

600
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:26,360
flat and then you said Dark Matter tends
 

601
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,990
flat and then you said Dark Matter tends
to be spherical but a subset of might be

602
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,000
to be spherical but a subset of might be
 

603
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,310
to be spherical but a subset of might be
a flat disc so you want to hear about

604
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:32,320
a flat disc so you want to hear about
 

605
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,310
a flat disc so you want to hear about
the shape of things yes yes please so

606
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:36,320
the shape of things yes yes please so
 

607
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,470
the shape of things yes yes please so
structure formed early on and now our

608
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:38,480
structure formed early on and now our
 

609
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,470
structure formed early on and now our
structure that we live in is so we know

610
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:41,480
structure that we live in is so we know
 

611
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,750
structure that we live in is so we know
about the Milky Way galaxy so the Milky

612
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:43,760
about the Milky Way galaxy so the Milky
 

613
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,990
about the Milky Way galaxy so the Milky
Way galaxy has the dis you can see in a

614
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:47,000
Way galaxy has the dis you can see in a
 

615
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,030
Way galaxy has the dis you can see in a
dry dark place that's where stars and

616
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:50,040
dry dark place that's where stars and
 

617
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:55,069
dry dark place that's where stars and
light is but you can also measure in

618
00:11:55,069 --> 00:11:55,079
light is but you can also measure in
 

619
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:58,310
light is but you can also measure in
some ways the dark matter and we believe

620
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,320
some ways the dark matter and we believe
 

621
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,110
some ways the dark matter and we believe
that dark matter is more or less

622
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:00,120
that dark matter is more or less
 

623
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,190
that dark matter is more or less
spherically

624
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:01,200
spherically
 

625
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,870
spherically
distributed um and like we said there's

626
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:03,880
distributed um and like we said there's
 

627
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,670
distributed um and like we said there's
a lot of it not necessarily in the dis

628
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:06,680
a lot of it not necessarily in the dis
 

629
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,430
a lot of it not necessarily in the dis
but just because it's a sphere there's a

630
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:08,440
but just because it's a sphere there's a
 

631
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,910
but just because it's a sphere there's a
lot of it sitting there and the reason

632
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:11,920
lot of it sitting there and the reason
 

633
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,230
lot of it sitting there and the reason
it doesn't collapse as far as we know is

634
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:14,240
it doesn't collapse as far as we know is
 

635
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,030
it doesn't collapse as far as we know is
that it doesn't really it can't radiate

636
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:16,040
that it doesn't really it can't radiate
 

637
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,189
that it doesn't really it can't radiate
the same way so because it can radiate

638
00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:18,199
the same way so because it can radiate
 

639
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:19,629
the same way so because it can radiate
ordinary matter collapses and it's

640
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:19,639
ordinary matter collapses and it's
 

641
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,389
ordinary matter collapses and it's
actually because of conservation of

642
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:21,399
actually because of conservation of
 

643
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:24,069
actually because of conservation of
angular momentum it be it stays a dis

644
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:24,079
angular momentum it be it stays a dis
 

645
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,470
angular momentum it be it stays a dis
and it doesn't just collapse to the

646
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:25,480
and it doesn't just collapse to the
 

647
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,990
and it doesn't just collapse to the
center so our suggestion was that maybe

648
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:29,000
center so our suggestion was that maybe
 

649
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,670
center so our suggestion was that maybe
there are some components of dark matter

650
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:30,680
there are some components of dark matter
 

651
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,590
there are some components of dark matter
that also radiate like I said that's far

652
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:32,600
that also radiate like I said that's far
 

653
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,110
that also radiate like I said that's far
from proven people have looked for a

654
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:34,120
from proven people have looked for a
 

655
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,110
from proven people have looked for a
disc they see some evidence of some

656
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:36,120
disc they see some evidence of some
 

657
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,910
disc they see some evidence of some
discs of certain densities but I see

658
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:38,920
discs of certain densities but I see
 

659
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,150
discs of certain densities but I see
these are all questions that are worth

660
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,160
these are all questions that are worth
 

661
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,269
these are all questions that are worth
asking basically if we can figure it out

662
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:42,279
asking basically if we can figure it out
 

663
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:44,590
asking basically if we can figure it out
from existing measurements why not try

664
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:44,600
from existing measurements why not try
 

665
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,509
from existing measurements why not try
Okay so there's not all Dark Matters

666
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:46,519
Okay so there's not all Dark Matters
 

667
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:48,670
Okay so there's not all Dark Matters
made the same this well that's a

668
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:48,680
made the same this well that's a
 

669
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,629
made the same this well that's a
possibility we actually don't know what

670
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:50,639
possibility we actually don't know what
 

671
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,670
possibility we actually don't know what
dark matter is in the first place we

672
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:52,680
dark matter is in the first place we
 

673
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,949
dark matter is in the first place we
don't know what most of it is we don't

674
00:12:53,949 --> 00:12:53,959
don't know what most of it is we don't
 

675
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:55,790
don't know what most of it is we don't
know what a fraction is I mean it's hard

676
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:55,800
know what a fraction is I mean it's hard
 

677
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,509
know what a fraction is I mean it's hard
to measure why is it hard to measure for

678
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:57,519
to measure why is it hard to measure for
 

679
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,310
to measure why is it hard to measure for
exactly the reason you said earlier we

680
00:12:59,310 --> 00:12:59,320
exactly the reason you said earlier we
 

681
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,750
exactly the reason you said earlier we
don't see it so we want to think of

682
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:01,760
don't see it so we want to think of
 

683
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,509
don't see it so we want to think of
possibilities for what it can be if

684
00:13:04,509 --> 00:13:04,519
possibilities for what it can be if
 

685
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,910
possibilities for what it can be if
especially if those give rise to some of

00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:06,920
especially if those give rise to some of
 

687
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,189
especially if those give rise to some of
observational consequences I mean it's

688
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:09,199
observational consequences I mean it's
 

689
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:11,110
observational consequences I mean it's
it's a tough game because it's not

00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:11,120
it's a tough game because it's not

could be and how you might find it and
 

697
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,670
could be and how you might find it and
the way you detect it is gravitational

701
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:23,829
effects on things we can see that would
be the way you detect the type of Dark

702
00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:23,839
be the way you detect the type of Dark

Matter I've been talking about people

704
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:25,720
Matter I've been talking about people
 

705
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,829
Matter I've been talking about people
have suggestions for other forms of dark

706
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:27,839
have suggestions for other forms of dark
 

707
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,710
have suggestions for other forms of dark
matter they could be particles called

708
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:29,720
matter they could be particles called
 

709
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,430
matter they could be particles called
axons they could be other types of

00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:31,440
axons they could be other types of
 

711
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,030
axons they could be other types of
particles and then there are different

712
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,040
particles and then there are different
 

713
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,110
particles and then there are different
ways of detecting it I mean the most

714
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,120
ways of detecting it I mean the most
 

715
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,910
ways of detecting it I mean the most
popular candidate for Dark Matter

716
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:36,920
popular candidate for Dark Matter
 

717
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,269
popular candidate for Dark Matter
probably until pretty recently because

718
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:38,279
probably until pretty recently because
 

719
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:40,150
probably until pretty recently because
they haven't found it is something

720
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,160
they haven't found it is something
 

721
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,150
they haven't found it is something
called wimps weekly interacting mass of

722
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,160
called wimps weekly interacting mass of
 

723
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,550
called wimps weekly interacting mass of
particles um particles that have mass

724
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:44,560
particles um particles that have mass
 

725
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,550
particles um particles that have mass
about the same as the Hig boson Mass um

726
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:47,560
about the same as the Hig boson Mass um
 

727
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,030
about the same as the Hig boson Mass um
and it turns out then you would get

728
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:49,040
and it turns out then you would get
 

729
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,310
and it turns out then you would get
about the right density of dark matter

730
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:51,320
about the right density of dark matter
 

731
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,230
about the right density of dark matter
but then people really like that of

732
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:53,240
but then people really like that of
 

733
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,470
but then people really like that of
course because it is connected to the

734
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:55,480
course because it is connected to the
 

735
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,310
course because it is connected to the
standard model the particles that we

736
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:57,320
standard model the particles that we
 

737
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,749
standard model the particles that we
know about and if it's connected to that

738
00:13:59,749 --> 00:13:59,759
know about and if it's connected to that
 

739
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:00,990
know about and if it's connected to that
we have a better chance of actually

740
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:01,000
we have a better chance of actually
 

741
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,949
we have a better chance of actually
seeing it fortunately or unfortunately

742
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:02,959
seeing it fortunately or unfortunately
 

743
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,069
seeing it fortunately or unfortunately
it's also a better chance that you can

744
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:04,079
it's also a better chance that you can
 

745
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,829
it's also a better chance that you can
rule it out because you can look for it

746
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:05,839
rule it out because you can look for it
 

747
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,269
rule it out because you can look for it
and so far no one has found it we're

748
00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:07,279
and so far no one has found it we're
 

749
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,069
and so far no one has found it we're
still looking for it is that one of the

750
00:14:09,069 --> 00:14:09,079
still looking for it is that one of the
 

751
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:11,910
still looking for it is that one of the

755
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,949
was originally one of the hopes of the

the other hand I've been in physics long
enough to know it was also a cautionary

794
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,040
enough to know it was also a cautionary
 

795
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,189
enough to know it was also a cautionary
Tale in some sense because um at the

796
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:09,199
Tale in some sense because um at the
 

797
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,430
Tale in some sense because um at the
time I started out in physics we had

798
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:11,440
time I started out in physics we had
 

799
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,670
time I started out in physics we had
some proposed something in the United

800
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:12,680
some proposed something in the United
 

801
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,590
some proposed something in the United
States called the superconducting super

802
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:14,600
States called the superconducting super
 

803
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,430
States called the superconducting super
collider a lot of physicists I'll say

804
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:17,440
collider a lot of physicists I'll say
 

805
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,389
collider a lot of physicists I'll say
particularly in Europe but I'd say a lot

806
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:19,399
particularly in Europe but I'd say a lot
 

807
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:21,189
particularly in Europe but I'd say a lot
of physicists were Sayang when that the

808
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:21,199
of physicists were Sayang when that the
 

809
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,230
of physicists were Sayang when that the
large hyron collider would have the

810
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:23,240
large hyron collider would have the
 

811
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,189
large hyron collider would have the
energy reach necessary to discover what

812
00:15:26,189 --> 00:15:26,199
energy reach necessary to discover what
 

813
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:27,790
energy reach necessary to discover what
underlies the standard M we don't want

814
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:27,800
underlies the standard M we don't want
 

815
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,350
underlies the standard M we don't want
to just discover the we want to know

816
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:29,360
to just discover the we want to know
 

817
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,590
to just discover the we want to know
what the next step is and I think here

818
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:32,600
what the next step is and I think here
 

819
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,110
what the next step is and I think here
um people were more cautious about that

820
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:34,120
um people were more cautious about that
 

821
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,110
um people were more cautious about that
they wanted to have a more comprehensive

822
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:36,120
they wanted to have a more comprehensive
 

823
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,590
they wanted to have a more comprehensive
search that could get to higher energies

824
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:38,600
search that could get to higher energies
 

825
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,710
search that could get to higher energies
more events so that we could you know we

826
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:40,720
more events so that we could you know we
 

827
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,430
more events so that we could you know we
could really more definitively rule it

828
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:42,440
could really more definitively rule it
 

829
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,910
could really more definitively rule it
out but in that case many people thought

830
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:44,920
out but in that case many people thought
 

831
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,030
out but in that case many people thought
they knew what would be there it would

832
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:46,040
they knew what would be there it would
 

833
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,670
they knew what would be there it would
happen to be a theory called super

834
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:47,680
happen to be a theory called super
 

835
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,350
happen to be a theory called super
symmetry so a lot of physicists thought

836
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:49,360
symmetry so a lot of physicists thought
 

837
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,470
symmetry so a lot of physicists thought
it would be super symmetry I mean it's

838
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:51,480
it would be super symmetry I mean it's
 

839
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,069
it would be super symmetry I mean it's
one of the many factors I think that

840
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:53,079
one of the many factors I think that
 

841
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:55,069
one of the many factors I think that
went into the fact that the large hron

842
00:15:55,069 --> 00:15:55,079
went into the fact that the large hron
 

843
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,269
went into the fact that the large hron
glider became the only machine in town

844
00:15:57,269 --> 00:15:57,279
glider became the only machine in town
 

845
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,269
glider became the only machine in town
and um the super conducting super

846
00:15:59,269 --> 00:15:59,279
and um the super conducting super
 

847
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,230
and um the super conducting super
collider would have just been a much if

848
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:01,240
collider would have just been a much if
 

849
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,590
collider would have just been a much if
it really had achieved what it was

850
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:02,600
it really had achieved what it was
 

851
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,749
it really had achieved what it was
supposed to would have been a much more

852
00:16:04,749 --> 00:16:04,759
supposed to would have been a much more
 

853
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:07,670
supposed to would have been a much more
robust test of of the space so so I'd

854
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:07,680
robust test of of the space so so I'd
 

855
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,470
robust test of of the space so so I'd
say for Humanity it's both a tribute to

856
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:11,480
say for Humanity it's both a tribute to
 

857
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,189
say for Humanity it's both a tribute to
the ability of Discovery and the ability

858
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:13,199
the ability of Discovery and the ability
 

859
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,870
the ability of Discovery and the ability
of really believing in things so that

860
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:14,880
of really believing in things so that
 

861
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,150
of really believing in things so that
you have the confidence to go look for

862
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,160
you have the confidence to go look for
 

863
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,189
you have the confidence to go look for
them but it's also a cautionary tale

864
00:16:18,189 --> 00:16:18,199
them but it's also a cautionary tale
 

865
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:21,629
them but it's also a cautionary tale
that you don't want to you know assume

866
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:21,639
that you don't want to you know assume
 

867
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:23,189
that you don't want to you know assume
things before they've been actually

868
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:23,199
things before they've been actually
 

869
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,629
things before they've been actually
found so you want to do things in you

870
00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:25,639
found so you want to do things in you
 

871
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:27,150
found so you want to do things in you
know you you want to believe in your

872
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:27,160
know you you want to believe in your
 

873
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,629
know you you want to believe in your
theories but you also want to question

874
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:28,639
theories but you also want to question
 

875
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,230
theories but you also want to question
them at the same time in ways that

876
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:30,240
them at the same time in ways that
 

877
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,350
them at the same time in ways that
you're more likely to discover the truth

878
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:32,360
you're more likely to discover the truth
 

879
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,069
you're more likely to discover the truth
but it's also an illustration of grand

880
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:35,079
but it's also an illustration of grand
 

881
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:36,829
but it's also an illustration of grand
engineering efforts that Humanity can

882
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:36,839
engineering efforts that Humanity can
 

883
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:40,430
engineering efforts that Humanity can
take on and maybe a lesson that you

884
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:40,440
take on and maybe a lesson that you
 

885
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,710
take on and maybe a lesson that you
could go even

886
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:41,720
could go even
 

887
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,189
could go even
bigger um I I'm really glad you said

888
00:16:44,189 --> 00:16:44,199
bigger um I I'm really glad you said
 

889
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:46,189
bigger um I I'm really glad you said
that though too because that that's

890
00:16:46,189 --> 00:16:46,199
that though too because that that's
 

891
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:48,309
that though too because that that's
absolutely true I mean it's it really is

892
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:48,319
absolutely true I mean it's it really is
 

893
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:50,990
absolutely true I mean it's it really is
an impressive it's it's impressive in so

894
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:51,000
an impressive it's it's impressive in so
 

895
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,350
an impressive it's it's impressive in so
many ways it's impressive

896
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:52,360
many ways it's impressive
 

897
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,710
many ways it's impressive
technologically is impressive at

898
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:53,720
technologically is impressive at
 

899
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,030
technologically is impressive at
engineering level it's also impressive

900
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:56,040
engineering level it's also impressive
 

901
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,030
engineering level it's also impressive
that so many countries work together um

902
00:16:59,030 --> 00:16:59,040
that so many countries work together um
 

903
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,910
that so many countries work together um
to to do this it wasn't just one country

904
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:01,920
to to do this it wasn't just one country
 

905
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,870
to to do this it wasn't just one country
and how it was it was also impressive in

906
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:03,880
and how it was it was also impressive in
 

907
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,230
and how it was it was also impressive in
that it was a long-term project that

908
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:06,240
that it was a long-term project that
 

909
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,350
that it was a long-term project that
people committed to and made it happen

910
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:09,360
people committed to and made it happen
 

911
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,309
people committed to and made it happen
so it is a demonstration that when

912
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:12,319
so it is a demonstration that when
 

913
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,829
so it is a demonstration that when
people set their minds to things and

914
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:14,839
people set their minds to things and
 

915
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,669
people set their minds to things and
they commit to it that they can do

916
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:16,679
they commit to it that they can do
 

917
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:19,630
they commit to it that they can do
something amazing but also in the United

918
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:19,640
something amazing but also in the United
 

919
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,230
something amazing but also in the United
States uh maybe a lesson that

920
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:21,240
States uh maybe a lesson that
 

921
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,069
States uh maybe a lesson that
bureaucracy can slow things down to

922
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:24,079
bureaucracy can slow things down to
 

923
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,110
bureaucracy can slow things down to
bureaucracy and and politics politics

924
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:27,120
bureaucracy and and politics politics
 

925
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,029
bureaucracy and and politics politics
and economics many many things can make

926
00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:30,039
and economics many many things can make
 

927
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:32,390
and economics many many things can make
them faster and make them slower so

928
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:32,400
them faster and make them slower so
 

929
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,390
them faster and make them slower so
science is the way to make progress

930
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:34,400
science is the way to make progress
 

931
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,909
science is the way to make progress
politics is the way to slow that

932
00:17:36,909 --> 00:17:36,919
politics is the way to slow that
 

933
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:39,150
politics is the way to slow that
progress down and here we are well I

934
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:39,160
progress down and here we are well I
 

935
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,510
progress down and here we are well I
don't want to overstate that because

936
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:40,520
don't want to overstate that because
 

937
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,830
don't want to overstate that because
without Politics the you know the L

938
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:42,840
without Politics the you know the L
 

939
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,950
without Politics the you know the L
wouldn't happen either so um but you

940
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:45,960
wouldn't happen either so um but you
 

941
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,350
wouldn't happen either so um but you
need broccoli

942
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:48,360
need broccoli
 

943
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,870
need broccoli
um but sometimes I do think I mean

944
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:51,880
um but sometimes I do think I mean
 

945
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,270
um but sometimes I do think I mean
you're not asking this question but

946
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:54,280
you're not asking this question but
 

947
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,029
you're not asking this question but
sometimes I do think when I you know

948
00:17:56,029 --> 00:17:56,039
sometimes I do think when I you know
 

949
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:58,390
sometimes I do think when I you know
think about some of these conflicts you

950
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:58,400
think about some of these conflicts you
 

951
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,630
think about some of these conflicts you
you know sometimes it's just good to

952
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:00,640
you know sometimes it's just good to
 

953
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,590
you know sometimes it's just good to
have a project that people work on

954
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:02,600
have a project that people work on
 

955
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,630
have a project that people work on
together and there were some efforts to

956
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:05,640
together and there were some efforts to
 

957
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,110
together and there were some efforts to
do that with in science too to have

958
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:08,120
do that with in science too to have
 

959
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,710
do that with in science too to have
Palestinians and Israelis work together

960
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:10,720
Palestinians and Israelis work together
 

961
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,270
Palestinians and Israelis work together
project called Sesame um I think it's

962
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:13,280
project called Sesame um I think it's
 

963
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,230
project called Sesame um I think it's
not a bad idea when you can do that um

964
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:15,240
not a bad idea when you can do that um
 

965
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,390
not a bad idea when you can do that um
when you can get you

966
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:17,400
when you can get you
 

967
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,830
when you can get you
know sort of for forget the politics and

968
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:20,840
know sort of for forget the politics and
 

969
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,870
know sort of for forget the politics and
just focus on some particular project

970
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:23,880
just focus on some particular project
 

971
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,630
just focus on some particular project
sometimes that can work some kind of

972
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:25,640
sometimes that can work some kind of
 

973
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,310
sometimes that can work some kind of
forcing function some kind of deadline

974
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:27,320
forcing function some kind of deadline
 

975
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,149
forcing function some kind of deadline
that gets people to sit in room together

976
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:29,159
that gets people to sit in room together
 

977
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:31,950
that gets people to sit in room together
and you're working on a thing but as

978
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:31,960
and you're working on a thing but as
 

979
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,590
and you're working on a thing but as
part of that you realize the common

980
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:34,600
part of that you realize the common
 

981
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,909
part of that you realize the common
Humanity that you all have the same

982
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:36,919
Humanity that you all have the same
 

983
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:38,870
Humanity that you all have the same
concerns the same hopes the same fears

984
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:38,880
concerns the same hopes the same fears
 

985
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,230
concerns the same hopes the same fears
the same that you all human and that's

986
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:41,240
the same that you all human and that's
 

987
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,590
the same that you all human and that's
an accidental side effect of working

988
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:43,600
an accidental side effect of working
 

989
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,870
an accidental side effect of working
together on a thing I that's absolutely

990
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:45,880
together on a thing I that's absolutely
 

991
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,149
together on a thing I that's absolutely
true and it's one of the reasons CERN

992
00:18:47,149 --> 00:18:47,159
true and it's one of the reasons CERN
 

993
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,190
true and it's one of the reasons CERN
was formed actually it was post World

994
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:49,200
was formed actually it was post World
 

995
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,750
was formed actually it was post World
War II and lot of European physicists

996
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:51,760
War II and lot of European physicists
 

997
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,870
War II and lot of European physicists
had actually left Europe and they wanted

998
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:53,880
had actually left Europe and they wanted
 

999
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,029
had actually left Europe and they wanted
to see Europeans work together and and

1000
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:56,039
to see Europeans work together and and
 

1001
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:59,630
to see Europeans work together and and
sort of rebuild and and it worked I mean

1002
00:18:59,630 --> 00:18:59,640
sort of rebuild and and it worked I mean
 

1003
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,029
sort of rebuild and and it worked I mean
they they did and it's true and I often

1004
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:02,039
they they did and it's true and I often
 

1005
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:04,070
they they did and it's true and I often
think that that you know one of the

1006
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:04,080
think that that you know one of the
 

1007
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,029
think that that you know one of the
major problems is we just don't meet

1008
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:06,039
major problems is we just don't meet
 

1009
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:07,710
major problems is we just don't meet
enough people so that everyone think

1010
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:07,720
enough people so that everyone think
 

1011
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,549
enough people so that everyone think
seems like when they seem like the other

1012
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:09,559
seems like when they seem like the other
 

1013
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:12,190
seems like when they seem like the other
it's more easy to forget their Humanity

1014
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:12,200
it's more easy to forget their Humanity
 

1015
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,070
it's more easy to forget their Humanity
so I think it it is important to have

1016
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,080
so I think it it is important to have
 

1017
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,270
so I think it it is important to have
these

1018
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:15,280
these
 

1019
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,750
these

1020
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:17,760
connections given the

involved here that led to the extension
of the dinosaurs when you look out at

1026
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:25,520
of the dinosaurs when you look out at
 

1027
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,630
of the dinosaurs when you look out at
the future of Earth do you worry about

1028
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:27,640
the future of Earth do you worry about
 

1029
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,669
the future of Earth do you worry about
future Extinction events I I do think

1030
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:30,679
future Extinction events I I do think
 

1031
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:31,950
future Extinction events I I do think
that we might be in the middle of an

1032
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:31,960
that we might be in the middle of an
 

1033
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,750
that we might be in the middle of an
Extinction right now if you define it by

1034
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:34,760
Extinction right now if you define it by
 

1035
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,149
Extinction right now if you define it by
the number of species that are getting

1036
00:19:36,149 --> 00:19:36,159
the number of species that are getting
 

1037
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:39,070
the number of species that are getting
killed off and it's subtle but you know

1038
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:39,080
killed off and it's subtle but you know
 

1039
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,630
killed off and it's subtle but you know
it's a complex system the way things

1040
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:41,640
it's a complex system the way things
 

1041
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,950
it's a complex system the way things
respond to events is sometimes things

1042
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:44,960
respond to events is sometimes things
 

1043
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,190
respond to events is sometimes things
evolve sometimes animals just move to

1044
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:47,200
evolve sometimes animals just move to
 

1045
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,710
evolve sometimes animals just move to
another place and the way we've

1046
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:49,720
another place and the way we've
 

1047
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,070
another place and the way we've
developed the Earth it's very hard for

1048
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,080
developed the Earth it's very hard for
 

1049
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,430
developed the Earth it's very hard for
species just to move somewhere else and

1050
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:54,440
species just to move somewhere else and
 

1051
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,510
species just to move somewhere else and
we're seeing that with people now too I

1052
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:57,520
we're seeing that with people now too I
 

1053
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,830
we're seeing that with people now too I
mean I know people people are worried

1054
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:58,840
mean I know people people are worried
 

1055
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,029
mean I know people people are worried
just about AI taking over and that's a

1056
00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:01,039
just about AI taking over and that's a
 

1057
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,270
just about AI taking over and that's a
totally different story we just don't

1058
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:03,280
totally different story we just don't
 

1059
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,750
totally different story we just don't
think about the future very much we

1060
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:04,760
think about the future very much we
 

1061
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,270
think about the future very much we
think about what we're doing now and we

1062
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:06,280
think about what we're doing now and we
 

1063
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,430
think about what we're doing now and we
certainly don't think enough about all

1064
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:08,440
certainly don't think enough about all
 

1065
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,149
certainly don't think enough about all
the animals that we're destroying all

1066
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:10,159
the animals that we're destroying all
 

1067
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,149
the animals that we're destroying all
the things that are precursors to humans

1068
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:12,159
the things that are precursors to humans
 

1069
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,909
the things that are precursors to humans
that we sort of rely on it's interesting

1070
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:14,919
that we sort of rely on it's interesting
 

1071
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:18,590
that we sort of rely on it's interesting
to to think whether the the the things

1072
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:18,600
to to think whether the the the things
 

1073
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,830
to to think whether the the the things
that threaten us is the stuff we see

1074
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:21,840
that threaten us is the stuff we see
 

1075
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,070
that threaten us is the stuff we see
that's happening gradually or the stuff

1076
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,080
that's happening gradually or the stuff
 

1077
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,510
that's happening gradually or the stuff
we don't really see that's going to

1078
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:25,520
we don't really see that's going to
 

1079
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,830
we don't really see that's going to
happen all of a sudden I sometimes like

1080
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:27,840
happen all of a sudden I sometimes like
 

1081
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,870
happen all of a sudden I sometimes like
think about what is what should we be

1082
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:30,880
think about what is what should we be
 

1083
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,909
think about what is what should we be
more worried about cuz it seems like

1084
00:20:32,909 --> 00:20:32,919
more worried about cuz it seems like
 

1085
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:35,270
more worried about cuz it seems like
like with the asteroids or nuclear war

1086
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,280
like with the asteroids or nuclear war
 

1087
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,909
like with the asteroids or nuclear war
it could be stuff that just happens one

1088
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:37,919
it could be stuff that just happens one
 

1089
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,830
it could be stuff that just happens one
day you know when I say one day meaning

1090
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:40,840
day you know when I say one day meaning
 

1091
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,029
day you know when I say one day meaning
over a span of a few days or a few

1092
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:43,039
over a span of a few days or a few
 

1093
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,270
over a span of a few days or a few
months but on a you know not on a scale

1094
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:46,280
months but on a you know not on a scale
 

1095
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,909
months but on a you know not on a scale
of decades and

1096
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:47,919
of decades and
 

1097
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,669
of decades and
centuries because we sometimes mostly

1098
00:20:50,669 --> 00:20:50,679
centuries because we sometimes mostly
 

1099
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:53,630
centuries because we sometimes mostly
talk about stuff that's happening

1100
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:53,640
talk about stuff that's happening
 

1101
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,630
talk about stuff that's happening
gradually but we can be really

1102
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:56,640
gradually but we can be really
 

1103
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,310
gradually but we can be really
surprised it's actually really

1104
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:58,320
surprised it's actually really
 

1105
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,510
surprised it's actually really
interesting and that was actually one of

1106
00:20:59,510 --> 00:20:59,520
interesting and that was actually one of
 

1107
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,710
interesting and that was actually one of
the reasons it took a while to determine

1108
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:02,720
the reasons it took a while to determine
 

1109
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,070
the reasons it took a while to determine
what it was that had caused the last

1110
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,080
what it was that had caused the last
 

1111
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,350
what it was that had caused the last
extinction because people did think at

1112
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:06,360
extinction because people did think at
 

1113
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,070
extinction because people did think at
the time many people thought that things

1114
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:08,080
the time many people thought that things
 

1115
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,950
the time many people thought that things
were more gradual and the idea of

1116
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:09,960
were more gradual and the idea of
 

1117
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,590
were more gradual and the idea of
Extinction was a very was actually a

1118
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:11,600
Extinction was a very was actually a
 

1119
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,269
Extinction was a very was actually a
novel concept at some point you know I

1120
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:14,279
novel concept at some point you know I
 

1121
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:16,390
novel concept at some point you know I
mean these aren't predictable events

1122
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:16,400
mean these aren't predictable events
 

1123
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,870
mean these aren't predictable events
necessarily they're only predictable on

1124
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:17,880
necessarily they're only predictable on
 

1125
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,830
necessarily they're only predictable on
a grand scale um but sometimes sometimes

1126
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:20,840
a grand scale um but sometimes sometimes
 

1127
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:26,149
a grand scale um but sometimes sometimes
they are and and I think people were

1128
00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:26,159
they are and and I think people were
 

1129
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,750
they are and and I think people were
pretty aware that nuclear um weapons

1130
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:28,760
pretty aware that nuclear um weapons
 

1131
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,390
pretty aware that nuclear um weapons
were dangerous I'm not sure people are

1132
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:30,400
were dangerous I'm not sure people are
 

1133
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,870
were dangerous I'm not sure people are
as aware now as they were you know say

1134
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:32,880
as aware now as they were you know say
 

1135
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,470
as aware now as they were you know say
20 or 30 years ago and that certainly

1136
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:35,480
20 or 30 years ago and that certainly
 

1137
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,510
20 or 30 years ago and that certainly
worries me um I have to say I was not as

1138
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:39,520
worries me um I have to say I was not as
 

1139
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,870
worries me um I have to say I was not as
worried about AI as other people but now

1140
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:41,880
worried about AI as other people but now
 

1141
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,350
worried about AI as other people but now
I understand and it's not I mean it's

1142
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:44,360
I understand and it's not I mean it's
 

1143
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,870
I understand and it's not I mean it's
more that as soon as you create things

1144
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:46,880
more that as soon as you create things
 

1145
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,710
more that as soon as you create things
that we lose control over it's scary and

1146
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:50,720
that we lose control over it's scary and
 

1147
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,070
that we lose control over it's scary and
the other thing that we're learning from

1148
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,080
the other thing that we're learning from
 

1149
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,430
the other thing that we're learning from
the events today is that is that it

1150
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:54,440
the events today is that is that it
 

1151
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,230
the events today is that is that it
takes a few bad actors it takes everyone

1152
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:56,240
takes a few bad actors it takes everyone
 

1153
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,230
takes a few bad actors it takes everyone
to sort of make things work well well it

1154
00:21:59,230 --> 00:21:59,240
to sort of make things work well well it
 

1155
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,830
to sort of make things work well well it
takes not that many things to make

1156
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:00,840
takes not that many things to make
 

1157
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,870
takes not that many things to make
things go wrong it's it's the issue with

1158
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:02,880
things go wrong it's it's the issue with
 

1159
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,669
things go wrong it's it's the issue with
disease you know we can find out what

1160
00:22:04,669 --> 00:22:04,679
disease you know we can find out what
 

1161
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:06,549
disease you know we can find out what
causes a disease but to make things

1162
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:06,559
causes a disease but to make things
 

1163
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,950
causes a disease but to make things
better is not necessarily that simple

1164
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:08,960
better is not necessarily that simple
 

1165
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,590
better is not necessarily that simple
sometimes it is but for things to be

1166
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:11,600
sometimes it is but for things to be
 

1167
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,669
sometimes it is but for things to be
healthy a lot of things have to work for

1168
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:13,679
healthy a lot of things have to work for
 

1169
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,669
healthy a lot of things have to work for
things to go wrong only one thing has to

1170
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:15,679
things to go wrong only one thing has to
 

1171
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,149
things to go wrong only one thing has to
go wrong and so it's amazing that we do

1172
00:22:19,149 --> 00:22:19,159
go wrong and so it's amazing that we do
 

1173
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:20,669
go wrong and so it's amazing that we do
it and the same is true for democracy

1174
00:22:20,669 --> 00:22:20,679
it and the same is true for democracy
 

1175
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:22,230
it and the same is true for democracy
for democracy to work a lot of people

1176
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:22,240
for democracy to work a lot of people
 

1177
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,510
for democracy to work a lot of people
have to believe in it a few bad actors

1178
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:24,520
have to believe in it a few bad actors
 

1179
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,230
have to believe in it a few bad actors
can destroy things sometimes so a lot of

1180
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:28,240
can destroy things sometimes so a lot of
 

1181
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,789
can destroy things sometimes so a lot of
the things that we really rely on are

1182
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:31,799
the things that we really rely on are
 

1183
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:34,269
the things that we really rely on are
delicate equilibrium situ some of you

1184
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:34,279
delicate equilibrium situ some of you
 

1185
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:35,909
delicate equilibrium situ some of you
know and there is some robustness in the

1186
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:35,919
know and there is some robustness in the
 

1187
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,350
know and there is some robustness in the
systems we try to build in robustness

1188
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:38,360
systems we try to build in robustness
 

1189
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,230
systems we try to build in robustness
but a few extreme events can sometimes

1190
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:40,240
but a few extreme events can sometimes
 

1191
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,990
but a few extreme events can sometimes
alter things and um I think that's what

1192
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:44,000
alter things and um I think that's what
 

1193
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,310
alter things and um I think that's what
people are scared of today in many ways

1194
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:46,320
people are scared of today in many ways
 

1195
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,669
people are scared of today in many ways
they're scared of it for democracy

1196
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:47,679
they're scared of it for democracy
 

1197
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,350
they're scared of it for democracy
they're scared of it for peace they're

1198
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:49,360
they're scared of it for peace they're
 

1199
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,590
they're scared of it for peace they're
scared of it for AI I think they're not

1200
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:51,600
scared of it for AI I think they're not
 

1201
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,830
scared of it for AI I think they're not
as scared as they should be about

1202
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:52,840
as scared as they should be about
 

1203
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,510
as scared as they should be about
nuclear weapons to be honest um I think

1204
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:55,520
nuclear weapons to be honest um I think
 

1205
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,110
nuclear weapons to be honest um I think
that's a more serious danger Than People

1206
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,120
that's a more serious danger Than People
 

1207
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,950
that's a more serious danger Than People
realize um I think people are a little

1208
00:22:59,950 --> 00:22:59,960
realize um I think people are a little
 

1209
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,990
realize um I think people are a little
bit more scared about pandemics than

1210
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,000
bit more scared about pandemics than
 

1211
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,350
bit more scared about pandemics than
they were before um but I still say

1212
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:04,360
they were before um but I still say
 

1213
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,710
they were before um but I still say
they're not super scared about it so

1214
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:06,720
they're not super scared about it so
 

1215
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,750
they're not super scared about it so
you're right there are these major

1216
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:08,760
you're right there are these major
 

1217
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,590
you're right there are these major
events that can happen and we are

1218
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:11,600
events that can happen and we are
 

1219
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,350
events that can happen and we are
setting things up so that they might

1220
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:13,360
setting things up so that they might
 

1221
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,950
setting things up so that they might
happen and we should be thinking about

1222
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:15,960
happen and we should be thinking about
 

1223
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,149
happen and we should be thinking about
them the question is who should be

1224
00:23:17,149 --> 00:23:17,159
them the question is who should be
 

1225
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:18,750
them the question is who should be
thinking about them how should we be

1226
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:18,760
thinking about them how should we be
 

1227
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,230
thinking about them how should we be
thinking about them how do you make

1228
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:20,240
thinking about them how do you make
 

1229
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,909
thinking about them how do you make
things happen on a global scale because

1230
00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:21,919
things happen on a global scale because
 

1231
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,870
things happen on a global scale because
that's really what we need it certainly

1232
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:23,880
that's really what we need it certainly
 

1233
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,310
that's really what we need it certainly
shouldn't be a source of division it

1234
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:25,320
shouldn't be a source of division it
 

1235
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,950
shouldn't be a source of division it
should be a source of grand

1236
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:26,960
should be a source of grand
 

1237
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,590
should be a source of grand
collaboration probably wouldn't that be

1238
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:29,600
collaboration probably wouldn't that be
 

1239
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,909
collaboration probably wouldn't that be
nice yeah I just wonder what it would be

1240
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:31,919
nice yeah I just wonder what it would be
 

1241
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,750
nice yeah I just wonder what it would be
like a to be a dinosaur it must have

1242
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:34,760
like a to be a dinosaur it must have
 

1243
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,870
like a to be a dinosaur it must have
been beautiful to like look at the

1244
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:36,880
been beautiful to like look at the
 

1245
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,789
been beautiful to like look at the
asteroid just enter the atmosphere until

1246
00:23:39,789 --> 00:23:39,799
asteroid just enter the atmosphere until
 

1247
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:43,990
asteroid just enter the atmosphere until
like everything just man would I that

1248
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,000
like everything just man would I that
 

1249
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,630
like everything just man would I that
would be one of the things I would

1250
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:45,640
would be one of the things I would
 

1251
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,950
would be one of the things I would
travel back in time to you know that's

1252
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:48,960
travel back in time to you know that's
 

1253
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,950
travel back in time to you know that's
also one of the things that I think you

1254
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:50,960
also one of the things that I think you
 

1255
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,750
also one of the things that I think you
probably could do with virtual reality I

1256
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:52,760
probably could do with virtual reality I
 

1257
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,990
probably could do with virtual reality I
don't think you have to be there and get

1258
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,000
don't think you have to be there and get
 

1259
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,909
don't think you have to be there and get
extinct just experience it I think

1260
00:23:55,909 --> 00:23:55,919

award from the Museum of nuclear history

1280
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:18,080
award from the Museum of nuclear history
 

1281
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,510
award from the Museum of nuclear history
and technology in the southwest and I

1282
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:20,520
and technology in the southwest and I
 

1283
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,789
and technology in the southwest and I
went to visit the museum which turned

1284
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:22,799
went to visit the museum which turned
 

1285
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,070
went to visit the museum which turned
out to be mostly a museum of nuclear

1286
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:25,080
out to be mostly a museum of nuclear
 

1287
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,190
out to be mostly a museum of nuclear
weapons and the scary thing is that they

1288
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:28,200
weapons and the scary thing is that they
 

1289
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,789
weapons and the scary thing is that they
look really cool you know it's true that

we attracted to creating cool stuff even
 

1315
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,230
we attracted to creating cool stuff even
though it's can be dangerous and

1316
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:01,240
though it's can be dangerous and
 

1317

thinking about the the overall
 

1341
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,430
thinking about the the overall
consequences and it was kind of like in

1342
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:24,440
consequences and it was kind of like in
 

1343
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,470
consequences and it was kind of like in
some ways it was like the early Silicon

1344
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:26,480
some ways it was like the early Silicon
 

1345
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,389
some ways it was like the early Silicon
Valley you know people were just

1346
00:25:27,389 --> 00:25:27,399
Valley you know people were just
 

1347
00:25:27,399 --> 00:25:28,750
Valley you know people were just
thinking like what if we did this what

1348
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:28,760
thinking like what if we did this what
 

1349
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,830
thinking like what if we did this what
if we did that and you know not keeping

1350
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:31,840
if we did that and you know not keeping
 

1351
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,549
if we did that and you know not keeping
track of like what the peripheral

1352
00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:33,559
track of like what the peripheral
 

1353
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:36,389
track of like what the peripheral
consequences are and you definitely see

1354
00:25:36,389 --> 00:25:36,399
consequences are and you definitely see
 

1355
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:37,789
consequences are and you definitely see
that happening with AI now I mean I

1356
00:25:37,789 --> 00:25:37,799
that happening with AI now I mean I
 

1357
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:39,470
that happening with AI now I mean I
think that was the moral of the battle

1358

that just happened that you know it's
 

1361

1382
00:26:13,149 --> 00:26:13,159
think applies to nuclear weapons but it
 

1383
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:16,870

scary you don't know what is you don't
 

1415
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,070
scary you don't know what is you don't
know if there's going to be a solution

1416
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:49,080
know if there's going to be a solution
 

1417
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,070
know if there's going to be a solution
you don't know if you're going to find

1418
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:50,080
you don't know if you're going to find
 

1419
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,710
you don't know if you're going to find
it so it's not something that can

1420
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:51,720
it so it's not something that can
 

1421
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,870
it so it's not something that can
destroy the Earth it's just something

1422
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:52,880
destroy the Earth it's just something
 

1423
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,630
destroy the Earth it's just something
that you do on your individual level but

1424
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:55,640
that you do on your individual level but
 

1425
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,190
that you do on your individual level but
then of course there are much bigger

1426
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:57,200
then of course there are much bigger
 

1427
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,510
then of course there are much bigger
things like like the ones you're talking

1428
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:58,520
things like like the ones you're talking
 

1429
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,190
things like like the ones you're talking
about where they could actually be

1430
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:00,200
about where they could actually be
 

1431
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,950
about where they could actually be
dangerous the stuff I do I just want to

1432
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:01,960
dangerous the stuff I do I just want to
 

1433
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,110
dangerous the stuff I do I just want to
be clear I'm doing theoretical physics

1434
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:04,120
be clear I'm doing theoretical physics
 

1435
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,190
be clear I'm doing theoretical physics
not very dangerous um but sometimes

1436
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:07,200
not very dangerous um but sometimes
 

1437
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,110
not very dangerous um but sometimes
things end up having bigger consequences

1438
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:09,120
things end up having bigger consequences
 

1439
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,269
things end up having bigger consequences
than you think yeah

1440
00:27:12,269 --> 00:27:12,279
than you think yeah
 

1441
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:15,470
than you think yeah
but dangerous in a very pragmatic sense

1442
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:15,480
but dangerous in a very pragmatic sense
 

1443
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,669
but dangerous in a very pragmatic sense
but isn't it still in part terrifying

1444
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:17,679
but isn't it still in part terrifying
 

1445
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,350
but isn't it still in part terrifying
when you think of a just the size of

1446
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:21,360
when you think of a just the size of
 

1447
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,070
when you think of a just the size of
things like the size of dark matter like

1448
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:24,080
things like the size of dark matter like
 

1449
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,830
things like the size of dark matter like
the the the power of this thing in terms

1450
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:26,840
the the the power of this thing in terms
 

1451
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,149
the the the power of this thing in terms
of

1452
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:28,159
of
 

1453
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,269
of
uh is is potential gravitational effects

1454
00:27:30,269 --> 00:27:30,279
uh is is potential gravitational effects
 

1455
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:33,269
uh is is potential gravitational effects
just this Co cosmological objects of a

1456
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:33,279
just this Co cosmological objects of a
 

1457
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,350
just this Co cosmological objects of a
black hole at the center of our galaxy

1458
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:36,360
black hole at the center of our galaxy
 

1459
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,630
black hole at the center of our galaxy
so this might be where why I'm a

1460
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:37,640
so this might be where why I'm a
 

1461
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,950
so this might be where why I'm a
physicist or why I differ from other

1462
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:38,960
physicist or why I differ from other
 

1463
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,070
physicist or why I differ from other
people because I'm not such a big fan of

1464
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:43,080
people because I'm not such a big fan of
 

1465
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,590
people because I'm not such a big fan of
humanity in some ways some ways I am but

1466
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:45,600
humanity in some ways some ways I am but
 

1467
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,950
humanity in some ways some ways I am but
the idea that we were everything would

1468
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:46,960
the idea that we were everything would
 

1469
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,230
the idea that we were everything would
be really boring to me I love the idea

1470
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:49,240
be really boring to me I love the idea
 

1471
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,750
be really boring to me I love the idea
that there's so much more out there that

1472
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:50,760
that there's so much more out there that
 

1473
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,310
that there's so much more out there that
there's a bigger universe and there's

1474
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:52,320
there's a bigger universe and there's
 

1475
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,190
there's a bigger universe and there's
lots to discover and that we're not all

1476
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:54,200
lots to discover and that we're not all
 

1477
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,230
lots to discover and that we're not all
there is wouldn't it be disappointing if

1478
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:56,240
there is wouldn't it be disappointing if
 

1479
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,669
there is wouldn't it be disappointing if
we were all there is yeah and the the

1480
00:27:59,669 --> 00:27:59,679
we were all there is yeah and the the
 

1481
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,789
we were all there is yeah and the the
full diversity of other stuff it's

1482
00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:02,799
full diversity of other stuff it's
 

1483
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,470
full diversity of other stuff it's
pretty interesting you know we have no

1484
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:04,480
pretty interesting you know we have no
 

1485
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,029
pretty interesting you know we have no
idea how much there is you know we we

1486
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:06,039
idea how much there is you know we we
 

1487
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:08,350
idea how much there is you know we we
know what we what we can observe so far

1488
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:08,360
know what we what we can observe so far
 

1489
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,230
know what we what we can observe so far
so the idea that there's other stuff out

1490
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:10,240
so the idea that there's other stuff out
 

1491
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,350
so the idea that there's other stuff out
there that we yet have to figure out

1492
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:12,360
there that we yet have to figure out
 

1493
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,830
there that we yet have to figure out
it's exciting well let me ask you out

1494
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:14,840
it's exciting well let me ask you out
 

1495
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,750
it's exciting well let me ask you out
there

1496
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:15,760
there
 

1497
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,990
there
question okay so if you think of like

1498
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:20,000
question okay so if you think of like
 

1499
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,389
question okay so if you think of like
humans on Earth life on Earth as this

1500
00:28:23,389 --> 00:28:23,399
humans on Earth life on Earth as this
 

1501
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:25,990
humans on Earth life on Earth as this
pocket of complexity that

1502
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:26,000
pocket of complexity that
 

1503
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,549
pocket of complexity that
emerged you know and there's a bunch of

1504
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:28,559
emerged you know and there's a bunch of
 

1505
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,549
emerged you know and there's a bunch of
conditions that came to be and there's

1506
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:30,559
conditions that came to be and there's
 

1507
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:35,029
conditions that came to be and there's
uh darwinian Evolution and however life

1508
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:35,039
uh darwinian Evolution and however life
 

1509
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,990
uh darwinian Evolution and however life
originated do you think it's possible

1510
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:37,000
originated do you think it's possible
 

1511
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,149
originated do you think it's possible
there's some pockets of complexity of

1512
00:28:39,149 --> 00:28:39,159
there's some pockets of complexity of
 

1513
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:42,310
there's some pockets of complexity of
that sort inside dark matter we can't

1514
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:42,320
that sort inside dark matter we can't
 

1515
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,509
that sort inside dark matter we can't
see well so that's

1516
00:28:44,509 --> 00:28:44,519
see well so that's
 

1517
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:48,149
see well so that's
possible um I chemistry and biology

1518
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:48,159
possible um I chemistry and biology
 

1519
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,750
possible um I chemistry and biology
evolving in different ways and that's

1520
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:49,760
evolving in different ways and that's
 

1521
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,590
evolving in different ways and that's
one of the reasons we suggest I mean

1522
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:51,600
one of the reasons we suggest I mean
 

1523
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,669
one of the reasons we suggest I mean
it's not the reason but it would be true

1524
00:28:53,669 --> 00:28:53,679
it's not the reason but it would be true
 

1525
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,630
it's not the reason but it would be true
if there were the type of interactions

1526
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:55,640
if there were the type of interactions
 

1527
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,710
if there were the type of interactions
we suggest I mean it would need more

1528
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:57,720
we suggest I mean it would need more
 

1529
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,750
we suggest I mean it would need more
complex ones and we don't know um I will

1530
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:01,760
complex ones and we don't know um I will
 

1531
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,029
complex ones and we don't know um I will
say that the conditions that give rise

1532
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:04,039
say that the conditions that give rise
 

1533
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:07,230
say that the conditions that give rise
to life and complexity they're complex

1534
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:07,240
to life and complexity they're complex
 

1535
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,669
to life and complexity they're complex
they're unlikely um so it's not like

1536
00:29:10,669 --> 00:29:10,679
they're unlikely um so it's not like
 

1537
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:13,350
they're unlikely um so it's not like
there's great odds that would happen but

1538
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:13,360
there's great odds that would happen but
 

1539
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,509
there's great odds that would happen but
there's no reason to know that it

1540
00:29:14,509 --> 00:29:14,519
there's no reason to know that it
 

1541
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,710
there's no reason to know that it
doesn't happen it's worth investigating

1542
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:16,720
doesn't happen it's worth investigating
 

1543
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,470
doesn't happen it's worth investigating
are there other forces that exist in the

1544
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:18,480
are there other forces that exist in the
 

1545
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,830
are there other forces that exist in the
dark matter sector that's exactly so the

1546
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:20,840
dark matter sector that's exactly so the
 

1547
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,590
dark matter sector that's exactly so the
Dark Matter sector doesn't have all the

1548
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:23,600
Dark Matter sector doesn't have all the
 

1549
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,230
Dark Matter sector doesn't have all the
forces of the the standard model of

1550
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:25,240
forces of the the standard model of
 

1551
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,950
forces of the the standard model of
physics right as far as we know it

1552
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:26,960
physics right as far as we know it
 

1553
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,909
physics right as far as we know it
doesn't have

1554
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:27,919
doesn't have
 

1555
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,990
doesn't have
it might have it at some low level but

1556
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:30,000
it might have it at some low level but
 

1557
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,230
it might have it at some low level but
it could have its own forces just like

1558
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:32,240
it could have its own forces just like
 

1559
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,029
it could have its own forces just like
the dark matter might not experience our

1560
00:29:34,029 --> 00:29:34,039
the dark matter might not experience our
 

1561
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:36,870
the dark matter might not experience our
light maybe it has its light that we

1562
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:36,880
light maybe it has its light that we
 

1563
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,149
light maybe it has its light that we
don't experience so there could be other

1564
00:29:39,149 --> 00:29:39,159
don't experience so there could be other
 

1565
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:41,269
don't experience so there could be other
kinds of forces I mean there could be

1566
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:41,279
kinds of forces I mean there could be
 

1567
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,470
kinds of forces I mean there could be
other kinds of forces even within our

1568
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:43,480
other kinds of forces even within our
 

1569
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,630
other kinds of forces even within our
sector that are too weak for us to have

1570
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:45,640
sector that are too weak for us to have
 

1571
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,549
sector that are too weak for us to have
discovered so far or that exist at

1572
00:29:47,549 --> 00:29:47,559
discovered so far or that exist at
 

1573
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:49,710
discovered so far or that exist at
different scales than we know about I

1574
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:49,720
different scales than we know about I
 

1575
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,710
different scales than we know about I
mean we detect what interacts strongly

1576
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:52,720
mean we detect what interacts strongly
 

1577
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,990
mean we detect what interacts strongly
enough with our detectors to detect so

1578
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:56,000
enough with our detectors to detect so
 

1579
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,710
enough with our detectors to detect so
it's worth asking and and that's one of

1580
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:57,720
it's worth asking and and that's one of
 

1581
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,750
it's worth asking and and that's one of
the reasons we build big colliders to

1582
00:29:59,750 --> 00:29:59,760
the reasons we build big colliders to
 

1583
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,149
the reasons we build big colliders to
see are there other forces other

1584
00:30:03,149 --> 00:30:03,159
see are there other forces other
 

1585
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:05,830
see are there other forces other
particles that exist say at higher

1586
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:05,840
particles that exist say at higher
 

1587
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,549
particles that exist say at higher
energies at shorter distance scales than

1588
00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:07,559
energies at shorter distance scales than
 

1589
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:10,669
energies at shorter distance scales than
we've explored so far so it's not just

1590
00:30:10,669 --> 00:30:10,679
we've explored so far so it's not just
 

1591
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:12,470
we've explored so far so it's not just
in the dark matter sector Even in our

1592
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:12,480
in the dark matter sector Even in our
 

1593
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,430
in the dark matter sector Even in our
sector there could be a whole bunch of

1594
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:14,440
sector there could be a whole bunch of
 

1595
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,750
sector there could be a whole bunch of
stuff we don't yet

1596
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:15,760
stuff we don't yet
 

1597
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,070
stuff we don't yet
know so maybe let's zoom out look at the

1598
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:19,080
know so maybe let's zoom out look at the
 

1599
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,630
know so maybe let's zoom out look at the
standard model of pH of particle physics

1600
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:21,640
standard model of pH of particle physics
 

1601
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,350
standard model of pH of particle physics
how does Dark Matter fit into first of

1602
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:23,360
how does Dark Matter fit into first of
 

1603
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,830
how does Dark Matter fit into first of
all what is it can you explain what the

1604
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:25,840
all what is it can you explain what the
 

1605
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,070
all what is it can you explain what the
standard model is so the standard model

1606
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:29,080
standard model is so the standard model
 

1607
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,669
standard model is so the standard model
of particle physics is basically tells

1608
00:30:32,669 --> 00:30:32,679
of particle physics is basically tells
 

1609
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:35,630
of particle physics is basically tells
us about Nature's most basic elements

1610
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:35,640
us about Nature's most basic elements
 

1611
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,590
us about Nature's most basic elements
and their interactions and so it's the

1612
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:38,600
and their interactions and so it's the
 

1613
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,029
and their interactions and so it's the
substructure as far as we understand it

1614
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:41,039
substructure as far as we understand it
 

1615
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,509
substructure as far as we understand it
so if you look at atoms we know they

1616
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:42,519
so if you look at atoms we know they
 

1617
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:45,470
so if you look at atoms we know they
have nuclei and electrons nuclei have

1618
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:45,480
have nuclei and electrons nuclei have
 

1619
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,310
have nuclei and electrons nuclei have
protons and neutrons in them protons and

1620
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:48,320
protons and neutrons in them protons and
 

1621
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,950
protons and neutrons in them protons and
neutrons have particles called quirks

1622
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:50,960
neutrons have particles called quirks
 

1623
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,230
neutrons have particles called quirks
that are held together by something

1624
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:52,240
that are held together by something
 

1625
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,909
that are held together by something
called the strong force they interact

1626
00:30:55,909 --> 00:30:55,919
called the strong force they interact
 

1627
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,990
called the strong force they interact
through the strong force Force the

1628
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:58,000
through the strong force Force the
 

1629
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,590
through the strong force Force the
strong nuclear force there something

1630
00:30:59,590 --> 00:30:59,600
strong nuclear force there something
 

1631
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,750
strong nuclear force there something
called the weak nuclear force and

1632
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:01,760
called the weak nuclear force and
 

1633
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,110
called the weak nuclear force and
electromagnetism so basically all those

1634
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:04,120
electromagnetism so basically all those
 

1635
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,470
electromagnetism so basically all those
particles and their interactions

1636
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:06,480
particles and their interactions
 

1637
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,870
particles and their interactions
describe many many things we understand

1638
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:08,880
describe many many things we understand
 

1639
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,230
describe many many things we understand
that's the standard model we now know

1640
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:11,240
that's the standard model we now know
 

1641
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:15,110
that's the standard model we now know
about the higs boson which is associated

1642
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:15,120
about the higs boson which is associated
 

1643
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,950
about the higs boson which is associated
with how Elementary particles get their

00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:16,960
with how Elementary particles get their

1649
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,149
been
completed we also know that there are

1650
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:22,159
completed we also know that there are
 

1651
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,029
completed we also know that there are
kind of a weird array of masses of

1652
00:31:24,029 --> 00:31:24,039
kind of a weird array of masses of
 

1653
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:26,389
kind of a weird array of masses of
Elementary particles there's not just

1654
00:31:26,389 --> 00:31:26,399
Elementary particles there's not just
 

1655
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,310
Elementary particles there's not just
the up and down but there are heavier

1656
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:28,320
the up and down but there are heavier
 

1657
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,549
the up and down but there are heavier
versions of the up and down cork charm

1658
00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:30,559
versions of the up and down cork charm
 

1659
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,789
versions of the up and down cork charm
and strange top and bottom there's not

1660
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:32,799
and strange top and bottom there's not
 

1661
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,389
and strange top and bottom there's not
just the electron there's a muon and a

1662
00:31:34,389 --> 00:31:34,399
just the electron there's a muon and a
 

1663
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,950
just the electron there's a muon and a
tow there are particles called neutrinos

1664
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:36,960
tow there are particles called neutrinos
 

1665
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,110
tow there are particles called neutrinos
which are under intense study now which

1666
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:39,120
which are under intense study now which
 

1667
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,830
which are under intense study now which
are partnered with the leptons through

1668
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:40,840
are partnered with the leptons through
 

1669
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,190
are partnered with the leptons through
the weak interactions so we really do

1670
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:43,200
the weak interactions so we really do
 

1671
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,669
the weak interactions so we really do
know these basic

1672
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:44,679
know these basic
 

1673
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:47,590
know these basic
elements and we know the forces we know

1674
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:47,600
elements and we know the forces we know
 

1675
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,549
elements and we know the forces we know
I mean when we're doing particle physics

1676
00:31:49,549 --> 00:31:49,559
I mean when we're doing particle physics
 

1677
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,269
I mean when we're doing particle physics
experiments we can usually even ignore

1678
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:51,279
experiments we can usually even ignore
 

1679
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,990
experiments we can usually even ignore
gravity except in exceptional cases that

1680
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:54,000
gravity except in exceptional cases that
 

1681
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,710
gravity except in exceptional cases that
we can talk about so those are the basic

1682
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:56,720
we can talk about so those are the basic
 

1683
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,029
we can talk about so those are the basic
elements and their interactions Dark

00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:01,320
Matter stands outside that it's not
 

1687
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,950
Matter stands outside that it's not
interacting through those forces so when

1688
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:03,960
interacting through those forces so when
 

1689
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,149
interacting through those forces so when
we look at the world around us we don't

1690
00:32:06,149 --> 00:32:06,159
we look at the world around us we don't
 

1691
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,789
we look at the world around us we don't
usually see the effects of dark matter

1692
00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:07,799
usually see the effects of dark matter
 

1693
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,789
usually see the effects of dark matter
it's because there's so much of it that

1694
00:32:09,789 --> 00:32:09,799
it's because there's so much of it that
 

1695
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:12,149
it's because there's so much of it that
we do and it doesn't have those forces

1696
00:32:12,149 --> 00:32:12,159
we do and it doesn't have those forces
 

1697
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,830
we do and it doesn't have those forces
that we know about but the standard

1698
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:14,840
that we know about but the standard
 

1699
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,590
that we know about but the standard
model has worked spectacularly well it's

1700
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:16,600
model has worked spectacularly well it's
 

1701
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,470

been tested to a high degree of

00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:21,080
precision people are still testing it
 

1705
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,190
precision people are still testing it
and one of the things we do as

1706
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:22,200
and one of the things we do as
 

1707
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,029
and one of the things we do as
physicists is we actually want it to

1708
00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:25,039
physicists is we actually want it to
 

1709
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,549
physicists is we actually want it to
break down at some level we're looking

1710
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:26,559
break down at some level we're looking

working like not that it's not working
 

1721
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,750
working like not that it's not working
approximately but we're looking for the

00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,509
deviations and those deviations are
critical because they can tell us what

1726
00:32:42,509 --> 00:32:42,519
critical because they can tell us what
 

1727
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:44,310
critical because they can tell us what
underlies the standard model which is

1728
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:44,320
underlies the standard model which is
 

1729
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,070
underlies the standard model which is
what we really want to see next where

1730
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:46,080
what we really want to see next where
 

1731
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,590
what we really want to see next where
can you find the the places where the

1732
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:47,600
can you find the the places where the
 

1733
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,870
can you find the the places where the
standard model breaks down like uh what

1734
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:49,880
standard model breaks down like uh what
 

1735
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,230
standard model breaks down like uh what
are the what are the places you can see

1736
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:51,240
are the what are the places you can see
 

1737
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,830
are the what are the places you can see
those tiny little deviations so we don't

1738
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:53,840
those tiny little deviations so we don't
 

1739
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,870
those tiny little deviations so we don't
know yet but we know the kinds of things

1740
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:55,880
know yet but we know the kinds of things
 

1741
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,190
know yet but we know the kinds of things
you wouldn't want to look for so one

1742
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:58,200
you wouldn't want to look for so one
 

1743
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,750
you wouldn't want to look for so one
obvious place to look is at higher

1744
00:32:59,750 --> 00:32:59,760
obvious place to look is at higher
 

1745
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,830
obvious place to look is at higher
energy um we're looking at the large

1746
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:01,840
energy um we're looking at the large
 

1747
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,629
energy um we're looking at the large
hron collider but we'd love to go beyond

1748
00:33:03,629 --> 00:33:03,639
hron collider but we'd love to go beyond
 

1749
00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:06,029
hron collider but we'd love to go beyond
that higher energies means shorter

1750
00:33:06,029 --> 00:33:06,039
that higher energies means shorter
 

1751
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:08,110
that higher energies means shorter
distances and it means things that we

1752
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:08,120
distances and it means things that we
 

1753
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,350
distances and it means things that we
just couldn't produce before I mean eals

1754
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:10,360
just couldn't produce before I mean eals
 

1755
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,590
just couldn't produce before I mean eals
mc^2 so if you have a heavy particle and

1756
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:12,600
mc^2 so if you have a heavy particle and
 

1757
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,029
mc^2 so if you have a heavy particle and
you don't have enough energy to make it

1758
00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:14,039
you don't have enough energy to make it
 

1759
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:16,909
you don't have enough energy to make it
you'll never see it so that's one place

1760
00:33:16,909 --> 00:33:16,919
you'll never see it so that's one place
 

1761
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:18,269
you'll never see it so that's one place
the other place is precision

1762
00:33:18,269 --> 00:33:18,279
the other place is precision
 

1763
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:19,830
the other place is precision
measurements if you you know the

1764
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:19,840
measurements if you you know the
 

1765
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,629
measurements if you you know the
standard model has been tested

1766
00:33:21,629 --> 00:33:21,639
standard model has been tested
 

1767
00:33:21,639 --> 00:33:23,950
standard model has been tested
exquisitly so if been if it's been

1768
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:23,960
exquisitly so if been if it's been
 

1769
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,990
exquisitly so if been if it's been
tested 1% you want to look at a tenth of

1770
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:26,000
tested 1% you want to look at a tenth of
 

1771
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,710
tested 1% you want to look at a tenth of
a percent MH and there are some

1772
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:27,720
a percent MH and there are some
 

1773
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,190
a percent MH and there are some
processes that we know shouldn't even

1774
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:29,200
processes that we know shouldn't even
 

1775
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,590
processes that we know shouldn't even
happen at all in the standard model or

1776
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:30,600
happen at all in the standard model or
 

1777
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,710
happen at all in the standard model or
happen at very suppressed level and

1778
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:32,720
happen at very suppressed level and
 

1779
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,990
happen at very suppressed level and
those are other things that we look for

1780
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:35,000
those are other things that we look for
 

1781
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,750
those are other things that we look for
so all of those things could indicate

1782
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:37,760
so all of those things could indicate
 

1783
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,190
so all of those things could indicate
there's something beyond what we know

1784
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:39,200
there's something beyond what we know
 

1785
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,590
there's something beyond what we know
about which of course would be very

1786
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:41,600
about which of course would be very
 

1787
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,149
about which of course would be very
exciting when you just step back and

1788
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:44,159
exciting when you just step back and
 

1789
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,230
exciting when you just step back and
look at the standard model the quirks

1790
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:46,240
look at the standard model the quirks
 

1791
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,230
look at the standard model the quirks
and all the different particles and

1792
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:48,240
and all the different particles and
 

1793
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,750
and all the different particles and
trinos

1794
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:49,760
trinos
 

1795
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,990
trinos
and isn't it wild how this like little

1796
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:54,000
and isn't it wild how this like little
 

1797
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,389
and isn't it wild how this like little
system came came to being creates is

1798
00:33:56,389 --> 00:33:56,399
system came came to being creates is
 

1799
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,149
system came came to being creates is
underpin depends everything we see

1800
00:33:59,149 --> 00:33:59,159
underpin depends everything we see
 

1801
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:00,870
underpin depends everything we see
absolutely and that's why we'd like to

1802
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:00,880
absolutely and that's why we'd like to
 

1803
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,029
absolutely and that's why we'd like to
understand it better we want to know is

1804
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:03,039
understand it better we want to know is
 

1805
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,590
understand it better we want to know is
it part of some bigger sector um why are

1806
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:05,600
it part of some bigger sector um why are
 

1807
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,710
it part of some bigger sector um why are
these particles why do they have the

1808
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:06,720
these particles why do they have the
 

1809
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,389
these particles why do they have the
masses they do yeah um why is the hibos

1810
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:09,399
masses they do yeah um why is the hibos
 

1811
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:10,829
masses they do yeah um why is the hibos
on so light compared to the mass it

1812
00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:10,839
on so light compared to the mass it
 

1813
00:34:10,839 --> 00:34:12,430
on so light compared to the mass it
could have had which we might have even

1814
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:12,440
could have had which we might have even
 

1815
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,669
could have had which we might have even
expected based on the principles of

1816
00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:15,679
expected based on the principles of
 

1817
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,790
expected based on the principles of
special relativity in quantum mechanics

1818
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:17,800
special relativity in quantum mechanics
 

1819
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,149
special relativity in quantum mechanics
so that's a really big question why are

1820
00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:20,159
so that's a really big question why are
 

1821
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,470
so that's a really big question why are
they what they are and and they

1822
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:21,480
they what they are and and they
 

1823
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,389
they what they are and and they
originate there's like some mechanism

1824
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:23,399
originate there's like some mechanism
 

1825
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:25,149
originate there's like some mechanism
that created the whole thing that's one

1826
00:34:25,149 --> 00:34:25,159
that created the whole thing that's one
 

1827
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:27,030
that created the whole thing that's one
of the things we're trying to study why

1828
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:27,040
of the things we're trying to study why
 

1829
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,149
of the things we're trying to study why
why is it what it is I mean even just

1830
00:34:29,149 --> 00:34:29,159
why is it what it is I mean even just
 

1831
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:32,349
why is it what it is I mean even just
like the mechanism that creates stuff

1832
00:34:32,349 --> 00:34:32,359
like the mechanism that creates stuff
 

1833
00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:35,950
like the mechanism that creates stuff
like the way a human being is Created

1834
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:35,960
like the way a human being is Created
 

1835
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,310
like the way a human being is Created
from a single cell it's like embryo

1836
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:39,320
from a single cell it's like embryo
 

1837
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,149
from a single cell it's like embryo
Genesis like the whole thing like bu you

1838
00:34:41,149 --> 00:34:41,159
Genesis like the whole thing like bu you
 

1839
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,270
Genesis like the whole thing like bu you
build up this

1840
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:42,280
build up this
 

1841
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,430
build up this
thing all of it this whole thing comes

1842
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:45,440
thing all of it this whole thing comes
 

1843
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,829
thing all of it this whole thing comes
to be from just like a don't forget it

1844
00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:47,839
to be from just like a don't forget it
 

1845
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:50,710
to be from just like a don't forget it
is interacting with the environment sure

1846
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:50,720
is interacting with the environment sure
 

1847
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,629
is interacting with the environment sure
okay right right right it's not it's

1848
00:34:52,629 --> 00:34:52,639
okay right right right it's not it's
 

1849
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,990
okay right right right it's not it's
right it's important well that's a

1850
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:54,000
right it's important well that's a
 

1851
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,389
right it's important well that's a
really good question is how much of it

1852
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:55,399
really good question is how much of it
 

1853
00:34:55,399 --> 00:34:58,270
really good question is how much of it
is the environment is it just just the

1854
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:58,280
is the environment is it just just the
 

1855
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,349
is the environment is it just just the
environment acting on a set of

1856
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:00,359
environment acting on a set of
 

1857
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:01,670
environment acting on a set of
constraints

1858
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:01,680
constraints
 

1859
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,670
constraints
and uh like how much of it is just the

1860
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:04,680
and uh like how much of it is just the
 

1861
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,150
and uh like how much of it is just the
information in the DNA or the

1862
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:06,160
information in the DNA or the
 

1863
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,190
information in the DNA or the
information how much is it in the

1864
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:08,200
information how much is it in the
 

1865
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,990
information how much is it in the
initial conditions of the universe or uh

1866
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:11,000
initial conditions of the universe or uh
 

1867
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,750
initial conditions of the universe or uh
versus the the some other thing acting

1868
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:13,760
versus the the some other thing acting
 

1869
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,150
versus the the some other thing acting
on it these are Big questions these are

1870
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:16,160
on it these are Big questions these are
 

1871
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,670
on it these are Big questions these are
Big questions in pretty much every field

1872
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:18,680
Big questions in pretty much every field
 

1873
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,829
Big questions in pretty much every field
um you know we for the universe we do

1874
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:21,839
um you know we for the universe we do
 

1875
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,310
um you know we for the universe we do
consider it you know it's everything

1876
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:23,320
consider it you know it's everything
 

1877
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,230
consider it you know it's everything
there is by definition but people now

1878
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:26,240
there is by definition but people now
 

1879
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,950
there is by definition but people now
think about it is it one of many

1880
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:27,960
think about it is it one of many
 

1881
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,710
think about it is it one of many
universes um and of course it's a

1882
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:30,720
universes um and of course it's a
 

1883
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,990
universes um and of course it's a
misnomer but could there be other places

1884
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:33,000
misnomer but could there be other places
 

1885
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,190
misnomer but could there be other places
where there are self-contained

1886
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:34,200
where there are self-contained
 

1887
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,430
where there are self-contained
gravitational systems that we don't even

1888
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:36,440
gravitational systems that we don't even
 

1889
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,990
gravitational systems that we don't even
interact with so but those are really

1890
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:39,000
interact with so but those are really
 

1891
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,550
interact with so but those are really
important questions and the only way

1892
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:40,560
important questions and the only way
 

1893
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,790
important questions and the only way
we're going to answer them is you know

1894
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:41,800
we're going to answer them is you know
 

1895
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,910
we're going to answer them is you know
we go back as far as we can we try to

1896
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:43,920
we go back as far as we can we try to
 

1897
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,829
we go back as far as we can we try to
think theoretically and we try to think

1898
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:45,839
think theoretically and we try to think
 

1899
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,069
think theoretically and we try to think
about observational consequences it's

1900
00:35:48,069 --> 00:35:48,079
about observational consequences it's
 

1901
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,069
about observational consequences it's
all we can do one interesting way to

1902
00:35:50,069 --> 00:35:50,079
all we can do one interesting way to
 

1903
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,109
all we can do one interesting way to
explore the standard models to look at

1904
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:52,119
explore the standard models to look at
 

1905
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:56,829
explore the standard models to look at

they exist when they interact they
 

1915
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,190
they exist when they interact they

with something else and you wrote that
 

1919
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,630
with something else and you wrote that
well I'll just read the whole thing cuz

it's it's kind of interesting stocks may

00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:13,800
it's it's kind of interesting stocks may
 

1923

it's it's kind of interesting stocks may
not achieve a precise value until they

not achieve a precise value until they
 

1925
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,069
not achieve a precise value until they
are traded but that doesn't mean we

1926
00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:18,079
are traded but that doesn't mean we
 

1927
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,790
are traded but that doesn't mean we
can't approximate their worth until they

can't approximate their worth until they

can't approximate their worth until they
change hands similarly electrons might

1930
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:23,240
change hands similarly electrons might
 

1931
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,710
change hands similarly electrons might
not have definite properties but they do

1932
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:25,720
not have definite properties but they do
 

1933
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,670
not have definite properties but they do
exist it's true that the electron

1934
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:28,680
exist it's true that the electron
 

1935
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,349
exist it's true that the electron
doesn't exist as a classical object with

measured but something was there which

1940
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:36,200
measured but something was there which
 

1941
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,390
measured but something was there which
physicists use a wave function to

1942
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:38,400
physicists use a wave function to
 

1943
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,990
physicists use a wave function to
describe it's a fascinating Nuance

1944
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:41,000
describe it's a fascinating Nuance
 

1945
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,190
describe it's a fascinating Nuance
disagreement so do electrons always

1946
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:43,200
disagreement so do electrons always
 

1947
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,870
disagreement so do electrons always
exist or not does it does a tree fall in

1948
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:45,880
exist or not does it does a tree fall in
 

1949
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,190
exist or not does it does a tree fall in
the forest if nobody's there to see it

1950
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:48,200
the forest if nobody's there to see it
 

1951
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,150
the forest if nobody's there to see it
so I like to think of the universe is

1952
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:50,160
so I like to think of the universe is
 

1953
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,910
so I like to think of the universe is
being out there whether or not I mean it

1954
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:51,920
being out there whether or not I mean it
 

1955
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,630
being out there whether or not I mean it
would be really weird if the only time

1956
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:53,640
would be really weird if the only time
 

1957
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,349
would be really weird if the only time
things came into existence was when I

1958
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:55,359
things came into existence was when I
 

1959
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,230
things came into existence was when I
saw them or I measured them there's a

1960
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:57,240
saw them or I measured them there's a
 

1961
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,829
saw them or I measured them there's a
lot of weird I mean I could believe that

1962
00:36:58,829 --> 00:36:58,839
lot of weird I mean I could believe that
 

1963
00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:00,430
lot of weird I mean I could believe that
the Middle East doesn't exist because

1964
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:00,440
the Middle East doesn't exist because
 

1965
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,470
the Middle East doesn't exist because
I'm not there now I mean that would be

1966
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:02,480
I'm not there now I mean that would be
 

1967
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,309
I'm not there now I mean that would be
kind of ridiculous I think we would all

1968
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:04,319
kind of ridiculous I think we would all
 

1969
00:37:04,319 --> 00:37:07,309
kind of ridiculous I think we would all
agree on that so I think there's only so

1970
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:07,319
agree on that so I think there's only so
 

1971
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:09,270
agree on that so I think there's only so
much that we can attribute to our own

1972
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:09,280
much that we can attribute to our own
 

1973
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,109
much that we can attribute to our own
powers of seeing so and the whole system

1974
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:13,119
powers of seeing so and the whole system
 

1975
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,430
powers of seeing so and the whole system
doesn't come into being because I'm

1976
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:14,440
doesn't come into being because I'm
 

1977
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,550
doesn't come into being because I'm
measuring it and so what is weird and

1978
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:17,560
measuring it and so what is weird and
 

1979
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,069
measuring it and so what is weird and
this isn't even a disagreement about the

1980
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:19,079
this isn't even a disagreement about the
 

1981
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:20,349
this isn't even a disagreement about the
standard model this is agreement about

1982
00:37:20,349 --> 00:37:20,359
standard model this is agreement about
 

1983
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:22,390
standard model this is agreement about
how you interpret quantum mechanics I

1984
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:22,400
how you interpret quantum mechanics I
 

1985
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,030
how you interpret quantum mechanics I
mean I would say that those wave

1986
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:24,040
mean I would say that those wave
 

1987
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,670
mean I would say that those wave
functions are real I mean one of the

1988
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:25,680
functions are real I mean one of the
 

1989
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,230
functions are real I mean one of the
things that forget that particle physics

1990
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:28,240
things that forget that particle physics
 

1991
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,150
things that forget that particle physics
does that Quantum field Theory says is

1992
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:30,160
does that Quantum field Theory says is
 

1993
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,750
does that Quantum field Theory says is
that electrons can be created and

1994
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:31,760
that electrons can be created and
 

1995
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,510
that electrons can be created and
destroyed it's it's not that every

1996
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:33,520
destroyed it's it's not that every
 

1997
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,790
destroyed it's it's not that every
electron has to be in the universe I

1998
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:34,800
electron has to be in the universe I
 

1999
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,190
electron has to be in the universe I
mean there can be I mean that's what

2000
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:36,200
mean there can be I mean that's what
 

2001
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,790
mean there can be I mean that's what
happens at collider is particles get

2002
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:37,800
happens at collider is particles get
 

2003
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,829
happens at collider is particles get
created and destroyed um but that

2004
00:37:40,829 --> 00:37:40,839
created and destroyed um but that
 

2005
00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:42,829
created and destroyed um but that
doesn't mean that if I electron in an

2006
00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:42,839
doesn't mean that if I electron in an
 

2007
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:44,430
doesn't mean that if I electron in an
atom it's not there it's certainly there

2008
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:44,440
atom it's not there it's certainly there
 

2009
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,150
atom it's not there it's certainly there
and we know about it its charge is there

2010
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:47,160
and we know about it its charge is there
 

2011
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,309
and we know about it its charge is there
so physics is a kind of way to see the

2012
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:50,319
so physics is a kind of way to see the
 

2013
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:54,069
so physics is a kind of way to see the
world so what at the bottom what's the

2014
00:37:54,069 --> 00:37:54,079
world so what at the bottom what's the
 

2015
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,230
world so what at the bottom what's the
bottom Turtle like what do you have a

2016
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:56,240
bottom Turtle like what do you have a
 

2017
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,950
bottom Turtle like what do you have a
sense that there's a bottom reality that

2018
00:37:58,950 --> 00:37:58,960
sense that there's a bottom reality that
 

2019
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,150
sense that there's a bottom reality that
we're trying to approximate with physics

2020
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:01,160
we're trying to approximate with physics
 

2021
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,990
we're trying to approximate with physics
I think we always have in our head maybe

2022
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:03,000
I think we always have in our head maybe
 

2023
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,829
I think we always have in our head maybe
that we'd like to find that but I have

2024
00:38:05,829 --> 00:38:05,839
that we'd like to find that but I have
 

2025
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,910
that we'd like to find that but I have
to I mean I might not seem so but I

2026
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:07,920
to I mean I might not seem so but I
 

2027
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,109
to I mean I might not seem so but I
think I'm kind of more humble than a lot

2028
00:38:09,109 --> 00:38:09,119
think I'm kind of more humble than a lot
 

2029
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,230
think I'm kind of more humble than a lot
of physicists I'm not sure that we're

2030
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:10,240
of physicists I'm not sure that we're
 

2031
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,790
of physicists I'm not sure that we're
ever going to get to that bottom level

2032
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:12,800
ever going to get to that bottom level
 

2033
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,030
ever going to get to that bottom level
but I do think we're going to keep

2034
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:14,040
but I do think we're going to keep
 

2035
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,589
but I do think we're going to keep
penetrating different layers and get

2036
00:38:15,589 --> 00:38:15,599
penetrating different layers and get
 

2037
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,750
penetrating different layers and get
further I just wonder how far away we

2038
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:18,760
further I just wonder how far away we
 

2039
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,790
further I just wonder how far away we
are you know we all wonder that um it's

2040
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:21,800
are you know we all wonder that um it's
 

2041
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,430
are you know we all wonder that um it's
not even like what's even the measure of

2042
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:23,440
not even like what's even the measure of
 

2043
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,309
not even like what's even the measure of
how far away we are I mean one way you

2044
00:38:25,309 --> 00:38:25,319
how far away we are I mean one way you
 

2045
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:27,069
how far away we are I mean one way you
can measure it is just by our everyday

2046
00:38:27,069 --> 00:38:27,079
can measure it is just by our everyday
 

2047
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:28,510
can measure it is just by our everyday
lives in terms of our everyday lives

2048
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:28,520
lives in terms of our everyday lives
 

2049
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,630
lives in terms of our everyday lives
we've measured everything in terms of

2050
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:30,640
we've measured everything in terms of
 

2051
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,710
we've measured everything in terms of
what underlies it there's a lot more to

2052
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:32,720
what underlies it there's a lot more to
 

2053
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,790
what underlies it there's a lot more to
see and so part of it has to do with how

2054
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:34,800
see and so part of it has to do with how
 

2055
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,390
see and so part of it has to do with how
far we think we can go I mean it might

2056
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:37,400
far we think we can go I mean it might
 

2057
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,150
far we think we can go I mean it might
be that the nature of reality changes so

2058
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:40,160
be that the nature of reality changes so
 

2059
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,790
be that the nature of reality changes so
much that even these terms are different

2060
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:42,800
much that even these terms are different
 

2061
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,910
much that even these terms are different
maybe we measure you know this the

2062
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:44,920
maybe we measure you know this the
 

2063
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,950
maybe we measure you know this the
notion of distance itself might break

2064
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:46,960
notion of distance itself might break
 

2065
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,870
notion of distance itself might break
down at some point but also to push back

2066
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:49,880
down at some point but also to push back
 

2067
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,390
down at some point but also to push back
on the we've measured everything maybe

2068
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:51,400
on the we've measured everything maybe
 

2069
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,870
on the we've measured everything maybe
there's stuff we haven't even considered

2070
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:52,880
there's stuff we haven't even considered
 

2071
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,990
there's stuff we haven't even considered
as measurable for example Consciousness

2072
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:56,000
as measurable for example Consciousness
 

2073
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,390
as measurable for example Consciousness
or did

2074
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:57,400
or did
 

2075
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,990
or did
there's there might be stuff just like

2076
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:00,000
there's there might be stuff just like
 

2077
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,910
there's there might be stuff just like
you said forces unseen undetected so

2078
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:02,920
you said forces unseen undetected so
 

2079
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,870
you said forces unseen undetected so
it's an interesting thing so one and

2080
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:04,880
it's an interesting thing so one and
 

2081
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,309
it's an interesting thing so one and
this is often a confusion that happens

2082
00:39:07,309 --> 00:39:07,319
this is often a confusion that happens
 

2083
00:39:07,319 --> 00:39:09,109
this is often a confusion that happens
so there's sort of the fundamental stuff

2084
00:39:09,109 --> 00:39:09,119
so there's sort of the fundamental stuff
 

2085
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,309
so there's sort of the fundamental stuff
underlying it and then there's sort of

2086
00:39:11,309 --> 00:39:11,319
underlying it and then there's sort of
 

2087
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:12,589
underlying it and then there's sort of
the higher levels what you know what

2088
00:39:12,589 --> 00:39:12,599
the higher levels what you know what
 

2089
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:14,190
the higher levels what you know what
we'll call like an effective Theory at

2090
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:14,200
we'll call like an effective Theory at
 

2091
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,670
we'll call like an effective Theory at
some level you know so we're not always

2092
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:16,680
some level you know so we're not always
 

2093
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,510
some level you know so we're not always
working I mean when I throw a ball I

2094
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:18,520
working I mean when I throw a ball I
 

2095
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,589
working I mean when I throw a ball I
don't tell you where every atom is I

2096
00:39:20,589 --> 00:39:20,599
don't tell you where every atom is I
 

2097
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:22,630
don't tell you where every atom is I
tell you there's a ball and so there

2098
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:22,640
tell you there's a ball and so there
 

2099
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,950
tell you there's a ball and so there
might be different layers of reality

2100
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:24,960
might be different layers of reality
 

2101
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,190
might be different layers of reality
that are built on ter terms of the

2102
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:27,200
that are built on ter terms of the
 

2103
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,470
that are built on ter terms of the
matter that we know about in terms of

2104
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:28,480
matter that we know about in terms of
 

2105
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,190
matter that we know about in terms of
the stuff we know about that and when I

2106
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:31,200
the stuff we know about that and when I
 

2107
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,349
the stuff we know about that and when I
say we've measured everything I I say

2108
00:39:33,349 --> 00:39:33,359
say we've measured everything I I say
 

2109
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,109
say we've measured everything I I say
that with a grain of salt I mean I

2110
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:35,119
that with a grain of salt I mean I
 

2111
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,230
that with a grain of salt I mean I
measure everything St so so there's lots

2112
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:39,240
measure everything St so so there's lots
 

2113
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,470
measure everything St so so there's lots
of phenomena that we don't understand

2114
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:41,480
of phenomena that we don't understand
 

2115
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,550
of phenomena that we don't understand
that we but often there are complex

2116
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:43,560
that we but often there are complex
 

2117
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,550
that we but often there are complex
phenomena that will be given in terms of

2118
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:45,560
phenomena that will be given in terms of
 

2119
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,190
phenomena that will be given in terms of
the fundamental ingredients that we know

2120
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:47,200
the fundamental ingredients that we know
 

2121
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,670
the fundamental ingredients that we know
about but that is an interesting

2122
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:48,680
about but that is an interesting
 

2123
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,109
about but that is an interesting
question because yes there's phenomena

2124
00:39:51,109 --> 00:39:51,119
question because yes there's phenomena
 

2125
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,589
question because yes there's phenomena
that are at the higher level of

2126
00:39:52,589 --> 00:39:52,599
that are at the higher level of
 

2127
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:55,270
that are at the higher level of
abstractions that emerge but maybe like

2128
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:55,280
abstractions that emerge but maybe like
 

2129
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,790
abstractions that emerge but maybe like
with consciousness there is far out

2130
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:57,800
with consciousness there is far out
 

2131
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,150
with consciousness there is far out
people that you know think that

2132
00:39:59,150 --> 00:39:59,160
people that you know think that
 

2133
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,950
people that you know think that
Consciousness is um panus right that

2134
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:02,960
Consciousness is um panus right that
 

2135
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,910
Consciousness is um panus right that
it's there's going to be almost like a

2136
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:05,920
it's there's going to be almost like a
 

2137
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,910
it's there's going to be almost like a
fundamental force of physics that's

2138
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:07,920
fundamental force of physics that's
 

2139
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,589
fundamental force of physics that's
Consciousness that prates all matter

2140
00:40:09,589 --> 00:40:09,599
Consciousness that prates all matter
 

2141
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,630
Consciousness that prates all matter
right usually when you have a crazy

2142
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:11,640
right usually when you have a crazy
 

2143
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,670
right usually when you have a crazy
sorry okay when you have a far out

2144
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:13,680
sorry okay when you have a far out
 

2145
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,230
sorry okay when you have a far out
theory yes the thing you do is you test

2146
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:16,240
theory yes the thing you do is you test
 

2147
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,790
theory yes the thing you do is you test
all the possibilities within the

2148
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:17,800
all the possibilities within the
 

2149
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,030
all the possibilities within the
constructs that exist yeah so you don't

2150
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:20,040
constructs that exist yeah so you don't
 

2151
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,950
constructs that exist yeah so you don't
just jump to the most far out

2152
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:21,960
just jump to the most far out
 

2153
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,670
just jump to the most far out
possibility I mean you can do that but

2154
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:23,680
possibility I mean you can do that but
 

2155
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,150
possibility I mean you can do that but
then to see if it's true you either have

2156
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:25,160
then to see if it's true you either have
 

2157
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,230
then to see if it's true you either have
to find evidence of it or you have to

2158
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:27,240
to find evidence of it or you have to
 

2159
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,670
to find evidence of it or you have to
show that it's not possible without

2160
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:29,680
show that it's not possible without
 

2161
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,470
show that it's not possible without
that uh and we're very far from that I

2162
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:32,480
that uh and we're very far from that I
 

2163
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,470
that uh and we're very far from that I
think one of the criticisms of your

2164
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:34,480
think one of the criticisms of your
 

2165
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,990
think one of the criticisms of your
theory on the dinosaurs was that it

2166
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:37,000
theory on the dinosaurs was that it
 

2167
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,829
theory on the dinosaurs was that it
requires if I remember correctly for

2168
00:40:38,829 --> 00:40:38,839
requires if I remember correctly for
 

2169
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:40,470
requires if I remember correctly for
dark matter to be weirder than it

2170
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:40,480
dark matter to be weirder than it
 

2171
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,550
dark matter to be weirder than it
already is and then I think you had a

2172
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:43,560
already is and then I think you had a
 

2173
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,790
already is and then I think you had a
clever response to that can you can you

2174
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:45,800
clever response to that can you can you
 

2175
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,349
clever response to that can you can you
remind I'm not sure I remember what I

2176
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:47,359
remind I'm not sure I remember what I
 

2177
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,069
remind I'm not sure I remember what I
said then but I mean we have no idea how

2178
00:40:49,069 --> 00:40:49,079
said then but I mean we have no idea how
 

2179
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:51,190
said then but I mean we have no idea how
weird dark batter is I mean it's based

2180
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:51,200
weird dark batter is I mean it's based
 

2181
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,589
weird dark batter is I mean it's based
on everyone thinking they know what dark

2182
00:40:52,589 --> 00:40:52,599
on everyone thinking they know what dark
 

2183
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:54,510
on everyone thinking they know what dark
matter is I mean so weirder than it

2184
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:54,520
matter is I mean so weirder than it
 

2185
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,990
matter is I mean so weirder than it
already is I mean it's not already

2186
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:56,000
already is I mean it's not already
 

2187
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,630
already is I mean it's not already
anything thing we don't know what it is

2188
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:57,640
anything thing we don't know what it is
 

2189
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,630
anything thing we don't know what it is
so there's no normalization

2190
00:40:59,630 --> 00:40:59,640
so there's no normalization
 

2191
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,950
so there's no normalization
here so dark matter do we know that if

2192
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:02,960
here so dark matter do we know that if
 

2193
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,190
here so dark matter do we know that if
Dark Matter varies in density it

2194
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:05,200
Dark Matter varies in density it
 

2195
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,150
Dark Matter varies in density it
certainly does in the universe just like

2196
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:07,160
certainly does in the universe just like
 

2197
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,270
certainly does in the universe just like
I mean so for example there's more dark

2198
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:09,280
I mean so for example there's more dark
 

2199
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,790
I mean so for example there's more dark
matter in galaxies than there is between

2200
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:11,800
matter in galaxies than there is between
 

2201
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,430
matter in galaxies than there is between
galaxies so it it it clumps I mean it's

2202
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:14,440
galaxies so it it it clumps I mean it's
 

2203
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,550
galaxies so it it it clumps I mean it's
so it's it's matter so it's distributed

2204
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:16,560
so it's it's matter so it's distributed
 

2205
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,990
so it's it's matter so it's distributed
like matter it is matter it does Clump

2206
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:20,000
like matter it is matter it does Clump
 

2207
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,550
like matter it is matter it does Clump
but the the uh the full details of how

2208
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:22,560
but the the uh the full details of how
 

2209
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,790
but the the uh the full details of how
it clumps and the complexity of the

2210
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:24,800
it clumps and the complexity of the
 

2211
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,270
it clumps and the complexity of the
clumping it's understood

2212
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:27,280
clumping it's understood
 

2213
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,550
clumping it's understood
pretty well people do simulations there

2214
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:29,560
pretty well people do simulations there
 

2215
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,069
pretty well people do simulations there
I mean where where people are are always

2216
00:41:32,069 --> 00:41:32,079
I mean where where people are are always
 

2217
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:33,750
I mean where where people are are always

are there science like biology where you
know it's at a higher level the kind of

in the sort of more numerical age I mean

2268
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:26,240
in the sort of more numerical age I mean
 

2269
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,390
in the sort of more numerical age I mean
or even AI or like what does it mean to

2270
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:29,400
or even AI or like what does it mean to
 

2271
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,750
or even AI or like what does it mean to
answer a question does it mean that we

2272
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:30,760
answer a question does it mean that we
 

2273
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,390
answer a question does it mean that we
can predict it does it mean we can

2274
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:32,400
can predict it does it mean we can
 

2275
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,309
can predict it does it mean we can
reproduce it so I think we're coming up

2276
00:42:35,309 --> 00:42:35,319
reproduce it so I think we're coming up
 

2277
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:36,990
reproduce it so I think we're coming up
against sort of the definition of what

00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:37,000
against sort of the definition of what
 

2279
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,230
against sort of the definition of what
we mean by science as human beings so in

2280
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:41,240
we mean by science as human beings so in
 

2281
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,790
we mean by science as human beings so in
terms of the science that we can do I I

2282
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:43,800
terms of the science that we can do I I
 

2283
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,670
terms of the science that we can do I I
don't think we'll know it until we get

2284
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:45,680
don't think we'll know it until we get
 

2285
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,430
don't think we'll know it until we get
there um you know we're trying to solve

2286
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:47,440
there um you know we're trying to solve
 

2287
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,670
there um you know we're trying to solve
hard problems and you know we've made

2288
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:49,680
hard problems and you know we've made
 

2289
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,109
hard problems and you know we've made
progress I mean if you think of how much

2290
00:42:51,109 --> 00:42:51,119
progress I mean if you think of how much
 

2291
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,990

science has advanced in the last century

00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:53,000
science has advanced in the last century
 

2293
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,430
science has advanced in the last century
or century and a half it's incredible I

2294
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:55,440
or century and a half it's incredible I
 

2295
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,109
or century and a half it's incredible I
mean you know we didn't even know the

2296
00:42:57,109 --> 00:42:57,119
mean you know we didn't even know the
 

2297
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,910
mean you know we didn't even know the
universe was expanding at the beginning

2298
00:42:58,910 --> 00:42:58,920
universe was expanding at the beginning
 

2299
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,670
universe was expanding at the beginning
of the 20th century we didn't know about

2300
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:00,680
of the 20th century we didn't know about
 

2301
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,750
of the 20th century we didn't know about
quantum mechanics at the beginning of

2302
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:01,760
quantum mechanics at the beginning of
 

2303
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,790
quantum mechanics at the beginning of
the century we didn't know about special

2304
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:02,800
the century we didn't know about special
 

2305
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,630
the century we didn't know about special
relativity that's a lot in a relatively

2306
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:05,640
relativity that's a lot in a relatively
 

2307
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,549
relativity that's a lot in a relatively
short time on depending on how you think

2308
00:43:08,549 --> 00:43:08,559
short time on depending on how you think
 

2309
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:11,790
short time on depending on how you think
of time um so I think it would be

2310
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:11,800
of time um so I think it would be
 

2311
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,430
of time um so I think it would be
premature to say we know the limitations

2312
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:14,440
premature to say we know the limitations
 

2313
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,710
premature to say we know the limitations
and at various points throughout that

2314
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:15,720
and at various points throughout that
 

2315
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,589
and at various points throughout that
history we thought we solved everything

2316
00:43:17,589 --> 00:43:17,599
history we thought we solved everything
 

2317
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,190
history we thought we solved everything
or declared or at least various people

2318
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:20,200
or declared or at least various people
 

2319
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,069
or declared or at least various people
various people exactly yeah declared

2320
00:43:22,069 --> 00:43:22,079
various people exactly yeah declared
 

2321
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,309
various people exactly yeah declared
that we've solved everything uh so this

2322
00:43:24,309 --> 00:43:24,319
that we've solved everything uh so this
 

2323
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:26,670
that we've solved everything uh so this
also a good place to maybe could you

2324
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:26,680
also a good place to maybe could you
 

2325
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,549
also a good place to maybe could you
describe the difference between top down

2326
00:43:28,549 --> 00:43:28,559
describe the difference between top down
 

2327
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:30,670
describe the difference between top down
and bottom up approaches to theoretical

2328
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:30,680
and bottom up approaches to theoretical
 

2329
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,910
and bottom up approaches to theoretical
physics that you talked about in the

2330
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:31,920
physics that you talked about in the
 

2331
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,109
physics that you talked about in the
book so you could try to jump in and say

2332
00:43:36,109 --> 00:43:36,119
book so you could try to jump in and say
 

2333
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:38,150
book so you could try to jump in and say
I have a theory that I think is so

2334
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:38,160
I have a theory that I think is so
 

2335
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:43,030
I have a theory that I think is so
perfect um that I can predict everything

2336
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:43,040
perfect um that I can predict everything
 

2337
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,030
perfect um that I can predict everything
from it or at least predict some salian

2338
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:45,040
from it or at least predict some salian
 

2339
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,270
from it or at least predict some salian
features from it that's top down that

2340
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:47,280

you know like the questions we just ask

2344
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:52,480
you know like the questions we just ask
 

2345
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,190
you know like the questions we just ask
why your masses what they are we measure

2346
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:54,200
why your masses what they are we measure

and usually a good approach is to
 

2351
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,630
and usually a good approach is to
combine the two if you ask a very

2352
00:43:59,630 --> 00:43:59,640
combine the two if you ask a very
 

2353
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,150
combine the two if you ask a very
specific question but combine it with

2354
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:02,160
specific question but combine it with
 

2355
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,750
specific question but combine it with
the methods of knowing that there could

the methods of knowing that there could
be a fundamental Theory underlying it

were more top down than I am so that we
 

2373
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,549
were more top down than I am so that we

we had thought they were so he was very
 

2405
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,069
we had thought they were so he was very
much about bottom up person and in fact

00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:57,079
much about bottom up person and in fact
 

2407
00:44:57,079 --> 00:44:59,510
much about bottom up person and in fact
he resisted top down for a long time

he was helped by a mathematician who had

2420
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:11,960
he was helped by a mathematician who had
 

2421
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,069
he was helped by a mathematician who had
developed some differential geometry and

2422
00:45:14,069 --> 00:45:14,079
developed some differential geometry and
 

2423
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,950
developed some differential geometry and
helped him figure out how to write down

2424
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:15,960
helped him figure out how to write down
 

2425
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,710
helped him figure out how to write down
that and after that he thought top down

2426
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:17,720
that and after that he thought top down
 

2427
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,309
that and after that he thought top down
was the way to go but he actually didn't

2428
00:45:19,309 --> 00:45:19,319
was the way to go but he actually didn't
 

2429
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:22,109
was the way to go but he actually didn't
make that much progress um but certainly

2430
00:45:22,109 --> 00:45:22,119
make that much progress um but certainly
 

2431
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:24,510
make that much progress um but certainly
so I think it's you know naive to think

2432
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:24,520
so I think it's you know naive to think
 

2433
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,670
so I think it's you know naive to think
it was just one or the other in fact a

2434
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:26,680
it was just one or the other in fact a
 

2435
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,630
it was just one or the other in fact a
lot of people who made real progress

2436
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:28,640
lot of people who made real progress
 

2437
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,750
lot of people who made real progress

00:45:34,109 --> 00:45:34,119
speaking of mathematicians uh what to
 

2441
00:45:34,119 --> 00:45:36,069
speaking of mathematicians uh what to
use a difference because you've had a

use a difference because you've had a
 

2443
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:37,950
use a difference because you've had a
bit of foot in both uh between physics

2444
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:37,960
bit of foot in both uh between physics
 

2445
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,109
bit of foot in both uh between physics
and Mathematics in the way it helps us

2446
00:45:40,109 --> 00:45:40,119
and Mathematics in the way it helps us

frank there's a lot more overlap in

00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:44,200
frank there's a lot more overlap in
 

2451
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,190
frank there's a lot more overlap in
physics and math I think than has been I

00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:47,760
mean well maybe not more but there's
 

2455
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,349
mean well maybe not more but there's
certainly a lot but I think again the

00:45:50,349 --> 00:45:50,359
certainly a lot but I think again the
 

2457
00:45:50,359 --> 00:45:52,710
certainly a lot but I think again the
kinds of questions you're asking are

00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:52,720
kinds of questions you're asking are
 

2459
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,230
kinds of questions you're asking are
usually different um mathematicians like

2460
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:55,240
usually different um mathematicians like
 

2461
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,670
usually different um mathematicians like

on the consequences for the world um but
 

2467
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,270
on the consequences for the world um but
there is a lot of overlap the string

there is a lot of overlap the string

2475
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:14,349
of mathematical Beauty to it there's
also you know there's also some really

2476
00:46:14,349 --> 00:46:14,359
also you know there's also some really
 

2477
00:46:14,359 --> 00:46:15,990
also you know there's also some really
cool ideas that you get in particle

2478
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:16,000
cool ideas that you get in particle
 

2479
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,829
cool ideas that you get in particle
physics where you can describe what's

2480
00:46:17,829 --> 00:46:17,839
physics where you can describe what's
 

2481
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:19,549
physics where you can describe what's
going on and connect it to other ideas

2482
00:46:19,549 --> 00:46:19,559
going on and connect it to other ideas
 

2483
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:22,270
going on and connect it to other ideas
that's also really beautiful um you know

2484
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:22,280
that's also really beautiful um you know
 

2485
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,150
that's also really beautiful um you know
I think I think basically insights can

2486
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:24,160
I think I think basically insights can
 

2487
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,069
I think I think basically insights can
be beautiful um you know they might seem

2488
00:46:27,069 --> 00:46:27,079
be beautiful um you know they might seem
 

2489
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:28,870
be beautiful um you know they might seem
simple but sometime and sometimes they

2490
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:28,880
simple but sometime and sometimes they
 

2491
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,030
simple but sometime and sometimes they
genuinely are and sometimes they're

2492
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:31,040
genuinely are and sometimes they're
 

2493
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,750
genuinely are and sometimes they're
built on a whole system that you have to

2494
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:33,760
built on a whole system that you have to
 

2495
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,270
built on a whole system that you have to
understand before I mean if you actually

2496
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:35,280
understand before I mean if you actually
 

2497
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,470
understand before I mean if you actually
saw Einstein's equations written out in

2498
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:37,480
saw Einstein's equations written out in
 

2499
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,150
saw Einstein's equations written out in
components you wouldn't think it's so

2500
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:39,160
components you wouldn't think it's so
 

2501
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,190
components you wouldn't think it's so
beautiful you write it in a compact way

2502
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:41,200
beautiful you write it in a compact way
 

2503
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,829
beautiful you write it in a compact way
it looks nice uh what do you think about

2504
00:46:44,829 --> 00:46:44,839
it looks nice uh what do you think about
 

2505
00:46:44,839 --> 00:46:46,829
it looks nice uh what do you think about
the successes and the failures of string

2506
00:46:46,829 --> 00:46:46,839
the successes and the failures of string
 

2507
00:46:46,839 --> 00:46:49,829
the successes and the failures of string
theory to what degree do you think it's

2508
00:46:49,829 --> 00:46:49,839
theory to what degree do you think it's
 

2509
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:51,910
theory to what degree do you think it's
succeeded to what degree is it not

2510
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:51,920
succeeded to what degree is it not
 

2511
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,230
succeeded to what degree is it not
succeeded yet or has failed I think to

2512
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:55,240
succeeded yet or has failed I think to
 

2513
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,150
succeeded yet or has failed I think to
talk about any science in terms of

2514
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:57,160
talk about any science in terms of
 

2515
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,349
talk about any science in terms of
success and failure often misses the

2516
00:46:59,349 --> 00:46:59,359
success and failure often misses the
 

2517
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,510
success and failure often misses the
point because there's not some absolute

2518
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:01,520
point because there's not some absolute
 

2519
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,030
point because there's not some absolute
thing and I think I do think that

2520
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:05,040
thing and I think I do think that
 

2521
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,870
thing and I think I do think that
strength theorists were a bit overly

2522
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:06,880
strength theorists were a bit overly
 

2523
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,829
strength theorists were a bit overly
ambitious not overly ambitious but a

2524
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:08,839
ambitious not overly ambitious but a
 

2525
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:10,510
ambitious not overly ambitious but a
little bit overly arrogant in the

00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:10,520
little bit overly arrogant in the

00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,190
little bit overly arrogant in the

00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:12,200
beginning thinking they could solve many
 

2529
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,309

problems that they weren't going to

2530
00:47:13,309 --> 00:47:13,319
problems that they weren't going to
 

2531
00:47:13,319 --> 00:47:16,030
problems that they weren't going to
solve that's not to say the methods and

2532
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:16,040
solve that's not to say the methods and
 

2533
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,790
solve that's not to say the methods and
um advances in strength Theory don't

2534
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:17,800
um advances in strength Theory don't
 

2535
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,190
um advances in strength Theory don't
exist and um but they certainly weren't

2536
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:21,200
exist and um but they certainly weren't
 

2537
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,630
exist and um but they certainly weren't
able to immediately solve all the

2538
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:22,640
able to immediately solve all the
 

2539
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,630
able to immediately solve all the
problems they thought they could solve

2540
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:24,640
problems they thought they could solve
 

2541
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,589
problems they thought they could solve
but it has given us tools it has given

2542
00:47:27,589 --> 00:47:27,599
but it has given us tools it has given
 

2543
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:31,390
but it has given us tools it has given
us some insights um but it becomes

00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:31,400
us some insights um but it becomes
 

2545
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,230
us some insights um but it becomes
almost a sociological question of like

00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:33,240
almost a sociological question of like
 

2547
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,270
almost a sociological question of like
how much it should be one or the other I

2548
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:35,280
how much it should be one or the other I
 

2549
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,990
how much it should be one or the other I
do think that you can get caught up in

2550
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:37,000
do think that you can get caught up in
 

2551
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,230
do think that you can get caught up in
the problems themselves and and

2552
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:39,240
the problems themselves and and
 

2553
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,470
the problems themselves and and
sometimes you can get caught up in the

2554
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:40,480
sometimes you can get caught up in the
 

2555
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,349
sometimes you can get caught up in the
methods and just sort of do other

2556
00:47:42,349 --> 00:47:42,359
methods and just sort of do other
 

2557
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:45,069
methods and just sort of do other
examples so the real physics insights

2558
00:47:45,069 --> 00:47:45,079
examples so the real physics insights
 

2559
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:46,430
examples so the real physics insights
often come from people who are thinking

2560
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:46,440
often come from people who are thinking
 

2561
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,589
often come from people who are thinking
about physics as well as as math because

2562
00:47:49,589 --> 00:47:49,599
about physics as well as as math because
 

2563
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:52,150
about physics as well as as math because
you mention AI is there

2564
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:52,160
you mention AI is there
 

2565
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:58,109
you mention AI is there
hope that AI might be able to help

2566
00:47:58,109 --> 00:47:58,119

 

2567
00:47:58,119 --> 00:47:59,910

find some interesting insights I mean

2568
00:47:59,910 --> 00:47:59,920
find some interesting insights I mean
 

2569
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,990
find some interesting insights I mean
another question another way to ask this

2570
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:02,000
another question another way to ask this
 

2571
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,150
another question another way to ask this
question is how special are humans that

2572
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:04,160
question is how special are humans that
 

2573
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,910
question is how special are humans that
were able to discover novel insights

2574
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:06,920
were able to discover novel insights
 

2575
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:07,990
were able to discover novel insights
about the

2576
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:08,000
about the
 

2577
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,030
about the
world that's a great question um and it

2578
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:12,040
world that's a great question um and it
 

2579
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,750
world that's a great question um and it
depends what kind of insights and we're

2580
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:13,760
depends what kind of insights and we're
 

2581
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,829
depends what kind of insights and we're
going to find that out I mean you know

2582
00:48:15,829 --> 00:48:15,839
going to find that out I mean you know
 

2583
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:18,069
going to find that out I mean you know
it's because it's hard to think about

2584
00:48:18,069 --> 00:48:18,079
it's because it's hard to think about
 

2585
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:20,710
it's because it's hard to think about
something that doesn't quite exist yet I

2586
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:20,720
something that doesn't quite exist yet I
 

2587
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,950
something that doesn't quite exist yet I
mean I could just think about something

2588
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:22,960
mean I could just think about something
 

2589
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,430
mean I could just think about something
take a step back you know it's a little

2590
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:24,440
take a step back you know it's a little
 

2591
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,190
take a step back you know it's a little
bit like trying to understand three four

2592
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:26,200
bit like trying to understand three four
 

2593
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,430
bit like trying to understand three four
dimensions you go back to three

2594
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:27,440
dimensions you go back to three
 

2595
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,470
dimensions you go back to three
dimension you know so go to something

2596
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:29,480
dimension you know so go to something
 

2597
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,630
dimension you know so go to something
you can imagine so you can sort of say a

2598
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:32,640
you can imagine so you can sort of say a
 

2599
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,670
you can imagine so you can sort of say a
lot of the things in a very different

2600
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:34,680
lot of the things in a very different
 

2601
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,829
lot of the things in a very different
level about the internet you can say you

2602
00:48:36,829 --> 00:48:36,839
level about the internet you can say you
 

2603
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:40,309
level about the internet you can say you
know has the internet helped do things

2604
00:48:40,309 --> 00:48:40,319
know has the internet helped do things
 

2605
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:41,829
know has the internet helped do things
and that you know it definitely took on

2606
00:48:41,829 --> 00:48:41,839
and that you know it definitely took on
 

2607
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,950
and that you know it definitely took on
a life of its own in some sense but it's

2608
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:43,960
a life of its own in some sense but it's
 

2609
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:46,510
a life of its own in some sense but it's
also something that we're able to tame

2610
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:46,520
also something that we're able to tame
 

2611
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,510
also something that we're able to tame
you know I know that I myself wouldn't

2612
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:48,520
you know I know that I myself wouldn't
 

2613
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,710
you know I know that I myself wouldn't
have been able to write books if the

2614
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:49,720
have been able to write books if the
 

2615
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,230
have been able to write books if the
internet didn't exist because I wouldn't

2616
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:51,240
internet didn't exist because I wouldn't
 

2617
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,510
internet didn't exist because I wouldn't
have had the time to go to the library

2618
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:52,520
have had the time to go to the library
 

2619
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:55,510
have had the time to go to the library
and look everything up and um it helped

2620
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:55,520
and look everything up and um it helped
 

2621
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:59,510
and look everything up and um it helped
me enormously and in some sense AI could

2622
00:48:59,510 --> 00:48:59,520
me enormously and in some sense AI could
 

2623
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,789
me enormously and in some sense AI could
be that in a very nice World it could be

2624
00:49:01,789 --> 00:49:01,799
be that in a very nice World it could be
 

2625
00:49:01,799 --> 00:49:05,390
be that in a very nice World it could be
a tool that helps us go a step further

2626
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:05,400
a tool that helps us go a step further
 

2627
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,349
a tool that helps us go a step further
or than we would and a lot more

2628
00:49:07,349 --> 00:49:07,359
or than we would and a lot more
 

2629
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:09,589
or than we would and a lot more
efficiently and it's already done that

2630
00:49:09,589 --> 00:49:09,599
efficiently and it's already done that
 

2631
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:12,829
efficiently and it's already done that
to some extent or it could be like the

2632
00:49:12,829 --> 00:49:12,839
to some extent or it could be like the
 

2633
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:14,109
to some extent or it could be like the
parts of the internet that we can't

2634
00:49:14,109 --> 00:49:14,119
parts of the internet that we can't
 

2635
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:16,390
parts of the internet that we can't
control that are ruining politics or

2636
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:16,400
control that are ruining politics or
 

2637
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,630
control that are ruining politics or
whatever so and there's certainly a lot

2638
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:18,640
whatever so and there's certainly a lot
 

2639
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,789
whatever so and there's certainly a lot
of indications that can do that then

2640
00:49:20,789 --> 00:49:20,799
of indications that can do that then
 

2641
00:49:20,799 --> 00:49:22,750
of indications that can do that then
there are even bigger things that you

2642
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:22,760
there are even bigger things that you
 

2643
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:25,710
there are even bigger things that you
know people speculate about about AI

2644
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:25,720
know people speculate about about AI
 

2645
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,750
know people speculate about about AI
being able to do its own things but in

2646
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:27,760
being able to do its own things but in
 

2647
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,670
being able to do its own things but in
terms of actually figuring things out um

2648
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:30,680
terms of actually figuring things out um
 

2649
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,549
terms of actually figuring things out um
you know we're in the early

2650
00:49:32,549 --> 00:49:32,559
you know we're in the early
 

2651
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:34,589
you know we're in the early
stages yeah there's several directions

2652
00:49:34,589 --> 00:49:34,599
stages yeah there's several directions
 

2653
00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:36,270
stages yeah there's several directions
here one is like on the theorem prover

2654
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:36,280
here one is like on the theorem prover
 

2655
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,950
here one is like on the theorem prover
side so wolf from alpha where everything

2656
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:37,960
side so wolf from alpha where everything
 

2657
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,430
side so wolf from alpha where everything
is much more precise and when you have

2658
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:40,440
is much more precise and when you have
 

2659
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,990
is much more precise and when you have
large language model type of

2660
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:43,000
large language model type of
 

2661
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,870
large language model type of
stuff one of the limitations of those is

2662
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:45,880
stuff one of the limitations of those is
 

2663
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,150
stuff one of the limitations of those is
it seems to come up with convincing

2664
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:48,160
it seems to come up with convincing
 

2665
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,349
it seems to come up with convincing
looking things which we don't know if

2666
00:49:50,349 --> 00:49:50,359
looking things which we don't know if
 

2667
00:49:50,359 --> 00:49:52,870
looking things which we don't know if
it's true or not right and that's a big

2668
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:52,880
it's true or not right and that's a big
 

2669
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,829
it's true or not right and that's a big
problem for physics so large languin

2670
00:49:54,829 --> 00:49:54,839
problem for physics so large languin
 

2671
00:49:54,839 --> 00:49:55,910
problem for physics so large languin
models are more or less like

2672
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:55,920
models are more or less like
 

2673
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,870
models are more or less like
generalizations of stuff that we have so

2674
00:49:58,870 --> 00:49:58,880
generalizations of stuff that we have so
 

2675
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,470
generalizations of stuff that we have so
the question is so there's still

2676
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:02,480
the question is so there's still
 

2677
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,309
the question is so there's still
breakthroughs in AI waiting to happen

2678
00:50:04,309 --> 00:50:04,319
breakthroughs in AI waiting to happen
 

2679
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,190
breakthroughs in AI waiting to happen
and maybe they are happening and maybe

2680
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:06,200
and maybe they are happening and maybe
 

2681
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,789
and maybe they are happening and maybe
they'll be good maybe not but that's not

2682
00:50:08,789 --> 00:50:08,799
they'll be good maybe not but that's not
 

2683
00:50:08,799 --> 00:50:11,270
they'll be good maybe not but that's not
quite the same I mean maybe just some in

2684
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:11,280
quite the same I mean maybe just some in
 

2685
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,430
quite the same I mean maybe just some in
some cases it's just pattern recognition

2686
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:13,440
some cases it's just pattern recognition
 

2687
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,190
some cases it's just pattern recognition
that leads to important things but

2688
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:16,200
that leads to important things but
 

2689
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,789
that leads to important things but
sometimes it could be something more

2690
00:50:17,789 --> 00:50:17,799
sometimes it could be something more
 

2691
00:50:17,799 --> 00:50:19,349
sometimes it could be something more
insightful than that that I can't even

2692
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:19,359
insightful than that that I can't even
 

2693
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:23,150
insightful than that that I can't even
put my finger on so it forces us to I

2694
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:23,160
put my finger on so it forces us to I
 

2695
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,510
put my finger on so it forces us to I
mean we don't really understand how

2696
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:24,520
mean we don't really understand how
 

2697
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,309
mean we don't really understand how
smart we are we don't understand how we

2698
00:50:26,309 --> 00:50:26,319
smart we are we don't understand how we
 

2699
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:27,710
smart we are we don't understand how we
think about things all that well

2700
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:27,720
think about things all that well
 

2701
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,829
think about things all that well
actually but one thing is true that we

2702
00:50:29,829 --> 00:50:29,839
actually but one thing is true that we
 

2703
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:32,069
actually but one thing is true that we
are a lot more efficient right now than

2704
00:50:32,069 --> 00:50:32,079
are a lot more efficient right now than
 

2705
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:33,710
are a lot more efficient right now than
computers and coming up with things we

2706
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:33,720
computers and coming up with things we
 

2707
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,390
computers and coming up with things we
require a lot less energy to do that so

2708
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:36,400
require a lot less energy to do that so
 

2709
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,230
require a lot less energy to do that so
if computers figure out how to do that

2710
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:39,240
if computers figure out how to do that
 

2711
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,670
if computers figure out how to do that
then it's going to be a totally

2712
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:40,680
then it's going to be a totally
 

2713
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,750
then it's going to be a totally
different ball game so and so there are

2714
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:42,760
different ball game so and so there are
 

2715
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,230
different ball game so and so there are
clearly kinds of connections that we

2716
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:44,240
clearly kinds of connections that we
 

2717
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,150
clearly kinds of connections that we
don't know how we're making but we are

2718
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:46,160
don't know how we're making but we are
 

2719
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,589
don't know how we're making but we are
making them and so that's going to be

2720
00:50:49,589 --> 00:50:49,599
making them and so that's going to be
 

2721
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:52,270
making them and so that's going to be
interesting so um you know I say we're

2722
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:52,280
interesting so um you know I say we're
 

2723
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,950
interesting so um you know I say we're
in early stages but this is changing

2724
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:53,960
in early stages but this is changing
 

2725
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:58,309
in early stages but this is changing
very rapidly but right now I don't think

2726
00:50:58,309 --> 00:50:58,319
very rapidly but right now I don't think
 

2727
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:01,630
very rapidly but right now I don't think
that it's actually you know we

2728
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:01,640
that it's actually you know we
 

2729
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,510
that it's actually you know we
discovered like new laws of physics but

2730
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:03,520
discovered like new laws of physics but
 

2731
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,829
discovered like new laws of physics but
could in the future maybe it can it will

2732
00:51:06,829 --> 00:51:06,839
could in the future maybe it can it will
 

2733
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:09,430
could in the future maybe it can it will
raise big questions

2734
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:09,440
raise big questions
 

2735
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,190
raise big questions
about what is special about humans that

2736
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:12,200
about what is special about humans that
 

2737
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,990
about what is special about humans that
we don't quite appreciate you know with

2738
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:15,000
we don't quite appreciate you know with
 

2739
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,150
we don't quite appreciate you know with
there could be things that are like that

2740
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:17,160
there could be things that are like that
 

2741
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:21,030
there could be things that are like that
leap of insight that happens truly novel

2742
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:21,040
leap of insight that happens truly novel
 

2743
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,109
leap of insight that happens truly novel
ideas that could potentially be very

2744
00:51:24,109 --> 00:51:24,119
ideas that could potentially be very
 

2745
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:26,190
ideas that could potentially be very
difficult to do

2746
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:26,200
difficult to do
 

2747
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,030
difficult to do
so there are sort of abstract questions

2748
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:28,040
so there are sort of abstract questions
 

2749
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,589
so there are sort of abstract questions
like that there's also questions of how

2750
00:51:30,589 --> 00:51:30,599
like that there's also questions of how
 

2751
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:34,030
like that there's also questions of how
is it that we can address to some extent

2752
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:34,040
is it that we can address to some extent
 

2753
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,870
is it that we can address to some extent
you know how will AI be used in the

2754
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:35,880
you know how will AI be used in the
 

2755
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,270
you know how will AI be used in the
context of the world we live in which is

2756
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:38,280
context of the world we live in which is
 

2757
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,990
context of the world we live in which is
based on you know at least our country

2758
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:40,000
based on you know at least our country
 

2759
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,589
based on you know at least our country
is based on capitalism and a certain

2760
00:51:41,589 --> 00:51:41,599
is based on capitalism and a certain
 

2761
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:44,349
is based on capitalism and a certain
political system and how will global

2762
00:51:44,349 --> 00:51:44,359
political system and how will global
 

2763
00:51:44,359 --> 00:51:47,309
political system and how will global
politics deal with it how will our

2764
00:51:47,309 --> 00:51:47,319
politics deal with it how will our
 

2765
00:51:47,319 --> 00:51:48,670
politics deal with it how will our
capitalist system deal with it what will

2766
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:48,680
capitalist system deal with it what will
 

2767
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,670
capitalist system deal with it what will
be the things that we focus on doing

2768
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:50,680
be the things that we focus on doing
 

2769
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,150
be the things that we focus on doing
with it how much will researchers get

2770
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:53,160
with it how much will researchers get
 

2771
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,950
with it how much will researchers get
control of it um to be able to ask

2772
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:55,960
control of it um to be able to ask
 

2773
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,870
control of it um to be able to ask
different sorts of questions I mean you

2774
00:51:57,870 --> 00:51:57,880
different sorts of questions I mean you
 

2775
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,710
different sorts of questions I mean you
know while it was starting out people

2776
00:51:59,710 --> 00:51:59,720
know while it was starting out people
 

2777
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:02,030
know while it was starting out people
were doing these kind of toy problems

2778
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:02,040
were doing these kind of toy problems
 

2779
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,990
were doing these kind of toy problems
but what will it actually be applied to

2780
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:04,000
but what will it actually be applied to
 

2781
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,150
but what will it actually be applied to
and what will it be optimized to do

2782
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:06,160
and what will it be optimized to do
 

2783
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,150
and what will it be optimized to do
there's there's a lot of questions out

2784
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:08,160
there's there's a lot of questions out
 

2785
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,349
there's there's a lot of questions out
there that it's really important we

2786
00:52:09,349 --> 00:52:09,359
there that it's really important we
 

2787
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:10,270
there that it's really important we
start

2788
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:10,280
start
 

2789
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:13,789
start
addressing uh what to you

2790
00:52:13,789 --> 00:52:13,799
addressing uh what to you
 

2791
00:52:13,799 --> 00:52:18,750
addressing uh what to you
is the most beautiful unsolved problem

2792
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:18,760
is the most beautiful unsolved problem
 

2793
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,309
is the most beautiful unsolved problem
in physics in cosmology what you is

2794
00:52:21,309 --> 00:52:21,319
in physics in cosmology what you is
 

2795
00:52:21,319 --> 00:52:24,710
in physics in cosmology what you is
really exciting if we can unlock the

2796
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:24,720
really exciting if we can unlock the
 

2797
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:28,069
really exciting if we can unlock the
mystery of in the next few

2798
00:52:28,069 --> 00:52:28,079
mystery of in the next few
 

2799
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:30,470
mystery of in the next few
decades um so is it what's the most

2800
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:30,480
decades um so is it what's the most
 

2801
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,870
decades um so is it what's the most
beautiful unsolved problem or what is

2802
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:31,880
beautiful unsolved problem or what is
 

2803
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,270
beautiful unsolved problem or what is
the most beautiful unsolved problem I

2804
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:33,280
the most beautiful unsolved problem I
 

2805
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,870
the most beautiful unsolved problem I
think we can make progress

2806
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:34,880
think we can make progress
 

2807
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,270
think we can make progress
on oh boy we make progress on in the

2808
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:39,280
on oh boy we make progress on in the
 

2809
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,230
on oh boy we make progress on in the
next few

2810
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:41,240
next few
 

2811
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,789
next few
centuries there's you know this most of

2812
00:52:43,789 --> 00:52:43,799
centuries there's you know this most of
 

2813
00:52:43,799 --> 00:52:45,670
centuries there's you know this most of
the questions the big questions have to

2814
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:45,680
the questions the big questions have to
 

2815
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,390
the questions the big questions have to
do with what underlies things how things

2816
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:47,400
do with what underlies things how things
 

2817
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,630
do with what underlies things how things
started what's at the base of it there's

2818
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:49,640
started what's at the base of it there's
 

2819
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:51,589
started what's at the base of it there's
also just basic questions like how that

2820
00:52:51,589 --> 00:52:51,599
also just basic questions like how that
 

2821
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:53,150
also just basic questions like how that
you asked earlier how far will science

2822
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:53,160
you asked earlier how far will science
 

2823
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,990
you asked earlier how far will science
take us how much can we understand

2824
00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:56,000
take us how much can we understand
 

2825
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,470
take us how much can we understand
um there are questions like how we got

2826
00:52:58,470 --> 00:52:58,480
um there are questions like how we got
 

2827
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,910
um there are questions like how we got
here um what underlies it are there you

2828
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:01,920
here um what underlies it are there you
 

2829
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,870
here um what underlies it are there you
know but also I mean there's really deep

2830
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:04,880
know but also I mean there's really deep
 

2831
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,109
know but also I mean there's really deep
questions like you know what fraction

2832
00:53:07,109 --> 00:53:07,119
questions like you know what fraction
 

2833
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:08,750
questions like you know what fraction
are we actually seeing if there are

2834
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:08,760
are we actually seeing if there are
 

2835
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,430
are we actually seeing if there are
these other forces if there is another

2836
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:10,440
these other forces if there is another
 

2837
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,829
these other forces if there is another
way of seeing the world are there G you

2838
00:53:12,829 --> 00:53:12,839
way of seeing the world are there G you
 

2839
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:14,950
way of seeing the world are there G you
know universes beyond their own they're

2840
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:14,960
know universes beyond their own they're
 

2841
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,630
know universes beyond their own they're
if they're so totally different how do

2842
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:16,640
if they're so totally different how do
 

2843
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,750
if they're so totally different how do
we even comprehend them I mean how do we

2844
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:18,760
we even comprehend them I mean how do we
 

2845
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,390
we even comprehend them I mean how do we
detect like what would we even think

2846
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:20,400
detect like what would we even think
 

2847
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,270
detect like what would we even think
about them

2848
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:22,280
about them
 

2849
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:25,470
about them
so there's a lot about trying to get

2850
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:25,480
so there's a lot about trying to get
 

2851
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,950
so there's a lot about trying to get
Beyond it's always just getting beyond

2852
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:27,960
Beyond it's always just getting beyond
 

2853
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,870
Beyond it's always just getting beyond
our limited vision and limited

2854
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:30,880
our limited vision and limited
 

2855
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,069
our limited vision and limited
experience and trying to see what

2856
00:53:32,069 --> 00:53:32,079
experience and trying to see what
 

2857
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:34,510
experience and trying to see what
underlies it both it's small scales and

2858
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:34,520
underlies it both it's small scales and
 

2859
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,309
underlies it both it's small scales and
at large scales we just don't know the

2860
00:53:36,309 --> 00:53:36,319
at large scales we just don't know the
 

2861
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:38,230
at large scales we just don't know the
answers I mean I'd like to think that

2862
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:38,240
answers I mean I'd like to think that
 

2863
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,870
answers I mean I'd like to think that
we' understand more about Dark Matter

2864
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:40,880
we' understand more about Dark Matter
 

2865
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,670
we' understand more about Dark Matter
about Dark Energy about are there extra

2866
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:42,680
about Dark Energy about are there extra
 

2867
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,030
about Dark Energy about are there extra
Dimensions things that we actually work

2868
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:44,040
Dimensions things that we actually work
 

2869
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,990
Dimensions things that we actually work
on but there probably a lot beyond what

2870
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:46,000
on but there probably a lot beyond what
 

2871
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,950
on but there probably a lot beyond what
we work on that's yet to be

2872
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:48,960
we work on that's yet to be
 

2873
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,030
we work on that's yet to be
discovered yeah understanding the extra

2874
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:51,040
discovered yeah understanding the extra
 

2875
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,150
discovered yeah understanding the extra
Dimensions

2876
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:53,160
Dimensions
 

2877
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:56,150
Dimensions
piece will be really interesting thing

2878
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:56,160
piece will be really interesting thing
 

2879
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,150
piece will be really interesting thing
totally I mean if it is you know how the

2880
00:53:59,150 --> 00:53:59,160
totally I mean if it is you know how the
 

2881
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,990
totally I mean if it is you know how the
universe went from higher Dimensions to

2882
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:01,000
universe went from higher Dimensions to
 

2883
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,589
universe went from higher Dimensions to
what we see it do you know are the extra

2884
00:54:04,589 --> 00:54:04,599
what we see it do you know are the extra
 

2885
00:54:04,599 --> 00:54:06,710
what we see it do you know are the extra
Dimensions present everywhere I mean you

2886
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:06,720
Dimensions present everywhere I mean you
 

2887
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,150
Dimensions present everywhere I mean you
know one of the really interesting

2888
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:08,160
know one of the really interesting
 

2889
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,430
know one of the really interesting
pieces of physics we did that I talk

2890
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:10,440
pieces of physics we did that I talk
 

2891
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,470
pieces of physics we did that I talk
about my first book War passages is

2892
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:12,480
about my first book War passages is
 

2893
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,870
about my first book War passages is
finding out that there can be a higher

2894
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:15,880
finding out that there can be a higher
 

2895
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,630
finding out that there can be a higher
Dimension but only locally do you think

2896
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:17,640
Dimension but only locally do you think
 

2897
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,789
Dimension but only locally do you think
there's a gravity of a lower Dimension

2898
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:19,799
there's a gravity of a lower Dimension
 

2899
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:21,630
there's a gravity of a lower Dimension
so it could be like only locally do we

2900
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:21,640
so it could be like only locally do we
 

2901
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,030
so it could be like only locally do we
think we live in three dimensions it

2902
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:23,040
think we live in three dimensions it
 

2903
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,910
think we live in three dimensions it
could be higher Dimensions is different

2904
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:24,920
could be higher Dimensions is different
 

2905
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,150
could be higher Dimensions is different
this it's not actually the gravity we

2906
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:26,160
this it's not actually the gravity we
 

2907
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,910
this it's not actually the gravity we
have but it there's all sorts of

2908
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:27,920
have but it there's all sorts of
 

2909
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,109
have but it there's all sorts of
phenomena that might be out there that

2910
00:54:29,109 --> 00:54:29,119
phenomena that might be out there that
 

2911
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,710
phenomena that might be out there that
we don't know about all sorts of

2912
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:30,720
we don't know about all sorts of
 

2913
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,430
we don't know about all sorts of
evolution things time dependence that we

2914
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:32,440
evolution things time dependence that we
 

2915
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,829
evolution things time dependence that we
don't know about um and of course that's

2916
00:54:34,829 --> 00:54:34,839
don't know about um and of course that's
 

2917
00:54:34,839 --> 00:54:35,789
don't know about um and of course that's
from the point of view of particle

2918
00:54:35,789 --> 00:54:35,799
from the point of view of particle
 

2919
00:54:35,799 --> 00:54:36,910
from the point of view of particle
physics from the point of view of other

2920
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:36,920
physics from the point of view of other
 

2921
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,030
physics from the point of view of other
kinds of physics we're just beginning so

2922
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:39,040
kinds of physics we're just beginning so
 

2923
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:42,150
kinds of physics we're just beginning so
who knows yeah if the physics changes

2924
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:42,160
who knows yeah if the physics changes
 

2925
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,349
who knows yeah if the physics changes
throughout is is not homogeneous

2926
00:54:44,349 --> 00:54:44,359
throughout is is not homogeneous
 

2927
00:54:44,359 --> 00:54:46,870
throughout is is not homogeneous
throughout the universe that's that

2928
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:46,880
throughout the universe that's that
 

2929
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,390
throughout the universe that's that
would be weird I mean you know for the

2930
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:49,400
would be weird I mean you know for the
 

2931
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,829
would be weird I mean you know for the
observable universe it's the same but

2932
00:54:51,829 --> 00:54:51,839
observable universe it's the same but
 

2933
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:54,670
observable universe it's the same but
beyond the observable universe who knows

2934
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:54,680
beyond the observable universe who knows
 

2935
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:57,309
beyond the observable universe who knows
what ADV advice would you

2936
00:54:57,309 --> 00:54:57,319
what ADV advice would you
 

2937
00:54:57,319 --> 00:55:00,349
what ADV advice would you
give uh you've had an exceptional career

2938
00:55:00,349 --> 00:55:00,359
give uh you've had an exceptional career
 

2939
00:55:00,359 --> 00:55:01,630
give uh you've had an exceptional career
what advice would you give to young

2940
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:01,640
what advice would you give to young
 

2941
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,630
what advice would you give to young
people maybe High School

2942
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:03,640
people maybe High School
 

2943
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,829
people maybe High School
College on how to have a career that you

2944
00:55:06,829 --> 00:55:06,839
College on how to have a career that you
 

2945
00:55:06,839 --> 00:55:08,710
College on how to have a career that you
can be proud of and a life that you can

2946
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:08,720
can be proud of and a life that you can
 

2947
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,069
can be proud of and a life that you can
be proud of I think the weird thing

2948
00:55:11,069 --> 00:55:11,079
be proud of I think the weird thing
 

2949
00:55:11,079 --> 00:55:13,069
be proud of I think the weird thing
about being a scientist or an academic

2950
00:55:13,069 --> 00:55:13,079
about being a scientist or an academic
 

2951
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:15,069
about being a scientist or an academic
in general is you have to believe really

2952
00:55:15,069 --> 00:55:15,079
in general is you have to believe really
 

2953
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:15,990
in general is you have to believe really
strongly in what you do while

2954
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:16,000
strongly in what you do while
 

2955
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,750
strongly in what you do while
questioning it all the time you can't

2956
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:18,760
questioning it all the time you can't
 

2957
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,069
questioning it all the time you can't
you know and that's that's a hard

2958
00:55:20,069 --> 00:55:20,079
you know and that's that's a hard
 

2959
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:21,549
you know and that's that's a hard
balance to have sometimes it helps to

2960
00:55:21,549 --> 00:55:21,559
balance to have sometimes it helps to
 

2961
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:23,630
balance to have sometimes it helps to
collaborate with people but to really

2962
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:23,640
collaborate with people but to really
 

2963
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,230
collaborate with people but to really
believe that you could have good ideas

2964
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:25,240
believe that you could have good ideas
 

2965
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,510
believe that you could have good ideas
at the same time knowing they could all

2966
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:26,520
at the same time knowing they could all
 

2967
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,870
at the same time knowing they could all
be wrong that's that's that's a tough

2968
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:28,880
be wrong that's that's that's a tough
 

2969
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,150
be wrong that's that's that's a tough
tight rope to walk sometimes but to

2970
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:31,160
tight rope to walk sometimes but to
 

2971
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:34,549
tight rope to walk sometimes but to
really um test them out um the other

2972
00:55:34,549 --> 00:55:34,559
really um test them out um the other
 

2973
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:37,190
really um test them out um the other
thing is sometimes you know if you get

2974
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:37,200
thing is sometimes you know if you get
 

2975
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,789
thing is sometimes you know if you get
too far buried you look out and you

2976
00:55:38,789 --> 00:55:38,799
too far buried you look out and you
 

2977
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:40,870
too far buried you look out and you
think oh there's so much out there and

2978
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:40,880
think oh there's so much out there and
 

2979
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,829
think oh there's so much out there and
sometimes it's just good to bring it

2980
00:55:42,829 --> 00:55:42,839
sometimes it's just good to bring it
 

2981
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,670
sometimes it's just good to bring it
back home and just think okay can I have

2982
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:44,680
back home and just think okay can I have
 

2983
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,270
back home and just think okay can I have
as good idea as the person next to me

2984
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:46,280
as good idea as the person next to me
 

2985
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,630
as good idea as the person next to me
rather than you know the greatest

2986
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:47,640
rather than you know the greatest
 

2987
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:50,549
rather than you know the greatest
physicist who ever lived but right now

2988
00:55:50,549 --> 00:55:50,559
physicist who ever lived but right now
 

2989
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,150
physicist who ever lived but right now
like you said I think there's lots of

2990
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:52,160
like you said I think there's lots of
 

2991
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,190
like you said I think there's lots of
big issues out there and and it's hard

2992
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:54,200
big issues out there and and it's hard
 

2993
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,589
big issues out there and and it's hard
to balance that and

2994
00:55:55,589 --> 00:55:55,599
to balance that and
 

2995
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:57,510
to balance that and
sometimes it's hard to forget the role

2996
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:57,520
sometimes it's hard to forget the role
 

2997
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,589
sometimes it's hard to forget the role
of of physics but I think you know

2998
00:55:59,589 --> 00:55:59,599
of of physics but I think you know
 

2999
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:01,390
of of physics but I think you know
Wilson said it really well when he said

3000
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:01,400
Wilson said it really well when he said
 

3001
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,750
Wilson said it really well when he said
you know when they were building fmy lab

3002
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:03,760
you know when they were building fmy lab
 

3003
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,589
you know when they were building fmy lab
it was like this won't defend the

3004
00:56:05,589 --> 00:56:05,599
it was like this won't defend the
 

3005
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:06,829
it was like this won't defend the
country but it'll make it worth

3006
00:56:06,829 --> 00:56:06,839
country but it'll make it worth
 

3007
00:56:06,839 --> 00:56:08,789
country but it'll make it worth
defending you know it's just the idea

3008
00:56:08,789 --> 00:56:08,799
defending you know it's just the idea
 

3009
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:10,670
defending you know it's just the idea
that you know in all this chaos it's

3010
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:10,680
that you know in all this chaos it's
 

3011
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,069
that you know in all this chaos it's
still important that we still make

3012
00:56:12,069 --> 00:56:12,079
still important that we still make
 

3013
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:13,789
still important that we still make
progress in these things and sometimes

3014
00:56:13,789 --> 00:56:13,799
progress in these things and sometimes
 

3015
00:56:13,799 --> 00:56:15,470
progress in these things and sometimes
you know when major world events are

3016
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:15,480
you know when major world events are
 

3017
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,589
you know when major world events are
happening it's easy to forget that and I

3018
00:56:17,589 --> 00:56:17,599
happening it's easy to forget that and I
 

3019
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:18,750
happening it's easy to forget that and I
think those are important too you don't

3020
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:18,760
think those are important too you don't
 

3021
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,870
think those are important too you don't
want to forget those but to try to keep

3022
00:56:20,870 --> 00:56:20,880
want to forget those but to try to keep
 

3023
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,150
want to forget those but to try to keep
that balance because we don't want to

3024
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:22,160
that balance because we don't want to
 

3025
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,549
that balance because we don't want to
lose what it is that makes hum special

3026
00:56:24,549 --> 00:56:24,559
lose what it is that makes hum special
 

3027
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:26,109
lose what it is that makes hum special
so that's the big picture would you also

3028
00:56:26,109 --> 00:56:26,119
so that's the big picture would you also
 

3029
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:27,870
so that's the big picture would you also
lose yourself in the simple joy of

3030
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:27,880
lose yourself in the simple joy of
 

3031
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:31,950
lose yourself in the simple joy of
puzzle solving yeah yeah I mean I that's

3032
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:31,960
puzzle solving yeah yeah I mean I that's
 

3033
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,950
puzzle solving yeah yeah I mean I that's
we all like solving puzzles and actually

3034
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:34,960
we all like solving puzzles and actually
 

3035
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,270
we all like solving puzzles and actually
one of the things that drives me in my

3036
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:36,280
one of the things that drives me in my
 

3037
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,589
one of the things that drives me in my
research is the inconsistencies when

3038
00:56:38,589 --> 00:56:38,599
research is the inconsistencies when
 

3039
00:56:38,599 --> 00:56:40,190
research is the inconsistencies when
things don't make sense it really bugs

3040
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:40,200
things don't make sense it really bugs
 

3041
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:43,390
things don't make sense it really bugs
me and I just will go in to you know

3042
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:43,400
me and I just will go in to you know
 

3043
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,789
me and I just will go in to you know
different directions to see how could

3044
00:56:44,789 --> 00:56:44,799
different directions to see how could
 

3045
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:47,029
different directions to see how could
these things fit together so it bugs you

3046
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:47,039
these things fit together so it bugs you
 

3047
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:49,630
these things fit together so it bugs you
but that motivates you yeah totally

3048
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:49,640
but that motivates you yeah totally
 

3049
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:52,190
but that motivates you yeah totally
until it doesn't because I think I have

3050
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:52,200
until it doesn't because I think I have
 

3051
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,430
until it doesn't because I think I have
this underlying belief that it should

3052
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:53,440
this underlying belief that it should
 

3053
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,349
this underlying belief that it should
make sense even though the world comes

3054
00:56:55,349 --> 00:56:55,359
make sense even though the world comes
 

3055
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:57,069
make sense even though the world comes
at you in many ways and tells you

3056
00:56:57,069 --> 00:56:57,079
at you in many ways and tells you
 

3057
00:56:57,079 --> 00:56:58,910
at you in many ways and tells you
nothing should make sense but if you

3058
00:56:58,910 --> 00:56:58,920
nothing should make sense but if you
 

3059
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,109
nothing should make sense but if you
believe that it makes sense then you

3060
00:57:00,109 --> 00:57:00,119
believe that it makes sense then you
 

3061
00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:02,430
believe that it makes sense then you
look for underlying logic and I think

3062
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:02,440
look for underlying logic and I think
 

3063
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,950
look for underlying logic and I think
that's just good advice for everything

3064
00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:03,960
that's just good advice for everything
 

3065
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,750
that's just good advice for everything
to try to find like why is it the way it

3066
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:05,760
to try to find like why is it the way it
 

3067
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,150
to try to find like why is it the way it
is I think you know we talk I talked

3068
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:08,160
is I think you know we talk I talked
 

3069
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,750
is I think you know we talk I talked
about effective theory in my second book

3070
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:09,760
about effective theory in my second book
 

3071
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,630
about effective theory in my second book
not going have in store a lot you know

3072
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:11,640
not going have in store a lot you know
 

3073
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,549
not going have in store a lot you know
it's sort of rather than ask the big

3074
00:57:13,549 --> 00:57:13,559
it's sort of rather than ask the big
 

3075
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:14,870
it's sort of rather than ask the big
questions sometimes we just ask the

3076
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:14,880
questions sometimes we just ask the
 

3077
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,630
questions sometimes we just ask the
questions about the immediate things

3078
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:16,640
questions about the immediate things
 

3079
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,829
questions about the immediate things
that we can measure and we can like I

3080
00:57:18,829 --> 00:57:18,839
that we can measure and we can like I
 

3081
00:57:18,839 --> 00:57:20,150
that we can measure and we can like I
said we can sometimes tell one that

3082
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:20,160
said we can sometimes tell one that
 

3083
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,789
said we can sometimes tell one that
we'll fail but we can have these

3084
00:57:21,789 --> 00:57:21,799
we'll fail but we can have these
 

3085
00:57:21,799 --> 00:57:24,150
we'll fail but we can have these
effective theories and sometimes I think

3086
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:24,160
effective theories and sometimes I think
 

3087
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,510
effective theories and sometimes I think
you know when we approach these big

3088
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:25,520
you know when we approach these big
 

3089
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,549
you know when we approach these big
questions it's good to do from effective

3090
00:57:27,549 --> 00:57:27,559
questions it's good to do from effective
 

3091
00:57:27,559 --> 00:57:29,390
questions it's good to do from effective
Theory point you know why do I find this

3092
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:29,400
Theory point you know why do I find this
 

3093
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,029
Theory point you know why do I find this
satisfying why is the world we have the

3094
00:57:31,029 --> 00:57:31,039
satisfying why is the world we have the
 

3095
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:33,150
satisfying why is the world we have the
way it is we think things are beautiful

3096
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:33,160
way it is we think things are beautiful
 

3097
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,349
way it is we think things are beautiful
that we live in I mean you know I'm not

3098
00:57:35,349 --> 00:57:35,359
that we live in I mean you know I'm not
 

3099
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:37,670
that we live in I mean you know I'm not
sure if we had different senses or

3100
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:37,680
sure if we had different senses or
 

3101
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:38,829
sure if we had different senses or
different ways of looking at things we

3102
00:57:38,829 --> 00:57:38,839
different ways of looking at things we
 

3103
00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:40,710
different ways of looking at things we
wouldn't necessarily find it beautiful

3104
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:40,720
wouldn't necessarily find it beautiful
 

3105
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,029
wouldn't necessarily find it beautiful
but I have to say you know it is kind of

3106
00:57:43,029 --> 00:57:43,039
but I have to say you know it is kind of
 

3107
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:45,029
but I have to say you know it is kind of
fantastic that no matter how many times

3108
00:57:45,029 --> 00:57:45,039
fantastic that no matter how many times
 

3109
00:57:45,039 --> 00:57:46,829
fantastic that no matter how many times
I see a sunset I will always find it

3110
00:57:46,829 --> 00:57:46,839
I see a sunset I will always find it
 

3111
00:57:46,839 --> 00:57:48,589
I see a sunset I will always find it
beautiful it's like I don't think I ever

3112
00:57:48,589 --> 00:57:48,599
beautiful it's like I don't think I ever
 

3113
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:50,910
beautiful it's like I don't think I ever
see a Sunset and say h whatever you know

3114
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:50,920
see a Sunset and say h whatever you know
 

3115
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,549
see a Sunset and say h whatever you know
