completely there you're kind of out of

stuff to do some people never do that
 

489
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,949
stuff to do some people never do that
some people live in that Haze and they

490
00:10:21,949 --> 00:10:21,959
some people live in that Haze and they
 

491
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:24,389
some people live in that Haze and they
never engage that mind and and when you

00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:24,399
never engage that mind and and when you
 

493
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,790
never engage that mind and and when you
when you're sitting and trying to solve

when you're sitting and trying to solve
 

495
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,269
when you're sitting and trying to solve

a a complex computer prr problem or a
 

497
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:31,509
a a complex computer prr problem or a
math problem you have to turn something

00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:31,519
math problem you have to turn something
 

499
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,550
math problem you have to turn something
on you have to in a

500
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:33,560
on you have to in a
 

501
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,069
on you have to in a
sense exert certain energy to focus on

502
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:37,079
sense exert certain energy to focus on
 

503
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:39,550
sense exert certain energy to focus on
the problem to do it and that is not

504
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:39,560
the problem to do it and that is not
 

505
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,150
the problem to do it and that is not
determined in a sense that you have to

506
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,160
determined in a sense that you have to
 

507
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,870
determined in a sense that you have to
focus you choose to focus and you could

508
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:44,880
focus you choose to focus and you could
 

509
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,990
focus you choose to focus and you could
choose not to focus and that choice is

510
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:47,000
choose not to focus and that choice is
 

511
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,030
choose not to focus and that choice is
more powerful than any other like parts

512
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:50,040
more powerful than any other like parts
 

513
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,590
more powerful than any other like parts
of our brain that we've borrowed from

514
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:51,600
of our brain that we've borrowed from
 

515
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,949
of our brain that we've borrowed from
fish and uh from our evolutionary

516
00:10:53,949 --> 00:10:53,959
fish and uh from our evolutionary
 

517
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:56,389
fish and uh from our evolutionary
origins like this whatever this crazy

518
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:56,399
origins like this whatever this crazy
 

519
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,470
origins like this whatever this crazy
little leap in evolution is that allowed

520
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:58,480
little leap in evolution is that allowed
 

521
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,990
little leap in evolution is that allowed
us to think is more important than

522
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,000
us to think is more important than
 

523
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,350
us to think is more important than
anything else so I think

524
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:03,360
anything else so I think
 

525
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,350
anything else so I think
neuroscientists pretend they know a lot

526
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:05,360
neuroscientists pretend they know a lot
 

527
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,550
neuroscientists pretend they know a lot
more about the brain than they really do

528
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:07,560
more about the brain than they really do
 

529
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,790
more about the brain than they really do
yeah um and that we know fired yeah I

530
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:11,800
yeah um and that we know fired yeah I
 

531
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,829
yeah um and that we know fired yeah I
agree with you and and and we don't know

532
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:13,839
agree with you and and and we don't know
 

533
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,590
agree with you and and and we don't know
that much yet about how the brain

534
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:15,600
that much yet about how the brain
 

535
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,550
that much yet about how the brain
functions and what's a fish you know all

536
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:17,560
functions and what's a fish you know all
 

537
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,069
functions and what's a fish you know all
this stuff so I think what what exists

538
00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:21,079
this stuff so I think what what exists
 

539
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:24,110
this stuff so I think what what exists
there is a lot of

540
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:24,120

 

541
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,269

potentialities but the beauty of the

542
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:26,279
potentialities but the beauty of the
 

543
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:28,870
potentialities but the beauty of the
human brain is it's its potentialities

544
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:28,880
human brain is it's its potentialities
 

545
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,910
human brain is it's its potentialities
that we we have to manifest through our

546
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
that we we have to manifest through our
 

547
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,509
that we we have to manifest through our
choices it's there it's sitting there

548
00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:34,519
choices it's there it's sitting there
 

549
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:36,430
choices it's there it's sitting there
and yes there's certain things that

550
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:36,440
and yes there's certain things that
 

551
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,590
and yes there's certain things that
going to evoke certain uh senses certain

552
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:41,600
going to evoke certain uh senses certain
 

553
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,790
going to evoke certain uh senses certain
feelings I'm not even saying emotions

554
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:43,800
feelings I'm not even saying emotions
 

555
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,310
feelings I'm not even saying emotions
because I think emotions are too complex

556
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:45,320
because I think emotions are too complex
 

557
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,110
because I think emotions are too complex
to have been programmed into our mind uh

558
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:48,120
to have been programmed into our mind uh
 

559
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,150
to have been programmed into our mind uh
but I don't think so you know there's

560
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,160
but I don't think so you know there's
 

561
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,590
but I don't think so you know there's
this big issue of evolutionary

562
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:51,600
this big issue of evolutionary
 

563
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,790
this big issue of evolutionary
psychology is huge right now and and

564
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:53,800
psychology is huge right now and and
 

565
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,790
psychology is huge right now and and
it's a big

566
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:54,800
it's a big
 

567
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,310
it's a big
issue you know I find

568
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:57,320
issue you know I find
 

569
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,030
issue you know I find
it to a large extent stand as way too

570
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:02,040
it to a large extent stand as way too
 

571
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,470
it to a large extent stand as way too
early and in storytelling about expost

00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:05,480
early and in storytelling about expost

00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:08,800
storytelling about about stuff we still
 

575
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,629
storytelling about about stuff we still
don't you know so for example I would

576
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:10,639
don't you know so for example I would
 

577
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,389
don't you know so for example I would
like to see evolutionary psychology

578
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:12,399
like to see evolutionary psychology
 

579
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,069
like to see evolutionary psychology
differentiate between things like

580
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:16,079
differentiate between things like

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,509

Sensations thoughts Concepts ideas what

Sensations thoughts Concepts ideas what
 

585
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,829
Sensations thoughts Concepts ideas what
of those are programmed and what of

00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:25,839
of those are programmed and what of
 

587
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,230
of those are programmed and what of
those are developed and chosen and a

those are developed and chosen and a
 

589
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,110
those are developed and chosen and a
product of reason I think anything from

590
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,120
product of reason I think anything from
 

591
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,910
product of reason I think anything from
emotion to abstract ideas is all chosen

592
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:33,920
emotion to abstract ideas is all chosen
 

593
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,310
emotion to abstract ideas is all chosen
is all a product of reason

594
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:37,320
is all a product of reason
 

595
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,189
is all a product of reason
and everything before that we might have

00:12:41,189 --> 00:12:41,199
and everything before that we might have
 

597
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:43,910
and everything before that we might have
been programmed for but the fact is so

598
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:43,920
been programmed for but the fact is so
 

599
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,990
been programmed for but the fact is so
clearly a sensation is not a product of

00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,000
clearly a sensation is not a product of

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,710
clearly a sensation is not a product of

you know is is is something that we feel

because that's how our biology works so

604
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:51,880
because that's how our biology works so
 

605
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,629
because that's how our biology works so
until we have these categories and until

about it when you ask them these

00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,150
Harris has because I you know I'm a fan
and I I like a lot of your stuff right

640
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:33,160
and I I like a lot of your stuff right
 

641
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,949
and I I like a lot of your stuff right
but on the one hand he is obviously

642
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:35,959
but on the one hand he is obviously
 

643
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:37,670
but on the one hand he is obviously
intellectually active and wants to

644
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:37,680
intellectually active and wants to
 

645
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,829
intellectually active and wants to
change our minds so he believes that we

646
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:39,839
change our minds so he believes that we
 

647
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,069
change our minds so he believes that we
have some capacity to choose on the

648
00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:42,079
have some capacity to choose on the
 

649
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,949
have some capacity to choose on the
other hand he's undermining that

650
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:43,959
other hand he's undermining that
 

651
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:45,310
other hand he's undermining that
capacity to choose by saying it's just

652
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:45,320
capacity to choose by saying it's just
 

653
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,389
capacity to choose by saying it's just
determined you're going to choose what

654
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:46,399
determined you're going to choose what
 

655
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,710
determined you're going to choose what
you choose you have no say in and

656
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:48,720
you choose you have no say in and
 

657
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,269
you choose you have no say in and
there's actually no you he he he so it's

658
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:53,279
there's actually no you he he he so it's
 

659
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,829
there's actually no you he he he so it's
you know so that and that's to me

660
00:13:54,829 --> 00:13:54,839
you know so that and that's to me
 

661
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:56,389
you know so that and that's to me
completely unscientific that's

662
00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:56,399
completely unscientific that's
 

663
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,829
completely unscientific that's
completely him you know uh pulling it

664
00:13:59,829 --> 00:13:59,839
completely him you know uh pulling it
 

665
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,509
completely him you know uh pulling it
out of nowhere we all experience the

666
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:01,519
out of nowhere we all experience the
 

667
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,790
out of nowhere we all experience the
fact that we have an

668
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:02,800
fact that we have an
 

669
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,710
fact that we have an
eye that kind of certainty saying that

670
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:05,720
eye that kind of certainty saying that
 

671
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,749
eye that kind of certainty saying that
we do not have that fundamental choice

672
00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:07,759
we do not have that fundamental choice
 

673
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:11,350
we do not have that fundamental choice
that reason provides is uh unfounded

674
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:11,360
that reason provides is uh unfounded
 

675
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,230
that reason provides is uh unfounded
currently look there's a sense in which

676
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:13,240
currently look there's a sense in which
 

677
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,069
currently look there's a sense in which
it can never be contradicted because

678
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:17,079
it can never be contradicted because
 

679
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:19,790
it can never be contradicted because
it's a product of your

680
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:19,800
it's a product of your
 

681
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,590
it's a product of your
experience it's not a product of your

682
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:21,600
experience it's not a product of your
 

683
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,069
experience it's not a product of your
experience you can experience it

684
00:14:23,069 --> 00:14:23,079
experience you can experience it
 

685
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:26,710
experience you can experience it
directly right so no science will ever

686
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:26,720
directly right so no science will ever
 

687
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,389
directly right so no science will ever
prove that this table isn't here I can

688
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:29,399
prove that this table isn't here I can
 

689
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:32,470
prove that this table isn't here I can
see it it's here right I can I can feel

690
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:32,480
see it it's here right I can I can feel
 

691
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,269
see it it's here right I can I can feel
it I I know I have free will cuz I can

692
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:35,279
it I I know I have free will cuz I can
 

693
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,110
it I I know I have free will cuz I can
introspect it in a sense I can see it I

694
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:38,120
introspect it in a sense I can see it I
 

695
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,430
introspect it in a sense I can see it I
can see myself engaging

696
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:41,440
can see myself engaging
 

697
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,590
can see myself engaging
it and that is as valid as the evidence

698
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:46,600
it and that is as valid as the evidence
 

699
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,110
it and that is as valid as the evidence
of my senses now I can't point at it so

700
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,120
of my senses now I can't point at it so
 

701
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,389
of my senses now I can't point at it so
that you can see the same thing I'm

702
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:50,399
that you can see the same thing I'm
 

703
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,629
that you can see the same thing I'm
seeing but you can do the same thing in

704
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:52,639
seeing but you can do the same thing in
 

705
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,910
seeing but you can do the same thing in
your own Consciousness and you can

706
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:53,920
your own Consciousness and you can
 

707
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,430
your own Consciousness and you can
identify the same thing and to deny that

708
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:57,440
identify the same thing and to deny that
 

709
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,829
identify the same thing and to deny that
in the name of science is to get things

710
00:14:59,829 --> 00:14:59,839
in the name of science is to get things
 

711
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,990
in the name of science is to get things
upside down you start with

712
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,000
upside down you start with
 

713
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,710
upside down you start with
that and that's the beginning of science

714
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:04,720
that and that's the beginning of science
 

715
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,310
that and that's the beginning of science
the beginning of science is the

716
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:06,320
the beginning of science is the
 

717
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,269
the beginning of science is the
identification that I choose and that I

718
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:09,279
identification that I choose and that I
 

719
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,230
identification that I choose and that I
can reason and it now I need to figure

720
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:12,240
can reason and it now I need to figure
 

721
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,590
can reason and it now I need to figure
out the mechanism the the the rules of

722
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:14,600
out the mechanism the the the rules of
 

723
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,590
out the mechanism the the the rules of
reasoning the rules of logic the you

724
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:16,600
reasoning the rules of logic the you
 

725
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,150
reasoning the rules of logic the you
know how does this work and that's where

726
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,160
know how does this work and that's where
 

727
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,030
know how does this work and that's where
science come from of course it's

728
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:20,040
science come from of course it's
 

729
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,749
science come from of course it's
possible that science like for my place

730
00:15:22,749 --> 00:15:22,759
possible that science like for my place
 

731
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:24,749
possible that science like for my place
of AI would be able

732
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:24,759
of AI would be able
 

733
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:28,110
of AI would be able
to if we were able to engineer

734
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:28,120
to if we were able to engineer
 

735
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,230
to if we were able to engineer
consciousness or understand I mean it's

736
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:31,240
consciousness or understand I mean it's
 

737
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,749
consciousness or understand I mean it's
very difficult to because we're so far

738
00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:32,759
very difficult to because we're so far
 

739
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:35,670
very difficult to because we're so far
away from it now but understand how the

740
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:35,680
away from it now but understand how the
 

741
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,550
away from it now but understand how the
actual mechanism of that Consciousness

742
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:37,560
actual mechanism of that Consciousness
 

743
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,910
actual mechanism of that Consciousness
emerges that in fact this table is not

744
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:39,920
emerges that in fact this table is not
 

745
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,150
emerges that in fact this table is not
real that we can determine that it uh

746
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:45,160
real that we can determine that it uh
 

747
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,030
real that we can determine that it uh
exactly how our mind constructs the

748
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,040
exactly how our mind constructs the
 

749
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,590
exactly how our mind constructs the
reality that we perceive then then you

750
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:49,600
reality that we perceive then then you
 

751
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,910
reality that we perceive then then you
can start to make interesting but our

752
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:51,920
can start to make interesting but our
 

753
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,430
can start to make interesting but our
mind our mind doesn't construct the

754
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:53,440
mind our mind doesn't construct the
 

755
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,069
mind our mind doesn't construct the
reality that we perceive the reality we

756
00:15:55,069 --> 00:15:55,079
reality that we perceive the reality we
 

757
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,389
reality that we perceive the reality we
perceive is there we perceive a reality

758
00:15:58,389 --> 00:15:58,399
perceive is there we perceive a reality
 

759
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,470
perceive is there we perceive a reality
that exists

760
00:15:59,470 --> 00:15:59,480
that exists
 

761
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,670
that exists
yeah now we perceive it in particular

762
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:01,680
yeah now we perceive it in particular
 

763
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,829
yeah now we perceive it in particular
ways given the nature of our senses

764
00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:04,839
ways given the nature of our senses
 

765
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,790
ways given the nature of our senses
right a bat perceives this table

766
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:06,800
right a bat perceives this table
 

767
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,949
right a bat perceives this table
differently but it's still the same

768
00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:07,959
differently but it's still the same
 

769
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:11,069
differently but it's still the same
table with the same characteristics and

770
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:11,079
table with the same characteristics and
 

771
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:15,069
table with the same characteristics and
the same identity it's just a matter of

772
00:16:15,069 --> 00:16:15,079
the same identity it's just a matter of
 

773
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:17,710
the same identity it's just a matter of
we use eyes they use a radar system to

774
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:17,720
we use eyes they use a radar system to
 

775
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,870
we use eyes they use a radar system to
you know they use sound waves to

776
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:18,880
you know they use sound waves to
 

777
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,829
you know they use sound waves to
perceive it but it's still there

778
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:20,839
perceive it but it's still there
 

779
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,069
perceive it but it's still there
existence exist whether we exist or not

780
00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:23,079
existence exist whether we exist or not
 

781
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:26,550
existence exist whether we exist or not
and so you could create I mean I don't

782
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:26,560
and so you could create I mean I don't
 

783
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,110
and so you could create I mean I don't
know how and I I don't know if it's

784
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:28,120
know how and I I don't know if it's
 

785
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,590
know how and I I don't know if it's
possible but let's say you could create

786
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:29,600
possible but let's say you could create
 

787
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,710
possible but let's say you could create
a Consciousness right and I I suspect

788
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:32,720
a Consciousness right and I I suspect
 

789
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,470
a Consciousness right and I I suspect
that to do that you would have to use

790
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:34,480
that to do that you would have to use
 

791
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,550
that to do that you would have to use
biology not just Electronics but you

792
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:37,560
biology not just Electronics but you
 

793
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,030
biology not just Electronics but you
know way outside my expertise um because

794
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,040
know way outside my expertise um because
 

795
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,790
know way outside my expertise um because
Consciousness as far as we know is a

796
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:42,800
Consciousness as far as we know is a
 

797
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,150
Consciousness as far as we know is a
phenomena of life and you would have to

798
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,160
phenomena of life and you would have to
 

799
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,030
phenomena of life and you would have to
figure out how to create life before you

800
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:46,040
figure out how to create life before you
 

801
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,230
figure out how to create life before you
created Consciousness I think but if you

802
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:49,240
created Consciousness I think but if you
 

803
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,829
created Consciousness I think but if you
did that then that wouldn't change

804
00:16:50,829 --> 00:16:50,839
did that then that wouldn't change
 

805
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:52,870
did that then that wouldn't change
anything all it would say is we have

806
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:52,880
anything all it would say is we have
 

807
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,470
anything all it would say is we have
another conscious being cool that's

808
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:54,480
another conscious being cool that's
 

809
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,150
another conscious being cool that's
great but it wouldn't change the nature

810
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:57,160
great but it wouldn't change the nature
 

811
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,629
great but it wouldn't change the nature
of our Consciousness our Consciousness

812
00:16:58,629 --> 00:16:58,639
of our Consciousness our Consciousness
 

813
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,790
of our Consciousness our Consciousness
is what it

is what it
 

815
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,470
is what it
is respect so that's very interesting I

816
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:02,480
is respect so that's very interesting I
 

817
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,230

table for discussion of objectivism
 

821
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:11,710
table for discussion of objectivism
is let me at least challenge a thought

822
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:11,720
is let me at least challenge a thought

you're familiar with uh Donald Hoffman's
 

827
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,789
you're familiar with uh Donald Hoffman's
work about reality so his idea is that

00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:19,799
work about reality so his idea is that
 

829
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,510
work about reality so his idea is that
we're just our perception is just an

00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:24,280
interface to reality so Donald Hoffman
 

833
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,949

00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:26,959
is the uh is the guy you see ofine yeah
 

835
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,429
is the uh is the guy you see ofine yeah
yes I've met Donald and I've seen his

in in case people aren't familiar I mean
it's a fascinating thought experiment to

it's a fascinating thought experiment to
 

847
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,990
it's a fascinating thought experiment to
me uh like of out of the boox thinking

I can I can through experimentation
 

887
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,669
I can I can through experimentation
discover the phenomena of radiation then

888

discover the phenomena of radiation then
 

889
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:37,029
discover the phenomena of radiation then
actually measure radiation and I don't

890
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:37,039
actually measure radiation and I don't
 

891
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,669
actually measure radiation and I don't
worry about it I can't perceive the

892
00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:38,679
worry about it I can't perceive the
 

893
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:40,310
worry about it I can't perceive the
world the way a bat perceives the world

894
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:40,320
world the way a bat perceives the world
 

895
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,870
world the way a bat perceives the world
and I might not be able to see certain

and I might not be able to see certain
 

897
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,430
and I might not be able to see certain
things that but I can we've created

898
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:44,440
things that but I can we've created
 

899
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,630
things that but I can we've created
radar so a we understand how a bat

900
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:46,640
radar so a we understand how a bat
 

901
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,909
radar so a we understand how a bat
perceives the world and I can mimic it

902
00:18:48,909 --> 00:18:48,919
perceives the world and I can mimic it
 

903
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,990
perceives the world and I can mimic it
through a radar screen and create and

904
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:51,000
through a radar screen and create and
 

905
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,990
through a radar screen and create and
images like the bat its Consciousness

906
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,000
images like the bat its Consciousness
 

907
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,029
images like the bat its Consciousness
somehow perceives it right

908
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:57,039
somehow perceives it right

so the beauty of human reason is our

910

00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,830
so the beauty of human reason is our

go down a rabbit hole and and and
 

1177
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,470
go down a rabbit hole and and and
completely get it wrong but it does give

1178
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:25,480
completely get it wrong but it does give
 

1179

you the only existing mechanism to fix
 

1181
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:30,269
you the only existing mechanism to fix
it right which is going back to reality

1182
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:30,279
it right which is going back to reality
 

1183
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:32,630
it right which is going back to reality
going back to facts going back to reason

1184
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:32,640
going back to facts going back to reason
 

1185
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,110
going back to facts going back to reason
and and and and getting out of the

1186
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:34,120
and and and and getting out of the
 

1187
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,350
and and and and getting out of the
rabbit hole and getting up back to

1188
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:36,360
rabbit hole and getting up back to
 

1189
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,430
rabbit hole and getting up back to
reality so I agree with you that it's

1190
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:39,440
reality so I agree with you that it's
 

1191
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,310
reality so I agree with you that it's
interesting to think about these what I

1192
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:43,320
interesting to think about these what I
 

1193
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,310
interesting to think about these what I
consider crazy ideas because it oh wait

1194

00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:47,960
well what is my argument about them if I
 

1197
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,470
well what is my argument about them if I
don't really have a good argument about

don't really have a good argument about
 

1199
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,430

them then do I know what I know so in
that sense it's always nice to be

having married she's having sex with rck
even though she's not married to rock

1912
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:31,000
even though she's not married to rock
 

1913
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,150
even though she's not married to rock
this is

1914
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:32,160
this is
 

1915
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,430
this is
1945 and it's um it's very jarring to

1916
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:36,440
1945 and it's um it's very jarring to
 

1917
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,470
1945 and it's um it's very jarring to
people it's very unexpected but it's

1918
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:38,480
people it's very unexpected but it's
 

1919
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,349
people it's very unexpected but it's
also a book of its time it's about

1920
00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:40,359
also a book of its time it's about
 

1921
00:39:40,359 --> 00:39:42,309
also a book of its time it's about
individuals pursuing their passion

1922
00:39:42,309 --> 00:39:42,319
individuals pursuing their passion
 

1923
00:39:42,319 --> 00:39:44,550
individuals pursuing their passion
pursuing their life and not caring about

1924
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:44,560
pursuing their life and not caring about
 

1925
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,589
pursuing their life and not caring about
convention and and what people think but

1926
00:39:47,589 --> 00:39:47,599
convention and and what people think but
 

1927
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,470
convention and and what people think but
doing what they think is right and U and

1928
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:51,480
doing what they think is right and U and
 

1929
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,309
doing what they think is right and U and
and so so I think it's it's it's uh I

1930
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:54,319
and so so I think it's it's it's uh I
 

1931
00:39:54,319 --> 00:39:56,309
and so so I think it's it's it's uh I
encourage everybody to read it obviously

1932
00:39:56,309 --> 00:39:56,319
encourage everybody to read it obviously
 

1933
00:39:56,319 --> 00:39:58,950
encourage everybody to read it obviously
so that was was that the first time she

1934
00:39:58,950 --> 00:39:58,960
so that was was that the first time she
 

1935
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,710
so that was was that the first time she
articulated start articulated something

1936
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:01,720
articulated start articulated something
 

1937
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,990
articulated start articulated something
that's sounded like a philosophy of

1938
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:04,000
that's sounded like a philosophy of
 

1939
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,390
that's sounded like a philosophy of
individualism I mean the philosophy is

1940
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:06,400
individualism I mean the philosophy is
 

1941
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,990
individualism I mean the philosophy is
there in we the living right because at

1942
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:09,000
there in we the living right because at
 

1943
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,630
there in we the living right because at
the end of the day the the woman is the

1944
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:12,640
the end of the day the the woman is the
 

1945
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,190
the end of the day the the woman is the
the hero of we the living is this

1946
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:15,200
the hero of we the living is this
 

1947
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,430
the hero of we the living is this
individualist stuck in Soviet Union so

1948
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:17,440
individualist stuck in Soviet Union so
 

1949
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,670
individualist stuck in Soviet Union so
she's struggling with these things uh so

1950
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:20,680
she's struggling with these things uh so
 

1951
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,069
she's struggling with these things uh so
the theme is there already it's not as

1952
00:40:23,069 --> 00:40:23,079
the theme is there already it's not as
 

1953
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:25,309
the theme is there already it's not as
fleshed out it's not as articulated

1954
00:40:25,309 --> 00:40:25,319
fleshed out it's not as articulated
 

1955
00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:27,309
fleshed out it's not as articulated
philosophically and it's suddenly the

1956
00:40:27,309 --> 00:40:27,319
philosophically and it's suddenly the
 

1957
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:30,390
philosophically and it's suddenly the
anthm which is a dystopia novel where

1958
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:30,400
anthm which is a dystopia novel where
 

1959
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,750
anthm which is a dystopia novel where
the this dystopia in the future has a

1960
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:32,760
the this dystopia in the future has a
 

1961
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:37,589
the this dystopia in the future has a
has uh there's no I everything is we and

1962
00:40:37,589 --> 00:40:37,599
has uh there's no I everything is we and
 

1963
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,550
has uh there's no I everything is we and
it's about one guy who breaks out of

1964
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:40,560
it's about one guy who breaks out of
 

1965
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,069
it's about one guy who breaks out of
that I don't want to give it away but

1966
00:40:42,069 --> 00:40:42,079
that I don't want to give it away but
 

1967
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,630
that I don't want to give it away but
but breaks out of that so these themes

1968
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:45,640
but breaks out of that so these themes
 

1969
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,069
but breaks out of that so these themes
are running and and then we have and we

1970
00:40:48,069 --> 00:40:48,079
are running and and then we have and we

2043
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:11,309
know uh what was it 50 you know 60 years
after the 63 years after the publication

2050
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:18,000
bestseller when it first came out is it
 

2051
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,150
bestseller when it first came out is it
true that it's like one of the most sold

2052
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:21,160
true that it's like one of the most sold
 

2053

2055
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,470

comes out sells more than atly Shrugged
but or read I've heard so there was a

2060
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:31,839
but or read I've heard so there was a
 

2061
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:34,109
but or read I've heard so there was a
very and I shouldn't say this but it's

2062
00:42:34,109 --> 00:42:34,119
very and I shouldn't say this but it's
 

2063
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:35,790
very and I shouldn't say this but it's
the truth so I'll say it a very

2064
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:35,800
the truth so I'll say it a very
 

2065
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,670
the truth so I'll say it a very
unscientific study done by the

2066
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:38,680
unscientific study done by the
 

2067
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,069
unscientific study done by the
Smithsonian Institute yeah probably in

2068
00:42:41,069 --> 00:42:41,079
Smithsonian Institute yeah probably in
 

2069
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:45,030
Smithsonian Institute yeah probably in
the early 90s that basically surveyed uh

2070
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:45,040
the early 90s that basically surveyed uh
 

2071
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,750
the early 90s that basically surveyed uh
CEOs and asked them what was the most

2072
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:47,760
CEOs and asked them what was the most
 

2073
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,910
CEOs and asked them what was the most
influential book on you and at came out

2074
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:51,920
influential book on you and at came out
 

2075
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,069
influential book on you and at came out
as number two the second most

2076
00:42:54,069 --> 00:42:54,079
as number two the second most
 

2077
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,270
as number two the second most
influential book and CEOs in in the

2078
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:56,280
influential book and CEOs in in the
 

2079
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,190
influential book and CEOs in in the
country but but there's so many flaws in

2080
00:42:58,190 --> 00:42:58,200
country but but there's so many flaws in
 

2081
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,549
country but but there's so many flaws in
the study one well you want to guess

2082
00:43:00,549 --> 00:43:00,559
the study one well you want to guess
 

2083
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:02,510
the study one well you want to guess
what the number one book Bible the Bible

2084
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:02,520
what the number one book Bible the Bible
 

2085
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,790
what the number one book Bible the Bible
yeah but the Bible was like you know so

2086
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:05,800
yeah but the Bible was like you know so
 

2087
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,190
yeah but the Bible was like you know so
maybe they serveed 100 people I don't

2088
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:07,200
maybe they serveed 100 people I don't
 

2089
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,230
maybe they serveed 100 people I don't
know what the exact numbers were but

2090
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:08,240
know what the exact numbers were but
 

2091
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,870
know what the exact numbers were but
let's say it's 100 people and 60 said

2092
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:10,880
let's say it's 100 people and 60 said
 

2093
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,589
let's say it's 100 people and 60 said
the Bible and 10 said Atlas Shrug and

2094
00:43:13,589 --> 00:43:13,599
the Bible and 10 said Atlas Shrug and
 

2095
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,069
the Bible and 10 said Atlas Shrug and
there were a bunch of books over there

2096
00:43:15,069 --> 00:43:15,079
there were a bunch of books over there
 

2097
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:16,910
there were a bunch of books over there
so you know I don't that's again the

2098
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:16,920
so you know I don't that's again the
 

2099
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,710
so you know I don't that's again the
psychology discussion what we're having

2100
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:18,720
psychology discussion what we're having
 

2101
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,150
psychology discussion what we're having
ex well and it's it's one thing I've

2102
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:21,160
ex well and it's it's one thing I've
 

2103
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,630
ex well and it's it's one thing I've
learned and maybe Co has taught me and

2104
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:23,640
learned and maybe Co has taught me and
 

2105
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,470
learned and maybe Co has taught me and
and uh nobody you know there are very

2106
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:26,480
and uh nobody you know there are very
 

2107
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,510
and uh nobody you know there are very
few people who know how to do statistics

2108
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:29,520
few people who know how to do statistics
 

2109
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,270
few people who know how to do statistics
and almost nobody knows how to think

2110
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:32,280
and almost nobody knows how to think
 

2111
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,549
and almost nobody knows how to think
probabilistically that is think in terms

2112
00:43:34,549 --> 00:43:34,559
probabilistically that is think in terms
 

2113
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:36,670
probabilistically that is think in terms
of probabilities that it is a skill it's

2114
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:36,680
of probabilities that it is a skill it's
 

2115
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,190
of probabilities that it is a skill it's
a hard skill and everybody thinks they

2116
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:39,200
a hard skill and everybody thinks they
 

2117
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,510
a hard skill and everybody thinks they
know it so I see doctors thinking their

2118
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:41,520
know it so I see doctors thinking their
 

2119
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,109
know it so I see doctors thinking their
statisticians and giving whole analyses

2120
00:43:44,109 --> 00:43:44,119
statisticians and giving whole analyses
 

2121
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:45,790
statisticians and giving whole analyses
of the data on covid and they don't have

2122
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:45,800
of the data on covid and they don't have
 

2123
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,030
of the data on covid and they don't have
a clue what they're talking about not

2124
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:47,040
a clue what they're talking about not
 

2125
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,710
a clue what they're talking about not
because they're not good doctors because

2126
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:48,720
because they're not good doctors because
 

2127
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,910
because they're not good doctors because
they're not good statisticians it's not

2128
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:50,920
they're not good statisticians it's not
 

2129
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,030
they're not good statisticians it's not
e you know people think that they have

2130
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:53,040
e you know people think that they have
 

2131
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,549
e you know people think that they have
one skill and therefore it translates

2132
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:54,559
one skill and therefore it translates
 

2133
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:56,230
one skill and therefore it translates
immediately into another skill and and

2134
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:56,240
immediately into another skill and and
 

2135
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,790
immediately into another skill and and
it's just not true

2136
00:43:57,790 --> 00:43:57,800
it's just not true
 

2137
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,910
it's just not true
um so I've been astounded at how how bad

2138
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:00,920
um so I've been astounded at how how bad
 

2139
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,470
um so I've been astounded at how how bad
people are at

2140
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:02,480
people are at
 

2141
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,349
people are at
that for people who haven't read any of

2142
00:44:05,349 --> 00:44:05,359
that for people who haven't read any of
 

2143
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:08,190
that for people who haven't read any of
the books that we were just

2144
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:08,200
the books that we were just
 

2145
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,470
the books that we were just
discussing what would you

2146
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:10,480
discussing what would you
 

2147
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,790
discussing what would you
recommend what book would you recommend

2148
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:12,800
recommend what book would you recommend
 

2149
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,150
recommend what book would you recommend
they read and maybe also just elaborate

2150
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:17,160
they read and maybe also just elaborate
 

2151
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,109
they read and maybe also just elaborate
what

2152
00:44:18,109 --> 00:44:18,119
what
 

2153
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:21,230
what
mindset should they enter the reading of

2154
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:21,240
mindset should they enter the reading of
 

2155
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:24,390
mindset should they enter the reading of
that book with so I would recommend

2156
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:24,400
that book with so I would recommend
 

2157
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,190
that book with so I would recommend
everybody read Fountain Head and Aly

2158
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:26,200
everybody read Fountain Head and Aly
 

2159
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,510
everybody read Fountain Head and Aly
shrug and in what order so it would

2160
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:29,520
shrug and in what order so it would
 

2161
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,549
shrug and in what order so it would
depend on on where you are in life right

2162
00:44:32,549 --> 00:44:32,559
depend on on where you are in life right
 

2163
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:34,910
depend on on where you are in life right
so it it depends on who you are and what

2164
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:34,920
so it it depends on who you are and what
 

2165
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,190
so it it depends on who you are and what
you are so found head is a more personal

2166
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:37,200
you are so found head is a more personal
 

2167
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,190
you are so found head is a more personal
story for many people it's their

2168
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:39,200
story for many people it's their
 

2169
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,549
story for many people it's their
favorite and for many people it was

2170
00:44:40,549 --> 00:44:40,559
favorite and for many people it was
 

2171
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:42,710
favorite and for many people it was
their first book and and they wouldn't

2172
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:42,720
their first book and and they wouldn't
 

2173
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:49,270
their first book and and they wouldn't
replace that right um if Al shrug is a

2174
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:49,280
replace that right um if Al shrug is a
 

2175
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,510
replace that right um if Al shrug is a
it's about the world right it's about

2176
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:52,520
it's about the world right it's about
 

2177
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,950
it's about the world right it's about

thing people say about nature well
that's just something you do when you're

2334
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:05,680
that's just something you do when you're
 

2335
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,109
that's just something you do when you're
in college and you take an intro to

2336
00:48:08,109 --> 00:48:08,119
in college and you take an intro to

2345
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:23,109
in in my own private little circles and
so on maybe one question I just want to

2346
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:23,119
so on maybe one question I just want to
 

2347
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:24,349
so on maybe one question I just want to
ask

2348
00:48:24,349 --> 00:48:24,359
ask
 

2349
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:27,910
ask
is why is there such opposition to iron

2350
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:27,920
is why is there such opposition to iron
 

2351
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,950
is why is there such opposition to iron
Rand and maybe another way to ask the

2352
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:29,960
Rand and maybe another way to ask the
 

2353
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,470
Rand and maybe another way to ask the
same thing is what's misunderstood about

2354
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:33,480
same thing is what's misunderstood about
 

2355
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,270
same thing is what's misunderstood about
iron

2356
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:34,280
iron
 

2357
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,910
iron
Rand so we haven't talked about the

2358
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:36,920
Rand so we haven't talked about the
 

2359
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,470
Rand so we haven't talked about the
philosophy so it's harder to answer

2360
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:38,480
philosophy so it's harder to answer
 

2361
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,950
philosophy so it's harder to answer
right now we can return to it if you

2362
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:39,960
right now we can return to it if you
 

2363
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,510
right now we can return to it if you
think that's the right way to go well

2364
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:41,520
think that's the right way to go well
 

2365
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,390
think that's the right way to go well
let me let me give a broad answer and

2366
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:43,400
let me let me give a broad answer and
 

2367
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,710
let me let me give a broad answer and
then and then and then we'll do the

2368
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:44,720
then and then and then we'll do the
 

2369
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:45,910
then and then and then we'll do the
philosophy and then we'll return to it

2370
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:45,920
philosophy and then we'll return to it
 

2371
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,390
philosophy and then we'll return to it
because I think it's important to know

2372
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:47,400
because I think it's important to know
 

2373
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,549

00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:02,720
suffered because that's part of how it
 

2645
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,950
suffered because that's part of how it
works yeah there's uh this happens in

2646
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:04,960
works yeah there's uh this happens in
 

2647
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,630
works yeah there's uh this happens in
artificial intelligence this happens

2648
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:06,640
artificial intelligence this happens
 

2649
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:09,190
artificial intelligence this happens
when like a young person shows up and

2650
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:09,200
when like a young person shows up and
 

2651
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,789
when like a young person shows up and
with like fire in their eyes and they

2652
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:10,799
with like fire in their eyes and they
 

2653
00:54:10,799 --> 00:54:13,670
with like fire in their eyes and they
say I want to understand the nature of

2654
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:13,680
say I want to understand the nature of
 

2655
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,870
say I want to understand the nature of
intelligence and everybody rolls their

2656
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:16,880
intelligence and everybody rolls their
 

2657
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,270
intelligence and everybody rolls their
eyes be well for these same reasons

2658
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:20,280
eyes be well for these same reasons
 

2659
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,950
eyes be well for these same reasons
because they've spent so many years on

2660
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:21,960
because they've spent so many years on
 

2661
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,630
because they've spent so many years on
the very specific set of questions that

2662
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:25,640
the very specific set of questions that
 

2663
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:26,910
the very specific set of questions that
um

2664
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:26,920
um
 

2665
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:29,190
um
that kind of they compete over and they

2666
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:29,200
that kind of they compete over and they
 

2667
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,390
that kind of they compete over and they
write papers over and they have

2668
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:30,400
write papers over and they have
 

2669
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,829
write papers over and they have
conferences about and it's true those

2670
00:54:32,829 --> 00:54:32,839
conferences about and it's true those
 

2671
00:54:32,839 --> 00:54:34,470
conferences about and it's true those
that incremental research is the way you

2672
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:34,480
that incremental research is the way you
 

2673
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,190
that incremental research is the way you
make progress answering the question of

2674
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:36,200
make progress answering the question of
 

2675
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,950
make progress answering the question of
what is intelligence exceptionally

2676
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:37,960
what is intelligence exceptionally
 

2677
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:41,349
what is intelligence exceptionally
difficult but when you mock it you

2678
00:54:41,349 --> 00:54:41,359
difficult but when you mock it you
 

2679
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:45,349
difficult but when you mock it you
actually destroy the the reality when

2680
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:45,359
actually destroy the the reality when
 

2681
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:47,950
actually destroy the the reality when
when we look like centuries from now

2682
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:47,960
when we look like centuries from now
 

2683
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,870
when we look like centuries from now
look back at this time for this

2684
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:49,880
look back at this time for this
 

2685
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:51,549
look back at this time for this
particular field of artificial

2686
00:54:51,549 --> 00:54:51,559
particular field of artificial
 

2687
00:54:51,559 --> 00:54:54,430
particular field of artificial
intelligence it will be the people who

2688
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:54,440
intelligence it will be the people who
 

2689
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,069
intelligence it will be the people who
will be remembered will be the people

2690
00:54:56,069 --> 00:54:56,079
will be remembered will be the people
 

2691
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:58,710
will be remembered will be the people
who asked the question and made it their

2692
00:54:58,710 --> 00:54:58,720
who asked the question and made it their
 

2693
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,789
who asked the question and made it their
life journey of what is intelligence and

2694
00:55:01,789 --> 00:55:01,799
life journey of what is intelligence and
 

2695
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:04,990
life journey of what is intelligence and
actually had the chance to succeed most

2696
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:05,000
actually had the chance to succeed most
 

2697
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,910
actually had the chance to succeed most
will fail asking that question but the

2698
00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:06,920
will fail asking that question but the
 

2699
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,510
will fail asking that question but the
ones that like had a chance of

2700
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:08,520
ones that like had a chance of
 

2701
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,950
ones that like had a chance of
succeeding and had that throughout their

2702
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:10,960
succeeding and had that throughout their
 

2703
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,789
succeeding and had that throughout their
whole life uh and I suppose the same is

2704
00:55:13,789 --> 00:55:13,799
whole life uh and I suppose the same is
 

2705
00:55:13,799 --> 00:55:16,030
whole life uh and I suppose the same is
true for philosophy it's in every field

2706
00:55:16,030 --> 00:55:16,040
true for philosophy it's in every field
 

2707
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,710
true for philosophy it's in every field
it's it's it's asking the big questions

2708
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:18,720
it's it's it's asking the big questions
 

2709
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,829
it's it's it's asking the big questions
and staying curious and staying

2710
00:55:20,829 --> 00:55:20,839
and staying curious and staying
 

2711
00:55:20,839 --> 00:55:24,190
and staying curious and staying
passionate and staying excited and

2712
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:24,200
passionate and staying excited and
 

2713
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,630
passionate and staying excited and
accepting failure right accept accepting

2714
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:26,640
accepting failure right accept accepting
 

2715
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,630
accepting failure right accept accepting
that you're not going to get it first

2716
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:27,640
that you're not going to get it first
 

2717
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:28,910
that you're not going to get it first
time you're not going to get the whole

2718
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:28,920
time you're not going to get the whole
 

2719
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,910
time you're not going to get the whole
thing but and and sometimes you have to

2720
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:30,920
thing but and and sometimes you have to
 

2721
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,510
thing but and and sometimes you have to
do the minua work and I'm not here to

2722
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:32,520
do the minua work and I'm not here to
 

2723
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,349
do the minua work and I'm not here to
say nobody should specialize or you

2724
00:55:34,349 --> 00:55:34,359
say nobody should specialize or you
 

2725
00:55:34,359 --> 00:55:35,829
say nobody should specialize or you
shouldn't do the Manos you have to do

2726
00:55:35,829 --> 00:55:35,839
shouldn't do the Manos you have to do
 

2727
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:38,230
shouldn't do the Manos you have to do
that but there has to be a way to do

2728
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:38,240
that but there has to be a way to do
 

2729
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,230
that but there has to be a way to do
that work and keep the passion and keep

2730
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:40,240
that work and keep the passion and keep
 

2731
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,029
that work and keep the passion and keep
and keep it all integrated that's

2732
00:55:42,029 --> 00:55:42,039
and keep it all integrated that's
 

2733
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:43,670
and keep it all integrated that's
another thing I mean we don't live in a

2734
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:43,680
another thing I mean we don't live in a
 

2735
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,870
another thing I mean we don't live in a
culture that integrates right we live in

2736
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:46,880
culture that integrates right we live in
 

2737
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,670
culture that integrates right we live in
a culture that is all that is all about

2738
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:49,680
a culture that is all that is all about
 

2739
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,029
a culture that is all that is all about
you know this minutia and not and and

2740
00:55:52,029 --> 00:55:52,039
you know this minutia and not and and
 

2741
00:55:52,039 --> 00:55:53,630
you know this minutia and not and and
you know medicine is another field where

2742
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:53,640
you know medicine is another field where
 

2743
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,470
you know medicine is another field where
you you specialize in the kidney I mean

2744
00:55:55,470 --> 00:55:55,480
you you specialize in the kidney I mean
 

2745
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:56,950
you you specialize in the kidney I mean
the kidney is connected other things

2746
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:56,960
the kidney is connected other things
 

2747
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,829
the kidney is connected other things
you've got to and we don't have a

2748
00:55:58,829 --> 00:55:58,839
you've got to and we don't have a
 

2749
00:55:58,839 --> 00:56:00,510
you've got to and we don't have a
holistic view of these things and I'm

2750
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:00,520
holistic view of these things and I'm
 

2751
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,309
holistic view of these things and I'm
sure in artificial intelligence you're

2752
00:56:02,309 --> 00:56:02,319
sure in artificial intelligence you're
 

2753
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:04,990
sure in artificial intelligence you're
not going to make the big leaps forward

2754
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:05,000
not going to make the big leaps forward
 

2755
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,870
not going to make the big leaps forward
without a holistic view of what it is

2756
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:07,880
without a holistic view of what it is
 

2757
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,190
without a holistic view of what it is
you're trying to achieve and maybe

2758
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:09,200
you're trying to achieve and maybe
 

2759
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,670
you're trying to achieve and maybe
that's the question what is intelligence

2760
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:10,680
that's the question what is intelligence
 

2761
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:13,069
that's the question what is intelligence
but that's the kind of questions you

2762
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:13,079
but that's the kind of questions you
 

2763
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:16,109
but that's the kind of questions you
have to ask to make big leaps forward to

2764
00:56:16,109 --> 00:56:16,119
have to ask to make big leaps forward to
 

2765
00:56:16,119 --> 00:56:18,309
have to ask to make big leaps forward to
really move the field in in a in a

2766
00:56:18,309 --> 00:56:18,319
really move the field in in a in a
 

2767
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:20,029
really move the field in in a in a
positive direction and it's the people

2768
00:56:20,029 --> 00:56:20,039
positive direction and it's the people
 

2769
00:56:20,039 --> 00:56:23,069
positive direction and it's the people
who can think that way who move fields

2770
00:56:23,069 --> 00:56:23,079
who can think that way who move fields
 

2771
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:25,630
who can think that way who move fields
and move technology who move ev anything

2772
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:25,640
and move technology who move ev anything
 

2773
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,390
and move technology who move ev anything
anything is is is everything is like

2774
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:27,400
anything is is is everything is like
 

2775
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,910
anything is is is everything is like
which just like you said is painful

2776
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:28,920
which just like you said is painful
 

2777
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,349
which just like you said is painful
because underlying that kind of

2778
00:56:31,349 --> 00:56:31,359
because underlying that kind of
 

2779
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:33,630
because underlying that kind of
questioning is well maybe the work I've

2780
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:33,640
questioning is well maybe the work I've
 

2781
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:37,750
questioning is well maybe the work I've
done for the past 20 years was um was a

2782
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:37,760
done for the past 20 years was um was a
 

2783
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,829
done for the past 20 years was um was a
dead end and you have to kind of face

2784
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:39,839
dead end and you have to kind of face
 

2785
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:42,270
dead end and you have to kind of face
that even just it might not be true but

2786
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:42,280
that even just it might not be true but
 

2787
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:45,589
that even just it might not be true but
even just facing that reality yes is is

2788
00:56:45,589 --> 00:56:45,599
even just facing that reality yes is is
 

2789
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,789
even just facing that reality yes is is
just it's a it's a painful feeling

2790
00:56:47,789 --> 00:56:47,799
just it's a it's a painful feeling
 

2791
00:56:47,799 --> 00:56:50,190
just it's a it's a painful feeling
absolutely but but it's that's part of

2792
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:50,200
absolutely but but it's that's part of
 

2793
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,349
absolutely but but it's that's part of
the reason why it's important to enjoy

2794
00:56:51,349 --> 00:56:51,359
the reason why it's important to enjoy
 

2795
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,510
the reason why it's important to enjoy
the work that you do right so that even

2796
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:53,520
the work that you do right so that even
 

2797
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,750
the work that you do right so that even
if it doesn't completely worked out at

2798

is uniquely human um uh we don't we
 

3299
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:31,109
is uniquely human um uh we don't we
don't know the truth from

3309
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,349
ourselves but our emotions are not tools
of cognition they don't tell us the

3310
01:07:43,349 --> 01:07:43,359
of cognition they don't tell us the

01:07:52,029 --> 01:07:52,039
of knowledge and therefore me reason is
 

3317
01:07:52,039 --> 01:07:53,230
of knowledge and therefore me reason is
our means of

01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:53,240
our means of
 

3319
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:56,430
our means of
survival only individuals reason just in

01:07:56,430 --> 01:07:56,440
survival only individuals reason just in
 

3321

01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:55,629
this the the the what it means to hold
Concepts and what it means to discover

3896
01:19:55,629 --> 01:19:55,639
Concepts and what it means to discover
 

3897
01:19:55,639 --> 01:19:59,270
Concepts and what it means to discover
new discoveries and to

3898
01:19:59,270 --> 01:19:59,280

 

3899
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:02,189

use to use Concepts and how we use

3900
01:20:02,189 --> 01:20:02,199
use to use Concepts and how we use
 

3901
01:20:02,199 --> 01:20:04,990
use to use Concepts and how we use
Concepts and she has a theory of

3902
01:20:04,990 --> 01:20:05,000
Concepts and she has a theory of
 

3903
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:09,430
Concepts and she has a theory of
Concepts that is completely new that is

3904
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:09,440
Concepts that is completely new that is
 

3905
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:11,910
Concepts that is completely new that is
completely revolutionary and I think is

3906
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:11,920
completely revolutionary and I think is
 

3907
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:14,270
completely revolutionary and I think is
essential for the philosophy of science

3908
01:20:14,270 --> 01:20:14,280
essential for the philosophy of science
 

3909
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:16,430
essential for the philosophy of science
and therefore ultimately for the more

3910
01:20:16,430 --> 01:20:16,440
and therefore ultimately for the more
 

3911
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:19,070
and therefore ultimately for the more
abstract we get with scientific

3912
01:20:19,070 --> 01:20:19,080
abstract we get with scientific
 

3913
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:22,070

discoveries the easy it is to detach

3914
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:22,080
discoveries the easy it is to detach
 

3915
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,070
discoveries the easy it is to detach
them from reality and to detach them

3916
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:24,080
them from reality and to detach them
 

3917
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,350
them from reality and to detach them
from truth

3918
01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:25,360
from truth
 

3919
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:27,950
from truth
the easier it is to be inside our heads

3920
01:20:27,950 --> 01:20:27,960
the easier it is to be inside our heads
 

3921
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:30,350
the easier it is to be inside our heads
instead of about what's

3922
01:20:30,350 --> 01:20:30,360
instead of about what's
 

3923
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:32,550
instead of about what's
real and they're probably examples from

3924
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:32,560
real and they're probably examples from
 

3925
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:36,189
real and they're probably examples from
monop physics that fit that and I think

3926
01:20:36,189 --> 01:20:36,199
monop physics that fit that and I think
 

3927
01:20:36,199 --> 01:20:38,350
monop physics that fit that and I think
what she teaches in the book is how to

3928
01:20:38,350 --> 01:20:38,360
what she teaches in the book is how to
 

3929
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:40,430
what she teaches in the book is how to
ground your Concepts and how to bring

3930
01:20:40,430 --> 01:20:40,440
ground your Concepts and how to bring
 

3931
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:42,910
ground your Concepts and how to bring
them into grounding in reality so

3932
01:20:42,910 --> 01:20:42,920
them into grounding in reality so
 

3933
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:44,510
them into grounding in reality so
introduction to objectivist epistemology

3934
01:20:44,510 --> 01:20:44,520
introduction to objectivist epistemology
 

3935
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:46,470
introduction to objectivist epistemology
and note that it's only an introduction

3936
01:20:46,470 --> 01:20:46,480
and note that it's only an introduction
 

3937
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:47,990
and note that it's only an introduction
because one of the things she realized

3938
01:20:47,990 --> 01:20:48,000
because one of the things she realized
 

3939
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,270
because one of the things she realized
one of the things that I think a lot of

3940
01:20:49,270 --> 01:20:49,280
one of the things that I think a lot of
 

3941
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:51,990
one of the things that I think a lot of
her critics don't give enough credit for

3942
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:52,000
her critics don't give enough credit for
 

3943
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,470
her critics don't give enough credit for
is that philosophy is there's no no end

3944
01:20:55,470 --> 01:20:55,480
is that philosophy is there's no no end
 

3945
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:57,470
is that philosophy is there's no no end
right it's always growing there always

01:20:57,470 --> 01:20:57,480
right it's always growing there always
 

3947
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:59,229
right it's always growing there always
new discoveries there's always it's you

3948
01:20:59,229 --> 01:20:59,239
new discoveries there's always it's you
 

3949
01:20:59,239 --> 01:21:00,709
new discoveries there's always it's you
know it's like science there's always

3950
01:21:00,709 --> 01:21:00,719
know it's like science there's always
 

3951
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:03,470
know it's like science there's always
new things and and there's a ton of work

3952
01:21:03,470 --> 01:21:03,480
new things and and there's a ton of work
 

3953
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:06,189
new things and and there's a ton of work
to do in in

3954
01:21:06,189 --> 01:21:06,199
to do in in
 

3955
01:21:06,199 --> 01:21:08,149
to do in in
philosophy uh and particularly in

3956
01:21:08,149 --> 01:21:08,159
philosophy uh and particularly in
 

3957
01:21:08,159 --> 01:21:09,910
philosophy uh and particularly in
epistemology and Theology and she was

3958
01:21:09,910 --> 01:21:09,920
epistemology and Theology and she was
 

3959
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:11,629
epistemology and Theology and she was
actually giving you interest in

3960
01:21:11,629 --> 01:21:11,639
actually giving you interest in
 

3961
01:21:11,639 --> 01:21:14,669
actually giving you interest in
mathematics she was she actually saw a

3962
01:21:14,669 --> 01:21:14,679
mathematics she was she actually saw a
 

3963
01:21:14,679 --> 01:21:17,070
mathematics she was she actually saw a
lot of parallels between math and

3964
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:17,080
lot of parallels between math and
 

3965
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:18,470
lot of parallels between math and
concept

3966

formation and she was actually you know

3968
01:21:21,629 --> 01:21:21,639
formation and she was actually you know
 

3969
01:21:21,639 --> 01:21:23,910
formation and she was actually you know
in the years before she died she was

3970
01:21:23,910 --> 01:21:23,920
in the years before she died she was
 

3971
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:26,189
in the years before she died she was
taking private lessons in mathematics in

3972
01:21:26,189 --> 01:21:26,199
taking private lessons in mathematics in
 

3973
01:21:26,199 --> 01:21:29,350
taking private lessons in mathematics in
algebra and calculus because she

3974
01:21:29,350 --> 01:21:29,360
algebra and calculus because she
 

3975
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:31,669
algebra and calculus because she
believed that there was real insight in

3976
01:21:31,669 --> 01:21:31,679
believed that there was real insight in
 

3977
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:34,870
believed that there was real insight in
understanding algebra in calculus

3978
01:21:34,870 --> 01:21:34,880
understanding algebra in calculus
 

3979
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:38,470
understanding algebra in calculus
to um philosophy into

3980
01:21:38,470 --> 01:21:38,480
to um philosophy into
 

3981
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:41,550
to um philosophy into
epistemology and and she also was very

3982
01:21:41,550 --> 01:21:41,560
epistemology and and she also was very
 

3983
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:42,990
epistemology and and she also was very
interested in Neuroscience because she

3984
01:21:42,990 --> 01:21:43,000
interested in Neuroscience because she
 

3985
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,390
interested in Neuroscience because she
believed that that had a lot to tell us

3986
01:21:45,390 --> 01:21:45,400
believed that that had a lot to tell us
 

3987
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:48,790
believed that that had a lot to tell us
about epistemology but also about music

3988
01:21:48,790 --> 01:21:48,800
about epistemology but also about music
 

3989
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:53,270
about epistemology but also about music
therefore about Aesthetics so I mean she

3990
01:21:53,270 --> 01:21:53,280
therefore about Aesthetics so I mean she
 

3991
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:55,990
therefore about Aesthetics so I mean she
recognized the importance of all these

3992
01:21:55,990 --> 01:21:56,000
recognized the importance of all these
 

3993
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,750
recognized the importance of all these
different fields and how and and the

3994
01:21:57,750 --> 01:21:57,760
different fields and how and and the
 

3995
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,430
different fields and how and and the
beauty of philosophy is it should be

3996
01:21:59,430 --> 01:21:59,440
beauty of philosophy is it should be
 

3997
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:01,229
beauty of philosophy is it should be
integrating all of them and one of the

3998
01:22:01,229 --> 01:22:01,239
integrating all of them and one of the
 

3999
01:22:01,239 --> 01:22:02,430
integrating all of them and one of the
sad things about the world in which we

4000
01:22:02,430 --> 01:22:02,440
sad things about the world in which we
 

4001
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:04,470
sad things about the world in which we
live is again we view these things as

4002
01:22:04,470 --> 01:22:04,480
live is again we view these things as
 

4003
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,870
live is again we view these things as
silos we don't view them as integrating

4004
01:22:06,870 --> 01:22:06,880
silos we don't view them as integrating
 

4005
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:09,350
silos we don't view them as integrating
we don't have teams of people from

4006
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:09,360
we don't have teams of people from
 

4007
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,229
we don't have teams of people from
different Arena you know different

we become like ants specialized so she

4012
01:22:17,910 --> 01:22:17,920
we become like ants specialized so she
 

4013
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:21,110
we become like ants specialized so she
was definitely uh like that and she was

4014
01:22:21,110 --> 01:22:21,120
was definitely uh like that and she was
 

4015
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:23,270
was definitely uh like that and she was
constantly curious constantly interested

4016
01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:23,280
constantly curious constantly interested
 

4017
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:25,990
constantly curious constantly interested
in in the in discoveries and new ideas

4018
01:22:25,990 --> 01:22:26,000
in in the in discoveries and new ideas
 

4019
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,590
in in the in discoveries and new ideas
and and how this could expand the scope

4020
01:22:29,590 --> 01:22:29,600
and and how this could expand the scope
 

4021
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,270
and and how this could expand the scope
of her philosophy and the application of

4022
01:22:31,270 --> 01:22:31,280
of her philosophy and the application of
 

4023
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,070
of her philosophy and the application of
her philosophy there's like a million

4024
01:22:33,070 --> 01:22:33,080
her philosophy there's like a million
 

4025
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:34,350
her philosophy there's like a million
topics I can talk to you but since you

4026
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:34,360
topics I can talk to you but since you
 

4027
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:36,229
topics I can talk to you but since you
mentioned math I'm almost only got three

4028
01:22:36,229 --> 01:22:36,239
mentioned math I'm almost only got three
 

4029
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:40,830
mentioned math I'm almost only got three
hours only I'm almost curious uh I don't

4030
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:40,840
hours only I'm almost curious uh I don't
 

4031

hours only I'm almost curious uh I don't
know if you're familiar with Gay's

4032
01:22:42,470 --> 01:22:42,480
know if you're familiar with Gay's
 

4033
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:44,510
know if you're familiar with Gay's
incompleteness theorem I'm not

01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:47,510
incompleteness theorem I'm not
unfortunately okay it was a a

01:22:47,510 --> 01:22:47,520
unfortunately okay it was a a
 

4037
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:50,629
unfortunately okay it was a a
powerful proof that any axiomatic

axioms that there will in that system
 

4043
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:01,189
axioms that there will in that system
provably must be an inconsistency so

provably must be an inconsistency so
 

4045
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:04,830
provably must be an inconsistency so
that was this painful like stab in the

01:23:04,830 --> 01:23:04,840
that was this painful like stab in the
 

4047
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:08,030
that was this painful like stab in the
idea of mathematics that no if we start

4048
01:23:08,030 --> 01:23:08,040
idea of mathematics that no if we start
 

4049
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:10,270
idea of mathematics that no if we start
with a set of assumptions kind of like

4050
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:10,280
with a set of assumptions kind of like
 

4051
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:14,030
with a set of assumptions kind of like
an started with objectivism Y there will

4052
01:23:14,030 --> 01:23:14,040
an started with objectivism Y there will
 

4053
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:16,709
an started with objectivism Y there will
have to be at least one

4054
01:23:16,709 --> 01:23:16,719
have to be at least one
 

4055
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:19,149
have to be at least one
contradiction see I I intuitively I'm

4056
01:23:19,149 --> 01:23:19,159
contradiction see I I intuitively I'm
 

4057
01:23:19,159 --> 01:23:21,070
contradiction see I I intuitively I'm
going to say that's false

4058
01:23:21,070 --> 01:23:21,080
going to say that's false
 

4059
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:24,709
going to say that's false
philosophically but in math it's just

4060
01:23:24,709 --> 01:23:24,719
philosophically but in math it's just
 

4061
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:27,310
philosophically but in math it's just
true and it's it's a question about how

4062
01:23:27,310 --> 01:23:27,320
true and it's it's a question about how
 

4063
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:30,149
true and it's it's a question about how
you define again the definitions matter

4064
01:23:30,149 --> 01:23:30,159
you define again the definitions matter
 

4065
01:23:30,159 --> 01:23:31,390
you define again the definitions matter
and you have to be careful on how you

4066
01:23:31,390 --> 01:23:31,400
and you have to be careful on how you
 

4067
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:34,030
and you have to be careful on how you
define axioms and you have to be careful

4068
01:23:34,030 --> 01:23:34,040
define axioms and you have to be careful
 

4069
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:35,070
define axioms and you have to be careful
about what you define as an

4070
01:23:35,070 --> 01:23:35,080
about what you define as an
 

4071
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:37,229
about what you define as an
inconsistency and what that means to say

4072
01:23:37,229 --> 01:23:37,239
inconsistency and what that means to say
 

4073
01:23:37,239 --> 01:23:39,030
inconsistency and what that means to say
there's an inconsistency and I don't

4074
01:23:39,030 --> 01:23:39,040
there's an inconsistency and I don't
 

4075
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:40,189
there's an inconsistency and I don't
know I'm not going to say more than that

4076
01:23:40,189 --> 01:23:40,199
know I'm not going to say more than that
 

4077
01:23:40,199 --> 01:23:43,310
know I'm not going to say more than that
because I don't know but I'm

4078
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:43,320
because I don't know but I'm
 

4079
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:46,430
because I don't know but I'm
suspicious that there is some uh and

4080
01:23:46,430 --> 01:23:46,440
suspicious that there is some uh and
 

4081
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:47,990
suspicious that there is some uh and
this is the power philosophy and this is

4082
01:23:47,990 --> 01:23:48,000
this is the power philosophy and this is
 

4083
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,870
this is the power philosophy and this is
why I said before concept formation is

4084
01:23:49,870 --> 01:23:49,880
why I said before concept formation is
 

4085
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:51,629
why I said before concept formation is
so important and understanding concept

4086
01:23:51,629 --> 01:23:51,639
so important and understanding concept
 

4087
01:23:51,639 --> 01:23:53,110
so important and understanding concept
formation is so important from for

4088
01:23:53,110 --> 01:23:53,120
formation is so important from for
 

4089
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,390
formation is so important from for
particularly again mathematics because

4090
01:23:54,390 --> 01:23:54,400
particularly again mathematics because
 

4091
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,229
particularly again mathematics because
it's such an abstract field and it's so

4092
01:23:56,229 --> 01:23:56,239
it's such an abstract field and it's so
 

4093
01:23:56,239 --> 01:24:00,590
it's such an abstract field and it's so
easy to lose grounding in in reality

4094
01:24:00,590 --> 01:24:00,600
easy to lose grounding in in reality
 

4095
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:03,550
easy to lose grounding in in reality
that that if you properly Define axioms

4096
01:24:03,550 --> 01:24:03,560
that that if you properly Define axioms
 

4097
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:04,790
that that if you properly Define axioms
and you properly Define what you're

4098
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:04,800
and you properly Define what you're
 

4099
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,910
and you properly Define what you're
doing in math whether that is true and I

4100
01:24:06,910 --> 01:24:06,920
doing in math whether that is true and I
 

4101
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:09,149
doing in math whether that is true and I
I don't think it is this is uh yeah

4102
01:24:09,149 --> 01:24:09,159
I don't think it is this is uh yeah
 

4103
01:24:09,159 --> 01:24:11,790
I don't think it is this is uh yeah
we'll leave it as an open mystery cuz

4104
01:24:11,790 --> 01:24:11,800
we'll leave it as an open mystery cuz
 

4105
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:13,310
we'll leave it as an open mystery cuz
actually this

4106
01:24:13,310 --> 01:24:13,320
actually this
 

4107
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:16,110
actually this
audience you know there's literally over

4108
01:24:16,110 --> 01:24:16,120
audience you know there's literally over
 

4109
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:19,350
audience you know there's literally over
100,000 people that have PG and so they

4110
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:19,360
100,000 people that have PG and so they
 

4111
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:21,990
100,000 people that have PG and so they
they know G's the complet theorem I I I

4112
01:24:21,990 --> 01:24:22,000
they know G's the complet theorem I I I
 

4113
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,390
they know G's the complet theorem I I I
have this intuition that there's

4114
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:24,400
have this intuition that there's
 

4115
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,229
have this intuition that there's
something different to mathematics and

4116
01:24:26,229 --> 01:24:26,239
something different to mathematics and
 

4117
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:28,390
something different to mathematics and
philosophy that I'd love to hear from

4118
01:24:28,390 --> 01:24:28,400
philosophy that I'd love to hear from
 

4119
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:30,510
philosophy that I'd love to hear from
people like what what exactly is that

4120
01:24:30,510 --> 01:24:30,520
people like what what exactly is that
 

4121
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:33,990
people like what what exactly is that
difference because um there's a

4122
01:24:33,990 --> 01:24:34,000
difference because um there's a
 

4123
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,390
difference because um there's a
Precision to mathematics that philosophy

4124
01:24:37,390 --> 01:24:37,400
Precision to mathematics that philosophy
 

4125
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:41,390
Precision to mathematics that philosophy
doesn't have but that Precision gets you

4126
01:24:41,390 --> 01:24:41,400
doesn't have but that Precision gets you
 

4127
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:44,550
doesn't have but that Precision gets you
in trouble it somehow it actually takes

4128
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:44,560
in trouble it somehow it actually takes
 

4129
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:47,750
in trouble it somehow it actually takes
you away from truth like the the very

4130
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:47,760
you away from truth like the the very
 

4131
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:50,590
you away from truth like the the very
constraint of the language used in

4132
01:24:50,590 --> 01:24:50,600
constraint of the language used in
 

4133
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:53,310
constraint of the language used in
mathematics actually puts a constraint

4134
01:24:53,310 --> 01:24:53,320
mathematics actually puts a constraint
 

4135
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:55,430
mathematics actually puts a constraint
on the on the capture of truth that it's

4136
01:24:55,430 --> 01:24:55,440
on the on the capture of truth that it's
 

4137
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,270
on the on the capture of truth that it's
able to do so I'm going to argue that

4138
01:24:57,270 --> 01:24:57,280
able to do so I'm going to argue that
 

4139
01:24:57,280 --> 01:25:00,950
able to do so I'm going to argue that
that is a comp a total product of the

4140
01:25:00,950 --> 01:25:00,960
that is a comp a total product of the
 

4141
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:02,109
that is a comp a total product of the
way you're

4142
01:25:02,109 --> 01:25:02,119
way you're
 

4143
01:25:02,119 --> 01:25:04,790
way you're
conceptualizing the the terms within

4144
01:25:04,790 --> 01:25:04,800
conceptualizing the the terms within
 

4145
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:08,229
conceptualizing the the terms within
mathematics it's not in reality yes so

4146
01:25:08,229 --> 01:25:08,239
mathematics it's not in reality yes so
 

4147
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:10,430
mathematics it's not in reality yes so
it's you would argue it's in the fact

4148
01:25:10,430 --> 01:25:10,440
it's you would argue it's in the fact
 

4149
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:12,590
it's you would argue it's in the fact
that mathematics in in as much as is

4150
01:25:12,590 --> 01:25:12,600
that mathematics in in as much as is
 

4151
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:14,310
that mathematics in in as much as is
detached from reality that you can do

4152
01:25:14,310 --> 01:25:14,320
detached from reality that you can do
 

4153
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,669
detached from reality that you can do
these kinds of things yes and and you

4154
01:25:16,669 --> 01:25:16,679
these kinds of things yes and and you
 

4155
01:25:16,679 --> 01:25:21,629
these kinds of things yes and and you
and you've and that mathematicians have

4156
01:25:21,629 --> 01:25:21,639
and you've and that mathematicians have
 

4157
01:25:21,639 --> 01:25:25,750
and you've and that mathematicians have
uh come up with Concepts

4158
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:25,760
uh come up with Concepts
 

4159
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:28,390
uh come up with Concepts
that they haven't grounded in reality

4160
01:25:28,390 --> 01:25:28,400
that they haven't grounded in reality
 

4161
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:31,030
that they haven't grounded in reality
properly that allows them to go off on

4162
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:31,040
properly that allows them to go off on
 

4163
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:33,350
properly that allows them to go off on
on in places that have that don't lead

4164
01:25:33,350 --> 01:25:33,360
on in places that have that don't lead
 

4165
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:34,669
on in places that have that don't lead
to truth that's right that don't lead to

4166
01:25:34,669 --> 01:25:34,679
to truth that's right that don't lead to
 

4167
01:25:34,679 --> 01:25:37,470
to truth that's right that don't lead to
truth but I encourage you then I

4168
01:25:37,470 --> 01:25:37,480
truth but I encourage you then I
 

4169
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:39,590
truth but I encourage you then I
encourage you to to to to do one of

4170
01:25:39,590 --> 01:25:39,600
encourage you to to to to do one of
 

4171
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,590
encourage you to to to to do one of
these uh podcast with one of our

4172
01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:41,600
these uh podcast with one of our
 

4173
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:44,590
these uh podcast with one of our
philosophers who know more about uh

4174
01:25:44,590 --> 01:25:44,600
philosophers who know more about uh
 

4175
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:46,709
philosophers who know more about uh
about this stuff um and if you if you

4176
01:25:46,709 --> 01:25:46,719
about this stuff um and if you if you
 

4177
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:48,109
about this stuff um and if you if you
move to Austin I've got somebody I'd

4178
01:25:48,109 --> 01:25:48,119
move to Austin I've got somebody I'd
 

4179
01:25:48,119 --> 01:25:50,430
move to Austin I've got somebody I'd
recommend to you and can you throw a

4180
01:25:50,430 --> 01:25:50,440
recommend to you and can you throw a
 

4181
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:52,149
recommend to you and can you throw a
name out or no yeah I mean I would I

4182
01:25:52,149 --> 01:25:52,159
name out or no yeah I mean I would I
 

4183
01:25:52,159 --> 01:25:54,629
name out or no yeah I mean I would I
would I would talk to GRE sary you say

4184
01:25:54,629 --> 01:25:54,639
would I would talk to GRE sary you say
 

4185
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:57,790
would I would talk to GRE sary you say
hour can you say what you mean by hour

4186
01:25:57,790 --> 01:25:57,800
hour can you say what you mean by hour
 

4187
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:00,070
hour can you say what you mean by hour
I'd say people who are affiliated with

4188
01:26:00,070 --> 01:26:00,080
I'd say people who are affiliated with
 

4189
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:02,430
I'd say people who are affiliated with
the adman Institute of philosophers were

4190
01:26:02,430 --> 01:26:02,440
the adman Institute of philosophers were
 

4191
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:04,950
the adman Institute of philosophers were
affiliated with objectivism right and

4192
01:26:04,950 --> 01:26:04,960
affiliated with objectivism right and
 

4193
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,910
affiliated with objectivism right and
Greg is one of our one of our brightest

4194
01:26:06,910 --> 01:26:06,920
Greg is one of our one of our brightest
 

4195
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:08,870
Greg is one of our one of our brightest
and and he's in Austin he's just got a

4196
01:26:08,870 --> 01:26:08,880
and and he's in Austin he's just got a
 

4197
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:11,870
and and he's in Austin he's just got a
position at at UT uh at the University

4198
01:26:11,870 --> 01:26:11,880
position at at UT uh at the University
 

4199
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:14,910
position at at UT uh at the University
of Texas uh and he and he one on Kate

4200
01:26:14,910 --> 01:26:14,920
of Texas uh and he and he one on Kate
 

4201

you want to help you under capitalism
 

4425
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:34,830
you want to help you under capitalism
are free to help it's just the only

4426
01:30:34,830 --> 01:30:34,840
are free to help it's just the only
 

4427
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:36,189
are free to help it's just the only
thing that doesn't happen under

4428
01:30:36,189 --> 01:30:36,199
thing that doesn't happen under
 

4429
01:30:36,199 --> 01:30:38,310
thing that doesn't happen under
capitalist is you don't get to impose

4430
01:30:38,310 --> 01:30:38,320
capitalist is you don't get to impose
 

4431
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:40,870
capitalist is you don't get to impose
your will on other people now how's that

4432
01:30:40,870 --> 01:30:40,880
your will on other people now how's that
 

4433
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:44,990
your will on other people now how's that
a bad thing so the the question then is

4434
01:30:44,990 --> 01:30:45,000
a bad thing so the the question then is
 

4435
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:49,149
a bad thing so the the question then is
how does uh the implementation of

4436
01:30:49,149 --> 01:30:49,159
how does uh the implementation of
 

4437
01:30:49,159 --> 01:30:53,669
how does uh the implementation of
capitalism uh deviate from its ideal mhm

4438
01:30:53,669 --> 01:30:53,679
capitalism uh deviate from its ideal mhm
 

4439
01:30:53,679 --> 01:30:55,950
capitalism uh deviate from its ideal mhm
in practice I mean this is what is the

4440
01:30:55,950 --> 01:30:55,960
in practice I mean this is what is the
 

4441
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:58,350
in practice I mean this is what is the
question with a lot of systems is how

4442
01:30:58,350 --> 01:30:58,360
question with a lot of systems is how
 

4443
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:01,990
question with a lot of systems is how
does it start to then fail so one thing

4444
01:31:01,990 --> 01:31:02,000
does it start to then fail so one thing
 

4445
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,270
does it start to then fail so one thing
maybe you can correct me or inform

4446
01:31:05,270 --> 01:31:05,280
maybe you can correct me or inform
 

4447
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:09,629
maybe you can correct me or inform
me it seems like information is very

4448
01:31:09,629 --> 01:31:09,639
me it seems like information is very
 

4449
01:31:09,639 --> 01:31:13,390
me it seems like information is very
important like being able to uh make

4450
01:31:13,390 --> 01:31:13,400
important like being able to uh make
 

4451
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:17,270
important like being able to uh make
decisions to be free you have to have

4452
01:31:17,270 --> 01:31:17,280
decisions to be free you have to have
 

4453
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:19,510
decisions to be free you have to have
access full access of all the

01:31:22,709 --> 01:31:22,719
information you need to make rational
 

4457
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:26,430
information you need to make rational
decisions no that can be because it can

4458
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:26,440
decisions no that can be because it can
 

4459
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:28,350
decisions no that can be because it can
be right because none of us has full

4460
01:31:28,350 --> 01:31:28,360
be right because none of us has full
 

4461
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:31,189
be right because none of us has full
access to all the information we need I

4462
01:31:31,189 --> 01:31:31,199

4465
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:34,990
mean what does that even mean and how
how big how how much of the scope do you

4466
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:35,000
how big how how much of the scope do you
 

4467
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,430
how big how how much of the scope do you
want to do right let's just start there

4468

4473
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:42,270

asymmetrical information the drug maker

4476
01:31:45,270 --> 01:31:45,280
asymmetrical information the drug maker
 

4477
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,830
asymmetrical information the drug maker
has more information about the drug than

4478
01:31:46,830 --> 01:31:46,840
has more information about the drug than
 

4479

the drug buyer right pharmaceutical
 

4481
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:54,270
the drug buyer right pharmaceutical
drugs um true it's a problem well I

4482
01:31:54,270 --> 01:31:54,280
drugs um true it's a problem well I
 

4483
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:55,830
drugs um true it's a problem well I
wonder if one can think about an

4484

wonder if one can think about an
 

4485
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:57,270
wonder if one can think about an
entrepreneur can think about how to

4486

entrepreneur can think about how to
 

4487
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:59,510
entrepreneur can think about how to
solve that problem see I view any one of

4488
01:31:59,510 --> 01:31:59,520
solve that problem see I view any one of
 

4489

solve that problem see I view any one of
these challenges to capitalism as an

4490
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:01,360
these challenges to capitalism as an
 

4491

these challenges to capitalism as an
opportunity for entrepreneur to make

4492

of these is the right one well it won't

4512
01:32:25,590 --> 01:32:25,600
of these is the right one well it won't
 

4513
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,270
of these is the right one well it won't
be you really getting the information

4514
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:27,280
be you really getting the information
 

4515
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:30,669
be you really getting the information
from them it'll be your doctor the

doctors need that
 

4519
01:32:32,119 --> 01:32:34,470
doctors need that
information so the doctor who has some

4520
01:32:34,470 --> 01:32:34,480
information so the doctor who has some
 

4521
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:37,109
information so the doctor who has some
expertise in medicine will be evaluating

4522
01:32:37,109 --> 01:32:37,119
expertise in medicine will be evaluating
 

4523
01:32:37,119 --> 01:32:39,910
expertise in medicine will be evaluating
which rating agency to use to evaluate

4524
01:32:39,910 --> 01:32:39,920
which rating agency to use to evaluate
 

4525
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:41,550
which rating agency to use to evaluate
the drugs and which ones then to

4526
01:32:41,550 --> 01:32:41,560
the drugs and which ones then to
 

4527
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:45,470
the drugs and which ones then to
recommend to you so do we need an FDA do

4528
01:32:45,470 --> 01:32:45,480
recommend to you so do we need an FDA do
 

4529
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:47,550
recommend to you so do we need an FDA do
we need a government that siphons all

we need a government that siphons all
 

4531
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:49,470
we need a government that siphons all
the information to One Source that does

4532
01:32:49,470 --> 01:32:49,480
the information to One Source that does
 

4533
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:51,550
the information to One Source that does
all the research all the thing and has a

01:32:53,390 --> 01:32:53,400
clear incentive by the way not to
 

4537
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:55,550
clear incentive by the way not to
approve drugs there's only because they

4538
01:32:55,550 --> 01:32:55,560
approve drugs there's only because they
 

4539
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:58,070

01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:37,109
that's
not that's not a mechanism that's

not that's not a mechanism that's
 

4575
01:33:37,119 --> 01:33:39,830
not that's not a mechanism that's
um the marketplace is competition so if

4576
01:33:39,830 --> 01:33:39,840
um the marketplace is competition so if
 

4577
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:41,709
um the marketplace is competition so if
you won't approve the drug if I still

4578
01:33:41,709 --> 01:33:41,719
you won't approve the drug if I still
 

4579
01:33:41,719 --> 01:33:44,350
you won't approve the drug if I still
think it's possible I will and it's not

01:33:44,350 --> 01:33:44,360
think it's possible I will and it's not
 

4581
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:46,510
think it's possible I will and it's not
01 you see the other thing that happens

4582
01:33:46,510 --> 01:33:46,520
01 you see the other thing that happens
 

4583
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:48,350
01 you see the other thing that happens
with the FDA is 01 it's either approved

4584
01:33:48,350 --> 01:33:48,360
with the FDA is 01 it's either approved
 

4585
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:50,510
with the FDA is 01 it's either approved
or it's not approved mhm oh it's

4586
01:33:50,510 --> 01:33:50,520
or it's not approved mhm oh it's
 

4587
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:52,189
or it's not approved mhm oh it's
approved for this but it's not approved

4588
01:33:52,189 --> 01:33:52,199
approved for this but it's not approved
 

4589
01:33:52,199 --> 01:33:54,189
approved for this but it's not approved
for that but what if what if what if a

4590
01:33:54,189 --> 01:33:54,199
for that but what if what if what if a
 

4591
01:33:54,199 --> 01:33:56,830
for that but what if what if what if a
drug came out and and and you said right

4592
01:33:56,830 --> 01:33:56,840
drug came out and and and you said right
 

4593
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:58,270
drug came out and and and you said right
you told the

4594
01:33:58,270 --> 01:33:58,280
you told the
 

4595
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:03,270
you told the
doctors this drug in 10% of the cases

4596
01:34:03,270 --> 01:34:03,280
doctors this drug in 10% of the cases
 

4597
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:05,910
doctors this drug in 10% of the cases
can cause patients an increased risk of

4598
01:34:05,910 --> 01:34:05,920
can cause patients an increased risk of
 

4599
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:09,149
can cause patients an increased risk of
heart disease you and your patients

4600
01:34:09,149 --> 01:34:09,159
heart disease you and your patients
 

4601
01:34:09,159 --> 01:34:10,870
heart disease you and your patients
should we're not we're not forcing you

4602
01:34:10,870 --> 01:34:10,880
should we're not we're not forcing you
 

4603
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:13,790
should we're not we're not forcing you
but you should right it's your medical

4604
01:34:13,790 --> 01:34:13,800
but you should right it's your medical
 

4605
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:15,590
but you should right it's your medical
responsibility to evaluate that and

4606
01:34:15,590 --> 01:34:15,600
responsibility to evaluate that and
 

4607
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:17,390
responsibility to evaluate that and
decide if the drug is appropriate or not

4608
01:34:17,390 --> 01:34:17,400
decide if the drug is appropriate or not
 

4609
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:19,189
decide if the drug is appropriate or not
why don't I get to make that choice if I

4610
01:34:19,189 --> 01:34:19,199
why don't I get to make that choice if I
 

4611
01:34:19,199 --> 01:34:20,910
why don't I get to make that choice if I
want to take on the 10% risk of heart

4612
01:34:20,910 --> 01:34:20,920
want to take on the 10% risk of heart
 

4613
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:23,750
want to take on the 10% risk of heart
disease so there was a drug and right

4614
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:23,760
disease so there was a drug and right
 

4615
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:25,470
disease so there was a drug and right
now I forget the name but it was a drug

4616
01:34:25,470 --> 01:34:25,480
now I forget the name but it was a drug
 

4617
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:27,350
now I forget the name but it was a drug
uh against pain particularly arthritic

4618
01:34:27,350 --> 01:34:27,360
uh against pain particularly arthritic
 

4619
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:30,070
uh against pain particularly arthritic
pain and it worked it reduced pain

4620
01:34:30,070 --> 01:34:30,080
pain and it worked it reduced pain
 

4621
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:32,790
pain and it worked it reduced pain
dramatically right and some people tried

4622
01:34:32,790 --> 01:34:32,800
dramatically right and some people tried
 

4623
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:34,430
dramatically right and some people tried
everything and this was the only drug

4624
01:34:34,430 --> 01:34:34,440
everything and this was the only drug
 

4625
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:36,310
everything and this was the only drug
that reduced their pain and it turned

4626
01:34:36,310 --> 01:34:36,320
that reduced their pain and it turned
 

4627
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:40,310
that reduced their pain and it turned
out that in 10% of the cases it it

4628
01:34:40,310 --> 01:34:40,320
out that in 10% of the cases it it
 

4629
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:42,750
out that in 10% of the cases it it
caused the elevated risk didn't kill

4630
01:34:42,750 --> 01:34:42,760
caused the elevated risk didn't kill
 

4631
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:44,470
caused the elevated risk didn't kill
people necessarily but it caused

4632
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:44,480
people necessarily but it caused
 

4633
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:46,149
people necessarily but it caused
elevated risk of heart

4634
01:34:46,149 --> 01:34:46,159
elevated risk of heart
 

4635
01:34:46,159 --> 01:34:49,149
elevated risk of heart
disease okay what did the FDA do it

4636
01:34:49,149 --> 01:34:49,159
disease okay what did the FDA do it
 

4637
01:34:49,159 --> 01:34:52,229
disease okay what did the FDA do it
banned the drug some people I know a lot

4638
01:34:52,229 --> 01:34:52,239
banned the drug some people I know a lot
 

4639
01:34:52,239 --> 01:34:56,070
banned the drug some people I know a lot
of people who said living with pain is

4640
01:34:56,070 --> 01:34:56,080
of people who said living with pain is
 

4641
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:58,390
of people who said living with pain is
much worse than taking on a 10% risk

4642
01:34:58,390 --> 01:34:58,400
much worse than taking on a 10% risk
 

4643
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:00,109
much worse than taking on a 10% risk
again probabilities right people don't

4644
01:35:00,109 --> 01:35:00,119
again probabilities right people don't
 

4645
01:35:00,119 --> 01:35:02,390
again probabilities right people don't
think in those numbers 10% risk of maybe

4646
01:35:02,390 --> 01:35:02,400
think in those numbers 10% risk of maybe
 

4647
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:03,990
think in those numbers 10% risk of maybe
getting heart disease why don't I get to

4648
01:35:03,990 --> 01:35:04,000
getting heart disease why don't I get to
 

4649
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:04,990
getting heart disease why don't I get to
make that choice why does some

4650
01:35:04,990 --> 01:35:05,000
make that choice why does some
 

4651
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,629
make that choice why does some
bureaucrat make that choice for

4652
01:35:06,629 --> 01:35:06,639
bureaucrat make that choice for
 

4653
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:10,270
bureaucrat make that choice for

4755
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:10,590

socialism so it's going to be bad

4756
01:37:10,590 --> 01:37:10,600
socialism so it's going to be bad
 

4757
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:11,870
socialism so it's going to be bad
because that's the only case there is

4758
01:37:11,870 --> 01:37:11,880
because that's the only case there is
 

4759
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:15,229

for being alive so win-win is both model

6480
02:12:52,109 --> 02:12:52,119
for being alive so win-win is both model
 

6481
02:12:52,119 --> 02:12:54,229
for being alive so win-win is both model
and practical in the beauty of ir man's

6483
02:12:54,239 --> 02:12:56,189
and practical in the beauty of ir man's
philosophy and I think this is really

6484
02:12:56,189 --> 02:12:56,199
philosophy and I think this is really
 

6485
02:12:56,199 --> 02:12:58,350
philosophy and I think this is really
important is that the model is the

6486
02:12:58,350 --> 02:12:58,360
important is that the model is the

happy yeah that that's the the con
that's why the application of the

02:13:08,280 --> 02:13:11,350
that's why the application of the
philosophy of objectivism is so easy to

practice so like or to discuss or
 

6499
02:13:14,119 --> 02:13:16,430
practice so like or to discuss or
possible to discuss that's why you talk

6500
02:13:16,430 --> 02:13:16,440
possible to discuss that's why you talk
 

6501
02:13:16,440 --> 02:13:18,990
possible to discuss that's why you talk
about clearcut I'm not ambiguous about

6502
02:13:18,990 --> 02:13:19,000
about clearcut I'm not ambiguous about
 

6503
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:20,830
about clearcut I'm not ambiguous about
my view and it's fundamentally practical

6504
02:13:20,830 --> 02:13:20,840
my view and it's fundamentally practical
 

6505
02:13:20,840 --> 02:13:22,790
my view and it's fundamentally practical
I mean that's the best of philosophies

6506
02:13:22,790 --> 02:13:22,800
I mean that's the best of philosophies
 

6507
02:13:22,800 --> 02:13:25,270
I mean that's the best of philosophies
is is practical yes it's in a sense

6508
02:13:25,270 --> 02:13:25,280
is is practical yes it's in a sense

violence why violent why draw the line

6706
02:17:26,230 --> 02:17:26,240
violence why violent why draw the line
 

6707
02:17:26,240 --> 02:17:28,870
violence why violent why draw the line
at this particular place right well

6708
02:17:28,870 --> 02:17:28,880
at this particular place right well
 

6709
02:17:28,880 --> 02:17:30,309
at this particular place right well
because there is no other place to draw

6710
02:17:30,309 --> 02:17:30,319
because there is no other place to draw
 

6711
02:17:30,319 --> 02:17:32,549
because there is no other place to draw
a line and they and there is a line and

02:17:32,549 --> 02:17:32,559
a line and they and there is a line and
 

6713
02:17:32,559 --> 02:17:34,429
a line and they and there is a line and
by the way we draw lines other places

6714
02:17:34,429 --> 02:17:34,439
by the way we draw lines other places
 

6715
02:17:34,439 --> 02:17:42,070
by the way we draw lines other places
right um we uh we don't vote we don't um

6716
02:17:42,070 --> 02:17:42,080
right um we uh we don't vote we don't um
 

6717
02:17:42,080 --> 02:17:44,110
right um we uh we don't vote we don't um
we don't

6718
02:17:44,110 --> 02:17:44,120
we don't
 

6719
02:17:44,120 --> 02:17:46,389
we don't
have we don't determine truth and

6720
02:17:46,389 --> 02:17:46,399
have we don't determine truth and
 

6721
02:17:46,399 --> 02:17:48,270
have we don't determine truth and

science based in
 

6723
02:17:48,280 --> 02:17:50,629
science based in
competition right so that's a that's a

6724
02:17:50,629 --> 02:17:50,639
competition right so that's a that's a
 

6725
02:17:50,639 --> 02:17:51,349
competition right so that's a that's a
line

6726

line
 

6727
02:17:51,359 --> 02:17:53,669

02:17:53,669 --> 02:17:53,679
but first of all some people might say I
 

6729
02:17:53,679 --> 02:17:55,389
but first of all some people might say I
mean there's competition in a sense that

6730
02:17:55,389 --> 02:17:55,399
mean there's competition in a sense that
 

6731
02:17:55,399 --> 02:17:57,589
mean there's competition in a sense that
you have alternate theories but at the

6732
02:17:57,589 --> 02:17:57,599
you have alternate theories but at the
 

6733
02:17:57,599 --> 02:18:00,110
you have alternate theories but at the
end of the day whether you decide that

6734
02:18:00,110 --> 02:18:00,120
end of the day whether you decide that
 

6735
02:18:00,120 --> 02:18:02,070

they don't see the Stream So first of

difficult than science in a sense
 

6779
02:19:01,120 --> 02:19:03,629
difficult than science in a sense
because it's more difficult to prove

force yes but that shuts down the
ability to reason an animals don't need

7124
02:26:06,910 --> 02:26:06,920
ability to reason an animals don't need
 

7125
02:26:06,920 --> 02:26:09,150
ability to reason an animals don't need
to because they can't exactly so the

7126
02:26:09,150 --> 02:26:09,160
to because they can't exactly so the
 

7127
02:26:09,160 --> 02:26:11,389

Innovation that is human beings is our

7128
02:26:11,389 --> 02:26:11,399
Innovation that is human beings is our
 

7129
02:26:11,399 --> 02:26:13,750
Innovation that is human beings is our
capacity to reason and therefore the

7130
02:26:13,750 --> 02:26:13,760
capacity to reason and therefore the
 

7131
02:26:13,760 --> 02:26:16,150
capacity to reason and therefore the
relegation of force to the animals we

7132
02:26:16,150 --> 02:26:16,160
relegation of force to the animals we
 

7133
02:26:16,160 --> 02:26:18,590
relegation of force to the animals we
don't do Force civilization is where we

7134
02:26:18,590 --> 02:26:18,600
don't do Force civilization is where we
 

7135
02:26:18,600 --> 02:26:22,750

lot of
 

8049
02:44:06,680 --> 02:44:10,670
lot of
us for people listening to this for the

8050
02:44:10,670 --> 02:44:10,680
us for people listening to this for the
 

8051
02:44:10,680 --> 02:44:12,590
us for people listening to this for the
few folks kind of listening to this and

8052
02:44:12,590 --> 02:44:12,600
few folks kind of listening to this and
 

8053
02:44:12,600 --> 02:44:15,309
few folks kind of listening to this and
and thinking about the trajectory of

8054
02:44:15,309 --> 02:44:15,319
and thinking about the trajectory of
 

8055
02:44:15,319 --> 02:44:16,710
and thinking about the trajectory of
their own

8056

their own
 

8057
02:44:16,720 --> 02:44:19,630
their own
life I guess the takeaway

8058
02:44:19,630 --> 02:44:19,640
life I guess the takeaway
 

8059
02:44:19,640 --> 02:44:24,630
life I guess the takeaway
is a reason is a difficult project but a

8060
02:44:24,630 --> 02:44:24,640
is a reason is a difficult project but a
 

8061
02:44:24,640 --> 02:44:27,830
is a reason is a difficult project but a
project that's worthy of taking on yeah

8062
02:44:27,830 --> 02:44:27,840
project that's worthy of taking on yeah
 

8063
02:44:27,840 --> 02:44:30,349
project that's worthy of taking on yeah
and difficult is I don't know if

8064
02:44:30,349 --> 02:44:30,359
and difficult is I don't know if
 

8065
02:44:30,359 --> 02:44:31,429
and difficult is I don't know if
difficult is the right word because

8066
02:44:31,429 --> 02:44:31,439
difficult is the right word because
 

8067
02:44:31,439 --> 02:44:32,990
difficult is the right word because
difficult sounds like it's you know I

8068
02:44:32,990 --> 02:44:33,000
difficult sounds like it's you know I
 

8069
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,349
difficult sounds like it's you know I
have to push this boulder up a hill it's

8070
02:44:35,349 --> 02:44:35,359
have to push this boulder up a hill it's
 

8071
02:44:35,359 --> 02:44:37,429
have to push this boulder up a hill it's
not difficult in that sense it's

8072
02:44:37,429 --> 02:44:37,439
not difficult in that sense it's
 

8073
02:44:37,439 --> 02:44:38,590
not difficult in that sense it's
difficult in the sense that it requires

8074
02:44:38,590 --> 02:44:38,600
difficult in the sense that it requires
 

8075
02:44:38,600 --> 02:44:41,870
difficult in the sense that it requires
energy and focus it requires effort but

8076
02:44:41,870 --> 02:44:41,880
energy and focus it requires effort but
 

8077
02:44:41,880 --> 02:44:44,950
energy and focus it requires effort but
it's immediately rewarding it's fun to

8078

immediate pretty quick right it takes a
 

8083
02:44:51,960 --> 02:44:53,590

while to undo all the garbage that you

8084
02:44:53,590 --> 02:44:53,600
while to undo all the garbage that you
 

8085
02:44:53,600 --> 02:44:55,870
while to undo all the garbage that you
have but we all have that I had that

have but we all have that I had that
 

8087
02:44:55,880 --> 02:44:57,429
have but we all have that I had that
took me years and years and years to get

8088
02:44:57,429 --> 02:44:57,439
took me years and years and years to get
 

8089
02:44:57,439 --> 02:44:58,870
took me years and years and years to get
rid of certain Concepts and certain

8090
02:44:58,870 --> 02:44:58,880
rid of certain Concepts and certain
 

8091
02:44:58,880 --> 02:45:01,110
rid of certain Concepts and certain
emotions that I had that didn't make any

8092
02:45:01,110 --> 02:45:01,120
emotions that I had that didn't make any
 

8093
02:45:01,120 --> 02:45:03,269
emotions that I had that didn't make any
sense but it it takes a long time to

8094
02:45:03,269 --> 02:45:03,279
sense but it it takes a long time to
 

8095
02:45:03,279 --> 02:45:07,150
sense but it it takes a long time to
fully integrate that so I I don't want

8096
02:45:07,150 --> 02:45:07,160
fully integrate that so I I don't want
 

8097
02:45:07,160 --> 02:45:10,070
fully integrate that so I I don't want
it to sound like it's a burden like it's

02:45:10,070 --> 02:45:10,080
it to sound like it's a burden like it's
 

8099
02:45:10,080 --> 02:45:12,590
it to sound like it's a burden like it's
hard in that sense it does require focus

hard in that sense it does require focus
 

8101
02:45:12,600 --> 02:45:15,070
hard in that sense it does require focus
and energy and I don't want to sound

8102
02:45:15,070 --> 02:45:15,080
and energy and I don't want to sound
 

8103

think about outcomes and then experience
 

8127
02:45:45,080 --> 02:45:46,710

change the
world is to change your one mind at a

8200
02:47:12,830 --> 02:47:12,840
world is to change your one mind at a
 

8201
02:47:12,840 --> 02:47:16,070
world is to change your one mind at a
time and uh and and when you when you

8202
02:47:16,070 --> 02:47:16,080
time and uh and and when you when you
 

8203
02:47:16,080 --> 02:47:18,670
time and uh and and when you when you
have an impact on a good mind and a mind

8204
02:47:18,670 --> 02:47:18,680
have an impact on a good mind and a mind
 

8205
02:47:18,680 --> 02:47:20,550
have an impact on a good mind and a mind
that cares about the world and a mind

8206
02:47:20,550 --> 02:47:20,560
that cares about the world and a mind
 

8207
02:47:20,560 --> 02:47:22,230
that cares about the world and a mind
that goes out and does something about

8208
02:47:22,230 --> 02:47:22,240
that goes out and does something about
 

8209
02:47:22,240 --> 02:47:24,870
that goes out and does something about
it then you get the exponential growth

8210
02:47:24,870 --> 02:47:24,880
it then you get the exponential growth
 

8211
02:47:24,880 --> 02:47:26,910
it then you get the exponential growth
so through you I've impacted other

8212
02:47:26,910 --> 02:47:26,920
so through you I've impacted other
 

8213
02:47:26,920 --> 02:47:29,469
so through you I've impacted other
people and that's how you get that's how

8214
02:47:29,469 --> 02:47:29,479
people and that's how you get that's how
 

8215
02:47:29,479 --> 02:47:32,150
people and that's how you get that's how
you ultimately change everything and and

8216
02:47:32,150 --> 02:47:32,160
you ultimately change everything and and
 

8217
02:47:32,160 --> 02:47:34,950
you ultimately change everything and and
so I'm in spite of everything I'm I'm

8218
02:47:34,950 --> 02:47:34,960
so I'm in spite of everything I'm I'm

optimistic in a sense that I think that
 

8221
02:47:37,920 --> 02:47:40,269

the progress we've made today is so

progress the technological problem it
can just vanish like it did under when

can just vanish like it did under when
 

8229
02:47:46,840 --> 02:47:49,349
can just vanish like it did under when
Rome collapsed and and whether it's in
