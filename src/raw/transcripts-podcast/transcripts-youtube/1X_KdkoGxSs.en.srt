00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,269
by India Iran and Yugoslavia I think
they would have represented the clear um

00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,389
the history um I noticed a lot of people
like to start at either 47 or 48 because

1260
00:29:33,389 --> 00:29:33,399
like to start at either 47 or 48 because
 

1261
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:34,630
like to start at either 47 or 48 because
it's the first time where they can

it's the first time where they can
 

1263
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,669
it's the first time where they can
clearly point to a catastrophe that

clearly point to a catastrophe that
 

1265
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:38,470
clearly point to a catastrophe that
occurs on the Arab side that they want

1266
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:38,480
occurs on the Arab side that they want
 

1267
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,909
occurs on the Arab side that they want
to ascribe 100% of the blame to the

to ascribe 100% of the blame to the

Jewish exclusivity it's funny because it

1324
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:44,799
Jewish exclusivity it's funny because it
 

1325
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,789
Jewish exclusivity it's funny because it
was brought up before that the partition

1326
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:46,799
was brought up before that the partition
 

1327
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,990
was brought up before that the partition
plan was unfair and that's why the Arabs

1328
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:49,000
plan was unfair and that's why the Arabs
 

1329
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,509
plan was unfair and that's why the Arabs
rejected it as though they rejected it

1330
00:30:50,509 --> 00:30:50,519
rejected it as though they rejected it
 

1331
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:52,149
rejected it as though they rejected it
because it was unfair because of the

1332
00:30:52,149 --> 00:30:52,159
because it was unfair because of the
 

1333
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,350
because it was unfair because of the
amount of land that Jews were given and

1334
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:53,360
amount of land that Jews were given and
 

1335
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,909
amount of land that Jews were given and
not just due to the fact that Jews were

1336
00:30:54,909 --> 00:30:54,919
not just due to the fact that Jews were
 

1337
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:57,350
not just due to the fact that Jews were
given land at all as though a 30%

1338
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:57,360
given land at all as though a 30%
 

1339
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,509
given land at all as though a 30%
partition or 25% partition would have

1340
00:30:59,509 --> 00:30:59,519
partition or 25% partition would have
 

1341
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,110
partition or 25% partition would have
been accepted when I don't think that

1342
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:01,120
been accepted when I don't think that
 

1343
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,389
been accepted when I don't think that
was the reality of the circumstances I

1344
00:31:03,389 --> 00:31:03,399
was the reality of the circumstances I
 

1345
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:04,470
was the reality of the circumstances I
feel like most of the other stuff has

1346
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:04,480
feel like most of the other stuff has
 

1347
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,230
feel like most of the other stuff has
been said but I I I noticed that um

1348
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:06,240
been said but I I I noticed that um
 

1349
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,990
been said but I I I noticed that um
whenever people talk about 48 or the

1350
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,000
whenever people talk about 48 or the
 

1351
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,430
whenever people talk about 48 or the
years preceding 48 um I think the worst

1352
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:10,440
years preceding 48 um I think the worst
 

1353
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,990
years preceding 48 um I think the worst
thing that happens is there's a there's

1354
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:12,000
thing that happens is there's a there's
 

1355
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,269
thing that happens is there's a there's
a cherry picking of the facts where

1356
00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:13,279
a cherry picking of the facts where
 

1357
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,310
a cherry picking of the facts where
basically all of the blame is ascribed

1358
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:15,320
basically all of the blame is ascribed
 

1359
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,909
basically all of the blame is ascribed
to this uh this built-in idea of Zionism

1360
00:31:18,909 --> 00:31:18,919
to this uh this built-in idea of Zionism
 

1361
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:20,470
to this uh this built-in idea of Zionism
that because of a handful of quotes or

1362
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:20,480
that because of a handful of quotes or
 

1363
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,590
that because of a handful of quotes or
because of an ideology we can say that

1364
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:22,600
because of an ideology we can say that
 

1365
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,549
because of an ideology we can say that
transfer or population exposion or the

1366
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:25,559
transfer or population exposion or the
 

1367
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:27,029
transfer or population exposion or the
the basically the Mandate of all of

1368
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:27,039
the basically the Mandate of all of
 

1369
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,310
the basically the Mandate of all of
these Arabs being kicked off the land

1370
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:28,320
these Arabs being kicked off the land
 

1371
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,269
these Arabs being kicked off the land
was always going to happen when I think

1372
00:31:30,269 --> 00:31:30,279
was always going to happen when I think
 

1373
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:31,669
was always going to happen when I think
there's a refusal sometimes as well to

1374
00:31:31,669 --> 00:31:31,679
there's a refusal sometimes as well to
 

1375
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,549
there's a refusal sometimes as well to
acknowledge that regardless of the ideas

1376
00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:33,559
acknowledge that regardless of the ideas
 

1377
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,029
acknowledge that regardless of the ideas
of some of the Zionist leaders there is

1378
00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:35,039
of some of the Zionist leaders there is
 

1379
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,350
of some of the Zionist leaders there is
a political social and Military reality

1380
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:37,360
a political social and Military reality
 

1381
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,430
a political social and Military reality
on the ground that they're forced to

1382
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:38,440
on the ground that they're forced to
 

1383
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,909
on the ground that they're forced to
contend with and unfortunately the Arabs

1384
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:41,919
contend with and unfortunately the Arabs
 

1385
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,470
contend with and unfortunately the Arabs
because of their inability to engage in

1386
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:43,480
because of their inability to engage in
 

1387
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,830
because of their inability to engage in
diplomacy and only to use tools of War

1388
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:45,840
diplomacy and only to use tools of War
 

1389
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,350
diplomacy and only to use tools of War
to try to negotiate everything going on

to try to negotiate everything going on
 

1391
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,230
to try to negotiate everything going on
in mandatory Palestine basically always

00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:49,240
in mandatory Palestine basically always
 

1393
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,669
in mandatory Palestine basically always
gave the Jews a reason or an excuse to

00:31:51,669 --> 00:31:51,679
gave the Jews a reason or an excuse to
 

1395
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,590
gave the Jews a reason or an excuse to
fight and acquire land through that way

1396
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:53,600
fight and acquire land through that way
 

1397
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,070
fight and acquire land through that way
uh because of their refusal to negotiate

1398
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:55,080
uh because of their refusal to negotiate

greater good to establish a Jewish State
 

1637

in the face of Arab peace because I feel
like every time there was a huge deal on

2088
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:51,520
like every time there was a huge deal on
 

2089
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,549
like every time there was a huge deal on
the table that would have had a sizable

2090
00:47:53,549 --> 00:47:53,559
the table that would have had a sizable

00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,750
Jewish and Arab population living

2094
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:57,760
together the Arabs would reject it out
 

2095
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,670
together the Arabs would reject it out

00:47:59,670 --> 00:47:59,680
of hand so for instance when we say that
 

2097
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,109
of hand so for instance when we say that
transfer was inevitable when we say that

2098
00:48:01,109 --> 00:48:01,119
transfer was inevitable when we say that
 

2099
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,230
transfer was inevitable when we say that

01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:46,160
to give 55%
 

2863
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:50,190
to give 55%
25% 10% of your country to the

2865
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:53,829
25% 10% of your country to the
Palestinians of course not and so um the

2866
01:04:53,829 --> 01:04:53,839
Palestinians of course not and so um the
 

2867
01:04:53,839 --> 01:04:56,950
Palestinians of course not and so um the
issue was not the existence of Jews in

2868
01:04:56,950 --> 01:04:56,960
issue was not the existence of Jews in
 

2869
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,390
issue was not the existence of Jews in
Palestine um they had been there for

2870
01:04:59,390 --> 01:04:59,400
Palestine um they had been there for
 

2871
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:03,230
Palestine um they had been there for
centuries and of course they had ties to

2872
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:03,240
centuries and of course they had ties to
 

2873
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,510
centuries and of course they had ties to
Palestine and particularly to Jerusalem

2874
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:05,520
Palestine and particularly to Jerusalem
 

2875
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,510
Palestine and particularly to Jerusalem
and and other places going back

2876
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:07,520
and and other places going back
 

2877
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:11,029
and and other places going back
centuries if not Millennia um but the

2878
01:05:11,029 --> 01:05:11,039
centuries if not Millennia um but the
 

2879
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:14,630
centuries if not Millennia um but the
idea of establishing an

2880
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:14,640
idea of establishing an
 

2881
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:18,190
idea of establishing an
exclusively Jewish State at the expense

2882
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:18,200
exclusively Jewish State at the expense
 

2883
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,390
exclusively Jewish State at the expense
of those who are already living there I

2884
01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:20,400
of those who are already living there I
 

2885
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:23,430
of those who are already living there I
think it was right to reject that and I

2886
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:23,440
think it was right to reject that and I
 

2887
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:26,430
think it was right to reject that and I
don't think we can look back now 75

2888
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:26,440
don't think we can look back now 75
 

2889
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:29,510
don't think we can look back now 75
years later and say well you should have

2890
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:29,520
years later and say well you should have
 

2891
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:32,069
years later and say well you should have
accepted losing 55% of your Homeland

2892
01:05:32,069 --> 01:05:32,079
accepted losing 55% of your Homeland
 

2893
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:34,549
accepted losing 55% of your Homeland
because you ended up losing 78% of it

2894
01:05:34,549 --> 01:05:34,559
because you ended up losing 78% of it
 

2895
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:36,630
because you ended up losing 78% of it
the addition and the remaining 22% was

2896
01:05:36,630 --> 01:05:36,640
the addition and the remaining 22% was
 

2897
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:37,789
the addition and the remaining 22% was
occupied in

2898
01:05:37,789 --> 01:05:37,799
occupied in
 

2899
01:05:37,799 --> 01:05:41,390
occupied in
1967 that's that's not how things work

2900
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:41,400
1967 that's that's not how things work
 

2901
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,750
1967 that's that's not how things work
yeah um and I can I can imagine I can

2902
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:43,760
yeah um and I can I can imagine I can
 

2903
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:48,750
yeah um and I can I can imagine I can
imagine an American rejecting giving 10%

2904
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:48,760
imagine an American rejecting giving 10%
 

2905
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:51,670
imagine an American rejecting giving 10%
of the United States to the Palestinians

2906
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:51,680
of the United States to the Palestinians
 

2907
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:54,309
of the United States to the Palestinians
and if that rejection leads to war and

2908
01:05:54,309 --> 01:05:54,319
and if that rejection leads to war and
 

2909
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:56,230
and if that rejection leads to war and
you lose half your country

2910
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:56,240
you lose half your country
 

2911
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,910
you lose half your country
I doubt that 50 years from now you're

2912
01:05:57,910 --> 01:05:57,920
I doubt that 50 years from now you're
 

2913
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,789
I doubt that 50 years from now you're
going to say well maybe I should have

2914
01:05:59,789 --> 01:05:59,799
going to say well maybe I should have
 

2915
01:05:59,799 --> 01:06:03,510
going to say well maybe I should have
accepted that sure so I like this answer

2916
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:03,520
accepted that sure so I like this answer
 

2917
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,710
accepted that sure so I like this answer
more than what I usually feel like I'm

2918
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:05,720
more than what I usually feel like I'm
 

2919
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:07,349
more than what I usually feel like I'm
hearing when it comes to the Palestinian

2920
01:06:07,349 --> 01:06:07,359
hearing when it comes to the Palestinian
 

2921
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:09,510
hearing when it comes to the Palestinian
rejection of the 47 partition plan

2922
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:09,520
rejection of the 47 partition plan
 

2923
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:10,829
rejection of the 47 partition plan
because sometimes I feel like a weird

2924
01:06:10,829 --> 01:06:10,839
because sometimes I feel like a weird
 

2925
01:06:10,839 --> 01:06:13,109
because sometimes I feel like a weird
switch happens to where the Arabs in the

2926
01:06:13,109 --> 01:06:13,119
switch happens to where the Arabs in the
 

2927
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:15,390
switch happens to where the Arabs in the
area are actually presented as entirely

2928
01:06:15,390 --> 01:06:15,400
area are actually presented as entirely
 

2929
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,309
area are actually presented as entirely
pragmatic people who are simply doing a

2930
01:06:17,309 --> 01:06:17,319
pragmatic people who are simply doing a
 

2931
01:06:17,319 --> 01:06:19,150
pragmatic people who are simply doing a
calculation and saying like well we're

2932
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:19,160
calculation and saying like well we're
 

2933
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:21,430
calculation and saying like well we're
losing 55% of our land Jews are only

2934
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:21,440
losing 55% of our land Jews are only
 

2935
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,190
losing 55% of our land Jews are only
maybe onethird of the people here and

2936
01:06:23,190 --> 01:06:23,200
maybe onethird of the people here and
 

2937
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,190
maybe onethird of the people here and
we've got 45 and N the math doesn't work

2938
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:25,200
we've got 45 and N the math doesn't work
 

2939
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,069
we've got 45 and N the math doesn't work
basically

2940
01:06:26,069 --> 01:06:26,079
basically
 

2941
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:27,910
basically
but it wasn't a math problem I think

2942
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:27,920
but it wasn't a math problem I think
 

2943
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:28,829
but it wasn't a math problem I think
like you said it was a matter of

2944
01:06:28,829 --> 01:06:28,839
like you said it was a matter of
 

2945
01:06:28,839 --> 01:06:30,390
like you said it was a matter of
principle it was an ideology problem no

2946
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:30,400
principle it was an ideology problem no
 

2947
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:31,589
principle it was an ideology problem no
it was a matter of principle yeah

2948
01:06:31,589 --> 01:06:31,599
it was a matter of principle yeah
 

2949
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:34,910
it was a matter of principle yeah
ideologically driven that that they as a

ideologically driven that that they as a

to this land that they've never actually
 

2955
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:40,390
to this land that they've never actually
had an independent state on that they've

2956
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:40,400
had an independent state on that they've
 

2957
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,670
had an independent state on that they've
never had even a guarantee of an

actually ruled a govern that last point
 

2963
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,309

is actually not correct because for all

01:06:47,309 --> 01:06:47,319
is actually not correct because for all
 

2965
01:06:47,319 --> 01:06:48,710
is actually not correct because for all
its

its
 

2967
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,829
its
Injustice um the mandate system

2968
01:06:51,829 --> 01:06:51,839
Injustice um the mandate system
 

2969
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:54,910
Injustice um the mandate system
recognized Palestine as a class a

Mandate of Israel the word exclusive
 

2993
01:07:16,119 --> 01:07:18,670
Mandate of Israel the word exclusive
which you keep using is nonsense the

2994
01:07:18,670 --> 01:07:18,680
which you keep using is nonsense the
 

2995
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:20,950
which you keep using is nonsense the
state which benan envisioned would be a

2996
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:20,960
state which benan envisioned would be a
 

2997
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,910
state which benan envisioned would be a
Jewish majority State as they accepted

2998
01:07:23,910 --> 01:07:23,920
Jewish majority State as they accepted
 

2999
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:26,549
Jewish majority State as they accepted
the 1947 partition

3000
01:07:26,549 --> 01:07:26,559
the 1947 partition
 

3001
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:29,510
the 1947 partition
resolution as Steven said that included

3002
01:07:29,510 --> 01:07:29,520
resolution as Steven said that included
 

3003
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:32,269
resolution as Steven said that included
400,000 plus Arabs in a state which

3004
01:07:32,269 --> 01:07:32,279
400,000 plus Arabs in a state which
 

3005
01:07:32,279 --> 01:07:34,950
400,000 plus Arabs in a state which
would have 500,000 Jews so the idea of

3006
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:34,960
would have 500,000 Jews so the idea of
 

3007
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,230
would have 500,000 Jews so the idea of
exclusivity wasn't anywhere in the air

3008
01:07:37,230 --> 01:07:37,240
exclusivity wasn't anywhere in the air
 

3009
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:40,789
exclusivity wasn't anywhere in the air
at all among the Zionist leaders in 4748

3010
01:07:40,789 --> 01:07:40,799
at all among the Zionist leaders in 4748
 

3011
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:42,789
at all among the Zionist leaders in 4748
they wanted a Jewish majority state but

3012
01:07:42,789 --> 01:07:42,799
they wanted a Jewish majority state but
 

3013
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:44,710
they wanted a Jewish majority state but
were willing to accept a state which had

3014
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:44,720
were willing to accept a state which had
 

3015
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:47,630
were willing to accept a state which had
40% Arabs that's one point the second

3016
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:47,640
40% Arabs that's one point the second

reflects let's say the dissonance uh
between the evidence and the conclusion

3497
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:51,950
fact um inherent and inbuilt and
inevitable um and I think the point that

3498
01:18:51,950 --> 01:18:51,960
inevitable um and I think the point that
 

3499
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:54,790
inevitable um and I think the point that
Norman I are making is is that you're

understand the sentiment but I think

3964
01:29:05,270 --> 01:29:05,280
understand the sentiment but I think
 

3965
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:09,030
understand the sentiment but I think
it's wrong but also you you we agree on

3966
01:29:09,030 --> 01:29:09,040
it's wrong but also you you we agree on
 

3967
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:11,470
it's wrong but also you you we agree on
I also you guys you used the words

3968
01:29:11,470 --> 01:29:11,480
I also you guys you used the words

I also you guys you used the words
earlier that it was Supremacy and

3970
01:29:12,910 --> 01:29:12,920
earlier that it was Supremacy and
 

3971

3975
01:29:17,159 --> 01:29:19,830
answer your question um as you husseini
did say that and I'm sure there was a

3976
01:29:19,830 --> 01:29:19,840
did say that and I'm sure there was a
 

3977
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:23,310
did say that and I'm sure there was a
very substantial uh body of Palestinian

3978
01:29:23,310 --> 01:29:23,320
very substantial uh body of Palestinian
 

3979
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:26,470
very substantial uh body of Palestinian
Arab public opinion that endorsed that

3980
01:29:26,470 --> 01:29:26,480
Arab public opinion that endorsed that
 

3981
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:31,149
Arab public opinion that endorsed that
um but by the same token I think um uh

3982
01:29:31,149 --> 01:29:31,159
um but by the same token I think um uh
 

3983
01:29:31,159 --> 01:29:34,910
um but by the same token I think um uh
unitary Arab State as you call it or a

3984
01:29:34,910 --> 01:29:34,920
unitary Arab State as you call it or a
 

3985
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:37,270
unitary Arab State as you call it or a
Palestinian State could have been

01:29:37,270 --> 01:29:37,280
Palestinian State could have been
 

3987
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:40,510
Palestinian State could have been
established with arrangements with

01:29:40,510 --> 01:29:40,520
established with arrangements with

01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:44,470
established with arrangements with
guarantees um to ensure the security and

3991
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:46,950
guarantees um to ensure the security and
rights of of both communities how that

3992
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:46,960

3995
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:53,550
would work in detail had had been um uh
discussed and proposed but never uh

and again I think you know Jewish fears

4000
01:29:58,870 --> 01:29:58,880
and again I think you know Jewish fears
 

4001
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:00,990
and again I think you know Jewish fears
about what would have second Holocaust

4002
01:30:00,990 --> 01:30:01,000
about what would have second Holocaust
 

4003
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,709
about what would have second Holocaust
that's what we no I I think that was the

4004
01:30:02,709 --> 01:30:02,719
that's what we no I I think that was the
 

4005
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:05,270
that's what we no I I think that was the
Jewish fear a second Holocaust that that

4006
01:30:05,270 --> 01:30:05,280
Jewish fear a second Holocaust that that
 

4007
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:06,990
Jewish fear a second Holocaust that that
may well have been the Jewish fear it

4008
01:30:06,990 --> 01:30:07,000
may well have been the Jewish fear it
 

4009
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,629
may well have been the Jewish fear it
was an unfounded uh Jewish fear it was

01:30:09,629 --> 01:30:09,639
was an unfounded uh Jewish fear it was
 

4011
01:30:09,639 --> 01:30:11,310
was an unfounded uh Jewish fear it was
unfounded of course it was unfounded

4012
01:30:11,310 --> 01:30:11,320
unfounded of course it was unfounded
 

4013
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:13,910
unfounded of course it was unfounded
what about like in 48 and you really

4014
01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:13,920
what about like in 48 and you really
 

4015
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:16,310
what about like in 48 and you really
think you really think that the

4016
01:30:16,310 --> 01:30:16,320
think you really think that the
 

4017
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,109
think you really think that the
Palestinians had they won the war were

4018
01:30:18,109 --> 01:30:18,119
Palestinians had they won the war were
 

4019
01:30:18,119 --> 01:30:20,510
Palestinians had they won the war were
going to import ovens and crematoria

4020
01:30:20,510 --> 01:30:20,520
going to import ovens and crematoria
 

4021
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:22,430
going to import ovens and crematoria
from Germany but there were programs

4022
01:30:22,430 --> 01:30:22,440
from Germany but there were programs
 

4023
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:24,590
from Germany but there were programs
across in almost every single Arab state

4024
01:30:24,590 --> 01:30:24,600
across in almost every single Arab state
 

4025
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:26,590
across in almost every single Arab state
where there were Jews living after after

4026
01:30:26,590 --> 01:30:26,600
where there were Jews living after after
 

4027
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:29,430
where there were Jews living after after
48 after 56 after 67 there were always

4028
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:29,440
48 after 56 after 67 there were always
 

4029
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:31,109
48 after 56 after 67 there were always
progrms there were always flights from

progrms there were always flights from
 

4031
01:30:31,119 --> 01:30:32,430

4035
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:36,189
afterward I think I wouldn't I wouldn't
say there were always pograms in every

Arab State I think there was flight of
 

4039
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:43,390
Arab State I think there was flight of
of um uh Arab Jews for multiple reasons

4040
01:30:43,390 --> 01:30:43,400
of um uh Arab Jews for multiple reasons
 

4041
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:45,709
of um uh Arab Jews for multiple reasons
in some cases for precisely the reasons

4042
01:30:45,709 --> 01:30:45,719
in some cases for precisely the reasons
 

4043
01:30:45,719 --> 01:30:47,510
in some cases for precisely the reasons
you say if you look at the Jewish

4044
01:30:47,510 --> 01:30:47,520
you say if you look at the Jewish
 

4045
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:50,109
you say if you look at the Jewish
community in Algeria for example their

4046
01:30:50,109 --> 01:30:50,119
community in Algeria for example their
 

4047
01:30:50,119 --> 01:30:52,629
community in Algeria for example their
flight had virtually nothing to do with

4048
01:30:52,629 --> 01:30:52,639
flight had virtually nothing to do with
 

4049
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:56,109
flight had virtually nothing to do with
um uh the Arab Israel conflict the issue

4050
01:30:56,109 --> 01:30:56,119
um uh the Arab Israel conflict the issue
 

4051
01:30:56,119 --> 01:30:59,350
um uh the Arab Israel conflict the issue
of of Algerian Jews was that the French

4052
01:30:59,350 --> 01:30:59,360
of of Algerian Jews was that the French
 

4053
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:01,350
of of Algerian Jews was that the French
gave them citizenship during their

gave them citizenship during their
 

4055

gave them citizenship during their
colonial rule of Algeria and they

4057
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:06,470

Stephen yeah I think that when you look
at the behaviors of both parties uh in

at the behaviors of both parties uh in

at the behaviors of both parties uh in

01:37:48,669 --> 01:37:48,679
in the time period around 48 or
 

4373
01:37:48,679 --> 01:37:50,990
in the time period around 48 or
especially 48 and earlier um there's

4374
01:37:50,990 --> 01:37:51,000
especially 48 and earlier um there's
 

4375
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,350
especially 48 and earlier um there's
this assumption that there was this huge

4376
01:37:52,350 --> 01:37:52,360
this assumption that there was this huge
 

4377
01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:54,669
this assumption that there was this huge
built-in mechanism of Zionism and that

4378
01:37:54,669 --> 01:37:54,679
built-in mechanism of Zionism and that
 

4379
01:37:54,679 --> 01:37:56,310
built-in mechanism of Zionism and that
it was going to be inevitable from the

4380
01:37:56,310 --> 01:37:56,320
it was going to be inevitable from the
 

4381

I guess that appeared in herz's mind

4384
01:38:00,510 --> 01:38:00,520
I guess that appeared in herz's mind
 

4385
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:02,550
I guess that appeared in herz's mind
that there would be a mass violent

4386
01:38:02,550 --> 01:38:02,560
that there would be a mass violent

State uh I understand that there are

4392
01:38:09,149 --> 01:38:09,159

some quotes that we can find that maybe

4394
01:38:11,310 --> 01:38:11,320
some quotes that we can find that maybe
 

4395
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:13,510
some quotes that we can find that maybe
seem to possibly support an idea that

4396
01:38:13,510 --> 01:38:13,520
seem to possibly support an idea that
 

4397
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:15,149
seem to possibly support an idea that
looks close to that but I think when you

4398
01:38:15,149 --> 01:38:15,159
looks close to that but I think when you
 

4399
01:38:15,159 --> 01:38:16,629
looks close to that but I think when you
actually consult the record of what

4400
01:38:16,629 --> 01:38:16,639
actually consult the record of what
 

4401
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:18,270
actually consult the record of what
happened when you look at the

happened when you look at the
 

4403
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:20,510
happened when you look at the

01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:28,430
their nation borders uh I just don't
think that the historical record agrees

4412
01:38:28,430 --> 01:38:28,440
think that the historical record agrees
 

4413
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:29,750
think that the historical record agrees
with the idea that Zionist would have

4414
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:29,760
with the idea that Zionist would have
 

4415
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:32,669
with the idea that Zionist would have
just never been okay living alongside

4416
01:38:32,669 --> 01:38:32,679
just never been okay living alongside
 

4417
01:38:32,679 --> 01:38:35,149
just never been okay living alongside
Arab Palestinians uh but when you look

4418
01:38:35,149 --> 01:38:35,159
Arab Palestinians uh but when you look
 

4419
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:36,990
Arab Palestinians uh but when you look
at the other side Arabs would out of

4420
01:38:36,990 --> 01:38:37,000
at the other side Arabs would out of
 

4421
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,750
at the other side Arabs would out of
hand reject literally any deal that

4422
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:39,760
hand reject literally any deal that
 

4423
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:42,189
hand reject literally any deal that
apportioned any amount of that land for

4424
01:38:42,189 --> 01:38:42,199
apportioned any amount of that land for
 

4425
01:38:42,199 --> 01:38:44,589
apportioned any amount of that land for
any state relating to Jewish people or

4426
01:38:44,589 --> 01:38:44,599
any state relating to Jewish people or
 

4427
01:38:44,599 --> 01:38:45,990
any state relating to Jewish people or
the Israeli people I think it was said

4428
01:38:45,990 --> 01:38:46,000
the Israeli people I think it was said
 

4429
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,790
the Israeli people I think it was said
even on the other end of the table that

4430
01:38:47,790 --> 01:38:47,800
even on the other end of the table that
 

4431
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:49,390
even on the other end of the table that
uh Arab Palestinians would have never

4432
01:38:49,390 --> 01:38:49,400
uh Arab Palestinians would have never
 

4433
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:50,390
uh Arab Palestinians would have never
accepted the Arabs would have never

4434
01:38:50,390 --> 01:38:50,400
accepted the Arabs would have never
 

4435
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:52,629
accepted the Arabs would have never
accepted any Jewish State whatsoever so

4436
01:38:52,629 --> 01:38:52,639
accepted any Jewish State whatsoever so
 

4437
01:38:52,639 --> 01:38:55,070
accepted any Jewish State whatsoever so
it's interesting that on the ideology

4438
01:38:55,070 --> 01:38:55,080
it's interesting that on the ideology
 

4439
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:56,629
it's interesting that on the ideology
part where it's claimed that zionists

4440
01:38:56,629 --> 01:38:56,639
part where it's claimed that zionists
 

4441
01:38:56,639 --> 01:38:58,870
part where it's claimed that zionists
are people of exclusion and Supremacy

4442
01:38:58,870 --> 01:38:58,880
are people of exclusion and Supremacy
 

4443
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:00,950
are people of exclusion and Supremacy
and expulsion uh we can find that in

4444
01:39:00,950 --> 01:39:00,960
and expulsion uh we can find that in
 

4445
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:02,790
and expulsion uh we can find that in
Diary entries but we can find that

4446
01:39:02,790 --> 01:39:02,800
Diary entries but we can find that
 

4447
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:04,709
Diary entries but we can find that
expressed in very real terms on the Arab

4448
01:39:04,709 --> 01:39:04,719
expressed in very real terms on the Arab
 

4449
01:39:04,719 --> 01:39:06,350
expressed in very real terms on the Arab
side I think in all of their behavior

4450
01:39:06,350 --> 01:39:06,360
side I think in all of their behavior
 

4451
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:08,709
side I think in all of their behavior
around 48 and earlier where the goal was

4452
01:39:08,709 --> 01:39:08,719
around 48 and earlier where the goal was
 

4453
01:39:08,719 --> 01:39:10,750
around 48 and earlier where the goal was
the destruction of the Israeli State um

4454
01:39:10,750 --> 01:39:10,760
the destruction of the Israeli State um
 

4455
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:11,870
the destruction of the Israeli State um
it would have been the dispossession of

4456
01:39:11,870 --> 01:39:11,880
it would have been the dispossession of
 

4457
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:13,109
it would have been the dispossession of
many Jewish people it probably would

4458
01:39:13,109 --> 01:39:13,119
many Jewish people it probably would
 

4459
01:39:13,119 --> 01:39:14,550
many Jewish people it probably would
have been the exposion of a lot of them

4460
01:39:14,550 --> 01:39:14,560
have been the exposion of a lot of them
 

4461
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:16,070
have been the exposion of a lot of them
back to Europe and I think that very

4462
01:39:16,070 --> 01:39:16,080
back to Europe and I think that very
 

4463
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:17,189
back to Europe and I think that very
clearly plays out in the difference

4464
01:39:17,189 --> 01:39:17,199
clearly plays out in the difference
 

4465
01:39:17,199 --> 01:39:18,910
clearly plays out in the difference
between the actions of the Arabs versus

4466
01:39:18,910 --> 01:39:18,920
between the actions of the Arabs versus
 

4467
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:20,790
between the actions of the Arabs versus
some diary entries of some Jewish

4468
01:39:20,790 --> 01:39:20,800
some diary entries of some Jewish
 

4469
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:23,990
some diary entries of some Jewish
leaders Benny well one thing which stood

4470
01:39:23,990 --> 01:39:24,000
leaders Benny well one thing which stood
 

4471
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,470
leaders Benny well one thing which stood
out and um I think mu made this point is

4472
01:39:27,470 --> 01:39:27,480
out and um I think mu made this point is
 

4473
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:28,870
out and um I think mu made this point is
that the Arabs had nothing to do with

4474
01:39:28,870 --> 01:39:28,880
that the Arabs had nothing to do with
 

4475
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,629
that the Arabs had nothing to do with
the Holocaust but then the world

4476
01:39:30,629 --> 01:39:30,639
the Holocaust but then the world
 

4477
01:39:30,639 --> 01:39:32,910
the Holocaust but then the world
Community forced the Arabs to pay the

Community forced the Arabs to pay the
 

4479
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:35,030
Community forced the Arabs to pay the
price for the Holocaust that's the

4480
01:39:35,030 --> 01:39:35,040
price for the Holocaust that's the
 

4481
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:38,430
price for the Holocaust that's the
traditional Arab argument um this is

4482
01:39:38,430 --> 01:39:38,440
traditional Arab argument um this is
 

4483
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:40,790
traditional Arab argument um this is
slightly distorting the reality the

4484
01:39:40,790 --> 01:39:40,800
slightly distorting the reality the
 

4485
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,030
slightly distorting the reality the
Arabs in the

Palestine which was the only Safe Haven

01:39:50,750 --> 01:39:50,760
Palestine which was the only Safe Haven
 

4493
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:52,910

nobody wanted Jews anywhere and they

4496
01:39:54,589 --> 01:39:54,599
nobody wanted Jews anywhere and they
 

4497
01:39:54,599 --> 01:39:56,830
nobody wanted Jews anywhere and they
were being persecuted in Central Europe

4498

were being persecuted in Central Europe
 

4499
01:39:56,840 --> 01:39:58,550
were being persecuted in Central Europe
and eventually would be massacred in

4500
01:39:58,550 --> 01:39:58,560
and eventually would be massacred in
 

4501
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:01,790
and eventually would be massacred in
large numbers so the Arab effort to

4502
01:40:01,790 --> 01:40:01,800
large numbers so the Arab effort to
 

4503
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:04,189
large numbers so the Arab effort to
pressure the British to prevent Jews

4504

pressure the British to prevent Jews

4507
01:40:07,119 --> 01:40:10,109
reaching palestine's safe Shores
contributed indirectly to the slaughter

4508
01:40:10,109 --> 01:40:10,119
contributed indirectly to the slaughter
 

4509
01:40:10,119 --> 01:40:12,070
contributed indirectly to the slaughter
of many Jews in Europe because they

4510
01:40:12,070 --> 01:40:12,080
of many Jews in Europe because they
 

4511
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:13,589
of many Jews in Europe because they
couldn't get to anywhere and they

4513
01:40:13,599 --> 01:40:15,149
couldn't get to anywhere and they
couldn't get to Palestine because the

4514
01:40:15,149 --> 01:40:15,159
couldn't get to Palestine because the
 

4515
01:40:15,159 --> 01:40:17,109
couldn't get to Palestine because the
Arabs were busy attacking Jews in

4516

Palestine and attacking the British to

01:40:19,350 --> 01:40:19,360
Palestine and attacking the British to
 

4519
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:21,589
Palestine and attacking the British to
make sure they didn't allow Jews to

4520
01:40:21,589 --> 01:40:21,599
make sure they didn't allow Jews to
 

4521
01:40:21,599 --> 01:40:24,109
make sure they didn't allow Jews to
reach this Safe Haven that's important

4522
01:40:24,109 --> 01:40:24,119
reach this Safe Haven that's important
 

4523
01:40:24,119 --> 01:40:25,790

the second thing is of course there's no
 

4525
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:28,109
the second thing is of course there's no
point in belittling the fact that the

4556
01:41:10,950 --> 01:41:10,960
that so there this can't be removed from
 

4557
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:13,589
that so there this can't be removed from
the fact that the Arabs um as you say

4558
01:41:13,589 --> 01:41:13,599
the fact that the Arabs um as you say
 

4559
01:41:13,599 --> 01:41:15,510
the fact that the Arabs um as you say
paid a price for the Holocaust but they

4560
01:41:15,510 --> 01:41:15,520
paid a price for the Holocaust but they
 

4561
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:18,430
paid a price for the Holocaust but they
also participated in various ways in

4562
01:41:18,430 --> 01:41:18,440
also participated in various ways in
 

4563
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:20,270
also participated in various ways in
helping it

4564
01:41:20,270 --> 01:41:20,280
helping it
 

4565
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:23,910
helping it
happen right I'll make two points um the

4566
01:41:23,910 --> 01:41:23,920
happen right I'll make two points um the
 

4567
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:28,310
happen right I'll make two points um the
first is um you mentioned ha husseini

4568
01:41:28,310 --> 01:41:28,320
first is um you mentioned ha husseini
 

4569
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:31,390
first is um you mentioned ha husseini
and his uh collaboration with the

4570
01:41:31,390 --> 01:41:31,400
and his uh collaboration with the
 

4571
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:34,910
and his uh collaboration with the
Nazis entirely legitimate point to raise

4572
01:41:34,910 --> 01:41:34,920
Nazis entirely legitimate point to raise
 

4573
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:37,589
Nazis entirely legitimate point to raise
but I think one can also say

4574
01:41:37,589 --> 01:41:37,599
but I think one can also say
 

4575
01:41:37,599 --> 01:41:40,149
but I think one can also say
definitively had Haj am Al husseini

4576
01:41:40,149 --> 01:41:40,159
definitively had Haj am Al husseini
 

4577
01:41:40,159 --> 01:41:42,709
definitively had Haj am Al husseini
never existed the Holocaust would have

4578
01:41:42,709 --> 01:41:42,719
never existed the Holocaust would have
 

4579
01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:45,709
never existed the Holocaust would have
played out precisely certainly um as it

4580
01:41:45,709 --> 01:41:45,719
played out precisely certainly um as it
 

4581
01:41:45,719 --> 01:41:49,070
played out precisely certainly um as it
did certainly as far as um Palestinian

4582
01:41:49,070 --> 01:41:49,080
did certainly as far as um Palestinian
 

4583
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:51,589
did certainly as far as um Palestinian
opposition to Jewish immigration to

4584
01:41:51,589 --> 01:41:51,599
opposition to Jewish immigration to
 

4585
01:41:51,599 --> 01:41:54,510
opposition to Jewish immigration to
Palestine um during the 1930s is

4586
01:41:54,510 --> 01:41:54,520
Palestine um during the 1930s is
 

4587
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:56,750
Palestine um during the 1930s is
concerned it was of a different

4588
01:41:56,750 --> 01:41:56,760
concerned it was of a different
 

4589
01:41:56,760 --> 01:42:00,430
concerned it was of a different
character than for example British and

4590
01:42:00,430 --> 01:42:00,440
character than for example British and
 

4591
01:42:00,440 --> 01:42:03,510
character than for example British and
American um rejection of uh Jewish

4592
01:42:03,510 --> 01:42:03,520
American um rejection of uh Jewish
 

4593
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:05,070
American um rejection of uh Jewish
immigration they just didn't want Jews

4594
01:42:05,070 --> 01:42:05,080
immigration they just didn't want Jews
 

4595
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:07,790
immigration they just didn't want Jews
on their soil objectively it helped the

4596
01:42:07,790 --> 01:42:07,800
on their soil objectively it helped the
 

4597
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:08,950
on their soil objectively it helped the
Germans kill the Jews and the

4598
01:42:08,950 --> 01:42:08,960
Germans kill the Jews and the
 

4599
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:11,830
Germans kill the Jews and the
Palestinian case their opposition to

4600
01:42:11,830 --> 01:42:11,840
Palestinian case their opposition to
 

4601
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:14,149
Palestinian case their opposition to
Jewish immigration was to prevent the

4602
01:42:14,149 --> 01:42:14,159
Jewish immigration was to prevent the
 

4603
01:42:14,159 --> 01:42:16,589
Jewish immigration was to prevent the
transformation of their Homeland into a

4604
01:42:16,589 --> 01:42:16,599
transformation of their Homeland into a
 

4605
01:42:16,599 --> 01:42:19,109
transformation of their Homeland into a
Jewish state that would dispossess them

4606
01:42:19,109 --> 01:42:19,119
Jewish state that would dispossess them
 

4607
01:42:19,119 --> 01:42:20,550
Jewish state that would dispossess them
and I think that's an important

4608
01:42:20,550 --> 01:42:20,560
and I think that's an important
 

4609
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:23,589
and I think that's an important
distinction to make um the other point I

4610
01:42:23,589 --> 01:42:23,599
distinction to make um the other point I
 

4611
01:42:23,599 --> 01:42:26,109
distinction to make um the other point I
wanted to make is we've we've spent the

4612
01:42:26,109 --> 01:42:26,119
wanted to make is we've we've spent the
 

4613
01:42:26,119 --> 01:42:29,310
wanted to make is we've we've spent the
past several hours talking about uh uh

4614
01:42:29,310 --> 01:42:29,320
past several hours talking about uh uh
 

4615
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:31,950
past several hours talking about uh uh
Zionism transfer and so on but I think

4616
01:42:31,950 --> 01:42:31,960
Zionism transfer and so on but I think
 

4617
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:34,990
Zionism transfer and so on but I think
there's a more fundamental aspect to

4618
01:42:34,990 --> 01:42:35,000
there's a more fundamental aspect to
 

4619
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:39,189
there's a more fundamental aspect to
this which is that um Zionism I think

4620
01:42:39,189 --> 01:42:39,199
this which is that um Zionism I think
 

4621
01:42:39,199 --> 01:42:42,669
this which is that um Zionism I think
would have emerged and disappeared as

4622
01:42:42,669 --> 01:42:42,679
would have emerged and disappeared as
 

4623
01:42:42,679 --> 01:42:46,229
would have emerged and disappeared as
yet one more utopian political project

4624
01:42:46,229 --> 01:42:46,239
yet one more utopian political project
 

4625
01:42:46,239 --> 01:42:49,310
yet one more utopian political project
had it not been for the British um what

4626
01:42:49,310 --> 01:42:49,320
had it not been for the British um what
 

4627
01:42:49,320 --> 01:42:51,669

over them I don't think um a Jewish
 

4667
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:53,350
over them I don't think um a Jewish
state in Palestine had been part of br

01:43:53,350 --> 01:43:53,360
state in Palestine had been part of br

ended up taking a different
 

4679
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:10,270
ended up taking a different
course um and I think the the the most

4680
01:44:10,270 --> 01:44:10,280
course um and I think the the the most
 

4681
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:12,550
course um and I think the the the most
important development was uh World War

4682
01:44:12,550 --> 01:44:12,560
important development was uh World War
 

4683
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:15,229
important development was uh World War
II and I think this had maybe less to do

4684
01:44:15,229 --> 01:44:15,239
II and I think this had maybe less to do
 

4685
01:44:15,239 --> 01:44:18,390
II and I think this had maybe less to do
with the Holocaust and more to do with

4686
01:44:18,390 --> 01:44:18,400
with the Holocaust and more to do with
 

4687
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:21,510
with the Holocaust and more to do with
the effective bankruptcy of the United

the effective bankruptcy of the United
 

4689
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:23,430
the effective bankruptcy of the United

01:44:35,390 --> 01:44:35,400
that context I think that we need to see
 

4699
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:39,109

on the Gaza Strip and I think with the
intention by the Kamas of the Israeli

5856
02:09:41,149 --> 02:09:41,159
intention by the Kamas of the Israeli
 

5857
02:09:41,159 --> 02:09:42,830
intention by the Kamas of the Israeli
counter offensive because they knew that

that counter offensive would result in

02:09:45,589 --> 02:09:45,599
that counter offensive would result in
 

5861
02:09:45,599 --> 02:09:48,390
that counter offensive would result in
many Palestinian dead because the the

5862
02:09:48,390 --> 02:09:48,400
many Palestinian dead because the the
 

5863
02:09:48,400 --> 02:09:50,790
many Palestinian dead because the the
Hamas Fighters and their weaponry and so

5864
02:09:50,790 --> 02:09:50,800
Hamas Fighters and their weaponry and so
 

5865
02:09:50,800 --> 02:09:53,030
Hamas Fighters and their weaponry and so
on were embedded in the population in

Israel chased these Hamas people and
their ammunition dumps and so on and

again I I understood your question is
referring specifically to Hamas which is

referring specifically to Hamas which is
 

6397
02:21:15,439 --> 02:21:17,990
referring specifically to Hamas which is
why I tried to answer it that way but if

6398
02:21:17,990 --> 02:21:18,000
why I tried to answer it that way but if
 

6399
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:21,030
why I tried to answer it that way but if

if you mean specifically Hamas we don't
have a clear breakdown of how I don't

6404
02:21:25,070 --> 02:21:25,080
have a clear breakdown of how I don't
 

6405
02:21:25,080 --> 02:21:26,510
have a clear breakdown of how I don't

a lot of heavy li who use some that's
 

6411
02:21:30,200 --> 02:21:32,389
a lot of heavy li who use some that's
fine but some can mean anywhere from 1%

6412
02:21:32,389 --> 02:21:32,399
fine but some can mean anywhere from 1%
 

6413
02:21:32,399 --> 02:21:35,790
fine but some can mean anywhere from 1%
to 49% but we don't know so the numbers

02:21:35,790 --> 02:21:35,800
to 49% but we don't know so the numbers

here and the details are uh interesting
 

6417
02:21:37,760 --> 02:21:39,070
here and the details are uh interesting
and important almost from a legal

6418
02:21:39,070 --> 02:21:39,080
and important almost from a legal
 

6419
02:21:39,080 --> 02:21:42,070
and important almost from a legal
perspective but if we zoom out the moral

6420

however um while I appreciate the
recognition of the distinction the idea

6642

recognition of the distinction the idea
 

6643
02:26:54,760 --> 02:26:57,710
recognition of the distinction the idea
that the the cause for war that Hamas

kill civilians in in in Gaza they could
have killed 500,000 by now with the

8162
02:57:17,190 --> 02:57:17,200
have killed 500,000 by now with the
 

8163
02:57:17,200 --> 02:57:19,550
have killed 500,000 by now with the
number of strikes and the fact that they

8164
02:57:19,550 --> 02:57:19,560
number of strikes and the fact that they
 

8165
02:57:19,560 --> 02:57:22,910
number of strikes and the fact that they
only killed a certain small number, is a

8166
02:57:22,910 --> 02:57:22,920
only killed a certain small number, is a
 

8167
02:57:22,920 --> 02:57:25,870
only killed a certain small number, is a
small number small number in 30,000

8168
02:57:25,870 --> 02:57:25,880
small number small number in 30,000
 

8169
02:57:25,880 --> 02:57:28,269
small number small number in 30,000
number proportion over four months

8170
02:57:28,269 --> 02:57:28,279
number proportion over four months
 

8171
02:57:28,279 --> 02:57:31,750
number proportion over four months
probably is an indication 12000 targeted

8172
02:57:31,750 --> 02:57:31,760
probably is an indication 12000 targeted
 

8173

because in the other cases that that the

the court to render an opinion on the

um of Israel's military operation from
 

8467
03:04:23,080 --> 03:04:26,670
um of Israel's military operation from
my perspective um the key issue on the

8468
03:04:26,670 --> 03:04:26,680
my perspective um the key issue on the
 

8469
03:04:26,680 --> 03:04:29,429
my perspective um the key issue on the
26th of January was whether the court

8470
03:04:29,429 --> 03:04:29,439
26th of January was whether the court
 

8471
03:04:29,439 --> 03:04:32,070
26th of January was whether the court
would simply dismiss the case or decide

8472
03:04:32,070 --> 03:04:32,080
would simply dismiss the case or decide
 

8473
03:04:32,080 --> 03:04:34,150
would simply dismiss the case or decide
to proceed with it and it decided to

8474
03:04:34,150 --> 03:04:34,160
to proceed with it and it decided to
 

8475
03:04:34,160 --> 03:04:36,790
to proceed with it and it decided to
proceed it decided to and I think that's

8476
03:04:36,790 --> 03:04:36,800
proceed it decided to and I think that's
 

8477
03:04:36,800 --> 03:04:39,710
proceed it decided to and I think that's

a body count um genocide consists of two

8560
03:06:29,389 --> 03:06:29,399
a body count um genocide consists of two
 

8561
03:06:29,399 --> 03:06:32,870
a body count um genocide consists of two
elements um the destruction of a people

8562
03:06:32,870 --> 03:06:32,880
elements um the destruction of a people
 

8563
03:06:32,880 --> 03:06:35,950
elements um the destruction of a people
and whole or in part so in other words

8564
03:06:35,950 --> 03:06:35,960
and whole or in part so in other words
 

8565
03:06:35,960 --> 03:06:37,790
and whole or in part so in other words
you can commit genocide by killing

8566
03:06:37,790 --> 03:06:37,800
you can commit genocide by killing
 

8567
03:06:37,800 --> 03:06:39,990
you can commit genocide by killing
30,000 people it doesn't have well five

8568
03:06:39,990 --> 03:06:40,000
30,000 people it doesn't have well five
 

8569
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:42,630
30,000 people it doesn't have well five
probably is below the thresold number

8570
03:06:42,630 --> 03:06:42,640
probably is below the thresold number
 

8571
03:06:42,640 --> 03:06:45,110
probably is below the thresold number
yes but I think 30,000 crosses the

8572
03:06:45,110 --> 03:06:45,120
yes but I think 30,000 crosses the
 

8573
03:06:45,120 --> 03:06:48,070
yes but I think 30,000 crosses the
threshold and not reaching 500 ,000 is

8574
03:06:48,070 --> 03:06:48,080
threshold and not reaching 500 ,000 is
 

8575
03:06:48,080 --> 03:06:50,790
threshold and not reaching 500 ,000 is
probably relevant and the second element

8576
03:06:50,790 --> 03:06:50,800
probably relevant and the second element
 

8577
03:06:50,800 --> 03:06:53,030
probably relevant and the second element
is there has to be an intent in other

8578
03:06:53,030 --> 03:06:53,040
is there has to be an intent in other
 

8579
03:06:53,040 --> 03:06:55,190
is there has to be an intent in other
words and you believe there's an intent

8580
03:06:55,190 --> 03:06:55,200
words and you believe there's an intent
 

8581
03:06:55,200 --> 03:06:58,630
words and you believe there's an intent
yes I think if if there is any other

8582
03:06:58,630 --> 03:06:58,640
yes I think if if there is any other
 

8583
03:06:58,640 --> 03:07:01,190
yes I think if if there is any other
plausible reason for why all these

8584
03:07:01,190 --> 03:07:01,200
plausible reason for why all these
 

8585
03:07:01,200 --> 03:07:03,349
plausible reason for why all these
people are being murdered it's not

8586
03:07:03,349 --> 03:07:03,359
people are being murdered it's not
 

8587
03:07:03,359 --> 03:07:05,910
people are being murdered it's not
genocide and as far as intent what about

8588
03:07:05,910 --> 03:07:05,920
genocide and as far as intent what about
 

8589
03:07:05,920 --> 03:07:08,229
genocide and as far as intent what about
hiding behind a human shield you don't

8590
03:07:08,229 --> 03:07:08,239
hiding behind a human shield you don't
 

8591
03:07:08,239 --> 03:07:09,590
hiding behind a human shield you don't
think that's the reason for them being

8592
03:07:09,590 --> 03:07:09,600
think that's the reason for them being
 

8593
03:07:09,600 --> 03:07:11,269
think that's the reason for them being
killed well let's get the intent part

8594
03:07:11,269 --> 03:07:11,279
killed well let's get the intent part
 

8595

03:10:04,680 --> 03:10:06,950
think of it as an indictment sure
possibly maybe even a a lower level than

03:10:06,950 --> 03:10:06,960
possibly maybe even a a lower level than
 

8737
03:10:06,960 --> 03:10:08,950
possibly maybe even a a lower level than
even an indictment so plausibility is an

8738
03:10:08,950 --> 03:10:08,960
even an indictment so plausibility is an
 

8739
03:10:08,960 --> 03:10:11,389
even an indictment so plausibility is an
incredibly low standard number one um

8740
03:10:11,389 --> 03:10:11,399

8741
03:10:11,399 --> 03:10:13,830
incredibly low standard number one um

03:36:18,080 --> 03:36:21,309
lot of
discussion about a two-state settlement

9994
03:36:21,309 --> 03:36:21,319
discussion about a two-state settlement
 

9995
03:36:21,319 --> 03:36:23,550
discussion about a two-state settlement
my own View and I've I've written about

9996
03:36:23,550 --> 03:36:23,560
my own View and I've I've written about
 

9997
03:36:23,560 --> 03:36:27,469
my own View and I've I've written about
this uh I don't I don't bu the arguments

9998
03:36:27,469 --> 03:36:27,479
this uh I don't I don't bu the arguments
 

9999
03:36:27,479 --> 03:36:30,830
this uh I don't I don't bu the arguments
of the naysayers that we have passed uh

10000
03:36:30,830 --> 03:36:30,840
of the naysayers that we have passed uh
 

10001
03:36:30,840 --> 03:36:32,990
of the naysayers that we have passed uh
the so-called point of no return with

10002
03:36:32,990 --> 03:36:33,000
the so-called point of no return with
 

10003
03:36:33,000 --> 03:36:35,229
the so-called point of no return with
respect to a two-state settlement

10004
03:36:35,229 --> 03:36:35,239
respect to a two-state settlement
 

10005
03:36:35,239 --> 03:36:38,790
respect to a two-state settlement
certainly if you look at the Israeli

10006
03:36:38,790 --> 03:36:38,800
certainly if you look at the Israeli
 

10007
03:36:38,800 --> 03:36:42,189
certainly if you look at the Israeli
position in the occupied territories I

10008
03:36:42,189 --> 03:36:42,199
position in the occupied territories I
 

10009
03:36:42,199 --> 03:36:44,990
position in the occupied territories I
would argue it's more tenuous than was

10010
03:36:44,990 --> 03:36:45,000
would argue it's more tenuous than was
 

10011
03:36:45,000 --> 03:36:47,469
would argue it's more tenuous than was
the French position in Algeria in

10012
03:36:47,469 --> 03:36:47,479
the French position in Algeria in
 

10013
03:36:47,479 --> 03:36:49,990
the French position in Algeria in
1954 then was a British position in

10014
03:36:49,990 --> 03:36:50,000
1954 then was a British position in
 

10015
03:36:50,000 --> 03:36:51,189
1954 then was a British position in
Ireland in

10016
03:36:51,189 --> 03:36:51,199
Ireland in
 

10017
03:36:51,199 --> 03:36:54,590
Ireland in
1916 then was the Ethiopian position in

10018
03:36:54,590 --> 03:36:54,600
1916 then was the Ethiopian position in
 

10019
03:36:54,600 --> 03:36:59,590
1916 then was the Ethiopian position in
uh itria in 1990 and so as a matter of

10020
03:36:59,590 --> 03:36:59,600
uh itria in 1990 and so as a matter of
 

10021
03:36:59,600 --> 03:37:02,710
uh itria in 1990 and so as a matter of
practicality as a matter of principle I

10022
03:37:02,710 --> 03:37:02,720
practicality as a matter of principle I
 

10023
03:37:02,720 --> 03:37:06,790
practicality as a matter of principle I
do think um the establishment of a

10024
03:37:06,790 --> 03:37:06,800
do think um the establishment of a
 

10025
03:37:06,800 --> 03:37:10,469
do think um the establishment of a
Palestinian State uh in in the occupied

10026
03:37:10,469 --> 03:37:10,479
Palestinian State uh in in the occupied
 

10027
03:37:10,479 --> 03:37:12,309
Palestinian State uh in in the occupied
territories remains realistic I think

10028
03:37:12,309 --> 03:37:12,319
territories remains realistic I think
 

10029
03:37:12,319 --> 03:37:14,510
territories remains realistic I think
the question that we now need to ask

10030
03:37:14,510 --> 03:37:14,520
the question that we now need to ask
 

10031
03:37:14,520 --> 03:37:17,910
the question that we now need to ask
ourselves it's one I'm certainly asking

10032
03:37:17,910 --> 03:37:17,920
ourselves it's one I'm certainly asking
 

10033
03:37:17,920 --> 03:37:22,950

03:37:25,550 --> 03:37:25,560
at Israel's genocidal campaign but also
 

10037
03:37:25,560 --> 03:37:27,790
at Israel's genocidal campaign but also
looking at larger questions is it

03:37:27,790 --> 03:37:27,800
looking at larger questions is it
 

10039
03:37:27,800 --> 03:37:34,030
looking at larger questions is it
desirable can you have peace with what

03:37:37,359 --> 03:37:41,550
increasingly appears to be an

03:37:55,880 --> 03:37:58,150
challenges with violence by applying
even more violence that has an

03:38:05,469 --> 03:38:05,479
territory um that you know a genocidal
 

10063
03:38:05,479 --> 03:38:09,510
territory um that you know a genocidal
apartheid state that seems increasingly

03:38:09,510 --> 03:38:09,520
apartheid state that seems increasingly
 

10065
03:38:09,520 --> 03:38:13,189
apartheid state that seems increasingly
incapable of even conceiving of peaceful

03:38:13,189 --> 03:38:13,199
incapable of even conceiving of peaceful
 

10067
03:38:13,199 --> 03:38:16,469
incapable of even conceiving of peaceful

coexistence um uh with with the other
 

10069
03:38:16,479 --> 03:38:19,790
coexistence um uh with with the other
people on that land um so I'm very

10070
03:38:19,790 --> 03:38:19,800
people on that land um so I'm very
 

10071
03:38:19,800 --> 03:38:22,389
people on that land um so I'm very
pessimistic that a a solution is

03:38:22,389 --> 03:38:22,399
pessimistic that a a solution is
 

10073
03:38:22,399 --> 03:38:25,950
pessimistic that a a solution is
possible I look at um I grew up um in

10074
03:38:25,950 --> 03:38:25,960
possible I look at um I grew up um in
 

10075
03:38:25,960 --> 03:38:29,030
possible I look at um I grew up um in
Western Europe in the long shadow of the

10076
03:38:29,030 --> 03:38:29,040
Western Europe in the long shadow of the
 

10077
03:38:29,040 --> 03:38:32,269
Western Europe in the long shadow of the
second world war um I think we can all

10078
03:38:32,269 --> 03:38:32,279
second world war um I think we can all
 

10079
03:38:32,279 --> 03:38:34,070
second world war um I think we can all
agree that there could have been no

10080
03:38:34,070 --> 03:38:34,080
agree that there could have been no
 

10081
03:38:34,080 --> 03:38:38,670
agree that there could have been no
peace in Europe um had certain regimes

10082
03:38:38,670 --> 03:38:38,680
peace in Europe um had certain regimes
 

10083
03:38:38,680 --> 03:38:41,389
peace in Europe um had certain regimes
on that continent not been removed from

10084
03:38:41,389 --> 03:38:41,399
on that continent not been removed from
 

10085
03:38:41,399 --> 03:38:44,910
on that continent not been removed from
Power um I look at um uh southeast Asia

10086
03:38:44,910 --> 03:38:44,920
Power um I look at um uh southeast Asia
 

10087
03:38:44,920 --> 03:38:46,030
Power um I look at um uh southeast Asia
and the late

10088
03:38:46,030 --> 03:38:46,040
and the late
 

10089
03:38:46,040 --> 03:38:49,189
and the late
1970s and I think we're all agreed that

10090
03:38:49,189 --> 03:38:49,199
1970s and I think we're all agreed that
 

10091
03:38:49,199 --> 03:38:51,349
1970s and I think we're all agreed that
there could not have been peace in that

10092
03:38:51,349 --> 03:38:51,359
there could not have been peace in that
 

10093
03:38:51,359 --> 03:38:54,590
there could not have been peace in that
region had the K Rouge uh not been

10094
03:38:54,590 --> 03:38:54,600
region had the K Rouge uh not been
 

10095
03:38:54,600 --> 03:38:57,309
region had the K Rouge uh not been
ousted I look at Southern Africa during

10096
03:38:57,309 --> 03:38:57,319
ousted I look at Southern Africa during
 

10097
03:38:57,319 --> 03:38:58,510
ousted I look at Southern Africa during
the

10098
03:38:58,510 --> 03:38:58,520
the
 

10099
03:38:58,520 --> 03:39:01,389
the
1990s and I think we can all be agreed

10100
03:39:01,389 --> 03:39:01,399
1990s and I think we can all be agreed
 

10101
03:39:01,399 --> 03:39:04,630
1990s and I think we can all be agreed
that had the white minority regimes of

10102
03:39:04,630 --> 03:39:04,640
that had the white minority regimes of
 

10103
03:39:04,640 --> 03:39:07,150
that had the white minority regimes of
um that ruled Zimbabwe and South Africa

10104
03:39:07,150 --> 03:39:07,160
um that ruled Zimbabwe and South Africa
 

10105
03:39:07,160 --> 03:39:09,550
um that ruled Zimbabwe and South Africa
not been dismantled there could not have

10106
03:39:09,550 --> 03:39:09,560
not been dismantled there could not have
 

10107
03:39:09,560 --> 03:39:12,469
not been dismantled there could not have
been peace in that region and although I

10108
03:39:12,469 --> 03:39:12,479
been peace in that region and although I
 

10109
03:39:12,479 --> 03:39:14,110
been peace in that region and although I
think it's worth having a

10110
03:39:14,110 --> 03:39:14,120
think it's worth having a
 

10111
03:39:14,120 --> 03:39:16,910
think it's worth having a
discussion um I do think it's now a

10112
03:39:16,910 --> 03:39:16,920
discussion um I do think it's now a
 

10113
03:39:16,920 --> 03:39:20,790
discussion um I do think it's now a
legitimate question to ask can there be

10114
03:39:20,790 --> 03:39:20,800
legitimate question to ask can there be
 

10115
03:39:20,800 --> 03:39:23,349
legitimate question to ask can there be
peace um

10116
03:39:23,349 --> 03:39:23,359
peace um
 

10117
03:39:23,359 --> 03:39:27,389
peace um
without dismantling uh the Zionist uh

10118
03:39:27,389 --> 03:39:27,399
without dismantling uh the Zionist uh
 

10119
03:39:27,399 --> 03:39:29,630
without dismantling uh the Zionist uh
regime and I make a very clear

10120
03:39:29,630 --> 03:39:29,640
regime and I make a very clear
 

10121
03:39:29,640 --> 03:39:31,550
regime and I make a very clear
distinction between the Israeli state

10122
03:39:31,550 --> 03:39:31,560
distinction between the Israeli state
 

10123
03:39:31,560 --> 03:39:34,469
distinction between the Israeli state
and its institutions on the one hand um

10124
03:39:34,469 --> 03:39:34,479
and its institutions on the one hand um
 

10125
03:39:34,479 --> 03:39:37,229
and its institutions on the one hand um
and the Israeli people who I think

10126
03:39:37,229 --> 03:39:37,239
and the Israeli people who I think
 

10127
03:39:37,239 --> 03:39:40,469
and the Israeli people who I think
regardless of our discussion uh about

10128
03:39:40,469 --> 03:39:40,479
regardless of our discussion uh about
 

10129
03:39:40,479 --> 03:39:42,229
regardless of our discussion uh about
the history I think you can now talk

10130
03:39:42,229 --> 03:39:42,239
the history I think you can now talk
 

10131
03:39:42,239 --> 03:39:45,150
the history I think you can now talk
about an Israeli people and a people um

10132
03:39:45,150 --> 03:39:45,160
about an Israeli people and a people um
 

10133
03:39:45,160 --> 03:39:48,710
about an Israeli people and a people um
that have developed uh rights over time

10134
03:39:48,710 --> 03:39:48,720
that have developed uh rights over time
 

10135
03:39:48,720 --> 03:39:53,269
that have developed uh rights over time
and um a formula for peaceful

10136
03:39:53,269 --> 03:39:53,279
and um a formula for peaceful
 

10137
03:39:53,279 --> 03:39:56,389
and um a formula for peaceful
coexistence with them uh will need to be

10138
03:39:56,389 --> 03:39:56,399
coexistence with them uh will need to be
 

10139
03:39:56,399 --> 03:39:59,830
coexistence with them uh will need to be
found which is a separate matter from uh

10140
03:39:59,830 --> 03:39:59,840
found which is a separate matter from uh
 

10141
03:39:59,840 --> 03:40:02,269
found which is a separate matter from uh
dismantling um the Israeli state and its

10142
03:40:02,269 --> 03:40:02,279
dismantling um the Israeli state and its
 

10143
03:40:02,279 --> 03:40:04,590
dismantling um the Israeli state and its
institutions and again I haven't reached

10144
03:40:04,590 --> 03:40:04,600
institutions and again I haven't reached
 

10145
03:40:04,600 --> 03:40:06,550
institutions and again I haven't reached
clear conclusions about this except to

10146
03:40:06,550 --> 03:40:06,560

in Israel or abroad that eventually a

don't think it's gotten them any closer

10262

10263
03:42:37,000 --> 03:42:38,309
don't think it's gotten them any closer

taken them farther and farther and
 

10267
03:42:39,520 --> 03:42:41,750
taken them farther and farther and
farther away from one and I think as

10268
03:42:41,750 --> 03:42:41,760
farther away from one and I think as
 

10269
03:42:41,760 --> 03:42:43,750
farther away from one and I think as
long as the hyperbolic language is

10270
03:42:43,750 --> 03:42:43,760
long as the hyperbolic language is
 

10271

continually employed internationally

rejected it but the resolution didn't
pass because the US and the UK vetoed it

11522
04:10:03,950 --> 04:10:03,960
pass because the US and the UK vetoed it
 

11523
04:10:03,960 --> 04:10:06,550
pass because the US and the UK vetoed it
it was both of them I think it was N9

11524
04:10:06,550 --> 04:10:06,560
it was both of them I think it was N9
 

11525
04:10:06,560 --> 04:10:11,910
it was both of them I think it was N9
to5 yeah but but fact of the matter is

11526
04:10:11,910 --> 04:10:11,920
to5 yeah but but fact of the matter is
 

11527
04:10:11,920 --> 04:10:16,030
to5 yeah but but fact of the matter is
that the PLO came to accept um a

11528
04:10:16,030 --> 04:10:16,040
that the PLO came to accept um a
 

11529
04:10:16,040 --> 04:10:18,990
that the PLO came to accept um a
two-state settlement why they did it I

11530
04:10:18,990 --> 04:10:19,000
two-state settlement why they did it I
 

11531
04:10:19,000 --> 04:10:20,030
two-state settlement why they did it I
think is

11532
04:10:20,030 --> 04:10:20,040
think is
 

11533
04:10:20,040 --> 04:10:24,109
think is
irrelevant um and subsequently the PLO

11534
04:10:24,109 --> 04:10:24,119
irrelevant um and subsequently the PLO
 

11535
04:10:24,119 --> 04:10:26,630
irrelevant um and subsequently the PLO
acted on the basis of seeking to achieve

11536
04:10:26,630 --> 04:10:26,640
acted on the basis of seeking to achieve
 

11537
04:10:26,640 --> 04:10:29,030
acted on the basis of seeking to achieve
a two-state sett the reason I think and

11538
04:10:29,030 --> 04:10:29,040
a two-state sett the reason I think and
 

11539
04:10:29,040 --> 04:10:31,389
a two-state sett the reason I think and
I think Norm you've written about this

11540
04:10:31,389 --> 04:10:31,399
I think Norm you've written about this
 

11541
04:10:31,399 --> 04:10:34,550
I think Norm you've written about this
the reason that Arafat was so

11542
04:10:34,550 --> 04:10:34,560
the reason that Arafat was so
 

11543
04:10:34,560 --> 04:10:39,070
the reason that Arafat was so
insistent on getting um uh the minimally

11544
04:10:39,070 --> 04:10:39,080
insistent on getting um uh the minimally
 

11545
04:10:39,080 --> 04:10:40,910
insistent on getting um uh the minimally
acceptable terms for a two-state

11546
04:10:40,910 --> 04:10:40,920
acceptable terms for a two-state
 

11547
04:10:40,920 --> 04:10:44,030
acceptable terms for a two-state
settlement at Camp David and afterwards

11548
04:10:44,030 --> 04:10:44,040
settlement at Camp David and afterwards
 

11549
04:10:44,040 --> 04:10:46,269
settlement at Camp David and afterwards
was precisely because he knew that once

simply want to springboard he would have

11558
04:10:56,590 --> 04:10:56,600
simply want to springboard he would have
 

11559
04:10:56,600 --> 04:10:59,469
simply want to springboard he would have
accepted a Palestinian state in Jericho

11560
04:10:59,469 --> 04:10:59,479
accepted a Palestinian state in Jericho
 

11561

11565
04:11:03,000 --> 04:11:05,349
I've never understood he should have
logically accepted the springboard and

11566
04:11:05,349 --> 04:11:05,359
logically accepted the springboard and
 

11567
04:11:05,359 --> 04:11:07,429
logically accepted the springboard and
then from there launched his next stage

11568
04:11:07,429 --> 04:11:07,439
then from there launched his next stage
 

11569
04:11:07,439 --> 04:11:11,070
then from there launched his next stage
don't understand he international law

04:11:13,790 --> 04:11:13,800
would put a real constraint on
 

11573
04:11:13,800 --> 04:11:15,630
would put a real constraint on
no but also he accepted it was over

no but also he accepted it was over
 

11575
04:11:15,640 --> 04:11:17,349
no but also he accepted it was over
constitutionally he was incapable of

04:11:17,349 --> 04:11:17,359
constitutionally he was incapable of
 

11577
04:11:17,359 --> 04:11:20,510
constitutionally he was incapable of
signing know you're right that he he

11578
04:11:20,510 --> 04:11:20,520
signing know you're right that he he
 

11579
04:11:20,520 --> 04:11:22,030
signing know you're right that he he
should have accepted it but if you're

11580
04:11:22,030 --> 04:11:22,040
should have accepted it but if you're
 

11581
04:11:22,040 --> 04:11:25,510
should have accepted it but if you're
correct okay that that he was really out

11582
04:11:25,510 --> 04:11:25,520
correct okay that that he was really out
 

11583
04:11:25,520 --> 04:11:28,229
correct okay that that he was really out
to eliminate Israel then then he

11584
04:11:28,229 --> 04:11:28,239
to eliminate Israel then then he
 

11585
04:11:28,239 --> 04:11:29,990
to eliminate Israel then then he
wouldn't have cared about the borders he

11586
04:11:29,990 --> 04:11:30,000
wouldn't have cared about the borders he
 

11587
04:11:30,000 --> 04:11:31,349
wouldn't have cared about the borders he
wouldn't have cared about what the thing

11588
04:11:31,349 --> 04:11:31,359
wouldn't have cared about what the thing
 

11589
04:11:31,359 --> 04:11:32,950
wouldn't have cared about what the thing
said about refugees he would have gotten

11590
04:11:32,950 --> 04:11:32,960
said about refugees he would have gotten
 

11591
04:11:32,960 --> 04:11:34,790
said about refugees he would have gotten
a sovereign state and used that to

11592
04:11:34,790 --> 04:11:34,800
a sovereign state and used that to
 

11593
04:11:34,800 --> 04:11:37,030
a sovereign state and used that to
achieve that purpose but but I think it

11594
04:11:37,030 --> 04:11:37,040
achieve that purpose but but I think it
 

11595
04:11:37,040 --> 04:11:39,429
achieve that purpose but but I think it
was precisely because he recognized that

11596
04:11:39,429 --> 04:11:39,439
was precisely because he recognized that
 

11597
04:11:39,439 --> 04:11:41,349
was precisely because he recognized that
he was not negotiating for a springboard

11598

he was not negotiating for a springboard
 

11599

he was not negotiating for a springboard
he was negotiating permanent status that

04:11:44,590 --> 04:11:44,600
he was negotiating permanent status that
 

11601
04:11:44,600 --> 04:11:47,550
he was negotiating permanent status that
he was such a stickler about the details

11602
04:11:47,550 --> 04:11:47,560
he was such a stickler about the details
 

11603
04:11:47,560 --> 04:11:49,990
he was such a stickler about the details
the second just as a factual matter he

11604
04:11:49,990 --> 04:11:50,000
the second just as a factual matter he
 

11605
04:11:50,000 --> 04:11:53,269
the second just as a factual matter he
wasn't such a stickler when they asked

11606
04:11:53,269 --> 04:11:53,279
wasn't such a stickler when they asked
 

11607
04:11:53,279 --> 04:11:56,550
wasn't such a stickler when they asked
him how many refugees the numbers it was

11608
04:11:56,550 --> 04:11:56,560
him how many refugees the numbers it was
 

11609
04:11:56,560 --> 04:11:57,990
him how many refugees the numbers it was
a principal rather than the num

11610
04:11:57,990 --> 04:11:58,000
a principal rather than the num
 

11611
04:11:58,000 --> 04:11:59,710
a principal rather than the num
principal he said I would be pragmatic

11612

principal he said I would be pragmatic
 

11613
04:11:59,720 --> 04:12:02,309

about it and the numbers that were used

11638
04:12:37,630 --> 04:12:37,640
250,000 over 10 years now the best offer
 

11639
04:12:37,640 --> 04:12:39,590
250,000 over 10 years now the best offer
that came from the Palestinians excuse

that came from the Palestinians excuse
 

11641

me the best offer that came from Israel
 

11643
04:12:42,520 --> 04:12:46,189
me the best offer that came from Israel
was the allart offer can we just pretend

11644
04:12:46,189 --> 04:12:46,199
was the allart offer can we just pretend
 

11645
04:12:46,199 --> 04:12:47,950
was the allart offer can we just pretend
like we didn't all lay out the

11646
04:12:47,950 --> 04:12:47,960
like we didn't all lay out the
 

11647
04:12:47,960 --> 04:12:51,510
like we didn't all lay out the
exceptionally pessimistic uh view of a

11648
04:12:51,510 --> 04:12:51,520
exceptionally pessimistic uh view of a
 

11649
04:12:51,520 --> 04:12:52,830
exceptionally pessimistic uh view of a
two-state hold on a second two-state

11651
04:12:52,840 --> 04:12:55,710
two-state hold on a second two-state
solution let's pretend that in 5 years

11652
04:12:55,710 --> 04:12:55,720
solution let's pretend that in 5 years
 

11653
04:12:55,720 --> 04:12:58,910
solution let's pretend that in 5 years
and 10 years a a two-state peace

11657
04:13:00,680 --> 04:13:03,510
settlement is
reached and and as historians you will

11658
04:13:03,510 --> 04:13:03,520
reached and and as historians you will
 

11659
04:13:03,520 --> 04:13:05,469
reached and and as historians you will
still be here and writing about it 20

still be here and writing about it 20
 

11661
04:13:05,479 --> 04:13:08,229
still be here and writing about it 20
years from now how would it have

11662
04:13:08,229 --> 04:13:08,239
years from now how would it have
 

11663
04:13:08,239 --> 04:13:10,389
years from now how would it have
happened I think that historically I

11664
04:13:10,389 --> 04:13:10,399
happened I think that historically I
 

11665
04:13:10,399 --> 04:13:12,309
happened I think that historically I
think that the big issue is I think that

11666
04:13:12,309 --> 04:13:12,319
think that the big issue is I think that
 

11667
04:13:12,319 --> 04:13:14,109
think that the big issue is I think that
both sides have had their own internal

both sides have had their own internal
 

11669

both sides have had their own internal
motivations to fight because they feel

motivations to fight because they feel
like they have something to gain from it

the the the biggest thing that would
 

11833
04:15:40,399 --> 04:15:42,550
the the the biggest thing that would
force Israel to change its path would be

11834
04:15:42,550 --> 04:15:42,560
force Israel to change its path would be
 

11835
04:15:42,560 --> 04:15:45,590
force Israel to change its path would be
an actual a real not for like two weeks

11836
04:15:45,590 --> 04:15:45,600
an actual a real not for like two weeks
 

11837
04:15:45,600 --> 04:15:47,630
an actual a real not for like two weeks
but an actual peaceful Palestinian

11838
04:15:47,630 --> 04:15:47,640
but an actual peaceful Palestinian
 

11839
04:15:47,640 --> 04:15:49,830
but an actual peaceful Palestinian
leader somebody committed to peace that

11840
04:15:49,830 --> 04:15:49,840
leader somebody committed to peace that
 

11841
04:15:49,840 --> 04:15:51,269
leader somebody committed to peace that
is able to apply those standards and

11842
04:15:51,269 --> 04:15:51,279
is able to apply those standards and
 

11843
04:15:51,279 --> 04:15:53,070
is able to apply those standards and
hold the entire region of Palestine to

11844
04:15:53,070 --> 04:15:53,080
hold the entire region of Palestine to
 

11845
04:15:53,080 --> 04:15:54,750
hold the entire region of Palestine to
those standards because I think over

11846
04:15:54,750 --> 04:15:54,760
those standards because I think over
 

11847
04:15:54,760 --> 04:15:57,670
those standards because I think over
time the mounting pressure from without

11848
04:15:57,670 --> 04:15:57,680
time the mounting pressure from without
 

11849
04:15:57,680 --> 04:15:59,189
time the mounting pressure from without
the the the International Community and

11850
04:15:59,189 --> 04:15:59,199
the the the International Community and
 

11851
04:15:59,199 --> 04:16:00,469
the the the International Community and
the mounting pressure from within

11852
04:16:00,469 --> 04:16:00,479
the mounting pressure from within
 

11853
04:16:00,479 --> 04:16:01,790
the mounting pressure from within
because Israel hosts a lot of its own

11854
04:16:01,790 --> 04:16:01,800
because Israel hosts a lot of its own
 

11855
04:16:01,800 --> 04:16:03,550
because Israel hosts a lot of its own
criticism if we talk about bet Salem we

11856
04:16:03,550 --> 04:16:03,560
criticism if we talk about bet Salem we
 

11857
04:16:03,560 --> 04:16:05,109
criticism if we talk about bet Salem we
talk her like Israel will host a lot of

11858
04:16:05,109 --> 04:16:05,119
talk her like Israel will host a lot of
 

11859
04:16:05,119 --> 04:16:06,349
talk her like Israel will host a lot of
its own criticism I think that that

11860
04:16:06,349 --> 04:16:06,359
its own criticism I think that that
 

11861
04:16:06,359 --> 04:16:08,389
its own criticism I think that that
pressure would force Israel towards an

11862
04:16:08,389 --> 04:16:08,399
pressure would force Israel towards an
 

11863
04:16:08,399 --> 04:16:10,429
pressure would force Israel towards an
actual peace agreement but it's never

11864
04:16:10,429 --> 04:16:10,439
actual peace agreement but it's never
 

11865
04:16:10,439 --> 04:16:11,389
actual peace agreement but it's never
going to come through violence

11866
04:16:11,389 --> 04:16:11,399
going to come through violence
 

11867
04:16:11,399 --> 04:16:13,550
going to come through violence
historically it hasn't um and in the

04:16:15,159 --> 04:16:16,710
modern day violence has just hurt the
Palestinians more and more if you paint

a picture of the future now is a good
 

11875
04:16:18,680 --> 04:16:21,710
a picture of the future now is a good
moment for both Palestine and Israel to

start in in a place that Israel is
willing to

you have to do it
consistently you can't um set standards

11932
04:17:19,149 --> 04:17:19,159
consistently you can't um set standards
 

11933

consistently you can't um set standards
for the

11934
04:17:20,510 --> 04:17:20,520
for the
 

11935
04:17:20,520 --> 04:17:24,309
for the
Palestinians um but reject uh applying

04:17:24,309 --> 04:17:24,319
Palestinians um but reject uh applying
 

11937
04:17:24,319 --> 04:17:27,630
Palestinians um but reject uh applying
those standards to Israel um if we're

11938
04:17:27,630 --> 04:17:27,640
those standards to Israel um if we're
 

11939
04:17:27,640 --> 04:17:30,109
those standards to Israel um if we're
going to have the law of the Jungle then

11940
04:17:30,109 --> 04:17:30,119
going to have the law of the Jungle then
 

11941
04:17:30,119 --> 04:17:32,429
going to have the law of the Jungle then
we can all be beasts and not only some

I was saying earlier and then the

I was saying earlier and then the
discussion got sidetracked is um that I

13218
04:44:32,030 --> 04:44:32,040
discussion got sidetracked is um that I
 

13219
04:44:32,040 --> 04:44:34,628
discussion got sidetracked is um that I
did believe that a two-state

13220
04:44:34,628 --> 04:44:34,638
did believe that a two-state
 

13221
04:44:34,638 --> 04:44:37,750
did believe that a two-state
settlement um a partition of

13222
04:44:37,750 --> 04:44:37,760
settlement um a partition of
 

13223
04:44:37,760 --> 04:44:42,230

13225
04:44:42,240 --> 04:44:45,350
Palestine um along the 1967 uh

04:44:45,350 --> 04:44:45,360
boundaries um would have been a
 

13227
04:44:45,360 --> 04:44:47,910
boundaries um would have been a
reasonable um solution because I think

13228
04:44:47,910 --> 04:44:47,920
reasonable um solution because I think
 

13229
04:44:47,920 --> 04:44:53,550
reasonable um solution because I think
it also would have opened Pathways to um

13230
04:44:53,550 --> 04:44:53,560
it also would have opened Pathways to um
 

13231

13267
04:45:41,440 --> 04:45:44,030
settlement and I don't think
it would be that difficult because I

13268
04:45:44,030 --> 04:45:44,040
it would be that difficult because I
 

13269
04:45:44,040 --> 04:45:46,788
it would be that difficult because I
