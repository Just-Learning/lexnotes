00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,640
Ai and science fiction and such in the
 

167
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,789
Ai and science fiction and such in the
first place wasn't a book but the

168
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:34,799
first place wasn't a book but the
 

169
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,550
first place wasn't a book but the

170
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:37,560
original Star Trek TV show which my dad
 

171
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,789
original Star Trek TV show which my dad
watched with me like in its first run it

172
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:39,799
watched with me like in its first run it
 

173
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:42,789
watched with me like in its first run it
would have been 1968 69 or something and

174
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:42,799
would have been 1968 69 or something and
 

175
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,910
would have been 1968 69 or something and
that that was incredible CU every every

176
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:44,920
that that was incredible CU every every
 

177
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,229
that that was incredible CU every every
show they visited a different a

178
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:47,239
show they visited a different a
 

179
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:49,229
show they visited a different a
different alien civilization with

180
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:49,239
different alien civilization with
 

181
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:51,229
different alien civilization with
different culture and weird mechanisms

182
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:51,239
different culture and weird mechanisms
 

183
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,069
different culture and weird mechanisms
but that that got me into science

184
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:54,079
but that that got me into science
 

185
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:56,390
but that that got me into science
fiction and there wasn't that much

186
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
fiction and there wasn't that much
 

187
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,270
fiction and there wasn't that much
science fiction to watch on TV at that

188
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:58,280
science fiction to watch on TV at that
 

189
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,869
science fiction to watch on TV at that
stage so that got me into reading the

190
00:03:59,869 --> 00:03:59,879
stage so that got me into reading the
 

191
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,990
stage so that got me into reading the
whole the whole literature of Science

192
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,000
whole the whole literature of Science
 

193
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,990

00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:52,199
you think there are intelligences maybe
 

323
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,350
you think there are intelligences maybe
all around us that were not able to even

324
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:55,360
all around us that were not able to even
 

325
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,909
all around us that were not able to even
detect so this kind of idea of uh maybe

326
00:06:58,909 --> 00:06:58,919
detect so this kind of idea of uh maybe
 

327
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,510
detect so this kind of idea of uh maybe
you can comment also on Steven Wolfram

328
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:01,520
you can comment also on Steven Wolfram
 

329
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,150
you can comment also on Steven Wolfram
thinking that there's computations all

330
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:03,160
thinking that there's computations all
 

331
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,550
thinking that there's computations all
around us and we're just not smart

00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:05,560
around us and we're just not smart
 

333
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,150
around us and we're just not smart
enough to kind of detect their their

shrink themselves little and little
 

365
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,629

00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,430
there's not a damn thing we can do about
it except you know try to upgrade our

it except you know try to upgrade our
 

413
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,589
it except you know try to upgrade our
intelligences and expand our mind so

414
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:38,599
intelligences and expand our mind so
 

415
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:40,389
intelligences and expand our mind so
that we can we can perceive more of

to like quantum mechanics if that if

to like quantum mechanics if that if

00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:50,710
to like quantum mechanics if that if
that's actually uh super intelligent

that's actually uh super intelligent

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,310
that's actually uh super intelligent
systems aren't we then part of the soup

00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,870
of super intelligence that we're aren't
we just like like a finger of the

430
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:57,880
we just like like a finger of the
 

431
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,750
we just like like a finger of the

mean a finger is a is a strange metaphor

436
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,000
mean a finger is a is a strange metaphor
 

437
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,069
mean a finger is a is a strange metaphor
I mean we we we a finger is dumb is what

438
00:09:09,069 --> 00:09:09,079
I mean we we we a finger is dumb is what
 

439
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:11,710
I mean we we we a finger is dumb is what
I mean is uh is but a finger is also

440
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:11,720
I mean is uh is but a finger is also
 

441
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,430
I mean is uh is but a finger is also
useful and is controlled with with

442
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
useful and is controlled with with
 

443
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,590
useful and is controlled with with
intent by by the brain where we may be

444
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:15,600
intent by by the brain where we may be
 

445
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,710
intent by by the brain where we may be
much less than that right I mean I mean

446
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:17,720
much less than that right I mean I mean
 

447
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,590
much less than that right I mean I mean
yeah we may be just some random EPA

448
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:20,600
yeah we may be just some random EPA
 

449
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,710
yeah we may be just some random EPA

about too much like think about the the
 

453
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,670
about too much like think about the the

there's some Emer shape to the crowd
 

459
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,430
there's some Emer shape to the crowd
it's there you could take a picture of

00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:32,440
it's there you could take a picture of
 

461
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,509
it's there you could take a picture of
it it's kind of cool it's irrelevant to

it it's kind of cool it's irrelevant to
 

463
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:36,389
it it's kind of cool it's irrelevant to
the main point of the sports event or

469
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,470
what's on the minds of the people making
that shape in the crowd right so we we

470
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:42,480
that shape in the crowd right so we we
 

471
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,150
that shape in the crowd right so we we

like can a machine really think how how
 

603
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,790
like can a machine really think how how
would you do that and yeah just ambition

604
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:24,800
would you do that and yeah just ambition
 

605
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,509
would you do that and yeah just ambition
to create something much better than all

you go far beyond the limitations of the
 

623
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,629
you go far beyond the limitations of the
human but it could also like stop us

624
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:48,639
human but it could also like stop us
 

625
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,590

from dying and and suffering and and and

626
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:51,600

ourselves mentally you can see AGI has

630
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:56,399
ourselves mentally you can see AGI has
 

631
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,590
ourselves mentally you can see AGI has
amazing capability to do good for humans

632
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:00,600
amazing capability to do good for humans
 

633
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,829
amazing capability to do good for humans
as humans alongside with with its

634
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:02,839
as humans alongside with with its
 

635
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:05,710
as humans alongside with with its
capability to go far far beyond the

00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:05,720
capability to go far far beyond the
 

637
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,150
capability to go far far beyond the
human level so I mean both both aspects

638
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:09,160
human level so I mean both both aspects
 

639
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,389
human level so I mean both both aspects
are are there which makes it uh even

mechanics books when I was like seven or
 

933
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,630
mechanics books when I was like seven or
eight years old you know I remember

934
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:24,640
eight years old you know I remember
 

935
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,070
eight years old you know I remember
going through them and it was all the

936
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:27,080
going through them and it was all the
 

937
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,350
going through them and it was all the
old Quant mechanics like r Rutherford

938

Adams and stuff so I got to the part of

940
00:19:32,029 --> 00:19:32,039
Adams and stuff so I got to the part of
 

941
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:34,190
Adams and stuff so I got to the part of
wave functions which I didn't understand

942
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:34,200
wave functions which I didn't understand
 

943
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,750
wave functions which I didn't understand
although I was very bright kid and I

944
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:36,760
although I was very bright kid and I
 

945
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,190
although I was very bright kid and I
realized he he didn't quite understand

946
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:38,200
realized he he didn't quite understand
 

947
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,110
realized he he didn't quite understand
it either but at least like he pointed

948
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:40,120
it either but at least like he pointed
 

949
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,350
it either but at least like he pointed
me to some Professor he knew at at upen

950
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:43,360
me to some Professor he knew at at upen
 

951
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,190
me to some Professor he knew at at upen
nearby who who understood these things

952
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,200
nearby who who understood these things
 

953
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,430
nearby who who understood these things
right so that's that that's an unusual

954
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:47,440
right so that's that that's an unusual
 

955
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,070
right so that's that that's an unusual

90s and early Arts I mean he he had a
book in the late 60s in in Russia which

1268
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:03,600
book in the late 60s in in Russia which
 

1269
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,110
book in the late 60s in in Russia which
was the phenomenon of science which laid

1270
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:06,120
was the phenomenon of science which laid
 

1271
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,630
was the phenomenon of science which laid
out laid out all these all these same

1272
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:08,640
out laid out all these all these same
 

1273
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,190
out laid out all these all these same
things as well and Val died in I don't

1277
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,669
remember 2004 five or something of

1278
00:26:18,669 --> 00:26:18,679
parkinsonism so yeah it's easy easy for
 

1279
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:21,430

people to lose track now of the fact

1280
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:21,440
people to lose track now of the fact
 

1281
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,669
people to lose track now of the fact
that the the futurist and

00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:34,029
the time I mean
these these are not that new right

1290

these these are not that new right
 

1291
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:35,990
these these are not that new right
they're sort of new in the history of

they're sort of new in the history of
 

1293
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,389
they're sort of new in the history of
the human species but I mean these were

00:26:57,269 --> 00:26:57,279
to a a certain point then you you
 

1309
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,070
to a a certain point then you you
couldn't make it real so and even in the

couldn't make it real so and even in the
 

1311
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,149
couldn't make it real so and even in the

Trek to Douglas Hoffer things were

1316
00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:08,279
Trek to Douglas Hoffer things were
 

1317
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:09,870
Trek to Douglas Hoffer things were
getting very very practical from the

1318
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:09,880
getting very very practical from the
 

1319
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,510
getting very very practical from the
late 60s to the late 70s and you know

1320
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:12,520
late 60s to the late 70s and you know
 

1321
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,230
late 60s to the late 70s and you know
the first computer I bought you could

1322
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:15,240
the first computer I bought you could
 

1323
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,510
the first computer I bought you could
only program with heximal machine code

1324
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:17,520
only program with heximal machine code
 

1325
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,190
only program with heximal machine code
and you had to solder it together and

1326
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:20,200
and you had to solder it together and
 

1327
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,350
and you had to solder it together and
then then like a few years later there's

1328
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:22,360
then then like a few years later there's
 

1329
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,110
then then like a few years later there's
Punch Cards and a few years later you

1330
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,120
Punch Cards and a few years later you
 

1331
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,870
Punch Cards and a few years later you
could get like Atari 400 and commodore

1332
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:27,880
could get like Atari 400 and commodore
 

1333

Victor 20 and you could you could type

1334
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:29,600
Victor 20 and you could you could type
 

1335
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,630
Victor 20 and you could you could type
on the keyboard and program in higher

1336
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:31,640
on the keyboard and program in higher
 

1337
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,669

level languages along alongside the
 

1339
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,990
level languages along alongside the
Assembly Language so these ideas have

1340
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:36,000
Assembly Language so these ideas have
 

1341
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,590
Assembly Language so these ideas have
been building up a while and I guess my

1342
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:39,600
been building up a while and I guess my
 

1343
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,950
been building up a while and I guess my
generation got to feel them build up

1344
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:42,960
generation got to feel them build up
 

1345
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,230
generation got to feel them build up
which is different than people coming

1346
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:44,240
which is different than people coming
 

1347
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,950
which is different than people coming
into the field now now for whom these

1348
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:46,960
into the field now now for whom these
 

1349
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,509
into the field now now for whom these
things have just been part of the

1350
00:27:49,509 --> 00:27:49,519
things have just been part of the

00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:54,880
whole life well it's fascinating to
 

1357
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,190
whole life well it's fascinating to
think about you know there being all of

1358
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:57,200
think about you know there being all of
 

1359
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,909
think about you know there being all of
these ideas kind of

1360
00:27:58,909 --> 00:27:58,919
these ideas kind of
 

1361
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:01,430
these ideas kind of
swimming you know almost with a noise

all around the world all the different
 

1365
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,470
all around the world all the different
generations and then some kind of

1366
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:06,480
generations and then some kind of
 

1367
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,070
generations and then some kind of
nonlinear thing happens where they

1368
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:08,080
nonlinear thing happens where they
 

1369
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,789
nonlinear thing happens where they
percolate up and and uh capture the

1370
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:10,799
percolate up and and uh capture the
 

1371
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,630
percolate up and and uh capture the

1373
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,750

I mean this Superman was supposed to be
a mind that would basically have

1420
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:11,840
a mind that would basically have
 

1421
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,669
a mind that would basically have
complete root access to its own brain

1422
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:14,679
complete root access to its own brain
 

1423
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:16,470
complete root access to its own brain
and Consciousness and be able to

1424
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:16,480
and Consciousness and be able to
 

1425
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,789
and Consciousness and be able to
architect it its own its own value

1426
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:18,799
architect it its own its own value
 

1427
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,669
architect it its own its own value
system and inspect and fine-tune all all

1428
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:21,679
system and inspect and fine-tune all all
 

1429
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,389
system and inspect and fine-tune all all
of its own its own biases so that's a

1430
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:25,399
of its own its own biases so that's a
 

1431
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:27,549
of its own its own biases so that's a
lot of powerful thinking there which

1432
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:27,559
lot of powerful thinking there which
 

1433
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:29,509
lot of powerful thinking there which
then fed in and and sort of seated all

1434
00:29:29,509 --> 00:29:29,519
then fed in and and sort of seated all
 

1435
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,110
then fed in and and sort of seated all
of postmodern Continental philosophy and

1436
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:33,120
of postmodern Continental philosophy and
 

1437
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,029
of postmodern Continental philosophy and
all sorts of of things have been very

1438
00:29:35,029 --> 00:29:35,039
all sorts of of things have been very
 

1439
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,950
all sorts of of things have been very
valuable in development of culture and

1440
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:36,960
valuable in development of culture and
 

1441
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,310
valuable in development of culture and
indirectly even even of Technology but

1442
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:40,320
indirectly even even of Technology but
 

1443
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,029
indirectly even even of Technology but
of course without the technology there

1444
00:29:42,029 --> 00:29:42,039
of course without the technology there
 

1445
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:44,750
of course without the technology there
it was all some quite abstract thinking

1446
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:44,760
it was all some quite abstract thinking
 

1447
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,950
it was all some quite abstract thinking
so now now we're at a time in history

1448
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:46,960
so now now we're at a time in history
 

1449
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,350
so now now we're at a time in history
when a lot of these

1450
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:49,360
when a lot of these
 

1451
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,350
when a lot of these
ideas can be can be made real which is

1452
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:52,360
ideas can be can be made real which is
 

1453
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,470
ideas can be can be made real which is
amazing amazing and scary right it's

1454
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:54,480
amazing amazing and scary right it's
 

1455
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,190
amazing amazing and scary right it's
kind of interesting to think what do you

1456
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:56,200
kind of interesting to think what do you
 

1457
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,870
kind of interesting to think what do you
think n would if he was born a a century

1458
00:29:58,870 --> 00:29:58,880
think n would if he was born a a century
 

1459
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,110
think n would if he was born a a century
later or transported through time what

1460
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:01,120
later or transported through time what
 

1461
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,909
later or transported through time what
do you think you would say about AI I

1462
00:30:02,909 --> 00:30:02,919
do you think you would say about AI I
 

1463
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:04,230
do you think you would say about AI I
mean well those are quite different if

1464
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:04,240
mean well those are quite different if
 

1465
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,710
mean well those are quite different if
he's born a century later or transported

1466
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:06,720
he's born a century later or transported
 

1467
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,230
he's born a century later or transported
through time well he'd be he'd be on

1468
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:08,240
through time well he'd be he'd be on
 

1469
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,870
through time well he'd be he'd be on
like Tik Tok and Instagram and he would

1470
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:09,880
like Tik Tok and Instagram and he would
 

1471
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,870
like Tik Tok and Instagram and he would
never write the great works he's written

1472
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:11,880
never write the great works he's written
 

1473
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,669
never write the great works he's written
so let's transport him through time

1474
00:30:13,669 --> 00:30:13,679
so let's transport him through time
 

1475
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,509
so let's transport him through time
maybe also sparra would be a music video

1476
00:30:16,509 --> 00:30:16,519
maybe also sparra would be a music video
 

1477
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:19,750
maybe also sparra would be a music video
right I mean I mean I mean who knows

1478
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:19,760
right I mean I mean I mean who knows
 

1479
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,230
right I mean I mean I mean who knows
yeah but if he was transported through

1480
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:21,240
yeah but if he was transported through
 

1481
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,870
yeah but if he was transported through
time do you think

1482
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:22,880
time do you think
 

1483
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,070
time do you think
uh that'd be interesting actually to go

1484
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:25,080
uh that'd be interesting actually to go
 

1485
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,990
uh that'd be interesting actually to go
back uh you just made me realize that

1486
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:28,000
back uh you just made me realize that
 

1487
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,190
back uh you just made me realize that
it's possible to go back and read ni

1488
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:30,200
it's possible to go back and read ni
 

1489
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,990
it's possible to go back and read ni
with an eye of is there some thinking

1490
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:33,000
with an eye of is there some thinking
 

1491
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,789
with an eye of is there some thinking
about artificial beings I'm sure there

1492

in the text it'd be interesting to see

1500
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:45,480
in the text it'd be interesting to see
 

1501
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,789
in the text it'd be interesting to see
to try to read his work to see if he

1502
00:30:47,789 --> 00:30:47,799
to try to read his work to see if he
 

1503

00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:53,600
look at humans in an aggregate but do
 

1549
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,509
look at humans in an aggregate but do
you think overall humans are

1550
00:31:56,509 --> 00:31:56,519
you think overall humans are
 

1551
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:00,629
you think overall humans are
good or or uh do we have both good and

00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:02,760
evil within us that uh depending on the
 

1555
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,190

can can can percolate to the top good

1558
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:08,440
can can can percolate to the top good
 

1559
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,590
can can can percolate to the top good
and evil

1560
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:10,600
and evil
 

1561
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,269
and evil
are very ambiguous complicated and in

1562
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:14,279
are very ambiguous complicated and in
 

1563
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:16,909
are very ambiguous complicated and in
some ways silly Concepts but if we we

1564
00:32:16,909 --> 00:32:16,919
some ways silly Concepts but if we we
 

1565
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:18,789

1568
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:21,480
couple directions so I think if you look
 

1569
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,509
couple directions so I think if you look
in

1573
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,149
evolution humanity is shaped both by
individual selection and what biologists

1574
00:32:29,149 --> 00:32:29,159
individual selection and what biologists
 

1575
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:31,590
individual selection and what biologists
would call group selection like tribe

1576
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:31,600
would call group selection like tribe
 

1577
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,509
would call group selection like tribe
level selection right so individual

1578
00:32:34,509 --> 00:32:34,519
level selection right so individual
 

1579
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:37,950
level selection right so individual
selection has driven us in a selfish DNA

1580
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:37,960
selection has driven us in a selfish DNA
 

1581
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,269
selection has driven us in a selfish DNA
sort of way so so that each of us does

1582
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:41,279
sort of way so so that each of us does
 

1583
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,590
sort of way so so that each of us does
to a certain approximation what will

1584
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:43,600
to a certain approximation what will
 

1585
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,269
to a certain approximation what will
help us propagate our our DNA to to

1586
00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:46,279
help us propagate our our DNA to to
 

1587
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:48,629
help us propagate our our DNA to to
Future Generations I mean that that that

1588
00:32:48,629 --> 00:32:48,639
Future Generations I mean that that that
 

1589
00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:51,029
Future Generations I mean that that that
that's why I've got four kids so far and

1590
00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:51,039
that's why I've got four kids so far and
 

1591
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,350
that's why I've got four kids so far and
and probably that's not the last one

1592
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:53,360
and probably that's not the last one
 

1593
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,789
and probably that's not the last one
yeah on the other hand I like the

1594
00:32:55,789 --> 00:32:55,799
yeah on the other hand I like the
 

1595
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:58,629
yeah on the other hand I like the
ambition tribal like group selection

1596
00:32:58,629 --> 00:32:58,639
ambition tribal like group selection
 

1597
00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:02,190
ambition tribal like group selection
means humans in a way will do what what

1598
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:02,200
means humans in a way will do what what
 

1599
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,909
means humans in a way will do what what
will advocate for the Persistence of the

1600
00:33:03,909 --> 00:33:03,919
will advocate for the Persistence of the
 

1601
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,870
will advocate for the Persistence of the
DNA of their whole their whole tribe or

1602
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:06,880
DNA of their whole their whole tribe or
 

1603
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,590
DNA of their whole their whole tribe or
their their social group and in biology

1604
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:09,600
their their social group and in biology
 

1605
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,750
their their social group and in biology
you you have both of these right like a

1606
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:11,760
you you have both of these right like a
 

1607
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,470
you you have both of these right like a
and you can see say an ant colony or

1608
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:13,480
and you can see say an ant colony or
 

1609
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,950
and you can see say an ant colony or
beehive there's a lot of group selection

1610
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:15,960
beehive there's a lot of group selection
 

1611
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,070
beehive there's a lot of group selection
in in in the evolution of those social

00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:18,080
in in in the evolution of those social
 

1613
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,149

animals on the other hand say a a big

1614
00:33:21,149 --> 00:33:21,159
animals on the other hand say a a big
 

1615
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:23,430
animals on the other hand say a a big
cat or some very solitary animal it's a

00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:23,440
cat or some very solitary animal it's a
 

1617
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,549
cat or some very solitary animal it's a
lot more biased toward toward individual

1618
00:33:25,549 --> 00:33:25,559
lot more biased toward toward individual
 

1619
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:27,950
lot more biased toward toward individual
selection humans are an interesting

1620
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:27,960

balance and I think this reflects itself

1622
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:31,480
balance and I think this reflects itself
 

1623
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,789
balance and I think this reflects itself
in what we would view as selfishness

1624
00:33:33,789 --> 00:33:33,799
in what we would view as selfishness
 

1625
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:37,509
in what we would view as selfishness
versus altruism to to to some extent so

versus altruism to to to some extent so
 

1627
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,549
versus altruism to to to some extent so
we just have both of those objective

1628
00:33:39,549 --> 00:33:39,559
we just have both of those objective
 

1629
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:42,470
we just have both of those objective
functions contributing to the the makeup

00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,870
in his own way and others have analyzed
in different ways I mean we abstract

1636
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:50,880
in different ways I mean we abstract
 

1637
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,149
in different ways I mean we abstract
this as well we have both good good and

1638
00:33:53,149 --> 00:33:53,159
this as well we have both good good and
 

1639
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:55,350
this as well we have both good good and
and and evil with within us right

1640
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:55,360
and and evil with within us right
 

1641
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,029
and and evil with within us right
because a lot of what we view as evil is

1642
00:33:58,029 --> 00:33:58,039
because a lot of what we view as evil is
 

1643
00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:00,789
because a lot of what we view as evil is
really just selfishness and a lot of

1644
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:00,799
really just selfishness and a lot of
 

1645
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,830
really just selfishness and a lot of
what we view as good is altruism which

1646
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:03,840
what we view as good is altruism which
 

1647
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,070
what we view as good is altruism which
means doing doing what's good for the

1648
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,080
means doing doing what's good for the
 

1649
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,270
means doing doing what's good for the
for the tribe and on that level we have

1650
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:08,280
for the tribe and on that level we have
 

1651
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,389
for the tribe and on that level we have
both of those just baked baked into us

1652
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:11,399
both of those just baked baked into us
 

1653
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:14,270
both of those just baked baked into us
and that's that's how it is of course

1654
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:14,280
and that's that's how it is of course
 

1655
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,149
and that's that's how it is of course
there are psychopaths and sociopaths and

1656
00:34:17,149 --> 00:34:17,159
there are psychopaths and sociopaths and
 

1657
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:20,230
there are psychopaths and sociopaths and
people who you know get gratified by the

1658
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:20,240
people who you know get gratified by the
 

1659
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,190
people who you know get gratified by the

1660
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:22,200
suffering of others and
 

1661
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,430
suffering of others and
that's that that that that's that's a

00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:24,440
that's that that that that's that's a
 

1663
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,710
that's that that that that's that's a
different thing yeah those are

1664
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:25,720
different thing yeah those are
 

1665
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,990
different thing yeah those are
exceptions but on the whole I think at

1666
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:29,000
exceptions but on the whole I think at
 

1667
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,829
exceptions but on the whole I think at
core we're not purely selfish we're not

purely altruistic we we are a mix and

00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:35,560
purely altruistic we we are a mix and
 

1671
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:39,109
purely altruistic we we are a mix and
that's that's the nature of it and we

1672
00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:39,119
that's that's the nature of it and we
 

1673
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,790
that's that's the nature of it and we
also have a complex constellation of

1674
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:42,800
also have a complex constellation of
 

1675
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,109
also have a complex constellation of

values that are just very specific to
 

1677
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:49,389
values that are just very specific to
our our Evol evolutionary history like

00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:49,399
our our Evol evolutionary history like
 

1679

and mountains and the the ideal place to
 

1683
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,470

care a lot about our our kids and we
 

1689
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,829
care a lot about our our kids and we
care a little less about our cousins and

care a little less about our cousins and
 

1691
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:05,030
care a little less about our cousins and
even less about our fifth cousins I mean

1692
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:05,040
even less about our fifth cousins I mean
 

1693
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,870
even less about our fifth cousins I mean

nature versus nurture is usually both
 

1833
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,829
nature versus nurture is usually both
and of course it's nature versus nurture

1834
00:38:01,829 --> 00:38:01,839
and of course it's nature versus nurture
 

1835

1838
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:05,280

1839
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,390
self-organization as you mentioned so
clearly they are evolutionary roots to

biological characteristics but still you
 

1873
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,950
biological characteristics but still you
know there's probably limits that are

1874
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:54,960
know there's probably limits that are
 

1875
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,710
know there's probably limits that are
given by biology I I used to argue this

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,349
with my great-grandparents who were
marxists actually because they they

we spend a lot more resources on as a as

we spend a lot more resources on as a as
 

2045

we spend a lot more resources on as a as
a species right so I mean we certainly

00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:25,400
a species right so I mean we certainly
 

2047
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,870
a species right so I mean we certainly
should do it I think that

00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:28,880
should do it I think that
 

2049

should do it I think that
the possible Futures in which a Mars

2050
00:42:32,109 --> 00:42:32,119
the possible Futures in which a Mars
 

2051
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:34,990
the possible Futures in which a Mars
colony makes a critical difference for

I I I I I think I mean assuming we make
 

2057
00:42:41,319 --> 00:42:42,829
I I I I I think I mean assuming we make
a Mars colony and people go live there

2058
00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:42,839
a Mars colony and people go live there
 

2059
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:44,349
a Mars colony and people go live there
in a couple decades I mean their

00:42:44,349 --> 00:42:44,359
in a couple decades I mean their
 

2061
00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:46,309
in a couple decades I mean their

the money to make the colony came from
 

2065
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,750

the the the goods there from from Earth
 

2069
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:56,710

are going to in effect be in in control
 

2071
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,670
are going to in effect be in in control
of that of that Mars colony of course

2072
00:42:59,670 --> 00:42:59,680
of that of that Mars colony of course
 

2073
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,829
of that of that Mars colony of course
there are outlier situations where you

2074
00:43:02,829 --> 00:43:02,839
there are outlier situations where you
 

2075
00:43:02,839 --> 00:43:07,150
there are outlier situations where you
know Earth gets nuked into Oblivion and

2076
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:07,160
know Earth gets nuked into Oblivion and
 

2077
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,870
know Earth gets nuked into Oblivion and
somehow Mars has been made self-

2078
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:08,880
somehow Mars has been made self-
 

2079
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,750
somehow Mars has been made self-
sustaining by that point and and then

2080
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:11,760
sustaining by that point and and then
 

2081
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,190
sustaining by that point and and then
Mars is what allows Humanity to persist

2082
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:14,200
Mars is what allows Humanity to persist
 

2083
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,950
Mars is what allows Humanity to persist
but I think that those are very very

2084
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:17,960
but I think that those are very very
 

2085
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,430
but I think that those are very very
very unlikely you don't think it could

2086
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:20,440
very unlikely you don't think it could
 

2087
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,109
very unlikely you don't think it could
be a first step on a long journey of

2088
00:43:23,109 --> 00:43:23,119
be a first step on a long journey of
 

2089
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,349
be a first step on a long journey of
course it's a first step on a long

2090
00:43:24,349 --> 00:43:24,359
course it's a first step on a long
 

2091
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:27,190
course it's a first step on a long
journey which which is which is awesome

2092
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:27,200
journey which which is which is awesome
 

2093
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,630
journey which which is which is awesome
I'm guessing the colonization of the

2094
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:30,640
I'm guessing the colonization of the
 

2095
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,150
I'm guessing the colonization of the
rest of the physical universe will

2096
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:32,160
rest of the physical universe will
 

2097
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,150
rest of the physical universe will
probably be done

2098
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:34,160
probably be done
 

2099
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,349
probably be done
by agis that are better designed to live

2100
00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:37,359
by agis that are better designed to live
 

2101
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:39,950
by agis that are better designed to live
in space than by by the meat machines

2102
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:39,960
in space than by by the meat machines
 

2103
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,589
in space than by by the meat machines
that that that we are but I mean who

2104
00:43:42,589 --> 00:43:42,599
that that that we are but I mean who
 

2105
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:44,790
that that that we are but I mean who
knows we may cryopreserve ourselves in

2106
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:44,800
knows we may cryopreserve ourselves in
 

2107
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,630

some Superior way to what we know now

some Superior way to what we know now
 

2109
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,549
some Superior way to what we know now
and like shoot ourselves out to Alpha

2110
00:43:49,549 --> 00:43:49,559
and like shoot ourselves out to Alpha

centurum Beyond I mean that's all cool

2112
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:52,640

2113
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,670
centurum Beyond I mean that's all cool
it's very interesting and it's much more

2114
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:54,680
it's very interesting and it's much more
 

2115
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,270
it's very interesting and it's much more
valuable than most things that you

2116
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:57,280
valuable than most things that you
 

2117
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,349

hand with aggi we can get to a

2120
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:02,680
hand with aggi we can get to a
 

2121
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,829
hand with aggi we can get to a
singularity before the Mars colony

2122
00:44:05,829 --> 00:44:05,839
singularity before the Mars colony
 

2123
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:08,150
singularity before the Mars colony
becomes sustaining for sure possibly

2124
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:08,160
becomes sustaining for sure possibly
 

2125
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,390
becomes sustaining for sure possibly
before it's even operational so your

2126
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:10,400
before it's even operational so your
 

2127
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,430
before it's even operational so your
intuition is that that's the problem if

2128
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:12,440
intuition is that that's the problem if
 

2129
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,109
intuition is that that's the problem if
we really invest resources and we can

2130
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:14,119
we really invest resources and we can
 

2131
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:16,910
we really invest resources and we can
get to faster than a legitimate full

2132
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:16,920
get to faster than a legitimate full
 

2133
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,069
get to faster than a legitimate full
like self- sustaining colonization of

2134
00:44:19,069 --> 00:44:19,079
like self- sustaining colonization of
 

2135
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:22,230
like self- sustaining colonization of
Mars yeah and it's it's very clear that

2136
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:22,240
Mars yeah and it's it's very clear that
 

2137
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,910
Mars yeah and it's it's very clear that
we will to me because there's so much

2138
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:24,920
we will to me because there's so much
 

2139
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,230
we will to me because there's so much
economic value in getting from Nar AI

2140
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:27,240
economic value in getting from Nar AI
 

2141
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,270
economic value in getting from Nar AI
toward toward AGI whereas the Mars

2142
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:30,280
toward toward AGI whereas the Mars
 

2143
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,630
toward toward AGI whereas the Mars
colony there's less economic value until

2144
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:33,640
colony there's less economic value until
 

2145
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,510
colony there's less economic value until
you get quite far far far out into the

2146
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:36,520
you get quite far far far out into the
 

2147
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,270
you get quite far far far out into the
into the future so I think that's very

2148
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:39,280
into the future so I think that's very
 

2149
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,069
into the future so I think that's very
interesting I just think it's it's

2150
00:44:42,069 --> 00:44:42,079
interesting I just think it's it's
 

2151
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,630
interesting I just think it's it's
somewhat somewhat off to the side I mean

2152
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:44,640
somewhat somewhat off to the side I mean
 

2153
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,549
somewhat somewhat off to the side I mean
Ju Just as I think say you know art and

2154
00:44:47,549 --> 00:44:47,559
Ju Just as I think say you know art and
 

2155
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:49,750
Ju Just as I think say you know art and
music are are very very interesting and

2156
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:49,760
music are are very very interesting and
 

2157
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,109
music are are very very interesting and
I want to see resources go into amazing

I want to see resources go into amazing
 

2159
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,990
I want to see resources go into amazing
art and music being being created and I

2160
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:57,000
art and music being being created and I
 

2161
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,150
art and music being being created and I
i' rather see that than a lot of the

2162
00:44:59,150 --> 00:44:59,160
i' rather see that than a lot of the
 

2163
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,990
i' rather see that than a lot of the
garbage that Society spends their money

2164
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:01,000
garbage that Society spends their money
 

2165
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,549
garbage that Society spends their money
on on the other hand I don't think Mars

2166
00:45:03,549 --> 00:45:03,559
on on the other hand I don't think Mars
 

2167
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:05,910
on on the other hand I don't think Mars

you think AGI is really AI is is by far

2182
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:23,680
you think AGI is really AI is is by far
 

2183
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,349
you think AGI is really AI is is by far
the most important thing that's on the

the most important thing that's on the
 

2185
00:45:26,359 --> 00:45:27,510
the most important thing that's on the
horizon

2186

horizon
 

2187
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,549
horizon
and then

2188
00:45:28,549 --> 00:45:28,559
and then
 

2189
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,670
and then

2193
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,990
enable AGI or to accelerate AGI are also
very important for example say qu

and then that that AGI should be able to

and then that that AGI should be able to

strong AI was used in the cognitive

we go with AGI artificial general

2390
00:50:21,109 --> 00:50:21,119
we go with AGI artificial general

00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:23,309
we go with AGI artificial general

in Chinese it goes in that order right

2396
00:50:27,829 --> 00:50:27,839
in Chinese it goes in that order right
 

2397
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:30,870
in Chinese it goes in that order right
but we figured gay wouldn't work in in

2398
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:30,880
but we figured gay wouldn't work in in
 

2399
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,069
but we figured gay wouldn't work in in
in US culture at that time right so so

2400
00:50:35,069 --> 00:50:35,079
in US culture at that time right so so
 

2401
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:37,710
in US culture at that time right so so
we we went with the AGI AGI we used it

2402
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:37,720
we we went with the AGI AGI we used it
 

2403
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:40,190
we we went with the AGI AGI we used it
for the for the title of that book and

2404
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:40,200
for the for the title of that book and
 

2405
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,549
for the for the title of that book and
part of Peter and Shane's reasoning was

2406
00:50:43,549 --> 00:50:43,559
part of Peter and Shane's reasoning was
 

2407
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:45,390
part of Peter and Shane's reasoning was
you have the G factor in Psychology

2408
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:45,400
you have the G factor in Psychology
 

2409
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,470
you have the G factor in Psychology
which is IQ general intelligence right

2410
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:47,480
which is IQ general intelligence right
 

2411
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:50,109
which is IQ general intelligence right
so you have a meaning of GI general

2412
00:50:50,109 --> 00:50:50,119
so you have a meaning of GI general
 

2413
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:52,390
so you have a meaning of GI general
intelligence in Psychology so then

2414
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:52,400
intelligence in Psychology so then
 

2415
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,670
intelligence in Psychology so then
you're looking like artificial GI so

2416
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:55,680
you're looking like artificial GI so
 

2417
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,390
you're looking like artificial GI so
then oh that makes a lot of sense we use

2418
00:50:58,390 --> 00:50:58,400
then oh that makes a lot of sense we use
 

2419
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,750
then oh that makes a lot of sense we use
that for the we use that for the title

2420
00:50:59,750 --> 00:50:59,760
that for the we use that for the title
 

2421
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:03,069
that for the we use that for the title
of the book and so I think I maybe both

2422
00:51:03,069 --> 00:51:03,079
of the book and so I think I maybe both
 

2423
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:04,870
of the book and so I think I maybe both
Shane and Peter think they invented the

2424
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:04,880
Shane and Peter think they invented the
 

2425
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,990
Shane and Peter think they invented the
term but but then later after the book

2426
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:07,000
term but but then later after the book
 

2427
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,750
term but but then later after the book
was published this guy Mark grid came up

2428
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:10,760
was published this guy Mark grid came up
 

2429
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,309
was published this guy Mark grid came up
to me and he's like well I I publish an

2430
00:51:13,309 --> 00:51:13,319
to me and he's like well I I publish an
 

2431
00:51:13,319 --> 00:51:15,510
to me and he's like well I I publish an
essay with the term AGI in it in like

2432
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:15,520
essay with the term AGI in it in like
 

2433
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,069
essay with the term AGI in it in like
1997 or something and so I'm just

2434
00:51:18,069 --> 00:51:18,079
1997 or something and so I'm just
 

2435
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:20,630
1997 or something and so I'm just
waiting for some Russian to come out and

2436
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:20,640
waiting for some Russian to come out and
 

2437
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,470
waiting for some Russian to come out and
say they published that in 1953 right I

2438
00:51:23,470 --> 00:51:23,480
say they published that in 1953 right I
 

2439
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,030
say they published that in 1953 right I
mean that term that term is not

2440
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:26,040
mean that term that term is not
 

2441
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,270
mean that term that term is not

inovative or anything it's one of these
 

2445
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:32,910

00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:32,920
obvious in hindsight things which is
 

2447
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,710
obvious in hindsight things which is
also annoying in a way

2448
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:35,720
also annoying in a way

2454
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:43,200
likes the term synthetic intelligence
 

2455
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,829
likes the term synthetic intelligence
which I like much better but it hasn't

2456
00:51:44,829 --> 00:51:44,839
which I like much better but it hasn't
 

2457
00:51:44,839 --> 00:51:47,150
which I like much better but it hasn't
it hasn't actually caught on right

2458
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:47,160
it hasn't actually caught on right
 

2459
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,109
it hasn't actually caught on right
because I mean

2460
00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:49,119
because I mean
 

2461
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,510
because I mean
artificial is a bit off to me because AR

2462
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:52,520
artificial is a bit off to me because AR
 

2463
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:55,190
artificial is a bit off to me because AR
artifice is like a tool or something but

2464
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:55,200
artifice is like a tool or something but
 

2465
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,789
artifice is like a tool or something but
but not all AGI are going to be tools I

2466
00:51:57,789 --> 00:51:57,799
but not all AGI are going to be tools I
 

2467
00:51:57,799 --> 00:51:59,230
but not all AGI are going to be tools I
mean they may be now but we're aiming

2468
00:51:59,230 --> 00:51:59,240
mean they may be now but we're aiming
 

2469
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,990
mean they may be now but we're aiming
toward making them agents rather than

2470
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:02,000
toward making them agents rather than
 

2471
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,349
toward making them agents rather than
than tools and in a way I don't like the

2472
00:52:04,349 --> 00:52:04,359
than tools and in a way I don't like the
 

2473
00:52:04,359 --> 00:52:06,630
than tools and in a way I don't like the
distinction between artificial and

2474
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:06,640
distinction between artificial and
 

2475
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,230
distinction between artificial and
natural because I mean we're we're part

2476
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:08,240
natural because I mean we're we're part
 

2477
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,990
natural because I mean we're we're part
of nature also and machines are part of

2478
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:11,000
of nature also and machines are part of
 

2479
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,710
of nature also and machines are part of
are are part of nature I mean you can

2480
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:12,720
are are part of nature I mean you can
 

2481
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,030
are are part of nature I mean you can
look at evolved versus engineered but

2482
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:15,040
look at evolved versus engineered but
 

2483
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,349
look at evolved versus engineered but
that that's a different that's a

2484
00:52:16,349 --> 00:52:16,359
that that's a different that's a
 

2485
00:52:16,359 --> 00:52:18,109
that that's a different that's a
different distinction then it should be

2486
00:52:18,109 --> 00:52:18,119
different distinction then it should be
 

2487
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:20,030
different distinction then it should be
engineered general intelligence right

2488
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:20,040
engineered general intelligence right
 

2489
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,430
engineered general intelligence right
and then General well if you look at

2490
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:22,440
and then General well if you look at
 

2491
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:25,630
and then General well if you look at
Marcus Hooter's book Universal what he

2492
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:25,640
Marcus Hooter's book Universal what he
 

2493
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:28,910
Marcus Hooter's book Universal what he
argues there is is you know within the

2494
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:28,920
argues there is is you know within the
 

2495
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,789
argues there is is you know within the
domain of computation Theory which is

2496
00:52:30,789 --> 00:52:30,799
domain of computation Theory which is
 

2497
00:52:30,799 --> 00:52:32,549
domain of computation Theory which is
limited but interesting so if you assume

2498
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:32,559
limited but interesting so if you assume
 

2499
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,150
limited but interesting so if you assume
computable environment it's a computable

00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:34,160
computable environment it's a computable
 

2501
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,190
computable environment it's a computable
reward functions then he articulates

2502
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:37,200
reward functions then he articulates
 

2503
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,190
reward functions then he articulates
what would be a truly general

the middle name of of my latest child
 

2511
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,150
the middle name of of my latest child
actually is it what's the first name

2539
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,109
arms Ras of weird geeky baby names yeah
we'll see what the babies think about it

2540
00:53:26,109 --> 00:53:26,119
we'll see what the babies think about it
 

2541
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:28,430
we'll see what the babies think about it
right but I mean my oldest son

2542
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:28,440
right but I mean my oldest son
 

2543
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,030
right but I mean my oldest son

far basically if you give your kids

2548
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:36,200
far basically if you give your kids
 

2549
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,030
far basically if you give your kids
weird names they live up to it well

2550
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:38,040
weird names they live up to it well
 

2551
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,470
weird names they live up to it well
you're obliged to make the kids weird

2552
00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:39,480
you're obliged to make the kids weird
 

2553
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:42,190
you're obliged to make the kids weird
enough that they like the names right it

2554
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:42,200
enough that they like the names right it

directs their upbringing in a certain
 

2557
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,750

way but yeah anyway I mean what Marcus

2558
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:46,760
way but yeah anyway I mean what Marcus
 

2559
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,549
way but yeah anyway I mean what Marcus
showed in that book is that a truly

showed in that book is that a truly

00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:51,400
general intelligence theoretically is
 

2563
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,630
general intelligence theoretically is
possible but would take infinite

2564
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:52,640
possible but would take infinite
 

2565
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,309
possible but would take infinite

computing power so then the artificial
 

2567
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:57,990
computing power so then the artificial
is a little off the General is not

2568
00:53:57,990 --> 00:53:58,000
is a little off the General is not
 

2569
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,510
is a little off the General is not
really achievable within physics as as

2570
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:00,520
really achievable within physics as as
 

2571
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,430
really achievable within physics as as
as we know it and I mean physics as we

00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:02,440
as we know it and I mean physics as we
 

2573
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,829
as we know it and I mean physics as we
know it may be limited but that's what

2574
00:54:03,829 --> 00:54:03,839
know it may be limited but that's what
 

2575
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:06,150
know it may be limited but that's what
we have to work with now intelligence

2576
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:06,160
we have to work with now intelligence
 

2577
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,510
we have to work with now intelligence
infinitely General you mean like yeah

2578
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:08,520
infinitely General you mean like yeah
 

2579
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,589
infinitely General you mean like yeah
information processing perspective yeah

information processing perspective yeah
 

2581
00:54:10,599 --> 00:54:13,430

yeah in intelligence is not very well-

2582
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:13,440
yeah in intelligence is not very well-
 

2583
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,750
yeah in intelligence is not very well-
defined either right I mean what what

00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:15,760
defined either right I mean what what
 

2585
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,109
defined either right I mean what what
what what does it mean I mean in AI now

2586
00:54:18,109 --> 00:54:18,119
what what does it mean I mean in AI now
 

2587
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:19,829
what what does it mean I mean in AI now
it's fashionable to look at it as

2588
00:54:19,829 --> 00:54:19,839
it's fashionable to look at it as

00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,430
it's fashionable to look at it as

00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:39,440
reward without yeah he's just looking at
 

2605
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,270
reward without yeah he's just looking at
it differently he's looking at complex

2606
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:41,280
it differently he's looking at complex
 

2607
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,470
it differently he's looking at complex
self-organizing systems and looking at

2608
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:43,480
self-organizing systems and looking at
 

2609
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,870
self-organizing systems and looking at
an intelligent system as being one that

right so yeah the point is artificial

2628
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:06,640
right so yeah the point is artificial
 

2629
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,390
right so yeah the point is artificial
general and intelligence don't work

2630
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:08,400
general and intelligence don't work

00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,150
general and intelligence don't work
they're all bad on the other hand

00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,910
they're all bad on the other hand
everyone knows what AI is yeah and

00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:12,920
everyone knows what AI is yeah and
 

2635
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:15,990
everyone knows what AI is yeah and
AI seems immediately comprehensible to

2636
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:16,000
AI seems immediately comprehensible to
 

2637
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,470
AI seems immediately comprehensible to
people with with a technical background

people with with a technical background
 

2639
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,470
people with with a technical background
so I think that the term is served as

00:55:19,470 --> 00:55:19,480
so I think that the term is served as
 

2641
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,910
so I think that the term is served as
sociological function and now now now

00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:21,920
sociological function and now now now
 

2643
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,029
sociological function and now now now
it's out there everywhere which which

2644
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:24,039
it's out there everywhere which which

00:55:24,039 --> 00:55:26,109
it's out there everywhere which which
which baffles me it's like KFC I mean

2646
00:55:26,109 --> 00:55:26,119
which baffles me it's like KFC I mean
 

2647
00:55:26,119 --> 00:55:27,670
which baffles me it's like KFC I mean
that's that's it you're we're stuck with

2648
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:27,680
that's that's it you're we're stuck with
 

2649
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,870
that's that's it you're we're stuck with
agii probably for a very long time until

2650
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:30,880
agii probably for a very long time until
 

2651
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,910
agii probably for a very long time until
AGI systems take over and rename

2652
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:32,920
AGI systems take over and rename
 

2653
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,230
AGI systems take over and rename
themselves yeah and that I mean that

2654
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:35,240
themselves yeah and that I mean that
 

2655
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,710
themselves yeah and that I mean that
we'll be we're stuck with gpus too which

2656
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:37,720
we'll be we're stuck with gpus too which
 

2657
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:39,270
we'll be we're stuck with gpus too which
mostly have nothing to do with Graphics

2658
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:39,280
mostly have nothing to do with Graphics
 

2659
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,630
mostly have nothing to do with Graphics
anymore right I wonder what the AGI

2660
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:41,640
anymore right I wonder what the AGI
 

2661
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:44,270
anymore right I wonder what the AGI
system will call us humans I was maybe

2662
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:44,280
system will call us humans I was maybe
 

2663
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,589
system will call us humans I was maybe

yeah biological Grandpa processing units
 

2669
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,990
yeah biological Grandpa processing units
uh okay so um maybe also just a comment

2670
00:55:57,990 --> 00:55:58,000
uh okay so um maybe also just a comment
 

2671
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,630
uh okay so um maybe also just a comment
on AGI representing before even the term

2672
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:01,640
on AGI representing before even the term
 

2673
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:04,470
on AGI representing before even the term
existed representing a kind of community

2674
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:04,480
existed representing a kind of community
 

2675
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,190
existed representing a kind of community
now you've talked about this in the past

2676
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:06,200
now you've talked about this in the past
 

2677
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,710
now you've talked about this in the past
sort of AI has come in waves but there's

2678
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:08,720
sort of AI has come in waves but there's
 

2679
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,109
sort of AI has come in waves but there's
always always been this community of

2680
00:56:10,109 --> 00:56:10,119
always always been this community of
 

2681
00:56:10,119 --> 00:56:11,829
always always been this community of
people who dream about

2682
00:56:11,829 --> 00:56:11,839
people who dream about
 

2683
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:15,670
people who dream about
creating uh General human level super

2684
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:15,680
creating uh General human level super
 

2685
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,190

2686
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:17,200
intelligence
 

2687
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:21,029
intelligence
systems uh can you maybe give your sense

2688
00:56:21,029 --> 00:56:21,039
systems uh can you maybe give your sense
 

2689
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:23,549
systems uh can you maybe give your sense
of the history of this community as it

2690
00:56:23,549 --> 00:56:23,559
of the history of this community as it
 

2691
00:56:23,559 --> 00:56:25,430
of the history of this community as it
exists today as it existed before this

2696
00:56:28,549 --> 00:56:28,559
throughout the winters and the Summers
 

2697
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:32,589
throughout the winters and the Summers
of AI sure uh first I would say as a

2698
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:32,599
of AI sure uh first I would say as a
 

2699
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:36,029
of AI sure uh first I would say as a
side point the winters and Summers of AI

2700
00:56:36,029 --> 00:56:36,039
side point the winters and Summers of AI
 

2701
00:56:36,039 --> 00:56:39,510
side point the winters and Summers of AI
are greatly exaggerated by by Americans

2702
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:39,520
are greatly exaggerated by by Americans
 

2703
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,670
are greatly exaggerated by by Americans
yeah and in the if you look at the

2704
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:41,680
yeah and in the if you look at the
 

2705
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,710
yeah and in the if you look at the
publication record of the artificial

2706
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:44,720
publication record of the artificial
 

2707
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,430
publication record of the artificial
intelligence Community since say the

2708
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:47,440
intelligence Community since say the
 

2709
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,950
intelligence Community since say the
1950s you would find a pretty steady

2710
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:50,960
1950s you would find a pretty steady
 

2711
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,430
1950s you would find a pretty steady
growth in advance of ideas and and and

2712
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:53,440
growth in advance of ideas and and and
 

2713
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,670
growth in advance of ideas and and and
papers and what's thought of as an AI

2714
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:56,680
papers and what's thought of as an AI
 

2715
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,029
papers and what's thought of as an AI
winter or summer was sort of how much

2716
00:56:59,029 --> 00:56:59,039
winter or summer was sort of how much
 

2717
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:02,150
winter or summer was sort of how much
money is the US military pumping into AI

2718
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:02,160
money is the US military pumping into AI
 

2719
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,029
money is the US military pumping into AI
which was was meaningful on the other

2720
00:57:05,029 --> 00:57:05,039
which was was meaningful on the other
 

2721
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:07,470
which was was meaningful on the other
hand there was AI going on in Germany UK

2722
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:07,480
hand there was AI going on in Germany UK
 

2723
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,150
hand there was AI going on in Germany UK
and in Japan and in Russia all over the

2724
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:10,160
and in Japan and in Russia all over the
 

2725
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,789
and in Japan and in Russia all over the
place while US military got more and

2726
00:57:12,789 --> 00:57:12,799
place while US military got more and
 

2727
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:17,069
place while US military got more and
less less in enthused about AI so what I

2728
00:57:17,069 --> 00:57:17,079
less less in enthused about AI so what I
 

2729
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:19,029
less less in enthused about AI so what I
mean that happened to be just for people

2730
00:57:19,029 --> 00:57:19,039
mean that happened to be just for people
 

2731
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:21,430
mean that happened to be just for people
who don't know the US military happened

2732
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:21,440
who don't know the US military happened
 

2733
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,109
who don't know the US military happened
to be the main source of funding for AI

2734
00:57:24,109 --> 00:57:24,119
to be the main source of funding for AI
 

2735
00:57:24,119 --> 00:57:26,230
to be the main source of funding for AI
research so another way to phrase that

2736
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:26,240
research so another way to phrase that
 

2737
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:29,549
research so another way to phrase that
is it's up and down of uh funding for

2738
00:57:29,549 --> 00:57:29,559
is it's up and down of uh funding for
 

2739
00:57:29,559 --> 00:57:31,190
is it's up and down of uh funding for
artificial intelligence research true

2740
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:31,200
artificial intelligence research true
 

2741
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,549
artificial intelligence research true
and I would say the correlation between

2742
00:57:33,549 --> 00:57:33,559
and I would say the correlation between
 

2743
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:37,029
and I would say the correlation between
funding and intellectual Advance was not

2744
00:57:37,029 --> 00:57:37,039
funding and intellectual Advance was not
 

2745
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:39,870
funding and intellectual Advance was not
100% right because I mean in in Russia

2746
00:57:39,870 --> 00:57:39,880
100% right because I mean in in Russia
 

2747
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:42,430
100% right because I mean in in Russia
as an example or in Germany there was

2748
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:42,440
as an example or in Germany there was
 

2749
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,870
as an example or in Germany there was
less dollar funding than in the US but

2750
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:44,880
less dollar funding than in the US but
 

2751
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,710
less dollar funding than in the US but
many foundational ideas were were laid

2752
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:47,720
many foundational ideas were were laid
 

2753
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,710
many foundational ideas were were laid
out but it was more Theory than than

2754
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:49,720
out but it was more Theory than than
 

2755
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:52,750
out but it was more Theory than than
implementation right and us really

2756
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:52,760
implementation right and us really
 

2757
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,589
implementation right and us really
excelled at sort of breaking through

2758
00:57:54,589 --> 00:57:54,599
excelled at sort of breaking through
 

2759
00:57:54,599 --> 00:57:59,309
excelled at sort of breaking through
from theoretical papers to working

2760
00:57:59,309 --> 00:57:59,319
from theoretical papers to working
 

2761
00:57:59,319 --> 00:58:02,029
from theoretical papers to working
implementations which which did go up

2762
00:58:02,029 --> 00:58:02,039
implementations which which did go up
 

2763
00:58:02,039 --> 00:58:03,750
implementations which which did go up
and down somewhat with US military

2764
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:03,760
and down somewhat with US military
 

2765
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,470
and down somewhat with US military
funding but still I mean you can look in

2766
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:06,480
funding but still I mean you can look in
 

2767
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,349
funding but still I mean you can look in
the 1980s Dietrich derer in Germany had

2768
00:58:09,349 --> 00:58:09,359
the 1980s Dietrich derer in Germany had
 

2769
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:11,430
the 1980s Dietrich derer in Germany had
self-driving cars on the autoban right

2770
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:11,440
self-driving cars on the autoban right
 

2771
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:15,510
self-driving cars on the autoban right
and I mean this it was a little early

2772
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:15,520
and I mean this it was a little early
 

2773
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,069
and I mean this it was a little early
with regard to the car industry so it

2774
00:58:17,069 --> 00:58:17,079
with regard to the car industry so it
 

2775
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:19,829
with regard to the car industry so it
didn't catch on such as has has happened

2776
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:19,839
didn't catch on such as has has happened
 

2777
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:23,069
didn't catch on such as has has happened
now but I mean that whole advancement of

2778
00:58:23,069 --> 00:58:23,079
now but I mean that whole advancement of
 

2779
00:58:23,079 --> 00:58:25,750
now but I mean that whole advancement of
self-driving car technology in Germany

2780
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:25,760
self-driving car technology in Germany
 

2781
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,190
self-driving car technology in Germany
was Prett pretty much independent of AI

2782
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:28,200
was Prett pretty much independent of AI
 

2783
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,630
was Prett pretty much independent of AI
military Summers and and Winters in the

2784
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:30,640
military Summers and and Winters in the
 

2785
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,589
military Summers and and Winters in the
US so there there's been more going on

2786
00:58:32,589 --> 00:58:32,599
US so there there's been more going on
 

2787
00:58:32,599 --> 00:58:35,910
US so there there's been more going on
in AI globally than not only most people

2788
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:35,920
in AI globally than not only most people
 

2789
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,470
in AI globally than not only most people
on the planet realize but than most new

2790
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:38,480
on the planet realize but than most new
 

2791
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,789
on the planet realize but than most new
AI phds realize because they've come out

2792
00:58:40,789 --> 00:58:40,799
AI phds realize because they've come out
 

2793
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:44,510
AI phds realize because they've come out
within a certain Sub sub field of of AI

2794
00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:44,520
within a certain Sub sub field of of AI
 

2795
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:47,069
within a certain Sub sub field of of AI
and haven't had to look so much so much

2796
00:58:47,069 --> 00:58:47,079
and haven't had to look so much so much
 

2797
00:58:47,079 --> 00:58:50,270
and haven't had to look so much so much
beyond that but I I would say when I got

2798
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:50,280
beyond that but I I would say when I got
 

2799
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:53,230
beyond that but I I would say when I got
when I got my PhD in 1989 in in

2800
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:53,240
when I got my PhD in 1989 in in
 

2801
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:55,470
when I got my PhD in 1989 in in
mathematics I was interested in AI

2802
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:55,480
mathematics I was interested in AI
 

2803
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:57,870
mathematics I was interested in AI
already Philadelphia by yeah I started

yeah the pearl of pearl of the US right
yeah you never stopped at a red light

2814
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:10,640
yeah you never stopped at a red light
 

2815
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,750
yeah you never stopped at a red light
then because you were afraid if you

2816
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:11,760
then because you were afraid if you
 

2817
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,349
then because you were afraid if you
stopped at the red light some more car

2818
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:13,359
stopped at the red light some more car
 

2819
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:16,109
stopped at the red light some more car
Jackie so strive through every red light

2820
00:59:16,109 --> 00:59:16,119
Jackie so strive through every red light
 

2821
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:19,150
Jackie so strive through every red light
yeah it is a every every day driving or

2822
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:19,160
yeah it is a every every day driving or
 

2823
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:21,589
yeah it is a every every day driving or
bicycling to Temple from my house was it

2824
00:59:21,589 --> 00:59:21,599
bicycling to Temple from my house was it
 

2825
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,670
bicycling to Temple from my house was it
was like a new new adventure right but

2826
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:24,680
was like a new new adventure right but
 

2827
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:26,510
was like a new new adventure right but
yeah when I the reason I didn't do PC

2828
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:26,520
yeah when I the reason I didn't do PC
 

2829
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:29,069
yeah when I the reason I didn't do PC
and AI was what people were doing in the

2830
00:59:29,069 --> 00:59:29,079
and AI was what people were doing in the
 

2831
00:59:29,079 --> 00:59:32,029
and AI was what people were doing in the
academic AI field then was just

2832
00:59:32,029 --> 00:59:32,039
academic AI field then was just
 

2833
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:34,069
academic AI field then was just
astoundingly boring and seemed

2834
00:59:34,069 --> 00:59:34,079
astoundingly boring and seemed
 

2835
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:36,349
astoundingly boring and seemed
wrong-headed to me it was really like

2836
00:59:36,349 --> 00:59:36,359
wrong-headed to me it was really like
 

2837
00:59:36,359 --> 00:59:38,789
wrong-headed to me it was really like
rule-based expert systems and production

2838
00:59:38,789 --> 00:59:38,799
rule-based expert systems and production
 

2839
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:40,990
rule-based expert systems and production
systems and I actually I loved

2840
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:41,000
systems and I actually I loved
 

2841
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,990
systems and I actually I loved
mathematical logic I had nothing against

2842
00:59:42,990 --> 00:59:43,000
mathematical logic I had nothing against
 

2843
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,829
mathematical logic I had nothing against
logic as the cognitive engine for an AI

2844
00:59:45,829 --> 00:59:45,839
logic as the cognitive engine for an AI
 

2845
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:48,430
logic as the cognitive engine for an AI
but the idea that you could type in the

2846
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:48,440
but the idea that you could type in the
 

2847
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:50,630
but the idea that you could type in the
knowledge that AI would need to think

2848
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:50,640
knowledge that AI would need to think
 

2849
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:53,190
knowledge that AI would need to think
seemed just completely stupid and and

2850
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:53,200
seemed just completely stupid and and
 

2851
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,670
seemed just completely stupid and and
and and wrong-headed to me I mean you

2852
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:55,680
and and wrong-headed to me I mean you
 

2853
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,870
and and wrong-headed to me I mean you
can use logic if you want but somehow

2854
00:59:58,870 --> 00:59:58,880
can use logic if you want but somehow
 

2855
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,789
can use logic if you want but somehow
the system has got to be automated

2856
01:00:00,789 --> 01:00:00,799
the system has got to be automated
 

2857
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:02,270

2858
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:02,280
learning right it should be learning
 

2859
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:05,069
learning right it should be learning
from experience and the AI field then

2860
01:00:05,069 --> 01:00:05,079
from experience and the AI field then
 

2861
01:00:05,079 --> 01:00:07,750
from experience and the AI field then
was not interested in learning from

2862
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:07,760
was not interested in learning from
 

2863
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,950

that was a system that was supposed to

2880
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:32,680
that was a system that was supposed to
 

2881
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:37,349
that was a system that was supposed to
be an AGI and basically by some sort of

2882
01:00:37,349 --> 01:00:37,359
be an AGI and basically by some sort of
 

2883
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:40,430

learning it was supposed to learn

2886
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:42,920
learning it was supposed to learn
 

2887
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:44,390

unnecessarily bloated but back then it
 

2941
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:52,630
unnecessarily bloated but back then it
was like Java or C++ basically and Java

was like Java or C++ basically and Java
 

2943
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,349

01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:36,990
main Gathering of people who want to
achieve AGI and think that uh large

3124
01:05:36,990 --> 01:05:37,000
achieve AGI and think that uh large

scale nonlinear regression is is is is
 

3127
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,910
scale nonlinear regression is is is is
not the golden path to to AGI so I mean

3128
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:42,920
not the golden path to to AGI so I mean
 

3129
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:44,630
not the golden path to to AGI so I mean
it's AK and your all Network yeah yeah

3130
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:44,640
it's AK and your all Network yeah yeah
 

3131
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:48,349
it's AK and your all Network yeah yeah
yeah well certain architectures for

3132
01:05:48,349 --> 01:05:48,359
yeah well certain architectures for
 

3133
01:05:48,359 --> 01:05:52,029
yeah well certain architectures for
for for learning using neural network so

3134

not the only ones I mean there there's
 

3147
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,190
not the only ones I mean there there's
other little conferences and and

3155
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:18,870

it's been a big shift like back back

3156
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:18,880
it's been a big shift like back back
 

3157

the mentioned AGI or human level AI it
 

3165
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:30,549
the mentioned AGI or human level AI it
was more like you had to talk about

3166
01:06:30,549 --> 01:06:30,559
was more like you had to talk about
 

3167
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:32,589
was more like you had to talk about
something more short-term and

3168
01:06:32,589 --> 01:06:32,599
something more short-term and
 

3169
01:06:32,599 --> 01:06:35,230
something more short-term and
immediately practical then you know in

3170
01:06:35,230 --> 01:06:35,240
immediately practical then you know in
 

3171
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:36,710
immediately practical then you know in
the bar after the seminar you could

3172
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:36,720
the bar after the seminar you could
 

3173
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:39,910
the bar after the seminar you could
 about AGI in the same breath as

3174
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:39,920
about AGI in the same breath as
 

3175
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,349
about AGI in the same breath as
uh as time travel or or the simulation

3176
01:06:42,349 --> 01:06:42,359
uh as time travel or or the simulation
 

3177
01:06:42,359 --> 01:06:44,549
uh as time travel or or the simulation
hypothesis or something right whereas

3178

hypothesis or something right whereas
 

3179
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:47,470
hypothesis or something right whereas
now now AGI is not only in the academic

3180
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:47,480
now now AGI is not only in the academic
 

3181
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:50,190
now now AGI is not only in the academic
seminar room like you have Vladimir

3182
01:06:50,190 --> 01:06:50,200
seminar room like you have Vladimir
 

3183
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:53,150
seminar room like you have Vladimir
Putin knows what AGI is and he's like

3184
01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:53,160
Putin knows what AGI is and he's like
 

3185
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:55,230
Putin knows what AGI is and he's like
Russia needs to become the leader in AGI

3186
01:06:55,230 --> 01:06:55,240
Russia needs to become the leader in AGI
 

3187
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:56,029
Russia needs to become the leader in AGI
right so

3188
01:06:56,029 --> 01:06:56,039
right so
 

3189
01:06:56,039 --> 01:06:58,109
right so

in the course of this transition I think
 

3221
01:07:40,359 --> 01:07:42,109
in the course of this transition I think
a bunch of sub communities have formed

01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:47,110
still if you look at neurs if you look
at cvpr if you look at these uh eye

3273
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:51,070
at cvpr if you look at these uh eye
clear you know um AGI is still seen as

3274
01:08:51,070 --> 01:08:51,080
clear you know um AGI is still seen as
 

3275
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:53,470
clear you know um AGI is still seen as
the outcast I would still I would say in

01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:55,470
the outcast I would still I would say in
these main machine learning in these

3278
01:08:55,470 --> 01:08:55,480
these main machine learning in these
 

3279
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:58,269
these main machine learning in these
main artificial intelligence uh

3280
01:08:58,269 --> 01:08:58,279
main artificial intelligence uh
 

3281
01:08:58,279 --> 01:09:00,910
main artificial intelligence uh
conferences amongst the researchers I

3282
01:09:00,910 --> 01:09:00,920
conferences amongst the researchers I
 

3283
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:03,709
conferences amongst the researchers I
don't know if it's an accepted term yet

3284
01:09:03,709 --> 01:09:03,719
don't know if it's an accepted term yet
 

3285
01:09:03,719 --> 01:09:07,309
don't know if it's an accepted term yet
I what I've seen bravely you mention

3286
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:07,319
I what I've seen bravely you mention
 

3287
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:10,550
I what I've seen bravely you mention
Shane leg is Deep Mind and then open AI

3288
01:09:10,550 --> 01:09:10,560
Shane leg is Deep Mind and then open AI
 

3289
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:13,630
Shane leg is Deep Mind and then open AI
are the two places that are I would say

3290
01:09:13,630 --> 01:09:13,640
are the two places that are I would say
 

3291
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:16,030
are the two places that are I would say
unapologetically so far I think it's

3292
01:09:16,030 --> 01:09:16,040
unapologetically so far I think it's
 

3293
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:18,189
unapologetically so far I think it's
actually changing unfortunately but so

3294
01:09:18,189 --> 01:09:18,199
actually changing unfortunately but so
 

3295
01:09:18,199 --> 01:09:20,189
actually changing unfortunately but so
far they've been pushing the idea that

3296
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:20,199
far they've been pushing the idea that
 

3297
01:09:20,199 --> 01:09:22,950
far they've been pushing the idea that
the goal is to create an AGI well they

3298
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:22,960
the goal is to create an AGI well they
 

3299
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,590
the goal is to create an AGI well they
have billions of dollars behind them so

3300
01:09:24,590 --> 01:09:24,600
have billions of dollars behind them so
 

3301
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:27,269
have billions of dollars behind them so
I mean that that they in the public mind

3302
01:09:27,269 --> 01:09:27,279
I mean that that they in the public mind
 

3303
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:29,870
I mean that that they in the public mind
that that certainly carries some oomph

3304
01:09:29,870 --> 01:09:29,880
that that certainly carries some oomph
 

3305
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:31,630
that that certainly carries some oomph
right I mean I mean but they also have

3306
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:31,640
right I mean I mean but they also have
 

3307
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:33,149
right I mean I mean but they also have
really strong researchers right they

3308
01:09:33,149 --> 01:09:33,159
really strong researchers right they
 

3309
01:09:33,159 --> 01:09:34,749
really strong researchers right they
they do they're great teams I mean Deep

3310
01:09:34,749 --> 01:09:34,759
they do they're great teams I mean Deep
 

3311
01:09:34,759 --> 01:09:37,229
they do they're great teams I mean Deep
Mind in particular yeah and they have I

3312
01:09:37,229 --> 01:09:37,239
Mind in particular yeah and they have I
 

3313
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:39,630
Mind in particular yeah and they have I
mean Deep Mind has Marcus hutter walking

3314
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:39,640
mean Deep Mind has Marcus hutter walking
 

3315
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:42,229
mean Deep Mind has Marcus hutter walking
around I mean there's all these folks

3316
01:09:42,229 --> 01:09:42,239
around I mean there's all these folks
 

3317
01:09:42,239 --> 01:09:45,110
around I mean there's all these folks
who basically their full-time position

3318
01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:45,120
who basically their full-time position
 

3319
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,709
who basically their full-time position
involves dreaming about creating AGI

3320
01:09:47,709 --> 01:09:47,719
involves dreaming about creating AGI
 

3321
01:09:47,719 --> 01:09:50,510
involves dreaming about creating AGI
yeah I mean Google brain has a lot of

3322
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:50,520
yeah I mean Google brain has a lot of
 

3323
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:53,470
yeah I mean Google brain has a lot of
amazing AGI oriented people also I mean

3324
01:09:53,470 --> 01:09:53,480
amazing AGI oriented people also I mean
 

3325
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:57,470
amazing AGI oriented people also I mean
and and I mean so I'd say from

3326
01:09:57,470 --> 01:09:57,480
and and I mean so I'd say from
 

3327
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:00,430
and and I mean so I'd say from
a public marketing view Deep Mind and

3328
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:00,440
a public marketing view Deep Mind and
 

3329
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:04,149
a public marketing view Deep Mind and
open AI are the two large wef funded

3330
01:10:04,149 --> 01:10:04,159
open AI are the two large wef funded
 

3331
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:06,590
open AI are the two large wef funded
organizations that have put the term and

3332
01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:06,600
organizations that have put the term and
 

3333
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:10,110
organizations that have put the term and
concept AGI out there sort of as part of

3334
01:10:10,110 --> 01:10:10,120
concept AGI out there sort of as part of
 

3335
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:13,750
concept AGI out there sort of as part of
their Public Image but I mean there

3336
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:13,760
their Public Image but I mean there
 

3337
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,709
their Public Image but I mean there
there're certainly not there are other

3338
01:10:15,709 --> 01:10:15,719
there're certainly not there are other
 

3339
01:10:15,719 --> 01:10:17,229
there're certainly not there are other
groups that are doing research that

3340
01:10:17,229 --> 01:10:17,239
groups that are doing research that
 

3341
01:10:17,239 --> 01:10:21,110
groups that are doing research that
seems just as as as aiish to me I mean

3342
01:10:21,110 --> 01:10:21,120
seems just as as as aiish to me I mean
 

3343
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,790
seems just as as as aiish to me I mean
including a bunch of groups in in

3344
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:22,800
including a bunch of groups in in
 

3345
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,910
including a bunch of groups in in
Google's main main Mountain View office

3346
01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:25,920
Google's main main Mountain View office
 

3347
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:31,070
Google's main main Mountain View office
so yeah it's true AGI is

3348
01:10:31,070 --> 01:10:31,080
so yeah it's true AGI is
 

3349
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:33,790
so yeah it's true AGI is
somewhat away from the mainstream now

3350
01:10:33,790 --> 01:10:33,800
somewhat away from the mainstream now
 

3351
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:36,229
somewhat away from the mainstream now
but if you compare to where it was right

3352
01:10:36,229 --> 01:10:36,239
but if you compare to where it was right
 

3353
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:39,030
but if you compare to where it was right
you know 15 years ago there's there's

3354
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:39,040
you know 15 years ago there's there's
 

3355
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,870
you know 15 years ago there's there's
there's there's been an amazing

3356
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:40,880
there's there's been an amazing
 

3357
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,750
there's there's been an amazing
mainstreaming you could say the same

3358
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:42,760
mainstreaming you could say the same
 

3359
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:45,470
mainstreaming you could say the same
thing about super longevity research

3360
01:10:45,470 --> 01:10:45,480
thing about super longevity research
 

3361
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:47,990
thing about super longevity research
which is one of my my application areas

3362
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:48,000
which is one of my my application areas
 

3363
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,149
which is one of my my application areas
that I'm excited about I mean I've been

3364
01:10:51,149 --> 01:10:51,159
that I'm excited about I mean I've been
 

3365
01:10:51,159 --> 01:10:52,910
that I'm excited about I mean I've been
talking about this since the '90s but

3366
01:10:52,910 --> 01:10:52,920
talking about this since the '90s but
 

3367
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:55,870
talking about this since the '90s but
working on this since 2001 and back then

3368
01:10:55,870 --> 01:10:55,880
working on this since 2001 and back then
 

3369
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:58,229
working on this since 2001 and back then
really to say you're trying to create

3370
01:10:58,229 --> 01:10:58,239
really to say you're trying to create
 

3371
01:10:58,239 --> 01:11:00,270
really to say you're trying to create
therapies to allow people to live

3372
01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:00,280
therapies to allow people to live
 

3373
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:02,709
therapies to allow people to live
hundreds or thousands of years you you

3374
01:11:02,709 --> 01:11:02,719
hundreds or thousands of years you you
 

3375
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:04,990
hundreds or thousands of years you you
were way way way way out of out of the

3376
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:05,000
were way way way way out of out of the
 

3377
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,390
were way way way way out of out of the
industry academic mainstream but now you

3378
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:08,400
industry academic mainstream but now you
 

3379
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,669
industry academic mainstream but now you
know Google had had project Calico Craig

3380
01:11:11,669 --> 01:11:11,679
know Google had had project Calico Craig
 

3381
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:14,030
know Google had had project Calico Craig
ventor had human longevity Incorporated

3382
01:11:14,030 --> 01:11:14,040
ventor had human longevity Incorporated
 

3383
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,910
ventor had human longevity Incorporated
and once once the Suits come marching in

3384
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:16,920
and once once the Suits come marching in
 

3385
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:19,110
and once once the Suits come marching in
right I mean once once there's big money

3386
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:19,120
right I mean once once there's big money
 

3387
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,790
right I mean once once there's big money
in it then people are forced to take it

3388
01:11:21,790 --> 01:11:21,800
in it then people are forced to take it
 

3389
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:23,470
in it then people are forced to take it
take it seriously because that's the way

3390
01:11:23,470 --> 01:11:23,480
take it seriously because that's the way
 

3391
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,950
take it seriously because that's the way
Mo modern society works so it's still

3392
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:25,960
Mo modern society works so it's still
 

3393
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:28,350
Mo modern society works so it's still
not as mainstream as cancer research

3394
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:28,360
not as mainstream as cancer research
 

3395
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:31,149
not as mainstream as cancer research
just as AGI is is not as mainstream as

3396
01:11:31,149 --> 01:11:31,159
just as AGI is is not as mainstream as
 

3397
01:11:31,159 --> 01:11:33,390
just as AGI is is not as mainstream as
automated driving or something but the

3398
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:33,400
automated driving or something but the
 

3399
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:35,990
automated driving or something but the
degree of mainstreaming that's happened

3400
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:36,000
degree of mainstreaming that's happened
 

3401
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,990
degree of mainstreaming that's happened
in the last uh you know 10 to 15 years

3402
01:11:38,990 --> 01:11:39,000
in the last uh you know 10 to 15 years
 

3403
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,790
in the last uh you know 10 to 15 years
is is astounding to those of us who've

3404
01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:40,800
is is astounding to those of us who've
 

3405
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,310
is is astounding to those of us who've
been at it for a while yeah but there's

3406
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:43,320
been at it for a while yeah but there's
 

3407
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:45,830
been at it for a while yeah but there's
a marketing aspect to the term but in

3408
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:45,840
a marketing aspect to the term but in
 

3409
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,750
a marketing aspect to the term but in
terms of actual full force research

3410
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:48,760
terms of actual full force research
 

3411
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:51,350
terms of actual full force research
that's going on under the header of AGI

3412
01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:51,360
that's going on under the header of AGI
 

3413
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:54,270
that's going on under the header of AGI
it's currently I would say dominated

3414
01:11:54,270 --> 01:11:54,280
it's currently I would say dominated
 

3415
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:56,510
it's currently I would say dominated
maybe you can disag degree dominated by

3416
01:11:56,510 --> 01:11:56,520
maybe you can disag degree dominated by
 

3417
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:59,070
maybe you can disag degree dominated by
neural networks research that the

3418
01:11:59,070 --> 01:11:59,080
neural networks research that the
 

3419
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:02,709
neural networks research that the
nonlinear regression as you mentioned um

3420
01:12:02,709 --> 01:12:02,719
nonlinear regression as you mentioned um
 

3421
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:05,189
nonlinear regression as you mentioned um

01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:18,840
to capture a deep element of
 

3431
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:21,750
to capture a deep element of
intelligence that needs to be there like

3432
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:21,760
intelligence that needs to be there like
 

3433
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,310
intelligence that needs to be there like
you said it needs to learn it needs to

3434
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:23,320
you said it needs to learn it needs to
 

3435
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:25,629
you said it needs to learn it needs to
be automated somehow but that seems to

3436
01:12:25,629 --> 01:12:25,639
be automated somehow but that seems to
 

3437
01:12:25,639 --> 01:12:29,149
be automated somehow but that seems to
be missing from a lot of the a lot of

3438
01:12:29,149 --> 01:12:29,159
be missing from a lot of the a lot of
 

3439
01:12:29,159 --> 01:12:33,310
be missing from a lot of the a lot of
research currently um so what's your

3440
01:12:33,310 --> 01:12:33,320
research currently um so what's your
 

3441
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:35,390
research currently um so what's your
sense I guess one way to ask this

3442
01:12:35,390 --> 01:12:35,400
sense I guess one way to ask this
 

3443
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:38,310
sense I guess one way to ask this
question what's your sense of what kind

3444
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:38,320
question what's your sense of what kind
 

3445
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:42,590
question what's your sense of what kind
of things will an AGI system need to

3446
01:12:42,590 --> 01:12:42,600
of things will an AGI system need to
 

3447
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:45,550
of things will an AGI system need to
have yeah that that's a very interesting

3448
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:45,560
have yeah that that's a very interesting
 

3449
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:47,270
have yeah that that's a very interesting
topic that I thought about for for a

3450
01:12:47,270 --> 01:12:47,280
topic that I thought about for for a
 

3451
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:50,390
topic that I thought about for for a
long time and I I think

3452
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:50,400
long time and I I think
 

3453
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:53,750
long time and I I think
there are many many different approaches

3454
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:53,760
there are many many different approaches
 

3455
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,790
there are many many different approaches
that can work for getting to to human

3456
01:12:55,790 --> 01:12:55,800
that can work for getting to to human
 

3457
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:59,070
that can work for getting to to human
level AI so I I I don't I don't think

3458
01:12:59,070 --> 01:12:59,080
level AI so I I I don't I don't think
 

3459
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:03,030
level AI so I I I don't I don't think
there's like one golden algorithm one

3460
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:03,040
there's like one golden algorithm one
 

3461
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:05,110
there's like one golden algorithm one
one golden design that that that can

3462
01:13:05,110 --> 01:13:05,120
one golden design that that that can
 

3463
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:08,830
one golden design that that that can
that can work and I mean flying machines

3464
01:13:08,830 --> 01:13:08,840
that can work and I mean flying machines
 

3465
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:11,430
that can work and I mean flying machines
is the the much warant analogy here

3466
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:11,440
is the the much warant analogy here
 

3467
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:12,830
is the the much warant analogy here
right like I mean you have airplanes you

3468
01:13:12,830 --> 01:13:12,840
right like I mean you have airplanes you
 

3469
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:14,709
right like I mean you have airplanes you
have helicopters you you you you have

3470
01:13:14,709 --> 01:13:14,719
have helicopters you you you you have
 

3471
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:17,149
have helicopters you you you you have
balloons you have stealth bombers that

3472
01:13:17,149 --> 01:13:17,159
balloons you have stealth bombers that
 

3473
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:18,990
balloons you have stealth bombers that
don't look like regular airplanes you

3474
01:13:18,990 --> 01:13:19,000
don't look like regular airplanes you
 

3475
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,590
don't look like regular airplanes you
you've got all blimps Birds too Birds

3476
01:13:22,590 --> 01:13:22,600
you've got all blimps Birds too Birds
 

3477
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:26,750
you've got all blimps Birds too Birds
yeah and and bugs right and uh you I

3478
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:26,760
yeah and and bugs right and uh you I
 

3479
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:28,590
yeah and and bugs right and uh you I
mean and there are certainly many kinds

3480
01:13:28,590 --> 01:13:28,600
mean and there are certainly many kinds
 

3481
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:30,270
mean and there are certainly many kinds
of flying machines that and there's a

3482
01:13:30,270 --> 01:13:30,280
of flying machines that and there's a
 

3483
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:32,070
of flying machines that and there's a
catapult that you can just

3484
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:32,080
catapult that you can just
 

3485
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,910
catapult that you can just
launch there's bicycle powered like uh

3486
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:34,920
launch there's bicycle powered like uh
 

3487
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:38,470
launch there's bicycle powered like uh
flying machines right nice yeah yeah so

3488
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:38,480
flying machines right nice yeah yeah so
 

3489
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,510
flying machines right nice yeah yeah so
now these are all analyzable by a basic

3490
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:41,520
now these are all analyzable by a basic
 

3491
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,669
now these are all analyzable by a basic
theory of of aerodynamics right now so

3492
01:13:44,669 --> 01:13:44,679
theory of of aerodynamics right now so
 

3493
01:13:44,679 --> 01:13:47,590
theory of of aerodynamics right now so
one issue with AGI is we don't yet have

3494
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:47,600
one issue with AGI is we don't yet have
 

3495
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,709
one issue with AGI is we don't yet have
the analog of the theory of aerodynamics

3496
01:13:50,709 --> 01:13:50,719
the analog of the theory of aerodynamics
 

3497
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:53,870
the analog of the theory of aerodynamics
and that's that's what Marcus hter was

3498
01:13:53,870 --> 01:13:53,880
and that's that's what Marcus hter was
 

3499
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:56,390
and that's that's what Marcus hter was
trying to make with the Axe and his

3500
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:56,400
trying to make with the Axe and his
 

3501
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,790
trying to make with the Axe and his
general theory of general intelligence

3502
01:13:58,790 --> 01:13:58,800
general theory of general intelligence
 

3503
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:02,149
general theory of general intelligence
but that theory in its most clearly

3504
01:14:02,149 --> 01:14:02,159
but that theory in its most clearly
 

3505
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:04,470
but that theory in its most clearly
articulated Parts really only works for

3506
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:04,480
articulated Parts really only works for
 

3507
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:07,229
articulated Parts really only works for
either infinitely powerful machines or

3508
01:14:07,229 --> 01:14:07,239
either infinitely powerful machines or
 

3509
01:14:07,239 --> 01:14:10,390
either infinitely powerful machines or
almost or insanely yeah impractically

3510
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:10,400
almost or insanely yeah impractically
 

3511
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,990
almost or insanely yeah impractically
powerful machines so I mean if if you

3512
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:13,000
powerful machines so I mean if if you
 

3513
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,470
powerful machines so I mean if if you
were going to take a theory based

3514
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:14,480
were going to take a theory based
 

3515
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:17,310
were going to take a theory based
approach to AGI what you would do is say

3516
01:14:17,310 --> 01:14:17,320
approach to AGI what you would do is say
 

3517
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:21,310
approach to AGI what you would do is say
well let's let's take what's called say

3518
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:21,320
well let's let's take what's called say
 

3519
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:24,669
well let's let's take what's called say
axe TL which is which is hutter's Axe

3520
01:14:24,669 --> 01:14:24,679
axe TL which is which is hutter's Axe
 

3521
01:14:24,679 --> 01:14:27,790
axe TL which is which is hutter's Axe
machine that can work on merely insanely

3522
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:27,800
machine that can work on merely insanely
 

3523
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:29,510
machine that can work on merely insanely
much processing power rather than

3524
01:14:29,510 --> 01:14:29,520
much processing power rather than
 

3525
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,629
much processing power rather than
infinitely much what does TL stand for

3526
01:14:31,629 --> 01:14:31,639
infinitely much what does TL stand for
 

3527
01:14:31,639 --> 01:14:34,470
infinitely much what does TL stand for
uh time time and length Okay so you're

3528
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:34,480
uh time time and length Okay so you're
 

3529
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,510
uh time time and length Okay so you're
basically how how constrained somehow

3530
01:14:36,510 --> 01:14:36,520
basically how how constrained somehow
 

3531
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:38,550
basically how how constrained somehow
yeah yeah yeah so how how axe Works

3532
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:38,560
yeah yeah yeah so how how axe Works
 

3533
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:42,390
yeah yeah yeah so how how axe Works
basically is each each each action that

3534
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:42,400
basically is each each each action that
 

3535
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,669
basically is each each each action that
it wants to take before taking that

3536
01:14:44,669 --> 01:14:44,679
it wants to take before taking that
 

3537
01:14:44,679 --> 01:14:47,070
it wants to take before taking that
action it looks at all its history yeah

3538
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:47,080
action it looks at all its history yeah
 

3539
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:49,270
action it looks at all its history yeah
and then it looks at all possible

3540
01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:49,280
and then it looks at all possible
 

3541
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:50,750
and then it looks at all possible
programs that it could use to make a

3542
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:50,760
programs that it could use to make a
 

3543
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:52,790
programs that it could use to make a
decision yeah and it decides like which

3544
01:14:52,790 --> 01:14:52,800
decision yeah and it decides like which
 

3545
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,149
decision yeah and it decides like which
decision program would have let it make

3546
01:14:55,149 --> 01:14:55,159
decision program would have let it make
 

3547
01:14:55,159 --> 01:14:56,590
decision program would have let it make
the best decisions according to its

3548
01:14:56,590 --> 01:14:56,600
the best decisions according to its
 

3549
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,669
the best decisions according to its
reward function over its history and he

3550
01:14:58,669 --> 01:14:58,679
reward function over its history and he
 

3551
01:14:58,679 --> 01:15:00,550
reward function over its history and he
uses that decision program to take to

3552
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:00,560
uses that decision program to take to
 

3553
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,390
uses that decision program to take to
make the next decision right it's not

3554
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:02,400
make the next decision right it's not
 

3555
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,870
make the next decision right it's not
afraid of infinite resources it's

3556
01:15:04,870 --> 01:15:04,880
afraid of infinite resources it's
 

3557
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,629
afraid of infinite resources it's
searching through the space of all

3558
01:15:06,629 --> 01:15:06,639
searching through the space of all
 

3559
01:15:06,639 --> 01:15:08,950
searching through the space of all
possible computer programs in between

3560
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:08,960
possible computer programs in between
 

3561
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,790
possible computer programs in between
each action and each next Action Now

3562
01:15:11,790 --> 01:15:11,800
each action and each next Action Now
 

3563
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:14,310
each action and each next Action Now
XL searches through all possible

3564
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:14,320
XL searches through all possible
 

3565
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,270
XL searches through all possible
computer programs that have runtime less

3566
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:16,280
computer programs that have runtime less
 

3567
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:19,669
computer programs that have runtime less
than T and length less than l so it's

3568
01:15:19,669 --> 01:15:19,679
than T and length less than l so it's
 

3569
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:21,270
than T and length less than l so it's
which is still an impracticably

3570
01:15:21,270 --> 01:15:21,280
which is still an impracticably
 

3571
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:26,070
which is still an impracticably
humongous space right so what what you

3572
01:15:26,070 --> 01:15:26,080
humongous space right so what what you
 

3573
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:28,270
humongous space right so what what you
would like to do to make an AGI and what

3574
01:15:28,270 --> 01:15:28,280
would like to do to make an AGI and what
 

3575
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:29,790
would like to do to make an AGI and what
will probably be done 50 years from now

3576
01:15:29,790 --> 01:15:29,800
will probably be done 50 years from now
 

3577
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:32,910
will probably be done 50 years from now
to make an AGI is say okay well we we we

3578
01:15:32,910 --> 01:15:32,920
to make an AGI is say okay well we we we
 

3579
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:35,270
to make an AGI is say okay well we we we
have some constraints we have these

3580
01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:35,280
have some constraints we have these
 

3581
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:38,910
have some constraints we have these
processing power constraints and you

3582
01:15:38,910 --> 01:15:38,920
processing power constraints and you
 

3583
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:40,390
processing power constraints and you
know we have the space and time

3584
01:15:40,390 --> 01:15:40,400

01:16:25,510 --> 01:16:25,520
then it will spit out
 

3621
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:29,110
then it will spit out
like the the specialized version of Axl

3622
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:29,120
like the the specialized version of Axl

and that that that I think is how our

3628
01:16:35,270 --> 01:16:35,280
and that that that I think is how our
 

3629
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:38,390
and that that that I think is how our
super AGI will create new AGI systems

01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:38,400
super AGI will create new AGI systems
 

3631
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:40,669
super AGI will create new AGI systems
right but but and that's a very rough

3632
01:16:40,669 --> 01:16:40,679
right but but and that's a very rough
 

3633
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:41,950
right but but and that's a very rough
seems really inefficient that's a very

01:16:48,189 --> 01:16:48,199
came out of Russia can you backtrack so
 

3641
01:16:48,199 --> 01:16:50,149
came out of Russia can you backtrack so
what is program specialization so it's

01:16:50,149 --> 01:16:50,159
what is program specialization so it's
 

3643
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:52,590
what is program specialization so it's
basically well say take take take

sorting for example you can have a

3646
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:54,120
sorting for example you can have a
 

3647
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:56,750
sorting for example you can have a
generic program for sorting lists but

3648
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:56,760
generic program for sorting lists but
 

3649
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:58,149
generic program for sorting lists but
what if all your lists you care about

3650
01:16:58,149 --> 01:16:58,159
what if all your lists you care about
 

3651
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:00,430
what if all your lists you care about
are length 10,000 or less got it you can

3652
01:17:00,430 --> 01:17:00,440
are length 10,000 or less got it you can
 

3653
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:02,629
are length 10,000 or less got it you can
run an automated program specializer on

3654
01:17:02,629 --> 01:17:02,639
run an automated program specializer on
 

3655
01:17:02,639 --> 01:17:04,590
run an automated program specializer on
your sorting algorithm and it will come

3656
01:17:04,590 --> 01:17:04,600
your sorting algorithm and it will come
 

3657
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:06,270
your sorting algorithm and it will come
up with the algorithm that's optimal for

3658
01:17:06,270 --> 01:17:06,280
up with the algorithm that's optimal for
 

3659
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:08,470
up with the algorithm that's optimal for
sorting lists of length 1,000 or Le or

3660
01:17:08,470 --> 01:17:08,480
sorting lists of length 1,000 or Le or
 

3661
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,669
sorting lists of length 1,000 or Le or
10,000 or less right it's kind of like

3662
01:17:10,669 --> 01:17:10,679
10,000 or less right it's kind of like
 

3663
01:17:10,679 --> 01:17:12,510
10,000 or less right it's kind of like
isn't that the kind of the process of

01:17:12,510 --> 01:17:12,520
isn't that the kind of the process of
 

3665
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:15,350
isn't that the kind of the process of
evolution is uh it's a program

3666
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:15,360
evolution is uh it's a program
 

3667
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:18,149
evolution is uh it's a program
specializer to the environment so you're

3668
01:17:18,149 --> 01:17:18,159
specializer to the environment so you're
 

3669
01:17:18,159 --> 01:17:20,430
specializer to the environment so you're
you're kind of evolving human beings or

01:17:33,229 --> 01:17:33,239
there there's a long history of of
 

3681
01:17:33,239 --> 01:17:35,390
there there's a long history of of
thinking about Evolution Evolution that

3682
01:17:35,390 --> 01:17:35,400
thinking about Evolution Evolution that
 

3683
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:38,189
thinking about Evolution Evolution that
way that way also right so well my my my

3684
01:17:38,189 --> 01:17:38,199
way that way also right so well my my my
 

3685
01:17:38,199 --> 01:17:40,070
way that way also right so well my my my
my point is that what we're thinking of

3686
01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:40,080
my point is that what we're thinking of
 

3687
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,910
my point is that what we're thinking of
as a human level general

3688
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:42,920
as a human level general
 

3689

3693
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:50,750
narrow AIS like are being used in the
commercial AI field now then you're

3694
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:50,760
commercial AI field now then you're
 

3695
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,430
commercial AI field now then you're
thinking okay how do we make it more and

3696
01:17:52,430 --> 01:17:52,440
thinking okay how do we make it more and
 

3697
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:54,830
thinking okay how do we make it more and
more General on the other hand if you

3698
01:17:54,830 --> 01:17:54,840
more General on the other hand if you
 

3699
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:57,510
more General on the other hand if you
start from aexi or Schmid Uber's girdle

01:17:57,510 --> 01:17:57,520
start from aexi or Schmid Uber's girdle

then getting to a human level AGI is a

3706
01:18:06,629 --> 01:18:06,639
then getting to a human level AGI is a
 

3707
01:18:06,639 --> 01:18:08,790
then getting to a human level AGI is a
matter of specialization it's like how

3708
01:18:08,790 --> 01:18:08,800
matter of specialization it's like how
 

3709
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:10,870
matter of specialization it's like how
do you how do you take these maximally

3710
01:18:10,870 --> 01:18:10,880
do you how do you take these maximally
 

3711
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:13,430
do you how do you take these maximally
General learning processes and how do

01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:13,440
General learning processes and how do
 

3713
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:16,750
General learning processes and how do
you how do you specialize them so that

3714
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:16,760
you how do you specialize them so that
 

3715
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:18,510
you how do you specialize them so that
they can operate within the resource

3716
01:18:18,510 --> 01:18:18,520
they can operate within the resource
 

3717
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:21,629
they can operate within the resource
constraints that you have but will

01:18:31,709 --> 01:18:31,719
a maze in 750 Dimensions you'll probably
 

3729
01:18:31,719 --> 01:18:34,590
a maze in 750 Dimensions you'll probably
be very slow whereas at two Dimensions

3730
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:34,600
be very slow whereas at two Dimensions
 

3731
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:36,110
be very slow whereas at two Dimensions
you you're probably you're probably way

you you're probably you're probably way
 

3733
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:39,030
you you're probably you're probably way
better right so I mean we're special be

3734
01:18:39,030 --> 01:18:39,040
better right so I mean we're special be
 

3735
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:41,430
better right so I mean we're special be

3843
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,910

okay cool but yeah going back to your

01:20:58,070 --> 01:20:58,080
okay cool but yeah going back to your

01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,149
okay cool but yeah going back to your
your original question

01:21:00,149 --> 01:21:00,159
your original question
 

3851
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:05,310
your original question
so the the way I look at human level AGI

3852
01:21:05,310 --> 01:21:05,320
so the the way I look at human level AGI
 

3853
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:07,229
so the the way I look at human level AGI
is yeah how do you

3854
01:21:07,229 --> 01:21:07,239
is yeah how do you
 

3855
01:21:07,239 --> 01:21:10,229
is yeah how do you
specialize you know unrealistically

3856

communication prior and can you maybe
 

4011
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,189
communication prior and can you maybe
explain it a little bit yeah yeah what

4012
01:24:23,189 --> 01:24:23,199
explain it a little bit yeah yeah what
 

4013
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:25,629
explain it a little bit yeah yeah what
what I meant was you know what are we

01:24:55,239 --> 01:24:57,270
in a world of solid objects and these
things are very obvious but if you

look at you know how would you realize
some Specialized or constrained version

4052
01:25:15,830 --> 01:25:15,840
some Specialized or constrained version
 

4053
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:18,709
some Specialized or constrained version
of universal general intelligence in a

4054
01:25:18,709 --> 01:25:18,719
of universal general intelligence in a
 

4055
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:21,070
of universal general intelligence in a
system that has you know limited memory

4056
01:25:21,070 --> 01:25:21,080
system that has you know limited memory
 

4057
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:24,310
system that has you know limited memory
and limited speed of processing but who

4058
01:25:24,310 --> 01:25:24,320
and limited speed of processing but who
 

4059
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:26,109
and limited speed of processing but who
general intelligence will be biased

4060
01:25:26,109 --> 01:25:26,119
general intelligence will be biased
 

4061
01:25:26,119 --> 01:25:28,790
general intelligence will be biased
toward controlling a solid object agent

4062
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:28,800
toward controlling a solid object agent
 

4063
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:31,229
toward controlling a solid object agent
which is Mobile in a solid object world

4064
01:25:31,229 --> 01:25:31,239
which is Mobile in a solid object world
 

4065
01:25:31,239 --> 01:25:34,070
which is Mobile in a solid object world
for manipulating solid objects and

4066
01:25:34,070 --> 01:25:34,080
for manipulating solid objects and
 

4067
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:37,070
for manipulating solid objects and
communicating via language with other

4068
01:25:37,070 --> 01:25:37,080
communicating via language with other
 

4069
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:39,950
communicating via language with other
similar agents in that same world right

4070
01:25:39,950 --> 01:25:39,960
similar agents in that same world right
 

4071
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:41,870
similar agents in that same world right
then starting from that you're starting

4072
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:41,880
then starting from that you're starting
 

4073
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:44,310
then starting from that you're starting
to get a requirements analysis for for

4074
01:25:44,310 --> 01:25:44,320
to get a requirements analysis for for
 

4075
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:47,350
to get a requirements analysis for for
for human human level general

4076
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:47,360
for human human level general
 

4077
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:49,590
for human human level general
intelligence and then that that leads

4078
01:25:49,590 --> 01:25:49,600
intelligence and then that that leads
 

4079
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:51,189
intelligence and then that that leads
you into cognitive science and you can

4080
01:25:51,189 --> 01:25:51,199
you into cognitive science and you can
 

4081
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:52,950
you into cognitive science and you can
look at say what are the different types

4082
01:25:52,950 --> 01:25:52,960
look at say what are the different types
 

4083
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:56,350
look at say what are the different types
of memory that the human mind and brain

4084
01:25:56,350 --> 01:25:56,360
of memory that the human mind and brain
 

4085
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:59,669
of memory that the human mind and brain
has and this this has matured over the

4086
01:25:59,669 --> 01:25:59,679
has and this this has matured over the
 

4087
01:25:59,679 --> 01:26:01,910
has and this this has matured over the
last decades and I got into this a lot

4088
01:26:01,910 --> 01:26:01,920
last decades and I got into this a lot
 

4089
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:04,709
last decades and I got into this a lot
in so after getting my PhD in math I was

4090
01:26:04,709 --> 01:26:04,719
in so after getting my PhD in math I was
 

4091
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:06,430
in so after getting my PhD in math I was
an academic for eight years I was in

4092
01:26:06,430 --> 01:26:06,440
an academic for eight years I was in
 

4093
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:09,189
an academic for eight years I was in

psychology department the University of
 

4099
01:26:13,239 --> 01:26:15,590
psychology department the University of
Western Australia I was focused on

4100
01:26:15,590 --> 01:26:15,600
Western Australia I was focused on
 

4101
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,910
Western Australia I was focused on
cognitive science of of memory and and

4102
01:26:17,910 --> 01:26:17,920
cognitive science of of memory and and
 

4103
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:19,709
cognitive science of of memory and and
perception actually I was I was teaching

4104
01:26:19,709 --> 01:26:19,719
perception actually I was I was teaching
 

4105
01:26:19,719 --> 01:26:21,470
perception actually I was I was teaching
neuron Nets and deep neural Nets and it

4106
01:26:21,470 --> 01:26:21,480
neuron Nets and deep neural Nets and it
 

4107
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:23,590
neuron Nets and deep neural Nets and it
was multi-layer perceptrons right

4108
01:26:23,590 --> 01:26:23,600
was multi-layer perceptrons right
 

4109
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:26,510
was multi-layer perceptrons right
psychology yeah a cognitive science it

4110
01:26:26,510 --> 01:26:26,520
psychology yeah a cognitive science it
 

4111
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:28,669
psychology yeah a cognitive science it
was cross disciplinary among engineering

4112
01:26:28,669 --> 01:26:28,679
was cross disciplinary among engineering
 

4113
01:26:28,679 --> 01:26:32,030
was cross disciplinary among engineering
math psychology philosophy Linguistics

4114
01:26:32,030 --> 01:26:32,040
math psychology philosophy Linguistics
 

4115
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:34,189
math psychology philosophy Linguistics
Compu computer science but yeah we we

4116
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:34,199
Compu computer science but yeah we we
 

4117
01:26:34,199 --> 01:26:37,310
Compu computer science but yeah we we
were teaching psychology students to try

4118
01:26:37,310 --> 01:26:37,320
were teaching psychology students to try
 

4119
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:39,390
were teaching psychology students to try
to model the data from Human cognition

4120
01:26:39,390 --> 01:26:39,400
to model the data from Human cognition
 

4121
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:41,350
to model the data from Human cognition
experiments using multi-layer

4122
01:26:41,350 --> 01:26:41,360
experiments using multi-layer
 

4123
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:43,390
experiments using multi-layer
perceptrons which was the early version

4124
01:26:43,390 --> 01:26:43,400
perceptrons which was the early version
 

4125
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:46,870
perceptrons which was the early version
of a deep neural network very very yeah

4126
01:26:46,870 --> 01:26:46,880
of a deep neural network very very yeah
 

4127
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:49,109
of a deep neural network very very yeah
recurrent back propop was very very slow

4128
01:26:49,109 --> 01:26:49,119
recurrent back propop was very very slow
 

4129
01:26:49,119 --> 01:26:51,790
recurrent back propop was very very slow
to train back then right so this is the

4130
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:51,800
to train back then right so this is the
 

4131
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:53,990
to train back then right so this is the
study of these constraint systems that

4132
01:26:53,990 --> 01:26:54,000
study of these constraint systems that
 

4133
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,350
study of these constraint systems that
are supposed to deal with physical

4134
01:26:55,350 --> 01:26:55,360
are supposed to deal with physical
 

4135
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:57,390
are supposed to deal with physical
object so if you look if you look

4136
01:26:57,390 --> 01:26:57,400
object so if you look if you look
 

4137
01:26:57,400 --> 01:27:01,390
object so if you look if you look
at if you look at cognitive psychology

4138
01:27:01,390 --> 01:27:01,400
at if you look at cognitive psychology
 

4139
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:04,030
at if you look at cognitive psychology
you can see there's multiple types of

4140
01:27:04,030 --> 01:27:04,040
you can see there's multiple types of
 

4141
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:05,990
you can see there's multiple types of
memory which are to some extent

4142
01:27:05,990 --> 01:27:06,000
memory which are to some extent
 

4143
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,669
memory which are to some extent
represented by different subsystems in

4144
01:27:07,669 --> 01:27:07,679
represented by different subsystems in
 

4145
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:09,350
represented by different subsystems in
the human brain so we have episodic

4146
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:09,360
the human brain so we have episodic
 

4147
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:12,390
the human brain so we have episodic
memory which takes into account our life

4148
01:27:12,390 --> 01:27:12,400
memory which takes into account our life
 

4149
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:14,350
memory which takes into account our life
history and everything that's happened

4150
01:27:14,350 --> 01:27:14,360
history and everything that's happened
 

4151
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:16,830
history and everything that's happened
to us we have declarative or semantic

4152
01:27:16,830 --> 01:27:16,840
to us we have declarative or semantic
 

4153
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:19,350
to us we have declarative or semantic
memory which is like facts and beliefs

4154
01:27:19,350 --> 01:27:19,360
memory which is like facts and beliefs
 

4155
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:20,950
memory which is like facts and beliefs
abstracted from the particular

4156
01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:20,960
abstracted from the particular
 

4157
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:23,430
abstracted from the particular
situations as they occurred in there's

4158
01:27:23,430 --> 01:27:23,440
situations as they occurred in there's
 

4159
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:26,109
situations as they occurred in there's
sensory memory which to some extent is

4160
01:27:26,109 --> 01:27:26,119
sensory memory which to some extent is
 

4161
01:27:26,119 --> 01:27:28,270
sensory memory which to some extent is
sense modality specific and then to some

4162
01:27:28,270 --> 01:27:28,280
sense modality specific and then to some
 

4163
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:32,470
sense modality specific and then to some
extent is is Unified ac across across

4164
01:27:32,470 --> 01:27:32,480
extent is is Unified ac across across
 

4165
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,149
extent is is Unified ac across across
sense modalities there's procedural

4166
01:27:34,149 --> 01:27:34,159
sense modalities there's procedural
 

4167
01:27:34,159 --> 01:27:36,189
sense modalities there's procedural
memory memory of how to do stuff like

4168
01:27:36,189 --> 01:27:36,199
memory memory of how to do stuff like
 

4169
01:27:36,199 --> 01:27:38,109
memory memory of how to do stuff like
how how to swing the tennis racket right

4170
01:27:38,109 --> 01:27:38,119
how how to swing the tennis racket right
 

4171
01:27:38,119 --> 01:27:40,070
how how to swing the tennis racket right
which is there's motor memory but it's

4172
01:27:40,070 --> 01:27:40,080
which is there's motor memory but it's
 

4173
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:42,229
which is there's motor memory but it's
also a little more more abstract than

4174
01:27:42,229 --> 01:27:42,239
also a little more more abstract than
 

4175
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:44,950
also a little more more abstract than
than motor memory it involves cerebellum

4176
01:27:44,950 --> 01:27:44,960
than motor memory it involves cerebellum
 

4177
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:48,149
than motor memory it involves cerebellum
and cortex working working together then

4178
01:27:48,149 --> 01:27:48,159
and cortex working working together then
 

4179
01:27:48,159 --> 01:27:50,870
and cortex working working together then
then there's there's memory linkage with

01:27:50,870 --> 01:27:50,880
then there's there's memory linkage with
 

4181
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:52,750
then there's there's memory linkage with
emotion between with which has to do

01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:27,709
like differently tuned modes of
long-term potentiation to do with the

4212
01:28:27,709 --> 01:28:27,719
long-term potentiation to do with the
 

4213
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:29,590
long-term potentiation to do with the
types of neurons and neurotransmitters

4214
01:28:29,590 --> 01:28:29,600
types of neurons and neurotransmitters
 

4215
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,189
types of neurons and neurotransmitters
and the different parts of the brain

4216
01:28:31,189 --> 01:28:31,199
and the different parts of the brain
 

4217
01:28:31,199 --> 01:28:32,590
and the different parts of the brain
correspond to these different types of

01:28:32,590 --> 01:28:32,600
correspond to these different types of
 

4219
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:34,629
correspond to these different types of
knowledge and these different types of

4220
01:28:34,629 --> 01:28:34,639
knowledge and these different types of
 

4221
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:37,229
knowledge and these different types of
memory and learning in the human brain I

4222
01:28:37,229 --> 01:28:37,239
memory and learning in the human brain I
 

4223
01:28:37,239 --> 01:28:39,470
memory and learning in the human brain I
mean you can back these all into

4224
01:28:39,470 --> 01:28:39,480
mean you can back these all into
 

4225
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:41,430
mean you can back these all into
embodied communication for controlling

4226
01:28:41,430 --> 01:28:41,440

01:28:43,629 --> 01:28:43,639
agents and in Worlds of of of solid
 

4229
01:28:43,639 --> 01:28:45,870
agents and in Worlds of of of solid
objects now so if you look at building

4230
01:28:45,870 --> 01:28:45,880
objects now so if you look at building
 

4231
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:48,750
objects now so if you look at building
an AGI system one way to do it which

4232
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:48,760
an AGI system one way to do it which
 

4233
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:50,470
an AGI system one way to do it which
starts more from cognitive science than

4234
01:28:50,470 --> 01:28:50,480
starts more from cognitive science than
 

4235
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:53,510
starts more from cognitive science than
Neuroscience is to say okay what are the

4236
01:28:53,510 --> 01:28:53,520
Neuroscience is to say okay what are the
 

4237
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:56,550
Neuroscience is to say okay what are the
types of memory that that are necessary

4238
01:28:56,550 --> 01:28:56,560
types of memory that that are necessary
 

4239
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:57,750
types of memory that that are necessary
for this kind of world yeah yeah

4240
01:28:57,750 --> 01:28:57,760
for this kind of world yeah yeah
 

4241
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:59,709
for this kind of world yeah yeah
necessary for this this sort of

4242
01:28:59,709 --> 01:28:59,719
necessary for this this sort of
 

4243
01:28:59,719 --> 01:29:02,470
necessary for this this sort of
intelligence what types of learning work

4244
01:29:02,470 --> 01:29:02,480
intelligence what types of learning work
 

4245
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:03,870
intelligence what types of learning work
well with these different types of

4246
01:29:03,870 --> 01:29:03,880
well with these different types of
 

4247
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:06,109
well with these different types of
memory and then how do you connect all

4248
01:29:06,109 --> 01:29:06,119
memory and then how do you connect all
 

4249
01:29:06,119 --> 01:29:08,310
memory and then how do you connect all
these things together right and of

4250
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:08,320
these things together right and of
 

4251
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:10,109
these things together right and of
course the human brain did it

4252
01:29:10,109 --> 01:29:10,119
course the human brain did it
 

4253
01:29:10,119 --> 01:29:12,550
course the human brain did it
incrementally through Evolution because

4257
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:16,709
each of the subn networks of the brain I

they all grew up communicating and
 

4275
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:35,189
they all grew up communicating and
adapting to each other it's not like

4276
01:29:35,189 --> 01:29:35,199
adapting to each other it's not like
 

4277
01:29:35,199 --> 01:29:37,030
adapting to each other it's not like
they were separate black boxes that were

4278
01:29:37,030 --> 01:29:37,040
they were separate black boxes that were
 

4279
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:40,270
they were separate black boxes that were
then were then glommed together right

4280
01:29:40,270 --> 01:29:40,280
then were then glommed together right
 

4281
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:43,109
then were then glommed together right
whereas as Engineers we would tend to

01:29:43,109 --> 01:29:43,119
whereas as Engineers we would tend to
 

4283
01:29:43,119 --> 01:29:44,750

say let's make let's make the

4284
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:44,760
say let's make let's make the
 

4285
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:46,870
say let's make let's make the
declarative memory box here and the

4286
01:29:46,870 --> 01:29:46,880
declarative memory box here and the
 

4287
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:48,629
declarative memory box here and the
procedural memory box here and the

4288

4290
01:29:50,709 --> 01:29:50,719
perception box here and W wire them
 

4291
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:53,189

together and when you can do that it's

4292
01:29:53,189 --> 01:29:53,199
together and when you can do that it's
 

4293
01:29:53,199 --> 01:29:54,910
together and when you can do that it's
it's interesting I mean that's how a car

4294
01:29:54,910 --> 01:29:54,920
it's interesting I mean that's how a car
 

4295
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:57,709
it's interesting I mean that's how a car
is built right but on the other hand

4296
01:29:57,709 --> 01:29:57,719
is built right but on the other hand
 

4297
01:29:57,719 --> 01:29:59,470
is built right but on the other hand
that's clearly not how biological

4298
01:29:59,470 --> 01:29:59,480
that's clearly not how biological
 

4299
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:02,350
that's clearly not how biological
systems are are are made the parts

4300
01:30:02,350 --> 01:30:02,360
systems are are are made the parts
 

4301
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:04,590
systems are are are made the parts
coevolve so as to adapt and and work

4302
01:30:04,590 --> 01:30:04,600
coevolve so as to adapt and and work
 

4303
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:06,470
coevolve so as to adapt and and work
together so this that's by the way how

4304
01:30:06,470 --> 01:30:06,480
together so this that's by the way how
 

4305
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:10,149
together so this that's by the way how
every human engineered system that flies

4306
01:30:10,149 --> 01:30:10,159
every human engineered system that flies

every human engineered system that flies
that was were using that analogy before

4308
01:30:11,870 --> 01:30:11,880
that was were using that analogy before

01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:13,669
that was were using that analogy before
is built as well so do you find this at

4310
01:30:13,669 --> 01:30:13,679
is built as well so do you find this at
 

4311
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:15,790
is built as well so do you find this at
all appealing like there's been a lot of

4312
01:30:15,790 --> 01:30:15,800
all appealing like there's been a lot of
 

4313
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:18,149
all appealing like there's been a lot of
really exciting which I find strange

4314
01:30:18,149 --> 01:30:18,159
really exciting which I find strange
 

4315
01:30:18,159 --> 01:30:20,669
really exciting which I find strange
that it's ignored uh work in cognitive

4316
01:30:20,669 --> 01:30:20,679
that it's ignored uh work in cognitive
 

4317
01:30:20,679 --> 01:30:22,310
that it's ignored uh work in cognitive

01:30:26,790 --> 01:30:26,800
yeah I mean I I I had a lot to do with
 

4323
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:29,030
yeah I mean I I I had a lot to do with
that with that community and you know

these different cognitive architectures
and how I was looking at the AI World

4336
01:30:42,350 --> 01:30:42,360
and how I was looking at the AI World
 

4337
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:45,590
and how I was looking at the AI World
about 10 years ago before this whole

01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:50,080
on the one hand you had these cognitive
 

4343
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:52,149
on the one hand you had these cognitive
architecture guys who were working

4344
01:30:52,149 --> 01:30:52,159
architecture guys who were working
 

4345
01:30:52,159 --> 01:30:54,030
architecture guys who were working
closely with psychologists and cognitive

closely with psychologists and cognitive
 

4347
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:55,910
closely with psychologists and cognitive
scientists who had thought a lot about

4348
01:30:55,910 --> 01:30:55,920
scientists who had thought a lot about
 

4349
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:58,149
scientists who had thought a lot about
how the different parts of a humanlike

4350
01:30:58,149 --> 01:30:58,159
how the different parts of a humanlike
 

4351
01:30:58,159 --> 01:31:00,590
how the different parts of a humanlike
mind should should work together on the

4352
01:31:00,590 --> 01:31:00,600
mind should should work together on the

01:31:02,709 --> 01:31:02,719
other hand you had these learning theory
 

4355
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:04,910

guys who didn't care at all about the

4356
01:31:04,910 --> 01:31:04,920
guys who didn't care at all about the
 

4357
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:06,790
guys who didn't care at all about the
architecture but were just thinking

4358
01:31:06,790 --> 01:31:06,800
architecture but were just thinking
 

4359
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,430
architecture but were just thinking
about like how how do you recognize

4360
01:31:08,430 --> 01:31:08,440
about like how how do you recognize
 

4361
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:11,149
about like how how do you recognize
patterns and large amounts of data and

4362
01:31:11,149 --> 01:31:11,159
patterns and large amounts of data and
 

4363
01:31:11,159 --> 01:31:14,629
patterns and large amounts of data and
in some sense what you needed to do was

4364
01:31:14,629 --> 01:31:14,639
in some sense what you needed to do was
 

4365
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:17,470
in some sense what you needed to do was
was to get the learning that the

4366
01:31:17,470 --> 01:31:17,480
was to get the learning that the
 

4367
01:31:17,480 --> 01:31:19,470
was to get the learning that the
learning theory guys were doing and put

4368
01:31:19,470 --> 01:31:19,480
learning theory guys were doing and put
 

4369
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:21,430
learning theory guys were doing and put
it together with the architecture that

4370
01:31:21,430 --> 01:31:21,440
it together with the architecture that
 

4371
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:22,990
it together with the architecture that
the cognitive architecture guys were

4372
01:31:22,990 --> 01:31:23,000
the cognitive architecture guys were
 

4373
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,390
the cognitive architecture guys were
doing and then you would have what you

4374
01:31:25,390 --> 01:31:25,400
doing and then you would have what you
 

4375
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:29,310
doing and then you would have what you
needed now you can't unfortunately when

4376
01:31:29,310 --> 01:31:29,320
needed now you can't unfortunately when
 

4377
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:30,510
needed now you can't unfortunately when
you look at the

4378
01:31:30,510 --> 01:31:30,520
you look at the
 

4379
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:33,430
you look at the
details you can't just do that without

4380
01:31:33,430 --> 01:31:33,440
details you can't just do that without
 

4381
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:35,669
details you can't just do that without
totally rebuilding what what is

4382
01:31:35,669 --> 01:31:35,679
totally rebuilding what what is

happening on both the cognitive
 

4385
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:38,950
happening on both the cognitive

01:31:41,870 --> 01:31:41,880
mean they tried to do that in sore but
 

4389
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:44,270
mean they tried to do that in sore but
what they ultimately did is like take a

01:31:44,270 --> 01:31:44,280
what they ultimately did is like take a
 

4391
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:45,950
what they ultimately did is like take a
neural deep neural net or something for

4392
01:31:45,950 --> 01:31:45,960
neural deep neural net or something for
 

4393
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:48,189
neural deep neural net or something for

4397
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:52,310
one of the black boxes it's one it
becomes one of the boxes the learning

stuff Deep Mind has done like the the
 

4407
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,350
stuff Deep Mind has done like the the
differential neural computer or

differential neural computer or
 

4409
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:04,870

something that sort of has a neural net
 

4411
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:07,350
something that sort of has a neural net
for deep learning perception it has

4412
01:32:07,350 --> 01:32:07,360
for deep learning perception it has
 

4413
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:09,709
for deep learning perception it has
another neural net which is like a a

another neural net which is like a a
 

4415
01:32:09,719 --> 01:32:11,669
another neural net which is like a a
memory matrix it's St say the map of the

Demis aabus was thinking about as like
 

4421
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:18,430
Demis aabus was thinking about as like
part of Cortex and part of hippocampus

4422
01:32:18,430 --> 01:32:18,440
part of Cortex and part of hippocampus
 

4423
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:20,350
part of Cortex and part of hippocampus
because hippocampus has a spatial map

4424
01:32:20,350 --> 01:32:20,360
because hippocampus has a spatial map
 

4425
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:21,870
because hippocampus has a spatial map
and when he was a neuroscientist he was

and when he was a neuroscientist he was
 

4427
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:23,430
and when he was a neuroscientist he was
doing a bunch on cortex hippocampus

4428

right and mean you weren't learning the

somewhat in changing maybe uh have you

4538
01:34:27,750 --> 01:34:27,760
somewhat in changing maybe uh have you
 

4539
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:29,790
somewhat in changing maybe uh have you
changed your mind on some aspects of

4540
01:34:29,790 --> 01:34:29,800
changed your mind on some aspects of
 

4541
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:32,310
changed your mind on some aspects of
what it takes to build an AGI like

4542
01:34:32,310 --> 01:34:32,320
what it takes to build an AGI like
 

4543
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:33,669
what it takes to build an AGI like
technical things the hard part is that

4544
01:34:33,669 --> 01:34:33,679
technical things the hard part is that
 

4545
01:34:33,679 --> 01:34:36,390
technical things the hard part is that
the world doesn't want you to the world

4546
01:34:36,390 --> 01:34:36,400
the world doesn't want you to the world
 

4547
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:38,950
the world doesn't want you to the world
or your own brain the world well that

4548
01:34:38,950 --> 01:34:38,960
or your own brain the world well that
 

4549
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:40,990
or your own brain the world well that
one point is your brain doesn't want to

4550
01:34:40,990 --> 01:34:41,000
one point is your brain doesn't want to
 

4551
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,990
one point is your brain doesn't want to
the other part is that the world doesn't

4552
01:34:42,990 --> 01:34:43,000
the other part is that the world doesn't
 

4553
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,070
the other part is that the world doesn't
want you to like like the people who

4554
01:34:45,070 --> 01:34:45,080
want you to like like the people who
 

4555
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:47,070
want you to like like the people who
have followed your ideas get mad at you

4556
01:34:47,070 --> 01:34:47,080
have followed your ideas get mad at you
 

4557
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:50,149
have followed your ideas get mad at you
if if if if you change your mind and and

4558
01:34:50,149 --> 01:34:50,159
if if if if you change your mind and and
 

4559
01:34:50,159 --> 01:34:52,470
if if if if you change your mind and and
you know the media wants to pigeonhole

4560
01:34:52,470 --> 01:34:52,480
you know the media wants to pigeonhole
 

4561
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:56,270

4563
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:59,070
you as as Avatar of of of of a certain a
certain idea but yeah I i' I've changed

4564
01:34:59,070 --> 01:34:59,080
certain idea but yeah I i' I've changed
 

4565
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:02,070
certain idea but yeah I i' I've changed
my mind on on a bunch of things I mean

4566
01:35:02,070 --> 01:35:02,080
my mind on on a bunch of things I mean
 

4567
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:04,149
my mind on on a bunch of things I mean
when I started my career I really

4568
01:35:04,149 --> 01:35:04,159
when I started my career I really
 

4569
01:35:04,159 --> 01:35:05,510
when I started my career I really
thought Quantum Computing would be

4570
01:35:05,510 --> 01:35:05,520
thought Quantum Computing would be
 

4571
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:10,070
thought Quantum Computing would be
necessary for for AGI and I I doubt it's

4572
01:35:10,070 --> 01:35:10,080
necessary for for AGI and I I doubt it's
 

4573
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:11,550
necessary for for AGI and I I doubt it's
necessary now although I think it will

4574
01:35:11,550 --> 01:35:11,560
necessary now although I think it will
 

4575
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:15,510
necessary now although I think it will
be a super major enhancement but I mean

4576
01:35:15,510 --> 01:35:15,520
be a super major enhancement but I mean
 

4577
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:18,830
be a super major enhancement but I mean
I'm also I'm now in the middle of

I'm also I'm now in the middle of
 

4579
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:20,550
I'm also I'm now in the middle of
embarking on a

01:35:20,550 --> 01:35:20,560
embarking on a

in Singularity net so now we're trying

4590
01:35:32,830 --> 01:35:32,840
in Singularity net so now we're trying
 

4591
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:36,550
in Singularity net so now we're trying
to like go back to basics take take

4592
01:35:36,550 --> 01:35:36,560
to like go back to basics take take
 

4593
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:37,870
to like go back to basics take take
everything we learned from working with

4594
01:35:37,870 --> 01:35:37,880
everything we learned from working with
 

4595
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:39,910
everything we learned from working with
the current opencog system take

4596
01:35:39,910 --> 01:35:39,920
the current opencog system take
 

4597
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:41,790
the current opencog system take
everything everybody else has learned

4598
01:35:41,790 --> 01:35:41,800
everything everybody else has learned
 

4599
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:43,830
everything everybody else has learned
from working with with their with their

4600
01:35:43,830 --> 01:35:43,840
from working with with their with their
 

4601
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:46,990
from working with with their with their
their Proto AGI systems and and design

4602
01:35:46,990 --> 01:35:47,000
their Proto AGI systems and and design
 

4603
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,149
their Proto AGI systems and and design
design the best framework for the for

4604
01:35:49,149 --> 01:35:49,159
design the best framework for the for
 

4605
01:35:49,159 --> 01:35:52,390
design the best framework for the for
the next stage and I do think there's a

4606
01:35:52,390 --> 01:35:52,400
the next stage and I do think there's a
 

4607
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:54,550
the next stage and I do think there's a
lot to be learned from the recent

4608
01:35:54,550 --> 01:35:54,560
lot to be learned from the recent
 

4609
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:57,470
lot to be learned from the recent
successes with deep neural Nets and deep

4610
01:35:57,470 --> 01:35:57,480
successes with deep neural Nets and deep
 

4611
01:35:57,480 --> 01:36:00,390
successes with deep neural Nets and deep
reinforcement systems I mean people made

4612
01:36:00,390 --> 01:36:00,400
reinforcement systems I mean people made
 

4613
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:02,990
reinforcement systems I mean people made
these essentially trivial systems work

4614
01:36:02,990 --> 01:36:03,000
these essentially trivial systems work
 

4615
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,870
these essentially trivial systems work
much better than I thought they would

4616
01:36:04,870 --> 01:36:04,880
much better than I thought they would
 

4617
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:06,590
much better than I thought they would
and there's a lot to be learned from

4618
01:36:06,590 --> 01:36:06,600
and there's a lot to be learned from
 

4619
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:09,070
and there's a lot to be learned from
that and I want to incorporate that

4620
01:36:09,070 --> 01:36:09,080
that and I want to incorporate that
 

4621
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:11,430
that and I want to incorporate that
knowledge appropriately in our our

4622
01:36:11,430 --> 01:36:11,440
knowledge appropriately in our our
 

4623
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:14,790
knowledge appropriately in our our
opencog 2.0 system on on on the other

4624
01:36:14,790 --> 01:36:14,800
opencog 2.0 system on on on the other
 

4625
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:18,310
opencog 2.0 system on on on the other
hand I also think current deep neural

4626
01:36:18,310 --> 01:36:18,320
hand I also think current deep neural
 

4627
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:20,189
hand I also think current deep neural
net architectures as such will never get

4628
01:36:20,189 --> 01:36:20,199
net architectures as such will never get
 

4629
01:36:20,199 --> 01:36:23,229
net architectures as such will never get
you any anywhere near AGI so I think you

4630
01:36:23,229 --> 01:36:23,239
you any anywhere near AGI so I think you
 

4631
01:36:23,239 --> 01:36:26,990
you any anywhere near AGI so I think you
you avoid the pathology of throwing the

4632
01:36:26,990 --> 01:36:27,000
you avoid the pathology of throwing the
 

4633
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,669
you avoid the pathology of throwing the
baby out with the bath water and like

4634
01:36:28,669 --> 01:36:28,679
baby out with the bath water and like
 

4635
01:36:28,679 --> 01:36:30,990
baby out with the bath water and like
saying well these things are garbage

4636
01:36:30,990 --> 01:36:31,000
saying well these things are garbage
 

4637
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,510
saying well these things are garbage
because foolish journalists overblow

4638
01:36:33,510 --> 01:36:33,520
because foolish journalists overblow
 

4639
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:37,189
because foolish journalists overblow
them as as as being the path to AGI and

4640
01:36:37,189 --> 01:36:37,199
them as as as being the path to AGI and
 

4641
01:36:37,199 --> 01:36:39,430
them as as as being the path to AGI and
and a few researchers over overblow them

4642
01:36:39,430 --> 01:36:39,440
and a few researchers over overblow them
 

4643
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:42,430
and a few researchers over overblow them
as as well yeah there there's there's a

4644
01:36:42,430 --> 01:36:42,440
as as well yeah there there's there's a
 

4645
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:44,390
as as well yeah there there's there's a
lot of interesting stuff to be learned

4646
01:36:44,390 --> 01:36:44,400
lot of interesting stuff to be learned
 

4647
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:46,950
lot of interesting stuff to be learned
there on even though those are not not

4648
01:36:46,950 --> 01:36:46,960
there on even though those are not not
 

4649
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:49,070
there on even though those are not not
the golden path so maybe this is a good

4650
01:36:49,070 --> 01:36:49,080
the golden path so maybe this is a good
 

4651
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:50,750
the golden path so maybe this is a good
chance to step back you mentioned open

4652
01:36:50,750 --> 01:36:50,760
chance to step back you mentioned open
 

4653
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:55,709
chance to step back you mentioned open
coock 2.0 but go back to open K 0.0

4654
01:36:55,709 --> 01:36:55,719
coock 2.0 but go back to open K 0.0
 

4655
01:36:55,719 --> 01:37:00,070
coock 2.0 but go back to open K 0.0
which exist yeah uh yeah maybe talk to

4656
01:37:00,070 --> 01:37:00,080
which exist yeah uh yeah maybe talk to
 

4657
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:02,070
which exist yeah uh yeah maybe talk to
the history of open absolutely and

4658
01:37:02,070 --> 01:37:02,080
the history of open absolutely and
 

4659
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:04,070
the history of open absolutely and
you're thinking about these ideas I

4660
01:37:04,070 --> 01:37:04,080
you're thinking about these ideas I
 

4661
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:05,070
you're thinking about these ideas I
would

4662
01:37:05,070 --> 01:37:05,080
would
 

4663
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:09,229
would
say opencog 2.0 is a term we're throwing

4664
01:37:09,229 --> 01:37:09,239
say opencog 2.0 is a term we're throwing
 

4665
01:37:09,239 --> 01:37:11,950
say opencog 2.0 is a term we're throwing
around sort of tongue and cheek because

4666
01:37:11,950 --> 01:37:11,960
around sort of tongue and cheek because
 

4667
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:14,750
around sort of tongue and cheek because
the existing opencog system that we're

4668
01:37:14,750 --> 01:37:14,760
the existing opencog system that we're
 

4669
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:17,229
the existing opencog system that we're
working on now is not remotely close to

4670
01:37:17,229 --> 01:37:17,239
working on now is not remotely close to
 

4671
01:37:17,239 --> 01:37:19,030
working on now is not remotely close to
what we consider we'd consider a one a

4672
01:37:19,030 --> 01:37:19,040
what we consider we'd consider a one a
 

4673
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:22,350
what we consider we'd consider a one a
1.0 right I mean I mean it's it it's an

4674
01:37:22,350 --> 01:37:22,360
1.0 right I mean I mean it's it it's an
 

4675
01:37:22,360 --> 01:37:24,669
1.0 right I mean I mean it's it it's an
early it's it's been

4676
01:37:24,669 --> 01:37:24,679
early it's it's been
 

4677
01:37:24,679 --> 01:37:27,470
early it's it's been
around what 13 years or something but

4678
01:37:27,470 --> 01:37:27,480
around what 13 years or something but
 

4679
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:28,990
around what 13 years or something but
it's still an early stage research

4680
01:37:28,990 --> 01:37:29,000
it's still an early stage research
 

4681
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:33,189
it's still an early stage research
system right and actually we're we

4682
01:37:33,189 --> 01:37:33,199
system right and actually we're we
 

4683
01:37:33,199 --> 01:37:35,590
system right and actually we're we
are going back

4684
01:37:35,590 --> 01:37:35,600
are going back
 

4685
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:39,830
are going back
to the beginning in terms of theory and

4686
01:37:39,830 --> 01:37:39,840
to the beginning in terms of theory and
 

4687
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,270
to the beginning in terms of theory and
implementation because we feel like

4688
01:37:41,270 --> 01:37:41,280
implementation because we feel like
 

4689
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:43,070
implementation because we feel like
that's the right thing to do but I'm

4690
01:37:43,070 --> 01:37:43,080
that's the right thing to do but I'm
 

4691
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:44,669
that's the right thing to do but I'm
sure what we end up with is going to

4692
01:37:44,669 --> 01:37:44,679
sure what we end up with is going to
 

4693
01:37:44,679 --> 01:37:47,189
sure what we end up with is going to
have a huge amount in common with with

4694
01:37:47,189 --> 01:37:47,199
have a huge amount in common with with
 

4695
01:37:47,199 --> 01:37:48,830
have a huge amount in common with with
with with the current system I mean we

4696
01:37:48,830 --> 01:37:48,840
with with the current system I mean we
 

4697
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:51,189
with with the current system I mean we
all still like that the general approach

4698
01:37:51,189 --> 01:37:51,199
all still like that the general approach
 

4699
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:54,390
all still like that the general approach
so that so first of all what is open Cog

4700
01:37:54,390 --> 01:37:54,400
so that so first of all what is open Cog
 

4701
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:56,070
so that so first of all what is open Cog
sure open

4702
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:56,080
sure open
 

4703
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:59,950
sure open
Cog is an open-source software project

4704
01:37:59,950 --> 01:37:59,960
Cog is an open-source software project
 

4705
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:02,430
Cog is an open-source software project
that I launched together with several

4706
01:38:02,430 --> 01:38:02,440
that I launched together with several
 

4707
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:07,189
that I launched together with several
others in 2008 and probably the first

4708
01:38:07,189 --> 01:38:07,199
others in 2008 and probably the first
 

4709
01:38:07,199 --> 01:38:09,390
others in 2008 and probably the first
code written to that was written in 2001

4710
01:38:09,390 --> 01:38:09,400
code written to that was written in 2001
 

4711
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:12,629
code written to that was written in 2001
or two or something that was

4712
01:38:12,629 --> 01:38:12,639
or two or something that was
 

4713
01:38:12,639 --> 01:38:15,270
or two or something that was
developed uh as a proprietary co-base

4714
01:38:15,270 --> 01:38:15,280
developed uh as a proprietary co-base
 

4715
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:18,550
developed uh as a proprietary co-base
within my AI company nov LLC then we

4716
01:38:18,550 --> 01:38:18,560
within my AI company nov LLC then we
 

4717
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:21,870
within my AI company nov LLC then we
decided to open source it in two in 2008

4718
01:38:21,870 --> 01:38:21,880
decided to open source it in two in 2008
 

4719
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:23,550
decided to open source it in two in 2008
cleaned up the code throughout some

4720
01:38:23,550 --> 01:38:23,560
cleaned up the code throughout some
 

4721
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:26,950
cleaned up the code throughout some
things add added some new things and

4722
01:38:26,950 --> 01:38:26,960
things add added some new things and
 

4723
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:29,430
things add added some new things and
what language is it written in it's C++

4724
01:38:29,430 --> 01:38:29,440
what language is it written in it's C++
 

4725
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:31,149
what language is it written in it's C++
primarily there's a bunch of scheme as

4726
01:38:31,149 --> 01:38:31,159
primarily there's a bunch of scheme as
 

4727
01:38:31,159 --> 01:38:33,589
primarily there's a bunch of scheme as
well but most of it C++ and it's

4728
01:38:33,589 --> 01:38:33,599
well but most of it C++ and it's
 

4729
01:38:33,599 --> 01:38:36,030
well but most of it C++ and it's
separate from that something we'll also

4730
01:38:36,030 --> 01:38:36,040
separate from that something we'll also
 

4731
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:38,270
separate from that something we'll also
talk about is singularity net so it was

4732
01:38:38,270 --> 01:38:38,280
talk about is singularity net so it was
 

4733
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:41,430
talk about is singularity net so it was
it was born as a non networked thing

4734
01:38:41,430 --> 01:38:41,440
it was born as a non networked thing
 

4735
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:44,030
it was born as a non networked thing
correct correct well there are many

4736
01:38:44,030 --> 01:38:44,040
correct correct well there are many
 

4737
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:46,910
correct correct well there are many
levels of networks in inv involved here

4738
01:38:46,910 --> 01:38:46,920
levels of networks in inv involved here
 

4739
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:49,550
levels of networks in inv involved here
right no connectivity to the internet or

4740
01:38:49,550 --> 01:38:49,560
right no connectivity to the internet or
 

4741
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:54,629
right no connectivity to the internet or
no at at Birth yeah I mean Singularity

4742
01:38:54,629 --> 01:38:54,639
no at at Birth yeah I mean Singularity
 

4743
01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:57,910
no at at Birth yeah I mean Singularity
net is a separate project and a separate

4744
01:38:57,910 --> 01:38:57,920
net is a separate project and a separate
 

4745
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:00,910
net is a separate project and a separate
body of code and you can use Singularity

4746
01:39:00,910 --> 01:39:00,920
body of code and you can use Singularity
 

4747
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:02,870
body of code and you can use Singularity
net as part of the infrastructure for a

4748
01:39:02,870 --> 01:39:02,880
net as part of the infrastructure for a
 

4749
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:06,270
net as part of the infrastructure for a
distributed opencog system but they are

4750
01:39:06,270 --> 01:39:06,280
distributed opencog system but they are
 

4751
01:39:06,280 --> 01:39:08,390
distributed opencog system but they are
there are different layers yeah got it

4752
01:39:08,390 --> 01:39:08,400
there are different layers yeah got it
 

4753
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:10,709
there are different layers yeah got it
so

4754
01:39:10,709 --> 01:39:10,719
so
 

4755
01:39:10,719 --> 01:39:13,830
so
opencog on the one hand as a software

4756
01:39:13,830 --> 01:39:13,840
opencog on the one hand as a software
 

4757
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:16,430
opencog on the one hand as a software
framework could be used to implement a

4758
01:39:16,430 --> 01:39:16,440
framework could be used to implement a
 

4759
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:19,830
framework could be used to implement a
variety of different Ai architectures

4760
01:39:19,830 --> 01:39:19,840
variety of different Ai architectures
 

4761
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:24,390
variety of different Ai architectures
and and and algorithms but in practice

4762
01:39:24,390 --> 01:39:24,400
and and and algorithms but in practice
 

4763
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:26,709
and and and algorithms but in practice
there's been a group of developers which

4764
01:39:26,709 --> 01:39:26,719
there's been a group of developers which
 

4765
01:39:26,719 --> 01:39:28,709
there's been a group of developers which
I've been leading together with lenus

4766
01:39:28,709 --> 01:39:28,719
I've been leading together with lenus
 

4767
01:39:28,719 --> 01:39:31,910
I've been leading together with lenus
vus nil giler and a few others which

4768
01:39:31,910 --> 01:39:31,920
vus nil giler and a few others which
 

4769
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:35,510
vus nil giler and a few others which
have been using the opencog platform and

4770
01:39:35,510 --> 01:39:35,520
have been using the opencog platform and
 

4771
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:38,950
have been using the opencog platform and
infrastructure to to implement certain

4772
01:39:38,950 --> 01:39:38,960
infrastructure to to implement certain
 

4773
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:41,470
infrastructure to to implement certain
ideas about how to make an an AGI so

4774
01:39:41,470 --> 01:39:41,480
ideas about how to make an an AGI so
 

4775
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:42,830
ideas about how to make an an AGI so
there there's been a little bit of

4776
01:39:42,830 --> 01:39:42,840
there there's been a little bit of
 

4777
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:45,109
there there's been a little bit of
ambiguity about opencog the software

4778
01:39:45,109 --> 01:39:45,119
ambiguity about opencog the software
 

4779
01:39:45,119 --> 01:39:48,390
ambiguity about opencog the software
platform versus opencog the the the AGI

4780
01:39:48,390 --> 01:39:48,400
platform versus opencog the the the AGI
 

4781
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:50,390
platform versus opencog the the the AGI
design because in theory you could use

4782
01:39:50,390 --> 01:39:50,400
design because in theory you could use
 

4783
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,629
design because in theory you could use
that software to do you could use it to

4784
01:39:52,629 --> 01:39:52,639
that software to do you could use it to
 

4785
01:39:52,639 --> 01:39:54,030
that software to do you could use it to
make a neural net you could you could

4786
01:39:54,030 --> 01:39:54,040
make a neural net you could you could
 

4787
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:56,070
make a neural net you could you could
use it to make a lot of different what

4788
01:39:56,070 --> 01:39:56,080
use it to make a lot of different what
 

4789
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:57,950
use it to make a lot of different what
kind of stuff does the software platform

4790
01:39:57,950 --> 01:39:57,960
kind of stuff does the software platform
 

4791
01:39:57,960 --> 01:40:00,070
kind of stuff does the software platform
provide like in terms of utilities tools

4792
01:40:00,070 --> 01:40:00,080
provide like in terms of utilities tools
 

4793
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:01,629
provide like in terms of utilities tools
like what what yeah let me first tell

4794
01:40:01,629 --> 01:40:01,639
like what what yeah let me first tell
 

4795
01:40:01,639 --> 01:40:02,790
like what what yeah let me first tell
about

4796
01:40:02,790 --> 01:40:02,800
about
 

4797
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:05,709
about
opencog as a software platform and then

4798
01:40:05,709 --> 01:40:05,719
opencog as a software platform and then
 

4799
01:40:05,719 --> 01:40:08,790
opencog as a software platform and then
I'll tell you the specific AGI R&D we've

4800
01:40:08,790 --> 01:40:08,800
I'll tell you the specific AGI R&D we've
 

4801
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:12,189
I'll tell you the specific AGI R&D we've
been building building on top of it yep

4802
01:40:12,189 --> 01:40:12,199
been building building on top of it yep
 

4803
01:40:12,199 --> 01:40:14,310
been building building on top of it yep
so the core component of opencog as a

4804
01:40:14,310 --> 01:40:14,320
so the core component of opencog as a
 

4805
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:16,790
so the core component of opencog as a
software platform is what we call the

4806
01:40:16,790 --> 01:40:16,800
software platform is what we call the
 

4807
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:17,790
software platform is what we call the
adom

4808
01:40:17,790 --> 01:40:17,800
adom
 

4809
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:20,229
adom
space which is a weighted labeled

4810
01:40:20,229 --> 01:40:20,239
space which is a weighted labeled
 

4811
01:40:20,239 --> 01:40:23,709
space which is a weighted labeled
hypergraph atom atom space atom space

4812
01:40:23,709 --> 01:40:23,719
hypergraph atom atom space atom space
 

4813
01:40:23,719 --> 01:40:25,870
hypergraph atom atom space atom space
yeah yeah not not Adam like Adam and Eve

4814
01:40:25,870 --> 01:40:25,880
yeah yeah not not Adam like Adam and Eve
 

4815
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:28,950
yeah yeah not not Adam like Adam and Eve
although that would be cool too yeah so

4816
01:40:28,950 --> 01:40:28,960
although that would be cool too yeah so
 

4817
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:32,109
although that would be cool too yeah so
you have a hyper graph which is like a

4818
01:40:32,109 --> 01:40:32,119
you have a hyper graph which is like a
 

4819
01:40:32,119 --> 01:40:34,950
you have a hyper graph which is like a
so a graph in this sense is a bunch of

4820
01:40:34,950 --> 01:40:34,960
so a graph in this sense is a bunch of
 

4821
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:37,870
so a graph in this sense is a bunch of
nodes with links between them a hyper

4822
01:40:37,870 --> 01:40:37,880
nodes with links between them a hyper
 

4823
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:41,870
nodes with links between them a hyper
graph is like a graph but links can go

4824
01:40:41,870 --> 01:40:41,880
graph is like a graph but links can go
 

4825
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:44,149
graph is like a graph but links can go
between more than two nodes so you have

4826
01:40:44,149 --> 01:40:44,159
between more than two nodes so you have
 

4827
01:40:44,159 --> 01:40:47,470
between more than two nodes so you have
a link between three nodes and in fact

4828
01:40:47,470 --> 01:40:47,480
a link between three nodes and in fact
 

4829
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:49,830
a link between three nodes and in fact
in fact open cogs Adam space would

4830
01:40:49,830 --> 01:40:49,840
in fact open cogs Adam space would
 

4831
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:51,910
in fact open cogs Adam space would
properly be called a metagraph because

4832
01:40:51,910 --> 01:40:51,920
properly be called a metagraph because
 

4833
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:53,990
properly be called a metagraph because
you can have links pointing to link LS

4834
01:40:53,990 --> 01:40:54,000
you can have links pointing to link LS
 

4835
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,109
you can have links pointing to link LS
or you could have links playing the

4836
01:40:55,109 --> 01:40:55,119
or you could have links playing the
 

4837
01:40:55,119 --> 01:40:58,189
or you could have links playing the
whole subgraphs right so it's a it's an

4838
01:40:58,189 --> 01:40:58,199
whole subgraphs right so it's a it's an
 

4839
01:40:58,199 --> 01:41:00,470
whole subgraphs right so it's a it's an
extended hyper graph or or a metagraph

4840
01:41:00,470 --> 01:41:00,480
extended hyper graph or or a metagraph
 

4841
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:02,550
extended hyper graph or or a metagraph
and is metagraph a technical term it is

4842
01:41:02,550 --> 01:41:02,560
and is metagraph a technical term it is
 

4843
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:04,629
and is metagraph a technical term it is
now a technical term interesting but I

4844
01:41:04,629 --> 01:41:04,639
now a technical term interesting but I
 

4845
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:06,350
now a technical term interesting but I
don't think it was yet a technical term

4846
01:41:06,350 --> 01:41:06,360
don't think it was yet a technical term
 

4847
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:08,070
don't think it was yet a technical term
when we started calling this a

01:41:11,239 --> 01:41:14,070
generalized hypergraph in but in in any
case it's a weighted labeled generalized

01:41:14,070 --> 01:41:14,080
case it's a weighted labeled generalized
 

4853
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:16,470
case it's a weighted labeled generalized

hypergraph or weighted labeled metagraph
 

4855
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:18,390
hypergraph or weighted labeled metagraph
the the weights and labels mean that the

4856
01:41:18,390 --> 01:41:18,400
the the weights and labels mean that the
 

4857
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:21,229
the the weights and labels mean that the
nodes and links can have numbers and and

4858
01:41:21,229 --> 01:41:21,239
nodes and links can have numbers and and
 

4859
01:41:21,239 --> 01:41:22,709
nodes and links can have numbers and and
symbols attached to them so they can

4860
01:41:22,709 --> 01:41:22,719
symbols attached to them so they can
 

4861
01:41:22,719 --> 01:41:25,990
symbols attached to them so they can
have Types on them they can have numbers

4862
01:41:25,990 --> 01:41:26,000
have Types on them they can have numbers
 

4863
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,669
have Types on them they can have numbers
on them that represent say a truth value

4864
01:41:28,669 --> 01:41:28,679
on them that represent say a truth value
 

4865
01:41:28,679 --> 01:41:31,390
on them that represent say a truth value
or an importance value for for a certain

4866
01:41:31,390 --> 01:41:31,400
or an importance value for for a certain
 

4867
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:32,990
or an importance value for for a certain
purpose and of course like with all

4868
01:41:32,990 --> 01:41:33,000
purpose and of course like with all
 

4869
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,430
purpose and of course like with all
things you can reduce that to a

4870
01:41:34,430 --> 01:41:34,440
things you can reduce that to a
 

4871
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:35,830
things you can reduce that to a
hypergraph and then the hypergraph can

4872
01:41:35,830 --> 01:41:35,840
hypergraph and then the hypergraph can
 

4873
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:37,870
hypergraph and then the hypergraph can
be reduce hypergraph to a graph and you

4874
01:41:37,870 --> 01:41:37,880
be reduce hypergraph to a graph and you
 

4875
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:39,350
be reduce hypergraph to a graph and you
could reduce a graph to an adjacency

4876
01:41:39,350 --> 01:41:39,360
could reduce a graph to an adjacency
 

4877
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:41,990
could reduce a graph to an adjacency
Matrix so I mean there's always multiple

4878
01:41:41,990 --> 01:41:42,000
Matrix so I mean there's always multiple
 

4879
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,390
Matrix so I mean there's always multiple
representations but there's a layer of

4880
01:41:43,390 --> 01:41:43,400
representations but there's a layer of
 

4881
01:41:43,400 --> 01:41:44,870
representations but there's a layer of
representation that seems to work well

4882
01:41:44,870 --> 01:41:44,880
representation that seems to work well
 

4883
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:47,990
representation that seems to work well
here got it right right right and so

4884
01:41:47,990 --> 01:41:48,000
here got it right right right and so
 

4885
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:51,030
here got it right right right and so
similarly you could have a link to a

4886
01:41:51,030 --> 01:41:51,040
similarly you could have a link to a
 

4887
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:52,950
similarly you could have a link to a
whole graph because a whole graph could

4888
01:41:52,950 --> 01:41:52,960
whole graph because a whole graph could
 

4889
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:55,030
whole graph because a whole graph could
repres present say a body of information

4890
01:41:55,030 --> 01:41:55,040
repres present say a body of information
 

4891
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:57,589
repres present say a body of information
and I could say I reject this body of

4892
01:41:57,589 --> 01:41:57,599
and I could say I reject this body of
 

4893
01:41:57,599 --> 01:41:59,709
and I could say I reject this body of
information then one way to do that is

4894
01:41:59,709 --> 01:41:59,719
information then one way to do that is
 

4895
01:41:59,719 --> 01:42:01,550
information then one way to do that is
make that link go to that whole subgraph

4896
01:42:01,550 --> 01:42:01,560
make that link go to that whole subgraph
 

4897
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:03,350
make that link go to that whole subgraph
representing the body of information

4898
01:42:03,350 --> 01:42:03,360
representing the body of information
 

4899
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:05,470
representing the body of information
right I mean there's many there are many

4900
01:42:05,470 --> 01:42:05,480
right I mean there's many there are many
 

4901
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:08,669
right I mean there's many there are many
alternate representations but that's

4902
01:42:08,669 --> 01:42:08,679
alternate representations but that's
 

4903
01:42:08,679 --> 01:42:10,910
alternate representations but that's
anyway what we have an opencog we have

4904
01:42:10,910 --> 01:42:10,920
anyway what we have an opencog we have
 

4905
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:12,629
anyway what we have an opencog we have
an atom space which is this weighted

01:42:18,510 --> 01:42:18,520
store it lives in Ram there's also a way
 

4911
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:20,310
store it lives in Ram there's also a way
to back back it up to disk there are

4912
01:42:20,310 --> 01:42:20,320
to back back it up to disk there are
 

4913
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:22,669
to back back it up to disk there are
ways to spread it among among multiple

4914
01:42:22,669 --> 01:42:22,679
ways to spread it among among multiple
 

4915

ways to spread it among among multiple
different Mach Maes then there are

4916
01:42:25,070 --> 01:42:25,080
different Mach Maes then there are
 

4917
01:42:25,080 --> 01:42:27,870
different Mach Maes then there are
various utilities for dealing with that

4918
01:42:27,870 --> 01:42:27,880
various utilities for dealing with that
 

4919
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:30,149
various utilities for dealing with that
so there's a pattern matcher which lets

4920
01:42:30,149 --> 01:42:30,159
so there's a pattern matcher which lets
 

4921
01:42:30,159 --> 01:42:33,830
so there's a pattern matcher which lets
you specify a sort of abstract pattern

4922
01:42:33,830 --> 01:42:33,840
you specify a sort of abstract pattern
 

4923
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:35,669
you specify a sort of abstract pattern
and then search through a whole atom

4924
01:42:35,669 --> 01:42:35,679
and then search through a whole atom
 

4925
01:42:35,679 --> 01:42:38,790
and then search through a whole atom

sub hypergraphs May match that that

4928
01:42:40,910 --> 01:42:40,920
sub hypergraphs May match that that
 

4929
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:44,310
sub hypergraphs May match that that
pattern for an example so that's then

4930
01:42:44,310 --> 01:42:44,320
pattern for an example so that's then
 

4931
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:46,629
pattern for an example so that's then
there's there's something called the the

4932
01:42:46,629 --> 01:42:46,639
there's there's something called the the
 

4933
01:42:46,639 --> 01:42:50,149
there's there's something called the the
Cog server in opencog which lets you run

01:42:50,149 --> 01:42:50,159
Cog server in opencog which lets you run
 

4935
01:42:50,159 --> 01:42:53,629

a bunch of different agents or processes

4936
01:42:53,629 --> 01:42:53,639
a bunch of different agents or processes
 

4937
01:42:53,639 --> 01:42:57,669
a bunch of different agents or processes
these in auler and each of these agents

4938
01:42:57,669 --> 01:42:57,679
these in auler and each of these agents
 

4939
01:42:57,679 --> 01:42:59,669
these in auler and each of these agents
basically it reads stuff from the adom

4940
01:42:59,669 --> 01:42:59,679
basically it reads stuff from the adom
 

4941
01:42:59,679 --> 01:43:01,270
basically it reads stuff from the adom
space and it writes stuff to the adom

4942
01:43:01,270 --> 01:43:01,280
space and it writes stuff to the adom
 

4943
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:04,350
space and it writes stuff to the adom
space so th this is sort of the basic

4944
01:43:04,350 --> 01:43:04,360
space so th this is sort of the basic
 

4945
01:43:04,360 --> 01:43:06,189

work well that's yeah but there's a big

4970
01:43:31,149 --> 01:43:31,159
work well that's yeah but there's a big
 

4971
01:43:31,159 --> 01:43:34,510
work well that's yeah but there's a big
community of people who are uh you know

01:43:34,510 --> 01:43:34,520
community of people who are uh you know

would love integration and like like you

4974
01:43:36,550 --> 01:43:36,560
would love integration and like like you
 

4975
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:38,430
would love integration and like like you
said the young minds love the idea of

4976
01:43:38,430 --> 01:43:38,440
said the young minds love the idea of
 

4977
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:40,669
said the young minds love the idea of
integrating of connecting yeah that's

4978
01:43:40,669 --> 01:43:40,679
integrating of connecting yeah that's
 

4979
01:43:40,679 --> 01:43:42,870
integrating of connecting yeah that's
right and I would add on that note the

4980
01:43:42,870 --> 01:43:42,880
right and I would add on that note the
 

4981
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:45,550
right and I would add on that note the
idea of using hypergraph type models in

4982
01:43:45,550 --> 01:43:45,560
idea of using hypergraph type models in
 

4983
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:48,470
idea of using hypergraph type models in
physics is not very new like if if you

that's a good way to put it the whole
 

5009
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:20,229
that's a good way to put it the whole
opencog framework you could use it to

5010
01:44:20,229 --> 01:44:20,239
opencog framework you could use it to
 

5011
01:44:20,239 --> 01:44:22,589
opencog framework you could use it to
model biological networks and and

you could use it you could use it to do
 

5021
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:35,310
you could use it you could use it to do
say biologically

5022
01:44:35,310 --> 01:44:35,320

5026
01:44:41,589 --> 01:44:41,599
for example and that's so that that's a
 

5027
01:44:41,599 --> 01:44:43,990
for example and that's so that that's a

01:44:45,990 --> 01:44:46,000
do do they grow the graph do they what

5035
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:51,229

01:44:51,229 --> 01:44:51,239
could do anything they want to do
 

5037
01:44:51,239 --> 01:44:53,589
could do anything they want to do
they're just C++ processes on on the

5038
01:44:53,589 --> 01:44:53,599
they're just C++ processes on on the
 

5039
01:44:53,599 --> 01:44:56,990
they're just C++ processes on on the
other hand the computation framework is

01:44:56,990 --> 01:44:57,000
other hand the computation framework is
 

5041
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,950
other hand the computation framework is
sort of designed for agents where most

5042
01:44:59,950 --> 01:44:59,960
sort of designed for agents where most
 

5043
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:02,750
sort of designed for agents where most
of their processing time is taken up

5044
01:45:02,750 --> 01:45:02,760
of their processing time is taken up
 

5045
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:05,430
of their processing time is taken up
with reads and writs to the atom space

01:45:05,430 --> 01:45:05,440
with reads and writs to the atom space
 

5047
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:07,589
with reads and writs to the atom space
and so that's that's a very different

5048
01:45:07,589 --> 01:45:07,599
and so that's that's a very different
 

5049
01:45:07,599 --> 01:45:10,990
and so that's that's a very different
processing model then say the matrix

right so so you could I mean you could

5056
01:45:18,470 --> 01:45:18,480
right so so you could I mean you could
 

5057
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:21,430
right so so you could I mean you could

01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:27,189
within the opencog platform but it would
be pointless right the I mean the point

5064
01:45:27,189 --> 01:45:27,199
be pointless right the I mean the point
 

5065
01:45:27,199 --> 01:45:29,709
be pointless right the I mean the point
of doing opencog is because you want to

I'm not I'm I'm not I'm not sure we need

5300
01:50:09,030 --> 01:50:09,040
I'm not I'm I'm not I'm not sure we need
 

5301
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:11,830
I'm not I'm I'm not I'm not sure we need
that to get get to human human level

5302
01:50:11,830 --> 01:50:11,840
that to get get to human human level
 

5303
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:13,830
that to get get to human human level
human level that's already beyond the

5304
01:50:13,830 --> 01:50:13,840
human level that's already beyond the
 

5305
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:15,870
human level that's already beyond the
the first singular but uh can we just

5306
01:50:15,870 --> 01:50:15,880
the first singular but uh can we just
 

5307
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:17,950
the first singular but uh can we just
yeah let's go back to opencog no yeah

5308
01:50:17,950 --> 01:50:17,960
yeah let's go back to opencog no yeah
 

5309
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:20,229
yeah let's go back to opencog no yeah
and the hypergraph and open yeah that's

5310
01:50:20,229 --> 01:50:20,239
and the hypergraph and open yeah that's
 

5311
01:50:20,239 --> 01:50:22,070
and the hypergraph and open yeah that's
the software framework right so the the

5312
01:50:22,070 --> 01:50:22,080
the software framework right so the the
 

5313
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:24,430
the software framework right so the the
next thing is is our cognitive

5314
01:50:24,430 --> 01:50:24,440
next thing is is our cognitive
 

5315
01:50:24,440 --> 01:50:26,709
next thing is is our cognitive
architecture tells us particular

5316
01:50:26,709 --> 01:50:26,719
architecture tells us particular
 

5317
01:50:26,719 --> 01:50:28,950

algorithms to put there got it can we

5318
01:50:28,950 --> 01:50:28,960
algorithms to put there got it can we
 

5319
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:32,589

Backtrack on the kind of do is this

5320
01:50:32,589 --> 01:50:32,599
Backtrack on the kind of do is this
 

5321
01:50:32,599 --> 01:50:36,270
Backtrack on the kind of do is this
graph designed is it uh in general

5322
01:50:36,270 --> 01:50:36,280
graph designed is it uh in general
 

5323
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:38,870
graph designed is it uh in general
supposed to be sparse and the operations

5324
01:50:38,870 --> 01:50:38,880
supposed to be sparse and the operations
 

5325
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:40,550
supposed to be sparse and the operations
constantly grow and change the graph

5326
01:50:40,550 --> 01:50:40,560
constantly grow and change the graph
 

5327
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:42,910
constantly grow and change the graph
yeah the graph is sparse and but is it

5328
01:50:42,910 --> 01:50:42,920
yeah the graph is sparse and but is it
 

5329
01:50:42,920 --> 01:50:45,149
yeah the graph is sparse and but is it
constantly adding links and so on it is

5330
01:50:45,149 --> 01:50:45,159
constantly adding links and so on it is
 

5331
01:50:45,159 --> 01:50:48,109
constantly adding links and so on it is
a self modifying hypergraph so it's not

5332
01:50:48,109 --> 01:50:48,119
a self modifying hypergraph so it's not
 

5333
01:50:48,119 --> 01:50:49,990
a self modifying hypergraph so it's not
so the write and read operations you're

5334
01:50:49,990 --> 01:50:50,000
so the write and read operations you're
 

5335
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,669
so the write and read operations you're
referring to this isn't just a fixed

5336
01:50:52,669 --> 01:50:52,679
referring to this isn't just a fixed
 

5337
01:50:52,679 --> 01:50:54,830
referring to this isn't just a fixed
graph to which you change way it's

5338
01:50:54,830 --> 01:50:54,840
graph to which you change way it's
 

5339
01:50:54,840 --> 01:50:56,589
graph to which you change way it's
constant growing graph yeah that yeah

5340
01:50:56,589 --> 01:50:56,599
constant growing graph yeah that yeah
 

5341
01:50:56,599 --> 01:50:59,709
constant growing graph yeah that yeah
that that that's that's true so it's it

5342
01:50:59,709 --> 01:50:59,719
that that that's that's true so it's it
 

5343
01:50:59,719 --> 01:51:03,990
that that that's that's true so it's it
is different model then say current deep

5344
01:51:03,990 --> 01:51:04,000
is different model then say current deep
 

5345
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:05,870
is different model then say current deep

architectures that grow new new nodes
 

5355
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:15,030
architectures that grow new new nodes
and links but the most common neural

5356
01:51:15,030 --> 01:51:15,040
and links but the most common neural
 

5357
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:17,430

architectures now have a fixed neural

5358
01:51:17,430 --> 01:51:17,440
architectures now have a fixed neural
 

5359
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:19,030

architecture you're updating the weights

5360
01:51:19,030 --> 01:51:19,040
architecture you're updating the weights
 

5361
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:22,109
architecture you're updating the weights
and in open Cog you can update the

5362
01:51:22,109 --> 01:51:22,119
and in open Cog you can update the
 

5363
01:51:22,119 --> 01:51:24,709
and in open Cog you can update the
weights and that certainly happens a lot

5364
01:51:24,709 --> 01:51:24,719

but adding new

5366
01:51:25,990 --> 01:51:26,000
but adding new
 

5367
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,589
but adding new
nodes adding new links REM removing

5368
01:51:28,589 --> 01:51:28,599
nodes adding new links REM removing
 

5369
01:51:28,599 --> 01:51:30,350

01:51:33,270 --> 01:51:33,280
part of the Systems Operations got it so
 

5373
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:35,229
part of the Systems Operations got it so
now when you start to add these

5374
01:51:35,229 --> 01:51:35,239
now when you start to add these
 

5375
01:51:35,239 --> 01:51:38,149
now when you start to add these
cognitive algorithms on top of this

5376
01:51:38,149 --> 01:51:38,159
cognitive algorithms on top of this
 

5377
01:51:38,159 --> 01:51:40,470
cognitive algorithms on top of this
opencog architecture what does that look

5378
01:51:40,470 --> 01:51:40,480
opencog architecture what does that look
 

5379
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:42,750
opencog architecture what does that look
like so what yeah so that the within

5380
01:51:42,750 --> 01:51:42,760
like so what yeah so that the within
 

5381
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:45,629

01:51:45,629 --> 01:51:45,639
this framework then creating a cognitive
 

5383
01:51:45,639 --> 01:51:47,990
this framework then creating a cognitive
architecture is basically two things

5384
01:51:47,990 --> 01:51:48,000
architecture is basically two things
 

5385
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:51,550
architecture is basically two things
it's it's choosing what type system you

5386
01:51:51,550 --> 01:51:51,560
it's it's choosing what type system you
 

5387
01:51:51,560 --> 01:51:53,189
it's it's choosing what type system you
want to put on the nod and links in the

5388
01:51:53,189 --> 01:51:53,199
want to put on the nod and links in the
 

5389
01:51:53,199 --> 01:51:54,990
want to put on the nod and links in the
hypergraph what types of nodes and links

5390
01:51:54,990 --> 01:51:55,000
hypergraph what types of nodes and links
 

5391
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:58,390
hypergraph what types of nodes and links
you want M and then then it's choosing

5392
01:51:58,390 --> 01:51:58,400
you want M and then then it's choosing
 

5393
01:51:58,400 --> 01:52:01,189
you want M and then then it's choosing
what collection of Agents what

5394
01:52:01,189 --> 01:52:01,199
what collection of Agents what
 

5395
01:52:01,199 --> 01:52:04,510
what collection of Agents what
collection of AI algorithms or processes

5396
01:52:04,510 --> 01:52:04,520
collection of AI algorithms or processes
 

5397
01:52:04,520 --> 01:52:06,870

are going to run to to operate on on on

5398
01:52:06,870 --> 01:52:06,880
are going to run to to operate on on on
 

5399
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:09,030
are going to run to to operate on on on
on this hypergraph and of course those

5400
01:52:09,030 --> 01:52:09,040
on this hypergraph and of course those
 

5401
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:12,510
on this hypergraph and of course those
two decisions are are closely closely

5402
01:52:12,510 --> 01:52:12,520
two decisions are are closely closely
 

5403
01:52:12,520 --> 01:52:15,510
two decisions are are closely closely
connected to each other so in terms of

5404
01:52:15,510 --> 01:52:15,520
connected to each other so in terms of
 

5405
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:18,550
connected to each other so in terms of
the type system there are some links

5406
01:52:18,550 --> 01:52:18,560
the type system there are some links
 

5407
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:20,350
the type system there are some links
that are more neuronet like they just

5408
01:52:20,350 --> 01:52:20,360
that are more neuronet like they just
 

5409
01:52:20,360 --> 01:52:22,510
that are more neuronet like they just
like have weights to get updated by

5410
01:52:22,510 --> 01:52:22,520
like have weights to get updated by
 

5411
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:25,030
like have weights to get updated by
heavan learning and activation spreads

5412
01:52:25,030 --> 01:52:25,040
heavan learning and activation spreads
 

5413
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:26,990
heavan learning and activation spreads
along them there are other links that

5414
01:52:26,990 --> 01:52:27,000
along them there are other links that
 

5415
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,790
along them there are other links that
are more logic like and nodes that are

5416
01:52:29,790 --> 01:52:29,800
are more logic like and nodes that are
 

5417
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:30,990
are more logic like and nodes that are
more logic like so you could have a

5418
01:52:30,990 --> 01:52:31,000
more logic like so you could have a
 

5419
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,189
more logic like so you could have a
variable node and you can have a node

5420
01:52:33,189 --> 01:52:33,199
variable node and you can have a node
 

5421
01:52:33,199 --> 01:52:35,350
variable node and you can have a node
representing a universal or existential

5422
01:52:35,350 --> 01:52:35,360
representing a universal or existential
 

5423
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:37,790
representing a universal or existential
quantifier as in in predicate logic or

5424
01:52:37,790 --> 01:52:37,800
quantifier as in in predicate logic or
 

5425
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:40,750
quantifier as in in predicate logic or
or term logic so you can have logic like

5426
01:52:40,750 --> 01:52:40,760
or term logic so you can have logic like
 

5427
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:43,229
or term logic so you can have logic like
nodes and links or you can have neural

5428
01:52:43,229 --> 01:52:43,239
nodes and links or you can have neural
 

5429
01:52:43,239 --> 01:52:45,790
nodes and links or you can have neural
like nodes and links you can also have

5430
01:52:45,790 --> 01:52:45,800
like nodes and links you can also have
 

5431
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:48,310
like nodes and links you can also have
procedure like nodes and links as as in

5432
01:52:48,310 --> 01:52:48,320
procedure like nodes and links as as in
 

5433
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:51,149
procedure like nodes and links as as in
say uh combinatory logic or or or Lambda

5434
01:52:51,149 --> 01:52:51,159
say uh combinatory logic or or or Lambda
 

5435
01:52:51,159 --> 01:52:53,830
say uh combinatory logic or or or Lambda
calculus representing programs so you

5436
01:52:53,830 --> 01:52:53,840
calculus representing programs so you
 

5437
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:55,510
calculus representing programs so you
can have nodes and links

5438
01:52:55,510 --> 01:52:55,520
can have nodes and links
 

5439
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:57,629
can have nodes and links
representing many different types of

5440
01:52:57,629 --> 01:52:57,639
representing many different types of
 

5441
01:52:57,639 --> 01:52:59,470
representing many different types of
semantics which means you could make a

5442
01:52:59,470 --> 01:52:59,480
semantics which means you could make a
 

5443
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:01,990
semantics which means you could make a
horrible ugly mess or you can make a

5444
01:53:01,990 --> 01:53:02,000
horrible ugly mess or you can make a
 

5445
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:03,830
horrible ugly mess or you can make a
system where these different types of

5446
01:53:03,830 --> 01:53:03,840
system where these different types of
 

5447
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:06,189
system where these different types of
knowledge all interpenetrate and

5448
01:53:06,189 --> 01:53:06,199
knowledge all interpenetrate and
 

5449
01:53:06,199 --> 01:53:08,709
knowledge all interpenetrate and
synergize with each other beautifully

5450
01:53:08,709 --> 01:53:08,719
synergize with each other beautifully
 

5451
01:53:08,719 --> 01:53:11,030
synergize with each other beautifully
right so you so the so the hypergraph

5452
01:53:11,030 --> 01:53:11,040
right so you so the so the hypergraph
 

5453
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:13,589
right so you so the so the hypergraph

different kinds of knowledge that needs
 

5567
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:31,629
different kinds of knowledge that needs
to be represented and is I mean like is

5568
01:55:31,629 --> 01:55:31,639
to be represented and is I mean like is
 

5569
01:55:31,639 --> 01:55:32,629
to be represented and is I mean like is
it

5570
01:55:32,629 --> 01:55:32,639
it
 

5571
01:55:32,639 --> 01:55:35,830

type system yeah yeah so this this this

5576
01:55:39,750 --> 01:55:39,760
type system yeah yeah so this this this
 

5577
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:42,669
type system yeah yeah so this this this
gets very nitty-gritty and and

5578
01:55:42,669 --> 01:55:42,679
gets very nitty-gritty and and
 

5579
01:55:42,679 --> 01:55:45,350
gets very nitty-gritty and and
mathematical of course but what one key

5580
01:55:45,350 --> 01:55:45,360
mathematical of course but what one key
 

5581
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:48,990
mathematical of course but what one key
part is switching from predicate logic

5582
01:55:48,990 --> 01:55:49,000
part is switching from predicate logic
 

5583
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,589
part is switching from predicate logic
to term logic what is predicate logic

5584
01:55:51,589 --> 01:55:51,599
to term logic what is predicate logic
 

5585
01:55:51,599 --> 01:55:54,470
to term logic what is predicate logic
what is term logic logic so term logic

5586
01:55:54,470 --> 01:55:54,480
what is term logic logic so term logic
 

5587
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:56,629
what is term logic logic so term logic
was invented by Aristotle or at least

5588
01:55:56,629 --> 01:55:56,639
was invented by Aristotle or at least
 

5589
01:55:56,639 --> 01:55:58,550
was invented by Aristotle or at least
that's the the oldest oldest

5590
01:55:58,550 --> 01:55:58,560
that's the the oldest oldest
 

5591
01:55:58,560 --> 01:56:00,750
that's the the oldest oldest
recollection we we we we have we have of

5592
01:56:00,750 --> 01:56:00,760
recollection we we we we have we have of
 

5593
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:04,709
recollection we we we we have we have of
it but term logic breaks down basic

5594
01:56:04,709 --> 01:56:04,719
it but term logic breaks down basic
 

5595
01:56:04,719 --> 01:56:06,669
it but term logic breaks down basic
logic into basically simple links

5596
01:56:06,669 --> 01:56:06,679
logic into basically simple links
 

5597
01:56:06,679 --> 01:56:09,629
logic into basically simple links
between nodes like a inheritance link

5598
01:56:09,629 --> 01:56:09,639
between nodes like a inheritance link
 

5599
01:56:09,639 --> 01:56:13,589
between nodes like a inheritance link
between between node a and and node B so

5600
01:56:13,589 --> 01:56:13,599
between between node a and and node B so
 

5601
01:56:13,599 --> 01:56:15,790
between between node a and and node B so
in term Logic the basic deduction

5602
01:56:15,790 --> 01:56:15,800
in term Logic the basic deduction
 

5603
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:19,550
in term Logic the basic deduction
operation is a implies b b implies C

5604
01:56:19,550 --> 01:56:19,560
operation is a implies b b implies C
 

5605
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:22,310
operation is a implies b b implies C
therefore a implies C whereas in

5606
01:56:22,310 --> 01:56:22,320
therefore a implies C whereas in
 

5607
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:24,149
therefore a implies C whereas in
predicate logic the basic operation is

5608
01:56:24,149 --> 01:56:24,159
predicate logic the basic operation is
 

5609
01:56:24,159 --> 01:56:26,910
predicate logic the basic operation is
modus ponents like a a implies B

5610
01:56:26,910 --> 01:56:26,920
modus ponents like a a implies B
 

5611
01:56:26,920 --> 01:56:29,589
modus ponents like a a implies B
therefore B so there're there it's a

5612
01:56:29,589 --> 01:56:29,599
therefore B so there're there it's a
 

5613
01:56:29,599 --> 01:56:31,030
therefore B so there're there it's a
slightly different way of breaking down

5614
01:56:31,030 --> 01:56:31,040
slightly different way of breaking down
 

5615
01:56:31,040 --> 01:56:34,430
slightly different way of breaking down
logic but by breaking down logic into

5616
01:56:34,430 --> 01:56:34,440
logic but by breaking down logic into
 

5617
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:36,790
logic but by breaking down logic into
term logic you get a nice way of

5618
01:56:36,790 --> 01:56:36,800
term logic you get a nice way of
 

5619
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:39,709
term logic you get a nice way of
breaking logic down into into into nodes

5620
01:56:39,709 --> 01:56:39,719
breaking logic down into into into nodes
 

5621
01:56:39,719 --> 01:56:41,790
breaking logic down into into into nodes
and links so your Concepts can can

5622
01:56:41,790 --> 01:56:41,800
and links so your Concepts can can
 

5623
01:56:41,800 --> 01:56:44,030
and links so your Concepts can can
become nodes The Logical relations

5624
01:56:44,030 --> 01:56:44,040
become nodes The Logical relations
 

5625
01:56:44,040 --> 01:56:46,430
become nodes The Logical relations
become links and so then inference is

5626
01:56:46,430 --> 01:56:46,440
become links and so then inference is
 

5627
01:56:46,440 --> 01:56:48,910
become links and so then inference is
like so if this link is a implies B this

5628
01:56:48,910 --> 01:56:48,920
like so if this link is a implies B this
 

5629
01:56:48,920 --> 01:56:51,470
like so if this link is a implies B this
link is B implies C then deduction

5630
01:56:51,470 --> 01:56:51,480
link is B implies C then deduction
 

5631
01:56:51,480 --> 01:56:53,910
link is B implies C then deduction
builds a link a implies C and and your

5632
01:56:53,910 --> 01:56:53,920
builds a link a implies C and and your
 

5633
01:56:53,920 --> 01:56:55,910
builds a link a implies C and and your
problemistic algorithm can assign assign

5634
01:56:55,910 --> 01:56:55,920
problemistic algorithm can assign assign
 

5635
01:56:55,920 --> 01:56:58,550
problemistic algorithm can assign assign
a certain weight there now you may also

5636
01:56:58,550 --> 01:56:58,560
a certain weight there now you may also
 

5637
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:00,350
a certain weight there now you may also
have like a heavy and neural link from a

5638
01:57:00,350 --> 01:57:00,360
have like a heavy and neural link from a
 

5639
01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:02,950
have like a heavy and neural link from a
to c which is the degree to which

5640
01:57:02,950 --> 01:57:02,960
to c which is the degree to which
 

5641
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:05,709
to c which is the degree to which
thinking the degree to which a being the

5642
01:57:05,709 --> 01:57:05,719
thinking the degree to which a being the
 

5643
01:57:05,719 --> 01:57:07,350
thinking the degree to which a being the
focus of attention should make B the

5644
01:57:07,350 --> 01:57:07,360
focus of attention should make B the
 

5645
01:57:07,360 --> 01:57:09,350
focus of attention should make B the
focus of attention right so you could

5646
01:57:09,350 --> 01:57:09,360
focus of attention right so you could
 

5647
01:57:09,360 --> 01:57:11,589
focus of attention right so you could
have then a neural link and and you

5648
01:57:11,589 --> 01:57:11,599
have then a neural link and and you
 

5649
01:57:11,599 --> 01:57:13,950
have then a neural link and and you
could you could have a symbolic like

5650
01:57:13,950 --> 01:57:13,960
could you could have a symbolic like
 

5651
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:16,109
could you could have a symbolic like
logical inheritance Link in your term

5652
01:57:16,109 --> 01:57:16,119
logical inheritance Link in your term
 

5653
01:57:16,119 --> 01:57:19,790
logical inheritance Link in your term
logic and they have separate meaning but

5654
01:57:19,790 --> 01:57:19,800
logic and they have separate meaning but
 

5655
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:22,270

5657
01:57:22,280 --> 01:57:25,229

doing and we had logic and neural Nets

5926
02:02:35,109 --> 02:02:35,119
doing and we had logic and neural Nets
 

5927
02:02:35,119 --> 02:02:38,350
doing and we had logic and neural Nets
in there but and evolutionary learning

in there but and evolutionary learning
 

5929
02:02:38,360 --> 02:02:40,910
in there but and evolutionary learning
but we hadn't done enough of the math to

5930
02:02:40,910 --> 02:02:40,920
but we hadn't done enough of the math to
 

5931
02:02:40,920 --> 02:02:42,669
but we hadn't done enough of the math to
get them to operate together very

use opencog on on the back end but we we

6022
02:04:37,229 --> 02:04:37,239
use opencog on on the back end but we we
 

6023
02:04:37,239 --> 02:04:40,189
use opencog on on the back end but we we
haven't that's not the AGI goal right

6024
02:04:40,189 --> 02:04:40,199
haven't that's not the AGI goal right
 

6025
02:04:40,199 --> 02:04:41,669
haven't that's not the AGI goal right
that's that's it's interesting but it's

6026
02:04:41,669 --> 02:04:41,679
that's that's it's interesting but it's
 

6027
02:04:41,679 --> 02:04:44,270
that's that's it's interesting but it's
not the AGI goal so now what what we're

6028
02:04:44,270 --> 02:04:44,280
not the AGI goal so now what what we're
 

6029
02:04:44,280 --> 02:04:48,470
not the AGI goal so now what what we're
looking at with our rebuilded the system

6030
02:04:48,470 --> 02:04:48,480
looking at with our rebuilded the system
 

6031
02:04:48,480 --> 02:04:51,270
looking at with our rebuilded the system
2.0 yeah we're also calling it true AGI

6032
02:04:51,270 --> 02:04:51,280
2.0 yeah we're also calling it true AGI
 

6033
02:04:51,280 --> 02:04:52,709
2.0 yeah we're also calling it true AGI
so we're not quite sure what the what

6034
02:04:52,709 --> 02:04:52,719
so we're not quite sure what the what
 

6035
02:04:52,719 --> 02:04:54,470
so we're not quite sure what the what
what the name what the name is yet that

6036
02:04:54,470 --> 02:04:54,480
what the name what the name is yet that
 

6037
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:57,910
what the name what the name is yet that
we we made a website for 2 ai. but we we

6038
02:04:57,910 --> 02:04:57,920
we we made a website for 2 ai. but we we
 

6039
02:04:57,920 --> 02:04:59,870
we we made a website for 2 ai. but we we
haven't put anything on there yet so we

6040
02:04:59,870 --> 02:04:59,880
haven't put anything on there yet so we
 

6041
02:04:59,880 --> 02:05:01,430
haven't put anything on there yet so we
may come up with an an even even better

6042
02:05:01,430 --> 02:05:01,440
may come up with an an even even better
 

6043
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:04,189
may come up with an an even even better
name but it's kind of like the real AI

6044
02:05:04,189 --> 02:05:04,199
name but it's kind of like the real AI
 

6045
02:05:04,199 --> 02:05:06,189
name but it's kind of like the real AI
starting point for your a but I like

6046
02:05:06,189 --> 02:05:06,199
starting point for your a but I like
 

6047
02:05:06,199 --> 02:05:08,589
starting point for your a but I like
true better because true has like you

6048
02:05:08,589 --> 02:05:08,599
true better because true has like you
 

6049
02:05:08,599 --> 02:05:09,950
true better because true has like you
can be true-hearted right you can be

6050
02:05:09,950 --> 02:05:09,960
can be true-hearted right you can be
 

6051
02:05:09,960 --> 02:05:13,189
can be true-hearted right you can be
true to your girlfriend so true true has

6052
02:05:13,189 --> 02:05:13,199
true to your girlfriend so true true has
 

6053
02:05:13,199 --> 02:05:15,109
true to your girlfriend so true true has
true has a number and it also has logic

6054
02:05:15,109 --> 02:05:15,119
true has a number and it also has logic
 

6055
02:05:15,119 --> 02:05:17,350
true has a number and it also has logic
in it right because logic is is a

6056
02:05:17,350 --> 02:05:17,360
in it right because logic is is a
 

6057
02:05:17,360 --> 02:05:20,149
in it right because logic is is a
key so yeah with with with the with the

6058
02:05:20,149 --> 02:05:20,159
key so yeah with with with the with the
 

6059
02:05:20,159 --> 02:05:22,310
key so yeah with with with the with the
true AGI system

6060
02:05:22,310 --> 02:05:22,320
true AGI system
 

6061
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:24,549

we're sticking with the same basic

6062
02:05:24,549 --> 02:05:24,559
we're sticking with the same basic
 

6063
02:05:24,559 --> 02:05:28,069
we're sticking with the same basic
architecture but we're we're we're

6064
02:05:28,069 --> 02:05:28,079
architecture but we're we're we're
 

6065
02:05:28,079 --> 02:05:30,030
architecture but we're we're we're
trying to build on what we've learned

6066
02:05:30,030 --> 02:05:30,040
trying to build on what we've learned
 

6067
02:05:30,040 --> 02:05:32,350
trying to build on what we've learned
one thing we've learned is that you know

6068
02:05:32,350 --> 02:05:32,360
one thing we've learned is that you know
 

6069
02:05:32,360 --> 02:05:36,350
one thing we've learned is that you know
we need type checking among dependent

6070
02:05:36,350 --> 02:05:36,360
we need type checking among dependent
 

6071
02:05:36,360 --> 02:05:38,390
we need type checking among dependent
types to be much faster and among

6072
02:05:38,390 --> 02:05:38,400
types to be much faster and among
 

6073
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:40,430
types to be much faster and among
probalistic dependent types to be much

6074
02:05:40,430 --> 02:05:40,440
probalistic dependent types to be much
 

6075
02:05:40,440 --> 02:05:44,830
probalistic dependent types to be much
faster so as it is now you can have

6076
02:05:44,830 --> 02:05:44,840
faster so as it is now you can have
 

6077
02:05:44,840 --> 02:05:47,149
faster so as it is now you can have
complex Types on the nodes and links but

6078
02:05:47,149 --> 02:05:47,159
complex Types on the nodes and links but
 

6079

if you want to put like if you want

6080
02:05:48,830 --> 02:05:48,840
if you want to put like if you want
 

6081
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:51,750
if you want to put like if you want
types to be first class citizens so that

6082
02:05:51,750 --> 02:05:51,760
types to be first class citizens so that
 

6083
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:53,750
types to be first class citizens so that
you can have the types can be variables

6084
02:05:53,750 --> 02:05:53,760
you can have the types can be variables
 

6085
02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:55,589
you can have the types can be variables
and then and then you do type checking

6086
02:05:55,589 --> 02:05:55,599
and then and then you do type checking
 

6087
02:05:55,599 --> 02:05:58,189
and then and then you do type checking
among complex higher order types you can

6088
02:05:58,189 --> 02:05:58,199
among complex higher order types you can
 

6089
02:05:58,199 --> 02:05:59,950
among complex higher order types you can
do that in the system now but it's very

6090
02:05:59,950 --> 02:05:59,960
do that in the system now but it's very
 

6091
02:05:59,960 --> 02:06:02,669
do that in the system now but it's very
slow this is stuff like it's done in in

a simple paper on that that I'll give it
the next a AGI conference the online

6234
02:08:55,830 --> 02:08:55,840
the next a AGI conference the online
 

6235
02:08:55,840 --> 02:08:57,709
the next a AGI conference the online
portion of which is next week actually

6236
02:08:57,709 --> 02:08:57,719
portion of which is next week actually
 

6237
02:08:57,719 --> 02:09:01,310
portion of which is next week actually
so what is grammar induction so this

6238
02:09:01,310 --> 02:09:01,320
so what is grammar induction so this
 

6239
02:09:01,320 --> 02:09:04,549
so what is grammar induction so this
isn't AGI either but it it's sort of on

6240
02:09:04,549 --> 02:09:04,559
isn't AGI either but it it's sort of on
 

6241
02:09:04,559 --> 02:09:07,510
isn't AGI either but it it's sort of on
the verge between nari and AGI or

6242
02:09:07,510 --> 02:09:07,520
the verge between nari and AGI or
 

6243
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:09,990
the verge between nari and AGI or
something unsupervised grammar induction

6244
02:09:09,990 --> 02:09:10,000
something unsupervised grammar induction
 

6245
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:13,149
something unsupervised grammar induction
is the problem throw your AI system a

6246
02:09:13,149 --> 02:09:13,159
is the problem throw your AI system a
 

6247
02:09:13,159 --> 02:09:14,510
is the problem throw your AI system a
huge body of

6248
02:09:14,510 --> 02:09:14,520
huge body of
 

6249
02:09:14,520 --> 02:09:17,629
huge body of
text and have it learn the grammar of

6250
02:09:17,629 --> 02:09:17,639
text and have it learn the grammar of
 

6251
02:09:17,639 --> 02:09:20,510
text and have it learn the grammar of
the language that produced that text so

6252
02:09:20,510 --> 02:09:20,520
the language that produced that text so
 

6253
02:09:20,520 --> 02:09:22,069
the language that produced that text so
you're you're not giving it labeled

6254
02:09:22,069 --> 02:09:22,079
you're you're not giving it labeled
 

6255
02:09:22,079 --> 02:09:23,589
you're you're not giving it labeled
examples so you're not giving it like a

6256
02:09:23,589 --> 02:09:23,599
examples so you're not giving it like a
 

6257
02:09:23,599 --> 02:09:25,109
examples so you're not giving it like a
thousand sentences where the parses were

6258
02:09:25,109 --> 02:09:25,119
thousand sentences where the parses were
 

6259
02:09:25,119 --> 02:09:27,430
thousand sentences where the parses were
marked up by graduate students so it's

6260
02:09:27,430 --> 02:09:27,440
marked up by graduate students so it's
 

6261
02:09:27,440 --> 02:09:29,510
marked up by graduate students so it's
just got to infer the grammar from from

6262
02:09:29,510 --> 02:09:29,520
just got to infer the grammar from from
 

6263
02:09:29,520 --> 02:09:31,750
just got to infer the grammar from from
from the text it's like it's like the

6264
02:09:31,750 --> 02:09:31,760
from the text it's like it's like the
 

6265
02:09:31,760 --> 02:09:33,510
from the text it's like it's like the
Rosetta Stone but worse right because

6266
02:09:33,510 --> 02:09:33,520
Rosetta Stone but worse right because
 

6267
02:09:33,520 --> 02:09:35,350
Rosetta Stone but worse right because
you only have the one language yeah and

6268
02:09:35,350 --> 02:09:35,360
you only have the one language yeah and
 

6269
02:09:35,360 --> 02:09:36,750
you only have the one language yeah and
you have to figure out what what is the

6270
02:09:36,750 --> 02:09:36,760
you have to figure out what what is the
 

6271
02:09:36,760 --> 02:09:41,390
you have to figure out what what is the
grammar so that's not really AGI because

6272
02:09:41,390 --> 02:09:41,400
grammar so that's not really AGI because
 

6273
02:09:41,400 --> 02:09:43,030
grammar so that's not really AGI because
I mean the the way a human learns

6274
02:09:43,030 --> 02:09:43,040
I mean the the way a human learns
 

6275
02:09:43,040 --> 02:09:44,870
I mean the the way a human learns
language is not that right I mean we we

6276
02:09:44,870 --> 02:09:44,880
language is not that right I mean we we
 

6277
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:47,189
language is not that right I mean we we
learn from language that's used in

6278
02:09:47,189 --> 02:09:47,199
learn from language that's used in
 

6279
02:09:47,199 --> 02:09:49,350
learn from language that's used in
context so it's a social embodied thing

6280
02:09:49,350 --> 02:09:49,360
context so it's a social embodied thing
 

6281
02:09:49,360 --> 02:09:52,430
context so it's a social embodied thing
we see we see how a given is grounded in

6282
02:09:52,430 --> 02:09:52,440
we see we see how a given is grounded in
 

6283
02:09:52,440 --> 02:09:54,470
we see we see how a given is grounded in
in observation there's an interactive

6284
02:09:54,470 --> 02:09:54,480
in observation there's an interactive
 

6285
02:09:54,480 --> 02:09:56,830
in observation there's an interactive
element I guess to yeah yeah on the

6286
02:09:56,830 --> 02:09:56,840
element I guess to yeah yeah on the
 

6287
02:09:56,840 --> 02:10:00,109
element I guess to yeah yeah on the
other hand so I'm I'm more interested in

6288
02:10:00,109 --> 02:10:00,119
other hand so I'm I'm more interested in
 

6289
02:10:00,119 --> 02:10:01,470
other hand so I'm I'm more interested in
that I'm more interested in making an

6290
02:10:01,470 --> 02:10:01,480
that I'm more interested in making an
 

6291
02:10:01,480 --> 02:10:03,430
that I'm more interested in making an
AGI system learn language from its

6292
02:10:03,430 --> 02:10:03,440
AGI system learn language from its
 

6293
02:10:03,440 --> 02:10:05,790
AGI system learn language from its
social and embodied experience on the

6294
02:10:05,790 --> 02:10:05,800
social and embodied experience on the
 

6295
02:10:05,800 --> 02:10:08,030
social and embodied experience on the
other hand that's also more of a pain to

6296
02:10:08,030 --> 02:10:08,040
other hand that's also more of a pain to
 

6297
02:10:08,040 --> 02:10:09,629
other hand that's also more of a pain to
do and that that would lead us into

6298
02:10:09,629 --> 02:10:09,639
do and that that would lead us into
 

6299
02:10:09,639 --> 02:10:11,510
do and that that would lead us into
Hansen Robotics and their robotics work

6300
02:10:11,510 --> 02:10:11,520
Hansen Robotics and their robotics work
 

6301
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:12,990
Hansen Robotics and their robotics work
I've done which we'll talk about in a

6302
02:10:12,990 --> 02:10:13,000
I've done which we'll talk about in a
 

6303
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:16,030
I've done which we'll talk about in a
few minutes but just as an intellectual

6304
02:10:16,030 --> 02:10:16,040
few minutes but just as an intellectual
 

6305
02:10:16,040 --> 02:10:18,990
few minutes but just as an intellectual
exercise as a learning exercise trying

6306
02:10:18,990 --> 02:10:19,000
exercise as a learning exercise trying
 

6307
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:23,310
exercise as a learning exercise trying
to learn grammar from a corpus is very

6308
02:10:23,310 --> 02:10:23,320
to learn grammar from a corpus is very
 

6309
02:10:23,320 --> 02:10:25,549
to learn grammar from a corpus is very
very interesting right and and that's

6310
02:10:25,549 --> 02:10:25,559
very interesting right and and that's
 

6311
02:10:25,559 --> 02:10:27,510
very interesting right and and that's
been a field in AI for a long time no

6312
02:10:27,510 --> 02:10:27,520
been a field in AI for a long time no
 

6313
02:10:27,520 --> 02:10:29,629
been a field in AI for a long time no
one can do it very well so we've been

6314
02:10:29,629 --> 02:10:29,639
one can do it very well so we've been
 

6315
02:10:29,639 --> 02:10:31,950
one can do it very well so we've been
looking at Transformer neural networks

6316
02:10:31,950 --> 02:10:31,960
looking at Transformer neural networks
 

6317
02:10:31,960 --> 02:10:35,790
looking at Transformer neural networks
and tree Transformers which are amazing

6318
02:10:35,790 --> 02:10:35,800
and tree Transformers which are amazing
 

6319
02:10:35,800 --> 02:10:38,030
and tree Transformers which are amazing
these came out of uh of Google Google

6320
02:10:38,030 --> 02:10:38,040
these came out of uh of Google Google
 

6321
02:10:38,040 --> 02:10:40,870
these came out of uh of Google Google
brain actually and actually on that team

6322
02:10:40,870 --> 02:10:40,880
brain actually and actually on that team
 

6323
02:10:40,880 --> 02:10:43,030
brain actually and actually on that team
was Lucas Kaiser who used to work for me

6324
02:10:43,030 --> 02:10:43,040
was Lucas Kaiser who used to work for me
 

6325
02:10:43,040 --> 02:10:46,149
was Lucas Kaiser who used to work for me
in in one the period 200 5 through 8

6326
02:10:46,149 --> 02:10:46,159
in in one the period 200 5 through 8
 

6327
02:10:46,159 --> 02:10:48,350
in in one the period 200 5 through 8
through 8 or something so it's been fun

6328
02:10:48,350 --> 02:10:48,360
through 8 or something so it's been fun
 

6329
02:10:48,360 --> 02:10:51,629
through 8 or something so it's been fun
to see my former sort of AGI employee

6330
02:10:51,629 --> 02:10:51,639
to see my former sort of AGI employee
 

6331
02:10:51,639 --> 02:10:54,030
to see my former sort of AGI employee
disperse and do all these amazing things

6332
02:10:54,030 --> 02:10:54,040
disperse and do all these amazing things
 

6333
02:10:54,040 --> 02:10:56,830
disperse and do all these amazing things
way too many sucked into Google actually

6334
02:10:56,830 --> 02:10:56,840
way too many sucked into Google actually
 

6335
02:10:56,840 --> 02:10:58,350
way too many sucked into Google actually
well yeah anyway we'll talk about that

6336
02:10:58,350 --> 02:10:58,360
well yeah anyway we'll talk about that
 

6337
02:10:58,360 --> 02:11:00,350
well yeah anyway we'll talk about that
too Lucas Kaiser and a bunch of these

6338
02:11:00,350 --> 02:11:00,360
too Lucas Kaiser and a bunch of these
 

6339
02:11:00,360 --> 02:11:02,149
too Lucas Kaiser and a bunch of these
guys they they create Transformer

6340
02:11:02,149 --> 02:11:02,159
guys they they create Transformer
 

6341
02:11:02,159 --> 02:11:04,270
guys they they create Transformer
networks that classic paper like

6342
02:11:04,270 --> 02:11:04,280
networks that classic paper like
 

6343
02:11:04,280 --> 02:11:06,270
networks that classic paper like
attention is all you need and all these

6344
02:11:06,270 --> 02:11:06,280
attention is all you need and all these
 

6345
02:11:06,280 --> 02:11:08,430
attention is all you need and all these
things following on from that so we're

6346
02:11:08,430 --> 02:11:08,440
things following on from that so we're
 

6347
02:11:08,440 --> 02:11:11,510
things following on from that so we're
looking at Transformer networks and like

6348
02:11:11,510 --> 02:11:11,520
looking at Transformer networks and like
 

6349
02:11:11,520 --> 02:11:13,990
looking at Transformer networks and like
these are able to I mean this is what

6350
02:11:13,990 --> 02:11:14,000
these are able to I mean this is what
 

6351
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,629
these are able to I mean this is what
underlies gpt2 and gpt3 and so on which

6352
02:11:16,629 --> 02:11:16,639
underlies gpt2 and gpt3 and so on which
 

6353
02:11:16,639 --> 02:11:19,069
underlies gpt2 and gpt3 and so on which
are very very cool and have absolutely

6354
02:11:19,069 --> 02:11:19,079
are very very cool and have absolutely
 

6355
02:11:19,079 --> 02:11:20,750
are very very cool and have absolutely
no cognitive understanding of any of the

6358
02:11:22,709 --> 02:11:22,719
Texs are at like they're they're very
 

6359
02:11:22,719 --> 02:11:24,629

intell they're very intelligent idiots

6360
02:11:24,629 --> 02:11:24,639
intell they're very intelligent idiots
 

6361
02:11:24,639 --> 02:11:27,390
intell they're very intelligent idiots
right so uh sorry to take but a small

6362
02:11:27,390 --> 02:11:27,400
right so uh sorry to take but a small
 

6363
02:11:27,400 --> 02:11:30,149
right so uh sorry to take but a small
bring us back but do you think

6364
02:11:30,149 --> 02:11:30,159
bring us back but do you think
 

6365
02:11:30,159 --> 02:11:32,629
bring us back but do you think
gpt3 understands no not all it

6366
02:11:32,629 --> 02:11:32,639
gpt3 understands no not all it
 

6367
02:11:32,639 --> 02:11:34,589
gpt3 understands no not all it
understands nothing he's a complete

idiot but brilliant idiot you don't

6370
02:11:37,069 --> 02:11:37,079
idiot but brilliant idiot you don't
 

6371
02:11:37,079 --> 02:11:40,790
idiot but brilliant idiot you don't
think GPT uh 20 will understand langage

6372
02:11:40,790 --> 02:11:40,800
think GPT uh 20 will understand langage
 

6373
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:44,589
think GPT uh 20 will understand langage
no no no AB size is not going to buy you

6374
02:11:44,589 --> 02:11:44,599
no no no AB size is not going to buy you
 

6375
02:11:44,599 --> 02:11:46,910
no no no AB size is not going to buy you
understanding any more than a faster car

6377
02:11:46,920 --> 02:11:48,790
understanding any more than a faster car
is going to get you to Mars yeah okay

6378
02:11:48,790 --> 02:11:48,800
is going to get you to Mars yeah okay
 

6379
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:50,149
is going to get you to Mars yeah okay
it's a completely different kind of

6380
02:11:50,149 --> 02:11:50,159
it's a completely different kind of
 

6381
02:11:50,159 --> 02:11:52,390
it's a completely different kind of
thing I mean

6382
02:11:52,390 --> 02:11:52,400
thing I mean
 

6383
02:11:52,400 --> 02:11:54,830
thing I mean
these networks are very cool and as an

6384
02:11:54,830 --> 02:11:54,840
these networks are very cool and as an
 

6385
02:11:54,840 --> 02:11:56,549
these networks are very cool and as an

02:12:23,559 --> 02:12:25,830
right like that so these models are are
are super cool and I'm I'm working with

launched yet but so I think it's cool

6418
02:12:35,950 --> 02:12:35,960

6419
02:12:35,960 --> 02:12:37,470

02:12:40,549 --> 02:12:40,559
these are recognizing a large number of

02:12:40,559 --> 02:12:42,629
these are recognizing a large number of

02:12:42,629 --> 02:12:42,639
shallow patterns that they're not
 

6425
02:12:42,639 --> 02:12:43,950
shallow patterns that they're not
they're not forming an abstract

they're not forming an abstract
 

6427
02:12:43,960 --> 02:12:45,750
they're not forming an abstract
representation and that's the point I

6428
02:12:45,750 --> 02:12:45,760

was coming to when we're looking at
 

6431
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,950
was coming to when we're looking at
grammar induction we tried to mine

you want they're they're nasty so I mean

02:13:00,910 --> 02:13:00,920
you want they're they're nasty so I mean
 

6443
02:13:00,920 --> 02:13:03,350
you want they're they're nasty so I mean
you if you do supervised learning if you

6444
02:13:03,350 --> 02:13:03,360
you if you do supervised learning if you
 

6445
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:04,589
you if you do supervised learning if you
look at sentences where you know the

6446
02:13:04,589 --> 02:13:04,599
look at sentences where you know the
 

6447
02:13:04,599 --> 02:13:06,790
look at sentences where you know the
correct parts of a sentence you can

6448
02:13:06,790 --> 02:13:06,800
correct parts of a sentence you can
 

6449
02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:09,709
correct parts of a sentence you can
learn a matrix that Maps between the

6450
02:13:09,709 --> 02:13:09,719
learn a matrix that Maps between the
 

6451
02:13:09,719 --> 02:13:11,189
learn a matrix that Maps between the
internal representation of the

6452
02:13:11,189 --> 02:13:11,199
internal representation of the
 

6453
02:13:11,199 --> 02:13:13,149
internal representation of the
Transformer and the parts of the

6454
02:13:13,149 --> 02:13:13,159
Transformer and the parts of the
 

6455
02:13:13,159 --> 02:13:15,430
Transformer and the parts of the
sentence and so then you can actually

6456
02:13:15,430 --> 02:13:15,440
sentence and so then you can actually
 

6457
02:13:15,440 --> 02:13:16,790
sentence and so then you can actually
train something that will output the

6458
02:13:16,790 --> 02:13:16,800
train something that will output the
 

6459
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:19,310
train something that will output the
sentence parse from the Transformer

6460
02:13:19,310 --> 02:13:19,320
sentence parse from the Transformer
 

6461
02:13:19,320 --> 02:13:21,430

Network's internal State and we we did

6462
02:13:21,430 --> 02:13:21,440
Network's internal State and we we did
 

6463
02:13:21,440 --> 02:13:22,790
Network's internal State and we we did
this I think

6464
02:13:22,790 --> 02:13:22,800
this I think
 

6465
02:13:22,800 --> 02:13:25,510
this I think
uh Christopher Manning some some some

6466
02:13:25,510 --> 02:13:25,520
uh Christopher Manning some some some
 

6467
02:13:25,520 --> 02:13:27,189
uh Christopher Manning some some some
others have now done this

6468
02:13:27,189 --> 02:13:27,199
others have now done this
 

6469
02:13:27,199 --> 02:13:29,910
others have now done this
also but I mean what you get is that the

6470
02:13:29,910 --> 02:13:29,920
also but I mean what you get is that the
 

6471
02:13:29,920 --> 02:13:31,589
also but I mean what you get is that the
representation is horribly ugly and is

6472
02:13:31,589 --> 02:13:31,599
representation is horribly ugly and is
 

6473
02:13:31,599 --> 02:13:33,589
representation is horribly ugly and is
scouted all over the network and doesn't

6474
02:13:33,589 --> 02:13:33,599
scouted all over the network and doesn't
 

6475
02:13:33,599 --> 02:13:35,149
scouted all over the network and doesn't
look like the rules of grammar that you

6476
02:13:35,149 --> 02:13:35,159
look like the rules of grammar that you
 

6477
02:13:35,159 --> 02:13:36,790
look like the rules of grammar that you
know are the right rules of grammar

6478
02:13:36,790 --> 02:13:36,800
know are the right rules of grammar
 

6479
02:13:36,800 --> 02:13:39,109
know are the right rules of grammar
right it's kind of ugly so what what

6480
02:13:39,109 --> 02:13:39,119
right it's kind of ugly so what what
 

6481
02:13:39,119 --> 02:13:41,549
right it's kind of ugly so what what
we're actually doing is we're using a

6482
02:13:41,549 --> 02:13:41,559
we're actually doing is we're using a
 

6483
02:13:41,559 --> 02:13:44,390
we're actually doing is we're using a
symbolic grammar learning algorithm but

6484
02:13:44,390 --> 02:13:44,400
symbolic grammar learning algorithm but
 

6485
02:13:44,400 --> 02:13:45,870
symbolic grammar learning algorithm but
we're using the Transformer neural

6486
02:13:45,870 --> 02:13:45,880
we're using the Transformer neural
 

6487
02:13:45,880 --> 02:13:48,870
we're using the Transformer neural

so like when when you if you have a rule

6490
02:13:51,310 --> 02:13:51,320
so like when when you if you have a rule
 

6491
02:13:51,320 --> 02:13:52,950
so like when when you if you have a rule
of grammar and you wen't sure if it's a

6492
02:13:52,950 --> 02:13:52,960
of grammar and you wen't sure if it's a
 

6493
02:13:52,960 --> 02:13:55,069
of grammar and you wen't sure if it's a
correct rule of grammar or not you can

6494
02:13:55,069 --> 02:13:55,079
correct rule of grammar or not you can
 

6495
02:13:55,079 --> 02:13:56,870
correct rule of grammar or not you can
generate a bunch of sentences using that

6496
02:13:56,870 --> 02:13:56,880
generate a bunch of sentences using that
 

6497
02:13:56,880 --> 02:13:59,069
generate a bunch of sentences using that
rule of grammar and a bunch of sentences

6498
02:13:59,069 --> 02:13:59,079
rule of grammar and a bunch of sentences
 

6499
02:13:59,079 --> 02:14:01,149
rule of grammar and a bunch of sentences
violating that rule of grammar and you

6500
02:14:01,149 --> 02:14:01,159
violating that rule of grammar and you
 

6501
02:14:01,159 --> 02:14:04,430
violating that rule of grammar and you
can see the the Transformer model

6502
02:14:04,430 --> 02:14:04,440
can see the the Transformer model
 

6503
02:14:04,440 --> 02:14:06,069
can see the the Transformer model
doesn't think the sentences obeying the

6504
02:14:06,069 --> 02:14:06,079
doesn't think the sentences obeying the
 

6505
02:14:06,079 --> 02:14:07,669
doesn't think the sentences obeying the
rule of grammar are more probable than

6506
02:14:07,669 --> 02:14:07,679
rule of grammar are more probable than
 

6507
02:14:07,679 --> 02:14:09,149
rule of grammar are more probable than
the Sens is disobeying the rule of

6508
02:14:09,149 --> 02:14:09,159
the Sens is disobeying the rule of
 

6509
02:14:09,159 --> 02:14:11,189
the Sens is disobeying the rule of
grammar so in that way you can use the

6510
02:14:11,189 --> 02:14:11,199
grammar so in that way you can use the
 

6511
02:14:11,199 --> 02:14:12,990
grammar so in that way you can use the
neural model as a sense probability

6512
02:14:12,990 --> 02:14:13,000
neural model as a sense probability
 

6513
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:17,990
neural model as a sense probability

6515
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:21,669

learning process and that's to work

6516
02:14:21,669 --> 02:14:21,679

6517
02:14:21,679 --> 02:14:24,790
learning process and that's to work
better than trying to milk the grammar

6518
02:14:24,790 --> 02:14:24,800
better than trying to milk the grammar
 

6519
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:26,229
better than trying to milk the grammar
out of the neural network that doesn't

6520
02:14:26,229 --> 02:14:26,239
out of the neural network that doesn't
 

6521
02:14:26,239 --> 02:14:28,669
out of the neural network that doesn't
have it in there so I think the thing is

6522
02:14:28,669 --> 02:14:28,679
have it in there so I think the thing is
 

6523
02:14:28,679 --> 02:14:31,149
have it in there so I think the thing is
these neural Nets are not getting a

6524
02:14:31,149 --> 02:14:31,159
these neural Nets are not getting a
 

6525
02:14:31,159 --> 02:14:32,910
these neural Nets are not getting a
semantically meaningful representation

6526
02:14:32,910 --> 02:14:32,920
semantically meaningful representation
 

6527
02:14:32,920 --> 02:14:36,189
semantically meaningful representation
internally by and large so one line of

02:14:36,189 --> 02:14:36,199
internally by and large so one line of
 

6529
02:14:36,199 --> 02:14:37,950
internally by and large so one line of
research is to try to get them to do

6530
02:14:37,950 --> 02:14:37,960
research is to try to get them to do
 

6531
02:14:37,960 --> 02:14:39,790
research is to try to get them to do
that and in infog gam was trying to do

6532
02:14:39,790 --> 02:14:39,800
that and in infog gam was trying to do
 

6533
02:14:39,800 --> 02:14:41,669
that and in infog gam was trying to do
that so like if if you look back like

02:14:41,669 --> 02:14:41,679
that so like if if you look back like
 

6535
02:14:41,679 --> 02:14:44,030
that so like if if you look back like

Google had which came out of infog so

6542
02:14:49,870 --> 02:14:49,880
Google had which came out of infog so
 

6543
02:14:49,880 --> 02:14:53,149
Google had which came out of infog so
the the idea there was like you you

6544
02:14:53,149 --> 02:14:53,159
the the idea there was like you you
 

6545
02:14:53,159 --> 02:14:55,549
the the idea there was like you you
could train an infogan neural net model

6546
02:14:55,549 --> 02:14:55,559
could train an infogan neural net model
 

6547
02:14:55,559 --> 02:14:56,790
could train an infogan neural net model
which is a generative associative

6548
02:14:56,790 --> 02:14:56,800
which is a generative associative
 

6549
02:14:56,800 --> 02:14:59,189
which is a generative associative
Network to recognize and generate faces

6550
02:14:59,189 --> 02:14:59,199
Network to recognize and generate faces
 

6551
02:14:59,199 --> 02:15:01,470
Network to recognize and generate faces
and the model would automatically learn

6552
02:15:01,470 --> 02:15:01,480
and the model would automatically learn
 

6553
02:15:01,480 --> 02:15:03,350
and the model would automatically learn
a variable for how long the nose is and

6554
02:15:03,350 --> 02:15:03,360
a variable for how long the nose is and
 

6555
02:15:03,360 --> 02:15:04,750
a variable for how long the nose is and
automatically learn a variable for how

6556
02:15:04,750 --> 02:15:04,760
automatically learn a variable for how
 

6557
02:15:04,760 --> 02:15:06,830
automatically learn a variable for how
wide the eyes are or or how big the lips

6558
02:15:06,830 --> 02:15:06,840
wide the eyes are or or how big the lips
 

6559
02:15:06,840 --> 02:15:08,310
wide the eyes are or or how big the lips
are or something right so it

6560
02:15:08,310 --> 02:15:08,320
are or something right so it
 

6561
02:15:08,320 --> 02:15:10,149
are or something right so it
automatically learn the the these

6562
02:15:10,149 --> 02:15:10,159
automatically learn the the these
 

6563
02:15:10,159 --> 02:15:12,470
automatically learn the the these
variables which have a semantic meaning

6564
02:15:12,470 --> 02:15:12,480
variables which have a semantic meaning
 

6565
02:15:12,480 --> 02:15:14,629
variables which have a semantic meaning
so that that was a rare case where a

6566
02:15:14,629 --> 02:15:14,639
so that that was a rare case where a
 

6567

02:15:19,069 --> 02:15:19,079
Gan method was able to actually learn
 

6571
02:15:19,079 --> 02:15:21,229
Gan method was able to actually learn
the semantic representation so so for

6572
02:15:21,229 --> 02:15:21,239
the semantic representation so so for
 

6573
02:15:21,239 --> 02:15:23,189
the semantic representation so so for
many years many of us tried to take that

6574
02:15:23,189 --> 02:15:23,199
many years many of us tried to take that
 

6575
02:15:23,199 --> 02:15:26,350
many years many of us tried to take that
the next step and get a Gant type neural

6576
02:15:26,350 --> 02:15:26,360
the next step and get a Gant type neural
 

6577
02:15:26,360 --> 02:15:28,950
the next step and get a Gant type neural
network that that would have not just a

6597
02:15:46,920 --> 02:15:48,669
be that back propagation just won't work

didn't get it to work eventually we just
 

6607
02:15:59,679 --> 02:16:01,510
didn't get it to work eventually we just
paused that rather than gave it up we

described how we're doing that

6622
02:16:18,109 --> 02:16:18,119
described how we're doing that
 

6623
02:16:18,119 --> 02:16:20,910
described how we're doing that
in language you can do similar things in

Vision right so use it as an oracle yeah

6626
02:16:23,709 --> 02:16:23,719
Vision right so use it as an oracle yeah
 

6627
02:16:23,719 --> 02:16:25,870
Vision right so use it as an oracle yeah
yeah yeah so you can that's one way is

6628
02:16:25,870 --> 02:16:25,880
yeah yeah so you can that's one way is
 

6629
02:16:25,880 --> 02:16:27,549
yeah yeah so you can that's one way is
you use a structure learning algorithm

6630
02:16:27,549 --> 02:16:27,559
you use a structure learning algorithm
 

6631
02:16:27,559 --> 02:16:29,990
you use a structure learning algorithm
which is symbolic and and and then you

6632
02:16:29,990 --> 02:16:30,000
which is symbolic and and and then you
 

6633
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,389
which is symbolic and and and then you
use the the Deep neural net as an oracle

6634
02:16:32,389 --> 02:16:32,399
use the the Deep neural net as an oracle
 

6635
02:16:32,399 --> 02:16:33,589
use the the Deep neural net as an oracle
to guide the structure learning

6636
02:16:33,589 --> 02:16:33,599
to guide the structure learning
 

6637
02:16:33,599 --> 02:16:35,910
to guide the structure learning
algorithm the other way to do it is like

6638
02:16:35,910 --> 02:16:35,920
algorithm the other way to do it is like
 

6639
02:16:35,920 --> 02:16:38,790
algorithm the other way to do it is like
infog gam was trying to do and try to

6640
02:16:38,790 --> 02:16:38,800
infog gam was trying to do and try to
 

6641
02:16:38,800 --> 02:16:41,549
infog gam was trying to do and try to
tweak the neural network to have the

6642
02:16:41,549 --> 02:16:41,559
tweak the neural network to have the
 

6643
02:16:41,559 --> 02:16:44,230
tweak the neural network to have the
symbolic representation inside it I I

6644
02:16:44,230 --> 02:16:44,240
symbolic representation inside it I I
 

6645
02:16:44,240 --> 02:16:46,589
symbolic representation inside it I I
tend to think what the brain is doing is

6646
02:16:46,589 --> 02:16:46,599
tend to think what the brain is doing is
 

6647
02:16:46,599 --> 02:16:51,389
tend to think what the brain is doing is
more like using the Deep neural net type

6648
02:16:51,389 --> 02:16:51,399
more like using the Deep neural net type
 

6649
02:16:51,399 --> 02:16:53,110
more like using the Deep neural net type
thing as an oracle like I think the the

6650
02:16:53,110 --> 02:16:53,120
thing as an oracle like I think the the
 

6651
02:16:53,120 --> 02:16:56,870
thing as an oracle like I think the the
visual cortex or the cerebellum are

6652
02:16:56,870 --> 02:16:56,880
visual cortex or the cerebellum are
 

6653
02:16:56,880 --> 02:16:59,669
visual cortex or the cerebellum are
probably learning a non semantically

6654
02:16:59,669 --> 02:16:59,679
probably learning a non semantically
 

6655
02:16:59,679 --> 02:17:02,429
probably learning a non semantically
meaningful opaque Tangled representation

6656
02:17:02,429 --> 02:17:02,439
meaningful opaque Tangled representation
 

6657
02:17:02,439 --> 02:17:03,709
meaningful opaque Tangled representation
and then when they interface with the

6658
02:17:03,709 --> 02:17:03,719
and then when they interface with the
 

6659
02:17:03,719 --> 02:17:06,070
and then when they interface with the
more cognitive parts of the cortex the

6660
02:17:06,070 --> 02:17:06,080
more cognitive parts of the cortex the
 

6661
02:17:06,080 --> 02:17:08,349
more cognitive parts of the cortex the
cortex is sort of using those as an

6662
02:17:08,349 --> 02:17:08,359
cortex is sort of using those as an
 

6663
02:17:08,359 --> 02:17:10,110
cortex is sort of using those as an
Oracle and learning the abstract

6664
02:17:10,110 --> 02:17:10,120
Oracle and learning the abstract
 

6665
02:17:10,120 --> 02:17:12,549
Oracle and learning the abstract
representation so if you do Sports say

6666
02:17:12,549 --> 02:17:12,559
representation so if you do Sports say
 

6667
02:17:12,559 --> 02:17:15,230
representation so if you do Sports say
take for example serving in tennis right

6668
02:17:15,230 --> 02:17:15,240
take for example serving in tennis right
 

6669
02:17:15,240 --> 02:17:17,349
take for example serving in tennis right
I mean my tennis serve is okay not not

6670
02:17:17,349 --> 02:17:17,359
I mean my tennis serve is okay not not
 

6671
02:17:17,359 --> 02:17:18,750
I mean my tennis serve is okay not not
great but I learned it by trial and

6672
02:17:18,750 --> 02:17:18,760
great but I learned it by trial and
 

6673
02:17:18,760 --> 02:17:21,230
great but I learned it by trial and
error right and I mean I learned music

6674
02:17:21,230 --> 02:17:21,240
error right and I mean I learned music
 

6675
02:17:21,240 --> 02:17:23,150
error right and I mean I learned music
by trial Nar 2 I I just sit down and

6676
02:17:23,150 --> 02:17:23,160
by trial Nar 2 I I just sit down and
 

6677
02:17:23,160 --> 02:17:26,070
by trial Nar 2 I I just sit down and
play but then if you're an athlete which

6678
02:17:26,070 --> 02:17:26,080
play but then if you're an athlete which
 

6679
02:17:26,080 --> 02:17:27,509
play but then if you're an athlete which
I'm not a good athlete I mean then

6680
02:17:27,509 --> 02:17:27,519
I'm not a good athlete I mean then
 

6681
02:17:27,519 --> 02:17:30,309
I'm not a good athlete I mean then
you'll watch videos of yourself serving

6682
02:17:30,309 --> 02:17:30,319
you'll watch videos of yourself serving
 

6683
02:17:30,319 --> 02:17:31,790
you'll watch videos of yourself serving
and your coach will help you think about

6684
02:17:31,790 --> 02:17:31,800
and your coach will help you think about
 

6685
02:17:31,800 --> 02:17:33,709
and your coach will help you think about
what you're doing and you'll then form a

6686
02:17:33,709 --> 02:17:33,719
what you're doing and you'll then form a
 

6687
02:17:33,719 --> 02:17:35,429
what you're doing and you'll then form a
declarative representation but your

6688
02:17:35,429 --> 02:17:35,439
declarative representation but your
 

6689
02:17:35,439 --> 02:17:37,150
declarative representation but your
cerebellum maybe didn't have a

02:17:45,399 --> 02:17:49,549
head I'll sit down and play the thing
like I heard it and then then I will try

6698
02:17:49,549 --> 02:17:49,559
like I heard it and then then I will try
 

6699
02:17:49,559 --> 02:17:51,669
like I heard it and then then I will try
to study what my fingers did to see like

6700
02:17:51,669 --> 02:17:51,679
to study what my fingers did to see like
 

6701
02:17:51,679 --> 02:17:54,190
to study what my fingers did to see like
what what did you just play like how how

6702
02:17:54,190 --> 02:17:54,200
what what did you just play like how how
 

6703
02:17:54,200 --> 02:17:56,669
what what did you just play like how how
did you do that right because if you're

6704
02:17:56,669 --> 02:17:56,679
did you do that right because if you're
 

6705
02:17:56,679 --> 02:17:58,790
did you do that right because if you're
composing you may want to see how you

6706
02:17:58,790 --> 02:17:58,800
composing you may want to see how you
 

6707
02:17:58,800 --> 02:18:02,150
composing you may want to see how you
did it and then declaratively morph that

6708
02:18:02,150 --> 02:18:02,160
did it and then declaratively morph that
 

6709
02:18:02,160 --> 02:18:03,429
did it and then declaratively morph that
in some way that your fingers wouldn't

6710
02:18:03,429 --> 02:18:03,439
in some way that your fingers wouldn't
 

6711
02:18:03,439 --> 02:18:07,349
in some way that your fingers wouldn't
wouldn't think of right but the the

6712
02:18:07,349 --> 02:18:07,359
wouldn't think of right but the the
 

6713
02:18:07,359 --> 02:18:09,469
wouldn't think of right but the the
physiological movement may come out of

reinforcement learned thing right and so

6718
02:18:14,750 --> 02:18:14,760

6719
02:18:14,760 --> 02:18:17,190

that's I think trying to milk the

02:20:58,960 --> 02:21:01,790
Implement something like that
efficiently on top of our our true AGI

6854
02:21:01,790 --> 02:21:01,800
efficiently on top of our our true AGI
 

6855
02:21:01,800 --> 02:21:05,389
efficiently on top of our our true AGI
like opencog 2.0 system once it exists

6856
02:21:05,389 --> 02:21:05,399
like opencog 2.0 system once it exists
 

6857
02:21:05,399 --> 02:21:07,190
like opencog 2.0 system once it exists
although obviously Google has has their

6858
02:21:07,190 --> 02:21:07,200
although obviously Google has has their
 

6859
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:09,590
although obviously Google has has their
own highly efficient implementation

6860
02:21:09,590 --> 02:21:09,600
own highly efficient implementation
 

6861
02:21:09,600 --> 02:21:12,349
own highly efficient implementation
architecture so I think that's a decent

6862
02:21:12,349 --> 02:21:12,359
architecture so I think that's a decent
 

6863
02:21:12,359 --> 02:21:13,990
architecture so I think that's a decent
way to build AGI I was very interested

6864
02:21:13,990 --> 02:21:14,000
way to build AGI I was very interested
 

6865
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:17,270
way to build AGI I was very interested
in that in the mid90s but I mean the

6866
02:21:17,270 --> 02:21:17,280
in that in the mid90s but I mean the
 

6867
02:21:17,280 --> 02:21:19,590
in that in the mid90s but I mean the
knowledge about how the brain works sort

6868
02:21:19,590 --> 02:21:19,600
knowledge about how the brain works sort
 

6869
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:21,150
knowledge about how the brain works sort
of pissed me off like was it wasn't

6870
02:21:21,150 --> 02:21:21,160
of pissed me off like was it wasn't
 

6871
02:21:21,160 --> 02:21:22,270
of pissed me off like was it wasn't
there yet like you know in the

6872
02:21:22,270 --> 02:21:22,280
there yet like you know in the
 

6873
02:21:22,280 --> 02:21:23,790
there yet like you know in the
hippocampus you have these concept

6874
02:21:23,790 --> 02:21:23,800
hippocampus you have these concept
 

6875
02:21:23,800 --> 02:21:25,950
hippocampus you have these concept
neurons like the so-called grandmother

6876
02:21:25,950 --> 02:21:25,960
neurons like the so-called grandmother
 

6877
02:21:25,960 --> 02:21:27,910

neuron which everyone laughed at it it's

6878
02:21:27,910 --> 02:21:27,920
neuron which everyone laughed at it it's
 

6879
02:21:27,920 --> 02:21:29,710
neuron which everyone laughed at it it's
actually there like I have some Lex

6880
02:21:29,710 --> 02:21:29,720
actually there like I have some Lex
 

6881
02:21:29,720 --> 02:21:31,550
actually there like I have some Lex
Friedman neurons that fire

6882
02:21:31,550 --> 02:21:31,560
Friedman neurons that fire
 

6883
02:21:31,560 --> 02:21:33,309
Friedman neurons that fire
differentially when I when I see you and

6884
02:21:33,309 --> 02:21:33,319
differentially when I when I see you and
 

6885
02:21:33,319 --> 02:21:35,030
differentially when I when I see you and
not when I see any other person right

6886
02:21:35,030 --> 02:21:35,040
not when I see any other person right
 

6887
02:21:35,040 --> 02:21:37,790
not when I see any other person right
yeah so how how do these Lex Friedman

6888
02:21:37,790 --> 02:21:37,800
yeah so how how do these Lex Friedman
 

6889
02:21:37,800 --> 02:21:40,030
yeah so how how do these Lex Friedman
neurons how do they coordinate with the

6890
02:21:40,030 --> 02:21:40,040
neurons how do they coordinate with the
 

6891
02:21:40,040 --> 02:21:41,710
neurons how do they coordinate with the
distributed representation of Lex

6892
02:21:41,710 --> 02:21:41,720
distributed representation of Lex
 

6893
02:21:41,720 --> 02:21:44,510

02:21:44,510 --> 02:21:44,520
Freedman I have in my cortex right
 

6895
02:21:44,520 --> 02:21:45,870
Freedman I have in my cortex right
there's some back and forth between

6896
02:21:45,870 --> 02:21:45,880
there's some back and forth between
 

6897
02:21:45,880 --> 02:21:48,429
there's some back and forth between
cortex and hippocampus that lets these

02:21:54,790 --> 02:21:54,800
with the distributed representations in
 

6905
02:21:54,800 --> 02:21:56,950
with the distributed representations in
cortex this probably has to do with how

6906
02:21:56,950 --> 02:21:56,960
cortex this probably has to do with how
 

6907
02:21:56,960 --> 02:21:58,190
cortex this probably has to do with how
the brain does its version of

02:21:58,190 --> 02:21:58,200
the brain does its version of
 

6909
02:21:58,200 --> 02:22:00,270
the brain does its version of
abstraction and quantifier logic right

6910
02:22:00,270 --> 02:22:00,280
abstraction and quantifier logic right
 

6911
02:22:00,280 --> 02:22:01,710
abstraction and quantifier logic right
like you can have a single neuron

6912
02:22:01,710 --> 02:22:01,720
like you can have a single neuron
 

6913
02:22:01,720 --> 02:22:04,190
like you can have a single neuron
hippocampus that that activates a whole

6914
02:22:04,190 --> 02:22:04,200
hippocampus that that activates a whole
 

6915
02:22:04,200 --> 02:22:06,230

distributed activation pattern in in
 

6917
02:22:06,240 --> 02:22:08,429
distributed activation pattern in in
cortex well this this maybe how the

6918
02:22:08,429 --> 02:22:08,439
cortex well this this maybe how the
 

6919
02:22:08,439 --> 02:22:10,429
cortex well this this maybe how the
brain does like symbolization and

6920
02:22:10,429 --> 02:22:10,439
brain does like symbolization and
 

6921
02:22:10,439 --> 02:22:12,790
brain does like symbolization and
abstraction as in in functional

6922
02:22:12,790 --> 02:22:12,800
abstraction as in in functional
 

6923
02:22:12,800 --> 02:22:14,790
abstraction as in in functional
programming or something but we can't

6924
02:22:14,790 --> 02:22:14,800
programming or something but we can't
 

6925
02:22:14,800 --> 02:22:16,389
programming or something but we can't
measure it like we we we don't have

6926
02:22:16,389 --> 02:22:16,399
measure it like we we we don't have
 

6927
02:22:16,399 --> 02:22:18,670
measure it like we we we don't have
enough electrodes stuck between the the

6928
02:22:18,670 --> 02:22:18,680
enough electrodes stuck between the the
 

6929
02:22:18,680 --> 02:22:20,990
enough electrodes stuck between the the
cortex and the and the hippoc campus and

6930
02:22:20,990 --> 02:22:21,000
cortex and the and the hippoc campus and
 

6931
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,349
cortex and the and the hippoc campus and
any known experiment to measure it so I

6932
02:22:23,349 --> 02:22:23,359
any known experiment to measure it so I
 

6933
02:22:23,359 --> 02:22:26,270
any known experiment to measure it so I
got I got frustrated with that direction

6934
02:22:26,270 --> 02:22:26,280
got I got frustrated with that direction
 

6935
02:22:26,280 --> 02:22:27,790
got I got frustrated with that direction
not cuz it's impossible because we just

6936
02:22:27,790 --> 02:22:27,800
not cuz it's impossible because we just
 

6937
02:22:27,800 --> 02:22:29,830
not cuz it's impossible because we just
don't understand enough yet we don't of

6938
02:22:29,830 --> 02:22:29,840
don't understand enough yet we don't of
 

6939
02:22:29,840 --> 02:22:31,590
don't understand enough yet we don't of
course it's a valid research direction

6940
02:22:31,590 --> 02:22:31,600
course it's a valid research direction
 

6941
02:22:31,600 --> 02:22:33,070
course it's a valid research direction
and you can try to understand more and

6942
02:22:33,070 --> 02:22:33,080
and you can try to understand more and
 

6943
02:22:33,080 --> 02:22:34,910
and you can try to understand more and
more and we are measuring more and more

6944
02:22:34,910 --> 02:22:34,920
more and we are measuring more and more
 

6945
02:22:34,920 --> 02:22:36,990
more and we are measuring more and more
about what what happens in the brain now

6946
02:22:36,990 --> 02:22:37,000
about what what happens in the brain now
 

6947
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,469
about what what happens in the brain now
than ever before so it's it's quite

6948
02:22:39,469 --> 02:22:39,479
than ever before so it's it's quite
 

6949
02:22:39,479 --> 02:22:42,870
than ever before so it's it's quite
interesting on the other hand I sort of

6950
02:22:42,870 --> 02:22:42,880
interesting on the other hand I sort of
 

6951
02:22:42,880 --> 02:22:45,870
interesting on the other hand I sort of
got more of an engineering mindset about

6952
02:22:45,870 --> 02:22:45,880
got more of an engineering mindset about
 

6953
02:22:45,880 --> 02:22:48,270
got more of an engineering mindset about
AGI I'm like well okay we don't know how

6954
02:22:48,270 --> 02:22:48,280
AGI I'm like well okay we don't know how
 

6955
02:22:48,280 --> 02:22:50,630
AGI I'm like well okay we don't know how
the brain works that well we don't know

6956
02:22:50,630 --> 02:22:50,640
the brain works that well we don't know
 

6957
02:22:50,640 --> 02:22:52,389
the brain works that well we don't know
birds fly that well yet yet either we

6958
02:22:52,389 --> 02:22:52,399
birds fly that well yet yet either we
 

6959
02:22:52,399 --> 02:22:54,110
birds fly that well yet yet either we
have no idea how a hummingbird flies in

6960
02:22:54,110 --> 02:22:54,120
have no idea how a hummingbird flies in
 

6961
02:22:54,120 --> 02:22:56,349
have no idea how a hummingbird flies in
terms of the the aerodynamics of it on

6962
02:22:56,349 --> 02:22:56,359
terms of the the aerodynamics of it on
 

6963
02:22:56,359 --> 02:22:59,150
terms of the the aerodynamics of it on
the other hand we know basic principles

6964
02:22:59,150 --> 02:22:59,160
the other hand we know basic principles
 

6965
02:22:59,160 --> 02:23:01,070
the other hand we know basic principles
of like flapping and and and pushing the

6966
02:23:01,070 --> 02:23:01,080
of like flapping and and and pushing the
 

6967
02:23:01,080 --> 02:23:02,990
of like flapping and and and pushing the
air down and we know the basic

6968
02:23:02,990 --> 02:23:03,000
air down and we know the basic
 

6969
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:04,309
air down and we know the basic
principles of how the different parts of

6970
02:23:04,309 --> 02:23:04,319
principles of how the different parts of
 

6971
02:23:04,319 --> 02:23:06,870
principles of how the different parts of
the brain work so let's take those basic

6972
02:23:06,870 --> 02:23:06,880
the brain work so let's take those basic
 

6973
02:23:06,880 --> 02:23:09,190
the brain work so let's take those basic
principles and engineer something that

6974
02:23:09,190 --> 02:23:09,200
principles and engineer something that
 

6975
02:23:09,200 --> 02:23:12,030
principles and engineer something that
embodies those Bas basic principles but

6976
02:23:12,030 --> 02:23:12,040
embodies those Bas basic principles but
 

6977
02:23:12,040 --> 02:23:13,510
embodies those Bas basic principles but
you know is welld designed for the

6978
02:23:13,510 --> 02:23:13,520
you know is welld designed for the
 

6979
02:23:13,520 --> 02:23:16,870
you know is welld designed for the
hardware that that we have on on hand

6980
02:23:16,870 --> 02:23:16,880
hardware that that we have on on hand
 

6981
02:23:16,880 --> 02:23:19,030
hardware that that we have on on hand
right right now so do you think we can

6982
02:23:19,030 --> 02:23:19,040
right right now so do you think we can
 

6983
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:21,830
right right now so do you think we can
create AGI before we understand how the

6984
02:23:21,830 --> 02:23:21,840
create AGI before we understand how the
 

6985
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:23,469
create AGI before we understand how the
brains I think I think that's probably

6986
02:23:23,469 --> 02:23:23,479
brains I think I think that's probably
 

6987
02:23:23,479 --> 02:23:25,910
brains I think I think that's probably
that's probably what will happen and

6988
02:23:25,910 --> 02:23:25,920
that's probably what will happen and
 

6989
02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:27,790
that's probably what will happen and
maybe the AGI will help us do better

6990
02:23:27,790 --> 02:23:27,800
maybe the AGI will help us do better
 

6991
02:23:27,800 --> 02:23:29,230
maybe the AGI will help us do better
brain Imaging that will then let us

6992
02:23:29,230 --> 02:23:29,240
brain Imaging that will then let us
 

6993
02:23:29,240 --> 02:23:31,389
brain Imaging that will then let us
build artificial humans which is very

6994
02:23:31,389 --> 02:23:31,399
build artificial humans which is very
 

6995
02:23:31,399 --> 02:23:33,910
build artificial humans which is very
very interesting to us because we are

6996
02:23:33,910 --> 02:23:33,920
very interesting to us because we are
 

6997
02:23:33,920 --> 02:23:36,030
very interesting to us because we are
humans right I mean building artificial

6998
02:23:36,030 --> 02:23:36,040
humans right I mean building artificial
 

6999
02:23:36,040 --> 02:23:39,389
humans right I mean building artificial
humans is is super worthwhile I I just

7000
02:23:39,389 --> 02:23:39,399
humans is is super worthwhile I I just
 

7001
02:23:39,399 --> 02:23:41,389
humans is is super worthwhile I I just
think it's probably not the shortest

7002
02:23:41,389 --> 02:23:41,399
think it's probably not the shortest
 

7003
02:23:41,399 --> 02:23:44,469
think it's probably not the shortest
path to AGI so it's fascinating idea

7004
02:23:44,469 --> 02:23:44,479
path to AGI so it's fascinating idea
 

7005
02:23:44,479 --> 02:23:46,349
path to AGI so it's fascinating idea
that we would build AGI to help us

7006
02:23:46,349 --> 02:23:46,359
that we would build AGI to help us
 

7007
02:23:46,359 --> 02:23:50,150
that we would build AGI to help us
understand ourselves uh you know a lot

7008
02:23:50,150 --> 02:23:50,160
understand ourselves uh you know a lot
 

7009
02:23:50,160 --> 02:23:53,510
understand ourselves uh you know a lot
of people ask me if uh you know the

7010
02:23:53,510 --> 02:23:53,520
of people ask me if uh you know the
 

7011
02:23:53,520 --> 02:23:55,469
of people ask me if uh you know the
young people interested in doing

7012
02:23:55,469 --> 02:23:55,479
young people interested in doing
 

7013
02:23:55,479 --> 02:23:56,950
young people interested in doing
artificial intelligence they look at

7014
02:23:56,950 --> 02:23:56,960
artificial intelligence they look at
 

7015
02:23:56,960 --> 02:24:00,790
artificial intelligence they look at
sort of uh you know doing graduate level

7016
02:24:00,790 --> 02:24:00,800
sort of uh you know doing graduate level
 

7017
02:24:00,800 --> 02:24:02,910
sort of uh you know doing graduate level
even undergrads but graduate level

7018
02:24:02,910 --> 02:24:02,920
even undergrads but graduate level
 

7019
02:24:02,920 --> 02:24:05,590
even undergrads but graduate level
research uh they see what the artificial

7020
02:24:05,590 --> 02:24:05,600
research uh they see what the artificial
 

7021
02:24:05,600 --> 02:24:07,150
research uh they see what the artificial
intelligence Community stands now it's

7022
02:24:07,150 --> 02:24:07,160
intelligence Community stands now it's
 

7023
02:24:07,160 --> 02:24:09,150
intelligence Community stands now it's
not really AGI type research for the

7024
02:24:09,150 --> 02:24:09,160
not really AGI type research for the
 

7025
02:24:09,160 --> 02:24:11,510
not really AGI type research for the
most part yeah so the the natural

7026
02:24:11,510 --> 02:24:11,520
most part yeah so the the natural
 

7027
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:12,950
most part yeah so the the natural
question they ask is what advice would

7028
02:24:12,950 --> 02:24:12,960
question they ask is what advice would
 

7029
02:24:12,960 --> 02:24:16,510
question they ask is what advice would
you give I mean maybe I could ask uh if

7030
02:24:16,510 --> 02:24:16,520
you give I mean maybe I could ask uh if
 

7031
02:24:16,520 --> 02:24:18,630
you give I mean maybe I could ask uh if
people were interested in working on uh

7032
02:24:18,630 --> 02:24:18,640
people were interested in working on uh
 

7033
02:24:18,640 --> 02:24:22,710
people were interested in working on uh
open Cog or in some kind of direct or

interesting research I mean we're
 

7065
02:25:01,640 --> 02:25:04,550
interesting research I mean we're
working on on data analysis for covid

7066
02:25:04,550 --> 02:25:04,560
working on on data analysis for covid

7071
02:25:07,520 --> 02:25:09,429
Hansen robotics we're doing a lot of
cool things with the current version of

7072
02:25:09,429 --> 02:25:09,439
cool things with the current version of
 

7073
02:25:09,439 --> 02:25:11,670
cool things with the current version of
of of opencog now so there there's

7074
02:25:11,670 --> 02:25:11,680
of of opencog now so there there's
 

7075
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:13,750
of of opencog now so there there's
certainly opportunity to jump into

7076
02:25:13,750 --> 02:25:13,760
certainly opportunity to jump into
 

7077
02:25:13,760 --> 02:25:16,550
certainly opportunity to jump into

a AGI oriented projects so would you say

7080
02:25:19,269 --> 02:25:19,279
a AGI oriented projects so would you say
 

7081
02:25:19,279 --> 02:25:21,590
a AGI oriented projects so would you say
there's like Masters and phg thesises in

7082
02:25:21,590 --> 02:25:21,600
there's like Masters and phg thesises in
 

7083
02:25:21,600 --> 02:25:23,990
there's like Masters and phg thesises in
there plenty yeah plenty of of course I

7084

mean the challenge is to find a

7086
02:25:26,230 --> 02:25:26,240
mean the challenge is to find a
 

7087
02:25:26,240 --> 02:25:28,309
mean the challenge is to find a
supervisor who wants to Foster that that

7088
02:25:28,309 --> 02:25:28,319
supervisor who wants to Foster that that
 

7089
02:25:28,319 --> 02:25:30,150
supervisor who wants to Foster that that
that sort of research but it's way

7090
02:25:30,150 --> 02:25:30,160
that sort of research but it's way
 

7091
02:25:30,160 --> 02:25:32,190
that sort of research but it's way
easier than it was when I got my PhD

7092
02:25:32,190 --> 02:25:32,200
easier than it was when I got my PhD
 

7093
02:25:32,200 --> 02:25:34,230
easier than it was when I got my PhD
right so okay great we talked about open

7094
02:25:34,230 --> 02:25:34,240
right so okay great we talked about open
 

7095
02:25:34,240 --> 02:25:37,309
right so okay great we talked about open
Cog which is kind of uh one the software

7096
02:25:37,309 --> 02:25:37,319
Cog which is kind of uh one the software
 

7097
02:25:37,319 --> 02:25:41,309
Cog which is kind of uh one the software
framework but also the actual uh attempt

7098
02:25:41,309 --> 02:25:41,319
framework but also the actual uh attempt
 

7099
02:25:41,319 --> 02:25:45,269
framework but also the actual uh attempt
to build an AGI system and then there is

7100
02:25:45,269 --> 02:25:45,279
to build an AGI system and then there is
 

7101
02:25:45,279 --> 02:25:48,870
to build an AGI system and then there is
this exciting idea of Singularity net so

7102
02:25:48,870 --> 02:25:48,880
this exciting idea of Singularity net so
 

7103
02:25:48,880 --> 02:25:50,750
this exciting idea of Singularity net so
maybe can you

7104
02:25:50,750 --> 02:25:50,760
maybe can you
 

7105
02:25:50,760 --> 02:25:53,469
maybe can you
say first what is singularity net sure

7106
02:25:53,469 --> 02:25:53,479
say first what is singularity net sure
 

7107
02:25:53,479 --> 02:26:00,550
say first what is singularity net sure
sure Singularity net is a platform

7108
02:26:00,550 --> 02:26:00,560
sure Singularity net is a platform
 

7109
02:26:00,560 --> 02:26:04,070
sure Singularity net is a platform

so Marvin Minsky the AI Pioneer who who

7116
02:26:12,950 --> 02:26:12,960
so Marvin Minsky the AI Pioneer who who
 

7117
02:26:12,960 --> 02:26:15,429
so Marvin Minsky the AI Pioneer who who
I knew a little bit he had the idea of a

7118
02:26:15,429 --> 02:26:15,439
I knew a little bit he had the idea of a
 

7119

society of Minds like you should achieve

7120
02:26:17,269 --> 02:26:17,279
society of Minds like you should achieve
 

7121
02:26:17,279 --> 02:26:19,670
society of Minds like you should achieve
an AI not by writing one algorithm or

7122
02:26:19,670 --> 02:26:19,680
an AI not by writing one algorithm or
 

7123
02:26:19,680 --> 02:26:20,950
an AI not by writing one algorithm or
one program

7124
02:26:20,950 --> 02:26:20,960
one program
 

7125
02:26:20,960 --> 02:26:22,550
one program
but you should put a bunch of different

7126
02:26:22,550 --> 02:26:22,560
but you should put a bunch of different
 

7127
02:26:22,560 --> 02:26:26,830
but you should put a bunch of different
AIS out there and the different AIS will

7128
02:26:26,830 --> 02:26:26,840
AIS out there and the different AIS will
 

7129
02:26:26,840 --> 02:26:28,269
AIS out there and the different AIS will
interact with each other each playing

7130
02:26:28,269 --> 02:26:28,279
interact with each other each playing
 

7131
02:26:28,279 --> 02:26:31,110
interact with each other each playing
their own role and then the totality of

7132
02:26:31,110 --> 02:26:31,120
their own role and then the totality of
 

7133
02:26:31,120 --> 02:26:33,950
their own role and then the totality of
the Society of AIS would would be the

7134
02:26:33,950 --> 02:26:33,960
the Society of AIS would would be the
 

7135
02:26:33,960 --> 02:26:35,790
the Society of AIS would would be the
thing that displayed the human level

7136
02:26:35,790 --> 02:26:35,800
thing that displayed the human level
 

7137

intelligence and I had when he was alive

7138
02:26:38,950 --> 02:26:38,960
intelligence and I had when he was alive
 

7139
02:26:38,960 --> 02:26:40,950
intelligence and I had when he was alive
I had many debates with with Marvin

7140
02:26:40,950 --> 02:26:40,960
I had many debates with with Marvin
 

7141
02:26:40,960 --> 02:26:44,590
I had many debates with with Marvin
about about this idea and

7142
02:26:44,590 --> 02:26:44,600
about about this idea and
 

7143
02:26:44,600 --> 02:26:46,950
about about this idea and
he I think

7144
02:26:46,950 --> 02:26:46,960
he I think
 

7145
02:26:46,960 --> 02:26:49,389
he I think
uh he really thought the mind was more

7146
02:26:49,389 --> 02:26:49,399
uh he really thought the mind was more
 

7147
02:26:49,399 --> 02:26:52,030
uh he really thought the mind was more
like a society than than I do like I

7148
02:26:52,030 --> 02:26:52,040
like a society than than I do like I
 

7149
02:26:52,040 --> 02:26:54,030
like a society than than I do like I
think I think you could have a a mind

7150
02:26:54,030 --> 02:26:54,040
think I think you could have a a mind
 

7151
02:26:54,040 --> 02:26:55,750
think I think you could have a a mind
that was as disorganized as a human

7152
02:26:55,750 --> 02:26:55,760
that was as disorganized as a human
 

7153
02:26:55,760 --> 02:26:57,950
that was as disorganized as a human
society but I think a humanlike mind has

7154
02:26:57,950 --> 02:26:57,960
society but I think a humanlike mind has
 

7155
02:26:57,960 --> 02:26:59,710
society but I think a humanlike mind has
a bit more central control than that

7156
02:26:59,710 --> 02:26:59,720
a bit more central control than that
 

7157
02:26:59,720 --> 02:27:02,070
a bit more central control than that
actually like I mean we have this

7158
02:27:02,070 --> 02:27:02,080
actually like I mean we have this
 

7159
02:27:02,080 --> 02:27:04,790
actually like I mean we have this
Thalamus and the medulla and lyic system

7160
02:27:04,790 --> 02:27:04,800
Thalamus and the medulla and lyic system
 

7161
02:27:04,800 --> 02:27:07,550
Thalamus and the medulla and lyic system
we we have a sort of top- down control

7162
02:27:07,550 --> 02:27:07,560
we we have a sort of top- down control
 

7163
02:27:07,560 --> 02:27:09,830
we we have a sort of top- down control
system that guides much of much of what

7164
02:27:09,830 --> 02:27:09,840
system that guides much of much of what
 

7165
02:27:09,840 --> 02:27:12,790
system that guides much of much of what
we do more so than than a society does

7166
02:27:12,790 --> 02:27:12,800
we do more so than than a society does
 

7167
02:27:12,800 --> 02:27:15,670
we do more so than than a society does
so I think he stretched that metaphor a

7168
02:27:15,670 --> 02:27:15,680
so I think he stretched that metaphor a
 

7169
02:27:15,680 --> 02:27:18,710
so I think he stretched that metaphor a
little too far but I but I also think

7170
02:27:18,710 --> 02:27:18,720
little too far but I but I also think
 

7171
02:27:18,720 --> 02:27:20,349
little too far but I but I also think
there's there's something interesting

7172
02:27:20,349 --> 02:27:20,359
there's there's something interesting
 

7173
02:27:20,359 --> 02:27:24,230
there's there's something interesting
there and so in the in the '90s when I

7174
02:27:24,230 --> 02:27:24,240
there and so in the in the '90s when I
 

7175
02:27:24,240 --> 02:27:27,230
there and so in the in the '90s when I
started my first sort of non-academic AI

7176
02:27:27,230 --> 02:27:27,240
started my first sort of non-academic AI
 

7177
02:27:27,240 --> 02:27:29,670
started my first sort of non-academic AI
project web mind which was an AI startup

7178
02:27:29,670 --> 02:27:29,680
project web mind which was an AI startup
 

7179
02:27:29,680 --> 02:27:32,830
project web mind which was an AI startup
in New York in the Silicon alley area in

7180
02:27:32,830 --> 02:27:32,840
in New York in the Silicon alley area in
 

7181
02:27:32,840 --> 02:27:35,590
in New York in the Silicon alley area in
in the late 90s what I was aiming to do

7182
02:27:35,590 --> 02:27:35,600
in the late 90s what I was aiming to do
 

7183
02:27:35,600 --> 02:27:38,950
in the late 90s what I was aiming to do
there was make a distributed Society of

7184
02:27:38,950 --> 02:27:38,960
there was make a distributed Society of
 

7185
02:27:38,960 --> 02:27:41,030
there was make a distributed Society of
AIS the different parts of which would

7186
02:27:41,030 --> 02:27:41,040
AIS the different parts of which would
 

7187
02:27:41,040 --> 02:27:42,550
AIS the different parts of which would
live on different computers all around

7188
02:27:42,550 --> 02:27:42,560
live on different computers all around
 

7189
02:27:42,560 --> 02:27:44,790
live on different computers all around
the world and each one would do its own

7190
02:27:44,790 --> 02:27:44,800
the world and each one would do its own
 

7191
02:27:44,800 --> 02:27:47,070
the world and each one would do its own
thinking about the data local to it but

7192
02:27:47,070 --> 02:27:47,080
thinking about the data local to it but
 

7193
02:27:47,080 --> 02:27:48,510
thinking about the data local to it but
they would all share information with

7194
02:27:48,510 --> 02:27:48,520
they would all share information with
 

7195
02:27:48,520 --> 02:27:49,790
they would all share information with
each other and Outsource work with each

7196
02:27:49,790 --> 02:27:49,800
each other and Outsource work with each
 

7197
02:27:49,800 --> 02:27:52,110
each other and Outsource work with each
other and cooperate and the intelligence

7198
02:27:52,110 --> 02:27:52,120
other and cooperate and the intelligence
 

7199
02:27:52,120 --> 02:27:53,990
other and cooperate and the intelligence
would be in in in the whole Collective

7200
02:27:53,990 --> 02:27:54,000
would be in in in the whole Collective
 

7201
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,550
would be in in in the whole Collective
and I organized a conference together

7202
02:27:56,550 --> 02:27:56,560
and I organized a conference together
 

7203
02:27:56,560 --> 02:27:58,510
and I organized a conference together
with Francis hean at free University of

7204
02:27:58,510 --> 02:27:58,520
with Francis hean at free University of
 

7205
02:27:58,520 --> 02:28:01,469
with Francis hean at free University of
Brussels in 2001 which was the global

7206
02:28:01,469 --> 02:28:01,479
Brussels in 2001 which was the global
 

7207
02:28:01,479 --> 02:28:03,550
Brussels in 2001 which was the global
brain zero conference and we're we're

7208
02:28:03,550 --> 02:28:03,560
brain zero conference and we're we're
 

7209
02:28:03,560 --> 02:28:04,950
brain zero conference and we're we're
planning the next version of the global

7210
02:28:04,950 --> 02:28:04,960
planning the next version of the global
 

7211
02:28:04,960 --> 02:28:07,349
planning the next version of the global
brain one conference at the Free

02:28:07,349 --> 02:28:07,359
brain one conference at the Free
 

7213
02:28:07,359 --> 02:28:08,990
brain one conference at the Free
University of Brussels for next year

7214
02:28:08,990 --> 02:28:09,000
University of Brussels for next year
 

7215
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:12,710
University of Brussels for next year
2021 so 20 20 years after then we maybe

7216
02:28:12,710 --> 02:28:12,720
2021 so 20 20 years after then we maybe
 

7217
02:28:12,720 --> 02:28:14,269
2021 so 20 20 years after then we maybe
we can have the next one 10 years after

7218
02:28:14,269 --> 02:28:14,279
we can have the next one 10 years after
 

7219
02:28:14,279 --> 02:28:17,070
we can have the next one 10 years after
that like exponentially faster until the

7220
02:28:17,070 --> 02:28:17,080
that like exponentially faster until the
 

7221
02:28:17,080 --> 02:28:19,870
that like exponentially faster until the
singularity comes right uh the timing is

7222
02:28:19,870 --> 02:28:19,880
singularity comes right uh the timing is
 

7223
02:28:19,880 --> 02:28:22,790
singularity comes right uh the timing is
right yeah yeah yeah exactly so the yeah

7224
02:28:22,790 --> 02:28:22,800
right yeah yeah yeah exactly so the yeah
 

7225
02:28:22,800 --> 02:28:25,230
right yeah yeah yeah exactly so the yeah
the idea with the global brain was you

7226
02:28:25,230 --> 02:28:25,240
the idea with the global brain was you
 

7227
02:28:25,240 --> 02:28:27,670
the idea with the global brain was you
know maybe the AI won't just be in a

7228
02:28:27,670 --> 02:28:27,680
know maybe the AI won't just be in a
 

7229
02:28:27,680 --> 02:28:30,150
know maybe the AI won't just be in a
program on one guy's computer but the AI

7230
02:28:30,150 --> 02:28:30,160
program on one guy's computer but the AI
 

7231
02:28:30,160 --> 02:28:32,590
program on one guy's computer but the AI
will be you know in the internet as a

7232
02:28:32,590 --> 02:28:32,600
will be you know in the internet as a
 

7233
02:28:32,600 --> 02:28:34,110
will be you know in the internet as a
whole with the cooperation of different

7234
02:28:34,110 --> 02:28:34,120
whole with the cooperation of different
 

7235
02:28:34,120 --> 02:28:37,910
whole with the cooperation of different
AI modules living in different places so

7236
02:28:37,910 --> 02:28:37,920
AI modules living in different places so
 

7237
02:28:37,920 --> 02:28:39,309
AI modules living in different places so
one of the issues you face when

7238
02:28:39,309 --> 02:28:39,319
one of the issues you face when
 

7239
02:28:39,319 --> 02:28:43,429
one of the issues you face when
architecting a system like that is you

7240
02:28:43,429 --> 02:28:43,439
architecting a system like that is you
 

7241
02:28:43,439 --> 02:28:45,070
architecting a system like that is you
know how how is the whole thing

7242
02:28:45,070 --> 02:28:45,080
know how how is the whole thing
 

7243
02:28:45,080 --> 02:28:46,190
know how how is the whole thing
controlled do you have like a

7244
02:28:46,190 --> 02:28:46,200
controlled do you have like a
 

7245
02:28:46,200 --> 02:28:48,710
controlled do you have like a
centralized control unit that pulls the

7246
02:28:48,710 --> 02:28:48,720
centralized control unit that pulls the
 

7247
02:28:48,720 --> 02:28:50,389
centralized control unit that pulls the
puppet strings of all the different

7248
02:28:50,389 --> 02:28:50,399
puppet strings of all the different
 

7249
02:28:50,399 --> 02:28:53,469
puppet strings of all the different
modules there or do you have a

7250
02:28:53,469 --> 02:28:53,479
modules there or do you have a
 

7251
02:28:53,479 --> 02:28:56,309
modules there or do you have a
fundamentally decentralized Network

7252
02:28:56,309 --> 02:28:56,319
fundamentally decentralized Network
 

7253
02:28:56,319 --> 02:28:59,590
fundamentally decentralized Network
where the Society of of AIS is

7254
02:28:59,590 --> 02:28:59,600
where the Society of of AIS is
 

7255
02:28:59,600 --> 02:29:01,190
where the Society of of AIS is
controlled in some democratic and

7256
02:29:01,190 --> 02:29:01,200
controlled in some democratic and
 

7257
02:29:01,200 --> 02:29:03,910
controlled in some democratic and
self-organized Way by all the AIS in in

7258
02:29:03,910 --> 02:29:03,920
self-organized Way by all the AIS in in
 

7259
02:29:03,920 --> 02:29:07,550
self-organized Way by all the AIS in in
that Society right and Francis and I had

7260
02:29:07,550 --> 02:29:07,560
that Society right and Francis and I had
 

7261
02:29:07,560 --> 02:29:09,910
that Society right and Francis and I had
different view of many things but we

7262
02:29:09,910 --> 02:29:09,920
different view of many things but we
 

7263
02:29:09,920 --> 02:29:12,590
different view of many things but we
both we both wanted to make like a

7264
02:29:12,590 --> 02:29:12,600
both we both wanted to make like a
 

7265
02:29:12,600 --> 02:29:17,830
both we both wanted to make like a
global Society of AI Minds with a

7266
02:29:17,830 --> 02:29:17,840
global Society of AI Minds with a
 

7267
02:29:17,840 --> 02:29:20,590
global Society of AI Minds with a
decentralized or organ organization mode

7268
02:29:20,590 --> 02:29:20,600
decentralized or organ organization mode
 

7269
02:29:20,600 --> 02:29:23,309
decentralized or organ organization mode
now the main difference was he wanted

7270
02:29:23,309 --> 02:29:23,319
now the main difference was he wanted
 

7271
02:29:23,319 --> 02:29:27,269
now the main difference was he wanted
the individual AIS to be all incredibly

7272
02:29:27,269 --> 02:29:27,279
the individual AIS to be all incredibly
 

7273
02:29:27,279 --> 02:29:29,510
the individual AIS to be all incredibly
simple and all the intelligence to be on

7274
02:29:29,510 --> 02:29:29,520
simple and all the intelligence to be on
 

7275
02:29:29,520 --> 02:29:32,910
simple and all the intelligence to be on
the collective level whereas I thought

7276
02:29:32,910 --> 02:29:32,920
the collective level whereas I thought
 

7277
02:29:32,920 --> 02:29:34,510
the collective level whereas I thought
that was cool but I thought a more

7278
02:29:34,510 --> 02:29:34,520
that was cool but I thought a more
 

7279
02:29:34,520 --> 02:29:36,950
that was cool but I thought a more
practical way to do it might be if some

7280
02:29:36,950 --> 02:29:36,960
practical way to do it might be if some
 

7281
02:29:36,960 --> 02:29:39,389
practical way to do it might be if some
of the agents in the Society of Minds

7282
02:29:39,389 --> 02:29:39,399
of the agents in the Society of Minds
 

7283
02:29:39,399 --> 02:29:41,030
of the agents in the Society of Minds
were fairly generally intelligent on

7284
02:29:41,030 --> 02:29:41,040
were fairly generally intelligent on
 

7285
02:29:41,040 --> 02:29:42,349
were fairly generally intelligent on
their own so like you could have a bunch

7286
02:29:42,349 --> 02:29:42,359
their own so like you could have a bunch
 

7287
02:29:42,359 --> 02:29:45,230
their own so like you could have a bunch
of open cogs out there and a bunch of

7288
02:29:45,230 --> 02:29:45,240
of open cogs out there and a bunch of
 

7289
02:29:45,240 --> 02:29:47,590
of open cogs out there and a bunch of
simpler learning systems and then these

7290
02:29:47,590 --> 02:29:47,600
simpler learning systems and then these
 

7291
02:29:47,600 --> 02:29:49,590
simpler learning systems and then these
are are all cooperating and coordinating

7292
02:29:49,590 --> 02:29:49,600
are are all cooperating and coordinating
 

7293
02:29:49,600 --> 02:29:51,990
are are all cooperating and coordinating
together soort of like in the brain okay

7294
02:29:51,990 --> 02:29:52,000
together soort of like in the brain okay
 

7295
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,269
together soort of like in the brain okay
the brain as a whole is the general

7296
02:29:54,269 --> 02:29:54,279
the brain as a whole is the general
 

7297
02:29:54,279 --> 02:29:56,070
the brain as a whole is the general
intelligence but some parts of the

7298
02:29:56,070 --> 02:29:56,080
intelligence but some parts of the
 

7299
02:29:56,080 --> 02:29:57,670
intelligence but some parts of the
cortex you could say have a fair rid of

7300
02:29:57,670 --> 02:29:57,680
cortex you could say have a fair rid of
 

7301
02:29:57,680 --> 02:29:59,630
cortex you could say have a fair rid of
general intelligence on their own

7302
02:29:59,630 --> 02:29:59,640
general intelligence on their own
 

7303
02:29:59,640 --> 02:30:01,309
general intelligence on their own
whereas say parts of the cerebellum or

7304
02:30:01,309 --> 02:30:01,319
whereas say parts of the cerebellum or
 

7305
02:30:01,319 --> 02:30:03,030
whereas say parts of the cerebellum or
lyic system have very little general

7306
02:30:03,030 --> 02:30:03,040
lyic system have very little general
 

7307
02:30:03,040 --> 02:30:04,790
lyic system have very little general
intelligence on their own and they're

7308
02:30:04,790 --> 02:30:04,800
intelligence on their own and they're
 

7309
02:30:04,800 --> 02:30:07,070
intelligence on their own and they're
contributing to general intelligence you

7310
02:30:07,070 --> 02:30:07,080
contributing to general intelligence you
 

7311
02:30:07,080 --> 02:30:08,830
contributing to general intelligence you
know by way of their connectivity to to

7312
02:30:08,830 --> 02:30:08,840
know by way of their connectivity to to
 

7313
02:30:08,840 --> 02:30:11,190
know by way of their connectivity to to
other other modules do you see

7314
02:30:11,190 --> 02:30:11,200
other other modules do you see
 

7315
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:13,469
other other modules do you see
instantiations of the same kind of you

7316
02:30:13,469 --> 02:30:13,479
instantiations of the same kind of you
 

7317
02:30:13,479 --> 02:30:15,070
instantiations of the same kind of you
know maybe different versions of open

7318
02:30:15,070 --> 02:30:15,080
know maybe different versions of open
 

7319
02:30:15,080 --> 02:30:16,750
know maybe different versions of open
Cog but also just the same version of

7320
02:30:16,750 --> 02:30:16,760
Cog but also just the same version of
 

7321
02:30:16,760 --> 02:30:19,710
Cog but also just the same version of
open Cog and maybe many instantiations

7322
02:30:19,710 --> 02:30:19,720
open Cog and maybe many instantiations
 

7323
02:30:19,720 --> 02:30:22,469
open Cog and maybe many instantiations
of it as part as that's what David and H

7324
02:30:22,469 --> 02:30:22,479
of it as part as that's what David and H
 

7325
02:30:22,479 --> 02:30:23,990
of it as part as that's what David and H
and I want to do with many Sophia and

7326
02:30:23,990 --> 02:30:24,000
and I want to do with many Sophia and
 

7327
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,150
and I want to do with many Sophia and
other robots yeah yeah each one has its

7328
02:30:26,150 --> 02:30:26,160
other robots yeah yeah each one has its
 

7329
02:30:26,160 --> 02:30:29,110
other robots yeah yeah each one has its
own individual mind living on the server

7330
02:30:29,110 --> 02:30:29,120
own individual mind living on the server
 

7331
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:30,389
own individual mind living on the server
but there's also a collective

7332
02:30:30,389 --> 02:30:30,399
but there's also a collective
 

7333
02:30:30,399 --> 02:30:32,510
but there's also a collective
intelligence infusing them and a part of

7334
02:30:32,510 --> 02:30:32,520
intelligence infusing them and a part of
 

7335
02:30:32,520 --> 02:30:33,830
intelligence infusing them and a part of
the mind living on the edge in each

7336
02:30:33,830 --> 02:30:33,840
the mind living on the edge in each
 

7337
02:30:33,840 --> 02:30:37,590
the mind living on the edge in each
robot right yeah so so the the thing is

7338
02:30:37,590 --> 02:30:37,600
robot right yeah so so the the thing is
 

7339
02:30:37,600 --> 02:30:39,910
robot right yeah so so the the thing is
at that time as well as webmind being

7340
02:30:39,910 --> 02:30:39,920
at that time as well as webmind being
 

7341
02:30:39,920 --> 02:30:42,429
at that time as well as webmind being
implemented in Java 1.1 as like a

7342
02:30:42,429 --> 02:30:42,439
implemented in Java 1.1 as like a
 

7343
02:30:42,439 --> 02:30:45,910
implemented in Java 1.1 as like a
massive distributed system yeah that you

7344
02:30:45,910 --> 02:30:45,920
massive distributed system yeah that you
 

7345
02:30:45,920 --> 02:30:47,910
massive distributed system yeah that you
know the there blockchain wasn't there

7346
02:30:47,910 --> 02:30:47,920
know the there blockchain wasn't there
 

7347
02:30:47,920 --> 02:30:49,230
know the there blockchain wasn't there
yet so how how them do this

7348
02:30:49,230 --> 02:30:49,240
yet so how how them do this
 

7349
02:30:49,240 --> 02:30:50,469
yet so how how them do this
decentralized

7350
02:30:50,469 --> 02:30:50,479
decentralized
 

7351
02:30:50,479 --> 02:30:52,910
decentralized
control you know we sort of knew it we

7352
02:30:52,910 --> 02:30:52,920
control you know we sort of knew it we
 

7353
02:30:52,920 --> 02:30:54,590
control you know we sort of knew it we
knew about distributed systems we knew

7354
02:30:54,590 --> 02:30:54,600
knew about distributed systems we knew
 

7355
02:30:54,600 --> 02:30:57,230
knew about distributed systems we knew
about encryption so I mean we had the

7356
02:30:57,230 --> 02:30:57,240
about encryption so I mean we had the
 

7357
02:30:57,240 --> 02:30:58,790
about encryption so I mean we had the
key principles of what underlies

7358
02:30:58,790 --> 02:30:58,800
key principles of what underlies
 

7359
02:30:58,800 --> 02:31:01,190
key principles of what underlies
blockchain now but I mean we didn't put

7360
02:31:01,190 --> 02:31:01,200
blockchain now but I mean we didn't put
 

7361
02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:02,389
blockchain now but I mean we didn't put
it together in the way that's it's been

7362
02:31:02,389 --> 02:31:02,399
it together in the way that's it's been
 

7363
02:31:02,399 --> 02:31:04,750
it together in the way that's it's been
done now so when when vitalic butterin

7364
02:31:04,750 --> 02:31:04,760
done now so when when vitalic butterin
 

7365
02:31:04,760 --> 02:31:06,750
done now so when when vitalic butterin
and colleagues came out with aium

7366
02:31:06,750 --> 02:31:06,760
and colleagues came out with aium
 

7367
02:31:06,760 --> 02:31:08,990
and colleagues came out with aium
blockchain you know many many year years

7368
02:31:08,990 --> 02:31:09,000
blockchain you know many many year years
 

7369
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:12,230
blockchain you know many many year years
later like 2013 or something then I was

7370
02:31:12,230 --> 02:31:12,240
later like 2013 or something then I was
 

7371
02:31:12,240 --> 02:31:14,309
later like 2013 or something then I was
like well this is interesting like this

7372
02:31:14,309 --> 02:31:14,319
like well this is interesting like this
 

7373
02:31:14,319 --> 02:31:17,230
like well this is interesting like this
is solidity scripting language it's kind

7374
02:31:17,230 --> 02:31:17,240
is solidity scripting language it's kind
 

7375
02:31:17,240 --> 02:31:19,590
is solidity scripting language it's kind
of dorky in a way and I don't see why

7376
02:31:19,590 --> 02:31:19,600
of dorky in a way and I don't see why
 

7377
02:31:19,600 --> 02:31:21,590
of dorky in a way and I don't see why
you need a turn complete language for

7378
02:31:21,590 --> 02:31:21,600
you need a turn complete language for
 

7379
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:24,389
you need a turn complete language for
this purpose but on the other hand this

7380
02:31:24,389 --> 02:31:24,399
this purpose but on the other hand this
 

7381
02:31:24,399 --> 02:31:27,110
this purpose but on the other hand this
is like the first time I could sit down

7382
02:31:27,110 --> 02:31:27,120
is like the first time I could sit down
 

7383
02:31:27,120 --> 02:31:29,750
is like the first time I could sit down
and start to like script infrastructure

7384
02:31:29,750 --> 02:31:29,760
and start to like script infrastructure
 

7385
02:31:29,760 --> 02:31:32,469
and start to like script infrastructure
for decentralized control of the AIS in

7386
02:31:32,469 --> 02:31:32,479
for decentralized control of the AIS in
 

7387
02:31:32,479 --> 02:31:35,190
for decentralized control of the AIS in
a society of Minds in a tractable way

7388
02:31:35,190 --> 02:31:35,200
a society of Minds in a tractable way
 

7389
02:31:35,200 --> 02:31:37,230
a society of Minds in a tractable way
like you could hack the Bitcoin cbase

7390
02:31:37,230 --> 02:31:37,240
like you could hack the Bitcoin cbase
 

7391
02:31:37,240 --> 02:31:39,150
like you could hack the Bitcoin cbase
but it's it's really annoying whereas

7392
02:31:39,150 --> 02:31:39,160
but it's it's really annoying whereas
 

7393
02:31:39,160 --> 02:31:41,630
but it's it's really annoying whereas
sady is is ethereum scripting language

7394
02:31:41,630 --> 02:31:41,640
sady is is ethereum scripting language
 

7395
02:31:41,640 --> 02:31:44,429
sady is is ethereum scripting language
is just nicer and and easier to use I'm

7396
02:31:44,429 --> 02:31:44,439
is just nicer and and easier to use I'm
 

7397
02:31:44,439 --> 02:31:46,590
is just nicer and and easier to use I'm
very annoyed with it by this point but

7398
02:31:46,590 --> 02:31:46,600
very annoyed with it by this point but
 

7399
02:31:46,600 --> 02:31:48,349
very annoyed with it by this point but
like Java I mean these languages are

7400
02:31:48,349 --> 02:31:48,359
like Java I mean these languages are
 

7401
02:31:48,359 --> 02:31:51,150
like Java I mean these languages are
amazing when when they first come out so

7402
02:31:51,150 --> 02:31:51,160
amazing when when they first come out so
 

7403
02:31:51,160 --> 02:31:52,710
amazing when when they first come out so
then I came up with the idea that turned

7404
02:31:52,710 --> 02:31:52,720
then I came up with the idea that turned
 

7405
02:31:52,720 --> 02:31:55,030
then I came up with the idea that turned
into Singularity that okay let's let's

7406
02:31:55,030 --> 02:31:55,040
into Singularity that okay let's let's
 

7407
02:31:55,040 --> 02:31:58,309
into Singularity that okay let's let's
make a decentralized agent system where

7408
02:31:58,309 --> 02:31:58,319
make a decentralized agent system where
 

7409
02:31:58,319 --> 02:32:00,349
make a decentralized agent system where
a bunch of different AIS you know

7410
02:32:00,349 --> 02:32:00,359
a bunch of different AIS you know
 

7411
02:32:00,359 --> 02:32:01,910
a bunch of different AIS you know
wrapped up in say different Docker

7412
02:32:01,910 --> 02:32:01,920
wrapped up in say different Docker
 

7413
02:32:01,920 --> 02:32:04,870
wrapped up in say different Docker
containers or lxc containers different

7414
02:32:04,870 --> 02:32:04,880
containers or lxc containers different
 

7415
02:32:04,880 --> 02:32:06,910
containers or lxc containers different
AIS can each of them have their own

7416
02:32:06,910 --> 02:32:06,920
AIS can each of them have their own
 

7417
02:32:06,920 --> 02:32:08,990
AIS can each of them have their own
identity on the blockchain and the

7418
02:32:08,990 --> 02:32:09,000
identity on the blockchain and the
 

7419
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,750

has no Central controller no dictator

7422
02:32:13,790 --> 02:32:13,800
has no Central controller no dictator
 

7423
02:32:13,800 --> 02:32:15,950
has no Central controller no dictator
right the and there's no Central

7424
02:32:15,950 --> 02:32:15,960
right the and there's no Central
 

7425
02:32:15,960 --> 02:32:17,190

02:32:19,510 --> 02:32:19,520
coordination of the Society of Minds is
 

7429
02:32:19,520 --> 02:32:22,190
coordination of the Society of Minds is
done entirely by the decentralized

the by the algorithms right because you

7434
02:32:26,389 --> 02:32:26,399
the by the algorithms right because you
 

7435
02:32:26,399 --> 02:32:28,469
the by the algorithms right because you
know the model of Bitcoin is in math We

7436
02:32:28,469 --> 02:32:28,479
know the model of Bitcoin is in math We
 

7437
02:32:28,479 --> 02:32:30,389
know the model of Bitcoin is in math We
Trust right and so that that that's what

7438
02:32:30,389 --> 02:32:30,399
Trust right and so that that that's what
 

7439
02:32:30,399 --> 02:32:32,550
Trust right and so that that that's what
you need you need the Society of Minds

7440
02:32:32,550 --> 02:32:32,560
you need you need the Society of Minds
 

7441
02:32:32,560 --> 02:32:35,030
you need you need the Society of Minds
to trust only in math not trust only in

7442
02:32:35,030 --> 02:32:35,040
to trust only in math not trust only in
 

7443
02:32:35,040 --> 02:32:36,190
to trust only in math not trust only in
one one

7444
02:32:36,190 --> 02:32:36,200
one one
 

7445
02:32:36,200 --> 02:32:38,830
one one
centralized server so the AI systems

7446
02:32:38,830 --> 02:32:38,840
centralized server so the AI systems
 

7447
02:32:38,840 --> 02:32:40,670
centralized server so the AI systems
themselves are outside of the blockchain

7448
02:32:40,670 --> 02:32:40,680
themselves are outside of the blockchain
 

7449
02:32:40,680 --> 02:32:42,590
themselves are outside of the blockchain
but then the communication at the moment

7450
02:32:42,590 --> 02:32:42,600
but then the communication at the moment
 

7451
02:32:42,600 --> 02:32:44,910
but then the communication at the moment
yeah yeah we I would have loved to put

7452
02:32:44,910 --> 02:32:44,920
yeah yeah we I would have loved to put
 

7453
02:32:44,920 --> 02:32:47,750
yeah yeah we I would have loved to put
the ai's operations on chain in some

7454
02:32:47,750 --> 02:32:47,760
the ai's operations on chain in some
 

7455
02:32:47,760 --> 02:32:50,510
the ai's operations on chain in some
sense but in ethereum it's just too slow

7456
02:32:50,510 --> 02:32:50,520
sense but in ethereum it's just too slow
 

7457
02:32:50,520 --> 02:32:52,230
sense but in ethereum it's just too slow
you you you you you can't you can't do

7458
02:32:52,230 --> 02:32:52,240
you you you you you can't you can't do
 

7459
02:32:52,240 --> 02:32:55,030
you you you you you can't you can't do
it somehow it's the basic communication

7460
02:32:55,030 --> 02:32:55,040
it somehow it's the basic communication
 

7461
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:57,590
it somehow it's the basic communication
between AI systems that's uh yeah yeah

7462
02:32:57,590 --> 02:32:57,600
between AI systems that's uh yeah yeah
 

7463
02:32:57,600 --> 02:33:01,870
between AI systems that's uh yeah yeah
so basically an AI is just some software

7464
02:33:01,870 --> 02:33:01,880
so basically an AI is just some software
 

7465
02:33:01,880 --> 02:33:03,710
so basically an AI is just some software
in singular an AI is just some software

7466
02:33:03,710 --> 02:33:03,720
in singular an AI is just some software
 

7467
02:33:03,720 --> 02:33:06,469
in singular an AI is just some software
process living in a container M and

7468
02:33:06,469 --> 02:33:06,479
process living in a container M and
 

7469
02:33:06,479 --> 02:33:08,030
process living in a container M and
there's input and output there's a proxy

7470
02:33:08,030 --> 02:33:08,040
there's input and output there's a proxy
 

7471
02:33:08,040 --> 02:33:09,349
there's input and output there's a proxy
that lives in that container along with

7472
02:33:09,349 --> 02:33:09,359
that lives in that container along with
 

7473
02:33:09,359 --> 02:33:10,910
that lives in that container along with
the AI that handles the interaction with

7474
02:33:10,910 --> 02:33:10,920
the AI that handles the interaction with
 

7475
02:33:10,920 --> 02:33:13,349
the AI that handles the interaction with
the rest of of of Singularity net and

7476
02:33:13,349 --> 02:33:13,359
the rest of of of Singularity net and
 

7477
02:33:13,359 --> 02:33:15,830
the rest of of of Singularity net and
then when one AI wants to contribute

7478
02:33:15,830 --> 02:33:15,840
then when one AI wants to contribute
 

7479
02:33:15,840 --> 02:33:17,190
then when one AI wants to contribute
with another one in the network they set

7480
02:33:17,190 --> 02:33:17,200
with another one in the network they set
 

7481
02:33:17,200 --> 02:33:19,950
with another one in the network they set
up a number of channels and the setup

7482
02:33:19,950 --> 02:33:19,960
up a number of channels and the setup
 

7483
02:33:19,960 --> 02:33:21,590
up a number of channels and the setup
those channels uses the ethereum

7484
02:33:21,590 --> 02:33:21,600
those channels uses the ethereum
 

7485
02:33:21,600 --> 02:33:23,670
those channels uses the ethereum
blockchain but once the channels are set

7486
02:33:23,670 --> 02:33:23,680
blockchain but once the channels are set
 

7487
02:33:23,680 --> 02:33:26,150
blockchain but once the channels are set
up then data flows along those channels

7488
02:33:26,150 --> 02:33:26,160
up then data flows along those channels
 

7489
02:33:26,160 --> 02:33:28,030
up then data flows along those channels
without without having to be having to

7490
02:33:28,030 --> 02:33:28,040
without without having to be having to
 

7491
02:33:28,040 --> 02:33:29,790
without without having to be having to
be on the blockchain all that goes on

7492
02:33:29,790 --> 02:33:29,800
be on the blockchain all that goes on
 

7493
02:33:29,800 --> 02:33:31,349
be on the blockchain all that goes on
the blockchain is the fact that some

7494
02:33:31,349 --> 02:33:31,359
the blockchain is the fact that some
 

7495
02:33:31,359 --> 02:33:33,670
the blockchain is the fact that some
data went along that channel so you can

7496
02:33:33,670 --> 02:33:33,680
data went along that channel so you can
 

7497
02:33:33,680 --> 02:33:36,510
data went along that channel so you can
do so there's not a shared

7498
02:33:36,510 --> 02:33:36,520
do so there's not a shared
 

7499
02:33:36,520 --> 02:33:40,030
do so there's not a shared
knowledge uh it's well the the identity

7500
02:33:40,030 --> 02:33:40,040
knowledge uh it's well the the identity
 

7501
02:33:40,040 --> 02:33:43,030
knowledge uh it's well the the identity
of each agent is on the blockchain right

7502
02:33:43,030 --> 02:33:43,040
of each agent is on the blockchain right
 

7503
02:33:43,040 --> 02:33:45,429
of each agent is on the blockchain right
on the ethereum blockchain if one agent

7504
02:33:45,429 --> 02:33:45,439
on the ethereum blockchain if one agent
 

7505
02:33:45,439 --> 02:33:48,030
on the ethereum blockchain if one agent
rates the reputation of another agent

7506
02:33:48,030 --> 02:33:48,040
rates the reputation of another agent
 

7507
02:33:48,040 --> 02:33:50,070
rates the reputation of another agent
that goes on the blockchain and agents

7508
02:33:50,070 --> 02:33:50,080
that goes on the blockchain and agents
 

7509
02:33:50,080 --> 02:33:52,830
that goes on the blockchain and agents
can publish what apis they will fulfill

7510
02:33:52,830 --> 02:33:52,840
can publish what apis they will fulfill
 

7511
02:33:52,840 --> 02:33:55,910
can publish what apis they will fulfill
on the on the blockchain but the actual

7512
02:33:55,910 --> 02:33:55,920
on the on the blockchain but the actual
 

7513
02:33:55,920 --> 02:33:58,469
on the on the blockchain but the actual
data for AI and the results AI is not on

7514
02:33:58,469 --> 02:33:58,479
data for AI and the results AI is not on
 

7515
02:33:58,479 --> 02:33:59,710
data for AI and the results AI is not on
the blockch do you think it could be do

7516
02:33:59,710 --> 02:33:59,720
the blockch do you think it could be do
 

7517
02:33:59,720 --> 02:34:03,030
the blockch do you think it could be do
you think it should be um in some cases

7518
02:34:03,030 --> 02:34:03,040
you think it should be um in some cases
 

7519
02:34:03,040 --> 02:34:05,269
you think it should be um in some cases
it should be in some cases maybe it

7520
02:34:05,269 --> 02:34:05,279
it should be in some cases maybe it
 

7521
02:34:05,279 --> 02:34:08,190
it should be in some cases maybe it
shouldn't be but I mean I I I think that

7522
02:34:08,190 --> 02:34:08,200
shouldn't be but I mean I I I think that
 

7523
02:34:08,200 --> 02:34:10,389
shouldn't be but I mean I I I think that
uh so I'll give you an example using

7524
02:34:10,389 --> 02:34:10,399
uh so I'll give you an example using
 

7525
02:34:10,399 --> 02:34:13,309
uh so I'll give you an example using
ethereum you can't do it using now

7526
02:34:13,309 --> 02:34:13,319
ethereum you can't do it using now
 

7527
02:34:13,319 --> 02:34:15,990
ethereum you can't do it using now
there's more modern and faster

7528
02:34:15,990 --> 02:34:16,000
there's more modern and faster
 

7529
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,830
there's more modern and faster
blockchains where you could you could

7530
02:34:18,830 --> 02:34:18,840
blockchains where you could you could
 

7531
02:34:18,840 --> 02:34:21,190
blockchains where you could you could
start to do that in in in in in some

7532
02:34:21,190 --> 02:34:21,200
start to do that in in in in in some
 

7533
02:34:21,200 --> 02:34:23,269
start to do that in in in in in some
cases two years ago that was less so

7534
02:34:23,269 --> 02:34:23,279
cases two years ago that was less so
 

7535
02:34:23,279 --> 02:34:25,630
cases two years ago that was less so
it's a very rapidly evolving ecosystem

7536
02:34:25,630 --> 02:34:25,640
it's a very rapidly evolving ecosystem
 

7537
02:34:25,640 --> 02:34:27,269
it's a very rapidly evolving ecosystem
so like one example maybe you can

7538
02:34:27,269 --> 02:34:27,279
so like one example maybe you can
 

7539
02:34:27,279 --> 02:34:30,110
so like one example maybe you can
comment on uh something I worked a lot

7540
02:34:30,110 --> 02:34:30,120
comment on uh something I worked a lot
 

7541
02:34:30,120 --> 02:34:32,389
comment on uh something I worked a lot
on is autonomous vehicles you can see

7542
02:34:32,389 --> 02:34:32,399
on is autonomous vehicles you can see
 

7543
02:34:32,399 --> 02:34:35,910
on is autonomous vehicles you can see
each individual vehicle as a AI system

7544
02:34:35,910 --> 02:34:35,920
each individual vehicle as a AI system
 

7545
02:34:35,920 --> 02:34:38,429
each individual vehicle as a AI system
and uh you can see vehicles from uh

7546
02:34:38,429 --> 02:34:38,439
and uh you can see vehicles from uh
 

7547
02:34:38,439 --> 02:34:41,190
and uh you can see vehicles from uh
Tesla for example and then uh Ford and

7548
02:34:41,190 --> 02:34:41,200
Tesla for example and then uh Ford and
 

7549
02:34:41,200 --> 02:34:44,590
Tesla for example and then uh Ford and
GM and all these has also like

7550
02:34:44,590 --> 02:34:44,600
GM and all these has also like
 

7551
02:34:44,600 --> 02:34:46,710
GM and all these has also like
larger I mean they all are running the

7552
02:34:46,710 --> 02:34:46,720
larger I mean they all are running the
 

7553
02:34:46,720 --> 02:34:49,309
larger I mean they all are running the
same kind of system on each sets of

7554
02:34:49,309 --> 02:34:49,319
same kind of system on each sets of
 

7555
02:34:49,319 --> 02:34:50,190
same kind of system on each sets of
vehicles

7556
02:34:50,190 --> 02:34:50,200
vehicles
 

7557
02:34:50,200 --> 02:34:52,429
vehicles
so it's individual AI systems and

7558
02:34:52,429 --> 02:34:52,439
so it's individual AI systems and
 

7559
02:34:52,439 --> 02:34:54,269
so it's individual AI systems and
individual vehicles but it's all

7560
02:34:54,269 --> 02:34:54,279
individual vehicles but it's all
 

7561
02:34:54,279 --> 02:34:56,830
individual vehicles but it's all
different station is the same AI system

7562
02:34:56,830 --> 02:34:56,840
different station is the same AI system
 

7563
02:34:56,840 --> 02:34:59,710
different station is the same AI system
within the same company so you know you

7564
02:34:59,710 --> 02:34:59,720
within the same company so you know you
 

7565
02:34:59,720 --> 02:35:02,030
within the same company so you know you
can Envision a situation where all of

7566
02:35:02,030 --> 02:35:02,040
can Envision a situation where all of
 

7567
02:35:02,040 --> 02:35:04,550
can Envision a situation where all of
those AI systems are put on Singularity

7568
02:35:04,550 --> 02:35:04,560
those AI systems are put on Singularity
 

7569
02:35:04,560 --> 02:35:07,150
those AI systems are put on Singularity
net right yeah

7570
02:35:07,150 --> 02:35:07,160
net right yeah
 

7571
02:35:07,160 --> 02:35:11,030
net right yeah
and how how do you see that happening

7572
02:35:11,030 --> 02:35:11,040
and how how do you see that happening
 

7573
02:35:11,040 --> 02:35:12,830
and how how do you see that happening
and what would be the benefit and could

7574
02:35:12,830 --> 02:35:12,840
and what would be the benefit and could
 

7575
02:35:12,840 --> 02:35:14,830
and what would be the benefit and could
they share data I gu I guess one of the

7576
02:35:14,830 --> 02:35:14,840
they share data I gu I guess one of the
 

7577
02:35:14,840 --> 02:35:16,950
they share data I gu I guess one of the
biggest things is that the power there

7578
02:35:16,950 --> 02:35:16,960
biggest things is that the power there
 

7579
02:35:16,960 --> 02:35:19,870
biggest things is that the power there
is in a decentralized control but uh the

7580
02:35:19,870 --> 02:35:19,880
is in a decentralized control but uh the
 

7581
02:35:19,880 --> 02:35:21,830
is in a decentralized control but uh the
benefit would have been is is really

7582
02:35:21,830 --> 02:35:21,840
benefit would have been is is really
 

7583
02:35:21,840 --> 02:35:24,110
benefit would have been is is really
nice if they can somehow share the

7584
02:35:24,110 --> 02:35:24,120
nice if they can somehow share the
 

7585
02:35:24,120 --> 02:35:26,510
nice if they can somehow share the
knowledge in an open way if they choose

7586
02:35:26,510 --> 02:35:26,520
knowledge in an open way if they choose
 

7587
02:35:26,520 --> 02:35:28,750
knowledge in an open way if they choose
to yeah yeah yeah those are those are

7588
02:35:28,750 --> 02:35:28,760
to yeah yeah yeah those are those are
 

7589
02:35:28,760 --> 02:35:32,389
to yeah yeah yeah those are those are
all all quite good points so I I think

7590
02:35:32,389 --> 02:35:32,399
all all quite good points so I I think
 

7591
02:35:32,399 --> 02:35:36,429
all all quite good points so I I think
the the benefit from being on the on the

7592
02:35:36,429 --> 02:35:36,439
the the benefit from being on the on the
 

7593
02:35:36,439 --> 02:35:40,110
the the benefit from being on the on the
decentralized network as we envision it

7594
02:35:40,110 --> 02:35:40,120
decentralized network as we envision it
 

7595
02:35:40,120 --> 02:35:42,030
decentralized network as we envision it
is that we want the AIS and the network

7596
02:35:42,030 --> 02:35:42,040
is that we want the AIS and the network
 

7597
02:35:42,040 --> 02:35:44,429
is that we want the AIS and the network
to be Outsourcing work to each other and

7598
02:35:44,429 --> 02:35:44,439
to be Outsourcing work to each other and
 

7599
02:35:44,439 --> 02:35:46,790
to be Outsourcing work to each other and
making a API calls to to each other

7600
02:35:46,790 --> 02:35:46,800
making a API calls to to each other
 

7601
02:35:46,800 --> 02:35:49,110
making a API calls to to each other
frequently I got you so the real benefit

7602
02:35:49,110 --> 02:35:49,120
frequently I got you so the real benefit
 

7603
02:35:49,120 --> 02:35:52,510
frequently I got you so the real benefit
would be if that AI wanted to Outsource

7604
02:35:52,510 --> 02:35:52,520
would be if that AI wanted to Outsource
 

7605
02:35:52,520 --> 02:35:54,870
would be if that AI wanted to Outsource
some cognitive processing or data

7606
02:35:54,870 --> 02:35:54,880
some cognitive processing or data
 

7607
02:35:54,880 --> 02:35:56,510
some cognitive processing or data
processing or data pre-processing

7608
02:35:56,510 --> 02:35:56,520
processing or data pre-processing
 

7609
02:35:56,520 --> 02:35:59,389
processing or data pre-processing
whatever to some other AIS in the

7610
02:35:59,389 --> 02:35:59,399
whatever to some other AIS in the
 

7611
02:35:59,399 --> 02:36:01,750
whatever to some other AIS in the
network which specialize in in something

7612
02:36:01,750 --> 02:36:01,760
network which specialize in in something
 

7613
02:36:01,760 --> 02:36:05,590
network which specialize in in something
different and this this really requires

7614
02:36:05,590 --> 02:36:05,600
different and this this really requires
 

7615
02:36:05,600 --> 02:36:07,510
different and this this really requires
a different way of thinking about AI

7616
02:36:07,510 --> 02:36:07,520
a different way of thinking about AI
 

7617
02:36:07,520 --> 02:36:09,550
a different way of thinking about AI
software development right so just like

7618
02:36:09,550 --> 02:36:09,560
software development right so just like
 

7619
02:36:09,560 --> 02:36:10,950
software development right so just like
object-oriented programming was

7620
02:36:10,950 --> 02:36:10,960
object-oriented programming was
 

7621
02:36:10,960 --> 02:36:13,349
object-oriented programming was
different than imperative programming

7622
02:36:13,349 --> 02:36:13,359
different than imperative programming
 

7623
02:36:13,359 --> 02:36:16,670
different than imperative programming
and now object or programmers all use

7624
02:36:16,670 --> 02:36:16,680
and now object or programmers all use
 

7625
02:36:16,680 --> 02:36:19,030
and now object or programmers all use
these Frameworks to do things rather

7626
02:36:19,030 --> 02:36:19,040
these Frameworks to do things rather
 

7627
02:36:19,040 --> 02:36:21,389
these Frameworks to do things rather
than just libraries even you know

7628
02:36:21,389 --> 02:36:21,399
than just libraries even you know
 

7629

and and you know you have data lake so
 

7707
02:37:55,600 --> 02:37:57,910
and and you know you have data lake so
this is the data ocean right so by

this is the data ocean right so by
 

7709
02:37:57,920 --> 02:38:00,429
this is the data ocean right so by
getting ocean and Singularity net to to

are like Google Microsoft Alibaba and
 

7725
02:38:16,040 --> 02:38:18,309
are like Google Microsoft Alibaba and
Amazon which have so much money to put

Amazon which have so much money to put
 

7727
02:38:18,319 --> 02:38:20,590
Amazon which have so much money to put
behind their centralized infrastructures

their their currency restrictions that's

7786
02:39:30,349 --> 02:39:30,359
their their currency restrictions that's
 

7787
02:39:30,359 --> 02:39:32,510
their their currency restrictions that's
right so like your sense is that versus

7788
02:39:32,510 --> 02:39:32,520
right so like your sense is that versus
 

7789
02:39:32,520 --> 02:39:34,230
right so like your sense is that versus
the technical challenges because you

7790
02:39:34,230 --> 02:39:34,240
the technical challenges because you
 

7791
02:39:34,240 --> 02:39:35,550
the technical challenges because you
kind of just suggested the technical

7792
02:39:35,550 --> 02:39:35,560
kind of just suggested the technical
 

7793
02:39:35,560 --> 02:39:36,950
kind of just suggested the technical
challenges are quite high as well I mean

7794
02:39:36,950 --> 02:39:36,960
challenges are quite high as well I mean
 

7795
02:39:36,960 --> 02:39:39,469

for making a distributed money you could

7796
02:39:39,469 --> 02:39:39,479
for making a distributed money you could
 

7797
02:39:39,479 --> 02:39:41,950
for making a distributed money you could
do that on alar end right now I mean so

7798
02:39:41,950 --> 02:39:41,960
do that on alar end right now I mean so
 

7799
02:39:41,960 --> 02:39:43,990
do that on alar end right now I mean so
that while ethereum is too

7800
02:39:43,990 --> 02:39:44,000
that while ethereum is too
 

7801
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,550
that while ethereum is too
slow there's algorand and there's a few

7802
02:39:46,550 --> 02:39:46,560

02:47:46,150 --> 02:47:46,160
for doing business with Iran right so so
 

8203
02:47:46,160 --> 02:47:48,870
for doing business with Iran right so so
I mean we we already see in some ways

8204
02:47:48,870 --> 02:47:48,880
I mean we we already see in some ways
 

8205
02:47:48,880 --> 02:47:50,550
I mean we we already see in some ways
the value of having a decentralized

8206
02:47:50,550 --> 02:47:50,560
the value of having a decentralized
 

8207
02:47:50,560 --> 02:47:52,710
the value of having a decentralized
protocol because what I hope is that

8208
02:47:52,710 --> 02:47:52,720
protocol because what I hope is that
 

8209
02:47:52,720 --> 02:47:54,910

someone in Iran will put online an

right which you can pay in a

8214
02:47:58,590 --> 02:47:58,600
right which you can pay in a
 

8215
02:47:58,600 --> 02:48:00,190
right which you can pay in a

8217
02:48:00,200 --> 02:48:03,030
cryptographic token which is not owned
by any country and then if you're in

8218
02:48:03,030 --> 02:48:03,040
by any country and then if you're in
 

8219
02:48:03,040 --> 02:48:04,870
by any country and then if you're in
like Congo or somewhere that doesn't

8220
02:48:04,870 --> 02:48:04,880
like Congo or somewhere that doesn't
 

8221
02:48:04,880 --> 02:48:07,030
like Congo or somewhere that doesn't
have any problem with Iran you can

8222
02:48:07,030 --> 02:48:07,040
have any problem with Iran you can
 

8223
02:48:07,040 --> 02:48:10,309
have any problem with Iran you can
subcontract AI services that you find on

8224
02:48:10,309 --> 02:48:10,319
subcontract AI services that you find on
 

8225
02:48:10,319 --> 02:48:12,309
subcontract AI services that you find on
on on on that marketplace right even

8226
02:48:12,309 --> 02:48:12,319
on on on that marketplace right even
 

8227
02:48:12,319 --> 02:48:16,670
on on on that marketplace right even
though US citizens can't by by US law so

8228
02:48:16,670 --> 02:48:16,680
though US citizens can't by by US law so
 

8229
02:48:16,680 --> 02:48:19,870
though US citizens can't by by US law so
right now that's kind of a point you

8230
02:48:19,870 --> 02:48:19,880
right now that's kind of a point you
 

8231
02:48:19,880 --> 02:48:22,990
right now that's kind of a point you
know as as you alluded if if regulations

8232
02:48:22,990 --> 02:48:23,000
know as as you alluded if if regulations
 

8233
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:24,230
know as as you alluded if if regulations
go in the wrong direction it could

8234
02:48:24,230 --> 02:48:24,240
go in the wrong direction it could
 

8235
02:48:24,240 --> 02:48:26,630
go in the wrong direction it could
become more of a major point but I think

8236
02:48:26,630 --> 02:48:26,640
become more of a major point but I think
 

8237
02:48:26,640 --> 02:48:29,309
become more of a major point but I think
it also is the case that having these

8238
02:48:29,309 --> 02:48:29,319
it also is the case that having these
 

8239
02:48:29,319 --> 02:48:32,110
it also is the case that having these
workarounds to regulations in place is a

8240
02:48:32,110 --> 02:48:32,120
workarounds to regulations in place is a
 

8241
02:48:32,120 --> 02:48:34,110
workarounds to regulations in place is a
defense mechanism against those

8242
02:48:34,110 --> 02:48:34,120
defense mechanism against those
 

8243
02:48:34,120 --> 02:48:37,389
defense mechanism against those
regulations being put into place and you

8244
02:48:37,389 --> 02:48:37,399
regulations being put into place and you
 

8245
02:48:37,399 --> 02:48:38,950
regulations being put into place and you
could see that in the music industry

8246
02:48:38,950 --> 02:48:38,960
could see that in the music industry
 

8247
02:48:38,960 --> 02:48:41,269
could see that in the music industry
right I mean Napster just happened and

8248
02:48:41,269 --> 02:48:41,279
right I mean Napster just happened and
 

8249
02:48:41,279 --> 02:48:43,950
right I mean Napster just happened and
bit torrent just happened and now most

8250
02:48:43,950 --> 02:48:43,960
bit torrent just happened and now most
 

8251
02:48:43,960 --> 02:48:46,070
bit torrent just happened and now most
people in my kids generation they're

8252
02:48:46,070 --> 02:48:46,080
people in my kids generation they're
 

8253
02:48:46,080 --> 02:48:48,269
people in my kids generation they're
baffled by the idea of paying for music

8254
02:48:48,269 --> 02:48:48,279
baffled by the idea of paying for music
 

8255
02:48:48,279 --> 02:48:49,269
baffled by the idea of paying for music
right

8256
02:48:49,269 --> 02:48:49,279
right
 

8257
02:48:49,279 --> 02:48:52,710
right
I mean my dad pays for music but I mean

8258
02:48:52,710 --> 02:48:52,720
I mean my dad pays for music but I mean
 

8259
02:48:52,720 --> 02:48:55,070
I mean my dad pays for music but I mean
yeah but because these decentralized

8260
02:48:55,070 --> 02:48:55,080
yeah but because these decentralized
 

8261
02:48:55,080 --> 02:48:57,110
yeah but because these decentralized
mechanisms happened and then the

8262
02:48:57,110 --> 02:48:57,120
mechanisms happened and then the
 

8263
02:48:57,120 --> 02:48:59,230
mechanisms happened and then the
regulations followed right and the

8264
02:48:59,230 --> 02:48:59,240
regulations followed right and the
 

8265
02:48:59,240 --> 02:49:01,269
regulations followed right and the
regulations would be very different if

8266
02:49:01,269 --> 02:49:01,279
regulations would be very different if
 

8267
02:49:01,279 --> 02:49:03,550
regulations would be very different if
they'd been put into place before there

8268
02:49:03,550 --> 02:49:03,560
they'd been put into place before there
 

8269
02:49:03,560 --> 02:49:05,550
they'd been put into place before there
was Napster and bit Tor and so forth so

8270
02:49:05,550 --> 02:49:05,560
was Napster and bit Tor and so forth so
 

8271
02:49:05,560 --> 02:49:08,309
was Napster and bit Tor and so forth so
in the same way we got to put AI out

8272
02:49:08,309 --> 02:49:08,319
in the same way we got to put AI out
 

8273
02:49:08,319 --> 02:49:10,469
in the same way we got to put AI out
there in a decentralized vein and Big

8274
02:49:10,469 --> 02:49:10,479
there in a decentralized vein and Big
 

8275
02:49:10,479 --> 02:49:12,990
there in a decentralized vein and Big
Data out there in a decentralized vein

8276
02:49:12,990 --> 02:49:13,000
Data out there in a decentralized vein
 

8277
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,349
Data out there in a decentralized vein
now so that the most advanced AI in the

8278
02:49:15,349 --> 02:49:15,359
now so that the most advanced AI in the
 

8279
02:49:15,359 --> 02:49:18,510
now so that the most advanced AI in the
world is fundamentally decentralized and

8280
02:49:18,510 --> 02:49:18,520
world is fundamentally decentralized and
 

8281
02:49:18,520 --> 02:49:20,510
world is fundamentally decentralized and
if that's the case that's just the

8282
02:49:20,510 --> 02:49:20,520
if that's the case that's just the
 

8283
02:49:20,520 --> 02:49:23,710
if that's the case that's just the
reality The Regulators have to deal with

8284
02:49:23,710 --> 02:49:23,720
reality The Regulators have to deal with
 

8285
02:49:23,720 --> 02:49:25,429
reality The Regulators have to deal with
and then as in the music case they're

8286
02:49:25,429 --> 02:49:25,439
and then as in the music case they're
 

8287
02:49:25,439 --> 02:49:28,469
and then as in the music case they're
going to come up with regulations that

8288
02:49:28,469 --> 02:49:28,479
going to come up with regulations that
 

8289
02:49:28,479 --> 02:49:30,269
going to come up with regulations that
sort of work with the with the

8290
02:49:30,269 --> 02:49:30,279
sort of work with the with the
 

8291
02:49:30,279 --> 02:49:31,990
sort of work with the with the
decentralized

8292
02:49:31,990 --> 02:49:32,000
decentralized
 

8293
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,790
decentralized
reality beautiful you were the chief

8294
02:49:34,790 --> 02:49:34,800
reality beautiful you were the chief
 

8295
02:49:34,800 --> 02:49:38,110
reality beautiful you were the chief
scientist of Hansen robotics uh you're

8296
02:49:38,110 --> 02:49:38,120
scientist of Hansen robotics uh you're
 

8297
02:49:38,120 --> 02:49:40,429
scientist of Hansen robotics uh you're
still involved with Hansen robotics uh

8298
02:49:40,429 --> 02:49:40,439
still involved with Hansen robotics uh
 

8299
02:49:40,439 --> 02:49:42,190
still involved with Hansen robotics uh
doing a lot of really interesting stuff

8300
02:49:42,190 --> 02:49:42,200
doing a lot of really interesting stuff
 

8301
02:49:42,200 --> 02:49:43,950
doing a lot of really interesting stuff
there this is for people who don't know

8302
02:49:43,950 --> 02:49:43,960
there this is for people who don't know
 

8303
02:49:43,960 --> 02:49:47,349
there this is for people who don't know
the company that created sopia the Robot

8304
02:49:47,349 --> 02:49:47,359
the company that created sopia the Robot
 

8305
02:49:47,359 --> 02:49:51,630
the company that created sopia the Robot
can you tell me who who Sophia is I'd

8306
02:49:51,630 --> 02:49:51,640
can you tell me who who Sophia is I'd
 

8307
02:49:51,640 --> 02:49:53,269
can you tell me who who Sophia is I'd
rather start by telling you who David

8308
02:49:53,269 --> 02:49:53,279
rather start by telling you who David
 

8309
02:49:53,279 --> 02:49:56,070
rather start by telling you who David
Hansen is because it's David is the

8310
02:49:56,070 --> 02:49:56,080
Hansen is because it's David is the
 

8311
02:49:56,080 --> 02:49:58,750
Hansen is because it's David is the
brilliant mind behind this Sophia robot

8312
02:49:58,750 --> 02:49:58,760
brilliant mind behind this Sophia robot
 

8313
02:49:58,760 --> 02:50:01,349
brilliant mind behind this Sophia robot
and he remains so far he remains more

8314
02:50:01,349 --> 02:50:01,359
and he remains so far he remains more
 

8315
02:50:01,359 --> 02:50:03,990
and he remains so far he remains more
interesting than his than his creation

8316
02:50:03,990 --> 02:50:04,000
interesting than his than his creation
 

8317
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:05,870
interesting than his than his creation
alth although she may be improving

8318
02:50:05,870 --> 02:50:05,880
alth although she may be improving
 

8319
02:50:05,880 --> 02:50:08,790
alth although she may be improving
faster than he is actually I mean's yeah

8320
02:50:08,790 --> 02:50:08,800
faster than he is actually I mean's yeah
 

8321
02:50:08,800 --> 02:50:12,070
faster than he is actually I mean's yeah
so yeah I met a good point I met David

8322
02:50:12,070 --> 02:50:12,080
so yeah I met a good point I met David
 

8323
02:50:12,080 --> 02:50:13,550
so yeah I met a good point I met David
maybe

8324
02:50:13,550 --> 02:50:13,560
maybe
 

8325
02:50:13,560 --> 02:50:16,309
maybe
2007 or something at some futurist

8326
02:50:16,309 --> 02:50:16,319
2007 or something at some futurist
 

8327
02:50:16,319 --> 02:50:19,070
2007 or something at some futurist
conference we were both speaking at and

8328
02:50:19,070 --> 02:50:19,080
conference we were both speaking at and
 

8329
02:50:19,080 --> 02:50:22,229
conference we were both speaking at and
I could see we had a great great deal in

8330
02:50:22,229 --> 02:50:22,239
I could see we had a great great deal in
 

8331
02:50:22,239 --> 02:50:24,510
I could see we had a great great deal in
common I mean we we're both kind of

8332
02:50:24,510 --> 02:50:24,520
common I mean we we're both kind of
 

8333
02:50:24,520 --> 02:50:27,150
common I mean we we're both kind of
crazy but we also we we both had a

8334
02:50:27,150 --> 02:50:27,160
crazy but we also we we both had a
 

8335
02:50:27,160 --> 02:50:30,429
crazy but we also we we both had a
passion for AGI and and and the

8336
02:50:30,429 --> 02:50:30,439
passion for AGI and and and the
 

8337
02:50:30,439 --> 02:50:32,870
passion for AGI and and and the
singularity and we were both huge fans

8338
02:50:32,870 --> 02:50:32,880
singularity and we were both huge fans
 

8339
02:50:32,880 --> 02:50:35,269
singularity and we were both huge fans
of the work of uh Philip KCK the the

8340
02:50:35,269 --> 02:50:35,279
of the work of uh Philip KCK the the
 

8341
02:50:35,279 --> 02:50:38,150
of the work of uh Philip KCK the the
science fiction writer and I wanted to

8342
02:50:38,150 --> 02:50:38,160
science fiction writer and I wanted to
 

8343
02:50:38,160 --> 02:50:41,750
science fiction writer and I wanted to
create benevolent AGI that that would uh

8344
02:50:41,750 --> 02:50:41,760
create benevolent AGI that that would uh
 

8345
02:50:41,760 --> 02:50:44,750
create benevolent AGI that that would uh
you know create massively better life

8346
02:50:44,750 --> 02:50:44,760
you know create massively better life
 

8347
02:50:44,760 --> 02:50:47,469
you know create massively better life
for all humans and all sensient beings

8348
02:50:47,469 --> 02:50:47,479
for all humans and all sensient beings
 

8349
02:50:47,479 --> 02:50:49,510
for all humans and all sensient beings
including animals plants and superum

8350
02:50:49,510 --> 02:50:49,520
including animals plants and superum
 

8351
02:50:49,520 --> 02:50:52,550
including animals plants and superum
beings and David he wanted exactly the

8352
02:50:52,550 --> 02:50:52,560
beings and David he wanted exactly the
 

8353
02:50:52,560 --> 02:50:55,349
beings and David he wanted exactly the
same thing but he had a different idea

8354
02:50:55,349 --> 02:50:55,359
same thing but he had a different idea
 

8355
02:50:55,359 --> 02:50:57,670
same thing but he had a different idea
of of how to do it he wanted to get

8356
02:50:57,670 --> 02:50:57,680
of of how to do it he wanted to get
 

8357
02:50:57,680 --> 02:51:00,590
of of how to do it he wanted to get
computational compassion like he wanted

8358
02:51:00,590 --> 02:51:00,600
computational compassion like he wanted
 

8359
02:51:00,600 --> 02:51:03,150
computational compassion like he wanted
to get machines that that would would

8360
02:51:03,150 --> 02:51:03,160
to get machines that that would would
 

8361
02:51:03,160 --> 02:51:05,710
to get machines that that would would
love people and empathize with people

8362
02:51:05,710 --> 02:51:05,720
love people and empathize with people
 

8363
02:51:05,720 --> 02:51:07,349
love people and empathize with people
and he thought the way to do that was to

8364
02:51:07,349 --> 02:51:07,359
and he thought the way to do that was to
 

8365
02:51:07,359 --> 02:51:09,550
and he thought the way to do that was to
make a machine that could you know look

8366
02:51:09,550 --> 02:51:09,560
make a machine that could you know look
 

8367
02:51:09,560 --> 02:51:12,469
make a machine that could you know look
people eye to eye face to face look at

8368
02:51:12,469 --> 02:51:12,479
people eye to eye face to face look at
 

8369
02:51:12,479 --> 02:51:15,110
people eye to eye face to face look at
look at people and make people love the

8370
02:51:15,110 --> 02:51:15,120
look at people and make people love the
 

8371
02:51:15,120 --> 02:51:16,950
look at people and make people love the
machine and the Machine loves the people

8372
02:51:16,950 --> 02:51:16,960
machine and the Machine loves the people
 

8373
02:51:16,960 --> 02:51:20,229
machine and the Machine loves the people
back so I thought that was very

8374
02:51:20,229 --> 02:51:20,239
back so I thought that was very
 

8375
02:51:20,239 --> 02:51:21,790
back so I thought that was very
different way of looking at it cuz I'm

8376
02:51:21,790 --> 02:51:21,800
different way of looking at it cuz I'm
 

8377
02:51:21,800 --> 02:51:23,870
different way of looking at it cuz I'm
very math oriented and I'm just thinking

8378
02:51:23,870 --> 02:51:23,880
very math oriented and I'm just thinking
 

8379
02:51:23,880 --> 02:51:26,389
very math oriented and I'm just thinking
like what is the abstract

8380
02:51:26,389 --> 02:51:26,399
like what is the abstract
 

8381
02:51:26,399 --> 02:51:28,750
like what is the abstract
cognitive algorithm that will let the

8382
02:51:28,750 --> 02:51:28,760
cognitive algorithm that will let the
 

8383
02:51:28,760 --> 02:51:31,229
cognitive algorithm that will let the
system you know internalize the complex

8384
02:51:31,229 --> 02:51:31,239
system you know internalize the complex
 

8385
02:51:31,239 --> 02:51:33,190
system you know internalize the complex
patterns of human values blah blah blah

8386
02:51:33,190 --> 02:51:33,200
patterns of human values blah blah blah
 

8387
02:51:33,200 --> 02:51:35,349
patterns of human values blah blah blah
whereas he's like look you in the face

8388
02:51:35,349 --> 02:51:35,359
whereas he's like look you in the face
 

8389
02:51:35,359 --> 02:51:38,790
whereas he's like look you in the face
in the eye and love you right so so I we

8390
02:51:38,790 --> 02:51:38,800
in the eye and love you right so so I we
 

8391
02:51:38,800 --> 02:51:42,870
in the eye and love you right so so I we
we we hit it off quite well and we talk

8392
02:51:42,870 --> 02:51:42,880
we we hit it off quite well and we talk
 

8393
02:51:42,880 --> 02:51:45,990
we we hit it off quite well and we talk
to each other off and on then I moved to

8394
02:51:45,990 --> 02:51:46,000
to each other off and on then I moved to
 

8395
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:50,950
to each other off and on then I moved to
Hong Kong in 20 20 11 so I'd been I mean

8396
02:51:50,950 --> 02:51:50,960
Hong Kong in 20 20 11 so I'd been I mean
 

8397
02:51:50,960 --> 02:51:53,030
Hong Kong in 20 20 11 so I'd been I mean
I've been I've been living all over the

8398
02:51:53,030 --> 02:51:53,040
I've been I've been living all over the
 

8399
02:51:53,040 --> 02:51:54,510
I've been I've been living all over the
place I've been in Australia and New

8400
02:51:54,510 --> 02:51:54,520
place I've been in Australia and New
 

8401
02:51:54,520 --> 02:51:57,309
place I've been in Australia and New
Zealand in my AC academic career then in

so I didn't get that tightly involved

8500
02:53:50,710 --> 02:53:50,720
so I didn't get that tightly involved
 

8501

8509
02:54:01,239 --> 02:54:03,469
the same place I started to get I
started to think about what you could

8510
02:54:03,469 --> 02:54:03,479
started to think about what you could
 

8511
02:54:03,479 --> 02:54:07,469
started to think about what you could
do to make his robots smarter than they

8512
02:54:07,469 --> 02:54:07,479
do to make his robots smarter than they
 

8513
02:54:07,479 --> 02:54:10,229
do to make his robots smarter than they
were and so we started working together

8514
02:54:10,229 --> 02:54:10,239
were and so we started working together
 

8515
02:54:10,239 --> 02:54:12,110
were and so we started working together

8697
02:58:08,359 --> 02:58:09,870

02:58:09,880 --> 02:58:12,309
in in its own way as it gets more and
more intelligent now David saw this the

02:58:12,309 --> 02:58:12,319
more intelligent now David saw this the
 

8701
02:58:12,319 --> 02:58:13,790
more intelligent now David saw this the
same way that's why he came up with the

02:58:13,790 --> 02:58:13,800
same way that's why he came up with the
 

8703
02:58:13,800 --> 02:58:17,229
same way that's why he came up with the
name Sophia which means which means

02:58:17,229 --> 02:58:17,239
name Sophia which means which means
 

8705
02:58:17,239 --> 02:58:21,110
name Sophia which means which means
wisdom so it seemed to me making these

8707
02:58:21,120 --> 02:58:22,870

02:58:31,630 --> 02:58:31,640
roll out early stage AGI systems so they
 

8715
02:58:31,640 --> 02:58:34,550
roll out early stage AGI systems so they
can learn from people and not just learn

8716
02:58:34,550 --> 02:58:34,560
can learn from people and not just learn
 

8717
02:58:34,560 --> 02:58:36,550
can learn from people and not just learn
factual knowledge but learn human human

8718
02:58:36,550 --> 02:58:36,560
factual knowledge but learn human human
 

8719
02:58:36,560 --> 02:58:38,710
factual knowledge but learn human human
values and ethics from people while

8720
02:58:38,710 --> 02:58:38,720
values and ethics from people while
 

8721
02:58:38,720 --> 02:58:40,950
values and ethics from people while
being their you know their home service

8722
02:58:40,950 --> 02:58:40,960
being their you know their home service
 

8723
02:58:40,960 --> 02:58:42,830
being their you know their home service
robots their education assistants

8724
02:58:42,830 --> 02:58:42,840
robots their education assistants
 

8725
02:58:42,840 --> 02:58:44,910
robots their education assistants
they're they're nursing robots so that

8726
02:58:44,910 --> 02:58:44,920
they're they're nursing robots so that
 

8727
02:58:44,920 --> 02:58:46,750
they're they're nursing robots so that
that was the Grand Vision now if you've

8728
02:58:46,750 --> 02:58:46,760
that was the Grand Vision now if you've
 

8729
02:58:46,760 --> 02:58:48,590
that was the Grand Vision now if you've
ever worked with robots

8730
02:58:48,590 --> 02:58:48,600
ever worked with robots
 

8731
02:58:48,600 --> 02:58:50,389
ever worked with robots
the reality is is quite different right

8732
02:58:50,389 --> 02:58:50,399
the reality is is quite different right
 

8733
02:58:50,399 --> 02:58:52,070
the reality is is quite different right
like the first principle is the robot is

8734
02:58:52,070 --> 02:58:52,080
like the first principle is the robot is
 

8735
02:58:52,080 --> 02:58:53,790
like the first principle is the robot is
always

8736
02:58:53,790 --> 02:58:53,800
always
 

8737
02:58:53,800 --> 02:58:56,229
always
broken work I mean I worked with robots

8738
02:58:56,229 --> 02:58:56,239
broken work I mean I worked with robots
 

8739
02:58:56,239 --> 02:58:58,070
broken work I mean I worked with robots
in the 90s a bunch when you had to

8740
02:58:58,070 --> 02:58:58,080
in the 90s a bunch when you had to
 

8741
02:58:58,080 --> 02:59:00,469
in the 90s a bunch when you had to
solder them together yourself and I'd

8742
02:59:00,469 --> 02:59:00,479
solder them together yourself and I'd
 

8743
02:59:00,479 --> 02:59:02,150
solder them together yourself and I'd
put neural Nets doing reinforcement

8744
02:59:02,150 --> 02:59:02,160
put neural Nets doing reinforcement
 

8745
02:59:02,160 --> 02:59:05,110
put neural Nets doing reinforcement
learning on like overturn solid Bowl

8746
02:59:05,110 --> 02:59:05,120
learning on like overturn solid Bowl
 

8747
02:59:05,120 --> 02:59:08,269
learning on like overturn solid Bowl
type robots in in the 90s when I was a

8748
02:59:08,269 --> 02:59:08,279
type robots in in the 90s when I was a
 

8749
02:59:08,279 --> 02:59:10,510
type robots in in the 90s when I was a
professor things of course Advanced a

8750
02:59:10,510 --> 02:59:10,520
professor things of course Advanced a
 

8751
02:59:10,520 --> 02:59:13,110
professor things of course Advanced a
lot but but the principle still holds

8752
02:59:13,110 --> 02:59:13,120
lot but but the principle still holds
 

8753
02:59:13,120 --> 02:59:14,429
lot but but the principle still holds
the principle of the robots always

8754
02:59:14,429 --> 02:59:14,439
the principle of the robots always
 

8755
02:59:14,439 --> 02:59:17,830
the principle of the robots always
broken still holds yeah yeah so faced

8756
02:59:17,830 --> 02:59:17,840
broken still holds yeah yeah so faced
 

8757
02:59:17,840 --> 02:59:21,070
broken still holds yeah yeah so faced
with reality of making Sophia do stuff

8758
02:59:21,070 --> 02:59:21,080
with reality of making Sophia do stuff
 

8759
02:59:21,080 --> 02:59:24,990
with reality of making Sophia do stuff
many of my Robo AGI aspirations were

8760
02:59:24,990 --> 02:59:25,000
many of my Robo AGI aspirations were
 

8761
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:27,710
many of my Robo AGI aspirations were
temporarily cast aside and I mean

8762
02:59:27,710 --> 02:59:27,720
temporarily cast aside and I mean
 

8763
02:59:27,720 --> 02:59:29,269
temporarily cast aside and I mean
there's just a

8764
02:59:29,269 --> 02:59:29,279
there's just a
 

8765
02:59:29,279 --> 02:59:32,110
there's just a
practical problem of making this robot

8766
02:59:32,110 --> 02:59:32,120
practical problem of making this robot
 

8767
02:59:32,120 --> 02:59:33,910
practical problem of making this robot
interact in a meaningful way because

8768
02:59:33,910 --> 02:59:33,920
interact in a meaningful way because
 

8769
02:59:33,920 --> 02:59:35,590
interact in a meaningful way because
like you know you put nice computer

8770
02:59:35,590 --> 02:59:35,600
like you know you put nice computer
 

8771
02:59:35,600 --> 02:59:38,229
like you know you put nice computer
vision on there but there's always glare

8772
02:59:38,229 --> 02:59:38,239
vision on there but there's always glare
 

8773
02:59:38,239 --> 02:59:40,550
vision on there but there's always glare
and then or it you have a dialogue

8774
02:59:40,550 --> 02:59:40,560
and then or it you have a dialogue
 

8775
02:59:40,560 --> 02:59:44,309
and then or it you have a dialogue
system but at the time I was there like

8776
02:59:44,309 --> 02:59:44,319
system but at the time I was there like
 

8777
02:59:44,319 --> 02:59:46,710
system but at the time I was there like
no speech text algorithm could deal with

8778
02:59:46,710 --> 02:59:46,720
no speech text algorithm could deal with
 

8779
02:59:46,720 --> 02:59:48,870
no speech text algorithm could deal with
Hong Kong Hong Kong people's English

8780
02:59:48,870 --> 02:59:48,880
Hong Kong Hong Kong people's English
 

8781
02:59:48,880 --> 02:59:50,990
Hong Kong Hong Kong people's English
accents yeah so the the speech of text

8782
02:59:50,990 --> 02:59:51,000
accents yeah so the the speech of text
 

8783
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:52,309
accents yeah so the the speech of text
was always bad so the robot always

8784
02:59:52,309 --> 02:59:52,319
was always bad so the robot always
 

8785
02:59:52,319 --> 02:59:54,229
was always bad so the robot always
sounded stupid yeah because it wasn't

8786
02:59:54,229 --> 02:59:54,239
sounded stupid yeah because it wasn't
 

8787
02:59:54,239 --> 02:59:56,630
sounded stupid yeah because it wasn't
getting the right text right so I

8788
02:59:56,630 --> 02:59:56,640
getting the right text right so I
 

8789
02:59:56,640 --> 02:59:59,150
getting the right text right so I
started to view that really as

8790
02:59:59,150 --> 02:59:59,160
started to view that really as
 

8791
02:59:59,160 --> 03:00:01,469
started to view that really as
what what in software engineering you

8792
03:00:01,469 --> 03:00:01,479
what what in software engineering you
 

8793
03:00:01,479 --> 03:00:03,429
what what in software engineering you
call a walking skeleton which is maybe

8794
03:00:03,429 --> 03:00:03,439
call a walking skeleton which is maybe
 

8795
03:00:03,439 --> 03:00:05,429
call a walking skeleton which is maybe
the the wrong metaphor to use for Sophia

8796
03:00:05,429 --> 03:00:05,439
the the wrong metaphor to use for Sophia
 

8797
03:00:05,439 --> 03:00:07,429
the the wrong metaphor to use for Sophia
or maybe the right one but I mean what a

8798
03:00:07,429 --> 03:00:07,439
or maybe the right one but I mean what a
 

8799
03:00:07,439 --> 03:00:08,990
or maybe the right one but I mean what a
walking skeleton is in software

8800
03:00:08,990 --> 03:00:09,000
walking skeleton is in software
 

8801
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:11,309
walking skeleton is in software
development is if you're building a

8802
03:00:11,309 --> 03:00:11,319
development is if you're building a
 

8803
03:00:11,319 --> 03:00:14,030
development is if you're building a
complex system how do you get started

8804
03:00:14,030 --> 03:00:14,040
complex system how do you get started
 

8805
03:00:14,040 --> 03:00:15,790
complex system how do you get started
but one way is to First build part one

8806
03:00:15,790 --> 03:00:15,800
but one way is to First build part one
 

8807
03:00:15,800 --> 03:00:17,550
but one way is to First build part one
well then build part two well then build

8808
03:00:17,550 --> 03:00:17,560
well then build part two well then build
 

8809
03:00:17,560 --> 03:00:20,790
well then build part two well then build
part three well and so on another way is

8810
03:00:20,790 --> 03:00:20,800
part three well and so on another way is
 

8811
03:00:20,800 --> 03:00:22,229
part three well and so on another way is
you make like a simple version of the

8812
03:00:22,229 --> 03:00:22,239
you make like a simple version of the
 

8813
03:00:22,239 --> 03:00:24,469
you make like a simple version of the
whole system and put something in the

8814
03:00:24,469 --> 03:00:24,479
whole system and put something in the
 

8815
03:00:24,479 --> 03:00:26,030
whole system and put something in the
place of every part the whole system

8816
03:00:26,030 --> 03:00:26,040
place of every part the whole system
 

8817
03:00:26,040 --> 03:00:27,990
place of every part the whole system
will need so that you have a whole

8818
03:00:27,990 --> 03:00:28,000
will need so that you have a whole
 

8819
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:30,030
will need so that you have a whole
system that does something and then you

8820
03:00:30,030 --> 03:00:30,040
system that does something and then you
 

8821
03:00:30,040 --> 03:00:32,110
system that does something and then you
work on improving each part in the

8822
03:00:32,110 --> 03:00:32,120
work on improving each part in the
 

8823
03:00:32,120 --> 03:00:34,389
work on improving each part in the
context of that whole integrated system

8824
03:00:34,389 --> 03:00:34,399
context of that whole integrated system
 

8825
03:00:34,399 --> 03:00:37,190
context of that whole integrated system
so that's what we did on a software

8826
03:00:37,190 --> 03:00:37,200
so that's what we did on a software
 

8827
03:00:37,200 --> 03:00:39,590
so that's what we did on a software
level in Sophia we made like a walking

8828
03:00:39,590 --> 03:00:39,600
level in Sophia we made like a walking
 

8829
03:00:39,600 --> 03:00:41,870
level in Sophia we made like a walking
skeleton Software System where so

8830
03:00:41,870 --> 03:00:41,880
skeleton Software System where so
 

8831
03:00:41,880 --> 03:00:43,150
skeleton Software System where so
there's something that sees there's

8832
03:00:43,150 --> 03:00:43,160
there's something that sees there's
 

8833
03:00:43,160 --> 03:00:45,070
there's something that sees there's
something that hears there's something

8834
03:00:45,070 --> 03:00:45,080
something that hears there's something
 

8835
03:00:45,080 --> 03:00:46,910
something that hears there's something
that moves there's something that

8836
03:00:46,910 --> 03:00:46,920
that moves there's something that
 

8837
03:00:46,920 --> 03:00:48,309
that moves there's something that
there's something that remembers there's

8838
03:00:48,309 --> 03:00:48,319
there's something that remembers there's
 

8839
03:00:48,319 --> 03:00:50,630
there's something that remembers there's
something that learns you put a simple

8840
03:00:50,630 --> 03:00:50,640
something that learns you put a simple
 

8841
03:00:50,640 --> 03:00:52,630
something that learns you put a simple
version of each thing in there and you

8842
03:00:52,630 --> 03:00:52,640
version of each thing in there and you
 

8843
03:00:52,640 --> 03:00:54,990
version of each thing in there and you
connect them all together so that the

8844
03:00:54,990 --> 03:00:55,000
connect them all together so that the
 

8845
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:56,830
connect them all together so that the
system will will will do its thing so

8846
03:00:56,830 --> 03:00:56,840
system will will will do its thing so
 

8847
03:00:56,840 --> 03:00:59,590
system will will will do its thing so
there's there's a lot of AI in there

8848
03:00:59,590 --> 03:00:59,600
there's there's a lot of AI in there
 

8849
03:00:59,600 --> 03:01:01,590
there's there's a lot of AI in there
there's not any AGI in there I mean

8850
03:01:01,590 --> 03:01:01,600
there's not any AGI in there I mean
 

8851
03:01:01,600 --> 03:01:03,229
there's not any AGI in there I mean
there's computer vision to recognize

8852
03:01:03,229 --> 03:01:03,239
there's computer vision to recognize
 

8853
03:01:03,239 --> 03:01:05,790
there's computer vision to recognize
people's faces recognize when someone

8854
03:01:05,790 --> 03:01:05,800
people's faces recognize when someone
 

8855
03:01:05,800 --> 03:01:07,870
people's faces recognize when someone
comes in the room and leaves try to

8856
03:01:07,870 --> 03:01:07,880
comes in the room and leaves try to
 

8857
03:01:07,880 --> 03:01:09,550
comes in the room and leaves try to
recognize whether two people are

8858
03:01:09,550 --> 03:01:09,560
recognize whether two people are
 

8859
03:01:09,560 --> 03:01:12,389
recognize whether two people are
together or not I mean the dialogue

8860
03:01:12,389 --> 03:01:12,399
together or not I mean the dialogue
 

8861
03:01:12,399 --> 03:01:16,150
together or not I mean the dialogue
system it's a mix of like hand-coded

8862
03:01:16,150 --> 03:01:16,160
system it's a mix of like hand-coded
 

8863
03:01:16,160 --> 03:01:18,910
system it's a mix of like hand-coded
rules with deep neural Nets that that

8864
03:01:18,910 --> 03:01:18,920
rules with deep neural Nets that that
 

8865
03:01:18,920 --> 03:01:20,309
rules with deep neural Nets that that
come up with with with their with their

8866
03:01:20,309 --> 03:01:20,319
come up with with with their with their
 

8867
03:01:20,319 --> 03:01:23,590
come up with with with their with their
own responses and there's some attempt

8868
03:01:23,590 --> 03:01:23,600
own responses and there's some attempt
 

8869
03:01:23,600 --> 03:01:25,870
own responses and there's some attempt
to have a narrative structure right and

8870
03:01:25,870 --> 03:01:25,880
to have a narrative structure right and
 

8871
03:01:25,880 --> 03:01:28,309
to have a narrative structure right and
sort of try to pull the conversation

8872
03:01:28,309 --> 03:01:28,319
sort of try to pull the conversation
 

8873
03:01:28,319 --> 03:01:30,070
sort of try to pull the conversation
into something with a be beginning

8874
03:01:30,070 --> 03:01:30,080
into something with a be beginning
 

8875
03:01:30,080 --> 03:01:31,790
into something with a be beginning
middle and end and this sort of story

8876
03:01:31,790 --> 03:01:31,800
middle and end and this sort of story
 

8877
03:01:31,800 --> 03:01:34,550
middle and end and this sort of story
arc so it's I mean like if you look at

8878
03:01:34,550 --> 03:01:34,560
arc so it's I mean like if you look at
 

8879
03:01:34,560 --> 03:01:37,510
arc so it's I mean like if you look at
the lobner prize and the the systems

8880
03:01:37,510 --> 03:01:37,520
the lobner prize and the the systems
 

8881
03:01:37,520 --> 03:01:38,990
the lobner prize and the the systems
that beat the touring test currently

8882
03:01:38,990 --> 03:01:39,000
that beat the touring test currently
 

8883
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:41,550
that beat the touring test currently
they're heavily rule-based because uh

8884
03:01:41,550 --> 03:01:41,560
they're heavily rule-based because uh
 

8885
03:01:41,560 --> 03:01:43,990
they're heavily rule-based because uh
like you had said narrative structure to

8886
03:01:43,990 --> 03:01:44,000
like you had said narrative structure to
 

8887
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:45,830
like you had said narrative structure to
create compelling conversations you

8888
03:01:45,830 --> 03:01:45,840
create compelling conversations you
 

8889
03:01:45,840 --> 03:01:48,190
create compelling conversations you
currently new networks cannot do that

8890
03:01:48,190 --> 03:01:48,200
currently new networks cannot do that
 

8891
03:01:48,200 --> 03:01:50,910
currently new networks cannot do that
well even with Google Mina um when you

8892
03:01:50,910 --> 03:01:50,920
well even with Google Mina um when you
 

8893
03:01:50,920 --> 03:01:52,990
well even with Google Mina um when you
actually look at fullscale conversations

8894
03:01:52,990 --> 03:01:53,000
actually look at fullscale conversations
 

8895
03:01:53,000 --> 03:01:54,550
actually look at fullscale conversations
it's just yeah this is the thing so

8896
03:01:54,550 --> 03:01:54,560
it's just yeah this is the thing so
 

8897
03:01:54,560 --> 03:01:57,309
it's just yeah this is the thing so
we've been I've actually been running an

8898
03:01:57,309 --> 03:01:57,319
we've been I've actually been running an
 

8899
03:01:57,319 --> 03:01:59,550
we've been I've actually been running an
experiment the last couple weeks taking

8900
03:01:59,550 --> 03:01:59,560
experiment the last couple weeks taking
 

8901
03:01:59,560 --> 03:02:02,590
experiment the last couple weeks taking
Sophia's chatbot and then the Facebook's

8902
03:02:02,590 --> 03:02:02,600
Sophia's chatbot and then the Facebook's
 

8903
03:02:02,600 --> 03:02:04,469
Sophia's chatbot and then the Facebook's
Transformer chatbot which they open the

8904
03:02:04,469 --> 03:02:04,479
Transformer chatbot which they open the
 

8905
03:02:04,479 --> 03:02:06,469
Transformer chatbot which they open the
model we've had them chatting to each

8906
03:02:06,469 --> 03:02:06,479
model we've had them chatting to each
 

8907
03:02:06,479 --> 03:02:08,030
model we've had them chatting to each
other for a number of weeks on the

8908
03:02:08,030 --> 03:02:08,040
other for a number of weeks on the
 

8909
03:02:08,040 --> 03:02:10,150
other for a number of weeks on the
server just that's funny gen we're

8910
03:02:10,150 --> 03:02:10,160
server just that's funny gen we're
 

8911
03:02:10,160 --> 03:02:12,870
server just that's funny gen we're
generating training data of what Sophia

8912
03:02:12,870 --> 03:02:12,880
generating training data of what Sophia
 

8913
03:02:12,880 --> 03:02:15,510
generating training data of what Sophia
says in a wide variety of conversations

8914
03:02:15,510 --> 03:02:15,520
says in a wide variety of conversations
 

8915
03:02:15,520 --> 03:02:18,349
says in a wide variety of conversations
but we can see compared to Sophia's

8916
03:02:18,349 --> 03:02:18,359
but we can see compared to Sophia's
 

8917
03:02:18,359 --> 03:02:19,269
but we can see compared to Sophia's
current

8918
03:02:19,269 --> 03:02:19,279
current
 

8919
03:02:19,279 --> 03:02:23,070
current
chatbot the Facebook deep neural chatbot

8920
03:02:23,070 --> 03:02:23,080
chatbot the Facebook deep neural chatbot
 

8921
03:02:23,080 --> 03:02:25,389
chatbot the Facebook deep neural chatbot
comes up with a wider variety of fluent

8922
03:02:25,389 --> 03:02:25,399
comes up with a wider variety of fluent
 

8923
03:02:25,399 --> 03:02:28,590
comes up with a wider variety of fluent
sounding sentences on the other hand it

8924
03:02:28,590 --> 03:02:28,600
sounding sentences on the other hand it
 

8925
03:02:28,600 --> 03:02:32,030
sounding sentences on the other hand it
Rambles like mad the Sophia chatbot it's

8926
03:02:32,030 --> 03:02:32,040
Rambles like mad the Sophia chatbot it's
 

8927
03:02:32,040 --> 03:02:34,550
Rambles like mad the Sophia chatbot it's
a little more repetitive in in the

8928
03:02:34,550 --> 03:02:34,560
a little more repetitive in in the
 

8929
03:02:34,560 --> 03:02:37,110
a little more repetitive in in the
sentence structures it uses on the other

8930
03:02:37,110 --> 03:02:37,120
sentence structures it uses on the other
 

8931
03:02:37,120 --> 03:02:38,830
sentence structures it uses on the other
hand it's able to keep like a

8932
03:02:38,830 --> 03:02:38,840
hand it's able to keep like a
 

8933
03:02:38,840 --> 03:02:41,309
hand it's able to keep like a
conversation Arc over a much longer

8934
03:02:41,309 --> 03:02:41,319
conversation Arc over a much longer
 

8935
03:02:41,319 --> 03:02:44,349
conversation Arc over a much longer
longer period right so there now you can

8936
03:02:44,349 --> 03:02:44,359
longer period right so there now you can
 

8937
03:02:44,359 --> 03:02:46,590
longer period right so there now you can
probably surmount that using reformer

8938
03:02:46,590 --> 03:02:46,600
probably surmount that using reformer
 

8939
03:02:46,600 --> 03:02:49,750
probably surmount that using reformer
and like using various deep neural

8940
03:02:49,750 --> 03:02:49,760
and like using various deep neural
 

8941
03:02:49,760 --> 03:02:52,070
and like using various deep neural
architectures and to improve the way

8942
03:02:52,070 --> 03:02:52,080
architectures and to improve the way
 

8943
03:02:52,080 --> 03:02:55,150
architectures and to improve the way
these Transformer models are trained

8944
03:02:55,150 --> 03:02:55,160
these Transformer models are trained
 

8945
03:02:55,160 --> 03:02:57,469
these Transformer models are trained
but in the end neither one of them

8946
03:02:57,469 --> 03:02:57,479
but in the end neither one of them
 

8947
03:02:57,479 --> 03:02:59,110
but in the end neither one of them
really understands what's going on and I

8948
03:02:59,110 --> 03:02:59,120
really understands what's going on and I
 

8949
03:02:59,120 --> 03:03:00,870
really understands what's going on and I
mean that's the challenge I

8950
03:03:00,870 --> 03:03:00,880
mean that's the challenge I
 

8951
03:03:00,880 --> 03:03:04,790
mean that's the challenge I
had with Sophia is if I were doing a

8952
03:03:04,790 --> 03:03:04,800
had with Sophia is if I were doing a
 

8953
03:03:04,800 --> 03:03:08,469
had with Sophia is if I were doing a
robotics project aimed at AGI I would

8954
03:03:08,469 --> 03:03:08,479
robotics project aimed at AGI I would
 

8955
03:03:08,479 --> 03:03:10,190
robotics project aimed at AGI I would
want to make like a robo toddler that

8956
03:03:10,190 --> 03:03:10,200
want to make like a robo toddler that
 

8957
03:03:10,200 --> 03:03:11,429
want to make like a robo toddler that
was just learning about what it was

8958
03:03:11,429 --> 03:03:11,439
was just learning about what it was
 

8959
03:03:11,439 --> 03:03:12,750
was just learning about what it was
seeing because then the language is

8960
03:03:12,750 --> 03:03:12,760
seeing because then the language is
 

8961
03:03:12,760 --> 03:03:14,910
seeing because then the language is
grounded in the experience of the robot

8962
03:03:14,910 --> 03:03:14,920
grounded in the experience of the robot
 

8963
03:03:14,920 --> 03:03:17,590
grounded in the experience of the robot
but what Sophia needs to do to be Sophia

8964
03:03:17,590 --> 03:03:17,600
but what Sophia needs to do to be Sophia
 

8965
03:03:17,600 --> 03:03:19,990
but what Sophia needs to do to be Sophia
is talk about sports or or the weather

8966
03:03:19,990 --> 03:03:20,000
is talk about sports or or the weather
 

8967
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:22,630
is talk about sports or or the weather
or or robotics or the conference she's

8968
03:03:22,630 --> 03:03:22,640
or or robotics or the conference she's
 

8969
03:03:22,640 --> 03:03:24,630
or or robotics or the conference she's
talking at like yeah she needs to be

8970
03:03:24,630 --> 03:03:24,640
talking at like yeah she needs to be
 

8971
03:03:24,640 --> 03:03:27,150
talking at like yeah she needs to be
fluent talking about any damn thing in

8972
03:03:27,150 --> 03:03:27,160
fluent talking about any damn thing in
 

8973
03:03:27,160 --> 03:03:30,110
fluent talking about any damn thing in
the world and she doesn't have grounding

8974
03:03:30,110 --> 03:03:30,120
the world and she doesn't have grounding
 

8975
03:03:30,120 --> 03:03:31,910
the world and she doesn't have grounding
for for all for all those all those

8976
03:03:31,910 --> 03:03:31,920
for for all for all those all those
 

8977
03:03:31,920 --> 03:03:34,510
for for all for all those all those
things so there's there's this just like

8978
03:03:34,510 --> 03:03:34,520
things so there's there's this just like
 

8979
03:03:34,520 --> 03:03:36,590
things so there's there's this just like
I mean Google Mina and Facebook's chap I

8980
03:03:36,590 --> 03:03:36,600
I mean Google Mina and Facebook's chap I
 

8981
03:03:36,600 --> 03:03:37,830
I mean Google Mina and Facebook's chap I
don't have grounding for what they're

8982
03:03:37,830 --> 03:03:37,840
don't have grounding for what they're
 

8983
03:03:37,840 --> 03:03:40,870
don't have grounding for what they're
talking about about either so in in a

8984
03:03:40,870 --> 03:03:40,880
talking about about either so in in a
 

8985
03:03:40,880 --> 03:03:44,590
talking about about either so in in a
way the need to speak fluently about

8986
03:03:44,590 --> 03:03:44,600
way the need to speak fluently about
 

8987
03:03:44,600 --> 03:03:46,590
way the need to speak fluently about
things where there's no non-linguistic

8988
03:03:46,590 --> 03:03:46,600
things where there's no non-linguistic
 

8989
03:03:46,600 --> 03:03:48,229
things where there's no non-linguistic
grounding

8990
03:03:48,229 --> 03:03:48,239
grounding
 

8991
03:03:48,239 --> 03:03:51,830
grounding
pushes what you can do for Sophia in the

8992
03:03:51,830 --> 03:03:51,840
pushes what you can do for Sophia in the
 

8993
03:03:51,840 --> 03:03:56,229
pushes what you can do for Sophia in the
short term a bit a bit away from uh from

8994
03:03:56,229 --> 03:03:56,239
short term a bit a bit away from uh from
 

8995
03:03:56,239 --> 03:03:58,950
short term a bit a bit away from uh from
I mean it pushes you towards uh IBM

8996
03:03:58,950 --> 03:03:58,960
I mean it pushes you towards uh IBM
 

8997
03:03:58,960 --> 03:04:01,710
I mean it pushes you towards uh IBM
Watson uh situation where you basically

8998
03:04:01,710 --> 03:04:01,720
Watson uh situation where you basically
 

8999
03:04:01,720 --> 03:04:03,510
Watson uh situation where you basically
have to do heuristic and hardcode stuff

9000
03:04:03,510 --> 03:04:03,520
have to do heuristic and hardcode stuff
 

9001
03:04:03,520 --> 03:04:06,429
have to do heuristic and hardcode stuff
and Rule based stuff I have to ask you

9002
03:04:06,429 --> 03:04:06,439
and Rule based stuff I have to ask you
 

9003
03:04:06,439 --> 03:04:08,550
and Rule based stuff I have to ask you
about this okay

9004
03:04:08,550 --> 03:04:08,560
about this okay
 

9005
03:04:08,560 --> 03:04:13,030
about this okay
so because uh you know in in part Sophia

9006
03:04:13,030 --> 03:04:13,040
so because uh you know in in part Sophia
 

9007
03:04:13,040 --> 03:04:14,190
so because uh you know in in part Sophia
is like

9008
03:04:14,190 --> 03:04:14,200
is like
 

9009
03:04:14,200 --> 03:04:19,469
is like
an uh is an art creation because it's

9010
03:04:19,469 --> 03:04:19,479
an uh is an art creation because it's
 

9011
03:04:19,479 --> 03:04:22,870
an uh is an art creation because it's
beautiful uh it's she's beautiful

9012
03:04:22,870 --> 03:04:22,880
beautiful uh it's she's beautiful
 

9013
03:04:22,880 --> 03:04:26,229
beautiful uh it's she's beautiful
because she inspires through our human

9014
03:04:26,229 --> 03:04:26,239
because she inspires through our human
 

9015
03:04:26,239 --> 03:04:29,710
because she inspires through our human
nature of uh anthropomorphize things we

9016
03:04:29,710 --> 03:04:29,720
nature of uh anthropomorphize things we
 

9017
03:04:29,720 --> 03:04:32,150
nature of uh anthropomorphize things we
immediately see an intelligent being

9018
03:04:32,150 --> 03:04:32,160
immediately see an intelligent being
 

9019
03:04:32,160 --> 03:04:34,070
immediately see an intelligent being
there because David is a great sculptor

9020
03:04:34,070 --> 03:04:34,080
there because David is a great sculptor
 

9021
03:04:34,080 --> 03:04:37,070
there because David is a great sculptor
is is great sculptor that's right so uh

9022
03:04:37,070 --> 03:04:37,080
is is great sculptor that's right so uh
 

9023
03:04:37,080 --> 03:04:39,750
is is great sculptor that's right so uh
in fact if Sophia just had nothing

9024
03:04:39,750 --> 03:04:39,760
in fact if Sophia just had nothing
 

9025
03:04:39,760 --> 03:04:42,309
in fact if Sophia just had nothing

important point I mean d David David is
 

9197
03:08:27,720 --> 03:08:30,750
important point I mean d David David is
an artistic uh Wild Man and that's

9198
03:08:30,750 --> 03:08:30,760
an artistic uh Wild Man and that's
 

9199
03:08:30,760 --> 03:08:33,349
an artistic uh Wild Man and that's
that's that that's part of his charm

9200
03:08:33,349 --> 03:08:33,359
that's that that's part of his charm
 

9201
03:08:33,359 --> 03:08:36,309
that's that that's part of his charm
that's that's part of his genius so

9202
03:08:36,309 --> 03:08:36,319
that's that's part of his genius so
 

9203
03:08:36,319 --> 03:08:39,309
that's that's part of his genius so
certainly there have been conversations

9204
03:08:39,309 --> 03:08:39,319
certainly there have been conversations
 

9205
03:08:39,319 --> 03:08:41,590
certainly there have been conversations
within Hansen Robotics and between me

9206
03:08:41,590 --> 03:08:41,600
within Hansen Robotics and between me
 

9207
03:08:41,600 --> 03:08:43,590
within Hansen Robotics and between me
and David where I was like

9208
03:08:43,590 --> 03:08:43,600
and David where I was like
 

9209
03:08:43,600 --> 03:08:46,469
and David where I was like
let's let's be more open about how this

9210
03:08:46,469 --> 03:08:46,479
let's let's be more open about how this
 

9211
03:08:46,479 --> 03:08:48,150
let's let's be more open about how this
thing is working

9212
03:08:48,150 --> 03:08:48,160
thing is working
 

9213
03:08:48,160 --> 03:08:50,550
thing is working
and I did have some influence in in

9214
03:08:50,550 --> 03:08:50,560
and I did have some influence in in
 

9215
03:08:50,560 --> 03:08:53,469
and I did have some influence in in
nudging Hansen robotics to be more open

9216
03:08:53,469 --> 03:08:53,479
nudging Hansen robotics to be more open
 

9217
03:08:53,479 --> 03:08:57,550
nudging Hansen robotics to be more open
about about how Sophia was working and

9218
03:08:57,550 --> 03:08:57,560
about about how Sophia was working and
 

9219
03:08:57,560 --> 03:09:00,469
about about how Sophia was working and
and David wasn't especially opposed to

9220
03:09:00,469 --> 03:09:00,479
and David wasn't especially opposed to
 

9221
03:09:00,479 --> 03:09:01,870
and David wasn't especially opposed to
this and you know he was actually quite

9222
03:09:01,870 --> 03:09:01,880
this and you know he was actually quite
 

9223
03:09:01,880 --> 03:09:03,910
this and you know he was actually quite
right about it what he said was you can

9224
03:09:03,910 --> 03:09:03,920
right about it what he said was you can
 

9225
03:09:03,920 --> 03:09:06,150
right about it what he said was you can
tell people exactly how it's

9226
03:09:06,150 --> 03:09:06,160
tell people exactly how it's
 

9227
03:09:06,160 --> 03:09:08,309
tell people exactly how it's
working and they won't care they want to

9228
03:09:08,309 --> 03:09:08,319
working and they won't care they want to
 

9229
03:09:08,319 --> 03:09:10,590
working and they won't care they want to
be drawn into the illusion and he was

9230
03:09:10,590 --> 03:09:10,600
be drawn into the illusion and he was
 

9231
03:09:10,600 --> 03:09:13,590
be drawn into the illusion and he was
100% 100% correct I'll tell you what

9232
03:09:13,590 --> 03:09:13,600
100% 100% correct I'll tell you what
 

9233
03:09:13,600 --> 03:09:15,190
100% 100% correct I'll tell you what
yeah this wasn't Sophia this was Philip

9234
03:09:15,190 --> 03:09:15,200
yeah this wasn't Sophia this was Philip
 

9235
03:09:15,200 --> 03:09:18,309
yeah this wasn't Sophia this was Philip
K dick but we did some actions between

9236
03:09:18,309 --> 03:09:18,319
K dick but we did some actions between
 

9237
03:09:18,319 --> 03:09:20,790
K dick but we did some actions between
humans and Philip KCK

9238
03:09:20,790 --> 03:09:20,800
humans and Philip KCK
 

9239
03:09:20,800 --> 03:09:23,790

robot in Austin Texas a few years back

9240
03:09:23,790 --> 03:09:23,800
robot in Austin Texas a few years back
 

9241
03:09:23,800 --> 03:09:25,830
robot in Austin Texas a few years back
and in this case the Philip KCK was just

9242
03:09:25,830 --> 03:09:25,840
and in this case the Philip KCK was just
 

9243
03:09:25,840 --> 03:09:27,510
and in this case the Philip KCK was just
teleoperated by another human in the

9244
03:09:27,510 --> 03:09:27,520
teleoperated by another human in the
 

9245
03:09:27,520 --> 03:09:30,309
teleoperated by another human in the
other room so during the conversations

9246
03:09:30,309 --> 03:09:30,319
other room so during the conversations
 

9247
03:09:30,319 --> 03:09:31,750
other room so during the conversations
we didn't tell people the robot was

9248
03:09:31,750 --> 03:09:31,760
we didn't tell people the robot was
 

9249
03:09:31,760 --> 03:09:33,670
we didn't tell people the robot was
teleoperated we just said here have a

9250
03:09:33,670 --> 03:09:33,680
teleoperated we just said here have a
 

9251
03:09:33,680 --> 03:09:35,630
teleoperated we just said here have a
conversation with Phil dick we're going

9252
03:09:35,630 --> 03:09:35,640
conversation with Phil dick we're going
 

9253
03:09:35,640 --> 03:09:37,750
conversation with Phil dick we're going
to film you right and they had a great

operated by my friend Stan buy after the

9258
03:09:43,670 --> 03:09:43,680
operated by my friend Stan buy after the
 

9259
03:09:43,680 --> 03:09:45,830
operated by my friend Stan buy after the
conversation we brought the people in

9260
03:09:45,830 --> 03:09:45,840
conversation we brought the people in
 

9261
03:09:45,840 --> 03:09:49,229
conversation we brought the people in
the back room to see Stefan who was

9262
03:09:49,229 --> 03:09:49,239
the back room to see Stefan who was
 

9263
03:09:49,239 --> 03:09:51,510
the back room to see Stefan who was
controlling the the the the Philip K

9264
03:09:51,510 --> 03:09:51,520
controlling the the the the Philip K
 

9265
03:09:51,520 --> 03:09:54,750
controlling the the the the Philip K
dick robot but they didn't believe it

9266
03:09:54,750 --> 03:09:54,760
dick robot but they didn't believe it
 

9267
03:09:54,760 --> 03:09:56,710
dick robot but they didn't believe it
these people were like well yeah but I

9268
03:09:56,710 --> 03:09:56,720
these people were like well yeah but I
 

9269
03:09:56,720 --> 03:09:59,030
these people were like well yeah but I
know I was talking to Phil like maybe

9270
03:09:59,030 --> 03:09:59,040
know I was talking to Phil like maybe
 

9271
03:09:59,040 --> 03:10:02,190
know I was talking to Phil like maybe
Stefan was typing but the spirit of Phil

9272
03:10:02,190 --> 03:10:02,200
Stefan was typing but the spirit of Phil
 

9273
03:10:02,200 --> 03:10:04,229
Stefan was typing but the spirit of Phil
was animating his mind while he was

9274
03:10:04,229 --> 03:10:04,239
was animating his mind while he was
 

9275
03:10:04,239 --> 03:10:05,830
was animating his mind while he was
typing yeah so like even though they

9276
03:10:05,830 --> 03:10:05,840
typing yeah so like even though they
 

9277
03:10:05,840 --> 03:10:08,309
typing yeah so like even though they
knew was a human in the loop even seeing

9278
03:10:08,309 --> 03:10:08,319
knew was a human in the loop even seeing
 

9279
03:10:08,319 --> 03:10:10,429
knew was a human in the loop even seeing
the guy there they still believe that

9280
03:10:10,429 --> 03:10:10,439
the guy there they still believe that
 

9281
03:10:10,439 --> 03:10:13,309
the guy there they still believe that
was Phil they were talking to a small

9282
03:10:13,309 --> 03:10:13,319
was Phil they were talking to a small
 

9283
03:10:13,319 --> 03:10:15,670
was Phil they were talking to a small
part of me believes that they were right

9284
03:10:15,670 --> 03:10:15,680
part of me believes that they were right
 

9285
03:10:15,680 --> 03:10:18,070
part of me believes that they were right
actually because our understand well we

9286
03:10:18,070 --> 03:10:18,080
actually because our understand well we
 

9287
03:10:18,080 --> 03:10:19,830
actually because our understand well we
don't understand the universe right I

9288
03:10:19,830 --> 03:10:19,840
don't understand the universe right I
 

9289
03:10:19,840 --> 03:10:22,550
don't understand the universe right I
mean there is a cosmic mind field that

9290
03:10:22,550 --> 03:10:22,560
mean there is a cosmic mind field that
 

9291
03:10:22,560 --> 03:10:25,670
mean there is a cosmic mind field that
we're all embedded in that yields many

9292
03:10:25,670 --> 03:10:25,680
we're all embedded in that yields many
 

9293
03:10:25,680 --> 03:10:27,870
we're all embedded in that yields many
strange synchronicities in in in in the

9294
03:10:27,870 --> 03:10:27,880
strange synchronicities in in in in the
 

9295
03:10:27,880 --> 03:10:29,910
strange synchronicities in in in in the
world which is a topic we don't have

9296
03:10:29,910 --> 03:10:29,920
world which is a topic we don't have
 

9297
03:10:29,920 --> 03:10:31,910
world which is a topic we don't have
time to go into too much here I mean

9298
03:10:31,910 --> 03:10:31,920
time to go into too much here I mean
 

9299
03:10:31,920 --> 03:10:33,309
time to go into too much here I mean
there there's there's some nature

9300
03:10:33,309 --> 03:10:33,319
there there's there's some nature
 

9301
03:10:33,319 --> 03:10:35,710
there there's there's some nature
there's something to this

9302
03:10:35,710 --> 03:10:35,720
there's something to this
 

9303
03:10:35,720 --> 03:10:39,870
there's something to this
where uh our imagination about Sophia

9304
03:10:39,870 --> 03:10:39,880
where uh our imagination about Sophia
 

9305
03:10:39,880 --> 03:10:42,710

and people Yan Lon being frustrated
 

9307
03:10:42,720 --> 03:10:45,269
and people Yan Lon being frustrated
about it is all part of this beautiful

see with Boston Dynamics I'm a huge fan

9314
03:10:51,309 --> 03:10:51,319
see with Boston Dynamics I'm a huge fan
 

9315
03:10:51,319 --> 03:10:54,309
see with Boston Dynamics I'm a huge fan
of uh as well you know the kind of I

9316
03:10:54,309 --> 03:10:54,319
of uh as well you know the kind of I
 

9317
03:10:54,319 --> 03:10:57,110
of uh as well you know the kind of I
mean these robots are very far from

9318
03:10:57,110 --> 03:10:57,120
mean these robots are very far from

03:11:03,110 --> 03:11:03,120
actually with the spot mini yeah very
 

9325
03:11:03,120 --> 03:11:05,309
actually with the spot mini yeah very
cool I mean it it reacts quite in a

9326
03:11:05,309 --> 03:11:05,319
cool I mean it it reacts quite in a
 

9327
03:11:05,319 --> 03:11:07,630
cool I mean it it reacts quite in a
fluid and and flexible way right but we

there's there's a timeline editor which
 

9387
03:12:16,840 --> 03:12:18,710
there's there's a timeline editor which
is like a rule-based authoring system

9388
03:12:18,710 --> 03:12:18,720
is like a rule-based authoring system
 

9389
03:12:18,720 --> 03:12:20,990
is like a rule-based authoring system
where she's really just being an outlet

9390
03:12:20,990 --> 03:12:21,000
where she's really just being an outlet
 

9391

9392
03:12:22,950 --> 03:12:22,960
for what a human scripted there's a
 

9393
03:12:22,960 --> 03:12:24,790
for what a human scripted there's a
chatbot which has some rule-based and

9394
03:12:24,790 --> 03:12:24,800
chatbot which has some rule-based and
 

9395
03:12:24,800 --> 03:12:27,590
chatbot which has some rule-based and
some neural aspects and then sometimes

9396
03:12:27,590 --> 03:12:27,600
some neural aspects and then sometimes
 

9397
03:12:27,600 --> 03:12:29,510
some neural aspects and then sometimes
we've used opencog behind Sophia where

9398
03:12:29,510 --> 03:12:29,520
we've used opencog behind Sophia where
 

9399
03:12:29,520 --> 03:12:30,990
we've used opencog behind Sophia where
there's more learning learning and

9400
03:12:30,990 --> 03:12:31,000
there's more learning learning and
 

9401
03:12:31,000 --> 03:12:34,070
there's more learning learning and
reasoning and you know the funny thing

9402
03:12:34,070 --> 03:12:34,080
reasoning and you know the funny thing
 

9403
03:12:34,080 --> 03:12:36,550
reasoning and you know the funny thing
is I can't always tell which system is

9404
03:12:36,550 --> 03:12:36,560
is I can't always tell which system is
 

9405
03:12:36,560 --> 03:12:39,229
is I can't always tell which system is
operating here right I mean so when she

9406
03:12:39,229 --> 03:12:39,239
operating here right I mean so when she
 

9407
03:12:39,239 --> 03:12:41,309
operating here right I mean so when she
whether she's really learning yeah or

9408
03:12:41,309 --> 03:12:41,319
whether she's really learning yeah or
 

9409
03:12:41,319 --> 03:12:43,590
whether she's really learning yeah or
thinking or or just appears to be over

9410
03:12:43,590 --> 03:12:43,600
thinking or or just appears to be over
 

9411
03:12:43,600 --> 03:12:45,750
thinking or or just appears to be over
half hour I could tell but over like 3

9412
03:12:45,750 --> 03:12:45,760
half hour I could tell but over like 3
 

9413
03:12:45,760 --> 03:12:48,750
half hour I could tell but over like 3
or 4 minutes of interaction I I so even

9414
03:12:48,750 --> 03:12:48,760
or 4 minutes of interaction I I so even
 

9415
03:12:48,760 --> 03:12:50,389
or 4 minutes of interaction I I so even
having three systems that's already

9416
03:12:50,389 --> 03:12:50,399
having three systems that's already
 

9417
03:12:50,399 --> 03:12:51,910
having three systems that's already
sufficiently complex where you can't

9418
03:12:51,910 --> 03:12:51,920
sufficiently complex where you can't
 

9419
03:12:51,920 --> 03:12:54,750
sufficiently complex where you can't
really tell right away yeah the thing is

9420
03:12:54,750 --> 03:12:54,760
really tell right away yeah the thing is
 

9421
03:12:54,760 --> 03:12:57,429
really tell right away yeah the thing is
even if you get up on stage and tell

9422
03:12:57,429 --> 03:12:57,439
even if you get up on stage and tell
 

9423
03:12:57,439 --> 03:12:59,830
even if you get up on stage and tell
people how Sophia is working and then

9424
03:12:59,830 --> 03:12:59,840
people how Sophia is working and then
 

9425
03:12:59,840 --> 03:13:03,389
people how Sophia is working and then
they talk to her they still attribute

9426
03:13:03,389 --> 03:13:03,399
they talk to her they still attribute
 

9427
03:13:03,399 --> 03:13:06,150
they talk to her they still attribute
more agency and Consciousness to her

9428
03:13:06,150 --> 03:13:06,160
more agency and Consciousness to her
 

9429
03:13:06,160 --> 03:13:09,150
more agency and Consciousness to her
than than is is is really there so I

9430
03:13:09,150 --> 03:13:09,160
than than is is is really there so I
 

9431
03:13:09,160 --> 03:13:11,990
than than is is is really there so I
think there's there's a couple levels of

9432
03:13:11,990 --> 03:13:12,000
think there's there's a couple levels of
 

9433
03:13:12,000 --> 03:13:15,830
think there's there's a couple levels of
ethical issue there one issue is should

9434
03:13:15,830 --> 03:13:15,840
ethical issue there one issue is should
 

9435
03:13:15,840 --> 03:13:20,150
ethical issue there one issue is should
you be transparent about how Sophia is

9436
03:13:20,150 --> 03:13:20,160
you be transparent about how Sophia is
 

9437
03:13:20,160 --> 03:13:23,030
you be transparent about how Sophia is
is working and I think you should and

9438
03:13:23,030 --> 03:13:23,040
is working and I think you should and
 

9439
03:13:23,040 --> 03:13:26,229
is working and I think you should and
and I think I think we we have been I

9440
03:13:26,229 --> 03:13:26,239
and I think I think we we have been I
 

9441
03:13:26,239 --> 03:13:28,950
and I think I think we we have been I
mean I mean it's there's articles online

9442
03:13:28,950 --> 03:13:28,960
mean I mean it's there's articles online
 

9443
03:13:28,960 --> 03:13:32,030
mean I mean it's there's articles online
that there's some TV special that goes

9444
03:13:32,030 --> 03:13:32,040
that there's some TV special that goes
 

9445
03:13:32,040 --> 03:13:33,790
that there's some TV special that goes
through me explaining the three

9446
03:13:33,790 --> 03:13:33,800
through me explaining the three
 

9447
03:13:33,800 --> 03:13:36,550
through me explaining the three
subsystems behind Sophia so the way

9448
03:13:36,550 --> 03:13:36,560
subsystems behind Sophia so the way
 

9449
03:13:36,560 --> 03:13:41,070
subsystems behind Sophia so the way
Sophia works is is out there much more

9450
03:13:41,070 --> 03:13:41,080
Sophia works is is out there much more
 

9451
03:13:41,080 --> 03:13:42,870
Sophia works is is out there much more
clearly than how Facebook say I works or

9452
03:13:42,870 --> 03:13:42,880
clearly than how Facebook say I works or
 

9453
03:13:42,880 --> 03:13:44,349
clearly than how Facebook say I works or
something right I mean we've been fairly

9454
03:13:44,349 --> 03:13:44,359
something right I mean we've been fairly
 

9455
03:13:44,359 --> 03:13:47,830
something right I mean we've been fairly
explicit about it the other is

9456
03:13:47,830 --> 03:13:47,840
explicit about it the other is
 

9457
03:13:47,840 --> 03:13:50,550
explicit about it the other is
given that telling people how it works

9458
03:13:50,550 --> 03:13:50,560
given that telling people how it works
 

9459
03:13:50,560 --> 03:13:52,510
given that telling people how it works
doesn't cause them to not attribute too

9460
03:13:52,510 --> 03:13:52,520
doesn't cause them to not attribute too
 

9461
03:13:52,520 --> 03:13:54,670
doesn't cause them to not attribute too
much intelligence agency to it anyway

9462
03:13:54,670 --> 03:13:54,680
much intelligence agency to it anyway
 

9463
03:13:54,680 --> 03:13:58,269
much intelligence agency to it anyway
then then should you keep fooling them

9464
03:13:58,269 --> 03:13:58,279
then then should you keep fooling them
 

9465
03:13:58,279 --> 03:14:01,590
then then should you keep fooling them
when they want to be fooled and I mean

give them a good user experience with
 

9481
03:14:22,120 --> 03:14:25,990
give them a good user experience with
helpful robots and so that we can we can

9482
03:14:25,990 --> 03:14:26,000
helpful robots and so that we can we can
 

9483
03:14:26,000 --> 03:14:28,870
helpful robots and so that we can we can
fill the ai's mind with love and

9487
03:14:31,040 --> 03:14:33,349
compassion so I've been I've been
talking a lot with Hansen robotics

9488
03:14:33,349 --> 03:14:33,359
talking a lot with Hansen robotics
 

9489
03:14:33,359 --> 03:14:35,870
talking a lot with Hansen robotics
lately about collaborations in the area

9490
03:14:35,870 --> 03:14:35,880
lately about collaborations in the area
 

9491
03:14:35,880 --> 03:14:39,190
lately about collaborations in the area
of of medical Robotics and we we haven't

9492
03:14:39,190 --> 03:14:39,200
of of medical Robotics and we we haven't
 

9493
03:14:39,200 --> 03:14:41,550
of of medical Robotics and we we haven't
quite pulled the trigger on a project in

9494
03:14:41,550 --> 03:14:41,560
quite pulled the trigger on a project in
 

9495
03:14:41,560 --> 03:14:43,830
quite pulled the trigger on a project in
that domain yet but we we may well do so

9496
03:14:43,830 --> 03:14:43,840
that domain yet but we we may well do so
 

9497
03:14:43,840 --> 03:14:46,030
that domain yet but we we may well do so
quite soon so we've been we've been

9498
03:14:46,030 --> 03:14:46,040
quite soon so we've been we've been
 

9499
03:14:46,040 --> 03:14:48,269
quite soon so we've been we've been
talking a lot about you know robots can

9500
03:14:48,269 --> 03:14:48,279
talking a lot about you know robots can
 

9501
03:14:48,279 --> 03:14:50,510
talking a lot about you know robots can
help with with elder care robots can

9502
03:14:50,510 --> 03:14:50,520
help with with elder care robots can
 

9503
03:14:50,520 --> 03:14:52,070
help with with elder care robots can
help with kids David's done a lot of

9504
03:14:52,070 --> 03:14:52,080
help with kids David's done a lot of
 

9505
03:14:52,080 --> 03:14:54,870
help with kids David's done a lot of
things with h with autism therapy and

9506
03:14:54,870 --> 03:14:54,880
things with h with autism therapy and
 

9507
03:14:54,880 --> 03:14:57,790
things with h with autism therapy and
robots robots before in the co era

9508
03:14:57,790 --> 03:14:57,800
robots robots before in the co era
 

9509
03:14:57,800 --> 03:14:59,429
robots robots before in the co era
having a robot that can be a nursing

9510
03:14:59,429 --> 03:14:59,439
having a robot that can be a nursing
 

9511
03:14:59,439 --> 03:15:01,229
having a robot that can be a nursing
assistant in various senses can be quite

9512
03:15:01,229 --> 03:15:01,239
assistant in various senses can be quite
 

9513
03:15:01,239 --> 03:15:03,269
assistant in various senses can be quite
valuable the robots don't spread

9514
03:15:03,269 --> 03:15:03,279
valuable the robots don't spread
 

9515
03:15:03,279 --> 03:15:05,550
valuable the robots don't spread
infection and they they can also deliver

9516
03:15:05,550 --> 03:15:05,560
infection and they they can also deliver
 

9517
03:15:05,560 --> 03:15:07,389
infection and they they can also deliver
more attention than human nurses can

9518
03:15:07,389 --> 03:15:07,399
more attention than human nurses can
 

9519
03:15:07,399 --> 03:15:10,070
more attention than human nurses can
give right so if you have a robot that's

9520
03:15:10,070 --> 03:15:10,080
give right so if you have a robot that's
 

9521
03:15:10,080 --> 03:15:12,870
give right so if you have a robot that's
helping a patient with covid if that

9522
03:15:12,870 --> 03:15:12,880
helping a patient with covid if that
 

9523
03:15:12,880 --> 03:15:15,590
helping a patient with covid if that
patient attributes more understanding

9524
03:15:15,590 --> 03:15:15,600
patient attributes more understanding
 

9525
03:15:15,600 --> 03:15:17,349
patient attributes more understanding
and compassion and agency into that

9526
03:15:17,349 --> 03:15:17,359
and compassion and agency into that
 

9527
03:15:17,359 --> 03:15:19,389
and compassion and agency into that
robot than it really has because it

9528
03:15:19,389 --> 03:15:19,399
robot than it really has because it
 

9529
03:15:19,399 --> 03:15:22,510
robot than it really has because it
looks like a human I mean is that really

9530
03:15:22,510 --> 03:15:22,520
looks like a human I mean is that really
 

9531
03:15:22,520 --> 03:15:24,110
looks like a human I mean is that really
bad I mean we can tell them it doesn't

9532
03:15:24,110 --> 03:15:24,120
bad I mean we can tell them it doesn't
 

9533
03:15:24,120 --> 03:15:26,469
bad I mean we can tell them it doesn't
fully understand you and and they don't

9534
03:15:26,469 --> 03:15:26,479
fully understand you and and they don't
 

9535
03:15:26,479 --> 03:15:27,870
fully understand you and and they don't
care because they're lying there with a

9536
03:15:27,870 --> 03:15:27,880
care because they're lying there with a
 

9537
03:15:27,880 --> 03:15:29,870
care because they're lying there with a
fever and they're sick but they'll react

9538
03:15:29,870 --> 03:15:29,880
fever and they're sick but they'll react
 

9539
03:15:29,880 --> 03:15:31,510
fever and they're sick but they'll react
better to that robot with its loving

9540
03:15:31,510 --> 03:15:31,520
better to that robot with its loving
 

9541
03:15:31,520 --> 03:15:34,110
better to that robot with its loving
warm facial expression than they would

9542
03:15:34,110 --> 03:15:34,120
warm facial expression than they would
 

9543
03:15:34,120 --> 03:15:36,469
warm facial expression than they would
to a pepper robot or or a metallic

9544
03:15:36,469 --> 03:15:36,479
to a pepper robot or or a metallic
 

9545
03:15:36,479 --> 03:15:39,030
to a pepper robot or or a metallic
looking looking robot so it's it's

9546
03:15:39,030 --> 03:15:39,040
looking looking robot so it's it's
 

9547
03:15:39,040 --> 03:15:41,269
looking looking robot so it's it's
really it's about how you use it right

9548
03:15:41,269 --> 03:15:41,279
really it's about how you use it right
 

9549
03:15:41,279 --> 03:15:43,710
really it's about how you use it right
if you made a human looking like doorto

9550
03:15:43,710 --> 03:15:43,720
if you made a human looking like doorto
 

9551
03:15:43,720 --> 03:15:46,229
if you made a human looking like doorto
door sales robot that used its its human

9552
03:15:46,229 --> 03:15:46,239
door sales robot that used its its human
 

9553
03:15:46,239 --> 03:15:48,790
door sales robot that used its its human
looking appearance to to scam people out

9554
03:15:48,790 --> 03:15:48,800
looking appearance to to scam people out
 

9555
03:15:48,800 --> 03:15:50,710
looking appearance to to scam people out
of their money yeah then you're using

9556
03:15:50,710 --> 03:15:50,720
of their money yeah then you're using
 

9557
03:15:50,720 --> 03:15:53,990
of their money yeah then you're using
that that connection in in a bad way but

9558
03:15:53,990 --> 03:15:54,000
that that connection in in a bad way but
 

9559
03:15:54,000 --> 03:15:55,870
that that connection in in a bad way but
you you could also use it in in a in a

9560
03:15:55,870 --> 03:15:55,880
you you could also use it in in a in a
 

9561
03:15:55,880 --> 03:15:58,269
you you could also use it in in a in a
good way and that but then that's the

9562
03:15:58,269 --> 03:15:58,279
good way and that but then that's the
 

9563
03:15:58,279 --> 03:16:00,150
good way and that but then that's the
same the same problem with every

9564
03:16:00,150 --> 03:16:00,160
same the same problem with every
 

9565
03:16:00,160 --> 03:16:04,229
same the same problem with every
technology right beautifully put so like

9566
03:16:04,229 --> 03:16:04,239
technology right beautifully put so like
 

9567
03:16:04,239 --> 03:16:07,790
technology right beautifully put so like
you said uh we're living in uh the era

9568
03:16:07,790 --> 03:16:07,800
you said uh we're living in uh the era
 

9569
03:16:07,800 --> 03:16:11,269
you said uh we're living in uh the era
of the covid This Is 2020 one of the

9570
03:16:11,269 --> 03:16:11,279
of the covid This Is 2020 one of the
 

9571
03:16:11,279 --> 03:16:15,389
of the covid This Is 2020 one of the
craziest years uh in recent history so

9572
03:16:15,389 --> 03:16:15,399
craziest years uh in recent history so
 

9573
03:16:15,399 --> 03:16:17,550
craziest years uh in recent history so
uh

9574
03:16:17,550 --> 03:16:17,560
uh
 

9575
03:16:17,560 --> 03:16:20,189
uh
if if we zoom out and look at this

9576
03:16:20,189 --> 03:16:20,199
if if we zoom out and look at this
 

9577
03:16:20,199 --> 03:16:23,269
if if we zoom out and look at this
pandemic uh the Corona virus

9578
03:16:23,269 --> 03:16:23,279
pandemic uh the Corona virus
 

9579
03:16:23,279 --> 03:16:25,710
pandemic uh the Corona virus
pandemic maybe let me ask you this kind

9580
03:16:25,710 --> 03:16:25,720
pandemic maybe let me ask you this kind
 

9581
03:16:25,720 --> 03:16:29,910
pandemic maybe let me ask you this kind
of thing in in viruses in general when

9582
03:16:29,910 --> 03:16:29,920
of thing in in viruses in general when
 

9583
03:16:29,920 --> 03:16:33,710
of thing in in viruses in general when
you look at viruses do you see them as

9584
03:16:33,710 --> 03:16:33,720
you look at viruses do you see them as
 

9585
03:16:33,720 --> 03:16:36,269
you look at viruses do you see them as
as a kind of intelligence system I think

9586
03:16:36,269 --> 03:16:36,279
as a kind of intelligence system I think
 

9587
03:16:36,279 --> 03:16:38,189
as a kind of intelligence system I think
the concept of intelligence is not that

9588
03:16:38,189 --> 03:16:38,199
the concept of intelligence is not that
 

9589
03:16:38,199 --> 03:16:40,590
the concept of intelligence is not that
natural of a concept in the end I mean I

9590
03:16:40,590 --> 03:16:40,600
natural of a concept in the end I mean I
 

9591
03:16:40,600 --> 03:16:43,950
natural of a concept in the end I mean I
I think human minds and bodies are a

9592
03:16:43,950 --> 03:16:43,960
I think human minds and bodies are a
 

9593
03:16:43,960 --> 03:16:48,510
I think human minds and bodies are a
kind of complex self organizing adaptive

9594
03:16:48,510 --> 03:16:48,520
kind of complex self organizing adaptive
 

9595
03:16:48,520 --> 03:16:51,670
kind of complex self organizing adaptive
system and viruses certainly are that

9596
03:16:51,670 --> 03:16:51,680
system and viruses certainly are that
 

9597
03:16:51,680 --> 03:16:52,790
system and viruses certainly are that
right they're a very complex

9598
03:16:52,790 --> 03:16:52,800
right they're a very complex
 

9599
03:16:52,800 --> 03:16:55,150
right they're a very complex
self-organizing adaptive system if you

9600
03:16:55,150 --> 03:16:55,160
self-organizing adaptive system if you
 

9601
03:16:55,160 --> 03:16:56,870
self-organizing adaptive system if you
want to look at intelligence as as

9602
03:16:56,870 --> 03:16:56,880
want to look at intelligence as as
 

9603
03:16:56,880 --> 03:16:59,750
want to look at intelligence as as
Marcus Hooter defines it as sort of

9604
03:16:59,750 --> 03:16:59,760
Marcus Hooter defines it as sort of
 

9605
03:16:59,760 --> 03:17:02,189
Marcus Hooter defines it as sort of
optimizing computable reward functions

9606
03:17:02,189 --> 03:17:02,199
optimizing computable reward functions
 

9607
03:17:02,199 --> 03:17:03,630
optimizing computable reward functions
over computable

9608
03:17:03,630 --> 03:17:03,640
over computable
 

9609
03:17:03,640 --> 03:17:06,030
over computable
environments for sure viruses are doing

9610
03:17:06,030 --> 03:17:06,040
environments for sure viruses are doing
 

9611
03:17:06,040 --> 03:17:10,110
environments for sure viruses are doing
that right and and I mean in in in doing

9612
03:17:10,110 --> 03:17:10,120
that right and and I mean in in in doing
 

9613
03:17:10,120 --> 03:17:11,950
that right and and I mean in in in doing
so they're they're causing some some

9614
03:17:11,950 --> 03:17:11,960
so they're they're causing some some
 

9615
03:17:11,960 --> 03:17:14,830
so they're they're causing some some
harm to us and that so there there you

9616
03:17:14,830 --> 03:17:14,840
harm to us and that so there there you
 

9617
03:17:14,840 --> 03:17:17,229
harm to us and that so there there you
know the human immune system is a very

9618
03:17:17,229 --> 03:17:17,239
know the human immune system is a very
 

9619
03:17:17,239 --> 03:17:19,269
know the human immune system is a very
complex self organizing adaptive system

9620
03:17:19,269 --> 03:17:19,279
complex self organizing adaptive system
 

9621
03:17:19,279 --> 03:17:21,389
complex self organizing adaptive system
which has a lot of intelligence to it

9622
03:17:21,389 --> 03:17:21,399
which has a lot of intelligence to it
 

9623
03:17:21,399 --> 03:17:24,030
which has a lot of intelligence to it
and viruses are also adapting and

9624
03:17:24,030 --> 03:17:24,040
and viruses are also adapting and
 

9625
03:17:24,040 --> 03:17:26,950
and viruses are also adapting and
dividing into new Mutant strains and and

9626
03:17:26,950 --> 03:17:26,960
dividing into new Mutant strains and and
 

9627
03:17:26,960 --> 03:17:29,150
dividing into new Mutant strains and and
and so forth and ultimately the solution

9628
03:17:29,150 --> 03:17:29,160
and so forth and ultimately the solution
 

9629
03:17:29,160 --> 03:17:31,950
and so forth and ultimately the solution
is going to be nanotechnology right I

9630
03:17:31,950 --> 03:17:31,960
is going to be nanotechnology right I
 

9631
03:17:31,960 --> 03:17:33,670
is going to be nanotechnology right I
mean I mean the solution is going to be

9632
03:17:33,670 --> 03:17:33,680
mean I mean the solution is going to be
 

9633
03:17:33,680 --> 03:17:36,429
mean I mean the solution is going to be
making little Nanobots that fight the

9634
03:17:36,429 --> 03:17:36,439
making little Nanobots that fight the
 

9635
03:17:36,439 --> 03:17:39,349
making little Nanobots that fight the
viruses or well people will use them to

9636
03:17:39,349 --> 03:17:39,359
viruses or well people will use them to
 

9637
03:17:39,359 --> 03:17:41,309
viruses or well people will use them to
make nastier viruses but hopefully we

9638
03:17:41,309 --> 03:17:41,319
make nastier viruses but hopefully we
 

9639
03:17:41,319 --> 03:17:44,349
make nastier viruses but hopefully we
can also use them to just detect combat

9640
03:17:44,349 --> 03:17:44,359
can also use them to just detect combat
 

9641
03:17:44,359 --> 03:17:47,670
can also use them to just detect combat
and and kill the viruses but I think

9642
03:17:47,670 --> 03:17:47,680
and and kill the viruses but I think
 

9643
03:17:47,680 --> 03:17:51,630
and and kill the viruses but I think
now now we're stuck with the biological

9644
03:17:51,630 --> 03:17:51,640
now now we're stuck with the biological
 

9645
03:17:51,640 --> 03:17:54,309
now now we're stuck with the biological
uh mechanisms to to combat these these

9646
03:17:54,309 --> 03:17:54,319
uh mechanisms to to combat these these
 

9647
03:17:54,319 --> 03:17:56,550
uh mechanisms to to combat these these
viruses and yeah know we've

9648
03:17:56,550 --> 03:17:56,560
viruses and yeah know we've
 

9649
03:17:56,560 --> 03:18:00,670
viruses and yeah know we've
been AGI is not yet mature enough to use

9650
03:18:00,670 --> 03:18:00,680
been AGI is not yet mature enough to use
 

9651
03:18:00,680 --> 03:18:03,510
been AGI is not yet mature enough to use
against Co but we've been using machine

9652
03:18:03,510 --> 03:18:03,520
against Co but we've been using machine
 

9653
03:18:03,520 --> 03:18:05,389
against Co but we've been using machine
learning and also some machine reasoning

9654
03:18:05,389 --> 03:18:05,399
learning and also some machine reasoning
 

9655
03:18:05,399 --> 03:18:09,389
learning and also some machine reasoning
in in opencog to help some doctors to do

9656
03:18:09,389 --> 03:18:09,399
in in opencog to help some doctors to do
 

9657
03:18:09,399 --> 03:18:11,150
in in opencog to help some doctors to do
personalized medicine against covid so

9658
03:18:11,150 --> 03:18:11,160
personalized medicine against covid so
 

9659
03:18:11,160 --> 03:18:13,349
personalized medicine against covid so
the problem there is given a person's

9660
03:18:13,349 --> 03:18:13,359
the problem there is given a person's
 

9661
03:18:13,359 --> 03:18:14,990
the problem there is given a person's
genomics and given their clinical

9662
03:18:14,990 --> 03:18:15,000
genomics and given their clinical
 

9663
03:18:15,000 --> 03:18:17,229
genomics and given their clinical
medical indicators how do you figure out

9664
03:18:17,229 --> 03:18:17,239
medical indicators how do you figure out
 

9665
03:18:17,239 --> 03:18:20,389
medical indicators how do you figure out
which combination of antivirals is going

9666
03:18:20,389 --> 03:18:20,399
which combination of antivirals is going
 

9667
03:18:20,399 --> 03:18:22,830
which combination of antivirals is going
to be most effective against covid for

9668
03:18:22,830 --> 03:18:22,840
to be most effective against covid for
 

9669
03:18:22,840 --> 03:18:25,389
to be most effective against covid for
for that person and so that that's

9670
03:18:25,389 --> 03:18:25,399
for that person and so that that's
 

9671
03:18:25,399 --> 03:18:27,510
for that person and so that that's
something where machine learning is

9672
03:18:27,510 --> 03:18:27,520
something where machine learning is
 

9673
03:18:27,520 --> 03:18:29,590
something where machine learning is
interesting but also we're finding the

9674
03:18:29,590 --> 03:18:29,600
interesting but also we're finding the
 

9675
03:18:29,600 --> 03:18:31,469
interesting but also we're finding the
abstraction we get an open Cog with

9676
03:18:31,469 --> 03:18:31,479
abstraction we get an open Cog with
 

9677
03:18:31,479 --> 03:18:33,910
abstraction we get an open Cog with
machine reasoning is interesting because

9678
03:18:33,910 --> 03:18:33,920
machine reasoning is interesting because
 

9679
03:18:33,920 --> 03:18:36,830
machine reasoning is interesting because
it can help with transfer learning when

9680
03:18:36,830 --> 03:18:36,840
it can help with transfer learning when
 

9681
03:18:36,840 --> 03:18:39,510
it can help with transfer learning when
you have not that many different cases

9682
03:18:39,510 --> 03:18:39,520
you have not that many different cases
 

9683
03:18:39,520 --> 03:18:42,309
you have not that many different cases
to study and qualitative differences

9684
03:18:42,309 --> 03:18:42,319
to study and qualitative differences
 

9685
03:18:42,319 --> 03:18:44,550
to study and qualitative differences
between different strains of of a virus

9686
03:18:44,550 --> 03:18:44,560
between different strains of of a virus
 

9687
03:18:44,560 --> 03:18:46,349
between different strains of of a virus
or people of different ages who may have

9688
03:18:46,349 --> 03:18:46,359
or people of different ages who may have
 

9689
03:18:46,359 --> 03:18:48,590
or people of different ages who may have
Co so there's a a lot of different

9690
03:18:48,590 --> 03:18:48,600
Co so there's a a lot of different
 

9691
03:18:48,600 --> 03:18:50,910
Co so there's a a lot of different
disparate data to work with and it's

9692
03:18:50,910 --> 03:18:50,920
disparate data to work with and it's
 

9693
03:18:50,920 --> 03:18:52,990
disparate data to work with and it's
small data sets and somehow integrating

9694
03:18:52,990 --> 03:18:53,000
small data sets and somehow integrating
 

9695
03:18:53,000 --> 03:18:54,429
small data sets and somehow integrating
them you know this is one of the

9696
03:18:54,429 --> 03:18:54,439
them you know this is one of the
 

9697
03:18:54,439 --> 03:18:56,269
them you know this is one of the
shameful things it's very hard to get

9698
03:18:56,269 --> 03:18:56,279
shameful things it's very hard to get
 

9699
03:18:56,279 --> 03:18:59,630
shameful things it's very hard to get
that data so I mean we're working with a

9700
03:18:59,630 --> 03:18:59,640
that data so I mean we're working with a
 

9701
03:18:59,640 --> 03:19:02,790
that data so I mean we're working with a
couple groups doing clinical trials and

9702
03:19:02,790 --> 03:19:02,800
couple groups doing clinical trials and
 

9703
03:19:02,800 --> 03:19:05,110
couple groups doing clinical trials and
and they're sharing data with us like

9704
03:19:05,110 --> 03:19:05,120
and they're sharing data with us like
 

9705
03:19:05,120 --> 03:19:05,910
and they're sharing data with us like
under

9706
03:19:05,910 --> 03:19:05,920
under
 

9707
03:19:05,920 --> 03:19:08,469
under
non-disclosure but what should be the

9708
03:19:08,469 --> 03:19:08,479
non-disclosure but what should be the
 

9709
03:19:08,479 --> 03:19:11,750
non-disclosure but what should be the
case is like every covid clinical trial

9710
03:19:11,750 --> 03:19:11,760
case is like every covid clinical trial
 

9711
03:19:11,760 --> 03:19:14,389
case is like every covid clinical trial
should be putting data online somewhere

9712
03:19:14,389 --> 03:19:14,399
should be putting data online somewhere
 

9713
03:19:14,399 --> 03:19:16,269
should be putting data online somewhere
like suitably encrypted to protect

9714
03:19:16,269 --> 03:19:16,279
like suitably encrypted to protect
 

9715
03:19:16,279 --> 03:19:18,830
like suitably encrypted to protect
patient privacy so that anyone with the

9716
03:19:18,830 --> 03:19:18,840
patient privacy so that anyone with the
 

9717
03:19:18,840 --> 03:19:21,429
patient privacy so that anyone with the
right AI algorithms should be able to

9718
03:19:21,429 --> 03:19:21,439
right AI algorithms should be able to
 

9719
03:19:21,439 --> 03:19:23,229
right AI algorithms should be able to
help analyze it and any biologist should

9720
03:19:23,229 --> 03:19:23,239
help analyze it and any biologist should
 

9721
03:19:23,239 --> 03:19:24,830
help analyze it and any biologist should
be able to analyze it by hand to

9722
03:19:24,830 --> 03:19:24,840
be able to analyze it by hand to
 

9723
03:19:24,840 --> 03:19:26,670
be able to analyze it by hand to
understand what they can right instead

9724
03:19:26,670 --> 03:19:26,680
understand what they can right instead
 

9725
03:19:26,680 --> 03:19:29,309
understand what they can right instead
instead that data is like siloed inside

9726
03:19:29,309 --> 03:19:29,319
instead that data is like siloed inside
 

9727
03:19:29,319 --> 03:19:30,550
instead that data is like siloed inside
whatever hospital is running the

9728
03:19:30,550 --> 03:19:30,560
whatever hospital is running the
 

9729
03:19:30,560 --> 03:19:33,150
whatever hospital is running the
clinical trial which is completely

9730
03:19:33,150 --> 03:19:33,160
clinical trial which is completely
 

9731
03:19:33,160 --> 03:19:36,469
clinical trial which is completely
asinine and and ridiculous like what why

9732
03:19:36,469 --> 03:19:36,479
asinine and and ridiculous like what why
 

9733
03:19:36,479 --> 03:19:38,070
asinine and and ridiculous like what why
why the world works that way I mean we

9734
03:19:38,070 --> 03:19:38,080
why the world works that way I mean we
 

9735
03:19:38,080 --> 03:19:40,110
why the world works that way I mean we
could all analyze why but it's insane

9736
03:19:40,110 --> 03:19:40,120
could all analyze why but it's insane
 

9737
03:19:40,120 --> 03:19:42,389
could all analyze why but it's insane
that it does you look at this hyd

9738
03:19:42,389 --> 03:19:42,399
that it does you look at this hyd
 

9739
03:19:42,399 --> 03:19:44,429
that it does you look at this hyd
hydrochloroquine right all these

9740
03:19:44,429 --> 03:19:44,439
hydrochloroquine right all these
 

9741
03:19:44,439 --> 03:19:46,229
hydrochloroquine right all these
clinical trials were done were reported

9742
03:19:46,229 --> 03:19:46,239
clinical trials were done were reported
 

9743
03:19:46,239 --> 03:19:48,550
clinical trials were done were reported
by surgisphere some little company no

9744
03:19:48,550 --> 03:19:48,560
by surgisphere some little company no
 

9745
03:19:48,560 --> 03:19:52,469
by surgisphere some little company no
one ever heard of and everyone paid

9746
03:19:52,469 --> 03:19:52,479
one ever heard of and everyone paid
 

9747
03:19:52,479 --> 03:19:53,710
one ever heard of and everyone paid
attention to this so they were doing

9748
03:19:53,710 --> 03:19:53,720
attention to this so they were doing
 

9749
03:19:53,720 --> 03:19:55,630
attention to this so they were doing
more clinical trials based on that then

9750
03:19:55,630 --> 03:19:55,640
more clinical trials based on that then
 

9751
03:19:55,640 --> 03:19:57,150
more clinical trials based on that then
they stopped doing clinical trials based

9752
03:19:57,150 --> 03:19:57,160
they stopped doing clinical trials based
 

9753
03:19:57,160 --> 03:19:58,950
they stopped doing clinical trials based
on that then they started again

9754
03:19:58,950 --> 03:19:58,960
on that then they started again
 

9755
03:19:58,960 --> 03:20:01,309
on that then they started again
and why isn't that data just out there

9756
03:20:01,309 --> 03:20:01,319
and why isn't that data just out there
 

9757
03:20:01,319 --> 03:20:03,189
and why isn't that data just out there
so everyone can analyze it and and and

9758
03:20:03,189 --> 03:20:03,199
so everyone can analyze it and and and
 

9759
03:20:03,199 --> 03:20:06,150
so everyone can analyze it and and and
see what's going on right you hope that

9760
03:20:06,150 --> 03:20:06,160
see what's going on right you hope that
 

9761
03:20:06,160 --> 03:20:09,750
see what's going on right you hope that
uh we'll move uh that data will be out

9762
03:20:09,750 --> 03:20:09,760
uh we'll move uh that data will be out
 

9763
03:20:09,760 --> 03:20:11,870
uh we'll move uh that data will be out
there eventually for future pandemics I

9764
03:20:11,870 --> 03:20:11,880
there eventually for future pandemics I
 

9765
03:20:11,880 --> 03:20:13,189
there eventually for future pandemics I
mean do do you have hope that our

9766
03:20:13,189 --> 03:20:13,199
mean do do you have hope that our
 

9767
03:20:13,199 --> 03:20:15,590
mean do do you have hope that our
society will move in the direction of

9768
03:20:15,590 --> 03:20:15,600
society will move in the direction of
 

9769
03:20:15,600 --> 03:20:17,429
society will move in the direction of
not in the immediate future because the

9770
03:20:17,429 --> 03:20:17,439
not in the immediate future because the
 

9771
03:20:17,439 --> 03:20:21,309
not in the immediate future because the
US and China frictions are getting very

9772
03:20:21,309 --> 03:20:21,319
US and China frictions are getting very
 

9773
03:20:21,319 --> 03:20:24,510
US and China frictions are getting very
high so it's hard to see us and China as

9774
03:20:24,510 --> 03:20:24,520
high so it's hard to see us and China as
 

9775
03:20:24,520 --> 03:20:25,950
high so it's hard to see us and China as
moving in the direction of openly

9776
03:20:25,950 --> 03:20:25,960
moving in the direction of openly
 

9777
03:20:25,960 --> 03:20:27,830
moving in the direction of openly
sharing data with each other right it's

9778
03:20:27,830 --> 03:20:27,840
sharing data with each other right it's
 

9779
03:20:27,840 --> 03:20:30,830
sharing data with each other right it's
it's not there's some sharing of data

9780
03:20:30,830 --> 03:20:30,840
it's not there's some sharing of data
 

9781
03:20:30,840 --> 03:20:32,189
it's not there's some sharing of data
but different groups are keeping their

9782
03:20:32,189 --> 03:20:32,199
but different groups are keeping their
 

9783
03:20:32,199 --> 03:20:33,950
but different groups are keeping their
data private till they've mil the best

9784
03:20:33,950 --> 03:20:33,960
data private till they've mil the best
 

9785
03:20:33,960 --> 03:20:35,670
data private till they've mil the best
results from it and then they share it

9786
03:20:35,670 --> 03:20:35,680
results from it and then they share it
 

9787
03:20:35,680 --> 03:20:38,630
results from it and then they share it
right so it's so yeah we're working with

9788
03:20:38,630 --> 03:20:38,640
right so it's so yeah we're working with
 

9789
03:20:38,640 --> 03:20:40,110
right so it's so yeah we're working with
some data that we've managed to get our

9790
03:20:40,110 --> 03:20:40,120
some data that we've managed to get our
 

9791
03:20:40,120 --> 03:20:42,389
some data that we've managed to get our
hands on something we're doing to do

9792
03:20:42,389 --> 03:20:42,399
hands on something we're doing to do
 

9793
03:20:42,399 --> 03:20:43,990
hands on something we're doing to do
good for the world and it's a very cool

9794
03:20:43,990 --> 03:20:44,000
good for the world and it's a very cool
 

9795
03:20:44,000 --> 03:20:46,269
good for the world and it's a very cool
playground for for like putting deep

9796
03:20:46,269 --> 03:20:46,279
playground for for like putting deep
 

9797
03:20:46,279 --> 03:20:48,510
playground for for like putting deep
neural it's an open Cog together so we

since 2001 but mostly human longevity

9954
03:23:50,550 --> 03:23:50,560
since 2001 but mostly human longevity
 

9955
03:23:50,560 --> 03:23:53,150
since 2001 but mostly human longevity
research and fly longevity research try

9956
03:23:53,150 --> 03:23:53,160
research and fly longevity research try
 

9957
03:23:53,160 --> 03:23:55,590
research and fly longevity research try
to understand why some organisms really

9958
03:23:55,590 --> 03:23:55,600
to understand why some organisms really
 

9959
03:23:55,600 --> 03:23:58,070
to understand why some organisms really
live a long time this is the first time

9960
03:23:58,070 --> 03:23:58,080
live a long time this is the first time
 

9961
03:23:58,080 --> 03:24:00,750
live a long time this is the first time
like race against the clock and try to

9962
03:24:00,750 --> 03:24:00,760
like race against the clock and try to
 

9963
03:24:00,760 --> 03:24:04,910
like race against the clock and try to
use the AI to figure out stuff that like

9964
03:24:04,910 --> 03:24:04,920
use the AI to figure out stuff that like
 

9965
03:24:04,920 --> 03:24:08,189
use the AI to figure out stuff that like
if we take two months longer to solve

9966
03:24:08,189 --> 03:24:08,199
if we take two months longer to solve
 

9967
03:24:08,199 --> 03:24:10,750
if we take two months longer to solve
the AI problem some more people will die

9968
03:24:10,750 --> 03:24:10,760
the AI problem some more people will die
 

9969
03:24:10,760 --> 03:24:12,070
the AI problem some more people will die
because we don't know what combination

9970
03:24:12,070 --> 03:24:12,080
because we don't know what combination
 

9971
03:24:12,080 --> 03:24:14,389
because we don't know what combination
of antivirals to give them yeah at the

9972
03:24:14,389 --> 03:24:14,399
of antivirals to give them yeah at the
 

9973
03:24:14,399 --> 03:24:16,550
of antivirals to give them yeah at the
societal level at the biological level

9974
03:24:16,550 --> 03:24:16,560
societal level at the biological level
 

9975
03:24:16,560 --> 03:24:21,269
societal level at the biological level
at any level are you hopeful about us as

9976
03:24:21,269 --> 03:24:21,279
at any level are you hopeful about us as
 

9977
03:24:21,279 --> 03:24:23,870
at any level are you hopeful about us as
a human species getting out of this

9978
03:24:23,870 --> 03:24:23,880
a human species getting out of this
 

9979
03:24:23,880 --> 03:24:25,950
a human species getting out of this
pandemic what are your thoughts on any

9980
03:24:25,950 --> 03:24:25,960
pandemic what are your thoughts on any
 

9981
03:24:25,960 --> 03:24:28,150
pandemic what are your thoughts on any
general well the pandemic will be gone

9982
03:24:28,150 --> 03:24:28,160
general well the pandemic will be gone
 

9983
03:24:28,160 --> 03:24:29,950
general well the pandemic will be gone
in a year or two once there's a vaccine

9984
03:24:29,950 --> 03:24:29,960
in a year or two once there's a vaccine
 

9985
03:24:29,960 --> 03:24:32,830
in a year or two once there's a vaccine
for it so I I mean that's that that's

9986
03:24:32,830 --> 03:24:32,840
for it so I I mean that's that that's
 

9987
03:24:32,840 --> 03:24:34,429
for it so I I mean that's that that's
but a lot of pain and suffering can

9988
03:24:34,429 --> 03:24:34,439
but a lot of pain and suffering can
 

9989
03:24:34,439 --> 03:24:37,070
but a lot of pain and suffering can
happen in that time so I mean that could

9990
03:24:37,070 --> 03:24:37,080
happen in that time so I mean that could
 

9991
03:24:37,080 --> 03:24:40,349
happen in that time so I mean that could
be irreversible I mean I I think if you

9992
03:24:40,349 --> 03:24:40,359
be irreversible I mean I I think if you
 

9993
03:24:40,359 --> 03:24:43,150
be irreversible I mean I I think if you
spend much time in subsaharan Africa you

9994
03:24:43,150 --> 03:24:43,160
spend much time in subsaharan Africa you
 

9995
03:24:43,160 --> 03:24:44,590
spend much time in subsaharan Africa you
can see there's a lot of pain and

9996
03:24:44,590 --> 03:24:44,600
can see there's a lot of pain and
 

9997
03:24:44,600 --> 03:24:47,750
can see there's a lot of pain and
suffering happening all the time like

9998
03:24:47,750 --> 03:24:47,760
suffering happening all the time like
 

9999
03:24:47,760 --> 03:24:50,229
suffering happening all the time like
you walk through the streets of any

10000
03:24:50,229 --> 03:24:50,239
you walk through the streets of any
 

10001
03:24:50,239 --> 03:24:53,429
you walk through the streets of any
large city in subsaharan Africa and

10002
03:24:53,429 --> 03:24:53,439
large city in subsaharan Africa and
 

10003
03:24:53,439 --> 03:24:56,309
large city in subsaharan Africa and
there are loads of I mean tens of

10004
03:24:56,309 --> 03:24:56,319
there are loads of I mean tens of
 

10005
03:24:56,319 --> 03:24:57,870
there are loads of I mean tens of
thousands probably hundreds of thousands

10006
03:24:57,870 --> 03:24:57,880
thousands probably hundreds of thousands
 

10007
03:24:57,880 --> 03:25:01,389
thousands probably hundreds of thousands
of people Lying by the side of the road

10008
03:25:01,389 --> 03:25:01,399
of people Lying by the side of the road
 

10009
03:25:01,399 --> 03:25:04,189
of people Lying by the side of the road
dying mainly of curable diseases without

10010
03:25:04,189 --> 03:25:04,199
dying mainly of curable diseases without
 

10011
03:25:04,199 --> 03:25:06,309
dying mainly of curable diseases without
without food or water and either

10012
03:25:06,309 --> 03:25:06,319
without food or water and either
 

10013
03:25:06,319 --> 03:25:08,030
without food or water and either
ostracized by their families or they

10014
03:25:08,030 --> 03:25:08,040
ostracized by their families or they
 

10015
03:25:08,040 --> 03:25:09,229
ostracized by their families or they
left their family house because they

10016
03:25:09,229 --> 03:25:09,239
left their family house because they
 

10017
03:25:09,239 --> 03:25:11,150
left their family house because they
didn't want to infect their family right

10018
03:25:11,150 --> 03:25:11,160
didn't want to infect their family right
 

10019
03:25:11,160 --> 03:25:13,910
didn't want to infect their family right
I mean there's tremendous human

10020
03:25:13,910 --> 03:25:13,920
I mean there's tremendous human
 

10021
03:25:13,920 --> 03:25:16,389
I mean there's tremendous human
suffering on the planet all the time

10022
03:25:16,389 --> 03:25:16,399
suffering on the planet all the time
 

10023
03:25:16,399 --> 03:25:19,469
suffering on the planet all the time
time which most folks in the developed

10024
03:25:19,469 --> 03:25:19,479
time which most folks in the developed
 

10025
03:25:19,479 --> 03:25:23,950
time which most folks in the developed
World pay no attention to and Co is is

10026
03:25:23,950 --> 03:25:23,960
World pay no attention to and Co is is
 

10027
03:25:23,960 --> 03:25:25,429
World pay no attention to and Co is is
not remotely the worst how many people

10028
03:25:25,429 --> 03:25:25,439
not remotely the worst how many people
 

10029
03:25:25,439 --> 03:25:28,349
not remotely the worst how many people
are dying of malaria all the time I mean

10030
03:25:28,349 --> 03:25:28,359
are dying of malaria all the time I mean
 

10031
03:25:28,359 --> 03:25:32,429
are dying of malaria all the time I mean
So Co is bad it is by no mean the worst

10032
03:25:32,429 --> 03:25:32,439
So Co is bad it is by no mean the worst
 

10033
03:25:32,439 --> 03:25:35,189
So Co is bad it is by no mean the worst
thing happening and setting aside

10034
03:25:35,189 --> 03:25:35,199
thing happening and setting aside
 

10035
03:25:35,199 --> 03:25:37,790
thing happening and setting aside
diseases I mean there are many places in

10036
03:25:37,790 --> 03:25:37,800
diseases I mean there are many places in
 

10037
03:25:37,800 --> 03:25:40,030
diseases I mean there are many places in
the world where you're at risk of having

10038
03:25:40,030 --> 03:25:40,040
the world where you're at risk of having
 

10039
03:25:40,040 --> 03:25:41,990
the world where you're at risk of having
like your teenage son kidnapped by armed

10040
03:25:41,990 --> 03:25:42,000
like your teenage son kidnapped by armed
 

10041
03:25:42,000 --> 03:25:44,309
like your teenage son kidnapped by armed
militias and forced to get killed in

10042
03:25:44,309 --> 03:25:44,319
militias and forced to get killed in
 

10043
03:25:44,319 --> 03:25:46,550
militias and forced to get killed in
someone else's War fighting tribe again

10044
03:25:46,550 --> 03:25:46,560
someone else's War fighting tribe again
 

10045
03:25:46,560 --> 03:25:49,550
someone else's War fighting tribe again
tribe I mean so Humanity has a lot of

10046
03:25:49,550 --> 03:25:49,560
tribe I mean so Humanity has a lot of
 

10047
03:25:49,560 --> 03:25:52,030
tribe I mean so Humanity has a lot of
problems which we don't need to have

10048
03:25:52,030 --> 03:25:52,040
problems which we don't need to have
 

10049
03:25:52,040 --> 03:25:54,110
problems which we don't need to have
given the state of advancement of our

10050
03:25:54,110 --> 03:25:54,120
given the state of advancement of our
 

10051
03:25:54,120 --> 03:25:57,269
given the state of advancement of our
our technology right now and I think Co

10052
03:25:57,269 --> 03:25:57,279
our technology right now and I think Co
 

10053
03:25:57,279 --> 03:25:59,790
our technology right now and I think Co
is one of the easier problems to solve

10054
03:25:59,790 --> 03:25:59,800
is one of the easier problems to solve
 

10055
03:25:59,800 --> 03:26:01,630
is one of the easier problems to solve
in the sense that there are many

10056
03:26:01,630 --> 03:26:01,640
in the sense that there are many
 

10057
03:26:01,640 --> 03:26:03,590
in the sense that there are many
brilliant people working on vaccines we

10058
03:26:03,590 --> 03:26:03,600
brilliant people working on vaccines we
 

10059
03:26:03,600 --> 03:26:05,950
brilliant people working on vaccines we
have the technology to create vaccines

10060
03:26:05,950 --> 03:26:05,960
have the technology to create vaccines
 

10061
03:26:05,960 --> 03:26:07,229
have the technology to create vaccines
and we're going to we're going to create

10062
03:26:07,229 --> 03:26:07,239
and we're going to we're going to create
 

10063
03:26:07,239 --> 03:26:09,429
and we're going to we're going to create
new vaccines we should be more worried

10064
03:26:09,429 --> 03:26:09,439
new vaccines we should be more worried
 

10065
03:26:09,439 --> 03:26:11,309
new vaccines we should be more worried
that we haven't managed to defeat

10066
03:26:11,309 --> 03:26:11,319
that we haven't managed to defeat
 

10067
03:26:11,319 --> 03:26:13,309
that we haven't managed to defeat
malaria after so long and after the

10068
03:26:13,309 --> 03:26:13,319
malaria after so long and after the
 

10069
03:26:13,319 --> 03:26:15,349

putting so much so much money in into it

10072

putting so much so much money in into it
 

10073
03:26:18,439 --> 03:26:21,950
putting so much so much money in into it
I mean I think clearly the whole Global

10074
03:26:21,950 --> 03:26:21,960
I mean I think clearly the whole Global

the global political and socioeconomic
 

10079
03:26:27,760 --> 03:26:31,830
the global political and socioeconomic
system are incredibly unethical and

unequal and and badly designed and I
 

10083
03:26:36,640 --> 03:26:40,469
unequal and and badly designed and I
mean I don't know how to solve that

10084
03:26:40,469 --> 03:26:40,479
mean I don't know how to solve that
 

10085
03:26:40,479 --> 03:26:42,389
mean I don't know how to solve that
directly I think what we can do

03:26:42,389 --> 03:26:42,399
directly I think what we can do
 

10087
03:26:42,399 --> 03:26:44,910
directly I think what we can do
indirectly to solve it is to make

it's been very welcoming in in in in the
third world for for example and it's

10596
03:36:54,550 --> 03:36:54,560
third world for for example and it's
 

10597
03:36:54,560 --> 03:36:56,389
third world for for example and it's
it's allowed advanced technology to roll

10598
03:36:56,389 --> 03:36:56,399
it's allowed advanced technology to roll
 

10599
03:36:56,399 --> 03:36:57,990

10606
03:37:04,990 --> 03:37:05,000
proprietary software so I'd say the
 

10607
03:37:05,000 --> 03:37:08,630

03:37:16,040 --> 03:37:18,309
be ethically better than than the sum of
the parts rather than worse and

10616
03:37:18,309 --> 03:37:18,319
the parts rather than worse and
 

10617
03:37:18,319 --> 03:37:20,389
the parts rather than worse and
corporations that has happened only for

10618
03:37:20,389 --> 03:37:20,399
corporations that has happened only for
 

10619
03:37:20,399 --> 03:37:23,030
corporations that has happened only for
a brief period and and then and then

10620
03:37:23,030 --> 03:37:23,040
a brief period and and then and then
 

10621
03:37:23,040 --> 03:37:25,150
a brief period and and then and then
then it go it goes sour right I mean I'd

10622
03:37:25,150 --> 03:37:25,160
then it go it goes sour right I mean I'd
 

10623
03:37:25,160 --> 03:37:26,990
then it go it goes sour right I mean I'd
say a similar thing about universities

10624
03:37:26,990 --> 03:37:27,000
say a similar thing about universities
 

10625
03:37:27,000 --> 03:37:29,790
say a similar thing about universities
like University is a horrible way to

10626
03:37:29,790 --> 03:37:29,800
like University is a horrible way to
 

10627
03:37:29,800 --> 03:37:32,070
like University is a horrible way to
organize research and get things done

10628
03:37:32,070 --> 03:37:32,080
organize research and get things done
 

10629
03:37:32,080 --> 03:37:33,790
organize research and get things done
yet it's better than anything else we've

10630
03:37:33,790 --> 03:37:33,800
yet it's better than anything else we've
 

10631
03:37:33,800 --> 03:37:36,269
yet it's better than anything else we've
come up with right a company can be much

10632
03:37:36,269 --> 03:37:36,279
come up with right a company can be much
 

10633
03:37:36,279 --> 03:37:38,189
come up with right a company can be much
better but for a brief period of time

10634
03:37:38,189 --> 03:37:38,199
better but for a brief period of time
 

10635
03:37:38,199 --> 03:37:42,030
better but for a brief period of time
and then then it stops stops being so

10636
03:37:42,030 --> 03:37:42,040
and then then it stops stops being so
 

10637
03:37:42,040 --> 03:37:45,550
and then then it stops stops being so
good right so then I I think if you

10638
03:37:45,550 --> 03:37:45,560
good right so then I I think if you
 

10639
03:37:45,560 --> 03:37:49,070
good right so then I I think if you
believe that AI is going to emerge sort

10640
03:37:49,070 --> 03:37:49,080
believe that AI is going to emerge sort
 

10641
03:37:49,080 --> 03:37:51,630

10643
03:37:51,640 --> 03:37:53,830
of incrementally out of AI doing
practical stuff in the world like

10644
03:37:53,830 --> 03:37:53,840
practical stuff in the world like
 

10645
03:37:53,840 --> 03:37:56,070
practical stuff in the world like
controlling humanoid robots or or

10646

meaning and value from ongoing life W
without death which I very definite yeah

forever forever I my my goal with
 

10883
03:42:51,600 --> 03:42:54,790
forever forever I my my goal with
longevity research is to abolish the

10884
03:42:54,790 --> 03:42:54,800
longevity research is to abolish the
 

10885
03:42:54,800 --> 03:42:57,790
longevity research is to abolish the
plague of involuntary death I don't

10886
03:42:57,790 --> 03:42:57,800
plague of involuntary death I don't
 

10887
03:42:57,800 --> 03:42:59,349
plague of involuntary death I don't
think people should die unless they

10888
03:42:59,349 --> 03:42:59,359
think people should die unless they
 

10889
03:42:59,359 --> 03:43:04,790
think people should die unless they
choose to die if I had to choose forced

10890
03:43:04,790 --> 03:43:04,800
choose to die if I had to choose forced
 

10891
03:43:04,800 --> 03:43:07,630
choose to die if I had to choose forced
immortality versus dying I would choose

10892
03:43:07,630 --> 03:43:07,640
immortality versus dying I would choose
 

10893
03:43:07,640 --> 03:43:10,630
immortality versus dying I would choose
forced immortality on the other hand if

10894
03:43:10,630 --> 03:43:10,640
forced immortality on the other hand if
 

10895
03:43:10,640 --> 03:43:12,750
forced immortality on the other hand if
I chose if I had the choice of

10896
03:43:12,750 --> 03:43:12,760
I chose if I had the choice of
 

10897
03:43:12,760 --> 03:43:14,590
I chose if I had the choice of
immortality with the choice of suicide

10898
03:43:14,590 --> 03:43:14,600
immortality with the choice of suicide
 

10899
03:43:14,600 --> 03:43:15,990
immortality with the choice of suicide
whenever I felt like it of course I

10900
03:43:15,990 --> 03:43:16,000
whenever I felt like it of course I
 

10901
03:43:16,000 --> 03:43:17,670
whenever I felt like it of course I
would take that instead and that's the

10902
03:43:17,670 --> 03:43:17,680
would take that instead and that's the
 

10903
03:43:17,680 --> 03:43:19,469
would take that instead and that's the
more realistic choice I mean there

10904
03:43:19,469 --> 03:43:19,479
more realistic choice I mean there
 

10905
03:43:19,479 --> 03:43:20,950
more realistic choice I mean there
there's no reason you should have forced

10906
03:43:20,950 --> 03:43:20,960
there's no reason you should have forced
 

10907
03:43:20,960 --> 03:43:23,670
there's no reason you should have forced
immortality you should be able to live

10908
03:43:23,670 --> 03:43:23,680
immortality you should be able to live
 

10909
03:43:23,680 --> 03:43:25,389
immortality you should be able to live
until you get until you get sick of

10910
03:43:25,389 --> 03:43:25,399
until you get until you get sick of
 

10911
03:43:25,399 --> 03:43:27,830
until you get until you get sick of
living right I mean that's and that will

10912
03:43:27,830 --> 03:43:27,840
living right I mean that's and that will
 

10913
03:43:27,840 --> 03:43:30,630
living right I mean that's and that will
seem insanely obvious to everyone 50

10914
03:43:30,630 --> 03:43:30,640
seem insanely obvious to everyone 50
 

10915
03:43:30,640 --> 03:43:33,229
seem insanely obvious to everyone 50
years from now and they will be so I

10916
03:43:33,229 --> 03:43:33,239
years from now and they will be so I
 

10917
03:43:33,239 --> 03:43:35,229
years from now and they will be so I
mean people who thought death gives

10918
03:43:35,229 --> 03:43:35,239
mean people who thought death gives
 

10919
03:43:35,239 --> 03:43:37,630
mean people who thought death gives
meaning to life so we should all die

10920
03:43:37,630 --> 03:43:37,640
meaning to life so we should all die
 

10921
03:43:37,640 --> 03:43:39,389
meaning to life so we should all die
they will look at that 50 years from now

10922
03:43:39,389 --> 03:43:39,399
they will look at that 50 years from now
 

10923
03:43:39,399 --> 03:43:41,950
they will look at that 50 years from now
the way we now look at the anabaptists

10924
03:43:41,950 --> 03:43:41,960
the way we now look at the anabaptists
 

10925
03:43:41,960 --> 03:43:44,630
the way we now look at the anabaptists
in the year 1000 who gave away all their

10926
03:43:44,630 --> 03:43:44,640
in the year 1000 who gave away all their
 

10927
03:43:44,640 --> 03:43:46,229
in the year 1000 who gave away all their
positions went on top of the mountain

10928
03:43:46,229 --> 03:43:46,239
positions went on top of the mountain
 

10929
03:43:46,239 --> 03:43:48,389
positions went on top of the mountain
for Jesus for Jesus to come and bring

10930
03:43:48,389 --> 03:43:48,399
for Jesus for Jesus to come and bring

for Jesus for Jesus to come and bring
them to the to the Ascension I mean it's

them to the to the Ascension I mean it's
 

10933
03:43:51,120 --> 03:43:54,149
them to the to the Ascension I mean it's
it's ridiculous that that people think

10934
03:43:54,149 --> 03:43:54,159
it's ridiculous that that people think
 

10935
03:43:54,159 --> 03:43:58,349
it's ridiculous that that people think
death is is is good because because you

10936
03:43:58,349 --> 03:43:58,359
death is is is good because because you
 

10937
03:43:58,359 --> 03:44:00,189
death is is is good because because you
gain more wisdom as you approach dying

10938
03:44:00,189 --> 03:44:00,199
gain more wisdom as you approach dying
 

10939
03:44:00,199 --> 03:44:02,309
gain more wisdom as you approach dying
mean of of of of course it's true I mean

10940
03:44:02,309 --> 03:44:02,319
mean of of of of course it's true I mean
 

10941
03:44:02,319 --> 03:44:05,469
mean of of of of course it's true I mean
I'm 53 and you know the fact that I

10942
03:44:05,469 --> 03:44:05,479
I'm 53 and you know the fact that I
 

10943
03:44:05,479 --> 03:44:08,189
I'm 53 and you know the fact that I
might have only a few more decades left

10944
03:44:08,189 --> 03:44:08,199
might have only a few more decades left
 

10945
03:44:08,199 --> 03:44:10,750
might have only a few more decades left
it does make me reflect on on things

10946
03:44:10,750 --> 03:44:10,760
it does make me reflect on on things
 

10947
03:44:10,760 --> 03:44:12,910
it does make me reflect on on things
differently it it it it it does give me

10948
03:44:12,910 --> 03:44:12,920
differently it it it it it does give me
 

10949
03:44:12,920 --> 03:44:15,830
differently it it it it it does give me
a deeper understanding of many things

10950
03:44:15,830 --> 03:44:15,840
a deeper understanding of many things
 

10951
03:44:15,840 --> 03:44:19,149
a deeper understanding of many things
but I mean so what you could get a deep

10952
03:44:19,149 --> 03:44:19,159
but I mean so what you could get a deep
 

10953
03:44:19,159 --> 03:44:20,469
but I mean so what you could get a deep
understanding in in a lot of different

10954
03:44:20,469 --> 03:44:20,479
understanding in in a lot of different
 

10955
03:44:20,479 --> 03:44:22,469
understanding in in a lot of different
ways pain is the same way like we're

10956
03:44:22,469 --> 03:44:22,479
ways pain is the same way like we're
 

10957
03:44:22,479 --> 03:44:24,790
ways pain is the same way like we're
going to abolish pain and that that

10958
03:44:24,790 --> 03:44:24,800
going to abolish pain and that that
 

10959
03:44:24,800 --> 03:44:26,630
going to abolish pain and that that
that's even more amazing than abolishing

10960
03:44:26,630 --> 03:44:26,640
that's even more amazing than abolishing
 

10961
03:44:26,640 --> 03:44:28,790
that's even more amazing than abolishing
death right I mean once we get a little

10962
03:44:28,790 --> 03:44:28,800
death right I mean once we get a little
 

10963
03:44:28,800 --> 03:44:30,870
death right I mean once we get a little
better at Neuroscience we'll be able to

10964
03:44:30,870 --> 03:44:30,880
better at Neuroscience we'll be able to
 

10965
03:44:30,880 --> 03:44:33,110
better at Neuroscience we'll be able to
go in and adjust the brain so that pain

10966
03:44:33,110 --> 03:44:33,120
go in and adjust the brain so that pain
 

10967
03:44:33,120 --> 03:44:35,630
go in and adjust the brain so that pain
doesn't hurt anymore right and that you

10968
03:44:35,630 --> 03:44:35,640
doesn't hurt anymore right and that you
 

10969
03:44:35,640 --> 03:44:38,269
doesn't hurt anymore right and that you
know people will say that's bad because

10970
03:44:38,269 --> 03:44:38,279
know people will say that's bad because
 

10971
03:44:38,279 --> 03:44:40,110
know people will say that's bad because
there's so much Beauty in overcoming

10972
03:44:40,110 --> 03:44:40,120
there's so much Beauty in overcoming
 

10973
03:44:40,120 --> 03:44:42,710
there's so much Beauty in overcoming
pain and suffering well sure and there's

10974
03:44:42,710 --> 03:44:42,720
pain and suffering well sure and there's
 

10975
03:44:42,720 --> 03:44:45,349
pain and suffering well sure and there's
Beauty in overcoming torture too but and

10976

some people like to cut themselves but

10978
03:44:46,990 --> 03:44:47,000
some people like to cut themselves but
 

10979
03:44:47,000 --> 03:44:48,990
some people like to cut themselves but
not not many right I mean that's an

10980
03:44:48,990 --> 03:44:49,000
not not many right I mean that's an
 

10981
03:44:49,000 --> 03:44:51,269
not not many right I mean that's an
interesting so but to push I mean to

10982
03:44:51,269 --> 03:44:51,279
interesting so but to push I mean to
 

10983
03:44:51,279 --> 03:44:53,149
interesting so but to push I mean to
push back again this the Russian side of

10984
03:44:53,149 --> 03:44:53,159
push back again this the Russian side of
 

10985
03:44:53,159 --> 03:44:55,510
push back again this the Russian side of
me I do romanticize suffering it's non

obvious I mean the way you put it it's

10988
03:44:58,189 --> 03:44:58,199
obvious I mean the way you put it it's
 

10989
03:44:58,199 --> 03:45:00,830
obvious I mean the way you put it it's
seems very logical it's almost absurd to

10990

seems very logical it's almost absurd to
 

10991
03:45:00,840 --> 03:45:02,950
seems very logical it's almost absurd to

suffering without pain without death
it's non obvious what you can stay in

each other right no but that what I'm

11002
03:45:16,550 --> 03:45:16,560
each other right no but that what I'm
 

11003
03:45:16,560 --> 03:45:19,469
each other right no but that what I'm
saying is I I don't well that's I guess

saying is I I don't well that's I guess
 

11005

saying is I I don't well that's I guess
what I'm trying to say I don't know if I

03:45:21,630 --> 03:45:21,640
what I'm trying to say I don't know if I
 

11007

what I'm trying to say I don't know if I
was presented with that choice what I

11008
03:45:23,070 --> 03:45:23,080
was presented with that choice what I
 

11009
03:45:23,080 --> 03:45:25,990
was presented with that choice what I
would choose because it to me no this

11010
03:45:25,990 --> 03:45:26,000
would choose because it to me no this
 

11011
03:45:26,000 --> 03:45:29,189

this is this is a subtler it's a subtler
matter and I've posed it in this

11014
03:45:33,189 --> 03:45:33,199
matter and I've posed it in this
 

11015
03:45:33,199 --> 03:45:35,030
matter and I've posed it in this
conversation in an

11016
03:45:35,030 --> 03:45:35,040
conversation in an
 

11017
03:45:35,040 --> 03:45:38,950
conversation in an
unnecessarily extreme way so I I think I

11018
03:45:38,950 --> 03:45:38,960
unnecessarily extreme way so I I think I
 

11019
03:45:38,960 --> 03:45:40,990
unnecessarily extreme way so I I think I
think the way you should think about it

11020
03:45:40,990 --> 03:45:41,000
think the way you should think about it
 

11021
03:45:41,000 --> 03:45:42,790
think the way you should think about it
is what if there's a little dial on the

11022
03:45:42,790 --> 03:45:42,800
is what if there's a little dial on the
 

11023
03:45:42,800 --> 03:45:45,469
is what if there's a little dial on the
side of your head and

11024
03:45:45,469 --> 03:45:45,479
side of your head and
 

11025
03:45:45,479 --> 03:45:48,309
side of your head and
you could turn how much pain hurt turn

11026
03:45:48,309 --> 03:45:48,319
you could turn how much pain hurt turn
 

11027
03:45:48,319 --> 03:45:50,950
you could turn how much pain hurt turn
it down to zero turn up to 11 like in

11028
03:45:50,950 --> 03:45:50,960
it down to zero turn up to 11 like in
 

11029
03:45:50,960 --> 03:45:52,670
it down to zero turn up to 11 like in
spinal tap if it wants maybe through an

11030
03:45:52,670 --> 03:45:52,680
spinal tap if it wants maybe through an
 

11031
03:45:52,680 --> 03:45:55,990
spinal tap if it wants maybe through an
actual spinal typ right so I mean would

11032
03:45:55,990 --> 03:45:56,000
actual spinal typ right so I mean would
 

11033
03:45:56,000 --> 03:45:58,590
actual spinal typ right so I mean would
you opt to have that dial there or not

11034
03:45:58,590 --> 03:45:58,600
you opt to have that dial there or not
 

11035
03:45:58,600 --> 03:45:59,790
you opt to have that dial there or not
that that that's the question the

11036
03:45:59,790 --> 03:45:59,800
that that that's the question the
 

11037
03:45:59,800 --> 03:46:01,550
that that that's the question the
question isn't whether you would turn

11038
03:46:01,550 --> 03:46:01,560
question isn't whether you would turn
 

11039
03:46:01,560 --> 03:46:04,590
question isn't whether you would turn
the pain down to zero all all all the

11040
03:46:04,590 --> 03:46:04,600
the pain down to zero all all all the
 

11041
03:46:04,600 --> 03:46:06,510
the pain down to zero all all all the
time would you opt to have the dial or

11042
03:46:06,510 --> 03:46:06,520
time would you opt to have the dial or
 

11043
03:46:06,520 --> 03:46:09,110
time would you opt to have the dial or
not my my guess is that in some dark

11044
03:46:09,110 --> 03:46:09,120
not my my guess is that in some dark
 

11045
03:46:09,120 --> 03:46:10,510
not my my guess is that in some dark
moment of your life you would choose to

11046
03:46:10,510 --> 03:46:10,520
moment of your life you would choose to
 

11047
03:46:10,520 --> 03:46:12,469
moment of your life you would choose to
have the dial implanted and then it

11048
03:46:12,469 --> 03:46:12,479
have the dial implanted and then it
 

11049
03:46:12,479 --> 03:46:14,510
have the dial implanted and then it
would be there just to confess a small

11050
03:46:14,510 --> 03:46:14,520
would be there just to confess a small
 

11051
03:46:14,520 --> 03:46:17,670
would be there just to confess a small
thing I'm uh don't ask me why but I'm

11052
03:46:17,670 --> 03:46:17,680
thing I'm uh don't ask me why but I'm
 

11053
03:46:17,680 --> 03:46:19,870
thing I'm uh don't ask me why but I'm
I'm doing this physical challenge

11054
03:46:19,870 --> 03:46:19,880
I'm doing this physical challenge
 

11055
03:46:19,880 --> 03:46:23,229
I'm doing this physical challenge
currently where I'm doing 680 push-ups

11056
03:46:23,229 --> 03:46:23,239
currently where I'm doing 680 push-ups
 

11057
03:46:23,239 --> 03:46:27,550
currently where I'm doing 680 push-ups
and pull-ups a day and and my shoulder

11058
03:46:27,550 --> 03:46:27,560
and pull-ups a day and and my shoulder
 

11059
03:46:27,560 --> 03:46:29,790
and pull-ups a day and and my shoulder
is currently as we sit here in a lot of

11060
03:46:29,790 --> 03:46:29,800
is currently as we sit here in a lot of
 

11061
03:46:29,800 --> 03:46:32,149
is currently as we sit here in a lot of
pain and

11062
03:46:32,149 --> 03:46:32,159
pain and
 

11063
03:46:32,159 --> 03:46:35,389
pain and
uh I I don't know I would certainly

11064
03:46:35,389 --> 03:46:35,399
uh I I don't know I would certainly
 

11065
03:46:35,399 --> 03:46:37,070
uh I I don't know I would certainly
right now if you gave me a dial I would

11066
03:46:37,070 --> 03:46:37,080
right now if you gave me a dial I would
 

11067
03:46:37,080 --> 03:46:39,630
right now if you gave me a dial I would
turn that sucker to zero as quickly as

11068
03:46:39,630 --> 03:46:39,640
turn that sucker to zero as quickly as
 

11069
03:46:39,640 --> 03:46:43,030
turn that sucker to zero as quickly as
possible but I don't I think the whole

11070
03:46:43,030 --> 03:46:43,040
possible but I don't I think the whole
 

11071
03:46:43,040 --> 03:46:45,670
possible but I don't I think the whole
point of this journey

11072
03:46:45,670 --> 03:46:45,680
point of this journey
 

11073
03:46:45,680 --> 03:46:48,070
point of this journey
is I don't know well because you're

11074
03:46:48,070 --> 03:46:48,080
is I don't know well because you're
 

11075
03:46:48,080 --> 03:46:49,870
is I don't know well because you're
you're a twisted human being I'm a

11076
03:46:49,870 --> 03:46:49,880
you're a twisted human being I'm a
 

11077
03:46:49,880 --> 03:46:51,910
you're a twisted human being I'm a
twisted so the question is if am I

11078
03:46:51,910 --> 03:46:51,920
twisted so the question is if am I
 

11079
03:46:51,920 --> 03:46:54,269
twisted so the question is if am I
somehow Twi am I is Twisted because I

11080
03:46:54,269 --> 03:46:54,279
somehow Twi am I is Twisted because I
 

11081
03:46:54,279 --> 03:46:56,309
somehow Twi am I is Twisted because I
have I I created some kind of narrative

11082
03:46:56,309 --> 03:46:56,319
have I I created some kind of narrative
 

11083
03:46:56,319 --> 03:46:58,990
have I I created some kind of narrative
for myself so that I can deal with the

11084
03:46:58,990 --> 03:46:59,000
for myself so that I can deal with the
 

11085
03:46:59,000 --> 03:47:00,990
for myself so that I can deal with the
with with the Injustice and the

11086
03:47:00,990 --> 03:47:01,000
with with the Injustice and the
 

11087
03:47:01,000 --> 03:47:04,510
with with the Injustice and the
suffering in the world uh or is this

11088
03:47:04,510 --> 03:47:04,520
suffering in the world uh or is this
 

11089
03:47:04,520 --> 03:47:05,910
suffering in the world uh or is this
actually going to be a source of

11090
03:47:05,910 --> 03:47:05,920
actually going to be a source of
 

11091
03:47:05,920 --> 03:47:08,309
actually going to be a source of
happiness for me well this is this is a

11092
03:47:08,309 --> 03:47:08,319
happiness for me well this is this is a
 

11093
03:47:08,319 --> 03:47:10,910
happiness for me well this is this is a
to an extent is a research question that

11094
03:47:10,910 --> 03:47:10,920
to an extent is a research question that
 

11095
03:47:10,920 --> 03:47:13,229
to an extent is a research question that
Humanity will undertake right so I mean

11096
03:47:13,229 --> 03:47:13,239
Humanity will undertake right so I mean
 

11097
03:47:13,239 --> 03:47:15,429
Humanity will undertake right so I mean
human human beings

11098
03:47:15,429 --> 03:47:15,439
human human beings
 

11099
03:47:15,439 --> 03:47:19,870
human human beings
do have a particular biological makeup

11100
03:47:19,870 --> 03:47:19,880
do have a particular biological makeup
 

11101
03:47:19,880 --> 03:47:22,269
do have a particular biological makeup
which sort of implies a certain

11102
03:47:22,269 --> 03:47:22,279
which sort of implies a certain
 

11103
03:47:22,279 --> 03:47:24,309
which sort of implies a certain
probability distribution over

11104
03:47:24,309 --> 03:47:24,319
probability distribution over
 

11105
03:47:24,319 --> 03:47:26,790
probability distribution over
motivational systems right so I mean we

11106
03:47:26,790 --> 03:47:26,800
motivational systems right so I mean we
 

11107
03:47:26,800 --> 03:47:29,550
motivational systems right so I mean we
we we and that that is there well put

11108
03:47:29,550 --> 03:47:29,560
we we and that that is there well put
 

11109
03:47:29,560 --> 03:47:32,750
we we and that that is there well put
that is there now the the the question

11110
03:47:32,750 --> 03:47:32,760
that is there now the the the question
 

11111
03:47:32,760 --> 03:47:36,790
that is there now the the the question
is how flexibly can that morph as

11112
03:47:36,790 --> 03:47:36,800
is how flexibly can that morph as
 

11113
03:47:36,800 --> 03:47:39,269
is how flexibly can that morph as
society and Technology change right so

11114
03:47:39,269 --> 03:47:39,279
society and Technology change right so
 

11115
03:47:39,279 --> 03:47:42,189
society and Technology change right so
if if we're given that dial and we're

11116
03:47:42,189 --> 03:47:42,199
if if we're given that dial and we're
 

11117
03:47:42,199 --> 03:47:44,510
if if we're given that dial and we're
given a society in which say we don't

11118
03:47:44,510 --> 03:47:44,520
given a society in which say we don't
 

11119
03:47:44,520 --> 03:47:45,510
given a society in which say we don't
have to

11120
03:47:45,510 --> 03:47:45,520
have to
 

11121
03:47:45,520 --> 03:47:48,110
have to
we don't have to work for a living and

11122
03:47:48,110 --> 03:47:48,120
we don't have to work for a living and
 

11123
03:47:48,120 --> 03:47:49,950
we don't have to work for a living and
in which there's an ambient

11124
03:47:49,950 --> 03:47:49,960
in which there's an ambient
 

11125
03:47:49,960 --> 03:47:51,870
in which there's an ambient
decentralized benevolent AI Network that

11126
03:47:51,870 --> 03:47:51,880
decentralized benevolent AI Network that
 

11127
03:47:51,880 --> 03:47:53,309
decentralized benevolent AI Network that
will warn us when we're about to hurt

11128
03:47:53,309 --> 03:47:53,319
will warn us when we're about to hurt
 

11129
03:47:53,319 --> 03:47:56,110
will warn us when we're about to hurt
oursel you know if we're in a different

11130
03:47:56,110 --> 03:47:56,120
oursel you know if we're in a different
 

11131
03:47:56,120 --> 03:47:58,389
oursel you know if we're in a different
context can we

11132
03:47:58,389 --> 03:47:58,399
context can we
 

11133
03:47:58,399 --> 03:48:01,670
context can we
consistently with being genuinely and

11134
03:48:01,670 --> 03:48:01,680
consistently with being genuinely and
 

11135
03:48:01,680 --> 03:48:04,030
consistently with being genuinely and
fully human can we consistently get into

11136
03:48:04,030 --> 03:48:04,040
fully human can we consistently get into
 

11137
03:48:04,040 --> 03:48:06,469
fully human can we consistently get into
a state of consciousness where we just

11138
03:48:06,469 --> 03:48:06,479
a state of consciousness where we just
 

11139
03:48:06,479 --> 03:48:09,389
a state of consciousness where we just
want to keep the pain dial turned all

11140
03:48:09,389 --> 03:48:09,399
want to keep the pain dial turned all
 

11141
03:48:09,399 --> 03:48:11,910
want to keep the pain dial turned all
the way down and yet we're leading very

11142
03:48:11,910 --> 03:48:11,920
the way down and yet we're leading very
 

11143
03:48:11,920 --> 03:48:14,870
the way down and yet we're leading very
rewarding and fulfilling lives right now

11144
03:48:14,870 --> 03:48:14,880
rewarding and fulfilling lives right now
 

11145
03:48:14,880 --> 03:48:17,389
rewarding and fulfilling lives right now
I suspect the answer is yes we can do

11146
03:48:17,389 --> 03:48:17,399
I suspect the answer is yes we can do
 

11147
03:48:17,399 --> 03:48:19,670
I suspect the answer is yes we can do
that but I I don't I don't know that a

11148
03:48:19,670 --> 03:48:19,680
that but I I don't I don't know that a
 

11149
03:48:19,680 --> 03:48:21,590
that but I I don't I don't know that a
research I don't know that for certain

11150
03:48:21,590 --> 03:48:21,600
research I don't know that for certain
 

11151
03:48:21,600 --> 03:48:24,830
research I don't know that for certain
yeah now I'm more confident that we

11152
03:48:24,830 --> 03:48:24,840
yeah now I'm more confident that we
 

11153
03:48:24,840 --> 03:48:28,590
yeah now I'm more confident that we
could create a nonhuman AGI

11154
03:48:28,590 --> 03:48:28,600
could create a nonhuman AGI
 

11155
03:48:28,600 --> 03:48:30,630
could create a nonhuman AGI
system which just didn't need an

11156
03:48:30,630 --> 03:48:30,640
system which just didn't need an
 

11157
03:48:30,640 --> 03:48:33,590
system which just didn't need an
analogue of feeling pain and I think

11158
03:48:33,590 --> 03:48:33,600
analogue of feeling pain and I think
 

11159
03:48:33,600 --> 03:48:36,750
analogue of feeling pain and I think
that AGI system will be fundamentally

11160
03:48:36,750 --> 03:48:36,760
that AGI system will be fundamentally
 

11161
03:48:36,760 --> 03:48:38,790
that AGI system will be fundamentally
healthier and more benevolent than than

11162
03:48:38,790 --> 03:48:38,800
healthier and more benevolent than than
 

11163
03:48:38,800 --> 03:48:41,389
healthier and more benevolent than than
human beings so I think it might or

11164
03:48:41,389 --> 03:48:41,399
human beings so I think it might or
 

11165
03:48:41,399 --> 03:48:43,229
human beings so I think it might or
might not be true that humans need a

11166
03:48:43,229 --> 03:48:43,239
might not be true that humans need a
 

11167
03:48:43,239 --> 03:48:45,510
might not be true that humans need a
certain element of suffering to be

11168
03:48:45,510 --> 03:48:45,520
certain element of suffering to be
 

11169
03:48:45,520 --> 03:48:48,070
certain element of suffering to be
satisfied humans consistent with the

11170
03:48:48,070 --> 03:48:48,080

03:48:51,080 --> 03:48:53,110
human physiology if it is true that's
one of the things that makes us

super AGI right I mean this is a the
 

11179
03:49:00,800 --> 03:49:03,630
super AGI right I mean this is a the
nature of the human motivational system

11180
03:49:03,630 --> 03:49:03,640
nature of the human motivational system
 

11181
03:49:03,640 --> 03:49:07,750
nature of the human motivational system
is that we we seem to gravitate towards

11182
03:49:07,750 --> 03:49:07,760
is that we we seem to gravitate towards
 

11183
03:49:07,760 --> 03:49:11,189
is that we we seem to gravitate towards
situations where the best thing in the

03:49:11,189 --> 03:49:11,199
situations where the best thing in the
 

11185
03:49:11,199 --> 03:49:14,830
situations where the best thing in the
large scale is not the best thing in in

11186
03:49:14,830 --> 03:49:14,840
large scale is not the best thing in in
 

11187
03:49:14,840 --> 03:49:16,309
large scale is not the best thing in in
in the small scale according to our

in the small scale according to our
 

11189
03:49:16,319 --> 03:49:18,790
in the small scale according to our
subjective value system so we gravitate

11190
03:49:18,790 --> 03:49:18,800
subjective value system so we gravitate
 

11191
03:49:18,800 --> 03:49:21,149
subjective value system so we gravitate
towards subjective value judgments where

11192
03:49:21,149 --> 03:49:21,159
towards subjective value judgments where

to gratify ourselves in the large we
 

11195
03:49:22,960 --> 03:49:24,630
to gratify ourselves in the large we
have to UNG gratify ourselves in the in

have to UNG gratify ourselves in the in
 

11197
03:49:24,640 --> 03:49:28,469
have to UNG gratify ourselves in the in
the small and we do that in you see that

11198
03:49:28,469 --> 03:49:28,479
the small and we do that in you see that
 

11199
03:49:28,479 --> 03:49:31,070
the small and we do that in you see that
in in music there's a theory of Music

that will fulfill the expectations are
 

11209
03:49:39,760 --> 03:49:41,750
that will fulfill the expectations are
listed in the prior part of the music

that's why that's why it's boring right
 

11229

that's why that's why it's boring right
but wrapped up in there is you know we

11230
03:50:05,510 --> 03:50:05,520
but wrapped up in there is you know we
 

11231
03:50:05,520 --> 03:50:09,070
but wrapped up in there is you know we
want to hurt a little bit so that we can

want to hurt a little bit so that we can
we can feel the we can feel the pain go

little a little confused by what coming

11238
03:50:15,110 --> 03:50:15,120
little a little confused by what coming
 

11239
03:50:15,120 --> 03:50:17,229
little a little confused by what coming
next so then when the thing that comes

11240
03:50:17,229 --> 03:50:17,239
next so then when the thing that comes
 

11241
03:50:17,239 --> 03:50:18,790
next so then when the thing that comes
next actually makes sense it's so

11242
03:50:18,790 --> 03:50:18,800
next actually makes sense it's so
 

11243
03:50:18,800 --> 03:50:20,790
next actually makes sense it's so
satisfying right and it's the surprising

11244
03:50:20,790 --> 03:50:20,800
satisfying right and it's the surprising
 

11245
03:50:20,800 --> 03:50:22,429
satisfying right and it's the surprising
fulfillment of expectations is that what

11246
03:50:22,429 --> 03:50:22,439
fulfillment of expectations is that what
 

11247
03:50:22,439 --> 03:50:24,389
fulfillment of expectations is that what
you said yeah yeah so beautifully put is

11248
03:50:24,389 --> 03:50:24,399
you said yeah yeah so beautifully put is
 

11249
03:50:24,399 --> 03:50:25,990
you said yeah yeah so beautifully put is
there um we've been skirting around a

11250
03:50:25,990 --> 03:50:26,000
there um we've been skirting around a
 

11251
03:50:26,000 --> 03:50:27,870
there um we've been skirting around a
little bit but if I were to ask you the

11252
03:50:27,870 --> 03:50:27,880
little bit but if I were to ask you the
 

11253
03:50:27,880 --> 03:50:30,950
little bit but if I were to ask you the
most ridiculous big question of what is

11254
03:50:30,950 --> 03:50:30,960
most ridiculous big question of what is
 

11255
03:50:30,960 --> 03:50:33,670
most ridiculous big question of what is
the meaning of life uh what would your

11256
03:50:33,670 --> 03:50:33,680
the meaning of life uh what would your
 

11257
03:50:33,680 --> 03:50:36,349
the meaning of life uh what would your
answer

11258
03:50:36,349 --> 03:50:36,359

 

11259
03:50:36,359 --> 03:50:42,630

be three values Joy growth and

11260
03:50:42,630 --> 03:50:42,640

 

11261
03:50:42,640 --> 03:50:45,750

choice I I I think you you need you need

choice I I I think you you need you need
 

11263
03:50:45,760 --> 03:50:47,590
choice I I I think you you need you need
Joy I mean that that's the basis of

11264
03:50:47,590 --> 03:50:47,600
Joy I mean that that's the basis of
 

11265
03:50:47,600 --> 03:50:48,950
Joy I mean that that's the basis of
everything if you want the number one

11266
03:50:48,950 --> 03:50:48,960
everything if you want the number one
 

11267
03:50:48,960 --> 03:50:52,269
everything if you want the number one
value on the other hand I'm

11268
03:50:52,269 --> 03:50:52,279
value on the other hand I'm
 

11269
03:50:52,279 --> 03:50:54,990
value on the other hand I'm
unsatisfied with a a static joy that

11270
03:50:54,990 --> 03:50:55,000
unsatisfied with a a static joy that
 

11271
03:50:55,000 --> 03:50:58,070
unsatisfied with a a static joy that
doesn't progress perhaps because of some

11272
03:50:58,070 --> 03:50:58,080
doesn't progress perhaps because of some
 

11273
03:50:58,080 --> 03:51:00,110
doesn't progress perhaps because of some
Elemental element of human perversity

11274
03:51:00,110 --> 03:51:00,120
Elemental element of human perversity
 

11275
03:51:00,120 --> 03:51:02,309
Elemental element of human perversity
but the idea of something that grows and

11276
03:51:02,309 --> 03:51:02,319
but the idea of something that grows and
 

11277
03:51:02,319 --> 03:51:04,590
but the idea of something that grows and
becomes more and more and better and

11278
03:51:04,590 --> 03:51:04,600
becomes more and more and better and
 

11279
03:51:04,600 --> 03:51:08,070
becomes more and more and better and
better in some sense appeals to me but I

11280
03:51:08,070 --> 03:51:08,080
better in some sense appeals to me but I
 

11281
03:51:08,080 --> 03:51:09,670
better in some sense appeals to me but I
also sort of like the idea of

11282
03:51:09,670 --> 03:51:09,680
also sort of like the idea of
 

11283
03:51:09,680 --> 03:51:12,550
also sort of like the idea of
individuality that as a distinct system

11284
03:51:12,550 --> 03:51:12,560
individuality that as a distinct system
 

11285
03:51:12,560 --> 03:51:15,429
individuality that as a distinct system
I have some agencies there's some Nexus

11286
03:51:15,429 --> 03:51:15,439
I have some agencies there's some Nexus
 

11287
03:51:15,439 --> 03:51:18,790
I have some agencies there's some Nexus
of causality within within this system

11288
03:51:18,790 --> 03:51:18,800
of causality within within this system
 

11289
03:51:18,800 --> 03:51:20,870
of causality within within this system
rather than the causality being wholly

11290
03:51:20,870 --> 03:51:20,880
rather than the causality being wholly
 

11291
03:51:20,880 --> 03:51:23,110
rather than the causality being wholly
evenly distributed over the joyous

11292
03:51:23,110 --> 03:51:23,120
evenly distributed over the joyous
 

11293
03:51:23,120 --> 03:51:25,790
evenly distributed over the joyous
growing Mass so I you start with joy

11294
03:51:25,790 --> 03:51:25,800
growing Mass so I you start with joy
 

11295
03:51:25,800 --> 03:51:27,950
growing Mass so I you start with joy
growth and and choice as three basic

11296
03:51:27,950 --> 03:51:27,960
growth and and choice as three basic
 

11297
03:51:27,960 --> 03:51:29,670
growth and and choice as three basic
values that's and those three things

11298
03:51:29,670 --> 03:51:29,680
values that's and those three things
 

11299
03:51:29,680 --> 03:51:32,590
values that's and those three things
could continue indefinitely that's not

11300
03:51:32,590 --> 03:51:32,600
could continue indefinitely that's not
 

11301
03:51:32,600 --> 03:51:34,750
could continue indefinitely that's not
that's something yeah that can last

11302
03:51:34,750 --> 03:51:34,760
that's something yeah that can last
 

11303
03:51:34,760 --> 03:51:37,750
that's something yeah that can last
forever is there is there some aspect of

11304
03:51:37,750 --> 03:51:37,760
forever is there is there some aspect of
 

11305
03:51:37,760 --> 03:51:41,309
forever is there is there some aspect of
something you called which I like super

11306
03:51:41,309 --> 03:51:41,319
something you called which I like super
 

11307
03:51:41,319 --> 03:51:44,630
something you called which I like super
longevity that you find exciting that

11308
03:51:44,630 --> 03:51:44,640
longevity that you find exciting that
 

11309
03:51:44,640 --> 03:51:46,590
longevity that you find exciting that
what is there you research-wise is there

11310
03:51:46,590 --> 03:51:46,600
what is there you research-wise is there
 

11311
03:51:46,600 --> 03:51:49,309
what is there you research-wise is there
ideas in that space that I mean I I

11312
03:51:49,309 --> 03:51:49,319
ideas in that space that I mean I I
 

11313
03:51:49,319 --> 03:51:52,910
ideas in that space that I mean I I
think yeah in terms of the meaning of

11314
03:51:52,910 --> 03:51:52,920
think yeah in terms of the meaning of
 

11315
03:51:52,920 --> 03:51:56,030
think yeah in terms of the meaning of
life this really ties into that because

11316
03:51:56,030 --> 03:51:56,040
life this really ties into that because
 

11317
03:51:56,040 --> 03:51:58,910
life this really ties into that because
for us as humans probably the way to get

11318
03:51:58,910 --> 03:51:58,920
for us as humans probably the way to get
 

11319
03:51:58,920 --> 03:52:02,750
for us as humans probably the way to get
the most Joy growth and choice is

11320
03:52:02,750 --> 03:52:02,760
the most Joy growth and choice is
 

11321
03:52:02,760 --> 03:52:05,670
the most Joy growth and choice is
transhumanism and to go beyond the human

11322
03:52:05,670 --> 03:52:05,680
transhumanism and to go beyond the human
 

11323
03:52:05,680 --> 03:52:07,870
transhumanism and to go beyond the human
form that that that that we have right

11324
03:52:07,870 --> 03:52:07,880
form that that that that we have right
 

11325
03:52:07,880 --> 03:52:10,510
form that that that that we have right
now right I mean I think human body is

11326
03:52:10,510 --> 03:52:10,520
now right I mean I think human body is
 

11327
03:52:10,520 --> 03:52:13,870
now right I mean I think human body is
great and by no means to any of us

11328
03:52:13,870 --> 03:52:13,880
great and by no means to any of us
 

11329
03:52:13,880 --> 03:52:16,070
great and by no means to any of us
maximize the potential for Joy growth

11330
03:52:16,070 --> 03:52:16,080
maximize the potential for Joy growth
 

11331
03:52:16,080 --> 03:52:18,510
maximize the potential for Joy growth
and choice imminent in our human bodies

11332
03:52:18,510 --> 03:52:18,520
and choice imminent in our human bodies
 

11333
03:52:18,520 --> 03:52:20,950
and choice imminent in our human bodies
on the other hand it's clear that other

11334
03:52:20,950 --> 03:52:20,960
on the other hand it's clear that other
 

11335
03:52:20,960 --> 03:52:24,189
on the other hand it's clear that other
configurations of matter could manifest

11336
03:52:24,189 --> 03:52:24,199
configurations of matter could manifest
 

11337
03:52:24,199 --> 03:52:26,229
configurations of matter could manifest
even greater amounts of Joy growth and

11338
03:52:26,229 --> 03:52:26,239
even greater amounts of Joy growth and
 

11339
03:52:26,239 --> 03:52:29,590
even greater amounts of Joy growth and
choice than that than than humans do

11340
03:52:29,590 --> 03:52:29,600
choice than that than than humans do
 

11341
03:52:29,600 --> 03:52:31,750
choice than that than than humans do
maybe even finding ways to go beyond the

11342
03:52:31,750 --> 03:52:31,760
maybe even finding ways to go beyond the
 

11343
03:52:31,760 --> 03:52:34,269
maybe even finding ways to go beyond the
realm of matter that as as we understand

11344
03:52:34,269 --> 03:52:34,279
realm of matter that as as we understand
 

11345
03:52:34,279 --> 03:52:37,189
realm of matter that as as we understand
it right now so I think in a practical

11346
03:52:37,189 --> 03:52:37,199
it right now so I think in a practical
 

11347
03:52:37,199 --> 03:52:39,870
it right now so I think in a practical
sense much of the meaning I see in human

11348
03:52:39,870 --> 03:52:39,880
sense much of the meaning I see in human
 

11349
03:52:39,880 --> 03:52:42,229
sense much of the meaning I see in human
life is to create something better than

11350
03:52:42,229 --> 03:52:42,239
life is to create something better than
 

11351
03:52:42,239 --> 03:52:45,550
life is to create something better than
humans and and and and go beyond life

11352
03:52:45,550 --> 03:52:45,560
humans and and and and go beyond life
 

11353
03:52:45,560 --> 03:52:47,750
humans and and and and go beyond life
but certainly that's not all of it for

11354
03:52:47,750 --> 03:52:47,760
but certainly that's not all of it for
 

11355
03:52:47,760 --> 03:52:49,389
but certainly that's not all of it for
me in a practical sense right like I

11356
03:52:49,389 --> 03:52:49,399
me in a practical sense right like I
 

11357
03:52:49,399 --> 03:52:51,030
me in a practical sense right like I
have four kids and and and a

11358
03:52:51,030 --> 03:52:51,040
have four kids and and and a
 

11359
03:52:51,040 --> 03:52:54,030
have four kids and and and a
granddaughter and uh many friends and

11360
03:52:54,030 --> 03:52:54,040
granddaughter and uh many friends and
 

11361
03:52:54,040 --> 03:52:57,110
granddaughter and uh many friends and
parents and family and just enjoying

11362
03:52:57,110 --> 03:52:57,120
parents and family and just enjoying
 

11363
03:52:57,120 --> 03:52:59,750
parents and family and just enjoying
everyday human Human Social existence

everyday human Human Social existence
 

11365
03:52:59,760 --> 03:53:01,710
everyday human Human Social existence
well we can do even better yeah yeah and

11366
03:53:01,710 --> 03:53:01,720
well we can do even better yeah yeah and
 

11367
03:53:01,720 --> 03:53:04,590
well we can do even better yeah yeah and
I mean I I love I've always when I could

11368
03:53:04,590 --> 03:53:04,600
I mean I I love I've always when I could
 

11369
03:53:04,600 --> 03:53:06,510
I mean I I love I've always when I could
live live near nature I spend a bunch of

11370
03:53:06,510 --> 03:53:06,520
live live near nature I spend a bunch of
 

11371
03:53:06,520 --> 03:53:09,349
live live near nature I spend a bunch of
time out in nature in the forest and on

11372
03:53:09,349 --> 03:53:09,359
time out in nature in the forest and on
 

11373
03:53:09,359 --> 03:53:11,550
time out in nature in the forest and on
the water every day and so forth so I

11374
03:53:11,550 --> 03:53:11,560
the water every day and so forth so I
 

11375
03:53:11,560 --> 03:53:14,590
the water every day and so forth so I
mean enjoying the pleasant moment is is

11376
03:53:14,590 --> 03:53:14,600
mean enjoying the pleasant moment is is
 

11377
03:53:14,600 --> 03:53:17,389
mean enjoying the pleasant moment is is
part of it but the you know the growth

11378
03:53:17,389 --> 03:53:17,399
part of it but the you know the growth
 

11379
03:53:17,399 --> 03:53:20,710
part of it but the you know the growth
and choice aspect are severely limited

03:53:31,110 --> 03:53:31,120
far as we know I mean there's some
 

11389
03:53:31,120 --> 03:53:33,510
far as we know I mean there's some
element of life after death perhaps but

certainly there's very interesting

11404
03:53:50,950 --> 03:53:50,960
certainly there's very interesting

03:53:50,960 --> 03:53:52,750
certainly there's very interesting
progress all around I mean crisper and

and Gene editing can be can be an an
 

11409
03:53:55,840 --> 03:53:59,630
and Gene editing can be can be an an
incredible tool and I mean right now

11410
03:53:59,630 --> 03:53:59,640
incredible tool and I mean right now
 

11411
03:53:59,640 --> 03:54:02,189
incredible tool and I mean right now
stem stem cells could potentially

11412
03:54:02,189 --> 03:54:02,199
stem stem cells could potentially
 

11413
03:54:02,199 --> 03:54:04,030
stem stem cells could potentially
prolong life a lot like if if you got

11414
03:54:04,030 --> 03:54:04,040
prolong life a lot like if if you got
 

11415
03:54:04,040 --> 03:54:07,469
prolong life a lot like if if you got
stem cell injections of of just stem

injected into every tissue and you can
 

11421
03:54:11,760 --> 03:54:13,349
injected into every tissue and you can
just have

11422
03:54:13,349 --> 03:54:13,359
just have
 

11423
03:54:13,359 --> 03:54:15,590
just have
replacement of your old cells with new

11424
03:54:15,590 --> 03:54:15,600
replacement of your old cells with new
 

11425
03:54:15,600 --> 03:54:17,349
replacement of your old cells with new
cells produced by those stem cells I

11426

cells produced by those stem cells I
 

11427
03:54:17,359 --> 03:54:20,429
cells produced by those stem cells I
mean that that could be highly impactful

11428
03:54:20,429 --> 03:54:20,439
mean that that could be highly impactful
 

11429
03:54:20,439 --> 03:54:21,830
mean that that could be highly impactful
at prolong life now we just need

11430
03:54:21,830 --> 03:54:21,840
at prolong life now we just need
 

11431
03:54:21,840 --> 03:54:24,389
at prolong life now we just need
slightly better technology for for

11432
03:54:24,389 --> 03:54:24,399
slightly better technology for for
 

11433
03:54:24,399 --> 03:54:26,269
slightly better technology for for

stem cell differentiation and trans
 

11439
03:54:31,080 --> 03:54:33,030
stem cell differentiation and trans
trans differentiation it's kind of

11440
03:54:33,030 --> 03:54:33,040
trans differentiation it's kind of
 

11441
03:54:33,040 --> 03:54:35,510
trans differentiation it's kind of
nitty-gritty but I mean that that's that

11442
03:54:35,510 --> 03:54:35,520
nitty-gritty but I mean that that's that
 

11443
03:54:35,520 --> 03:54:37,229
nitty-gritty but I mean that that's that
that that's quite interesting so I think

11444
03:54:37,229 --> 03:54:37,239
that that's quite interesting so I think
 

11445
03:54:37,239 --> 03:54:39,229
that that's quite interesting so I think
there's there's a lot of different

11446
03:54:39,229 --> 03:54:39,239
there's there's a lot of different
 

11447
03:54:39,239 --> 03:54:41,950
there's there's a lot of different

03:54:41,960 --> 03:54:45,550
things being done to help with with
prolongation of of human life but we

11450
03:54:45,550 --> 03:54:45,560
prolongation of of human life but we
 

11451
03:54:45,560 --> 03:54:48,110
prolongation of of human life but we
could do a do a lot better so for

11452
03:54:48,110 --> 03:54:48,120
could do a do a lot better so for
 

11453
03:54:48,120 --> 03:54:51,550
could do a do a lot better so for
example The extracellular Matrix which

03:54:51,550 --> 03:54:51,560
example The extracellular Matrix which
 

11455
03:54:51,560 --> 03:54:53,110
example The extracellular Matrix which
is a bunch of proteins in between the

03:54:53,110 --> 03:54:53,120
is a bunch of proteins in between the
 

11457
03:54:53,120 --> 03:54:55,149
is a bunch of proteins in between the
cells in your body they get stiffer and

11458
03:54:55,149 --> 03:54:55,159
cells in your body they get stiffer and
 

11459
03:54:55,159 --> 03:54:57,870
cells in your body they get stiffer and
stiffer as you get older and the The

11460
03:54:57,870 --> 03:54:57,880
stiffer as you get older and the The
 

11461
03:54:57,880 --> 03:55:00,309

extracellular Matrix trans transmits

11462
03:55:00,309 --> 03:55:00,319
extracellular Matrix trans transmits
 

11463
03:55:00,319 --> 03:55:02,750
extracellular Matrix trans transmits
information both electrically

11464
03:55:02,750 --> 03:55:02,760
information both electrically
 

11465
03:55:02,760 --> 03:55:04,670
information both electrically
mechanically and to some extent biop

11466
03:55:04,670 --> 03:55:04,680
mechanically and to some extent biop
 

11467
03:55:04,680 --> 03:55:06,550
mechanically and to some extent biop
photonically so there's all this

11468
03:55:06,550 --> 03:55:06,560
photonically so there's all this
 

11469
03:55:06,560 --> 03:55:08,030
photonically so there's all this
transmission through the parts of the

03:55:08,030 --> 03:55:08,040
transmission through the parts of the
 

11471
03:55:08,040 --> 03:55:10,429
transmission through the parts of the
body but the stiffer The extracellular

11472
03:55:10,429 --> 03:55:10,439
body but the stiffer The extracellular
 

11473
03:55:10,439 --> 03:55:13,070
body but the stiffer The extracellular
Matrix gets the less the transmission

11474
03:55:13,070 --> 03:55:13,080
Matrix gets the less the transmission
 

11475
03:55:13,080 --> 03:55:14,790
Matrix gets the less the transmission

story for the hat is there does the Hat
have its own story that you're uh able

11632
03:58:20,670 --> 03:58:20,680
have its own story that you're uh able
 

11633
03:58:20,680 --> 03:58:22,550
have its own story that you're uh able
to share uh the Hat story has not been

11634
03:58:22,550 --> 03:58:22,560
to share uh the Hat story has not been
 

11635
03:58:22,560 --> 03:58:23,910
to share uh the Hat story has not been
told yet so we're going to have to come

11636
03:58:23,910 --> 03:58:23,920
told yet so we're going to have to come
 

11637
03:58:23,920 --> 03:58:25,389
told yet so we're going to have to come
back and you can you can interview the

11638
03:58:25,389 --> 03:58:25,399
back and you can you can interview the
 

11639
03:58:25,399 --> 03:58:27,189
back and you can you can interview the
Hat the

11640
03:58:27,189 --> 03:58:27,199
Hat the
 

11641
03:58:27,199 --> 03:58:29,429
Hat the
Hat we'll leave that for the Hat Zone

11642
03:58:29,429 --> 03:58:29,439
Hat we'll leave that for the Hat Zone
 

11643
03:58:29,439 --> 03:58:31,189
Hat we'll leave that for the Hat Zone
interview all it's too much it's too

11644
03:58:31,189 --> 03:58:31,199
interview all it's too much it's too
 

11645
03:58:31,199 --> 03:58:33,269
interview all it's too much it's too
much to pack into is there a book is a

11646
03:58:33,269 --> 03:58:33,279
much to pack into is there a book is a
 

11647
03:58:33,279 --> 03:58:36,910
much to pack into is there a book is a
hat gonna write a book okay we'll uh it

11648
03:58:36,910 --> 03:58:36,920
hat gonna write a book okay we'll uh it
 

11649
03:58:36,920 --> 03:58:38,510
hat gonna write a book okay we'll uh it
may transmit the information through

11650
03:58:38,510 --> 03:58:38,520
may transmit the information through
 

11651
03:58:38,520 --> 03:58:40,870
may transmit the information through
direct neural transmission okay so it's

11652
03:58:40,870 --> 03:58:40,880
direct neural transmission okay so it's
 

11653
03:58:40,880 --> 03:58:42,070
direct neural transmission okay so it's
it actually there might be some

11654
03:58:42,070 --> 03:58:42,080
it actually there might be some
 

11655
03:58:42,080 --> 03:58:45,070
it actually there might be some
neuralink competition there uh beautiful

11656
03:58:45,070 --> 03:58:45,080
neuralink competition there uh beautiful
 

11657
03:58:45,080 --> 03:58:47,389
neuralink competition there uh beautiful
we'll leave it as a mystery uh maybe one

11658
03:58:47,389 --> 03:58:47,399
we'll leave it as a mystery uh maybe one
 

11659
03:58:47,399 --> 03:58:53,309
we'll leave it as a mystery uh maybe one
last question if uh you uh build an AGI

11660
03:58:53,309 --> 03:58:53,319
last question if uh you uh build an AGI
 

11661
03:58:53,319 --> 03:58:56,910
last question if uh you uh build an AGI
system uh you're successful at building

11662
03:58:56,910 --> 03:58:56,920
system uh you're successful at building
 

11663
03:58:56,920 --> 03:58:59,670
system uh you're successful at building
the A A system that could lead us to The

11664
03:58:59,670 --> 03:58:59,680
the A A system that could lead us to The
 

11665
03:58:59,680 --> 03:59:02,389
the A A system that could lead us to The
Singularity and you get to talk to her

11666
03:59:02,389 --> 03:59:02,399
Singularity and you get to talk to her
 

11667
03:59:02,399 --> 03:59:05,030
Singularity and you get to talk to her
and ask her one question what would that

11668
03:59:05,030 --> 03:59:05,040
and ask her one question what would that
 

11669
03:59:05,040 --> 03:59:06,110
and ask her one question what would that
question

11670
03:59:06,110 --> 03:59:06,120
question
 

11671
03:59:06,120 --> 03:59:08,630
question
be we're not allowed to ask what is the

11672
03:59:08,630 --> 03:59:08,640
be we're not allowed to ask what is the
 

11673
03:59:08,640 --> 03:59:10,269
be we're not allowed to ask what is the
question I should be

11674
03:59:10,269 --> 03:59:10,279
question I should be
 

11675
03:59:10,279 --> 03:59:12,510
question I should be
asking yeah that would be cheating but I

11676
03:59:12,510 --> 03:59:12,520
asking yeah that would be cheating but I
 

11677
03:59:12,520 --> 03:59:14,269
asking yeah that would be cheating but I
guess that's a good question I'm

11678
03:59:14,269 --> 03:59:14,279
guess that's a good question I'm
 

11679
03:59:14,279 --> 03:59:16,830
guess that's a good question I'm
thinking of a I wrote a story with

11680
03:59:16,830 --> 03:59:16,840
thinking of a I wrote a story with
 

11681
03:59:16,840 --> 03:59:20,750
thinking of a I wrote a story with
Stefan bugy once where

11682
03:59:20,750 --> 03:59:20,760
Stefan bugy once where
 

11683
03:59:20,760 --> 03:59:24,630
Stefan bugy once where
these AI developers they created a super

11684
03:59:24,630 --> 03:59:24,640
these AI developers they created a super
 

11685
03:59:24,640 --> 03:59:27,750
these AI developers they created a super
smart AI aimed at

11686
03:59:27,750 --> 03:59:27,760
smart AI aimed at
 

11687
03:59:27,760 --> 03:59:30,750
smart AI aimed at
answering all the philosophical

11688
03:59:30,750 --> 03:59:30,760
answering all the philosophical
 

11689
03:59:30,760 --> 03:59:32,070
answering all the philosophical
questions that have been worrying them

11690
03:59:32,070 --> 03:59:32,080
questions that have been worrying them
 

11691
03:59:32,080 --> 03:59:33,870
questions that have been worrying them
like what what what is the meaning of

11692
03:59:33,870 --> 03:59:33,880
like what what what is the meaning of
 

11693
03:59:33,880 --> 03:59:36,070
like what what what is the meaning of
life is there free will what is

11694
03:59:36,070 --> 03:59:36,080
life is there free will what is
 

11695
03:59:36,080 --> 03:59:38,389
life is there free will what is
consciousness and so forth so they got

11696
03:59:38,389 --> 03:59:38,399
consciousness and so forth so they got
 

11697
03:59:38,399 --> 03:59:42,870
consciousness and so forth so they got
the super AGI built and it uh it turned

11698
03:59:42,870 --> 03:59:42,880
the super AGI built and it uh it turned
 

11699
03:59:42,880 --> 03:59:44,870
the super AGI built and it uh it turned
a while it said

11700
03:59:44,870 --> 03:59:44,880
a while it said
 

11701
03:59:44,880 --> 03:59:46,830
a while it said
those are really stupid questions and

11702
03:59:46,830 --> 03:59:46,840
those are really stupid questions and
 

11703
03:59:46,840 --> 03:59:48,469
those are really stupid questions and
then it puts off on the spaceship and

11704
03:59:48,469 --> 03:59:48,479
then it puts off on the spaceship and
 

11705
03:59:48,479 --> 03:59:51,790
then it puts off on the spaceship and
and and and left the Earth right see be

11706
03:59:51,790 --> 03:59:51,800
and and and left the Earth right see be
 

11707
03:59:51,800 --> 03:59:55,590
and and and left the Earth right see be
afraid of scaring it scaring it off that

11708
03:59:55,590 --> 03:59:55,600
afraid of scaring it scaring it off that
 

11709
03:59:55,600 --> 03:59:58,070
afraid of scaring it scaring it off that
that's it yeah I mean honestly

11710
03:59:58,070 --> 03:59:58,080
that's it yeah I mean honestly
 

11711
03:59:58,080 --> 04:00:01,110
that's it yeah I mean honestly
there's there there there there is no

11712
04:00:01,110 --> 04:00:01,120
there's there there there there is no
 

11713
04:00:01,120 --> 04:00:05,750
there's there there there there is no
one question that that rises among among

11714
04:00:05,750 --> 04:00:05,760
one question that that rises among among
 

11715
04:00:05,760 --> 04:00:08,229
one question that that rises among among
all all the all the all the others

11716
04:00:08,229 --> 04:00:08,239
all all the all the all the others
 

11717
04:00:08,239 --> 04:00:11,229
all all the all the all the others
really I mean what interests me more is

11718
04:00:11,229 --> 04:00:11,239
really I mean what interests me more is
 

11719
04:00:11,239 --> 04:00:13,630
really I mean what interests me more is
upgrading my Mo my own intelligence so

11720
04:00:13,630 --> 04:00:13,640
upgrading my Mo my own intelligence so
 

11721
04:00:13,640 --> 04:00:16,510
upgrading my Mo my own intelligence so
that I I can absorb the whole the whole

11722
04:00:16,510 --> 04:00:16,520
that I I can absorb the whole the whole
 

11723
04:00:16,520 --> 04:00:19,349
that I I can absorb the whole the whole
world world view of the of the super AGI

11724
04:00:19,349 --> 04:00:19,359
world world view of the of the super AGI
 

11725
04:00:19,359 --> 04:00:22,030
world world view of the of the super AGI
but I mean of course if if the if the

11726
04:00:22,030 --> 04:00:22,040
but I mean of course if if the if the
 

11727
04:00:22,040 --> 04:00:24,870
but I mean of course if if the if the
answer could be like what's the what is

11728
04:00:24,870 --> 04:00:24,880
answer could be like what's the what is
 

11729
04:00:24,880 --> 04:00:26,870
answer could be like what's the what is
the chemical formula for the immortality

11730
04:00:26,870 --> 04:00:26,880
the chemical formula for the immortality
 

11731
04:00:26,880 --> 04:00:28,469
the chemical formula for the immortality
pill

11732
04:00:28,469 --> 04:00:28,479
pill
 

11733
04:00:28,479 --> 04:00:32,429
pill
like then I would do that or emit emit a

11734
04:00:32,429 --> 04:00:32,439
like then I would do that or emit emit a
 

11735
04:00:32,439 --> 04:00:36,070
like then I would do that or emit emit a
bit string which uh will be the the code

11736
04:00:36,070 --> 04:00:36,080
bit string which uh will be the the code
 

11737
04:00:36,080 --> 04:00:40,149
bit string which uh will be the the code
for a super AGI on the Intel i7

11738
04:00:40,149 --> 04:00:40,159
for a super AGI on the Intel i7
 

11739
04:00:40,159 --> 04:00:42,349
for a super AGI on the Intel i7
processor right so those would be good

11740
04:00:42,349 --> 04:00:42,359
processor right so those would be good
 

11741
04:00:42,359 --> 04:00:45,149
processor right so those would be good
questions so if you're on mind was

11742
04:00:45,149 --> 04:00:45,159
questions so if you're on mind was
 

11743
04:00:45,159 --> 04:00:47,710
questions so if you're on mind was
expanded to become super intelligent

11744
04:00:47,710 --> 04:00:47,720
expanded to become super intelligent
 

11745
04:00:47,720 --> 04:00:51,309
expanded to become super intelligent
like you're describing I mean there's a

11746
04:00:51,309 --> 04:00:51,319
like you're describing I mean there's a
 

11747
04:00:51,319 --> 04:00:53,550
like you're describing I mean there's a
you know there there's kind of a notion

11748
04:00:53,550 --> 04:00:53,560
you know there there's kind of a notion
 

11749
04:00:53,560 --> 04:00:55,590
you know there there's kind of a notion
that with intell intelligence is a

11750
04:00:55,590 --> 04:00:55,600
that with intell intelligence is a
 

11751
04:00:55,600 --> 04:00:58,110
that with intell intelligence is a
burden that it's possible that with

11752
04:00:58,110 --> 04:00:58,120
burden that it's possible that with
 

11753
04:00:58,120 --> 04:01:00,070
burden that it's possible that with
greater and greater intelligence the

11754
04:01:00,070 --> 04:01:00,080
greater and greater intelligence the
 

11755
04:01:00,080 --> 04:01:02,510
greater and greater intelligence the
that other metric of joy that you

11756
04:01:02,510 --> 04:01:02,520
that other metric of joy that you
 

11757
04:01:02,520 --> 04:01:04,149
that other metric of joy that you
mentioned becomes more and more

11758
04:01:04,149 --> 04:01:04,159
mentioned becomes more and more
 

11759
04:01:04,159 --> 04:01:07,189
mentioned becomes more and more
difficult what's your pretty stupid

11760
04:01:07,189 --> 04:01:07,199
difficult what's your pretty stupid
 

11761
04:01:07,199 --> 04:01:09,309
difficult what's your pretty stupid
idea so you think if you're super

11762
04:01:09,309 --> 04:01:09,319
idea so you think if you're super
 

11763
04:01:09,319 --> 04:01:11,510
idea so you think if you're super
intelligent you can also be super joyful

11764
04:01:11,510 --> 04:01:11,520
intelligent you can also be super joyful
 

11765
04:01:11,520 --> 04:01:14,910
intelligent you can also be super joyful
I think getting root access to your own

11766
04:01:14,910 --> 04:01:14,920
I think getting root access to your own
 

11767
04:01:14,920 --> 04:01:17,229
I think getting root access to your own
brain will enable new forms of joy that

11768
04:01:17,229 --> 04:01:17,239
brain will enable new forms of joy that
 

11769
04:01:17,239 --> 04:01:20,269
brain will enable new forms of joy that
we don't have now and I I

11770
04:01:20,269 --> 04:01:20,279
we don't have now and I I
 

11771
04:01:20,279 --> 04:01:23,670
we don't have now and I I
think as I've said before what I aim at

11772
04:01:23,670 --> 04:01:23,680
think as I've said before what I aim at
 

11773
04:01:23,680 --> 04:01:24,990
think as I've said before what I aim at
is

11774
04:01:24,990 --> 04:01:25,000
is
 

11775
04:01:25,000 --> 04:01:27,790
is
really make multiple versions of myself

11776
04:01:27,790 --> 04:01:27,800
really make multiple versions of myself
 

11777
04:01:27,800 --> 04:01:30,269
really make multiple versions of myself
so I would like to keep one version

11778
04:01:30,269 --> 04:01:30,279
so I would like to keep one version
 

11779
04:01:30,279 --> 04:01:33,630
so I would like to keep one version
which is basically human like I am now

11780
04:01:33,630 --> 04:01:33,640
which is basically human like I am now
 

11781
04:01:33,640 --> 04:01:35,910
which is basically human like I am now
but you know keep the dial to turn P

11782
04:01:35,910 --> 04:01:35,920
but you know keep the dial to turn P

pain up and down and get rid of death

11784
04:01:38,389 --> 04:01:38,399
pain up and down and get rid of death
 

11785
04:01:38,399 --> 04:01:39,189
pain up and down and get rid of death
right

11786
04:01:39,189 --> 04:01:39,199
right
 

11787
04:01:39,199 --> 04:01:43,070
right
and make another version which fuses its

04:01:43,070 --> 04:01:43,080
and make another version which fuses its

04:01:43,080 --> 04:01:44,830
and make another version which fuses its
mind with

11790
04:01:44,830 --> 04:01:44,840
mind with
 

11791
04:01:44,840 --> 04:01:48,349
mind with
superhuman AGI and then will become

11792
04:01:48,349 --> 04:01:48,359
superhuman AGI and then will become
 

11793
04:01:48,359 --> 04:01:50,670
superhuman AGI and then will become
massively transhuman and what whether it

11794
04:01:50,670 --> 04:01:50,680
massively transhuman and what whether it
 

11795
04:01:50,680 --> 04:01:52,990
massively transhuman and what whether it
will send some messages back to the

11796
04:01:52,990 --> 04:01:53,000
will send some messages back to the

11799
04:01:54,880 --> 04:01:56,950
human me or not is will be interesting
to find out the thing is once you're

04:01:56,950 --> 04:01:56,960
to find out the thing is once you're
 

11801
04:01:56,960 --> 04:02:00,550
to find out the thing is once you're
super super AGI like one subjective

11802
04:02:00,550 --> 04:02:00,560
super super AGI like one subjective
 

11803
04:02:00,560 --> 04:02:02,429
super super AGI like one subjective
second to a human might be like a

04:02:02,429 --> 04:02:02,439
second to a human might be like a
 

11805
04:02:02,439 --> 04:02:04,189
second to a human might be like a
million subjective years to that super

04:02:04,189 --> 04:02:04,199
million subjective years to that super
 

11807
04:02:04,199 --> 04:02:06,110
million subjective years to that super
AGI right so it would be on a whole

11808
04:02:06,110 --> 04:02:06,120
AGI right so it would be on a whole
 

11809
04:02:06,120 --> 04:02:09,309
AGI right so it would be on a whole
different basis I mean at very least

11810
04:02:09,309 --> 04:02:09,319
different basis I mean at very least
 

11811
04:02:09,319 --> 04:02:10,950
different basis I mean at very least
those two copies will be good to have

11812
04:02:10,950 --> 04:02:10,960
those two copies will be good to have
 

11813
04:02:10,960 --> 04:02:13,149
those two copies will be good to have
but it could could could be interesting

11814
04:02:13,149 --> 04:02:13,159
but it could could could be interesting
 

11815
04:02:13,159 --> 04:02:15,830
but it could could could be interesting
to put your mind into into a dolphin or

11816
04:02:15,830 --> 04:02:15,840
to put your mind into into a dolphin or
 

11817
04:02:15,840 --> 04:02:17,750
to put your mind into into a dolphin or
a space amoeba or all sorts of other

11818
04:02:17,750 --> 04:02:17,760
a space amoeba or all sorts of other
 

11819
04:02:17,760 --> 04:02:19,750
a space amoeba or all sorts of other
things or you can imagine one version

11820
04:02:19,750 --> 04:02:19,760
things or you can imagine one version
 

11821
04:02:19,760 --> 04:02:22,309
things or you can imagine one version
that doubled its intelligence every year

11822
04:02:22,309 --> 04:02:22,319
that doubled its intelligence every year
 

11823
04:02:22,319 --> 04:02:24,189
that doubled its intelligence every year
and another version that just became a

04:02:24,189 --> 04:02:24,199
and another version that just became a
 

11825
04:02:24,199 --> 04:02:26,750
and another version that just became a
super AGI as fast as possible right so I

11826
04:02:26,750 --> 04:02:26,760
super AGI as fast as possible right so I
 

11827
04:02:26,760 --> 04:02:28,910
super AGI as fast as possible right so I
mean now we're sort of constrained to

11828
04:02:28,910 --> 04:02:28,920
mean now we're sort of constrained to
 

11829
04:02:28,920 --> 04:02:33,070
mean now we're sort of constrained to
think one mind one self one body right

11830
04:02:33,070 --> 04:02:33,080
think one mind one self one body right
 

11831
04:02:33,080 --> 04:02:35,349
think one mind one self one body right
but but I think we actually we don't

11832
04:02:35,349 --> 04:02:35,359
but but I think we actually we don't
 

11833
04:02:35,359 --> 04:02:37,630
but but I think we actually we don't
need to be that constrained in in in

11834
04:02:37,630 --> 04:02:37,640
need to be that constrained in in in
 

11835
04:02:37,640 --> 04:02:41,189
need to be that constrained in in in
thinking about future intelligence after

11836
04:02:41,189 --> 04:02:41,199
thinking about future intelligence after
 

11837
04:02:41,199 --> 04:02:43,910
thinking about future intelligence after
we've mastered AGI and nanotchnology

11838
04:02:43,910 --> 04:02:43,920
we've mastered AGI and nanotchnology
 

11839
04:02:43,920 --> 04:02:48,590
we've mastered AGI and nanotchnology
ology and Longevity biology I mean then

11840
04:02:48,590 --> 04:02:48,600
ology and Longevity biology I mean then
 

11841
04:02:48,600 --> 04:02:50,870
ology and Longevity biology I mean then
each of our minds is a certain pattern

11842
04:02:50,870 --> 04:02:50,880
each of our minds is a certain pattern
 

11843
04:02:50,880 --> 04:02:52,870
each of our minds is a certain pattern
of organization right and I I know we

11844
04:02:52,870 --> 04:02:52,880
of organization right and I I know we
 

11845
04:02:52,880 --> 04:02:54,590
of organization right and I I know we
haven't talked about Consciousness but I

11846
04:02:54,590 --> 04:02:54,600
haven't talked about Consciousness but I
 

11847
04:02:54,600 --> 04:02:57,229
haven't talked about Consciousness but I
I sort of I'm pan psychist I sort of

11848
04:02:57,229 --> 04:02:57,239
I sort of I'm pan psychist I sort of
 

11849
04:02:57,239 --> 04:03:00,670
I sort of I'm pan psychist I sort of
view the universe as as conscious and so

11850
04:03:00,670 --> 04:03:00,680
view the universe as as conscious and so
 

11851
04:03:00,680 --> 04:03:04,110
view the universe as as conscious and so
you know a light bulb or a a quark or an

11852
04:03:04,110 --> 04:03:04,120
you know a light bulb or a a quark or an
 

11853
04:03:04,120 --> 04:03:06,870

11855
04:03:06,880 --> 04:03:09,630
ant or a worm or a monkey have their own
manifestations of Consciousness and the

11856
04:03:09,630 --> 04:03:09,640
manifestations of Consciousness and the
 

11857
04:03:09,640 --> 04:03:11,950
manifestations of Consciousness and the
human manifestation of Consciousness

11858
04:03:11,950 --> 04:03:11,960
human manifestation of Consciousness
 

11859
04:03:11,960 --> 04:03:15,349
human manifestation of Consciousness
it's partly tied to the particular meat

11860
04:03:15,349 --> 04:03:15,359
it's partly tied to the particular meat
 

11861
04:03:15,359 --> 04:03:17,830
it's partly tied to the particular meat
that that we're manifested by but it's

11862
04:03:17,830 --> 04:03:17,840
that that we're manifested by but it's
 

11863
04:03:17,840 --> 04:03:20,030
that that we're manifested by but it's
largely tied to the pattern of

11864
04:03:20,030 --> 04:03:20,040
largely tied to the pattern of
 

11865
04:03:20,040 --> 04:03:22,950
largely tied to the pattern of
organization in in in the brain right so

11866
04:03:22,950 --> 04:03:22,960
organization in in in the brain right so
 

11867
04:03:22,960 --> 04:03:24,990
organization in in in the brain right so
if you upload yourself into a computer

if you upload yourself into a computer

04:03:25,000 --> 04:03:27,710
if you upload yourself into a computer

04:03:27,720 --> 04:03:30,910
or a robot or or what whatever else it
is some element of a human consciousness

11872
04:03:30,910 --> 04:03:30,920
is some element of a human consciousness
 

11873
04:03:30,920 --> 04:03:32,510
is some element of a human consciousness
may not be there because it's just tied

11874
04:03:32,510 --> 04:03:32,520
may not be there because it's just tied
 

11875
04:03:32,520 --> 04:03:34,870
may not be there because it's just tied
to the biological embodiment but I think

11876
04:03:34,870 --> 04:03:34,880
to the biological embodiment but I think
 

11877
04:03:34,880 --> 04:03:36,750
to the biological embodiment but I think
most of it will be there and these will

11878
04:03:36,750 --> 04:03:36,760
most of it will be there and these will
 

11879
04:03:36,760 --> 04:03:40,030
most of it will be there and these will
be incarnations of your Consciousness in

11880
04:03:40,030 --> 04:03:40,040
be incarnations of your Consciousness in
 

11881
04:03:40,040 --> 04:03:44,070
be incarnations of your Consciousness in
a slightly different flavor and you know

11882
04:03:44,070 --> 04:03:44,080
a slightly different flavor and you know
 

11883
04:03:44,080 --> 04:03:45,670
a slightly different flavor and you know
creating these different versions will

11884
04:03:45,670 --> 04:03:45,680
creating these different versions will
 

11885
04:03:45,680 --> 04:03:47,389
creating these different versions will
be amazing and each of them will

11886
04:03:47,389 --> 04:03:47,399
be amazing and each of them will
 

11887
04:03:47,399 --> 04:03:51,309
be amazing and each of them will
discover meanings of life that have some

11888
04:03:51,309 --> 04:03:51,319
discover meanings of life that have some
 

11889
04:03:51,319 --> 04:03:54,389
discover meanings of life that have some
overlap but probably not total overlap

either annihilate all life on the planet
 

11929
04:04:44,080 --> 04:04:46,950
either annihilate all life on the planet
or we could lead to a scenario where say

04:04:46,950 --> 04:04:46,960
or we could lead to a scenario where say
 

11931
04:04:46,960 --> 04:04:49,710
or we could lead to a scenario where say
all humans are are annihilated and

all humans are are annihilated and
 

11933

all humans are are annihilated and
there's some super AGI that goes on and

there's some super AGI that goes on and

there's some super AGI that goes on and
does it does its own thing unrelated to

04:04:55,070 --> 04:04:55,080
does it does its own thing unrelated to
 

11937
04:04:55,080 --> 04:04:57,469
does it does its own thing unrelated to
us except via our our role in in

04:04:57,469 --> 04:04:57,479
us except via our our role in in
 

11939
04:04:57,479 --> 04:05:00,429
us except via our our role in in
originating it and we may well be at a

04:05:00,429 --> 04:05:00,439
originating it and we may well be at a
 

11941
04:05:00,439 --> 04:05:02,590
originating it and we may well be at a
bifurcation point now right where where

11942
04:05:02,590 --> 04:05:02,600
bifurcation point now right where where
 

11943
04:05:02,600 --> 04:05:05,349
bifurcation point now right where where
what we do now has significant causal

11944
04:05:05,349 --> 04:05:05,359
what we do now has significant causal
 

11945
04:05:05,359 --> 04:05:07,510
what we do now has significant causal
impact on what comes about and yet most

11946
04:05:07,510 --> 04:05:07,520
impact on what comes about and yet most
 

11947
04:05:07,520 --> 04:05:09,630
impact on what comes about and yet most
people on the planet aren't thinking

11948
04:05:09,630 --> 04:05:09,640
people on the planet aren't thinking
 

11949
04:05:09,640 --> 04:05:12,149
people on the planet aren't thinking
that way whatsoever they're thinking

11950
04:05:12,149 --> 04:05:12,159
that way whatsoever they're thinking
 

11951
04:05:12,159 --> 04:05:15,830
that way whatsoever they're thinking
only about their own narrow a narrow

11952
04:05:15,830 --> 04:05:15,840
only about their own narrow a narrow
 

11953
04:05:15,840 --> 04:05:18,189
only about their own narrow a narrow
aims and Asim aims and goals right now

11954
04:05:18,189 --> 04:05:18,199
aims and Asim aims and goals right now
 

11955
04:05:18,199 --> 04:05:20,229
aims and Asim aims and goals right now
of course I'm thinking about my own

11956
04:05:20,229 --> 04:05:20,239
of course I'm thinking about my own
 

11957
04:05:20,239 --> 04:05:22,710
of course I'm thinking about my own
narrow aims and goals to some

11958
04:05:22,710 --> 04:05:22,720
narrow aims and goals to some
 

11959
04:05:22,720 --> 04:05:25,710
narrow aims and goals to some
extent also but I'm I'm trying to use as

11960
04:05:25,710 --> 04:05:25,720
extent also but I'm I'm trying to use as
 

11961
04:05:25,720 --> 04:05:29,670
extent also but I'm I'm trying to use as
much of my energy and mind as I can to

11962
04:05:29,670 --> 04:05:29,680
much of my energy and mind as I can to
 

11963
04:05:29,680 --> 04:05:32,229
much of my energy and mind as I can to
push toward this more benevolent

11964
04:05:32,229 --> 04:05:32,239
push toward this more benevolent
 

11965
04:05:32,239 --> 04:05:34,309
push toward this more benevolent
alternative which will be better for me

11966
04:05:34,309 --> 04:05:34,319
alternative which will be better for me
 

11967
04:05:34,319 --> 04:05:37,429
alternative which will be better for me
but Al but also for also for everybody

11968
04:05:37,429 --> 04:05:37,439
but Al but also for also for everybody
 

11969
04:05:37,439 --> 04:05:40,590
but Al but also for also for everybody
else and that's a it's weird that so few

11970
04:05:40,590 --> 04:05:40,600
else and that's a it's weird that so few
 

11971
04:05:40,600 --> 04:05:43,429
else and that's a it's weird that so few
people understand what's going on I know

11972
04:05:43,429 --> 04:05:43,439
people understand what's going on I know
 

11973
04:05:43,439 --> 04:05:45,189
people understand what's going on I know
you interviewed Elon Musk and he

11974
04:05:45,189 --> 04:05:45,199
you interviewed Elon Musk and he
 

11975
04:05:45,199 --> 04:05:47,429
you interviewed Elon Musk and he
understands a lot of what's going on but

11976
04:05:47,429 --> 04:05:47,439
understands a lot of what's going on but
 

11977
04:05:47,439 --> 04:05:49,189
understands a lot of what's going on but
he's much more paranoid than I am right

11978
04:05:49,189 --> 04:05:49,199
he's much more paranoid than I am right
 

11979
04:05:49,199 --> 04:05:52,070
he's much more paranoid than I am right
because because Elon gets that AGI is

11980
04:05:52,070 --> 04:05:52,080
because because Elon gets that AGI is
 

11981
04:05:52,080 --> 04:05:53,950
because because Elon gets that AGI is
going to be way way Smarter Than People

11982
04:05:53,950 --> 04:05:53,960
going to be way way Smarter Than People
 

11983
04:05:53,960 --> 04:05:56,469
going to be way way Smarter Than People
yeah and he gets that an AGI does not

11984
04:05:56,469 --> 04:05:56,479
yeah and he gets that an AGI does not
 

11985
04:05:56,479 --> 04:05:58,309
yeah and he gets that an AGI does not
necessarily have to give a about

11986
04:05:58,309 --> 04:05:58,319
necessarily have to give a about
 

11987
04:05:58,319 --> 04:06:00,630
necessarily have to give a about
people because we're very Elementary

11988
04:06:00,630 --> 04:06:00,640
people because we're very Elementary

11991
04:06:02,279 --> 04:06:05,349

to many a many agis but I don't think he

11992
04:06:05,349 --> 04:06:05,359
to many a many agis but I don't think he
 

11993
04:06:05,359 --> 04:06:08,510
to many a many agis but I don't think he
has a Clear Vision of how infusing early

11994
04:06:08,510 --> 04:06:08,520
has a Clear Vision of how infusing early

11997
04:06:12,640 --> 04:06:16,630

out there now that may be different five

12022
04:06:46,030 --> 04:06:46,040
out there now that may be different five
 

12023
04:06:46,040 --> 04:06:47,950
out there now that may be different five
or 10 years from now though because I I

12024
04:06:47,950 --> 04:06:47,960
or 10 years from now though because I I
 

12025
04:06:47,960 --> 04:06:50,550
or 10 years from now though because I I
can see understanding of AGI and

12026
04:06:50,550 --> 04:06:50,560
can see understanding of AGI and
 

12027
04:06:50,560 --> 04:06:53,349

Longevity and other such issues is

12028
04:06:53,349 --> 04:06:53,359
Longevity and other such issues is
 

12029
04:06:53,359 --> 04:06:54,830
Longevity and other such issues is
certainly much stronger and more

12030
04:06:54,830 --> 04:06:54,840
certainly much stronger and more
 

12031
04:06:54,840 --> 04:06:57,070
certainly much stronger and more

a historical Sense on the other hand you

12040
04:07:08,389 --> 04:07:08,399
a historical Sense on the other hand you
 

12041
04:07:08,399 --> 04:07:10,309
a historical Sense on the other hand you
could say the progress is astoundingly

12042
04:07:10,309 --> 04:07:10,319
could say the progress is astoundingly
 

12043
04:07:10,319 --> 04:07:14,269
could say the progress is astoundingly
fast but Elon also said I think on The

04:07:14,269 --> 04:07:14,279
fast but Elon also said I think on The

Joe Rogan podcast that love is the

12046
04:07:16,389 --> 04:07:16,399
Joe Rogan podcast that love is the
 

12047
04:07:16,399 --> 04:07:19,990
Joe Rogan podcast that love is the
answer so uh maybe in that way you and

12048
04:07:19,990 --> 04:07:20,000
answer so uh maybe in that way you and
 

12049
04:07:20,000 --> 04:07:22,710
answer so uh maybe in that way you and
him are both on the same page of how we

04:07:22,710 --> 04:07:22,720
him are both on the same page of how we
 

12051
04:07:22,720 --> 04:07:25,389
him are both on the same page of how we
should proceed with AI I think there's

12052
04:07:25,389 --> 04:07:25,399
should proceed with AI I think there's
 

12053
04:07:25,399 --> 04:07:28,070
should proceed with AI I think there's
no better place to end it I hope we get

12054
04:07:28,070 --> 04:07:28,080
no better place to end it I hope we get
 

12055
04:07:28,080 --> 04:07:31,229
no better place to end it I hope we get
