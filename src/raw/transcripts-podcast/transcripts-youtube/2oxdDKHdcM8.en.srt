exceptionally difficult that naive
 

227
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,230

revolutionizing how stuff is done or
 

241
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,029
revolutionizing how stuff is done or
doing huge building projects where like

242
00:05:10,029 --> 00:05:10,039
doing huge building projects where like
 

243
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:12,909
doing huge building projects where like
you said so many people are involved in

244
00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:12,919
you said so many people are involved in
 

245
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:14,909
you said so many people are involved in
making that happen we get conditioned

246
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:14,919
making that happen we get conditioned
 

247
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:17,629
making that happen we get conditioned
out of that feeling yeah we start to

248
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:17,639
out of that feeling yeah we start to
 

249
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,070
out of that feeling yeah we start to
become insecure and it's we start to

250
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,080
become insecure and it's we start to
 

251
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,230
become insecure and it's we start to
rely on the input or validation of

252
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:23,240
rely on the input or validation of
 

253
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,870
rely on the input or validation of
others and it takes us away from that

254
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:25,880
others and it takes us away from that
 

255
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,230
others and it takes us away from that
sort of core drive and um and ambition

256
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,240
sort of core drive and um and ambition
 

257
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,749
sort of core drive and um and ambition
so it's it's it's fun to to reflect on

realize that it's actually a lot of work
to build I still am amazed just looking

274
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,080
to build I still am amazed just looking
 

275
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,150
to build I still am amazed just looking
at big buildings big bridges that human

276
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,160
at big buildings big bridges that human
 

277
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,710
at big buildings big bridges that human
beings are able to get together and

00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,120
favorite things about architecture is
 

283
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,029

different city skylines and it's it's
 

299
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,670
different city skylines and it's it's
almost like um a visual depiction of

00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:24,680
almost like um a visual depiction of
 

301
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,029
almost like um a visual depiction of
ambition realized right like it's a

and in some cases failures um if the
projects weren't properly executed so so

312
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:43,560
projects weren't properly executed so so
 

313
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,909

music that that really resonated with me
 

321
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,390
music that that really resonated with me
I love thinking about a city skyline as

322
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,400
I love thinking about a city skyline as
 

323
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,670
I love thinking about a city skyline as
an ensemble of Dreams realized yeah I

324
00:06:59,670 --> 00:06:59,680
an ensemble of Dreams realized yeah I
 

325
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,950
an ensemble of Dreams realized yeah I
remember the first time I I went to um

326
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:02,960
remember the first time I I went to um
 

327
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,230
remember the first time I I went to um
Dubai and I was watching them dredging

328
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,240
Dubai and I was watching them dredging
 

329
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,469
Dubai and I was watching them dredging
out and and creating these man-made

330
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
out and and creating these man-made
 

331
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,550
out and and creating these man-made
islands and I remember somebody once

332
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:10,560
islands and I remember somebody once
 

333
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,589
islands and I remember somebody once
saying to me there an architect um an

334
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:13,599
saying to me there an architect um an
 

335
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,749
saying to me there an architect um an
architect actually who collaborated with

336
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:15,759
architect actually who collaborated with
 

337
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,589
architect actually who collaborated with
us on on our Tower in Chicago he said

338
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:18,599
us on on our Tower in Chicago he said
 

339
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:20,749
us on on our Tower in Chicago he said
that the only thing that limited what an

340
00:07:20,749 --> 00:07:20,759
that the only thing that limited what an
 

341
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:23,629
that the only thing that limited what an
architect could do in that area was

342
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:23,639
architect could do in that area was
 

343
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,909
architect could do in that area was
gravity and

344
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:25,919
gravity and
 

345
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,629
gravity and
Imagination so it's it's you know yeah

346
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:28,639
Imagination so it's it's you know yeah
 

347
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,070
Imagination so it's it's you know yeah
but gravity is a trick want to work

348
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,080
but gravity is a trick want to work
 

349
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,110
but gravity is a trick want to work
against and that's where civil engineer

350
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:32,120
against and that's where civil engineer
 

351
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,430
against and that's where civil engineer
is one of my favorite things I used to

352
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:33,440
is one of my favorite things I used to
 

353
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,469
is one of my favorite things I used to
build uh bridges in high school for

354
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:35,479
build uh bridges in high school for
 

355
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:37,469
build uh bridges in high school for
physics classes you have to build

356
00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:37,479
physics classes you have to build
 

357
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:39,309
physics classes you have to build
Bridges and you compete on how much

358
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:39,319
Bridges and you compete on how much
 

359
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:40,950
Bridges and you compete on how much
weight they can carry relative to their

360
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:40,960
weight they can carry relative to their
 

361
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,710
weight they can carry relative to their
own weight yeah you study how good it is

362
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:43,720
own weight yeah you study how good it is
 

363
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,430
own weight yeah you study how good it is
by finding its breaking point and that

364
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:47,440
by finding its breaking point and that
 

365
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,589
by finding its breaking point and that
was a deep appreciation for me on the

366
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:49,599
was a deep appreciation for me on the
 

367
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,270
was a deep appreciation for me on the
miniature scale of on the large scale

368
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:52,280
miniature scale of on the large scale
 

369
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,629
miniature scale of on the large scale
what people are able to do with civil

370
00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:53,639
what people are able to do with civil
 

371
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,909
what people are able to do with civil
engineering because gravity is a tricky

372
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:55,919
engineering because gravity is a tricky
 

373
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,309
engineering because gravity is a tricky
one to fight against it definitely is

374
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:58,319
one to fight against it definitely is
 

375
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,589
one to fight against it definitely is
and bridges I mean some of the iconic

376
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:00,599
and bridges I mean some of the iconic
 

377
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:03,790
and bridges I mean some of the iconic
designs in in our country are incredible

378
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:03,800
designs in in our country are incredible
 

379
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,070
designs in in our country are incredible
Bridges so if we think of uh skylines as

380
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:07,080
Bridges so if we think of uh skylines as
 

381
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,070
Bridges so if we think of uh skylines as
ensembles of Dreams realized you spent

382
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,080
ensembles of Dreams realized you spent
 

383
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,830
ensembles of Dreams realized you spent
quite a bit of time in New York what

384
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:11,840

what's a good picture we're looking here

390
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:18,919
what's a good picture we're looking here
 

391
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:22,510
what's a good picture we're looking here
at a few I mean looking over the water

392
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:22,520
at a few I mean looking over the water
 

393
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,749
at a few I mean looking over the water
well I think the water is an

394
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:23,759
well I think the water is an
 

395
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,390
well I think the water is an
unbelievable feature of the New York

396
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,400
unbelievable feature of the New York
 

397
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,830
unbelievable feature of the New York
skyline um as you see the island on

398
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:29,840
skyline um as you see the island on
 

399
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,110
skyline um as you see the island on
approach and often times you'll see like

400
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:32,120
approach and often times you'll see like
 

401
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,350
approach and often times you'll see like
in these images you'll see these towers

402
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:35,360
in these images you'll see these towers
 

403
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,310
in these images you'll see these towers
reflecting off of the water surface so I

404
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:38,320
reflecting off of the water surface so I
 

405
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,389
reflecting off of the water surface so I
think there's something very beautiful

406
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:40,399
think there's something very beautiful
 

407
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,589
think there's something very beautiful
and um and unique about that when I look

408
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:43,599
and um and unique about that when I look
 

409
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,190
and um and unique about that when I look
at New York I I see this unbelievable

410
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:46,200
at New York I I see this unbelievable
 

411
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,110
at New York I I see this unbelievable
sort of tapestry of different types of

412
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:48,120
sort of tapestry of different types of
 

413
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,910
sort of tapestry of different types of
architecture so you have the gothic form

414
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:51,920
architecture so you have the gothic form
 

415
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,910
architecture so you have the gothic form
um as represented by buildings like the

416
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:53,920
um as represented by buildings like the
 

417
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,190
um as represented by buildings like the
Woolworth Building or you'll have Art

418
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:56,200
Woolworth Building or you'll have Art
 

419

429
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,269
modern examples or modernist examples
like lever house and serum's house so

430
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:12,279
like lever house and serum's house so
 

431
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:14,949

you have all of these different styles
 

433
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,509
you have all of these different styles
and I think to build in New York you're

434
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519
and I think to build in New York you're
 

435
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,750
and I think to build in New York you're
really building the best of the best so

436
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:19,760
really building the best of the best so
 

437
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,790
really building the best of the best so
nobody's giving New York their sort of

438
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:21,800
nobody's giving New York their sort of
 

439
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,269
nobody's giving New York their sort of
second rate work um and uh especially

440
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:25,279
second rate work um and uh especially
 

441
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,750
second rate work um and uh especially
when a lot of those buildings were built

442
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:26,760
when a lot of those buildings were built
 

443
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,990
when a lot of those buildings were built
there was this incredible competition

444
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:29,000
there was this incredible competition
 

445
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,590
there was this incredible competition
happening between New York and Chicago

446
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:32,600
happening between New York and Chicago
 

447
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,750
happening between New York and Chicago
for kind of dominance of the sky and for

448
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:36,760
for kind of dominance of the sky and for
 

449
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,230
for kind of dominance of the sky and for
who could create the greatest Skyline

450
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,240
who could create the greatest Skyline
 

451
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,069
who could create the greatest Skyline
that sort of raced to the sky when

452
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:40,079
that sort of raced to the sky when
 

453
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,949
that sort of raced to the sky when
skyscrapers were first being built

454
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:41,959
skyscrapers were first being built
 

455
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:44,870
skyscrapers were first being built
starting in Chicago and and then New

456
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
starting in Chicago and and then New
 

457
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,190
starting in Chicago and and then New
York surpassing that in terms of height

458
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,200
York surpassing that in terms of height
 

459
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,670
York surpassing that in terms of height
at least um with with the Empire State

460
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:49,680
at least um with with the Empire State
 

461
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,790
at least um with with the Empire State
Building so I love sort of

462
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:51,800
Building so I love sort of
 

463
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,990
Building so I love sort of
contextualizing the skylines as well and

464
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,000
contextualizing the skylines as well and
 

465
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,790
contextualizing the skylines as well and
thinking back to um when different

466
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:57,800
thinking back to um when different
 

467
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,630
thinking back to um when different
components that are so iconic were were

468
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:00,640
components that are so iconic were were
 

469
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,630
components that are so iconic were were
added in in the context in which they

470
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:02,640
added in in the context in which they
 

471
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,230
added in in the context in which they
came into being I got to ask you about

472
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:05,240
came into being I got to ask you about
 

473
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,110
came into being I got to ask you about
this there's a pretty cool page uh that

474
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:08,120
this there's a pretty cool page uh that
 

475
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,870
this there's a pretty cool page uh that
I've been following on X architecture

476
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:09,880
I've been following on X architecture
 

477
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,389
I've been following on X architecture
and tradition and they celebrate sort of

478
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:12,399
and tradition and they celebrate sort of
 

479
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,350
and tradition and they celebrate sort of

component of um sort of a composition
that comes together I think in this case

00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:26,760
tricky it's you have to get the shade
 

589
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,269

right um you know some glass has a lot

590
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:29,279
right um you know some glass has a lot
 

591
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,269
right um you know some glass has a lot
of iron in it and get super green um and

592
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:32,279
of iron in it and get super green um and
 

593
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:34,910
of iron in it and get super green um and
that's a choice and uh sometimes you

594
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:34,920
that's a choice and uh sometimes you
 

595
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,069
that's a choice and uh sometimes you
have more blue properties blue silver

596
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:37,079
have more blue properties blue silver
 

597
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:39,430
have more blue properties blue silver
like you see here but it's it's it's

598
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:39,440
like you see here but it's it's it's
 

599
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,389
like you see here but it's it's it's
part of the character how do you know

600
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:41,399
part of the character how do you know
 

601
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:42,829
part of the character how do you know
what it's actually going to look like

602
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:42,839
what it's actually going to look like
 

603
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,750
what it's actually going to look like
when it's done like is it possible to

604
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:44,760
when it's done like is it possible to
 

605
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,990
when it's done like is it possible to
imagine that because it feels like

606
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,000
imagine that because it feels like
 

607

there's so many variables I think so I

608
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:48,519
there's so many variables I think so I
 

609
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:52,189
there's so many variables I think so I
think if you have a vivid imagination if

610
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:52,199
think if you have a vivid imagination if
 

611
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:55,230
think if you have a vivid imagination if
you sit with it and then if you also go

612
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:55,240
you sit with it and then if you also go
 

613
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,430
you sit with it and then if you also go
beyond the rendering right you have to

614
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:58,440
beyond the rendering right you have to
 

615
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,590
beyond the rendering right you have to
you have to live with materials so you

616
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:00,600
you have to live with materials so you
 

617
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,870
you have to live with materials so you
don't build a 92 story building glass

618
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:02,880
don't build a 92 story building glass
 

619
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,150
don't build a 92 story building glass
curtain wall and

620
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:05,160
curtain wall and
 

621
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,150
curtain wall and
not deeply examine the actual curtain

622
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:09,160
not deeply examine the actual curtain
 

623
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,470
not deeply examine the actual curtain
wall before purchasing it so you have to

624
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:11,480
wall before purchasing it so you have to
 

625
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,150
wall before purchasing it so you have to
spend a lot of time with the actual

626
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:13,160
spend a lot of time with the actual
 

627
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,990
spend a lot of time with the actual
materials not just um the beautiful sort

628
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,000
materials not just um the beautiful sort
 

629
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,269
materials not just um the beautiful sort
of artistic renderings um which can be

630
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:19,279
of artistic renderings um which can be
 

631
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,509
of artistic renderings um which can be
incredibly misleading um the goal is

632
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:22,519
incredibly misleading um the goal is
 

633
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:25,189
incredibly misleading um the goal is
actually that the the end result is much

634
00:13:25,189 --> 00:13:25,199
actually that the the end result is much
 

635
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:28,629
actually that the the end result is much
much more compelling um than than what

636
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:28,639
much more compelling um than than what
 

637
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,590
much more compelling um than than what

733
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,910
it's huge and in the context of a city
where there's a lot of height yeah um so

734
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:26,920
where there's a lot of height yeah um so
 

735
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,629
where there's a lot of height yeah um so
it's it's unbelievable but I think one

me the most about architecture right now

740
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:34,560
me the most about architecture right now
 

741
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,829
me the most about architecture right now
is the Innovation that's happening

742
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:35,839
is the Innovation that's happening
 

743
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,110
is the Innovation that's happening
within it you know there's example of

744
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,120
within it you know there's example of

and thinking about how to create more

756
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:55,199
and thinking about how to create more
 

757
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,189
and thinking about how to create more
sustainable development practices quite

758
00:15:58,189 --> 00:15:58,199
sustainable development practices quite
 

759
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:01,110

that will biodegrade back into the Earth
 

763
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,309
that will biodegrade back into the Earth
I think there's something really cool

764
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:05,319
I think there's something really cool
 

765
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:07,309
I think there's something really cool
happening now with the rediscovery of

766
00:16:07,309 --> 00:16:07,319
happening now with the rediscovery of
 

767
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:09,430
happening now with the rediscovery of
ancient building techniques so you have

768
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:09,440
ancient building techniques so you have
 

769
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,350
ancient building techniques so you have
self-healing concrete that was used by

770
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:11,360
self-healing concrete that was used by
 

771
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,110
self-healing concrete that was used by
the Romans an art and a practice of

772
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:15,120
the Romans an art and a practice of
 

773
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,069
the Romans an art and a practice of
using volcanic ash and lime that's now

774
00:16:19,069 --> 00:16:19,079
using volcanic ash and lime that's now
 

775
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:21,910
using volcanic ash and lime that's now
being rediscovered and is more critical

776
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:21,920
being rediscovered and is more critical
 

777
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,910
being rediscovered and is more critical
than ever as we think about how much of

778
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:23,920
than ever as we think about how much of
 

779
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,870
than ever as we think about how much of
our infrastructure relies on concrete

780
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:26,880
our infrastructure relies on concrete
 

781
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,069
our infrastructure relies on concrete
and how much of that is failing on the

782
00:16:29,069 --> 00:16:29,079
and how much of that is failing on the
 

783
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:31,389
and how much of that is failing on the
most basic level so I think actually

784
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:31,399
most basic level so I think actually
 

785
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:34,509
most basic level so I think actually
it's a really really exciting time um

786
00:16:34,509 --> 00:16:34,519
it's a really really exciting time um
 

787
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:36,710
it's a really really exciting time um
for innovation in architecture and I

788
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:36,720
for innovation in architecture and I
 

789
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,790
for innovation in architecture and I
think there are some incredible examples

790
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:39,800
think there are some incredible examples
 

791
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,590
think there are some incredible examples
of of of modern design that are are

792
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:43,600
of of of modern design that are are
 

793
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,470
of of of modern design that are are
really exciting but generally I think

794
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:46,480
really exciting but generally I think
 

795
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,990

about using the water for the reflection

954
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:05,600
about using the water for the reflection
 

955
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,190
about using the water for the reflection
and the shape that creates I mean

956
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:07,200
and the shape that creates I mean
 

957
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,149
and the shape that creates I mean
there's an Elegance to the shape of a of

958
00:20:09,149 --> 00:20:09,159
there's an Elegance to the shape of a of
 

959
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:10,870
there's an Elegance to the shape of a of
a bridge see it's interesting that they

960
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:10,880
a bridge see it's interesting that they
 

961
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,110
a bridge see it's interesting that they
call it Devil's Bridge because to me

962
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,120
call it Devil's Bridge because to me
 

963
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,990
call it Devil's Bridge because to me
this is very ethereal you know I think

964
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,000
this is very ethereal you know I think
 

965
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,430
this is very ethereal you know I think
about the ring the circle um life

966
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:19,440
about the ring the circle um life
 

967
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,230
about the ring the circle um life
there's nothing about this that makes me

968
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:21,240
there's nothing about this that makes me
 

969
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,390
there's nothing about this that makes me
feel maybe they're just being

970
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:23,400
feel maybe they're just being
 

971
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,950
feel maybe they're just being
ironic in the name that functions really

972
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:25,960
ironic in the name that functions really
 

973
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,270
ironic in the name that functions really
flaw yeah exactly maybe but he's ever

974
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:29,280
flaw yeah exactly maybe but he's ever
 

975
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,110
flaw yeah exactly maybe but he's ever
successfully crossed crossed the bridge

976
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:31,120
successfully crossed crossed the bridge
 

977
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,990
successfully crossed crossed the bridge
yeah but I mean to me there's just

978
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:33,000
yeah but I mean to me there's just
 

979
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,070
yeah but I mean to me there's just
iconic I love looking at Bridges because

980
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:35,080
iconic I love looking at Bridges because
 

981
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,310
iconic I love looking at Bridges because
because of the function it's the

982
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:36,320
because of the function it's the
 

983
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,830
because of the function it's the
Brooklyn Bridge or the Golden Gate

984
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:37,840

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,669
Bridge kind of represents the turmoil
and the busyness of a city as it creates

1004
00:21:04,669 --> 00:21:04,679
and the busyness of a city as it creates
 

1005
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:07,350
and the busyness of a city as it creates
it's cool and the connectivity as well

1006
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:07,360
it's cool and the connectivity as well
 

1007
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,230
it's cool and the connectivity as well
yeah the network of roads all come

1008
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:09,240
yeah the network of roads all come
 

1009
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,710
yeah the network of roads all come
together so the there the bridge is the

1010
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:11,720
together so the there the bridge is the
 

1011
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,070
together so the there the bridge is the
ultimate combination of function and and

1012
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:15,080
ultimate combination of function and and

cable stay um versus the suspension
bridge and I mean you actually built

1020
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:25,640
bridge and I mean you actually built
 

1021
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,510
bridge and I mean you actually built
many replicas so I'm sure you'll have a

1022
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:27,520
many replicas so I'm sure you'll have a
 

1023

00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:36,120
growing up in New York that was as much
 

1031
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:40,430
growing up in New York that was as much
a part of the architectural story and

are in a lot of ways much more
 

1061
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,269
are in a lot of ways much more
complicated because you have

1062
00:22:20,269 --> 00:22:20,279
complicated because you have
 

1063
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:22,710
complicated because you have
existing attributes but also a lot of

1064
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:22,720
existing attributes but also a lot of
 

1065
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,310
existing attributes but also a lot of
limitations you have to work within

1066
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:24,320
limitations you have to work within
 

1067
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,789
limitations you have to work within
especially when you're repurposing a use

1068

when you're working within a building
 

1253

when you're working within a building
like this every single room was

1254
00:26:24,029 --> 00:26:24,039
like this every single room was
 

1255
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:25,510
like this every single room was
different you see the setback so the

1256
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:25,520
different you see the setback so the
 

1257
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,269
different you see the setback so the
setback then required you to move the

1258
00:26:28,269 --> 00:26:28,279
setback then required you to move the
 

1259
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:32,070

pluming so there was no um it was really

1260
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,080
pluming so there was no um it was really
 

1261
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,510
pluming so there was no um it was really
a labor of love and to do something like

1262
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:34,520
a labor of love and to do something like
 

1263
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,590
a labor of love and to do something like
this and and that's why I think

1264
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:35,600
this and and that's why I think
 

1265
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,789
this and and that's why I think
renovation we had it with deral as well

1266
00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:37,799
renovation we had it with deral as well
 

1267

renovation we had it with deral as well
it was 700 rooms over um over 650 Acres

1268
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:43,880

it was 700 rooms over um over 650 Acres
of of property and so every single unit

1270
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:47,600
of of property and so every single unit
 

1271
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,630

was was very different and complicated
 

1273
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,269
was was very different and complicated
not not as complicated in some ways the

1274
00:26:52,269 --> 00:26:52,279
not not as complicated in some ways the
 

1275
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:55,430
not not as complicated in some ways the
scale of it was so massive but not as

scale of it was so massive but not as
 

1277
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,830

00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:01,360
precision and I think in real estate you
 

1283
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,909
precision and I think in real estate you
have a lot of people who design on plan

1284
00:27:04,909 --> 00:27:04,919
have a lot of people who design on plan
 

1285
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:07,750

1290
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:12,600
flipping so it's more financial
 

1291
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,590
flipping so it's more financial
engineering than it is

1292
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:15,600
engineering than it is
 

1293
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,990

building and they don't spend the time

1294
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:19,000
building and they don't spend the time
 

1295
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,830
building and they don't spend the time
sort of sweating these details that make

1296
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:20,840
sort of sweating these details that make
 

1297
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,310
sort of sweating these details that make
something great and make something

1298

something great and make something
 

1299
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,710
something great and make something
functional and you feel it in the end

1300
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:25,720
functional and you feel it in the end
 

1301
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:29,190

years of my life for for those projects
 

1305
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:34,070
years of my life for for those projects
and and it was worth it I I enjoyed

1306
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:34,080
and and it was worth it I I enjoyed
 

1307
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,430
and and it was worth it I I enjoyed
almost I enjoyed almost every minute of

00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:36,440
almost I enjoyed almost every minute of
 

1309
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,590

it so to you it's not about the flipping

1310
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:38,600
it so to you it's not about the flipping
 

1311
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,590
it so to you it's not about the flipping
to you it's about the art of the and the

1312
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:41,600
to you it's about the art of the and the
 

1313
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,470
to you it's about the art of the and the
function of the thing that you're

1314
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:43,480
function of the thing that you're
 

1315
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,430
function of the thing that you're
creating 100% what's design on plan I'm

1316
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:47,440
creating 100% what's design on plan I'm
 

1317
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,149
creating 100% what's design on plan I'm
learning you things today um when when

1318
00:27:51,149 --> 00:27:51,159
learning you things today um when when

proposals are put forth by an architect

1320
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:53,279
proposals are put forth by an architect
 

1321
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,590
proposals are put forth by an architect
and and really just the plan is accepted

1322
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:55,600
and and really just the plan is accepted
 

1323
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,590
and and really just the plan is accepted
without and in the case of a renovation

1324
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:57,600
without and in the case of a renovation
 

1325
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,310
without and in the case of a renovation
like if you're not walking those rooms

1326
00:27:59,310 --> 00:27:59,320
like if you're not walking those rooms
 

1327
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,549
like if you're not walking those rooms
the number of times a beautifully laid

1328
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:01,559
the number of times a beautifully laid
 

1329
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:04,389
the number of times a beautifully laid
out room was on a blueprint and then I'd

1330
00:28:04,389 --> 00:28:04,399
out room was on a blueprint and then I'd
 

1331
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:08,230
out room was on a blueprint and then I'd
go to Washington and I'd walk that floor

1332
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:08,240
go to Washington and I'd walk that floor
 

1333
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,909
go to Washington and I'd walk that floor
and I'd realize that there was a column

1334
00:28:09,909 --> 00:28:09,919
and I'd realize that there was a column
 

1335
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,269
and I'd realize that there was a column
that ran right up through the middle of

1336
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:11,279
that ran right up through the middle of
 

1337
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,310
that ran right up through the middle of
the space where you know the bed was

1338
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:13,320
the space where you know the bed was
 

1339
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,710
the space where you know the bed was
supposed to be or the toilet was

1340
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:14,720
supposed to be or the toilet was
 

1341
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,110
supposed to be or the toilet was
supposed to be or um or the shower so

1342
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:18,120
supposed to be or um or the shower so
 

1343
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,470
supposed to be or um or the shower so
there's a lot of things that are missed

1344
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:21,480
there's a lot of things that are missed
 

1345
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,310
there's a lot of things that are missed
um when you do

1346
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:23,320
um when you do
 

1347
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,190
um when you do
something conceptually without sort of

1348
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:26,200
something conceptually without sort of
 

1349
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,789
something conceptually without sort of
rooting it and um in the actual

1350
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:28,799
rooting it and um in the actual
 

1351
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,630
rooting it and um in the actual
structure and that's why I think even

1352
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:30,640
structure and that's why I think even
 

1353
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,110
structure and that's why I think even
you know with groundup construction as

1354
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:32,120
you know with groundup construction as
 

1355
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,549
you know with groundup construction as
well people who aren't constantly on

1356
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:34,559
well people who aren't constantly on
 

1357
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,549
well people who aren't constantly on
their job sites constantly walking the

1358
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:36,559
their job sites constantly walking the
 

1359
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,549
their job sites constantly walking the
projects there's just a lot that's

1360
00:28:39,549 --> 00:28:39,559
projects there's just a lot that's
 

1361
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:41,909
projects there's just a lot that's
there's a lot that's missed I mean

1362
00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:41,919
there's a lot that's missed I mean
 

1363
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,549
there's a lot that's missed I mean
there's a wisdom to the the idea that we

1364
00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:44,559
there's a wisdom to the the idea that we
 

1365
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,669
there's a wisdom to the the idea that we
talked about before live with the

talked about before live with the
 

1367
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:49,389
talked about before live with the
materials and walking the construction

1368
00:28:49,389 --> 00:28:49,399
materials and walking the construction
 

1369
00:28:49,399 --> 00:28:51,190
materials and walking the construction
site walk in the rooms I mean that's

1370
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:51,200
site walk in the rooms I mean that's
 

1371
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,110
site walk in the rooms I mean that's
what you hear from people like Steve

the factory floor that's why you

1376
00:28:58,549 --> 00:28:58,559
the factory floor that's why you
 

1377
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,990
the factory floor that's why you
constantly obsess about the details the

1378
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:01,000
constantly obsess about the details the
 

1379
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,630
constantly obsess about the details the

overdesigned in the circumstance of a

2612
00:55:43,349 --> 00:55:43,359
overdesigned in the circumstance of a
 

2613
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:47,069
overdesigned in the circumstance of a
1,000-year storm you will have the exact

2614
00:55:47,069 --> 00:55:47,079
1,000-year storm you will have the exact
 

2615
00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:48,750
1,000-year storm you will have the exact
P perfect temperature if there's a

2616
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:48,760
P perfect temperature if there's a
 

2617
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,750
P perfect temperature if there's a
massive Blizzard or if it's unbearably

2618

massive Blizzard or if it's unbearably
 

2619
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,549
massive Blizzard or if it's unbearably
hot but 99.9% of the time you'll never

2620
00:55:54,549 --> 00:55:54,559
hot but 99.9% of the time you'll never
 

2621
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,750
hot but 99.9% of the time you'll never
need it and um

2622
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:56,760
need it and um
 

2623
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,670
need it and um
and so I think it's just an enormous

2624
00:55:58,670 --> 00:55:58,680
and so I think it's just an enormous
 

2625
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,029
and so I think it's just an enormous
waste of

2626
00:56:00,029 --> 00:56:00,039
waste of
 

2627
00:56:00,039 --> 00:56:02,349
waste of
money and so we kept asking that guy

2628
00:56:02,349 --> 00:56:02,359
money and so we kept asking that guy
 

2629
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,589
money and so we kept asking that guy
questions and we ended up overhauling

2630
00:56:04,589 --> 00:56:04,599
questions and we ended up overhauling
 

2631
00:56:04,599 --> 00:56:07,230
questions and we ended up overhauling
the design pretty well into the process

2632
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:07,240
the design pretty well into the process
 

2633
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,750
the design pretty well into the process
of the whole system saving a lot of

2634
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:08,760
of the whole system saving a lot of
 

2635
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:11,150
of the whole system saving a lot of
money creating a great system that's

2636
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:11,160
money creating a great system that's
 

2637
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:14,430
money creating a great system that's
super functional and um so I learned a

2638
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:14,440
super functional and um so I learned a
 

2639
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,910
super functional and um so I learned a
lot and that's just one example of

2640
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:15,920
lot and that's just one example of
 

2641
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,150
lot and that's just one example of
countless that one really sticks out of

2642
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:18,160
countless that one really sticks out of
 

2643
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,430

00:56:35,799 --> 00:56:39,549
thoughts were ideas Concepts
designs and um there was almost like a

2658
00:56:39,549 --> 00:56:39,559
designs and um there was almost like a
 

2659
00:56:39,559 --> 00:56:41,630
designs and um there was almost like a
Socratic sort

2660
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:41,640
Socratic sort
 

2661
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:45,510
Socratic sort
of first principles type of way he he

2662
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:45,520
of first principles type of way he he
 

2663
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,670
of first principles type of way he he
questioned people trying to get down to

2664
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:47,680
questioned people trying to get down to
 

2665
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,470
questioned people trying to get down to
sort of trying to reduce complex things

2666
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:50,480
sort of trying to reduce complex things
 

2667
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:54,270
sort of trying to reduce complex things
to something really fundamental and and

2668
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:54,280
to something really fundamental and and
 

2669
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,990
to something really fundamental and and
and simple so I I I try to do that

2670
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:57,000
and simple so I I I try to do that
 

2671
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,150
and simple so I I I try to do that
myself to the to the best I can and I

2672
00:56:59,150 --> 00:56:59,160
myself to the to the best I can and I
 

2673
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,829
myself to the to the best I can and I
think it's something I very much learned

2674
00:57:00,829 --> 00:57:00,839
think it's something I very much learned
 

2675
00:57:00,839 --> 00:57:03,230
think it's something I very much learned
from him yeah I've seen great Engineers

2676
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:03,240
from him yeah I've seen great Engineers
 

2677
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,710
from him yeah I've seen great Engineers
great leaders do just that you see you

2678
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:05,720
great leaders do just that you see you
 

2679
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:10,349
great leaders do just that you see you
on do that a lot which is basically ask

2680
00:57:10,349 --> 00:57:10,359
on do that a lot which is basically ask
 

2681
00:57:10,359 --> 00:57:13,309
on do that a lot which is basically ask
questions uh to push simplification can

2682
00:57:13,309 --> 00:57:13,319
questions uh to push simplification can
 

2683
00:57:13,319 --> 00:57:15,589
questions uh to push simplification can
we do this simpler and like why the

2684
00:57:15,589 --> 00:57:15,599
we do this simpler and like why the
 

2685
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:17,510
we do this simpler and like why the
basic question is like why are we doing

2686
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:17,520
basic question is like why are we doing
 

2687
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,630
basic question is like why are we doing
it this way can this be done simpler

2688
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:19,640
it this way can this be done simpler
 

2689
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:23,349
it this way can this be done simpler
yeah and not taking as an answer that

2690
00:57:23,349 --> 00:57:23,359
yeah and not taking as an answer that
 

2691
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:26,630
yeah and not taking as an answer that
this is how we've always done it sort of

2692
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:26,640
this is how we've always done it sort of
 

2693
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,870
this is how we've always done it sort of
not not allowing yourself like it

2694
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:28,880
not not allowing yourself like it
 

2695
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,430
not not allowing yourself like it
doesn't matter that's how we always done

2696
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:30,440
doesn't matter that's how we always done
 

2697
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,390
doesn't matter that's how we always done
it what is the right way to do it and

2698
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:32,400
it what is the right way to do it and
 

2699
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,150
it what is the right way to do it and
what is and usually the simpler it is

2700
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:35,160
what is and usually the simpler it is
 

2701
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,630
what is and usually the simpler it is
the more correct the way yeah has to do

2702
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:37,640
the more correct the way yeah has to do
 

2703
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:40,470
the more correct the way yeah has to do
with cost has to do with Simplicity of

2704
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:40,480
with cost has to do with Simplicity of
 

2705
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,430
with cost has to do with Simplicity of
uh of production manufacturer but

2706
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:42,440
uh of production manufacturer but
 

2707
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:45,270
uh of production manufacturer but
usually simple is best and it's often

2708
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:45,280
usually simple is best and it's often
 

2709
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,349
usually simple is best and it's often
times not the architect the engineers

2710
00:57:47,349 --> 00:57:47,359
times not the architect the engineers
 

2711
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:48,990
times not the architect the engineers
it's you know in elon's case probably

2712
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:49,000
it's you know in elon's case probably
 

2713
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,069
it's you know in elon's case probably
the line worker who sees things yes more

2714
00:57:52,069 --> 00:57:52,079
the line worker who sees things yes more
 

2715
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:54,349
the line worker who sees things yes more
clearly so I think making sure it's not

2716
00:57:54,349 --> 00:57:54,359
clearly so I think making sure it's not
 

2717
00:57:54,359 --> 00:57:55,789
clearly so I think making sure it's not
just that you're asking good questions

2718
00:57:55,789 --> 00:57:55,799
just that you're asking good questions
 

2719
00:57:55,799 --> 00:57:58,190
just that you're asking good questions
you're asking the right people those

2720
00:57:58,190 --> 00:57:58,200
you're asking the right people those
 

2721
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,549
you're asking the right people those
same good questions that's why like uh a

2722
00:58:00,549 --> 00:58:00,559
same good questions that's why like uh a
 

2723
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,109
same good questions that's why like uh a
lot of the Elon companies are really

2724
00:58:02,109 --> 00:58:02,119
lot of the Elon companies are really
 

2725
00:58:02,119 --> 00:58:04,470
lot of the Elon companies are really
flat in terms of uh organizational

2726
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:04,480
flat in terms of uh organizational
 

2727
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,069
flat in terms of uh organizational
design where the the any anybody on the

2728
00:58:08,069 --> 00:58:08,079
design where the the any anybody on the
 

2729
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:11,309
design where the the any anybody on the
factory floor can talk directly to Elon

2730
00:58:11,309 --> 00:58:11,319
factory floor can talk directly to Elon
 

2731
00:58:11,319 --> 00:58:13,510
factory floor can talk directly to Elon
there's no there's not there's not this

2732
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:13,520
there's no there's not there's not this
 

2733
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,069
there's no there's not there's not this
managerial class this hierarchy where to

2734
00:58:16,069 --> 00:58:16,079
managerial class this hierarchy where to
 

2735
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:18,990
managerial class this hierarchy where to
travel up and down the hierarchy which

2736
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:19,000
travel up and down the hierarchy which
 

2737
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,430
travel up and down the hierarchy which
large companies often construct this

2738
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:21,440
large companies often construct this
 

2739
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,510
large companies often construct this
hierarchy of managers where no one

2740
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:23,520
hierarchy of managers where no one
 

2741
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,470
hierarchy of managers where no one
manager if you ask them the question of

2742
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:26,480
manager if you ask them the question of
 

2743
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,950
manager if you ask them the question of
like what have you done this week the

2744
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:27,960
like what have you done this week the
 

2745
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,510
like what have you done this week the
answer is like it's really hard to come

2746
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:30,520
answer is like it's really hard to come
 

2747
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,029
answer is like it's really hard to come
up with usually it's going to be a bunch

2748
00:58:32,029 --> 00:58:32,039
up with usually it's going to be a bunch
 

2749
00:58:32,039 --> 00:58:35,150
up with usually it's going to be a bunch
of paperwork yeah uh so like nobody

2750
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:35,160
of paperwork yeah uh so like nobody
 

2751
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,510
of paperwork yeah uh so like nobody
knows what they actually do so when it's

2752
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:37,520
knows what they actually do so when it's
 

2753
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,910
knows what they actually do so when it's
flat you can actually get as quickly as

2754
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:39,920
flat you can actually get as quickly as
 

2755
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,750
flat you can actually get as quickly as
possible when problems arise you you can

2756
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:42,760
possible when problems arise you you can
 

2757
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,390
possible when problems arise you you can
you can solve those problems as quickly

2758
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:44,400
you can solve those problems as quickly
 

2759
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:48,430
you can solve those problems as quickly
as possible and also you have a direct

2760
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:48,440
as possible and also you have a direct
 

2761
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,870
as possible and also you have a direct
rapid iterative process where you're

2762
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:50,880
rapid iterative process where you're
 

2763
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,910
rapid iterative process where you're
making things simpler making them more

2764
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:52,920
making things simpler making them more
 

2765
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:56,589
making things simpler making them more
efficient and constantly improving so

2766
00:58:56,589 --> 00:58:56,599
efficient and constantly improving so
 

2767
00:58:56,599 --> 00:58:58,190
efficient and constantly improving so
yeah it's it's interesting when when

2768
00:58:58,190 --> 00:58:58,200
yeah it's it's interesting when when
 

2769
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,589
yeah it's it's interesting when when
large I me you see this in government a

2770
00:59:00,589 --> 00:59:00,599
large I me you see this in government a
 

2771
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:02,950
large I me you see this in government a
lot of people get together a hierarchy

2772
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:02,960
lot of people get together a hierarchy
 

2773
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,190
lot of people get together a hierarchy
is developed and that

2774
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:05,200
is developed and that
 

2775
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,470
is developed and that
somehow sometimes it's good but very

2776
00:59:07,470 --> 00:59:07,480
somehow sometimes it's good but very
 

2777
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,750
somehow sometimes it's good but very
often just slows things down and you see

2778
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:09,760
often just slows things down and you see
 

2779
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,109
often just slows things down and you see
great companies great great companies

2780
00:59:12,109 --> 00:59:12,119
great companies great great companies
 

2781
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:13,990

2786
00:59:20,349 --> 00:59:20,359
bureaucracy that builds the slowness
 

2787
00:59:20,359 --> 00:59:22,870
bureaucracy that builds the slowness
that large organizations have and to

2788
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:22,880
that large organizations have and to
 

2789
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,829
that large organizations have and to
still be a big organization and act like

2790
00:59:24,829 --> 00:59:24,839
still be a big organization and act like
 

2791
00:59:24,839 --> 00:59:26,829
still be a big organization and act like
a startup

2792
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:26,839
a startup
 

2793
00:59:26,839 --> 00:59:28,950
a startup
is the Big Challenge it's super

2794
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:28,960
is the Big Challenge it's super
 

2795
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,589
is the Big Challenge it's super
difficult to deconstruct that as well

2796
00:59:30,589 --> 00:59:30,599
difficult to deconstruct that as well
 

2797
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:33,430
difficult to deconstruct that as well
once it's in place right it's it's

2798
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:33,440
once it's in place right it's it's
 

2799
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,789
once it's in place right it's it's
circumventing layers and asking

2800
00:59:35,789 --> 00:59:35,799
circumventing layers and asking
 

2801
00:59:35,799 --> 00:59:38,630
circumventing layers and asking
questions probing questions of of people

2802
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:38,640
questions probing questions of of people
 

2803
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,670
questions probing questions of of people
on the ground level um is a huge

2804
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:41,680
on the ground level um is a huge
 

2805
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,029
on the ground level um is a huge
challenge to the authority of the

2806
00:59:44,029 --> 00:59:44,039
challenge to the authority of the
 

2807
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:46,750
challenge to the authority of the
hierarchy um and there's tremendous

2808
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:46,760
hierarchy um and there's tremendous
 

2809
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:49,109
hierarchy um and there's tremendous
amount of resistance to it so it's how

2810
00:59:49,109 --> 00:59:49,119
amount of resistance to it so it's how
 

2811
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,069
amount of resistance to it so it's how
do you grow something in in the case of

couldn't conceive it being sort of
exciting and aspirational and

3126

exciting and aspirational and
interesting um to sort of lean into to

to articulate but can you speak to the

3246
01:08:57,590 --> 01:08:57,600
to articulate but can you speak to the
 

3247
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:01,550
to articulate but can you speak to the
process you go through from idea to the

3248
01:09:01,550 --> 01:09:01,560
process you go through from idea to the
 

3249
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:04,510
process you go through from idea to the
final thing like what you go through to

01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:04,520
final thing like what you go through to
 

3251
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:07,669
final thing like what you go through to
bring an idea to life so not being a

3252
01:09:07,669 --> 01:09:07,679
bring an idea to life so not being a
 

3253
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:09,349
bring an idea to life so not being a
designer and this is true in real estate

3254
01:09:09,349 --> 01:09:09,359
designer and this is true in real estate
 

3255
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:10,950
designer and this is true in real estate
as well I was never the architect so I

3256
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:10,960
as well I was never the architect so I
 

3257
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,950
as well I was never the architect so I
didn't necessarily have the pen and in

3258
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:12,960
didn't necessarily have the pen and in
 

3259
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:15,590
didn't necessarily have the pen and in
in fashion the same I was kind of like a

3260
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:15,600
in fashion the same I was kind of like a
 

3261
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,430
in fashion the same I was kind of like a
conductor I was I knew what I liked and

3262
01:09:18,430 --> 01:09:18,440
conductor I was I knew what I liked and
 

3263
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:20,149
conductor I was I knew what I liked and
didn't like and I think that's really

3264
01:09:20,149 --> 01:09:20,159
didn't like and I think that's really
 

3265
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:22,550
didn't like and I think that's really
important and that became honed for me

3266
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:22,560
important and that became honed for me
 

3267
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:25,669
important and that became honed for me
over time so I would have to sit a lot

3268
01:09:25,669 --> 01:09:25,679
over time so I would have to sit a lot
 

3269
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:29,149
over time so I would have to sit a lot
longer with something earlier on than

3270
01:09:29,149 --> 01:09:29,159
longer with something earlier on than
 

3271
01:09:29,159 --> 01:09:32,470
longer with something earlier on than
later when I had more refined my

3272
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:32,480
later when I had more refined my
 

3273
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:36,349
later when I had more refined my
aesthetic point of view and so I think

3274
01:09:36,349 --> 01:09:36,359
aesthetic point of view and so I think
 

3275
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:38,189
aesthetic point of view and so I think
first of all you have to have a pretty

3276
01:09:38,189 --> 01:09:38,199
first of all you have to have a pretty
 

3277
01:09:38,199 --> 01:09:41,269
first of all you have to have a pretty
strong sense of um of what resonates

3278
01:09:41,269 --> 01:09:41,279
strong sense of um of what resonates
 

3279
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:44,390
strong sense of um of what resonates
with you and and then as in the case of

3280
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:44,400
with you and and then as in the case of
 

3281
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:47,309
with you and and then as in the case of
of my fashion business as it grew and

3282
01:09:47,309 --> 01:09:47,319
of my fashion business as it grew and
 

3283
01:09:47,319 --> 01:09:49,669
of my fashion business as it grew and
became um quite a large business and I

3284
01:09:49,669 --> 01:09:49,679
became um quite a large business and I
 

3285
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:50,950
became um quite a large business and I
had so many different categories

3286
01:09:50,950 --> 01:09:50,960
had so many different categories
 

3287
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,349
had so many different categories
everything had to work together so I had

3288
01:09:52,349 --> 01:09:52,359
everything had to work together so I had
 

3289
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:54,709
everything had to work together so I had
individual partners for each category

3290
01:09:54,709 --> 01:09:54,719
individual partners for each category
 

3291
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:56,669
individual partners for each category
but if we were selling at nean Marcus we

3292
01:09:56,669 --> 01:09:56,679
but if we were selling at nean Marcus we
 

3293
01:09:56,679 --> 01:09:58,669
but if we were selling at nean Marcus we
couldn't have a pair of shoes that

3294
01:09:58,669 --> 01:09:58,679
couldn't have a pair of shoes that
 

3295
01:09:58,679 --> 01:10:01,189
couldn't have a pair of shoes that
didn't relate to a dress that didn't

3296
01:10:01,189 --> 01:10:01,199
didn't relate to a dress that didn't
 

3297
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:03,390
didn't relate to a dress that didn't
relate to a pair of sunglasses and hand

3298
01:10:03,390 --> 01:10:03,400
relate to a pair of sunglasses and hand
 

3299
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,669
relate to a pair of sunglasses and hand
bags all on the same floor so you know

01:10:05,669 --> 01:10:05,679
bags all on the same floor so you know
 

3301
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:08,110
bags all on the same floor so you know
in the beginning it was much more

3302
01:10:08,110 --> 01:10:08,120
in the beginning it was much more
 

3303
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:11,470
in the beginning it was much more
collaborative um as time passed I I

3304
01:10:11,470 --> 01:10:11,480
collaborative um as time passed I I
 

3305
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:13,310
collaborative um as time passed I I
really sort of took the point on

3306
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:13,320
really sort of took the point on
 

3307
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:15,550
really sort of took the point on
deciding and this is the aesthetic for

3308
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:15,560
deciding and this is the aesthetic for
 

3309
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:17,229
deciding and this is the aesthetic for
the season these are the colors we're

going to use these are fabrics and then

3312
01:10:19,630 --> 01:10:19,640
going to use these are fabrics and then
 

3313
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,510
going to use these are fabrics and then
working with our partners on the

3314
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:21,520
working with our partners on the
 

3315
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,910
working with our partners on the
execution of that but I I needed to

3316
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:23,920
execution of that but I I needed to
 

3317
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,550
execution of that but I I needed to
create an overlay that allowed for

3318
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:26,560
create an overlay that allowed for
 

3319
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:29,910
create an overlay that allowed for
cohesion as the collection grew and and

3320
01:10:29,910 --> 01:10:29,920
cohesion as the collection grew and and
 

3321
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,630
cohesion as the collection grew and and
that was actually really fun for me

3322
01:10:31,630 --> 01:10:31,640
that was actually really fun for me
 

3323
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:33,110
that was actually really fun for me
because I was a little different you

3324
01:10:33,110 --> 01:10:33,120
because I was a little different you
 

3325
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,149
because I was a little different you
know I was typically initially

3326
01:10:35,149 --> 01:10:35,159
know I was typically initially
 

3327
01:10:35,159 --> 01:10:37,229
know I was typically initially
responding to things that were put in

3328
01:10:37,229 --> 01:10:37,239
responding to things that were put in
 

3329
01:10:37,239 --> 01:10:40,950
responding to things that were put in
front of me and towards the end I was it

front of me and towards the end I was it
 

3331
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:43,310
front of me and towards the end I was it
was my partners who were responding to

3332
01:10:43,310 --> 01:10:43,320
was my partners who were responding to

and so I had
 

3345
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:03,310
and so I had
this you know almost like that conductor

3346
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:03,320
this you know almost like that conductor
 

3347
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:05,390
this you know almost like that conductor
analogy I had this incredible group of

3348
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:05,400
analogy I had this incredible group of
 

3349
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:08,510
analogy I had this incredible group of
in this case women assembled who who had

3350
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:08,520
in this case women assembled who who had
 

3351
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:11,910
in this case women assembled who who had
very strong points of view um themselves

3352
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:11,920
very strong points of view um themselves
 

3353
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:15,470
very strong points of view um themselves

thing behind any successful story but

3360
01:11:22,830 --> 01:11:22,840
thing behind any successful story but
 

3361
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:24,950
thing behind any successful story but
there's this thing of taste which is

3362
01:11:24,950 --> 01:11:24,960
there's this thing of taste which is
 

3363
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,590
there's this thing of taste which is
really interesting cuz it's hard to kind

3364
01:11:26,590 --> 01:11:26,600
really interesting cuz it's hard to kind
 

3365
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:29,229
really interesting cuz it's hard to kind
of articulate what it takes but

3366
01:11:29,229 --> 01:11:29,239
of articulate what it takes but
 

3367
01:11:29,239 --> 01:11:32,030
of articulate what it takes but
basically knowing a versus B what looks

3368
01:11:32,030 --> 01:11:32,040
basically knowing a versus B what looks
 

3369
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:36,350
basically knowing a versus B what looks
good or without AB comparison to say

3370
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:36,360
good or without AB comparison to say
 

3371
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:39,709
good or without AB comparison to say
like if we did if we change this

3372
01:11:39,709 --> 01:11:39,719
like if we did if we change this
 

3373
01:11:39,719 --> 01:11:43,229
like if we did if we change this
part that would make it better that sort

3374
01:11:43,229 --> 01:11:43,239
part that would make it better that sort
 

3375
01:11:43,239 --> 01:11:45,790
part that would make it better that sort
of designer taste it's hard

3376
01:11:45,790 --> 01:11:45,800
of designer taste it's hard
 

3377
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:48,990
of designer taste it's hard
to make explicit what that is but the

3378
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:49,000
to make explicit what that is but the
 

3379
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,550
to make explicit what that is but the
great designers like have that taste

3380
01:11:51,550 --> 01:11:51,560
great designers like have that taste
 

3381

01:11:59,229 --> 01:11:59,239
is not the opinion like you can't uh
 

3387
01:11:59,239 --> 01:12:00,950
is not the opinion like you can't uh
pull people and ask them what looks

3388
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:00,960
pull people and ask them what looks
 

3389
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,750
pull people and ask them what looks
better it's you you have to have the

3390
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:02,760
better it's you you have to have the
 

3391
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:05,110
better it's you you have to have the
vision of that yeah and as you said you

3392
01:12:05,110 --> 01:12:05,120
vision of that yeah and as you said you
 

3393
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,910
vision of that yeah and as you said you
also have to develop eventually the

3394
01:12:07,910 --> 01:12:07,920
also have to develop eventually the
 

3395
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,830
also have to develop eventually the
confidence that your taste is is good

3396
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:10,840
confidence that your taste is is good
 

3397
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:13,310
confidence that your taste is is good
such that you can like curate you can

3398
01:12:13,310 --> 01:12:13,320
such that you can like curate you can
 

3399
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:16,629
such that you can like curate you can
direct teams you can argue that no no no

3400
01:12:16,629 --> 01:12:16,639
direct teams you can argue that no no no
 

3401
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:18,229
direct teams you can argue that no no no
this is right even when there's several

3402
01:12:18,229 --> 01:12:18,239
this is right even when there's several
 

3403
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:19,870
this is right even when there's several
people that say this doesn't make any

3404
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:19,880
people that say this doesn't make any
 

3405
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:22,310
people that say this doesn't make any
sense if you have that Vision have the

3406
01:12:22,310 --> 01:12:22,320
sense if you have that Vision have the
 

3407
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,790
sense if you have that Vision have the
confidence this will look good that's

3408
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:24,800
confidence this will look good that's
 

3409
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,950
confidence this will look good that's
how you come up with great designs it's

3410
01:12:26,950 --> 01:12:26,960
how you come up with great designs it's
 

3411
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,189
how you come up with great designs it's
it's a mix mixture of great taste as you

3412
01:12:29,189 --> 01:12:29,199
it's a mix mixture of great taste as you
 

3413
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:31,030
it's a mix mixture of great taste as you
develop over time and the

3414
01:12:31,030 --> 01:12:31,040
develop over time and the
 

3415
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:33,550
develop over time and the
confidence and and that's a really hard

3416
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:33,560
confidence and and that's a really hard
 

3417
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:35,950
confidence and and that's a really hard
thing especially and I think one of the

01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:53,750
and we're building bringing in the best
Architects and the Best Brands and but

3432
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:53,760
Architects and the Best Brands and but
 

3433
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,830
Architects and the Best Brands and but
to have a point of view

3434
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:55,840
to have a point of view
 

3435
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:58,550
to have a point of view
and to challenge people who are such

3436
01:12:58,550 --> 01:12:58,560
and to challenge people who are such
 

3437
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:01,390
and to challenge people who are such
artists respectfully um but not to be

3438
01:13:01,390 --> 01:13:01,400
artists respectfully um but not to be
 

3439
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,430
artists respectfully um but not to be
afraid to to ask questions it takes a

3440
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:03,440
afraid to to ask questions it takes a
 

3441
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:06,430
afraid to to ask questions it takes a
lot of confidence to do that um and and

3442
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:06,440
lot of confidence to do that um and and
 

3443
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:08,510
lot of confidence to do that um and and
it's hard so these are actually just

3444
01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:08,520
it's hard so these are actually just
 

3445
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:11,750
it's hard so these are actually just
internal early renderings so we're in

3446
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:11,760
internal early renderings so we're in
 

3447
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,430
internal early renderings so we're in
the process of doing the master planning

3448
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:13,440
the process of doing the master planning
 

3449
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:16,669
the process of doing the master planning
now but this is beautiful I mean it's

3450
01:13:16,669 --> 01:13:16,679
now but this is beautiful I mean it's
 

3451
01:13:16,679 --> 01:13:18,950
now but this is beautiful I mean it's
early Vision yeah it's going to be

3452
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:18,960
early Vision yeah it's going to be
 

3453
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,629
early Vision yeah it's going to be
extraordinary Aman's going to operate

3454
01:13:21,629 --> 01:13:21,639
extraordinary Aman's going to operate
 

3455
01:13:21,639 --> 01:13:23,229
extraordinary Aman's going to operate
the hotel for us and there are going to

3456
01:13:23,229 --> 01:13:23,239
the hotel for us and there are going to
 

3457
01:13:23,239 --> 01:13:26,470
the hotel for us and there are going to
be Villas and uh we we have Carbone

3458
01:13:26,470 --> 01:13:26,480
be Villas and uh we we have Carbone
 

3459

3467
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:36,590
for me to be able to play around and
flex the the real estate muscles again

3468
01:13:36,590 --> 01:13:36,600
flex the the real estate muscles again
 

3469
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,350
flex the the real estate muscles again
and and have some fun with it is real

3470
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:38,360
and and have some fun with it is real
 

3471
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:40,510
and and have some fun with it is real
estate the design the the art how hard

3472
01:13:40,510 --> 01:13:40,520
estate the design the the art how hard
 

3473
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:41,990
estate the design the the art how hard
is it to bring something like that to

3474
01:13:41,990 --> 01:13:42,000
is it to bring something like that to
 

3475
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,790
is it to bring something like that to
life CU that's like that looks surreal

3476
01:13:44,790 --> 01:13:44,800
life CU that's like that looks surreal
 

3477
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,390
life CU that's like that looks surreal
out of this

3478
01:13:46,390 --> 01:13:46,400
out of this
 

3479
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:50,110
out of this
world well especially on an island it's

3480
01:13:50,110 --> 01:13:50,120
world well especially on an island it's
 

3481
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:51,750
world well especially on an island it's
it's challenging meaning the logistics

3482
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:51,760
it's challenging meaning the logistics
 

3483
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,390
it's challenging meaning the logistics
and even getting the building materials

3484
01:13:53,390 --> 01:13:53,400
and even getting the building materials
 

3485
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:57,590
and even getting the building materials
to an island or no joke but um but we

3486
01:13:57,590 --> 01:13:57,600
to an island or no joke but um but we
 

3487
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,149
to an island or no joke but um but we
will execute on it so and it it may not

3488
01:14:00,149 --> 01:14:00,159
will execute on it so and it it may not
 

3489
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:02,750
will execute on it so and it it may not
be this this is sort of as I said early

3490
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:02,760
be this this is sort of as I said early
 

3491
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:05,070
be this this is sort of as I said early
conceptual drawings but it gives a sense

3492
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:05,080
conceptual drawings but it gives a sense
 

3493
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:06,910
conceptual drawings but it gives a sense
of sort of wanting to honor the

3494
01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:06,920
of sort of wanting to honor the
 

3495
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:09,750
of sort of wanting to honor the
topography that exists and um you know

3496
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:09,760
topography that exists and um you know
 

3497
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:12,189
topography that exists and um you know
this is obviously very modern but um

3498
01:14:12,189 --> 01:14:12,199
this is obviously very modern but um
 

3499
01:14:12,199 --> 01:14:13,790
this is obviously very modern but um
making it feel right in terms of the

3500
01:14:13,790 --> 01:14:13,800
making it feel right in terms of the
 

3501
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:18,229
making it feel right in terms of the
context of um of the vegetation and uh

3502
01:14:18,229 --> 01:14:18,239
context of um of the vegetation and uh
 

3503
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:21,470
context of um of the vegetation and uh
and the trrain that exists is and not

3504
01:14:21,470 --> 01:14:21,480
and the trrain that exists is and not
 

3505
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:24,709
and the trrain that exists is and not
just have you know a beautiful glass box

3506
01:14:24,709 --> 01:14:24,719
just have you know a beautiful glass box
 

3507
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:26,229
just have you know a beautiful glass box
obvious you want glass you want to look

3508
01:14:26,229 --> 01:14:26,239
obvious you want glass you want to look
 

3509
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:30,950
obvious you want glass you want to look
out and see that gorgeous blue ocean but

3510
01:14:30,950 --> 01:14:30,960
out and see that gorgeous blue ocean but
 

3511
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,790
out and see that gorgeous blue ocean but
um but how do you do that in a way that

3512
01:14:32,790 --> 01:14:32,800
um but how do you do that in a way that
 

3513
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,550
um but how do you do that in a way that
doesn't feel generic and isn't a

3514
01:14:35,550 --> 01:14:35,560
doesn't feel generic and isn't a
 

3515
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:37,669
doesn't feel generic and isn't a
squandered opportunity to create

3516
01:14:37,669 --> 01:14:37,679
squandered opportunity to create
 

3517
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:39,550
squandered opportunity to create
something new yeah and it's integrated

3518
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:39,560
something new yeah and it's integrated
 

3519
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,470
something new yeah and it's integrated
with a natural landscape it's it's a

3520
01:14:41,470 --> 01:14:41,480
with a natural landscape it's it's a
 

3521
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:43,070
with a natural landscape it's it's a
celebration of the natural landscape

3522
01:14:43,070 --> 01:14:43,080
celebration of the natural landscape
 

3523
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:44,870
celebration of the natural landscape
around it so I guess you start from this

3524
01:14:44,870 --> 01:14:44,880
around it so I guess you start from this
 

3525
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,550
around it so I guess you start from this
dream like because this feels like a

3526
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:46,560
dream like because this feels like a
 

3527
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,629
dream like because this feels like a
dream and then when you're faced with

3528
01:14:48,629 --> 01:14:48,639
dream and then when you're faced with
 

3529
01:14:48,639 --> 01:14:50,070
dream and then when you're faced with
the reality of the building materials

3530
01:14:50,070 --> 01:14:50,080
the reality of the building materials
 

3531
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,470
the reality of the building materials
and all the actual constraints of the

3532
01:14:51,470 --> 01:14:51,480
and all the actual constraints of the
 

3533
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,430
and all the actual constraints of the
building that it evolves from there

3534
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:53,440
building that it evolves from there
 

3535
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:56,390
building that it evolves from there
right yeah and so much I mean so much of

3536
01:14:56,390 --> 01:14:56,400
right yeah and so much I mean so much of
 

3537
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:59,189
right yeah and so much I mean so much of
architecture you don't see um but it's

3538
01:14:59,189 --> 01:14:59,199
architecture you don't see um but it's
 

3539
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:01,669
architecture you don't see um but it's
decisions made so how do

3540
01:15:01,669 --> 01:15:01,679
decisions made so how do
 

3541
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:04,110
decisions made so how do
you how do you create independent

3542
01:15:04,110 --> 01:15:04,120
you how do you create independent
 

3543
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:05,990
you how do you create independent
structures where you look out of one and

3544
01:15:05,990 --> 01:15:06,000
structures where you look out of one and
 

3545
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,669
structures where you look out of one and
don't see the other you know how do you

3546
01:15:08,669 --> 01:15:08,679
don't see the other you know how do you
 

3547
01:15:08,679 --> 01:15:12,270
don't see the other you know how do you
ensure the sort of the stacking um and

3548
01:15:12,270 --> 01:15:12,280
ensure the sort of the stacking um and
 

3549
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:13,990
ensure the sort of the stacking um and
the master plan works in a way that's

3550
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:14,000
the master plan works in a way that's
 

3551
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,629
the master plan works in a way that's
harmonious and view corridors and all of

3552
01:15:17,629 --> 01:15:17,639
harmonious and view corridors and all of
 

3553
01:15:17,639 --> 01:15:19,870
harmonious and view corridors and all of
those elements all of those components

3554
01:15:19,870 --> 01:15:19,880
those elements all of those components
 

3555
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:23,870
those elements all of those components
of decision making are super appreciated

3556
01:15:23,870 --> 01:15:23,880
of decision making are super appreciated
 

3557
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:25,390
of decision making are super appreciated
but not often thought about what's a

3558
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:25,400
but not often thought about what's a
 

3559
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,270
but not often thought about what's a
view corridor like to make sure that the

3560
01:15:28,270 --> 01:15:28,280
view corridor like to make sure that the
 

3561
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:30,750
view corridor like to make sure that the
top unit you're not looking out and

3562
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:30,760
top unit you're not looking out and
 

3563
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:32,390
top unit you're not looking out and
seeing a whole bunch of units you're

3564
01:15:32,390 --> 01:15:32,400
seeing a whole bunch of units you're
 

3565
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,149
seeing a whole bunch of units you're
looking out and seeing the ocean so

3566
01:15:34,149 --> 01:15:34,159
looking out and seeing the ocean so
 

3567
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:35,629
looking out and seeing the ocean so
that's where you take this and then you

3568
01:15:35,629 --> 01:15:35,639
that's where you take this and then you
 

3569
01:15:35,639 --> 01:15:37,430
that's where you take this and then you
start angling everything and you start

3570
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:37,440
start angling everything and you start
 

3571
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,910
start angling everything and you start
thinking about well in this context do

3572
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:39,920
thinking about well in this context do
 

3573
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:41,510
thinking about well in this context do
we have green roofs so if there's any

3574
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:41,520
we have green roofs so if there's any
 

3575
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,990
we have green roofs so if there's any
hint of a roof it's camouflaged by

3576
01:15:43,990 --> 01:15:44,000
hint of a roof it's camouflaged by
 

3577
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,229
hint of a roof it's camouflaged by
vegetation that matches what already

3578
01:15:46,229 --> 01:15:46,239
vegetation that matches what already
 

3579
01:15:46,239 --> 01:15:48,270
vegetation that matches what already
exists on the island where the engineers

3580
01:15:48,270 --> 01:15:48,280
exists on the island where the engineers
 

3581
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:50,310
exists on the island where the engineers
become very important well yeah so how

3582
01:15:50,310 --> 01:15:50,320
become very important well yeah so how
 

3583
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,910
become very important well yeah so how
do you build into a mountain side um

3584
01:15:52,910 --> 01:15:52,920
do you build into a mountain side um
 

3585
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:55,830
do you build into a mountain side um
while being sensitive to to Beauty and

3586
01:15:55,830 --> 01:15:55,840
while being sensitive to to Beauty and
 

3587
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,350
while being sensitive to to Beauty and
of the island it's almost like a

3588
01:15:57,350 --> 01:15:57,360
of the island it's almost like a
 

3589
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,709
of the island it's almost like a
mathematical problem I took a class

3590
01:15:59,709 --> 01:15:59,719
mathematical problem I took a class
 

3591
01:15:59,719 --> 01:16:02,189
mathematical problem I took a class
computational geometry in grad school

3592
01:16:02,189 --> 01:16:02,199
computational geometry in grad school
 

3593
01:16:02,199 --> 01:16:04,510
computational geometry in grad school
where you have to think about these view

3594
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:04,520
where you have to think about these view
 

3595
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:06,870
where you have to think about these view
corridors it's like a math problem yeah

3596
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:06,880
corridors it's like a math problem yeah
 

3597
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,390
corridors it's like a math problem yeah
well but it's also an art problem

3598
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:08,400
well but it's also an art problem
 

3599
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,350
well but it's also an art problem
because it's not just about making sure

3600
01:16:10,350 --> 01:16:10,360
because it's not just about making sure
 

3601
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:12,950
because it's not just about making sure
that there's no occlusions to the view

3602
01:16:12,950 --> 01:16:12,960
that there's no occlusions to the view
 

3603
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:15,189
that there's no occlusions to the view
you have to figure out when there is

3604
01:16:15,189 --> 01:16:15,199
you have to figure out when there is
 

3605
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:17,590
you have to figure out when there is
occlusions like what is a vegetation is

3606
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:17,600
occlusions like what is a vegetation is
 

3607
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,390
occlusions like what is a vegetation is
it you have to figure all that out and

3608
01:16:19,390 --> 01:16:19,400
it you have to figure all that out and
 

3609
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:21,590
it you have to figure all that out and
there's probably so every single every

3610
01:16:21,590 --> 01:16:21,600
there's probably so every single every
 

3611
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,910
there's probably so every single every
single room every single building is a

3612
01:16:23,910 --> 01:16:23,920
single room every single building is a
 

3613
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:26,990
single room every single building is a
is a thing that has extra complexity and

3614
01:16:26,990 --> 01:16:27,000
is a thing that has extra complexity and
 

3615
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,390
is a thing that has extra complexity and
then the choic is like how does the

3616
01:16:29,390 --> 01:16:29,400
then the choic is like how does the
 

3617
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:32,390
then the choic is like how does the
sunrise and set yeah so how do you want

3618
01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:32,400
sunrise and set yeah so how do you want
 

3619
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:35,510
sunrise and set yeah so how do you want
to angle the hotel in relation awesome

3620
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:35,520
to angle the hotel in relation awesome
 

3621
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,790
to angle the hotel in relation awesome
to the sunrise and the sunset you you

3622
01:16:37,790 --> 01:16:37,800
to the sunrise and the sunset you you
 

3623
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:39,470
to the sunrise and the sunset you you
obviously want people to experience

3624
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:39,480
obviously want people to experience
 

3625
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:44,470
obviously want people to experience
those um so which do you favor uh the

3626
01:16:44,470 --> 01:16:44,480
those um so which do you favor uh the
 

3627
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:47,390
those um so which do you favor uh the
directionality of the wind and on on an

3628
01:16:47,390 --> 01:16:47,400
directionality of the wind and on on an
 

3629
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:49,110
directionality of the wind and on on an
island and you know in this case the

3630
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:49,120
island and you know in this case the
 

3631
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,070
island and you know in this case the
winds coming from the North and the

3632
01:16:51,070 --> 01:16:51,080
winds coming from the North and the
 

3633
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:53,990
winds coming from the North and the
vegetation is less Lush on the Northern

3634
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:54,000
vegetation is less Lush on the Northern
 

3635
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,750
vegetation is less Lush on the Northern
end so do you focus more on the sou

3636
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:55,760
end so do you focus more on the sou
 

3637
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:58,030
end so do you focus more on the sou
southern end and have you know the

3638
01:16:58,030 --> 01:16:58,040
southern end and have you know the
 

3639
01:16:58,040 --> 01:16:59,950
southern end and have you know the
horseback riding trails and amenities up

3640
01:16:59,950 --> 01:16:59,960
horseback riding trails and amenities up
 

3641
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:02,870
horseback riding trails and amenities up
towards the the north so there are these

3642
01:17:02,870 --> 01:17:02,880
towards the the north so there are these
 

3643
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,990
towards the the north so there are these
really interesting decisions and and

3644
01:17:04,990 --> 01:17:05,000
really interesting decisions and and
 

3645
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,790
really interesting decisions and and
choices you get to reflect on that's a

3646
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:07,800
choices you get to reflect on that's a
 

3647
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,110
choices you get to reflect on that's a
fascinating sort of discussion to be

3648
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:09,120
fascinating sort of discussion to be
 

3649
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,070
fascinating sort of discussion to be
having and probably there's like actual

3650
01:17:11,070 --> 01:17:11,080
having and probably there's like actual
 

3651
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:13,430
having and probably there's like actual
constraints and like infrastructure

3652
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:13,440
constraints and like infrastructure
 

3653
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,669
constraints and like infrastructure
issues so all those the grade of the

3654
01:17:15,669 --> 01:17:15,679
issues so all those the grade of the
 

3655
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:18,550
issues so all those the grade of the
land right if it's super steep so also

3656
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:18,560
land right if it's super steep so also
 

3657
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:20,550
land right if it's super steep so also
finding the areas of topography that are

3658
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:20,560
finding the areas of topography that are
 

3659
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,870
finding the areas of topography that are
flatter but still have the great views

3660
01:17:22,870 --> 01:17:22,880
flatter but still have the great views
 

3661
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,030
flatter but still have the great views
so it's it's fun it's I think real

3662
01:17:25,030 --> 01:17:25,040
so it's it's fun it's I think real
 

3663
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,430
so it's it's fun it's I think real
estate and building it's like a giant

3664
01:17:26,430 --> 01:17:26,440
estate and building it's like a giant
 

3665
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:29,629
estate and building it's like a giant
puzzle and I love puzzles every piece

3666
01:17:29,629 --> 01:17:29,639
puzzle and I love puzzles every piece
 

3667
01:17:29,639 --> 01:17:32,229
puzzle and I love puzzles every piece
relates to another and it's all sort of

3668
01:17:32,229 --> 01:17:32,239
relates to another and it's all sort of
 

3669
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:33,910
relates to another and it's all sort of
interconnected yeah like you said in the

3670
01:17:33,910 --> 01:17:33,920
interconnected yeah like you said in the
 

3671
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:35,870
interconnected yeah like you said in the
Old Post Office like the every single

3672
01:17:35,870 --> 01:17:35,880
Old Post Office like the every single
 

3673
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:37,270
Old Post Office like the every single
room is different so every single room

3674
01:17:37,270 --> 01:17:37,280
room is different so every single room
 

3675
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,390
room is different so every single room
is a puzzle when you're doing the

3676
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:38,400
is a puzzle when you're doing the
 

3677
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,629
is a puzzle when you're doing the
renovation

3678
01:17:40,629 --> 01:17:40,639
renovation
 

3679
01:17:40,639 --> 01:17:42,950
renovation
yeah that's fascinating and if you're

3680
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:42,960
yeah that's fascinating and if you're
 

3681
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:46,110
yeah that's fascinating and if you're
not thoughtful it gets like at best

3682
01:17:46,110 --> 01:17:46,120
not thoughtful it gets like at best
 

3683
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,270
not thoughtful it gets like at best
really

3684
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:47,280
really
 

3685
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:50,430
really
quirky at worst completely ridiculous

3686
01:17:50,430 --> 01:17:50,440
quirky at worst completely ridiculous
 

3687
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:53,149
quirky at worst completely ridiculous
Quirk is such a funny word it's such a

3688
01:17:53,149 --> 01:17:53,159
Quirk is such a funny word it's such a
 

3689
01:17:53,159 --> 01:17:54,629
Quirk is such a funny word it's such a
like youve walked into I'm sure you've

3690
01:17:54,629 --> 01:17:54,639
like youve walked into I'm sure you've
 

3691
01:17:54,639 --> 01:17:56,270
like youve walked into I'm sure you've
wed walked into your fair share of like

3692
01:17:56,270 --> 01:17:56,280
wed walked into your fair share of like
 

3693
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:58,430
wed walked into your fair share of like
quirky rooms you know and sometimes like

3694
01:17:58,430 --> 01:17:58,440
quirky rooms you know and sometimes like
 

3695
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:02,229
quirky rooms you know and sometimes like
that's Charming but most often it's

3696
01:18:02,229 --> 01:18:02,239
that's Charming but most often it's
 

3697
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:04,350
that's Charming but most often it's
Charming when it's intentional yeah

3698
01:18:04,350 --> 01:18:04,360
Charming when it's intentional yeah
 

3699
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:06,110
Charming when it's intentional yeah
through like smart design yeah you can

3700
01:18:06,110 --> 01:18:06,120
through like smart design yeah you can
 

3701
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:08,149
through like smart design yeah you can
tell if it's by accident or if it's

3702
01:18:08,149 --> 01:18:08,159
tell if it's by accident or if it's
 

3703
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:10,790
tell if it's by accident or if it's
intentional you could you could tell so

3704
01:18:10,790 --> 01:18:10,800
intentional you could you could tell so
 

3705
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,709
intentional you could you could tell so
much I mean the whole Hospitality thing

3706
01:18:12,709 --> 01:18:12,719
much I mean the whole Hospitality thing
 

3707
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:14,470
much I mean the whole Hospitality thing
it's not just like how it's designed

3708
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:14,480
it's not just like how it's designed
 

3709
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:17,110
it's not just like how it's designed
it's how once the thing is operating if

3710
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:17,120
it's how once the thing is operating if
 

3711
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:19,629
it's how once the thing is operating if
it's a hotel like how everything comes

3712
01:18:19,629 --> 01:18:19,639
it's a hotel like how everything comes
 

3713
01:18:19,639 --> 01:18:21,669
it's a hotel like how everything comes
together yeah the the culture of the

3714
01:18:21,669 --> 01:18:21,679
together yeah the the culture of the
 

3715
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:24,350
together yeah the the culture of the
place and the warmth yeah like I think

3716
01:18:24,350 --> 01:18:24,360
place and the warmth yeah like I think
 

3717
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:26,430
place and the warmth yeah like I think
with spaces

3718
01:18:26,430 --> 01:18:26,440
with spaces
 

3719
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:29,270
with spaces
they you can feel like the so of a

3720
01:18:29,270 --> 01:18:29,280
they you can feel like the so of a
 

3721
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:32,550
they you can feel like the so of a
structure and I think on the hotel side

3722
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:32,560
structure and I think on the hotel side
 

3723
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:33,990
structure and I think on the hotel side
you have to think about like flow of

3724
01:18:33,990 --> 01:18:34,000
you have to think about like flow of
 

3725
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,470
you have to think about like flow of
traffic use all these things when you're

3726
01:18:36,470 --> 01:18:36,480
traffic use all these things when you're
 

3727
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,830
traffic use all these things when you're
building condominiums or or your own

3728
01:18:38,830 --> 01:18:38,840
building condominiums or or your own
 

3729
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,110
building condominiums or or your own
home you want to think about like the

3730
01:18:40,110 --> 01:18:40,120
home you want to think about like the
 

3731
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:43,110
home you want to think about like the
warmth of a space as well and especially

3732
01:18:43,110 --> 01:18:43,120
warmth of a space as well and especially
 

3733
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:45,350
warmth of a space as well and especially
with super modern design sometimes like

3734
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:45,360
with super modern design sometimes like
 

3735
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,790
with super modern design sometimes like
warmth is sacrificed and I think there

3736
01:18:47,790 --> 01:18:47,800
warmth is sacrificed and I think there
 

3737
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:50,790
warmth is sacrificed and I think there
is a way to sort of marry both and and

3738
01:18:50,790 --> 01:18:50,800

Interior Design Elements and disciplines
 

3743
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,310
Interior Design Elements and disciplines
and how

think often times interior design is

3756
01:19:18,270 --> 01:19:18,280
think often times interior design is
 

3757
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:21,750
think often times interior design is
not it doesn't take the same priority

not it doesn't take the same priority
 

3759
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,189
not it doesn't take the same priority
and I think the I think that

01:19:23,189 --> 01:19:23,199
and I think the I think that
 

3761
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:25,870
and I think the I think that
underestimates the impact can

3762
01:19:25,870 --> 01:19:25,880
underestimates the impact can

somehow early on I learned to kind of
 

4037
01:25:09,119 --> 01:25:12,189
somehow early on I learned to kind of
harness the fear of not being good

4038
01:25:12,189 --> 01:25:12,199
harness the fear of not being good
 

4039
01:25:12,199 --> 01:25:16,510
harness the fear of not being good
enough not being confident enough um and

4040
01:25:16,510 --> 01:25:16,520
enough not being confident enough um and
 

4041
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:20,229
enough not being confident enough um and
I harnessed it to make me better um and

4042
01:25:20,229 --> 01:25:20,239
I harnessed it to make me better um and
 

4043
01:25:20,239 --> 01:25:22,669
I harnessed it to make me better um and
and to push me outside of my comfort

4044
01:25:22,669 --> 01:25:22,679
and to push me outside of my comfort
 

4045
01:25:22,679 --> 01:25:25,430
and to push me outside of my comfort
zone so I think that's always lived with

4046
01:25:25,430 --> 01:25:25,440
zone so I think that's always lived with
 

4047
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:27,510

me and and and I think it probably

4048
01:25:27,510 --> 01:25:27,520
me and and and I think it probably
 

4049
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:30,470
me and and and I think it probably
always will I think you have to have

4050
01:25:30,470 --> 01:25:30,480
always will I think you have to have
 

4051
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:32,470
always will I think you have to have
humility in anything you do that you

4052
01:25:32,470 --> 01:25:32,480
humility in anything you do that you
 

4053
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:36,590
humility in anything you do that you
could be better and and strive for that

4054
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:36,600
could be better and and strive for that
 

4055
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:39,030
could be better and and strive for that
I think as you get older it it softens a

4056
01:25:39,030 --> 01:25:39,040
I think as you get older it it softens a
 

4057
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:42,229
I think as you get older it it softens a
little bit as you have more reps you

4058
01:25:42,229 --> 01:25:42,239
little bit as you have more reps you
 

4059
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:45,629
little bit as you have more reps you
know as you have more examples of of

4060
01:25:45,629 --> 01:25:45,639
know as you have more examples of of
 

4061
01:25:45,639 --> 01:25:48,229
know as you have more examples of of
having been thrown in the deep end um

4062
01:25:48,229 --> 01:25:48,239
having been thrown in the deep end um
 

4063
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:51,109
having been thrown in the deep end um
and figure it out how to swim you you

4064
01:25:51,109 --> 01:25:51,119
and figure it out how to swim you you
 

4065
01:25:51,119 --> 01:25:54,910
and figure it out how to swim you you
get a little bit more com com fortable

4066
01:25:54,910 --> 01:25:54,920
get a little bit more com com fortable
 

4067
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:59,270
get a little bit more com com fortable
in your sort of abstract

4068
01:25:59,270 --> 01:25:59,280
in your sort of abstract
 

4069
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,750
in your sort of abstract
competency but if that fear is not in

01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:01,760
competency but if that fear is not in
 

4071
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,430
competency but if that fear is not in
you I think you're not challenging

4072
01:26:03,430 --> 01:26:03,440
you I think you're not challenging
 

4073
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:06,790
you I think you're not challenging
yourself enough harness the

4074
01:26:06,790 --> 01:26:06,800
yourself enough harness the
 

4075
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:09,430
yourself enough harness the
fear um the other thing he writes about

4076
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:09,440
fear um the other thing he writes about
 

4077
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:11,189
fear um the other thing he writes about
is um

4078
01:26:11,189 --> 01:26:11,199
is um
 

4079
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:13,870
is um
intuition that you need to trust your

4080
01:26:13,870 --> 01:26:13,880
intuition that you need to trust your
 

4081
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:15,470
intuition that you need to trust your
instincts and

4082
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:15,480
instincts and
 

4083
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:19,109
instincts and
intuition uh that's a very recrent thing

4084
01:26:19,109 --> 01:26:19,119
intuition uh that's a very recrent thing
 

4085
01:26:19,119 --> 01:26:21,149
intuition uh that's a very recrent thing
to say but so what percent of your

4086
01:26:21,149 --> 01:26:21,159
to say but so what percent of your
 

4087
01:26:21,159 --> 01:26:24,430
to say but so what percent of your
decision making is intuition and what

4088
01:26:24,430 --> 01:26:24,440
decision making is intuition and what
 

4089
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:28,149
decision making is intuition and what
percent is through rigorous careful

4090
01:26:28,149 --> 01:26:28,159
percent is through rigorous careful
 

4091
01:26:28,159 --> 01:26:30,629
percent is through rigorous careful
analysis would you say it's both it's

4092
01:26:30,629 --> 01:26:30,639
analysis would you say it's both it's
 

4093
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:34,350
analysis would you say it's both it's
like trust but verify you know I think

4094
01:26:34,350 --> 01:26:34,360
like trust but verify you know I think
 

4095
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:38,189
like trust but verify you know I think
you I think that's also where um age and

4096
01:26:38,189 --> 01:26:38,199
you I think that's also where um age and
 

4097
01:26:38,199 --> 01:26:40,470
you I think that's also where um age and
experience comes into play because I

4098
01:26:40,470 --> 01:26:40,480
experience comes into play because I
 

4099
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:41,790
experience comes into play because I
think you always have sort of a gut

4100
01:26:41,790 --> 01:26:41,800
think you always have sort of a gut
 

4101
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:44,629
think you always have sort of a gut
instinct but I think intuition like

4102
01:26:44,629 --> 01:26:44,639
instinct but I think intuition like
 

4103
01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:47,430
instinct but I think intuition like
well-honed intuition comes from a place

4104
01:26:47,430 --> 01:26:47,440
well-honed intuition comes from a place
 

4105
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:51,950
well-honed intuition comes from a place
of of accumulated knowledge right so

4106
01:26:51,950 --> 01:26:51,960
of of accumulated knowledge right so
 

4107
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:53,390
of of accumulated knowledge right so
often times when you feel really

4108
01:26:53,390 --> 01:26:53,400
often times when you feel really
 

4109
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:55,270
often times when you feel really
strongly about something it's because

4110
01:26:55,270 --> 01:26:55,280
strongly about something it's because
 

4111
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:56,910
strongly about something it's because
you've sort of you've been there like

4112
01:26:56,910 --> 01:26:56,920
you've sort of you've been there like
 

4113
01:26:56,920 --> 01:27:00,149
you've sort of you've been there like
you know what's right um or on a

4114
01:27:00,149 --> 01:27:00,159
you know what's right um or on a
 

4115
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:03,510
you know what's right um or on a
personal level if you're acting in

4116
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:03,520
personal level if you're acting in
 

4117
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:06,430
personal level if you're acting in
accordance with your core values you

4118
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:06,440
accordance with your core values you
 

4119
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:09,550
accordance with your core values you
know it just feels good and even if it

4120
01:27:09,550 --> 01:27:09,560
know it just feels good and even if it
 

4121
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:11,030
know it just feels good and even if it
would be the right decision for others

4122
01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:11,040
would be the right decision for others
 

4123
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:14,910
would be the right decision for others
if you're acting outside of of of your

4124
01:27:14,910 --> 01:27:14,920
if you're acting outside of of of your
 

4125
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:16,550
if you're acting outside of of of your
sort of Integrity or core values it

4126
01:27:16,550 --> 01:27:16,560
sort of Integrity or core values it
 

4127
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:19,270
sort of Integrity or core values it
doesn't feel good and and it you know

4128
01:27:19,270 --> 01:27:19,280
doesn't feel good and and it you know
 

4129
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,950
doesn't feel good and and it you know
your intuition um will signal that to

4130
01:27:21,950 --> 01:27:21,960
your intuition um will signal that to
 

4131
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:23,510
your intuition um will signal that to
you you'll never be you'll never be

4132
01:27:23,510 --> 01:27:23,520
you you'll never be you'll never be
 

4133
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:24,790
you you'll never be you'll never be
comfortable

4134
01:27:24,790 --> 01:27:24,800
comfortable
 

4135
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:27,910
comfortable
so I think because because of that I I

4136
01:27:27,910 --> 01:27:27,920
so I think because because of that I I
 

4137
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:30,310
so I think because because of that I I
start oftentimes with my intuition and

4138
01:27:30,310 --> 01:27:30,320
start oftentimes with my intuition and
 

4139
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:31,189
start oftentimes with my intuition and
then

4140
01:27:31,189 --> 01:27:31,199
then
 

4141
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:33,510
then
I and then I put it through like a

4142
01:27:33,510 --> 01:27:33,520
I and then I put it through like a
 

4143
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:37,030
I and then I put it through like a
rigorous test of of whether that is in

4144
01:27:37,030 --> 01:27:37,040
rigorous test of of whether that is in
 

4145
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:40,629
rigorous test of of whether that is in
fact true um but very seldom do I go

4146
01:27:40,629 --> 01:27:40,639
fact true um but very seldom do I go
 

4147
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:43,270
fact true um but very seldom do I go
against what my initial Instinct was not

4148
01:27:43,270 --> 01:27:43,280
against what my initial Instinct was not
 

4149
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:45,470
against what my initial Instinct was not
at least at this point in my life yeah I

4150
01:27:45,470 --> 01:27:45,480
at least at this point in my life yeah I
 

4151
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:47,109
at least at this point in my life yeah I
had actually a discussion yesterday with

4152
01:27:47,109 --> 01:27:47,119
had actually a discussion yesterday with
 

4153
01:27:47,119 --> 01:27:52,030
had actually a discussion yesterday with
a big- Time Business uh owner investor

4154
01:27:52,030 --> 01:27:52,040
a big- Time Business uh owner investor
 

4155
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:54,310
a big- Time Business uh owner investor
who who's talking about being impulsive

4156
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:54,320
who who's talking about being impulsive
 

4157
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:57,149
who who's talking about being impulsive
and following that like on a phone call

4158
01:27:57,149 --> 01:27:57,159
and following that like on a phone call
 

4159
01:27:57,159 --> 01:27:59,470
and following that like on a phone call
shifting like the entire everything like

4160
01:27:59,470 --> 01:27:59,480
shifting like the entire everything like
 

4161
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:01,470
shifting like the entire everything like
giving away a very large amounts of

4162
01:28:01,470 --> 01:28:01,480
giving away a very large amounts of
 

4163
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:04,109
giving away a very large amounts of
money and moving it in another Direction

4164
01:28:04,109 --> 01:28:04,119
money and moving it in another Direction
 

4165
01:28:04,119 --> 01:28:07,750
money and moving it in another Direction
on an Impulse making a promise that he

4166
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:07,760
on an Impulse making a promise that he
 

4167
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:09,709
on an Impulse making a promise that he
can't at that time deliver but knows if

4168
01:28:09,709 --> 01:28:09,719
can't at that time deliver but knows if
 

4169
01:28:09,719 --> 01:28:12,229
can't at that time deliver but knows if
he works hard he'll deliver and all

4170
01:28:12,229 --> 01:28:12,239
he works hard he'll deliver and all
 

4171
01:28:12,239 --> 01:28:15,070
he works hard he'll deliver and all
doing just be following that impulsive

4172
01:28:15,070 --> 01:28:15,080
doing just be following that impulsive
 

4173
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:17,870
doing just be following that impulsive
feeling and he said now that you know he

4174
01:28:17,870 --> 01:28:17,880
feeling and he said now that you know he
 

4175
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:19,709
feeling and he said now that you know he
has has a family that probably some of

4176
01:28:19,709 --> 01:28:19,719
has has a family that probably some of
 

4177
01:28:19,719 --> 01:28:21,510
has has a family that probably some of
that impulse is quieted down a little

4178
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:21,520
that impulse is quieted down a little
 

4179
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:23,070
that impulse is quieted down a little
bit he's more rational and thoughtful

4180
01:28:23,070 --> 01:28:23,080
bit he's more rational and thoughtful
 

4181
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:25,310
bit he's more rational and thoughtful
and so on but wonders

4182
01:28:25,310 --> 01:28:25,320
and so on but wonders
 

4183
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:29,189
and so on but wonders
whether it's sometimes good to just be

4184
01:28:29,189 --> 01:28:29,199
whether it's sometimes good to just be
 

4185
01:28:29,199 --> 01:28:33,229
whether it's sometimes good to just be
impulsive and to just trust your gut and

4186
01:28:33,229 --> 01:28:33,239
impulsive and to just trust your gut and
 

4187
01:28:33,239 --> 01:28:34,750
impulsive and to just trust your gut and
Just Go With It Don't deliberate too

4188
01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:34,760
Just Go With It Don't deliberate too
 

4189
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:36,830
Just Go With It Don't deliberate too
long because then you won't you won't do

4190
01:28:36,830 --> 01:28:36,840
long because then you won't you won't do
 

4191
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:39,470
long because then you won't you won't do
it it's interesting it's the confidence

4192
01:28:39,470 --> 01:28:39,480
it it's interesting it's the confidence
 

4193
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:42,590
it it's interesting it's the confidence
the stupidity maybe of Youth that leads

4194
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:42,600
the stupidity maybe of Youth that leads
 

4195
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:44,669
the stupidity maybe of Youth that leads
to some of the greatest breakthroughs

4196
01:28:44,669 --> 01:28:44,679
to some of the greatest breakthroughs
 

4197
01:28:44,679 --> 01:28:47,550
to some of the greatest breakthroughs
and it's like there's a cost to wisdom

4198
01:28:47,550 --> 01:28:47,560
and it's like there's a cost to wisdom
 

4199
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:48,390
and it's like there's a cost to wisdom
and

4200
01:28:48,390 --> 01:28:48,400
and
 

4201
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:50,709
and
deliberation there there is but I I

4202
01:28:50,709 --> 01:28:50,719
deliberation there there is but I I
 

4203
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:52,709
deliberation there there is but I I

um it was an extraordinary experience
there there was so much intensity and so

4912
01:43:36,870 --> 01:43:36,880
there there was so much intensity and so
 

4913
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:40,750
there there was so much intensity and so
much scrutiny and um and and so much

much scrutiny and um and and so much
 

4915
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:44,470
much scrutiny and um and and so much
noise so that took for sure like a

4916
01:43:44,470 --> 01:43:44,480
noise so that took for sure like a
 

4917
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:46,310
noise so that took for sure like a
moment to acclimate too not sure I ever

4918
01:43:46,310 --> 01:43:46,320
moment to acclimate too not sure I ever
 

4919
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:49,229
moment to acclimate too not sure I ever
fully acclimated but it it definitely

4920

fully acclimated but it it definitely
 

4921
01:43:49,239 --> 01:43:55,430
fully acclimated but it it definitely
was um was a super un usual

experience but I think then the the
 

4925
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:02,070
experience but I think then the the
process that unfolded over over the next

4926

4965
01:44:51,199 --> 01:44:52,550
before people may know um who I was in
some of these situations that I was

01:44:52,550 --> 01:44:52,560
some of these situations that I was
 

4967
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:54,629
some of these situations that I was
going into too but they wouldn't have

4968
01:44:54,629 --> 01:44:54,639
going into too but they wouldn't have
 

4969
01:44:54,639 --> 01:44:57,270
going into too but they wouldn't have
shared with me these things that you got

01:44:58,709 --> 01:44:58,719
the impression that often times their
 

4973
01:44:58,719 --> 01:45:00,430
the impression that often times their
own spouses wouldn't know and they

4974
01:45:00,430 --> 01:45:00,440
own spouses wouldn't know and they
 

4975

all the same the concerns are all the
 

5079
01:47:22,239 --> 01:47:24,350
all the same the concerns are all the
same there's not that much of a division

5080
01:47:24,350 --> 01:47:24,360
same there's not that much of a division
 

5081
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:26,990
same there's not that much of a division
right now the the surface division has

5082
01:47:26,990 --> 01:47:27,000
right now the the surface division has
 

5083
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,149
right now the the surface division has
been Amplified even more maybe because

5084
01:47:29,149 --> 01:47:29,159
been Amplified even more maybe because
 

5085
01:47:29,159 --> 01:47:32,229
been Amplified even more maybe because
of social media I don't know why uh so I

5086
01:47:32,229 --> 01:47:32,239
of social media I don't know why uh so I
 

5087
01:47:32,239 --> 01:47:33,830
of social media I don't know why uh so I
would love to see what the country is

5088
01:47:33,830 --> 01:47:33,840
would love to see what the country is
 

5089
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:37,470
would love to see what the country is
like now but I suspect probably it's

5090
01:47:37,470 --> 01:47:37,480
like now but I suspect probably it's
 

5091
01:47:37,480 --> 01:47:39,990
like now but I suspect probably it's
still not as divided as it appears to be

5092
01:47:39,990 --> 01:47:40,000
still not as divided as it appears to be
 

5093
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,830
still not as divided as it appears to be
on the surface what the media shows with

5094
01:47:42,830 --> 01:47:42,840
on the surface what the media shows with
 

5095
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:45,350
on the surface what the media shows with
the social media shows um but what did

for me the campaign lifted me out of a
 

5117
01:48:12,440 --> 01:48:14,430
for me the campaign lifted me out of a
bubble I didn't even know I was in you

5118
01:48:14,430 --> 01:48:14,440
bubble I didn't even know I was in you
 

5119
01:48:14,440 --> 01:48:16,629
bubble I didn't even know I was in you

01:48:22,239 --> 01:48:24,030
traveled and well educated and I believe
that I believed at the time that I'd

5126
01:48:24,030 --> 01:48:24,040
that I believed at the time that I'd
 

5127
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:26,470
that I believed at the time that I'd
been exposed to Divergent

been exposed to Divergent
 

5129

bug of democracy it's a feature we're in
 

5225
01:50:27,599 --> 01:50:31,950

a constant conflict and it's the way we
resolve we try to figure out the right

5228
01:50:34,189 --> 01:50:34,199
resolve we try to figure out the right
 

5229

01:50:36,830 --> 01:50:36,840
way forward so in the moment it feels
 

5231
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:38,189
way forward so in the moment it feels
like people are just tearing each other

like people are just tearing each other

History it will look like progress but
 

5239
01:50:45,320 --> 01:50:47,229
History it will look like progress but
in the short term it just sounds like

5241
01:50:47,239 --> 01:50:49,069
in the short term it just sounds like

there'd be something really cynical
 

5781
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:36,270
there'd be something really cynical
about thinking they forget but you know

for our federal Workforce I I had people

5804
02:03:00,189 --> 02:03:00,199
for our federal Workforce I I had people
 

5805
02:03:00,199 --> 02:03:02,390
for our federal Workforce I I had people
in the White House who were pregnant who

5806
02:03:02,390 --> 02:03:02,400
in the White House who were pregnant who
 

5807
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:05,910
in the White House who were pregnant who
didn't have access to to paid leave so

didn't have access to to paid leave so
 

5809
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:07,629
didn't have access to to paid leave so
we want to keep people attached to the

we want to keep people attached to the
 

5811
02:03:07,639 --> 02:03:09,189
we want to keep people attached to the
workforce yet when they have an

02:03:09,189 --> 02:03:09,199
workforce yet when they have an
 

5813
02:03:09,199 --> 02:03:13,350
workforce yet when they have an
important life event like a child um we

5814
02:03:13,350 --> 02:03:13,360
important life event like a child um we
 

5815
02:03:13,360 --> 02:03:15,430
important life event like a child um we
create an impossibility for that you

5816
02:03:15,430 --> 02:03:15,440
create an impossibility for that you
 

5817
02:03:15,440 --> 02:03:17,030
create an impossibility for that you
know some people don't even have access

5818
02:03:17,030 --> 02:03:17,040
know some people don't even have access
 

5819
02:03:17,040 --> 02:03:19,790
know some people don't even have access
to to unpaid leave um if they're

5820
02:03:19,790 --> 02:03:19,800
to to unpaid leave um if they're
 

5821
02:03:19,800 --> 02:03:24,270
to to unpaid leave um if they're
part-time workers and so that and um and

5822
02:03:24,270 --> 02:03:24,280
part-time workers and so that and um and
 

5823
02:03:24,280 --> 02:03:27,109
part-time workers and so that and um and
then we also put in place the first ever

5824
02:03:27,109 --> 02:03:27,119
then we also put in place the first ever
 

5825
02:03:27,119 --> 02:03:29,189
then we also put in place the first ever
national tax credit for workers making

5826
02:03:29,189 --> 02:03:29,199
national tax credit for workers making
 

5827
02:03:29,199 --> 02:03:32,589
national tax credit for workers making
under $72,000 a year where employers

5828
02:03:32,589 --> 02:03:32,599
under $72,000 a year where employers
 

5829
02:03:32,599 --> 02:03:34,669
under $72,000 a year where employers
could then offer it to their workers

5830
02:03:34,669 --> 02:03:34,679
could then offer it to their workers
 

5831
02:03:34,679 --> 02:03:36,709
could then offer it to their workers
that was also part of tax cuts so you

5832
02:03:36,709 --> 02:03:36,719
that was also part of tax cuts so you
 

5833
02:03:36,719 --> 02:03:39,270
that was also part of tax cuts so you
know part of it is is really taking

5834
02:03:39,270 --> 02:03:39,280
know part of it is is really taking
 

5835
02:03:39,280 --> 02:03:41,550
know part of it is is really taking
taking the arguments as to why this is

5836
02:03:41,550 --> 02:03:41,560
taking the arguments as to why this is
 

5837
02:03:41,560 --> 02:03:45,589
taking the arguments as to why this is
good smart well-designed policy to

5838
02:03:45,589 --> 02:03:45,599
good smart well-designed policy to
 

5839
02:03:45,599 --> 02:03:48,109
good smart well-designed policy to
people and you know it was one of my big

5840
02:03:48,109 --> 02:03:48,119
people and you know it was one of my big
 

5841
02:03:48,119 --> 02:03:51,149
people and you know it was one of my big
surprises that um on certain policy

5842
02:03:51,149 --> 02:03:51,159
surprises that um on certain policy
 

5843
02:03:51,159 --> 02:03:53,069
surprises that um on certain policy
issues that I thought would have been

5844
02:03:53,069 --> 02:03:53,079
issues that I thought would have been
 

5845
02:03:53,079 --> 02:03:54,510
issues that I thought would have been
well

5846
02:03:54,510 --> 02:03:54,520
well
 

5847
02:03:54,520 --> 02:03:56,750
well
socialized the policies that existed

5848
02:03:56,750 --> 02:03:56,760
socialized the policies that existed
 

5849
02:03:56,760 --> 02:04:00,950
socialized the policies that existed
were never shared across the aisle so

5850
02:04:00,950 --> 02:04:00,960
were never shared across the aisle so
 

5851
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:03,149
were never shared across the aisle so
people just lived with them maybe in

5852
02:04:03,149 --> 02:04:03,159
people just lived with them maybe in
 

5853
02:04:03,159 --> 02:04:05,149
people just lived with them maybe in
hopes that one day they would have the

5854
02:04:05,149 --> 02:04:05,159
hopes that one day they would have the
 

5855
02:04:05,159 --> 02:04:08,189
hopes that one day they would have the
votes to get exactly what they want but

5856
02:04:08,189 --> 02:04:08,199
votes to get exactly what they want but
 

5857
02:04:08,199 --> 02:04:10,069
votes to get exactly what they want but
I was surprised by how little discussion

5858
02:04:10,069 --> 02:04:10,079
I was surprised by how little discussion
 

5859
02:04:10,079 --> 02:04:12,870
I was surprised by how little discussion
there was so so I think part of it is be

5860
02:04:12,870 --> 02:04:12,880
there was so so I think part of it is be
 

5861
02:04:12,880 --> 02:04:15,069
there was so so I think part of it is be
willing to have those tough discussions

5862
02:04:15,069 --> 02:04:15,079
willing to have those tough discussions
 

5863
02:04:15,079 --> 02:04:16,589
willing to have those tough discussions
with people who may not share your

5864
02:04:16,589 --> 02:04:16,599
with people who may not share your
 

5865
02:04:16,599 --> 02:04:20,629
with people who may not share your
Viewpoint and be an active listener when

5866
02:04:20,629 --> 02:04:20,639
Viewpoint and be an active listener when
 

5867
02:04:20,639 --> 02:04:22,390
Viewpoint and be an active listener when
they point out flaws

5868
02:04:22,390 --> 02:04:22,400
they point out flaws
 

5869
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:24,910
they point out flaws
and they have suggestions for for

5870
02:04:24,910 --> 02:04:24,920
and they have suggestions for for
 

5871
02:04:24,920 --> 02:04:28,350
and they have suggestions for for
changes um not believing that you have a

5872
02:04:28,350 --> 02:04:28,360
changes um not believing that you have a
 

5873
02:04:28,360 --> 02:04:31,310
changes um not believing that you have a
monopoly on good ideas and and I think

5874
02:04:31,310 --> 02:04:31,320
monopoly on good ideas and and I think
 

5875
02:04:31,320 --> 02:04:34,910
monopoly on good ideas and and I think
there has to be a lot of humility in in

5876
02:04:34,910 --> 02:04:34,920
there has to be a lot of humility in in
 

5877
02:04:34,920 --> 02:04:38,430
there has to be a lot of humility in in
architecting these things and um and a

5878
02:04:38,430 --> 02:04:38,440
architecting these things and um and a
 

5879
02:04:38,440 --> 02:04:40,350
architecting these things and um and a
policy should benefit from that type of

5880
02:04:40,350 --> 02:04:40,360
policy should benefit from that type of
 

5881
02:04:40,360 --> 02:04:43,790
policy should benefit from that type of
well-rounded input yeah be able to see

5882
02:04:43,790 --> 02:04:43,800
well-rounded input yeah be able to see
 

5883
02:04:43,800 --> 02:04:45,669
well-rounded input yeah be able to see
like you said well-designed policies

5884
02:04:45,669 --> 02:04:45,679
like you said well-designed policies
 

5885
02:04:45,679 --> 02:04:47,270
like you said well-designed policies
there's probably like the details are

5886
02:04:47,270 --> 02:04:47,280
there's probably like the details are
 

5887
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:50,350
there's probably like the details are
important too like there's just just

5888
02:04:50,350 --> 02:04:50,360
important too like there's just just
 

5889
02:04:50,360 --> 02:04:52,830
important too like there's just just
like with architecture and you walk the

5890
02:04:52,830 --> 02:04:52,840
like with architecture and you walk the
 

5891
02:04:52,840 --> 02:04:55,030
like with architecture and you walk the
rooms there's probably really good

5892
02:04:55,030 --> 02:04:55,040
rooms there's probably really good
 

5893
02:04:55,040 --> 02:04:57,870
rooms there's probably really good
designs of policies economic policy that

5894
02:04:57,870 --> 02:04:57,880
designs of policies economic policy that
 

5895
02:04:57,880 --> 02:05:00,950
designs of policies economic policy that
helps families that delivers the maximum

5896
02:05:00,950 --> 02:05:00,960
helps families that delivers the maximum
 

5897
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:03,709
helps families that delivers the maximum
amount of uh money or resources to

5898
02:05:03,709 --> 02:05:03,719
amount of uh money or resources to
 

5899
02:05:03,719 --> 02:05:06,589
amount of uh money or resources to
families that needed and is not a waste

5900
02:05:06,589 --> 02:05:06,599
families that needed and is not a waste
 

5901
02:05:06,599 --> 02:05:09,270
families that needed and is not a waste
of money so like that there's a probably

5902
02:05:09,270 --> 02:05:09,280
of money so like that there's a probably
 

5903
02:05:09,280 --> 02:05:12,149
of money so like that there's a probably
really nice designs there nice ideas

5904
02:05:12,149 --> 02:05:12,159
really nice designs there nice ideas
 

5905
02:05:12,159 --> 02:05:13,830
really nice designs there nice ideas
that are bipartisan that has nothing to

part of the Dynamics and that's a puzzle

6914
02:26:26,990 --> 02:26:27,000
part of the Dynamics and that's a puzzle
 

6915
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,110
part of the Dynamics and that's a puzzle
you also have to figure out and plus

6916

that all kids do and we start to project
 

6953
02:27:11,880 --> 02:27:14,990
that all kids do and we start to project
into the future and like catastrophize

6954
02:27:14,990 --> 02:27:15,000
into the future and like catastrophize
 

6955

you know if like my two sons are going
 

6957
02:27:18,279 --> 02:27:20,349
you know if like my two sons are going
through a moment where they're like oil

6958
02:27:20,349 --> 02:27:20,359
through a moment where they're like oil

very interesting moment so my instinct

6964
02:27:27,230 --> 02:27:27,240
very interesting moment so my instinct
 

6965
02:27:27,240 --> 02:27:29,150
very interesting moment so my instinct
is they're not going to like each other

6966
02:27:29,150 --> 02:27:29,160
is they're not going to like each other
 

6967
02:27:29,160 --> 02:27:30,750
is they're not going to like each other
when they're 25 you know you sort of

6968
02:27:30,750 --> 02:27:30,760
when they're 25 you know you sort of
 

6969
02:27:30,760 --> 02:27:33,269
when they're 25 you know you sort of
project into the future as opposed to

6970
02:27:33,269 --> 02:27:33,279
project into the future as opposed to
 

6971
02:27:33,279 --> 02:27:35,309
project into the future as opposed to
recognizing this is a stage that I too

6972
02:27:35,309 --> 02:27:35,319
recognizing this is a stage that I too
 

6973
02:27:35,319 --> 02:27:39,389
recognizing this is a stage that I too
went through and it's normal and not

6974
02:27:39,389 --> 02:27:39,399
went through and it's normal and not
 

6975
02:27:39,399 --> 02:27:41,429
went through and it's normal and not
building it in your mind

interplanetary my hope is that that

8568
03:01:00,590 --> 03:01:00,600
interplanetary my hope is that that
 

8569
03:01:00,600 --> 03:01:03,710
interplanetary my hope is that that
heightens for us

8570
03:01:03,710 --> 03:01:03,720
heightens for us
 

8571

there's a big component to
 

8583
03:01:18,680 --> 03:01:21,630
there's a big component to
to interplanetary travel that kind of

8584
03:01:21,630 --> 03:01:21,640
to interplanetary travel that kind of
 

8585

inclination like the human desire to
 

8589
03:01:28,359 --> 03:01:30,790
inclination like the human desire to
conquer territory and

8590
03:01:30,790 --> 03:01:30,800
conquer territory and
 

8591
03:01:30,800 --> 03:01:32,429

expand
 

8593
03:01:32,439 --> 03:01:35,150
expand
um the footprint of

03:01:35,150 --> 03:01:35,160
um the footprint of
 

8595
03:01:35,160 --> 03:01:37,710
um the footprint of
civilization that sometimes feels much

8596
03:01:37,710 --> 03:01:37,720
civilization that sometimes feels much
 

8597
03:01:37,720 --> 03:01:40,070

03:01:50,830 --> 03:01:50,840
know maybe an existential imperative for
 

8605
03:01:50,840 --> 03:01:54,550
know maybe an existential imperative for
it at some point or um a strategic or

it at some point or um a strategic or
 

8607
03:01:54,560 --> 03:01:58,030
it at some point or um a strategic or
andsecurity one but um but I hope
