302
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:03,479
they're in a laboratory and so Heights
 

303
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:06,230
they're in a laboratory and so Heights
will always do it and I if people want

304
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:06,240
will always do it and I if people want
 

305
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,830
will always do it and I if people want
to challenge me on this I I like to

movie but I think a lot of its
 

313
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,189
movie but I think a lot of its
popularity can be explained by a puzzle

314

popularity can be explained by a puzzle
 

315
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,870
popularity can be explained by a puzzle
which is you knew he was going to live

316
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:19,880
which is you knew he was going to live

that he he survived and yet it was still
 

323
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,909
that he he survived and yet it was still
scary that people somehow were able to

324
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:28,919
scary that people somehow were able to
 

325
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:30,469
scary that people somehow were able to
put themselves in into that experience

326
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:30,479
put themselves in into that experience
 

327
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,029
put themselves in into that experience
or into Alex's experience enough that

328
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:34,039
or into Alex's experience enough that
 

329
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:36,150
or into Alex's experience enough that
they they were concerned or worried or

330
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,160
they they were concerned or worried or
 

331
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,309
they they were concerned or worried or
afraid at some level so Heights always

332
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:38,319
afraid at some level so Heights always
 

333
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,629
afraid at some level so Heights always
does it if we get people who have

334
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:40,639
does it if we get people who have
 

335
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,230
does it if we get people who have
generalized anxiety these are people who

336
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:43,240
generalized anxiety these are people who
 

337
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,629
generalized anxiety these are people who
walk wake up and move through life at a

338
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:45,639
walk wake up and move through life at a
 

339
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,390
walk wake up and move through life at a
generally higher state of autonomic

340
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:47,400
generally higher state of autonomic
 

341
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,189
generally higher state of autonomic
arousal and anxiety then we can tip them

342
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:50,199
arousal and anxiety then we can tip them
 

343
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:51,629
arousal and anxiety then we can tip them
a little bit more easily with things

344
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:51,639
a little bit more easily with things
 

345
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,189
a little bit more easily with things
that don't necessarily get everyone

346
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:53,199
that don't necessarily get everyone
 

347
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,790
that don't necessarily get everyone
afraid things like um claustrophobia

348
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
afraid things like um claustrophobia

speaking that's going to vary from
 

353
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,189
speaking that's going to vary from
person to person um and then if you're

354
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:02,199
person to person um and then if you're
 

355
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:04,070
person to person um and then if you're
afraid of sharks like my sister for

356
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,080
afraid of sharks like my sister for
 

357
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,110
afraid of sharks like my sister for
instance is afraid of sharks she won't

358
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,120
instance is afraid of sharks she won't
 

359
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,550
instance is afraid of sharks she won't
even come to my laboratory because there

360
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:07,560
even come to my laboratory because there
 

361
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,550
even come to my laboratory because there
there's a thing about sharks in it

362
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:09,560
there's a thing about sharks in it
 

363
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,390
there's a thing about sharks in it
that's how terrified some people are of

364
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:11,400
that's how terrified some people are of
 

365
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,189
that's how terrified some people are of
these specific stimuli but Heights gets

366
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:14,199
these specific stimuli but Heights gets
 

367
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:16,710
these specific stimuli but Heights gets
them every time yeah and I'm terrified

368
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
them every time yeah and I'm terrified
 

369
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,350
them every time yeah and I'm terrified
of heights it it's you know when we have

370
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,360
of heights it it's you know when we have
 

371
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,430
of heights it it's you know when we have
you step off a platform virtual platform

372
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:22,440
you step off a platform virtual platform
 

373
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,629
you step off a platform virtual platform
and it's a flat floor in my lab but we

374
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:25,639
and it's a flat floor in my lab but we
 

375
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,909
and it's a flat floor in my lab but we
you're up there well you actually allow

376
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:27,919
you're up there well you actually allow
 

377
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,309
you're up there well you actually allow
them the possibility in the virtual

378
00:07:29,309 --> 00:07:29,319
them the possibility in the virtual
 

379
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:31,550
them the possibility in the virtual
world world to actually take the leap of

380
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:31,560
world world to actually take the leap of
 

381
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,070
world world to actually take the leap of
faith yeah maybe I should describe a

382
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:33,080
faith yeah maybe I should describe a
 

383
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,270
faith yeah maybe I should describe a
little bit of the experiment so um

384
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,280
little bit of the experiment so um
 

385
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,670
little bit of the experiment so um
without giving away too much in case

386
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:36,680
without giving away too much in case
 

387
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,029
without giving away too much in case
someone wants to be a subject in one of

388
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:38,039
someone wants to be a subject in one of
 

389
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:39,749
someone wants to be a subject in one of
these uh experiments we have them

390
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:39,759
these uh experiments we have them
 

391
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,869
these uh experiments we have them
playing a cognitive game it's a simple

392
00:07:41,869 --> 00:07:41,879
playing a cognitive game it's a simple
 

393
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,469
playing a cognitive game it's a simple
lights out kind of game where you're you

394
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:43,479
lights out kind of game where you're you
 

395
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:45,029
lights out kind of game where you're you
know pointing a cursor and turning out

396
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:45,039
know pointing a cursor and turning out
 

397
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,869
know pointing a cursor and turning out
lights on a grid but it gets

398
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:46,879
lights on a grid but it gets
 

399
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,070
lights on a grid but it gets
increasingly complex and it speeds up on

400
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,080
increasingly complex and it speeds up on
 

401
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,869
increasingly complex and it speeds up on
them and um you know there's a failure

402
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:50,879
them and um you know there's a failure
 

403
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,149
them and um you know there's a failure
point for everybody where they just

404
00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:52,159
point for everybody where they just
 

405
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,670
point for everybody where they just
can't make the motor commands fast

406
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:53,680
can't make the motor commands fast
 

407
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,990
can't make the motor commands fast
enough and then we surprise people

408
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:57,000
enough and then we surprise people
 

409
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,950
enough and then we surprise people
essentially by placing them virtu all of

410
00:07:59,950 --> 00:07:59,960
essentially by placing them virtu all of
 

411
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,350
essentially by placing them virtu all of
a sudden they're SS they're on a narrow

412
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:02,360
a sudden they're SS they're on a narrow
 

413
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,589
a sudden they're SS they're on a narrow
platform between two buildings yeah and

414
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:04,599
platform between two buildings yeah and
 

415
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:07,790
platform between two buildings yeah and
then we encourage them or we cue them

416
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:07,800
then we encourage them or we cue them
 

417
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,430
then we encourage them or we cue them
with a with by talking to them through a

418
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,440
with a with by talking to them through a
 

419
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,469
with a with by talking to them through a
microphone to continue across that

420
00:08:11,469 --> 00:08:11,479
microphone to continue across that
 

421
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:14,510
microphone to continue across that
platform to continue the game and you

422
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:14,520
platform to continue the game and you
 

423
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,270
platform to continue the game and you
know some people they they just won't

424
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
know some people they they just won't
 

425
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,350
know some people they they just won't
they actually will hold get down on the

426
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:19,360
they actually will hold get down on the
 

427
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,670
they actually will hold get down on the
ground and hold on to a virtual beam

428
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:21,680
ground and hold on to a virtual beam
 

429
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,230
ground and hold on to a virtual beam
that doesn't even exist on a flat floor

430
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,240
that doesn't even exist on a flat floor
 

431
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,110
that doesn't even exist on a flat floor
and so what this really tells us is the

432
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:26,120
and so what this really tells us is the
 

433
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,790
and so what this really tells us is the
power of the brain to enter these

434
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:28,800
power of the brain to enter these
 

435
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,230
power of the brain to enter these
virtual States as if they were real and

436
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:31,240
virtual States as if they were real and
 

437
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,750
virtual States as if they were real and
we really think that anchoring the

438
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:32,760
we really think that anchoring the
 

439
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,190
we really think that anchoring the
visual and the vestibular the balance

440
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,200
visual and the vestibular the balance
 

441
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,190
visual and the vestibular the balance
components of the nervous system are

442
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:37,200
components of the nervous system are
 

443
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,469
components of the nervous system are
what bring people into that presence so

444
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:39,479
what bring people into that presence so
 

445
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,310
what bring people into that presence so
quickly there's also the potential and

446
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:41,320
quickly there's also the potential and
 

447
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,430
quickly there's also the potential and
we haven't done this yet to bring in 360

448
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:43,440
we haven't done this yet to bring in 360
 

449
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,590
we haven't done this yet to bring in 360
sound so the reason we did 360 video is

450
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:46,600
sound so the reason we did 360 video is
 

451
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,389
sound so the reason we did 360 video is
when we started all this back in 2016 a

452
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:49,399
when we started all this back in 2016 a
 

453
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:51,389
when we started all this back in 2016 a
lot of the VR was pretty lame frankly it

454
00:08:51,389 --> 00:08:51,399
lot of the VR was pretty lame frankly it
 

455
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:55,030
lot of the VR was pretty lame frankly it
was CGI it just wasn't real enough but

456
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,040
was CGI it just wasn't real enough but
 

457
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,430
was CGI it just wasn't real enough but
with 360 video we knew that we could get

458
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,440
with 360 video we knew that we could get
 

459
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,190
with 360 video we knew that we could get
people into this presence where they

460
00:08:59,190 --> 00:08:59,200
people into this presence where they
 

461
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,590
people into this presence where they
think th in a real experience more

462
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:00,600
think th in a real experience more
 

463
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,949
think th in a real experience more
quickly and our friend Michael meller

he Dives with great white sharks and he
 

475
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,509
he Dives with great white sharks and he
leaves the cage and so we worked with

476
00:09:14,509 --> 00:09:14,519
leaves the cage and so we worked with
 

477
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:17,710
leaves the cage and so we worked with
him to build a 360 video apparatus that

him to build a 360 video apparatus that
we could swim under water with went out

480
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:20,560
we could swim under water with went out
 

481
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,470
we could swim under water with went out
to gual Lupe Island Mexico and actually

482
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:23,480
to gual Lupe Island Mexico and actually
 

483
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,069
to gual Lupe Island Mexico and actually
got the experience it was a lot of fun

484
00:09:25,069 --> 00:09:25,079
got the experience it was a lot of fun
 

485
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:26,389
got the experience it was a lot of fun
it was there were some interesting

486
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:26,399
it was there were some interesting
 

487
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,590
it was there were some interesting
moments out there of danger but it came

488
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:28,600
moments out there of danger but it came
 

489
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,269
moments out there of danger but it came
back with that video and built that for

490
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:30,279
back with that video and built that for
 

491
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,630
back with that video and built that for
the Sharks and then we realize we need

492
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:31,640
the Sharks and then we realize we need
 

493
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,870
the Sharks and then we realize we need
to do this for everything we need to do

494
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:32,880
to do this for everything we need to do
 

495
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,030
to do this for everything we need to do
it for Heights we need to do it for

496
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:34,040
it for Heights we need to do it for
 

497
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,550
it for Heights we need to do it for
public speaking for

498
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:35,560
public speaking for
 

499
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,470
public speaking for
claustrophobia and what what's missing

500
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:38,480
claustrophobia and what what's missing
 

501
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,470
claustrophobia and what what's missing
still is 360 sound where 360 sound would

00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:41,480
still is 360 sound where 360 sound would
 

503
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,710
still is 360 sound where 360 sound would
be U for instance um if I were to turn

504
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:44,720
be U for instance um if I were to turn
 

505
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,949
be U for instance um if I were to turn
around and there was a like a giant

506
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:46,959
around and there was a like a giant
 

507
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,829
around and there was a like a giant
attack dog there the moment I would turn

508
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:48,839
attack dog there the moment I would turn
 

509
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,910
attack dog there the moment I would turn
around and see it the dog would growl

510
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:50,920
around and see it the dog would growl
 

511
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,790
around and see it the dog would growl
but if I turn back toward you right then

512
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:52,800
but if I turn back toward you right then
 

513
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,190
but if I turn back toward you right then
it would it would be silent so and that

514
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:55,200
it would it would be silent so and that
 

515
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,310
it would it would be silent so and that
brings a very real element to one's own

516
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:57,320
brings a very real element to one's own

00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:01,160
going to happen if you turn a corner
 

521
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,150

522
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:03,160
whereas if there's a dog growling behind
 

523
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,190
whereas if there's a dog growling behind
me and I'm and I turn around and then I

524
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:05,200
me and I'm and I turn around and then I
 

525
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,030
me and I'm and I turn around and then I
turn back to you and it's still growling

526
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,040
turn back to you and it's still growling
 

527
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,110
turn back to you and it's still growling
yeah that might seem like more of an

528
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,120
yeah that might seem like more of an
 

529
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,389
yeah that might seem like more of an
impending threat but um and sustained

00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:12,399
impending threat but um and sustained
 

531
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,870
impending threat but um and sustained
threat but actually it's when you start

532
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:13,880
threat but actually it's when you start
 

533
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,870
threat but actually it's when you start
linking your own body movements to the

00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:15,880
linking your own body movements to the
 

535
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,269
linking your own body movements to the

536
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:18,279

538
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:20,079
where my movements and choices are
 

539
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,069
where my movements and choices are
starting to influence things and they're

540
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:22,079
starting to influence things and they're
 

541
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,350
starting to influence things and they're
getting scarier and scarier that's when

542
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:24,360
getting scarier and scarier that's when
 

543
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,829
getting scarier and scarier that's when
you can really Drive people's nervous

544
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:25,839
you can really Drive people's nervous

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,430
you can really Drive people's nervous

states of stress and fear now we don't

548
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:30,279
states of stress and fear now we don't
 

549
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:32,470
states of stress and fear now we don't
want to traumatize people obviously but

550
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:32,480
want to traumatize people obviously but
 

551
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,990
want to traumatize people obviously but
uh we also we also study a number of

552
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:34,000
uh we also we also study a number of
 

553
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,269
uh we also we also study a number of
tools to that allow them to calm

554
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:36,279
tools to that allow them to calm
 

555
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:37,949
tools to that allow them to calm
themselves in these environments so the

556
00:10:37,949 --> 00:10:37,959
themselves in these environments so the
 

557
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:41,350

short answer is Heights heights yeah

558
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,360
short answer is Heights heights yeah
 

559
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,350
short answer is Heights heights yeah

fascinating we did this a little bit

566
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:49,560
fascinating we did this a little bit
 

567
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,069
fascinating we did this a little bit
with autonomous vehicles so to try to

568
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:53,079
with autonomous vehicles so to try to
 

569
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:56,310
with autonomous vehicles so to try to
understand the decision making process

570
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:56,320
understand the decision making process

00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,870
and trying to create an experience of a
car you know that can run you over so

576
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:03,880
car you know that can run you over so
 

577
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,069
car you know that can run you over so
there's a danger of there I was so

578
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:07,079
there's a danger of there I was so
 

579
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:11,790
there's a danger of there I was so
surprised how real that whole world was

580
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:11,800
surprised how real that whole world was
 

581
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,310
surprised how real that whole world was
and the graphics that we built wasn't

582
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:14,320
and the graphics that we built wasn't
 

583
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,790
and the graphics that we built wasn't
ultra realistic or anything but I was

584
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:16,800
ultra realistic or anything but I was
 

585
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,990
ultra realistic or anything but I was
still afraid of being hit by a car but

586
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:19,000
still afraid of being hit by a car but
 

587
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,829
still afraid of being hit by a car but
everybody we tested were really afraid

588
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:20,839
everybody we tested were really afraid
 

589
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:22,310
everybody we tested were really afraid
of being hit by that car even though it

590
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:22,320
of being hit by that car even though it
 

591
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,629
of being hit by that car even though it
was all a simulation it was all

592
00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:23,639
was all a simulation it was all
 

593
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:26,470
was all a simulation it was all
simulation it was uh it was kind of boxy

594
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:26,480
simulation it was uh it was kind of boxy
 

595
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,710
simulation it was uh it was kind of boxy
actually I mean it wasn't like ultra

596
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:28,720
actually I mean it wasn't like ultra
 

597
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,710
actually I mean it wasn't like ultra
realistic simulation and it's

598
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:30,720
realistic simulation and it's
 

599
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,750
realistic simulation and it's

00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,190
fascinating looms and Heights so any
kind of depth we're just programmed to

00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:38,200
kind of depth we're just programmed to
 

603
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,190
kind of depth we're just programmed to
um to not necessarily recoil but to be

604
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:41,200
um to not necessarily recoil but to be
 

605
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,470
um to not necessarily recoil but to be
cautious about that edge and that depth

606
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:43,480
cautious about that edge and that depth
 

607
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,269
cautious about that edge and that depth
and then looms things coming at us that

608
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:45,279
and then looms things coming at us that
 

609
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,790
and then looms things coming at us that
are getting larger there are looming

00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:46,800
are getting larger there are looming
 

611
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,230

swim toward them and they get very
 

627
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,790
swim toward them and they get very
confused when you loom on them because

628
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:07,800
confused when you loom on them because
 

629
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,670
confused when you loom on them because
clearly you're smaller clearly they

clearly you're smaller clearly they
 

631
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,629
clearly you're smaller clearly they
could eat you if they wanted to but

632
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:11,639
could eat you if they wanted to but

toward uh any creature that that
 

637
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,590
toward uh any creature that that
creature questions whether or not it

638
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:17,600
creature questions whether or not it
 

639
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,910
creature questions whether or not it
would be a good idea to generate forward

640
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:19,920
would be a good idea to generate forward
 

641
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,350
would be a good idea to generate forward
movement toward you and so that's

642
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:22,360
movement toward you and so that's
 

643
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,310
movement toward you and so that's
actually the survival tool of these cage

644
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:24,320
actually the survival tool of these cage
 

645
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,629
actually the survival tool of these cage

research is you couldn't do 360 video

652
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:32,480
research is you couldn't do 360 video
 

653
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,350
research is you couldn't do 360 video
because the there's a game theoretic

654
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:34,360
because the there's a game theoretic
 

655
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,949
because the there's a game theoretic
there's an interactive element that's

656
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:35,959
there's an interactive element that's
 

657
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:39,629
there's an interactive element that's
really necessary so maybe people realize

658
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:39,639
really necessary so maybe people realize
 

659
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:43,509
really necessary so maybe people realize
this maybe they don't but 360 video you

660
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:43,519
this maybe they don't but 360 video you
 

661
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,389
this maybe they don't but 360 video you
obviously well it's actually not that

662
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:45,399
obviously well it's actually not that
 

663
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,790
obviously well it's actually not that
obvious to people but you can't change

664
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:47,800
obvious to people but you can't change
 

665
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,030

00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:50,040
the reality that you're watching that's
 

667
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,069
the reality that you're watching that's
right so uh but you find that

668
00:12:53,069 --> 00:12:53,079
right so uh but you find that
 

669
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:55,110
right so uh but you find that
that's like is there something

670
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,120
that's like is there something
 

671
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,550
that's like is there something
fundamental about fear and stress that

672
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:58,560
fundamental about fear and stress that
 

673
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,710
fundamental about fear and stress that
the intera development is essential for

question um it works best to use mixed

680
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:08,600
question um it works best to use mixed
 

681
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,870
question um it works best to use mixed
reality so we have a snake stimulus I

682
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:11,880
reality so we have a snake stimulus I
 

683
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,550
reality so we have a snake stimulus I
personally don't like snakes at all I

684
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:13,560
personally don't like snakes at all I
 

685

don't mind spiders we also have a spider

686
00:13:15,189 --> 00:13:15,199
don't mind spiders we also have a spider
 

687
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:17,310
don't mind spiders we also have a spider
stimulus but like snakes I just don't

688
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:17,320
stimulus but like snakes I just don't
 

689
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,150
stimulus but like snakes I just don't
like them they's something about the the

690
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:19,160
like them they's something about the the
 

691
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,790
like them they's something about the the
slithering and the it just it creates a

692
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:21,800
slithering and the it just it creates a
 

693
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,310
slithering and the it just it creates a
visceral response for me um some people

694
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:24,320
visceral response for me um some people
 

695
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,350
visceral response for me um some people
not so much and they have lower levels

696
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:26,360
not so much and they have lower levels
 

697
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,189
not so much and they have lower levels
of stress and fear in there but one way

698
00:13:29,189 --> 00:13:29,199
of stress and fear in there but one way
 

699
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:31,590
of stress and fear in there but one way
that we can get them to feel more of

700
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:31,600
that we can get them to feel more of
 

701
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,590
that we can get them to feel more of
that is to use mixed reality where we

702
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:34,600
that is to use mixed reality where we
 

703
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,389
that is to use mixed reality where we
have a an actual physical bat and they

704
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:37,399
have a an actual physical bat and they
 

705
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,710
have a an actual physical bat and they
have to stomp out the snake as opposed

706
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:39,720
have to stomp out the snake as opposed
 

707
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,430
have to stomp out the snake as opposed
to just um walk to a little safe Corner

708
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:42,440
to just um walk to a little safe Corner
 

709
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,310
to just um walk to a little safe Corner
which then makes the snake disappear

710
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:44,320
which then makes the snake disappear
 

711
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,509
which then makes the snake disappear
that tends to be not as stressful as if

712
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:46,519
that tends to be not as stressful as if
 

713
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:48,470
that tends to be not as stressful as if
they have a physical weapon and so you

714
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:48,480
they have a physical weapon and so you
 

715
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,910
they have a physical weapon and so you
got people in there you know banging on

716
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:49,920
got people in there you know banging on
 

717
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,629
got people in there you know banging on
the floor against this thing and there's

718
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:51,639
the floor against this thing and there's
 

719
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:54,189
the floor against this thing and there's
something about engaging that makes it

720
00:13:54,189 --> 00:13:54,199
something about engaging that makes it
 

721
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:56,790
something about engaging that makes it
more of a more of a threat now I should

722
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:56,800
more of a more of a threat now I should
 

723
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,350
more of a more of a threat now I should
also mention we we always get the sub

724
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,360
also mention we we always get the sub
 

725
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,829
also mention we we always get the sub
report from the subject of what they

726
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:01,839
report from the subject of what they
 

727
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,230
report from the subject of what they
experience because I we never want to

728
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,240
experience because I we never want to
 

729
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,870
experience because I we never want to
project our own ideas about what they

730
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:05,880
project our own ideas about what they
 

731
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,310
project our own ideas about what they
were feeling but that's a beauty of

732
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:07,320
were feeling but that's a beauty of
 

733
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,030
were feeling but that's a beauty of
working with humans is you can ask them

734
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,040
working with humans is you can ask them
 

735
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,269
working with humans is you can ask them
how they feel exct and humans aren't

736
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:11,279
how they feel exct and humans aren't
 

737
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,110
how they feel exct and humans aren't
great at explaining how they feel um but

738
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:14,120
great at explaining how they feel um but
 

739
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,870
great at explaining how they feel um but
it's a lot easier to understand what

740
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:15,880
it's a lot easier to understand what
 

741
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,910
it's a lot easier to understand what
they're saying than a mouse or a macak

742
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:17,920
they're saying than a mouse or a macak
 

743
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,949
they're saying than a mouse or a macak
monkey is saying um so it's the best we

744
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:20,959
monkey is saying um so it's the best we
 

745
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,230
monkey is saying um so it's the best we
can do is language plus these

746
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:23,240
can do is language plus these
 

747
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,990
can do is language plus these
physiological and neurophysiological

748
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:25,000
physiological and neurophysiological
 

749
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,150
physiological and neurophysiological
signals is there something you've

750
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,160
signals is there something you've
 

751
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,749
signals is there something you've
learned about yourself about your

752
00:14:27,749 --> 00:14:27,759
learned about yourself about your
 

753
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:30,790
learned about yourself about your
deepest fears like you said snakes is

754
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:30,800
deepest fears like you said snakes is
 

755
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,710

murder this people that this person that
 

763
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,110
murder this people that this person that
enter the room but also how how can I

764
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:43,120
enter the room but also how how can I
 

765
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,910

00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:14,560
and and it gets really hot and humid in
 

793
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,269
and and it gets really hot and humid in
there and there were a couple times

794
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:16,279
there and there were a couple times
 

795
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:19,509
there and there were a couple times
where I thought okay this thing is below

796
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:19,519
where I thought okay this thing is below
 

797
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,150
where I thought okay this thing is below
ground it's in a city where there are a

798
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:22,160
ground it's in a city where there are a
 

799
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,590
ground it's in a city where there are a
lot of earthquakes like if this place

800
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:25,600
lot of earthquakes like if this place
 

801
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,230
lot of earthquakes like if this place
crumbled and we were stuck in here and

802
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:27,240
crumbled and we were stuck in here and
 

803
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,230
crumbled and we were stuck in here and
I'd start getting a little panicky and I

804
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:29,240
I'd start getting a little panicky and I
 

805
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,749
I'd start getting a little panicky and I
I'm like I don't like small confined

806
00:15:31,749 --> 00:15:31,759
I'm like I don't like small confined
 

807
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,430
I'm like I don't like small confined
spaces with poor ventilation so I

808
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:33,440
spaces with poor ventilation so I
 

809
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,590
spaces with poor ventilation so I
realize I think I have some

810
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:34,600
realize I think I have some
 

811
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,470
realize I think I have some
claustrophobia and I wasn't aware of

812
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:36,480
claustrophobia and I wasn't aware of
 

813
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,110
claustrophobia and I wasn't aware of
that before so I've put myself into our

814
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:38,120
that before so I've put myself into our
 

815
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,269
that before so I've put myself into our
own

816
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:39,279
own
 

817
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,749
own
claustrophobia stimulus which involves

818
00:15:41,749 --> 00:15:41,759
claustrophobia stimulus which involves
 

819
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,550
claustrophobia stimulus which involves
getting into an elevator um and with a

820
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:44,560
getting into an elevator um and with a
 

821
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,870
getting into an elevator um and with a
bunch of people virtual people and the

822
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:47,880
bunch of people virtual people and the
 

823
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,590
bunch of people virtual people and the
elevator gets stalled and at first

824
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:50,600
elevator gets stalled and at first
 

825
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,949
elevator gets stalled and at first
you're fine you feel fine but then as we

826
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:52,959
you're fine you feel fine but then as we
 

827
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,710
you're fine you feel fine but then as we
start modulating the environment and we

828
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:54,720
start modulating the environment and we
 

829
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,069
start modulating the environment and we
actually can control levels of oxygen in

830
00:15:57,069 --> 00:15:57,079
actually can control levels of oxygen in
 

831
00:15:57,079 --> 00:15:59,910
actually can control levels of oxygen in
the environment if we want to um it is

832
00:15:59,910 --> 00:15:59,920
the environment if we want to um it is
 

833
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,430
the environment if we want to um it is
really uncomfortable for me and I never

834
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:02,440
really uncomfortable for me and I never
 

835
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,910
really uncomfortable for me and I never
would have thought you know I fly I'm

836
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:03,920
would have thought you know I fly I'm
 

837
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,389
would have thought you know I fly I'm
comfortable in Planes I but it is really

838
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:06,399
comfortable in Planes I but it is really
 

839
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,269
comfortable in Planes I but it is really
uncomfortable and so I think I've un

840
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:09,279
uncomfortable and so I think I've un
 

841
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,230
uncomfortable and so I think I've un
unhatched a bit of a claustrophobia yeah

842
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:13,240
unhatched a bit of a claustrophobia yeah
 

843
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,230
unhatched a bit of a claustrophobia yeah
yeah for me as well probably that one

844
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:15,240
yeah for me as well probably that one
 

845
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,949
yeah for me as well probably that one
that one is pretty bad the heights I

846
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:16,959
that one is pretty bad the heights I
 

847
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,590
that one is pretty bad the heights I
tried to overcome so I went to skydiving

848
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:19,600
tried to overcome so I went to skydiving
 

849
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,069
tried to overcome so I went to skydiving
to try to overcome the fear of heights

850
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:22,079
to try to overcome the fear of heights
 

851
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,829
to try to overcome the fear of heights
but that didn't help did you jump out

852
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:23,839
but that didn't help did you jump out
 

853
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,749
but that didn't help did you jump out
yeah jum yeah jumped out but it was it

854
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:25,759
yeah jum yeah jumped out but it was it
 

855
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,150
yeah jum yeah jumped out but it was it
was a it was fundamentally different

856
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,160
was a it was fundamentally different
 

857
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,309
was a it was fundamentally different
experience and I guess there could be a

858
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:31,319
experience and I guess there could be a
 

859
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:33,269
experience and I guess there could be a
lot of different flavors of f Heights

860
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:33,279
lot of different flavors of f Heights
 

861
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,910
lot of different flavors of f Heights
maybe but the one I have didn't seem to

862
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:37,920
maybe but the one I have didn't seem to
 

863
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,430
maybe but the one I have didn't seem to
be connected to jumping out of a plane

864
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:40,440
be connected to jumping out of a plane
 

865
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,670
be connected to jumping out of a plane
is a very different cuz like once you

866
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:42,680
is a very different cuz like once you
 

867
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,430
is a very different cuz like once you
accept that you're going to jump then

868
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:45,440
accept that you're going to jump then
 

869
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,389
accept that you're going to jump then
it's it's a different thing I I think

870
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:47,399
it's it's a different thing I I think
 

871
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,350
it's it's a different thing I I think
what I'm afraid of is the moments before

872
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:51,360
what I'm afraid of is the moments before
 

873
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,829
what I'm afraid of is the moments before
it is is the was the scariest part

874
00:16:54,829 --> 00:16:54,839
it is is the was the scariest part
 

875
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:56,870
it is is the was the scariest part
absolutely and I I don't think that's

876
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:56,880
absolutely and I I don't think that's
 

877
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,150
absolutely and I I don't think that's
emphasized in the skydiving experience

878
00:16:59,150 --> 00:16:59,160
emphasized in the skydiving experience
 

879
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,389
emphasized in the skydiving experience
as much and also just the acceptance of

880
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:02,399
as much and also just the acceptance of
 

881
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,309
as much and also just the acceptance of
the fact that it's going to happen so so

882
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:04,319
the fact that it's going to happen so so
 

883
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,029
the fact that it's going to happen so so
once you accept it it's going to happen

884
00:17:06,029 --> 00:17:06,039
once you accept it it's going to happen
 

885
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:08,630
once you accept it it's going to happen
it's not as scary it's the fact that

886
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:08,640
it's not as scary it's the fact that
 

887
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,150
it's not as scary it's the fact that
it's not supposed to happen and it might

888
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:11,160
it's not supposed to happen and it might
 

889
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,590
it's not supposed to happen and it might
that's the scary part that I guess I'm

890
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:13,600
that's the scary part that I guess I'm
 

891
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,549
that's the scary part that I guess I'm
not being eloquent in this description

892
00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:15,559
not being eloquent in this description
 

893
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:16,990
not being eloquent in this description
but there's something about

894
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:17,000
but there's something about
 

895
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,270
but there's something about
skydiving that uh was actually

896
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:19,280
skydiving that uh was actually
 

897
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,230
skydiving that uh was actually
philosophically liberating I was it I

898
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:21,240
philosophically liberating I was it I
 

899
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,710
philosophically liberating I was it I
was like wow it it was uh the

900
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:24,720
was like wow it it was uh the
 

901
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,590
was like wow it it was uh the
possibility that you can walk on a

902
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:26,600
possibility that you can walk on a
 

903
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,909
possibility that you can walk on a
surface and then at a certain point

904
00:17:28,909 --> 00:17:28,919
surface and then at a certain point
 

905
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:31,470
surface and then at a certain point
there's no surface anymore to walk on

906
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:31,480
there's no surface anymore to walk on
 

907
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,190
there's no surface anymore to walk on
and it's all of a sudden the world

908
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:33,200
and it's all of a sudden the world
 

909
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,310
and it's all of a sudden the world
becomes three-dimensional and there's

910
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:35,320
becomes three-dimensional and there's
 

911
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,549
becomes three-dimensional and there's
this freedom of floating that the

912
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:37,559
this freedom of floating that the
 

913
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:41,950
this freedom of floating that the
concept of like of Earth disappears for

914
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:41,960
concept of like of Earth disappears for
 

915
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,710
concept of like of Earth disappears for
a brief few seconds I don't know that

916
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:43,720
a brief few seconds I don't know that
 

917
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,990
a brief few seconds I don't know that
was that was wild that was wild but I'm

918
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:47,000
was that was wild that was wild but I'm
 

919
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,070
was that was wild that was wild but I'm
still terrified of height so I mean one

920
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:49,080
still terrified of height so I mean one
 

921
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,350
still terrified of height so I mean one
one thing I I want to ask just un fear

922
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:52,360
one thing I I want to ask just un fear
 

923
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,270
one thing I I want to ask just un fear
because it's so fascinating is have you

924
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:55,280
because it's so fascinating is have you
 

925
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,310
because it's so fascinating is have you
um learned anything about what it takes

926
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:57,320
um learned anything about what it takes
 

927
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,390
um learned anything about what it takes
to overcome

928
00:17:59,390 --> 00:17:59,400
to overcome
 

929
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,190
to overcome
fears yes and that comes from two from a

00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:03,200
fears yes and that comes from two from a
 

931
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,710
fears yes and that comes from two from a
you know research study standpoint two

parallel tracks of research one was done

934
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:08,559
parallel tracks of research one was done
 

935
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,270
parallel tracks of research one was done
actually in mice uh because we have a

936
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:10,280
actually in mice uh because we have a
 

937
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,230
actually in mice uh because we have a
mouse lab also where we can prob out in

938
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:12,240
mouse lab also where we can prob out in
 

939
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,590
mouse lab also where we can prob out in
different brain areas and try and figure

940
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:13,600
different brain areas and try and figure
 

941
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,350
different brain areas and try and figure
out what interesting brain areas we

942
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:15,360
out what interesting brain areas we
 

943
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,630
out what interesting brain areas we
might want to prob around in humans and

944
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:18,640
might want to prob around in humans and
 

945
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,230
might want to prob around in humans and

949
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,590
at Caltech um Lindsay SLE um published a
paper back in 2018 showing

950
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:26,600
paper back in 2018 showing
 

951
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,549
paper back in 2018 showing
that what at first might seem a little

952
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:28,559
that what at first might seem a little
 

953
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,590
that what at first might seem a little
bit obvious but the mechanisms are not

954
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:31,600
bit obvious but the mechanisms are not
 

955
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,830
bit obvious but the mechanisms are not
which is that there really three

956
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:32,840
which is that there really three
 

957
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,669
which is that there really three
responses to fear you can pause you can

958
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:35,679
responses to fear you can pause you can
 

959
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,549
responses to fear you can pause you can
freeze essentially um you can Retreat

960
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:38,559
freeze essentially um you can Retreat
 

961
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,669
freeze essentially um you can Retreat
you can back up or you can go forward

962
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:40,679
you can back up or you can go forward
 

963
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:43,669
you can back up or you can go forward
and there's a single Hub of neurons in

964
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:43,679
and there's a single Hub of neurons in
 

965
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,430
and there's a single Hub of neurons in
the midbrain in the it's actually not

966
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:46,440
the midbrain in the it's actually not
 

967
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,230
the midbrain in the it's actually not
the midbrain but it's in the middle of

968
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:48,240
the midbrain but it's in the middle of
 

969
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,270
the midbrain but it's in the middle of
the thalamus which is a forbrain

970
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:50,280
the thalamus which is a forbrain
 

971
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,149
the thalamus which is a forbrain
structure uh and depending on which

972
00:18:53,149 --> 00:18:53,159
structure uh and depending on which
 

973
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:55,190
structure uh and depending on which
neurons are active there there's a much

974
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:55,200
neurons are active there there's a much
 

975
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,830
neurons are active there there's a much
higher probability that a mouse or it

976
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:56,840
higher probability that a mouse or it
 

977
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,110
higher probability that a mouse or it
turns out or a human will advance in the

978
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,120
turns out or a human will advance in the
 

979
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,070
turns out or a human will advance in the
face of fear or will pause or will

980
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,080
face of fear or will pause or will
 

981
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,510
face of fear or will pause or will
Retreat now that just assigns a neural

982
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:04,520
Retreat now that just assigns a neural
 

983
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,630
Retreat now that just assigns a neural
structure to a behavioral phenomenon but

984
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:06,640
structure to a behavioral phenomenon but
 

985
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,669
structure to a behavioral phenomenon but
what's interesting is that it turns out

986
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:09,679
what's interesting is that it turns out
 

987
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,110
what's interesting is that it turns out
that the lowest level of stress or

988
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:12,120
that the lowest level of stress or
 

989
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,549
that the lowest level of stress or
autonomic arousal is actually associated

990
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:14,559
autonomic arousal is actually associated
 

991
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,909
autonomic arousal is actually associated
with the pausing and freezing

992
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:16,919
with the pausing and freezing
 

993
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:19,990
with the pausing and freezing
response then as the threat becomes more

994
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:20,000
response then as the threat becomes more
 

995
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,029
response then as the threat becomes more
impending and we used visual Looms in

996
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:22,039
impending and we used visual Looms in
 

997
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:22,830
impending and we used visual Looms in
this

998
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:22,840
this
 

999
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,310
this
case The Retreat response has a slightly

1000
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:26,320
case The Retreat response has a slightly
 

1001
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,230
case The Retreat response has a slightly
higher level of autonomic arousal and

1002
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:28,240
higher level of autonomic arousal and
 

1003
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,230
higher level of autonomic arousal and
stress so think about playing hide and

1004
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:30,240
stress so think about playing hide and
 

1005
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,190
stress so think about playing hide and
go seek and you're trying to stay quiet

1006
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:32,200
go seek and you're trying to stay quiet
 

1007
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,470
go seek and you're trying to stay quiet
in a uh in a closet that you're hiding

1008
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:34,480
in a uh in a closet that you're hiding
 

1009
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,230
in a uh in a closet that you're hiding
if you're very calm it's easy to stay

1010
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:36,240
if you're very calm it's easy to stay
 

1011
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,470
if you're very calm it's easy to stay
quiet and still as your level of stress

1012
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:38,480
quiet and still as your level of stress
 

1013
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,390
quiet and still as your level of stress
goes up it's harder to maintain that

1014
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:41,400
goes up it's harder to maintain that
 

1015
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,270
goes up it's harder to maintain that
level of quiet and Stillness you see

1016
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:44,280
level of quiet and Stillness you see
 

1017
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,190
level of quiet and Stillness you see
this also in animals that are stalking a

1018
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:46,200
this also in animals that are stalking a
 

1019
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,630
this also in animals that are stalking a
cat will chatter its teeth that's

1020
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:47,640
cat will chatter its teeth that's
 

1021
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,750
cat will chatter its teeth that's
actually sort of top down inhibition and

1022
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:49,760
actually sort of top down inhibition and
 

1023
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,029
actually sort of top down inhibition and
trying to restrain Behavior so the

1024
00:19:52,029 --> 00:19:52,039
trying to restrain Behavior so the
 

1025
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:54,270
trying to restrain Behavior so the
freeze response is actually an active

1026
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:54,280
freeze response is actually an active
 

1027
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,990
freeze response is actually an active
response but it's fairly low stress and

1028
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:57,000
response but it's fairly low stress and
 

1029
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,950
response but it's fairly low stress and
what was interesting to us is that the

1030
00:19:58,950 --> 00:19:58,960
what was interesting to us is that the
 

1031
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,270
what was interesting to us is that the
highest level of autonomic arousal was

1032
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:01,280
highest level of autonomic arousal was
 

1033
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,669
highest level of autonomic arousal was
associated with the forward movement

1034
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:03,679
associated with the forward movement
 

1035
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,149
associated with the forward movement
toward the threat so in your case um

1036
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:06,159
toward the threat so in your case um
 

1037
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,950
toward the threat so in your case um
jumping out of the plane however the

1038
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:08,960
jumping out of the plane however the
 

1039
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,710
jumping out of the plane however the
forward movement in the face of threat

1040
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:11,720
forward movement in the face of threat
 

1041
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,710
forward movement in the face of threat
was linked to the activation of what we

1042
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:14,720
was linked to the activation of what we
 

1043
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,390
was linked to the activation of what we
call collateral which means just a side

1044
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:16,400
call collateral which means just a side
 

1045
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,750
call collateral which means just a side
connection literally a wire in the brain

1046
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:18,760
connection literally a wire in the brain
 

1047
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,390
connection literally a wire in the brain
that connects to the dopamine circuits

1048
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:20,400
that connects to the dopamine circuits
 

1049
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,430
that connects to the dopamine circuits
for reward and so when one safely and

1050
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:24,440
for reward and so when one safely and
 

1051
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,190
for reward and so when one safely and
adaptly meaning you survive moves

1052
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:27,200
adaptly meaning you survive moves
 

1053
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,029
adaptly meaning you survive moves
through a threat or tor a threat it's

1054
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:30,039
through a threat or tor a threat it's
 

1055
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:33,149
through a threat or tor a threat it's
rewarded as a positive experience and so

1056
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:33,159
rewarded as a positive experience and so
 

1057
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:35,430
rewarded as a positive experience and so
the key it actually Maps very well the

1058
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:35,440
the key it actually Maps very well the
 

1059
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,110
the key it actually Maps very well the
cognitive behavioral therapy and a lot

1060
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,120
cognitive behavioral therapy and a lot
 

1061
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,669
cognitive behavioral therapy and a lot
of the existing treatments for trauma is

1062
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:39,679
of the existing treatments for trauma is
 

1063
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,630
of the existing treatments for trauma is
that you have to confront the thing that

1064
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:42,640
that you have to confront the thing that
 

1065
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,350
that you have to confront the thing that
makes you afraid so otherwise you exist

1066
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:45,360
makes you afraid so otherwise you exist
 

1067
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,830
makes you afraid so otherwise you exist
in this very low level of reverberatory

1068
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:47,840
in this very low level of reverberatory
 

1069
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,710
in this very low level of reverberatory
circuit activity where the the circuits

1070
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:50,720
circuit activity where the the circuits
 

1071
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,390
circuit activity where the the circuits
for autonomic arousal are humming and

1072
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:52,400
for autonomic arousal are humming and
 

1073
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,270
for autonomic arousal are humming and
they're humming more and more and more

1074
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:54,280
they're humming more and more and more
 

1075
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,710
they're humming more and more and more
and we have to remember that that stress

1076
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:55,720
and we have to remember that that stress
 

1077
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,830
and we have to remember that that stress
and fear and threat were designed to

1078
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:57,840
and fear and threat were designed to
 

1079
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,270
and fear and threat were designed to
agitate us so that we actually move so

1080
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:01,280
agitate us so that we actually move so
 

1081
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,750
agitate us so that we actually move so
the reason I mentioned this is I think a

1082
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:02,760
the reason I mentioned this is I think a
 

1083
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,870
the reason I mentioned this is I think a
lot of times people think that the

1084
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:04,880
lot of times people think that the
 

1085
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,430
lot of times people think that the
maximum you know stress response or fear

1086
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:07,440
maximum you know stress response or fear
 

1087
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,549
maximum you know stress response or fear
response is to freeze and to lock up

1088
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:09,559
response is to freeze and to lock up
 

1089
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,710
response is to freeze and to lock up
yeah but that's actually not the maximum

1090
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:11,720
yeah but that's actually not the maximum
 

1091
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,350
yeah but that's actually not the maximum
stress response the maximum stress

1092
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:13,360
stress response the maximum stress
 

1093
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,029
stress response the maximum stress
response is to advance but it's

1094
00:21:16,029 --> 00:21:16,039
response is to advance but it's
 

1095
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:18,149
response is to advance but it's
associated with reward it has positive

1096
00:21:18,149 --> 00:21:18,159
associated with reward it has positive
 

1097
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,510
associated with reward it has positive
veilance interesting so so there's this

1098
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:20,520
veilance interesting so so there's this
 

1099
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,909
veilance interesting so so there's this
kind of everyone always thinks about the

1100
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:21,919
kind of everyone always thinks about the
 

1101
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,110
kind of everyone always thinks about the
Bell sh you know the sort of Hump shaped

1102
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:24,120
Bell sh you know the sort of Hump shaped
 

1103
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,909
Bell sh you know the sort of Hump shaped
uh curve for you know at low levels of

1104
00:21:26,909 --> 00:21:26,919
uh curve for you know at low levels of
 

1105
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:28,630
uh curve for you know at low levels of
arousal performance is low and as

1106
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:28,640
arousal performance is low and as
 

1107
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,029
arousal performance is low and as
increases performance goes higher and

1108
00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:30,039
increases performance goes higher and
 

1109
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,269
increases performance goes higher and
then it drops off as you get really

1110
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:31,279
then it drops off as you get really
 

1111
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:33,830
then it drops off as you get really
stressed but there's another bump

1112
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:33,840
stressed but there's another bump
 

1113
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,669
stressed but there's another bump
further out the distribution where you

1114
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:35,679
further out the distribution where you
 

1115
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,909
further out the distribution where you
perform very well under very high levels

1116
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:37,919
perform very well under very high levels
 

1117
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,269
perform very well under very high levels
of stress and so we've been spending a

1118
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:39,279
of stress and so we've been spending a
 

1119
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:41,310
of stress and so we've been spending a
lot of time in humans and in animals

1120
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:41,320
lot of time in humans and in animals
 

1121
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,789
lot of time in humans and in animals
exploring what it takes to get people

1122
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:43,799
exploring what it takes to get people
 

1123
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:47,590
exploring what it takes to get people
comfortable to go to that place and also

1124
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:47,600
comfortable to go to that place and also
 

1125
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,310
comfortable to go to that place and also
to let them experience how there

1126
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:49,320
to let them experience how there
 

1127
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,590
to let them experience how there
heightened states of cognition there

1128
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:51,600
heightened states of cognition there
 

1129
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,029
heightened states of cognition there
there's um changes in time perception

1130
00:21:54,029 --> 00:21:54,039
there's um changes in time perception
 

1131
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:55,710
there's um changes in time perception
that allow you to evaluate your

1132
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:55,720
that allow you to evaluate your
 

1133
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,230
that allow you to evaluate your
environment in fast at a faster frame

1134
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:58,240
environment in fast at a faster frame
 

1135
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,230
environment in fast at a faster frame
rate essentially this is the Matrix as a

1136
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:01,240
rate essentially this is the Matrix as a
 

1137
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,870
rate essentially this is the Matrix as a
lot of people think of it um but we tend

1138
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:03,880
lot of people think of it um but we tend
 

1139
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,950
lot of people think of it um but we tend
to think about fear as all the low-level

1140
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:05,960
to think about fear as all the low-level
 

1141
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,190
to think about fear as all the low-level
stuff where things aren't worked out but

1142
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:08,200
stuff where things aren't worked out but
 

1143
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,029
stuff where things aren't worked out but
there are many um there are a lot of

1144
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:11,039
there are many um there are a lot of
 

1145
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,950
there are many um there are a lot of
different features to the fear response

1146
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:13,960
different features to the fear response
 

1147
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,909
different features to the fear response
and so we think about it quantitatively

1148
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:15,919
and so we think about it quantitatively
 

1149
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,390
and so we think about it quantitatively
and we think about it from a circuit

1150
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:17,400
and we think about it from a circuit
 

1151
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,870
and we think about it from a circuit
perspective in terms of outcomes and we

1152
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:20,880
perspective in terms of outcomes and we
 

1153
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,230
perspective in terms of outcomes and we
try and weigh that against the threat so

1154
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:22,240
try and weigh that against the threat so
 

1155
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,470
try and weigh that against the threat so
we never want people to put themselves

1156
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:23,480
we never want people to put themselves
 

1157
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,110
we never want people to put themselves
in unnecessary risk but that's where the

1158
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,120
in unnecessary risk but that's where the
 

1159
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,430
in unnecessary risk but that's where the
VR is fun because you can push people

1160
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:27,440
VR is fun because you can push people
 

1161
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,470
VR is fun because you can push people
hard without risk R of physically

1162
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:29,480
hard without risk R of physically
 

1163
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,029
hard without risk R of physically
injuring them and that's uh like you

1164
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:32,039
injuring them and that's uh like you
 

1165
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:34,110
injuring them and that's uh like you
said a little bump that that seems to be

1166
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:34,120
said a little bump that that seems to be
 

1167
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,070
said a little bump that that seems to be
a very small fraction of The Human

1168
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:36,080
a very small fraction of The Human
 

1169
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,830
a very small fraction of The Human
Experience right so it's kind of

1170
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:37,840
Experience right so it's kind of
 

1171
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,909
Experience right so it's kind of
fascinating to study it because um most

1172
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:40,919
fascinating to study it because um most
 

1173
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:43,510
fascinating to study it because um most
of us move through life

1174
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:43,520
of us move through life
 

1175
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,350
of us move through life
without ever experiencing that kind of

1176
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:46,360
without ever experiencing that kind of
 

1177
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,470
without ever experiencing that kind of
uh Focus well everything's in a peak

1178
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:49,480
uh Focus well everything's in a peak
 

1179
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,390
uh Focus well everything's in a peak
State there I really think that's where

1180
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:51,400
State there I really think that's where
 

1181
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,070
State there I really think that's where
Optimal Performance lies there's so many

1182
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,080
Optimal Performance lies there's so many
 

1183
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,870
Optimal Performance lies there's so many
interesting words here but what's

1184
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:56,880
interesting words here but what's
 

1185
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,029
interesting words here but what's
performance and what's Optimal

1186
00:22:59,029 --> 00:22:59,039
performance and what's Optimal
 

1187
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,870
performance and what's Optimal
Performance we're talking about mental

1188
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:01,880
Performance we're talking about mental
 

1189
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,149
Performance we're talking about mental
ability to what to perceive the

1190
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:05,159
ability to what to perceive the
 

1191
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:07,390
ability to what to perceive the
environment quickly to make actions

1192
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:07,400
environment quickly to make actions
 

1193
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,630
environment quickly to make actions
quickly what's Optimal Performance yeah

1194
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:09,640
quickly what's Optimal Performance yeah
 

1195
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,029
quickly what's Optimal Performance yeah
well it's very subjective and it varies

1196
00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:12,039
well it's very subjective and it varies
 

1197
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:15,590
well it's very subjective and it varies
depending on um task and environment so

1198
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:15,600
depending on um task and environment so
 

1199
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,909
depending on um task and environment so
one way that we can make it a little bit

1200
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:16,919
one way that we can make it a little bit
 

1201
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:20,390
one way that we can make it a little bit
more operational and concrete is to say

1202
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:20,400
more operational and concrete is to say
 

1203
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,549
more operational and concrete is to say
um there is a sweet spot if you will

1204
00:23:23,549 --> 00:23:23,559
um there is a sweet spot if you will
 

1205
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:26,510
um there is a sweet spot if you will
where the level of internal autonomic

1206
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:26,520
where the level of internal autonomic
 

1207
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,549
where the level of internal autonomic

you want to call it is ideally matched
 

1211
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,149
you want to call it is ideally matched
to the speed of whatever challenge you

00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:36,159
to the speed of whatever challenge you
 

1213
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,549
to the speed of whatever challenge you
have be facing in the outside world so

1214
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:38,559
have be facing in the outside world so
 

1215
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,070
have be facing in the outside world so
we all have um perception of the outside

1216
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:41,080
we all have um perception of the outside
 

1217
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,549
we all have um perception of the outside
world as exteroception and then

1218
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:42,559
world as exteroception and then
 

1219
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,390
world as exteroception and then

when interception and exteroception are
 

1225
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,590
when interception and exteroception are

matched along a couple Dimensions
 

1227
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,029

performance uh tends to increase or

1228
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:55,039
performance uh tends to increase or
 

1229
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,669
performance uh tends to increase or
tends to be in in optimal range so for

1230
00:23:58,669 --> 00:23:58,679
tends to be in in optimal range so for
 

1231
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:00,430
tends to be in in optimal range so for
instance if you're I don't play guitar

1232
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:00,440
instance if you're I don't play guitar
 

1233
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,750
instance if you're I don't play guitar
but I know you play guitar so let's say

1234
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:01,760
but I know you play guitar so let's say
 

1235
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,909
but I know you play guitar so let's say
you're trying to learn something new on

1236
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:02,919
you're trying to learn something new on
 

1237
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:03,789
you're trying to learn something new on
the

1238
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:03,799
the
 

1239
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:05,870
the
guitar I'm not saying that being in

1240
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:05,880
guitar I'm not saying that being in
 

1241
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,990
guitar I'm not saying that being in
these super high states of activation

1242
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,000
these super high states of activation
 

1243
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,390
these super high states of activation
are the best place for you to be in

1244
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:09,400
are the best place for you to be in
 

1245
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,230
are the best place for you to be in
order to learn it may be that you your

1246
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:13,240
order to learn it may be that you your
 

1247
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,990
order to learn it may be that you your
internal arousal needs to be at a level

1248
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,000
internal arousal needs to be at a level
 

1249
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,070
internal arousal needs to be at a level
where your analysis of space and time

1250
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:19,080
where your analysis of space and time
 

1251
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,430
where your analysis of space and time
has to be well matched to the

00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:20,440
has to be well matched to the
 

1253
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,830
has to be well matched to the
information coming in and what you're

1254
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:22,840
information coming in and what you're
 

1255
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,470
information coming in and what you're
trying to do in terms of performance in

00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:25,480
trying to do in terms of performance in
 

1257
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,230
trying to do in terms of performance in
terms of playing chords and notes and so

00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:30,600
in these cases of high threat where
 

1263
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,549
in these cases of high threat where
things are coming in quickly and animals

things are coming in quickly and animals
 

1265
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,950
things are coming in quickly and animals
and humans need to react very quickly

and humans need to react very quickly
the higher your state of autonomic

1268
00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:36,679
the higher your state of autonomic
 

1269
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:39,389
the higher your state of autonomic
arousal the better because you're

1270
00:24:39,389 --> 00:24:39,399
arousal the better because you're
 

1271
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:41,470
arousal the better because you're
slicing time more finely just because of

1272
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:41,480
slicing time more finely just because of
 

1273
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,669
slicing time more finely just because of
the way the autonomic system works it

1274
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:43,679
the way the autonomic system works it
 

1275
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,510
the way the autonomic system works it
you know the the P P the pupil dilation

1276
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:46,520
you know the the P P the pupil dilation
 

1277
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,389
you know the the P P the pupil dilation
for instance and movement of the lens

1278
00:24:48,389 --> 00:24:48,399
for instance and movement of the lens
 

1279
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:50,669

00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:50,679
essentially changes your your Optics
 

1281
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:53,190
essentially changes your your Optics
that's obvious but in with the change in

that's obvious but in with the change in
Optics is a change in how you bin time

1284
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:55,279
Optics is a change in how you bin time
 

1285
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,470
Optics is a change in how you bin time
and slice time which allows you to get

00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:57,480
and slice time which allows you to get
 

1287
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,269
and slice time which allows you to get

music so I can't I'm guessing here but

1298
00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:12,279
music so I can't I'm guessing here but
 

1299
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:14,190

sense some of the Nuance in the chords

1300
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:14,200
sense some of the Nuance in the chords
 

1301
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,230
sense some of the Nuance in the chords
or the ways that you're to be relaxed

1302
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:16,240
or the ways that you're to be relaxed
 

1303
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,669
or the ways that you're to be relaxed
enough that your fingers can follow an

00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:17,679
enough that your fingers can follow an
 

1305
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,750
enough that your fingers can follow an
external cue so matching the movement of

1306
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:19,760
external cue so matching the movement of
 

1307
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,230
external cue so matching the movement of
your fingers to something that's pure

your fingers to something that's pure
 

1309
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,389
your fingers to something that's pure
exteroception and so there is

1310
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:24,399
exteroception and so there is
 

1311
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:29,230
exteroception and so there is
no perfect autonomic state for uh

1312

features of the external demands so

1326
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:49,480
features of the external demands so
 

1327
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,230
features of the external demands so
there's some some slicing of time that

1328
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:51,240
there's some some slicing of time that
 

1329
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,909
there's some some slicing of time that
happens and then you're you're able to

1330
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:53,919
happens and then you're you're able to
 

1331
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,269
happens and then you're you're able to
adjust slice time more finely or more

1332
00:25:57,269 --> 00:25:57,279
adjust slice time more finely or more
 

1333

00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:13,240
wrote a book about deep work oh yeah I
 

1345
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:18,470
wrote a book about deep work oh yeah I
love that book yeah he's great uh so he

words uh put to the the concepts that
 

1355
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,269

00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:29,279
you've practice ractice it somehow makes
 

1357
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,549
you've practice ractice it somehow makes
them more concrete and allows you to uh

1358
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:32,559
them more concrete and allows you to uh
 

1359
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,870
them more concrete and allows you to uh
to get better it turns it into a skill

1360
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:34,880
to get better it turns it into a skill
 

1361
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,350
to get better it turns it into a skill
that you can get better at but you know

1362
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:37,360
that you can get better at but you know
 

1363
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,590
that you can get better at but you know
I also value deep

1370
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:48,000
concept for long periods of time so
 

1371
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,549
concept for long periods of time so
programming you have to do that kind of

1372
00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:49,559
programming you have to do that kind of
 

1373
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:51,669
programming you have to do that kind of
thing for you just have to hold this

1374
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:51,679
thing for you just have to hold this
 

1375
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,070
thing for you just have to hold this
concept like like you you hold it and

1376
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:55,080
concept like like you you hold it and
 

1377
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,590
concept like like you you hold it and
then you take steps with it you take

1378
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:56,600
then you take steps with it you take
 

1379
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,269
then you take steps with it you take
further steps and you you're holding

1380
00:26:59,269 --> 00:26:59,279
further steps and you you're holding
 

1381
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,190
further steps and you you're holding
relatively complicated things in your

relatively complicated things in your
mind as you're thinking about them and

mind as you're thinking about them and
 

1385
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,510
mind as you're thinking about them and
there's a lot of I mean the hardest part

1386
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:06,520
there's a lot of I mean the hardest part
 

1387
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,549
there's a lot of I mean the hardest part
is there's uh frustrating things like

1388
00:27:09,549 --> 00:27:09,559
is there's uh frustrating things like
 

1389
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:11,230
is there's uh frustrating things like
you take a step and it turns out to be

1390
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:11,240
you take a step and it turns out to be
 

1391
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,549
you take a step and it turns out to be
the wrong direction so you have to

1392
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:12,559
the wrong direction so you have to
 

1393
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,110
the wrong direction so you have to
calmly turn around and take a step back

1394
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:15,120
calmly turn around and take a step back
 

1395
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,870
calmly turn around and take a step back
and then it's you kind of like exploring

1396
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:16,880
and then it's you kind of like exploring
 

1397
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,789
and then it's you kind of like exploring
through the space of ideas is there

1398
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:18,799
through the space of ideas is there
 

1399
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,830
through the space of ideas is there
something about your study of Optimal

1400
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:21,840
something about your study of Optimal
 

1401
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,269
something about your study of Optimal
Performance that could be applied to the

1402
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:24,279
Performance that could be applied to the
 

1403
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:28,230
Performance that could be applied to the
act of thinking as opposed to action

1404

act of thinking as opposed to action
 

1405
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,350
act of thinking as opposed to action
well we haven't done too much work there

1406
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:30,360
well we haven't done too much work there
 

1407
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,549
well we haven't done too much work there
but what um but I think I can comment on

1408
00:27:32,549 --> 00:27:32,559
but what um but I think I can comment on
 

1409
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,950
but what um but I think I can comment on
it from a neuroscience perspective which

1410
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:34,960
it from a neuroscience perspective which
 

1411
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,070
it from a neuroscience perspective which
is really all I do is well I I mean we

1412
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:37,080
is really all I do is well I I mean we
 

1413
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,070
is really all I do is well I I mean we
do experiments in the lab but um looking

1414
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:39,080
do experiments in the lab but um looking
 

1415
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,070
do experiments in the lab but um looking
at things through the lens of

1416
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:40,080
at things through the lens of
 

1417
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,070
at things through the lens of
Neuroscience so what you're describing

1418
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:43,080
Neuroscience so what you're describing
 

1419
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,470
Neuroscience so what you're describing
um can be mapped fairly well to working

1420
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:45,480
um can be mapped fairly well to working
 

1421
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,630
um can be mapped fairly well to working
memory just keeping things online and

your brain uh Jack Feldman who I'm a
 

1429
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,630
your brain uh Jack Feldman who I'm a
huge fan of and um fortunate to be

1430
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:58,640
huge fan of and um fortunate to be
 

1431
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,669
huge fan of and um fortunate to be
friends with is a uh professor at UCLA

1432
00:28:01,669 --> 00:28:01,679
friends with is a uh professor at UCLA
 

1433
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,310

works on respiration and breathing but

1434
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:03,320
works on respiration and breathing but
 

1435
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,870
works on respiration and breathing but
he has a physics background and um and

1436
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:05,880
he has a physics background and um and
 

1437
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,070
he has a physics background and um and
so he thinks about respiration and

1438
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:07,080
so he thinks about respiration and
 

1439
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,830
so he thinks about respiration and
breathing in terms of ground States and

1440
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:09,840
breathing in terms of ground States and
 

1441
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,190
breathing in terms of ground States and
how they modulate other states very very

1442
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:12,200
how they modulate other states very very
 

1443
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,310
how they modulate other states very very
interesting and I think um important

1444
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:14,320
interesting and I think um important
 

1445
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,710
interesting and I think um important
work Jack uh has an answer to your

1446
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:17,720
work Jack uh has an answer to your
 

1447
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,509
work Jack uh has an answer to your
question so I'm not going to get this

1448
00:28:19,509 --> 00:28:19,519
question so I'm not going to get this
 

1449
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:20,909

from a coffee conversation that we had

1452
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:22,640
from a coffee conversation that we had
 

1453
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,350
from a coffee conversation that we had
about a month ago but uh so um apologies

1454
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:26,360
about a month ago but uh so um apologies
 

1455
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,350
about a month ago but uh so um apologies
in advance for the but I think I it

1456
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:28,360
in advance for the but I think I it
 

1457
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,830
in advance for the but I think I it
mostly right so we were talking about

1458
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:30,840
mostly right so we were talking about
 

1459
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,590
mostly right so we were talking about
this about how the brain updates

1460
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:33,600
this about how the brain updates
 

1461
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,669
this about how the brain updates
cognitive States depending on demands

1462

and thinking in particular and he used

1464
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:38,200
and thinking in particular and he used
 

1465
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,750
and thinking in particular and he used
an interesting example I'd be curious to

1466
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:39,760
an interesting example I'd be curious to
 

1467
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,630
an interesting example I'd be curious to
know if you agree or disagree uh he said

1468
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:42,640
know if you agree or disagree uh he said
 

1469
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,470
know if you agree or disagree uh he said
you know most great mathematics that's

1470
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:45,480
you know most great mathematics that's
 

1471
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,389
you know most great mathematics that's
done by people in their late teens and

1472
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:48,399
done by people in their late teens and
 

1473
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,870
done by people in their late teens and
20s and even you could say early 20s

1474
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:51,880
20s and even you could say early 20s
 

1475
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,549
20s and even you could say early 20s
sometimes into the late 20s but not much

1476
00:28:53,549 --> 00:28:53,559
sometimes into the late 20s but not much
 

1477
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:56,029
sometimes into the late 20s but not much
further on maybe I just insulted some

1478
00:28:56,029 --> 00:28:56,039
further on maybe I just insulted some
 

1479
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:57,789
further on maybe I just insulted some
mathematicians no that's that's that's

1480
00:28:57,789 --> 00:28:57,799
mathematicians no that's that's that's
 

1481
00:28:57,799 --> 00:29:00,269
mathematicians no that's that's that's
true and I think that it demands his

00:29:00,269 --> 00:29:00,279
true and I think that it demands his
 

1483
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:02,350
true and I think that it demands his
argument was um there's a tremendous

1484
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:02,360
argument was um there's a tremendous
 

1485
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,669
argument was um there's a tremendous
Demand on working memory to work out

1486
00:29:04,669 --> 00:29:04,679
Demand on working memory to work out
 

1487
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:07,509
Demand on working memory to work out
theorems in math and to keep a number of

1488
00:29:07,509 --> 00:29:07,519
theorems in math and to keep a number of
 

1489
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:09,430
theorems in math and to keep a number of
plates spinning so to speak mentally and

physics Jack said and I I'm in I think

1496
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:17,000
physics Jack said and I I'm in I think
 

1497
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,750
physics Jack said and I I'm in I think
this makes sense to me too that there's

1498
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:19,760
this makes sense to me too that there's
 

1499
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,990
this makes sense to me too that there's
a Reliance on working memory but an

1500
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:22,000
a Reliance on working memory but an
 

1501
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,990
a Reliance on working memory but an
increased Reliance on some sort of deep

1502
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:26,000
increased Reliance on some sort of deep
 

1503
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,110
increased Reliance on some sort of deep
deep memory and deep memory stores

1504
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:28,120
deep memory and deep memory stores
 

1505
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,110
deep memory and deep memory stores
probably stuff that's moved out of the

1506
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:29,120
probably stuff that's moved out of the
 

1507
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,990
probably stuff that's moved out of the
hippocampus and forbrain and into the

1508
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:31,000
hippocampus and forbrain and into the
 

1509
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,509
hippocampus and forbrain and into the
cortex and is um more some episodic and

1510
00:29:35,509 --> 00:29:35,519
cortex and is um more some episodic and
 

1511
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:37,190
cortex and is um more some episodic and
declarative stuff but really so you're

1512
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:37,200
declarative stuff but really so you're
 

1513
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,669
declarative stuff but really so you're
you're pulling from your library

1514
00:29:38,669 --> 00:29:38,679
you're pulling from your library
 

1515
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:40,389
you're pulling from your library
basically it's not all Ram it's not all

1516
00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:40,399
basically it's not all Ram it's not all
 

1517
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,430
basically it's not all Ram it's not all
working memory and then in

1518
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:42,440
working memory and then in
 

1519
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,190
working memory and then in
biology and physicists tend to have very

1520
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:45,200
biology and physicists tend to have very
 

1521
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,350
biology and physicists tend to have very
active careers into their you know 30s

1522
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:47,360
active careers into their you know 30s
 

1523
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,710
active careers into their you know 30s
and 40s and 50s and so forth um

1524
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:49,720
and 40s and 50s and so forth um
 

1525
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,470
and 40s and 50s and so forth um
sometimes later and then in biology you

1526
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:52,480
sometimes later and then in biology you
 

1527
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,110
sometimes later and then in biology you
see careers that have a much longer Arc

1528
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:55,120
see careers that have a much longer Arc
 

1529
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,350
see careers that have a much longer Arc
kind of these protracted careers often

1530
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:57,360
kind of these protracted careers often
 

1531
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,750
kind of these protracted careers often
uh people still their 60s and 70s doing

1532
00:29:59,750 --> 00:29:59,760
uh people still their 60s and 70s doing
 

1533
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,029
uh people still their 60s and 70s doing
doing really terrific work not always

00:30:02,029 --> 00:30:02,039
doing really terrific work not always
 

1535
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:03,430
doing really terrific work not always
doing it with their own hands because

1536
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:03,440
doing it with their own hands because
 

1537
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,789
doing it with their own hands because
there people in the labs are doing them

1538
00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:04,799
there people in the labs are doing them
 

1539
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,990
there people in the labs are doing them
of course but um and that work does tend

1540
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,000
of course but um and that work does tend
 

1541
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,350
of course but um and that work does tend
to rely on insights gained from having a

1542
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:11,360
to rely on insights gained from having a
 

1543
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,110
to rely on insights gained from having a
very deep knowledge base where you can

1544
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:14,120
very deep knowledge base where you can
 

1545
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,789
very deep knowledge base where you can
remember a paper and a or maybe a figure

1546
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:16,799
remember a paper and a or maybe a figure
 

1547
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,310
remember a paper and a or maybe a figure
in a paper you could go look it up if

1548
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:18,320
in a paper you could go look it up if
 

1549
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,310
in a paper you could go look it up if
you wanted to but it's very different

1550
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:20,320
you wanted to but it's very different
 

1551
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,830
you wanted to but it's very different
than the working memory of the

00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:21,840
than the working memory of the
 

1553
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,509
than the working memory of the
mathematician and so when you're talking

1554
00:30:24,509 --> 00:30:24,519
mathematician and so when you're talking
 

1555
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:27,430
mathematician and so when you're talking
about coding or being in that tunnel of

about coding or being in that tunnel of

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,870
about coding or being in that tunnel of

keeping a lot of plates spinning it it

1560
00:30:32,509 --> 00:30:32,519
keeping a lot of plates spinning it it
 

1561
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:35,750
keeping a lot of plates spinning it it
speaks directly to working memory my lab

1562
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:35,760
speaks directly to working memory my lab
 

1563
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,470
speaks directly to working memory my lab
hasn't done too much of that working

hasn't done too much of that working
 

1565
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,990
hasn't done too much of that working

1567
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,029

simple lights out tasks while they're

1570
00:30:44,029 --> 00:30:44,039
simple lights out tasks while they're
 

1571
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:46,669
simple lights out tasks while they're
under we can increase the cognitive load

1572
00:30:46,669 --> 00:30:46,679
under we can increase the cognitive load
 

1573
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,389
under we can increase the cognitive load
by increasing the level of autonomic

1574
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:48,399
by increasing the level of autonomic
 

1575
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,110
by increasing the level of autonomic
arousal to the point where they start

1576
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:50,120
arousal to the point where they start
 

1577
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,310
arousal to the point where they start
doing less well Y and you know everyone

1578
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:53,320
doing less well Y and you know everyone
 

1579
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,950
doing less well Y and you know everyone
has a cliff this is what's kind of fun

1580
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:54,960
has a cliff this is what's kind of fun
 

1581
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,389
has a cliff this is what's kind of fun
we've had um you know Seal Team

1582
00:30:56,389 --> 00:30:56,399
we've had um you know Seal Team
 

1583
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:57,750
we've had um you know Seal Team
operators come to the lab we've had

1584
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:57,760
operators come to the lab we've had
 

1585
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,710
operators come to the lab we've had
people from other units in the military

1586
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:00,720
people from other units in the military
 

1587
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,230
people from other units in the military
very you know we've had a range of of

1588
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:03,240
very you know we've had a range of of
 

1589
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,029
very you know we've had a range of of
intellects and backgrounds and all sorts

1590
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:05,039
intellects and backgrounds and all sorts
 

1591
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,549
intellects and backgrounds and all sorts
of things and everyone has a cliff and

1592
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:07,559
of things and everyone has a cliff and
 

1593
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:09,870
of things and everyone has a cliff and
those Cliffs uh sometimes show up as a

1594
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:09,880
those Cliffs uh sometimes show up as a
 

1595
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,750
those Cliffs uh sometimes show up as a
function of the demands of speed of

1596
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:13,760
function of the demands of speed of
 

1597
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,070
function of the demands of speed of
processing or how many things you need

1598
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:16,080
processing or how many things you need
 

1599
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,310
processing or how many things you need
to keep online I mean we're all Limited

1600
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:18,320
to keep online I mean we're all Limited
 

1601
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,389
to keep online I mean we're all Limited
at some point in the number of things we

1602
00:31:19,389 --> 00:31:19,399
at some point in the number of things we
 

1603
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:20,629
at some point in the number of things we
can keep online so what you're

1604
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:20,639
can keep online so what you're
 

1605
00:31:20,639 --> 00:31:22,110
can keep online so what you're
describing is very interesting because

1606
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:22,120
describing is very interesting because
 

1607
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,950
describing is very interesting because
it I think it has to do with how narrow

1608
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:24,960
it I think it has to do with how narrow
 

1609
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,110
it I think it has to do with how narrow
or broad the information set is because

1610
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:28,120
or broad the information set is because
 

1611
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,029
or broad the information set is because
and I don't proog I'm not an active

1612
00:31:30,029 --> 00:31:30,039
and I don't proog I'm not an active
 

1613
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:31,950
and I don't proog I'm not an active
programmer so and this is a regime I

1614
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:31,960
programmer so and this is a regime I
 

1615
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,750
programmer so and this is a regime I
don't really fully know so I don't want

1616
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:33,760
don't really fully know so I don't want
 

1617
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,830
don't really fully know so I don't want
to comment about it uh in that in anyway

1618
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:36,840
to comment about it uh in that in anyway
 

1619
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,029
to comment about it uh in that in anyway
uh that that you know doesn't suggest

1620
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:39,039
uh that that you know doesn't suggest
 

1621
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,389
uh that that you know doesn't suggest
that but I think that what you're

1622
00:31:40,389 --> 00:31:40,399
that but I think that what you're
 

1623
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,990
that but I think that what you're
talking about is top- down control so

1624
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:44,000
talking about is top- down control so
 

1625
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,629
talking about is top- down control so
this is prefrontal cortex keeping every

1626
00:31:46,629 --> 00:31:46,639
this is prefrontal cortex keeping every
 

1627
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:49,230
this is prefrontal cortex keeping every
bit of reflexive circuitry at Bay the

1628
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:49,240
bit of reflexive circuitry at Bay the
 

1629
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,269
bit of reflexive circuitry at Bay the
one that makes you want to get up and

1630
00:31:50,269 --> 00:31:50,279
one that makes you want to get up and
 

1631
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:51,509
one that makes you want to get up and
use the restroom the one that makes you

1632
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:51,519
use the restroom the one that makes you
 

1633
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,950
use the restroom the one that makes you
want to check your phone all of that but

1634
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:53,960
want to check your phone all of that but
 

1635
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,870
want to check your phone all of that but
also running these anterior Thalamus to

1636
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:57,880
also running these anterior Thalamus to
 

1637
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,190
also running these anterior Thalamus to
prefrontal cortex Loops which we know

1638
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:00,200
prefrontal cortex Loops which we know
 

1639
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,350
prefrontal cortex Loops which we know
are very important for working memory

1640
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:02,360
are very important for working memory
 

1641
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,110
are very important for working memory
yeah let me try to think through this a

1642
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:04,120
yeah let me try to think through this a
 

1643
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,710
yeah let me try to think through this a
little bit

1644
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:06,720
little bit
 

1645
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,990
little bit
so reducing the process of thinking to

1646
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:10,000
so reducing the process of thinking to
 

1647
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,669
so reducing the process of thinking to
working memory

1648
00:32:11,669 --> 00:32:11,679
working memory
 

1649
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,710
working memory
access is tricky he's probably

1650
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:14,720
access is tricky he's probably
 

1651
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,750
access is tricky he's probably
ultimately

1652
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:15,760
ultimately
 

1653
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,310
ultimately
correct but if I were to say some of the

1654
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:19,320
correct but if I were to say some of the
 

1655
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,509
correct but if I were to say some of the
most challenging things that uh an

1656
00:32:22,509 --> 00:32:22,519
most challenging things that uh an
 

1657
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:25,789
most challenging things that uh an
engineer has to do and a scient

1658
00:32:25,789 --> 00:32:25,799
engineer has to do and a scient
 

1659
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,549
engineer has to do and a scient
scientific thinker I would say it's kind

1660
00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:27,559
scientific thinker I would say it's kind
 

1661
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:28,990
scientific thinker I would say it's kind
of pressing to think that we do that

1662
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:29,000
of pressing to think that we do that
 

1663
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,070
of pressing to think that we do that
best in our 20s but is uh this kind of

1664
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:32,080
best in our 20s but is uh this kind of
 

1665
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:37,110
best in our 20s but is uh this kind of
first principles thinking step of of

1666
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:37,120
first principles thinking step of of
 

1667
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,149
first principles thinking step of of
saying you're you're accessing the

1668
00:32:40,149 --> 00:32:40,159
saying you're you're accessing the
 

1669
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,029
saying you're you're accessing the
things that you

1670
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:42,039
things that you
 

1671
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:46,149
things that you
know and then saying well let me how do

1672
00:32:46,149 --> 00:32:46,159
know and then saying well let me how do
 

1673
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,950
know and then saying well let me how do
I do this differently than I've done it

1674
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:47,960
I do this differently than I've done it
 

1675
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,549
I do this differently than I've done it
before this this weird like stepping

1676
00:32:51,549 --> 00:32:51,559
before this this weird like stepping
 

1677
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:55,629
before this this weird like stepping
back like is this right let's try it

1678
00:32:55,629 --> 00:32:55,639
back like is this right let's try it
 

1679
00:32:55,639 --> 00:32:58,870
back like is this right let's try it
this other way that that's the the most

1680
00:32:58,870 --> 00:32:58,880
this other way that that's the the most
 

1681
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,830
this other way that that's the the most
mentally taxing step it's like you

1682
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:01,840
mentally taxing step it's like you
 

1683
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,830
mentally taxing step it's like you
you've gotten quite good at this

1684
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:03,840
you've gotten quite good at this
 

1685
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,789
you've gotten quite good at this
particular pattern of how you solve this

1686
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:06,799
particular pattern of how you solve this
 

1687
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,509
particular pattern of how you solve this
particular problem so there's a there's

1688
00:33:08,509 --> 00:33:08,519
particular problem so there's a there's
 

1689
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:11,269
particular problem so there's a there's
a pattern recognition first you're like

1690
00:33:11,269 --> 00:33:11,279
a pattern recognition first you're like
 

1691
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,549
a pattern recognition first you're like
okay I know how to build a thing that

1692
00:33:13,549 --> 00:33:13,559
okay I know how to build a thing that
 

1693
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,029
okay I know how to build a thing that
solves this particular problem in

1694
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:15,039
solves this particular problem in
 

1695
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,590
solves this particular problem in
programming say and

1696
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:17,600
programming say and
 

1697
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,350
programming say and
then the question is but can I do it

1698
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:21,360
then the question is but can I do it
 

1699
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,230
then the question is but can I do it
much

1700
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:22,240
much
 

1701
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,549
much
better and I don't know if that's I

1702
00:33:25,549 --> 00:33:25,559
better and I don't know if that's I
 

1703
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:27,110
better and I don't know if that's I
don't know what the hell that is I don't

1704
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:27,120
don't know what the hell that is I don't
 

1705
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,909
don't know what the hell that is I don't
know if that's accessing working memory

1706
00:33:29,909 --> 00:33:29,919
know if that's accessing working memory
 

1707
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,629
know if that's accessing working memory
that's that's almost access maybe it is

1708
00:33:32,629 --> 00:33:32,639
that's that's almost access maybe it is
 

1709
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:34,070
that's that's almost access maybe it is
accessing memory in a sense that's

1710
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,080
accessing memory in a sense that's
 

1711
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,950
accessing memory in a sense that's
trying to find similar patterns in a

1712
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:36,960
trying to find similar patterns in a
 

1713
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,870
trying to find similar patterns in a
totally different place that could be uh

1714
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:38,880
totally different place that could be uh
 

1715
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,750
totally different place that could be uh
projected onto this but you're you're

1716
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:41,760
projected onto this but you're you're
 

1717
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,029
projected onto this but you're you're
it's you're not quering uh facts you're

1718
00:33:45,029 --> 00:33:45,039
it's you're not quering uh facts you're
 

1719
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,950
it's you're not quering uh facts you're
quering like functional things like yes

1720
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:48,960
quering like functional things like yes
 

1721
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,629
quering like functional things like yes
it's patterns I mean you're running

1722
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:50,639
it's patterns I mean you're running
 

1723
00:33:50,639 --> 00:33:52,710
it's patterns I mean you're running
you're testing algorithms yeah right

1724
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:52,720
you're testing algorithms yeah right
 

1725
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,149
you're testing algorithms yeah right
you're testing algorithms I so I want to

1726
00:33:55,149 --> 00:33:55,159
you're testing algorithms I so I want to
 

1727
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:58,310
you're testing algorithms I so I want to
just um because I know

1728
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:58,320
just um because I know
 

1729
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,909
just um because I know
some of the people listening to this and

1730
00:33:59,909 --> 00:33:59,919
some of the people listening to this and
 

1731
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,269
some of the people listening to this and
you have have basis in you know

1732
00:34:02,269 --> 00:34:02,279
you have have basis in you know
 

1733
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:04,110
you have have basis in you know
scientific training and have scientific

1734
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:04,120
scientific training and have scientific
 

1735
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,750
scientific training and have scientific
training so I want to be clear I think

1736
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:05,760
training so I want to be clear I think
 

1737
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,349
training so I want to be clear I think
we can be correct about some things like

1738
00:34:08,349 --> 00:34:08,359
we can be correct about some things like
 

1739
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:09,710
we can be correct about some things like
the role of working memory in these

1740
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:09,720
the role of working memory in these
 

1741
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,190
the role of working memory in these
kinds of processes without being

1742
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:11,200
kinds of processes without being
 

1743
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,550
kinds of processes without being
exhaustive we're not saying they're the

1744
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:12,560
exhaustive we're not saying they're the
 

1745
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,270
exhaustive we're not saying they're the
only thing we're you know we can be

1746
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:14,280
only thing we're you know we can be
 

1747
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,149
only thing we're you know we can be
correct but not assume that that's the

1748
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:16,159
correct but not assume that that's the
 

1749
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,829
correct but not assume that that's the
only thing involved right and I mean

1750
00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:18,839
only thing involved right and I mean
 

1751
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:20,470
only thing involved right and I mean
Neuroscience let's face it is still in

1752
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:20,480
Neuroscience let's face it is still in
 

1753
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,629
Neuroscience let's face it is still in
its infancy I mean we probably know 1%

1754
00:34:22,629 --> 00:34:22,639
its infancy I mean we probably know 1%
 

1755
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,909
its infancy I mean we probably know 1%
of what there is to know about the brain

1756
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:24,919
of what there is to know about the brain
 

1757
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:26,750
of what there is to know about the brain
um you know we've learned so much and

1758
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:26,760
um you know we've learned so much and
 

1759
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,990
um you know we've learned so much and
yet there may be Global states that

1760
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:29,000
yet there may be Global states that
 

1761
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,389
yet there may be Global states that
underly this that make prefrontal

1762
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:32,399
underly this that make prefrontal
 

1763
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,109
underly this that make prefrontal
circuitry work differently than it would

1764
00:34:34,109 --> 00:34:34,119
circuitry work differently than it would
 

1765
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:36,669
circuitry work differently than it would
in a in a different regime or even time

1766
00:34:36,669 --> 00:34:36,679
in a in a different regime or even time
 

1767
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,389
in a in a different regime or even time
of day I mean there's a lot of mysteries

1768
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:38,399
of day I mean there's a lot of mysteries
 

1769
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,829
of day I mean there's a lot of mysteries
about this but so I just want to make

1770
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:40,839
about this but so I just want to make
 

1771
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:43,829
about this but so I just want to make
sure that we we sort of are we're aiming

1772
00:34:43,829 --> 00:34:43,839
sure that we we sort of are we're aiming
 

1773
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,149
sure that we we sort of are we're aiming
for precision and accuracy but but we're

1774
00:34:46,149 --> 00:34:46,159
for precision and accuracy but but we're
 

1775
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,389
for precision and accuracy but but we're
not going to be we're not going to be

1776
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:47,399
not going to be we're not going to be
 

1777
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:49,310
not going to be we're not going to be
exhausted so there's a difference there

1778
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:49,320
exhausted so there's a difference there
 

1779
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,310
exhausted so there's a difference there
and I think uh you know sometimes in the

1780
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:51,320
and I think uh you know sometimes in the
 

1781
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,669
and I think uh you know sometimes in the
vastness of the internet uh that gets

1782
00:34:53,669 --> 00:34:53,679
vastness of the internet uh that gets
 

1783
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:58,670
vastness of the internet uh that gets
forgotten um so the other is that

1784
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:58,680
forgotten um so the other is that
 

1785
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,790
forgotten um so the other is that
um you know we we think about um you

1786
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:02,800
um you know we we think about um you
 

1787
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,470
um you know we we think about um you
know we think about these operations uh

1788
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:05,480
know we think about these operations uh
 

1789
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,190
know we think about these operations uh
at you know really focused keeping a lot

1790
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:08,200
at you know really focused keeping a lot
 

1791
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,750
at you know really focused keeping a lot
of things online but what you were

1792
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:09,760
of things online but what you were
 

1793
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,750
of things online but what you were
describing is actually um it it speaks

1794
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:13,760
describing is actually um it it speaks
 

1795
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,030
describing is actually um it it speaks
to the the very real possibility

1796
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:16,040
to the the very real possibility
 

1797
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,390
to the the very real possibility
probably that the with certainty there's

1798
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:18,400
probably that the with certainty there's
 

1799
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,390
probably that the with certainty there's
another element to all this which is

1800
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:20,400
another element to all this which is
 

1801
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,829
another element to all this which is
when you're trying out lots of things in

1802
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:22,839
when you're trying out lots of things in
 

1803
00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:25,230
when you're trying out lots of things in
particular lots of different algorithms

1804
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:25,240
particular lots of different algorithms
 

1805
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,870
particular lots of different algorithms
you don't want to be in a in a state of

1806
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:27,880
you don't want to be in a in a state of
 

1807
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,230
you don't want to be in a in a state of
very high autonomic arousal that's not

1808
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:30,240
very high autonomic arousal that's not
 

1809
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,589
very high autonomic arousal that's not
what you want because the higher level

of autonomic arousal and stress in the
 

1813
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,349

you're talking about is playing with
 

1819
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,790
you're talking about is playing with
space-time dimensionality and I want to

1820
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:41,800
space-time dimensionality and I want to
 

1821
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,950
space-time dimensionality and I want to
be very clear I mean I'm the son of a

1822
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:43,960
be very clear I mean I'm the son of a
 

1823

1825
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,510
physicist I am not a physicist when I
talk about space and time I'm literally

1826
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:47,520
talk about space and time I'm literally
 

1827
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,309
talk about space and time I'm literally
talking about visual space and how long

1828
00:35:51,309 --> 00:35:51,319
talking about visual space and how long
 

1829
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:52,670
talking about visual space and how long
it takes for my finger to move from this

point to this point you you are facing a

1832
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:54,760
point to this point you you are facing a
 

1833
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,430
point to this point you you are facing a
tiger and trying to figure out how to

1834
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:56,440
tiger and trying to figure out how to
 

1835
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,150
tiger and trying to figure out how to
avoid being eaten by the

1836
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:58,160
avoid being eaten by the
 

1837
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,470
avoid being eaten by the
and that's primarily going to be

1838
00:35:59,470 --> 00:35:59,480
and that's primarily going to be
 

1839
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,349
and that's primarily going to be
determined by the visual system in

1999
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,030

across cortical areas is increased and
 

2001
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,230

00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:07,240
what that does is that means that the
 

2003
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,230
what that does is that means that the
SpaceTime relationship for vision like

2004
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:09,240
SpaceTime relationship for vision like
 

2005
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,829
SpaceTime relationship for vision like
moving my finger from here to here very

rigid SpaceTime relationship right if I
 

2009
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,309
rigid SpaceTime relationship right if I
slow it down it's slower obviously but

2010
00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:14,319
slow it down it's slower obviously but
 

2011
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:15,589
slow it down it's slower obviously but
there's a prediction that can be made

2012
00:39:15,589 --> 00:39:15,599
there's a prediction that can be made
 

2013
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:16,990
there's a prediction that can be made
based on the neurons and the retina and

2014
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:17,000
based on the neurons and the retina and
 

2015
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,990
based on the neurons and the retina and
the cortex on psychedelics this could be

2016
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:19,000
the cortex on psychedelics this could be
 

2017
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,390
the cortex on psychedelics this could be
very strange experience yeah but the

2018
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:21,400
very strange experience yeah but the
 

2019
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,710
very strange experience yeah but the
auditory system has one that's slightly

2020
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:23,720
auditory system has one that's slightly
 

2021
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,030
auditory system has one that's slightly
different SpaceTime and they're matched

2022
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:26,040
different SpaceTime and they're matched
 

2023
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,670
different SpaceTime and they're matched
to one another in deeper Circ in the

2024
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:27,680
to one another in deeper Circ in the
 

2025
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,470
to one another in deeper Circ in the
brain thefactory system has a different

00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:29,480
brain thefactory system has a different
 

2027
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,270
brain thefactory system has a different
SpaceTime relationship to it

2028
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:32,280
SpaceTime relationship to it
 

2029
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,589
SpaceTime relationship to it
so under conditions of of these

2030
00:39:35,589 --> 00:39:35,599
so under conditions of of these
 

2031
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,790
so under conditions of of these
increased activation of these serotonin

2032
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:37,800
increased activation of these serotonin
 

2033
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,030
increased activation of these serotonin
receptors space and time across sensory

suggesting people run out and do

00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:00,640
suggesting people run out and do
 

2053
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,829
suggesting people run out and do
psychedelics because it's very

2054
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:01,839
psychedelics because it's very
 

2055
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,390
psychedelics because it's very
disorganized but essentially what you're

2056
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:03,400
disorganized but essentially what you're
 

2057
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,710
disorganized but essentially what you're
doing is you're mixing the algorithms

2058
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:05,720
doing is you're mixing the algorithms
 

2059
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,750
doing is you're mixing the algorithms
and so when you talk about being able to

00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:07,760
and so when you talk about being able to
 

2061
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,589
and so when you talk about being able to

rely on psychedelics if people choose to

rely on psychedelics if people choose to
 

2065
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,550
rely on psychedelics if people choose to
do that that's their business but in

if you will can start to surface um

2194
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:35,880
if you will can start to surface um

strong state for inducing
 

2197
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,230
strong state for inducing
neuroplasticity and I think that you

2198
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:40,240
neuroplasticity and I think that you
 

2199
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,430
neuroplasticity and I think that you
know so if I had a um I'm part of a

2200
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:42,440
know so if I had a um I'm part of a
 

2201
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,829
know so if I had a um I'm part of a
group um that uh it's called the linal

2202
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:45,839
group um that uh it's called the linal

collective is a group of people that get
 

2205
00:42:47,319 --> 00:42:50,150
collective is a group of people that get
together and talk about um just wild

2206
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:50,160
together and talk about um just wild
 

2207
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,430
together and talk about um just wild
ideas but they try and Implement um and

2208
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:52,440
ideas but they try and Implement um and
 

2209
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,109
ideas but they try and Implement um and
it's a it's a really interesting group

2210
00:42:54,109 --> 00:42:54,119
it's a it's a really interesting group
 

2211
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:57,309

Tech and some other backgrounds academic
 

2215
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,630
Tech and some other backgrounds academic
backgrounds and I was asked you know

2216
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:00,640
backgrounds and I was asked you know
 

2217
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,870
backgrounds and I was asked you know
what would be um if you could create a

2218
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:02,880
what would be um if you could create a
 

2219
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,910
what would be um if you could create a
tool if you just had a tool like your

2220
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:04,920
tool if you just had a tool like your
 

2221
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,829
tool if you just had a tool like your
magic Wan wish for the day what would it

2222
00:43:06,829 --> 00:43:06,839
magic Wan wish for the day what would it
 

2223
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:09,150
magic Wan wish for the day what would it
be I thought it' be really interesting

2224
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:09,160
be I thought it' be really interesting
 

2225
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:12,030
be I thought it' be really interesting
if someone could develop psychedelics

2226
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:12,040
if someone could develop psychedelics
 

2227
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:15,750
if someone could develop psychedelics
that have um onoff switches so you could

2228
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:15,760
that have um onoff switches so you could
 

2229
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,589
that have um onoff switches so you could
go into a psychedelic State very deeply

2230
00:43:19,589 --> 00:43:19,599
go into a psychedelic State very deeply
 

2231
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,230
go into a psychedelic State very deeply
for 10 minutes but you could launch

2232
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:22,240
for 10 minutes but you could launch
 

2233
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,829
for 10 minutes but you could launch
yourself out of that state and place

2234
00:43:23,829 --> 00:43:23,839
yourself out of that state and place
 

2235
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:26,030
yourself out of that state and place
yourself into a linear real world State

2236
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:26,040
yourself into a linear real world State
 

2237
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,230
yourself into a linear real world State
very quickly so that you could extract

2238
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:28,240
very quickly so that you could extract
 

2239
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,870
very quickly so that you could extract
whatever it was that that happened in

2240
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:29,880
whatever it was that that happened in
 

2241
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,349
whatever it was that that happened in
that experience and then go back in if

2242
00:43:31,349 --> 00:43:31,359
that experience and then go back in if
 

2243
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,990
that experience and then go back in if
you wanted because the problem with

2244
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:34,000
you wanted because the problem with
 

2245
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,670
you wanted because the problem with
psychedelic States and dream states is

2246
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:36,680
psychedelic States and dream states is
 

2247
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,510
psychedelic States and dream states is
that first of all a lot of the reason

2248
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:38,520
that first of all a lot of the reason
 

2249
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,030
that first of all a lot of the reason
people do them is they're lying they say

2250
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:41,040
people do them is they're lying they say
 

2251
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,670
people do them is they're lying they say
they want plasticity and they want all

2252
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:42,680
they want plasticity and they want all
 

2253
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,990
they want plasticity and they want all
this stuff they want a peak experience

2254
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:45,000
this stuff they want a peak experience
 

2255
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,829
this stuff they want a peak experience
yeah inside of an amplified experience

2256
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:47,839
yeah inside of an amplified experience
 

2257
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,190
yeah inside of an amplified experience
so they're kind of seeking something

2258
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:49,200
so they're kind of seeking something
 

2259
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,109
so they're kind of seeking something
unusual I think we should just be honest

2260
00:43:51,109 --> 00:43:51,119
unusual I think we should just be honest
 

2261
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,750
unusual I think we should just be honest
about that because a lot of times

2262
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:52,760
about that because a lot of times
 

2263
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,790
about that because a lot of times
they're not trying to make their brain

2264
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:53,800
they're not trying to make their brain
 

2265
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,030
they're not trying to make their brain
better they're just trying to experience

2266
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:55,040
better they're just trying to experience
 

2267
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,870
better they're just trying to experience
something really amazing

2268
00:43:57,870 --> 00:43:57,880
something really amazing
 

2269
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,030
something really amazing
but the problem is space and time are so

2270
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:01,040
but the problem is space and time are so
 

2271
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,349
but the problem is space and time are so
unlocked in these states just like they

2272
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:03,359
unlocked in these states just like they
 

2273
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,829
unlocked in these states just like they
are in dreams that you can really end up

2274
00:44:05,829 --> 00:44:05,839
are in dreams that you can really end up
 

2275
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,829
are in dreams that you can really end up
with a whole lot of nothing you can have

2276
00:44:07,829 --> 00:44:07,839
with a whole lot of nothing you can have
 

2277
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:10,790
with a whole lot of nothing you can have
an amazing Amplified experience housed

2278
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:10,800
an amazing Amplified experience housed
 

2279
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,910
an amazing Amplified experience housed
in an amplified experience and come out

2280
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:12,920
in an amplified experience and come out
 

2281
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,430
in an amplified experience and come out
of that thinking you had a meaningful

2282
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:15,440
of that thinking you had a meaningful
 

2283
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,150
of that thinking you had a meaningful
experience when you didn't bring

2284
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:18,160
experience when you didn't bring
 

2285
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,630
experience when you didn't bring
anything back you didn't bring anything

2286
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:19,640
anything back you didn't bring anything
 

2287
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:23,109
anything back you didn't bring anything
back all all you have is a fuzzy memory

2288
00:44:23,109 --> 00:44:23,119
back all all you have is a fuzzy memory
 

2289
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,790
back all all you have is a fuzzy memory
of having a transformational experience

2290
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:25,800
of having a transformational experience
 

2291
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,109
of having a transformational experience
but you don't actually have yeah tools

2292
00:44:28,109 --> 00:44:28,119
but you don't actually have yeah tools
 

2293
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:31,309
but you don't actually have yeah tools
to bring back or sorry actual actually

2294
00:44:31,309 --> 00:44:31,319
to bring back or sorry actual actually
 

2295
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:33,790
to bring back or sorry actual actually
concrete ideas to bring back yeah it's

2296
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:33,800
concrete ideas to bring back yeah it's
 

2297
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,589
concrete ideas to bring back yeah it's
interesting yeah I wonder if it's

2298
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:35,599
interesting yeah I wonder if it's
 

2299
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:37,990
interesting yeah I wonder if it's
possible to do that with the with a mind

2300
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:38,000
possible to do that with the with a mind
 

2301
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,790
possible to do that with the with a mind
to to be able to hop back and forth I

2302
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:40,800
to to be able to hop back and forth I
 

2303
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,390
to to be able to hop back and forth I
think that's where the real power of you

2304
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:43,400
think that's where the real power of you
 

2305
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,630
think that's where the real power of you
know adjusting States is going to be it

2306
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:45,640
know adjusting States is going to be it
 

2307
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,710
know adjusting States is going to be it
probably will be with devices um I mean

2308
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:47,720
probably will be with devices um I mean
 

2309
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,230
probably will be with devices um I mean
maybe it'll be done through pharmacology

2310
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:49,240
maybe it'll be done through pharmacology
 

2311
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,190
maybe it'll be done through pharmacology
it's just that it's hard to do onoff

2312
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:51,200
it's just that it's hard to do onoff
 

2313
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,390
it's just that it's hard to do onoff
switches in in human pharmacology that

2314
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:53,400
switches in in human pharmacology that
 

2315
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,430
switches in in human pharmacology that
we have them for Animals I mean we we

2316
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:55,440
we have them for Animals I mean we we
 

2317
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,990
we have them for Animals I mean we we
have you know cre flip common Aces and

2318
00:44:57,990 --> 00:44:58,000
have you know cre flip common Aces and
 

2319
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,270
have you know cre flip common Aces and
we have um you know Channel opsins and

2320
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:00,280
we have um you know Channel opsins and
 

2321
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,750
we have um you know Channel opsins and
Halo root opsins and um all these kinds

2322
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:02,760
Halo root opsins and um all these kinds
 

2323
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,790
Halo root opsins and um all these kinds
of things but to to do that work in

2324
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:04,800
of things but to to do that work in
 

2325
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,510
of things but to to do that work in
humans is tricky but I think you could

2326
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:06,520
humans is tricky but I think you could
 

2327
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,630
humans is tricky but I think you could
do it with um virtual reality augmented

2328
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:09,640
do it with um virtual reality augmented
 

2329
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,430
do it with um virtual reality augmented
reality and other devices that bring

2330
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:11,440
reality and other devices that bring
 

2331
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,670
reality and other devices that bring
more of the sematic experience into it

2332
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:13,680
more of the sematic experience into it
 

2333
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,349
more of the sematic experience into it
you're of course a scientist who's

2334
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:15,359
you're of course a scientist who's
 

2335
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:19,230
you're of course a scientist who's
studying humans as a collective I tend

2336
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:19,240
studying humans as a collective I tend
 

2337
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,589
studying humans as a collective I tend
to be just a one person scientist of

2338
00:45:21,589 --> 00:45:21,599
to be just a one person scientist of
 

2339
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,829
to be just a one person scientist of
just looking at myself and you know I

2340
00:45:24,829 --> 00:45:24,839
just looking at myself and you know I
 

2341
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:28,230
just looking at myself and you know I
play when these deep thinking deep work

2342
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:28,240
play when these deep thinking deep work
 

2343
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,230
play when these deep thinking deep work
sessions I'm very cognizant like in the

2344
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:31,240

because if you learn how to titrate

2434
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:24,960
because if you learn how to titrate
 

2435
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,950
because if you learn how to titrate
caffeine everyone's slightly different

caffeine everyone's slightly different
with this what they need but if you

with this what they need but if you
 

2439
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,109
with this what they need but if you
learn to titrate caffeine with time a

trying to do you can bring that
autonomic arousal State into the close

2446

quickly I need a lot of caffeine to wake
up and whatnot but there's this concept

2486
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:23,000
up and whatnot but there's this concept
 

2487
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,790
up and whatnot but there's this concept
of getting the download from sleep which

2488

has a mansion a castle on top of a cliff
 

2653
00:51:32,119 --> 00:51:33,710
has a mansion a castle on top of a cliff
in in the middle of nowhere she actually

2654
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:33,720
in in the middle of nowhere she actually
 

2655
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:37,430
in in the middle of nowhere she actually
purchased her own Island uh so she wants

2656
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:37,440
purchased her own Island uh so she wants
 

2657
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,430
purchased her own Island uh so she wants
silence she wants to control how much

2658
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:40,440
silence she wants to control how much
 

2659
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,230
silence she wants to control how much
sound is coming in and she's very

2660
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:42,240
sound is coming in and she's very
 

2661
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,470
sound is coming in and she's very
sensitive to to sound and environment

2662
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:44,480
sensitive to to sound and environment
 

2663
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,190
sensitive to to sound and environment
yeah beautiful home and environment but

2664
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:46,200
yeah beautiful home and environment but
 

2665
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,270
yeah beautiful home and environment but
like clearly puts a lot of attention

2666
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:48,280
like clearly puts a lot of attention
 

2667
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:51,430
like clearly puts a lot of attention
into into details yeah and and very

2668
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:51,440
into into details yeah and and very
 

2669
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,270
into into details yeah and and very
creative yeah and that's yeah that

2670
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:53,280
creative yeah and that's yeah that
 

2671
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,870
creative yeah and that's yeah that
allows her creativity to flourish I'm

2672
00:51:55,870 --> 00:51:55,880
allows her creativity to flourish I'm
 

2673
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,789
allows her creativity to flourish I'm
also I don't like that feels like a

2674
00:51:58,789 --> 00:51:58,799
also I don't like that feels like a
 

2675
00:51:58,799 --> 00:52:02,430
also I don't like that feels like a
slippery slope so I I enjoy

2676
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:02,440
slippery slope so I I enjoy
 

2677
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,030
slippery slope so I I enjoy
introducing the noises and

2678
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:05,040
introducing the noises and
 

2679
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,549
introducing the noises and
signals and uh training my mind to be

2680
00:52:07,549 --> 00:52:07,559
signals and uh training my mind to be
 

2681
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:10,390
signals and uh training my mind to be
able to tune them out cu I feel like you

2682
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:10,400
able to tune them out cu I feel like you
 

2683
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,150
able to tune them out cu I feel like you
can't always control the environment so

2684
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:12,160
can't always control the environment so
 

2685
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,190
can't always control the environment so
perfectly because uh because your mind

2686
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:15,200
perfectly because uh because your mind
 

2687
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,589
perfectly because uh because your mind
gets comfortable with that I think it's

2688
00:52:16,589 --> 00:52:16,599
gets comfortable with that I think it's
 

2689
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:18,150
gets comfortable with that I think it's
a skill that you want to learn to be

2690
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:18,160
a skill that you want to learn to be
 

2691
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,870
a skill that you want to learn to be
able to shut it off like I often go to

2692
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:20,880
able to shut it off like I often go to
 

2693
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,190
able to shut it off like I often go to
like back before Co to a coffee shop it

2694
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:24,200
like back before Co to a coffee shop it
 

2695
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,030
like back before Co to a coffee shop it
really annoys me when there's sounds and

2696
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:26,040
really annoys me when there's sounds and
 

2697
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,030
really annoys me when there's sounds and
voices and so on but I feel like I can

2698
00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:28,040
voices and so on but I feel like I can
 

2699
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:31,230
voices and so on but I feel like I can
train my mind to to block them out so

2700
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:31,240
train my mind to to block them out so
 

2701
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,309
train my mind to to block them out so
it's it's a balance I think yeah and I

2702
00:52:33,309 --> 00:52:33,319
it's it's a balance I think yeah and I
 

2703
00:52:33,319 --> 00:52:34,870
it's it's a balance I think yeah and I
think um you know two things come to

2704
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:34,880
think um you know two things come to
 

2705
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,309
think um you know two things come to
mind um as you're saying this um first

2706
00:52:37,309 --> 00:52:37,319
mind um as you're saying this um first
 

2707
00:52:37,319 --> 00:52:40,109
mind um as you're saying this um first
of all yeah I mean we're talking about

2708
00:52:40,109 --> 00:52:40,119
of all yeah I mean we're talking about
 

2709
00:52:40,119 --> 00:52:41,870
of all yeah I mean we're talking about
what's best for work is not always

2710
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:41,880
what's best for work is not always
 

2711
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,789
what's best for work is not always
what's best for you know completeness of

2712
00:52:43,789 --> 00:52:43,799
what's best for you know completeness of
 

2713
00:52:43,799 --> 00:52:46,030
what's best for you know completeness of
life I mean you know autism is probably

2714
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:46,040
life I mean you know autism is probably
 

2715
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,829
life I mean you know autism is probably
many things like when we autism just

2716
00:52:47,829 --> 00:52:47,839
many things like when we autism just
 

2717
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:50,109
many things like when we autism just
like Fe there probably 50 ways to get a

2718
00:52:50,109 --> 00:52:50,119
like Fe there probably 50 ways to get a
 

2719
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:52,470
like Fe there probably 50 ways to get a
fever there probably 50 ways to that the

2720
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:52,480
fever there probably 50 ways to that the
 

2721
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,510
fever there probably 50 ways to that the
brain can create what looks like autism

2722
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:54,520
brain can create what looks like autism
 

2723
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,670
brain can create what looks like autism
or what people call autism there's an

2724
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:56,680
or what people call autism there's an
 

2725
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,789
or what people call autism there's an
ing set of studies that have come out of

2726
00:52:58,789 --> 00:52:58,799
ing set of studies that have come out of
 

2727
00:52:58,799 --> 00:53:00,829

00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:06,520
mutants where um these are models for
 

2733
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,430

autism where nothing is disrupted in the

2734
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:09,440
autism where nothing is disrupted in the
 

2735
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,390
autism where nothing is disrupted in the
brain proper and in the central nervous

2736
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:11,400
brain proper and in the central nervous
 

2737
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,589
brain proper and in the central nervous
system but the sensory the sensory

2738
00:53:14,589 --> 00:53:14,599
system but the sensory the sensory
 

2739
00:53:14,599 --> 00:53:16,549
system but the sensory the sensory
neurons the ones that inate the skin and

2740
00:53:16,549 --> 00:53:16,559
neurons the ones that inate the skin and
 

2741
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:18,670
neurons the ones that inate the skin and
the ears and everything are are hyp

2742
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:18,680
the ears and everything are are hyp
 

2743
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,950
the ears and everything are are hyp
sensitive and this maps to a mutation in

2744
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:20,960
sensitive and this maps to a mutation in
 

2745
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,190
sensitive and this maps to a mutation in
certain forms of human autism so this

2746
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:23,200
certain forms of human autism so this
 

2747
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,910
certain forms of human autism so this
means that the the overload of sensory

2748
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:27,920
means that the the overload of sensory
 

2749
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,390
means that the the overload of sensory
information and sensory experience that

2750
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:29,400
information and sensory experience that
 

2751
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,349
information and sensory experience that
a lot of autistics feel they like that

2752
00:53:31,349 --> 00:53:31,359
a lot of autistics feel they like that
 

2753
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:32,829
a lot of autistics feel they like that
they can't tolerate things and then they

2754
00:53:32,829 --> 00:53:32,839
they can't tolerate things and then they
 

2755
00:53:32,839 --> 00:53:34,589
they can't tolerate things and then they
get the stereotype behaviors the rocking

2756
00:53:34,589 --> 00:53:34,599
get the stereotype behaviors the rocking
 

2757
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:37,150
get the stereotype behaviors the rocking
and the kind of the shouting it you know

2758
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:37,160
and the kind of the shouting it you know
 

2759
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,950
and the kind of the shouting it you know
we always thought of that as a brain

2760
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:38,960
we always thought of that as a brain
 

2761
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,990
we always thought of that as a brain
problem in some cases it might be but in

2762
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:42,000
problem in some cases it might be but in
 

2763
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,549
problem in some cases it might be but in
many cases it's because they just can't

2764
00:53:44,549 --> 00:53:44,559
many cases it's because they just can't
 

2765
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:46,309
many cases it's because they just can't
they they seem to have a m it's like

2766
00:53:46,309 --> 00:53:46,319
they they seem to have a m it's like
 

2767
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,349
they they seem to have a m it's like
turning the volume up on every sense and

2768
00:53:48,349 --> 00:53:48,359
turning the volume up on every sense and
 

2769
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:50,030
turning the volume up on every sense and
so they're overwhelmed and none of us

2770
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:50,040
so they're overwhelmed and none of us
 

2771
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,750
so they're overwhelmed and none of us
want to be come like that I think it's

2772
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:51,760
want to be come like that I think it's
 

2773
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,069
want to be come like that I think it's
very hard for them and it's hard for

2774
00:53:53,069 --> 00:53:53,079
very hard for them and it's hard for
 

2775
00:53:53,079 --> 00:53:55,510
very hard for them and it's hard for
their parents and so forth so I I like

2776
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:55,520
their parents and so forth so I I like
 

2777
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,670
their parents and so forth so I I like
the the coffee shoing example because um

2778
00:53:58,670 --> 00:53:58,680
the the coffee shoing example because um
 

2779
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,710
the the coffee shoing example because um
the way I think about trying to build up

2780
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:01,720
the way I think about trying to build up
 

2781
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,589
the way I think about trying to build up
resilience uh you know physically or

2782
00:54:03,589 --> 00:54:03,599
resilience uh you know physically or
 

2783
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:05,630
resilience uh you know physically or
mentally or otherwise is one of um I

2784
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:05,640
mentally or otherwise is one of um I
 

2785
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:06,910
mentally or otherwise is one of um I
guess we could call it Lim I like to

2786
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:06,920
guess we could call it Lim I like to
 

2787
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,670
guess we could call it Lim I like to
call it lyic friction that's not a real

2788
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:08,680
call it lyic friction that's not a real
 

2789
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,270
call it lyic friction that's not a real
scientific term and I acknowledge that

2790
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:10,280
scientific term and I acknowledge that
 

2791
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,950
scientific term and I acknowledge that
I'm making it up now because I think it

2792
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:11,960
I'm making it up now because I think it
 

2793
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,109
I'm making it up now because I think it
captures the concept which is that you

2794
00:54:14,109 --> 00:54:14,119
captures the concept which is that you
 

2795
00:54:14,119 --> 00:54:15,670
captures the concept which is that you
know we always hear about resilience it

2796
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:15,680
know we always hear about resilience it
 

2797
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,190
know we always hear about resilience it
makes it sound like oh you know under

2798
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:17,200
makes it sound like oh you know under
 

2799
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,710
makes it sound like oh you know under
stress where everything's coming at you

2800
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:18,720
stress where everything's coming at you
 

2801
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,470
stress where everything's coming at you
you're going to stay calm but there's

2802
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:20,480
you're going to stay calm but there's
 

2803
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,870
you're going to stay calm but there's
another you know so limic the lyic

2804

how it works why because both orbs are l

2944
00:56:56,230 --> 00:56:56,240
how it works why because both orbs are l
 

2945
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:59,630
how it works why because both orbs are l
linked to that uh to that threat and so

2946
00:56:59,630 --> 00:56:59,640
linked to that uh to that threat and so
 

2947
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,710
linked to that uh to that threat and so
my behavior is now actually being driven

my behavior is now actually being driven

by something external even though I
think it's internal and so I don't want

2952
00:57:04,789 --> 00:57:04,799
think it's internal and so I don't want
 

2953
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:06,470
think it's internal and so I don't want

it's very hard and the other thing that

it's very hard and the other thing that
 

3017
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:15,309
it's very hard and the other thing that
we can link it to is top- down

3023
00:58:19,039 --> 00:58:20,630
environment that has a lot of salience
will tend to bring us into more

3024
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:20,640
will tend to bring us into more
 

3025
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,109
will tend to bring us into more

again I don't want to litter the

conversation with just a bunch of terms
 

3031
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,710

but um what I think it can be useful for
 

3033
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,870
but um what I think it can be useful for
people is to do what essentially you've

00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:30,880
people is to do what essentially you've

00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,150
I what kind of balance between internal
focus and external focus is there and to

00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:51,160
focus and external focus is there and to
 

3051
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,990
focus and external focus is there and to
sort of watch this process throughout

00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:53,000
sort of watch this process throughout
 

3053

cuz use this term a lot it be nice to

3056
00:58:58,510 --> 00:58:58,520
cuz use this term a lot it be nice to
 

3057
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:00,510
cuz use this term a lot it be nice to
try to get a little more color to it

which is interoception and
 

3061
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:06,029
which is interoception and
exteroception uh what are what are we

3062
00:59:06,029 --> 00:59:06,039
exteroception uh what are what are we
 

3063
00:59:06,039 --> 00:59:08,549
exteroception uh what are what are we
exactly talking about so like what's

3064
00:59:08,549 --> 00:59:08,559
exactly talking about so like what's
 

3065
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:10,510
exactly talking about so like what's
included in each category and how much

3066
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:10,520
included in each category and how much
 

3067
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:13,829
included in each category and how much
overlap is there interception would be

3068
00:59:13,829 --> 00:59:13,839
overlap is there interception would be
 

3069
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:16,270
overlap is there interception would be
uh an awareness of anything that's

3070
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:16,280
uh an awareness of anything that's
 

3071
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:18,670
uh an awareness of anything that's
within the confines or on the surface of

probably touch to the skin as well

3080
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:26,680
probably touch to the skin as well
 

3081
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:29,829
probably touch to the skin as well
exteroception would be perception of

3082
00:59:29,829 --> 00:59:29,839
exteroception would be perception of
 

3083
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:32,589
exteroception would be perception of
anything that's ex beyond the reach of

00:59:32,599 --> 00:59:37,230
anything that's ex beyond the reach of

3086
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:37,240
my skin so that that bottle of water um
 

3087
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:41,069

00:59:41,069 --> 00:59:41,079
a scent um a sound although and this can
 

3089
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:42,750
a scent um a sound although and this can
change dramatically actually if you have

3090
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:42,760
change dramatically actually if you have
 

3091
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,230
change dramatically actually if you have
headphones in you tend to hear things in

3092
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:44,240
headphones in you tend to hear things in
 

3093
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,069
headphones in you tend to hear things in
your head if as opposed to a speaker in

3095
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:48,630
your head if as opposed to a speaker in
the room this is actually the basis of

3097
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,870
the room this is actually the basis of
ventriloquism so there are beautiful

UC Davis looking at how auditory and
 

3103
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,270
UC Davis looking at how auditory and
visual cues are matched and you have an

visual cues are matched and you have an
 

3105
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,069
visual cues are matched and you have an
array of speakers and you can this will

3106
01:00:00,069 --> 01:00:00,079
array of speakers and you can this will
 

3107
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:02,109
array of speakers and you can this will
become obvious as I say it but you know

3108
01:00:02,109 --> 01:00:02,119
become obvious as I say it but you know
 

3109
01:00:02,119 --> 01:00:03,549
become obvious as I say it but you know
obviously the ventriloquist doesn't

01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:20,349
I took a picture of your face and I

handed it to you and I'd say that's you

you'd say yeah that's me but if I were

you'd say yeah that's me but if I were

01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:29,950
I took a pen pad and paper maybe I could

do this because I'm a terrible artist
 

3189
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,630
do this because I'm a terrible artist
and I could just mix it up and I let's

and I could just mix it up and I let's
 

3191

and I could just mix it up and I let's
say I would make your eyes like water

that's you say well that's not me and

that's you say well that's not me and
 

3203
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,470
that's you say well that's not me and
I'd say no but that's my abstraction of

01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:42,480
I'd say no but that's my abstraction of
 

3205
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,589
I'd say no but that's my abstraction of
you but that's what the brain does the

3206
01:01:44,589 --> 01:01:44,599
you but that's what the brain does the
 

3207

if people have fully internalized that
 

3217
01:01:56,359 --> 01:01:58,470
if people have fully internalized that
but the day that I and I'm not sure I

but the day that I and I'm not sure I
 

3219
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,349
but the day that I and I'm not sure I
fully internalized that because it's

01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:00,359
fully internalized that because it's

01:02:00,359 --> 01:02:03,349
fully internalized that because it's

01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,109
the uh of the transfer of information
from neuron to neuron I mean there we we

from neuron to neuron I mean there we we
 

3255
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:37,230

certainly touch upon it every time we at

01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:37,240
certainly touch upon it every time we at
 

3257
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:38,670
certainly touch upon it every time we at
all try to think about the difference

all try to think about the difference
 

3259
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:40,789
all try to think about the difference
between artificial neural networks and

between artificial neural networks and
 

3261
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:43,029
between artificial neural networks and

biological neural networks but can we uh
 

3263
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:45,549

01:02:45,549 --> 01:02:45,559
maybe linger a little bit on this uh on
 

3265
01:02:45,559 --> 01:02:48,829
maybe linger a little bit on this uh on
the circuitry that you're getting at so

3266
01:02:48,829 --> 01:02:48,839
the circuitry that you're getting at so
 

3267
01:02:48,839 --> 01:02:50,309
the circuitry that you're getting at so
the brain is just a bunch of stuff

3268
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:50,319
the brain is just a bunch of stuff
 

3269
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:53,549
the brain is just a bunch of stuff
firing and it forms abstractions that

3270
01:02:53,549 --> 01:02:53,559
firing and it forms abstractions that
 

3271
01:02:53,559 --> 01:02:55,190
firing and it forms abstractions that
are fascinating and beautiful like

3272
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:55,200
are fascinating and beautiful like
 

3273
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,150
are fascinating and beautiful like

layers upon layers upon layers of
 

3275
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:59,630
layers upon layers upon layers of
abstraction and I think it uh just like

3276
01:02:59,630 --> 01:02:59,640
abstraction and I think it uh just like
 

3277
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,470
abstraction and I think it uh just like
when you're programming you know I'm

3283
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:08,230

think that Underneath It All it ends up

3284
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:08,240
think that Underneath It All it ends up

we don't understand if we're talking
about vision and that's not just because

01:04:00,269 --> 01:04:00,279
about vision and that's not just because
 

3327

3379
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:59,269
advice I got early in my career and in
part because I'm um not perhaps smart

01:04:59,269 --> 01:04:59,279
part because I'm um not perhaps smart
 

3381
01:04:59,279 --> 01:05:01,470

01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:21,760
yeah yeah I mean I'm happy to have a
 

3399
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:23,549
yeah yeah I mean I'm happy to have a
talk about Consciousness but it's it's a

3400
01:05:23,549 --> 01:05:23,559
talk about Consciousness but it's it's a
 

3401
01:05:23,559 --> 01:05:25,710
talk about Consciousness but it's it's a
scary talk and I think most people don't

3402
01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:25,720
scary talk and I think most people don't
 

3403
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,470
scary talk and I think most people don't
want to hear what I have to say which is

3404
01:05:27,470 --> 01:05:27,480
want to hear what I have to say which is
 

3405
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:29,549
want to hear what I have to say which is
you know which is uh we can save that

3406
01:05:29,549 --> 01:05:29,559
you know which is uh we can save that
 

3407
01:05:29,559 --> 01:05:32,230
you know which is uh we can save that
for later perhaps or it's an interesting

01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:32,240
for later perhaps or it's an interesting
 

3409
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,870
for later perhaps or it's an interesting
question of uh we talk about

3410
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:34,880
question of uh we talk about
 

3411
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,549
question of uh we talk about
psychedelics we can talk about

3412
01:05:36,549 --> 01:05:36,559

01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:46,319
kind of light on these questions so I
 

3421
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:50,029
kind of light on these questions so I
mean it's cool that Vision I mean to me

3422
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:50,039
mean it's cool that Vision I mean to me
 

3423
01:05:50,039 --> 01:05:51,789
mean it's cool that Vision I mean to me
vision is probably one of the most

3424
01:05:51,789 --> 01:05:51,799
vision is probably one of the most
 

3425
01:05:51,799 --> 01:05:53,710
vision is probably one of the most
beautiful things about human beings uh

3426
01:05:53,710 --> 01:05:53,720
beautiful things about human beings uh
 

3427
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:56,789
beautiful things about human beings uh
also from the AI side computer vision

3428
01:05:56,789 --> 01:05:56,799
also from the AI side computer vision
 

3429
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:59,829
also from the AI side computer vision
has the is some of the most exciting

3430
01:05:59,829 --> 01:05:59,839
has the is some of the most exciting
 

3431
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:02,349
has the is some of the most exciting
applications of uh neural networks is in

3432
01:06:02,349 --> 01:06:02,359
applications of uh neural networks is in
 

3433
01:06:02,359 --> 01:06:04,670
applications of uh neural networks is in
computer vision but it feels like that's

3434
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:04,680
computer vision but it feels like that's
 

3435
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:07,549
computer vision but it feels like that's
a that's a neighbor of cognition and

3436
01:06:07,549 --> 01:06:07,559
a that's a neighbor of cognition and
 

3437
01:06:07,559 --> 01:06:09,269
a that's a neighbor of cognition and
Consciousness it's just that we maybe

3438
01:06:09,269 --> 01:06:09,279
Consciousness it's just that we maybe
 

3439
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,750
Consciousness it's just that we maybe
haven't come up with experiments to

01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:10,760
haven't come up with experiments to
 

3441
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,670
haven't come up with experiments to
study those yet yeah the visual system

3442
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:12,680
study those yet yeah the visual system
 

3443
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:14,510

eye that signal to the brain and they
 

3619
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:19,789
eye that signal to the brain and they
mainly signal the presence of things

3620
01:09:19,789 --> 01:09:19,799
mainly signal the presence of things
 

3621
01:09:19,799 --> 01:09:21,070
mainly signal the presence of things
that are lighter than background or

that are lighter than background or
 

3623
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:23,749
that are lighter than background or
darker than background so a black

darker than background so a black
 

3625
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:25,430

objects would be darker than background
 

3627
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:27,030
objects would be darker than background

a light object lighter than background
 

3629
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,990
a light object lighter than background
and that all come it's mainly a it's

3630
01:09:28,990 --> 01:09:29,000
and that all come it's mainly a it's
 

3631
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,110

3633
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,510
looking at pixels mainly it's they look
at circles and those neurons have

3634
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:33,520
at circles and those neurons have
 

3635
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:35,470
at circles and those neurons have
receptive fields which not everyone will

3636
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:35,480
receptive fields which not everyone will
 

3637
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:37,269
receptive fields which not everyone will
understand but those neurons respond

3638
01:09:37,269 --> 01:09:37,279
understand but those neurons respond
 

3639
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:39,070
understand but those neurons respond
best to little Circles of dark light or

3640
01:09:39,070 --> 01:09:39,080
best to little Circles of dark light or
 

3641
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:40,910
best to little Circles of dark light or
little Circles of bright light little

3642
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:40,920
little Circles of bright light little
 

3643
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:42,669
little Circles of bright light little
Circles of red light versus little

3644
01:09:42,669 --> 01:09:42,679
Circles of red light versus little
 

3645
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:45,749
Circles of red light versus little
Circles of green light or blue light and

01:09:45,749 --> 01:09:45,759
Circles of green light or blue light and
 

3647
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:47,990
Circles of green light or blue light and
so it sounds very basic it's like red

3648
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:48,000
so it sounds very basic it's like red
 

3649
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,110
so it sounds very basic it's like red
green blue and circles brighter or

3650
01:09:51,110 --> 01:09:51,120
green blue and circles brighter or
 

3651
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,470
green blue and circles brighter or
dimmer than what's next to it but that's

3652
01:09:53,470 --> 01:09:53,480
dimmer than what's next to it but that's
 

3653
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:55,990
dimmer than what's next to it but that's
basically the only information that sent

3654
01:09:55,990 --> 01:09:56,000
basically the only information that sent
 

3655
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,350
basically the only information that sent
down the optic nerve and when we say

3656
01:09:58,350 --> 01:09:58,360
down the optic nerve and when we say
 

3657
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,229
down the optic nerve and when we say
information we can be very precise I

3658
01:10:00,229 --> 01:10:00,239
information we can be very precise I
 

3659
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:01,870
information we can be very precise I
don't mean little bits of red traveling

3660
01:10:01,870 --> 01:10:01,880
don't mean little bits of red traveling
 

3661
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:03,669
don't mean little bits of red traveling
down the optic nerve I mean spikes

01:10:03,669 --> 01:10:03,679
down the optic nerve I mean spikes
 

3663
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:06,470

time which for you is like makes total
 

3667
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:11,270

sense but I think for a lot of people it

3668
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:11,280
sense but I think for a lot of people it
 

3669
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:14,149
sense but I think for a lot of people it
it's actually beautiful to think about

3670
01:10:14,149 --> 01:10:14,159
it's actually beautiful to think about
 

3671
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:15,550
it's actually beautiful to think about
all that information in the outside

3672
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:15,560
all that information in the outside
 

3673
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:17,430
all that information in the outside
world is converted into a language

3674
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:17,440
world is converted into a language
 

3675
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:19,030
world is converted into a language
that's very simple it's just like a few

3676
01:10:19,030 --> 01:10:19,040
that's very simple it's just like a few
 

3677
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,270
that's very simple it's just like a few
syllables if you will and those

3678
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:21,280
syllables if you will and those
 

3679
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:23,630
syllables if you will and those
syllables are being shouted down the

3680
01:10:23,630 --> 01:10:23,640
syllables are being shouted down the
 

3681
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,470

code goes into the brain and then the

3686
01:10:29,510 --> 01:10:29,520
code goes into the brain and then the
 

3687
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,030
code goes into the brain and then the
thalamus essentially responds in the

3688
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:31,040
thalamus essentially responds in the
 

3689
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:33,870
thalamus essentially responds in the
same way that the retina does except the

3690
01:10:33,870 --> 01:10:33,880
same way that the retina does except the
 

3691
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:36,630
same way that the retina does except the
thalamus is also waiting things it's

3692
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:36,640
thalamus is also waiting things it's
 

3693
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:40,310
thalamus is also waiting things it's
saying you know what that thing um was

3694
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:40,320
saying you know what that thing um was
 

3695
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,430
saying you know what that thing um was
moving faster than everything else or

3696
01:10:42,430 --> 01:10:42,440
moving faster than everything else or
 

3697
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:44,149
moving faster than everything else or
it's brighter than everything else so

3698
01:10:44,149 --> 01:10:44,159
it's brighter than everything else so
 

3699
01:10:44,159 --> 01:10:45,390
it's brighter than everything else so
that signal I'm going to get up I'm

3700
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:45,400
that signal I'm going to get up I'm
 

3701
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:46,709
that signal I'm going to get up I'm
going to allow up to

3702
01:10:46,709 --> 01:10:46,719
going to allow up to
 

3703
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:50,950
going to allow up to
Cortex or that signal is much redder

3704
01:10:50,950 --> 01:10:50,960
Cortex or that signal is much redder
 

3705
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:52,510
Cortex or that signal is much redder
than it is green so I'm going to let

3706
01:10:52,510 --> 01:10:52,520
than it is green so I'm going to let
 

3707
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:54,110
than it is green so I'm going to let
that signal go through that signal is

3708
01:10:54,110 --> 01:10:54,120
that signal go through that signal is
 

3709
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:56,669
that signal go through that signal is
much eh it's kind of more like the red

3710
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:56,679
much eh it's kind of more like the red
 

3711
01:10:56,679 --> 01:10:58,830
much eh it's kind of more like the red
next to it throw that out the

3712
01:10:58,830 --> 01:10:58,840
next to it throw that out the
 

3713
01:10:58,840 --> 01:10:59,990
next to it throw that out the
information just doesn't get up into

3714
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:00,000
information just doesn't get up into
 

3715
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,510
information just doesn't get up into
your cortex and then in cortex of course

3716
01:11:01,510 --> 01:11:01,520
your cortex and then in cortex of course
 

3717
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:04,350
your cortex and then in cortex of course
is where perceptions happen and in V1 if

3718
01:11:04,350 --> 01:11:04,360
is where perceptions happen and in V1 if
 

3719
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,750
is where perceptions happen and in V1 if
you will visual area one but also some

3720
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:06,760
you will visual area one but also some
 

3721
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:09,350
you will visual area one but also some
neighboring areas you start getting

3722
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:09,360
neighboring areas you start getting
 

3723
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,669
neighboring areas you start getting
representations of things like oriented

3724
01:11:11,669 --> 01:11:11,679
representations of things like oriented
 

3725
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:13,669
representations of things like oriented
lines so there's a neuron that responds

3726
01:11:13,669 --> 01:11:13,679
lines so there's a neuron that responds
 

3727
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:16,350
lines so there's a neuron that responds
to this angle of my hand versus vertical

3728
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:16,360
to this angle of my hand versus vertical

color and that's how the visual system

3740
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:30,480
color and that's how the visual system
 

3741
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,070
color and that's how the visual system
is organized all the way up to the

01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:32,080
is organized all the way up to the
 

3743
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,870
is organized all the way up to the
cortex so it's hierarchical you don't

3744
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:34,880
cortex so it's hierarchical you don't
 

3745
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:36,070
cortex so it's hierarchical you don't
build I want to be clear it's

build I want to be clear it's
 

3747
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:37,590
build I want to be clear it's
hierarchical because you don't build up

3748
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:37,600
hierarchical because you don't build up

01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,310
hierarchical because you don't build up
that line by suddenly having a neuron

3750
01:11:39,310 --> 01:11:39,320
that line by suddenly having a neuron
 

3751
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:41,910
that line by suddenly having a neuron
that responds to lines in a some random

3752
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:41,920
that responds to lines in a some random
 

3753
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:44,030
that responds to lines in a some random
way it responds to Lines by taking all

3754
01:11:44,030 --> 01:11:44,040
way it responds to Lines by taking all
 

3755
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:45,910
way it responds to Lines by taking all
the dots that are aligned in a vertical

3756
01:11:45,910 --> 01:11:45,920
the dots that are aligned in a vertical
 

3757
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:48,189
the dots that are aligned in a vertical
stack and they all converge on one

3758
01:11:48,189 --> 01:11:48,199
stack and they all converge on one
 

3759
01:11:48,199 --> 01:11:50,229
stack and they all converge on one
neuron and then that neuron response to

3760
01:11:50,229 --> 01:11:50,239
neuron and then that neuron response to
 

3761
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:52,790
neuron and then that neuron response to
vertical lines so it's not random

3762
01:11:52,790 --> 01:11:52,800
vertical lines so it's not random
 

3763
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,750
vertical lines so it's not random
there's no abstraction at that point in

3773
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:05,149
representation of that black line as a

01:12:05,149 --> 01:12:05,159
vertical line somewhere in in your
 

3775
01:12:05,159 --> 01:12:08,669
vertical line somewhere in in your
cortex so at that point uh it's

3776
01:12:08,669 --> 01:12:08,679
cortex so at that point uh it's
 

3777
01:12:08,679 --> 01:12:11,590

absolutely concrete it's not abstract

3778
01:12:11,590 --> 01:12:11,600
absolutely concrete it's not abstract
 

3779
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,470
absolutely concrete it's not abstract

and turns out Nancy was right um they

3842
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:23,920
and turns out Nancy was right um they
 

3843
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,830
and turns out Nancy was right um they
used the stimula called called grible

3844
01:13:25,830 --> 01:13:25,840
used the stimula called called grible
 

3845
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,030
used the stimula called called grible
stimuli which um any computer programmer

3846
01:13:28,030 --> 01:13:28,040
stimuli which um any computer programmer
 

3847
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:29,590
stimuli which um any computer programmer
would appreciate which kind of morphs a

3848
01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:29,600
would appreciate which kind of morphs a
 

3849
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,629
would appreciate which kind of morphs a
face into something gradually that

01:13:31,629 --> 01:13:31,639
face into something gradually that
 

3851
01:13:31,639 --> 01:13:33,229
face into something gradually that
eventually just looks like this like

3852
01:13:33,229 --> 01:13:33,239
eventually just looks like this like
 

3853
01:13:33,239 --> 01:13:35,270
eventually just looks like this like
alien thing they call the gal and the

01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:35,280
alien thing they call the gal and the
 

3855
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:38,229
alien thing they call the gal and the
neurons don't respond to grebles in most

3856
01:13:38,229 --> 01:13:38,239
neurons don't respond to grebles in most
 

3857
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:40,390
neurons don't respond to grebles in most
cases they only respond to faces and

3858
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:40,400
cases they only respond to faces and
 

3859
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,310
cases they only respond to faces and
familiar faces anyway I'm summarizing a

3860
01:13:42,310 --> 01:13:42,320
familiar faces anyway I'm summarizing a
 

3861
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:43,830
familiar faces anyway I'm summarizing a
lot of literature and forgive me Nancy

3862
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:43,840
lot of literature and forgive me Nancy
 

3863
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,790
lot of literature and forgive me Nancy
and for those of the gbo people if there

3864
01:13:45,790 --> 01:13:45,800
and for those of the gbo people if there
 

3865
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,750
and for those of the gbo people if there
ours they like don't come after me with

3866
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:47,760
ours they like don't come after me with
 

3867
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,350
ours they like don't come after me with
pitchforks actually you know what come

3868
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:49,360
pitchforks actually you know what come
 

3869
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,070
pitchforks actually you know what come
out fors I think you know what I'm

3870
01:13:51,070 --> 01:13:51,080
out fors I think you know what I'm
 

3871
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:53,110
out fors I think you know what I'm
trying to do here yeah so the point is

3872
01:13:53,110 --> 01:13:53,120
trying to do here yeah so the point is
 

3873
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,310
trying to do here yeah so the point is
that in the visual system it's very

3874
01:13:55,310 --> 01:13:55,320
that in the visual system it's very
 

3875
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:58,750
that in the visual system it's very
concrete up until about visual area 4

3876
01:13:58,750 --> 01:13:58,760
concrete up until about visual area 4
 

3877
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,750
concrete up until about visual area 4
which has color pin wheels and seems to

3878
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:00,760
which has color pin wheels and seems to
 

3879
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:03,669
which has color pin wheels and seems to
respond to pin wheels of colors and um

3880
01:14:03,669 --> 01:14:03,679
respond to pin wheels of colors and um
 

3881
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:05,229
respond to pin wheels of colors and um
and so the stimula become more and more

3882
01:14:05,229 --> 01:14:05,239
and so the stimula become more and more
 

3883

01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,669
little bit of insulation on it you plug
it into an audio monitor it's picking up

4042
01:17:10,669 --> 01:17:10,679
it into an audio monitor it's picking up
 

4043
01:17:10,679 --> 01:17:13,430
it into an audio monitor it's picking up
electricity and if it's a visual neuron

4044
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:13,440
electricity and if it's a visual neuron
 

4045
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:14,990
electricity and if it's a visual neuron
and it's in the thalamus of the retina

4046
01:17:14,990 --> 01:17:15,000
and it's in the thalamus of the retina
 

4047
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,189
and it's in the thalamus of the retina
and you walk in front of that animal or

4048
01:17:17,189 --> 01:17:17,199
and you walk in front of that animal or
 

4049
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:19,950
and you walk in front of that animal or
person that that neuron

person that that neuron
 

4051
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:22,990
person that that neuron
goes and then you walk away and it stops

4052
01:17:22,990 --> 01:17:23,000
goes and then you walk away and it stops
 

4053
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,590
goes and then you walk away and it stops
and you put your hand in front of the

01:17:26,110 --> 01:17:26,120
eye again and it
 

4057
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:29,709
eye again and it
goes and you could do that for two days

4058
01:17:29,709 --> 01:17:29,719
goes and you could do that for two days
 

4059
01:17:29,719 --> 01:17:31,350
goes and you could do that for two days
and that neuron will just every time

01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:31,360
and that neuron will just every time
 

4061
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:33,550
and that neuron will just every time
there's a stimulus it fires so whereas

then these abstractions happening where

4068
01:17:38,790 --> 01:17:38,800
then these abstractions happening where
 

4069
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:41,629
then these abstractions happening where
you're creating these ideas when you go

you're creating these ideas when you go
subcortical everything is there's no

01:18:00,070 --> 01:18:00,080
paid to say that and I have no you know

but my question was to some of them you
 

4095
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:07,750
but my question was to some of them you
know when are you going to go

01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:07,760
know when are you going to go
 

4097
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,229
know when are you going to go
subcortical because if you want to

01:18:09,229 --> 01:18:09,239
subcortical because if you want to
 

4099
01:18:09,239 --> 01:18:11,629
subcortical because if you want to
control an animal you don't do it in the

4147
01:18:59,639 --> 01:19:01,750
stimulating the subthalamic nucleus
because we know that it Gates motor

interested in Neuroscience it pays to
 

4155
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:10,310
interested in Neuroscience it pays to
pay attention to like is this a circuit

4156
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:10,320
pay attention to like is this a circuit
 

4157
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:12,910
pay attention to like is this a circuit
that abstracts the sensory information

4158
01:19:12,910 --> 01:19:12,920
that abstracts the sensory information
 

4159
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:15,550
that abstracts the sensory information
or is it just one that builds up

4160
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:15,560
or is it just one that builds up
 

4161
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:17,030
or is it just one that builds up
hierarchical models in a very

hierarchical models in a very
 

4163
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:19,629
hierarchical models in a very
predictable way and there's a huge chasm

4164
01:19:19,629 --> 01:19:19,639
predictable way and there's a huge chasm
 

4165
01:19:19,639 --> 01:19:22,030
predictable way and there's a huge chasm
in Neuroscience right now because

4166
01:19:22,030 --> 01:19:22,040
in Neuroscience right now because
 

4167
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:24,310
in Neuroscience right now because
there's no conceptual leadership no one

4168
01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:24,320
there's no conceptual leadership no one
 

4169
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:26,430
there's no conceptual leadership no one
knows which way to go and this is why I

4170
01:19:26,430 --> 01:19:26,440
knows which way to go and this is why I
 

4171
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:28,510

think neuralink has captured an amazing

the goal the end point and some academic
 

4183
01:19:37,639 --> 01:19:39,669
the goal the end point and some academic
Laboratories do that but I think that's

Laboratories do that but I think that's
 

4185
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:42,550

that want to do that too of course let's
 

4195
01:19:51,159 --> 01:19:55,110
that want to do that too of course let's
restore um speech to the stroke patient

4196
01:19:55,110 --> 01:19:55,120
restore um speech to the stroke patient
 

4197
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,270
restore um speech to the stroke patient
but there's nothing abstract about that

4198
01:19:57,270 --> 01:19:57,280
but there's nothing abstract about that
 

4199
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,910
but there's nothing abstract about that
that's about figuring out the solution

4200
01:19:58,910 --> 01:19:58,920
that's about figuring out the solution
 

4201
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:00,750
that's about figuring out the solution
to a particular problem so anyway those

4202
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:00,760
to a particular problem so anyway those
 

4203
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:02,790
to a particular problem so anyway those
are my and i' and I admit I've mixed in

4204
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:02,800
are my and i' and I admit I've mixed in
 

4205
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:05,669
are my and i' and I admit I've mixed in
a lot of opinion there but having spent

4206
01:20:05,669 --> 01:20:05,679
a lot of opinion there but having spent
 

4207
01:20:05,679 --> 01:20:07,669
a lot of opinion there but having spent
some time like 25 years digging around

4208
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:07,679
some time like 25 years digging around
 

4209
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,149
some time like 25 years digging around
in the brain and listening to neurons

4210
01:20:09,149 --> 01:20:09,159
in the brain and listening to neurons
 

4211
01:20:09,159 --> 01:20:11,669
in the brain and listening to neurons
firing and looking at them anatomically

01:20:11,669 --> 01:20:11,679
firing and looking at them anatomically
 

4213
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:14,750

I think given it's 2020 we we need to uh

4214
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:14,760
I think given it's 2020 we we need to uh
 

4215
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:16,149
I think given it's 2020 we we need to uh
ask the right you know the way to get

01:20:16,149 --> 01:20:16,159
ask the right you know the way to get
 

4217
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:18,310

better answers is ask better questions

4218
01:20:18,310 --> 01:20:18,320
better answers is ask better questions
 

4219
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:21,669
better answers is ask better questions
and the really high level stuff is fun

4220
01:20:21,669 --> 01:20:21,679
and the really high level stuff is fun

01:20:27,870 --> 01:20:27,880
has um brought enormous interest but I
 

4225
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:29,709
has um brought enormous interest but I
think the questions about Consciousness

4226
01:20:29,709 --> 01:20:29,719
think the questions about Consciousness
 

4227
01:20:29,719 --> 01:20:31,070

and dreaming and stuff they're

4228
01:20:31,070 --> 01:20:31,080
and dreaming and stuff they're
 

4229
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,350
and dreaming and stuff they're
fascinating but I don't know that we're

01:21:17,870 --> 01:21:17,880
Musk said you know basically the brain
 

4267
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:19,830
Musk said you know basically the brain
is a what you say a monkey brain with a

is a what you say a monkey brain with a
 

4269
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,870
is a what you say a monkey brain with a
supercomputer on top and I thought

4270
01:21:21,870 --> 01:21:21,880
supercomputer on top and I thought
 

4271
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:23,390
supercomputer on top and I thought
that's actually probably the best

4272
01:21:23,390 --> 01:21:23,400
that's actually probably the best
 

4273
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:24,990
that's actually probably the best

01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,629

01:21:32,750 --> 01:21:32,760
making plans we're using the prefrontal
 

4283
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:34,910
making plans we're using the prefrontal
cortex and we're executive function and

4284
01:21:34,910 --> 01:21:34,920
cortex and we're executive function and
 

4285
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:36,590
cortex and we're executive function and
all this kind of stuff but think about

4286
01:21:36,590 --> 01:21:36,600
all this kind of stuff but think about
 

4287
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,270
all this kind of stuff but think about
the drug addict who's driven to go

01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:42,790
the drug addict who's driven to go
pursue herin or cocaine they make plans

pursue herin or cocaine they make plans
 

4291
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,669
pursue herin or cocaine they make plans
so clearly they use their frontal cortex

01:21:44,669 --> 01:21:44,679
so clearly they use their frontal cortex
 

4293
01:21:44,679 --> 01:21:46,550
so clearly they use their frontal cortex
it's just that it's been hijacked by the

it's just that it's been hijacked by the

01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,390
it's just that it's been hijacked by the

fair to monkeys though Elon because

fair to monkeys though Elon because
actually monkeys can make plans they

actually monkeys can make plans they

01:21:53,239 --> 01:21:54,790
actually monkeys can make plans they
just don't make plans as sophisticated

want let's say I want to increase my

4348
01:22:36,990 --> 01:22:37,000
want let's say I want to increase my
 

4349
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,310
want let's say I want to increase my
level of focus and creativity well then

4350
01:22:40,310 --> 01:22:40,320
level of focus and creativity well then
 

4351
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:43,149
level of focus and creativity well then
I would love to be able to for instance

4352
01:22:43,149 --> 01:22:43,159
I would love to be able to for instance
 

4353
01:22:43,159 --> 01:22:45,229
I would love to be able to for instance
control my level of lyic friction I

4354
01:22:45,229 --> 01:22:45,239
control my level of lyic friction I
 

4355
01:22:45,239 --> 01:22:46,550
control my level of lyic friction I
would love to be able to wake up and go

4356
01:22:46,550 --> 01:22:46,560
would love to be able to wake up and go
 

4357
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,189
would love to be able to wake up and go
oh you know I have an 8:00 appointment I

4358
01:22:48,189 --> 01:22:48,199
oh you know I have an 8:00 appointment I
 

4359
01:22:48,199 --> 01:22:50,590
oh you know I have an 8:00 appointment I
wake up slowly so between S8 but I want

4360
01:22:50,590 --> 01:22:50,600
wake up slowly so between S8 but I want
 

4361
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:52,110
wake up slowly so between S8 but I want
to do a lot of linear thinking so you

4362
01:22:52,110 --> 01:22:52,120
to do a lot of linear thinking so you
 

4363
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:53,709
to do a lot of linear thinking so you
know what I'm going to just I'm going to

4364
01:22:53,709 --> 01:22:53,719
know what I'm going to just I'm going to
 

4365
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:58,030
know what I'm going to just I'm going to
turn down the limic friction and or ramp

4366
01:22:58,030 --> 01:22:58,040
turn down the limic friction and or ramp
 

4367
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:00,750
turn down the limic friction and or ramp
up prefrontal cortex's Activation so

4368
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:00,760
up prefrontal cortex's Activation so
 

4369
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:01,990
up prefrontal cortex's Activation so
there's a lot of stuff that can happen

4370
01:23:01,990 --> 01:23:02,000
there's a lot of stuff that can happen
 

4371
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,669
there's a lot of stuff that can happen
in the thalamus with sensory gating um

4372
01:23:04,669 --> 01:23:04,679
in the thalamus with sensory gating um
 

4373
01:23:04,679 --> 01:23:05,950
in the thalamus with sensory gating um
for instance you could shut down that

4374
01:23:05,950 --> 01:23:05,960
for instance you could shut down that
 

4375
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:08,430
for instance you could shut down that
shell around the thalamus and allow more

4376
01:23:08,430 --> 01:23:08,440
shell around the thalamus and allow more
 

4377
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:10,030
shell around the thalamus and allow more
creative thinking by allowing more

4378
01:23:10,030 --> 01:23:10,040
creative thinking by allowing more
 

4379
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:11,870
creative thinking by allowing more
lateral connections these would be some

4380
01:23:11,870 --> 01:23:11,880
lateral connections these would be some
 

4381
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:13,350
lateral connections these would be some
of the those would be the experiments

4382
01:23:13,350 --> 01:23:13,360
of the those would be the experiments
 

4383
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:14,870
of the those would be the experiments
I'd want to do so they're in the

4384
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:14,880
I'd want to do so they're in the
 

4385
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:17,470
I'd want to do so they're in the
subcortical quote unquote monkey brain

01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:17,480
subcortical quote unquote monkey brain
 

4387
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:19,550
subcortical quote unquote monkey brain
but you could then look at what sorts of

4388
01:23:19,550 --> 01:23:19,560
but you could then look at what sorts of
 

4389
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:21,910
but you could then look at what sorts of
abstract thoughts and behaviors would

4390
01:23:21,910 --> 01:23:21,920
abstract thoughts and behaviors would
 

4391
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:25,350
abstract thoughts and behaviors would
arise from that rather than and and here

4392
01:23:25,350 --> 01:23:25,360
arise from that rather than and and here
 

4393
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:26,709
arise from that rather than and and here
I'm not pointing my finger at neural

4394
01:23:26,709 --> 01:23:26,719
I'm not pointing my finger at neural
 

4395
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:28,590
I'm not pointing my finger at neural
Link at all but there's this obsession

4396
01:23:28,590 --> 01:23:28,600
Link at all but there's this obsession
 

4397
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:32,030
Link at all but there's this obsession
with neocortex but I I'm going to well I

4398
01:23:32,030 --> 01:23:32,040
with neocortex but I I'm going to well I
 

4399
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:33,350
with neocortex but I I'm going to well I
might lose a few friends but I'll

4400
01:23:33,350 --> 01:23:33,360
might lose a few friends but I'll
 

4401
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:36,510
might lose a few friends but I'll
hopefully gain a few and and also um one

4402
01:23:36,510 --> 01:23:36,520
hopefully gain a few and and also um one
 

4403
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:38,149
hopefully gain a few and and also um one
of the reasons people spend so much time

4404
01:23:38,149 --> 01:23:38,159
of the reasons people spend so much time
 

4405
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:41,910
of the reasons people spend so much time
in neocortex yes I have a fact in an

4406
01:23:41,910 --> 01:23:41,920
in neocortex yes I have a fact in an
 

4407
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:43,870
in neocortex yes I have a fact in an
opinion one fact is that you can image

4408
01:23:43,870 --> 01:23:43,880
opinion one fact is that you can image
 

4409
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:46,149
opinion one fact is that you can image
there and you can record there right now

4410
01:23:46,149 --> 01:23:46,159
there and you can record there right now
 

4411
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:49,270
there and you can record there right now
the two Photon and one Photon microscopy

4412
01:23:49,270 --> 01:23:49,280
the two Photon and one Photon microscopy
 

4413
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:50,550
the two Photon and one Photon microscopy
methods that allow you to image deep

4414
01:23:50,550 --> 01:23:50,560
methods that allow you to image deep
 

4415
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:52,629
methods that allow you to image deep
into the brain still don't allow you to

4416
01:23:52,629 --> 01:23:52,639
into the brain still don't allow you to
 

4417
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:54,390
into the brain still don't allow you to
image down really deep unless you're

4418
01:23:54,390 --> 01:23:54,400
image down really deep unless you're
 

4419
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,590
image down really deep unless you're
jamming prisms in there and endoscopes

4420
01:23:56,590 --> 01:23:56,600
jamming prisms in there and endoscopes
 

4421
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:57,910
jamming prisms in there and endoscopes
and then in the endoscopes are very

4422
01:23:57,910 --> 01:23:57,920
and then in the endoscopes are very
 

4423
01:23:57,920 --> 01:23:59,310
and then in the endoscopes are very
narrow so you're getting very you know

4424
01:23:59,310 --> 01:23:59,320
narrow so you're getting very you know
 

4425
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:00,669
narrow so you're getting very you know
it's like looking at the bottom of the

4426
01:24:00,669 --> 01:24:00,679
it's like looking at the bottom of the
 

4427
01:24:00,679 --> 01:24:03,470
it's like looking at the bottom of the
ocean through a through a spotlight yeah

4428
01:24:03,470 --> 01:24:03,480
ocean through a through a spotlight yeah
 

4429
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:05,110
ocean through a through a spotlight yeah
and so you much easier look at the waves

4430
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:05,120
and so you much easier look at the waves
 

4431
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:08,550
and so you much easier look at the waves
up on top right so let's face it folks a

4432
01:24:08,550 --> 01:24:08,560
up on top right so let's face it folks a
 

4433
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:09,870
up on top right so let's face it folks a
lot of the reasons why there's so many

4434
01:24:09,870 --> 01:24:09,880
lot of the reasons why there's so many
 

4435
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:11,830
lot of the reasons why there's so many
recordings in layer 2 three of Cortex

4436
01:24:11,830 --> 01:24:11,840
recordings in layer 2 three of Cortex
 

4437
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:13,550
recordings in layer 2 three of Cortex
with all this Advanced microscopy is

4438
01:24:13,550 --> 01:24:13,560
with all this Advanced microscopy is
 

4439
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:15,910
with all this Advanced microscopy is
because it's very hard to image deeper

4440
01:24:15,910 --> 01:24:15,920
because it's very hard to image deeper
 

4441
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:18,550
because it's very hard to image deeper
now the microscopes are getting better

4442
01:24:18,550 --> 01:24:18,560
now the microscopes are getting better
 

4443
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,510
now the microscopes are getting better
and thanks to amazing work mainly of

4444
01:24:20,510 --> 01:24:20,520
and thanks to amazing work mainly of

Engineers and chemists and physicists
 

4447
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:23,430
Engineers and chemists and physicists
let's face it they're the ones who

4448
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:23,440
let's face it they're the ones who
 

4449
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:25,110
let's face it they're the ones who
brought this revolution in Neuroscience

4450
01:24:25,110 --> 01:24:25,120
brought this revolution in Neuroscience
 

4451
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,709
brought this revolution in Neuroscience
in the last 10 years or so you can image

4452
01:24:27,709 --> 01:24:27,719
in the last 10 years or so you can image
 

4453
01:24:27,719 --> 01:24:30,790
in the last 10 years or so you can image
deeper but we don't really that's why

4454
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:30,800
deeper but we don't really that's why
 

4455
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,390
deeper but we don't really that's why
you see so many reports on layer 2 three

4456
01:24:33,390 --> 01:24:33,400
you see so many reports on layer 2 three
 

4457
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:35,310
you see so many reports on layer 2 three
the other thing which is purely opinion

4458
01:24:35,310 --> 01:24:35,320
the other thing which is purely opinion
 

4459
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:37,510
the other thing which is purely opinion
and I'm not going after anybody here but

4460
01:24:37,510 --> 01:24:37,520
and I'm not going after anybody here but
 

4461
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:39,990
and I'm not going after anybody here but
is that as long as there's no clear

4462
01:24:39,990 --> 01:24:40,000
is that as long as there's no clear
 

4463
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,629
is that as long as there's no clear
right answer it becomes a little easier

4464
01:24:42,629 --> 01:24:42,639
right answer it becomes a little easier
 

4465
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:45,109
right answer it becomes a little easier
to do creative work in a structure where

4466
01:24:45,109 --> 01:24:45,119
to do creative work in a structure where
 

4467
01:24:45,119 --> 01:24:47,149
to do creative work in a structure where
no one really knows how it works so it's

4468
01:24:47,149 --> 01:24:47,159
no one really knows how it works so it's
 

4469
01:24:47,159 --> 01:24:48,790
no one really knows how it works so it's
fun to probe around because anything you

4470
01:24:48,790 --> 01:24:48,800
fun to probe around because anything you
 

4471
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:51,030
fun to probe around because anything you
see is novel if you're going to work in

4472
01:24:51,030 --> 01:24:51,040
see is novel if you're going to work in
 

4473
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:53,550
see is novel if you're going to work in
the thalamus or the pulvinar or the

4474
01:24:53,550 --> 01:24:53,560
the thalamus or the pulvinar or the
 

4475
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:55,189
the thalamus or the pulvinar or the
hypothalamus so these structures that

4476
01:24:55,189 --> 01:24:55,199
hypothalamus so these structures that
 

4477
01:24:55,199 --> 01:24:56,790
hypothalamus so these structures that
have been known about since the' 60s and

4478
01:24:56,790 --> 01:24:56,800
have been known about since the' 60s and
 

4479
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,510
have been known about since the' 60s and
70s and really since the you know

4480
01:24:58,510 --> 01:24:58,520
70s and really since the you know
 

4481
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:01,910
70s and really since the you know
centuries ago you are dealing with exist

4482
01:25:01,910 --> 01:25:01,920
centuries ago you are dealing with exist
 

4483
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:04,910
centuries ago you are dealing with exist
you have to combat existing models yeah

4484
01:25:04,910 --> 01:25:04,920
you have to combat existing models yeah
 

4485
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:06,790
you have to combat existing models yeah
and where whereas in cortex no one knows

4486
01:25:06,790 --> 01:25:06,800
and where whereas in cortex no one knows
 

4487
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:09,470
and where whereas in cortex no one knows
how the thing works the neocortex six

4488
01:25:09,470 --> 01:25:09,480
how the thing works the neocortex six
 

4489
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:12,470
how the thing works the neocortex six
layer cortex and so L more room for

4490
01:25:12,470 --> 01:25:12,480
layer cortex and so L more room for
 

4491
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,350
layer cortex and so L more room for
Discovery there's a lot more room for

4492
01:25:14,350 --> 01:25:14,360
Discovery there's a lot more room for
 

4493
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:15,629
Discovery there's a lot more room for
Discovery and I'm not calling anyone out

4494
01:25:15,629 --> 01:25:15,639
Discovery and I'm not calling anyone out
 

4495
01:25:15,639 --> 01:25:16,910
Discovery and I'm not calling anyone out
I love cortex we've published some

4496
01:25:16,910 --> 01:25:16,920
I love cortex we've published some
 

4497
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:19,270
I love cortex we've published some
papers on cortex it's super interesting

4498
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:19,280
papers on cortex it's super interesting
 

4499
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,669
papers on cortex it's super interesting
but I I think with the tools that are

4500
01:25:21,669 --> 01:25:21,679
but I I think with the tools that are
 

4501
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:24,310
but I I think with the tools that are
available nowadays and where people are

4502
01:25:24,310 --> 01:25:24,320
available nowadays and where people are
 

4503
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:26,669
available nowadays and where people are
trying ahead of of not just reading from

4504
01:25:26,669 --> 01:25:26,679
trying ahead of of not just reading from
 

4505
01:25:26,679 --> 01:25:28,030
trying ahead of of not just reading from
the Brain Monitoring activity but

4506
01:25:28,030 --> 01:25:28,040
the Brain Monitoring activity but
 

4507
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:29,910
the Brain Monitoring activity but
writing to the brain I think we really

4508
01:25:29,910 --> 01:25:29,920
writing to the brain I think we really
 

4509
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:31,470
writing to the brain I think we really
have to be careful and we need to be

4510
01:25:31,470 --> 01:25:31,480
have to be careful and we need to be
 

4511
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:34,510
have to be careful and we need to be
thoughtful about what are we trying to

4512
01:25:34,510 --> 01:25:34,520
thoughtful about what are we trying to
 

4513
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:36,270
thoughtful about what are we trying to
write what script are we trying to write

4514
01:25:36,270 --> 01:25:36,280
write what script are we trying to write
 

4515
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:37,590
write what script are we trying to write
because there are many brain structures

4516
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:37,600
because there are many brain structures
 

4517
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,629
because there are many brain structures
for which we already know what scripts

4518
01:25:39,629 --> 01:25:39,639
for which we already know what scripts
 

4519
01:25:39,639 --> 01:25:40,550
for which we already know what scripts
they write and I think there's

4520
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:40,560
they write and I think there's
 

4521
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,030
they write and I think there's
tremendous value there I don't think

4522
01:25:42,030 --> 01:25:42,040
tremendous value there I don't think
 

4523
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:44,229
tremendous value there I don't think
it's boring the fact that they act like

4524
01:25:44,229 --> 01:25:44,239
it's boring the fact that they act like
 

4525
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:46,030
it's boring the fact that they act like
machines makes them predictable those

4526
01:25:46,030 --> 01:25:46,040
machines makes them predictable those
 

4527
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:48,470
machines makes them predictable those
are your zeros and ones yeah let's start

4528
01:25:48,470 --> 01:25:48,480
are your zeros and ones yeah let's start
 

4529
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,430
are your zeros and ones yeah let's start
there but let what they're what's sort

4530
01:25:50,430 --> 01:25:50,440
there but let what they're what's sort
 

4531
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:52,310
there but let what they're what's sort
of happening in this field of writing to

4532
01:25:52,310 --> 01:25:52,320
of happening in this field of writing to
 

4533
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,510
of happening in this field of writing to
the brain is there's this idea and again

4534
01:25:54,510 --> 01:25:54,520
the brain is there's this idea and again
 

4535
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:55,590
the brain is there's this idea and again
I want to be clear I'm not pointing at

4536
01:25:55,590 --> 01:25:55,600
I want to be clear I'm not pointing at
 

4537
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,910
I want to be clear I'm not pointing at
neuralink I'm mainly pointing at the the

4538
01:25:57,910 --> 01:25:57,920
neuralink I'm mainly pointing at the the
 

4539
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:01,149
neuralink I'm mainly pointing at the the
neocortical jockeys out there that you

4540
01:26:01,149 --> 01:26:01,159
neocortical jockeys out there that you
 

4541
01:26:01,159 --> 01:26:03,270
neocortical jockeys out there that you
go and you observe patterns and then you

4542
01:26:03,270 --> 01:26:03,280
go and you observe patterns and then you
 

4543
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:04,750
go and you observe patterns and then you
think replaying those patterns is going

4544
01:26:04,750 --> 01:26:04,760
think replaying those patterns is going
 

4545
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:07,109
think replaying those patterns is going
to give rise to something interesting

4546
01:26:07,109 --> 01:26:07,119
to give rise to something interesting
 

4547
01:26:07,119 --> 01:26:09,470
to give rise to something interesting
yeah I I should call out one experiment

4548
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:09,480
yeah I I should call out one experiment
 

4549
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:10,950
yeah I I should call out one experiment
or two experiments which were done by

4550
01:26:10,950 --> 01:26:10,960
or two experiments which were done by
 

4551
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:13,629
or two experiments which were done by
susumu tagawa Nobel Prize winner from

4552
01:26:13,629 --> 01:26:13,639
susumu tagawa Nobel Prize winner from
 

4553
01:26:13,639 --> 01:26:16,189
susumu tagawa Nobel Prize winner from
MIT done important work in memory and

4554
01:26:16,189 --> 01:26:16,199
MIT done important work in memory and
 

4555
01:26:16,199 --> 01:26:17,709
MIT done important work in memory and
Immunology of course is where you got

4556
01:26:17,709 --> 01:26:17,719
Immunology of course is where you got
 

4557
01:26:17,719 --> 01:26:20,750

Nobel as well as Mark morford's Lab at

4558
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:20,760
Nobel as well as Mark morford's Lab at
 

4559
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:22,669
Nobel as well as Mark morford's Lab at
UC San Diego they did an experiment

4560
01:26:22,669 --> 01:26:22,679
UC San Diego they did an experiment
 

4561
01:26:22,679 --> 01:26:24,470
UC San Diego they did an experiment
where they monitored a bunch of neurons

4562
01:26:24,470 --> 01:26:24,480
where they monitored a bunch of neurons
 

4563
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,910
where they monitored a bunch of neurons
while an animal learns something MH then

4564
01:26:26,910 --> 01:26:26,920
while an animal learns something MH then
 

4565
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:28,669
while an animal learns something MH then
they captur those neurons through some

4566
01:26:28,669 --> 01:26:28,679
they captur those neurons through some
 

4567
01:26:28,679 --> 01:26:30,790
they captur those neurons through some
molecular tricks so they could replay

4568
01:26:30,790 --> 01:26:30,800
molecular tricks so they could replay
 

4569
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:33,070
molecular tricks so they could replay
the neurons mhm so now there's like

4570
01:26:33,070 --> 01:26:33,080
the neurons mhm so now there's like
 

4571
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:35,709
the neurons mhm so now there's like
perfect case scenario it's like okay you

4572
01:26:35,709 --> 01:26:35,719
perfect case scenario it's like okay you
 

4573
01:26:35,719 --> 01:26:38,109
perfect case scenario it's like okay you
monitor the neurons in your brain then I

4574
01:26:38,109 --> 01:26:38,119
monitor the neurons in your brain then I
 

4575
01:26:38,119 --> 01:26:39,830
monitor the neurons in your brain then I
say okay neurons 1 through 100 were

4576
01:26:39,830 --> 01:26:39,840
say okay neurons 1 through 100 were
 

4577
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:41,470
say okay neurons 1 through 100 were
played in the particular sequence so you

4578
01:26:41,470 --> 01:26:41,480
played in the particular sequence so you
 

4579
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:42,990
played in the particular sequence so you
know the space time you know the keys on

4580
01:26:42,990 --> 01:26:43,000
know the space time you know the keys on
 

4581
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,229
know the space time you know the keys on
the piano that were played that gave

4582
01:26:44,229 --> 01:26:44,239
the piano that were played that gave
 

4583
01:26:44,239 --> 01:26:46,669
the piano that were played that gave
rise to the song which was the behavior

4584
01:26:46,669 --> 01:26:46,679
rise to the song which was the behavior
 

4585
01:26:46,679 --> 01:26:48,390
rise to the song which was the behavior
and then you go back and you reactivate

4586
01:26:48,390 --> 01:26:48,400
and then you go back and you reactivate
 

4587
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:50,669
and then you go back and you reactivate
those neurons except you reactivate them

4588
01:26:50,669 --> 01:26:50,679
those neurons except you reactivate them
 

4589
01:26:50,679 --> 01:26:52,629
those neurons except you reactivate them
all at once like slamming on all the

4590
01:26:52,629 --> 01:26:52,639
all at once like slamming on all the
 

4591
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:55,189
all at once like slamming on all the
keys once on the piano and you get the

4592
01:26:55,189 --> 01:26:55,199
keys once on the piano and you get the
 

4593
01:26:55,199 --> 01:26:57,790
keys once on the piano and you get the
exact same

4594
01:26:57,790 --> 01:26:57,800
exact same
 

4595
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:00,790
exact same
behavior so the SpaceTime

4596
01:27:00,790 --> 01:27:00,800
behavior so the SpaceTime
 

4597
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,990
behavior so the SpaceTime
code may be meaningless for some

4598
01:27:03,990 --> 01:27:04,000
code may be meaningless for some
 

4599
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,390
code may be meaningless for some
structures now that's freaky that's a

4600
01:27:07,390 --> 01:27:07,400
structures now that's freaky that's a
 

4601
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:09,950
structures now that's freaky that's a
scary thing because what that means is

4602
01:27:09,950 --> 01:27:09,960
scary thing because what that means is
 

4603
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:13,189
scary thing because what that means is
that all the space-time firing in

4604
01:27:13,189 --> 01:27:13,199
that all the space-time firing in
 

4605
01:27:13,199 --> 01:27:16,629
that all the space-time firing in
cortex the space part May matter more

4606
01:27:16,629 --> 01:27:16,639
cortex the space part May matter more
 

4607
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:18,669
cortex the space part May matter more
than the time part so you know rate

4608
01:27:18,669 --> 01:27:18,679
than the time part so you know rate
 

4609
01:27:18,679 --> 01:27:22,189
than the time part so you know rate
codes and SpaceTime codes we don't know

4610
01:27:22,189 --> 01:27:22,199
codes and SpaceTime codes we don't know
 

4611
01:27:22,199 --> 01:27:23,669
codes and SpaceTime codes we don't know
and you know I'd rather have I'd rather

4612
01:27:23,669 --> 01:27:23,679
and you know I'd rather have I'd rather
 

4613
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:25,750
and you know I'd rather have I'd rather
deliver more answers in this discussion

4614
01:27:25,750 --> 01:27:25,760
deliver more answers in this discussion
 

4615
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:28,030
deliver more answers in this discussion
questions but I think it's an important

4616
01:27:28,030 --> 01:27:28,040
questions but I think it's an important
 

4617
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:29,790
questions but I think it's an important
consideration you're saying some of the

4618
01:27:29,790 --> 01:27:29,800
consideration you're saying some of the
 

4619
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:31,950
consideration you're saying some of the
magic is in the early stages of what the

4620
01:27:31,950 --> 01:27:31,960
magic is in the early stages of what the
 

4621
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:34,990
magic is in the early stages of what the
the closer to the raw information that

4622
01:27:34,990 --> 01:27:35,000
the closer to the raw information that
 

4623
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,510
the closer to the raw information that
bra ising I believe so you you know the

4624
01:27:37,510 --> 01:27:37,520
bra ising I believe so you you know the
 

4625
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:39,669
bra ising I believe so you you know the
stimulus you know the neuron then codes

4626
01:27:39,669 --> 01:27:39,679
stimulus you know the neuron then codes
 

4627
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:40,910
stimulus you know the neuron then codes
that stimulus so you know the

4628
01:27:40,910 --> 01:27:40,920
that stimulus so you know the
 

4629
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:43,350
that stimulus so you know the
transformation when I say this for those

4630
01:27:43,350 --> 01:27:43,360
transformation when I say this for those
 

4631
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,629
transformation when I say this for those
you that don't think about sensory

4632
01:27:44,629 --> 01:27:44,639
you that don't think about sensory
 

4633
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:46,350
you that don't think about sensory
Transformations it's like I can show you

4634
01:27:46,350 --> 01:27:46,360
Transformations it's like I can show you
 

4635
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:49,470
Transformations it's like I can show you
a red um Circle and then I look at how

4636
01:27:49,470 --> 01:27:49,480
a red um Circle and then I look at how
 

4637
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:51,390
a red um Circle and then I look at how
many U times the neuron fires in

4638
01:27:51,390 --> 01:27:51,400
many U times the neuron fires in
 

4639
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:53,550
many U times the neuron fires in
response to that red circle and then I

4640
01:27:53,550 --> 01:27:53,560
response to that red circle and then I
 

4641
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:54,750
response to that red circle and then I
show the red circle a bunch of times

4642
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:54,760
show the red circle a bunch of times
 

4643
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:56,510
show the red circle a bunch of times
green circle see if it changes and then

4644
01:27:56,510 --> 01:27:56,520
green circle see if it changes and then
 

4645
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:58,390
green circle see if it changes and then
essentially the number of time that is

4646
01:27:58,390 --> 01:27:58,400
essentially the number of time that is
 

4647
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:00,109
essentially the number of time that is
the the transformation you've converted

4648
01:28:00,109 --> 01:28:00,119
the the transformation you've converted
 

4649
01:28:00,119 --> 01:28:02,070
the the transformation you've converted
red circle into like three Action

4650
01:28:02,070 --> 01:28:02,080
red circle into like three Action
 

4651
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:04,189
red circle into like three Action
potentials you know beep beep or

4652
01:28:04,189 --> 01:28:04,199

01:30:59,189 --> 01:30:59,199
doesn't extend over very long periods of
 

4809
01:30:59,199 --> 01:31:01,189
doesn't extend over very long periods of
time the same way that you and I can

4810
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:01,199
time the same way that you and I can
 

4811
01:31:01,199 --> 01:31:03,149
time the same way that you and I can
both read a book or you can recommend

4812
01:31:03,149 --> 01:31:03,159
both read a book or you can recommend
 

4813
01:31:03,159 --> 01:31:04,109
both read a book or you can recommend
something to me and then we could

4814
01:31:04,109 --> 01:31:04,119
something to me and then we could
 

4815
01:31:04,119 --> 01:31:07,590
something to me and then we could
Converge on a set of ideas later and uh

4816
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:07,600
Converge on a set of ideas later and uh
 

4817
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,390
Converge on a set of ideas later and uh
In fairness because she was the one that

4818
01:31:09,390 --> 01:31:09,400
In fairness because she was the one that
 

4819
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:10,950
In fairness because she was the one that
said it and I didn't and I hadn't even

4820
01:31:10,950 --> 01:31:10,960
said it and I didn't and I hadn't even
 

4821
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:13,709
said it and I didn't and I hadn't even
thought of it um when you talked to Lisa

4822
01:31:13,709 --> 01:31:13,719
thought of it um when you talked to Lisa
 

4823
01:31:13,719 --> 01:31:16,950
thought of it um when you talked to Lisa
on your podcast she brought up something

4824
01:31:16,950 --> 01:31:16,960
on your podcast she brought up something
 

4825
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:19,430
on your podcast she brought up something
beautiful which is that I never really

4826
01:31:19,430 --> 01:31:19,440
beautiful which is that I never really
 

4827
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:20,629
beautiful which is that I never really
occurred to me and I was sort of

4828
01:31:20,629 --> 01:31:20,639
occurred to me and I was sort of
 

4829
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:22,149
occurred to me and I was sort of
embarrassed that it hadn't but it's

4830
01:31:22,149 --> 01:31:22,159
embarrassed that it hadn't but it's
 

4831
01:31:22,159 --> 01:31:25,070
embarrassed that it hadn't but it's
really beautiful it and Brilliant which

4832
01:31:25,070 --> 01:31:25,080
really beautiful it and Brilliant which
 

4833
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:27,910
really beautiful it and Brilliant which
is that you know we don't just encode

4834
01:31:27,910 --> 01:31:27,920
is that you know we don't just encode
 

4835
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:29,510
is that you know we don't just encode
senses in the form of like color and

4836
01:31:29,510 --> 01:31:29,520
senses in the form of like color and
 

4837
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:31,189
senses in the form of like color and
light and sound waves and taste but

4838
01:31:31,189 --> 01:31:31,199
light and sound waves and taste but
 

4839
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:34,270
light and sound waves and taste but
ideas become a form of sensory mapping

4840
01:31:34,270 --> 01:31:34,280
ideas become a form of sensory mapping
 

4841
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:36,590
ideas become a form of sensory mapping
and that's where the cool you know the

4842
01:31:36,590 --> 01:31:36,600
and that's where the cool you know the
 

4843
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:38,430
and that's where the cool you know the
really really cool and exciting stuff is

4844
01:31:38,430 --> 01:31:38,440
really really cool and exciting stuff is
 

4845
01:31:38,440 --> 01:31:39,550
really really cool and exciting stuff is
but we just don't understand what the

4846
01:31:39,550 --> 01:31:39,560
but we just don't understand what the
 

4847
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:41,550
but we just don't understand what the
receptive fields are for ideas what's an

4848
01:31:41,550 --> 01:31:41,560
receptive fields are for ideas what's an
 

4849
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:45,430
receptive fields are for ideas what's an
idea receptive field and how they're

4850
01:31:45,430 --> 01:31:45,440
idea receptive field and how they're
 

4851
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:47,790
idea receptive field and how they're
communicated between humans because we

4852
01:31:47,790 --> 01:31:47,800
communicated between humans because we
 

4853
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:50,430
communicated between humans because we
seem to be U to be able to encode those

4854
01:31:50,430 --> 01:31:50,440
seem to be U to be able to encode those
 

4855
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:53,109
seem to be U to be able to encode those
ideas in some kind of way it's yes it's

4856
01:31:53,109 --> 01:31:53,119
ideas in some kind of way it's yes it's
 

4857
01:31:53,119 --> 01:31:54,990
ideas in some kind of way it's yes it's
taking all the wrong information and the

4858
01:31:54,990 --> 01:31:55,000
taking all the wrong information and the
 

4859
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,270
taking all the wrong information and the
internal physical States the the that

4860
01:31:57,270 --> 01:31:57,280
internal physical States the the that
 

4861
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:59,669
internal physical States the the that
sensory information put into this

4862
01:31:59,669 --> 01:31:59,679
sensory information put into this
 

4863
01:31:59,679 --> 01:32:02,030
sensory information put into this
concept blob that we in a store and then

4864
01:32:02,030 --> 01:32:02,040
concept blob that we in a store and then
 

4865
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:03,910
concept blob that we in a store and then
we're able to communicate that yeah your

4866
01:32:03,910 --> 01:32:03,920
we're able to communicate that yeah your
 

4867
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:05,629
we're able to communicate that yeah your
abstractions are different than mine I

4868
01:32:05,629 --> 01:32:05,639
abstractions are different than mine I
 

4869
01:32:05,639 --> 01:32:07,229
abstractions are different than mine I
actually think the comment section you

4870
01:32:07,229 --> 01:32:07,239
actually think the comment section you
 

4871
01:32:07,239 --> 01:32:10,270
actually think the comment section you
know on on social media is a beautiful

4872
01:32:10,270 --> 01:32:10,280
know on on social media is a beautiful
 

4873
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:12,629
know on on social media is a beautiful
example of where the abstractions are

4874
01:32:12,629 --> 01:32:12,639
example of where the abstractions are
 

4875
01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:14,510
example of where the abstractions are
different for different people so much

4876
01:32:14,510 --> 01:32:14,520
different for different people so much
 

4877
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:16,470
different for different people so much
of the misunderstanding of the world

4878
01:32:16,470 --> 01:32:16,480
of the misunderstanding of the world
 

4879
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:19,350
of the misunderstanding of the world
yeah is because of these abst these idea

4880
01:32:19,350 --> 01:32:19,360
yeah is because of these abst these idea
 

4881
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:21,590
yeah is because of these abst these idea
receptive Fields they're not the same

4882
01:32:21,590 --> 01:32:21,600
receptive Fields they're not the same
 

4883
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:23,189
receptive Fields they're not the same
whereas I can look at a photo receptor

4884
01:32:23,189 --> 01:32:23,199
whereas I can look at a photo receptor
 

4885
01:32:23,199 --> 01:32:25,270
whereas I can look at a photo receptor
neuron or factoring neuron or a V1

4886
01:32:25,270 --> 01:32:25,280
neuron or factoring neuron or a V1
 

4887
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:27,830
neuron or factoring neuron or a V1
neuron and I am certain I would bet my

4888
01:32:27,830 --> 01:32:27,840
neuron and I am certain I would bet my
 

4889
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:31,470
neuron and I am certain I would bet my
life that yours look and respond exactly

4890
01:32:31,470 --> 01:32:31,480
life that yours look and respond exactly
 

4891
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:34,189
life that yours look and respond exactly
the same way that Lisa's do and mine do

4892
01:32:34,189 --> 01:32:34,199
the same way that Lisa's do and mine do
 

4893
01:32:34,199 --> 01:32:35,590
the same way that Lisa's do and mine do
but once you get Beyond there it gets

4894
01:32:35,590 --> 01:32:35,600
but once you get Beyond there it gets
 

4895
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,830
but once you get Beyond there it gets
tricky and so when you say something or

4896
01:32:37,830 --> 01:32:37,840
tricky and so when you say something or
 

4897
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:40,229
tricky and so when you say something or
I say something and somebody gets upset

4898
01:32:40,229 --> 01:32:40,239
I say something and somebody gets upset
 

4899
01:32:40,239 --> 01:32:43,149
I say something and somebody gets upset
about it or even happy about it their

4900
01:32:43,149 --> 01:32:43,159
about it or even happy about it their
 

4901
01:32:43,159 --> 01:32:45,350
about it or even happy about it their
concept of that might be quite a bit

4902
01:32:45,350 --> 01:32:45,360
concept of that might be quite a bit
 

4903
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:46,709
concept of that might be quite a bit
different they don't really know what

4904
01:32:46,709 --> 01:32:46,719
different they don't really know what
 

4905
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:49,750
different they don't really know what
you mean they only know what it means to

4906
01:32:49,750 --> 01:32:49,760
you mean they only know what it means to
 

4907
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:51,870
you mean they only know what it means to
them yeah so from a neurolink

4908
01:32:51,870 --> 01:32:51,880
them yeah so from a neurolink
 

4909
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:53,870
them yeah so from a neurolink
perspective it makes sense to optimize

4910
01:32:53,870 --> 01:32:53,880
perspective it makes sense to optimize
 

4911
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:57,149
perspective it makes sense to optimize
the control and the augmentation of the

4912
01:32:57,149 --> 01:32:57,159
the control and the augmentation of the
 

4913
01:32:57,159 --> 01:32:58,270
the control and the augmentation of the
of the more

4914
01:32:58,270 --> 01:32:58,280
of the more
 

4915
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:00,990
of the more
primitive uh circuitry so like the the

4916
01:33:00,990 --> 01:33:01,000
primitive uh circuitry so like the the
 

4917
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,149
primitive uh circuitry so like the the
stuff that is closer to the raw sensory

4918
01:33:03,149 --> 01:33:03,159
stuff that is closer to the raw sensory
 

4919
01:33:03,159 --> 01:33:05,830
stuff that is closer to the raw sensory
information go deeper if they I think go

4920
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:05,840
information go deeper if they I think go
 

4921
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:07,709
information go deeper if they I think go
deeper into the brain and I and to be

4922
01:33:07,709 --> 01:33:07,719
deeper into the brain and I and to be
 

4923
01:33:07,719 --> 01:33:10,310
deeper into the brain and I and to be
fair so Matt McDougall um who's a

4924
01:33:10,310 --> 01:33:10,320
fair so Matt McDougall um who's a
 

4925
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,669
fair so Matt McDougall um who's a
neurosurgeon neurolink and also clinical

4926
01:33:12,669 --> 01:33:12,679
neurosurgeon neurolink and also clinical
 

4927
01:33:12,679 --> 01:33:14,669
neurosurgeon neurolink and also clinical
neurosur great guy brilliant they have

4928
01:33:14,669 --> 01:33:14,679
neurosur great guy brilliant they have
 

4929
01:33:14,679 --> 01:33:16,669
neurosur great guy brilliant they have
amazing people I have to give it to them

4930
01:33:16,669 --> 01:33:16,679
amazing people I have to give it to them
 

4931
01:33:16,679 --> 01:33:18,390
amazing people I have to give it to them
they have been very cryptic in recent

4932
01:33:18,390 --> 01:33:18,400
they have been very cryptic in recent
 

4933
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:20,550
they have been very cryptic in recent
years their website was just like a like

4934
01:33:20,550 --> 01:33:20,560
years their website was just like a like
 

4935
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:22,430
years their website was just like a like
neur like nothing there that you know

4936
01:33:22,430 --> 01:33:22,440
neur like nothing there that you know
 

4937
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:23,510
neur like nothing there that you know
they know they really know how to do

4938
01:33:23,510 --> 01:33:23,520
they know they really know how to do
 

4939
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:25,790
they know they really know how to do
things with style and um and they've

4940
01:33:25,790 --> 01:33:25,800
things with style and um and they've
 

4941
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:27,430
things with style and um and they've
upset a lot of people but that's good

4942
01:33:27,430 --> 01:33:27,440
upset a lot of people but that's good
 

4943
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:30,590
upset a lot of people but that's good
too um but Matt is there I know Matt he

4944
01:33:30,590 --> 01:33:30,600
too um but Matt is there I know Matt he
 

4945
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:31,750
too um but Matt is there I know Matt he
actually came up through my lab at

4946
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:31,760
actually came up through my lab at
 

4947
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:32,950
actually came up through my lab at
Stanford although he you know he was a

4948
01:33:32,950 --> 01:33:32,960
Stanford although he you know he was a
 

4949
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:34,709
Stanford although he you know he was a
neurosurgery resum we spent time in our

4950
01:33:34,709 --> 01:33:34,719
neurosurgery resum we spent time in our
 

4951
01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:36,270
neurosurgery resum we spent time in our
lab he actually came out on the shark

4952
01:33:36,270 --> 01:33:36,280
lab he actually came out on the shark
 

4953
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:37,910
lab he actually came out on the shark
dive and did great white shark diving

4954
01:33:37,910 --> 01:33:37,920
dive and did great white shark diving
 

4955
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,629
dive and did great white shark diving
with my lab to collect the VR that we

4956
01:33:39,629 --> 01:33:39,639
with my lab to collect the VR that we
 

4957
01:33:39,639 --> 01:33:41,470
with my lab to collect the VR that we
use in our fear stuff I've talked to

4958
01:33:41,470 --> 01:33:41,480
use in our fear stuff I've talked to
 

4959
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:44,030
use in our fear stuff I've talked to
Matt and I think you know he and other

4960
01:33:44,030 --> 01:33:44,040
Matt and I think you know he and other
 

4961
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:45,750
Matt and I think you know he and other
folks there are hungry for the deeper

4962
01:33:45,750 --> 01:33:45,760
folks there are hungry for the deeper
 

4963
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:48,270
folks there are hungry for the deeper
brain structures the problem is that

4964
01:33:48,270 --> 01:33:48,280
brain structures the problem is that
 

4965
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:50,669
brain structures the problem is that
damn vasculature all that blood supply

4966
01:33:50,669 --> 01:33:50,679
damn vasculature all that blood supply
 

4967
01:33:50,679 --> 01:33:53,189
damn vasculature all that blood supply
it's right it's not trivial to get

4968
01:33:53,189 --> 01:33:53,199
it's right it's not trivial to get
 

4969
01:33:53,199 --> 01:33:55,669
it's right it's not trivial to get
through and down into the brain without

4970
01:33:55,669 --> 01:33:55,679
through and down into the brain without
 

4971
01:33:55,679 --> 01:33:56,910
through and down into the brain without
damaging the vasculature in the

4972
01:33:56,910 --> 01:33:56,920
damaging the vasculature in the
 

4973
01:33:56,920 --> 01:33:59,030
damaging the vasculature in the
neocortex which is on the outer crust

4974
01:33:59,030 --> 01:33:59,040
neocortex which is on the outer crust
 

4975
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:00,149
neocortex which is on the outer crust
but once you start getting into the

4976
01:34:00,149 --> 01:34:00,159
but once you start getting into the
 

4977
01:34:00,159 --> 01:34:01,950
but once you start getting into the
thalamus and closer to some of the main

4978
01:34:01,950 --> 01:34:01,960
thalamus and closer to some of the main
 

4979
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:04,629
thalamus and closer to some of the main
arterial sources you really risk getting

4980
01:34:04,629 --> 01:34:04,639
arterial sources you really risk getting
 

4981
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:07,070
arterial sources you really risk getting
massive bleeds and so it's it's a it's

4982
01:34:07,070 --> 01:34:07,080
massive bleeds and so it's it's a it's
 

4983
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:08,870
massive bleeds and so it's it's a it's
an issue that can be worked out it just

4984
01:34:08,870 --> 01:34:08,880
an issue that can be worked out it just
 

4985
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:12,189
an issue that can be worked out it just
is hard this just maybe be nice to

4986
01:34:12,189 --> 01:34:12,199
is hard this just maybe be nice to
 

4987
01:34:12,199 --> 01:34:14,990
is hard this just maybe be nice to
educate I'm showing my ignorance so the

4988
01:34:14,990 --> 01:34:15,000
educate I'm showing my ignorance so the
 

4989
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,910
educate I'm showing my ignorance so the
the smart stuff is is on the surface so

4990
01:34:17,910 --> 01:34:17,920
the smart stuff is is on the surface so
 

4991
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:20,070
the smart stuff is is on the surface so
I didn't realize this I didn't quite

4992
01:34:20,070 --> 01:34:20,080
I didn't realize this I didn't quite
 

4993
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:22,590
I didn't realize this I didn't quite
realize because you keep saying deep

4994
01:34:22,590 --> 01:34:22,600
realize because you keep saying deep
 

4995
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:26,149
realize because you keep saying deep
yeah so so like the the early stages are

4996
01:34:26,149 --> 01:34:26,159
yeah so so like the the early stages are
 

4997
01:34:26,159 --> 01:34:28,950
yeah so so like the the early stages are
deep yeah in in actually physically in

4998
01:34:28,950 --> 01:34:28,960
deep yeah in in actually physically in
 

4999
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:32,270
deep yeah in in actually physically in
the brain yeah so the way to um you know

5000
01:34:32,270 --> 01:34:32,280
the brain yeah so the way to um you know
 

5001
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:33,990
the brain yeah so the way to um you know
of course you got your your deep brain

5002
01:34:33,990 --> 01:34:34,000
of course you got your your deep brain
 

5003
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,390
of course you got your your deep brain
structures they're involved in breathing

5004
01:34:35,390 --> 01:34:35,400
structures they're involved in breathing
 

5005
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:36,990
structures they're involved in breathing
and heart rate and kind of lizard brain

5006
01:34:36,990 --> 01:34:37,000
and heart rate and kind of lizard brain
 

5007
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,310
and heart rate and kind of lizard brain
stuff and then on top of that this is

5008
01:34:38,310 --> 01:34:38,320
stuff and then on top of that this is
 

5009
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:41,310
stuff and then on top of that this is
the the um the the model of the brain

5010
01:34:41,310 --> 01:34:41,320
the the um the the model of the brain
 

5011
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:43,109
the the um the the model of the brain
that no one really subscribes to anymore

5012
01:34:43,109 --> 01:34:43,119
that no one really subscribes to anymore
 

5013
01:34:43,119 --> 01:34:44,950
that no one really subscribes to anymore
but anatomically it works and then on

5014
01:34:44,950 --> 01:34:44,960
but anatomically it works and then on
 

5015
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:46,790
but anatomically it works and then on
top in mammals and then on top of that

5016
01:34:46,790 --> 01:34:46,800
top in mammals and then on top of that
 

5017
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:49,109
top in mammals and then on top of that
you have the lyic structures which gate

5018
01:34:49,109 --> 01:34:49,119
you have the lyic structures which gate
 

5019
01:34:49,119 --> 01:34:50,709
you have the lyic structures which gate
sensory information and decide whether

5020
01:34:50,709 --> 01:34:50,719
sensory information and decide whether
 

5021
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:51,669
sensory information and decide whether
or not you're going to listen to

5022
01:34:51,669 --> 01:34:51,679
or not you're going to listen to
 

5023
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:52,669
or not you're going to listen to
something more than you're going to look

5024
01:34:52,669 --> 01:34:52,679
something more than you're going to look
 

5025
01:34:52,679 --> 01:34:53,870
something more than you're going to look
at it or you're going to split your

5026
01:34:53,870 --> 01:34:53,880
at it or you're going to split your
 

5027
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:56,390
at it or you're going to split your
attention to both kind of sensory

5028
01:34:56,390 --> 01:34:56,400
attention to both kind of sensory
 

5029
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:58,870
attention to both kind of sensory
allocation stuff um and then the

5030
01:34:58,870 --> 01:34:58,880
allocation stuff um and then the
 

5031
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:03,430
allocation stuff um and then the
neocortex is on the outside um and that

5032
01:35:03,430 --> 01:35:03,440
neocortex is on the outside um and that
 

5033
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:04,510
neocortex is on the outside um and that
is where you get a lot of this

5034
01:35:04,510 --> 01:35:04,520
is where you get a lot of this
 

5035
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:06,270
is where you get a lot of this
abstraction stuff and now not all

5036
01:35:06,270 --> 01:35:06,280
abstraction stuff and now not all
 

5037
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:07,790
abstraction stuff and now not all
cortical areas are doing abstraction

5038
01:35:07,790 --> 01:35:07,800
cortical areas are doing abstraction
 

5039
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:10,510
cortical areas are doing abstraction
some like visual area one auditory area

5040
01:35:10,510 --> 01:35:10,520
some like visual area one auditory area
 

5041
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:12,910
some like visual area one auditory area
one they're just doing concrete uh

5042
01:35:12,910 --> 01:35:12,920
one they're just doing concrete uh
 

5043
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:15,350
one they're just doing concrete uh
representations but um as you get into

5044
01:35:15,350 --> 01:35:15,360
representations but um as you get into
 

5045
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:17,470
representations but um as you get into
the higher order stuff that when you

5046
01:35:17,470 --> 01:35:17,480
the higher order stuff that when you
 

5047
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:19,830
the higher order stuff that when you
start hearing names like infro parietal

5048
01:35:19,830 --> 01:35:19,840
start hearing names like infro parietal
 

5049
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,030
start hearing names like infro parietal
cortex and you know when you start

5050
01:35:21,030 --> 01:35:21,040
cortex and you know when you start
 

5051
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:22,830
cortex and you know when you start
hearing multiple names in the same then

5052
01:35:22,830 --> 01:35:22,840
hearing multiple names in the same then
 

5053
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:24,950
hearing multiple names in the same then
you're talking about higher order areas

5054
01:35:24,950 --> 01:35:24,960
you're talking about higher order areas
 

5055
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:26,950
you're talking about higher order areas
but actually there's a an important

5056
01:35:26,950 --> 01:35:26,960
but actually there's a an important
 

5057
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:30,070
but actually there's a an important
experiment that um that drives a lot of

5058
01:35:30,070 --> 01:35:30,080
experiment that um that drives a lot of
 

5059
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:31,590
experiment that um that drives a lot of
what people want to do with brain

5060
01:35:31,590 --> 01:35:31,600
what people want to do with brain
 

5061
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,310
what people want to do with brain
machine interface and that's the work of

5062
01:35:33,310 --> 01:35:33,320
machine interface and that's the work of
 

5063
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:35,030
machine interface and that's the work of
Bill Nome who is at Stanford and Tony

5064
01:35:35,030 --> 01:35:35,040
Bill Nome who is at Stanford and Tony
 

5065
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:36,550
Bill Nome who is at Stanford and Tony
maavin who's at runs the center for

5066
01:35:36,550 --> 01:35:36,560
maavin who's at runs the center for
 

5067
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:39,189
maavin who's at runs the center for
neural science at NYU this is a wild

5068
01:35:39,189 --> 01:35:39,199
neural science at NYU this is a wild
 

5069
01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:41,310
neural science at NYU this is a wild
experiment and I think it might freak a

5070
01:35:41,310 --> 01:35:41,320
experiment and I think it might freak a
 

5071
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:42,709
experiment and I think it might freak a
few people out if they really think

5072
01:35:42,709 --> 01:35:42,719
few people out if they really think
 

5073
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:45,270
few people out if they really think
about it too deeply but um anyway here

5074
01:35:45,270 --> 01:35:45,280
about it too deeply but um anyway here
 

5075
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:49,310
about it too deeply but um anyway here
he goes there's an area called Mt in the

5076
01:35:49,310 --> 01:35:49,320
he goes there's an area called Mt in the
 

5077
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:51,629
he goes there's an area called Mt in the
cortex and if I showed you a bunch of

5078
01:35:51,629 --> 01:35:51,639
cortex and if I showed you a bunch of
 

5079
01:35:51,639 --> 01:35:53,990
cortex and if I showed you a bunch of
dots all moving up and this is is what

5080
01:35:53,990 --> 01:35:54,000
dots all moving up and this is is what
 

5081
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,990
dots all moving up and this is is what
they this is what Tony and Bill and some

5082
01:35:55,990 --> 01:35:56,000
they this is what Tony and Bill and some
 

5083
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,390
they this is what Tony and Bill and some
of the other people um in that lab did

5084
01:35:58,390 --> 01:35:58,400
of the other people um in that lab did
 

5085
01:35:58,400 --> 01:35:59,669
of the other people um in that lab did
way back when is they show a bunch of

5086
01:35:59,669 --> 01:35:59,679
way back when is they show a bunch of
 

5087
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:02,470
way back when is they show a bunch of
dots moving up somewhere in Mt there's

5088
01:36:02,470 --> 01:36:02,480
dots moving up somewhere in Mt there's
 

5089
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:04,750
dots moving up somewhere in Mt there's
some neurons that respond they fire when

5090
01:36:04,750 --> 01:36:04,760
some neurons that respond they fire when
 

5091
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:06,430
some neurons that respond they fire when
the neurons move up and then what they

5092
01:36:06,430 --> 01:36:06,440
the neurons move up and then what they
 

5093
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:07,430
the neurons move up and then what they
did is they started varying the

5094
01:36:07,430 --> 01:36:07,440
did is they started varying the
 

5095
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:09,229
did is they started varying the
coherence of that motion so they made it

5096
01:36:09,229 --> 01:36:09,239
coherence of that motion so they made it
 

5097
01:36:09,239 --> 01:36:11,109
coherence of that motion so they made it
so only 50% of the dots moved up and the

5098
01:36:11,109 --> 01:36:11,119
so only 50% of the dots moved up and the
 

5099
01:36:11,119 --> 01:36:13,189
so only 50% of the dots moved up and the
rest move randomly and that neuron fires

5100
01:36:13,189 --> 01:36:13,199
rest move randomly and that neuron fires
 

5101
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:15,390
rest move randomly and that neuron fires
a little less and eventually it's random

5102
01:36:15,390 --> 01:36:15,400
a little less and eventually it's random
 

5103
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:16,790
a little less and eventually it's random
and that neuron stops firing because

5104
01:36:16,790 --> 01:36:16,800
and that neuron stops firing because
 

5105
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:18,629
and that neuron stops firing because
it's just kind of dots moving everywhere

5106
01:36:18,629 --> 01:36:18,639
it's just kind of dots moving everywhere
 

5107
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:20,149
it's just kind of dots moving everywhere
it's awesome and there's a systematic

5108
01:36:20,149 --> 01:36:20,159
it's awesome and there's a systematic
 

5109
01:36:20,159 --> 01:36:22,310
it's awesome and there's a systematic
map so that other neurons are responding

5110
01:36:22,310 --> 01:36:22,320
map so that other neurons are responding
 

5111
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:23,629
map so that other neurons are responding
and things moving down and other things

5112
01:36:23,629 --> 01:36:23,639
and things moving down and other things
 

5113
01:36:23,639 --> 01:36:24,830
and things moving down and other things
are responding left and other things are

5114
01:36:24,830 --> 01:36:24,840
are responding left and other things are
 

5115
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:26,870
are responding left and other things are
moving right okay so there's a map of

5116
01:36:26,870 --> 01:36:26,880
moving right okay so there's a map of
 

5117
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:29,790
moving right okay so there's a map of
direction space you okay well that's

5118
01:36:29,790 --> 01:36:29,800
direction space you okay well that's
 

5119
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:32,270
direction space you okay well that's
great you could leion Mt animals lose

5120
01:36:32,270 --> 01:36:32,280
great you could leion Mt animals lose
 

5121
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:34,109
great you could leion Mt animals lose
the ability to do these kind of

5122
01:36:34,109 --> 01:36:34,119
the ability to do these kind of
 

5123
01:36:34,119 --> 01:36:36,109
the ability to do these kind of
coherence discrimination or Direction

5124
01:36:36,109 --> 01:36:36,119
coherence discrimination or Direction
 

5125
01:36:36,119 --> 01:36:38,070
coherence discrimination or Direction
discrimination but the Amazing

5126
01:36:38,070 --> 01:36:38,080
discrimination but the Amazing
 

5127
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:40,910
discrimination but the Amazing
Experiment the one that just is kind of

5128
01:36:40,910 --> 01:36:40,920
Experiment the one that just is kind of
 

5129
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:43,830
Experiment the one that just is kind of
eerie is that they lowered a stimulating

5130
01:36:43,830 --> 01:36:43,840
eerie is that they lowered a stimulating
 

5131
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:46,750
eerie is that they lowered a stimulating
electrode into Mt found a neuron that

5132
01:36:46,750 --> 01:36:46,760
electrode into Mt found a neuron that
 

5133
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:50,830
electrode into Mt found a neuron that
responds to when dots go up but then

5134
01:36:50,830 --> 01:36:50,840
responds to when dots go up but then
 

5135
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:52,350
responds to when dots go up but then
they silence that

5136
01:36:52,350 --> 01:36:52,360
they silence that
 

5137
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:55,270
they silence that
neuron and and sure enough the animal

5138
01:36:55,270 --> 01:36:55,280
neuron and and sure enough the animal
 

5139
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:57,350
neuron and and sure enough the animal
doesn't recognize the neurons are going

5140
01:36:57,350 --> 01:36:57,360
doesn't recognize the neurons are going
 

5141
01:36:57,360 --> 01:37:00,790
doesn't recognize the neurons are going
up and then they move the dots

5142
01:37:00,790 --> 01:37:00,800
up and then they move the dots
 

5143
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:03,550
up and then they move the dots
down they stimulate the neuron that

5144
01:37:03,550 --> 01:37:03,560
down they stimulate the neuron that
 

5145
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:06,590
down they stimulate the neuron that
responds to things moving up and the

5146
01:37:06,590 --> 01:37:06,600
responds to things moving up and the
 

5147
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:09,310
responds to things moving up and the
animal responds because it can't speak

5148
01:37:09,310 --> 01:37:09,320
animal responds because it can't speak
 

5149
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:10,990
animal responds because it can't speak
it responds by doing a lever press which

5150
01:37:10,990 --> 01:37:11,000
it responds by doing a lever press which
 

5151
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,070
it responds by doing a lever press which
says the dots are moving up so in other

they're stimulating the neuron that
 

5159
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:22,790
they're stimulating the neuron that
responds to dots moving up and the

perception of the animal is that dots
 

5163
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:28,590
perception of the animal is that dots
are moving up which tells you that your

01:37:28,590 --> 01:37:28,600
are moving up which tells you that your
 

5165
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:31,030

perception of external reality
 

5167
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:33,390

your perception of the outside world
 

5175
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:43,830
your perception of the outside world
depends entirely on the activation

depends entirely on the activation
patterns of neurons in the brain and you

5178
01:37:47,149 --> 01:37:47,159
patterns of neurons in the brain and you
 

5179
01:37:47,159 --> 01:37:48,870
patterns of neurons in the brain and you
you can hear that and say well duh

5180
01:37:48,870 --> 01:37:48,880
you can hear that and say well duh
 

5181
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:50,470
you can hear that and say well duh
because if I stimulate you know the

5182
01:37:50,470 --> 01:37:50,480
because if I stimulate you know the
 

5183
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:52,310
because if I stimulate you know the
stretch reflex and you kick or something

5184
01:37:52,310 --> 01:37:52,320
stretch reflex and you kick or something
 

5185
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:54,030
stretch reflex and you kick or something
or whatever you know the knee F Lex and

5186
01:37:54,030 --> 01:37:54,040
or whatever you know the knee F Lex and
 

5187
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:55,510
or whatever you know the knee F Lex and
you kick of course there's a neuron that

5188
01:37:55,510 --> 01:37:55,520
you kick of course there's a neuron that
 

5189
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:57,669
you kick of course there's a neuron that
triggers that but it didn't have to be

5190
01:37:57,669 --> 01:37:57,679
triggers that but it didn't have to be
 

5191
01:37:57,679 --> 01:37:59,910
triggers that but it didn't have to be
that way yeah because a the animal had

5192
01:37:59,910 --> 01:37:59,920
that way yeah because a the animal had
 

5193
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:02,510
that way yeah because a the animal had

generally try to avoid conversations
 

5201
01:38:09,679 --> 01:38:11,310
generally try to avoid conversations
about this kind of thing but what this

5202
01:38:11,310 --> 01:38:11,320
about this kind of thing but what this
 

5203
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:14,470
about this kind of thing but what this
means is that we are constructing our

5204
01:38:14,470 --> 01:38:14,480
means is that we are constructing our

01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:16,510
means is that we are constructing our

of Donald
 

5219
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:32,350
of Donald
Hoffman so he's

5220
01:38:32,350 --> 01:38:32,360
Hoffman so he's
 

5221
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:34,750
Hoffman so he's
uh uh so he makes an evolutionary

5222
01:38:34,750 --> 01:38:34,760
uh uh so he makes an evolutionary
 

5223
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:40,629
uh uh so he makes an evolutionary
argument that's not important of that we

01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:02,830
it is oh my so so he
goes scary so he doesn't say like

there's a there's a gap there there
 

5245
01:39:07,480 --> 01:39:08,870
there's a there's a gap there there
might be a gap with constructing an

01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:44,390
lost its on the on the on the path
of evolution to where we're no long

5274
01:39:44,390 --> 01:39:44,400
of evolution to where we're no long
 

5275
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,790
of evolution to where we're no long
we're just playing games with each other

5276
01:39:46,790 --> 01:39:46,800
we're just playing games with each other
 

5277
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:49,550
we're just playing games with each other
in constructing realities that allow our

5278
01:39:49,550 --> 01:39:49,560
in constructing realities that allow our
 

5279
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:52,470
in constructing realities that allow our
survival but it's it's it's completely

5280
01:39:52,470 --> 01:39:52,480
survival but it's it's it's completely
 

5281
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:54,149
survival but it's it's it's completely
detached from phys IAL reality like

5282
01:39:54,149 --> 01:39:54,159
detached from phys IAL reality like
 

5283
01:39:54,159 --> 01:39:56,669
detached from phys IAL reality like
we're we're missing a lot we're

5284
01:39:56,669 --> 01:39:56,679
we're we're missing a lot we're
 

5285
01:39:56,679 --> 01:40:01,470
we're we're missing a lot we're
missing like most of it if not all of it

5286
01:40:01,470 --> 01:40:01,480
missing like most of it if not all of it
 

5287
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:03,669
missing like most of it if not all of it
well this was um it's it's fascinating

5288
01:40:03,669 --> 01:40:03,679
well this was um it's it's fascinating
 

5289
01:40:03,679 --> 01:40:05,629
well this was um it's it's fascinating
because I just saw the Oliver Sachs

5290
01:40:05,629 --> 01:40:05,639
because I just saw the Oliver Sachs
 

5291
01:40:05,639 --> 01:40:07,550
because I just saw the Oliver Sachs
documentary there's a new documentary

5292
01:40:07,550 --> 01:40:07,560
documentary there's a new documentary
 

5293
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:09,950
documentary there's a new documentary
out about his life and there's this one

5294
01:40:09,950 --> 01:40:09,960
out about his life and there's this one
 

5295
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:11,950
out about his life and there's this one
part where he's like I've spent part of

5296
01:40:11,950 --> 01:40:11,960
part where he's like I've spent part of
 

5297
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:13,550
part where he's like I've spent part of
my life trying to imagine what it would

5298
01:40:13,550 --> 01:40:13,560
my life trying to imagine what it would
 

5299
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:16,629
my life trying to imagine what it would
like to be be uh to be a bat or

5300
01:40:16,629 --> 01:40:16,639
like to be be uh to be a bat or
 

5301
01:40:16,639 --> 01:40:19,149
like to be be uh to be a bat or
something to see the world through the

5302
01:40:19,149 --> 01:40:19,159
something to see the world through the
 

5303
01:40:19,159 --> 01:40:21,390
something to see the world through the
life you know the sensory apparat of a

5304
01:40:21,390 --> 01:40:21,400
life you know the sensory apparat of a
 

5305
01:40:21,400 --> 01:40:23,310
life you know the sensory apparat of a
bat and he did this with his these

5306
01:40:23,310 --> 01:40:23,320
bat and he did this with his these
 

5307
01:40:23,320 --> 01:40:24,870
bat and he did this with his these
patients that were locked into these

5308
01:40:24,870 --> 01:40:24,880
patients that were locked into these
 

5309
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:27,350
patients that were locked into these
horrible syndromes that to pull out some

5310
01:40:27,350 --> 01:40:27,360
horrible syndromes that to pull out some
 

5311
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:29,709
horrible syndromes that to pull out some
of the the beauty of their experience as

5312
01:40:29,709 --> 01:40:29,719
of the the beauty of their experience as
 

5313
01:40:29,719 --> 01:40:31,870
of the the beauty of their experience as
well not just communicate the suffering

5314
01:40:31,870 --> 01:40:31,880
well not just communicate the suffering
 

5315
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:34,390
well not just communicate the suffering
although the suffering too and as I was

5316
01:40:34,390 --> 01:40:34,400
although the suffering too and as I was
 

5317
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:35,629
although the suffering too and as I was
listening to him talk about this I

5318
01:40:35,629 --> 01:40:35,639
listening to him talk about this I
 

5319
01:40:35,639 --> 01:40:37,950
listening to him talk about this I
started to realize it's like what you

5320
01:40:37,950 --> 01:40:37,960
started to realize it's like what you
 

5321
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:39,750
started to realize it's like what you
know like they're these mantis shrimps

5322
01:40:39,750 --> 01:40:39,760
know like they're these mantis shrimps
 

5323
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:42,629
know like they're these mantis shrimps
that can see 60 shades of pink or

5324
01:40:42,629 --> 01:40:42,639
that can see 60 shades of pink or
 

5325
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:43,830
that can see 60 shades of pink or
something and they they see the stuff

5326
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:43,840
something and they they see the stuff
 

5327
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:45,669
something and they they see the stuff
all the time and animals they can see UV

5328
01:40:45,669 --> 01:40:45,679
all the time and animals they can see UV
 

5329
01:40:45,679 --> 01:40:49,229
all the time and animals they can see UV
light every time I learn about an animal

5330
01:40:49,229 --> 01:40:49,239
light every time I learn about an animal
 

5331
01:40:49,239 --> 01:40:50,510
light every time I learn about an animal
that can sense other things in the

5332
01:40:50,510 --> 01:40:50,520
that can sense other things in the
 

5333
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:51,830
that can sense other things in the
environment that I can't like heat

5334
01:40:51,830 --> 01:40:51,840
environment that I can't like heat

experience the same way saxs talked

5338
01:40:56,310 --> 01:40:56,320
experience the same way saxs talked
 

5339
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:58,229
experience the same way saxs talked
about craving that experience but it

5340
01:40:58,229 --> 01:40:58,239
about craving that experience but it
 

5341
01:40:58,239 --> 01:41:00,790
about craving that experience but it
does throw another penny in the jar for

5342
01:41:00,790 --> 01:41:00,800
does throw another penny in the jar for
 

5343
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:02,950
does throw another penny in the jar for
what you're saying which is that it

5344
01:41:02,950 --> 01:41:02,960
what you're saying which is that it
 

5345
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:05,629
what you're saying which is that it
could be that most if not all of what I

5346
01:41:05,629 --> 01:41:05,639
could be that most if not all of what I
 

5347
01:41:05,639 --> 01:41:09,629
could be that most if not all of what I
perceive and believe is just um a a

5348
01:41:09,629 --> 01:41:09,639
perceive and believe is just um a a
 

5349
01:41:09,639 --> 01:41:12,669
perceive and believe is just um a a
neural fabrication and that For Better

5350
01:41:12,669 --> 01:41:12,679
neural fabrication and that For Better
 

5351
01:41:12,679 --> 01:41:14,629
neural fabrication and that For Better
or For Worse we all agree on enough of

5352
01:41:14,629 --> 01:41:14,639
or For Worse we all agree on enough of
 

5353
01:41:14,639 --> 01:41:16,550
or For Worse we all agree on enough of
the same neural Fabrications in the same

5354
01:41:16,550 --> 01:41:16,560
the same neural Fabrications in the same
 

5355
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:17,990
the same neural Fabrications in the same
time and place that we're able to

5356
01:41:17,990 --> 01:41:18,000
time and place that we're able to
 

5357
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,229
time and place that we're able to
function not only that but we agree with

5358
01:41:20,229 --> 01:41:20,239
function not only that but we agree with
 

5359
01:41:20,239 --> 01:41:23,510
function not only that but we agree with
the things that are trying to eat us uh

5360
01:41:23,510 --> 01:41:23,520
the things that are trying to eat us uh
 

5361
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:25,790
the things that are trying to eat us uh
enough to where we don't they don't eat

5362
01:41:25,790 --> 01:41:25,800
enough to where we don't they don't eat
 

5363
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:27,070
enough to where we don't they don't eat
us meaning

5364
01:41:27,070 --> 01:41:27,080
us meaning
 

5365
01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:30,229
us meaning
like that it's not just us humans you

5366
01:41:30,229 --> 01:41:30,239
like that it's not just us humans you
 

5367
01:41:30,239 --> 01:41:31,470
like that it's not just us humans you
know right I see because it's

5368
01:41:31,470 --> 01:41:31,480
know right I see because it's
 

5369
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:34,270
know right I see because it's
interactive it's interactive so like so

5370
01:41:34,270 --> 01:41:34,280
interactive it's interactive so like so
 

5371
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:38,589
interactive it's interactive so like so
like uh now I think it's a really um

5372
01:41:38,589 --> 01:41:38,599
like uh now I think it's a really um
 

5373
01:41:38,599 --> 01:41:42,109
like uh now I think it's a really um
nice thought experiment I think because

5374
01:41:42,109 --> 01:41:42,119
nice thought experiment I think because
 

5375
01:41:42,119 --> 01:41:43,709
nice thought experiment I think because
uh

5376
01:41:43,709 --> 01:41:43,719
uh
 

5377
01:41:43,719 --> 01:41:46,629
uh
Donald really frames it in a scientific

5378
01:41:46,629 --> 01:41:46,639
Donald really frames it in a scientific
 

5379
01:41:46,639 --> 01:41:49,310
Donald really frames it in a scientific
like he makes a hard like as hard as our

5380
01:41:49,310 --> 01:41:49,320
like he makes a hard like as hard as our
 

5381
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:51,910
like he makes a hard like as hard as our
discussion has been now he makes a hard

5382
01:41:51,910 --> 01:41:51,920
discussion has been now he makes a hard
 

5383
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:54,470
discussion has been now he makes a hard
scientific case that we don't know

5384
01:41:54,470 --> 01:41:54,480
scientific case that we don't know
 

5385
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:56,950
scientific case that we don't know
about reality uh I think that's a little

5386
01:41:56,950 --> 01:41:56,960
about reality uh I think that's a little
 

5387
01:41:56,960 --> 01:42:01,470
about reality uh I think that's a little
bit uh hardcore but I I think it's I

5388
01:42:01,470 --> 01:42:01,480
bit uh hardcore but I I think it's I
 

5389
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:03,990
bit uh hardcore but I I think it's I
think is hardore is hardore I think it's

5390
01:42:03,990 --> 01:42:04,000
think is hardore is hardore I think it's
 

5391
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,149
think is hardore is hardore I think it's
a good thought experiment that kind of

5392
01:42:06,149 --> 01:42:06,159
a good thought experiment that kind of
 

5393
01:42:06,159 --> 01:42:08,589
a good thought experiment that kind of
uh cleanses the pallet of the confidence

5394
01:42:08,589 --> 01:42:08,599
uh cleanses the pallet of the confidence
 

5395
01:42:08,599 --> 01:42:13,109
uh cleanses the pallet of the confidence
we might have about uh about cuz we are

5396
01:42:13,109 --> 01:42:13,119
we might have about uh about cuz we are
 

5397
01:42:13,119 --> 01:42:16,390
we might have about uh about cuz we are
operating in this abstraction space and

5398
01:42:16,390 --> 01:42:16,400
operating in this abstraction space and
 

5399
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:19,830
operating in this abstraction space and
you know and uh you know the sensory

5400
01:42:19,830 --> 01:42:19,840
you know and uh you know the sensory
 

5401
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:22,149
you know and uh you know the sensory
spaces might be something very different

5402
01:42:22,149 --> 01:42:22,159
spaces might be something very different
 

5403
01:42:22,159 --> 01:42:24,470
spaces might be something very different
and and it's kind of interesting to

5404
01:42:24,470 --> 01:42:24,480
and and it's kind of interesting to
 

5405
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:26,470
and and it's kind of interesting to
think about if if you start to go into

5406
01:42:26,470 --> 01:42:26,480
think about if if you start to go into
 

5407
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:28,950
think about if if you start to go into
the realm of neuralink or start to talk

5408
01:42:28,950 --> 01:42:28,960
the realm of neuralink or start to talk
 

5409
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:30,470
the realm of neuralink or start to talk
about just everything you've been

5410
01:42:30,470 --> 01:42:30,480
about just everything you've been
 

5411
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:31,830
about just everything you've been
talking about with dream states and

5412
01:42:31,830 --> 01:42:31,840
talking about with dream states and
 

5413
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:34,310
talking about with dream states and
psychedelics and stuff like that which

5414
01:42:34,310 --> 01:42:34,320
psychedelics and stuff like that which
 

5415
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:37,149
psychedelics and stuff like that which
part of the which layer can we control

5416
01:42:37,149 --> 01:42:37,159
part of the which layer can we control
 

5417
01:42:37,159 --> 01:42:39,709
part of the which layer can we control
and play around with to maybe look into

5418
01:42:39,709 --> 01:42:39,719
and play around with to maybe look into
 

5419
01:42:39,719 --> 01:42:42,390
and play around with to maybe look into
a different slice of reality it you know

5420
01:42:42,390 --> 01:42:42,400
a different slice of reality it you know
 

5421
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:44,589
a different slice of reality it you know
you just got to do the experiment the

5422
01:42:44,589 --> 01:42:44,599
you just got to do the experiment the
 

5423
01:42:44,599 --> 01:42:46,390
you just got to do the experiment the
key is to just do the experiment in the

5424
01:42:46,390 --> 01:42:46,400
key is to just do the experiment in the
 

5425
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:48,589
key is to just do the experiment in the
most ethical way possible you just I

5426
01:42:48,589 --> 01:42:48,599
most ethical way possible you just I
 

5427
01:42:48,599 --> 01:42:50,550
most ethical way possible you just I
mean that's the beauty of experiments

5428
01:42:50,550 --> 01:42:50,560
mean that's the beauty of experiments
 

5429
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:53,229
mean that's the beauty of experiments
this is why um you know there there

5430
01:42:53,229 --> 01:42:53,239
this is why um you know there there
 

5431
01:42:53,239 --> 01:42:54,510
this is why um you know there there
there's wonderful theoretical

5432
01:42:54,510 --> 01:42:54,520
there's wonderful theoretical
 

5433
01:42:54,520 --> 01:42:56,270
there's wonderful theoretical
Neuroscience Happening Now make to make

5434
01:42:56,270 --> 01:42:56,280
Neuroscience Happening Now make to make
 

5435
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:58,750
Neuroscience Happening Now make to make
predictions and but the but that's why

5436
01:42:58,750 --> 01:42:58,760
predictions and but the but that's why
 

5437
01:42:58,760 --> 01:43:00,589
predictions and but the but that's why
experimental science is so wonderful you

5438
01:43:00,589 --> 01:43:00,599
experimental science is so wonderful you
 

5439
01:43:00,599 --> 01:43:02,709
experimental science is so wonderful you
can go into the laboratory and poke

5440
01:43:02,709 --> 01:43:02,719
can go into the laboratory and poke
 

5441
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:04,350
can go into the laboratory and poke
around in there and be a brain Explorer

5442
01:43:04,350 --> 01:43:04,360
around in there and be a brain Explorer
 

5443
01:43:04,360 --> 01:43:07,229
around in there and be a brain Explorer
and and listen to and write to neurons

5444
01:43:07,229 --> 01:43:07,239
and and listen to and write to neurons
 

5445
01:43:07,239 --> 01:43:09,470
and and listen to and write to neurons
and when you do that you get answers you

5446
01:43:09,470 --> 01:43:09,480
and when you do that you get answers you
 

5447
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:10,910
and when you do that you get answers you
don't always get the answers you want

5448
01:43:10,910 --> 01:43:10,920
don't always get the answers you want
 

5449
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:12,830
don't always get the answers you want
but that's you know that's the beauty of

5450
01:43:12,830 --> 01:43:12,840
but that's you know that's the beauty of
 

5451
01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:15,229
but that's you know that's the beauty of
it I I think when you were saying um

5452
01:43:15,229 --> 01:43:15,239
it I I think when you were saying um
 

5453
01:43:15,239 --> 01:43:17,830
it I I think when you were saying um
this thing about reality and the Donald

5454
01:43:17,830 --> 01:43:17,840
this thing about reality and the Donald
 

5455
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:19,830
this thing about reality and the Donald
Hoffman model I was thinking about

5456
01:43:19,830 --> 01:43:19,840
Hoffman model I was thinking about
 

5457
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:22,510
Hoffman model I was thinking about
children you know at um like when I have

5458
01:43:22,510 --> 01:43:22,520
children you know at um like when I have
 

5459
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:25,430
children you know at um like when I have
an older sister Shir uh she's very sane

5460
01:43:25,430 --> 01:43:25,440
an older sister Shir uh she's very sane
 

5461
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:28,589
an older sister Shir uh she's very sane
um uh but when she was a kid she had an

5462
01:43:28,589 --> 01:43:28,599
um uh but when she was a kid she had an
 

5463
01:43:28,599 --> 01:43:30,750
um uh but when she was a kid she had an
imaginary friend yeah and she would play

5464
01:43:30,750 --> 01:43:30,760
imaginary friend yeah and she would play
 

5465
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:32,990
imaginary friend yeah and she would play
with this imaginary friend and it had

5466
01:43:32,990 --> 01:43:33,000
with this imaginary friend and it had
 

5467
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:34,270
with this imaginary friend and it had
there was this whole there was a

5468
01:43:34,270 --> 01:43:34,280
there was this whole there was a
 

5469
01:43:34,280 --> 01:43:36,030
there was this whole there was a
consistency this friend was like it was

5470
01:43:36,030 --> 01:43:36,040
consistency this friend was like it was
 

5471
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:38,030
consistency this friend was like it was
Larry lived in a purple house Larry was

5472
01:43:38,030 --> 01:43:38,040
Larry lived in a purple house Larry was
 

5473
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:39,870
Larry lived in a purple house Larry was
a girl it was like all this stuff that a

5474
01:43:39,870 --> 01:43:39,880
a girl it was like all this stuff that a
 

5475
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:41,790
a girl it was like all this stuff that a
child a young child wouldn't have any

5476
01:43:41,790 --> 01:43:41,800
child a young child wouldn't have any
 

5477
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:43,470
child a young child wouldn't have any
issue with and then one day she

5478
01:43:43,470 --> 01:43:43,480
issue with and then one day she
 

5479
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:45,149
issue with and then one day she
announced that Larry had died right and

5480
01:43:45,149 --> 01:43:45,159
announced that Larry had died right and
 

5481
01:43:45,159 --> 01:43:47,149
announced that Larry had died right and
it wasn't dramatic or traumatic and that

5482
01:43:47,149 --> 01:43:47,159
it wasn't dramatic or traumatic and that
 

5483
01:43:47,159 --> 01:43:49,070
it wasn't dramatic or traumatic and that
was it and she just stopped and I always

5484
01:43:49,070 --> 01:43:49,080
was it and she just stopped and I always
 

5485
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:51,950
was it and she just stopped and I always
wonder what that um neurodevelopmental

5486
01:43:51,950 --> 01:43:51,960
wonder what that um neurodevelopmental
 

5487
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:56,669
wonder what that um neurodevelopmental
event was that um a kept her out of a a

5488
01:43:56,669 --> 01:43:56,679
event was that um a kept her out of a a
 

5489
01:43:56,679 --> 01:43:58,629
event was that um a kept her out of a a
psychiatric ward had she got you know

5490
01:43:58,629 --> 01:43:58,639
psychiatric ward had she got you know
 

5491
01:43:58,639 --> 01:44:02,229
psychiatric ward had she got you know
kept that imaginary friend but but it I

5492
01:44:02,229 --> 01:44:02,239
kept that imaginary friend but but it I
 

5493
01:44:02,239 --> 01:44:03,430
kept that imaginary friend but but it I
it's also there was something kind of

5494
01:44:03,430 --> 01:44:03,440
it's also there was something kind of
 

5495
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:05,709
it's also there was something kind of
sad to it I think the way it was told to

5496
01:44:05,709 --> 01:44:05,719
sad to it I think the way it was told to
 

5497
01:44:05,719 --> 01:44:07,030
sad to it I think the way it was told to
me because I'm the younger brother I

5498
01:44:07,030 --> 01:44:07,040
me because I'm the younger brother I
 

5499
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:08,870
me because I'm the younger brother I
didn't I wasn't around for that but my

5500
01:44:08,870 --> 01:44:08,880
didn't I wasn't around for that but my
 

5501
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:10,510
didn't I wasn't around for that but my
my dad told me that you know there was a

5502
01:44:10,510 --> 01:44:10,520
my dad told me that you know there was a
 

5503
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:12,229
my dad told me that you know there was a
kind of a sadness because it was this

5504
01:44:12,229 --> 01:44:12,239
kind of a sadness because it was this
 

5505
01:44:12,239 --> 01:44:13,470
kind of a sadness because it was this
beautiful reality that had been

5506
01:44:13,470 --> 01:44:13,480
beautiful reality that had been
 

5507
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:15,470
beautiful reality that had been
constructed and so we kind of w i i

5508
01:44:15,470 --> 01:44:15,480
constructed and so we kind of w i i
 

5509
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:16,870
constructed and so we kind of w i i
wonder as you're telling me this whether

5510
01:44:16,870 --> 01:44:16,880
wonder as you're telling me this whether
 

5511
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:19,709
wonder as you're telling me this whether
or not you know as adults we try and

5512
01:44:19,709 --> 01:44:19,719
or not you know as adults we try and
 

5513
01:44:19,719 --> 01:44:21,790
or not you know as adults we try and
create as much reality for children as

5514
01:44:21,790 --> 01:44:21,800
create as much reality for children as
 

5515
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:23,390
create as much reality for children as
we can so that they can make predictions

5516
01:44:23,390 --> 01:44:23,400
we can so that they can make predictions
 

5517
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:24,870
we can so that they can make predictions
and feel safe because the ability to

5518
01:44:24,870 --> 01:44:24,880
and feel safe because the ability to
 

5519
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:26,390
and feel safe because the ability to
make predictions is a lot of what keeps

5520
01:44:26,390 --> 01:44:26,400
make predictions is a lot of what keeps
 

5521
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:28,990
make predictions is a lot of what keeps
our autonomic arousal in check I mean we

5522
01:44:28,990 --> 01:44:29,000
our autonomic arousal in check I mean we
 

5523
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,430
our autonomic arousal in check I mean we
go to sleep every night and we give up

5524
01:44:30,430 --> 01:44:30,440
go to sleep every night and we give up
 

5525
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:32,910
go to sleep every night and we give up
total control and that should frighten

5526
01:44:32,910 --> 01:44:32,920
total control and that should frighten
 

5527
01:44:32,920 --> 01:44:34,950
total control and that should frighten
us deeply but you know unfortunately

5528
01:44:34,950 --> 01:44:34,960
us deeply but you know unfortunately
 

5529
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:37,390
us deeply but you know unfortunately
autonomic rousel Yanks us down under and

5530
01:44:37,390 --> 01:44:37,400
autonomic rousel Yanks us down under and
 

5531
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:40,229
autonomic rousel Yanks us down under and
we don't negotiate too much so you sleep

5532
01:44:40,229 --> 01:44:40,239
we don't negotiate too much so you sleep
 

5533
01:44:40,239 --> 01:44:44,109
we don't negotiate too much so you sleep
sooner or later um I don't know um I was

5534
01:44:44,109 --> 01:44:44,119
sooner or later um I don't know um I was
 

5535
01:44:44,119 --> 01:44:45,070
sooner or later um I don't know um I was
a little worried we'd get into

5536
01:44:45,070 --> 01:44:45,080
a little worried we'd get into
 

5537
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:46,589
a little worried we'd get into
discussions about the nature of reality

5538
01:44:46,589 --> 01:44:46,599
discussions about the nature of reality
 

5539
01:44:46,599 --> 01:44:47,910
discussions about the nature of reality
because I'm I it's interesting in the

5540
01:44:47,910 --> 01:44:47,920
because I'm I it's interesting in the
 

5541
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:50,310
because I'm I it's interesting in the
laboratory I'm a very much like what's

5542
01:44:50,310 --> 01:44:50,320
laboratory I'm a very much like what's
 

5543
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:52,070
laboratory I'm a very much like what's
the experiment what would the you know

5544
01:44:52,070 --> 01:44:52,080
the experiment what would the you know
 

5545
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:53,830
the experiment what would the you know
what's the analysis going look like what

5546
01:44:53,830 --> 01:44:53,840
what's the analysis going look like what
 

5547
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:56,030
what's the analysis going look like what
mutant Mouse are we going to use what

5548
01:44:56,030 --> 01:44:56,040
mutant Mouse are we going to use what
 

5549
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:57,950
mutant Mouse are we going to use what
what what experience are we going to put

5550
01:44:57,950 --> 01:44:57,960
what what experience are we going to put
 

5551
01:44:57,960 --> 01:44:59,189
what what experience are we going to put
someone through but I think it's

5552
01:44:59,189 --> 01:44:59,199
someone through but I think it's
 

5553
01:44:59,199 --> 01:45:01,790
someone through but I think it's
wonderful that in 2020 we can finally

5554
01:45:01,790 --> 01:45:01,800
wonderful that in 2020 we can finally
 

5555
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:04,030
wonderful that in 2020 we can finally
have discussions about this stuff and

5556
01:45:04,030 --> 01:45:04,040
have discussions about this stuff and
 

5557
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:05,830
have discussions about this stuff and
look kind of peek around the corner and

5558
01:45:05,830 --> 01:45:05,840
look kind of peek around the corner and
 

5559
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:09,790
look kind of peek around the corner and
say well neur link and people others who

5560
01:45:09,790 --> 01:45:09,800
say well neur link and people others who
 

5561
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:11,790
say well neur link and people others who
are doing similar things are going to

5562
01:45:11,790 --> 01:45:11,800
are doing similar things are going to
 

5563
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:13,510
are doing similar things are going to
figure it out they're going to the the

5564
01:45:13,510 --> 01:45:13,520
figure it out they're going to the the
 

5565
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:15,470
figure it out they're going to the the
answers will show up and we just have to

5566
01:45:15,470 --> 01:45:15,480
answers will show up and we just have to
 

5567
01:45:15,480 --> 01:45:17,950
answers will show up and we just have to
be open to interpretation do you think

5568
01:45:17,950 --> 01:45:17,960
be open to interpretation do you think
 

5569
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:19,310
be open to interpretation do you think
there could be an

5570
01:45:19,310 --> 01:45:19,320
there could be an
 

5571
01:45:19,320 --> 01:45:21,149
there could be an
experiment uh centered around

5572
01:45:21,149 --> 01:45:21,159
experiment uh centered around
 

5573
01:45:21,159 --> 01:45:22,750
experiment uh centered around

c-word was totally not uh was almost

5580
01:45:30,990 --> 01:45:31,000
c-word was totally not uh was almost
 

5581
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:32,910
c-word was totally not uh was almost
anti-scientific but now more and more

5582
01:45:32,910 --> 01:45:32,920
anti-scientific but now more and more
 

5583
01:45:32,920 --> 01:45:34,589
anti-scientific but now more and more
people are talking about Consciousness

5584
01:45:34,589 --> 01:45:34,599
people are talking about Consciousness
 

5585
01:45:34,599 --> 01:45:37,470
people are talking about Consciousness
Elon is talking about Consciousness AI

5586
01:45:37,470 --> 01:45:37,480
Elon is talking about Consciousness AI
 

5587
01:45:37,480 --> 01:45:39,510
Elon is talking about Consciousness AI
folks are talking about

5588
01:45:39,510 --> 01:45:39,520
folks are talking about
 

5589
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:41,910
folks are talking about
Consciousness it's it's still nobody

5590
01:45:41,910 --> 01:45:41,920
Consciousness it's it's still nobody
 

5591
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:44,990
Consciousness it's it's still nobody
knows anything but it feels like a

5592
01:45:44,990 --> 01:45:45,000
knows anything but it feels like a
 

5593
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:48,750
knows anything but it feels like a
legitimate domain of inquiry that's

5594
01:45:48,750 --> 01:45:48,760
legitimate domain of inquiry that's
 

5595
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:53,350
legitimate domain of inquiry that's
hungry for a real experiment

5596
01:45:53,350 --> 01:45:53,360
hungry for a real experiment
 

5597
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:54,790
hungry for a real experiment
so I have

5598
01:45:54,790 --> 01:45:54,800
so I have
 

5599
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:57,950
so I have
fortunately three short answers to this

5600
01:45:57,950 --> 01:45:57,960
fortunately three short answers to this
 

5601
01:45:57,960 --> 01:46:01,109
fortunately three short answers to this
um uh the first one is

5602
01:46:01,109 --> 01:46:01,119
um uh the first one is
 

5603
01:46:01,119 --> 01:46:04,470
um uh the first one is
a I'm not I'm not particularly sucin I I

5604

a I'm not I'm not particularly sucin I I
 

5605
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:06,629
a I'm not I'm not particularly sucin I I
agree that no the joke I always tell is

5606
01:46:06,629 --> 01:46:06,639
agree that no the joke I always tell is
 

5607
01:46:06,639 --> 01:46:08,270
agree that no the joke I always tell is
um there two things you never want to

5608
01:46:08,270 --> 01:46:08,280
um there two things you never want to
 

5609
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:10,750
um there two things you never want to
say to a scientist one is uh what do you

5610
01:46:10,750 --> 01:46:10,760
say to a scientist one is uh what do you
 

5611
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:13,149
say to a scientist one is uh what do you
do and the second one is um take as much

5612
01:46:13,149 --> 01:46:13,159
do and the second one is um take as much
 

5613
01:46:13,159 --> 01:46:14,350
do and the second one is um take as much
time as you need and you definitely

5614
01:46:14,350 --> 01:46:14,360
time as you need and you definitely
 

5615
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:15,709
time as you need and you definitely
don't want to say them in the same

5616
01:46:15,709 --> 01:46:15,719
don't want to say them in the same
 

5617
01:46:15,719 --> 01:46:19,189
don't want to say them in the same
sentence um I have three short answers

5618
01:46:19,189 --> 01:46:19,199
sentence um I have three short answers
 

5619
01:46:19,199 --> 01:46:21,669
sentence um I have three short answers
to it so there's a um there's a cynical

5620
01:46:21,669 --> 01:46:21,679
to it so there's a um there's a cynical
 

5621
01:46:21,679 --> 01:46:24,070
to it so there's a um there's a cynical
answer kind of uh and it's not one I

5622
01:46:24,070 --> 01:46:24,080
answer kind of uh and it's not one I
 

5623
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:27,430
answer kind of uh and it's not one I
enjoy giving Which is that um if you

5624
01:46:27,430 --> 01:46:27,440
enjoy giving Which is that um if you
 

5625
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:31,390
enjoy giving Which is that um if you
look into the 70s and back at the 1970s

5626
01:46:31,390 --> 01:46:31,400
look into the 70s and back at the 1970s
 

5627
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:35,189
look into the 70s and back at the 1970s
and 1980s and even into the early 2000s

5628
01:46:35,189 --> 01:46:35,199
and 1980s and even into the early 2000s
 

5629
01:46:35,199 --> 01:46:37,589
and 1980s and even into the early 2000s
there were some very Dynamic um very

5630
01:46:37,589 --> 01:46:37,599
there were some very Dynamic um very
 

5631
01:46:37,599 --> 01:46:40,950
there were some very Dynamic um very
impressive speakers who were very smart

5632
01:46:40,950 --> 01:46:40,960
impressive speakers who were very smart
 

5633
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:42,669
impressive speakers who were very smart
in the field of Neuroscience and related

5634
01:46:42,669 --> 01:46:42,679
in the field of Neuroscience and related
 

5635
01:46:42,679 --> 01:46:44,629
in the field of Neuroscience and related
fields who thought hard about the

5636
01:46:44,629 --> 01:46:44,639
fields who thought hard about the
 

5637
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:48,270
fields who thought hard about the
Consciousness problem and fell in love

5638
01:46:48,270 --> 01:46:48,280
Consciousness problem and fell in love
 

5639
01:46:48,280 --> 01:46:51,470
Consciousness problem and fell in love
with the problem but uh overlooked the

5640
01:46:51,470 --> 01:46:51,480
with the problem but uh overlooked the
 

5641
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:54,470
with the problem but uh overlooked the
fact that the technology wasn't there

5642
01:46:54,470 --> 01:46:54,480
fact that the technology wasn't there
 

5643
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:57,669
fact that the technology wasn't there
yeah so um I admire them for falling in

5644
01:46:57,669 --> 01:46:57,679
yeah so um I admire them for falling in
 

5645
01:46:57,679 --> 01:46:59,990
yeah so um I admire them for falling in
love with the the problem but they

5646
01:46:59,990 --> 01:47:00,000
love with the the problem but they
 

5647
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,390
love with the the problem but they
gleaned

5648
01:47:01,390 --> 01:47:01,400
gleaned
 

5649
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:03,709
gleaned
tremendous taxpayer

5650
01:47:03,709 --> 01:47:03,719
tremendous taxpayer
 

5651
01:47:03,719 --> 01:47:06,310
tremendous taxpayer
resources essentially for nothing and

5652
01:47:06,310 --> 01:47:06,320
resources essentially for nothing and
 

5653
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:07,790
resources essentially for nothing and
these people know who they are some of

5654
01:47:07,790 --> 01:47:07,800
these people know who they are some of
 

5655
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:09,189
these people know who they are some of
them are alive some of them aren't I'm

5656
01:47:09,189 --> 01:47:09,199
them are alive some of them aren't I'm
 

5657
01:47:09,199 --> 01:47:10,589
them are alive some of them aren't I'm
not referring to Francis Crick who was

5658
01:47:10,589 --> 01:47:10,599
not referring to Francis Crick who was
 

5659
01:47:10,599 --> 01:47:11,830
not referring to Francis Crick who was
brilliant by the way and thought the

5660
01:47:11,830 --> 01:47:11,840
brilliant by the way and thought the
 

5661
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:13,589
brilliant by the way and thought the
claustrum was involved in Consciousness

5662
01:47:13,589 --> 01:47:13,599
claustrum was involved in Consciousness
 

5663
01:47:13,599 --> 01:47:15,430
claustrum was involved in Consciousness
which I think is a great idea it's this

5664
01:47:15,430 --> 01:47:15,440
which I think is a great idea it's this
 

5665
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:16,910
which I think is a great idea it's this
obscure structure that no one's really

5666
01:47:16,910 --> 01:47:16,920
obscure structure that no one's really
 

5667
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:18,510
obscure structure that no one's really
studied people are now starting to study

5668
01:47:18,510 --> 01:47:18,520
studied people are now starting to study
 

5669
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:20,589
studied people are now starting to study
it so I think Francis was brilliant and

5670
01:47:20,589 --> 01:47:20,599
it so I think Francis was brilliant and
 

5671
01:47:20,599 --> 01:47:22,430
it so I think Francis was brilliant and
wonderful but there it you know there

5672
01:47:22,430 --> 01:47:22,440
wonderful but there it you know there
 

5673
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:24,709
wonderful but there it you know there
were books written about it it makes for

5674
01:47:24,709 --> 01:47:24,719
were books written about it it makes for
 

5675
01:47:24,719 --> 01:47:29,350
were books written about it it makes for
great television stuff and

5676
01:47:29,350 --> 01:47:29,360
great television stuff and
 

5677
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:31,629
great television stuff and
thought around the table or after a

5678
01:47:31,629 --> 01:47:31,639
thought around the table or after a
 

5679
01:47:31,639 --> 01:47:34,750
thought around the table or after a
couple glasses of wine or whatever um

5680
01:47:34,750 --> 01:47:34,760
couple glasses of wine or whatever um
 

5681
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:36,589
couple glasses of wine or whatever um
it's an important problem nonetheless

5682
01:47:36,589 --> 01:47:36,599
it's an important problem nonetheless
 

5683
01:47:36,599 --> 01:47:38,790
it's an important problem nonetheless
and so I think I do think the

5684
01:47:38,790 --> 01:47:38,800
and so I think I do think the
 

5685
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:40,589
and so I think I do think the
Consciousness the issue is it's not

5686
01:47:40,589 --> 01:47:40,599
Consciousness the issue is it's not
 

5687
01:47:40,599 --> 01:47:42,430
Consciousness the issue is it's not
operationally defined right that

5688
01:47:42,430 --> 01:47:42,440
operationally defined right that
 

5689
01:47:42,440 --> 01:47:45,430
operationally defined right that
psychologists are much smarter than um a

5690
01:47:45,430 --> 01:47:45,440
psychologists are much smarter than um a
 

5691
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:49,270
psychologists are much smarter than um a
lot of uh heart scientists in that for

5692
01:47:49,270 --> 01:47:49,280
lot of uh heart scientists in that for
 

5693
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:51,470
lot of uh heart scientists in that for
the following reason they put

5694
01:47:51,470 --> 01:47:51,480
the following reason they put
 

5695
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:53,070
the following reason they put
operational definitions they know know

5696
01:47:53,070 --> 01:47:53,080
operational definitions they know know
 

5697
01:47:53,080 --> 01:47:54,870
operational definitions they know know
that psychology if we're talking about

5698
01:47:54,870 --> 01:47:54,880
that psychology if we're talking about
 

5699
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:56,270
that psychology if we're talking about
motivation for instance they know they

5700
01:47:56,270 --> 01:47:56,280
motivation for instance they know they
 

5701
01:47:56,280 --> 01:47:57,910
motivation for instance they know they
need to put operational definitions on

5702
01:47:57,910 --> 01:47:57,920
need to put operational definitions on
 

5703
01:47:57,920 --> 01:47:59,709
need to put operational definitions on
that so that two Laboratories can know

5704
01:47:59,709 --> 01:47:59,719
that so that two Laboratories can know
 

5705
01:47:59,719 --> 01:48:01,430
that so that two Laboratories can know
they're studying the same thing the

5706
01:48:01,430 --> 01:48:01,440
they're studying the same thing the
 

5707
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:02,830
they're studying the same thing the
problem with Consciousness is no one can

5708
01:48:02,830 --> 01:48:02,840
problem with Consciousness is no one can
 

5709
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:04,629
problem with Consciousness is no one can
agree on what that is and this was a

5710
01:48:04,629 --> 01:48:04,639
agree on what that is and this was a
 

5711
01:48:04,639 --> 01:48:07,990
agree on what that is and this was a
problem for attention when I was coming

5712
01:48:07,990 --> 01:48:08,000
problem for attention when I was coming
 

5713
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:09,669
problem for attention when I was coming
up so in the early 2000s people would

5714
01:48:09,669 --> 01:48:09,679
up so in the early 2000s people would
 

5715
01:48:09,679 --> 01:48:11,390
up so in the early 2000s people would
argue what is attention is it spatial

5716
01:48:11,390 --> 01:48:11,400
argue what is attention is it spatial
 

5717
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:13,830
argue what is attention is it spatial
attention auditory attention is it and

5718
01:48:13,830 --> 01:48:13,840
attention auditory attention is it and
 

5719
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:15,950
attention auditory attention is it and
finally people were like you know what

5720
01:48:15,950 --> 01:48:15,960
finally people were like you know what
 

5721
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:18,149
finally people were like you know what
we agree have they agreed on that one I

5722
01:48:18,149 --> 01:48:18,159
we agree have they agreed on that one I
 

5723
01:48:18,159 --> 01:48:20,229
we agree have they agreed on that one I
remember sort of I remember hearing

5724
01:48:20,229 --> 01:48:20,239
remember sort of I remember hearing
 

5725
01:48:20,239 --> 01:48:21,870
remember sort of I remember hearing
people scream a lot of tension right

5726
01:48:21,870 --> 01:48:21,880
people scream a lot of tension right
 

5727
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:23,310
people scream a lot of tension right
they couldn't even agree on attention so

5728
01:48:23,310 --> 01:48:23,320
they couldn't even agree on attention so
 

5729
01:48:23,320 --> 01:48:24,669
they couldn't even agree on attention so
I was coming up as a young graduate

5730
01:48:24,669 --> 01:48:24,679
I was coming up as a young graduate
 

5731
01:48:24,679 --> 01:48:26,510
I was coming up as a young graduate
student I'm thinking like I'm definitely

5732
01:48:26,510 --> 01:48:26,520
student I'm thinking like I'm definitely
 

5733
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:28,149
student I'm thinking like I'm definitely
not going to work on attention and I'm

5734
01:48:28,149 --> 01:48:28,159

01:51:09,990 --> 01:51:10,000
good to exceptional to even get through
 

5891
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,270
good to exceptional to even get through
the gate and he's exceptional and then

5892
01:51:12,270 --> 01:51:12,280
the gate and he's exceptional and then
 

5893
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:14,069
the gate and he's exceptional and then
they've got people like Dan Adams who

5894
01:51:14,069 --> 01:51:14,079
they've got people like Dan Adams who
 

5895
01:51:14,079 --> 01:51:16,069
they've got people like Dan Adams who
was at UCSF for a long time he's a good

who is very concrete studied the

5900
01:51:20,069 --> 01:51:20,079
who is very concrete studied the
 

5901
01:51:20,079 --> 01:51:21,709
who is very concrete studied the
vasculature in the eye and how it maps

5902
01:51:21,709 --> 01:51:21,719
vasculature in the eye and how it maps
 

5903
01:51:21,719 --> 01:51:23,510
vasculature in the eye and how it maps
to the vasculature cortex when you get a

5904
01:51:23,510 --> 01:51:23,520
to the vasculature cortex when you get a
 

5905
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:25,629
to the vasculature cortex when you get a
team like that together you're going to

5906
01:51:25,629 --> 01:51:25,639
team like that together you're going to
 

5907
01:51:25,639 --> 01:51:28,149
team like that together you're going to
have denters you're going to have people

5908
01:51:28,149 --> 01:51:28,159
have denters you're going to have people
 

5909
01:51:28,159 --> 01:51:29,870
have denters you're going to have people
that are highlevel thinkers people that

5910
01:51:29,870 --> 01:51:29,880
that are highlevel thinkers people that
 

5911
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:32,550
that are highlevel thinkers people that
are coders when you get a team like that

5912
01:51:32,550 --> 01:51:32,560
are coders when you get a team like that
 

5913
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:34,350
are coders when you get a team like that
it no longer looks like an academic

5914
01:51:34,350 --> 01:51:34,360
it no longer looks like an academic
 

5915
01:51:34,360 --> 01:51:36,510
it no longer looks like an academic
laboratory or even a field in science

5916
01:51:36,510 --> 01:51:36,520
laboratory or even a field in science
 

5917
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:39,149
laboratory or even a field in science
and so I think they're going to solve

5918
01:51:39,149 --> 01:51:39,159
and so I think they're going to solve
 

5919
01:51:39,159 --> 01:51:41,270
and so I think they're going to solve
some really hard problems and again I'm

5920
01:51:41,270 --> 01:51:41,280
some really hard problems and again I'm
 

5921
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:44,709
some really hard problems and again I'm
not here they don't you know I have

5922
01:51:44,709 --> 01:51:44,719
not here they don't you know I have
 

5923
01:51:44,719 --> 01:51:47,470
not here they don't you know I have
nothing in at stake with them but I

5924
01:51:47,470 --> 01:51:47,480
nothing in at stake with them but I
 

5925
01:51:47,480 --> 01:51:49,270
nothing in at stake with them but I
think that's the solution you need a

5926
01:51:49,270 --> 01:51:49,280
think that's the solution you need a
 

5927
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:51,069
think that's the solution you need a
bunch of people who don't need first

think like this I think it's really
important to think about the 100 meter

5964
01:52:33,270 --> 01:52:33,280
important to think about the 100 meter
 

5965
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:35,709
important to think about the 100 meter
and the 100 meter is not even not even

01:52:37,149 --> 01:52:37,159
100 meter but
 

5969
01:52:37,159 --> 01:52:39,589
100 meter but
like like the stuff behind the hill

is it's easy to avoid that room altoe

6048
01:54:14,390 --> 01:54:14,400
is it's easy to avoid that room altoe
 

6049

is it's easy to avoid that room altoe
which is what I mean there's analogies

6050
01:54:16,390 --> 01:54:16,400
which is what I mean there's analogies
 

6051

which is what I mean there's analogies
to everything you've said with the

to everything you've said with the
 

6053
01:54:17,719 --> 01:54:20,069
to everything you've said with the
artificial intelligence Community with

6054
01:54:20,069 --> 01:54:20,079
artificial intelligence Community with
 

6055
01:54:20,079 --> 01:54:23,189
artificial intelligence Community with
the Minsky and even Alan ing that talked

6056
01:54:23,189 --> 01:54:23,199
the Minsky and even Alan ing that talked
 

6057
01:54:23,199 --> 01:54:25,189
the Minsky and even Alan ing that talked
about intelligence a lot and then they

6058
01:54:25,189 --> 01:54:25,199
about intelligence a lot and then they
 

6059
01:54:25,199 --> 01:54:26,629
about intelligence a lot and then they
drew a lot of funding and then it

6060
01:54:26,629 --> 01:54:26,639
drew a lot of funding and then it
 

6061
01:54:26,639 --> 01:54:28,149
drew a lot of funding and then it
crashed because they really didn't do

6062
01:54:28,149 --> 01:54:28,159
crashed because they really didn't do
 

6063
01:54:28,159 --> 01:54:29,950
crashed because they really didn't do
anything with it and it was a lot of

01:54:29,950 --> 01:54:29,960
anything with it and it was a lot of
 

6065
01:54:29,960 --> 01:54:32,030
anything with it and it was a lot of
force of personality and so on but that

and also as you said for the people that
 

6141

things at multiple levels I think one of
 

6155
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,629
things at multiple levels I think one of
the this is um I I don't gripe about my

the this is um I I don't gripe about my

6159
01:56:24,239 --> 01:56:27,109
lab's been fortunate we've been funded
from the start and we've been happy um

6160
01:56:27,109 --> 01:56:27,119
from the start and we've been happy um
 

6161
01:56:27,119 --> 01:56:29,310
from the start and we've been happy um
in that in that regard and lucky and

6162
01:56:29,310 --> 01:56:29,320
in that in that regard and lucky and
 

6163
01:56:29,320 --> 01:56:30,830
in that in that regard and lucky and
we're grateful for that but I think one

6164
01:56:30,830 --> 01:56:30,840
we're grateful for that but I think one
 

6165
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:34,830
we're grateful for that but I think one
of the challenges of research being so

6166
01:56:34,830 --> 01:56:34,840
of the challenges of research being so
 

6167
01:56:34,840 --> 01:56:37,550
of the challenges of research being so
expensive is that there isn't a a lot of

6168
01:56:37,550 --> 01:56:37,560
expensive is that there isn't a a lot of
 

6169
01:56:37,560 --> 01:56:39,910
expensive is that there isn't a a lot of
time especially nowadays for people to

6170
01:56:39,910 --> 01:56:39,920
time especially nowadays for people to
 

6171
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:42,510
time especially nowadays for people to
just convene around a topic because

6172
01:56:42,510 --> 01:56:42,520
just convene around a topic because
 

6173
01:56:42,520 --> 01:56:45,990
just convene around a topic because
there's so much emphasis on productivity

6174
01:56:45,990 --> 01:56:46,000
there's so much emphasis on productivity
 

6175
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,790
there's so much emphasis on productivity
um and so there there actually believe

6176
01:56:47,790 --> 01:56:47,800
um and so there there actually believe
 

6177
01:56:47,800 --> 01:56:48,870
um and so there there actually believe
it or not there aren't that many

6178
01:56:48,870 --> 01:56:48,880
it or not there aren't that many
 

6179

6183
01:56:53,639 --> 01:56:56,669
right now the last 10 years has been
this huge influx of tools and so people

6184
01:56:56,669 --> 01:56:56,679
this huge influx of tools and so people
 

6185
01:56:56,679 --> 01:56:58,109
this huge influx of tools and so people
have been neural circuits and probing

6186
01:56:58,109 --> 01:56:58,119
have been neural circuits and probing
 

6187
01:56:58,119 --> 01:56:59,830
have been neural circuits and probing
around and connectomes it's been

when the Consciousness stuff was more
 

6193
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:08,030
when the Consciousness stuff was more
prominent the seword as you said um what

6194
01:57:08,030 --> 01:57:08,040
prominent the seword as you said um what
 

6195
01:57:08,040 --> 01:57:10,310
prominent the seword as you said um what
was good about that time is that people

6196

was good about that time is that people

01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:11,669
was good about that time is that people
would go to meetings and actually

6198
01:57:11,669 --> 01:57:11,679
would go to meetings and actually
 

6199
01:57:11,679 --> 01:57:14,870
would go to meetings and actually
discuss ideas and models now it's sort

6200
01:57:14,870 --> 01:57:14,880
discuss ideas and models now it's sort
 

6201
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:17,270
discuss ideas and models now it's sort
of like demon it's sort of like

6202
01:57:17,270 --> 01:57:17,280
of like demon it's sort of like
 

6203
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:18,910
of like demon it's sort of like
demonstration day at the school science

6204
01:57:18,910 --> 01:57:18,920
demonstration day at the school science
 

6205
01:57:18,920 --> 01:57:20,350

fair where everyone's got their thing

6206
01:57:20,350 --> 01:57:20,360
fair where everyone's got their thing
 

6207
01:57:20,360 --> 01:57:23,109
fair where everyone's got their thing
and you some stuff is cooler than others

6208
01:57:23,109 --> 01:57:23,119
and you some stuff is cooler than others
 

6209
01:57:23,119 --> 01:57:25,709
and you some stuff is cooler than others
but um I think we're going to see a

6210
01:57:25,709 --> 01:57:25,719
but um I think we're going to see a
 

6211
01:57:25,719 --> 01:57:28,350
but um I think we're going to see a
shift I'm grateful that we have so many

6212
01:57:28,350 --> 01:57:28,360
shift I'm grateful that we have so many
 

6213
01:57:28,360 --> 01:57:31,109
shift I'm grateful that we have so many
computer scientists and theoreticians

6214

computer scientists and theoreticians
 

6215
01:57:31,119 --> 01:57:33,550
computer scientists and theoreticians
and um or theorists I think they call

6216
01:57:33,550 --> 01:57:33,560
and um or theorists I think they call
 

6217
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:36,709
and um or theorists I think they call
themselves um somebody tell me what the

6218
01:57:36,709 --> 01:57:36,719
themselves um somebody tell me what the
 

6219
01:57:36,719 --> 01:57:40,470
themselves um somebody tell me what the
difference is someday um and you know

6220
01:57:40,470 --> 01:57:40,480
difference is someday um and you know
 

6221
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:42,830
difference is someday um and you know
psychology and even dare I say

6222
01:57:42,830 --> 01:57:42,840
psychology and even dare I say
 

6223
01:57:42,840 --> 01:57:44,109

there wasn't even such a thing when I

6230
01:57:49,430 --> 01:57:49,440
there wasn't even such a thing when I
 

6231
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:50,950
there wasn't even such a thing when I
started graduate school or as a postto

6232
01:57:50,950 --> 01:57:50,960
started graduate school or as a postto

01:57:58,350 --> 01:57:58,360
everybody's invited and that's beautiful
 

6239
01:57:58,360 --> 01:58:00,189
everybody's invited and that's beautiful
that means that something's useful is

6240
01:58:00,189 --> 01:58:00,199
that means that something's useful is
 

6241
01:58:00,199 --> 01:58:01,790
that means that something's useful is
going to come up all this and there's

6242
01:58:01,790 --> 01:58:01,800
going to come up all this and there's
 

6243
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:03,430
going to come up all this and there's
also tremendous work of course happening

6244
01:58:03,430 --> 01:58:03,440
also tremendous work of course happening
 

6245
01:58:03,440 --> 01:58:05,069
also tremendous work of course happening
on for the treatment of disease and we

6246
01:58:05,069 --> 01:58:05,079
on for the treatment of disease and we
 

6247
01:58:05,079 --> 01:58:06,550
on for the treatment of disease and we
shouldn't Overlook that that's where you

6248
01:58:06,550 --> 01:58:06,560
shouldn't Overlook that that's where you
 

6249
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:08,629
shouldn't Overlook that that's where you

01:58:10,599 --> 01:58:11,990
reducing suffering is also a huge
initiative in Neuroscience so there's a

6254
01:58:11,990 --> 01:58:12,000
initiative in Neuroscience so there's a
 

6255
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,430
initiative in Neuroscience so there's a
lot of Beauty in the field but the

yeah I I think also from the AI

6266
01:58:29,910 --> 01:58:29,920
yeah I I think also from the AI
 

6267
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:34,109
yeah I I think also from the AI
perspective I so I view the brain as

6268
01:58:34,109 --> 01:58:34,119
perspective I so I view the brain as
 

6269
01:58:34,119 --> 01:58:35,270

sacred uh I think from a neuroscience

6272
01:58:39,030 --> 01:58:39,040
sacred uh I think from a neuroscience
 

6273
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:41,069
sacred uh I think from a neuroscience
perspective you're a little bit more

6274
01:58:41,069 --> 01:58:41,079
perspective you're a little bit more
 

6275
01:58:41,079 --> 01:58:44,709

01:58:44,709 --> 01:58:44,719
sensitive to BS like BS narratives about
 

6277
01:58:44,719 --> 01:58:47,470

6279
01:58:47,480 --> 01:58:50,750
the brain or whatever I'm a little bit
more uh comfortable with just poetic BS

6280
01:58:50,750 --> 01:58:50,760
more uh comfortable with just poetic BS
 

6281
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:52,550
more uh comfortable with just poetic BS
about the brain as long as it helps

6282
01:58:52,550 --> 01:58:52,560
about the brain as long as it helps

engineer intelligence systems well you

6284
01:58:54,990 --> 01:58:55,000
engineer intelligence systems well you
 

6285
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,430
engineer intelligence systems well you
know what I mean well and and I have to

6286
01:58:57,430 --> 01:58:57,440
know what I mean well and and I have to
 

6287
01:58:57,440 --> 01:58:59,589
know what I mean well and and I have to
you know I confess um ignorance when it

6288
01:58:59,589 --> 01:58:59,599
you know I confess um ignorance when it
 

6289
01:58:59,599 --> 01:59:01,589
you know I confess um ignorance when it
comes to you know most things about

6290
01:59:01,589 --> 01:59:01,599
comes to you know most things about
 

6291
01:59:01,599 --> 01:59:03,149
comes to you know most things about
coding and I'm I'm have some

6292
01:59:03,149 --> 01:59:03,159
coding and I'm I'm have some
 

6293
01:59:03,159 --> 01:59:04,750
coding and I'm I'm have some
quantitative ability but I don't have

6294
01:59:04,750 --> 01:59:04,760
quantitative ability but I don't have
 

6295
01:59:04,760 --> 01:59:07,109
quantitative ability but I don't have
strong quantitative leanings and so I I

6296
01:59:07,109 --> 01:59:07,119
strong quantitative leanings and so I I
 

6297
01:59:07,119 --> 01:59:10,030
strong quantitative leanings and so I I
know my limitations too and so I I think

6298
01:59:10,030 --> 01:59:10,040
know my limitations too and so I I think
 

6299
01:59:10,040 --> 01:59:11,950
know my limitations too and so I I think

mean that's that's what we were all
trying to do that's what we were trying

6352
02:00:04,510 --> 02:00:04,520
trying to do that's what we were trying
 

6353
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:09,350
trying to do that's what we were trying
to do so yeah so from the highest

6354
02:00:09,350 --> 02:00:09,360
to do so yeah so from the highest
 

6355
02:00:09,360 --> 02:00:13,270
to do so yeah so from the highest
possible topic of Consciousness to the

6356
02:00:13,270 --> 02:00:13,280
possible topic of Consciousness to the
 

6357
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:17,270
possible topic of Consciousness to the
to the lowest level uh topic of David

6358
02:00:17,270 --> 02:00:17,280
to the lowest level uh topic of David
 

6359
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:19,629
to the lowest level uh topic of David
goggin's uh let's I don't know if it's

6360
02:00:19,629 --> 02:00:19,639
goggin's uh let's I don't know if it's
 

6361
02:00:19,639 --> 02:00:22,629
goggin's uh let's I don't know if it's
low lowlevel he's high perform

6362
02:00:22,629 --> 02:00:22,639
low lowlevel he's high perform
 

6363
02:00:22,639 --> 02:00:25,310
low lowlevel he's high perform
high performance but like low like

6364
02:00:25,310 --> 02:00:25,320
high performance but like low like
 

6365
02:00:25,320 --> 02:00:28,149
high performance but like low like
there's I don't think David has

6366
02:00:28,149 --> 02:00:28,159
there's I don't think David has
 

6367
02:00:28,159 --> 02:00:30,870
there's I don't think David has
a has any time for philosophy let's just

6368
02:00:30,870 --> 02:00:30,880
a has any time for philosophy let's just
 

6369
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:33,589
a has any time for philosophy let's just
put it this way uh well it's I mean I

6370
02:00:33,589 --> 02:00:33,599
put it this way uh well it's I mean I
 

6371
02:00:33,599 --> 02:00:35,109
put it this way uh well it's I mean I
think we can tack it to what we were

6372
02:00:35,109 --> 02:00:35,119
think we can tack it to what we were
 

6373
02:00:35,119 --> 02:00:37,229
think we can tack it to what we were
just saying in a in a in a meaningful

6374
02:00:37,229 --> 02:00:37,239
just saying in a in a in a meaningful
 

6375
02:00:37,239 --> 02:00:40,350
just saying in a in a in a meaningful
way which is whatever goes on in that

6376
02:00:40,350 --> 02:00:40,360
way which is whatever goes on in that
 

6377
02:00:40,360 --> 02:00:43,589
way which is whatever goes on in that
abstraction part of the brain he's

6378
02:00:43,589 --> 02:00:43,599
abstraction part of the brain he's
 

6379
02:00:43,599 --> 02:00:46,310
abstraction part of the brain he's
figured you know he's figured out how to

6380
02:00:46,310 --> 02:00:46,320
figured you know he's figured out how to
 

6381
02:00:46,320 --> 02:00:49,109
figured you know he's figured out how to
dig down in whatever the lyic friction

6382
02:00:49,109 --> 02:00:49,119
dig down in whatever the lyic friction
 

6383
02:00:49,119 --> 02:00:51,310
dig down in whatever the lyic friction
yeah he's figured out how to grab a hold

6384
02:00:51,310 --> 02:00:51,320
yeah he's figured out how to grab a hold
 

6385
02:00:51,320 --> 02:00:52,910
yeah he's figured out how to grab a hold
of that

6386
02:00:52,910 --> 02:00:52,920
of that
 

6387
02:00:52,920 --> 02:00:55,830
of that
Scruff it and send it in the direction

6388
02:00:55,830 --> 02:00:55,840
Scruff it and send it in the direction
 

6389
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:58,149
Scruff it and send it in the direction
that he's decided it needs to go and

6390
02:00:58,149 --> 02:00:58,159
that he's decided it needs to go and
 

6391
02:00:58,159 --> 02:01:00,390
that he's decided it needs to go and
what's Wild is that he's what we're

6392
02:01:00,390 --> 02:01:00,400
what's Wild is that he's what we're
 

6393
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:02,030
what's Wild is that he's what we're
talking about is him doing that to

6394
02:01:02,030 --> 02:01:02,040
talking about is him doing that to
 

6395
02:01:02,040 --> 02:01:04,189
talking about is him doing that to
himself right he's it's like he's

6396
02:01:04,189 --> 02:01:04,199
himself right he's it's like he's
 

6397
02:01:04,199 --> 02:01:06,390
himself right he's it's like he's
scruffing himself and directing himself

6398
02:01:06,390 --> 02:01:06,400
scruffing himself and directing himself
 

6399
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:07,709
scruffing himself and directing himself
in a particular

6400
02:01:07,709 --> 02:01:07,719
in a particular
 

6401
02:01:07,719 --> 02:01:11,189
in a particular
direction and sending himself down that

6402
02:01:11,189 --> 02:01:11,199
direction and sending himself down that
 

6403
02:01:11,199 --> 02:01:13,589
direction and sending himself down that
trajectory and he what's beautiful is

6404
02:01:13,589 --> 02:01:13,599
trajectory and he what's beautiful is
 

6405
02:01:13,599 --> 02:01:16,990
trajectory and he what's beautiful is
that he acknowledges that that process

6406
02:01:16,990 --> 02:01:17,000
that he acknowledges that that process
 

6407
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:20,030
that he acknowledges that that process
is not pretty it doesn't feel

6408
02:01:20,030 --> 02:01:20,040
is not pretty it doesn't feel
 

6409
02:01:20,040 --> 02:01:22,510
is not pretty it doesn't feel
good it's kind of horrible at every

6410
02:01:22,510 --> 02:01:22,520
good it's kind of horrible at every
 

6411
02:01:22,520 --> 02:01:26,149
good it's kind of horrible at every
level but he's created this re rewarding

6412
02:01:26,149 --> 02:01:26,159
level but he's created this re rewarding
 

6413
02:01:26,159 --> 02:01:28,790
level but he's created this re rewarding
element to it and I think that's what's

6414
02:01:28,790 --> 02:01:28,800
element to it and I think that's what's
 

6415
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:31,950
element to it and I think that's what's
so it it's so admirable and it's what so

6416
02:01:31,950 --> 02:01:31,960
so it it's so admirable and it's what so
 

6417
02:01:31,960 --> 02:01:34,669
so it it's so admirable and it's what so
many people crave which is regulation of

6418
02:01:34,669 --> 02:01:34,679
many people crave which is regulation of
 

6419
02:01:34,679 --> 02:01:38,189
many people crave which is regulation of
the self at that level and he practices

6420
02:01:38,189 --> 02:01:38,199
the self at that level and he practices
 

6421
02:01:38,199 --> 02:01:40,990
the self at that level and he practices
I mean there's a ritual to it there's a

6422
02:01:40,990 --> 02:01:41,000
I mean there's a ritual to it there's a
 

6423
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:44,350
I mean there's a ritual to it there's a
every single day like no exceptions

6424
02:01:44,350 --> 02:01:44,360
every single day like no exceptions
 

6425
02:01:44,360 --> 02:01:47,149
every single day like no exceptions
there's a practice aspect to the

6426
02:01:47,149 --> 02:01:47,159
there's a practice aspect to the
 

6427
02:01:47,159 --> 02:01:49,589
there's a practice aspect to the
suffering that he goes through it's

6428
02:01:49,589 --> 02:01:49,599
suffering that he goes through it's
 

6429
02:01:49,599 --> 02:01:51,430
suffering that he goes through it's
principled suffering principled

maybe let's trade goggin stories uh you
 

6471
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:47,270
maybe let's trade goggin stories uh you
from a neuroscience perspective me from

6472
02:02:47,270 --> 02:02:47,280
from a neuroscience perspective me from
 

6473
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:51,149
from a neuroscience perspective me from
a uh self-inflicted pain perspective I

every single day email phone about a
 

6485
02:03:07,320 --> 02:03:09,390
every single day email phone about a
particular 30-day challenge I did that

6486

stretched for a longer of uh push-ups
and pull-ups you made a call out on

6490
02:03:14,790 --> 02:03:14,800
and pull-ups you made a call out on
 

6491

and pull-ups you made a call out on
social media yeah social media actually

tracking some of what you were doing
with these physical challenges and I um

with these physical challenges and I um
 

6501
02:03:24,599 --> 02:03:26,030
with these physical challenges and I um
the hell's wrong with that guy well no I

02:03:26,040 --> 02:03:28,030
the hell's wrong with that guy well no I
think I actually I don't often comment

6504
02:03:28,030 --> 02:03:28,040
think I actually I don't often comment
 

6505
02:03:28,040 --> 02:03:29,109
think I actually I don't often comment
on people's stuff but I think I

6506
02:03:29,109 --> 02:03:29,119
on people's stuff but I think I
 

6507
02:03:29,119 --> 02:03:30,750
on people's stuff but I think I
commented something like uh

6508
02:03:30,750 --> 02:03:30,760
commented something like uh
 

6509
02:03:30,760 --> 02:03:33,149
commented something like uh
neuroplasticity loves a non-negotiable

6510
02:03:33,149 --> 02:03:33,159
neuroplasticity loves a non-negotiable
 

6511
02:03:33,159 --> 02:03:36,109
neuroplasticity loves a non-negotiable
rule no I said a non-negotiable contract

6512
02:03:36,109 --> 02:03:36,119
rule no I said a non-negotiable contract
 

6513
02:03:36,119 --> 02:03:38,550
rule no I said a non-negotiable contract
because at the point where yeah neural

6514
02:03:38,550 --> 02:03:38,560
because at the point where yeah neural
 

6515
02:03:38,560 --> 02:03:40,310
because at the point where yeah neural
neurop plasticity really loves a

6516
02:03:40,310 --> 02:03:40,320
neurop plasticity really loves a
 

6517
02:03:40,320 --> 02:03:43,510
neurop plasticity really loves a
non-negotiable contract because you know

6518
02:03:43,510 --> 02:03:43,520
non-negotiable contract because you know
 

6519
02:03:43,520 --> 02:03:45,589
non-negotiable contract because you know
and I've said this before so forgive me

6520
02:03:45,589 --> 02:03:45,599
and I've said this before so forgive me
 

6521
02:03:45,599 --> 02:03:47,669
and I've said this before so forgive me
but you know the brain is doing analysis

6522
02:03:47,669 --> 02:03:47,679
but you know the brain is doing analysis
 

6523
02:03:47,679 --> 02:03:49,950
but you know the brain is doing analysis
of duration path and outcome and that's

6524
02:03:49,950 --> 02:03:49,960
of duration path and outcome and that's
 

6525
02:03:49,960 --> 02:03:51,990
of duration path and outcome and that's
a lot of work for the brain and more

6526
02:03:51,990 --> 02:03:52,000
a lot of work for the brain and more
 

6527
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,510
a lot of work for the brain and more
that it can pass off duration path and

6528
02:03:54,510 --> 02:03:54,520
that it can pass off duration path and
 

6529
02:03:54,520 --> 02:03:57,669
that it can pass off duration path and
outcome to just reflex the more energy

6530
02:03:57,669 --> 02:03:57,679
outcome to just reflex the more energy
 

6531
02:03:57,679 --> 02:04:00,310
outcome to just reflex the more energy
and and it can allocate to other things

6532
02:04:00,310 --> 02:04:00,320
and and it can allocate to other things
 

6533
02:04:00,320 --> 02:04:03,910
and and it can allocate to other things
so if you decide there's no negotiation

6534
02:04:03,910 --> 02:04:03,920
so if you decide there's no negotiation
 

6535
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:05,830
so if you decide there's no negotiation
about how many push-ups how far I'm

6536
02:04:05,830 --> 02:04:05,840
about how many push-ups how far I'm
 

6537
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:06,990
about how many push-ups how far I'm
going to run how many days how many

6538
02:04:06,990 --> 02:04:07,000
going to run how many days how many
 

6539
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:08,870
going to run how many days how many
pull-ups Etc you actually have more

6540
02:04:08,870 --> 02:04:08,880
pull-ups Etc you actually have more
 

6541
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:11,589
pull-ups Etc you actually have more
energy for push-ups running and pull-ups

6542
02:04:11,589 --> 02:04:11,599
energy for push-ups running and pull-ups
 

6543
02:04:11,599 --> 02:04:12,870
energy for push-ups running and pull-ups
and when you say neuroplastic you mean

6544
02:04:12,870 --> 02:04:12,880
and when you say neuroplastic you mean
 

6545
02:04:12,880 --> 02:04:15,510
and when you say neuroplastic you mean
like the brain once the decision is made

6546
02:04:15,510 --> 02:04:15,520
like the brain once the decision is made
 

6547
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:18,270
like the brain once the decision is made
it'll start rewiring stuff to to make

6548
02:04:18,270 --> 02:04:18,280
it'll start rewiring stuff to to make
 

6549
02:04:18,280 --> 02:04:20,270
it'll start rewiring stuff to to make
sure that this we can actually make this

6550
02:04:20,270 --> 02:04:20,280
sure that this we can actually make this
 

6551
02:04:20,280 --> 02:04:22,149
sure that this we can actually make this
happen that's right I mean so much of

6552
02:04:22,149 --> 02:04:22,159
happen that's right I mean so much of
 

6553
02:04:22,159 --> 02:04:23,669
happen that's right I mean so much of
what we do is reflexive at the level of

6554
02:04:23,669 --> 02:04:23,679
what we do is reflexive at the level of
 

6555
02:04:23,679 --> 02:04:25,430
what we do is reflexive at the level of
just core circuitry breathing heart rate

6556
02:04:25,430 --> 02:04:25,440
just core circuitry breathing heart rate
 

6557
02:04:25,440 --> 02:04:27,750
just core circuitry breathing heart rate
all that that boring stuff digestion but

6558
02:04:27,750 --> 02:04:27,760
all that that boring stuff digestion but
 

6559
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:29,310
all that that boring stuff digestion but
then there's a lot of reflexive stuff

6560
02:04:29,310 --> 02:04:29,320
then there's a lot of reflexive stuff
 

6561
02:04:29,320 --> 02:04:31,270
then there's a lot of reflexive stuff
like how you drink out of a a mug of

6562
02:04:31,270 --> 02:04:31,280
like how you drink out of a a mug of
 

6563
02:04:31,280 --> 02:04:33,350
like how you drink out of a a mug of
coffee that's reflexive too but that you

6564
02:04:33,350 --> 02:04:33,360
coffee that's reflexive too but that you
 

6565
02:04:33,360 --> 02:04:35,549
coffee that's reflexive too but that you
had to learn at some point in your life

6566
02:04:35,549 --> 02:04:35,559
had to learn at some point in your life
 

6567
02:04:35,559 --> 02:04:37,149
had to learn at some point in your life
earlier when you were very little

6568
02:04:37,149 --> 02:04:37,159
earlier when you were very little
 

6569
02:04:37,159 --> 02:04:38,910
earlier when you were very little
analyzing duration path and outcome and

6570
02:04:38,910 --> 02:04:38,920
analyzing duration path and outcome and
 

6571
02:04:38,920 --> 02:04:40,350
analyzing duration path and outcome and
that involved a lot of top down

6572
02:04:40,350 --> 02:04:40,360
that involved a lot of top down
 

6573
02:04:40,360 --> 02:04:42,350
that involved a lot of top down
processing with the prefrontal cortex

6574
02:04:42,350 --> 02:04:42,360
processing with the prefrontal cortex
 

6575

but through plasticity mechanisms you

6576
02:04:44,229 --> 02:04:44,239
but through plasticity mechanisms you
 

6577
02:04:44,239 --> 02:04:46,270
but through plasticity mechanisms you
now do it so when you take on a

6578
02:04:46,270 --> 02:04:46,280
now do it so when you take on a

02:04:55,229 --> 02:04:55,239
else you decided to do once you set the
 

6587
02:04:55,239 --> 02:04:57,629

02:05:00,149 --> 02:05:00,159
then you all you have to do is just go

of just well do I really have to do it

6594
02:05:04,589 --> 02:05:04,599
of just well do I really have to do it
 

6595
02:05:04,599 --> 02:05:05,790
of just well do I really have to do it
how do I not do that what if I get

6596
02:05:05,790 --> 02:05:05,800
how do I not do that what if I get
 

6597
02:05:05,800 --> 02:05:07,390
how do I not do that what if I get
injured what if I you know can I sneak

6601
02:05:10,719 --> 02:05:13,910
at this so that you know and that's work
yeah and to some extent I I look I not

02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:34,310
actual execution well that's a really
like what you're saying was not a lesson

6618
02:05:34,310 --> 02:05:34,320
like what you're saying was not a lesson
 

6619
02:05:34,320 --> 02:05:36,069
like what you're saying was not a lesson
that was obvious to me and it's still

6620
02:05:36,069 --> 02:05:36,079
that was obvious to me and it's still
 

6621
02:05:36,079 --> 02:05:37,510
that was obvious to me and it's still
not obvious it's something I really work

6622
02:05:37,510 --> 02:05:37,520
not obvious it's something I really work
 

6623
02:05:37,520 --> 02:05:42,109
not obvious it's something I really work
at which is there is always an option to

6624
02:05:42,109 --> 02:05:42,119
at which is there is always an option to
 

6625
02:05:42,119 --> 02:05:43,709
at which is there is always an option to
quit

6626
02:05:43,709 --> 02:05:43,719
quit
 

6627
02:05:43,719 --> 02:05:45,709
quit
and I mean that's something I really

6628
02:05:45,709 --> 02:05:45,719
and I mean that's something I really
 

6629
02:05:45,719 --> 02:05:47,510
and I mean that's something I really
struggle with I mean I've quit some

6630
02:05:47,510 --> 02:05:47,520
struggle with I mean I've quit some
 

6631
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:51,990
struggle with I mean I've quit some
things in my life it's like stupid stuff

6632
02:05:51,990 --> 02:05:52,000
things in my life it's like stupid stuff
 

6633
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:53,990
things in my life it's like stupid stuff
and uh one lesson I've

6634
02:05:53,990 --> 02:05:54,000
and uh one lesson I've
 

6635
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:55,750
and uh one lesson I've
learned

6636
02:05:55,750 --> 02:05:55,760
learned
 

6637
02:05:55,760 --> 02:05:59,350
learned
is if you quit once it opens the

6638
02:05:59,350 --> 02:05:59,360
is if you quit once it opens the
 

6639
02:05:59,360 --> 02:06:04,189
is if you quit once it opens the
door that like it's really valuable to

6640
02:06:04,189 --> 02:06:04,199
door that like it's really valuable to
 

6641
02:06:04,199 --> 02:06:06,910
door that like it's really valuable to
trick your brain into

6642
02:06:06,910 --> 02:06:06,920
trick your brain into
 

6643
02:06:06,920 --> 02:06:09,270
trick your brain into
thinking that you you're going to have

6644
02:06:09,270 --> 02:06:09,280
thinking that you you're going to have
 

6645
02:06:09,280 --> 02:06:11,830
thinking that you you're going to have
to die before you quit like it's

6646
02:06:11,830 --> 02:06:11,840
to die before you quit like it's
 

6647
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:13,470
to die before you quit like it's
actually really convenient so actually

6648
02:06:13,470 --> 02:06:13,480
actually really convenient so actually
 

6649
02:06:13,480 --> 02:06:15,189
actually really convenient so actually
what you're saying is very

6650
02:06:15,189 --> 02:06:15,199
what you're saying is very
 

6651
02:06:15,199 --> 02:06:17,430
what you're saying is very
profound but you shouldn't

6652
02:06:17,430 --> 02:06:17,440
profound but you shouldn't
 

6653
02:06:17,440 --> 02:06:21,950
profound but you shouldn't
intellectualize it like

6654
02:06:21,950 --> 02:06:21,960
intellectualize it like
 

6655
02:06:21,960 --> 02:06:24,430
intellectualize it like
it took me time to

6656
02:06:24,430 --> 02:06:24,440
it took me time to
 

6657
02:06:24,440 --> 02:06:27,629
it took me time to

um so I have a friend who was also in

6722
02:07:46,549 --> 02:07:46,559
um so I have a friend who was also in
 

6723
02:07:46,559 --> 02:07:48,350
um so I have a friend who was also in
the teams his name is Pat dosset he did

6724
02:07:48,350 --> 02:07:48,360
the teams his name is Pat dosset he did
 

6725
02:07:48,360 --> 02:07:51,589
the teams his name is Pat dosset he did
nine years in the SEAL Teams um and in a

6726
02:07:51,589 --> 02:07:51,599
nine years in the SEAL Teams um and in a
 

6727
02:07:51,599 --> 02:07:54,549
nine years in the SEAL Teams um and in a
similar way there's there's a lore about

6728
02:07:54,549 --> 02:07:54,559
similar way there's there's a lore about
 

6729
02:07:54,559 --> 02:07:57,430
similar way there's there's a lore about
him among Team guys um because of a kind

6730
02:07:57,430 --> 02:07:57,440
him among Team guys um because of a kind
 

6731
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:59,950
him among Team guys um because of a kind
of funny challenge he gave himself which

6732
02:07:59,950 --> 02:07:59,960
of funny challenge he gave himself which
 

6733
02:07:59,960 --> 02:08:01,629
of funny challenge he gave himself which
was so he and I swim together although

6734
02:08:01,629 --> 02:08:01,639
was so he and I swim together although
 

6735
02:08:01,639 --> 02:08:03,790
was so he and I swim together although
he swims further up front than I do um

6736
02:08:03,790 --> 02:08:03,800
he swims further up front than I do um
 

6737
02:08:03,800 --> 02:08:08,430
he swims further up front than I do um
and he's very patient um but you know he

6738
02:08:08,430 --> 02:08:08,440
and he's very patient um but you know he
 

6739
02:08:08,440 --> 02:08:10,709
and he's very patient um but you know he
was on a he was assigned when he was in

6740
02:08:10,709 --> 02:08:10,719
was on a he was assigned when he was in
 

6741
02:08:10,719 --> 02:08:13,030
was on a he was assigned when he was in
the teams to a position that gave him a

6742
02:08:13,030 --> 02:08:13,040
the teams to a position that gave him a
 

6743
02:08:13,040 --> 02:08:14,470
the teams to a position that gave him a
little more time behind the desk than he

6744
02:08:14,470 --> 02:08:14,480
little more time behind the desk than he
 

6745
02:08:14,480 --> 02:08:16,790
little more time behind the desk than he
wanted and not as much time out out in

6746
02:08:16,790 --> 02:08:16,800
wanted and not as much time out out in
 

6747
02:08:16,800 --> 02:08:19,030
wanted and not as much time out out in
deployments although he did deployments

6748
02:08:19,030 --> 02:08:19,040
deployments although he did deployments
 

6749
02:08:19,040 --> 02:08:20,470
deployments although he did deployments
um so he didn't know what to do at that

6750
02:08:20,470 --> 02:08:20,480
um so he didn't know what to do at that
 

6751
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:22,229
um so he didn't know what to do at that
time but he thought about it and he

6752
02:08:22,229 --> 02:08:22,239
time but he thought about it and he
 

6753
02:08:22,239 --> 02:08:23,950
time but he thought about it and he
asked himself what what does he hate the

6754
02:08:23,950 --> 02:08:23,960
asked himself what what does he hate the
 

6755
02:08:23,960 --> 02:08:26,149
asked himself what what does he hate the
most mhm and it turns out the thing that

6756
02:08:26,149 --> 02:08:26,159
most mhm and it turns out the thing that
 

6757
02:08:26,159 --> 02:08:28,310
most mhm and it turns out the thing that
he hated doing the most was bear crawls

6758
02:08:28,310 --> 02:08:28,320
he hated doing the most was bear crawls
 

6759
02:08:28,320 --> 02:08:30,030
he hated doing the most was bear crawls
you know walking on your hands and knees

6760
02:08:30,030 --> 02:08:30,040
you know walking on your hands and knees
 

6761
02:08:30,040 --> 02:08:32,030
you know walking on your hands and knees
so he decided to Bear crawl for a mile

6762
02:08:32,030 --> 02:08:32,040
so he decided to Bear crawl for a mile
 

6763
02:08:32,040 --> 02:08:33,870
so he decided to Bear crawl for a mile
for time so he was Bear crawling a mile

6764
02:08:33,870 --> 02:08:33,880
for time so he was Bear crawling a mile
 

6765
02:08:33,880 --> 02:08:36,549
for time so he was Bear crawling a mile
a day right and I thought that was an

6766
02:08:36,549 --> 02:08:36,559
a day right and I thought that was an
 

6767
02:08:36,559 --> 02:08:38,350
a day right and I thought that was an
interesting example they gave because

6768
02:08:38,350 --> 02:08:38,360
interesting example they gave because
 

6769
02:08:38,360 --> 02:08:40,030
interesting example they gave because
you know like why pick the thing you

6770
02:08:40,030 --> 02:08:40,040
you know like why pick the thing you
 

6771
02:08:40,040 --> 02:08:42,830
you know like why pick the thing you
hate the most and I think it Maps right

6772
02:08:42,830 --> 02:08:42,840
hate the most and I think it Maps right
 

6773
02:08:42,840 --> 02:08:44,669
hate the most and I think it Maps right
back to lyic friction it's the thing

6774
02:08:44,669 --> 02:08:44,679
back to lyic friction it's the thing
 

6775
02:08:44,679 --> 02:08:47,030
back to lyic friction it's the thing
that creates the most limic friction and

6776
02:08:47,030 --> 02:08:47,040
that creates the most limic friction and
 

6777
02:08:47,040 --> 02:08:49,270
that creates the most limic friction and
so if you can overcome that then there's

6778
02:08:49,270 --> 02:08:49,280
so if you can overcome that then there's
 

6779
02:08:49,280 --> 02:08:51,470
so if you can overcome that then there's
carryover and I think the notion of

6780
02:08:51,470 --> 02:08:51,480
carryover and I think the notion of
 

6781
02:08:51,480 --> 02:08:52,549
carryover and I think the notion of
carryover has been talked about

6782
02:08:52,549 --> 02:08:52,559
carryover has been talked about
 

6783
02:08:52,559 --> 02:08:53,870
carryover has been talked about
psychologically and kind of in the

6784
02:08:53,870 --> 02:08:53,880
psychologically and kind of in the
 

6785
02:08:53,880 --> 02:08:55,510
psychologically and kind of in the
self-help space like oh if you run a

6786
02:08:55,510 --> 02:08:55,520
self-help space like oh if you run a
 

6787
02:08:55,520 --> 02:08:56,790
self-help space like oh if you run a
marathon it's going to help you in other

6788
02:08:56,790 --> 02:08:56,800
marathon it's going to help you in other
 

6789
02:08:56,800 --> 02:08:59,310
marathon it's going to help you in other
areas of life but will it really will it

6790
02:08:59,310 --> 02:08:59,320
areas of life but will it really will it
 

6791
02:08:59,320 --> 02:09:00,589
areas of life but will it really will it
well I think it depends on whether or

6792
02:09:00,589 --> 02:09:00,599
well I think it depends on whether or
 

6793
02:09:00,599 --> 02:09:01,950
well I think it depends on whether or
not there's a lot of lyic friction

6794
02:09:01,950 --> 02:09:01,960
not there's a lot of lyic friction
 

6795
02:09:01,960 --> 02:09:04,149
not there's a lot of lyic friction
because if there is what you're

6796
02:09:04,149 --> 02:09:04,159
because if there is what you're
 

6797
02:09:04,159 --> 02:09:06,390
because if there is what you're
exercising is not a circuit for bear

6798
02:09:06,390 --> 02:09:06,400
exercising is not a circuit for bear
 

6799
02:09:06,400 --> 02:09:08,709
exercising is not a circuit for bear
crawls or a circuit for pull-ups what

6800
02:09:08,709 --> 02:09:08,719
crawls or a circuit for pull-ups what
 

6801
02:09:08,719 --> 02:09:10,270
crawls or a circuit for pull-ups what
you're doing is you're exercising a

6802
02:09:10,270 --> 02:09:10,280
you're doing is you're exercising a
 

6803
02:09:10,280 --> 02:09:12,790
you're doing is you're exercising a
circuit for top- down control and that

6804
02:09:12,790 --> 02:09:12,800
circuit for top- down control and that
 

6805
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:15,069
circuit for top- down control and that
circuit was not designed to be for bear

6806
02:09:15,069 --> 02:09:15,079
circuit was not designed to be for bear
 

6807
02:09:15,079 --> 02:09:17,030
circuit was not designed to be for bear
crawls or pull-ups or

6808

was designed to override lyic friction

6814
02:09:24,310 --> 02:09:24,320
was designed to override lyic friction
 

6815
02:09:24,320 --> 02:09:27,109
was designed to override lyic friction
and so neural circuits were designed to

6816
02:09:27,109 --> 02:09:27,119
and so neural circuits were designed to
 

6817
02:09:27,119 --> 02:09:29,390
and so neural circuits were designed to
generalize right the stress response to

6818
02:09:29,390 --> 02:09:29,400
generalize right the stress response to
 

6819
02:09:29,400 --> 02:09:31,669
generalize right the stress response to
an incoming threat that's a physical

6820

an incoming threat that's a physical
 

6821
02:09:31,679 --> 02:09:34,109
an incoming threat that's a physical
threat was designed to feel the same way

threat was designed to feel the same way
 

6823
02:09:34,119 --> 02:09:36,549
threat was designed to feel the same way
and be the same response internally as

02:09:36,549 --> 02:09:36,559
and be the same response internally as
 

6825
02:09:36,559 --> 02:09:39,109

02:09:43,790 --> 02:09:43,800
that's stressing somebody out and so
 

6831
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:45,709
that's stressing somebody out and so

02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,830
engage a circuit and that circuit is
forever with you and if you don't engage

forever with you and if you don't engage
 

6853

that Circle the internet and social
 

6865
02:10:22,280 --> 02:10:24,430
that Circle the internet and social
media but when you start to think about

02:10:24,430 --> 02:10:24,440
media but when you start to think about
 

6867
02:10:24,440 --> 02:10:25,990
media but when you start to think about
how they map to neural circuits I think

6868
02:10:25,990 --> 02:10:26,000
how they map to neural circuits I think
 

6869
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:27,310
how they map to neural circuits I think
there's some utility because what it

6870
02:10:27,310 --> 02:10:27,320
there's some utility because what it
 

6871
02:10:27,320 --> 02:10:29,750
there's some utility because what it
means is that the lyic friction that

6872
02:10:29,750 --> 02:10:29,760
means is that the lyic friction that
 

6873
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:31,990
means is that the lyic friction that
you'll experience in I don't know maybe

6874
02:10:31,990 --> 02:10:32,000
you'll experience in I don't know maybe
 

6875
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,629
you'll experience in I don't know maybe
some future relationship to something or

6876
02:10:34,629 --> 02:10:34,639
some future relationship to something or

some future relationship to something or
someone it will it's a category of

neural processing that should

6880
02:10:38,990 --> 02:10:39,000
neural processing that should
 

6881
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:40,830
neural processing that should
immediately click into place it's just

6882
02:10:40,830 --> 02:10:40,840
immediately click into place it's just
 

6883
02:10:40,840 --> 02:10:42,750
immediately click into place it's just
like the lyic friction you experienced

6884
02:10:42,750 --> 02:10:42,760
like the lyic friction you experienced
 

6885
02:10:42,760 --> 02:10:45,470
like the lyic friction you experienced
trying to engage in the God knows how

02:10:47,510 --> 02:10:47,520
many uh push-ups pull-ups and and
 

6889
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:49,390
many uh push-ups pull-ups and and
running you uh you know runs you were

02:10:49,390 --> 02:10:49,400
running you uh you know runs you were
 

6891
02:10:49,400 --> 02:10:52,149

getting more followers is you're going
 

6901
02:11:01,199 --> 02:11:03,149
getting more followers is you're going
to get more actually I should say that's

not politically correct for me to ask

6906
02:11:06,709 --> 02:11:06,719
not politically correct for me to ask
 

6907
02:11:06,719 --> 02:11:09,109
not politically correct for me to ask
but like there is this uh stereotype

6908
02:11:09,109 --> 02:11:09,119
but like there is this uh stereotype
 

6909
02:11:09,119 --> 02:11:11,549
but like there is this uh stereotype
about Russians being you know like

6910
02:11:11,549 --> 02:11:11,559
about Russians being you know like
 

6911
02:11:11,559 --> 02:11:13,910
about Russians being you know like
correct no like like like uh like being

6912
02:11:13,910 --> 02:11:13,920
correct no like like like uh like being
 

6913
02:11:13,920 --> 02:11:16,510
correct no like like like uh like being
really um you know durable and and you

6914
02:11:16,510 --> 02:11:16,520
really um you know durable and and you
 

6915
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:19,270
really um you know durable and and you
know I I started going to that Russian B

6916
02:11:19,270 --> 02:11:19,280
know I I started going to that Russian B
 

6917
02:11:19,280 --> 02:11:21,750
know I I started going to that Russian B
that way back uh before Co

6918
02:11:21,750 --> 02:11:21,760
that way back uh before Co
 

6919
02:11:21,760 --> 02:11:24,790
that way back uh before Co
and um they could tolerate a lot of heat

6920
02:11:24,790 --> 02:11:24,800
and um they could tolerate a lot of heat
 

6921
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:26,069
and um they could tolerate a lot of heat
you know and and they would sit very

6922
02:11:26,069 --> 02:11:26,079
you know and and they would sit very
 

6923
02:11:26,079 --> 02:11:27,830
you know and and they would sit very
stoic you know no one was going oh it's

6924
02:11:27,830 --> 02:11:27,840
stoic you know no one was going oh it's
 

6925
02:11:27,840 --> 02:11:29,470
stoic you know no one was going oh it's
hot in here they just kind of like ease

6926
02:11:29,470 --> 02:11:29,480
hot in here they just kind of like ease
 

6927
02:11:29,480 --> 02:11:31,750
hot in here they just kind of like ease
into it um so maybe there's something

6928
02:11:31,750 --> 02:11:31,760
into it um so maybe there's something
 

6929
02:11:31,760 --> 02:11:33,069
into it um so maybe there's something
there who knows there might be something

6930
02:11:33,069 --> 02:11:33,079
there who knows there might be something
 

6931
02:11:33,079 --> 02:11:34,750
there who knows there might be something
there but it could be also just personal

6932
02:11:34,750 --> 02:11:34,760
there but it could be also just personal
 

6933
02:11:34,760 --> 02:11:38,790
there but it could be also just personal
I just have some I found myself

6934
02:11:38,790 --> 02:11:38,800
I just have some I found myself
 

6935
02:11:38,800 --> 02:11:40,750
I just have some I found myself
everyone's different but I've found

6936
02:11:40,750 --> 02:11:40,760
everyone's different but I've found
 

6937
02:11:40,760 --> 02:11:43,750
everyone's different but I've found
myself to be able to do something

6938
02:11:43,750 --> 02:11:43,760
myself to be able to do something
 

6939
02:11:43,760 --> 02:11:46,990
myself to be able to do something
unpleasant for very long periods of time

6940
02:11:46,990 --> 02:11:47,000
unpleasant for very long periods of time
 

6941
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:50,790
unpleasant for very long periods of time
like I'm able to shut off the mind and I

6942
02:11:50,790 --> 02:11:50,800
like I'm able to shut off the mind and I
 

6943
02:11:50,800 --> 02:11:53,270
like I'm able to shut off the mind and I
don't think that's been fully tested and

6944
02:11:53,270 --> 02:11:53,280
don't think that's been fully tested and
 

6945
02:11:53,280 --> 02:11:55,270
don't think that's been fully tested and
I monkey mind or the

6946
02:11:55,270 --> 02:11:55,280
I monkey mind or the
 

6947
02:11:55,280 --> 02:11:57,549
I monkey mind or the
supercomputer uh well it's interesting I

6948
02:11:57,549 --> 02:11:57,559
supercomputer uh well it's interesting I
 

6949
02:11:57,559 --> 02:12:00,750
supercomputer uh well it's interesting I
mean um which mind is which mind tells

6950
02:12:00,750 --> 02:12:00,760
mean um which mind is which mind tells
 

6951
02:12:00,760 --> 02:12:04,589
mean um which mind is which mind tells
you to quit exactly limic limic friction

6952
02:12:04,589 --> 02:12:04,599
you to quit exactly limic limic friction
 

6953
02:12:04,599 --> 02:12:06,510
you to quit exactly limic limic friction
tells you well limic friction is the

6954
02:12:06,510 --> 02:12:06,520
tells you well limic friction is the
 

6955
02:12:06,520 --> 02:12:08,030
tells you well limic friction is the
source of that but what who are you

6956
02:12:08,030 --> 02:12:08,040
source of that but what who are you
 

6957
02:12:08,040 --> 02:12:10,910
source of that but what who are you
talking with exactly so there's a um we

6958
02:12:10,910 --> 02:12:10,920
talking with exactly so there's a um we
 

6959
02:12:10,920 --> 02:12:12,910
talking with exactly so there's a um we
can uh put something very concrete to

6960
02:12:12,910 --> 02:12:12,920
can uh put something very concrete to
 

6961
02:12:12,920 --> 02:12:15,350
can uh put something very concrete to
that so there's a paper publish in cell

6962
02:12:15,350 --> 02:12:15,360
that so there's a paper publish in cell
 

6963
02:12:15,360 --> 02:12:18,149
that so there's a paper publish in cell
you know super top tier Journal uh two

6964
02:12:18,149 --> 02:12:18,159
you know super top tier Journal uh two
 

6965
02:12:18,159 --> 02:12:22,149
you know super top tier Journal uh two
years ago um looking at f

6966
02:12:22,149 --> 02:12:22,159
years ago um looking at f
 

6967
02:12:22,159 --> 02:12:23,990
years ago um looking at f
and this was in a visual environment of

6968
02:12:23,990 --> 02:12:24,000
and this was in a visual environment of
 

6969
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,149
and this was in a visual environment of
trying to swim forward toward a a Target

6970
02:12:26,149 --> 02:12:26,159
trying to swim forward toward a a Target
 

6971
02:12:26,159 --> 02:12:28,030
trying to swim forward toward a a Target
and a reward and it was a really cool

6972
02:12:28,030 --> 02:12:28,040
and a reward and it was a really cool
 

6973
02:12:28,040 --> 02:12:30,069
and a reward and it was a really cool
experiment because they manipulated uh

6974
02:12:30,069 --> 02:12:30,079
experiment because they manipulated uh
 

6975
02:12:30,079 --> 02:12:33,149
experiment because they manipulated uh
virtually the visual environment so um

6976
02:12:33,149 --> 02:12:33,159
virtually the visual environment so um
 

6977
02:12:33,159 --> 02:12:34,549
virtually the visual environment so um
the same amount of effort was being

6978
02:12:34,549 --> 02:12:34,559
the same amount of effort was being
 

6979
02:12:34,559 --> 02:12:36,510
the same amount of effort was being
expended every time but sometimes the

6980
02:12:36,510 --> 02:12:36,520
expended every time but sometimes the
 

6981
02:12:36,520 --> 02:12:37,830
expended every time but sometimes the
perception was you're making forward

6982
02:12:37,830 --> 02:12:37,840
perception was you're making forward
 

6983
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:39,589
perception was you're making forward
progress and sometimes the perception

6984
02:12:39,589 --> 02:12:39,599
progress and sometimes the perception
 

6985
02:12:39,599 --> 02:12:41,750
progress and sometimes the perception
was you're making no progress because

6986
02:12:41,750 --> 02:12:41,760
was you're making no progress because
 

6987
02:12:41,760 --> 02:12:43,390
was you're making no progress because
stuff wasn't Drifting by meant no

6988
02:12:43,390 --> 02:12:43,400
stuff wasn't Drifting by meant no
 

6989
02:12:43,400 --> 02:12:44,950
stuff wasn't Drifting by meant no
progress so you can be swimming and

6990
02:12:44,950 --> 02:12:44,960
progress so you can be swimming and
 

6991
02:12:44,960 --> 02:12:46,950
progress so you can be swimming and
swimming and know making progress and it

6992
02:12:46,950 --> 02:12:46,960
swimming and know making progress and it
 

6993
02:12:46,960 --> 02:12:50,629
swimming and know making progress and it
turns out that with each bout of effort

6994
02:12:50,629 --> 02:12:50,639
turns out that with each bout of effort
 

6995
02:12:50,639 --> 02:12:52,030
turns out that with each bout of effort
there's a

6996
02:12:52,030 --> 02:12:52,040
there's a
 

6997
02:12:52,040 --> 02:12:54,470
there's a
epinephrine and norepinephrine is being

6998
02:12:54,470 --> 02:12:54,480
epinephrine and norepinephrine is being
 

6999
02:12:54,480 --> 02:12:58,149
epinephrine and norepinephrine is being
released in the brain stem and glea the

7000
02:12:58,149 --> 02:12:58,159
released in the brain stem and glea the
 

7001
02:12:58,159 --> 02:12:59,270
released in the brain stem and glea the
what traditionally were thought of a

7002
02:12:59,270 --> 02:12:59,280
what traditionally were thought of a
 

7003
02:12:59,280 --> 02:13:00,750
what traditionally were thought of a
support cells for the neurons but they

7004
02:13:00,750 --> 02:13:00,760
support cells for the neurons but they
 

7005
02:13:00,760 --> 02:13:03,030
support cells for the neurons but they
do a lot of things actively too are

7006
02:13:03,030 --> 02:13:03,040
do a lot of things actively too are
 

7007
02:13:03,040 --> 02:13:05,149
do a lot of things actively too are
measuring the amount of EP epinephrine

7008
02:13:05,149 --> 02:13:05,159
measuring the amount of EP epinephrine
 

7009
02:13:05,159 --> 02:13:06,950
measuring the amount of EP epinephrine
and norepinephrine in that circuit and

7010
02:13:06,950 --> 02:13:06,960
and norepinephrine in that circuit and
 

7011
02:13:06,960 --> 02:13:08,790
and norepinephrine in that circuit and
when it exceeds a certain threshold the

7012
02:13:08,790 --> 02:13:08,800
when it exceeds a certain threshold the
 

7013
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:10,990
when it exceeds a certain threshold the
glea send inhibitory signals that shut

7014
02:13:10,990 --> 02:13:11,000
glea send inhibitory signals that shut
 

7015
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,310
glea send inhibitory signals that shut
down top down control they literally

7016
02:13:13,310 --> 02:13:13,320
down top down control they literally
 

7017
02:13:13,320 --> 02:13:16,310
down top down control they literally
it's the quit you stop there's no no

7018
02:13:16,310 --> 02:13:16,320
it's the quit you stop there's no no
 

7019
02:13:16,320 --> 02:13:18,589
it's the quit you stop there's no no
more it's you quit

7020
02:13:18,589 --> 02:13:18,599
more it's you quit
 

7021
02:13:18,599 --> 02:13:22,310
more it's you quit
enduring it can be rescued endurance can

7022
02:13:22,310 --> 02:13:22,320
enduring it can be rescued endurance can
 

7023
02:13:22,320 --> 02:13:24,189
enduring it can be rescued endurance can
be rescued with

7024
02:13:24,189 --> 02:13:24,199
be rescued with
 

7025
02:13:24,199 --> 02:13:28,030
be rescued with
dopamine uh be so that's where the

7026
02:13:28,030 --> 02:13:28,040
dopamine uh be so that's where the
 

7027
02:13:28,040 --> 02:13:30,350
dopamine uh be so that's where the
subjective part really comes into play

7028
02:13:30,350 --> 02:13:30,360
subjective part really comes into play
 

7029
02:13:30,360 --> 02:13:33,069
subjective part really comes into play
so you quit because um you've learned

7030
02:13:33,069 --> 02:13:33,079
so you quit because um you've learned
 

7031
02:13:33,079 --> 02:13:35,750
so you quit because um you've learned
how to turn that off or you've learned

7032
02:13:35,750 --> 02:13:35,760
how to turn that off or you've learned
 

7033
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:37,830
how to turn that off or you've learned
how to ro some people will reward the

7034
02:13:37,830 --> 02:13:37,840
how to ro some people will reward the
 

7035
02:13:37,840 --> 02:13:40,549
how to ro some people will reward the
pain process so much that friction

7036
02:13:40,549 --> 02:13:40,559
pain process so much that friction
 

7037
02:13:40,559 --> 02:13:42,870
pain process so much that friction
becomes the reward and I you know when

7038
02:13:42,870 --> 02:13:42,880
becomes the reward and I you know when
 

7039
02:13:42,880 --> 02:13:44,549
becomes the reward and I you know when
you talk about people like goggin and

7040
02:13:44,549 --> 02:13:44,559
you talk about people like goggin and
 

7041
02:13:44,559 --> 02:13:46,030
you talk about people like goggin and
other people I know from Special

7042
02:13:46,030 --> 02:13:46,040
other people I know from Special
 

7043
02:13:46,040 --> 02:13:48,750
other people I know from Special
Operations and people have gone through

7044
02:13:48,750 --> 02:13:48,760
Operations and people have gone through
 

7045
02:13:48,760 --> 02:13:51,270
Operations and people have gone through
Cancer Treatments three times you hear

7046
02:13:51,270 --> 02:13:51,280
Cancer Treatments three times you hear
 

7047
02:13:51,280 --> 02:13:52,950
Cancer Treatments three times you hear
about you know just when you hear about

7048
02:13:52,950 --> 02:13:52,960
about you know just when you hear about
 

7049
02:13:52,960 --> 02:13:55,109
about you know just when you hear about
people the Victor Frankle stories I mean

7050
02:13:55,109 --> 02:13:55,119
people the Victor Frankle stories I mean
 

7051
02:13:55,119 --> 02:13:56,750
people the Victor Frankle stories I mean
you hear about Nelson Mandela you hear

7052
02:13:56,750 --> 02:13:56,760
you hear about Nelson Mandela you hear
 

7053
02:13:56,760 --> 02:13:58,709
you hear about Nelson Mandela you hear
about these stories I'm sure the same

7054
02:13:58,709 --> 02:13:58,719
about these stories I'm sure the same
 

7055
02:13:58,719 --> 02:14:00,589
about these stories I'm sure the same
process is involved again this speaks to

7056
02:14:00,589 --> 02:14:00,599
process is involved again this speaks to
 

7057
02:14:00,599 --> 02:14:03,069
process is involved again this speaks to
the generalizability of these processes

7058
02:14:03,069 --> 02:14:03,079
the generalizability of these processes
 

7059
02:14:03,079 --> 02:14:04,589
the generalizability of these processes
as opposed to a neural circuit for a

7060
02:14:04,589 --> 02:14:04,599
as opposed to a neural circuit for a
 

7061
02:14:04,599 --> 02:14:06,910
as opposed to a neural circuit for a
particular action or cognitive function

7062
02:14:06,910 --> 02:14:06,920
particular action or cognitive function
 

7063
02:14:06,920 --> 02:14:09,950
particular action or cognitive function
so I think um you have to learn to

7064
02:14:09,950 --> 02:14:09,960
so I think um you have to learn to
 

7065
02:14:09,960 --> 02:14:11,910
so I think um you have to learn to
subjectively self-reward in a way that

7066
02:14:11,910 --> 02:14:11,920
subjectively self-reward in a way that
 

7067
02:14:11,920 --> 02:14:15,270
subjectively self-reward in a way that
replenishes you uh goggin talks about

7068
02:14:15,270 --> 02:14:15,280
replenishes you uh goggin talks about
 

7069
02:14:15,280 --> 02:14:17,750
replenishes you uh goggin talks about
eating Souls it's a very dramatic

7070
02:14:17,750 --> 02:14:17,760
eating Souls it's a very dramatic
 

7071
02:14:17,760 --> 02:14:20,470
eating Souls it's a very dramatic
example in his mind apparently that's a

7072
02:14:20,470 --> 02:14:20,480
example in his mind apparently that's a
 

7073
02:14:20,480 --> 02:14:22,790
example in his mind apparently that's a
form of reward but it's not just a form

7074
02:14:22,790 --> 02:14:22,800
form of reward but it's not just a form
 

7075
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:25,189
form of reward but it's not just a form
of reward where you're it's like a

7076
02:14:25,189 --> 02:14:25,199
of reward where you're it's like a
 

7077
02:14:25,199 --> 02:14:26,990
of reward where you're it's like a
you're picking up a a trophy or

7078
02:14:26,990 --> 02:14:27,000
you're picking up a a trophy or
 

7079
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:30,510
you're picking up a a trophy or
something it's it's actually it gives

7080
02:14:30,510 --> 02:14:30,520
something it's it's actually it gives
 

7081
02:14:30,520 --> 02:14:32,910
something it's it's actually it gives
energy it's a reward that gives more

7082
02:14:32,910 --> 02:14:32,920
energy it's a reward that gives more
 

7083
02:14:32,920 --> 02:14:35,430
energy it's a reward that gives more
neural energy and I'm defining that as

7084
02:14:35,430 --> 02:14:35,440
neural energy and I'm defining that as
 

7085
02:14:35,440 --> 02:14:37,629
neural energy and I'm defining that as
more dopamine to suppress the nor

7086
02:14:37,629 --> 02:14:37,639
more dopamine to suppress the nor
 

7087
02:14:37,639 --> 02:14:39,790
more dopamine to suppress the nor
adrenaline adrenaline circuits in the

7088
02:14:39,790 --> 02:14:39,800
adrenaline adrenaline circuits in the
 

7089
02:14:39,800 --> 02:14:41,990
adrenaline adrenaline circuits in the
brain Stone so ultimately maps of that

7090
02:14:41,990 --> 02:14:42,000
brain Stone so ultimately maps of that
 

7091
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:45,069
brain Stone so ultimately maps of that
yeah he creates enemies he's always

7092
02:14:45,069 --> 02:14:45,079
yeah he creates enemies he's always
 

7093
02:14:45,079 --> 02:14:47,950
yeah he creates enemies he's always
fighting enemies I never I think I have

7094
02:14:47,950 --> 02:14:47,960
fighting enemies I never I think I have
 

7095
02:14:47,960 --> 02:14:49,390
fighting enemies I never I think I have
enemies but there are usually just

7096
02:14:49,390 --> 02:14:49,400
enemies but there are usually just
 

7097
02:14:49,400 --> 02:14:52,990
enemies but there are usually just
versions of me inside my head uh so I I

7098
02:14:52,990 --> 02:14:53,000
versions of me inside my head uh so I I
 

7099
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:54,470
versions of me inside my head uh so I I
thought about through that 30-day

7100
02:14:54,470 --> 02:14:54,480
thought about through that 30-day
 

7101
02:14:54,480 --> 02:14:57,470
thought about through that 30-day
challenge I tried to come up with like

7102
02:14:57,470 --> 02:14:57,480
challenge I tried to come up with like
 

7103
02:14:57,480 --> 02:14:59,589
challenge I tried to come up with like
fake enemies it wasn't

7104
02:14:59,589 --> 02:14:59,599
fake enemies it wasn't
 

7105
02:14:59,599 --> 02:15:03,149
fake enemies it wasn't
working the only enemy I came up with is

7106
02:15:03,149 --> 02:15:03,159
working the only enemy I came up with is
 

7107
02:15:03,159 --> 02:15:05,790
working the only enemy I came up with is
David well now you have you certainly

7108
02:15:05,790 --> 02:15:05,800
David well now you have you certainly
 

7109
02:15:05,800 --> 02:15:09,069
David well now you have you certainly
have a a a form formidable adversary in

7110
02:15:09,069 --> 02:15:09,079
have a a a form formidable adversary in
 

7111
02:15:09,079 --> 02:15:11,589
have a a a form formidable adversary in
this one I don't care I'm David I'm

7112
02:15:11,589 --> 02:15:11,599
this one I don't care I'm David I'm
 

7113
02:15:11,599 --> 02:15:13,910
this one I don't care I'm David I'm
willing to die on this one so let's go

7114
02:15:13,910 --> 02:15:13,920
willing to die on this one so let's go
 

7115
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:17,189
willing to die on this one so let's go
there uh but well let's hope you you

7116
02:15:17,189 --> 02:15:17,199
there uh but well let's hope you you
 

7117
02:15:17,199 --> 02:15:20,390
there uh but well let's hope you you
both uh uh both survive this um this one

7118
02:15:20,390 --> 02:15:20,400
both uh uh both survive this um this one
 

7119
02:15:20,400 --> 02:15:22,790
both uh uh both survive this um this one
but my problem is the physical there's

7120
02:15:22,790 --> 02:15:22,800
but my problem is the physical there's
 

7121
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:24,030
but my problem is the physical there's
uh so everything we've been talking

7122
02:15:24,030 --> 02:15:24,040
uh so everything we've been talking
 

7123
02:15:24,040 --> 02:15:27,109
uh so everything we've been talking
about in the mind there's a physical

7124
02:15:27,109 --> 02:15:27,119
about in the mind there's a physical
 

7125
02:15:27,119 --> 02:15:29,069
about in the mind there's a physical
aspect that's just practically difficult

7126
02:15:29,069 --> 02:15:29,079
aspect that's just practically difficult
 

7127
02:15:29,079 --> 02:15:32,390
aspect that's just practically difficult
which is like I can't like you know when

7128
02:15:32,390 --> 02:15:32,400
which is like I can't like you know when
 

7129
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:34,390
which is like I can't like you know when
you injure yourself at a certain point

7130
02:15:34,390 --> 02:15:34,400
you injure yourself at a certain point
 

7131
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:36,549
you injure yourself at a certain point
like you just can't function or you're

7132
02:15:36,549 --> 02:15:36,559
like you just can't function or you're
 

7133
02:15:36,559 --> 02:15:38,470
like you just can't function or you're
doing more damage you're talking about

7134
02:15:38,470 --> 02:15:38,480
doing more damage you're talking about
 

7135
02:15:38,480 --> 02:15:40,950
doing more damage you're talking about
it taking yourself out of running for

7136
02:15:40,950 --> 02:15:40,960
it taking yourself out of running for
 

7137
02:15:40,960 --> 02:15:43,470
it taking yourself out of running for
yeah um for the the rest of your life

7138
02:15:43,470 --> 02:15:43,480
yeah um for the the rest of your life
 

7139
02:15:43,480 --> 02:15:45,470
yeah um for the the rest of your life
potentially or like you know or for

7140
02:15:45,470 --> 02:15:45,480
potentially or like you know or for
 

7141
02:15:45,480 --> 02:15:49,229
potentially or like you know or for
years so you know I'd love to avoid

7142
02:15:49,229 --> 02:15:49,239
years so you know I'd love to avoid
 

7143
02:15:49,239 --> 02:15:51,629
years so you know I'd love to avoid
that right there's just like stupid

7144
02:15:51,629 --> 02:15:51,639
that right there's just like stupid
 

7145
02:15:51,639 --> 02:15:53,109
that right there's just like stupid
physical stuff that you just want to

7146
02:15:53,109 --> 02:15:53,119
physical stuff that you just want to
 

7147
02:15:53,119 --> 02:15:55,629
physical stuff that you just want to
avoid you want to keep it purely in the

7148
02:15:55,629 --> 02:15:55,639
avoid you want to keep it purely in the
 

7149
02:15:55,639 --> 02:15:58,149
avoid you want to keep it purely in the
mental and if it's purely in the mental

7150
02:15:58,149 --> 02:15:58,159
mental and if it's purely in the mental
 

7151
02:15:58,159 --> 02:16:00,430
mental and if it's purely in the mental
that's when the race is interesting but

7152
02:16:00,430 --> 02:16:00,440
that's when the race is interesting but
 

7153
02:16:00,440 --> 02:16:01,830
that's when the race is interesting but
yeah the the the problem with these

7154
02:16:01,830 --> 02:16:01,840
yeah the the the problem with these
 

7155
02:16:01,840 --> 02:16:03,990
yeah the the the problem with these
physical challenges as as David has

7156
02:16:03,990 --> 02:16:04,000
physical challenges as as David has
 

7157
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,510
physical challenges as as David has
experienced I mean it has a toll on your

7158
02:16:06,510 --> 02:16:06,520
experienced I mean it has a toll on your
 

7159
02:16:06,520 --> 02:16:09,310
experienced I mean it has a toll on your
body I tend to think of the mind is

7160
02:16:09,310 --> 02:16:09,320
body I tend to think of the mind is
 

7161
02:16:09,320 --> 02:16:11,510
body I tend to think of the mind is
Limitless and the body is kind of

7162
02:16:11,510 --> 02:16:11,520
Limitless and the body is kind of
 

7163
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:14,069
Limitless and the body is kind of
unfortunately quite limited well I think

7164
02:16:14,069 --> 02:16:14,079
unfortunately quite limited well I think
 

7165
02:16:14,079 --> 02:16:16,109
unfortunately quite limited well I think
the key is to dynamically control your

7166
02:16:16,109 --> 02:16:16,119
the key is to dynamically control your
 

7167
02:16:16,119 --> 02:16:18,990
the key is to dynamically control your
output and that can be done by reducing

7168
02:16:18,990 --> 02:16:19,000
output and that can be done by reducing
 

7169
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,750
output and that can be done by reducing
effort which doesn't work for for

7170
02:16:21,750 --> 02:16:21,760
effort which doesn't work for for
 

7171
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:26,430
effort which doesn't work for for
throughout but also by um restoring

7172
02:16:26,430 --> 02:16:26,440
throughout but also by um restoring
 

7173
02:16:26,440 --> 02:16:28,430
throughout but also by um restoring
through these uh subjective reward

7174
02:16:28,430 --> 02:16:28,440
through these uh subjective reward
 

7175
02:16:28,440 --> 02:16:30,870
through these uh subjective reward
processes and and we don't want to go

7176
02:16:30,870 --> 02:16:30,880
processes and and we don't want to go
 

7177
02:16:30,880 --> 02:16:32,469
processes and and we don't want to go
down the rabbit hole of why this all

7178
02:16:32,469 --> 02:16:32,479
down the rabbit hole of why this all
 

7179
02:16:32,479 --> 02:16:34,309
down the rabbit hole of why this all
works but these are ancient Pathways

7180
02:16:34,309 --> 02:16:34,319
works but these are ancient Pathways
 

7181
02:16:34,319 --> 02:16:37,030
works but these are ancient Pathways
that were designed to bring resources to

7182
02:16:37,030 --> 02:16:37,040
that were designed to bring resources to
 

7183
02:16:37,040 --> 02:16:38,629
that were designed to bring resources to
an animal or to a person through

7184
02:16:38,629 --> 02:16:38,639
an animal or to a person through
 

7185
02:16:38,639 --> 02:16:41,830
an animal or to a person through
foraging for hunting or mates or water

7186
02:16:41,830 --> 02:16:41,840
foraging for hunting or mates or water
 

7187
02:16:41,840 --> 02:16:44,190
foraging for hunting or mates or water
all these things and they work so well

7188
02:16:44,190 --> 02:16:44,200
all these things and they work so well
 

7189
02:16:44,200 --> 02:16:46,509
all these things and they work so well
because they're down in those uh uh

7190
02:16:46,509 --> 02:16:46,519
because they're down in those uh uh
 

7191
02:16:46,519 --> 02:16:47,910
because they're down in those uh uh
circuits where we know the zeros and

7192
02:16:47,910 --> 02:16:47,920
circuits where we know the zeros and
 

7193
02:16:47,920 --> 02:16:51,030
circuits where we know the zeros and
ones and that's great because it can be

7194
02:16:51,030 --> 02:16:51,040
ones and that's great because it can be
 

7195
02:16:51,040 --> 02:16:53,349
ones and that's great because it can be
subjective at the level of oh I reached

7196
02:16:53,349 --> 02:16:53,359
subjective at the level of oh I reached
 

7197
02:16:53,359 --> 02:16:56,110
subjective at the level of oh I reached
this one uh Milestone this one horizon

7198
02:16:56,110 --> 02:16:56,120
this one uh Milestone this one horizon
 

7199
02:16:56,120 --> 02:16:59,309
this one uh Milestone this one horizon
this one 3 meter Target but if you don't

7200
02:16:59,309 --> 02:16:59,319
this one 3 meter Target but if you don't
 

7201
02:16:59,319 --> 02:17:02,349
this one 3 meter Target but if you don't
reward it you it's just effort if you do

7202
02:17:02,349 --> 02:17:02,359
reward it you it's just effort if you do
 

7203
02:17:02,359 --> 02:17:06,429
reward it you it's just effort if you do
self-reward it it's effort minus one in

7204
02:17:06,429 --> 02:17:06,439
self-reward it it's effort minus one in
 

7205
02:17:06,439 --> 02:17:08,750
self-reward it it's effort minus one in
terms of the adrenaline

7206
02:17:08,750 --> 02:17:08,760
terms of the adrenaline
 

7207
02:17:08,760 --> 02:17:12,110
terms of the adrenaline
output I have to uh ask you about this

7208
02:17:12,110 --> 02:17:12,120
output I have to uh ask you about this
 

7209
02:17:12,120 --> 02:17:16,030
output I have to uh ask you about this

uh in places like Stanford and places
 

7251
02:18:08,200 --> 02:18:12,709
uh in places like Stanford and places
like MIT as uh one of the most magical

7252
02:18:12,709 --> 02:18:12,719
like MIT as uh one of the most magical
 

7253

7423
02:21:34,439 --> 02:21:36,910
tools that map to things that we're
doing in our lab so these will be tools

7424
02:21:36,910 --> 02:21:36,920
doing in our lab so these will be tools
 

7425
02:21:36,920 --> 02:21:39,429
doing in our lab so these will be tools
um centered around how to um understand

7426
02:21:39,429 --> 02:21:39,439
um centered around how to um understand
 

7427
02:21:39,439 --> 02:21:41,550
um centered around how to um understand

so reduce stress raise one's stress
threshold so it's not always just about

7432
02:21:45,630 --> 02:21:45,640
threshold so it's not always just about
 

7433
02:21:45,640 --> 02:21:47,150
threshold so it's not always just about
being calm sometimes it's about learning

7434
02:21:47,150 --> 02:21:47,160
being calm sometimes it's about learning
 

7435
02:21:47,160 --> 02:21:50,750
being calm sometimes it's about learning
how to tolerate not being not calm um

7436
02:21:50,750 --> 02:21:50,760
how to tolerate not being not calm um
 

7437
02:21:50,760 --> 02:21:52,950
how to tolerate not being not calm um
raise awareness for mental health I me

7438
02:21:52,950 --> 02:21:52,960
raise awareness for mental health I me
 

7439
02:21:52,960 --> 02:21:55,429

there's a ton of micro missions in this
 

7441
02:21:55,439 --> 02:21:58,710
there's a ton of micro missions in this
but it all really Maps back to you know

7442
02:21:58,710 --> 02:21:58,720
but it all really Maps back to you know
 

7443
02:21:58,720 --> 02:22:00,830

come into school on Monday and I would
ask if I could talk about it to the

ask if I could talk about it to the
 

7459

02:27:32,359 --> 02:27:35,389
we can pull from the past and the
present and future um it's why examples

7734
02:27:35,389 --> 02:27:35,399
present and future um it's why examples
 

7735
02:27:35,399 --> 02:27:37,630
present and future um it's why examples
like Nelson Mandela and Victor Frankle

7736
02:27:37,630 --> 02:27:37,640
like Nelson Mandela and Victor Frankle
 

7737
02:27:37,640 --> 02:27:40,150
like Nelson Mandela and Victor Frankle
had to include it makes sense that it

7738
02:27:40,150 --> 02:27:40,160
had to include it makes sense that it
 

7739
02:27:40,160 --> 02:27:41,990
had to include it makes sense that it
wasn't just about grinding it out they

7740
02:27:41,990 --> 02:27:42,000
wasn't just about grinding it out they
 

7741
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:43,830
wasn't just about grinding it out they
had to find those dopamine rewards even

7742
02:27:43,830 --> 02:27:43,840
had to find those dopamine rewards even
 

7743
02:27:43,840 --> 02:27:46,030
had to find those dopamine rewards even
in those little boxes they were forced

7744
02:27:46,030 --> 02:27:46,040
in those little boxes they were forced
 

7745
02:27:46,040 --> 02:27:48,030
in those little boxes they were forced
into

7746
02:27:48,030 --> 02:27:48,040
into
 

7747
02:27:48,040 --> 02:27:50,910
into
so I'm not trying to dodge any answer

7748
02:27:50,910 --> 02:27:50,920
so I'm not trying to dodge any answer
 

7749
02:27:50,920 --> 02:27:53,429
so I'm not trying to dodge any answer
but for me personally and I think about

7750
02:27:53,429 --> 02:27:53,439
but for me personally and I think about
 

7751
02:27:53,439 --> 02:27:56,070
but for me personally and I think about
this a lot because I have this

7752
02:27:56,070 --> 02:27:56,080
this a lot because I have this
 

7753
02:27:56,080 --> 02:27:59,190
this a lot because I have this
um complicated history in science where

7754
02:27:59,190 --> 02:27:59,200
um complicated history in science where
 

7755
02:27:59,200 --> 02:28:01,630
um complicated history in science where
my undergraduate graduate adviser and

7756
02:28:01,630 --> 02:28:01,640
my undergraduate graduate adviser and
 

7757
02:28:01,640 --> 02:28:05,110
my undergraduate graduate adviser and
post-doctoral adviser all died young so

7758
02:28:05,110 --> 02:28:05,120
post-doctoral adviser all died young so
 

7759
02:28:05,120 --> 02:28:06,790
post-doctoral adviser all died young so
uh you know and they were wonderful

7760
02:28:06,790 --> 02:28:06,800
uh you know and they were wonderful
 

7761
02:28:06,800 --> 02:28:08,910
uh you know and they were wonderful
people and had immense importance in my

7762
02:28:08,910 --> 02:28:08,920
people and had immense importance in my
 

7763
02:28:08,920 --> 02:28:13,150
people and had immense importance in my
life but what I realized is

7764
02:28:13,150 --> 02:28:13,160
life but what I realized is
 

7765
02:28:13,160 --> 02:28:16,309
life but what I realized is
that be we can get so fixated on the

7766
02:28:16,309 --> 02:28:16,319
that be we can get so fixated on the
 

7767
02:28:16,319 --> 02:28:17,950
that be we can get so fixated on the
thing that we're experiencing holding

7768
02:28:17,950 --> 02:28:17,960
thing that we're experiencing holding
 

7769
02:28:17,960 --> 02:28:20,550
thing that we're experiencing holding
tremendous meaning but it only holds s

7770
02:28:20,550 --> 02:28:20,560
tremendous meaning but it only holds s
 

7771
02:28:20,560 --> 02:28:22,429
tremendous meaning but it only holds s
that meaning for as long as we're in

7772
02:28:22,429 --> 02:28:22,439
that meaning for as long as we're in
 

7773
02:28:22,439 --> 02:28:26,429
that meaning for as long as we're in
that SpaceTime regime and this is

7774
02:28:26,429 --> 02:28:26,439
that SpaceTime regime and this is
 

7775
02:28:26,439 --> 02:28:28,990
that SpaceTime regime and this is
important because what really gives

7776
02:28:28,990 --> 02:28:29,000
important because what really gives
 

7777
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,389
important because what really gives
meaning is the understanding that you

7778
02:28:31,389 --> 02:28:31,399
meaning is the understanding that you
 

7779
02:28:31,399 --> 02:28:32,990
meaning is the understanding that you
can move between these different

7780
02:28:32,990 --> 02:28:33,000
can move between these different
 

7781
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,429
can move between these different
space-time dimensionalities and I'm not

7782
02:28:35,429 --> 02:28:35,439
space-time dimensionalities and I'm not
 

7783
02:28:35,439 --> 02:28:37,070
space-time dimensionalities and I'm not
trying to sound like a theoretical

7784
02:28:37,070 --> 02:28:37,080
trying to sound like a theoretical
 

7785
02:28:37,080 --> 02:28:39,630
trying to sound like a theoretical
physicist or anyone that thinks about

7786
02:28:39,630 --> 02:28:39,640
physicist or anyone that thinks about
 

7787
02:28:39,640 --> 02:28:42,550
physicist or anyone that thinks about
the cosmos in saying that it's really

7788
02:28:42,550 --> 02:28:42,560
the cosmos in saying that it's really
 

7789
02:28:42,560 --> 02:28:45,269
the cosmos in saying that it's really
the fact that sometimes we say and do

7790
02:28:45,269 --> 02:28:45,279
the fact that sometimes we say and do
 

7791
02:28:45,279 --> 02:28:46,910
the fact that sometimes we say and do
and think things and it feels so

7792
02:28:46,910 --> 02:28:46,920
and think things and it feels so
 

7793
02:28:46,920 --> 02:28:48,910
and think things and it feels so
important and then two days later we're

7794
02:28:48,910 --> 02:28:48,920
important and then two days later we're
 

7795
02:28:48,920 --> 02:28:50,550
important and then two days later we're
like what

7796
02:28:50,550 --> 02:28:50,560
like what
 

7797
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:52,790
like what
what happened well you had a different

7798
02:28:52,790 --> 02:28:52,800
what happened well you had a different
 

7799
02:28:52,800 --> 02:28:55,349
what happened well you had a different
brain processing algorithm entirely you

7800
02:28:55,349 --> 02:28:55,359
brain processing algorithm entirely you
 

7801
02:28:55,359 --> 02:28:57,349
brain processing algorithm entirely you
were in a completely different state and

7802
02:28:57,349 --> 02:28:57,359
were in a completely different state and
 

7803
02:28:57,359 --> 02:28:59,230
were in a completely different state and
so what I want to do in this lifetime is

7804
02:28:59,230 --> 02:28:59,240
so what I want to do in this lifetime is
 

7805
02:28:59,240 --> 02:29:00,510
so what I want to do in this lifetime is
I want

7806
02:29:00,510 --> 02:29:00,520
I want
 

7807
02:29:00,520 --> 02:29:05,030
I want
to I want to engage in as many different

7808
02:29:05,030 --> 02:29:05,040
to I want to engage in as many different
 

7809
02:29:05,040 --> 02:29:07,910
to I want to engage in as many different
levels of contraction and dilation of

7810
02:29:07,910 --> 02:29:07,920
levels of contraction and dilation of
 

7811
02:29:07,920 --> 02:29:10,630
levels of contraction and dilation of
meaning as possible I want to go to the

7812
02:29:10,630 --> 02:29:10,640
meaning as possible I want to go to the
 

7813
02:29:10,640 --> 02:29:12,510
meaning as possible I want to go to the
micro I sometimes think about this I'm

7814
02:29:12,510 --> 02:29:12,520
micro I sometimes think about this I'm
 

7815
02:29:12,520 --> 02:29:13,750
micro I sometimes think about this I'm
like if I just pulled over the side of

7816
02:29:13,750 --> 02:29:13,760
like if I just pulled over the side of
 

7817
02:29:13,760 --> 02:29:15,349
like if I just pulled over the side of
the road I bet you there's an ant hill

7818
02:29:15,349 --> 02:29:15,359
the road I bet you there's an ant hill
 

7819
02:29:15,359 --> 02:29:16,710
the road I bet you there's an ant hill
there and their whole world is

7820
02:29:16,710 --> 02:29:16,720
there and their whole world is
 

7821
02:29:16,720 --> 02:29:19,510
there and their whole world is
fascinating you can't stay there and you

7822
02:29:19,510 --> 02:29:19,520
fascinating you can't stay there and you
 

7823
02:29:19,520 --> 02:29:21,550
fascinating you can't stay there and you
also can't stay staring up at the clouds

7824
02:29:21,550 --> 02:29:21,560
also can't stay staring up at the clouds
 

7825
02:29:21,560 --> 02:29:23,070
also can't stay staring up at the clouds
and just think about how we're just

7826
02:29:23,070 --> 02:29:23,080
and just think about how we're just
 

7827
02:29:23,080 --> 02:29:24,670
and just think about how we're just
these little beings and it doesn't

7828
02:29:24,670 --> 02:29:24,680
these little beings and it doesn't
 

7829
02:29:24,680 --> 02:29:27,710
these little beings and it doesn't
matter the key is the journey back and

7830
02:29:27,710 --> 02:29:27,720
matter the key is the journey back and
 

7831
02:29:27,720 --> 02:29:31,190
matter the key is the journey back and
forth up and down that staircase back

7832
02:29:31,190 --> 02:29:31,200
forth up and down that staircase back
 

7833
02:29:31,200 --> 02:29:32,710
forth up and down that staircase back
and forth and back and forth and my goal

7834
02:29:32,710 --> 02:29:32,720
and forth and back and forth and my goal
 

7835
02:29:32,720 --> 02:29:34,630
and forth and back and forth and my goal
is to get as many trips up and down that

7836
02:29:34,630 --> 02:29:34,640
is to get as many trips up and down that
 

7837
02:29:34,640 --> 02:29:36,790
is to get as many trips up and down that
St staircase as I can before the reaper

7838
02:29:36,790 --> 02:29:36,800
St staircase as I can before the reaper
 

7839
02:29:36,800 --> 02:29:39,550
St staircase as I can before the reaper
comes for me oh beautiful so the the the

7840
02:29:39,550 --> 02:29:39,560
comes for me oh beautiful so the the the
 

7841
02:29:39,560 --> 02:29:41,990
comes for me oh beautiful so the the the
dance of dilation and contraction

7842
02:29:41,990 --> 02:29:42,000
dance of dilation and contraction
 

7843
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,429
dance of dilation and contraction
between the different SP zoom in zoom

7844
02:29:44,429 --> 02:29:44,439
between the different SP zoom in zoom
 

7845
02:29:44,439 --> 02:29:47,990
between the different SP zoom in zoom
out and uh get as many steps in on on

7846
02:29:47,990 --> 02:29:48,000
out and uh get as many steps in on on
 

7847
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:48,750
out and uh get as many steps in on on
that

7848
02:29:48,750 --> 02:29:48,760
that
 

7849
02:29:48,760 --> 02:29:51,269
that
staircase that's that's my goal anyway

7850
02:29:51,269 --> 02:29:51,279
staircase that's that's my goal anyway
 

7851
02:29:51,279 --> 02:29:52,910
staircase that's that's my goal anyway
and I've watched people die I watched my

7852
02:29:52,910 --> 02:29:52,920
and I've watched people die I watched my
 

7853
02:29:52,920 --> 02:29:55,630
and I've watched people die I watched my
postto advisor die wither away my

7854
02:29:55,630 --> 02:29:55,640
postto advisor die wither away my
 

7855
02:29:55,640 --> 02:29:58,150
postto advisor die wither away my
graduate it was tragic but they found

7856
02:29:58,150 --> 02:29:58,160
graduate it was tragic but they found
 

7857
02:29:58,160 --> 02:30:00,630
graduate it was tragic but they found
beauty in these closing moments because

7858
02:30:00,630 --> 02:30:00,640
beauty in these closing moments because
 

7859
02:30:00,640 --> 02:30:03,950
beauty in these closing moments because
their bubble was their kids in one case

7860
02:30:03,950 --> 02:30:03,960
their bubble was their kids in one case
 

7861
02:30:03,960 --> 02:30:06,550
their bubble was their kids in one case
or like one of them was a Giants fan and

7862
02:30:06,550 --> 02:30:06,560
or like one of them was a Giants fan and
 

7863
02:30:06,560 --> 02:30:08,309
or like one of them was a Giants fan and
like got to see a Giants game you know

7864
02:30:08,309 --> 02:30:08,319
like got to see a Giants game you know
 

7865
02:30:08,319 --> 02:30:11,230
like got to see a Giants game you know
in her last moments and like and you

7866
02:30:11,230 --> 02:30:11,240
in her last moments and like and you
 

7867
02:30:11,240 --> 02:30:12,710
in her last moments and like and you
just realize like it's a Giants game but

7868
02:30:12,710 --> 02:30:12,720
just realize like it's a Giants game but
 

7869
02:30:12,720 --> 02:30:14,550
just realize like it's a Giants game but
not in that moment because time is

7870
02:30:14,550 --> 02:30:14,560
not in that moment because time is
 

7871
02:30:14,560 --> 02:30:16,750
not in that moment because time is
closing and so those time bins feel huge

7872
02:30:16,750 --> 02:30:16,760
closing and so those time bins feel huge
 

7873
02:30:16,760 --> 02:30:18,309
closing and so those time bins feel huge
because she's slicing things so

7874
02:30:18,309 --> 02:30:18,319
because she's slicing things so
 

7875
02:30:18,319 --> 02:30:22,269
because she's slicing things so
differently so I I think um learning how

7876
02:30:22,269 --> 02:30:22,279
differently so I I think um learning how
 

7877
02:30:22,279 --> 02:30:24,469
differently so I I think um learning how
to do that better and more fluidly

7878
02:30:24,469 --> 02:30:24,479
to do that better and more fluidly
 

7879
02:30:24,479 --> 02:30:27,950
to do that better and more fluidly
recognizing where one is and not getting

7880
02:30:27,950 --> 02:30:27,960
recognizing where one is and not getting
 

7881
02:30:27,960 --> 02:30:30,070
recognizing where one is and not getting
too tacked to the idea that there's one

7882
02:30:30,070 --> 02:30:30,080
too tacked to the idea that there's one
 

7883
02:30:30,080 --> 02:30:32,349
too tacked to the idea that there's one
correct answer like that's what brings

7884
02:30:32,349 --> 02:30:32,359
correct answer like that's what brings
 

7885
02:30:32,359 --> 02:30:35,389
correct answer like that's what brings
meaning that's my goal anyway I don't

7886
02:30:35,389 --> 02:30:35,399
meaning that's my goal anyway I don't
 

7887
02:30:35,399 --> 02:30:37,030
meaning that's my goal anyway I don't
think there's a better way to end it
