00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:03,840
stay together long enough do all the
 

171
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,350
stay together long enough do all the
sexual things you need to do to

172
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:05,360
sexual things you need to do to
 

173
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,550
sexual things you need to do to
reproduce have the kids survive etc so

174
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:08,560
reproduce have the kids survive etc so
 

175
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,710
reproduce have the kids survive etc so
everything has to go through mating and

176
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:10,720
everything has to go through mating and
 

177
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,630
everything has to go through mating and
in that sense i think it's uh i mean

178
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:12,640
in that sense i think it's uh i mean
 

179
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,949
in that sense i think it's uh i mean
survival is really only

180
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:14,959
survival is really only
 

181
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,509
survival is really only
a means to an end if you if you will

182
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:17,519
a means to an end if you if you will
 

183
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,710
a means to an end if you if you will
uh so uh so sex has got to be important

184
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,720
uh so uh so sex has got to be important
 

185
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,110
uh so uh so sex has got to be important
and humans have a very rich

186
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,120
and humans have a very rich
 

187
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,990
and humans have a very rich
evol sexual psychology or an evolved

188
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,000
evol sexual psychology or an evolved
 

189
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,550
evol sexual psychology or an evolved
mating psychology okay but

190
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:28,560
mating psychology okay but
 

191
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,789
mating psychology okay but
uh i wouldn't minimize the importance of

192
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:30,799
uh i wouldn't minimize the importance of
 

193
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,350
uh i wouldn't minimize the importance of
violence either there's a ton of

194
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,360
violence either there's a ton of
 

195
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,229
violence either there's a ton of
evidence that humans evolved in the

196
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239
evidence that humans evolved in the
 

197
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,949
evidence that humans evolved in the
context of small groups

198
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:38,959
context of small groups
 

199
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,190
context of small groups
and with a fair amount of small group

200
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,200
and with a fair amount of small group
 

201
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,390
and with a fair amount of small group
warfare

202
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,400
warfare
 

203
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,350
warfare
so intertribal warfare

204
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:45,360
so intertribal warfare
 

205
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,430
so intertribal warfare
uh where uh and this is a harsh

206
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,440
uh where uh and this is a harsh
 

207
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,110
uh where uh and this is a harsh
realization but

208
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120
realization but
 

209
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,910
realization but
there historically um this is part of

210
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:53,920
there historically um this is part of
 

211
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,030
there historically um this is part of
our bad evolutionary history it has been

212
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,040
our bad evolutionary history it has been
 

213
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,030
our bad evolutionary history it has been
advantageous from a purely reproductive

214
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,040
advantageous from a purely reproductive
 

215
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,270
advantageous from a purely reproductive
standpoint to

216
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,280
standpoint to
 

217
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,550
standpoint to
conquer

218
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:02,560
conquer
 

219
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,270
conquer
a neighboring group kill the males

220
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:05,280
a neighboring group kill the males
 

221
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,470
a neighboring group kill the males
and

222
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:06,480
and
 

223
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,070
and
get whatever resources they have

224
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:08,080
get whatever resources they have
 

225
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,429
get whatever resources they have
including

226
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:09,439
including
 

227
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,630
including
females and and sexual resources to as

228
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:12,640
females and and sexual resources to as
 

229
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,350
females and and sexual resources to as
well as tools weapons territory and so

230
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:15,360
well as tools weapons territory and so
 

231
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,870
well as tools weapons territory and so
forth and so

232
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:16,880
forth and so
 

233
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,430
forth and so
um and so i think that we have uh of

234
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:19,440
um and so i think that we have uh of
 

235
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,469
um and so i think that we have uh of
course it's it's typically males

236
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:22,479
course it's it's typically males
 

237
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,270
course it's it's typically males
um

238
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,280
um
 

239
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,909
um
who do that i mean yes some females have

240
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:25,919
who do that i mean yes some females have
 

241
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,469
who do that i mean yes some females have
participated in warfare but

242
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:28,479
participated in warfare but
 

243
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,990
participated in warfare but
as far as i know there's never been a

244
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,000
as far as i know there's never been a
 

245
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,870
as far as i know there's never been a
single case in all of human recorded

246
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:32,880
single case in all of human recorded
 

247
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,749
single case in all of human recorded
history of women forming a war tribe

248
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:35,759
history of women forming a war tribe
 

249
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,070
history of women forming a war tribe
with other women to attack another group

250
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,080
with other women to attack another group
 

251
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,150
with other women to attack another group
of women and kill them and capture the

252
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
of women and kill them and capture the
 

253
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,270
of women and kill them and capture the
men

254

00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
but the these uh this phenomenon is
 

259
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,870
but the these uh this phenomenon is
common um in the ethnographic record

260
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:48,880
common um in the ethnographic record
 

261
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,070
common um in the ethnographic record
and small group uh studies

262
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,080
and small group uh studies
 

263
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,430
and small group uh studies
um it's part of our common thing so just

264
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,440
um it's part of our common thing so just
 

265
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,070
um it's part of our common thing so just
one concrete example unfortunately he's

266
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,080
one concrete example unfortunately he's
 

267
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,230
one concrete example unfortunately he's
dead now he passed away napoleon chagnon

00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240
dead now he passed away napoleon chagnon
 

269

00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:02,639
who studied the yanamamo for many many
 

271
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,670

years
 

273
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,990
years
um when he first started interviewing

274
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,000
um when he first started interviewing
 

275
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,070
um when he first started interviewing
them he he asked them

276
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,080
them he he asked them
 

277
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,350

you know why do you go to war um and
 

279
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,790
you know why do you go to war um and
they said well

280
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:12,800
they said well
 

281
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,270
they said well
to to capture women of course what it's

282
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:15,280
to to capture women of course what it's
 

283
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,950
to to capture women of course what it's
the only sensible

284
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:16,960
the only sensible
 

285
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,950
the only sensible
reason and they said you know why do why

286
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
reason and they said you know why do why
 

287
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,029
reason and they said you know why do why
does your culture go to war or however

288
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
does your culture go to war or however
 

289
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,870
does your culture go to war or however
they phrased it and he said well you

290
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:22,880
they phrased it and he said well you
 

291
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,310
they phrased it and he said well you
know we could work for to spread

292
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:24,320
know we could work for to spread
 

293
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,870
know we could work for to spread
democracy and ideas and everything they

294
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:26,880
democracy and ideas and everything they
 

295
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,430
democracy and ideas and everything they
basically fell off their logs laughing

296
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:29,440
basically fell off their logs laughing
 

297
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,430
basically fell off their logs laughing
at such a stupid reason because why risk

298
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440
at such a stupid reason because why risk
 

299
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,110
at such a stupid reason because why risk
your life for anything

300
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,120
your life for anything
 

301
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,749
your life for anything
um other than women of course it's more

302
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:35,759
um other than women of course it's more
 

303
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,990
um other than women of course it's more
complex than that because

304
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,000
complex than that because
 

305
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,110
complex than that because
some

306
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,120
some
 

307
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,189
some
go to war for

308
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199
go to war for
 

309
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,350
go to war for
reputational reasons they say if we if

310
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:43,360
reputational reasons they say if we if
 

311
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,629
reputational reasons they say if we if
we don't

312
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:44,639
we don't
 

313
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,870
we don't
retaliate because we've been attacked

314
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:46,880
retaliate because we've been attacked
 

315
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,350
retaliate because we've been attacked
and they've stolen three of our women if

316
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:49,360
and they've stolen three of our women if
 

317
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,350
and they've stolen three of our women if
we don't retaliate then we will get a

318
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:51,360
we don't retaliate then we will get a
 

319
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,629
we don't retaliate then we will get a
reputation as exploitable and then other

320
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
reputation as exploitable and then other
 

321
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,510
reputation as exploitable and then other
groups will start to attack us as well

322
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
groups will start to attack us as well
 

323
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,629
groups will start to attack us as well
and so they get into these cycles of um

324
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:00,639
and so they get into these cycles of um
 

325
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,629
and so they get into these cycles of um
you know like the hatfields and mccoys

326
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639
you know like the hatfields and mccoys
 

327
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,430
you know like the hatfields and mccoys
of attacks counter-attacks retribution

328
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:05,440
of attacks counter-attacks retribution
 

329
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,990
of attacks counter-attacks retribution
and part of it is is um

330
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,000
and part of it is is um
 

331
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,990
and part of it is is um
reputation management

332
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,000
reputation management
 

333
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,629
reputation management
um so that's that's between groups and

334
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:12,639
um so that's that's between groups and
 

335

all that kind of stuff yeah well i think

512
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:28,880
all that kind of stuff yeah well i think
 

513
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,750
all that kind of stuff yeah well i think
it's hard to isolate one factor i know

514
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:31,760
it's hard to isolate one factor i know
 

515
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,430
it's hard to isolate one factor i know
uh i know you've had richard wrangham on

wonderful interview and
uh he used to be a colleague of mine

522
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:38,560
uh he used to be a colleague of mine
 

523
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,110
uh he used to be a colleague of mine
when i was a professor at michigan and

524
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,120
when i was a professor at michigan and
 

525
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,990
when i was a professor at michigan and
um i've stayed in touch with him uh on

526
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,000
um i've stayed in touch with him uh on
 

527
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,230
um i've stayed in touch with him uh on
off he's a brilliant brilliant guy and

528
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240
off he's a brilliant brilliant guy and
 

529
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,269
off he's a brilliant brilliant guy and
he thinks

530
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:47,279
he thinks
 

531
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,030
he thinks
fire and cooking have been one of the

532
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,040
fire and cooking have been one of the
 

533
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,829
fire and cooking have been one of the
key things but i think it's hard to

534
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:51,839
key things but i think it's hard to
 

535
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,269
key things but i think it's hard to
isolate

536
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:53,279
isolate
 

537
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,550
isolate
i would trace at least part of our

538
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:56,560
i would trace at least part of our
 

539
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,750
i would trace at least part of our
uniqueness to uh the uniqueness of our

540
00:09:59,750 --> 00:09:59,760
uniqueness to uh the uniqueness of our
 

541
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,230
uniqueness to uh the uniqueness of our
mating system so we have in in mating uh

542
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,240
mating system so we have in in mating uh
 

543
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,630
mating system so we have in in mating uh
unlike chimpanzees who are our closest

544
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:06,640
unlike chimpanzees who are our closest
 

545
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,470
unlike chimpanzees who are our closest
primate relative and of which richard

546
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:08,480
primate relative and of which richard
 

547
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,069
primate relative and of which richard
wrangham is is a world's expert but they

548
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:12,079
wrangham is is a world's expert but they
 

549
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,350
wrangham is is a world's expert but they
have basically no long-term pure bonded

550
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:15,360
have basically no long-term pure bonded
 

551
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,590
have basically no long-term pure bonded
mating okay they female comes into

552
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:17,600
mating okay they female comes into
 

553
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,630
mating okay they female comes into
estrus

554
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:18,640
estrus
 

555
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,630
estrus
all the mating all the sex happens most

556
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:20,640
all the mating all the sex happens most
 

557
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,110
all the mating all the sex happens most
of the sex happens during that window

558
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,120
of the sex happens during that window
 

559
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,590
of the sex happens during that window
but humans have evolved long-term pure

560
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:25,600
but humans have evolved long-term pure
 

561
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,110
but humans have evolved long-term pure
bonded mating

562
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,120
bonded mating
 

563
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,269
bonded mating
uh and it's it's only one mating

564
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:29,279
uh and it's it's only one mating
 

565
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,190
uh and it's it's only one mating
strategy but it's a really important one

566
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,200
strategy but it's a really important one
 

567
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,230
strategy but it's a really important one
and then you have with that

568
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,240
and then you have with that
 

569
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,590
and then you have with that
male parental care so basically again we

570
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:37,600
male parental care so basically again we
 

571
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,829
male parental care so basically again we
go back to chimps and chimps

572
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:39,839
go back to chimps and chimps
 

573
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,470
go back to chimps and chimps
with whom we share more than 98 of our

574
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:42,480
with whom we share more than 98 of our
 

575
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,230
with whom we share more than 98 of our
dna

576
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,240

males don't do anything so they

578
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,079
males don't do anything so they
 

579
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,790
males don't do anything so they
inseminate the females but then when the

580
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:48,800
inseminate the females but then when the
 

581
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,949
inseminate the females but then when the
kids are born they basically don't do

582
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:50,959
kids are born they basically don't do
 

583
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,470
kids are born they basically don't do
much of anything in terms of

584
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:52,480
much of anything in terms of
 

585
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,790
much of anything in terms of
provisioning and so forth but human

586
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:54,800
provisioning and so forth but human
 

587
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,670

males do we invest in the modern

588
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:57,680
males do we invest in the modern
 

589
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,430
males do we invest in the modern
environment could be decades you know

590
00:10:59,430 --> 00:10:59,440
environment could be decades you know
 

591
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,590
environment could be decades you know
especially with the boomerang kids and

592
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:01,600
especially with the boomerang kids and
 

593
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,949
especially with the boomerang kids and
everything but

594
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:02,959
everything but
 

595
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:03,829
everything but
we're

00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
we're
 

597
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,670
we're
not all males do

598
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:05,680
not all males do
 

599
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,590
not all males do
but compared to

600
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:07,600
but compared to
 

601
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,230
but compared to
the vast majority of mammals we are a

602
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:10,240
the vast majority of mammals we are a
 

603

00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:20,240
sunset you know that's why i kind of
 

825
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,990
sunset you know that's why i kind of
started out by saying i think there are

826
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,000
started out by saying i think there are
 

827
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,310
started out by saying i think there are
different types of love and i'm focusing

828
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:24,320
different types of love and i'm focusing
 

829
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,949
different types of love and i'm focusing
on the mating type and we'll talk about

830
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:26,959
on the mating type and we'll talk about
 

831
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,790
on the mating type and we'll talk about
that but so yeah there is a sense of

832
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:28,800
that but so yeah there is a sense of
 

833
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,829
that but so yeah there is a sense of
beauty

834
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:29,839
beauty
 

835
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,790
beauty
and there's a sense of

836
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:31,800
and there's a sense of
 

837
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,710
and there's a sense of
sexual appeal maybe that's a good and

838
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:34,720
sexual appeal maybe that's a good and
 

839
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,629
sexual appeal maybe that's a good and
those intersect in fascinating ways

840
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:36,639
those intersect in fascinating ways
 

841
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,550
those intersect in fascinating ways
we'll we'll talk about that okay we'll

842
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:38,560
we'll we'll talk about that okay we'll
 

843
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,990
we'll we'll talk about that okay we'll
talk about all that but you're saying

844
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,000
talk about all that but you're saying
 

845
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,110
talk about all that but you're saying
mating

846
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:41,120
mating
 

847
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,069
mating
strategies not that we've kind of

848
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:44,079
strategies not that we've kind of
 

849
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,990
strategies not that we've kind of
uh placed ourselves what we mean by

850
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,000
uh placed ourselves what we mean by
 

851
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,150
uh placed ourselves what we mean by
mating mating strategies

852
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,160
mating mating strategies
 

853
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,790
mating mating strategies
is one of the cool features

854
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:50,800
is one of the cool features
 

855
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,030
is one of the cool features
that made humans what they are one of

856
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,040
that made humans what they are one of
 

857
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,389
that made humans what they are one of
the initial inventions is is the weird

858
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:56,399
the initial inventions is is the weird
 

859
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,870
the initial inventions is is the weird
uh weird and wonderful ways that we mate

860
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:58,880
uh weird and wonderful ways that we mate
 

861
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,990
uh weird and wonderful ways that we mate
yeah and

862
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,000
yeah and
 

863
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,509
yeah and
i mean if you go to

864
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:01,519
i mean if you go to
 

865
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,389
i mean if you go to
even things like um

866
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:04,399
even things like um
 

867
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,470
even things like um
how we compete for mates and this is

868
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:06,480
how we compete for mates and this is
 

869
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,430
how we compete for mates and this is
another kind of strange for some people

870
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:09,440
another kind of strange for some people
 

871
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,269
another kind of strange for some people
angle on it but

872
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:11,279
angle on it but
 

873
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,509
angle on it but
mating is inherently a competitive

874
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:13,519
mating is inherently a competitive
 

875
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,949
mating is inherently a competitive
process

876
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:14,959
process
 

877
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,749
process
in that desirable mates are in

878
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:17,759
in that desirable mates are in
 

879
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,470
in that desirable mates are in
secure supply relative to the numbers of

880
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:20,480
secure supply relative to the numbers of
 

881
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,790
secure supply relative to the numbers of
people who want them

882
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:22,800
people who want them
 

883
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,389
people who want them
and so even

884
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:24,399
and so even
 

885
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,030
and so even
even post mating after that is after

886
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,040
even post mating after that is after
 

887
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,110
even post mating after that is after
mate selection made attraction a mutual

888
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:29,120
mate selection made attraction a mutual
 

889
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,389
mate selection made attraction a mutual
mate choice

890
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:30,399
mate choice
 

891
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,230
mate choice
uh desirable that's why there's mate

892
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:32,240
uh desirable that's why there's mate
 

893
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,310
uh desirable that's why there's mate
poaching mate poaching is one of the

894
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:34,320
poaching mate poaching is one of the
 

895
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,829
poaching mate poaching is one of the
strategies that

896
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:35,839
strategies that
 

897
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,110
strategies that
we in my lab with david schmidt

898
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,120
we in my lab with david schmidt
 

899
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,269
we in my lab with david schmidt
have studied

900
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:41,279
have studied
 

901
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,310
have studied
and so

902
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:42,320
and so
 

903
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,030
and so
okay but one of the unique aspects of

904
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,040
okay but one of the unique aspects of
 

905
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,350
okay but one of the unique aspects of
humans is that we compete using language

906
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:49,360
humans is that we compete using language
 

907
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,110
humans is that we compete using language
and that is we have reputations and

908
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:53,120
and that is we have reputations and
 

909
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,069
and that is we have reputations and
humans devote a lot of effort to

910
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:56,079
humans devote a lot of effort to
 

911
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,829
humans devote a lot of effort to
maintaining their reputations to

912
00:16:57,829 --> 00:16:57,839
maintaining their reputations to
 

913
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,550
maintaining their reputations to
building their reputations to

914
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:00,560
building their reputations to
 

915
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,710
building their reputations to
trying to recover uh

916
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:02,720
trying to recover uh
 

917
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,069
trying to recover uh
reputations after uh a loss of

918
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:06,079
reputations after uh a loss of
 

919
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,029
reputations after uh a loss of
reputation for various reasons but we we

920
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:09,039
reputation for various reasons but we we
 

921
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,150
reputation for various reasons but we we
compete for mates um using

922
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:12,160
compete for mates um using
 

923
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,710
compete for mates um using
language and that includes

924
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:14,720
language and that includes
 

925
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,710
language and that includes
sending signals to the person that we're

926
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:16,720
sending signals to the person that we're
 

927
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,270
sending signals to the person that we're
trying to attract using language

928
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:19,280
trying to attract using language
 

929
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,549
trying to attract using language
um

930
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:20,559
um
 

931
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,189
um
verbal fluency and you know obviously

932
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:23,199
verbal fluency and you know obviously
 

933
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,150
verbal fluency and you know obviously
some more recent things like poetry

934
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,160
some more recent things like poetry
 

935
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,630
some more recent things like poetry
but also we use language to derogate our

936
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:28,640
but also we use language to derogate our
 

937
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,150
but also we use language to derogate our
competitors

938
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:30,160
competitors
 

939
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,029
competitors
so

940
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:31,039
so
 

941
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,789
so
one of the papers i published very early

942
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:32,799
one of the papers i published very early
 

943
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,950
one of the papers i published very early
on it was a research project on

00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:34,960
on it was a research project on
 

945
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,029
on it was a research project on
derogation of competitors

946
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:37,039
derogation of competitors
 

947
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,830
derogation of competitors
the the ways in which people impugn the

with the goal of making them less
 

955
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,390
with the goal of making them less
desirable

956
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:46,400
desirable
 

957
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,590
desirable
to

958
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:47,600
to
 

959
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,150
to
other people and humans do that and

960
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:50,160
other people and humans do that and
 

961
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,350
other people and humans do that and
uh women and men both do that so

962
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:53,360
uh women and men both do that so
 

963
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,110
uh women and men both do that so
it's an interesting thing that were male

964
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:55,120
it's an interesting thing that were male
 

965
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,549
it's an interesting thing that were male
competitions we were talking about the

966
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:56,559
competitions we were talking about the
 

967
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,270
competitions we were talking about the
yanamamo earlier and some of these

968
00:17:59,270 --> 00:17:59,280
yanamamo earlier and some of these
 

969
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,750
yanamamo earlier and some of these
overt physical or what what animal

970
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:01,760
overt physical or what what animal

biologists call contest competition

972
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:04,320
biologists call contest competition
 

973
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,390
biologists call contest competition
where there's a physical battle

974
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:06,400
where there's a physical battle
 

975
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,630
where there's a physical battle
uh males do that and so a lot of the

976
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:08,640
uh males do that and so a lot of the
 

977
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,470
uh males do that and so a lot of the
early attention on

978
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:10,480
early attention on
 

979
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,230
early attention on
mate competition was focused on these

980
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:12,240
mate competition was focused on these
 

981
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,310
mate competition was focused on these
sort of ostentatious

982
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:14,320
sort of ostentatious
 

983
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,669
sort of ostentatious
overt battles in contest competition

984
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:17,679
overt battles in contest competition
 

985
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,710
overt battles in contest competition
but we compete through language

986
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:20,720
but we compete through language
 

987
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,150
but we compete through language
um and uh and so there's this big

988
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:24,160
um and uh and so there's this big
 

989
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,549
um and uh and so there's this big
overlooked domain of women the ways in

990
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:26,559
overlooked domain of women the ways in

a couple two quick answers to that one

1062
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,200
a couple two quick answers to that one
 

1063
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,590
a couple two quick answers to that one
is the attentional one so our

1064
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:47,600
is the attentional one so our
 

1065
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,750
is the attentional one so our
attentional field sure when they draw

1066
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:49,760
attentional field sure when they draw
 

1067
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,750
attentional field sure when they draw
attention to it the

1068
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:51,760
attention to it the
 

1069
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,710
attention to it the
those what could be very small

1070

those what could be very small
 

1071

like you can change the values subtly or
 

1119
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,110
like you can change the values subtly or
if you have a large platform in big ways

1120
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:53,120
if you have a large platform in big ways
 

1121
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,630
if you have a large platform in big ways
you can move things around just with

1122
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:54,640
you can move things around just with
 

1123
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,990
you can move things around just with
your words yeah yeah that's right right

1124
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,000
your words yeah yeah that's right right
 

1125
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,390
your words yeah yeah that's right right
and fascinating

anyway so this uh i mean the question i

1130
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:04,880
anyway so this uh i mean the question i
 

1131
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,470
anyway so this uh i mean the question i
have is you said there's the interesting

1132
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:06,480
have is you said there's the interesting
 

1133
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,710
have is you said there's the interesting
thing about mating strategies is there's

1134
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:08,720
thing about mating strategies is there's
 

1135
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,470
thing about mating strategies is there's
a small

00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:10,480
a small
 

1137
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,870
a small
pool of desirable mates

1138
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:12,880
pool of desirable mates
 

1139
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,390
pool of desirable mates
and what the word desirable means is

1140
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:16,400
and what the word desirable means is
 

1141
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,830
and what the word desirable means is
socially defined almost by on purpose to

1142
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:19,840
socially defined almost by on purpose to
 

1143
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,310
socially defined almost by on purpose to
make sure the pool always stays small i

1144
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:22,320
make sure the pool always stays small i
 

1145
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,830
make sure the pool always stays small i
would have a couple thoughts on that now

1146
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:23,840
would have a couple thoughts on that now
 

1147
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,149
would have a couple thoughts on that now
it's an interesting issue set of issues

1148
00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:26,159
it's an interesting issue set of issues
 

1149
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,950

we i think we have evolved adaptations
part of our psychology is to detect

1154
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:34,559
part of our psychology is to detect
 

1155
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,830
part of our psychology is to detect
differences

1156
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:35,840
differences
 

1157
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,149
differences
um and so this is why

1158
00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:38,159
um and so this is why
 

1159
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,190
um and so this is why
um like a i don't know a a martian or an

1160
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:41,200
um like a i don't know a a martian or an
 

1161
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,710
um like a i don't know a a martian or an
alien coming down

1162
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:42,720
alien coming down
 

1163
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,549
alien coming down
they might look at humans and say boy

1164
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:44,559
they might look at humans and say boy
 

1165
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,390
they might look at humans and say boy
they all look alike

1166
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:46,400
they all look alike
 

1167
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,230
they all look alike
as one just like we look at i don't know

1168
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:48,240
as one just like we look at i don't know
 

1169
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,830
as one just like we look at i don't know
zebras or whatever we think they all

1170
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:49,840
zebras or whatever we think they all
 

1171
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,430
zebras or whatever we think they all
look look alike

1172
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:51,440
look look alike
 

1173
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,590
look look alike
um but

1174
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:53,600
um but
 

1175
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,990
um but
what's important in decision making

1176
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,000
what's important in decision making
 

1177
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,990
what's important in decision making
especially in the mating domain or even

1178
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,000
especially in the mating domain or even
 

1179
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,270
especially in the mating domain or even
friendship domain or or coalitional

1180
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:01,280
friendship domain or or coalitional
 

1181
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,230
friendship domain or or coalitional
selection domain is the differences

1182
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:04,240
selection domain is the differences
 

1183
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,390
selection domain is the differences
and and so i i noticed this just a

1184
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:06,400
and and so i i noticed this just a
 

1185
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,870
and and so i i noticed this just a
concrete example of this

1186
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:08,880
concrete example of this
 

1187
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,510
concrete example of this
uh i was sitting around this is again

1188
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:11,520
uh i was sitting around this is again
 

1189
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,270
uh i was sitting around this is again
ages ago uh

1190
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:13,280
ages ago uh
 

1191
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,190
ages ago uh
watching a um

1192
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:15,200
watching a um
 

1193
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,630
watching a um
something like a miss america beauty

1194
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:16,640
something like a miss america beauty
 

1195
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,950
something like a miss america beauty
contest and people in there with a bunch

1196
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:18,960
contest and people in there with a bunch
 

1197
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,350
contest and people in there with a bunch
of other people and they were saying boy

1198
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:21,360
of other people and they were saying boy
 

1199
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,909
of other people and they were saying boy
did you see miss north carolina what a

1200
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:23,919
did you see miss north carolina what a
 

1201
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,029
did you see miss north carolina what a
dog and and so yeah this is astonishing

1202
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:27,039
dog and and so yeah this is astonishing
 

1203
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,669
dog and and so yeah this is astonishing
so here are like a 50 contestants who

1204
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:29,679
so here are like a 50 contestants who
 

1205
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,830
so here are like a 50 contestants who
are selected as the most attractive in

1206
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:31,840
are selected as the most attractive in
 

1207
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,710
are selected as the most attractive in
their state presumably um although they

1208
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:34,720
their state presumably um although they
 

1209
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,750
their state presumably um although they
claim it's based on talent um but um

1210
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:37,760
claim it's based on talent um but um
 

1211
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,789
claim it's based on talent um but um
but we noticed the differences um

1212
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:40,799
but we noticed the differences um
 

1213
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,830
but we noticed the differences um
and and

1214
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:41,840
and and
 

1215
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,789
and and
uh and this is why i would push back a

1216
00:22:44,789 --> 00:22:44,799
uh and this is why i would push back a
 

1217
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,310
uh and this is why i would push back a
little bit on the term socially

1218
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:46,320
little bit on the term socially
 

1219
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,549
little bit on the term socially
constructed because i think it's

1220
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:48,559
constructed because i think it's
 

1221
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,430
constructed because i think it's
um

1222
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:49,440
um
 

1223
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,029
um
there are many different

1224
00:22:51,029 --> 00:22:51,039
there are many different
 

1225
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,750
there are many different
meanings of that of that phrase and

1226
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:53,760
meanings of that of that phrase and
 

1227
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,190
meanings of that of that phrase and
one meaning

1228
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:55,200
one meaning
 

1229
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,270
one meaning
that some people have one connotation is

1230
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:57,280
that some people have one connotation is
 

1231
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,350
that some people have one connotation is
that it's arbitrary and i don't think

1232
00:22:59,350 --> 00:22:59,360
that it's arbitrary and i don't think
 

1233
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,110
that it's arbitrary and i don't think
it's arbitrary so

1234
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,120
it's arbitrary so
 

1235
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,830
it's arbitrary so
uh this has been another shift in

1236
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:03,840
uh this has been another shift in
 

1237
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,110
uh this has been another shift in
understanding

1238
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,120
understanding
 

1239
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,669
understanding
standards of beauty where it used to be

1240
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:07,679
standards of beauty where it used to be
 

1241
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,549
standards of beauty where it used to be
believed in the in the social sciences

1242
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:10,559
believed in the in the social sciences
 

1243
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,230
believed in the in the social sciences
you can't judge a book by its cover

1244
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:12,240
you can't judge a book by its cover
 

1245
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,590
you can't judge a book by its cover
beauty is only

1246
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:13,600
beauty is only
 

1247
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,270
beauty is only
the skin deep

1248
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:15,280
the skin deep
 

1249
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,669
the skin deep
uh you know don't judge people on the

1250
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:17,679
uh you know don't judge people on the
 

1251
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,669
uh you know don't judge people on the
superficial characteristics

1252
00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:19,679
superficial characteristics
 

1253
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,029
superficial characteristics
but in fact

1254
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:21,039
but in fact
 

1255
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,110
but in fact
physical appearance provides a wealth of

1256
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:23,120
physical appearance provides a wealth of
 

1257
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,549
physical appearance provides a wealth of
information

1258
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:24,559
information
 

1259
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,990
information
about the health status of someone their

1260
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:28,000
about the health status of someone their
 

1261
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,149
about the health status of someone their
in the case of males their physical

1262
00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:30,159
in the case of males their physical
 

1263
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,830
in the case of males their physical
formidability

1264
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:31,840
formidability
 

1265
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,909
formidability
and we have formidability assessment

1266
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:33,919
and we have formidability assessment
 

1267
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,190
and we have formidability assessment
adaptations and then fertility as well

1268
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:37,200
adaptations and then fertility as well
 

1269
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,710
adaptations and then fertility as well
so there are a very predictable set of

1270
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:40,720
so there are a very predictable set of
 

1271
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,870
so there are a very predictable set of
cues to fertility that have evolved to

1272
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:42,880
cues to fertility that have evolved to
 

1273
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,230
cues to fertility that have evolved to
be part of our

1274
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:44,240
be part of our
 

1275
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,310
be part of our
standards of attractiveness and and

1276
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:46,320
standards of attractiveness and and
 

1277
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,230
standards of attractiveness and and
they're not arbitrary there are some

1278
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:48,240
they're not arbitrary there are some
 

1279
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,710
they're not arbitrary there are some
culturally arbitrary ones so like

1280
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:50,720
culturally arbitrary ones so like
 

1281
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,110
culturally arbitrary ones so like
you go to the the maori in new zealand

1282
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:53,120
you go to the the maori in new zealand
 

1283
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,590
you go to the the maori in new zealand
for example and they find tattoos on

1284
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:55,600
for example and they find tattoos on
 

1285
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,470
for example and they find tattoos on
their lips to be very attractive

1286
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:58,480
their lips to be very attractive
 

1287
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,269
their lips to be very attractive
so there are some culturally arbitrary

1288
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:01,279
so there are some culturally arbitrary
 

1289
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,430
so there are some culturally arbitrary
things um but standards of beauty like

1290
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:05,440
things um but standards of beauty like
 

1291
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,390
things um but standards of beauty like
uh cues to youth cues to health

1292
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:08,400
uh cues to youth cues to health
 

1293
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,390
uh cues to youth cues to health
uh in women clear skin uh full lips

1294
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:12,400
uh in women clear skin uh full lips
 

1295
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,789
uh in women clear skin uh full lips
clear eyes lustrous hair

1296
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:14,799
clear eyes lustrous hair
 

1297
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,669
clear eyes lustrous hair
um a small waist hip ratio that is

1298
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:17,679
um a small waist hip ratio that is
 

1299
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,669
um a small waist hip ratio that is
circumference of the waist relative to

circumference of the waist relative to
 

1301

the hips
 

1303
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,549
the hips
uh is a cue to youth infertility and and

1304
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:24,559
uh is a cue to youth infertility and and
 

1305
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,190
uh is a cue to youth infertility and and
acute health symmetrical features so we

1306
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:27,200
acute health symmetrical features so we
 

1307
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,750
acute health symmetrical features so we
are a bilaterally bilaterally

1308
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:29,760
are a bilaterally bilaterally
 

1309
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,950
are a bilaterally bilaterally
symmetrical species but we all have

1310
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:32,960
symmetrical species but we all have
 

1311
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,110
symmetrical species but we all have
we all have uh deviations from perfect

1312
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:35,120
we all have uh deviations from perfect
 

1313
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,510
we all have uh deviations from perfect
symmetry that are due to

1314
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:37,520
symmetry that are due to
 

1315
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,149
symmetry that are due to
different things so mutation load

00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:40,159
different things so mutation load
 

1317
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,789
different things so mutation load
uh environmental insults diseases during

1318
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:42,799
uh environmental insults diseases during
 

1319
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,950
uh environmental insults diseases during
development and so forth

1320
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:44,960
development and so forth
 

1321
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,510
development and so forth
all right but that that's kind of deeply

1322
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:47,520
all right but that that's kind of deeply
 

1323
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,669
all right but that that's kind of deeply
biological like there's cues that

1324
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:49,679
biological like there's cues that
 

1325
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,190
biological like there's cues that
indicate something

1326
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:51,200
indicate something
 

1327
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,350
indicate something
that is biologically true about a

1328
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:53,360
that is biologically true about a
 

1329
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,350
that is biologically true about a
particular human so if we we'll talk

1330
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:55,360
particular human so if we we'll talk
 

1331
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,990
particular human so if we we'll talk
about both men and women

1332
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,000
about both men and women
 

1333
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,789
about both men and women
uh so we're now talking about what

1334
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:00,799
uh so we're now talking about what
 

1335
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,950
uh so we're now talking about what
men want

1336
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:02,960
men want
 

1337
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,789
men want
in the mating strategies when they look

1338
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:04,799
in the mating strategies when they look
 

1339
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,070
in the mating strategies when they look
at women

1340
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,080
at women
 

1341
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,190
at women
so you're saying small waist

1342
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:09,200
so you're saying small waist
 

1343
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,909
so you're saying small waist
to hip ratio right

1344
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:11,919
to hip ratio right
 

1345
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,590
to hip ratio right
is

1346
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:13,600
is
 

1347
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,269
is
how much of that is our deep biological

1348
00:25:17,269 --> 00:25:17,279
how much of that is our deep biological
 

1349
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,510
how much of that is our deep biological
past on top of which we can build all

1350
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:19,520
past on top of which we can build all
 

1351
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,590
past on top of which we can build all
kinds of different standards of beauty

1352
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:21,600
kinds of different standards of beauty
 

1353
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,310
kinds of different standards of beauty
so you know we have many

1354
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:24,320
so you know we have many
 

1355
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,950
so you know we have many
things going on in our brain

1356
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:26,960
things going on in our brain
 

1357
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,870
things going on in our brain
our value of other

1358
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:28,880
our value of other
 

1359
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,190
our value of other
humans in selecting a mate

1360
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:31,200
humans in selecting a mate
 

1361
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,029
humans in selecting a mate
might uh incorporate a lot more

1362
00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:33,039
might uh incorporate a lot more
 

1363
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,149
might uh incorporate a lot more
variables

1364
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:34,159
variables
 

1365
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,269
variables
as we get into the 21st century so how

1366
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:37,279
as we get into the 21st century so how
 

1367
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,710
as we get into the 21st century so how
quickly does

1368
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:38,720
quickly does
 

1369
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,830
quickly does
our

1370
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:40,840
our
 

1371
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,350
our
valuation of a mate

1372
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:43,360
valuation of a mate
 

1373
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,310
valuation of a mate
uh evolve relative to the evolution of

1374
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:46,320
uh evolve relative to the evolution of
 

1375
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,269
uh evolve relative to the evolution of
um

1376
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:47,279
um
 

1377
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,870
um
the human species

1378
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:48,880
the human species
 

1379
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,789
the human species
they're using evolving the sense of

1380
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:50,799
they're using evolving the sense of
 

1381
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,430
they're using evolving the sense of
culturally culturally evolved and then

1382
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:53,440
culturally culturally evolved and then
 

1383
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,710
culturally culturally evolved and then
relative to biologically evolve yeah uh

1384
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:56,720
relative to biologically evolve yeah uh
 

1385
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,310
relative to biologically evolve yeah uh
well i think that there are um

1386
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:00,320
well i think that there are um
 

1387
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,710
well i think that there are um
there are some things that are

1388
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:02,720
there are some things that are
 

1389
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,269
there are some things that are
biologically evolved some standards

1390
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:05,279
biologically evolved some standards
 

1391
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,669
biologically evolved some standards
standards of attractiveness

1392
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:07,679
standards of attractiveness
 

1393
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,669
standards of attractiveness
um and there are some of the things that

1394
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:09,679
um and there are some of the things that
 

1395
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,070
um and there are some of the things that
i mentioned so in male evaluation of

1396
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,080
i mentioned so in male evaluation of
 

1397
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,110
i mentioned so in male evaluation of
females let me back up and just say what

1398
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:15,120
females let me back up and just say what
 

1399
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,710
females let me back up and just say what
is the underlying logic why would we

1400
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:16,720
is the underlying logic why would we
 

1401
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,029
is the underlying logic why would we
have standards of attractiveness so

1402
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:19,039
have standards of attractiveness so
 

1403
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,789
have standards of attractiveness so
um

1404
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:20,799
um
 

1405
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,070
um
here's the interesting thing and this

1406
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:22,080
here's the interesting thing and this
 

1407
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,310
here's the interesting thing and this
gets back to your earlier question about

1408
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:24,320
gets back to your earlier question about
 

1409
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,350
gets back to your earlier question about
what is

1410
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:25,360
what is
 

1411
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,990
what is
unique to humans or what distinguishes

1412
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:28,000
unique to humans or what distinguishes
 

1413
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,830
unique to humans or what distinguishes
us or what set us off on the path that

1414
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:29,840
us or what set us off on the path that
 

1415
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,870
us or what set us off on the path that
we did

1416
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:30,880
we did
 

1417
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,070
we did
is

1418
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,080
is
 

1419
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,630
is
chimpanzee males

1420
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:34,640
chimpanzee males
 

1421
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,870
chimpanzee males
do not have any difficulty

1422
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:36,880
do not have any difficulty
 

1423
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,590
do not have any difficulty
figuring out when a female is fertile

1424
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:39,600
figuring out when a female is fertile
 

1425
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,230
figuring out when a female is fertile
she signals that like crazy with the

1426
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:42,240
she signals that like crazy with the
 

1427
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,750
she signals that like crazy with the
bright red genital

1428
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:43,760
bright red genital
 

1429
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,789
bright red genital
swelling uh olfactory cues she goes into

1430
00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:46,799
swelling uh olfactory cues she goes into
 

1431
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,630
swelling uh olfactory cues she goes into
estrus

1432
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:48,640
estrus
 

1433
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,630
estrus
in humans we have and this was actually

1434
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:50,640
in humans we have and this was actually
 

1435
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,230
in humans we have and this was actually
a third thing that i wanted to add

1436
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:52,240
a third thing that i wanted to add
 

1437
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,669
a third thing that i wanted to add
earlier we have concealed ovulation okay

1438
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:55,679
earlier we have concealed ovulation okay
 

1439
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,909
earlier we have concealed ovulation okay
relatively concealed ovulation which is

1440
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:57,919
relatively concealed ovulation which is
 

1441
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,669
relatively concealed ovulation which is
remarkable given how close we are

1442
00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:00,679
remarkable given how close we are
 

1443
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:04,630
remarkable given how close we are
primatologically to to chimpanzees

1444
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:04,640
primatologically to to chimpanzees
 

1445
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,669
primatologically to to chimpanzees
and so um uh there's there's a little

1446
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:07,679
and so um uh there's there's a little
 

1447
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,669
and so um uh there's there's a little
bit of evidence that

1448
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:09,679
bit of evidence that
 

1449
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,669
bit of evidence that
there are subtle changes that occur when

1450
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:11,679
there are subtle changes that occur when
 

1451
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,830
there are subtle changes that occur when
women ovulate non

1452
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:13,840
women ovulate non
 

1453
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,909
women ovulate non
women not on hormonal contraceptives but

1454
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:15,919
women not on hormonal contraceptives but
 

1455
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,990
women not on hormonal contraceptives but
it's mostly concealed but it is it is

1456
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:18,000
it's mostly concealed but it is it is
 

1457
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,190
it's mostly concealed but it is it is
largely concealed i think that's a

1458
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:19,200
largely concealed i think that's a
 

1459
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,310
largely concealed i think that's a
feature of bug in uh like do we evolve

1460
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:22,320
feature of bug in uh like do we evolve
 

1461
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,870
feature of bug in uh like do we evolve
that is that is that a

1462
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:24,880
that is that is that a
 

1463
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,110
that is that is that a
cool and a powerful invention for the

1464
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:27,120
cool and a powerful invention for the
 

1465
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,190
cool and a powerful invention for the
human species i think it's it's an

1466
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:29,200
human species i think it's it's an
 

1467
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,590
human species i think it's it's an
adaptation in women that women have

1468
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:31,600
adaptation in women that women have
 

1469
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,230
adaptation in women that women have
evolved concealed ovulation

1470
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:34,240
evolved concealed ovulation
 

1471
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,870
evolved concealed ovulation
and i think it's a feature not a bug

1472
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:36,880
and i think it's a feature not a bug
 

1473
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,990
and i think it's a feature not a bug
it gives more would it give more power

1474
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:40,000
it gives more would it give more power
 

1475
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,750
it gives more would it give more power
for women

1476
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:41,760
for women
 

1477
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,549
for women
to select

1478
00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:44,559
to select
 

1479
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,070
to select
a mate there are a couple different

1480
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:46,080
a mate there are a couple different
 

1481
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,710
a mate there are a couple different
hypotheses about it but the one that i

1482
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:48,720
hypotheses about it but the one that i
 

1483
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,230
hypotheses about it but the one that i
think is

1484
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:50,240
think is
 

1485
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,149
think is
most plausible uh is that

1486
00:27:54,149 --> 00:27:54,159
most plausible uh is that
 

1487
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,070
most plausible uh is that
you know if again comparing it to chimps

1488
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:58,080
you know if again comparing it to chimps
 

1489
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,549
you know if again comparing it to chimps
fema goes into estrus the male just has

1490
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:00,559
fema goes into estrus the male just has
 

1491
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,029
fema goes into estrus the male just has
to try to monopolize her while she's in

1492
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:03,039
to try to monopolize her while she's in
 

1493
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,710
to try to monopolize her while she's in
that estrus phase and then they

1494
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:04,720
that estrus phase and then they
 

1495
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,669
that estrus phase and then they
basically ignore the females after that

1496
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:07,679
basically ignore the females after that
 

1497
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,990
basically ignore the females after that
if you can't know when if when a woman

1498
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:10,000
if you can't know when if when a woman
 

1499
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,430
if you can't know when if when a woman
is fertile

1500
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:11,440
is fertile
 

1501
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,990
is fertile
then you have to stick around a lot

1502
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,000
then you have to stick around a lot
 

1503
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,029
then you have to stick around a lot
longer and so i think long-term pair

1504
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:17,039
longer and so i think long-term pair
 

1505
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,029
longer and so i think long-term pair
bonding

1506
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:18,039
bonding
 

1507
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:22,149
bonding
co-evolved with concealed ovulation

1508
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:22,159
co-evolved with concealed ovulation
 

1509
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,789
co-evolved with concealed ovulation
and with that also a very different form

1510
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:24,799
and with that also a very different form
 

1511
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,269
and with that also a very different form
of sexuality which is that we have sex

1512
00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:27,279
of sexuality which is that we have sex
 

1513
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,870
of sexuality which is that we have sex
throughout the

1514
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:28,880
throughout the
 

1515
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,630
throughout the
ovulatory cycle

1516
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:30,640
ovulatory cycle
 

1517
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,230
ovulatory cycle
um and uh chimps don't you know there's

1518
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:34,240
um and uh chimps don't you know there's
 

1519
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,830
um and uh chimps don't you know there's
there's a little bit of mating a little

1520
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:35,840
there's a little bit of mating a little
 

1521
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,710
there's a little bit of mating a little
bit of sex toward the edges of the um

1522
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:38,720
bit of sex toward the edges of the um
 

1523
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,190
bit of sex toward the edges of the um
ester cycle but but very little so that

1524
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:41,200
ester cycle but but very little so that
 

1525
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,190
ester cycle but but very little so that
that actually makes mating

1526
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:43,200
that actually makes mating
 

1527
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,149
that actually makes mating
a more fundamental part of um

1528
00:28:46,149 --> 00:28:46,159
a more fundamental part of um
 

1529
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,710
a more fundamental part of um
interaction between humans than it does

1530
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:48,720
interaction between humans than it does
 

1531
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,789
interaction between humans than it does
for chimps so meaning like

1532
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:50,799
for chimps so meaning like
 

1533
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,190
for chimps so meaning like

00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:03,360
today in the 21st century versus
 

1543
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,230
today in the 21st century versus
in the caveman days a wonderful question

1544
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:06,240
in the caveman days a wonderful question
 

1545
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,669
in the caveman days a wonderful question
to answer it though i have to

1546
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:07,679
to answer it though i have to
 

1547
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,430
to answer it though i have to
distinguish between

1548
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:09,440
distinguish between
 

1549
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,070
distinguish between
long-term mating and short-term mating

1550
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,080
long-term mating and short-term mating
 

1551
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,350
long-term mating and short-term mating
uh and in long-term mating it gets very

1552
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:15,360
uh and in long-term mating it gets very
 

1553
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,630
uh and in long-term mating it gets very
complicated

1554
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:16,640
complicated
 

1555
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,350
complicated
so as as a uh that's one way to put it

1556
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:19,360
so as as a uh that's one way to put it
 

1557
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,389
so as as a uh that's one way to put it
yeah

1558
00:29:20,389 --> 00:29:20,399
yeah
 

1559

00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,990
at austin and
um one of the things this was back in

1566
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:30,000

1567
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,950
um one of the things this was back in
the days when there were chalkboards and

the days when there were chalkboards and
 

1569
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,110
the days when there were chalkboards and
you and you taught with a piece of chalk

1570
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:35,120
you and you taught with a piece of chalk
 

1571
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,669
you and you taught with a piece of chalk
and wrote things on the board

1572
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:37,679
and wrote things on the board
 

1573
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,269
and wrote things on the board
and what i would do is i would ask the

1585
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:51,830
and so i would start at one end of the
blackboard there were like five

1586
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:51,840

00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:04,960
and fill five blackboards and then run
 

1599
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,149
and fill five blackboards and then run
out of space

1600
00:30:06,149 --> 00:30:06,159
out of space
 

1601
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,029
out of space
and and so you the first this large

1602
00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:09,039
and and so you the first this large
 

1603

want and then
specific magnitudes of those

1608
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:14,320

yes but but not a workaholic you know
and so uh

1638
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:50,640
and so uh
 

1639
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,710
and so uh
and so then you get to interactions

1640
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:52,720
and so then you get to interactions
 

1641
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,029
and so then you get to interactions
among different characteristics so

1642
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:55,039
among different characteristics so
 

1643
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,630
among different characteristics so
there's a lot of characteristics a lot

1644
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:56,640
there's a lot of characteristics a lot
 

1645
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,549
there's a lot of characteristics a lot
of variables in this very complex

1646
00:30:58,549 --> 00:30:58,559
of variables in this very complex
 

1647
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,269
of variables in this very complex
optimization problem for women yes

1648
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:01,279
optimization problem for women yes
 

1649
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,830
optimization problem for women yes
that's right and more so for women than

1650
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:03,840
that's right and more so for women than
 

1651
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,990
that's right and more so for women than
for men so and then i turned it to men

1652
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:06,000
for men so and then i turned it to men
 

1653
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,070
for men so and then i turned it to men
and i say well what do men want and then

1654
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:08,080
and i say well what do men want and then
 

1655
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,990
and i say well what do men want and then
i i run out of space after about a

1656
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:10,000
i i run out of space after about a
 

1657
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,750
i i run out of space after about a
blackboard and a half because they they

1658
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:11,760
blackboard and a half because they they
 

1659
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,669
blackboard and a half because they they
can't think of anything else

1660
00:31:13,669 --> 00:31:13,679
can't think of anything else
 

1661
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,190
can't think of anything else
so the women i think there's a lot of

1662
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:15,200
so the women i think there's a lot of
 

1663
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,430
so the women i think there's a lot of
explanations for that

1664
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:17,440
explanations for that
 

1665
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,389
explanations for that
besides

1666
00:31:18,389 --> 00:31:18,399
besides
 

1667
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,149
besides
the lack of the number of variables it's

1668
00:31:20,149 --> 00:31:20,159
the lack of the number of variables it's
 

1669
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,870
the lack of the number of variables it's
also you know um

1670
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:22,880
also you know um
 

1671
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,789
also you know um
i mean that's interesting so what what's

1672
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:24,799
i mean that's interesting so what what's
 

1673
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,070
i mean that's interesting so what what's
the difference between the variables so

1674
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:26,080
the difference between the variables so
 

1675
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,669
the difference between the variables so
on the men's side what are the variables

1676
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:27,679
on the men's side what are the variables
 

1677
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,750
on the men's side what are the variables
well they're in long-term base flexion

1678
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:29,760
well they're in long-term base flexion
 

1679
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,430
well they're in long-term base flexion
there there's a lot of overlap sure okay

1680
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:33,440
there there's a lot of overlap sure okay
 

1681
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,950
there there's a lot of overlap sure okay
um so

1682
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:34,960
um so
 

1683
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,430
um so
things like intelligence

1684
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:37,440
things like intelligence
 

1685
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,269
things like intelligence
um good health

1686
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:39,279
um good health
 

1687
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,750
um good health
sense of humor um

1688
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:41,760
sense of humor um
 

1689
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,310
sense of humor um
an agreeable personality someone who's

1690
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:44,320
an agreeable personality someone who's
 

1691
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,590
an agreeable personality someone who's
not too

1692
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:45,600
not too
 

1693
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,909
not too
neurotic or moody or or

1694
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:47,919
neurotic or moody or or
 

1695
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,230
neurotic or moody or or
emotionally volatile

1696
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:50,240
emotionally volatile
 

1697
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,310
emotionally volatile
but there are key differences as well

1698
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:52,320
but there are key differences as well
 

1699
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,590
but there are key differences as well
and the differences stem from they

1700
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:55,600
and the differences stem from they
 

1701
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,909
and the differences stem from they
basically fall on the delimited number

1702
00:31:57,909 --> 00:31:57,919
basically fall on the delimited number
 

1703
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,190
basically fall on the delimited number
of domains so for men it's physical

1704
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:01,200
of domains so for men it's physical
 

1705
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,909
of domains so for men it's physical
attractiveness physical appearance and

1706
00:32:03,909 --> 00:32:03,919
attractiveness physical appearance and
 

1707
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,190
attractiveness physical appearance and
youth are the two real big ones okay men

1708
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:07,200
youth are the two real big ones okay men
 

1709
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,870
youth are the two real big ones okay men
prioritize those

1710
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:08,880
prioritize those
 

1711
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,269
prioritize those
more than women do and so that's why you

1712
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:11,279
more than women do and so that's why you
 

1713
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,389
more than women do and so that's why you
have phenomena such as uh this quote

1714
00:32:14,389 --> 00:32:14,399
have phenomena such as uh this quote
 

1715
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,950
have phenomena such as uh this quote
love at first sight where sometimes men

1716
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:16,960
love at first sight where sometimes men
 

1717
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,870
love at first sight where sometimes men
can walk into a party and they see a

1718
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:18,880
can walk into a party and they see a
 

1719
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,950
can walk into a party and they see a
woman across the room and say that i'm

1720
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:20,960
woman across the room and say that i'm
 

1721
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,070
woman across the room and say that i'm
going to marry that woman that's the

1722
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:22,080
going to marry that woman that's the
 

1723
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,110
going to marry that woman that's the
woman for me women very rarely do that

1724
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:25,120
woman for me women very rarely do that
 

1725
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,350
woman for me women very rarely do that
now most men do don't do that either but

1726
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:27,360
now most men do don't do that either but
 

1727
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,430
now most men do don't do that either but
men are much more inclined to fall in

1728
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:29,440
men are much more inclined to fall in
 

1729
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,350
men are much more inclined to fall in
love at first sight that's because they

1730
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:31,360
love at first sight that's because they
 

1731
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,750
love at first sight that's because they
prioritize physical appearance

1732
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:33,760
prioritize physical appearance
 

1733
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,230
prioritize physical appearance
why because physical appearance provides

1734
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:36,240
why because physical appearance provides
 

1735
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,789
why because physical appearance provides
that this wealth of information

1736
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:38,799
that this wealth of information
 

1737
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,350
that this wealth of information
about a woman's fertility status and

1738
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:41,360
about a woman's fertility status and
 

1739
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,509
about a woman's fertility status and
this is from from an evolutionary

1740
00:32:43,509 --> 00:32:43,519
this is from from an evolutionary
 

1741
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,750
this is from from an evolutionary
perspective from a purely reproductive

1742
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:45,760
perspective from a purely reproductive
 

1743
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,950
perspective from a purely reproductive
perspective

1744
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:46,960
perspective
 

1745
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,110
perspective
in in a business school they would call

1746
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:49,120
in in a business school they would call
 

1747
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,789
in in a business school they would call
it job one

1748
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:50,799
it job one
 

1749
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,269
it job one
job one is you have to select a fertile

1750
00:32:53,269 --> 00:32:53,279
job one is you have to select a fertile
 

1751
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,149
job one is you have to select a fertile
mate

1752
00:32:54,149 --> 00:32:54,159
mate
 

1753
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,350
mate
so those who in our evolutionary past

1754
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:57,360
so those who in our evolutionary past
 

1755
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,149
so those who in our evolutionary past
who selected infertile mates so

1756
00:33:00,149 --> 00:33:00,159
who selected infertile mates so
 

1757
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,630
who selected infertile mates so
post-menopausal women for example

1758
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:02,640
post-menopausal women for example
 

1759
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,750
post-menopausal women for example
um did not become our ancestors so we

1760
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:05,760
um did not become our ancestors so we
 

1761
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,630
um did not become our ancestors so we
are all the descendants of this long and

1762
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:08,640
are all the descendants of this long and
 

1763
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,590
are all the descendants of this long and
unbroken chain of ancestors who all of

1764
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:11,600
unbroken chain of ancestors who all of
 

1765
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,750
unbroken chain of ancestors who all of
whom success succeeded in selecting a

1766
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:13,760
whom success succeeded in selecting a
 

1767
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,870
whom success succeeded in selecting a
fertile mate but fertility cannot be

1768
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:16,880
fertile mate but fertility cannot be
 

1769
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,029
fertile mate but fertility cannot be
observed directly

1770
00:33:19,029 --> 00:33:19,039
observed directly
 

1771
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,190
observed directly
uh it can't use some cues

1772
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:21,200
uh it can't use some cues
 

1773
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,310
uh it can't use some cues
exactly and and there are cues that are

1774
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:24,320
exactly and and there are cues that are
 

1775
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,630
exactly and and there are cues that are
probabilistically related to this

1776
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:26,640
probabilistically related to this
 

1777
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,789
probabilistically related to this
underlying quality of fertility that we

1778
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:28,799
underlying quality of fertility that we
 

1779
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,630
underlying quality of fertility that we
can't observe directly and we're doing

1780
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:30,640
can't observe directly and we're doing
 

1781
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,110
can't observe directly and we're doing
that computation in our heads what about

1782
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:33,120
that computation in our heads what about
 

1783
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:33,990
that computation in our heads what about
men

1784
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:34,000
men
 

1785
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,190
men
what do men want for short-term mating

1786
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:37,200
what do men want for short-term mating
 

1787
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,470
what do men want for short-term mating
well so for short-term mating um

1788
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:40,480
well so for short-term mating um
 

1789
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,870
well so for short-term mating um
for both sexes uh physical appearance uh

1790
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:44,880
for both sexes uh physical appearance uh
 

1791
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,230
for both sexes uh physical appearance uh
looms very large so so inc so women are

1792
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:48,240
looms very large so so inc so women are
 

1793
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,230
looms very large so so inc so women are
no physical attractiveness and

1794
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:50,240
no physical attractiveness and
 

1795
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,909
no physical attractiveness and
appearance they're important for women

1796
00:33:51,909 --> 00:33:51,919
appearance they're important for women
 

1797
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:53,590

so but from a design perspective um an

1962
00:36:59,829 --> 00:36:59,839
so but from a design perspective um an
 

1963
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,470
so but from a design perspective um an
engineering perspective if you will uh

1964
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:02,480
engineering perspective if you will uh
 

1965
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,150
engineering perspective if you will uh
that's a disastrous thing if you're just

1966
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:04,160
that's a disastrous thing if you're just
 

1967
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,510
that's a disastrous thing if you're just
trying to get good genes so you're

1968
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:05,520
trying to get good genes so you're
 

1969
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,990
trying to get good genes so you're
trying to retain the investment of one

1970
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:08,000
trying to retain the investment of one
 

1971
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,950
trying to retain the investment of one
guy yeah while getting good genes

1972
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:10,960
guy yeah while getting good genes
 

1973
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,630
guy yeah while getting good genes
surreptitiously from this you know guy

1974
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:14,640
surreptitiously from this you know guy
 

1975
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,390
surreptitiously from this you know guy
who presumably has more

1976
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:16,400
who presumably has more
 

1977
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,829
who presumably has more
falling in love with them becoming

1978
00:37:17,829 --> 00:37:17,839
falling in love with them becoming
 

1979
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,670
falling in love with them becoming
attached that's that's not a feature you

1980
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:19,680
attached that's that's not a feature you
 

1981
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,390
attached that's that's not a feature you
want yeah it's bad engineering yeah

1982
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:22,400
want yeah it's bad engineering yeah
 

1983
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,150
want yeah it's bad engineering yeah
exactly it's bad engineering and so and

1984
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:24,160
exactly it's bad engineering and so and
 

1985
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,030
exactly it's bad engineering and so and
so i developed a an alternative uh

1986
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:27,040
so i developed a an alternative uh
 

1987
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,230
so i developed a an alternative uh
hypothesis that i call the

1988
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:28,240
hypothesis that i call the
 

1989
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,390
hypothesis that i call the
mate-switching hypothesis

1990
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:30,400
mate-switching hypothesis
 

1991
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,310
mate-switching hypothesis
which is that um

1992
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:32,320
which is that um
 

1993
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,950
which is that um
affairs are one way in which women

1994
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:36,960
affairs are one way in which women
 

1995
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,829
affairs are one way in which women
divest themselves of a

1996
00:37:39,829 --> 00:37:39,839
divest themselves of a
 

1997
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,550
divest themselves of a
a cost inflicting partner or a partner

1998
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:42,560
a cost inflicting partner or a partner
 

1999
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,430
a cost inflicting partner or a partner
who

2000
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:43,440
who
 

2001
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,670
who
things aren't working out well with and

2002
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:45,680
things aren't working out well with and
 

2003
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,430
things aren't working out well with and
it's a way to either transition back

2004
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:47,440
it's a way to either transition back
 

2005
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,470
it's a way to either transition back
into the mating market or to or to trade

2006
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:50,480
into the mating market or to or to trade
 

2007
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,950
into the mating market or to or to trade
up in in the mating market

2008
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:52,960
up in in the mating market
 

2009
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,829
up in in the mating market
uh and and so and anyway so these are

2010
00:37:55,829 --> 00:37:55,839
uh and and so and anyway so these are
 

2011
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,190
uh and and so and anyway so these are
these are probably the two leading

2012
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:57,200
these are probably the two leading
 

2013
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,430
these are probably the two leading

2014
00:37:59,430 --> 00:37:59,440

esteemed colleagues are putting their
 

2025
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,750
esteemed colleagues are putting their
money on the good genes hypothesis but i

2026
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:09,760
money on the good genes hypothesis but i
 

2027
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,710
money on the good genes hypothesis but i
think

2028
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:10,720
think
 

2029
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,150
think
the evidence for the good genes

2030
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:12,160
the evidence for the good genes
 

2031
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,630
the evidence for the good genes
hypothesis is starting to um

2032
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:14,640
hypothesis is starting to um
 

2033
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,109
hypothesis is starting to um
look shakier than initially

2034
00:38:17,109 --> 00:38:17,119
look shakier than initially
 

2035
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,190
look shakier than initially
but this is a heated debate i mean made

2036
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:19,200
but this is a heated debate i mean made
 

2037
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,829
but this is a heated debate i mean made
squishing sounds like a so from a game

2038
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:21,839
squishing sounds like a so from a game
 

2039
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,270
squishing sounds like a so from a game
theory perspective from an engineering

2040
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:23,280
theory perspective from an engineering
 

2041
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,710
theory perspective from an engineering
perspective seems to make a lot more

2042
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:24,720
perspective seems to make a lot more
 

2043
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,069
perspective seems to make a lot more
sense unless you put a lot of value

2044
00:38:28,069 --> 00:38:28,079
sense unless you put a lot of value
 

2045
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,390
sense unless you put a lot of value
in lifelong sort of in the long term

2046
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:30,400
in lifelong sort of in the long term
 

2047
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,990
in lifelong sort of in the long term
mating

2048
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:32,000
mating
 

2049
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,349
mating
uh some kind of

2050
00:38:33,349 --> 00:38:33,359
uh some kind of
 

2051
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,870
uh some kind of
value in the um lifelong singular

2052
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:36,880
value in the um lifelong singular
 

2053
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,470
value in the um lifelong singular
relationship like monogamy yeah

2054
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:40,480
relationship like monogamy yeah
 

2055
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,390
relationship like monogamy yeah
and maybe we do psychologically maybe

2056
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:42,400
and maybe we do psychologically maybe
 

2057
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,670
and maybe we do psychologically maybe
there's a big

2058
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:43,680
there's a big
 

2059
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,310
there's a big
evolutionary advantage to that and we we

2060
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:46,320
evolutionary advantage to that and we we
 

2061
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,750
evolutionary advantage to that and we we
do but we also know that divorce is you

2062
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:49,760
do but we also know that divorce is you
 

2063
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,950
do but we also know that divorce is you
know um and breakups are are also common

2064
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:52,960
know um and breakups are are also common
 

2065
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,150
know um and breakups are are also common
that occur in all cultures so yeah um

2066
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:56,160
that occur in all cultures so yeah um
 

2067
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,589
that occur in all cultures so yeah um
we're just not very good at this thing

2068
00:38:57,589 --> 00:38:57,599
we're just not very good at this thing
 

2069
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,270
we're just not very good at this thing
well either we're not good at the mate

2070
00:38:59,270 --> 00:38:59,280
well either we're not good at the mate
 

2071
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,190
well either we're not good at the mate
selection

2072
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:01,200
selection
 

2073
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,670

such that

2074
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:03,680
such that
 

2075
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,150
such that
uh maybe we're

2076
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:06,160
uh maybe we're
 

2077
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,990
uh maybe we're
we're not incorporating

2078
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:08,000
we're not incorporating
 

2079
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,870
we're not incorporating
all the variables well or we're just not

2080
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:10,880
all the variables well or we're just not
 

2081
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,870
all the variables well or we're just not
good at monogamy period

2082
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:12,880
good at monogamy period
 

2083
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,550
good at monogamy period
from an evolutionary perspective well i

2084
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:14,560
from an evolutionary perspective well i
 

2085
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,670
from an evolutionary perspective well i
think they're

2086
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:15,680
think they're
 

2087
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,870
think they're
that's

2088
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:16,880
that's
 

2089
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,430
that's
a debate no that's raises an interesting

2090
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:19,440
a debate no that's raises an interesting
 

2091
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,510
a debate no that's raises an interesting
set of questions so i think that

2092
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:21,520
set of questions so i think that
 

2093
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,030
set of questions so i think that
i mean one issue is is longevity so i

2094
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,040
i mean one issue is is longevity so i
 

2095
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,030
i mean one issue is is longevity so i
mean we didn't live

2096
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:27,040
mean we didn't live
 

2097
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,589
mean we didn't live
to be 70 80

2098
00:39:29,589 --> 00:39:29,599
to be 70 80
 

2099
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,109
to be 70 80
years old

2100
00:39:31,109 --> 00:39:31,119
years old
 

2101
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,230
years old
and over 99 of human evolutionary

2102
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:34,240
and over 99 of human evolutionary
 

2103
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,870
and over 99 of human evolutionary
history and so we didn't necessarily

2104
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:36,880
history and so we didn't necessarily
 

2105
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,630
history and so we didn't necessarily
evolve to be

2106
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:38,640
evolve to be
 

2107
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,349
evolve to be
mated monogamously with one person for

2108
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:41,359
mated monogamously with one person for
 

2109
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,910
mated monogamously with one person for
decades and decades and decades

2110
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:43,920
decades and decades and decades
 

2111
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,950
decades and decades and decades
but i also think that

2112
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:46,960
but i also think that
 

2113
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,030
but i also think that
long-term peer bonding is a critical

2114
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:49,040
long-term peer bonding is a critical
 

2115
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,670
long-term peer bonding is a critical
strategy but mate switching is also a

2116
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:51,680
strategy but mate switching is also a
 

2117
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,310
strategy but mate switching is also a
critical strategy so if you have a mate

2118
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:54,320
critical strategy so if you have a mate
 

2119
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,430
critical strategy so if you have a mate
for example who

2120
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:57,440
for example who
 

2121
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,390
for example who
becomes cost inflicting or becomes

2122
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:00,400
becomes cost inflicting or becomes

um especially to women so is a man
 

2317
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,190
um especially to women so is a man
able to acquire resources and is he

2318
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:39,200
able to acquire resources and is he
 

2319

now what's what's interesting about

2346
00:44:13,589 --> 00:44:13,599
now what's what's interesting about
 

2347
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,470
now what's what's interesting about
modern culture is we have cash economies

2348
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:16,480
modern culture is we have cash economies
 

2349
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,510
modern culture is we have cash economies
but cash economies are relatively recent

2350
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:19,520
but cash economies are relatively recent
 

2351
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,710
but cash economies are relatively recent
and

2352
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:20,720
and
 

2353
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,630
and
you know historically there's over the

2354
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:22,640
you know historically there's over the

00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,550
vast uh 99 of human evolutionary history
you weren't able to stockpile resources

2358
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:28,560
you weren't able to stockpile resources
 

2359
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,109
you weren't able to stockpile resources
in the way that you are today

2360
00:44:31,109 --> 00:44:31,119
in the way that you are today
 

2361
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:31,990
in the way that you are today
um

2362
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:32,000
um
 

2363
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,990
um
although there are interestingly certain

2364
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:34,000
although there are interestingly certain
 

2365
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,349
although there are interestingly certain
ways you can do it so so like you you

2366
00:44:37,349 --> 00:44:37,359
ways you can do it so so like you you
 

2367
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:39,670
ways you can do it so so like you you
kill a large game animal okay you bring

2368
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:39,680
kill a large game animal okay you bring
 

2369
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,910
kill a large game animal okay you bring
it back you get some status points

2370
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:41,920
it back you get some status points
 

2371
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,270
it back you get some status points
because you

2372
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:43,280
because you
 

2373
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,750
because you
give some to your family you can share

2374
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:45,760
give some to your family you can share
 

2375
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,950
give some to your family you can share
it more widely with the group etc

2376
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:48,960
it more widely with the group etc
 

2377
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,230
it more widely with the group etc
um but um but it's going to go bad right

2378
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:52,240
um but um but it's going to go bad right
 

2379
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,990
um but um but it's going to go bad right
you can't just say i'm going to keep

2380
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:54,000
you can't just say i'm going to keep
 

2381
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,069
you can't just say i'm going to keep

this carcass around for the next several
 

2383
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:57,910
this carcass around for the next several
months okay but

2384
00:44:57,910 --> 00:44:57,920
months okay but
 

2385
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,069

2391
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,109

the bodies of other people and so for
 

2393
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,030

so
 

2397
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,430
so
you know um

2398
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:11,440
you know um
 

2399
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,150
you know um
hunting success is uh

2400
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:14,160
hunting success is uh
 

2401
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,150
hunting success is uh
you know it's it's a hit or miss kind of

2402
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:16,160
you know it's it's a hit or miss kind of
 

2403
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,430
you know it's it's a hit or miss kind of
thing so you might come back

2404
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:17,440
thing so you might come back
 

2405
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,550
thing so you might come back
empty-handed

2406
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:18,560
empty-handed
 

2407
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,390

four times out of five

2408
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:20,400
four times out of five
 

2409
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,630
four times out of five
but and but when you do you share your

2410
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:22,640
but and but when you do you share your
 

2411
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,349
but and but when you do you share your
meat with others and then when

2412
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:25,359
meat with others and then when
 

2413
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,190
meat with others and then when
you know and then they reciprocate by

2414
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:27,200
you know and then they reciprocate by
 

2415
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,030
you know and then they reciprocate by
sharing their meat with you and so and

2416
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:29,040
sharing their meat with you and so and
 

2417
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,430
sharing their meat with you and so and
so you can store resources in the bodies

2418
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:31,440
so you can store resources in the bodies
 

2419
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,109
so you can store resources in the bodies
of other people which is i think an

2420
00:45:33,109 --> 00:45:33,119
of other people which is i think an
 

2421
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:35,190
of other people which is i think an
interesting way to think about it but

2422
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:35,200
interesting way to think about it but
 

2423
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,510
interesting way to think about it but
that can only go so far and when you

2424
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:37,520
that can only go so far and when you
 

2425
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,150
that can only go so far and when you
have cash economies you have both the

2426
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:40,160
have cash economies you have both the
 

2427
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,550
have cash economies you have both the
ability to stockpile resources but also

2428
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:42,560
ability to stockpile resources but also
 

2429
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,349
ability to stockpile resources but also
this kind of explosion and

2430
00:45:45,349 --> 00:45:45,359
this kind of explosion and
 

2431
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,510
this kind of explosion and
inequality of resources

2432
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:47,520
inequality of resources
 

2433
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,230
inequality of resources
and that's evolutionarily recent what

2434
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:50,240
and that's evolutionarily recent what
 

2435
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,550
and that's evolutionarily recent what
about now this is the difference between

2436
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:52,560
about now this is the difference between
 

2437
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,030
about now this is the difference between

a rigorous analyst of what is true in
 

2451
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,150
a rigorous analyst of what is true in
the scientific community also helps you

2452
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:10,160
the scientific community also helps you
 

2453
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,710
the scientific community also helps you
with great advice on how to live now in

00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:12,720
with great advice on how to live now in
 

2455
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,390
with great advice on how to live now in
contrast to that i am a um

2456
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:16,400
contrast to that i am a um
 

2457
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,150
contrast to that i am a um
a terrible

uh
 

2461
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:22,309
uh
uh almost idiotic level journalist so

2462
00:46:22,309 --> 00:46:22,319
uh almost idiotic level journalist so
 

2463
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:24,470
uh almost idiotic level journalist so
this is what you have to deal with

2464
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:24,480
this is what you have to deal with
 

2465
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,470
this is what you have to deal with
another thing that people talk about

2466
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:26,480
another thing that people talk about
 

2467
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,270
another thing that people talk about
that women care about is penis size does

2468
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:29,280
that women care about is penis size does
 

2469
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,589
that women care about is penis size does
penis size matter for women in sexual

2470
00:46:31,589 --> 00:46:31,599
penis size matter for women in sexual
 

2471
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:32,870
penis size matter for women in sexual
selection

2472
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:32,880
selection
 

2473
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,510
selection
well um there's controversy about that

2474
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:35,520
well um there's controversy about that
 

2475
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,270
well um there's controversy about that
in the evolutionary psychology community

2476
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:37,280
in the evolutionary psychology community
 

2477
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,069
in the evolutionary psychology community
well

2478
00:46:38,069 --> 00:46:38,079
well
 

2479
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,230
well
is there papers on penis size i wouldn't

2480
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:40,240
is there papers on penis size i wouldn't
 

2481
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,190
is there papers on penis size i wouldn't
say

2482
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:41,200
say
 

2483
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,630
say
a scientific paper so speculations

2484
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:44,640
a scientific paper so speculations
 

2485
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,510
a scientific paper so speculations
about

2486
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:45,520
about
 

2487
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,230
about
in nature or in science yeah yeah no

2488
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:48,240
in nature or in science yeah yeah no
 

2489
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,190
in nature or in science yeah yeah no
nothing nothing that i've seen there

2490
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:51,200
nothing nothing that i've seen there
 

2491
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,030
nothing nothing that i've seen there
um

2492
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:53,040
um
 

2493
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,710
um
you know i i think that there's

2494
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:54,720
you know i i think that there's
 

2495
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,390
you know i i think that there's
individual variability um so uh this is

2496
00:46:58,390 --> 00:46:58,400
individual variability um so uh this is
 

2497
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,230
individual variability um so uh this is
something that comes up again you know

2498
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:00,240
something that comes up again you know
 

2499
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,230
something that comes up again you know
when i ask women in the class my classes

2500
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:02,240
when i ask women in the class my classes
 

2501
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,990
when i ask women in the class my classes
you know what do women want some will

2502
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:04,000
you know what do women want some will
 

2503
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,630
you know what do women want some will
say you know a large penis

2504
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:06,640
say you know a large penis
 

2505
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:10,150
say you know a large penis
but i think there's variability um in in

2506
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:10,160
but i think there's variability um in in
 

2507
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,630
but i think there's variability um in in
that preference and it also might depend

2508
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:12,640
that preference and it also might depend
 

2509
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,190
that preference and it also might depend
in part on the variability in

2510
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:15,200
in part on the variability in
 

2511
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,430
in part on the variability in
the woman's anatomy

2512
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:17,440
the woman's anatomy
 

2513
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,230
the woman's anatomy
so

2514
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:18,240
so
 

2515
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,589
so
um do you think there's something

2516
00:47:19,589 --> 00:47:19,599
um do you think there's something
 

2517
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,510
um do you think there's something
fundamental in terms of evolutionary

2518
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:21,520
fundamental in terms of evolutionary
 

2519
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,829
fundamental in terms of evolutionary
psychology in terms of evolution or is

2520
00:47:23,829 --> 00:47:23,839
psychology in terms of evolution or is
 

2521
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:27,109
psychology in terms of evolution or is
this a quark of culture that's current

2522
00:47:27,109 --> 00:47:27,119
this a quark of culture that's current
 

2523
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,030
this a quark of culture that's current
that's maybe somehow connected to

2524
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:29,040
that's maybe somehow connected to
 

2525
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,870
that's maybe somehow connected to
pornography or something like that yeah

2526
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:30,880
pornography or something like that yeah
 

2527
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,870
pornography or something like that yeah
my my guess is it's it's something

2528
00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:32,880
my my guess is it's it's something
 

2529
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,390
my my guess is it's it's something
that's uh

2530
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:34,400
that's uh
 

2531
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,309
that's uh
perhaps a quirk of culture or or

2532
00:47:36,309 --> 00:47:36,319
perhaps a quirk of culture or or
 

2533
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:37,670
perhaps a quirk of culture or or
something that is

2534
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:37,680
something that is
 

2535
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,230
something that is
evolutionarily recent

2536
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:40,240
evolutionarily recent
 

2537
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,870
evolutionarily recent
um but um but but i don't know i mean

2538
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:42,880
um but um but but i don't know i mean
 

2539
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,549
um but um but but i don't know i mean
it's it's a topic that hasn't been

2540
00:47:44,549 --> 00:47:44,559
it's it's a topic that hasn't been
 

2541
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:47,109
it's it's a topic that hasn't been
explored much i've never done work on it

2542
00:47:47,109 --> 00:47:47,119
explored much i've never done work on it
 

2543
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,990
explored much i've never done work on it
and well somebody should do a phd uh

2544
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:50,000
and well somebody should do a phd uh
 

2545
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,990
and well somebody should do a phd uh
sort of some archaeologist should do a

2546
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:52,000
sort of some archaeologist should do a
 

2547
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,870
sort of some archaeologist should do a
phd on the history of

2548
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:54,880
phd on the history of
 

2549
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,270
phd on the history of
human civilization

2550
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:57,280
human civilization
 

2551
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,790
human civilization
and its

2552
00:47:58,790 --> 00:47:58,800
and its
 

2553
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,589
and its
evaluation of penis size and the

2554
00:48:01,589 --> 00:48:01,599
evaluation of penis size and the
 

2555
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,589
evaluation of penis size and the
correlation of penis size to the value

2556
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:03,599
correlation of penis size to the value
 

2557
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:04,870
correlation of penis size to the value
of the male

2558
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:04,880
of the male
 

2559
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,470
of the male
okay moving on another absurd question

2560
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:08,480
okay moving on another absurd question
 

2561
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,510
okay moving on another absurd question
in terms of what men want

2562
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:11,520
in terms of what men want
 

2563
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,750
in terms of what men want
again definitely not a huberman lab

2564
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:13,760
again definitely not a huberman lab
 

2565
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,829
again definitely not a huberman lab
podcast question

2566
00:48:15,829 --> 00:48:15,839
podcast question
 

2567
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,750
podcast question
why do men

2568
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:17,760
why do men
 

2569
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,910
why do men
let's say a large fraction of men love

2570
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:19,920
let's say a large fraction of men love
 

2571
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,990
let's say a large fraction of men love
boobs

2572
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:22,000
boobs
 

2573
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,270
boobs
well uh i think that uh

2574
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:25,280
well uh i think that uh
 

2575
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,349
well uh i think that uh
you're one of the uh most cited

2576
00:48:27,349 --> 00:48:27,359
you're one of the uh most cited
 

2577
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:29,349
you're one of the uh most cited
evolutionary psychologists

2578
00:48:29,349 --> 00:48:29,359
evolutionary psychologists
 

2579
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:31,109
evolutionary psychologists
and this is what you signed up for this

2580
00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:31,119
and this is what you signed up for this
 

2581
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:32,710
and this is what you signed up for this
is these kinds of questions questions

2582
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:32,720
is these kinds of questions questions
 

2583
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,950
is these kinds of questions questions
like this yeah well so again this is

2584
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:34,960
like this yeah well so again this is
 

2585
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,349
like this yeah well so again this is
something i haven't studied directly but

2586
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:37,359
something i haven't studied directly but
 

2587
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:38,390
something i haven't studied directly but
um

2588
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:38,400
um
 

2589
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,510
um
uh

2590
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:39,520
uh
 

2591
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,470
uh
scientifically yes yes uh but um but

2592
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:42,480
scientifically yes yes uh but um but
 

2593
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,150
scientifically yes yes uh but um but
yeah there's been some work on that and

2594
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:44,160
yeah there's been some work on that and
 

2595
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,549
yeah there's been some work on that and
and it's uh another cultural quirk

2596
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:46,559
and it's uh another cultural quirk
 

2597
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:48,309
and it's uh another cultural quirk
perhaps no i don't think it's a cultural

2598
00:48:48,309 --> 00:48:48,319
perhaps no i don't think it's a cultural
 

2599
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:51,030
perhaps no i don't think it's a cultural
quirk because i think it's the uh

2600
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:51,040
quirk because i think it's the uh
 

2601
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,630
quirk because i think it's the uh
the shape

2602
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:52,640
the shape
 

2603
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,030
the shape
that matters a lot because

2604
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:55,040
that matters a lot because
 

2605
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,950
that matters a lot because
shape is going to be a cue to fertility

2606
00:48:58,950 --> 00:48:58,960
shape is going to be a cue to fertility
 

2607
00:48:58,960 --> 00:48:59,829
shape is going to be a cue to fertility
and

2608
00:48:59,829 --> 00:48:59,839
and
 

2609
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:02,230
and
so one of the things that humans are

2610
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:02,240
so one of the things that humans are
 

2611
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,430
so one of the things that humans are
attracted to in the opposite sex is

2612
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:05,440
attracted to in the opposite sex is
 

2613
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,910
attracted to in the opposite sex is
sexually dimorphic features and breasts

2614
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:07,920
sexually dimorphic features and breasts
 

2615
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,549
sexually dimorphic features and breasts
are a sexually dimorphic feature and

2616
00:49:10,549 --> 00:49:10,559
are a sexually dimorphic feature and
 

2617
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:12,470
are a sexually dimorphic feature and
dymorphic mean

2618
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:12,480
dymorphic mean
 

2619
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,069
dymorphic mean
difference between

2620
00:49:14,069 --> 00:49:14,079
difference between
 

2621
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:15,670
difference between
difference in morphology between males

2622
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:15,680
difference in morphology between males
 

2623
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,430
difference in morphology between males
and females got it

2624
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:17,440
and females got it
 

2625
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,230
and females got it
um

2626
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:18,240
um
 

2627
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,270
um
diamond to morphic morphology

2628
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:21,280
diamond to morphic morphology
 

2629
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,589
diamond to morphic morphology
uh so um

2630
00:49:23,589 --> 00:49:23,599
uh so um
 

2631
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:26,069
uh so um
and women don't develop uh

2632
00:49:26,069 --> 00:49:26,079
and women don't develop uh
 

2633
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,710
and women don't develop uh
breasts until um

2634
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:28,720
breasts until um
 

2635
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,510
breasts until um
puberty or post-puberty

2636
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:31,520
puberty or post-puberty
 

2637
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,109
puberty or post-puberty
uh and and so uh as a sexually demorphic

2638
00:49:35,109 --> 00:49:35,119
uh and and so uh as a sexually demorphic
 

2639
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:36,710
uh and and so uh as a sexually demorphic
characteristic we tend to be attracted

2640
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:36,720
characteristic we tend to be attracted
 

2641
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,230
characteristic we tend to be attracted
that same is true by the way with the

2642
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:38,240
that same is true by the way with the
 

2643
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,069
that same is true by the way with the
waist-to-hip ratio that we mentioned

2644
00:49:40,069 --> 00:49:40,079
waist-to-hip ratio that we mentioned
 

2645
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:41,030
waist-to-hip ratio that we mentioned
earlier

2646
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:41,040
earlier
 

2647
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,349
earlier
uh prior to puberty males and females

2648
00:49:43,349 --> 00:49:43,359
uh prior to puberty males and females
 

2649
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:46,150
uh prior to puberty males and females
have very similar ways to ratios but at

2650
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:46,160
have very similar ways to ratios but at
 

2651
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,750
have very similar ways to ratios but at
puberty um there's a differential

2652
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:49,760
puberty um there's a differential
 

2653
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,870
puberty um there's a differential
uh

2654
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:50,880
uh
 

2655
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,109
uh
hip development and fat deposition that

2656
00:49:53,109 --> 00:49:53,119
hip development and fat deposition that
 

2657
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:56,069
hip development and fat deposition that
creates a sexual dimorphism uh with

2658
00:49:56,069 --> 00:49:56,079
creates a sexual dimorphism uh with
 

2659
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,630
creates a sexual dimorphism uh with
respect to waist-hip ratio and so again

2660
00:49:58,630 --> 00:49:58,640
respect to waist-hip ratio and so again
 

2661
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,589
respect to waist-hip ratio and so again
that's

2662
00:49:59,589 --> 00:49:59,599
that's
 

2663
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,430
that's
men are attracted to this wasted ratio

2664
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:01,440
men are attracted to this wasted ratio
 

2665
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,750
men are attracted to this wasted ratio
that no man consciously says that they

2666
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:03,760
that no man consciously says that they
 

2667
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,069
that no man consciously says that they
find this woman more attractive than

2668
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:06,079
find this woman more attractive than
 

2669
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,390
find this woman more attractive than
that woman they don't think ah she has a

2670
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:08,400
that woman they don't think ah she has a
 

2671
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,109
that woman they don't think ah she has a
waist up ratio 0.70 that's exactly what

2672
00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:11,119
waist up ratio 0.70 that's exactly what
 

2673
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:15,829
waist up ratio 0.70 that's exactly what
i do but most men most men yes

2674
00:50:15,829 --> 00:50:15,839

 

2675
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:16,630

so

2676
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:16,640
so
 

2677
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,549
so
isn't that fascinating that we just

2678
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:18,559
isn't that fascinating that we just
 

2679
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:20,230
isn't that fascinating that we just
build these entire industries the

2680
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:20,240
build these entire industries the
 

2681
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,030
build these entire industries the
fashion and what we find beautiful

2682
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:23,040
fashion and what we find beautiful
 

2683
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,030
fashion and what we find beautiful
around

2684
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:25,040
around
 

2685
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,910
around
these kinds of ideas and we just

2686
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:27,920
these kinds of ideas and we just
 

2687
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,069
these kinds of ideas and we just
and then not just not just fashion and

2688
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:30,079
and then not just not just fashion and
 

2689
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:31,670
and then not just not just fashion and
then we build

2690
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:31,680
then we build
 

2691
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,430
then we build
uh we have

2692
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:33,440
uh we have
 

2693
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,750
uh we have
uh sociological tensions about whether

2694
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:35,760
uh sociological tensions about whether
 

2695
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,190
uh sociological tensions about whether
we should care about this kind of thing

2696
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:37,200
we should care about this kind of thing
 

2697
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,150
we should care about this kind of thing
or not

2698
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:38,160
or not
 

2699
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,470
or not
there's there's battles in that space

2700
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:40,480
there's there's battles in that space
 

2701
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,109
there's there's battles in that space
it's it's like

2702
00:50:43,109 --> 00:50:43,119
it's it's like
 

2703
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:44,790
it's it's like
they seem so simple it's just the human

2704
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:44,800
they seem so simple it's just the human
 

2705
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,710
they seem so simple it's just the human
body and we wear clothes first of all

2706
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:46,720
body and we wear clothes first of all
 

2707
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,870
body and we wear clothes first of all
that's that's a funny thing what what's

2708
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:48,880
that's that's a funny thing what what's
 

2709
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,549
that's that's a funny thing what what's
the why are we wearing clothes what's

2710
00:50:50,549 --> 00:50:50,559
the why are we wearing clothes what's
 

2711
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:53,190
the why are we wearing clothes what's
the shame aspect yeah of covering up the

2712
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:53,200
the shame aspect yeah of covering up the
 

2713
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,870
the shame aspect yeah of covering up the
body is that another feature or is that

2714
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:54,880
body is that another feature or is that
 

2715
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,470
body is that another feature or is that
what is that yeah that's a that's a

2716
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:56,480
what is that yeah that's a that's a
 

2717
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,309
what is that yeah that's a that's a
that's an interesting question and i i

2718
00:50:58,309 --> 00:50:58,319
that's an interesting question and i i
 

2719
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:00,069
that's an interesting question and i i
don't know it's just like hiding uh

2720
00:51:00,069 --> 00:51:00,079
don't know it's just like hiding uh
 

2721
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:02,950
don't know it's just like hiding uh
ovulation maybe that's another hiding

2722
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:02,960
ovulation maybe that's another hiding
 

2723
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,430
ovulation maybe that's another hiding
like uh maybe hiding is a great game

2724
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:05,440
like uh maybe hiding is a great game
 

2725
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,430
like uh maybe hiding is a great game
theoretic thing to play with because it

2726
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:07,440
theoretic thing to play with because it
 

2727
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,670
theoretic thing to play with because it
can give you it can give the powerless

2728
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:09,680
can give you it can give the powerless
 

2729
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:10,870
can give you it can give the powerless
more power

2730
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:10,880
more power
 

2731
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,950
more power
by covering well well maybe well i think

2732
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:12,960
by covering well well maybe well i think
 

2733
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,910
by covering well well maybe well i think
there are a few things so one is

2734
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:15,920
there are a few things so one is
 

2735
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,750
there are a few things so one is
the sort of arbitrary features of

2736
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:17,760
the sort of arbitrary features of
 

2737
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,150
the sort of arbitrary features of
fashion and then the other is the

2738
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:20,160
fashion and then the other is the
 

2739
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,470
fashion and then the other is the
aspects of fashion that attempt to um

2740
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:24,480
aspects of fashion that attempt to um
 

2741
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,430
aspects of fashion that attempt to um
magnify are what is inherent in our

2742
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:27,440
magnify are what is inherent in our
 

2743
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,829
magnify are what is inherent in our
evolved standards of beauty so for

2744
00:51:29,829 --> 00:51:29,839
evolved standards of beauty so for
 

2745
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:33,109
evolved standards of beauty so for
example um women tend to wear things

2746
00:51:33,109 --> 00:51:33,119
example um women tend to wear things
 

2747
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:37,190
example um women tend to wear things
that accentuate their waist hip ratio

2748
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:37,200
that accentuate their waist hip ratio
 

2749
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,470
that accentuate their waist hip ratio
so i mean

2750
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:38,480
so i mean
 

2751
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,230
so i mean
historically those

2752
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:40,240
historically those
 

2753
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,150
historically those
in the old days corsets for example

2754
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:42,160
in the old days corsets for example
 

2755
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:47,109
in the old days corsets for example
cinch the woman's waist

2756
00:51:47,109 --> 00:51:47,119

 

2757
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:49,670

and you wouldn't see fashion develop in

2758
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:49,680
and you wouldn't see fashion develop in
 

2759
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:53,349
and you wouldn't see fashion develop in
a way that made a woman seem

2760
00:51:53,349 --> 00:51:53,359
a way that made a woman seem
 

2761
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:57,750
a way that made a woman seem
old unhealthy

2762
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:57,760

 

2763
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,349

pock marked

2764
00:51:59,349 --> 00:51:59,359
pock marked
 

2765
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,710
pock marked
signs of

00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:00,720
signs of
 

2767
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,549
signs of
open sores or lesions

2768
00:52:02,549 --> 00:52:02,559
open sores or lesions
 

2769
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:04,470
open sores or lesions
there are certain domains um design

2770
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:04,480
there are certain domains um design
 

2771
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,870
there are certain domains um design
spaces that you wouldn't that no culture

2772
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:06,880
spaces that you wouldn't that no culture
 

2773
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,630
spaces that you wouldn't that no culture
would develop

2774
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:08,640
would develop
 

2775
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,829
would develop
um

2776
00:52:09,829 --> 00:52:09,839
um
 

2777
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:12,309
um
so but there are arbitrary features but

2778
00:52:12,309 --> 00:52:12,319
so but there are arbitrary features but
 

2779
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:14,470
so but there are arbitrary features but
sometimes they're not entirely arbitrary

2780
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:14,480
sometimes they're not entirely arbitrary
 

2781
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,150
sometimes they're not entirely arbitrary
or they're arbitrary at one level of

2782
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:16,160
or they're arbitrary at one level of
 

2783
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,710
or they're arbitrary at one level of
description but not another so for

2784
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:18,720
description but not another so for
 

2785
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,829
description but not another so for
example

2786
00:52:19,829 --> 00:52:19,839
example
 

2787
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:23,270
example
fashion tends to be linked with status

2788
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:23,280
fashion tends to be linked with status
 

2789
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,829
fashion tends to be linked with status
and that's why it constantly changes

2790
00:52:25,829 --> 00:52:25,839
and that's why it constantly changes
 

2791
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:28,470
and that's why it constantly changes
the high status people start wearing a

2792
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:28,480
the high status people start wearing a
 

2793
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,990
the high status people start wearing a
certain type of

2794
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:30,000
certain type of
 

2795
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,270
certain type of
clothing

2796
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:31,280
clothing
 

2797
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,950
clothing
and then when the lower status people

2798
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:32,960
and then when the lower status people
 

2799
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,670
and then when the lower status people
imitate them then they have to shift to

2800
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:35,680
imitate them then they have to shift to
 

2801
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,470
imitate them then they have to shift to
signal their status and so i think the

2802
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:38,480
signal their status and so i think the
 

2803
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,309
signal their status and so i think the
fashion and clothing is important linked

2804
00:52:40,309 --> 00:52:40,319
fashion and clothing is important linked
 

2805

2937
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,990
what's called in in the field uh an
evolutionary mismatch

2938
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:04,000
evolutionary mismatch
 

2939
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,470
evolutionary mismatch
so we evolved in the context of small

2940
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:06,480
so we evolved in the context of small
 

2941
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,670
so we evolved in the context of small
group living

2942
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:07,680
group living
 

2943
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,069
group living
where there was make competition but

2944
00:55:10,069 --> 00:55:10,079
where there was make competition but
 

2945
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,630
where there was make competition but
your competitors were a small number of

2946
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:12,640
your competitors were a small number of
 

2947
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,230
your competitors were a small number of
other potential

2948
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:14,240

individuals and so people do comparisons

2950
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:17,920
individuals and so people do comparisons
 

2951
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:18,789
individuals and so people do comparisons
um

2952
00:55:18,789 --> 00:55:18,799
um
 

2953
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:22,630
um
okay but now what we have is

2954
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:22,640
okay but now what we have is
 

2955
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:26,309
okay but now what we have is
uh this bombardment bombardment of our

2956
00:55:26,309 --> 00:55:26,319
uh this bombardment bombardment of our
 

2957
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:27,670
uh this bombardment bombardment of our
visual

2958
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:27,680

system and our sexual psychology and our

2960
00:55:30,069 --> 00:55:30,079
system and our sexual psychology and our
 

2961
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:32,309

00:55:32,309 --> 00:55:32,319
mating psychology with with
 

2963
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:35,190
mating psychology with with
thousands and thousands of images uh

2964
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:35,200
thousands and thousands of images uh
 

2965
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,589
thousands and thousands of images uh
that are not at all representative of

2966
00:55:37,589 --> 00:55:37,599
that are not at all representative of
 

2967
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:39,750
that are not at all representative of
who our actual competition

2968
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:39,760
who our actual competition
 

2969
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,390
who our actual competition
is in in in the mating domain

2970
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:42,400
is in in in the mating domain
 

2971
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,470
is in in in the mating domain
and so i think that um

2972
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:44,480
and so i think that um
 

2973
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,230
and so i think that um
and there's actually evidence on this

2974
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:46,240
and there's actually evidence on this
 

2975
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,870
and there's actually evidence on this
that um uh

2976
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:48,880
that um uh
 

2977
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,710
that um uh
baz luhrmann actually said something

00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:50,720
baz luhrmann actually said something
 

2979
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,630

make you feel ugly you know i think that

2994
00:56:07,829 --> 00:56:07,839
make you feel ugly you know i think that
 

2995
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:08,630
make you feel ugly you know i think that
there's

2996
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:08,640
there's
 

2997
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,710
there's
truth to that that is especially with

2998
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:10,720
truth to that that is especially with
 

2999
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,950
truth to that that is especially with
with women they look at all these images

3000
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:12,960
with women they look at all these images
 

3001
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:13,670
with women they look at all these images
and

3002
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:13,680
and
 

3003
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,750
and
you know of course they're

3004
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:15,760
you know of course they're
 

3005
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,230
you know of course they're
photographed they're photoshopped uh

3006
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:18,240
photographed they're photoshopped uh
 

3007
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,630
photographed they're photoshopped uh
they're they're highly selected and and

3008
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:20,640
they're they're highly selected and and
 

3009
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,710
they're they're highly selected and and
not at all representative

3010
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:22,720
not at all representative
 

3011
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,190
not at all representative
and so women compare themselves to that

3012
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:25,200
and so women compare themselves to that
 

3013
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,670
and so women compare themselves to that
so i think this social comparison is an

3014
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:27,680
so i think this social comparison is an
 

3015
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:28,789
so i think this social comparison is an

00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:31,200
feature of humans i mean males do it
 

3019
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,630
feature of humans i mean males do it
females do it

3020
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:32,640
females do it
 

3021
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,710
females do it
but it's exacerbated in the modern

evolutionarily mismatched ways and so i

3026
00:56:39,349 --> 00:56:39,359
evolutionarily mismatched ways and so i
 

3027
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:40,710
evolutionarily mismatched ways and so i
think i think that it is it is

3031
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,349
destructive it's harmful
there's evidence that um it hurts

3032
00:56:45,349 --> 00:56:45,359
there's evidence that um it hurts
 

3033
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:47,430
there's evidence that um it hurts

so

3036
00:56:48,549 --> 00:56:48,559
so
 

3037
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:50,549
so
here's just another uh

here's just another uh
 

3039

here's just another uh
factoid or fact if you will that at

factoid or fact if you will that at

uh males and females have roughly the

3044
00:56:57,430 --> 00:56:57,440
uh males and females have roughly the
 

3045
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,670
uh males and females have roughly the
same overall average levels of

self-esteem
 

3049
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:02,390
self-esteem
but once

3050
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:02,400
but once
 

3051
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,030
but once
uh puberty hits all of a sudden women's

3052
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:05,040
uh puberty hits all of a sudden women's
 

3053
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,430
uh puberty hits all of a sudden women's
self-esteem starts to drop and i think

3054
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:07,440
self-esteem starts to drop and i think
 

3055
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,109
self-esteem starts to drop and i think
it's because when they enter

3056
00:57:09,109 --> 00:57:09,119
it's because when they enter
 

3057
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:13,190
it's because when they enter
make competition then they start

3058

things
 

3103
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,470
things
um

3104
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:06,480
um
 

3105
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,309
um
i'm criticizing the clickbait bait

3106
00:58:08,309 --> 00:58:08,319
i'm criticizing the clickbait bait
 

3107
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:09,829
i'm criticizing the clickbait bait
nature and not the contents of the

nature and not the contents of the
 

3109
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:12,150

00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:12,160
articles but you know and those articles
 

3111
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,990

hopefully become viral in a way that

3112
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:14,000
hopefully become viral in a way that
 

3113
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,390
hopefully become viral in a way that
makes us rethink about how we

3114
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:16,400
makes us rethink about how we
 

3115
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,870
makes us rethink about how we
build social networks that kind of allow

3116
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:18,880
build social networks that kind of allow
 

3117
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,309
build social networks that kind of allow
us to to easily misrepresent how we look

3118
00:58:22,309 --> 00:58:22,319
us to to easily misrepresent how we look
 

3119
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:25,030
us to to easily misrepresent how we look
when we are quote-unquote influencers

3120
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:25,040
when we are quote-unquote influencers
 

3121
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,670
when we are quote-unquote influencers
and what a mental effect it has on the

3122
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:27,680
and what a mental effect it has on the
 

3123
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:28,789
and what a mental effect it has on the
um

3124
00:58:28,789 --> 00:58:28,799
um
 

3125
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:30,230
um
on young people that look up to those

3126
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:30,240
on young people that look up to those
 

3127
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,309
on young people that look up to those
influencers but i guess you're it's not

3128
00:58:32,309 --> 00:58:32,319
influencers but i guess you're it's not
 

3129
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:34,470

the objectification fundamentally that's

00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:34,480
the objectification fundamentally that's
 

3131
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,470
the objectification fundamentally that's
the problem it's the

3132
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:36,480
the problem it's the
 

3133
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,430
the problem it's the
inaccurate it's the fake news

3134
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:39,440
inaccurate it's the fake news
 

3135
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,270
inaccurate it's the fake news
it's the yeah that's

3136
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:41,280
it's the yeah that's
 

3137
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,430
it's the yeah that's
misrepresentation

3138
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:43,440
misrepresentation
 

3139
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,430
misrepresentation
you still objectify

3140
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:45,440
you still objectify
 

3141
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,390
you still objectify
uh the male body the female body but you

3142
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:48,400
uh the male body the female body but you
 

3143
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,750
uh the male body the female body but you
do so uh while misrepresenting the

3144
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:51,760
do so uh while misrepresenting the
 

3145
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,150
do so uh while misrepresenting the
actual truth and and so you're moving

3146
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:54,160
actual truth and and so you're moving
 

3147
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,589
actual truth and and so you're moving
the average you're moving the standard

3148
00:58:55,589 --> 00:58:55,599
the average you're moving the standard
 

3149
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:57,030
the average you're moving the standard
representation of what a male should

3150
00:58:57,030 --> 00:58:57,040
representation of what a male should
 

3151
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,190
representation of what a male should
look like what a woman should look like

3152
00:58:59,190 --> 00:58:59,200
look like what a woman should look like
 

3153
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,470
look like what a woman should look like
and uh

3154
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:00,480
and uh
 

3155
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,470
and uh
the dishonesty is the problem not the

3156
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:02,480
the dishonesty is the problem not the
 

3157
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,030
the dishonesty is the problem not the
objectification here's just one other

3158
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:05,040
objectification here's just one other
 

3159
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,670
objectification here's just one other
interesting empirical finding on that

3160
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:07,680
interesting empirical finding on that
 

3161
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,990
interesting empirical finding on that
and it has to do with another dimension

3162
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:10,000
and it has to do with another dimension
 

3163
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,150
and it has to do with another dimension
that i think is harmful and and that's

3164
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:12,160
that i think is harmful and and that's
 

3165
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,309
that i think is harmful and and that's
the thinness dimension

3166
00:59:14,309 --> 00:59:14,319
the thinness dimension
 

3167
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:16,470
the thinness dimension
uh and so if you

3168
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:16,480
uh and so if you
 

3169
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,230
uh and so if you
and these are studies originally done by

3170
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:18,240
and these are studies originally done by
 

3171
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,470
and these are studies originally done by
paul rosen but they've been replicated

3172
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:20,480
paul rosen but they've been replicated
 

3173
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:23,190
paul rosen but they've been replicated
where if you ask men okay what is your

3174
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:23,200
where if you ask men okay what is your
 

3175
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,829
where if you ask men okay what is your
ideal figure in a woman and so they have

3176
00:59:25,829 --> 00:59:25,839
ideal figure in a woman and so they have
 

3177
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:28,230
ideal figure in a woman and so they have
these say nine figures that vary from

3178
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:28,240
these say nine figures that vary from
 

3179
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:32,150
these say nine figures that vary from
very very thin to average to to plump

3180
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:32,160
very very thin to average to to plump
 

3181
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,030
very very thin to average to to plump
men

3182
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:33,040

3183
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,270

give it the midpoint they say the the

3184
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:35,280
give it the midpoint they say the the
 

3185
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,589
give it the midpoint they say the the
the midpoint is in

3186
00:59:37,589 --> 00:59:37,599
the midpoint is in
 

3187
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,510
the midpoint is in
relative thinness or plumpness is what i

3188
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:39,520
relative thinness or plumpness is what i
 

3189
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,670
relative thinness or plumpness is what i
value and you ask women

3190
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:41,680
value and you ask women
 

3191
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,710
value and you ask women
what is your ideal body type for you

3192
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:44,720
what is your ideal body type for you
 

3193
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,990
what is your ideal body type for you
they give it they say thinner but then

3194
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:48,000
they give it they say thinner but then
 

3195
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,630
they give it they say thinner but then
if you ask them what do you think males

3196
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:50,640
if you ask them what do you think males
 

3197
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:53,190
if you ask them what do you think males
ideal body type is they put it in

3198
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:53,200
ideal body type is they put it in
 

3199
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,270
ideal body type is they put it in
exactly the same spot that they put

3200
00:59:55,270 --> 00:59:55,280
exactly the same spot that they put
 

3201
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,430
exactly the same spot that they put
their own idea which is

3202
00:59:57,430 --> 00:59:57,440
their own idea which is
 

3203
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,349
their own idea which is
thin and so there's actually an

3204
00:59:59,349 --> 00:59:59,359
thin and so there's actually an
 

3205
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:02,549
thin and so there's actually an
inaccurate perception of how thin

3206
01:00:02,549 --> 01:00:02,559
inaccurate perception of how thin
 

3207
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:05,109
inaccurate perception of how thin
men desire women to be

3208
01:00:05,109 --> 01:00:05,119
men desire women to be
 

3209
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:07,589
men desire women to be
uh and i think that's partly

3210
01:00:07,589 --> 01:00:07,599
uh and i think that's partly
 

3211
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:10,069
uh and i think that's partly
exacerbated by the the fashion industry

3212
01:00:10,069 --> 01:00:10,079
exacerbated by the the fashion industry
 

3213
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:12,710
exacerbated by the the fashion industry
where the the models are often real thin

3214
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:12,720
where the the models are often real thin
 

3215
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:16,630
where the the models are often real thin
and you know they're

3216
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:16,640

 

3217
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,030

the lure is that clothes hang better on

3218
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:19,040
the lure is that clothes hang better on
 

3219
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:22,230
the lure is that clothes hang better on
thin models and then on tv they say you

3220
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:22,240
thin models and then on tv they say you
 

3221
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,870
thin models and then on tv they say you
gain 15 pounds over what you really are

3222
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:24,880
gain 15 pounds over what you really are
 

3223
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,950
gain 15 pounds over what you really are
or whatever but for whatever reason

3224
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:26,960
or whatever but for whatever reason
 

3225
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,990
or whatever but for whatever reason
women misperceive how thin men want them

3226
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:30,000
women misperceive how thin men want them
 

3227
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,470
women misperceive how thin men want them
to be and so you have this is another

01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:32,480
to be and so you have this is another
 

3229
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,150

can i just take a small tangent because
it is such a beautiful uh the sunscreen

let me ask a difficult question now we

3620
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:45,760
let me ask a difficult question now we
 

3621
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:46,950
let me ask a difficult question now we
did pretty good with some difficult

3622
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:46,960
did pretty good with some difficult
 

3623
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,510
did pretty good with some difficult
questions already but

3624
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:49,520
questions already but
 

3625
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,349
questions already but
there are people in this world today who

3626
01:07:51,349 --> 01:07:51,359
there are people in this world today who
 

3627
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,990
there are people in this world today who
believe that gender is purely a social

3628
01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:54,000
believe that gender is purely a social
 

3629
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,589
believe that gender is purely a social
construct

3630
01:07:55,589 --> 01:07:55,599
construct
 

3631
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:59,190
construct
you i think are not one of those people

3632
01:07:59,190 --> 01:07:59,200
you i think are not one of those people
 

3633
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,630
you i think are not one of those people
to you what are the difference between

3634
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:00,640
to you what are the difference between
 

3635
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,950
to you what are the difference between
men and women

3636
01:08:02,950 --> 01:08:02,960
men and women
 

3637
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,710
men and women
how much of those differences are in

3638
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:04,720
how much of those differences are in
 

3639
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,950
how much of those differences are in
nature and how much is nurture

3640
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:06,960
nature and how much is nurture
 

3641
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:10,710
nature and how much is nurture
i guess if we you're asking the question

3642
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:10,720
i guess if we you're asking the question
 

3643
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:13,430
i guess if we you're asking the question
morphologically or psychologically i

3644
01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:13,440
morphologically or psychologically i
 

3645
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,510
morphologically or psychologically i
assume you're asking psychologically the

3646
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:15,520
assume you're asking psychologically the
 

3647
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,189
assume you're asking psychologically the
question is what it is

3648
01:08:17,189 --> 01:08:17,199
question is what it is
 

3649
01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:18,950
question is what it is
and the answer

3650
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:18,960
and the answer
 

3651
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,669
and the answer
sometimes the questions

3652
01:08:21,669 --> 01:08:21,679
sometimes the questions
 

3653
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:23,829
sometimes the questions
don't contain with them the trajectory

3654
01:08:23,829 --> 01:08:23,839
don't contain with them the trajectory
 

3655
01:08:23,839 --> 01:08:27,669
don't contain with them the trajectory
you take with the answer right so

3656
01:08:27,669 --> 01:08:27,679
you take with the answer right so
 

3657
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:30,470
you take with the answer right so
i think i was asking both

3658
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:30,480
i think i was asking both
 

3659
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:33,110
i think i was asking both
and the fact that both our thing is an

3660
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:33,120
and the fact that both our thing is an
 

3661
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,870
and the fact that both our thing is an
interesting thing

3662
01:08:34,870 --> 01:08:34,880
interesting thing
 

3663
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:37,349
interesting thing
yeah so you wrote a book

3664
01:08:37,349 --> 01:08:37,359
yeah so you wrote a book
 

3665
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:39,189
yeah so you wrote a book
textbook i should say evolutionary

3666
01:08:39,189 --> 01:08:39,199
textbook i should say evolutionary
 

3667
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:40,630
textbook i should say evolutionary
psychology

3668
01:08:40,630 --> 01:08:40,640
psychology
 

3669
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:43,349
psychology
right yes those both of those words are

3670
01:08:43,349 --> 01:08:43,359
right yes those both of those words are
 

3671
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:44,709
right yes those both of those words are
in the book title

3672
01:08:44,709 --> 01:08:44,719
in the book title
 

3673
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:47,990
in the book title
psychology that's the human mind yes

3674
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:48,000
psychology that's the human mind yes
 

3675
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,510
psychology that's the human mind yes
yeah how much of gender how much of sex

3676
01:08:51,510 --> 01:08:51,520
yeah how much of gender how much of sex
 

3677
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:53,669
yeah how much of gender how much of sex
is the human mind

3678
01:08:53,669 --> 01:08:53,679
is the human mind
 

3679
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:56,149
is the human mind
and how much of it is the biology the

3680
01:08:56,149 --> 01:08:56,159
and how much of it is the biology the
 

3681
01:08:56,159 --> 01:08:59,110
and how much of it is the biology the
way that i phrase it so i i don't like

3682
01:08:59,110 --> 01:08:59,120
way that i phrase it so i i don't like
 

3683
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,149
way that i phrase it so i i don't like
um

3684
01:09:00,149 --> 01:09:00,159
um
 

3685
01:09:00,159 --> 01:09:02,950
um
sort of dividing the world into two

3686
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:02,960
sort of dividing the world into two
 

3687
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:05,110
sort of dividing the world into two
categories things that are biological

3688
01:09:05,110 --> 01:09:05,120
categories things that are biological
 

3689
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:07,990
categories things that are biological
versus things that are not biological

3690
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:08,000
versus things that are not biological
 

3691
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,590
versus things that are not biological
um

3692
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:09,600
um
 

3693
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,470
um
so the biology is actually defined as

3694
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:12,480
so the biology is actually defined as
 

3695
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:15,430
so the biology is actually defined as
the study of life and life processes and

3696
01:09:15,430 --> 01:09:15,440
the study of life and life processes and
 

3697
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:17,829
the study of life and life processes and
so at that sort of abstract level

3698
01:09:17,829 --> 01:09:17,839
so at that sort of abstract level
 

3699
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:20,789
so at that sort of abstract level
everything we do is biological including

3700
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:20,799
everything we do is biological including
 

3701
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:23,269
everything we do is biological including
culture and our capacity for culture

3702
01:09:23,269 --> 01:09:23,279
culture and our capacity for culture
 

3703
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:25,590
culture and our capacity for culture
which i think is an evolved capacity

3704
01:09:25,590 --> 01:09:25,600
which i think is an evolved capacity
 

3705
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,189
which i think is an evolved capacity
that humans have

3706
01:09:27,189 --> 01:09:27,199
that humans have
 

3707
01:09:27,199 --> 01:09:28,630
that humans have
um

3708
01:09:28,630 --> 01:09:28,640
um
 

3709
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,910
um
when you get to the issue of sex and

3710
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:31,920
when you get to the issue of sex and
 

3711
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:35,510
when you get to the issue of sex and
gender i mean one cut at your question

3712
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:35,520
gender i mean one cut at your question
 

3713
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:36,470
gender i mean one cut at your question
is

3714
01:09:36,470 --> 01:09:36,480
is
 

3715
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:39,349
is
are there universal psychological sex

3716
01:09:39,349 --> 01:09:39,359
are there universal psychological sex
 

3717
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:40,630
are there universal psychological sex
differences

3718
01:09:40,630 --> 01:09:40,640
differences
 

3719
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,870
differences
um and the answer to that question is

3720
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:42,880
um and the answer to that question is
 

3721
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:44,630
um and the answer to that question is
yes there are some

3722
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:44,640
yes there are some
 

3723
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,149
yes there are some
so for example

3724
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:46,159
so for example
 

3725
01:09:46,159 --> 01:09:49,189
so for example
well and this is in in one of your areas

3726
01:09:49,189 --> 01:09:49,199
well and this is in in one of your areas
 

3727
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:51,910
well and this is in in one of your areas
of specialty uh engineering

3728
01:09:51,910 --> 01:09:51,920
of specialty uh engineering
 

3729
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:55,110
of specialty uh engineering
um one of the interesting things is that

3730
01:09:55,110 --> 01:09:55,120
um one of the interesting things is that
 

3731
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:58,870
um one of the interesting things is that
uh it's called the people's thing

3732
01:09:58,870 --> 01:09:58,880
uh it's called the people's thing
 

3733
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,790
uh it's called the people's thing
dimension so

3734
01:10:00,790 --> 01:10:00,800
dimension so
 

3735
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,430
dimension so
do you want an occupation you want a job

3736
01:10:03,430 --> 01:10:03,440
do you want an occupation you want a job
 

3737
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,110
do you want an occupation you want a job
that involves

3738
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:05,120
that involves
 

3739
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,430
that involves
people social interaction

3740
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:07,440
people social interaction
 

3741
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,830
people social interaction
or are you happy with a job that just

3742
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:09,840
or are you happy with a job that just
 

3743
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:13,110
or are you happy with a job that just
involves things mechanical objects or

3744
01:10:13,110 --> 01:10:13,120
involves things mechanical objects or
 

3745
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:15,590
involves things mechanical objects or
computer code or whatever

3746
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:15,600
computer code or whatever
 

3747
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:16,950
computer code or whatever
and this is one of the largest

3748
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:16,960
and this is one of the largest
 

3749
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,189
and this is one of the largest
psychological sex differences that that

3750
01:10:19,189 --> 01:10:19,199
psychological sex differences that that
 

3751
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:21,830
psychological sex differences that that
exists and it's true in every culture

3752
01:10:21,830 --> 01:10:21,840
exists and it's true in every culture
 

3753
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,189
exists and it's true in every culture
so uh in terms of i don't know um

3754
01:10:25,189 --> 01:10:25,199
so uh in terms of i don't know um
 

3755
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:27,510
so uh in terms of i don't know um
magnitude of effects it's a an effect

3756
01:10:27,510 --> 01:10:27,520
magnitude of effects it's a an effect
 

3757
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:28,630
magnitude of effects it's a an effect
size of

3758
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:28,640
size of
 

3759
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,229
size of
more than a standard deviation

3760
01:10:30,229 --> 01:10:30,239
more than a standard deviation
 

3761
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:31,990
more than a standard deviation
difference between the means

3762
01:10:31,990 --> 01:10:32,000
difference between the means
 

3763
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,030
difference between the means
um on this psychological sex difference

3764
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:35,040
um on this psychological sex difference
 

3765
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,510
um on this psychological sex difference
and so one of the interesting things is

3766
01:10:37,510 --> 01:10:37,520
and so one of the interesting things is
 

3767
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,510
and so one of the interesting things is
so if you go to places like go to the

3768
01:10:39,510 --> 01:10:39,520
so if you go to places like go to the
 

3769
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:41,669
so if you go to places like go to the
most

3770
01:10:41,669 --> 01:10:41,679
most
 

3771
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:44,470
most
gender egalitarian cultures in the world

3772
01:10:44,470 --> 01:10:44,480
gender egalitarian cultures in the world
 

3773
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,550
gender egalitarian cultures in the world
so places like sweden

3774
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:46,560
so places like sweden
 

3775
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,550
so places like sweden
uh or norway

3776
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:48,560
uh or norway
 

3777
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:49,590
uh or norway
uh

3778
01:10:49,590 --> 01:10:49,600
uh
 

3779
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,990
uh
which are explicitly

3780
01:10:51,990 --> 01:10:52,000
which are explicitly
 

3781
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,790
which are explicitly
gender egalitarian and and are truly in

3782
01:10:54,790 --> 01:10:54,800
gender egalitarian and and are truly in
 

3783
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,390
gender egalitarian and and are truly in
many many ways

3784
01:10:56,390 --> 01:10:56,400
many many ways
 

3785
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,149
many many ways
and but you allow people freedom of

3786
01:10:58,149 --> 01:10:58,159
and but you allow people freedom of
 

3787
01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:00,070
and but you allow people freedom of
choice the the some of these sex

3788
01:11:00,070 --> 01:11:00,080
choice the the some of these sex
 

3789
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,070
choice the the some of these sex
differences actually get larger the

3790
01:11:02,070 --> 01:11:02,080
differences actually get larger the
 

3791
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:04,390
differences actually get larger the
psychological sex differences and also

3792
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:04,400
psychological sex differences and also
 

3793
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:07,430
psychological sex differences and also
assortment into different occupational

3794
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:07,440
assortment into different occupational
 

3795
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:08,950
assortment into different occupational
uh choices

3796
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:08,960
uh choices
 

3797
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,709
uh choices
um now but this this is not something

3798
01:11:10,709 --> 01:11:10,719
um now but this this is not something
 

3799
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:13,910
um now but this this is not something
that i study i study

3800
01:11:13,910 --> 01:11:13,920
that i study i study
 

3801
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:16,470
that i study i study
mating and

3802
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:16,480
mating and
 

3803
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,950
mating and
the sex differences if you ask what are

3804
01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:18,960
the sex differences if you ask what are
 

3805
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:21,990
the sex differences if you ask what are
the where in what domains are the sex

3806
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:22,000
the where in what domains are the sex
 

3807
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,630
the where in what domains are the sex
differences the largest it turns out

3808
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:24,640
differences the largest it turns out
 

3809
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:27,030
differences the largest it turns out
they occur within the domain of mating

3810
01:11:27,030 --> 01:11:27,040
they occur within the domain of mating
 

3811
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:30,390
they occur within the domain of mating
and sexuality so our evolved sexual

3812
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:30,400
and sexuality so our evolved sexual
 

3813
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,790
and sexuality so our evolved sexual
psychology our evolved mating psychology

3814
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:32,800
psychology our evolved mating psychology
 

3815
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,470
psychology our evolved mating psychology
is to some degree

3816
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:34,480
is to some degree
 

3817
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:37,830
is to some degree
sexually dimorphic okay with the

3818
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:37,840
sexually dimorphic okay with the
 

3819
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:40,790
sexually dimorphic okay with the
uh very important asterisk that we're

3820
01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:40,800
uh very important asterisk that we're
 

3821
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,590
uh very important asterisk that we're
talking about overlapping distributions

3822
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:43,600
talking about overlapping distributions
 

3823
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,430
talking about overlapping distributions
so there are some things that so if you

3824
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:45,440
so there are some things that so if you
 

3825
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:48,630
so there are some things that so if you
look at human morphology um

3826
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:48,640
look at human morphology um
 

3827
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,790
look at human morphology um
we talked about breasts earlier women

3828
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:50,800
we talked about breasts earlier women
 

3829
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,310
we talked about breasts earlier women
have evolved

3830
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:52,320
have evolved
 

3831
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,709
have evolved
functional breasts that's functional for

3832
01:11:54,709 --> 01:11:54,719
functional breasts that's functional for
 

3833
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:56,229
functional breasts that's functional for
lactation

3834
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:56,239
lactation
 

3835
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:59,750
lactation
men don't so there's not no amount of

3836
01:11:59,750 --> 01:11:59,760
men don't so there's not no amount of
 

3837
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,709
men don't so there's not no amount of
culture or social coercion can cause men

3838
01:12:02,709 --> 01:12:02,719
culture or social coercion can cause men
 

3839
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:05,350
culture or social coercion can cause men
to have lactating breasts

3840
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:05,360
to have lactating breasts
 

3841
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:08,149
to have lactating breasts
uh psychologically we don't see

3842
01:12:08,149 --> 01:12:08,159
uh psychologically we don't see
 

3843
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:10,790
uh psychologically we don't see
dimorphism that extreme where something

3844
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:10,800
dimorphism that extreme where something
 

3845
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:11,510
dimorphism that extreme where something
is

3846
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:11,520
is
 

3847
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,830
is
literally present in one sex and totally

3848
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:13,840
literally present in one sex and totally
 

3849
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,669
literally present in one sex and totally
absent in the other so there's overlap

3850
01:12:15,669 --> 01:12:15,679
absent in the other so there's overlap
 

3851
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:17,189
absent in the other so there's overlap
in the distributions

3852
01:12:17,189 --> 01:12:17,199
in the distributions
 

3853
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:19,830
in the distributions
so i mentioned earlier that

3854
01:12:19,830 --> 01:12:19,840
so i mentioned earlier that
 

3855
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,830
so i mentioned earlier that
in the mating domain men men more than

3856
01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:21,840
in the mating domain men men more than
 

3857
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,990
in the mating domain men men more than
women on average prioritize physical

3858
01:12:23,990 --> 01:12:24,000
women on average prioritize physical
 

3859
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,070
women on average prioritize physical
appearance physical attractiveness

3860
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:26,080
appearance physical attractiveness
 

3861
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,470
appearance physical attractiveness
relative youth women on average

3862
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:28,480
relative youth women on average
 

3863
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,870
relative youth women on average
prioritize resources resource

3864
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:30,880
prioritize resources resource
 

3865
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:33,030
prioritize resources resource
acquisition qualities that lead to

3866
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:33,040
acquisition qualities that lead to
 

3867
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,030
acquisition qualities that lead to
resource acquisition like status

3868
01:12:35,030 --> 01:12:35,040
resource acquisition like status
 

3869
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,510
resource acquisition like status
ambition industriousness and so forth

3870
01:12:37,510 --> 01:12:37,520
ambition industriousness and so forth
 

3871
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,430
ambition industriousness and so forth
but there's overlap in the distribution

3872
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:39,440
but there's overlap in the distribution
 

3873
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:42,310
but there's overlap in the distribution
so some women place the

3874
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:42,320
so some women place the
 

3875
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,470
so some women place the
total priority on how physically

3876
01:12:44,470 --> 01:12:44,480
total priority on how physically
 

3877
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:46,390
total priority on how physically
attractive the guy is and

3878
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:46,400
attractive the guy is and
 

3879
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,070
attractive the guy is and
uh some men

3880
01:12:48,070 --> 01:12:48,080
uh some men
 

3881
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:49,189
uh some men
view that as

3882
01:12:49,189 --> 01:12:49,199
view that as
 

3883
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:52,950
view that as
irrelevant and and and uh so the the

3884
01:12:52,950 --> 01:12:52,960
irrelevant and and and uh so the the
 

3885
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:55,430
irrelevant and and and uh so the the
point that i'm making is that there are

3886
01:12:55,430 --> 01:12:55,440
point that i'm making is that there are
 

3887
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:58,390
point that i'm making is that there are
there are psychological sex differences

3888
01:12:58,390 --> 01:12:58,400
there are psychological sex differences
 

3889
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:01,110
there are psychological sex differences
that um make some people uncomfortable

3890
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:01,120
that um make some people uncomfortable
 

3891
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,430
that um make some people uncomfortable
um but you know it's one of these things

3892
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:03,440
um but you know it's one of these things
 

3893
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,550
um but you know it's one of these things
where

3894
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:04,560
where
 

3895
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:05,750
where
i'm

3896
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:05,760
i'm
 

3897
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:08,790
i'm
a scientist uh i'm not a

3898
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:08,800
a scientist uh i'm not a
 

3899
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:12,070
a scientist uh i'm not a
political advocate uh um and so i'm i

3900
01:13:12,070 --> 01:13:12,080
political advocate uh um and so i'm i
 

3901
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:14,470
political advocate uh um and so i'm i
adhere to the empirical data on

3902
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:14,480
adhere to the empirical data on
 

3903
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,390
adhere to the empirical data on
empirical data are very strong in these

3904

huge sex differences there

3920
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:33,760
huge sex differences there
 

3921
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:34,950
huge sex differences there
and these have been documented

3922
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:34,960
and these have been documented
 

3923
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:38,070

but
 

3935
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:57,110
but
there's also an issue of um

3936
01:13:57,110 --> 01:13:57,120
there's also an issue of um
 

3937
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,910
there's also an issue of um
levels of analysis levels of abstraction

levels of analysis levels of abstraction
 

3939
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:02,070
levels of analysis levels of abstraction
and how closely you look at the

3940
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:02,080
and how closely you look at the
 

3941
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,830

points to the answer yes to that at
 

3963
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:30,470
points to the answer yes to that at

uh others argue so at one level of
 

3971
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,709

01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:46,390
culturally variable and another level of
abstraction there's universality so

3978
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:46,400
abstraction there's universality so
 

3979
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,550
abstraction there's universality so
here's one example in the mating domain

here's one example in the mating domain
 

3981
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,070
here's one example in the mating domain
of this so

3982

studied the samoan islanders and she

3988

studied the samoan islanders and she
 

3989
01:14:58,159 --> 01:14:59,910
studied the samoan islanders and she
tried to argue basically for the

3990
01:14:59,910 --> 01:14:59,920
tried to argue basically for the
 

3991
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,470
tried to argue basically for the
infinite malleability of things like

3992
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:02,480
infinite malleability of things like
 

3993

she's and she said look at this culture
 

3997
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:09,030
she's and she said look at this culture
the in this culture it's the men who

3998
01:15:09,030 --> 01:15:09,040
the in this culture it's the men who
 

3999
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,790
the in this culture it's the men who
paint their face

4000
01:15:10,790 --> 01:15:10,800
paint their face
 

4001
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,790
paint their face
whereas you know in western cultures

4002
01:15:12,790 --> 01:15:12,800
whereas you know in western cultures
 

4003
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,790
whereas you know in western cultures
it's the women who wear makeup and so

01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:14,800
it's the women who wear makeup and so
 

4005
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,510
it's the women who wear makeup and so
forth well it turns out if you if you

4006
01:15:17,510 --> 01:15:17,520
forth well it turns out if you if you
 

4007
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,669
forth well it turns out if you if you
look carefully at the culture where men

4008
01:15:19,669 --> 01:15:19,679
look carefully at the culture where men
 

4009
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:22,070
look carefully at the culture where men
paint their face they're painting a

4010
01:15:22,070 --> 01:15:22,080
paint their face they're painting a
 

4011
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,630
paint their face they're painting a
war paint on their face they're not

4012
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:24,640
war paint on their face they're not
 

4013
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:25,750
war paint on their face they're not
they're not

4014
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:25,760
they're not
 

4015
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:28,310
they're not
putting on makeup to enhance their cues

4016
01:15:28,310 --> 01:15:28,320
putting on makeup to enhance their cues
 

4017
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,390
putting on makeup to enhance their cues
to youth and cues to health they're

4018
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:30,400
to youth and cues to health they're
 

4019
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,630
to youth and cues to health they're
putting on war paint to make themselves

4020
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:32,640
putting on war paint to make themselves
 

4021
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:35,430
putting on war paint to make themselves
more ferocious or to demarcate what

4022
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:35,440
more ferocious or to demarcate what
 

4023
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,669
more ferocious or to demarcate what
tribe they're in what coalition they're

4024
01:15:37,669 --> 01:15:37,679
tribe they're in what coalition they're
 

4025
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:40,470
tribe they're in what coalition they're
in and so at sort of one level have a

4026
01:15:40,470 --> 01:15:40,480
in and so at sort of one level have a
 

4027
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:42,870
in and so at sort of one level have a
abstraction you could say well there's

4028
01:15:42,870 --> 01:15:42,880
abstraction you could say well there's
 

4029
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:44,709
abstraction you could say well there's
high cultural variability and

4030
01:15:44,709 --> 01:15:44,719
high cultural variability and
 

4031
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:47,350
high cultural variability and
application of face paint but on another

4032
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:47,360
application of face paint but on another
 

4033
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,910
application of face paint but on another
level there's really a fundamental

4034
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:49,920
level there's really a fundamental
 

4035
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:52,470
level there's really a fundamental
functional difference in the purpose to

4036
01:15:52,470 --> 01:15:52,480
functional difference in the purpose to
 

4037
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:57,270
functional difference in the purpose to
which the paint is applied

4038
01:15:57,270 --> 01:15:57,280

 

4039
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:59,590

yeah and then you can abstract the paint

4040
01:15:59,590 --> 01:15:59,600
yeah and then you can abstract the paint
 

4041
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:00,790
yeah and then you can abstract the paint
away and

4042
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:00,800
away and
 

4043
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,870
away and
i mean fashion in general just magnify

4044
01:16:02,870 --> 01:16:02,880
i mean fashion in general just magnify
 

4045
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:04,709
i mean fashion in general just magnify
the characteristics that are appealing

4046
01:16:04,709 --> 01:16:04,719
the characteristics that are appealing
 

4047
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:06,950
the characteristics that are appealing

to the opposite sex because war pain is
 

4049
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,229

probably
 

4051
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:09,990
probably
you know it is you're magnifying the

4052
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:10,000
you know it is you're magnifying the
 

4053
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,270
you know it is you're magnifying the
characteristics that are appealing to

4054

characteristics that are appealing to
 

4055
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:12,470

you write about status prestige and

4148
01:17:51,990 --> 01:17:52,000
you write about status prestige and
 

4149

matter if i'm the big boss
well uh it matters because

4168
01:18:17,590 --> 01:18:17,600

4172
01:18:23,910 --> 01:18:23,920
influences your access to resources and
 

4173
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:26,390

within your within your group
 

4177
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:31,990
within your within your group
and so um this is part of the reason why

4178
01:18:31,990 --> 01:18:32,000
and so um this is part of the reason why
 

4179
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,910
and so um this is part of the reason why
women

4180
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:33,920

he is viewed in the eyes of others
 

4185
01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:42,149
he is viewed in the eyes of others
because high status men have access to

4186
01:18:42,149 --> 01:18:42,159
because high status men have access to
 

4187
01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:45,270
because high status men have access to
to more resources

4188
01:18:45,270 --> 01:18:45,280
to more resources
 

4189
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:47,030
to more resources
it's interesting that you ask about that

4190
01:18:47,030 --> 01:18:47,040
it's interesting that you ask about that
 

4191
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:49,110
it's interesting that you ask about that
because um i've

4192

we published a couple papers on

4198
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:55,199
we published a couple papers on
 

4199
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:57,350
we published a couple papers on
precisely this issue where we looked at

4200
01:18:57,350 --> 01:18:57,360
precisely this issue where we looked at
 

4201
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:00,229
precisely this issue where we looked at
what we call human status criteria that

4202
01:19:00,229 --> 01:19:00,239
what we call human status criteria that
 

4203
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:02,070
what we call human status criteria that
is what are the things that lead to

4204
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:02,080
is what are the things that lead to
 

4205
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:04,709
is what are the things that lead to
increases or decreases in status and we

4206
01:19:04,709 --> 01:19:04,719
increases or decreases in status and we
 

4207
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:07,110
increases or decreases in status and we
did this in 14 different cultures

4208
01:19:07,110 --> 01:19:07,120
did this in 14 different cultures
 

4209
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:08,630
did this in 14 different cultures
and we found some things that are

4210
01:19:08,630 --> 01:19:08,640
and we found some things that are
 

4211
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:09,830
and we found some things that are
universal

4212
01:19:09,830 --> 01:19:09,840
universal
 

4213
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,510
universal
but also some things that are sex

4214
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:11,520
but also some things that are sex
 

4215
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,790
but also some things that are sex
differentiated

4216
01:19:14,790 --> 01:19:14,800

 

4217
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,590

and so universal things like people

4218
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:17,600
and so universal things like people
 

4219
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:20,189
and so universal things like people
value

4220
01:19:20,189 --> 01:19:20,199

 

4221
01:19:20,199 --> 01:19:23,590

trustworthiness they value um

4222
01:19:23,590 --> 01:19:23,600
trustworthiness they value um
 

4223
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:26,790
trustworthiness they value um
intelligence wisdom knowledge

4224
01:19:26,790 --> 01:19:26,800
intelligence wisdom knowledge
 

4225
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:29,350
intelligence wisdom knowledge
so it's even if you go across cultures

4226
01:19:29,350 --> 01:19:29,360
so it's even if you go across cultures
 

4227
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:32,470
so it's even if you go across cultures
uh even to the small-scale cultures that

4228
01:19:32,470 --> 01:19:32,480
uh even to the small-scale cultures that
 

4229
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,550
uh even to the small-scale cultures that
we alluded to earlier

4230
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:34,560
we alluded to earlier
 

4231
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:37,830
we alluded to earlier
uh there are these wise wise people wise

4232
01:19:37,830 --> 01:19:37,840
uh there are these wise wise people wise
 

4233
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,669
uh there are these wise wise people wise
men and wise women in the culture who

4234
01:19:39,669 --> 01:19:39,679
men and wise women in the culture who
 

4235
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:40,470
men and wise women in the culture who
have

4236
01:19:40,470 --> 01:19:40,480
have
 

4237
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:44,070
have
uh people go to for advice for wisdom

4238
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:44,080
uh people go to for advice for wisdom
 

4239
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,910
uh people go to for advice for wisdom
and so having

4240
01:19:45,910 --> 01:19:45,920
and so having
 

4241
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:48,950
and so having
a wide range of knowledge is is a

4242
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:48,960
a wide range of knowledge is is a
 

4243
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:51,110
a wide range of knowledge is is a
universal status criterion

4244
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:51,120
universal status criterion
 

4245
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,550
universal status criterion
and there's some things that are sex

4246
01:19:52,550 --> 01:19:52,560
and there's some things that are sex
 

4247
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:55,110
and there's some things that are sex
differentiated and they often fall into

4248
01:19:55,110 --> 01:19:55,120
differentiated and they often fall into
 

4249
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,350
differentiated and they often fall into
the mating domain as well this is where

4250
01:19:57,350 --> 01:19:57,360
the mating domain as well this is where
 

4251
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,510
the mating domain as well this is where
mating and status are

4252
01:19:59,510 --> 01:19:59,520
mating and status are
 

4253
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:02,390
mating and status are
interestingly related to each other

4254
01:20:02,390 --> 01:20:02,400
interestingly related to each other
 

4255
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:03,590
interestingly related to each other
in that

4256
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:03,600
in that
 

4257
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:06,550
in that
um successful mating increases your

4258
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:06,560
um successful mating increases your
 

4259
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:09,669
um successful mating increases your
status but having high status also gives

4260
01:20:09,669 --> 01:20:09,679
status but having high status also gives
 

4261
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:12,790
status but having high status also gives
you access to more desirable mates

4262
01:20:12,790 --> 01:20:12,800
you access to more desirable mates
 

4263
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,390
you access to more desirable mates
um and so

4264
01:20:14,390 --> 01:20:14,400
um and so
 

4265
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,790
um and so
the game gets harder and harder always

4266
01:20:16,790 --> 01:20:16,800
the game gets harder and harder always
 

4267
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:19,350
the game gets harder and harder always
so wait uh

4268
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:19,360
so wait uh
 

4269
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:20,950
so wait uh
so are we talking about what are the

4270
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:20,960
so are we talking about what are the
 

4271
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:23,189
so are we talking about what are the
characters what what's the role of power

4272
01:20:23,189 --> 01:20:23,199
characters what what's the role of power
 

4273
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:24,550
characters what what's the role of power
and wealth

4274
01:20:24,550 --> 01:20:24,560
and wealth
 

4275
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:25,990
and wealth
those kinds of things

4276
01:20:25,990 --> 01:20:26,000
those kinds of things
 

4277
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,229
those kinds of things
so you said wisdom is universal yeah

4278
01:20:28,229 --> 01:20:28,239
so you said wisdom is universal yeah
 

4279
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:31,110
so you said wisdom is universal yeah
what about wealth and power yeah well uh

4280
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:31,120
what about wealth and power yeah well uh
 

4281
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:32,790
what about wealth and power yeah well uh
well um i guess it depends on what you

4282
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:32,800
well um i guess it depends on what you
 

4283
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:35,350
well um i guess it depends on what you
mean by power so i think of power as the

4284
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:35,360
mean by power so i think of power as the
 

4285
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:38,070
mean by power so i think of power as the
ability to to influence a large number

4286
01:20:38,070 --> 01:20:38,080
ability to to influence a large number
 

4287
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,950
ability to to influence a large number
of people yeah so um

4288
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:40,960
of people yeah so um
 

4289
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,590
of people yeah so um
and this is one of the interesting

4290
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:43,600
and this is one of the interesting
 

4291
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,110
and this is one of the interesting
things about

4292
01:20:45,110 --> 01:20:45,120
things about
 

4293
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:48,149
things about
the fact that cash economies are so

4294
01:20:48,149 --> 01:20:48,159
the fact that cash economies are so
 

4295
01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:50,709
the fact that cash economies are so
are evolutionarily very recent

4296
01:20:50,709 --> 01:20:50,719
are evolutionarily very recent
 

4297
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:52,870
are evolutionarily very recent
in that we're people are like so so i

4298
01:20:52,870 --> 01:20:52,880
in that we're people are like so so i
 

4299
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:55,350
in that we're people are like so so i
guess recently or it's about to happen

4300
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:55,360
guess recently or it's about to happen
 

4301
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:58,310
guess recently or it's about to happen
uh that um elon musk is gonna

4302
01:20:58,310 --> 01:20:58,320
uh that um elon musk is gonna
 

4303
01:20:58,320 --> 01:20:59,669
uh that um elon musk is gonna
buy a

4304
01:20:59,669 --> 01:20:59,679
buy a
 

4305
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:01,430
buy a
okay where to say it happen

4306
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:01,440
okay where to say it happen
 

4307
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,870
okay where to say it happen
is it happening already yeah okay so

4308
01:21:02,870 --> 01:21:02,880
is it happening already yeah okay so
 

4309
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,629
is it happening already yeah okay so
they said like the the

4310
01:21:04,629 --> 01:21:04,639
they said like the the
 

4311
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:06,870
they said like the the
wealthiest or one of the wealthiest men

4312
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:06,880
wealthiest or one of the wealthiest men
 

4313
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:09,270
wealthiest or one of the wealthiest men
on earth has now purchased the most

4314
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:09,280
on earth has now purchased the most
 

4315
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,910
on earth has now purchased the most
influential media platform

4316
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:11,920
influential media platform
 

4317
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:12,709
influential media platform
uh

4318
01:21:12,709 --> 01:21:12,719
uh
 

4319
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:15,830
uh
on earth and so obviously you or i

4320
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:15,840
on earth and so obviously you or i
 

4321
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:17,189
on earth and so obviously you or i
couldn't um

4322
01:21:17,189 --> 01:21:17,199
couldn't um
 

4323
01:21:17,199 --> 01:21:20,149
couldn't um
compete with elon musk and uh

4324
01:21:20,149 --> 01:21:20,159
compete with elon musk and uh
 

4325
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:22,550
compete with elon musk and uh
for the purchase of twitter and so

4326
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:22,560
for the purchase of twitter and so
 

4327
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:25,750
for the purchase of twitter and so
uh the fact that that cash economies

4328
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:25,760
uh the fact that that cash economies
 

4329
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:28,470
uh the fact that that cash economies
allow the stockpiling of unprecedented

4330
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:28,480
allow the stockpiling of unprecedented
 

4331
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:30,550
allow the stockpiling of unprecedented
amounts of wealth

4332
01:21:30,550 --> 01:21:30,560
amounts of wealth
 

4333
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,870
amounts of wealth
produces these tremendous power

4334
01:21:32,870 --> 01:21:32,880
produces these tremendous power
 

4335
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:35,590
produces these tremendous power
differentials that that didn't exist in

4336
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:35,600
differentials that that didn't exist in
 

4337
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,830
differentials that that didn't exist in
in over most of human evolutionary

4338
01:21:37,830 --> 01:21:37,840
in over most of human evolutionary
 

4339
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,590
in over most of human evolutionary
history

4340
01:21:39,590 --> 01:21:39,600
history
 

4341
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,669
history
so their wealth is power but you can

4342
01:21:41,669 --> 01:21:41,679
so their wealth is power but you can
 

4343
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:43,430
so their wealth is power but you can
also be

4344
01:21:43,430 --> 01:21:43,440
also be
 

4345
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:44,550
also be
um

4346
01:21:44,550 --> 01:21:44,560
um
 

4347
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:46,229
um
the power can be attained through other

4348
01:21:46,229 --> 01:21:46,239
the power can be attained through other
 

4349
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:48,950
the power can be attained through other
ways yeah but but but i would say that

4350
01:21:48,950 --> 01:21:48,960
ways yeah but but but i would say that
 

4351
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:50,629
ways yeah but but but i would say that
the interesting thing about

4352
01:21:50,629 --> 01:21:50,639
the interesting thing about
 

4353
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:51,750
the interesting thing about
wealth

4354
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:51,760
wealth
 

4355
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:53,189
wealth
is that it's

4356
01:21:53,189 --> 01:21:53,199
is that it's
 

4357
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:56,709
is that it's
an infinitely fungible resource

4358
01:21:56,709 --> 01:21:56,719
an infinitely fungible resource
 

4359
01:21:56,719 --> 01:21:58,149
an infinitely fungible resource
so you can

4360
01:21:58,149 --> 01:21:58,159
so you can
 

4361
01:21:58,159 --> 01:22:00,950
so you can
use it and translate it into

4362
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:00,960
use it and translate it into
 

4363
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:03,910
use it and translate it into
many many other things like buying a

4364
01:22:03,910 --> 01:22:03,920
many many other things like buying a

people are are developing
 

4383
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:26,149
people are are developing
if you have enough resources you can

4384
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:26,159
if you have enough resources you can
 

4385

4393
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:38,070
tangible things in ways that that you
couldn't ancestrally

4394
01:22:38,070 --> 01:22:38,080
couldn't ancestrally
 

4395
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:38,950
couldn't ancestrally
so

4396
01:22:38,950 --> 01:22:38,960
so
 

4397
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,390
so
that's one really powerful thing but

4398
01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:40,400
that's one really powerful thing but
 

4399
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,229
that's one really powerful thing but
there is still power

4400
01:22:42,229 --> 01:22:42,239
there is still power
 

4401
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:44,790
there is still power
that's correlated but not

4402
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:44,800
that's correlated but not
 

4403
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:47,030
that's correlated but not
intricately connected to what wealth

4404
01:22:47,030 --> 01:22:47,040
intricately connected to what wealth
 

4405
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:48,950
intricately connected to what wealth
which is like being leaders of nations

4406
01:22:48,950 --> 01:22:48,960
which is like being leaders of nations
 

4407
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,629
which is like being leaders of nations
like technically the president of the

4408
01:22:50,629 --> 01:22:50,639
like technically the president of the
 

4409
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:53,510
like technically the president of the
united states salary is not very high

4410
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:53,520
united states salary is not very high
 

4411
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:54,709
united states salary is not very high
right

4412
01:22:54,709 --> 01:22:54,719
right
 

4413
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:57,110
right
presidents and and then you look you go

4414
01:22:57,110 --> 01:22:57,120
presidents and and then you look you go
 

4415
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,030
presidents and and then you look you go
outside of that into the half of the

4416
01:22:59,030 --> 01:22:59,040
outside of that into the half of the
 

4417
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:00,790
outside of that into the half of the
world that's living under authoritarian

4418
01:23:00,790 --> 01:23:00,800
world that's living under authoritarian
 

4419
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:03,669
world that's living under authoritarian
regimes you have dictators

4420
01:23:03,669 --> 01:23:03,679
regimes you have dictators
 

4421
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:05,189
regimes you have dictators
and there's uh

4422
01:23:05,189 --> 01:23:05,199
and there's uh
 

4423
01:23:05,199 --> 01:23:07,189
and there's uh
those those are very powerful usually

4424
01:23:07,189 --> 01:23:07,199
those those are very powerful usually
 

4425
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:08,790
those those are very powerful usually
men

4426
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:08,800
men
 

4427
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,070
men
uh

4428
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:10,080
uh
 

4429
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,910
uh
and

4430
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:11,920
and
 

4431
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,990
and
presumably there's some

4432
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:14,000
presumably there's some
 

4433
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,070
presumably there's some
value there in the meeting selection

4434
01:23:16,070 --> 01:23:16,080
value there in the meeting selection
 

4435
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,870
value there in the meeting selection
aspect yeah yeah absolutely and and it's

4436
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:18,880
aspect yeah yeah absolutely and and it's
 

4437
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:21,350
aspect yeah yeah absolutely and and it's
not by chance that um

4438
01:23:21,350 --> 01:23:21,360
not by chance that um
 

4439
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:23,270
not by chance that um
most of them are men

4440
01:23:23,270 --> 01:23:23,280
most of them are men
 

4441
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:25,270
most of them are men
um and this is

4442
01:23:25,270 --> 01:23:25,280
um and this is
 

4443
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:26,629
um and this is
gonna sound

4444
01:23:26,629 --> 01:23:26,639
gonna sound
 

4445
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:28,950
gonna sound
strange or and hopefully not offensive

4446
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:28,960
strange or and hopefully not offensive
 

4447
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:30,629
strange or and hopefully not offensive
to people but

4448
01:23:30,629 --> 01:23:30,639
to people but
 

4449
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:31,590
to people but
um

4450
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:31,600
um
 

4451
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,750
um
if you ask the question why are why is

4452
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:33,760
if you ask the question why are why is
 

4453
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,750
if you ask the question why are why is
it the case that men are in positions of

4454
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:35,760
it the case that men are in positions of
 

4455
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:37,270
it the case that men are in positions of
power

4456
01:23:37,270 --> 01:23:37,280
power
 

4457
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:40,070
power
so much more so than than women well in

4458
01:23:40,070 --> 01:23:40,080
so much more so than than women well in
 

4459
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:42,550
so much more so than than women well in
part it can be traced to women's mate

4460
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:42,560
part it can be traced to women's mate
 

4461
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,709
part it can be traced to women's mate
preferences so it's one of the sex

4462
01:23:44,709 --> 01:23:44,719
preferences so it's one of the sex
 

4463
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:46,870
preferences so it's one of the sex
differences that women have over

4464
01:23:46,870 --> 01:23:46,880
differences that women have over
 

4465
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:49,350
differences that women have over
revolutionary time preferred men who had

4466
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:49,360
revolutionary time preferred men who had
 

4467
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:52,870
revolutionary time preferred men who had
power status resources

4468
01:23:52,870 --> 01:23:52,880
power status resources
 

4469
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,950
power status resources
etc and what that has done is it's

4470
01:23:54,950 --> 01:23:54,960
etc and what that has done is it's
 

4471
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:57,590
etc and what that has done is it's
created selection pressure on men to

4472
01:23:57,590 --> 01:23:57,600
created selection pressure on men to
 

4473
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,870
created selection pressure on men to
attach a high motivational priority to

4474
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:00,880
attach a high motivational priority to
 

4475
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,470
attach a high motivational priority to
clawing their way up the status

4476
01:24:02,470 --> 01:24:02,480
clawing their way up the status
 

4477
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:06,229
clawing their way up the status
hierarchy um and and uh studies of uh

4478
01:24:06,229 --> 01:24:06,239
hierarchy um and and uh studies of uh
 

4479
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:09,189
hierarchy um and and uh studies of uh
time allocation distribution show this

4480
01:24:09,189 --> 01:24:09,199
time allocation distribution show this
 

4481
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:10,229
time allocation distribution show this
where men

4482
01:24:10,229 --> 01:24:10,239
where men
 

4483
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:12,149
where men
are they're more willing to sacrifice

4484
01:24:12,149 --> 01:24:12,159
are they're more willing to sacrifice
 

4485
01:24:12,159 --> 01:24:14,310
are they're more willing to sacrifice
their their friends their grandmother

4486
01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:14,320
their their friends their grandmother
 

4487
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,629
their their friends their grandmother
their kin or whatever to claw their way

up to the top of status hierarchies

4490
01:24:18,790 --> 01:24:18,800
up to the top of status hierarchies
 

4491
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:21,830
up to the top of status hierarchies
women much less women

4492
01:24:21,830 --> 01:24:21,840
women much less women
 

4493
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,590
women much less women
spend more effort maintaining

4494
01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:23,600
spend more effort maintaining
 

4495
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,070

so forth and so

4500
01:24:29,510 --> 01:24:29,520
so forth and so
 

4501
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:32,790
so forth and so
um and and so in a way uh so

4502
01:24:32,790 --> 01:24:32,800
um and and so in a way uh so
 

4503
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:35,910
um and and so in a way uh so
you could say not only are you uh not

4504
01:24:35,910 --> 01:24:35,920
you could say not only are you uh not
 

4505
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:37,830
you could say not only are you uh not
only are men in positions of power more

4506
01:24:37,830 --> 01:24:37,840
only are men in positions of power more
 

4507
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:40,470
only are men in positions of power more
than women now you're blaming women for

4508
01:24:40,470 --> 01:24:40,480
than women now you're blaming women for
 

4509
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:42,149
than women now you're blaming women for
why they are and it's not it's not a

4510
01:24:42,149 --> 01:24:42,159
why they are and it's not it's not a
 

4511
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:44,550
why they are and it's not it's not a
matter of blame but i think that that

4512
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:44,560
matter of blame but i think that that
 

4513
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:47,189
matter of blame but i think that that
what i just outlined is is an essential

what i just outlined is is an essential
 

4515
01:24:47,199 --> 01:24:49,350
what i just outlined is is an essential
part of the causal process the

4516
01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:49,360
part of the causal process the
 

4517
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:52,070
part of the causal process the
co-evolution of women's mate preferences

4518

co-evolution of women's mate preferences
 

4519

how much do you think these mating

01:24:57,270 --> 01:24:57,280
how much do you think these mating
 

4523
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:59,430
how much do you think these mating
strategies underlie all of human

civilization like what motivates us

4526
01:25:03,510 --> 01:25:03,520
civilization like what motivates us
 

4527
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:06,310
civilization like what motivates us
uh you know there's uh

4528
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:06,320
uh you know there's uh
 

4529
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:08,950
uh you know there's uh
uh becker with the denial of death like

4530
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:08,960
uh becker with the denial of death like
 

4531
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:09,750
uh becker with the denial of death like
what

4532
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:09,760
what
 

4533
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:12,629
what
why do we build castles and bridges and

4534
01:25:12,629 --> 01:25:12,639
why do we build castles and bridges and
 

4535
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:14,390
why do we build castles and bridges and
rockets and

4536
01:25:14,390 --> 01:25:14,400
rockets and
 

4537
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,870
rockets and
the internet and all of this is it some

4538
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:16,880
the internet and all of this is it some
 

4539
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:19,270
the internet and all of this is it some
complex mush or is it underneath at all

4540
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:19,280
complex mush or is it underneath at all
 

4541
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,189
complex mush or is it underneath at all
are we all just trying to get laid

4542
01:25:21,189 --> 01:25:21,199
are we all just trying to get laid
 

4543
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:23,030
are we all just trying to get laid
uh well i wouldn't reduce it to

4544
01:25:23,030 --> 01:25:23,040
uh well i wouldn't reduce it to
 

4545
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:24,229
uh well i wouldn't reduce it to
something

4546
01:25:24,229 --> 01:25:24,239
something
 

4547
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:27,590
something
quite as trying to get laid um but i

4548
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:27,600
quite as trying to get laid um but i
 

4549
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:30,870
quite as trying to get laid um but i
think i think mating is is is certainly

4550
01:25:30,870 --> 01:25:30,880
think i think mating is is is certainly
 

4551
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:31,990
think i think mating is is is certainly
part of it

4552
01:25:31,990 --> 01:25:32,000
part of it
 

4553
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,310
part of it
um i wonder how big of a part because

4554
01:25:34,310 --> 01:25:34,320
um i wonder how big of a part because
 

4555
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:37,750
um i wonder how big of a part because
also with with uh ernest becker the idea

4556
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:37,760
also with with uh ernest becker the idea
 

4557
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:40,149
also with with uh ernest becker the idea
is that we're all trying to achieve an

4558
01:25:40,149 --> 01:25:40,159
is that we're all trying to achieve an
 

4559
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:42,470
is that we're all trying to achieve an
illusion of immortality yeah so we're

4560
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:42,480
illusion of immortality yeah so we're
 

4561
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:44,229
illusion of immortality yeah so we're
trying to create something that outlasts

4562
01:25:44,229 --> 01:25:44,239
trying to create something that outlasts
 

4563
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:46,070
trying to create something that outlasts
us and therefore we create bigger and

4564
01:25:46,070 --> 01:25:46,080
us and therefore we create bigger and
 

4565
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:48,149
us and therefore we create bigger and
bigger things in societies and bridges

4566
01:25:48,149 --> 01:25:48,159
bigger things in societies and bridges
 

4567
01:25:48,159 --> 01:25:50,550
bigger things in societies and bridges
and yeah well i think what's what's

4568
01:25:50,550 --> 01:25:50,560
and yeah well i think what's what's
 

4569
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:54,229
and yeah well i think what's what's
missing from becker's analysis is uh you

4570
01:25:54,229 --> 01:25:54,239
missing from becker's analysis is uh you
 

4571
01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:56,470
missing from becker's analysis is uh you
know i mean it's it's it's a fascinating

4572
01:25:56,470 --> 01:25:56,480
know i mean it's it's it's a fascinating
 

4573
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:58,790
know i mean it's it's it's a fascinating
book to read denial of death but what's

4574
01:25:58,790 --> 01:25:58,800
book to read denial of death but what's
 

4575
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:02,550
book to read denial of death but what's
missing is that i think that the reason

4576
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:02,560
missing is that i think that the reason
 

4577
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:03,990
missing is that i think that the reason
that

4578
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:04,000
that
 

4579
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,709
that
and and again i think it's more men than

4580
01:26:06,709 --> 01:26:06,719
and and again i think it's more men than
 

4581
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:08,310
and and again i think it's more men than
women i think there's a sex difference

4582
01:26:08,310 --> 01:26:08,320
women i think there's a sex difference
 

4583
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:11,669
women i think there's a sex difference
on this that men

4584
01:26:11,669 --> 01:26:11,679

 

4585
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:15,110

want to build a a lasting legacy because

4586
01:26:15,110 --> 01:26:15,120
want to build a a lasting legacy because
 

4587
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:17,830
want to build a a lasting legacy because
that will in turn affect

4588
01:26:17,830 --> 01:26:17,840
that will in turn affect
 

4589
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:20,790
that will in turn affect
their lineage

4590
01:26:20,790 --> 01:26:20,800
their lineage
 

4591
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:24,550
their lineage
and uh although i i do now woody allen

4592
01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:24,560
and uh although i i do now woody allen
 

4593
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:26,550
and uh although i i do now woody allen
is out of favor but i remember this

4594
01:26:26,550 --> 01:26:26,560
is out of favor but i remember this
 

4595
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,550
is out of favor but i remember this
quote from him he said he said he didn't

4596
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:28,560
quote from him he said he said he didn't
 

4597
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,790
quote from him he said he said he didn't
want to achieve immortality through his

01:26:30,790 --> 01:26:30,800
want to achieve immortality through his
 

4599
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:33,590
want to achieve immortality through his
work he wanted to achieve immortality by

4600
01:26:33,590 --> 01:26:33,600
work he wanted to achieve immortality by
 

4601
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:37,110
work he wanted to achieve immortality by
not dying

4602
01:26:37,110 --> 01:26:37,120

 

4603
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:38,950

oh boy the

4604
01:26:38,950 --> 01:26:38,960
oh boy the
 

4605
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:41,270
oh boy the
the funny ones are also

4606
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:41,280
the funny ones are also
 

4607
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:44,790
the funny ones are also
uh deeply flawed often

4608
01:26:44,790 --> 01:26:44,800
uh deeply flawed often
 

4609
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:47,189
uh deeply flawed often
staying on the topic of sex differences

4610
01:26:47,189 --> 01:26:47,199
staying on the topic of sex differences
 

4611
01:26:47,199 --> 01:26:49,510
staying on the topic of sex differences
in a very different way perhaps so

4612
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:49,520
in a very different way perhaps so
 

4613
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:50,709
in a very different way perhaps so
dominance

4614
01:26:50,709 --> 01:26:50,719
dominance
 

4615
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:52,629
dominance
and submissiveness

4616
01:26:52,629 --> 01:26:52,639
and submissiveness
 

4617
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:54,070
and submissiveness
something you've also written about

4618
01:26:54,070 --> 01:26:54,080
something you've also written about
 

4619
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,590
something you've also written about
what's the role of that inside

4620
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:55,600
what's the role of that inside
 

4621
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:58,390
what's the role of that inside
relationships about this human dynamic

4622
01:26:58,390 --> 01:26:58,400
relationships about this human dynamic
 

4623
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:03,350
relationships about this human dynamic
of dominance and submissiveness

4624
01:27:03,350 --> 01:27:03,360

 

4625
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:06,390

is that a feature or a bug

4626
01:27:06,390 --> 01:27:06,400
is that a feature or a bug
 

4627
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,070
is that a feature or a bug
so the the stable state that these

4628
01:27:08,070 --> 01:27:08,080
so the the stable state that these
 

4629
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:10,709
so the the stable state that these
dynamical systems arrive at

4630
01:27:10,709 --> 01:27:10,719
dynamical systems arrive at
 

4631
01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:12,310
dynamical systems arrive at
uh is it good

4632
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:12,320
uh is it good
 

4633
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:13,510
uh is it good
to have an

4634
01:27:13,510 --> 01:27:13,520
to have an
 

4635
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:16,390
to have an
equality within a relationship

4636
01:27:16,390 --> 01:27:16,400
equality within a relationship
 

4637
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,470
equality within a relationship
or is it good to have differences in a

or is it good to have differences in a
 

4639
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,470
or is it good to have differences in a

01:27:20,470 --> 01:27:20,480
relationship uh are you talking about
 

4641
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:22,390
relationship uh are you talking about
romantic relationships or just in human

4642
01:27:22,390 --> 01:27:22,400
romantic relationships or just in human
 

4643
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:25,430
romantic relationships or just in human
relationships romantic probably because

01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:25,440
relationships romantic probably because

01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,110
relationships romantic probably because
unless it could be generalized to human

4646
01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:27,120
unless it could be generalized to human
 

4647
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:28,950
unless it could be generalized to human
relationships perhaps it could be

4648
01:27:28,950 --> 01:27:28,960
relationships perhaps it could be
 

4649
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:30,709
relationships perhaps it could be
generalized to human relationships i

4650
01:27:30,709 --> 01:27:30,719
generalized to human relationships i
 

4651
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:32,149
generalized to human relationships i
wasn't thinking that but perhaps it

4652
01:27:32,149 --> 01:27:32,159
wasn't thinking that but perhaps it
 

4653
01:27:32,159 --> 01:27:34,870
wasn't thinking that but perhaps it
could be but let's start with romantic i

4654
01:27:34,870 --> 01:27:34,880
could be but let's start with romantic i
 

4655
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:37,830
could be but let's start with romantic i
guess one-on-one i'm personally in favor

4656
01:27:37,830 --> 01:27:37,840
guess one-on-one i'm personally in favor
 

4657
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:41,350
guess one-on-one i'm personally in favor
of uh equality uh on that dimension

4658
01:27:41,350 --> 01:27:41,360
of uh equality uh on that dimension
 

4659
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:43,910
of uh equality uh on that dimension
within romantic relationships and

4660
01:27:43,910 --> 01:27:43,920
within romantic relationships and
 

4661
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:45,669
within romantic relationships and
um in the

4662
01:27:45,669 --> 01:27:45,679
um in the
 

4663
01:27:45,679 --> 01:27:46,550
um in the
in

4664
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:46,560
in
 

4665
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,950
in
i don't talk about my personal life uh

4666
01:27:48,950 --> 01:27:48,960
i don't talk about my personal life uh
 

4667
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:51,990
i don't talk about my personal life uh
but um but i've been in relationships uh

4668
01:27:51,990 --> 01:27:52,000
but um but i've been in relationships uh
 

4669
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,310
but um but i've been in relationships uh
and the best ones tend to be those where

4670
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:54,320
and the best ones tend to be those where
 

4671
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:56,709
and the best ones tend to be those where
where there's uh equality and

4672
01:27:56,709 --> 01:27:56,719
where there's uh equality and
 

4673
01:27:56,719 --> 01:27:59,189
where there's uh equality and
one person does not uh dominate the

4674
01:27:59,189 --> 01:27:59,199
one person does not uh dominate the
 

4675
01:27:59,199 --> 01:28:01,669
one person does not uh dominate the
other um but

4676
01:28:01,669 --> 01:28:01,679
other um but
 

4677
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:03,430
other um but
i guess what i was the reason i asked

4678
01:28:03,430 --> 01:28:03,440
i guess what i was the reason i asked
 

4679
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:05,110
i guess what i was the reason i asked
you is in what type of relationships

4680
01:28:05,110 --> 01:28:05,120
you is in what type of relationships
 

4681
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:07,189
you is in what type of relationships
because there are some

4682
01:28:07,189 --> 01:28:07,199
because there are some
 

4683
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:09,910
because there are some
things like coalitions where

4684
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:09,920
things like coalitions where
 

4685
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:12,709
things like coalitions where
hierarchy is very important to the

4686
01:28:12,709 --> 01:28:12,719
hierarchy is very important to the
 

4687
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:14,950
hierarchy is very important to the
function of the coalition

4688
01:28:14,950 --> 01:28:14,960
function of the coalition
 

4689
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:17,910
function of the coalition
so it's like you if you're like a war

4690
01:28:17,910 --> 01:28:17,920
so it's like you if you're like a war
 

4691
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,830
so it's like you if you're like a war
coalition or something in small group

4692
01:28:19,830 --> 01:28:19,840
coalition or something in small group
 

4693
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,110
coalition or something in small group
warfare

4694
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:21,120
warfare
 

4695
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:22,870
warfare
you can't just have equality you have to

4696
01:28:22,870 --> 01:28:22,880
you can't just have equality you have to
 

4697
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,550
you can't just have equality you have to
have um

4698
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:24,560
have um
 

4699
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:26,709
have um
leaders that are

4700
01:28:26,709 --> 01:28:26,719
leaders that are
 

4701
01:28:26,719 --> 01:28:28,790
leaders that are
determining the um

4702
01:28:28,790 --> 01:28:28,800
determining the um
 

4703
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:30,870
determining the um
the battle plan so to speak

4704
01:28:30,870 --> 01:28:30,880
the battle plan so to speak
 

4705
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:33,270
the battle plan so to speak
um and so if you have uh

4706
01:28:33,270 --> 01:28:33,280
um and so if you have uh
 

4707
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,270
um and so if you have uh
you you're you're attacking a

4708
01:28:35,270 --> 01:28:35,280
you you're you're attacking a
 

4709
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:36,950
you you're you're attacking a
neighboring group or something and

4710
01:28:36,950 --> 01:28:36,960
neighboring group or something and
 

4711
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:38,709
neighboring group or something and
everyone gets an equal say it's not

4712
01:28:38,709 --> 01:28:38,719
everyone gets an equal say it's not
 

4713
01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:41,669
everyone gets an equal say it's not
gonna work that way and so we tend to

4714
01:28:41,669 --> 01:28:41,679
gonna work that way and so we tend to
 

4715
01:28:41,679 --> 01:28:46,070
gonna work that way and so we tend to
appoint as leaders those who are

4716
01:28:46,070 --> 01:28:46,080

 

4717
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,750

just not always work out well but those

4718
01:28:47,750 --> 01:28:47,760
just not always work out well but those
 

4719
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:50,070
just not always work out well but those
who are presumably wise or good

4720
01:28:50,070 --> 01:28:50,080
who are presumably wise or good
 

4721
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:52,629
who are presumably wise or good
effective leaders and even talk about

4722
01:28:52,629 --> 01:28:52,639
effective leaders and even talk about
 

4723
01:28:52,639 --> 01:28:53,990
effective leaders and even talk about
and i'm sure you're

4724
01:28:53,990 --> 01:28:54,000
and i'm sure you're
 

4725
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,669
and i'm sure you're
familiar with this and i'm not an expert

4726
01:28:55,669 --> 01:28:55,679
familiar with this and i'm not an expert
 

4727
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:57,590
familiar with this and i'm not an expert
on this but you know wartime leaders

4728
01:28:57,590 --> 01:28:57,600
on this but you know wartime leaders
 

4729
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,149
on this but you know wartime leaders
versus peacetime leaders and so again it

4730
01:29:00,149 --> 01:29:00,159
versus peacetime leaders and so again it
 

4731
01:29:00,159 --> 01:29:01,510
versus peacetime leaders and so again it
depends on

4732
01:29:01,510 --> 01:29:01,520
depends on
 

4733
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:04,310
depends on
you know what the goal is of the group

4734
01:29:04,310 --> 01:29:04,320
you know what the goal is of the group
 

4735
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,629
you know what the goal is of the group
that you are a part of

4736
01:29:06,629 --> 01:29:06,639
that you are a part of
 

4737
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:09,830
that you are a part of
um and so and so i think there is

4738
01:29:09,830 --> 01:29:09,840
um and so and so i think there is
 

4739
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:12,229
um and so and so i think there is
functionality and utility

4740
01:29:12,229 --> 01:29:12,239
functionality and utility
 

4741
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:15,990
functionality and utility
to a lot of our evol psychology of

4742
01:29:15,990 --> 01:29:16,000
to a lot of our evol psychology of
 

4743
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,910
to a lot of our evol psychology of
status and dominance and submissiveness

4744
01:29:19,910 --> 01:29:19,920
status and dominance and submissiveness
 

4745
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:21,590
status and dominance and submissiveness
so for example

4746
01:29:21,590 --> 01:29:21,600
so for example
 

4747
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:23,350
so for example
and you have to look at the individual

4748
01:29:23,350 --> 01:29:23,360
and you have to look at the individual
 

4749
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:24,709
and you have to look at the individual
psychology and this is actually

4750
01:29:24,709 --> 01:29:24,719
psychology and this is actually
 

4751
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:27,110
psychology and this is actually
something i'm currently studying um

4752
01:29:27,110 --> 01:29:27,120
something i'm currently studying um
 

4753
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:30,149
something i'm currently studying um
again with with patrick durkee

4754
01:29:30,149 --> 01:29:30,159
again with with patrick durkee
 

4755
01:29:30,159 --> 01:29:31,990
again with with patrick durkee
where

4756
01:29:31,990 --> 01:29:32,000
where
 

4757
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,910
where
one advantage of these status

4758
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:33,920
one advantage of these status
 

4759
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:35,669
one advantage of these status
hierarchies is that you're not always

4760
01:29:35,669 --> 01:29:35,679
hierarchies is that you're not always
 

4761
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:36,870
hierarchies is that you're not always
battling

4762
01:29:36,870 --> 01:29:36,880
battling
 

4763
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:40,390
battling
you know so you determine um

4764
01:29:40,390 --> 01:29:40,400
you know so you determine um
 

4765
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:41,590
you know so you determine um
and that's why

4766
01:29:41,590 --> 01:29:41,600
and that's why
 

4767
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:44,149
and that's why
here's another sexually dimorphic

4768
01:29:44,149 --> 01:29:44,159
here's another sexually dimorphic
 

4769
01:29:44,159 --> 01:29:46,470
here's another sexually dimorphic
aspect of our psychology

4770
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:46,480
aspect of our psychology
 

4771
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:48,870
aspect of our psychology
formidability assessment so there's

4772
01:29:48,870 --> 01:29:48,880
formidability assessment so there's
 

4773
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:51,510
formidability assessment so there's
there's evidence that males engage in

4774
01:29:51,510 --> 01:29:51,520
there's evidence that males engage in
 

4775
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:54,709
there's evidence that males engage in
this you know can i take this guy or can

4776
01:29:54,709 --> 01:29:54,719
this you know can i take this guy or can
 

4777
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:57,110
this you know can i take this guy or can
he take me like and it's like it's the

4778
01:29:57,110 --> 01:29:57,120
he take me like and it's like it's the
 

4779
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:59,030
he take me like and it's like it's the
entirety of my life yes it's like a

4780
01:29:59,030 --> 01:29:59,040
entirety of my life yes it's like a
 

4781
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,270
entirety of my life yes it's like a
spontaneous assessment of of

4782
01:30:01,270 --> 01:30:01,280
spontaneous assessment of of
 

4783
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:02,790
spontaneous assessment of of
formidability

4784
01:30:02,790 --> 01:30:02,800
formidability
 

4785
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:03,510
formidability
and

4786
01:30:03,510 --> 01:30:03,520
and
 

4787
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:06,790
and
and it also the that information is

4788
01:30:06,790 --> 01:30:06,800
and it also the that information is
 

4789
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:09,030
and it also the that information is
critical because that means like who you

4790
01:30:09,030 --> 01:30:09,040
critical because that means like who you
 

4791
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:10,470
critical because that means like who you
should not

4792
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:10,480
should not
 

4793
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:13,110
should not
challenge or or who you can challenge

4794
01:30:13,110 --> 01:30:13,120
challenge or or who you can challenge
 

4795
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:15,830
challenge or or who you can challenge
with impunity impunity so

4796
01:30:15,830 --> 01:30:15,840
with impunity impunity so
 

4797
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:19,030
with impunity impunity so
um and and there's functionality to

4798
01:30:19,030 --> 01:30:19,040
um and and there's functionality to
 

4799
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:21,910
um and and there's functionality to
submitting uh as well you know because

4800
01:30:21,910 --> 01:30:21,920
submitting uh as well you know because
 

4801
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:24,390
submitting uh as well you know because
you you defer to someone

4802
01:30:24,390 --> 01:30:24,400
you you defer to someone
 

4803
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,390
you you defer to someone
so that you don't get vanquished and you

4804
01:30:26,390 --> 01:30:26,400
so that you don't get vanquished and you
 

4805
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,390
so that you don't get vanquished and you
live to see another day

4806
01:30:28,390 --> 01:30:28,400
live to see another day
 

4807
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:29,270
live to see another day
uh

4808
01:30:29,270 --> 01:30:29,280
uh
 

4809
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:31,030
uh
so i think we actually have a very rich

4810
01:30:31,030 --> 01:30:31,040
so i think we actually have a very rich
 

4811
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:33,750
so i think we actually have a very rich
psychology of status hierarchies and

4812
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:33,760
psychology of status hierarchies and
 

4813
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:35,750
psychology of status hierarchies and
dominance and submissiveness so

4814
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:35,760
dominance and submissiveness so
 

4815
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:38,709
dominance and submissiveness so
especially sort of uh

4816
01:30:38,709 --> 01:30:38,719
especially sort of uh
 

4817
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:40,629
especially sort of uh

4821
01:30:42,159 --> 01:30:43,030
conflict
yes

4822
01:30:43,030 --> 01:30:43,040
yes
 

4823
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:47,030
yes
but back to relationships

4824
01:30:47,030 --> 01:30:47,040

 

4825
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:49,750

so maybe phrased another way

4826
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:49,760
so maybe phrased another way
 

4827
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:53,189
so maybe phrased another way

and i mean there's one hypothesis that
 

5323
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:09,430
and i mean there's one hypothesis that
was put forward by um

5324
01:40:09,430 --> 01:40:09,440
was put forward by um
 

5325
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:11,910
was put forward by um
an israeli biologist named amos amos

um
 

5345
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,430
um
inflicting costs

5346
01:40:31,430 --> 01:40:31,440
inflicting costs
 

5347
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:33,669
inflicting costs
or emotional liability is a way of

inflicting costs
and what he argues is it's the testing

5352
01:40:37,910 --> 01:40:37,920
and what he argues is it's the testing
 

5353
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:39,830
and what he argues is it's the testing
of a bond if the person's willing to

5354
01:40:39,830 --> 01:40:39,840
of a bond if the person's willing to
 

5355
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:40,950
of a bond if the person's willing to
tolerate

you know this level of stress this level

5358
01:40:43,750 --> 01:40:43,760
you know this level of stress this level
 

5359
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:45,510
you know this level of stress this level
of cost imposition

5360
01:40:45,510 --> 01:40:45,520
of cost imposition
 

5361
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:46,870
of cost imposition
then that means they must be very

5362
01:40:46,870 --> 01:40:46,880
then that means they must be very
 

5363
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:48,229
then that means they must be very
committed to me

5364
01:40:48,229 --> 01:40:48,239

5635
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:45,430
relationship with a desirable partner
doesn't mean that

5636
01:45:45,430 --> 01:45:45,440
doesn't mean that
 

5637
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:47,590
doesn't mean that
you know you've finished solving the

5638
01:45:47,590 --> 01:45:47,600
you know you've finished solving the
 

5639
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:49,350

problems of mating that you need to

5640

and then there's also dissatisfaction
within the relationship so your partner

01:46:06,709 --> 01:46:06,719
within the relationship so your partner
 

5655
01:46:06,719 --> 01:46:07,910
within the relationship so your partner
might become

um like
a little bit

5980
01:52:01,589 --> 01:52:01,599

5988
01:52:10,790 --> 01:52:10,800
another uh interesting wrinkle that i
 

5989
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:13,030
another uh interesting wrinkle that i
also talk about in the book is

5990
01:52:13,030 --> 01:52:13,040
also talk about in the book is
 

5991
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:15,750
also talk about in the book is
sometimes people intentionally evoke

5992
01:52:15,750 --> 01:52:15,760
sometimes people intentionally evoke
 

5993
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:18,629
sometimes people intentionally evoke
jealousy in their partner

5994
01:52:18,629 --> 01:52:18,639
jealousy in their partner
 

5995
01:52:18,639 --> 01:52:21,109
jealousy in their partner
and i think that's also a kind of

5996
01:52:21,109 --> 01:52:21,119
and i think that's also a kind of
 

5997
01:52:21,119 --> 01:52:24,390
and i think that's also a kind of
testing of a bond uh kind of issue yeah

5998
01:52:24,390 --> 01:52:24,400
testing of a bond uh kind of issue yeah
 

5999

testing of a bond uh kind of issue yeah
so and

6000
01:52:26,070 --> 01:52:26,080
so and
 

6001
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:29,030
so and
especially women but i think both sexes

6002
01:52:29,030 --> 01:52:29,040
especially women but i think both sexes
 

6003
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:32,550
especially women but i think both sexes
interpret a total absence of jealousy as

6004
01:52:32,550 --> 01:52:32,560
interpret a total absence of jealousy as
 

6005
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:33,990
interpret a total absence of jealousy as
a sign that their partner is not

6006
01:52:33,990 --> 01:52:34,000
a sign that their partner is not
 

6007
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,669
a sign that their partner is not
sufficiently committed to them or

6008
01:52:35,669 --> 01:52:35,679
sufficiently committed to them or

always wondered why the violence

6082

always wondered why the violence
 

6083
01:53:51,679 --> 01:53:55,189
always wondered why the violence
is directed towards the partner versus

6084
01:53:55,189 --> 01:53:55,199
is directed towards the partner versus
 

6085
01:53:55,199 --> 01:53:57,430
is directed towards the partner versus
the person who did the yeah it's

6086
01:53:57,430 --> 01:53:57,440
the person who did the yeah it's
 

6087
01:53:57,440 --> 01:53:59,750
the person who did the yeah it's
the other male tends to be evenly split

6088
01:53:59,750 --> 01:53:59,760
the other male tends to be evenly split
 

6089
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:01,189
the other male tends to be evenly split
um so

6090
01:54:01,189 --> 01:54:01,199
um so
 

6091
01:54:01,199 --> 01:54:04,070
um so
sometimes and that's i mean

6092
01:54:04,070 --> 01:54:04,080
sometimes and that's i mean
 

6093
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:06,790
sometimes and that's i mean
men especially uh when someone poaches

6094
01:54:06,790 --> 01:54:06,800

fantasies
which

6100
01:54:12,149 --> 01:54:12,159
which
 

6101
01:54:12,159 --> 01:54:13,669
which
well equally specific towards the mate

6102
01:54:13,669 --> 01:54:13,679
well equally specific towards the mate
 

6103
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:15,750

6107
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:18,950
split so so it's uh
um

6108
01:54:18,950 --> 01:54:18,960
um
 

6109
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:22,390
um
i think the the non-lethal violence

6110
01:54:22,390 --> 01:54:22,400
i think the the non-lethal violence
 

6111
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:25,589
i think the the non-lethal violence
uh tends to be more directed toward the

6112
01:54:25,589 --> 01:54:25,599
uh tends to be more directed toward the
 

6113
01:54:25,599 --> 01:54:29,750
uh tends to be more directed toward the
mate because it's it's and this is a

6114
01:54:29,750 --> 01:54:29,760
mate because it's it's and this is a
 

6115
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:32,310
mate because it's it's and this is a
horrible thing of male sexual psychology

6116
01:54:32,310 --> 01:54:32,320
horrible thing of male sexual psychology
 

6117
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:33,990
horrible thing of male sexual psychology
but i think part of the violence is

6118
01:54:33,990 --> 01:54:34,000
but i think part of the violence is
 

6119
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:35,109
but i think part of the violence is
functional

6120
01:54:35,109 --> 01:54:35,119
functional
 

6121
01:54:35,119 --> 01:54:37,990
functional

6122
01:54:37,990 --> 01:54:38,000
in the sense that it's designed to
 

6123
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,229
in the sense that it's designed to
keep a mate and prevent her from

6295
01:57:37,360 --> 01:57:40,229

species so pair bonding is one of the

6296
01:57:40,229 --> 01:57:40,239
species so pair bonding is one of the
 

6297
01:57:40,239 --> 01:57:42,550
species so pair bonding is one of the
strategies purebond long-term mating is

6298
01:57:42,550 --> 01:57:42,560
strategies purebond long-term mating is
 

6299
01:57:42,560 --> 01:57:44,790
strategies purebond long-term mating is
one of the strategies but that doesn't

one of the strategies but that doesn't
 

6301
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:47,109

02:01:23,280 --> 02:01:25,669
former student of mine uh barry cooley
did a really interesting study of uh

6502
02:01:25,669 --> 02:01:25,679
did a really interesting study of uh
 

6503
02:01:25,679 --> 02:01:27,109
did a really interesting study of uh
analysis of this

6504
02:01:27,109 --> 02:01:27,119
analysis of this
 

6505
02:01:27,119 --> 02:01:28,790
analysis of this
reality show called cheaters i've

6506
02:01:28,790 --> 02:01:28,800
reality show called cheaters i've
 

6507
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:30,470
reality show called cheaters i've
actually never seen it but

6508
02:01:30,470 --> 02:01:30,480
actually never seen it but
 

6509
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:33,669
actually never seen it but
where where if you suspect your partner

6510
02:01:33,669 --> 02:01:33,679
where where if you suspect your partner
 

6511
02:01:33,679 --> 02:01:37,430
where where if you suspect your partner
of cheating then the detective from the

6512
02:01:37,430 --> 02:01:37,440
of cheating then the detective from the
 

6513
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:39,990
of cheating then the detective from the
tv team will follow the person

6514
02:01:39,990 --> 02:01:40,000
tv team will follow the person
 

6515
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,070
tv team will follow the person
uh and then they'll call up and say

6516
02:01:42,070 --> 02:01:42,080
uh and then they'll call up and say
 

6517
02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:44,149
uh and then they'll call up and say
we've just seen you found your husband

6518
02:01:44,149 --> 02:01:44,159
we've just seen you found your husband
 

6519
02:01:44,159 --> 02:01:46,470
we've just seen you found your husband
here in the no-tell motel do you want to

6520
02:01:46,470 --> 02:01:46,480
here in the no-tell motel do you want to
 

6521
02:01:46,480 --> 02:01:48,790
here in the no-tell motel do you want to
come down and talk to him and so the and

6522
02:01:48,790 --> 02:01:48,800
come down and talk to him and so the and
 

6523
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:51,109
come down and talk to him and so the and
so what he analyzed though was the

6524
02:01:51,109 --> 02:01:51,119
so what he analyzed though was the
 

6525
02:01:51,119 --> 02:01:53,510
so what he analyzed though was the
verbal interrogations that people had

6526
02:01:53,510 --> 02:01:53,520
verbal interrogations that people had
 

6527
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:56,709
verbal interrogations that people had
when they confronted their partner and

6528
02:01:56,709 --> 02:01:56,719
when they confronted their partner and
 

6529
02:01:56,719 --> 02:01:58,629
when they confronted their partner and
women wanted to know

6530
02:01:58,629 --> 02:01:58,639
women wanted to know
 

6531
02:01:58,639 --> 02:02:00,950
women wanted to know
are you in love with her

6532
02:02:00,950 --> 02:02:00,960
are you in love with her
 

6533
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:02,790
are you in love with her
men wanted to know

6534
02:02:02,790 --> 02:02:02,800
men wanted to know
 

6535
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:04,470
men wanted to know
did you fuck him

6536
02:02:04,470 --> 02:02:04,480
did you fuck him
 

6537
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:06,870
did you fuck him
or did you have sex with them and so is

6538
02:02:06,870 --> 02:02:06,880
or did you have sex with them and so is
 

6539
02:02:06,880 --> 02:02:09,430
or did you have sex with them and so is
it's this sex difference in sensitivity

6540
02:02:09,430 --> 02:02:09,440
it's this sex difference in sensitivity
 

6541
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:10,550
it's this sex difference in sensitivity
to these

6542
02:02:10,550 --> 02:02:10,560
to these
 

6543
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:12,950
to these
different cues of infidelity and and of

6544
02:02:12,950 --> 02:02:12,960
different cues of infidelity and and of
 

6545
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:14,470
different cues of infidelity and and of
course there's there's an evolutionary

6546
02:02:14,470 --> 02:02:14,480
course there's there's an evolutionary
 

6547
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:17,510
course there's there's an evolutionary
logic to this to this sex difference and

6548
02:02:17,510 --> 02:02:17,520
logic to this to this sex difference and
 

6549
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:19,990
logic to this to this sex difference and
it's been replicated not not the cheater

6550
02:02:19,990 --> 02:02:20,000
it's been replicated not not the cheater
 

6551
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:21,510
it's been replicated not not the cheater
study but um

6552
02:02:21,510 --> 02:02:21,520
study but um
 

6553
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:23,669
study but um
the hypothetical

6554
02:02:23,669 --> 02:02:23,679
the hypothetical
 

6555
02:02:23,679 --> 02:02:25,669
the hypothetical
sophie's choice studies been replicated

6556
02:02:25,669 --> 02:02:25,679
sophie's choice studies been replicated
 

6557
02:02:25,679 --> 02:02:28,790
sophie's choice studies been replicated
now in sweden and china and you know

6558
02:02:28,790 --> 02:02:28,800
now in sweden and china and you know
 

6559
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:30,790
now in sweden and china and you know
it's a universal sex difference

6560
02:02:30,790 --> 02:02:30,800
it's a universal sex difference
 

6561
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:32,790
it's a universal sex difference
so given that sex difference and you

6562
02:02:32,790 --> 02:02:32,800
so given that sex difference and you
 

6563
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:34,950
so given that sex difference and you
mentioned another one that just returned

6564
02:02:34,950 --> 02:02:34,960
mentioned another one that just returned
 

6565
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:36,550
mentioned another one that just returned
to which is uh

6566
02:02:36,550 --> 02:02:36,560
to which is uh
 

6567
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:38,470
to which is uh
in the engineering disciplines

i observed this anecdotally a lot and
 

6579
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:50,550
i observed this anecdotally a lot and
the reason i observed it is i was

6580

the reason i observed it is i was
 

6581
02:02:50,560 --> 02:02:52,950
the reason i observed it is i was
confused so i care a lot about robots

6582
02:02:52,950 --> 02:02:52,960
confused so i care a lot about robots
 

6583
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:55,990
confused so i care a lot about robots
i'm a robotics person and so a lot of

6584
02:02:55,990 --> 02:02:56,000
i'm a robotics person and so a lot of
 

6585
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,550
i'm a robotics person and so a lot of
males in the robotics community really

6586
02:02:58,550 --> 02:02:58,560
males in the robotics community really
 

6587
02:02:58,560 --> 02:03:00,070
males in the robotics community really
didn't care about the what's called the

6588
02:03:00,070 --> 02:03:00,080
didn't care about the what's called the
 

6589
02:03:00,080 --> 02:03:02,470
didn't care about the what's called the
human robot interaction problem which is

6590
02:03:02,470 --> 02:03:02,480
human robot interaction problem which is
 

6591
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:04,070
human robot interaction problem which is
like robots when they interact with

6592
02:03:04,070 --> 02:03:04,080
like robots when they interact with
 

6593
02:03:04,080 --> 02:03:05,030
like robots when they interact with
humans

and then a lot of females all brilliant
 

6597
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:10,870
and then a lot of females all brilliant
in in the robotics community cared about

6598
02:03:10,870 --> 02:03:10,880
in in the robotics community cared about
 

6599
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:12,550
in in the robotics community cared about
the human robot interaction they cared

6600
02:03:12,550 --> 02:03:12,560
the human robot interaction they cared
 

6601
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:14,950
the human robot interaction they cared
about the human the what the robot

6602
02:03:14,950 --> 02:03:14,960
about the human the what the robot
 

6603

about the human the what the robot
colleague communicates with the human in

the picture human in the loop
 

6607
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:20,310
the picture human in the loop
and i was really confused like because

6608
02:03:20,310 --> 02:03:20,320
and i was really confused like because
 

6609
02:03:20,320 --> 02:03:23,270
and i was really confused like because
the difference to me in my anecdotal

6610
02:03:23,270 --> 02:03:23,280
the difference to me in my anecdotal
 

6611

interactions
but the the n is quite large there like

6614
02:03:27,589 --> 02:03:27,599
but the the n is quite large there like
 

6615
02:03:27,599 --> 02:03:29,430
but the the n is quite large there like
i you know i'm in the robotics community

6616
02:03:29,430 --> 02:03:29,440
i you know i'm in the robotics community
 

6617
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:31,669
i you know i'm in the robotics community
i know a lot of people yeah and i was

6618
02:03:31,669 --> 02:03:31,679
i know a lot of people yeah and i was
 

6619
02:03:31,679 --> 02:03:34,470
i know a lot of people yeah and i was
confused because for me

6620
02:03:34,470 --> 02:03:34,480
confused because for me
 

6621
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:36,310
confused because for me
i really care about human robot

6622
02:03:36,310 --> 02:03:36,320
i really care about human robot
 

6623
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:39,510
i really care about human robot
interaction i i see i care about both a

6624
02:03:39,510 --> 02:03:39,520
interaction i i see i care about both a
 

6625
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:40,629
interaction i i see i care about both a
lot

6626
02:03:40,629 --> 02:03:40,639
lot
 

6627
02:03:40,639 --> 02:03:41,510
lot
and

6628
02:03:41,510 --> 02:03:41,520
and
 

6629

and
and

6630
02:03:42,470 --> 02:03:42,480
and
 

6631
02:03:42,480 --> 02:03:43,990
and
in the same thing here in terms of

6632
02:03:43,990 --> 02:03:44,000
in the same thing here in terms of
 

6633
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,750
in the same thing here in terms of
emotional cheating versus physical

6634
02:03:45,750 --> 02:03:45,760
emotional cheating versus physical
 

6635
02:03:45,760 --> 02:03:46,790
emotional cheating versus physical
cheating

6636
02:03:46,790 --> 02:03:46,800
cheating
 

6637
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:48,870
cheating
i care a lot about both and i have like

6638
02:03:48,870 --> 02:03:48,880
i care a lot about both and i have like
 

6639
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:50,870
i care a lot about both and i have like
this oscillating brain so i wonder what

6640
02:03:50,870 --> 02:03:50,880
this oscillating brain so i wonder what
 

6641
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:52,229
this oscillating brain so i wonder what
that says about

6642
02:03:52,229 --> 02:03:52,239
that says about
 

6643
02:03:52,239 --> 02:03:54,950
that says about
my brain so i often wonder this because

6644
02:03:54,950 --> 02:03:54,960
my brain so i often wonder this because
 

6645
02:03:54,960 --> 02:03:57,350
my brain so i often wonder this because
there's specific sex differences that

6646
02:03:57,350 --> 02:03:57,360
there's specific sex differences that
 

6647
02:03:57,360 --> 02:03:59,109
there's specific sex differences that
are represented in the data in the

6648
02:03:59,109 --> 02:03:59,119
are represented in the data in the
 

6649
02:03:59,119 --> 02:04:01,350
are represented in the data in the
literature and i seem to oscillate

6650
02:04:01,350 --> 02:04:01,360
literature and i seem to oscillate
 

6651
02:04:01,360 --> 02:04:02,950
literature and i seem to oscillate
depending on mood

6652
02:04:02,950 --> 02:04:02,960
depending on mood
 

6653
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:05,189
depending on mood
yeah and i wonder what that says about

6654
02:04:05,189 --> 02:04:05,199
yeah and i wonder what that says about
 

6655
02:04:05,199 --> 02:04:06,069
yeah and i wonder what that says about
me

6656
02:04:06,069 --> 02:04:06,079
me
 

6657
02:04:06,079 --> 02:04:08,629
me
why do i care so much about that robot

6658
02:04:08,629 --> 02:04:08,639
why do i care so much about that robot
 

6659
02:04:08,639 --> 02:04:09,750
why do i care so much about that robot
on the floor

6660
02:04:09,750 --> 02:04:09,760
on the floor
 

6661
02:04:09,760 --> 02:04:11,430
on the floor
i care not

i guess what i would say this gets back

6670
02:04:20,950 --> 02:04:20,960
i guess what i would say this gets back
 

6671
02:04:20,960 --> 02:04:23,750
i guess what i would say this gets back
to our earlier discussion of agency and

6672
02:04:23,750 --> 02:04:23,760
to our earlier discussion of agency and
 

6673
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:26,069
to our earlier discussion of agency and
communion where

6674
02:04:26,069 --> 02:04:26,079
communion where
 

6675
02:04:26,079 --> 02:04:28,310
communion where
i actually think that

6676
02:04:28,310 --> 02:04:28,320
i actually think that
 

6677
02:04:28,320 --> 02:04:30,229
i actually think that
it's a sign of being

6678
02:04:30,229 --> 02:04:30,239
it's a sign of being
 

6679
02:04:30,239 --> 02:04:33,350
it's a sign of being
well balanced to have both capacities

6680
02:04:33,350 --> 02:04:33,360
well balanced to have both capacities
 

6681
02:04:33,360 --> 02:04:35,589
well balanced to have both capacities
uh within use and so

6682
02:04:35,589 --> 02:04:35,599
uh within use and so
 

6683
02:04:35,599 --> 02:04:36,950
uh within use and so
you get

6684
02:04:36,950 --> 02:04:36,960
you get
 

6685
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:39,430
you get
people who are um

6686
02:04:39,430 --> 02:04:39,440
people who are um
 

6687
02:04:39,440 --> 02:04:41,589
people who are um
unimodal or do they just have one mode

6688
02:04:41,589 --> 02:04:41,599
unimodal or do they just have one mode
 

6689
02:04:41,599 --> 02:04:43,350
unimodal or do they just have one mode
of operating let's say it's the thing

6690
02:04:43,350 --> 02:04:43,360
of operating let's say it's the thing
 

6691
02:04:43,360 --> 02:04:45,750
of operating let's say it's the thing
mode which which engineers tend to be

6692
02:04:45,750 --> 02:04:45,760
mode which which engineers tend to be
 

6693
02:04:45,760 --> 02:04:47,990
mode which which engineers tend to be
good at you know you have to be good at

6695
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,550
good at you know you have to be good at
it to be a good engineer because things

6696
02:04:50,550 --> 02:04:50,560
it to be a good engineer because things
 

6697
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:52,550
it to be a good engineer because things
have to actually work yes you know it's

6698
02:04:52,550 --> 02:04:52,560
have to actually work yes you know it's
 

6699
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:54,870
have to actually work yes you know it's
not in some you know dream or

6700
02:04:54,870 --> 02:04:54,880
not in some you know dream or
 

6701
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:56,790
not in some you know dream or
hypothetical state things have to have

6702
02:04:56,790 --> 02:04:56,800
hypothetical state things have to have
 

6703
02:04:56,800 --> 02:04:58,390
hypothetical state things have to have
to actually work

6704
02:04:58,390 --> 02:04:58,400
to actually work
 

6705
02:04:58,400 --> 02:05:00,550
to actually work
but with the agency and communion i

6706
02:05:00,550 --> 02:05:00,560
but with the agency and communion i
 

6707
02:05:00,560 --> 02:05:02,470
but with the agency and communion i
think it's good to have a balance and

6708
02:05:02,470 --> 02:05:02,480
think it's good to have a balance and
 

6709
02:05:02,480 --> 02:05:04,629
think it's good to have a balance and
that's why i think some of the best

6710
02:05:04,629 --> 02:05:04,639
that's why i think some of the best
 

6711
02:05:04,639 --> 02:05:07,270
that's why i think some of the best
romantic relationships are those where

6712

femininity
uh within the same mix but also with the

6728
02:05:24,550 --> 02:05:24,560
uh within the same mix but also with the
 

6729
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:28,229
uh within the same mix but also with the
footnote of not the unmitigated agency

6730
02:05:28,229 --> 02:05:28,239
footnote of not the unmitigated agency
 

6731
02:05:28,239 --> 02:05:30,390
footnote of not the unmitigated agency
or unmitigated communion both of which

6732
02:05:30,390 --> 02:05:30,400
or unmitigated communion both of which
 

6733
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:31,430
or unmitigated communion both of which
can be

can be
 

6735
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:34,229
can be
negative and so i view these as um

6736
02:05:34,229 --> 02:05:34,239
negative and so i view these as um
 

6737
02:05:34,239 --> 02:05:36,069
negative and so i view these as um

02:07:06,480 --> 02:07:08,149
uh versus what is
just a

6824
02:07:08,149 --> 02:07:08,159
just a
 

6825
02:07:08,159 --> 02:07:11,589
just a
beautiful term of human nature right

6826
02:07:11,589 --> 02:07:11,599
beautiful term of human nature right
 

6827
02:07:11,599 --> 02:07:12,470
beautiful term of human nature right
yes

6828
02:07:12,470 --> 02:07:12,480
yes
 

6829
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:14,950
yes
yeah and it's it's complicated it's uh

6830
02:07:14,950 --> 02:07:14,960
yeah and it's it's complicated it's uh
 

6831
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:17,589
yeah and it's it's complicated it's uh
yeah yeah it's complicated and it's it's

6832
02:07:17,589 --> 02:07:17,599
yeah yeah it's complicated and it's it's
 

6833
02:07:17,599 --> 02:07:19,350
yeah yeah it's complicated and it's it's
dynamic and

6834
02:07:19,350 --> 02:07:19,360
dynamic and
 

6835
02:07:19,360 --> 02:07:21,270
dynamic and
i would just add i thought you phrased

6836
02:07:21,270 --> 02:07:21,280
i would just add i thought you phrased
 

6837
02:07:21,280 --> 02:07:23,270
i would just add i thought you phrased
that brilliantly um

6838
02:07:23,270 --> 02:07:23,280
that brilliantly um
 

6839
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:25,270
that brilliantly um
but i would just add to that it also

6840
02:07:25,270 --> 02:07:25,280
but i would just add to that it also
 

6841
02:07:25,280 --> 02:07:27,350
but i would just add to that it also
depends on sort of what you're trying to

6842
02:07:27,350 --> 02:07:27,360
depends on sort of what you're trying to
 

6843
02:07:27,360 --> 02:07:28,550
depends on sort of what you're trying to
do and so i think some of the

6844
02:07:28,550 --> 02:07:28,560
do and so i think some of the
 

6845
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:29,910
do and so i think some of the
oscillation

6846
02:07:29,910 --> 02:07:29,920
oscillation
 

6847
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:31,430
oscillation
can be what

6848
02:07:31,430 --> 02:07:31,440
can be what
 

6849
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:34,390
can be what
task what problem you're trying to solve

6850
02:07:34,390 --> 02:07:34,400
task what problem you're trying to solve
 

6851
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:37,910
task what problem you're trying to solve
and so if you're i don't know trying to

6852
02:07:37,910 --> 02:07:37,920
and so if you're i don't know trying to
 

6853
02:07:37,920 --> 02:07:40,470
and so if you're i don't know trying to
you know build a bridge or something you

6854
02:07:40,470 --> 02:07:40,480
you know build a bridge or something you
 

6855
02:07:40,480 --> 02:07:43,910
you know build a bridge or something you
need to be very thin oriented and

6856
02:07:43,910 --> 02:07:43,920
need to be very thin oriented and
 

6857
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:44,790
need to be very thin oriented and
uh

6858
02:07:44,790 --> 02:07:44,800

about that she raised this issue and so
 

6951
02:09:22,079 --> 02:09:24,229
about that she raised this issue and so
we started to brainstorm

originally it was why humans have sex

6954
02:09:26,229 --> 02:09:26,239
originally it was why humans have sex
 

6955
02:09:26,239 --> 02:09:28,149
originally it was why humans have sex
that's the the scientific article we

6956
02:09:28,149 --> 02:09:28,159
that's the the scientific article we
 

6957
02:09:28,159 --> 02:09:29,750
that's the the scientific article we
published was why humans because we're

6958
02:09:29,750 --> 02:09:29,760
published was why humans because we're
 

6959
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:32,390
published was why humans because we're
interested in males and females and so i

6960
02:09:32,390 --> 02:09:32,400
interested in males and females and so i
 

6961
02:09:32,400 --> 02:09:35,030
interested in males and females and so i
said um i would come well uh they have

6962
02:09:35,030 --> 02:09:35,040
said um i would come well uh they have
 

6963
02:09:35,040 --> 02:09:37,990
said um i would come well uh they have
sex because of x and then

6964
02:09:37,990 --> 02:09:38,000
sex because of x and then
 

6965
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,229
sex because of x and then
cindy maestrom would come up she'd say

6966

cindy maestrom would come up she'd say
 

6967
02:09:40,239 --> 02:09:42,550
cindy maestrom would come up she'd say
oh here are seven other reasons and that

6968
02:09:42,550 --> 02:09:42,560
oh here are seven other reasons and that
 

6969
02:09:42,560 --> 02:09:43,990
oh here are seven other reasons and that
i'd come up with one more she came up

6970
02:09:43,990 --> 02:09:44,000
i'd come up with one more she came up
 

6971
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,390
i'd come up with one more she came up
with another seventh so it was like you

6972
02:09:46,390 --> 02:09:46,400
with another seventh so it was like you
 

6973
02:09:46,400 --> 02:09:48,870
with another seventh so it was like you
know so so she's in in some sense

6974
02:09:48,870 --> 02:09:48,880
know so so she's in in some sense
 

6975
02:09:48,880 --> 02:09:50,550
know so so she's in in some sense
importantly the um

6976
02:09:50,550 --> 02:09:50,560
importantly the um
 

6977
02:09:50,560 --> 02:09:53,189
importantly the um
you know originator or fountain of this

6978
02:09:53,189 --> 02:09:53,199
you know originator or fountain of this
 

6979
02:09:53,199 --> 02:09:54,709
you know originator or fountain of this
of this idea but

6980
02:09:54,709 --> 02:09:54,719
of this idea but
 

6981
02:09:54,719 --> 02:09:57,109

7144
02:12:54,149 --> 02:12:54,159
but all the different kinks that humans
 

7145
02:12:54,159 --> 02:12:56,069
but all the different kinks that humans
establish all the different fantasies

7146
02:12:56,069 --> 02:12:56,079
establish all the different fantasies
 

7147
02:12:56,079 --> 02:12:57,669
establish all the different fantasies
and all those kind of yeah yeah well

7148
02:12:57,669 --> 02:12:57,679
and all those kind of yeah yeah well
 

7149
02:12:57,679 --> 02:13:01,189
and all those kind of yeah yeah well
that's a complicated question um

7150
02:13:01,189 --> 02:13:01,199
that's a complicated question um
 

7151
02:13:01,199 --> 02:13:03,830
that's a complicated question um
for for which i don't think we have uh

7152
02:13:03,830 --> 02:13:03,840
for for which i don't think we have uh
 

7153
02:13:03,840 --> 02:13:05,669
for for which i don't think we have uh
sufficient time to get into that you

7154
02:13:05,669 --> 02:13:05,679
sufficient time to get into that you
 

7155
02:13:05,679 --> 02:13:08,310
sufficient time to get into that you
know in detail and and it is complicated

7156
02:13:08,310 --> 02:13:08,320
know in detail and and it is complicated
 

7157
02:13:08,320 --> 02:13:10,390
know in detail and and it is complicated
because there are some

7158
02:13:10,390 --> 02:13:10,400
because there are some
 

7159
02:13:10,400 --> 02:13:12,629
because there are some
sexual fantasies that uh sexual

7160
02:13:12,629 --> 02:13:12,639
sexual fantasies that uh sexual
 

7161
02:13:12,639 --> 02:13:14,149
sexual fantasies that uh sexual
fantasies by the way i think a really

7162
02:13:14,149 --> 02:13:14,159
fantasies by the way i think a really
 

7163
02:13:14,159 --> 02:13:16,470
fantasies by the way i think a really
fascinating window into our sexual

7164
02:13:16,470 --> 02:13:16,480
fascinating window into our sexual
 

7165
02:13:16,480 --> 02:13:18,870
fascinating window into our sexual
psychology because in a way they're

7166
02:13:18,870 --> 02:13:18,880
psychology because in a way they're
 

7167
02:13:18,880 --> 02:13:21,750
psychology because in a way they're
they're unconstrained by

7168
02:13:21,750 --> 02:13:21,760
they're unconstrained by
 

7169
02:13:21,760 --> 02:13:24,229
they're unconstrained by
you know things like rules and norms in

7170
02:13:24,229 --> 02:13:24,239
you know things like rules and norms in
 

7171
02:13:24,239 --> 02:13:25,669
you know things like rules and norms in
society and

7172
02:13:25,669 --> 02:13:25,679
society and
 

7173
02:13:25,679 --> 02:13:27,589
society and
cultural presses that you're kind of

7174
02:13:27,589 --> 02:13:27,599
cultural presses that you're kind of
 

7175
02:13:27,599 --> 02:13:29,270
cultural presses that you're kind of
free to

02:13:29,270 --> 02:13:29,280
free to
 

7177
02:13:29,280 --> 02:13:30,870
free to
fantasize about whatever you want to

7178

7181
02:13:32,560 --> 02:13:34,390
fantasize about so i think it's it
provides an interesting window into

7182
02:13:34,390 --> 02:13:34,400
provides an interesting window into
 

7183
02:13:34,400 --> 02:13:36,149
provides an interesting window into
human sexuality

7184
02:13:36,149 --> 02:13:36,159
human sexuality
 

7185
02:13:36,159 --> 02:13:39,109
human sexuality
uh and there are some predictable ones

7186
02:13:39,109 --> 02:13:39,119
uh and there are some predictable ones
 

7187
02:13:39,119 --> 02:13:41,830
uh and there are some predictable ones
and then there are some also

7188
02:13:41,830 --> 02:13:41,840
and then there are some also
 

7189
02:13:41,840 --> 02:13:44,870
and then there are some also
individual or idiosyncratic ones and

7190
02:13:44,870 --> 02:13:44,880
individual or idiosyncratic ones and
 

7191
02:13:44,880 --> 02:13:46,470
individual or idiosyncratic ones and
and um

7192
02:13:46,470 --> 02:13:46,480
and um
 

7193
02:13:46,480 --> 02:13:47,589
and um
the

7194
02:13:47,589 --> 02:13:47,599
the
 

7195
02:13:47,599 --> 02:13:50,069
the
again the there's a fundamental sex

7196
02:13:50,069 --> 02:13:50,079
again the there's a fundamental sex
 

7197
02:13:50,079 --> 02:13:52,709
again the there's a fundamental sex
difference in in this in that

7198
02:13:52,709 --> 02:13:52,719
difference in in this in that
 

7199
02:13:52,719 --> 02:13:55,750
difference in in this in that
uh when you talk about like fetishes or

7200
02:13:55,750 --> 02:13:55,760
uh when you talk about like fetishes or
 

7201
02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:58,390
uh when you talk about like fetishes or
like shoe fetishes leather fetishes

7202
02:13:58,390 --> 02:13:58,400
like shoe fetishes leather fetishes
 

7203
02:13:58,400 --> 02:14:02,390
like shoe fetishes leather fetishes
different types of um things males are

7204
02:14:02,390 --> 02:14:02,400
different types of um things males are
 

7205
02:14:02,400 --> 02:14:05,990
different types of um things males are
much more prone to those than females

7206
02:14:05,990 --> 02:14:06,000
much more prone to those than females
 

7207
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:09,030
much more prone to those than females
you've had as you said

7208
02:14:09,030 --> 02:14:09,040

 

7209
02:14:09,040 --> 02:14:10,709

almost all fetishes

7210
02:14:10,709 --> 02:14:10,719
almost all fetishes
 

7211
02:14:10,719 --> 02:14:13,589
almost all fetishes
males are overrepresented and i think

7212
02:14:13,589 --> 02:14:13,599
males are overrepresented and i think
 

7213
02:14:13,599 --> 02:14:16,229
males are overrepresented and i think
it's partly because

7214
02:14:16,229 --> 02:14:16,239
it's partly because
 

7215
02:14:16,239 --> 02:14:17,589
it's partly because
there's some evidence that they're

7216
02:14:17,589 --> 02:14:17,599
there's some evidence that they're
 

7217
02:14:17,599 --> 02:14:20,870
there's some evidence that they're
classically conditioned so i think that

7218
02:14:20,870 --> 02:14:20,880
classically conditioned so i think that
 

7219
02:14:20,880 --> 02:14:23,669
classically conditioned so i think that
first or early sexual experiences that

7220
02:14:23,669 --> 02:14:23,679
first or early sexual experiences that
 

7221
02:14:23,679 --> 02:14:25,990
first or early sexual experiences that
people have kind of condition them to

7222
02:14:25,990 --> 02:14:26,000
people have kind of condition them to
 

7223
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,229
people have kind of condition them to
the cues that are present during those

7224
02:14:28,229 --> 02:14:28,239
the cues that are present during those
 

7225
02:14:28,239 --> 02:14:29,270
the cues that are present during those
early

7226
02:14:29,270 --> 02:14:29,280
early
 

7227
02:14:29,280 --> 02:14:30,870
early
ones and so if your first sexual

7228
02:14:30,870 --> 02:14:30,880
ones and so if your first sexual
 

7229
02:14:30,880 --> 02:14:32,870
ones and so if your first sexual
experience happened to be

7230
02:14:32,870 --> 02:14:32,880
experience happened to be
 

7231
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:36,229
experience happened to be
you know um involve visual images of

7232
02:14:36,229 --> 02:14:36,239
you know um involve visual images of
 

7233
02:14:36,239 --> 02:14:37,669
you know um involve visual images of
shoes or you're having to look in your

7234
02:14:37,669 --> 02:14:37,679
shoes or you're having to look in your
 

7235
02:14:37,679 --> 02:14:39,750
shoes or you're having to look in your
shoes when you first had sex

7236
02:14:39,750 --> 02:14:39,760
shoes when you first had sex
 

7237
02:14:39,760 --> 02:14:42,390
shoes when you first had sex
it's just an example or leather or

7238
02:14:42,390 --> 02:14:42,400
it's just an example or leather or
 

7239
02:14:42,400 --> 02:14:44,950
it's just an example or leather or
zippers or whatever the case is

7240
02:14:44,950 --> 02:14:44,960
zippers or whatever the case is
 

7241
02:14:44,960 --> 02:14:47,589
zippers or whatever the case is
that people develop these very

7242
02:14:47,589 --> 02:14:47,599
that people develop these very
 

7243
02:14:47,599 --> 02:14:50,069
that people develop these very
individualistic um

7244
02:14:50,069 --> 02:14:50,079
individualistic um
 

7245
02:14:50,079 --> 02:14:52,550
individualistic um
sexual turn-ons based on these early

7246
02:14:52,550 --> 02:14:52,560
sexual turn-ons based on these early
 

7247
02:14:52,560 --> 02:14:54,550
sexual turn-ons based on these early
sexual experiences

7248
02:14:54,550 --> 02:14:54,560
sexual experiences
 

7249
02:14:54,560 --> 02:14:56,790
sexual experiences
uh so it could also be you said have sex

7250
02:14:56,790 --> 02:14:56,800
uh so it could also be you said have sex
 

7251
02:14:56,800 --> 02:14:59,510
uh so it could also be you said have sex
but it could also be sexual feelings

7252
02:14:59,510 --> 02:14:59,520
but it could also be sexual feelings
 

7253
02:14:59,520 --> 02:15:01,669
but it could also be sexual feelings
early sexual feelings like because it

7254
02:15:01,669 --> 02:15:01,679
early sexual feelings like because it
 

7255
02:15:01,679 --> 02:15:02,550
early sexual feelings like because it
yeah

7256
02:15:02,550 --> 02:15:02,560
yeah
 

7257
02:15:02,560 --> 02:15:03,669
yeah
um

7258
02:15:03,669 --> 02:15:03,679
um
 

7259
02:15:03,679 --> 02:15:07,109
um
so i wonder what that is about men

7260
02:15:07,109 --> 02:15:07,119
so i wonder what that is about men
 

7261
02:15:07,119 --> 02:15:08,790
so i wonder what that is about men
that they have a more when they first

7262
02:15:08,790 --> 02:15:08,800
that they have a more when they first
 

7263
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:11,830
that they have a more when they first
start experiencing sexual feelings that

7264
02:15:11,830 --> 02:15:11,840
start experiencing sexual feelings that
 

7265
02:15:11,840 --> 02:15:13,430
start experiencing sexual feelings that
they're more sensitive to the cues and

7266
02:15:13,430 --> 02:15:13,440
they're more sensitive to the cues and
 

7267
02:15:13,440 --> 02:15:15,270
they're more sensitive to the cues and
those cues somehow have a deep

7268
02:15:15,270 --> 02:15:15,280
those cues somehow have a deep
 

7269
02:15:15,280 --> 02:15:16,709
those cues somehow have a deep
psychological effect on their

7270
02:15:16,709 --> 02:15:16,719
psychological effect on their
 

7271
02:15:16,719 --> 02:15:18,629
psychological effect on their
development of their sexuality so if

7272
02:15:18,629 --> 02:15:18,639
development of their sexuality so if
 

7273
02:15:18,639 --> 02:15:20,229
development of their sexuality so if
they have kinks that means they're

7274
02:15:20,229 --> 02:15:20,239
they have kinks that means they're
 

7275
02:15:20,239 --> 02:15:21,430
they have kinks that means they're
somehow

7276
02:15:21,430 --> 02:15:21,440
somehow
 

7277
02:15:21,440 --> 02:15:23,109
somehow
more q sensitive

7278
02:15:23,109 --> 02:15:23,119
more q sensitive
 

7279
02:15:23,119 --> 02:15:24,310
more q sensitive
and maybe

7280
02:15:24,310 --> 02:15:24,320
and maybe
 

7281
02:15:24,320 --> 02:15:26,550
and maybe
does it matter if society like slaps

7282
02:15:26,550 --> 02:15:26,560
does it matter if society like slaps
 

7283
02:15:26,560 --> 02:15:29,430
does it matter if society like slaps
them on the wrist for it does that help

7284
02:15:29,430 --> 02:15:29,440
them on the wrist for it does that help
 

7285
02:15:29,440 --> 02:15:30,950
them on the wrist for it does that help
solidify

7286
02:15:30,950 --> 02:15:30,960
solidify
 

7287
02:15:30,960 --> 02:15:33,270
solidify
the kinks yeah i don't know about the

7288
02:15:33,270 --> 02:15:33,280
the kinks yeah i don't know about the
 

7289
02:15:33,280 --> 02:15:35,589
the kinks yeah i don't know about the
society's slack on the wrist but i think

7290
02:15:35,589 --> 02:15:35,599
society's slack on the wrist but i think
 

7291
02:15:35,599 --> 02:15:37,990
society's slack on the wrist but i think
what it is is this i think this is the

7292
02:15:37,990 --> 02:15:38,000
what it is is this i think this is the
 

7293
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:41,109
what it is is this i think this is the
evolutionary uh hypothesis anyway about

7294
02:15:41,109 --> 02:15:41,119
evolutionary uh hypothesis anyway about
 

7295
02:15:41,119 --> 02:15:43,270
evolutionary uh hypothesis anyway about
why there's this sex difference and that

7296
02:15:43,270 --> 02:15:43,280
why there's this sex difference and that
 

7297
02:15:43,280 --> 02:15:45,350
why there's this sex difference and that
is that men are

7298
02:15:45,350 --> 02:15:45,360
is that men are
 

7299
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:47,350
is that men are
conditioned to anything that's going to

7300
02:15:47,350 --> 02:15:47,360
conditioned to anything that's going to
 

7301
02:15:47,360 --> 02:15:50,709
conditioned to anything that's going to
lead to sex because uh

7302
02:15:50,709 --> 02:15:50,719
lead to sex because uh
 

7303
02:15:50,719 --> 02:15:55,189
lead to sex because uh
whereas women don't have to be uh

7304
02:15:55,189 --> 02:15:55,199
whereas women don't have to be uh
 

7305
02:15:55,199 --> 02:15:57,990
whereas women don't have to be uh
from male perspective because of women's

7306

from male perspective because of women's
 

7307
02:15:58,000 --> 02:15:59,750
from male perspective because of women's
greater investment because the

7308
02:15:59,750 --> 02:15:59,760
greater investment because the
 

7309
02:15:59,760 --> 02:16:01,669
greater investment because the
nine-month pregnancy

7310
02:16:01,669 --> 02:16:01,679
nine-month pregnancy
 

7311
02:16:01,679 --> 02:16:03,669
nine-month pregnancy
etc

7312
02:16:03,669 --> 02:16:03,679
etc
 

7313
02:16:03,679 --> 02:16:05,669
etc
in order to reproduce women have to

7314
02:16:05,669 --> 02:16:05,679
in order to reproduce women have to
 

7315
02:16:05,679 --> 02:16:08,149
in order to reproduce women have to
invest this tremendous amount

7316
02:16:08,149 --> 02:16:08,159
invest this tremendous amount
 

7317
02:16:08,159 --> 02:16:10,950
invest this tremendous amount
uh men don't one act of sex can produce

7318
02:16:10,950 --> 02:16:10,960
uh men don't one act of sex can produce
 

7319
02:16:10,960 --> 02:16:13,030
uh men don't one act of sex can produce
an offspring and so

7320
02:16:13,030 --> 02:16:13,040
an offspring and so
 

7321
02:16:13,040 --> 02:16:15,910
an offspring and so
uh for men but not for women and so this

7322
02:16:15,910 --> 02:16:15,920
uh for men but not for women and so this
 

7323
02:16:15,920 --> 02:16:19,350
uh for men but not for women and so this
huge asymmetry and investment means that

7324
02:16:19,350 --> 02:16:19,360
huge asymmetry and investment means that
 

7325
02:16:19,360 --> 02:16:20,629
huge asymmetry and investment means that
the

in that context
 

7335
02:16:28,239 --> 02:16:30,470
in that context
women become the valuable and scarce

7336
02:16:30,470 --> 02:16:30,480
women become the valuable and scarce

is going to be selected for and so
 

7343
02:16:38,399 --> 02:16:41,270

mating
 

7473
02:18:49,840 --> 02:18:51,950
mating
the more there's sex differences

7474
02:18:51,950 --> 02:18:51,960
the more there's sex differences
 

7475
02:18:51,960 --> 02:18:54,389
the more there's sex differences
represent themselves they serve yes yeah

7476
02:18:54,389 --> 02:18:54,399
represent themselves they serve yes yeah
 

7477
02:18:54,399 --> 02:18:56,549
represent themselves they serve yes yeah
that's right and in many psychological

7478
02:18:56,549 --> 02:18:56,559
that's right and in many psychological
 

7479
02:18:56,559 --> 02:18:58,950
that's right and in many psychological
domains there are no sex differences or

7480
02:18:58,950 --> 02:18:58,960
domains there are no sex differences or
 

7481
02:18:58,960 --> 02:19:00,870
domains there are no sex differences or
the sexes are very similar

7482
02:19:00,870 --> 02:19:00,880
the sexes are very similar
 

7483
02:19:00,880 --> 02:19:03,429
the sexes are very similar
but pornography is consumed about 80

7484
02:19:03,429 --> 02:19:03,439
but pornography is consumed about 80
 

7485
02:19:03,439 --> 02:19:05,910
but pornography is consumed about 80
percent of the consumers are men

7486
02:19:05,910 --> 02:19:05,920
percent of the consumers are men
 

7487
02:19:05,920 --> 02:19:10,870
percent of the consumers are men
so it is very heavily a male consumer

7488
02:19:10,870 --> 02:19:10,880
so it is very heavily a male consumer
 

7489
02:19:10,880 --> 02:19:12,389
so it is very heavily a male consumer
industry

7490
02:19:12,389 --> 02:19:12,399
industry
 

7491
02:19:12,399 --> 02:19:15,030
industry
if you will and

7492
02:19:15,030 --> 02:19:15,040
if you will and
 

7493
02:19:15,040 --> 02:19:17,990
if you will and
i think that

7494
02:19:17,990 --> 02:19:18,000

 

7495
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:19,990

it can have positive and negative

7496
02:19:19,990 --> 02:19:20,000
it can have positive and negative
 

7497
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:21,830
it can have positive and negative
effects depending on the circumstances

7498
02:19:21,830 --> 02:19:21,840
effects depending on the circumstances
 

7499
02:19:21,840 --> 02:19:22,790
effects depending on the circumstances
so

7500
02:19:22,790 --> 02:19:22,800
so
 

7501
02:19:22,800 --> 02:19:25,030
so
one um

7502
02:19:25,030 --> 02:19:25,040
one um
 

7503
02:19:25,040 --> 02:19:28,070
one um
potential negative effect is that

7504
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:28,080
potential negative effect is that
 

7505
02:19:28,080 --> 02:19:29,429
potential negative effect is that
men

7506
02:19:29,429 --> 02:19:29,439
men
 

7507
02:19:29,439 --> 02:19:32,309
men
might develop unrealistic expectations

7508
02:19:32,309 --> 02:19:32,319
might develop unrealistic expectations
 

7509
02:19:32,319 --> 02:19:35,110
might develop unrealistic expectations
about what sex will be like or should be

7510
02:19:35,110 --> 02:19:35,120

breasts
 

7537
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:03,910
breasts
in fact they were actually just

come to expect something that was that
 

7555
02:20:20,479 --> 02:20:23,190
come to expect something that was that
was unrealistic in this case

7556
02:20:23,190 --> 02:20:23,200
was unrealistic in this case
 

7557
02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:24,389
was unrealistic in this case
um

7558
02:20:24,389 --> 02:20:24,399
um
 

7559
02:20:24,399 --> 02:20:26,230
um
not leading that's not not the way to

7560
02:20:26,230 --> 02:20:26,240
not leading that's not not the way to
 

7561
02:20:26,240 --> 02:20:28,389
not leading that's not not the way to

so i think that people can develop
 

7569
02:20:34,560 --> 02:20:36,230
so i think that people can develop
in this case men unrealistic

7570
02:20:36,230 --> 02:20:36,240
in this case men unrealistic
 

7571
02:20:36,240 --> 02:20:38,309
in this case men unrealistic
expectations also about the kind of

7572
02:20:38,309 --> 02:20:38,319
expectations also about the kind of
 

7573
02:20:38,319 --> 02:20:41,510
expectations also about the kind of
sexual acrobatics that porn stars engage

7574
02:20:41,510 --> 02:20:41,520
sexual acrobatics that porn stars engage
 

7575
02:20:41,520 --> 02:20:43,990
sexual acrobatics that porn stars engage
in and when they get in real life

7576
02:20:43,990 --> 02:20:44,000
in and when they get in real life
 

7577
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:47,510
in and when they get in real life
situations can put pressure on women to

7578
02:20:47,510 --> 02:20:47,520
situations can put pressure on women to
 

7579
02:20:47,520 --> 02:20:49,270
situations can put pressure on women to
become

7580
02:20:49,270 --> 02:20:49,280
become
 

7581
02:20:49,280 --> 02:20:51,670
become
you know uh to fulfill those those kinds

7582
02:20:51,670 --> 02:20:51,680
you know uh to fulfill those those kinds
 

7583
02:20:51,680 --> 02:20:53,110
you know uh to fulfill those those kinds
of images

7584
02:20:53,110 --> 02:20:53,120
of images
 

7585
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:55,990
of images
um but the other thing the other kind of

7586
02:20:55,990 --> 02:20:56,000
um but the other thing the other kind of
 

7587
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,230
um but the other thing the other kind of
detrimental effect that it has is and

7588
02:20:58,230 --> 02:20:58,240
detrimental effect that it has is and
 

7589
02:20:58,240 --> 02:21:00,469
detrimental effect that it has is and
this is something that is emerging

7590
02:21:00,469 --> 02:21:00,479
this is something that is emerging
 

7591
02:21:00,479 --> 02:21:01,830
this is something that is emerging
culturally

7592
02:21:01,830 --> 02:21:01,840
culturally
 

7593
02:21:01,840 --> 02:21:04,550
culturally
is i think it has a dampening effect on

7594
02:21:04,550 --> 02:21:04,560
is i think it has a dampening effect on
 

7595
02:21:04,560 --> 02:21:07,110
is i think it has a dampening effect on
men's pursuit of

7596
02:21:07,110 --> 02:21:07,120
men's pursuit of
 

7597
02:21:07,120 --> 02:21:09,190
men's pursuit of
real-life relationships

7598
02:21:09,190 --> 02:21:09,200
real-life relationships
 

7599
02:21:09,200 --> 02:21:11,270
real-life relationships
because in some sense it kind of

7600
02:21:11,270 --> 02:21:11,280
because in some sense it kind of
 

7601
02:21:11,280 --> 02:21:14,070
because in some sense it kind of
bleeds off some of that sex drive or

7602
02:21:14,070 --> 02:21:14,080
bleeds off some of that sex drive or
 

7603
02:21:14,080 --> 02:21:17,429
bleeds off some of that sex drive or
sexual desire sexual energy

7604
02:21:17,429 --> 02:21:17,439
sexual desire sexual energy
 

7605
02:21:17,439 --> 02:21:19,270
sexual desire sexual energy
um and so they're

7606
02:21:19,270 --> 02:21:19,280
um and so they're
 

7607
02:21:19,280 --> 02:21:20,950
um and so they're
and some men get addicted to it so

7608
02:21:20,950 --> 02:21:20,960
and some men get addicted to it so
 

7609
02:21:20,960 --> 02:21:22,389
and some men get addicted to it so
they're spending hours and hours and

7610
02:21:22,389 --> 02:21:22,399
they're spending hours and hours and
 

7611
02:21:22,399 --> 02:21:25,030
they're spending hours and hours and
hours a day consuming pornography

7612
02:21:25,030 --> 02:21:25,040
hours a day consuming pornography
 

7613
02:21:25,040 --> 02:21:27,990
hours a day consuming pornography
uh and so i think can have a detrimental

7614
02:21:27,990 --> 02:21:28,000
uh and so i think can have a detrimental
 

7615
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:28,950
uh and so i think can have a detrimental
effect

7616
02:21:28,950 --> 02:21:28,960
effect
 

7617
02:21:28,960 --> 02:21:32,070
effect
on even on men's ambition yeah that

7618
02:21:32,070 --> 02:21:32,080
on even on men's ambition yeah that
 

7619
02:21:32,080 --> 02:21:33,429
on even on men's ambition yeah that
there's something really powerful about

7620
02:21:33,429 --> 02:21:33,439
there's something really powerful about
 

7621
02:21:33,439 --> 02:21:35,030
there's something really powerful about
that sexual energy

7622
02:21:35,030 --> 02:21:35,040
that sexual energy
 

7623
02:21:35,040 --> 02:21:36,630
that sexual energy
not to be all like

7624
02:21:36,630 --> 02:21:36,640
not to be all like
 

7625
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:38,950
not to be all like
spiritual about it but

7626
02:21:38,950 --> 02:21:38,960
spiritual about it but
 

7627
02:21:38,960 --> 02:21:40,790
spiritual about it but
it seems like that's somehow correlated

7628
02:21:40,790 --> 02:21:40,800
it seems like that's somehow correlated
 

7629
02:21:40,800 --> 02:21:42,230
it seems like that's somehow correlated
with ambition

7630
02:21:42,230 --> 02:21:42,240
with ambition
 

7631
02:21:42,240 --> 02:21:44,469
with ambition
so like uh one of the things that

7632
02:21:44,469 --> 02:21:44,479
so like uh one of the things that
 

7633
02:21:44,479 --> 02:21:46,710
so like uh one of the things that
pornography can take away is like

7634
02:21:46,710 --> 02:21:46,720

that could be a catalyst for
 

8073
02:29:39,359 --> 02:29:41,510
that could be a catalyst for
constructing such models and once you've

8074
02:29:41,510 --> 02:29:41,520
constructing such models and once you've
 

8075
02:29:41,520 --> 02:29:44,070
constructing such models and once you've
done that

8076

8091
02:29:59,760 --> 02:30:03,590
there's this is one way in which
evolution has built into us um

8092

evolution has built into us um
 

8093
02:30:03,600 --> 02:30:05,030

02:30:10,790 --> 02:30:10,800
overall happiness uh and and that is
 

8099
02:30:10,800 --> 02:30:14,469
overall happiness uh and and that is
that it's created desires that can never

8100
02:30:14,469 --> 02:30:14,479
that it's created desires that can never
 

8101

that it's created desires that can never
be fully met

02:30:43,510 --> 02:30:43,520
way i mean these serve as
 

8129
02:30:43,520 --> 02:30:45,190

evolution each of these topics are
controversial

8308
02:34:04,070 --> 02:34:04,080
controversial
 

8309
02:34:04,080 --> 02:34:05,910
controversial
by themselves and you bring them

8310
02:34:05,910 --> 02:34:05,920
by themselves and you bring them
 

8311
02:34:05,920 --> 02:34:07,670
by themselves and you bring them
together the intersection becomes

8312
02:34:07,670 --> 02:34:07,680
together the intersection becomes
 

8313
02:34:07,680 --> 02:34:09,750
together the intersection becomes
especially controversial

uh i guess
 

8319
02:34:13,600 --> 02:34:17,429
uh i guess
view myself as a scientist and so

8320
02:34:17,429 --> 02:34:17,439
view myself as a scientist and so
 

8321
02:34:17,439 --> 02:34:20,630
view myself as a scientist and so
um and so i would rather be

8322

8337
02:34:37,520 --> 02:34:39,110
nature that's what i've devoted my
scientific career

8338
02:34:39,110 --> 02:34:39,120
scientific career
 

8339
02:34:39,120 --> 02:34:40,790
scientific career
toward and i'm

8340
02:34:40,790 --> 02:34:40,800
toward and i'm
 

8341
02:34:40,800 --> 02:34:42,309
toward and i'm
and that's why i do the studies in

8342
02:34:42,309 --> 02:34:42,319
and that's why i do the studies in
 

8343
02:34:42,319 --> 02:34:44,870
and that's why i do the studies in
responsive to empirical data and

8344
02:34:44,870 --> 02:34:44,880
responsive to empirical data and
 

8345
02:34:44,880 --> 02:34:46,870
responsive to empirical data and
and the best theories that we have

8346
02:34:46,870 --> 02:34:46,880
and the best theories that we have
 

8347
02:34:46,880 --> 02:34:51,110
and the best theories that we have
available the best conceptual tools

8348
02:34:51,110 --> 02:34:51,120
available the best conceptual tools
 

8349
02:34:51,120 --> 02:34:52,070
available the best conceptual tools
so

8350
02:34:52,070 --> 02:34:52,080
so
 

8351

the results of your studies
 

8375
02:35:14,800 --> 02:35:16,950
the results of your studies
um and i said why not and she said that

8376

um and i said why not and she said that
it would

8378

it would
 

8379
02:35:18,080 --> 02:35:20,710
it would
that people women have it hard enough as

that people women have it hard enough as
it is without

clones
 

8401
02:35:41,920 --> 02:35:43,590
clones
uh especially when it comes to the

8402
02:35:43,590 --> 02:35:43,600
uh especially when it comes to the
 

8403
02:35:43,600 --> 02:35:45,750
uh especially when it comes to the
mating domain and sexuality domain the

8404

the more males have a monopoly on us
 

8421
02:36:02,240 --> 02:36:04,150
the more males have a monopoly on us
when you get to homicide

02:36:39,520 --> 02:36:40,870
just is it is it psychologically
difficult you know to do this work

8454
02:36:40,870 --> 02:36:40,880
difficult you know to do this work
 

8455
02:36:40,880 --> 02:36:43,110
difficult you know to do this work
because uh what is research is thinking

8456
02:36:43,110 --> 02:36:43,120
because uh what is research is thinking
 

8457
02:36:43,120 --> 02:36:45,510
because uh what is research is thinking
deeply through things and uh

8458
02:36:45,510 --> 02:36:45,520
deeply through things and uh
 

8459
02:36:45,520 --> 02:36:46,389

like
 

8463
02:36:47,359 --> 02:36:49,510
like

and i don't talk about that in the book

8502
02:37:30,070 --> 02:37:30,080
and i don't talk about that in the book
 

8503
02:37:30,080 --> 02:37:31,030

and uh and it's been largely well
 

8509
02:37:35,359 --> 02:37:37,590
and uh and it's been largely well
received you know and i think partly

8510
02:37:37,590 --> 02:37:37,600
received you know and i think partly
 

8511
02:37:37,600 --> 02:37:39,750
received you know and i think partly
it's because i

8512

it's because i
 

8513
02:37:39,760 --> 02:37:43,349

am careful in my publications not to

am careful in my publications not to
 

8515
02:37:43,359 --> 02:37:44,790
am careful in my publications not to
endorse it so one of the common

8516
02:37:44,790 --> 02:37:44,800
endorse it so one of the common
 

8517
02:37:44,800 --> 02:37:46,550
endorse it so one of the common
conflations that people make is they

8518
02:37:46,550 --> 02:37:46,560
conflations that people make is they
 

8519
02:37:46,560 --> 02:37:47,670
conflations that people make is they
think that

think that
 

8521
02:37:47,680 --> 02:37:50,389
think that
uh it's something that you think is good

8522
02:37:50,389 --> 02:37:50,399
uh it's something that you think is good
 

8523
02:37:50,399 --> 02:37:53,030
uh it's something that you think is good
you know that you know um if you find a

8524
02:37:53,030 --> 02:37:53,040
you know that you know um if you find a
 

8525
02:37:53,040 --> 02:37:54,630
you know that you know um if you find a
sex difference that there should be a

8526
02:37:54,630 --> 02:37:54,640
sex difference that there should be a
 

8527
02:37:54,640 --> 02:37:57,990
sex difference that there should be a
sex currencies the is odd confusion um

8528
02:37:57,990 --> 02:37:58,000
sex currencies the is odd confusion um
 

8529
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:01,190
sex currencies the is odd confusion um
and so i try to make it very clear

8530
02:38:01,190 --> 02:38:01,200
and so i try to make it very clear
 

8531
02:38:01,200 --> 02:38:02,150
and so i try to make it very clear
uh

8532
02:38:02,150 --> 02:38:02,160
uh
 

8533
02:38:02,160 --> 02:38:04,230
uh
that i'm studying what is not what ought

8534
02:38:04,230 --> 02:38:04,240
that i'm studying what is not what ought
 

8535
02:38:04,240 --> 02:38:06,950
that i'm studying what is not what ought
to be and a lot of things that i

8536
02:38:06,950 --> 02:38:06,960
to be and a lot of things that i
 

8537
02:38:06,960 --> 02:38:10,230
to be and a lot of things that i
discover about what is the case i would

8538
02:38:10,230 --> 02:38:10,240
discover about what is the case i would
 

8539
02:38:10,240 --> 02:38:11,190
discover about what is the case i would
prefer

8540
02:38:11,190 --> 02:38:11,200
prefer
 

8541
02:38:11,200 --> 02:38:14,389
prefer
them not to be and i think you kind of

8542
02:38:14,389 --> 02:38:14,399
them not to be and i think you kind of
 

8543
02:38:14,399 --> 02:38:16,230
them not to be and i think you kind of
alluded to this earlier by saying that

8544
02:38:16,230 --> 02:38:16,240
alluded to this earlier by saying that
 

8545
02:38:16,240 --> 02:38:17,110
alluded to this earlier by saying that
we

8546
02:38:17,110 --> 02:38:17,120
we
 

8547
02:38:17,120 --> 02:38:18,070
we
um

8548
02:38:18,070 --> 02:38:18,080
um
 

8549
02:38:18,080 --> 02:38:21,510
um
have to override some of our violent uh

8550
02:38:21,510 --> 02:38:21,520
have to override some of our violent uh
 

8551
02:38:21,520 --> 02:38:23,990
have to override some of our violent uh
inclinations or impulses or

8552
02:38:23,990 --> 02:38:24,000
inclinations or impulses or
 

8553
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:25,910
inclinations or impulses or
uh the way i would phrase it is we have

8554
02:38:25,910 --> 02:38:25,920
uh the way i would phrase it is we have
 

8555
02:38:25,920 --> 02:38:26,950
uh the way i would phrase it is we have
to

8556
02:38:26,950 --> 02:38:26,960
to
 

8557
02:38:26,960 --> 02:38:30,469
to
um control them control or keep

8558
02:38:30,469 --> 02:38:30,479
um control them control or keep
 

8559
02:38:30,479 --> 02:38:33,990
um control them control or keep
quiescent or suppress uh some of the

8560
02:38:33,990 --> 02:38:34,000
quiescent or suppress uh some of the
 

8561
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:37,670
quiescent or suppress uh some of the
nastier sides of of human nature and and

8562
02:38:37,670 --> 02:38:37,680
nastier sides of of human nature and and
 

8563
02:38:37,680 --> 02:38:39,270
nastier sides of of human nature and and
we've successfully done that in some

8564
02:38:39,270 --> 02:38:39,280
we've successfully done that in some
 

8565
02:38:39,280 --> 02:38:40,870
we've successfully done that in some
domains so

8566
02:38:40,870 --> 02:38:40,880
domains so
 

8567
02:38:40,880 --> 02:38:43,270
domains so
um you can talk about like one group

8568
02:38:43,270 --> 02:38:43,280
um you can talk about like one group
 

8569
02:38:43,280 --> 02:38:46,150
um you can talk about like one group
that fascinates me is uh the vikings and

8570
02:38:46,150 --> 02:38:46,160
that fascinates me is uh the vikings and
 

8571
02:38:46,160 --> 02:38:48,070
that fascinates me is uh the vikings and
the whole that whole um

8572
02:38:48,070 --> 02:38:48,080
the whole that whole um
 

8573
02:38:48,080 --> 02:38:50,230
the whole that whole um
uh uh era

8574
02:38:50,230 --> 02:38:50,240
uh uh era
 

8575
02:38:50,240 --> 02:38:53,349
uh uh era
and so you have you have in in sweden

8576
02:38:53,349 --> 02:38:53,359
and so you have you have in in sweden
 

8577
02:38:53,359 --> 02:38:57,190
and so you have you have in in sweden
norway for example uh these are these

8578
02:38:57,190 --> 02:38:57,200
norway for example uh these are these
 

8579
02:38:57,200 --> 02:38:57,910
norway for example uh these are these
have

8580
02:38:57,910 --> 02:38:57,920
have
 

8581
02:38:57,920 --> 02:39:01,110
have
like the lowest homicide rates on earth

8582
02:39:01,110 --> 02:39:01,120
like the lowest homicide rates on earth
 

8583
02:39:01,120 --> 02:39:03,190
like the lowest homicide rates on earth
um but you go back

8584
02:39:03,190 --> 02:39:03,200
um but you go back
 

8585
02:39:03,200 --> 02:39:06,150
um but you go back
400 years ago 600 years ago

8586
02:39:06,150 --> 02:39:06,160
400 years ago 600 years ago
 

8587
02:39:06,160 --> 02:39:07,670
400 years ago 600 years ago
people were killing each other right and

8588
02:39:07,670 --> 02:39:07,680
people were killing each other right and
 

8589
02:39:07,680 --> 02:39:10,389
people were killing each other right and
left you know and so and so

8590
02:39:10,389 --> 02:39:10,399
left you know and so and so
 

8591
02:39:10,399 --> 02:39:11,510
left you know and so and so

finding
 

8593
02:39:11,520 --> 02:39:14,230
finding
that uh so this is let leads me to be

8594
02:39:14,230 --> 02:39:14,240
that uh so this is let leads me to be
 

8595
02:39:14,240 --> 02:39:16,870
that uh so this is let leads me to be
optimistic that we can

8596
02:39:16,870 --> 02:39:16,880
optimistic that we can
 

8597
02:39:16,880 --> 02:39:17,750
optimistic that we can
um

8598
02:39:17,750 --> 02:39:17,760
um
 

8599
02:39:17,760 --> 02:39:20,469
um
change conditions to suppress

8600
02:39:20,469 --> 02:39:20,479
change conditions to suppress
 

8601
02:39:20,479 --> 02:39:23,429
change conditions to suppress
our evolved proclivities just like the

8602
02:39:23,429 --> 02:39:23,439
our evolved proclivities just like the
 

8603
02:39:23,439 --> 02:39:25,670
our evolved proclivities just like the
one one physical example that i

8604
02:39:25,670 --> 02:39:25,680
one one physical example that i
 

8605
02:39:25,680 --> 02:39:27,349
one one physical example that i
sometimes use is

8606
02:39:27,349 --> 02:39:27,359
sometimes use is
 

8607
02:39:27,359 --> 02:39:29,270
sometimes use is
callous producing mechanisms we have

8608
02:39:29,270 --> 02:39:29,280
callous producing mechanisms we have
 

8609
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:31,030
callous producing mechanisms we have
evolved callus producing mechanisms that

8610
02:39:31,030 --> 02:39:31,040
evolved callus producing mechanisms that
 

8611
02:39:31,040 --> 02:39:33,670
evolved callus producing mechanisms that
are very valuable we develop thickness

8612
02:39:33,670 --> 02:39:33,680
are very valuable we develop thickness
 

8613
02:39:33,680 --> 02:39:35,670
are very valuable we develop thickness
in the areas of our skin that have

8614
02:39:35,670 --> 02:39:35,680
in the areas of our skin that have
 

8615
02:39:35,680 --> 02:39:37,670
in the areas of our skin that have
experienced repeated friction

8616
02:39:37,670 --> 02:39:37,680
experienced repeated friction
 

8617
02:39:37,680 --> 02:39:38,469
experienced repeated friction
but

8618
02:39:38,469 --> 02:39:38,479
but
 

8619
02:39:38,479 --> 02:39:40,870
but
we can in principle design environments

8620
02:39:40,870 --> 02:39:40,880
we can in principle design environments
 

8621
02:39:40,880 --> 02:39:42,389
we can in principle design environments
where we don't experience repeated

8622
02:39:42,389 --> 02:39:42,399
where we don't experience repeated
 

8623
02:39:42,399 --> 02:39:43,830
where we don't experience repeated
friction

8624
02:39:43,830 --> 02:39:43,840
friction
 

8625
02:39:43,840 --> 02:39:46,309
friction
and so we won't grow calluses and so you

8626
02:39:46,309 --> 02:39:46,319
and so we won't grow calluses and so you
 

8627
02:39:46,319 --> 02:39:48,389
and so we won't grow calluses and so you
design an environment that

8628
02:39:48,389 --> 02:39:48,399
design an environment that
 

8629
02:39:48,399 --> 02:39:50,550
design an environment that
basically prevents the activation of our

8630
02:39:50,550 --> 02:39:50,560
basically prevents the activation of our
 

8631
02:39:50,560 --> 02:39:52,469
basically prevents the activation of our
callus-producing mechanism i think we

8632
02:39:52,469 --> 02:39:52,479
callus-producing mechanism i think we
 

8633
02:39:52,479 --> 02:39:54,070
callus-producing mechanism i think we
can do the same thing with some of these

8634
02:39:54,070 --> 02:39:54,080
can do the same thing with some of these
 

8635
02:39:54,080 --> 02:39:56,070
can do the same thing with some of these
other inclinations

8636
02:39:56,070 --> 02:39:56,080
other inclinations
 

8637
02:39:56,080 --> 02:39:58,550
other inclinations
um and and have succeeded

8638
02:39:58,550 --> 02:39:58,560
um and and have succeeded
 

8639
02:39:58,560 --> 02:39:59,590
um and and have succeeded
in

8640
02:39:59,590 --> 02:39:59,600
in
 

8641
02:39:59,600 --> 02:40:02,389
in
you know reductions of homicide in even

8642
02:40:02,389 --> 02:40:02,399
you know reductions of homicide in even
 

8643
02:40:02,399 --> 02:40:04,550
you know reductions of homicide in even
in the last couple hundred years and

8644
02:40:04,550 --> 02:40:04,560
in the last couple hundred years and
 

8645
02:40:04,560 --> 02:40:06,070
in the last couple hundred years and
some of that has to do with the myths

8646
02:40:06,070 --> 02:40:06,080
some of that has to do with the myths
 

8647
02:40:06,080 --> 02:40:07,830
some of that has to do with the myths
and stories we tell ourselves like again

8648
02:40:07,830 --> 02:40:07,840
and stories we tell ourselves like again
 

8649
02:40:07,840 --> 02:40:09,670
and stories we tell ourselves like again

8685
02:40:49,040 --> 02:40:50,790
it's such a fascinating how the these
myths are constructed

8686
02:40:50,790 --> 02:40:50,800
myths are constructed
 

8687
02:40:50,800 --> 02:40:52,469
myths are constructed
the

8688
02:40:52,469 --> 02:40:52,479

i just
think this is such an awesome setup in

think this is such an awesome setup in
 

8695
02:40:57,120 --> 02:40:58,230
think this is such an awesome setup in
terms of

8696
02:40:58,230 --> 02:40:58,240
terms of
 

8697
02:40:58,240 --> 02:41:00,870
terms of
a kind of heaven which is they spend the

8698

the passion the thing you're passionate
about without the consequences on top of

02:41:16,150 --> 02:41:16,160
about without the consequences on top of
 

8711
02:41:16,160 --> 02:41:17,110
about without the consequences on top of
that

8712
02:41:17,110 --> 02:41:17,120
that
 

8713
02:41:17,120 --> 02:41:20,469
that
i think there's a pig or a boar

8714

i think there's a pig or a boar
 

8715
02:41:20,479 --> 02:41:21,910
i think there's a pig or a boar
that

8716
02:41:21,910 --> 02:41:21,920

8719
02:41:24,800 --> 02:41:27,030
is they keep eating so it's regenerated
every single day so unlimited food and

8720
02:41:27,030 --> 02:41:27,040
every single day so unlimited food and
 

8721
02:41:27,040 --> 02:41:29,990
every single day so unlimited food and

like it's like or mead
yes yes yes yes mead i don't know that's

8726
02:41:34,950 --> 02:41:34,960
yes yes yes yes mead i don't know that's
 

8727
02:41:34,960 --> 02:41:36,389
yes yes yes yes mead i don't know that's
that's fascinating that we construct

8728
02:41:36,389 --> 02:41:36,399
that's fascinating that we construct
 

8729
02:41:36,399 --> 02:41:40,389
that's fascinating that we construct
these myths and at the same time

8730
02:41:40,389 --> 02:41:40,399
these myths and at the same time
 

8731
02:41:40,399 --> 02:41:41,269
these myths and at the same time
uh

8732
02:41:41,269 --> 02:41:41,279
uh
 

8733
02:41:41,279 --> 02:41:44,389
uh
these myths can be used

8734
02:41:44,389 --> 02:41:44,399
these myths can be used
 

8735
02:41:44,399 --> 02:41:46,630
these myths can be used
to get humans to do some of the worst

8736
02:41:46,630 --> 02:41:46,640
to get humans to do some of the worst
 

8737
02:41:46,640 --> 02:41:47,990
to get humans to do some of the worst
atrocities

8738
02:41:47,990 --> 02:41:48,000
atrocities
 

8739
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,309
atrocities
so some of the violence requires us to

8740
02:41:50,309 --> 02:41:50,319
so some of the violence requires us to
 

8741
02:41:50,319 --> 02:41:52,710
so some of the violence requires us to
have those myths of what is waiting for

8742
02:41:52,710 --> 02:41:52,720
have those myths of what is waiting for
 

8743
02:41:52,720 --> 02:41:55,670
have those myths of what is waiting for
us beyond death sort of beyond

8744
02:41:55,670 --> 02:41:55,680
us beyond death sort of beyond
 

8745
02:41:55,680 --> 02:41:58,870
us beyond death sort of beyond
over there in sugar candy mountain as uh

8746
02:41:58,870 --> 02:41:58,880
over there in sugar candy mountain as uh
 

8747
02:41:58,880 --> 02:42:01,910
over there in sugar candy mountain as uh
crow says that in animal farm and so

8748
02:42:01,910 --> 02:42:01,920
crow says that in animal farm and so
 

8749
02:42:01,920 --> 02:42:03,349
crow says that in animal farm and so
you know i think the more and more in

8750
02:42:03,349 --> 02:42:03,359
you know i think the more and more in
 

8751
02:42:03,359 --> 02:42:06,070
you know i think the more and more in
this modern society the positive of not

8752
02:42:06,070 --> 02:42:06,080
this modern society the positive of not
 

8753
02:42:06,080 --> 02:42:08,230
this modern society the positive of not
constructing so many myths is that we

8754
02:42:08,230 --> 02:42:08,240
constructing so many myths is that we
 

8755
02:42:08,240 --> 02:42:09,990
constructing so many myths is that we
get to live more in the moment and that

8756
02:42:09,990 --> 02:42:10,000
get to live more in the moment and that
 

8757
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,389
get to live more in the moment and that
forces us to optimize and improve the

8758
02:42:12,389 --> 02:42:12,399
forces us to optimize and improve the
 

8759
02:42:12,399 --> 02:42:14,469
forces us to optimize and improve the
moment and we get to face

8760
02:42:14,469 --> 02:42:14,479
moment and we get to face
 

8761
02:42:14,479 --> 02:42:17,190
moment and we get to face
the irrational and the painful aspect of

8762
02:42:17,190 --> 02:42:17,200
the irrational and the painful aspect of
 

8763
02:42:17,200 --> 02:42:18,870
the irrational and the painful aspect of
violence maybe we should reduce that in

8764
02:42:18,870 --> 02:42:18,880
violence maybe we should reduce that in
 

8765
02:42:18,880 --> 02:42:19,990
violence maybe we should reduce that in
the here and now

8766
02:42:19,990 --> 02:42:20,000
the here and now
 

8767
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,550
the here and now
yeah the downside is we may not if we

8768
02:42:22,550 --> 02:42:22,560
yeah the downside is we may not if we
 

8769
02:42:22,560 --> 02:42:24,630
yeah the downside is we may not if we
dispose of god or these kinds of

8770
02:42:24,630 --> 02:42:24,640
dispose of god or these kinds of
 

8771
02:42:24,640 --> 02:42:26,630
dispose of god or these kinds of
religious and spiritual ideas

8772
02:42:26,630 --> 02:42:26,640
religious and spiritual ideas
 

8773
02:42:26,640 --> 02:42:27,830
religious and spiritual ideas
we might

8774
02:42:27,830 --> 02:42:27,840
we might
 

8775
02:42:27,840 --> 02:42:29,830
we might
descend into a you know what nietzsche

8776
02:42:29,830 --> 02:42:29,840
descend into a you know what nietzsche
 

8777
02:42:29,840 --> 02:42:31,990
descend into a you know what nietzsche
worried about with nihilism

8778
02:42:31,990 --> 02:42:32,000
worried about with nihilism
 

8779
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:33,510
worried about with nihilism
and it's a beautiful dance because

8780
02:42:33,510 --> 02:42:33,520
and it's a beautiful dance because
 

8781
02:42:33,520 --> 02:42:35,190
and it's a beautiful dance because

any um brilliant insights into it other
 

8809
02:43:05,680 --> 02:43:07,750
any um brilliant insights into it other
than that you know

8810
02:43:07,750 --> 02:43:07,760
than that you know
 

8811
02:43:07,760 --> 02:43:10,309
than that you know
to agree with you that people

8812
02:43:10,309 --> 02:43:10,319
to agree with you that people

construct narratives uh well of their
 

8815
02:43:13,120 --> 02:43:15,510
construct narratives uh well of their
own lives and sometimes the

02:43:15,510 --> 02:43:15,520
own lives and sometimes the
 

8817
02:43:15,520 --> 02:43:18,070
own lives and sometimes the
the life after death um

8818
02:43:18,070 --> 02:43:18,080
the life after death um
 

8819
02:43:18,080 --> 02:43:19,990
the life after death um
but i guess i would add and this is

8820
02:43:19,990 --> 02:43:20,000
but i guess i would add and this is
 

8821
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:21,830
but i guess i would add and this is
maybe a more cynical view but you

8822
02:43:21,830 --> 02:43:21,840
maybe a more cynical view but you
 

8823
02:43:21,840 --> 02:43:25,510
maybe a more cynical view but you
mentioned atrocities i think that

8824
02:43:25,510 --> 02:43:25,520
mentioned atrocities i think that
 

8825
02:43:25,520 --> 02:43:27,670
mentioned atrocities i think that
leaders can sometimes

8826
02:43:27,670 --> 02:43:27,680
leaders can sometimes
 

8827
02:43:27,680 --> 02:43:29,750
leaders can sometimes
exploit

8828
02:43:29,750 --> 02:43:29,760
exploit
 

8829
02:43:29,760 --> 02:43:31,510
exploit
those under them

8830
02:43:31,510 --> 02:43:31,520
those under them
 

8831
02:43:31,520 --> 02:43:35,110
those under them
to create

8832
02:43:35,110 --> 02:43:35,120

 

8833
02:43:35,120 --> 02:43:38,389

forms of uh violence or justification

8834
02:43:38,389 --> 02:43:38,399
forms of uh violence or justification
 

8835
02:43:38,399 --> 02:43:40,070
forms of uh violence or justification
for um

8836
02:43:40,070 --> 02:43:40,080
for um
 

8837
02:43:40,080 --> 02:43:41,429
for um
for warfare

8838
02:43:41,429 --> 02:43:41,439
for warfare
 

8839
02:43:41,439 --> 02:43:44,550
for warfare
like in you know the like the the group

8840
02:43:44,550 --> 02:43:44,560
like in you know the like the the group
 

8841
02:43:44,560 --> 02:43:46,469
like in you know the like the the group
that we are conquering they are uh

8842
02:43:46,469 --> 02:43:46,479
that we are conquering they are uh
 

8843
02:43:46,479 --> 02:43:48,150
that we are conquering they are uh
sub-human they're

8844
02:43:48,150 --> 02:43:48,160
sub-human they're
 

8845
02:43:48,160 --> 02:43:50,389
sub-human they're
they're insects they're an infectious

8846
02:43:50,389 --> 02:43:50,399
they're insects they're an infectious
 

8847
02:43:50,399 --> 02:43:52,150
they're insects they're an infectious
disease that is

8848
02:43:52,150 --> 02:43:52,160
disease that is
 

8849
02:43:52,160 --> 02:43:53,750
disease that is
you know and so these

8850
02:43:53,750 --> 02:43:53,760
you know and so these
 

8851
02:43:53,760 --> 02:43:56,710
you know and so these
these narratives can be used by leaders

8852
02:43:56,710 --> 02:43:56,720
these narratives can be used by leaders
 

8853
02:43:56,720 --> 02:44:00,630
these narratives can be used by leaders
to exploit and motivate um people under

8854
02:44:00,630 --> 02:44:00,640
to exploit and motivate um people under
 

8855
02:44:00,640 --> 02:44:03,429
to exploit and motivate um people under
them to commit these atrocities

8856
02:44:03,429 --> 02:44:03,439
them to commit these atrocities
 

8857
02:44:03,439 --> 02:44:07,510
them to commit these atrocities
so it's a nastier part of our psychology

8858
02:44:07,510 --> 02:44:07,520
so it's a nastier part of our psychology
 

8859
02:44:07,520 --> 02:44:09,590
so it's a nastier part of our psychology
both that leaders do that but also that

8860
02:44:09,590 --> 02:44:09,600
both that leaders do that but also that
 

8861
02:44:09,600 --> 02:44:12,150
both that leaders do that but also that
people are vulnerable to narratives of

8862
02:44:12,150 --> 02:44:12,160
people are vulnerable to narratives of
 

8863
02:44:12,160 --> 02:44:14,710
people are vulnerable to narratives of
that sort yeah it's fascinating to look

8864
02:44:14,710 --> 02:44:14,720
that sort yeah it's fascinating to look
 

8865
02:44:14,720 --> 02:44:17,030
that sort yeah it's fascinating to look
pre-internet you hope the internet makes

8866
02:44:17,030 --> 02:44:17,040
pre-internet you hope the internet makes
 

8867
02:44:17,040 --> 02:44:19,190
pre-internet you hope the internet makes
us more resistant to that which i do

8868
02:44:19,190 --> 02:44:19,200
us more resistant to that which i do
 

8869
02:44:19,200 --> 02:44:21,349
us more resistant to that which i do
have probably a question on that but if

8870
02:44:21,349 --> 02:44:21,359
have probably a question on that but if
 

8871
02:44:21,359 --> 02:44:23,510
have probably a question on that but if
you look at just the propaganda machines

8872
02:44:23,510 --> 02:44:23,520
you look at just the propaganda machines
 

8873
02:44:23,520 --> 02:44:26,790
you look at just the propaganda machines
during world war ii on the nazi side and

8874
02:44:26,790 --> 02:44:26,800
during world war ii on the nazi side and
 

8875
02:44:26,800 --> 02:44:28,469
during world war ii on the nazi side and
on the soviet side

8876
02:44:28,469 --> 02:44:28,479
on the soviet side
 

8877
02:44:28,479 --> 02:44:30,150
on the soviet side
on every side but

8878
02:44:30,150 --> 02:44:30,160
on every side but
 

8879
02:44:30,160 --> 02:44:32,950
on every side but
particularly in those two it's so

8880
02:44:32,950 --> 02:44:32,960
particularly in those two it's so
 

8881
02:44:32,960 --> 02:44:35,349
particularly in those two it's so
fascinating both how effective a simple

8882
02:44:35,349 --> 02:44:35,359
fascinating both how effective a simple
 

8883
02:44:35,359 --> 02:44:36,710
fascinating both how effective a simple
message can be

8884
02:44:36,710 --> 02:44:36,720
message can be
 

8885
02:44:36,720 --> 02:44:37,830
message can be
in

8886
02:44:37,830 --> 02:44:37,840
in
 

8887
02:44:37,840 --> 02:44:40,150
in
a leader being able to convince

8888
02:44:40,150 --> 02:44:40,160
a leader being able to convince
 

8889
02:44:40,160 --> 02:44:43,590
a leader being able to convince
the small inner circle around them

8890
02:44:43,590 --> 02:44:43,600
the small inner circle around them
 

8891
02:44:43,600 --> 02:44:45,830
the small inner circle around them
uh convince themselves which is

8892
02:44:45,830 --> 02:44:45,840
uh convince themselves which is
 

8893
02:44:45,840 --> 02:44:47,910
uh convince themselves which is
fascinating propaganda and you start to

8894
02:44:47,910 --> 02:44:47,920
fascinating propaganda and you start to
 

8895
02:44:47,920 --> 02:44:49,990
fascinating propaganda and you start to
believe the propaganda degenerate and

8896
02:44:49,990 --> 02:44:50,000
believe the propaganda degenerate and
 

8897
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,630
believe the propaganda degenerate and
then how easily the the populace is

8898
02:44:52,630 --> 02:44:52,640
then how easily the the populace is
 

8899
02:44:52,640 --> 02:44:55,190
then how easily the the populace is
convincible again you hope that the

8900
02:44:55,190 --> 02:44:55,200
convincible again you hope that the
 

8901
02:44:55,200 --> 02:44:57,349
convincible again you hope that the
internet the distributed nature of the

8902
02:44:57,349 --> 02:44:57,359
internet the distributed nature of the
 

8903
02:44:57,359 --> 02:45:00,309
internet the distributed nature of the
internet makes it more difficult to run

8904
02:45:00,309 --> 02:45:00,319
internet makes it more difficult to run
 

8905
02:45:00,319 --> 02:45:02,389
internet makes it more difficult to run
a propaganda campaign at least of the

all the time you have to have a platform
what is free speech actually looks like

9108
02:48:23,830 --> 02:48:23,840
what is free speech actually looks like
 

9109
02:48:23,840 --> 02:48:25,590
what is free speech actually looks like
it's a platform where everybody can

9110
02:48:25,590 --> 02:48:25,600
it's a platform where everybody can
 

9111
02:48:25,600 --> 02:48:27,269
it's a platform where everybody can
challenge anybody

9112
02:48:27,269 --> 02:48:27,279
challenge anybody
 

9113
02:48:27,279 --> 02:48:28,389
challenge anybody
but not

9114
02:48:28,389 --> 02:48:28,399
but not
 

9115
02:48:28,399 --> 02:48:31,429
but not
destroy them by doing so mentally so you

9116
02:48:31,429 --> 02:48:31,439
destroy them by doing so mentally so you
 

9117
02:48:31,439 --> 02:48:33,510
destroy them by doing so mentally so you
have to balance

9118
02:48:33,510 --> 02:48:33,520
have to balance
 

9119
02:48:33,520 --> 02:48:35,750
have to balance
uh personal growth of each individual

9120
02:48:35,750 --> 02:48:35,760
uh personal growth of each individual
 

9121
02:48:35,760 --> 02:48:37,830
uh personal growth of each individual
person on the platform but definitely

9122
02:48:37,830 --> 02:48:37,840
person on the platform but definitely
 

9123
02:48:37,840 --> 02:48:40,150
person on the platform but definitely
removing people from a platform is a

9124
02:48:40,150 --> 02:48:40,160
removing people from a platform is a
 

9125
02:48:40,160 --> 02:48:43,429
removing people from a platform is a
terrible thing so on top of that

9126
02:48:43,429 --> 02:48:43,439
terrible thing so on top of that
 

9127
02:48:43,439 --> 02:48:47,110
terrible thing so on top of that
it's like how do you get measures

9128
02:48:47,110 --> 02:48:47,120
it's like how do you get measures
 

9129
02:48:47,120 --> 02:48:49,910
it's like how do you get measures
that the platform is doing good

9130
02:48:49,910 --> 02:48:49,920
that the platform is doing good
 

9131
02:48:49,920 --> 02:48:52,469
that the platform is doing good
what i really like what elon said and

9132
02:48:52,469 --> 02:48:52,479
what i really like what elon said and
 

9133
02:48:52,479 --> 02:48:54,710
what i really like what elon said and
i've talked to him about this is uh

9134
02:48:54,710 --> 02:48:54,720
i've talked to him about this is uh
 

9135
02:48:54,720 --> 02:48:56,150
i've talked to him about this is uh
pissing off

9136
02:48:56,150 --> 02:48:56,160
pissing off
 

9137
02:48:56,160 --> 02:48:58,550
pissing off
everybody equally the extremes of every

9138
02:48:58,550 --> 02:48:58,560
everybody equally the extremes of every
 

9139
02:48:58,560 --> 02:49:00,550
everybody equally the extremes of every
side equally in the political spectrum

9140
02:49:00,550 --> 02:49:00,560
side equally in the political spectrum
 

9141
02:49:00,560 --> 02:49:02,309
side equally in the political spectrum
you could say the left and the right

9142
02:49:02,309 --> 02:49:02,319
you could say the left and the right
 

9143
02:49:02,319 --> 02:49:04,710
you could say the left and the right
is uh measuring by pissing off the

9144
02:49:04,710 --> 02:49:04,720
is uh measuring by pissing off the
 

9145
02:49:04,720 --> 02:49:07,269
is uh measuring by pissing off the
extremes equally because currently there

9146
02:49:07,269 --> 02:49:07,279
extremes equally because currently there
 

9147
02:49:07,279 --> 02:49:09,269
extremes equally because currently there
seems to be an asymmetry in that so

9148
02:49:09,269 --> 02:49:09,279
seems to be an asymmetry in that so
 

9149
02:49:09,279 --> 02:49:11,110
seems to be an asymmetry in that so
that's one good measure that allows you

9150
02:49:11,110 --> 02:49:11,120
that's one good measure that allows you
 

9151
02:49:11,120 --> 02:49:13,030
that's one good measure that allows you
to maximize as he says

9152
02:49:13,030 --> 02:49:13,040
to maximize as he says
 

9153
02:49:13,040 --> 02:49:14,710
to maximize as he says
the area under the curve of human

9154
02:49:14,710 --> 02:49:14,720
the area under the curve of human
 

9155
02:49:14,720 --> 02:49:16,070
the area under the curve of human
happiness

9156
02:49:16,070 --> 02:49:16,080
happiness
 

9157
02:49:16,080 --> 02:49:17,110
happiness
uh

9158
02:49:17,110 --> 02:49:17,120
uh
 

9159
02:49:17,120 --> 02:49:19,830
uh
that's one thing the the other is repres

9160
02:49:19,830 --> 02:49:19,840
that's one thing the the other is repres
 

9161

that's one thing the the other is repres
people representing themselves

9162

people representing themselves
 

9163
02:49:22,560 --> 02:49:24,630
people representing themselves
honestly so removing the bots from the

9164
02:49:24,630 --> 02:49:24,640
honestly so removing the bots from the
 

9165
02:49:24,640 --> 02:49:26,550
honestly so removing the bots from the
platform it's such a weird world we live

9166
02:49:26,550 --> 02:49:26,560
platform it's such a weird world we live
 

9167
02:49:26,560 --> 02:49:28,309
platform it's such a weird world we live
in where you don't know who's real or

9168
02:49:28,309 --> 02:49:28,319
in where you don't know who's real or
 

9169

in where you don't know who's real or
not

02:49:29,429 --> 02:49:29,439
not
 

9171
02:49:29,439 --> 02:49:33,349
not
so anonymity is an awesome thing

9172
02:49:33,349 --> 02:49:33,359
so anonymity is an awesome thing
 

9173
02:49:33,359 --> 02:49:34,630
so anonymity is an awesome thing
the awesome

9174
02:49:34,630 --> 02:49:34,640
the awesome
 

9175
02:49:34,640 --> 02:49:36,389
the awesome
aspect of anonymity is it protects

9176
02:49:36,389 --> 02:49:36,399
aspect of anonymity is it protects
 

9177
02:49:36,399 --> 02:49:38,389
aspect of anonymity is it protects
people's privacy it actually gives them

9178
02:49:38,389 --> 02:49:38,399
people's privacy it actually gives them
 

9179
02:49:38,399 --> 02:49:41,030
people's privacy it actually gives them
freedom to think freedom to speak even

9180
02:49:41,030 --> 02:49:41,040
freedom to think freedom to speak even
 

9181
02:49:41,040 --> 02:49:42,309
freedom to think freedom to speak even
more so

9182
02:49:42,309 --> 02:49:42,319
more so
 

9183
02:49:42,319 --> 02:49:46,469
more so
but when anonymity is weaponized

9184
02:49:46,469 --> 02:49:46,479
but when anonymity is weaponized
 

9185
02:49:46,479 --> 02:49:48,389
but when anonymity is weaponized
it allows you to be cruel to others

9186
02:49:48,389 --> 02:49:48,399
it allows you to be cruel to others
 

9187
02:49:48,399 --> 02:49:50,070
it allows you to be cruel to others
without the repercussion of cruelty that

9188
02:49:50,070 --> 02:49:50,080
without the repercussion of cruelty that
 

9189
02:49:50,080 --> 02:49:51,910
without the repercussion of cruelty that
you would feel in the physical world

9190
02:49:51,910 --> 02:49:51,920
you would feel in the physical world
 

9191
02:49:51,920 --> 02:49:54,469
you would feel in the physical world
right so you want to use anonymity as a

9192
02:49:54,469 --> 02:49:54,479
right so you want to use anonymity as a
 

9193
02:49:54,479 --> 02:49:57,590
right so you want to use anonymity as a
shield versus as a as a sword

9194
02:49:57,590 --> 02:49:57,600
shield versus as a as a sword
 

9195
02:49:57,600 --> 02:49:59,990
shield versus as a as a sword
so to protect yourself from the attacks

9196
02:49:59,990 --> 02:50:00,000
so to protect yourself from the attacks
 

9197
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:01,990
so to protect yourself from the attacks
of others but not as a way to hurt

others and those are all
 

9201
02:50:03,840 --> 02:50:05,990
others and those are all
really tricky things to figure out

really tricky things to figure out
 

9203
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,550

for people

9224

domain because i i at least have hope
 

9229
02:50:29,520 --> 02:50:30,870
domain because i i at least have hope
for scientific communication where

9230
02:50:30,870 --> 02:50:30,880
for scientific communication where
 

9231
02:50:30,880 --> 02:50:32,070
for scientific communication where
people can

9232
02:50:32,070 --> 02:50:32,080
people can
 

9233
02:50:32,080 --> 02:50:33,750
people can
start playing around with different

start playing around with different
 

9235
02:50:33,760 --> 02:50:35,510
start playing around with different
mediums of communication so not just

9236
02:50:35,510 --> 02:50:35,520
mediums of communication so not just
 

9237
02:50:35,520 --> 02:50:38,070
mediums of communication so not just
academic papers but just ideas playing

academic papers but just ideas playing
 

9239
02:50:38,080 --> 02:50:40,070
academic papers but just ideas playing
with those ideas yeah absolutely

9240

with those ideas yeah absolutely
 

9241
02:50:40,080 --> 02:50:42,070
with those ideas yeah absolutely
especially when you have so evolution

9242
02:50:42,070 --> 02:50:42,080
especially when you have so evolution
 

9243
02:50:42,080 --> 02:50:44,389
especially when you have so evolution
psychology well no that even that it can

be super high turn
 

9247
02:50:48,240 --> 02:50:50,469
be super high turn
turnover rate of importance but you know

9248
02:50:50,469 --> 02:50:50,479
turnover rate of importance but you know
 

9249
02:50:50,479 --> 02:50:52,150
turnover rate of importance but you know
you have with kovid

it seems like the progress of science

9252
02:50:54,550 --> 02:50:54,560
it seems like the progress of science

and scientific debate
uh is most powerful in that context if

uh is most powerful in that context if
 

9257
02:50:59,120 --> 02:51:00,630
uh is most powerful in that context if
it's done really quickly and it feels

a lot of the time maybe

9300
02:51:48,389 --> 02:51:48,399
a lot of the time maybe

02:51:48,399 --> 02:51:50,469
a lot of the time maybe
majority of the time that institution is

02:51:52,230 --> 02:51:52,240
going to be correct
 

9305
02:51:52,240 --> 02:51:54,309
going to be correct
this consensus consensus is the

9306
02:51:54,309 --> 02:51:54,319
this consensus consensus is the
 

9307
02:51:54,319 --> 02:51:56,550
this consensus consensus is the
consensus because it's usually correct

9308
02:51:56,550 --> 02:51:56,560
consensus because it's usually correct
 

9309
02:51:56,560 --> 02:51:58,710
consensus because it's usually correct
but the biggest ideas

9310
02:51:58,710 --> 02:51:58,720
but the biggest ideas
 

9311
02:51:58,720 --> 02:52:01,190
but the biggest ideas
are going to be against the consensus

9312
02:52:01,190 --> 02:52:01,200
are going to be against the consensus
 

9313
02:52:01,200 --> 02:52:02,630
are going to be against the consensus
and certainly that's true in

9314
02:52:02,630 --> 02:52:02,640
and certainly that's true in
 

9315
02:52:02,640 --> 02:52:04,389
and certainly that's true in

in terms of figuring out human
 

9325
02:52:12,960 --> 02:52:15,990
in terms of figuring out human
psychology well there's a lot that we

9326
02:52:15,990 --> 02:52:16,000
psychology well there's a lot that we
 

9327
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:19,110
psychology well there's a lot that we
don't know i mean if human psychology if

9328
02:52:19,110 --> 02:52:19,120
don't know i mean if human psychology if
 

9329
02:52:19,120 --> 02:52:21,750

if it were a simple

9330
02:52:21,750 --> 02:52:21,760
if it were a simple
 

9331
02:52:21,760 --> 02:52:23,990
if it were a simple
thing and we only had

9332
02:52:23,990 --> 02:52:24,000
thing and we only had
 

9333
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:27,190
thing and we only had
you know three or half a dozen

9334
02:52:27,190 --> 02:52:27,200
you know three or half a dozen
 

9335
02:52:27,200 --> 02:52:29,670

psychological adaptations we would have

9336
02:52:29,670 --> 02:52:29,680
psychological adaptations we would have
 

9337
02:52:29,680 --> 02:52:32,230
psychological adaptations we would have
discovered all of them by now it's it's

9338
02:52:32,230 --> 02:52:32,240
discovered all of them by now it's it's
 

9339
02:52:32,240 --> 02:52:34,590
discovered all of them by now it's it's
that it's so complex

9340
02:52:34,590 --> 02:52:34,600
that it's so complex
 

9341
02:52:34,600 --> 02:52:38,389
that it's so complex
multifaceted multi-mechanism

9342
02:52:38,389 --> 02:52:38,399
multifaceted multi-mechanism
 

9343
02:52:38,399 --> 02:52:40,469
multifaceted multi-mechanism
um

9344
02:52:40,469 --> 02:52:40,479
um
 

9345
02:52:40,479 --> 02:52:43,190
um
part that describes human nature that

9346
02:52:43,190 --> 02:52:43,200
part that describes human nature that
 

9347
02:52:43,200 --> 02:52:45,590
part that describes human nature that
it was what makes it exciting but also

9348
02:52:45,590 --> 02:52:45,600
it was what makes it exciting but also
 

9349
02:52:45,600 --> 02:52:47,750
it was what makes it exciting but also
the amount that we know is small

9350
02:52:47,750 --> 02:52:47,760
the amount that we know is small
 

9351
02:52:47,760 --> 02:52:49,190
the amount that we know is small
compared to the amount that we don't

9352
02:52:49,190 --> 02:52:49,200
compared to the amount that we don't
 

9353
02:52:49,200 --> 02:52:51,030
compared to the amount that we don't
know and so that's why you have to

9354

you yeah well i think that
part of it is we

9490
02:55:16,790 --> 02:55:16,800
part of it is we
 

9491
02:55:16,800 --> 02:55:20,070
part of it is we
have these stereotypes that we expect

women
 

9615
02:57:28,160 --> 02:57:30,469

if a sex difference that i'm not aware
of that you should

9622
02:57:37,190 --> 02:57:37,200
of that you should
 

9623
02:57:37,200 --> 02:57:39,110
of that you should
i mean i i've heard that in a lot of

9624
02:57:39,110 --> 02:57:39,120
i mean i i've heard that in a lot of
 

9625
02:57:39,120 --> 02:57:42,950
i mean i i've heard that in a lot of
places so i wonder if there's some um

9626
02:57:42,950 --> 02:57:42,960
places so i wonder if there's some um
 

9627
02:57:42,960 --> 02:57:45,830
places so i wonder if there's some um
there's something about troop crime

9628
02:57:45,830 --> 02:57:45,840
there's something about troop crime
 

9629
02:57:45,840 --> 02:57:47,750
there's something about troop crime
maybe because it's um

9630
02:57:47,750 --> 02:57:47,760
maybe because it's um
 

9631
02:57:47,760 --> 02:57:49,750
maybe because it's um
just just like sexual kinks for for men

9632
02:57:49,750 --> 02:57:49,760
just just like sexual kinks for for men
 

9633
02:57:49,760 --> 02:57:51,590
just just like sexual kinks for for men
develop early on for the

9634
02:57:51,590 --> 02:57:51,600
develop early on for the
 

9635
02:57:51,600 --> 02:57:52,630
develop early on for the
the cues

9636
02:57:52,630 --> 02:57:52,640
the cues
 

9637
02:57:52,640 --> 02:57:54,710
the cues
maybe for women there's the cues of the

9638
02:57:54,710 --> 02:57:54,720
maybe for women there's the cues of the
 

9639
02:57:54,720 --> 02:57:56,389
maybe for women there's the cues of the
threat of violence

9640
02:57:56,389 --> 02:57:56,399
threat of violence
 

9641
02:57:56,399 --> 02:57:59,190
threat of violence
the attentiveness to violence

9642
02:57:59,190 --> 02:57:59,200
the attentiveness to violence
 

9643
02:57:59,200 --> 02:58:00,710
the attentiveness to violence
it develops early on and so and

9644
02:58:00,710 --> 02:58:00,720
it develops early on and so and
 

9645
02:58:00,720 --> 02:58:03,349
it develops early on and so and
therefore fascination with violence well

9646
02:58:03,349 --> 02:58:03,359
therefore fascination with violence well
 

9647
02:58:03,359 --> 02:58:05,429
therefore fascination with violence well
well i think that i mean one thing is

well i think that i mean one thing is
 

9649
02:58:05,439 --> 02:58:06,710
well i think that i mean one thing is
that

9650
02:58:06,710 --> 02:58:06,720
that
 

9651
02:58:06,720 --> 02:58:08,630
that
well with serial killers specifically i

9652
02:58:08,630 --> 02:58:08,640
well with serial killers specifically i
 

9653
02:58:08,640 --> 02:58:10,389
well with serial killers specifically i
don't know if this is true of true crime

9654
02:58:10,389 --> 02:58:10,399
don't know if this is true of true crime
 

9655
02:58:10,399 --> 02:58:11,750
don't know if this is true of true crime
in general but

9656
02:58:11,750 --> 02:58:11,760
in general but
 

9657
02:58:11,760 --> 02:58:15,349
in general but
serial killers like you you find like um

9658
02:58:15,349 --> 02:58:15,359
serial killers like you you find like um
 

9659
02:58:15,359 --> 02:58:17,590
serial killers like you you find like um
a lot of people well a lot of women fall

9660
02:58:17,590 --> 02:58:17,600
a lot of people well a lot of women fall
 

9661
02:58:17,600 --> 02:58:19,269
a lot of people well a lot of women fall
in love with them

9662
02:58:19,269 --> 02:58:19,279
in love with them
 

9663
02:58:19,279 --> 02:58:20,790
in love with them
or you know even if they're they're

9664
02:58:20,790 --> 02:58:20,800
or you know even if they're they're
 

9665
02:58:20,800 --> 02:58:23,110
or you know even if they're they're
jailed for serial killing

9666
02:58:23,110 --> 02:58:23,120
jailed for serial killing
 

9667
02:58:23,120 --> 02:58:26,230
jailed for serial killing
and i think one of the features of it is

9668
02:58:26,230 --> 02:58:26,240
and i think one of the features of it is
 

9669
02:58:26,240 --> 02:58:27,830
and i think one of the features of it is
that

9670
02:58:27,830 --> 02:58:27,840
that
 

9671
02:58:27,840 --> 02:58:31,190
that
it it parasitizes or hijacks

9672
02:58:31,190 --> 02:58:31,200
it it parasitizes or hijacks
 

9673
02:58:31,200 --> 02:58:34,469
it it parasitizes or hijacks
status mechanisms in that a key cue to

9674
02:58:34,469 --> 02:58:34,479
status mechanisms in that a key cue to
 

9675
02:58:34,479 --> 02:58:35,670
status mechanisms in that a key cue to
status

9676
02:58:35,670 --> 02:58:35,680
status
 

9677
02:58:35,680 --> 02:58:38,630
status
is the attention structure that is the

9678
02:58:38,630 --> 02:58:38,640
is the attention structure that is the
 

9679
02:58:38,640 --> 02:58:40,469
is the attention structure that is the
high status people are the people to

9680
02:58:40,469 --> 02:58:40,479
high status people are the people to
 

9681
02:58:40,479 --> 02:58:41,990
high status people are the people to
whom the most people pay the most

9682
02:58:41,990 --> 02:58:42,000
whom the most people pay the most
 

9683
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:45,349
whom the most people pay the most
attention and so serial killers garner a

9684
02:58:45,349 --> 02:58:45,359
attention and so serial killers garner a
 

9685
02:58:45,359 --> 02:58:47,830
attention and so serial killers garner a
lot of attention and

9686
02:58:47,830 --> 02:58:47,840
lot of attention and
 

9687
02:58:47,840 --> 02:58:49,670
lot of attention and
even though for

9688
02:58:49,670 --> 02:58:49,680
even though for
 

9689
02:58:49,680 --> 02:58:53,510
even though for
evil deeds um it's still attention

9690
02:58:53,510 --> 02:58:53,520
evil deeds um it's still attention
 

9691
02:58:53,520 --> 02:58:57,190
evil deeds um it's still attention
so i think that that hijacking of our

9692
02:58:57,190 --> 02:58:57,200
so i think that that hijacking of our
 

9693
02:58:57,200 --> 02:59:00,389
so i think that that hijacking of our
status allocation adaptations is partly

9694
02:59:00,389 --> 02:59:00,399
status allocation adaptations is partly
 

9695
02:59:00,399 --> 02:59:02,550
status allocation adaptations is partly
responsible for that

9696
02:59:02,550 --> 02:59:02,560
responsible for that
 

9697
02:59:02,560 --> 02:59:05,030
responsible for that
is there given the the trajectory of

9698
02:59:05,030 --> 02:59:05,040
is there given the the trajectory of
 

9699

02:59:19,510 --> 02:59:19,520
advice to young folks today
 

9711
02:59:19,520 --> 02:59:22,070
advice to young folks today
high school college thinking about how

on the mating you know and i i think
it's one of these things where

9730
02:59:43,269 --> 02:59:43,279
it's one of these things where
 

9731
02:59:43,279 --> 02:59:46,710
it's one of these things where
um you know we have requirements

9732

not to get an sti and so forth yeah my
my teacher uh put a condom on a banana

9754
03:00:11,670 --> 03:00:11,680
my teacher uh put a condom on a banana
 

9755
03:00:11,680 --> 03:00:13,030
my teacher uh put a condom on a banana
right right but

9756
03:00:13,030 --> 03:00:13,040
right right but
 

9757
03:00:13,040 --> 03:00:15,830
right right but
very excited but um how how to select a

9758
03:00:15,830 --> 03:00:15,840
very excited but um how how to select a
 

9759
03:00:15,840 --> 03:00:17,910
very excited but um how how to select a
maid um how do you know if you're in a

9760
03:00:17,910 --> 03:00:17,920
maid um how do you know if you're in a
 

9761
03:00:17,920 --> 03:00:21,349
maid um how do you know if you're in a
bad mating relationship uh how to how to

9762
03:00:21,349 --> 03:00:21,359
bad mating relationship uh how to how to
 

9763
03:00:21,359 --> 03:00:24,150
bad mating relationship uh how to how to
get out of a you know a bad mating

9764
03:00:24,150 --> 03:00:24,160
get out of a you know a bad mating
 

9765
03:00:24,160 --> 03:00:27,110
get out of a you know a bad mating
relationship um i think that

9766
03:00:27,110 --> 03:00:27,120
relationship um i think that
 

9767
03:00:27,120 --> 03:00:29,510
relationship um i think that
um that there's at this point in the

9768
03:00:29,510 --> 03:00:29,520
um that there's at this point in the
 

9769
03:00:29,520 --> 03:00:31,190
um that there's at this point in the
science even though there's a lot that

9770
03:00:31,190 --> 03:00:31,200
science even though there's a lot that
 

9771
03:00:31,200 --> 03:00:33,510
science even though there's a lot that
we don't know we know enough to at least

9772
03:00:33,510 --> 03:00:33,520
we don't know we know enough to at least
 

9773
03:00:33,520 --> 03:00:36,309
we don't know we know enough to at least
provide some heuristics or general guide

9774
03:00:36,309 --> 03:00:36,319
provide some heuristics or general guide
 

9775
03:00:36,319 --> 03:00:37,830
provide some heuristics or general guide
guidelines to

9776
03:00:37,830 --> 03:00:37,840
guidelines to
 

9777
03:00:37,840 --> 03:00:39,990
guidelines to
things to watch out for so just as a

9778
03:00:39,990 --> 03:00:40,000
things to watch out for so just as a
 

9779
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:41,670
things to watch out for so just as a
concrete example

9780
03:00:41,670 --> 03:00:41,680
concrete example
 

9781
03:00:41,680 --> 03:00:44,790
concrete example
uh with intimate partner violence uh

9782
03:00:44,790 --> 03:00:44,800
uh with intimate partner violence uh
 

9783
03:00:44,800 --> 03:00:47,030
uh with intimate partner violence uh
and this is male to female

9784
03:00:47,030 --> 03:00:47,040
and this is male to female
 

9785
03:00:47,040 --> 03:00:50,469
and this is male to female
there are statistical predictors of is

9786
03:00:50,469 --> 03:00:50,479
there are statistical predictors of is
 

9787
03:00:50,479 --> 03:00:51,670
there are statistical predictors of is
this guy

9788
03:00:51,670 --> 03:00:51,680
this guy
 

9789
03:00:51,680 --> 03:00:53,269
this guy
does he have an increased probability of

9790
03:00:53,269 --> 03:00:53,279
does he have an increased probability of
 

9791
03:00:53,279 --> 03:00:54,469
does he have an increased probability of
beating you up

9792
03:00:54,469 --> 03:00:54,479
beating you up
 

9793
03:00:54,479 --> 03:00:56,309
beating you up
uh and there are things like if he

9794
03:00:56,309 --> 03:00:56,319
uh and there are things like if he
 

9795
03:00:56,319 --> 03:00:58,389
uh and there are things like if he
starts to insist on knowing where you

9796
03:00:58,389 --> 03:00:58,399
starts to insist on knowing where you
 

9797
03:00:58,399 --> 03:01:00,870
starts to insist on knowing where you
are at all times if he starts cutting

9798
03:01:00,870 --> 03:01:00,880
are at all times if he starts cutting
 

9799
03:01:00,880 --> 03:01:02,950
are at all times if he starts cutting
off your relationships with your friends

9800
03:01:02,950 --> 03:01:02,960
off your relationships with your friends
 

9801
03:01:02,960 --> 03:01:04,389
off your relationships with your friends
and your family

9802
03:01:04,389 --> 03:01:04,399
and your family
 

9803
03:01:04,399 --> 03:01:05,269
and your family
um

9804
03:01:05,269 --> 03:01:05,279
um
 

9805
03:01:05,279 --> 03:01:08,230
um
so there are these kind of early warning

9806
03:01:08,230 --> 03:01:08,240
so there are these kind of early warning
 

9807
03:01:08,240 --> 03:01:10,150
so there are these kind of early warning
signs and i think women should know

9808
03:01:10,150 --> 03:01:10,160
signs and i think women should know
 

9809
03:01:10,160 --> 03:01:11,349
signs and i think women should know
about those

9810
03:01:11,349 --> 03:01:11,359
about those
 

9811
03:01:11,359 --> 03:01:14,469
about those
uh or even things like um

9812
03:01:14,469 --> 03:01:14,479
uh or even things like um
 

9813
03:01:14,479 --> 03:01:17,670
uh or even things like um
that women are most in danger of being

9814
03:01:17,670 --> 03:01:17,680
that women are most in danger of being
 

9815
03:01:17,680 --> 03:01:20,550
that women are most in danger of being
killed by an ex during the first

9816
03:01:20,550 --> 03:01:20,560
killed by an ex during the first
 

9817
03:01:20,560 --> 03:01:22,469
killed by an ex during the first
three to six months after they've broken

9818
03:01:22,469 --> 03:01:22,479
three to six months after they've broken
 

9819
03:01:22,479 --> 03:01:23,590
three to six months after they've broken
up with him

9820
03:01:23,590 --> 03:01:23,600
up with him
 

9821
03:01:23,600 --> 03:01:25,269
up with him
you know that that sometimes they think

9822
03:01:25,269 --> 03:01:25,279
you know that that sometimes they think
 

9823
03:01:25,279 --> 03:01:27,110
you know that that sometimes they think
it's you know the guy will say

9824
03:01:27,110 --> 03:01:27,120
it's you know the guy will say
 

9825
03:01:27,120 --> 03:01:29,670
it's you know the guy will say
meet with me one one last time and then

9826
03:01:29,670 --> 03:01:29,680
meet with me one one last time and then
 

9827
03:01:29,680 --> 03:01:31,429
meet with me one one last time and then
i won't bother you again

9828
03:01:31,429 --> 03:01:31,439
i won't bother you again
 

9829
03:01:31,439 --> 03:01:33,750
i won't bother you again
um no this is a dangerous time so i

9830
03:01:33,750 --> 03:01:33,760
um no this is a dangerous time so i
 

9831
03:01:33,760 --> 03:01:35,990
um no this is a dangerous time so i
think there's some knowledge

9832
03:01:35,990 --> 03:01:36,000
think there's some knowledge
 

9833
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:38,389
think there's some knowledge
that we do know that can be used to make

9834
03:01:38,389 --> 03:01:38,399
that we do know that can be used to make
 

9835
03:01:38,399 --> 03:01:40,389
that we do know that can be used to make
informed decisions about our mating

9836
03:01:40,389 --> 03:01:40,399
informed decisions about our mating
 

9837
03:01:40,399 --> 03:01:42,469
informed decisions about our mating
lives and i think that should be taught

9838
03:01:42,469 --> 03:01:42,479
lives and i think that should be taught
 

9839
03:01:42,479 --> 03:01:44,469
lives and i think that should be taught
so consider that

9840
03:01:44,469 --> 03:01:44,479
so consider that
 

9841
03:01:44,479 --> 03:01:46,389
so consider that
like take that the the ma the mating

9842
03:01:46,389 --> 03:01:46,399
like take that the the ma the mating
 

9843
03:01:46,399 --> 03:01:48,309
like take that the the ma the mating
strategies the main demanding life

9844
03:01:48,309 --> 03:01:48,319
strategies the main demanding life
 

9845
03:01:48,319 --> 03:01:49,510
strategies the main demanding life
seriously

9846
03:01:49,510 --> 03:01:49,520
seriously
 

9847
03:01:49,520 --> 03:01:53,269
seriously
yeah yeah absolutely and uh because um

9848
03:01:53,269 --> 03:01:53,279
yeah yeah absolutely and uh because um
 

9849
03:01:53,279 --> 03:01:54,950
yeah yeah absolutely and uh because um
you know aside from

9850
03:01:54,950 --> 03:01:54,960
you know aside from
 

9851
03:01:54,960 --> 03:01:56,870
you know aside from
a small number of people who are totally

9852
03:01:56,870 --> 03:01:56,880
a small number of people who are totally
 

9853
03:01:56,880 --> 03:01:59,590
a small number of people who are totally
uninterested in any kind of mating

9854
03:01:59,590 --> 03:01:59,600
uninterested in any kind of mating
 

9855
03:01:59,600 --> 03:02:01,750
uninterested in any kind of mating
or sexuality and there are a small

9856
03:02:01,750 --> 03:02:01,760
or sexuality and there are a small
 

9857
03:02:01,760 --> 03:02:04,630
or sexuality and there are a small
percentage that fall under that category

9858
03:02:04,630 --> 03:02:04,640
percentage that fall under that category
 

9859
03:02:04,640 --> 03:02:07,590
percentage that fall under that category
um we all confront problems of mating

9860
03:02:07,590 --> 03:02:07,600
um we all confront problems of mating
 

9861
03:02:07,600 --> 03:02:09,910
um we all confront problems of mating
how do you you know there's that uh um

9862
03:02:09,910 --> 03:02:09,920
how do you you know there's that uh um
 

9863
03:02:09,920 --> 03:02:11,910
how do you you know there's that uh um
called the mathematical model like

9864
03:02:11,910 --> 03:02:11,920
called the mathematical model like
 

9865
03:02:11,920 --> 03:02:14,070
called the mathematical model like
secretary problem marriage problem i

9866
03:02:14,070 --> 03:02:14,080
secretary problem marriage problem i
 

9867
03:02:14,080 --> 03:02:15,269
secretary problem marriage problem i
don't know if you're familiar but

9868
03:02:15,269 --> 03:02:15,279
don't know if you're familiar but
 

9869
03:02:15,279 --> 03:02:18,630
don't know if you're familiar but
basically you have a it's it's a silly

9870
03:02:18,630 --> 03:02:18,640
basically you have a it's it's a silly
 

9871
03:02:18,640 --> 03:02:19,750
basically you have a it's it's a silly
perhaps not

9872
03:02:19,750 --> 03:02:19,760
perhaps not
 

9873
03:02:19,760 --> 03:02:21,030
perhaps not
uh

9874
03:02:21,030 --> 03:02:21,040
uh
 

9875
03:02:21,040 --> 03:02:24,469
uh
it's a formalized simplified

9876
03:02:24,469 --> 03:02:24,479
it's a formalized simplified
 

9877
03:02:24,479 --> 03:02:26,309
it's a formalized simplified
cueing theory type of thing where it's

9878
03:02:26,309 --> 03:02:26,319
cueing theory type of thing where it's
 

9879
03:02:26,319 --> 03:02:29,429
cueing theory type of thing where it's
you have and and subjects and

9880
03:02:29,429 --> 03:02:29,439
you have and and subjects and
 

9881
03:02:29,439 --> 03:02:31,510
you have and and subjects and
you get to date some number of

9882
03:02:31,510 --> 03:02:31,520
you get to date some number of
 

9883
03:02:31,520 --> 03:02:32,550
you get to date some number of
um

9884
03:02:32,550 --> 03:02:32,560
um
 

9885
03:02:32,560 --> 03:02:33,830
um
people

9886
03:02:33,830 --> 03:02:33,840
people
 

9887
03:02:33,840 --> 03:02:36,230
people
and then there's a stopping condition i

9888
03:02:36,230 --> 03:02:36,240
and then there's a stopping condition i
 

9889
03:02:36,240 --> 03:02:38,630
and then there's a stopping condition i
believe it's n over e

9890
03:02:38,630 --> 03:02:38,640
believe it's n over e
 

9891
03:02:38,640 --> 03:02:41,830
believe it's n over e
beyond which you pick the next partner

9892
03:02:41,830 --> 03:02:41,840
beyond which you pick the next partner
 

9893
03:02:41,840 --> 03:02:43,269
beyond which you pick the next partner
which is better than anybody you've

9894
03:02:43,269 --> 03:02:43,279
which is better than anybody you've
 

9895
03:02:43,279 --> 03:02:44,469
which is better than anybody you've
dated before

9896
03:02:44,469 --> 03:02:44,479
dated before
 

9897
03:02:44,479 --> 03:02:45,190
dated before
so

9898
03:02:45,190 --> 03:02:45,200
so
 

9899
03:02:45,200 --> 03:02:48,550
so
uh yeah let's not over emphasize that

9900
03:02:48,550 --> 03:02:48,560
uh yeah let's not over emphasize that
 

9901
03:02:48,560 --> 03:02:50,070
uh yeah let's not over emphasize that
idea but

9902
03:02:50,070 --> 03:02:50,080
idea but
 

9903
03:02:50,080 --> 03:02:51,110
idea but
um

9904
03:02:51,110 --> 03:02:51,120
um
 

9905
03:02:51,120 --> 03:02:53,990
um
if i were to psychologize it i would say

9906
03:02:53,990 --> 03:02:54,000
if i were to psychologize it i would say
 

9907
03:02:54,000 --> 03:02:54,790
if i were to psychologize it i would say
that

9908
03:02:54,790 --> 03:02:54,800
that
 

9909
03:02:54,800 --> 03:02:57,510
that
some exploration is good

9910
03:02:57,510 --> 03:02:57,520
some exploration is good
 

9911
03:02:57,520 --> 03:02:59,830
some exploration is good
some dating is good but at a certain

9912
03:02:59,830 --> 03:02:59,840
some dating is good but at a certain
 

9913
03:02:59,840 --> 03:03:02,150
some dating is good but at a certain
point you pick somebody given the set of

9914
03:03:02,150 --> 03:03:02,160

03:11:41,269 --> 03:11:41,279
human being that's hard to explain
 

10401
03:11:41,279 --> 03:11:43,190
human being that's hard to explain
well we talked about it a little bit but

10402
03:11:43,190 --> 03:11:43,200
well we talked about it a little bit but
 

10403
03:11:43,200 --> 03:11:45,429
well we talked about it a little bit but
so we're talking about love like like

10404

so we're talking about love like like
 

10405
03:11:45,439 --> 03:11:48,950

romantic love um
 

10407
03:11:48,960 --> 03:11:51,429
romantic love um
i think it's an evolved emotion

10408
03:11:51,429 --> 03:11:51,439
i think it's an evolved emotion
 

10409
03:11:51,439 --> 03:11:53,110
i think it's an evolved emotion
that evolved

10410
03:11:53,110 --> 03:11:53,120
that evolved
 

10411
03:11:53,120 --> 03:11:56,870
that evolved
in part to solidify long-term

10412
03:11:56,870 --> 03:11:56,880
in part to solidify long-term
 

10413
03:11:56,880 --> 03:11:58,389
in part to solidify long-term
pair bonds

10414
03:11:58,389 --> 03:11:58,399
pair bonds
 

10415
03:11:58,399 --> 03:12:00,950
pair bonds
uh and is it different from the love of

10416
03:12:00,950 --> 03:12:00,960
uh and is it different from the love of
 

10417
03:12:00,960 --> 03:12:03,349
uh and is it different from the love of
a parent for a child or or brotherly

10418
03:12:03,349 --> 03:12:03,359
a parent for a child or or brotherly

a parent for a child or or brotherly
love or sisterly love or

10420
03:12:05,590 --> 03:12:05,600
love or sisterly love or
 

10421
03:12:05,600 --> 03:12:08,229
love or sisterly love or
other friendship love i think these are

10422
03:12:08,229 --> 03:12:08,239
other friendship love i think these are
 

10423
03:12:08,239 --> 03:12:10,550
other friendship love i think these are
different phenomena but if we're talking

10424
03:12:10,550 --> 03:12:10,560
different phenomena but if we're talking
 

10425
03:12:10,560 --> 03:12:12,710
different phenomena but if we're talking
about roman romantic love i think it's

10426
03:12:12,710 --> 03:12:12,720
about roman romantic love i think it's
 

10427
03:12:12,720 --> 03:12:14,469
about roman romantic love i think it's
an evolved emotion

10428
03:12:14,469 --> 03:12:14,479
an evolved emotion
 

10429
03:12:14,479 --> 03:12:15,429
an evolved emotion
um

10430
03:12:15,429 --> 03:12:15,439
um
 

10431
03:12:15,439 --> 03:12:17,990
um
leading hypothesis is that it's a it's a

10432
03:12:17,990 --> 03:12:18,000
leading hypothesis is that it's a it's a
 

10433
03:12:18,000 --> 03:12:19,830
leading hypothesis is that it's a it's a
commitment device

10434
03:12:19,830 --> 03:12:19,840
commitment device
 

10435
03:12:19,840 --> 03:12:21,590
commitment device
uh so if i

10436
03:12:21,590 --> 03:12:21,600
uh so if i
 

10437
03:12:21,600 --> 03:12:24,389
uh so if i
say to a potential mate um

oh uh you exceed my minimum thresholds
 

10441
03:12:27,520 --> 03:12:31,110
oh uh you exceed my minimum thresholds
on intelligence and and looks i think we

10442
03:12:31,110 --> 03:12:31,120
on intelligence and and looks i think we
 

10443
03:12:31,120 --> 03:12:33,030
on intelligence and and looks i think we
we make a good couple it's a good pickup

10444
03:12:33,030 --> 03:12:33,040
we make a good couple it's a good pickup

it's that's so interesting but that's
you know it's still

10472
03:13:09,110 --> 03:13:09,120
you know it's still

obviously but
 

10751
03:18:18,960 --> 03:18:23,110
obviously but
there's some way in which it kind of um

10752
03:18:23,110 --> 03:18:23,120
there's some way in which it kind of um
 

10753
03:18:23,120 --> 03:18:26,309
there's some way in which it kind of um
made it more familiar so that it's

10754
03:18:26,309 --> 03:18:26,319
made it more familiar so that it's
 

10755
03:18:26,319 --> 03:18:28,870
made it more familiar so that it's
uh became a lot less frightening

10756
03:18:28,870 --> 03:18:28,880
uh became a lot less frightening
 

10757
03:18:28,880 --> 03:18:30,790
uh became a lot less frightening
you know um

10758
03:18:30,790 --> 03:18:30,800
you know um
 

10759
03:18:30,800 --> 03:18:33,110
you know um
but um

10760
03:18:33,110 --> 03:18:33,120
but um
 

10761
03:18:33,120 --> 03:18:36,550
but um
how did that experience change you just

10762
03:18:36,550 --> 03:18:36,560
how did that experience change you just
 

10763
03:18:36,560 --> 03:18:38,550
how did that experience change you just
as a scientist as a thinker about

10764
03:18:38,550 --> 03:18:38,560
as a scientist as a thinker about
 

10765
03:18:38,560 --> 03:18:40,790
as a scientist as a thinker about
humanity

10766
03:18:40,790 --> 03:18:40,800
humanity
 

10767
03:18:40,800 --> 03:18:42,070
humanity
um

10768
03:18:42,070 --> 03:18:42,080
um
 

10769
03:18:42,080 --> 03:18:45,670
um
as a as a human yourself well i guess so

10770
03:18:45,670 --> 03:18:45,680
as a as a human yourself well i guess so
 

10771
03:18:45,680 --> 03:18:48,229
as a as a human yourself well i guess so
you're saying you felt

10772
03:18:48,229 --> 03:18:48,239
you're saying you felt
 

10773
03:18:48,239 --> 03:18:49,910
you're saying you felt
like you felt a little bit more ready

10774
03:18:49,910 --> 03:18:49,920
like you felt a little bit more ready
 

10775
03:18:49,920 --> 03:18:51,269
like you felt a little bit more ready
for this whole

10776
03:18:51,269 --> 03:18:51,279
for this whole
 

10777
03:18:51,279 --> 03:18:53,910
for this whole
end of the party well yeah it's yeah

10778
03:18:53,910 --> 03:18:53,920
end of the party well yeah it's yeah
 

10779
03:18:53,920 --> 03:18:54,870
end of the party well yeah it's yeah
because

10780
03:18:54,870 --> 03:18:54,880
because
 

10781
03:18:54,880 --> 03:18:56,550
because
we tend to be

10782
03:18:56,550 --> 03:18:56,560
we tend to be
 

10783
03:18:56,560 --> 03:18:59,190
we tend to be
afraid of things that we're not familiar

10784
03:18:59,190 --> 03:18:59,200
afraid of things that we're not familiar
 

10785
03:18:59,200 --> 03:19:01,670
afraid of things that we're not familiar
with you know and so if you're familiar

10786
03:19:01,670 --> 03:19:01,680
with you know and so if you're familiar
 

10787
03:19:01,680 --> 03:19:02,630
with you know and so if you're familiar
with it

10788
03:19:02,630 --> 03:19:02,640
with it
 

10789
03:19:02,640 --> 03:19:03,990
with it
um

10790
03:19:03,990 --> 03:19:04,000
um
 

10791
03:19:04,000 --> 03:19:06,950
um
at least in my case that that caused a

10792
03:19:06,950 --> 03:19:06,960
at least in my case that that caused a
 

10793
03:19:06,960 --> 03:19:10,229
at least in my case that that caused a
lessening of um fear on that dimension

10794
03:19:10,229 --> 03:19:10,239
lessening of um fear on that dimension
 

10795
03:19:10,239 --> 03:19:11,030
lessening of um fear on that dimension
but

10796
03:19:11,030 --> 03:19:11,040
but
 

10797
03:19:11,040 --> 03:19:13,110

a chink of light between two eternities

10832
03:19:51,269 --> 03:19:51,279
a chink of light between two eternities
 

10833
03:19:51,279 --> 03:19:54,229
a chink of light between two eternities
of darkness

10834
03:19:54,229 --> 03:19:54,239

 

10835
03:19:54,239 --> 03:19:55,750

and you're saying that's not terrifying

10836
03:19:55,750 --> 03:19:55,760
and you're saying that's not terrifying
 

10837
03:19:55,760 --> 03:19:57,030
and you're saying that's not terrifying
to you

10838
03:19:57,030 --> 03:19:57,040
to you
 

10839
03:19:57,040 --> 03:19:59,590
to you
well i i'd prefer i'm happy with the

10840
03:19:59,590 --> 03:19:59,600
well i i'd prefer i'm happy with the
 

10841
03:19:59,600 --> 03:20:01,990
well i i'd prefer i'm happy with the
prior the first eternity of darkness i

10842
03:20:01,990 --> 03:20:02,000
prior the first eternity of darkness i
 

10843
03:20:02,000 --> 03:20:06,070
prior the first eternity of darkness i
prefer the second um not to occur but um

10844
03:20:06,070 --> 03:20:06,080
prefer the second um not to occur but um
 

10845
03:20:06,080 --> 03:20:08,070
prefer the second um not to occur but um
but it's going to occur i mean it's um

10846
03:20:08,070 --> 03:20:08,080
but it's going to occur i mean it's um
 

10847
03:20:08,080 --> 03:20:09,990
but it's going to occur i mean it's um
we know that uh

10848
03:20:09,990 --> 03:20:10,000
we know that uh
 

10849
03:20:10,000 --> 03:20:13,349
we know that uh
um elon musk aside i i i'm

10850
03:20:13,349 --> 03:20:13,359
um elon musk aside i i i'm
 

10851
03:20:13,359 --> 03:20:15,190
um elon musk aside i i i'm
skeptical that we'll be

10852
03:20:15,190 --> 03:20:15,200
skeptical that we'll be
 

10853
03:20:15,200 --> 03:20:18,070
skeptical that we'll be
colonizing other planets in any

10854
03:20:18,070 --> 03:20:18,080
colonizing other planets in any
 

10855
03:20:18,080 --> 03:20:19,670
colonizing other planets in any
substantive way

10856
03:20:19,670 --> 03:20:19,680
substantive way
 

10857
03:20:19,680 --> 03:20:23,750
substantive way
uh and so our our star our sun will will

10858
03:20:23,750 --> 03:20:23,760
uh and so our our star our sun will will
 

10859
03:20:23,760 --> 03:20:24,950
uh and so our our star our sun will will
burn out

10860
03:20:24,950 --> 03:20:24,960
burn out
 

10861
03:20:24,960 --> 03:20:27,190
burn out
and so it might it's going to take a few

10862
03:20:27,190 --> 03:20:27,200
and so it might it's going to take a few
 

10863
03:20:27,200 --> 03:20:29,269
and so it might it's going to take a few
billion years or so but

10864
03:20:29,269 --> 03:20:29,279
billion years or so but
 

10865
03:20:29,279 --> 03:20:31,429
billion years or so but

but
 

11117
03:24:57,279 --> 03:24:59,269
